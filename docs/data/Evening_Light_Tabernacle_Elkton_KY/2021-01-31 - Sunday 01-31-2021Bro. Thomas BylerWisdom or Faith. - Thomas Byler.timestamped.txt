[48:26] hey man good to be in the house house of
[48:29] the lord this morning
[48:30] if you would let's just stand
[48:34] got a lot out to this morning uh various
[48:37] reasons i'm sure
[48:38] uh seems like uh covet has certainly
[48:41] made its rounds so we want to remember
[48:43] all those in prayer this morning
[48:45] suffering with covet and different
[48:47] ailments
[48:49] and just ask the lord to move on them in
[48:51] a mighty way touch their bodies heal
[48:53] them restore their strength
[48:55] it's my understanding it takes a lot out
[48:56] of you so i
[48:58] just need the prayer of the brothers and
[49:00] sisters so brother john hershberger
[49:02] would you open a service in prayer this
[49:14] morning
[49:29] yes lord
[49:42] yes
[49:48] yes lord
[49:54] hey man if you would turn your bibles to
[49:56] the book of psalms we'll read
[49:58] chapter 26.
[50:08] book of psalms chapter 26.
[50:14] judge me o lord for i have walked in
[50:15] thine integrity
[50:17] i have trusted also in the lord
[50:19] therefore i shall not slide
[50:27] for thy loving kindness is before mine
[50:29] eyes and i have walked in thy truth
[50:38] i have hated the congregation of evil
[50:40] doers and will not sit at
[50:43] with the wicked
[50:50] that i may publish with the voice of
[50:52] thanksgiving and tell
[50:54] all thy wondrous works
[51:02] gather not my soul with the sinners nor
[51:04] my life with the bloody man
[51:11] but as for me i will walk in mine
[51:13] integrity
[51:14] redeem me and be merciful unto me
[51:16] altogether
[51:18] my foot standeth in an even place in the
[51:21] congregation
[51:22] will i bless the lord amen
[51:25] brother troy
[51:36] good morning brothers and sisters
[51:41] okay so uh well
[51:44] we'll attempt to do a song service or uh
[51:47] he asked me last night and so
[51:51] you'll just have to bear with me i was
[51:52] gonna pick out randomly so i wouldn't
[51:54] have to sing so many songs just
[51:56] people to come up and sing specials
[51:59] but there's a lot of people missing so
[52:03] and then my go-to special was going to
[52:05] be woody and michelle
[52:07] but they said that they might not have
[52:09] they might have needed natalie for their
[52:11] special too so we might sing four songs
[52:13] this morning
[52:14] but uh it's good to be in the house of
[52:16] the lord this morning
[52:18] um like brother brad mentioned there's a
[52:20] lot out sick
[52:21] uh with different things and well
[52:24] mostly covet i guess but it's good to be
[52:27] in the house lord
[52:28] the word says where two or three are
[52:30] gathered together
[52:31] they're all being their midst and that's
[52:33] what we're here this morning for we
[52:35] never
[52:36] we never got up out of bed and got
[52:38] dressed and drove very far
[52:40] or uh for nothing
[52:44] we drove here and we're here to hear the
[52:46] word of the lord and to get something
[52:47] from
[52:48] the lord this morning we're in a not so
[52:50] great world right now it's crumbling all

[1:15:27] morning in jesus name
[1:15:29] amen and amen open your bibles if you
[1:15:32] will and we'll begin with genesis if
[1:15:33] that's okay
[1:15:35] genesis and also first corinthians the
[1:15:38] second chapter
[1:15:39] one through five so if you want to pick
[1:15:41] those two up this morning we'll go for a
[1:15:43] little while
[1:15:44] amen now there will not be a wednesday
[1:15:46] evening service
[1:15:48] amen and hopefully after this coming

[1:15:53] we'll be able to continue our wednesday
[1:15:55] night services too but with
[1:15:57] it being a little rampant like this
[1:15:58] we'll just hold off on our midweek
[1:16:00] service one
[1:16:02] more time anyway didn't really want to
[1:16:04] do that but with everything that's going
[1:16:05] on i think i will
[1:16:07] and then also uh one more announcement
[1:16:09] that is uh
[1:16:11] brother uh brother andrew glover is
[1:16:14] supposed to be with us next weekend so
[1:16:16] that's going to be a treat
[1:16:17] amen brother andrew glover amen so pray
[1:16:19] for him
[1:16:20] all right genesis 3
[1:16:23] amen how many knows that everything
[1:16:28] had a beginning and it all started in
[1:16:30] genesis
[1:16:31] amen and so we're going to go to genesis
[1:16:33] and go to chapter 3 and
[1:16:35] read that just one more time now the
[1:16:37] serpent was more subtle
[1:16:39] than any beast of the field which the
[1:16:41] lord god had made
[1:16:42] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[1:16:44] said ye shall not eat of every tree
[1:16:46] of the garden and the woman said unto
[1:16:49] the serpent
[1:16:49] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[1:16:51] the garden but if the fruit of the tree
[1:16:53] which is in the midst of the garden
[1:16:56] god has said you shall not eat of it
[1:16:58] neither shall you
[1:16:59] touch it least ye die
[1:17:03] the serpent said unto the woman ye shall
[1:17:04] not surely die
[1:17:06] for god does know that in the day you
[1:17:08] eat thereof your eyes are going to be
[1:17:10] opened and you'll be as
[1:17:11] gods knowing good and evil
[1:17:14] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:17:16] good for food and that it was pleasant
[1:17:17] to the eyes
[1:17:18] and a tree to be desired to make
[1:17:22] one wise
[1:17:25] she took of the fruit thereof and did he
[1:17:27] and gave also to her husband with her
[1:17:29] and she did the and the eyes of them
[1:17:32] both were opened
[1:17:34] and they knew that they were naked and
[1:17:36] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[1:17:38] themselves aprons over in first
[1:17:41] corinthians if you want to go with that
[1:17:43] first corinthians the second chapter
[1:17:46] amen these two scriptures go hand in
[1:17:48] hand
[1:17:52] remember that
[1:17:55] it said that this tree was desired to
[1:17:58] make one
[1:18:00] wise so it had to do with wisdom
[1:18:04] all right so our secrets not secret but
[1:18:07] our key words this morning is wisdom
[1:18:10] and faith okay wisdom the wisdom of man
[1:18:14] or faith in the power of god first
[1:18:17] corinthians chapter 2 verse 1
[1:18:19] and i brethren when i came to you came
[1:18:22] not with
[1:18:23] excellency of speech or
[1:18:27] of wisdom declaring unto you the
[1:18:30] testimony of god now remember that's
[1:18:31] exactly
[1:18:33] what the serpent did he was declaring
[1:18:36] unto eve the testimony of god is that
[1:18:39] right
[1:18:40] he said god has said you are not surely
[1:18:42] going to die
[1:18:43] all right he was declaring it he was
[1:18:45] talking about it
[1:18:47] he had his speech was of wisdom though
[1:18:50] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[1:18:52] for i am determined not to know anything
[1:18:54] among you
[1:18:55] save jesus christ and him crucified
[1:18:59] and i was with you in weakness and in
[1:19:00] fear and in much trembling
[1:19:02] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:19:05] with enticing words
[1:19:07] of man's wisdom but its demonstration of
[1:19:11] the spirit
[1:19:12] and of power
[1:19:15] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:19:18] wisdom of men
[1:19:19] but in the power of god amen may god add
[1:19:22] his blessings to the reading of the word
[1:19:24] you can be seated amen wisdom
[1:19:28] or faith wisdom or faith that's the
[1:19:31] scripture that came to me
[1:19:33] that's what i began to think about i
[1:19:34] felt like the lord laid upon my heart
[1:19:37] and then i the lord kind of brought in
[1:19:39] my mind of a scripture and of a
[1:19:41] sermon that the prophet of god preached
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:44] when he preached a message in 62 called
[1:19:47] wisdom
[1:19:48] versus faith wisdom versus faith
[1:19:52] amen so if you don't mind i'm just going
[1:19:55] to read a couple quotes of something
[1:19:56] that he said that i like real well
[1:19:58] amen to kind of lay a foundation
[1:20:02] amen praise the lord
[1:20:06] he says now notice he says that there's
[1:20:09] two sources that we can draw our life
[1:20:12] from
[1:20:13] one of them is wisdom and the other
[1:20:17] is faith amen
[1:20:20] remember just as you know because we
[1:20:23] realize that
[1:20:24] wisdom comes from
[1:20:27] also comes from doubt all right it
[1:20:30] brings down
[1:20:31] all right now we know that there is a
[1:20:33] godly wisdom and there is
[1:20:35] a wisdom that comes from god and there's
[1:20:38] a wisdom that comes from the devil
[1:20:40] the wisdom of god always points you to
[1:20:42] the word of god
[1:20:43] anything outside of that is the wisdom
[1:20:46] that comes from satan
[1:20:48] all right two sources she says one is
[1:20:50] faith and one is doubt
[1:20:52] and if we think that wisdom what
[1:20:55] wisdom produce and then what faith
[1:20:58] produces but those two sources
[1:21:02] we're going to talk about them and so
[1:21:03] forth he says
[1:21:05] and now notice also something that he
[1:21:07] said because if y'all remember
[1:21:10] the lord told brother bantam he says to
[1:21:12] go back to jeffersonville and so forth
[1:21:14] and
[1:21:14] to go back and just store up food how
[1:21:16] many knows that
[1:21:19] to store up food let me before i follow
[1:21:21] i even finish this quote and thought i
[1:21:23] want to bring that in
[1:21:24] because he says now what are we doing
[1:21:26] this morning trying to follow what the
[1:21:27] lord said
[1:21:28] lay up food you're going to need it one
[1:21:31] of these days so lay this
[1:21:33] food up how many believes that we need
[1:21:36] eat this food i mean it believes this
[1:21:38] food that god has stored for us in this
[1:21:40] end time
[1:21:41] is actually what's going to carry us
[1:21:43] through amen it's what's going to
[1:21:45] sustain us in this time of drought
[1:21:49] because we know the word of the lord is
[1:21:51] precious nowadays
[1:21:52] thus saith the lord is precious nowadays
[1:21:55] a preacher that
[1:21:57] really has something that's solid and
[1:21:58] not just something watered down or
[1:22:01] some good idea hello that's not what
[1:22:03] it's supposed to be it's supposed to be
[1:22:05] the word of the lord
[1:22:07] is that right amen and we have the word
[1:22:09] of the lord
[1:22:10] we have the saith the lord amen i
[1:22:13] believe that's what this message
[1:22:14] is what the bible is it's thus saith the
[1:22:16] lord so it's the food this morning we're
[1:22:18] going to
[1:22:18] feed on the food that god has given to
[1:22:21] us
[1:22:22] amen way back in the 50s and 60s because
[1:22:25] we are going to need it and we certainly
[1:22:27] need it this morning
[1:22:29] so let's eat amen and then what mama
[1:22:32] said
[1:22:33] sit down let's eat that's what we're
[1:22:36] going to say this morning
[1:22:37] let's eat praise the lord god bless you
[1:22:40] it's good to see all of y'all on the
[1:22:41] front row young folks
[1:22:42] god bless you amen all right
[1:22:45] that's the way that's where to be right
[1:22:47] on the front don't back back there
[1:22:48] somewhere you know especially in life
[1:22:50] and then serving the lord say right
[1:22:52] there
[1:22:52] serve the lord amen be stay close to him
[1:22:56] amen they pray the lord i know when i
[1:22:58] was
[1:22:59] young i did the same thing and if
[1:23:00] thoughts have never regretted
[1:23:02] great big greatest thing you'll ever do
[1:23:03] is serve the lord jesus christ
[1:23:06] so now listen now faith and wisdom to
[1:23:09] begin with we've noticed that in genesis
[1:23:11] the first chapter when it was in
[1:23:12] his faith was introduced and wisdom was
[1:23:15] also introduced
[1:23:16] i mean the first battle that ever took
[1:23:18] place
[1:23:19] took back took place in genesis and
[1:23:22] truly
[1:23:23] you and i know that we both realized
[1:23:25] that
[1:23:26] that we're in a battle right we're in a
[1:23:29] battle we're in a constant battle we're
[1:23:31] in a constant
[1:23:32] struggle right amen and we're battling
[1:23:36] the powers of evil
[1:23:38] amen and the battle of faith or the
[1:23:41] battle of doubt the battle of reasoning
[1:23:44] or the battle of
[1:23:45] uh wisdom and the battle of having faith
[1:23:47] and
[1:23:48] amen we're fighting a battle to preserve
[1:23:51] our life or
[1:23:52] we're fighting a battle to get behind
[1:23:54] something that'll
[1:23:55] protect us from the enemy and from even
[1:23:57] from death itself
[1:23:59] amen we want to get a hold of something
[1:24:01] that will give
[1:24:03] us joy something that will give us
[1:24:05] comfort
[1:24:06] something that'll give us peace because
[1:24:09] you don't have to live very long and you
[1:24:10] realize hey there's not a whole lot of
[1:24:12] peace out there there's not a lot of
[1:24:13] comfort out there
[1:24:16] amen as soon as you get the age
[1:24:17] accountability and so forth and
[1:24:19] boy i'll tell you what you do things
[1:24:20] wrong and that begin to build on and
[1:24:22] build on and the sin heaps up and
[1:24:24] you get tormented and people will drink
[1:24:25] and do drugs and
[1:24:27] get into everything and if you don't
[1:24:28] look out careful i mean you'll be
[1:24:30] swallowed up with the corruption that is
[1:24:32] in the world
[1:24:33] so we're looking at battling for we're
[1:24:36] battling for our life we're battling for
[1:24:38] deliverance to be delivered from the
[1:24:42] power of the enemy
[1:24:44] to be delivered from the pas the power
[1:24:46] of this flesh
[1:24:47] and the desires of this flesh
[1:24:51] amen and every that's the greatest
[1:24:53] battle
[1:24:54] is found of course there in genesis and
[1:24:56] i want you to i want you to know
[1:24:58] that that greatest weapon the devil had
[1:25:01] back there
[1:25:02] he is still using and the greatest
[1:25:05] weapon that god has
[1:25:06] he is still using and you have to use it
[1:25:09] this morning
[1:25:10] amen when blah blah blah preached my
[1:25:11] greatest about
[1:25:13] whatever thought he says it's an array
[1:25:15] amen it's set before us
[1:25:17] amen and if you just notice that the
[1:25:20] apostle paul i believe it says that
[1:25:21] we're to cast down imagination
[1:25:24] and what reasoning all right
[1:25:27] so let me let me let me let's talk about
[1:25:29] this wisdom first
[1:25:31] all right so now now we find that these
[1:25:34] two factions
[1:25:36] these sources one of them is wisdom and
[1:25:38] the other one faith
[1:25:40] and they've versed each other
[1:25:43] amen how many verses to be contrary one
[1:25:47] to another one versus the other one
[1:25:50] one fights the other one they're against
[1:25:52] each other it's either
[1:25:54] one or the other all right they have
[1:25:57] versed
[1:25:58] one another since creation in the garden
[1:26:02] of eden
[1:26:04] amen praise the lord now one of the
[1:26:06] first points that i want to make
[1:26:09] uh is that wisdom he says let's take
[1:26:13] wisdom first
[1:26:14] wisdom has
[1:26:18] reasoning that's what wisdom has
[1:26:21] satan's wisdom with eve
[1:26:25] he said you're going to be wise
[1:26:28] right but what he what did he do to give
[1:26:31] her
[1:26:31] this wisdom he used the instrument
[1:26:35] the knee
[1:26:39] and i believe that is the greatest
[1:26:40] weapon that the devil uses
[1:26:44] you know just like if you're sick well
[1:26:47] you know
[1:26:47] the devil will tell you well you know
[1:26:49] you you've prayed before
[1:26:51] you've believed before and you just
[1:26:52] stayed sick
[1:26:54] he will point you to a past failure he
[1:26:57] will use your mind
[1:26:59] you know and that's how he gets people
[1:27:01] is by using their mind and using their
[1:27:03] reasoning ability
[1:27:08] you know and all of us probably have
[1:27:10] heard the statement about
[1:27:12] well you can't reason with that guy
[1:27:17] there's no reasoning with that person
[1:27:22] you know in other words you're a barrier
[1:27:23] there and it just you won't get past
[1:27:25] there
[1:27:26] you can't get it in the head
[1:27:29] can't get through there's no reasoning
[1:27:31] with some people well the devil wants
[1:27:33] you to reason with him
[1:27:35] because remember natalie uh nelly i
[1:27:37] believe is nellie
[1:27:39] sanders i believe it was that got saved
[1:27:41] got baptism in the holy ghost and
[1:27:44] a day or two later she walked by that
[1:27:46] dance hall she used to go dancing with
[1:27:48] and
[1:27:48] her and her boyfriend and my boy they
[1:27:50] were just dancing stars
[1:27:53] and she stopped for a minute and
[1:27:54] listened for a minute
[1:27:56] and she said well maybe i can be a
[1:27:57] witness to them folks
[1:28:00] it was the devil using her reasoning and
[1:28:03] before she knew it she was out on the
[1:28:04] dance floor again
[1:28:06] amen and then she ran to brother bannon
[1:28:08] because she was so miserable she knew
[1:28:09] she had
[1:28:10] sinned amen and brother bannon began to
[1:28:12] pray and
[1:28:13] some wicked evil looking back kind of a
[1:28:16] devil come up
[1:28:16] behind or in that right when god brother
[1:28:19] ben prayed says devil you got to let her
[1:28:21] go
[1:28:22] is that right you don't realize that
[1:28:24] that
[1:28:25] that spirit that spirit of
[1:28:29] guilt and that horrible spirit or that
[1:28:32] feeling that you get sometimes if you
[1:28:34] uh sin against god that that's a
[1:28:36] horrible demon actually
[1:28:38] huh it takes the holy spirit to cast
[1:28:40] that thing out but she used reasoning
[1:28:43] the devil used her reasoning so
[1:28:44] we see the power of wisdom the power of
[1:28:47] wisdom is to bring reasoning into your
[1:28:49] mind
[1:28:50] the only way he'll convey to you his
[1:28:53] wisdom is through your reasoning
[1:28:57] now the second part if you remember
[1:28:59] faith bill bam says
[1:29:01] has no reasoning
[1:29:05] huh it has no reasoning
[1:29:09] it don't reason
[1:29:13] where would we i really don't know where
[1:29:16] we would be at and how it would be
[1:29:18] it's just a big tissue
[1:29:22] thought this morning where would we be
[1:29:24] at this morning if eve wouldn't have
[1:29:25] fell
[1:29:27] i would have been i don't exactly know
[1:29:31] the human creation would have never been
[1:29:32] in a following condition no right
[1:29:34] god would have never been a savior never
[1:29:36] been a redeemer never been a deliverer
[1:29:39] never right he allowed that he allowed
[1:29:42] leave to fall he knew she would
[1:29:44] he's not dumb he's not ignorant of
[1:29:46] anything
[1:29:47] he knew she would so that he could be a
[1:29:50] redeemer he could be a savior he could
[1:29:52] be a deliverer
[1:29:53] amen so he knew that she would reason
[1:29:56] now adam how many knows adam didn't
[1:29:58] reason
[1:30:00] nah devil he he didn't bother coming
[1:30:02] over talking to adam did he
[1:30:05] he probably did maybe he did a time or
[1:30:06] two but adam says you just get the
[1:30:08] behind me
[1:30:09] god has said period
[1:30:12] huh and he you know
[1:30:16] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:30:18] open up your mind to a little reasoning
[1:30:20] he'll come on in
[1:30:22] that's what he did with eve that was one
[1:30:24] of the first things he did
[1:30:26] was to bring his smarts his wisdom a
[1:30:28] little more understanding
[1:30:30] a greater life be smarter
[1:30:33] huh be smarter is what he tried to tell
[1:30:37] her
[1:30:37] that you're going to be smart you're not
[1:30:39] smart
[1:30:41] huh god never asked us to be smart
[1:30:45] over in first corinth against the first
[1:30:46] chapter remember he says that you know
[1:30:48] that god
[1:30:49] calls you know those who are nothing he
[1:30:51] calls
[1:30:52] the people that are not great men and so
[1:30:54] forth you know but this is simple people
[1:30:56] that's most of the time god who god
[1:30:57] calls
[1:30:58] hey you know if you're not smart you
[1:31:00] know you're not smart
[1:31:02] i tell folks i'm headed here to tell you
[1:31:04] you know once you recognize you're not
[1:31:06] as my person i'm not a smart person i
[1:31:08] need the lord to guide my mind
[1:31:11] amen i i gotta you know just about pray
[1:31:13] about anything anymore
[1:31:15] and i should just go have god's guidance
[1:31:17] like service this morning lord what do
[1:31:19] you want me to do
[1:31:20] and i felt the holy spirit say hey go
[1:31:22] ahead and have it
[1:31:24] amen the love of the devil would love
[1:31:28] for us not to have it at all that's what
[1:31:30] he'd like to have he'd love for us not
[1:31:32] to go to church at all
[1:31:33] amen but not god god wants us to come
[1:31:36] together and
[1:31:37] amen and assemble ourselves together and
[1:31:39] and praise the lord because
[1:31:40] you know of all things remember what
[1:31:42] we're here for this morning we make
[1:31:44] some of us made a long drive we make
[1:31:46] that sacrifice and that's for one
[1:31:47] purpose not because we have to but
[1:31:49] because
[1:31:49] we want to worship and praise our god
[1:31:54] i don't i don't know about you but i
[1:31:55] don't want ever i don't ever want
[1:31:57] worshipping the lord and praising god
[1:31:59] and
[1:31:59] amen and hallelujah i don't ever want
[1:32:01] that to get old to me
[1:32:03] because if it gets old to you here it'll
[1:32:06] probably get old to you over there
[1:32:08] remember it got old for the devil over
[1:32:11] there he got tired of it all
[1:32:13] he wanted something different that's
[1:32:15] what a lot of church folks do to come to
[1:32:17] church
[1:32:17] you know they come to church for a while
[1:32:19] but then they want something different
[1:32:20] they want something new it's not
[1:32:22] it gets old go ahead and go out there
[1:32:25] try it you're going to be disappointed
[1:32:26] this is the best thing that we can
[1:32:27] possibly do is worship the lord and
[1:32:29] serve him
[1:32:29] the rest of our days and all through
[1:32:31] eternity that's why man we'll sing
[1:32:33] that song praise god god praise god
[1:32:37] praise god praise god then we'll sing it
[1:32:38] some more well praise god praise god
[1:32:40] praise god
[1:32:41] and then we're going to sing it some
[1:32:42] more well i hope you don't get tired of
[1:32:44] praising god
[1:32:45] because that's what's going to happen
[1:32:47] over there amen
[1:32:49] okay kind of off my thought here but
[1:32:50] listen praise the lord so we realize
[1:32:53] that
[1:32:54] wisdom has reasoning faith don't
[1:32:57] have any reasoning
[1:33:00] praise be to god real genuine faith has
[1:33:03] no reasoning
[1:33:06] now what does faith do faith
[1:33:10] puts its complete rest and trust
[1:33:14] in the power of god in god's word
[1:33:18] god's word said it that's how it is that
[1:33:21] settles it
[1:33:23] do you realize that noah for 120 years
[1:33:28] would not reason because look at the
[1:33:32] size of that boat
[1:33:32] on top of that hill for 120 years if
[1:33:35] he'd allowed the devil to begin to say
[1:33:37] talk to him he just says it has never
[1:33:40] rained
[1:33:40] one day it's never rain it don't rain
[1:33:46] he says you know i think this is feudal
[1:33:48] i don't think this is ever going to rain
[1:33:50] if he'd
[1:33:50] one time if he'd have thought and begin
[1:33:53] to reason
[1:33:54] he'd acquit he'd quit the job that boat
[1:33:56] would have been half done
[1:34:00] huh
[1:34:03] same way with abraham but god says i'm
[1:34:06] going to make you a father of many
[1:34:07] nations isn't that right
[1:34:09] he didn't reason either he knew god was
[1:34:11] going to do it
[1:34:12] no matter how much he failed no matter
[1:34:14] how much sarah had him
[1:34:15] to speak with hagar this saturday
[1:34:19] abraham still knew he believed god and
[1:34:21] it was imputed unto him for
[1:34:23] righteousness
[1:34:24] and that right but when you begin to
[1:34:26] reason for 120 years noah did not reason
[1:34:29] with god and god's word and what
[1:34:31] happened the rain finally came
[1:34:33] it actually actually finally happened
[1:34:36] everybody else in town the newspaper of
[1:34:39] that data media
[1:34:41] and that right they had him a fool they
[1:34:44] had him a nut
[1:34:46] crazy man up on the hill beating away
[1:34:51] every day do you hear that hammer every
[1:34:54] day do you hear that song
[1:34:55] he's up there does it work in a way i
[1:34:59] never seen somebody go off his head that
[1:35:02] bad before
[1:35:03] that he'd build a boat up on top of the
[1:35:05] hill for 120 years
[1:35:09] huh noah never came out this pub and
[1:35:12] says now wait a minute folks i'm not
[1:35:14] quite sure if god told me to do this
[1:35:16] huh every time he come out i'm here to
[1:35:20] tell you folks it is going to rain
[1:35:24] it is going to flood the earth the only
[1:35:27] safe place the only place that you'll
[1:35:29] stay alive
[1:35:30] is in this here boat huh
[1:35:34] how many knows in this hour we've had
[1:35:35] the same thing
[1:35:37] man not in no church it ain't gonna be
[1:35:40] be safe anywhere you can won't be able
[1:35:42] to climb mount everest you won't be able
[1:35:44] to climb the biggest mountain it ain't
[1:35:45] gonna be safe
[1:35:46] no matter what hill you have to climb in
[1:35:48] no matter what church you belong to what
[1:35:50] denomination you belong to you ain't
[1:35:52] gonna be safe anywhere not even at the
[1:35:54] branham tabernacle you're not going to
[1:35:55] be safe there's only one place that
[1:35:57] you're safe
[1:35:58] and that is in jesus christ the holy
[1:36:01] ghost
[1:36:03] praise the lord only place of safety
[1:36:06] the only place that you're going to be
[1:36:09] safe from the wrath
[1:36:10] of almighty god in this generation it's
[1:36:12] in jesus christ
[1:36:14] and the devil comes to us he's come to
[1:36:17] us no doubt he'll come to you and
[1:36:19] make you wonder well i wonder if i'm
[1:36:20] gonna make the rapture i wonder if i'll
[1:36:24] be translated and he'll reason with you
[1:36:28] and he'll say look at your life look
[1:36:31] at what you're not what you ought to be
[1:36:33] huh
[1:36:34] anybody have problems like that sure but
[1:36:37] you know down in your soul
[1:36:40] that faith says i don't care devil i'm i
[1:36:43] believe i'm gonna be there
[1:36:44] god did not bring me safe this far just
[1:36:47] to lead me off here at the end
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:54] you look around and look at the cycle
[1:36:56] that the prophet of god said every
[1:36:57] church goes a church age goes through
[1:36:59] amen right every church age she had a
[1:37:04] revival
[1:37:05] and people were on hot and fire for god
[1:37:08] and praying all night and
[1:37:09] speaking in tongues and the methodists
[1:37:11] and the different ones shouted
[1:37:12] and then they'd have him some of them
[1:37:15] were called the shakers because they'd
[1:37:16] fall on the floor
[1:37:19] and just shake under the power of god
[1:37:20] and oh my you know they thought when
[1:37:22] they shook they had it
[1:37:23] oh mine and after a while they quit
[1:37:25] shaking
[1:37:27] after a while well well well hum drum
[1:37:31] after a while you know they couldn't
[1:37:33] have barely read their bible anymore and
[1:37:36] i just fizzed out
[1:37:39] that right faded out and it was called
[1:37:42] the cycle of death
[1:37:45] and man they all kind of just fade away
[1:37:48] and then we look at the message of the
[1:37:50] hour and look at the fading away that's
[1:37:51] happening
[1:37:52] look at the seal that people are losing
[1:37:54] look at the enthusiasm people don't have
[1:37:57] anymore huh
[1:38:02] then you can say then thomas byler says
[1:38:04] by the word of the lord and i be
[1:38:05] believed by the holy spirit
[1:38:07] look up you can't go much longer or
[1:38:10] everybody in the message should be dead
[1:38:12] but there'll be some i mean believe
[1:38:15] there'll be some
[1:38:16] that's still got the fire of god in the
[1:38:18] heart that loves the lord that looked
[1:38:20] for him to come
[1:38:22] one of these days
[1:38:26] i was thinking this morning you know you
[1:38:29] have about a 50 50
[1:38:30] chance of going into rapture 50 50.
[1:38:34] i thought well maybe that needs a good
[1:38:35] analysis because the bible says you know
[1:38:38] two will be one will be taken and when
[1:38:40] it will be left
[1:38:44] but you know you don't want to take a
[1:38:45] chance like that right you want to make
[1:38:47] sure that if there's two in the bed
[1:38:49] i'm ready to go i'm the one ready to go
[1:38:54] amen to be in the
[1:38:57] field wanna be taken one will be left
[1:39:01] it's if your heart is right with god or
[1:39:04] not
[1:39:05] amen all right let's go a little further
[1:39:10] amen talking about reasoning the power
[1:39:14] of reasoning
[1:39:15] the power of faith now remember this
[1:39:17] that god
[1:39:18] paul said here that i didn't come to you
[1:39:21] with
[1:39:21] excellency of speech using the wisdom of
[1:39:25] man
[1:39:26] and so forth but i come to you in power
[1:39:28] and demonstration of the holy ghost
[1:39:30] so that your faith would not rest in the
[1:39:33] wisdom of man
[1:39:35] but so that your faith would rest in
[1:39:38] what come on y'all
[1:39:41] the power of god the power
[1:39:44] of god we need amen corner who's going
[1:39:47] to volunteer that be my amen corner
[1:39:48] this morning
[1:39:55] resting in god's power
[1:39:59] not your power not my power
[1:40:02] not your ability not my ability
[1:40:07] but his ability
[1:40:10] no one ever he never trusted
[1:40:13] his own ability he could have never
[1:40:16] brought the rain down
[1:40:17] he could build the boat but he can't
[1:40:18] make it rain
[1:40:20] he knew that god would have to do it
[1:40:23] and god did it so we're supposed to live
[1:40:28] and have our faith and hope resting in
[1:40:31] the power of god in our life
[1:40:34] okay praise be to god and not to use
[1:40:39] our reasoning that's i'm going to tell
[1:40:40] you let me just say this
[1:40:44] i think this is more intricate and
[1:40:47] perhaps a little closer to each and
[1:40:49] every one of us
[1:40:50] than what we realize and i think every
[1:40:54] one of us ought to pray lord
[1:40:56] jesus help me to recognize when the
[1:40:59] devil is trying to use my reasoning
[1:41:03] all right reasoning is simply being able
[1:41:06] to reasons things out and that right
[1:41:07] being able to
[1:41:08] hey you know this or figures figure it
[1:41:10] out the reason
[1:41:12] animal kingdom don't have that power i
[1:41:14] mean but we do we can reason out and
[1:41:16] figure it out and think it out that's
[1:41:17] what the devil used on eve to try to
[1:41:20] emit bring it in such a way and bring a
[1:41:22] thought
[1:41:23] into her mind that was contrary to the
[1:41:26] word of god
[1:41:28] and remember this that satan's ambition
[1:41:30] according to isaiah the 14th chapter
[1:41:32] was i will be exalted above the most
[1:41:35] high i will
[1:41:36] exalt my throne above the stars of god
[1:41:38] in other words he's going to have
[1:41:40] his kingdom is going to be higher than
[1:41:42] the stars
[1:41:44] of god right there's the stars in other
[1:41:47] words he's going to come in
[1:41:48] and he's going to say now you know paul
[1:41:50] didn't really know what he was talking
[1:41:52] about you ain't got to really listen to
[1:41:53] the bible or what paul said here
[1:41:55] or any of his messengers had come and
[1:41:57] brought the word of god
[1:41:59] he would bring in reasoning and that's
[1:42:00] what he would use
[1:42:02] and he would have a word for each and
[1:42:04] every one of those folks
[1:42:05] amen that would contradict and anybody
[1:42:08] listen anybody that goes contrary
[1:42:10] to god stars god's messengers god's word
[1:42:13] is absolutely anointed by the devil
[1:42:17] and as soon as you or i take your
[1:42:20] reasoning remember this
[1:42:22] as soon as you take your reasoning over
[1:42:25] what god said
[1:42:26] the devil becomes your god and he's the
[1:42:29] one that you're serving
[1:42:31] amen just like catholicism we know
[1:42:34] because our loyalism you know they
[1:42:37] believe that
[1:42:38] they could forgive sins and we're going
[1:42:40] to have a booth over here and i need you
[1:42:41] to come and confess your sins
[1:42:43] and then i'm going to say your sins are
[1:42:44] forgiven you uh they think they have the
[1:42:46] power to forgive how many knows there's
[1:42:48] only one that has the power to forgive
[1:42:49] you
[1:42:50] many different things like that that
[1:42:52] they would do amen that they would
[1:42:53] pervert the word of god
[1:42:55] peter was their first pope peter wasn't
[1:42:57] the first pope
[1:42:59] no and but yet they make that paul and
[1:43:01] different ones you know
[1:43:02] and so forth they perverted and satan
[1:43:05] just
[1:43:07] let me just say this the wisdom of the
[1:43:09] devil
[1:43:10] is 99 true
[1:43:14] it's almost right and if he ever
[1:43:17] deceives any of us if he ever gets you
[1:43:19] to reason
[1:43:20] it'll be 99 percent
[1:43:24] right it's that other one percent
[1:43:28] when he came to eve he had 99 right
[1:43:31] all but one word just
[1:43:34] one word he got eve to disbelieve
[1:43:38] and that is that she shall not surely
[1:43:42] die
[1:43:43] amen just that not she thought
[1:43:47] god didn't mean what he says
[1:43:52] amen praise the lord
[1:43:56] all right
[1:44:08] what does faith do what is the christian
[1:44:12] principle first of all
[1:44:16] jesus said one place come unto me all
[1:44:19] he who are weary and heavy laden
[1:44:23] is that right and i will give you
[1:44:26] what rest
[1:44:30] i will give you rest
[1:44:34] amen and how do you get this
[1:44:37] into this rest through faith
[1:44:42] i wrote down here it's wisdom
[1:44:46] or faith it's rest
[1:44:50] or reason rest
[1:44:53] or reason because reasoning it'll take
[1:44:57] you away from god
[1:44:59] ultimately you'll be miserable it won't
[1:45:01] give you any kind of rest or comfort
[1:45:04] but real genuine faith in god
[1:45:08] gives you rest
[1:45:13] amen i know about you but rest is pretty
[1:45:14] precious nowadays
[1:45:18] it's a struggling world we're in a
[1:45:21] struggling world we're in a
[1:45:22] sick world we're in a dying world we're
[1:45:25] in a
[1:45:26] completely chaotic world
[1:45:29] but in the middle of all of that aren't
[1:45:32] you glad that you can actually
[1:45:33] come to a place that you rest and that
[1:45:36] rest
[1:45:37] is in that faith brings you to a rest
[1:45:40] in the power of god am i
[1:45:44] believe that you rest in the power of
[1:45:46] god
[1:45:48] once your faith is not standing in your
[1:45:50] wisdom
[1:45:51] then it's standing in the power of god
[1:45:54] let's take for example the three hebrew
[1:45:56] children
[1:46:00] how many would say did it wait upon the
[1:46:02] lord shall renew their strength
[1:46:05] amen they completely
[1:46:09] could have said man how are we going to
[1:46:11] get out of this
[1:46:12] when they were coming towards that fire
[1:46:16] when they were fixing to be burned
[1:46:20] amen what did they resident
[1:46:23] rest in how are we going to get out of
[1:46:25] this we better figure they didn't figure
[1:46:27] anything out
[1:46:29] they went bound hand and foot
[1:46:32] amen maybe there was chains on their
[1:46:34] feet maybe their hands were there
[1:46:36] just enough to be able to walk to go up
[1:46:38] there to be pushed over the edge
[1:46:41] into the fire they had faith in god
[1:46:44] didn't they
[1:46:45] and it bring a rest to where they did
[1:46:48] not have to worry
[1:46:50] about anything they rested in the power
[1:46:53] of god
[1:46:54] we this morning stand in the power of
[1:46:58] god
[1:47:00] through no matter what you go through i
[1:47:03] believe that's what the lord's telling
[1:47:04] us
[1:47:06] don't try to figure it out just rest in
[1:47:08] my power
[1:47:10] how many knows that's the one thing that
[1:47:12] god tried to get israel to do
[1:47:15] time after time after time
[1:47:20] yeah he did
[1:47:27] in hebrews the third chapter hebrew
[1:47:34] three
[1:47:37] and we'll begin with
[1:47:44] verse 15. while it is said today
[1:47:48] if you will hear his voice
[1:47:51] harden out your hearts as in the
[1:47:53] provocation
[1:47:55] for someone they had heard did provoke
[1:47:59] howbeit not all that came out of egypt
[1:48:01] by moses
[1:48:02] but with whom was he grieved 40 years
[1:48:05] was it not with them that sinned
[1:48:07] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:48:10] and to whoms were he that they should
[1:48:12] not enter into his rest
[1:48:14] but to them that believed not
[1:48:19] how many was israel was always
[1:48:22] relying on their reasoning why moses why
[1:48:27] did you bring us out here into this trap
[1:48:30] wasn't there enough graves in egypt
[1:48:33] always using their mind always thinking
[1:48:36] with their head
[1:48:38] how many notes that's what the devil
[1:48:39] uses is our head
[1:48:41] always trying to figure it out rather
[1:48:43] than just resting and standing in the
[1:48:45] power of god
[1:48:47] said look they should have said look but
[1:48:48] we don't understand why god would bring
[1:48:50] us down here
[1:48:51] between these big rocks down to this
[1:48:54] water
[1:48:54] and we can't even retreat we can't go
[1:48:56] nowhere we can't turn right left
[1:48:59] can't go forward and here we hear them
[1:49:01] coming and moses don't know what to do
[1:49:04] my lord as we might say
[1:49:07] have we got ourselves in the pickle
[1:49:11] and they can begin to what complain
[1:49:14] the devil begin to use their mind and i
[1:49:16] want you to know that's what god does
[1:49:17] for every one of his children and i want
[1:49:19] to show you by the prophet of god that
[1:49:21] god is trying to get that out of his
[1:49:23] people
[1:49:26] that you don't use your own thinking
[1:49:29] you only rely on one thing and that is
[1:49:31] the power of god
[1:49:33] the word of god they would complain
[1:49:36] why was he grieved with them why did he
[1:49:39] swear you're not gonna end his rest
[1:49:40] because they did not have
[1:49:42] faith because faith is what actually
[1:49:46] brings you
[1:49:47] the power of god and causes you to rest
[1:49:50] now notice
[1:49:51] so we see that they could not enter in
[1:49:54] because of unbelief
[1:49:55] chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore fear
[1:49:58] least a promise of being left at least a
[1:50:01] promise being left
[1:50:03] us of entering into his rest
[1:50:06] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:50:09] it
[1:50:10] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[1:50:12] well as unto them
[1:50:13] but the word preached did not profit
[1:50:15] them not being mixed with
[1:50:18] faith in them that heard it
[1:50:21] praise the lord it is absolutely
[1:50:26] amazing how that god can
[1:50:29] absolutely save a soul change your
[1:50:32] nature
[1:50:32] fill you with the holy ghost simply by
[1:50:35] what you are able to
[1:50:37] hear it am i right
[1:50:40] they heard the gospel they heard moses
[1:50:42] there they hold that but there was no
[1:50:44] faith
[1:50:44] mixed in it they didn't believe it and
[1:50:47] we know you don't just hear
[1:50:48] or understand with your mind but you
[1:50:50] hear with your heart
[1:50:53] and god speaks us not only through the
[1:50:55] pastor and the preachers but he speaks
[1:50:57] to you
[1:50:58] when you're driving down the road when
[1:50:59] you're listening to a tape when you're
[1:51:01] reading your bible god speaks to your
[1:51:03] heart
[1:51:04] you know right and when you hear that
[1:51:07] voice don't harden your heart
[1:51:10] but let it be soft let god tell you what
[1:51:13] he's trying to tell you
[1:51:15] israel didn't do that for time after
[1:51:17] time again
[1:51:18] now right time and time again they
[1:51:21] didn't do it
[1:51:23] for we which have believed do enter into
[1:51:26] rest
[1:51:27] as he saith amen as he has said
[1:51:30] verse 9 of the same chapter chapter 4
[1:51:33] says
[1:51:34] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[1:51:36] people of god
[1:51:38] for he that is entered into his rest he
[1:51:40] has also ceased from his
[1:51:42] own works as god did from his
[1:51:46] praise be to god but makes a statement
[1:51:49] he says you know i find around most
[1:51:51] christian lives he says i mostly hate to
[1:51:53] say this
[1:51:54] but it's true that most people can that
[1:51:56] profess to be christians
[1:51:58] they seem to have such a hard time
[1:52:00] holding on
[1:52:02] i believe it's because of a lack of
[1:52:04] correct teaching of the bible
[1:52:05] no such a thing as holding on he done
[1:52:07] the holding on
[1:52:08] the whole christian principle is based
[1:52:11] upon the rest
[1:52:12] come unto me all ye who are weary and
[1:52:14] heavy lady now i will
[1:52:16] give you rest
[1:52:20] praise be to god how many of those three
[1:52:23] were children even though they were
[1:52:24] going to the fiery furnace they could
[1:52:26] have
[1:52:26] arrests we're not trusting in our
[1:52:30] masculinity and our power and our
[1:52:32] strength
[1:52:34] we're resting in the ability that god
[1:52:36] has god's ability
[1:52:39] daniel the same way he didn't rest in
[1:52:41] his own ability or able to figure it out
[1:52:44] he rested in the power of god and god
[1:52:47] come on the scene
[1:52:49] amen daniel in the lion's den
[1:52:53] he didn't rest upon his vulnerability
[1:52:57] israel amen
[1:53:00] what was it joshua and caleb amen
[1:53:05] i wonder why you don't hear more hey
[1:53:08] brother nathan how you doing
[1:53:10] hey brother cora how you doing
[1:53:14] you don't hear a lot of dating core
[1:53:15] names do you nobody wants to name their
[1:53:18] kid after
[1:53:18] somebody like that but we hear a lot of
[1:53:21] davidson
[1:53:22] joshuas and caleb's isn't that right
[1:53:26] daniels huh
[1:53:31] peters pauls
[1:53:35] amen micas
[1:53:38] all of these great names because they
[1:53:40] had faith in god they didn't
[1:53:42] rely on their ability or their knowledge
[1:53:45] or their wisdom
[1:53:48] because caleb and not caleb and yahweh
[1:53:50] was caleb and
[1:53:52] joshua and caleb came back from
[1:53:56] spying out the lands and all those other
[1:53:58] ten
[1:53:59] spies that went over there brought back
[1:54:01] a report
[1:54:02] no we are not they have walls they have
[1:54:06] chariot races on top of their
[1:54:08] walls
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:11] ain't no way we're ever going to get
[1:54:13] defeat defeat that weakness i'll tell
[1:54:15] you why
[1:54:16] i had to hide behind a mulberry tree in
[1:54:19] a big old oak cause man i'll tell you
[1:54:21] what when them
[1:54:22] giants come stomping through there it
[1:54:23] was a scary thing
[1:54:26] they have giants in the land huh
[1:54:29] they come back whimpering and crying and
[1:54:32] moses even cried to the lord one time
[1:54:34] god
[1:54:34] here i am he's in god why do you cry to
[1:54:36] me moses quit your crying you cry baby
[1:54:42] amen speak the word and go forward
[1:54:46] joshua and caleb they came back and they
[1:54:48] had all these grapes and they had to
[1:54:49] have an
[1:54:50] audience they had to get up on the
[1:54:52] pulpit so to speak and the platform says
[1:54:54] calm down y'all what is wrong with y'all
[1:54:56] calm down
[1:54:57] calm down he says we are more than
[1:55:01] able to take the land why because you're
[1:55:04] not
[1:55:04] i'm not releasing on all of y'all short
[1:55:06] little guys
[1:55:07] most of israelites and jews a lot of
[1:55:09] them are short little fellas they aren't
[1:55:11] big great big people
[1:55:12] we're not relying on our ability we're
[1:55:14] relying on the one that brought us safe
[1:55:16] this far
[1:55:17] they had a positive god loved them too
[1:55:20] there were only two originals that went
[1:55:22] into the promised land because they
[1:55:23] could believe that they could do it
[1:55:25] amen that's the way i believe the
[1:55:26] message of the hour god is bringing
[1:55:28] brought us a message that
[1:55:29] amen the bride is going to be ready for
[1:55:31] the rapture and i believe that that is
[1:55:33] absolutely the truth
[1:55:35] there'll be a group of people that have
[1:55:37] eaten of the good food that god has
[1:55:39] provided for us in this day it will make
[1:55:41] them what they're supposed to be
[1:55:42] it isn't a bunch of hot dogs and a bunch
[1:55:44] of poison
[1:55:46] it's some good meat it's some good food
[1:55:49] that's gonna sustain you
[1:55:51] gonna get us ready for this rapture
[1:55:53] don't you believe that
[1:55:54] and this is one of them this one this is
[1:55:56] part of the food
[1:55:57] amen that is that you don't rest on your
[1:56:00] own abilities you rest in the power of
[1:56:02] god
[1:56:02] absolutely no matter what comes life or
[1:56:05] death you have got to rest in the power
[1:56:09] of god as you get older
[1:56:13] your body gets weaker hey man you used
[1:56:16] to be able to lift 200 pounds 300 pounds
[1:56:19] now you do good to lift 25 pounds
[1:56:24] it'll be good did you be able to lift
[1:56:26] five
[1:56:27] pound weights after a while maybe three
[1:56:30] pound weights
[1:56:31] i mean then you'll get sick you'll get
[1:56:32] so weak you'll be doing good to be able
[1:56:34] to raise your arm up
[1:56:36] in that deathbed you'll be so weak so
[1:56:39] weak
[1:56:41] amen and that's when you're going to
[1:56:42] have to rely on the power of god
[1:56:45] amen how many believes that as you get
[1:56:47] older we lose our strength
[1:56:50] you get weaker all the time amen
[1:56:54] but what we need is the holy ghost
[1:56:57] amen that's right you can take all the
[1:56:59] vitamins you want
[1:57:01] you can take all the black juice or
[1:57:02] whatever it is you want to drink you're
[1:57:04] still going to keep on getting weaker
[1:57:06] the only thing that i know of that'll
[1:57:08] really perk you up amen it's the word of
[1:57:10] god
[1:57:11] i am el shetty i the breasted one and
[1:57:14] that right you all remember the story of
[1:57:15] the pentecostal that came up in the
[1:57:17] pulpit
[1:57:17] he was about 80 some years old and
[1:57:19] couldn't barely get up the steps you
[1:57:20] know and
[1:57:21] it had him to come up to preach a little
[1:57:22] bit he got up there and he talked about
[1:57:24] the rainbow and so forth and the
[1:57:26] covenant of almighty god and
[1:57:28] amen the stars that shot up for joy he
[1:57:31] jumped up in the air
[1:57:32] clicked this hill together you ain't got
[1:57:34] enough room up here for me to preach
[1:57:37] i'm that quickly power make you alive
[1:57:39] again
[1:57:40] the power of god isn't there right you
[1:57:43] may think you have power but folks i'm
[1:57:45] telling you all of our power will fail
[1:57:47] one of these days
[1:57:48] and we want our our power to be gone now
[1:57:51] i'm not resting on my power
[1:57:53] or my ability let me just talk to you
[1:57:56] about something else and you'll hear
[1:57:57] this and know this
[1:57:58] through the prophet's message that the
[1:58:00] the moabites were relative
[1:58:02] to abraham is that right there were lots
[1:58:04] kids
[1:58:05] and they were moabites and they did the
[1:58:06] same church they had the same church
[1:58:08] they had the same preachers they had the
[1:58:09] same deacons they had the same
[1:58:11] set up they had the same god they had
[1:58:12] the same everything but they were carnal
[1:58:15] everything was by carnality isn't that
[1:58:18] right
[1:58:18] only the israelites they were the ones
[1:58:20] that were spiritual
[1:58:22] they followed the pillar of fire they
[1:58:23] had the holy ghost among them
[1:58:25] everybody else just did it as a ritual
[1:58:28] and the prophet taught us that
[1:58:29] it goes on all the way to the end you
[1:58:33] always have twins you always have those
[1:58:35] that rely upon their wisdom
[1:58:37] upon what they do naturally or
[1:58:39] politically or
[1:58:40] physically they can do and the others
[1:58:43] rely upon god
[1:58:45] there's a church spiritual and there is
[1:58:47] a church carnal
[1:58:49] amen the carnal relies on what they can
[1:58:52] do
[1:58:53] the spiritual totally relies upon god
[1:58:57] amen praise the lord
[1:59:04] scripture says in psalms there is no
[1:59:06] king saved by a multitude of and hosts
[1:59:09] a mighty man is not delivered by much
[1:59:11] strength
[1:59:13] amen how many know samson when he looked
[1:59:15] at those big steel gates she knew that
[1:59:17] he was no match for those steel gates
[1:59:19] if he'd begin to reason he wouldn't have
[1:59:21] backed up to him
[1:59:23] huh he wouldn't have backed up to them
[1:59:25] gates grabbed the hole a few of them
[1:59:27] bars and
[1:59:28] pulled the things right out of the
[1:59:29] ground and it says he went up and
[1:59:32] running up on the hill and threw it off
[1:59:35] he didn't reason about whether he could
[1:59:37] or not
[1:59:38] he just did it huh
[1:59:42] moses didn't rely on his ability his
[1:59:44] smarts when he went down into egypt
[1:59:47] and that right in his wisdom to go down
[1:59:49] there he just said god said let my
[1:59:51] people go
[1:59:54] oh my the king of egypt pharaoh he was
[1:59:57] he is his intellect he looked at all of
[2:00:01] the hosts and his army and
[2:00:03] you and what army is coming to set off
[2:00:06] all these
[2:00:06] uh these israelites free is that right
[2:00:10] but even pharaoh after a while wanted to
[2:00:13] reason with
[2:00:14] moses he wanted to reason with him he
[2:00:16] says you know what why don't you
[2:00:18] the man why don't you just some of y'all
[2:00:20] go out there in the mountains and so
[2:00:21] forth and worship your god
[2:00:22] amen but leave your chill into all of it
[2:00:24] leave them all here and then come back
[2:00:27] he tried to reason with him what did
[2:00:29] moses do he was
[2:00:30] he was not a reasonable man why because
[2:00:33] he uh
[2:00:34] had faith faith don't reason
[2:00:38] moses said sorry no deal that's what eve
[2:00:41] should have said no deal
[2:00:43] devil i don't want any of your fruit i
[2:00:45] don't want any of your smarts
[2:00:47] i don't want to get any smarter
[2:00:50] amen my if you'll read and
[2:00:54] listen to that hey wisdom versus faith i
[2:00:57] believe it is there
[2:01:00] better not say that let me see here
[2:01:01] where we're at
[2:01:04] all right no i believe it's perfect
[2:01:08] strength by perfect weakness i believe
[2:01:11] where he talks about uh
[2:01:16] he said look around today at all of our
[2:01:18] great achievements that we think we've
[2:01:20] done
[2:01:21] and where is christianity in the united
[2:01:23] states look at our churches
[2:01:25] and our denominations that's what the
[2:01:28] prophet god said
[2:01:30] our evangelists and our healing
[2:01:32] campaigns and everything else we've had
[2:01:34] what is it
[2:01:35] it's worse not than it was at the
[2:01:37] beginning
[2:01:38] but we can sure say that nowadays can't
[2:01:40] we amen he could say it back then but
[2:01:43] look at where it is today
[2:01:46] my even the letting homosexuals coming
[2:01:48] on in
[2:01:50] the women cut their hair wear makeup
[2:01:53] wear men's clothes every old way you
[2:01:55] think that's what god's going to take
[2:01:57] to heaven with i don't think so he
[2:02:00] demands holiness without holiness no man
[2:02:02] shall see god
[2:02:03] amen praise the lord
[2:02:07] now notice so brother ben makes a
[2:02:09] statement listen no ability i don't care
[2:02:11] whose it is will ever be usable
[2:02:13] in the sight of god as long as you think
[2:02:16] you can do something you better be
[2:02:18] careful
[2:02:20] you better just rely on god you better
[2:02:21] get on your prayer bones and say god
[2:02:24] what is it that you want me to do i have
[2:02:25] nobility of myself
[2:02:28] god has to get all of our abilities out
[2:02:30] of us before he can ever
[2:02:31] achieve his purpose if he's got
[2:02:33] something for us to do
[2:02:35] but as long as we feel we can do it then
[2:02:38] god can never use that
[2:02:40] that's where he talked about look around
[2:02:42] look at all the churches look at
[2:02:43] all those folks trying to do now i want
[2:02:46] to tell you something there was one man
[2:02:48] that was surrendered to the will of god
[2:02:49] in this generation
[2:02:51] brother branham he was surrendered to
[2:02:54] almighty god
[2:02:55] he come up here and he says now you know
[2:02:56] i can't do nothing i can't tell you who
[2:02:58] you're from
[2:02:59] what your name is or i can't help you
[2:03:00] i'm waiting on him
[2:03:03] he'd always have to wait on him and when
[2:03:06] he would come
[2:03:08] huh it would all be different that's why
[2:03:11] people would drive 1500 miles 2
[2:03:14] 000 miles in one weekend people would
[2:03:16] drive 1500 miles
[2:03:18] just to get to one service or two and
[2:03:20] drive all the way back home
[2:03:22] because they didn't just hear a man
[2:03:24] talking but they seen the power
[2:03:26] of god manifested amen
[2:03:32] the dead dropped over my brother right
[2:03:35] here i believe was right behind the man
[2:03:36] that was dropped dead
[2:03:38] probably god went down and prayed for
[2:03:39] him and he got back up
[2:03:45] that's the power of god we don't rest on
[2:03:48] our ability we're resting on the power
[2:03:49] that's what i want for my life don't you
[2:03:50] want that for yours lord that's what i
[2:03:52] want i want to realize completely
[2:03:54] the power of god i don't want any
[2:03:56] ability of us i don't want any of me
[2:03:59] in god's way
[2:04:03] amen
[2:04:06] praise the lord he talked about the long
[2:04:10] prayers they made
[2:04:11] catholic and protestant would get
[2:04:13] together say some prayers
[2:04:15] he says he says he might as well not
[2:04:16] done it what it takes
[2:04:18] is a surrender life to god i mean that's
[2:04:21] exactly what daniel
[2:04:22] that's what david that's what what the
[2:04:24] three hebrew truth that's what they did
[2:04:26] they were
[2:04:28] surrendered completely to god
[2:04:33] that's what god kept trying to get
[2:04:35] israel to do was
[2:04:36] to surrender to him because it's not
[2:04:40] about what we do it's about what god
[2:04:41] does
[2:04:43] amen jehoshaphat remember
[2:04:47] when the armies was coming up again
[2:04:49] surrounded him and he had no chance
[2:04:51] he went to prayer and believed in god
[2:04:54] and he didn't even have to fight the
[2:04:55] battle
[2:04:56] god fought the battle for him that's the
[2:04:59] way it is with us
[2:05:00] don't you want to see that more of that
[2:05:01] in your life and say god when i come up
[2:05:03] against the situation
[2:05:04] i want to see you handle the battle
[2:05:08] praise the lord
[2:05:11] amen i know brother john
[2:05:14] he's listening this morning he gave me a
[2:05:16] testimony of how he surrendered
[2:05:18] something to god and god turned the
[2:05:19] whole thing around and blessed it
[2:05:21] said god it's your father maybe
[2:05:23] sometimes he'll give a testimony of it
[2:05:25] that's what i like to hear when people
[2:05:27] surrender their problems and
[2:05:30] their things to god and see god come on
[2:05:32] the scene that's what paul was saying
[2:05:33] look don't
[2:05:34] rest upon your wisdom or your ability
[2:05:36] but just rest in the power of almighty
[2:05:38] god
[2:05:40] now i believe it's more relevant now
[2:05:42] than ever don't you
[2:05:43] that we rest with what we don't know
[2:05:45] what the future holds
[2:05:46] the world crumbling hey it's time to
[2:05:48] rest more on the power of god
[2:05:50] if we get out of here it won't be
[2:05:52] because if you're
[2:05:54] figuring it out it'll be because of the
[2:05:56] power of god that you trust in
[2:05:58] that you live by amen
[2:06:02] all right perfect strength by perfect
[2:06:04] weakness
[2:06:06] amen listen what could it do it didn't
[2:06:08] do any good all of those things
[2:06:10] look at the condition of the world
[2:06:14] and it'll never be until every person
[2:06:16] that professes to be a christian
[2:06:19] will forget his own ability and yield
[2:06:23] himself to god
[2:06:27] you know you really don't know how to
[2:06:28] run your life how many know you don't
[2:06:30] really know how to run your life god is
[2:06:32] the one that is supposed to run your
[2:06:33] life
[2:06:35] he's the one that's supposed to work
[2:06:37] miracles and do the great things that
[2:06:39] need to be done not you
[2:06:41] he wants us surrendered to him
[2:06:47] life or death surrender to almighty god
[2:06:51] listen never
[2:06:55] until every person that professes to be
[2:06:56] a christian
[2:06:58] amen oh my i truly believe this is
[2:07:02] the material the bride is going to be
[2:07:03] made out of
[2:07:05] that she's not going to rest in anything
[2:07:08] outside of god in his power
[2:07:10] not of your own ability what you can do
[2:07:14] then god can achieve his pur purpose by
[2:07:17] sending not a revival but brother what
[2:07:19] he needs to do is send a real
[2:07:21] killing first amen
[2:07:24] so that we can revive you have to die
[2:07:27] before you can be born again
[2:07:30] let me just say this if you want more of
[2:07:33] god
[2:07:34] then you're going to have to die more to
[2:07:36] yourself
[2:07:37] how many beliefs there's more of god to
[2:07:39] be had
[2:07:43] there's more of god to be had there's
[2:07:45] more of the holy ghost to be had
[2:07:47] but you ain't gonna get it one bit not
[2:07:50] even a little bit
[2:07:51] until you are willing to die a little
[2:07:52] more to yourself
[2:07:55] well brother butler i don't think i'm a
[2:07:57] pretty good there you go you're
[2:07:58] a rotten person already if you think
[2:07:59] you're a pretty good person if you
[2:08:01] really
[2:08:02] have much of the holy spirit you realize
[2:08:04] that you're not what you ought to be
[2:08:07] huh
[2:08:10] praise be to god and the holy spirit
[2:08:13] will show
[2:08:14] each and every one of us those areas
[2:08:17] where you can die a little more how many
[2:08:20] is with me so lord here i am
[2:08:22] show me that area of my life
[2:08:25] that i need to die to myself a little
[2:08:27] more so that you can live
[2:08:29] so that i can see your power in my life
[2:08:32] not my power not what i can do but what
[2:08:34] you can do this
[2:08:36] church ought to be full of testimonies
[2:08:38] of metabolism this is what god did for
[2:08:40] me
[2:08:40] i trusted him and i asked him for this
[2:08:42] and this is what god did for me
[2:08:44] this is this is what we want to hear
[2:08:48] huh
[2:08:53] my am i lord help us
[2:08:59] that's right we need a killing of
[2:09:00] ourselves the prophet of god said if
[2:09:02] he said that back then he says this
[2:09:04] tabernacle
[2:09:06] he was at the tabernacle this tabernacle
[2:09:08] needs a killing
[2:09:10] and me with it hallelujah
[2:09:13] all of us we need a killing so that we
[2:09:15] can be revived in new life
[2:09:18] a new hope a new hold
[2:09:21] a new experience we need first
[2:09:24] a day of mourning listen we've got to
[2:09:28] get away from that that human ability we
[2:09:29] got to get to a place
[2:09:31] where we are surrendered our soul our
[2:09:34] lives
[2:09:35] even to the housewife the farmer the
[2:09:38] mechanic
[2:09:38] or whoever you are
[2:09:42] we got to surrender completely to god
[2:09:45] and know that we are nothing and let god
[2:09:48] start from there remember
[2:09:52] he that is entered into his rest he also
[2:09:56] has ceased from his own works
[2:09:58] as god did from his let us labor
[2:10:01] therefore
[2:10:03] let's struggle then let's struggle and
[2:10:07] paddle
[2:10:08] until we get to this place of rest is
[2:10:10] that right
[2:10:12] let us labor therefore enter into that
[2:10:15] rest at least any man falls after the
[2:10:18] same
[2:10:19] example of unbelief
[2:10:24] how many knows that this listen
[2:10:28] all right i'm gonna
[2:10:34] tell you a story here in closing
[2:10:38] brother bam said that he was
[2:10:41] reading about paul raider you all
[2:10:44] remember paul raider
[2:10:46] the story of him and him i don't
[2:10:47] remember paul rayder but i remember the
[2:10:49] story of him
[2:10:50] he preached divine healing he not only
[2:10:53] preached it but he practiced it
[2:10:57] listen he says
[2:11:02] let me see here
[2:11:06] he was over in some other country over
[2:11:08] there doing missionary work
[2:11:11] and he took some kind of a fever black
[2:11:12] water fever or yellow fever or something
[2:11:15] and it rose so high in him until he
[2:11:17] began to come unconscious
[2:11:19] and he said to his wife don't leave me
[2:11:20] stay by my side pray for me
[2:11:22] and she kept praying and he went into a
[2:11:24] coma
[2:11:26] notice and he says that he was
[2:11:29] unconscious he went unconscious and when
[2:11:31] he did he dreamed
[2:11:32] through his back in his woods as a
[2:11:35] logger again because that's what he used
[2:11:36] to do
[2:11:37] cutting timber and he cut a big log his
[2:11:41] paw said send him up on the hill to cut
[2:11:42] this log and bring it back
[2:11:45] and he struck his axe in that soft
[2:11:47] timber on the evergreen and started to
[2:11:48] pick it up and he just couldn't pick it
[2:11:50] up
[2:11:51] it was just too much for him
[2:11:55] and he said well why would the boss ask
[2:11:56] me to cut this log if
[2:11:58] if i couldn't pick it up and he says if
[2:12:01] you get a symbol of it god will never
[2:12:03] give you something that because grace
[2:12:04] won't give you the power to do
[2:12:06] that's right he will never promise
[2:12:09] something in here but but he will
[2:12:10] fulfill it
[2:12:11] he's tried to pick it up and he couldn't
[2:12:13] he says he just wore himself
[2:12:14] out tugging at it
[2:12:18] that's what's the matter with the church
[2:12:19] denominations what they've done
[2:12:21] they have wore their self out tugging at
[2:12:25] this and
[2:12:26] tugging at that trying to do this just
[2:12:29] turn
[2:12:30] loose let god do it that's the thing to
[2:12:32] do
[2:12:33] listen to this this is very good
[2:12:36] just let god do it it's too much for you
[2:12:38] anyhow
[2:12:40] god's let men run to their limit right
[2:12:43] now
[2:12:44] god let men go and have this world
[2:12:48] he let them prove to themselves that
[2:12:51] they can't run
[2:12:52] this world
[2:12:56] come on folks a amen
[2:13:01] he has allowed people to get to the
[2:13:03] place to where they realize
[2:13:05] they can't run this
[2:13:08] world amen
[2:13:12] all the governments they can't run a
[2:13:15] thing
[2:13:16] they try dictatorship it don't work
[2:13:19] nothing works
[2:13:26] god with his mighty hands shows this
[2:13:28] world cannot stand that's right
[2:13:30] god rules the world he will rule it
[2:13:31] through jesus christ
[2:13:33] but now man wanted to rule it and you
[2:13:35] see what chaos he's got it in
[2:13:38] that's what he's got it in every time
[2:13:41] that's what he got in before the
[2:13:42] andalubian destruction
[2:13:44] and so forth and when the signs were
[2:13:46] given and that's what he's got that kind
[2:13:48] of condition before the first coming of
[2:13:49] christ
[2:13:50] and you see what happens to sign the
[2:13:52] pure and it's not a third time that's
[2:13:54] the last time the ending of all things
[2:13:57] but anyway he says paul
[2:13:59] he paul raider again he going back to
[2:14:02] the story he said he paul said
[2:14:03] he talked at it he just didn't know what
[2:14:06] to do he sat down
[2:14:07] on a tree and started crying oh i can't
[2:14:10] pick it up i have lost
[2:14:12] my strength so he heard a voice speak
[2:14:16] he says and he heard his boss his voice
[2:14:18] speak with a
[2:14:19] kind voice and said paul i said what are
[2:14:22] you struggling at it for
[2:14:24] why do you not just throw it over in the
[2:14:28] water
[2:14:30] cast all your cares upon him for he
[2:14:33] cares for you
[2:14:35] amen come unto me all you are weary and
[2:14:38] heavy laden
[2:14:39] i will give you rest how many thankful
[2:14:42] for that rest
[2:14:43] i'll tell you what aren't you glad that
[2:14:45] no matter what the future holds no
[2:14:47] matter what happens
[2:14:49] you can rest in christ and you can know
[2:14:52] that you're right with god
[2:14:54] that you're ready to meet him if he was
[2:14:56] to take you home before you got home
[2:14:59] want to rest you don't have to struggle
[2:15:01] and fight
[2:15:02] daniel didn't have to fight and struggle
[2:15:04] he just had to walk
[2:15:05] got to carry the rest moses he just had
[2:15:08] to say what god said
[2:15:09] god took care of the rest am i right
[2:15:13] no oh my
[2:15:16] throw it over in the water and the water
[2:15:18] the water runs right down by the camp
[2:15:21] so he looked up and his boss was the
[2:15:23] lord jesus
[2:15:24] so he just took that big old log and
[2:15:26] pushed it over in the water
[2:15:27] jumped the straddle of them and began to
[2:15:29] splash the water
[2:15:31] right and right down the river
