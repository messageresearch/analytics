[19:27] just

[19:32] uh
[19:33] everybody want to turn to hebrews
[19:35] chapter four
[19:51] brother brad you wanna pray
[20:12] um
[20:29] we'll do
[20:31] verses 7 through 16
[20:33] again he limiteth a certain day saying
[20:36] in david today after so long time as it
[20:39] is said today if you will hear his voice
[20:42] and hard not your hearts
[20:52] they're remaining there for a rest of
[20:54] the people of god
[21:02] let us labor therefore to enter into the
[21:04] rest unless any man fall
[21:07] after the same example of unbelief
[21:25] neither is there any creature that is
[21:27] not manifest in his sight but all things
[21:30] are naked and open unto the eyes of him
[21:33] with whom we have to do
[21:46] we have none in high priest which cannot
[21:48] be touched with the feeling of our
[21:50] infirmities but was in all points
[21:52] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[21:56] let us therefore come boldly into the
[21:59] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[22:06] amen
[22:09] brother brian
[22:22] morning brothers and sisters
[22:24] i promise not to fall over
[22:27] i if you would come with me to
[22:30] prom
[22:31] verse the 22nd chapter
[22:34] you know there's a lot of nuggets in
[22:36] that fourth chapter of hebrews
[22:38] i
[22:39] would hope all of us are rested in in
[22:42] christ
[22:43] you've ceased from all your labors in a
[22:45] spiritual sense and have found rest in
[22:47] jesus christ this morning
[22:49] you know and people would ask you uh
[22:51] does christ mean more to you this
[22:53] morning
[22:54] than he did yesterday
[22:56] are you closer to him today than you
[22:58] were yesterday
[23:00] guys brother brown i mean brother thomas
[23:03] has
[23:04] been preaching the last couple of
[23:05] sundays and wednesdays you know as this
[23:08] world gets crazier and crazier
[23:12] are you getting closer and closer and
[23:14] closer you know i was just i wrote some
[23:16] notes down this morning
[23:24] but i'll just read a few of these
[23:26] scriptures here in proverbs 22nd chapter
[23:28] i know i say it a lot but
[23:30] you know
[23:32] you could start you got 31 chapters here
[23:34] you could read one of these every day of
[23:36] your life every month of the year
[23:38] in like a you know this
[23:41] four maybe
[23:42] not quite 4 000 years ago and
[23:45] the truths that are in proverbs haven't
[23:47] changed people are still people they're
[23:49] the same no matter where you go
[23:51] if if they're not saved and full of the
[23:54] holy ghost in the presence of christ and
[23:55] the hearts and lives they're going to
[23:57] just be people they're going to do
[23:58] things that people do that doesn't make
[24:01] excuse for bad behavior but
[24:03] they can't help who they are sometimes
[24:05] but let me um read the first couple of
[24:07] these first so if you expect more out of
[24:09] people
[24:10] than you do out of yourself then you're
[24:12] wrong to start with i don't know why i
[24:14] just said that a good name is rather to
[24:17] be chosen than great riches
[24:19] and loving favor favor rather than
[24:22] silver and gold that's a real important
[24:24] principle
[24:25] the rich and poor meet together and the
[24:27] lord is the maker of them all so you
[24:30] know
[24:31] humility is an important thing for a
[24:32] christian spirit but humility is an
[24:35] important spirit whether you're a
[24:36] christian or not not thinking of
[24:38] yourself more than what you really are
[24:41] in life that's really important because
[24:43] if you go outside of that
[24:45] foundation where you know that
[24:47] you have limitations other people have
[24:49] limitations and that you can meet
[24:51] together you know and common ground
[24:54] you'll never get along with everyone
[24:56] you'll it's just i mean it's the truth
[24:58] of life it goes on to say here a prudent
[25:01] man foreseeth evil
[25:03] and hides as himself but a simple
[25:06] pass on and uh punished
[25:08] you know i look at
[25:10] a statement like that
[25:11] and i it goes on and talks about it the
[25:14] worst
[25:15] thing is for an evil man that knows he
[25:18] should correct someone and lets him die
[25:20] or have a
[25:22] this favor in his father that's even far
[25:24] worse and it goes on to say here
[25:27] humility and the fear of the lord are
[25:29] riches and honor in life that solomon is
[25:32] teaching his children he's teaching us
[25:34] and all the people thousands of years
[25:36] later
[25:37] that everything is based upon a
[25:38] relationship i know i say that a lot but
[25:41] you can't say it enough everything that
[25:43] we are
[25:44] as individuals is based on a
[25:46] relationship
[25:47] and he goes on to say thorns and snares
[25:50] are in the way of the forward
[25:52] he that doeth he that doeth keep his
[25:54] soul shall be far from them
[25:56] and then everyone knows this scripture
[25:58] here train up a child and the way he
[26:00] should go and when he is old he will not
[26:03] depart from it
[26:04] and the rich rule is over the poor and
[26:06] the borrower is servant to the lender
[26:08] and and there's a lot of these
[26:11] christian
[26:13] financial people that's a scripture they
[26:15] they read all the time and it's really
[26:17] true
[26:18] if you know and it goes on to hate he
[26:20] that soweth and
[26:25] his anger shall fail he that hath the
[26:28] bountiful eye shall be blessed for he
[26:30] giveth of his bread to the poor you know
[26:32] that goes again to what i said in the
[26:33] beginning a humble spirit a caring
[26:36] spirit a giving spirit you know i was
[26:38] writing these notes down here
[26:41] what
[26:42] i'll just read what i was thinking here
[26:45] whether you like it or not
[26:47] it's always the same
[26:49] whatever you are as an whether you like
[26:51] it or not you manifest who you really
[26:54] are and in times of trouble or distress
[26:58] the person that comes out is who you
[27:00] really are
[27:02] if you're quick to anger or quick to
[27:04] accuse people of for your own mistakes
[27:07] that's who you really are when trouble
[27:09] comes if you're willing to accept that
[27:11] sometimes bad things happen to good
[27:13] people and move through it then that's
[27:15] more of a christ-like spirit if you're
[27:17] one of those people that has to blame
[27:19] everyone around you for the troubles
[27:21] that you're in then you have to go back
[27:24] and realize that sometimes your own
[27:25] decisions that you make in your life
[27:28] bring about the experiences you'll face
[27:30] later on but i just
[27:31] uh it i wrote down and it has to do with
[27:34] authority and that's what solomon's
[27:36] talking about here
[27:37] whether you like it or not
[27:39] there's always some form of authority
[27:42] that we all face over you whether you
[27:45] accept or
[27:47] accept accepted or not everyone here
[27:49] this morning's under some form of
[27:50] authority but and i'll just write some
[27:53] of those authorities that that we all
[27:55] face every day in our life
[27:57] and how you deal
[27:59] with them and how you represent yourself
[28:01] to people when you these authorities are
[28:04] brought about in your life is testifying
[28:06] who you are and that everyone knows the
[28:08] basic one is children and parents the
[28:11] relationship that children and parents
[28:13] have and fruit when you on the outside
[28:16] look at that relationship you're seeing
[28:18] whether children will accept the
[28:20] authority of their parents and the
[28:22] parents will accept the responsibility
[28:24] of that authority to guide their
[28:26] children as they're growing up
[28:28] and then you have another one and it's
[28:30] our country it's just
[28:32] it's gone i mean this one is the the
[28:35] relationship between the student and his
[28:38] teacher that's totally gone and now
[28:40] today's society too just like
[28:43] parental relationship is gone
[28:46] and how students and teachers interact
[28:48] with each other shows you and it goes
[28:50] back to the parents again have they
[28:52] taught their children right are you
[28:54] expecting your teacher to be
[28:56] the guardian of your children so you can
[28:58] be whoever you want to be and then he
[29:00] goes on
[29:01] he goes in this church this morning it's
[29:04] the same thing
[29:05] as members or as pastor the way you deal
[29:08] with your pastor or the way the pastor
[29:10] deals with you there's authority there
[29:12] there's a relationship there
[29:15] and when what you're representing when
[29:18] you leave the double doors out here how
[29:20] you represented here is a testimony to
[29:23] who you really are
[29:24] and the most important one i've noticed
[29:26] lately is totally out of keter is the
[29:29] relationship we have as citizens to the
[29:32] government and the government has a
[29:33] relationship to us as citizens that's
[29:36] completely broken down and it goes back
[29:38] to what we were reading in hebrews the
[29:40] fourth chapter as
[29:42] as satan out there in the world is
[29:44] breaking down these authorities and
[29:46] these relationships that we have with
[29:48] each other and you go to the last one
[29:51] and it's it i see it every day you all
[29:53] see it too it's a relationship
[29:56] you have as either the worker as the
[29:58] boss the way you interact
[30:00] those are different things that we deal
[30:02] with
[30:03] every day of our life
[30:05] and who you are as a christian is being
[30:07] represented
[30:09] every minute of your life when you're
[30:10] dealing with other people and how you
[30:12] accept authority or reject authority or
[30:15] how you deal with people in these
[30:16] different roles it's a testimony to who
[30:19] you are as a christian this morning and
[30:22] and that's how you you know when
[30:24] sometimes we don't want to hear what
[30:26] people think of us i know it's a hard
[30:29] thing sometimes you gotta
[30:31] sometimes when people are telling you
[30:33] the truth it's a real hard thing to
[30:34] receive and i just wrote down how you
[30:37] respect that authority and how you would
[30:38] deal with it shows your character shows
[30:41] who you are
[30:42] and you know everyone everyone has to
[30:44] have a good self-worth they have to
[30:46] believe that
[30:47] that they're a good per there's nothing
[30:49] wrong with that but you can believe
[30:50] yourself be be a good person and still
[30:53] be a devil at the same time
[30:55] and like i said before everything that
[30:57] we do as individuals
[30:59] is based upon the word of god and how we
[31:01] interact with the word of god in our
[31:03] lives and that shows who you are your
[31:05] children know who you are
[31:08] your workers know who you are
[31:10] your people you deal with outside your
[31:12] neighbors they know who you are you know
[31:15] are you willing to just overlook some
[31:17] people's faults and just let them you
[31:20] know sometimes you don't always have to
[31:21] be right you just have to be loving and
[31:24] forgiving sometimes
[31:25] you don't
[31:26] i don't know what i'm saying but uh i
[31:28] was just reading something also i was
[31:30] listening to
[31:32] on that old ipod i have i just let it
[31:36] recirculates on sometimes unless i lose
[31:39] power
[31:40] but i was going to read
[31:42] i was also thinking i was reading this
[31:45] this book this morning
[31:47] and i'll be i'm all over the place this
[31:49] morning i'll apologize if i seem like
[31:51] that
[31:56] you know
[31:57] if you look at our world that we're in
[31:59] this morning
[32:00] and the way it's going
[32:02] as brother thomas has been saying uh if
[32:06] you're listening to other people
[32:08] preaching online
[32:10] you
[32:11] the presence of the evil evil that's out
[32:14] there in the world it's it doesn't get
[32:16] any better you're surprised every day
[32:18] about what people can imagine and what
[32:21] people can do to each other but then i
[32:23] was thinking you know when you read the
[32:25] bible
[32:26] we forget that the society that paul
[32:29] and peter were living in the roman and
[32:32] greek society it
[32:34] just perverted
[32:36] i mean just like what you see what
[32:38] you're seeing now i say it said this
[32:40] before
[32:41] is no different than greek and roman
[32:43] society that they were dealing with
[32:44] every day the evilness that was in that
[32:47] society it's just crept back into our
[32:49] world right now and it's not going to
[32:51] get any better but it's going to get
[32:53] worse but brother branham was talking i
[32:56] hope i didn't lose my place here
[33:00] this quote here i'll read this is from
[33:02] 1957 april 7th it's
[33:05] uh jesus
[33:06] then jesus came there's several messages
[33:09] that have the same thing
[33:13] i probably lost my place
[33:15] here
[33:17] but
[33:18] yeah
[33:20] it has to deal with your darkest hour
[33:22] here
[33:23] but i think i lost my
[33:25] i think i lost my place here
[33:29] where i was going to read from
[33:32] it
[33:33] i'll just read what i have here it's the
[33:35] 42nd quote now there really was a dark
[33:38] time could you imagine those
[33:40] two beautiful this deals with martha and
[33:42] mary and they lost their brother but i
[33:44] was also thinking you know we live in a
[33:46] different society
[33:48] than in martha and mary's day
[33:51] uh and it's still the same way in some
[33:53] countries in the middle east as a woman
[33:56] you have to be either you're either tied
[33:59] to your father your husband or your
[34:01] brothers
[34:02] they didn't have any free reign so if
[34:05] your father passed away and you weren't
[34:06] married as a woman you were tied to your
[34:08] brothers
[34:09] and it's just that was just eastern
[34:12] society i know that would displease some
[34:15] modern women nowadays but that's just
[34:17] how society was and i'll just read what
[34:19] it had to say here
[34:21] it goes on the 44th and you think that
[34:24] lazarus when he got sick there's no one
[34:26] no sickness until you've had in your own
[34:29] home
[34:30] and i'm sure every one of us tonight can
[34:32] sympathize with martha and mary and how
[34:34] their their only bread maker they had
[34:37] their brother laid sick in the bed and
[34:39] perhaps the doctors
[34:41] had given him up and we're taught that
[34:43] he died with hemorrhages in the lungs
[34:45] and probably
[34:46] tuberculoka i didn't pronounce that
[34:48] right and he died with that condition
[34:51] and when he was sick and the doctors had
[34:53] to give him up then jesus failed to come
[34:56] to his friends so brother branham's
[34:58] talking about whether
[35:00] you're out in your life you might i
[35:01] don't
[35:02] know everyone here
[35:04] but god knows who you are he knows where
[35:06] your heart is and what is pressing you
[35:09] this morning what's laying on your heart
[35:11] and what's like
[35:12] you know
[35:13] god knows where you're at this morning
[35:15] it you might be at your ab this morning
[35:17] wherever that is but god knows where
[35:20] you're at this morning
[35:21] i mean your enemy's gonna try to tell
[35:23] you he doesn't care about you he has no
[35:25] concern for you but god really cares
[35:28] about you and it he died when the
[35:30] condition when he was so sick the doctor
[35:32] had given him up and jesus had failed to
[35:34] come to his friend
[35:36] now there really was a dark diamond
[35:38] that's no different than us this morning
[35:40] you know out there in the world it is a
[35:42] really dark time but you have a hole
[35:44] as long as you stay close to it could
[35:46] you imagine those two beautiful young
[35:48] lady sending for jesus to come and
[35:50] refuse to do it
[35:52] and after they had come out of the
[35:54] church and had denied the old orthodox
[35:57] written and had separated themselves
[35:59] from the other associates of the world
[36:02] and were then putting on putting their
[36:04] whole trust in the man christ who they
[36:07] believed to be the messiah christ then
[36:09] he let them down and
[36:11] that's what i'm trying to say you've put
[36:13] everything that you believe into this
[36:15] message
[36:16] of the hour so don't let the enemy don't
[36:18] let the darkness that you might be
[36:19] facing
[36:20] keep you from the goal that lays before
[36:23] you and he goes on to say we all had
[36:26] them kind of experience i remember when
[36:28] i was first converted and how the people
[36:30] thought i had lost my mind
[36:32] well they said if you keep
[36:34] that kind of religion you'll be in the
[36:36] sameness
[36:37] institution in a few days
[36:39] you've had the same thing or people
[36:41] making fun of you and your associates
[36:44] saying that you went off the deep end
[36:46] but as long as your faith is in christ
[36:48] everything will come out all right don't
[36:50] ever worry about that and now and now i
[36:53] can remember how that the people that's
[36:55] what i'm trying to say this morning
[36:58] no matter what the circumstances are i
[37:00] know it's hard when someone else like
[37:02] says that to you
[37:04] i
[37:06] i know the individual that's feeling
[37:08] that darkness or feeling that dark hour
[37:10] on him when you try to encourage him
[37:13] the devil will try to get on that same
[37:15] heart and say well he really don't care
[37:16] about you he's just saying that to say
[37:18] that and then you have to you have to
[37:21] just push those kinds of thoughts away
[37:23] and just reach out in faith and keep
[37:25] reaching out in faith
[37:27] we all come to that and then he goes on
[37:30] and i'll just finish and in my heart i
[37:32] believe it to be the real thing i jumped
[37:35] the quote here
[37:36] the holy spirit
[37:38] and 20 24 years have passed and it's

[1:08:09] verse i'm going to read the majority of
[1:08:12] the
[1:08:13] well i'll just come right down to the
[1:08:15] bottom of it and then we'll re read more
[1:08:17] later
[1:08:20] verse 31
[1:08:22] therefore take no thought saying what
[1:08:24] shall we eat or
[1:08:26] what shall we drink or where with all

[1:08:30] things do the gentiles seek for your
[1:08:32] heavenly father knoweth that you have
[1:08:34] need of thee things

[1:08:37] his righteousness and all these things
[1:08:39] shall be added unto you
[1:08:41] there take therefore no thought for
[1:08:42] tomorrow
[1:08:44] for tomorrow shall take thought of the
[1:08:45] things of itself sufficiency of the day
[1:08:47] is the evil thereof may god add his
[1:08:50] blessings to the reading of the word you
[1:08:52] can be seated this morning
[1:08:53] amen this is once again a
[1:08:56] scripture
[1:08:57] amen and i i truly believe that there is
[1:09:00] uh you know i heard i heard
[1:09:04] somebody tell me one time i was a young
[1:09:07] person and how they had told me
[1:09:09] uh that they had actually listened to
[1:09:11] every one of brother they had just got
[1:09:13] finished
[1:09:14] listening to every one of brother
[1:09:16] branham's messages
[1:09:18] i mean they seem pretty proud of it and
[1:09:20] then i guess that you should be right
[1:09:23] you know
[1:09:24] but you know i had i was thinking about
[1:09:26] that yesterday and i was thinking of how
[1:09:28] that
[1:09:28] uh how that the word is so eternal that
[1:09:31] you you can read one scripture
[1:09:34] and
[1:09:36] you don't even catch a fraction of what
[1:09:38] it really is
[1:09:40] amen and so reading was something once
[1:09:43] that's one thing i've you know i've
[1:09:45] ministered these things perhaps 30 years
[1:09:47] and i still get new things from them
[1:09:50] and it's still fresh it's still new amen
[1:09:53] and so but the lord has to quicken it to
[1:09:55] you amen the lord has to quicken it to
[1:09:57] you amen and so i feel i feel like the
[1:09:59] lord's laid a good message on my heart
[1:10:01] this morning
[1:10:02] amen and but i want to i want to i want
[1:10:05] to tell you first of all amen just
[1:10:08] maybe
[1:10:09] tell you a little bit how it come about
[1:10:10] would that be all right
[1:10:12] amen my god you know he's been working
[1:10:14] and out there at our place and so forth
[1:10:17] they're at their place
[1:10:19] and so he had a project they had to do
[1:10:22] and he got that done and he told me he
[1:10:24] was gonna go fishing you know and when
[1:10:25] you tell your dad you wanna you're gonna
[1:10:27] go fishing well dad's gonna think about
[1:10:28] how he can go fishing maybe
[1:10:31] and so anyway we managed to get to going
[1:10:34] fishing and
[1:10:36] he went down there and got started and i
[1:10:37] took a careful little errand that i had
[1:10:39] to do
[1:10:40] we had to do with me and my wife and
[1:10:42] then we got back and i got my
[1:10:43] four-wheeler and we went down there to
[1:10:44] the creek amen uh
[1:10:47] and michael was already in there and and
[1:10:50] when i pulled up to him he was already
[1:10:52] looked like he had put that jerking at
[1:10:53] something i said oh he's already at it
[1:10:55] you know
[1:10:56] and so i parked my four-wheeler and we
[1:11:00] got i got on the boat and boy was just
[1:11:01] tearing up down there at the creek he
[1:11:03] was just pulling them out so y'all
[1:11:04] remember that on the 11th okay
[1:11:07] there's some good bass in there i say
[1:11:09] i'll bring your pulse
[1:11:10] lords bless us with a real nice creek
[1:11:12] down there and so anybody likes to fish
[1:11:14] you but come down and enjoy it amen we
[1:11:16] want to share it with you all amen
[1:11:18] and woody i know your boys like to catch
[1:11:20] them bluegills so y'all bring them amen
[1:11:22] if you pan
[1:11:23] but i mean i'm looking forward to the
[1:11:25] 11th i mean that's when we plan on
[1:11:26] having that get together okay
[1:11:28] amen out at the farm so praise the lord
[1:11:31] but anyway make a long story long let's
[1:11:33] keep going but anyway so
[1:11:36] we uh
[1:11:38] you know what you official all along
[1:11:39] there we've just seemed like it was
[1:11:40] catching them left and right and so
[1:11:41] forth we come down close to that where
[1:11:43] my property can line kind of ends in the
[1:11:45] creek and it was just right at the edge
[1:11:47] right the deep hole
[1:11:49] and sure enough micah he got a nice big
[1:11:52] five and a half pound bass right there
[1:11:54] so he put him back so you all can try to
[1:11:56] get him he's going
[1:11:57] and but anyway so he caught that big old
[1:12:00] bass and boy i said that's a mountain
[1:12:02] that's a matter of eight pounds because
[1:12:03] i go a little extreme but
[1:12:05] he ended up being five and a half and
[1:12:07] then right after we released him and
[1:12:09] everything and he looked for his polls
[1:12:11] his 200 pole first my pole we got so
[1:12:14] excited nothing dropped off and we never
[1:12:16] even knew it off in the big old default
[1:12:19] well anyway i got to watch him go out
[1:12:21] and get really cold and wet
[1:12:23] and finally he prayed the lord he found
[1:12:25] his pole amen
[1:12:26] he had to put down push down from the
[1:12:28] trolling motor you know go way as far
[1:12:30] deep as he could but he managed to find
[1:12:32] it so we're just glad for that it was a
[1:12:35] good day after all you know
[1:12:36] even though it dropped off at all but we
[1:12:39] went on further down and amen kept
[1:12:41] fishing down towards the lake got up
[1:12:43] into the lake and so forth and you know
[1:12:45] he's just out fishing me
[1:12:47] and i was like well i'm gonna have to do
[1:12:49] i learned a lot if i'm gonna get
[1:12:50] anywhere close to being able to fish as
[1:12:51] good as him
[1:12:52] so one time he threw up against uh some
[1:12:54] grass and he didn't quite get there and
[1:12:56] i we about three at the same time and
[1:12:58] and i got a little closer kind of in the
[1:13:00] grass and pull out his eyes closer than
[1:13:02] you that means i'm gonna get him you
[1:13:04] know and sure enough a big old four
[1:13:06] pounder yes you know and i had my fight
[1:13:08] i said i told you i was calling it all
[1:13:10] day he was saying no they're over on
[1:13:12] this long dialogue yeah that's right but
[1:13:15] anyway he caught about i think 50 that
[1:13:17] day and i caught about
[1:13:19] 14
[1:13:23] but anyway
[1:13:26] so but it was really good may is good
[1:13:28] amen i think exactly i heard he was
[1:13:30] upset beshear and he caught five three
[1:13:32] five pounders two three pounders we're
[1:13:34] giving the secrets away they're
[1:13:37] deaf i don't know if i should we're
[1:13:38] really giving it away but
[1:13:40] maybe we can maybe we can get somebody
[1:13:42] all to go fishing man but anyway so we
[1:13:44] was going down through there and and we
[1:13:47] was trying to make it down to the other
[1:13:48] end so that grace could get on the boat
[1:13:50] at the end of the
[1:13:51] work day and me get off and get her to
[1:13:53] get be able to fish and we were kind of
[1:13:54] going down through there i said i had no
[1:13:56] idea spall lake was this long and huge
[1:14:00] look how big it is it's full of fish
[1:14:02] and i said now why why haven't i come
[1:14:04] down right here more why haven't i come
[1:14:07] down here what is wrong with me you know
[1:14:09] there's a lot of fish right here i got a
[1:14:11] 328
[1:14:12] acre lake right there up against me and
[1:14:14] i don't even know how to use it
[1:14:16] you talk about negligence but anyway so
[1:14:18] he's going down through there and i says
[1:14:20] my god
[1:14:21] why i haven't
[1:14:23] he made a statement that i got my
[1:14:24] message from this morning because i
[1:14:26] always try to keep my mind on the lord
[1:14:28] and he made a statement that caught my
[1:14:29] attention that i got my message from
[1:14:31] this morning
[1:14:32] and he says that's what that's all that
[1:14:35] life is
[1:14:36] is about priorities
[1:14:40] i kind of thought about that statement
[1:14:42] all life is
[1:14:44] is about priorities
[1:14:48] and i thought that's pretty good that's
[1:14:49] the truth isn't it
[1:14:51] you know it's because everybody pretty
[1:14:53] much is doing what they prioritize
[1:14:57] right they prioritize what they're going
[1:15:00] to achieve
[1:15:01] what they're going to do
[1:15:03] what kind of job they're going to have
[1:15:06] you know what kind of work you're going
[1:15:08] to do if you're going to be in politics
[1:15:09] if you're going to be in construction if
[1:15:11] you're going to be in lumber if you're
[1:15:12] going to whatever it is
[1:15:14] everybody prioritizes
[1:15:17] what you're going to do
[1:15:19] i thought life is all i thought it was
[1:15:21] kind of a strong statement that's all
[1:15:23] life is is about priorities
[1:15:26] and i thought that's true though it's
[1:15:28] true
[1:15:29] because truly i mean look at us this
[1:15:31] morning what was your priority this
[1:15:33] morning
[1:15:34] your priority was to get the church
[1:15:37] that right that was your priority that's
[1:15:38] what you put in your front
[1:15:40] first priority
[1:15:42] top priority
[1:15:44] amen
[1:15:45] you know
[1:15:47] and i thought you know that's the reason
[1:15:48] why i'm not down there more is because
[1:15:50] i've got other more things other things
[1:15:52] that are more important
[1:15:55] right
[1:15:57] amen and so i thought that is exactly
[1:15:59] right and i said that's what jesus
[1:16:01] taught that too jesus taught all about
[1:16:03] priorities amen
[1:16:05] so i want to read it i mean i pulled up
[1:16:07] siri and it gave me the noun part of it
[1:16:09] i guess i don't know if there's a
[1:16:10] pronoun positive or not but
[1:16:13] anyway we're going to read you the
[1:16:14] meaning of priorities
[1:16:18] it
[1:16:18] it says the fact or condition of being
[1:16:21] regarded or treated as more important
[1:16:26] another one the thing that is regarded
[1:16:29] as more important than the other
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:34] isn't that right and everybody on the
[1:16:36] whole world regards one thing
[1:16:39] or another more important
[1:16:42] than the other and that's why everybody
[1:16:44] does what they do is because they
[1:16:46] prioritize prioritize
[1:16:49] how many beliefs that's this what
[1:16:50] thought this life is all about you have
[1:16:52] to prioritize amen because you know i
[1:16:55] don't care you know you think about all
[1:16:57] of the people that prioritize you can
[1:16:59] you can go from uh you know uh
[1:17:02] beachgoers to
[1:17:04] boaters to fishing to
[1:17:06] um
[1:17:07] uh you know
[1:17:09] i guess they have these bud bargains mud
[1:17:11] slinging things they have you know and
[1:17:13] everything else you know it it is
[1:17:15] whatever people want and desire to do
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:21] and they do what they spend their time
[1:17:23] doing that
[1:17:25] amen they spend their time they spend
[1:17:27] their entire life people do amen in the
[1:17:31] thing that they have prioritized in
[1:17:33] their life
[1:17:35] amen and i thought about this scripture
[1:17:38] here where jesus says for one place he
[1:17:40] says he makes a statement he says you
[1:17:41] know where your treasure is there will
[1:17:44] your heart be also
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:49] oh how many please that
[1:17:52] my and i thought you know even the
[1:17:54] gospel think about it
[1:17:56] we know that jesus christ went to
[1:17:59] calvary he paid the rights he did
[1:18:01] everything that he could do on calvary
[1:18:04] and then the prophet comes along and
[1:18:05] says that if jesus was here wearing my
[1:18:07] suit he couldn't do any more for you
[1:18:12] so what does it mean that means that you
[1:18:15] are gonna have to prioritize
[1:18:18] you're gonna have to decide what you
[1:18:20] want to do with it
[1:18:23] praise the lord so it puts it on our lap
[1:18:27] what you want
[1:18:29] that's that that's the key folks it's
[1:18:32] what do you really want
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:39] i don't know about you but i want to do
[1:18:41] something that is lasting i want to do
[1:18:44] the best thing that there is to do on
[1:18:46] the face of the earth
[1:18:49] are you with me
[1:18:51] amen i want to do the best thing that
[1:18:53] you could possibly do and how many knows
[1:18:55] that is accepting the lord jesus christ
[1:18:59] that is making christ your treasure
[1:19:03] [Music]
[1:19:05] he is at the top of our priorities and a
[1:19:08] lot of times we have too many
[1:19:11] uh too many things going
[1:19:15] too many different priorities
[1:19:18] amen
[1:19:19] and you know i think i hit a nerve a
[1:19:21] little bit and i know i did wednesday
[1:19:23] when i spoke on something that i felt
[1:19:25] and i spoke on this wednesday about how
[1:19:27] that you know
[1:19:29] uh you know it seems like sometimes we
[1:19:32] as christians if we aren't careful and
[1:19:34] then we'll make uh uh
[1:19:38] turn a new page
[1:19:40] i call it a new page but it's not really
[1:19:42] that because when you recommit yourself
[1:19:44] to god and you you want to focus on god
[1:19:47] more and you want to be closer to god
[1:19:50] and you get closer to god and you want
[1:19:52] to keep your mind on the lord more
[1:19:53] perhaps and
[1:19:55] and perhaps a month or two or you don't
[1:19:57] have that walk that you once had with
[1:19:59] him and it just seems like sometimes we
[1:20:01] can go in this circle
[1:20:04] and then we we got to a place but it
[1:20:06] isn't long that we get pulled away and
[1:20:08] that's because of the flesh out here
[1:20:11] and not just because of this flesh but
[1:20:12] it's because of the things of the world
[1:20:16] it just comes to mind to brother bam
[1:20:18] talk about how that we want that victory
[1:20:19] we want that all the time but he says
[1:20:21] it's your job it's your home is your
[1:20:22] responsibility it's that that pulls you
[1:20:25] away from it
[1:20:26] are you with me
[1:20:28] all these earthly cares that we have
[1:20:31] pull you away from god
[1:20:36] big statement are you with me
[1:20:39] folks i don't know any place where the
[1:20:41] bible says working harder going to get
[1:20:43] you closer to god
[1:20:45] making more money going to get you
[1:20:46] closer to god getting richer is going to
[1:20:49] get you closer i don't read anywhere
[1:20:51] there
[1:20:53] amen
[1:20:54] but i mean now jesus told us he was the
[1:20:58] greatest teacher of priority
[1:21:02] [Music]
[1:21:05] oh my and i thought about this and i
[1:21:07] thought you know this morning
[1:21:10] i want to tell you where your problem
[1:21:12] is that okay can i tell you where your
[1:21:15] problem is
[1:21:16] how to solve your problem
[1:21:18] you know it'd be one thing for me to
[1:21:20] just point out all your bad places
[1:21:22] right
[1:21:23] then leave you hanging there you'd have
[1:21:25] a big old long face you'd really feel
[1:21:27] bad but i'm glad there's a solution
[1:21:30] and i believe that god has given us the
[1:21:32] solution
[1:21:33] amen
[1:21:35] amen
[1:21:36] so jesus begin to talk here in
[1:21:39] chapter 6 and verse 20 where your
[1:21:42] treasure is
[1:21:43] there will your heart be also
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:48] whatever you prioritize that's what you
[1:21:51] love
[1:21:53] what you love to do and do every day
[1:21:56] that's your top priority
[1:21:59] that's where your heart is
[1:22:02] and i just want to say that
[1:22:06] i believe that
[1:22:07] over in the book of psalms
[1:22:11] you know david said how many wants to be
[1:22:13] blessed
[1:22:15] i don't know about you but i love god's
[1:22:17] blessings
[1:22:19] i love god's joy
[1:22:22] i love to have god with me
[1:22:24] do you love to have god with you all the
[1:22:26] time
[1:22:28] amen
[1:22:30] david said it this way blessed is a man
[1:22:32] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:22:34] ungodly nor standeth in the weighted and
[1:22:36] the center of sinners nor sinneth in the
[1:22:38] ski seat of the scornful but his delight
[1:22:41] is in the law of the lord and in his law
[1:22:43] does he meditate day and night
[1:22:49] hallelujah
[1:22:50] what is that top priority is where is
[1:22:54] your mind at
[1:22:58] where is our thought pattern at
[1:23:00] amen day and night
[1:23:08] are you ready to hear some things you
[1:23:10] don't want to hear
[1:23:12] you want to hear something you don't
[1:23:13] want to hear
[1:23:20] the law is in the
[1:23:21] minute does he meditate day and night
[1:23:23] now notice
[1:23:24] and he shall be like a tree that's
[1:23:27] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:23:29] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[1:23:34] oh my i got to thinking about priorities
[1:23:36] maybe you want to be a football player
[1:23:38] and then i'm telling you what you have
[1:23:40] got to go to summer camp you they own
[1:23:42] you you got to do and get up when they
[1:23:44] get up with you you got to eat what they
[1:23:46] say get it you've got to pack this over
[1:23:48] and over and over and over and over
[1:23:49] again until you can run if you're a wide
[1:23:51] receiver you can run to the full speed
[1:23:53] job over to the left reach up and catch
[1:23:55] them with your one little old finger
[1:23:57] almost you get good at what you do when
[1:23:59] you keep that priorities right
[1:24:01] are you with me
[1:24:03] amen
[1:24:05] it's when you're a jack-of-all-trade
[1:24:07] and a master of none that you don't do
[1:24:09] anything too well
[1:24:12] huh
[1:24:14] because you do too many other things
[1:24:16] there's too many things you are doing
[1:24:18] and not one thing perfect
[1:24:21] how many knows and that's what we want
[1:24:22] to focus on lord help us i don't know
[1:24:25] about you but i don't care about being a
[1:24:26] football player i don't care
[1:24:28] the best fisherman out there i'd like
[1:24:30] that i'll catch michael
[1:24:35] but that's not my top priority i can be
[1:24:37] happy with 14 fish
[1:24:39] huh
[1:24:41] but
[1:24:42] the biggest thing is my top priority is
[1:24:44] to be a christian
[1:24:47] i believe that
[1:24:49] your top priority is to be a christian
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:54] that's your first
[1:24:56] to be pleasing to the lord
[1:25:00] amen
[1:25:02] oh my
[1:25:04] so notice
[1:25:06] oh my i thought you know you can't jump
[1:25:09] in the water without getting wet
[1:25:13] you can't do one thing over and over
[1:25:16] again without getting good at it
[1:25:21] huh
[1:25:22] if you truly devote yourself to anything
[1:25:25] you can get really good at it
[1:25:28] if you really devote yourself to being a
[1:25:31] christian
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:36] that's exactly the right you'll get
[1:25:38] do that if somebody smacks you on the
[1:25:41] face says something bad about you
[1:25:44] you won't have one ill feeling or that
[1:25:46] person you'll be able to go to the
[1:25:47] prayer and get on the clothes and say
[1:25:49] god bless that person
[1:25:51] lord help that person
[1:25:53] they feel terrible
[1:25:56] they have got to be in misery
[1:26:00] oh my bless them that curse you isn't
[1:26:02] that right you get good at it
[1:26:05] bringeth forth i like that somebody that
[1:26:08] does that brings forth his fruit in his
[1:26:12] season
[1:26:13] his leaf also shall not wither
[1:26:16] praise be the god but the bible says
[1:26:19] give me a preacher give me a christian
[1:26:21] or give me a housewife
[1:26:23] i'm going to add to this
[1:26:25] that's a christian
[1:26:27] first
[1:26:30] give me a housewife that's a christian
[1:26:32] first give me a farmer that's a
[1:26:34] christian first give me a factory worker
[1:26:37] now that he's a christian first
[1:26:41] a worker that'll put god first in
[1:26:44] everything
[1:26:46] and i'll show you a man that be
[1:26:48] successful despite anything the devil
[1:26:51] throws at him
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:57] glory
[1:27:01] hey man that's just what the lord shows
[1:27:03] me that sometimes we get
[1:27:05] caught up with whatever we're doing
[1:27:07] until we get more into that we get our
[1:27:08] mind
[1:27:10] no forgotten that we wonder where we
[1:27:11] lost our joy we wonder why we ain't got
[1:27:14] no amens in church we wonder why we
[1:27:16] ain't no hallelujah we ain't wondering
[1:27:17] why there ain't no smoking that's why
[1:27:19] the holy ghost
[1:27:20] it's because we got the bible somewhere
[1:27:22] else we got those priorities that got
[1:27:25] greater than our first priority
[1:27:30] that's why we're so quiet that's why we
[1:27:32] don't have the power of god but i'm
[1:27:34] saying god is like the ocean up there
[1:27:35] and he's got a big old pipe fitting down
[1:27:38] and he can't barely get that power down
[1:27:40] can't barely get that water going god's
[1:27:41] gonna want to feel you more than what
[1:27:43] you're willing to get filled
[1:27:51] think about it
[1:27:55] it's all there
[1:27:56] as much of god as what you want is what
[1:27:59] you can have
[1:28:01] but you got to get your priorities right
[1:28:05] you got to get your priorities straight
[1:28:07] i got to get my priorities straight
[1:28:10] amen
[1:28:12] because it's so easy today
[1:28:15] so easy
[1:28:18] to get drowned
[1:28:20] and choked as jesus said
[1:28:24] your word becomes choked
[1:28:26] in you because of the cares of life
[1:28:30] you know what he said he said because of
[1:28:32] the cares of life
[1:28:39] jesus did not care
[1:28:40] whether he had something to eat
[1:28:43] for dinner or supper or not he didn't
[1:28:44] care if he had somewhere to sleep or not
[1:28:48] he only cared about one thing
[1:28:50] seeking the kingdom first
[1:28:52] he wanted the will of the father first
[1:28:55] huh
[1:28:57] isn't that right my meat is to do the
[1:28:59] father's will
[1:29:00] that's what i love because god will take
[1:29:02] care of it
[1:29:06] so the question this morning that we
[1:29:07] might not want to hear is are we too
[1:29:09] blessed
[1:29:12] do we have too much
[1:29:17] remember israel god said it all in the
[1:29:20] bible that when it was nothing i gave
[1:29:22] you this and i blessed you and you got
[1:29:24] fat and then you
[1:29:25] forgot me
[1:29:27] the more they got past the further away
[1:29:29] from their god they got
[1:29:37] i'll try to calm down okay
[1:29:40] just calm down brother calm yourself
[1:29:43] down
[1:29:44] but i'm sorry when you jump in the water
[1:29:47] when you get the holy ghost oh it just
[1:29:50] does something for you
[1:29:54] oh my
[1:29:56] folks i'm not interested in knowing and
[1:29:58] realizing i'm going in circles
[1:30:01] huh
[1:30:03] i'm interested in realizing how to get
[1:30:05] out of that circle
[1:30:07] huh
[1:30:08] what do i do
[1:30:09] huh
[1:30:13] huh
[1:30:15] folks we're up one day
[1:30:18] and we're down to the next
[1:30:21] we're in one day and hallelujah the next
[1:30:23] day we're grumpy
[1:30:27] huh
[1:30:28] and by the way i'm saying while the
[1:30:29] other guy over there he's on the
[1:30:30] mountaintop all the time
[1:30:38] amen
[1:30:39] that's the truth
[1:30:42] huh
[1:30:44] but it don't got to be that way
[1:30:47] huh
[1:30:48] it's for you too
[1:30:50] just like him
[1:30:51] it's for me
[1:30:55] amen
[1:30:57] praise be to god
[1:31:00] now i just realized how this ties
[1:31:03] together
[1:31:04] with what brother bannon said now i'll
[1:31:06] show you a man that's successful despite
[1:31:08] all that the devil can put on him he
[1:31:10] seeks god first
[1:31:12] amen it's always always your christian
[1:31:15] walk with god is first
[1:31:22] when you get in a bad situation you
[1:31:24] wouldn't lose your temper if christ
[1:31:25] stayed first
[1:31:28] huh you wouldn't get ill if you just
[1:31:31] kept christ first
[1:31:34] is that right
[1:31:36] oh my
[1:31:38] and whatsoever he doeth
[1:31:42] shall prosper
[1:31:47] how many know that if you'll put god
[1:31:48] first in that way keep that priorities
[1:31:51] right
[1:31:54] and you will prosper no matter what the
[1:31:56] devil puts in front of you not even
[1:31:58] death you have to worry about
[1:32:01] oh i believe we should be like ff where
[1:32:03] we can be like these great warriors oh
[1:32:06] i've been waiting for this moment this
[1:32:08] is my time time this is the greatest
[1:32:10] moment in my life

[1:32:19] meetings ain't just for the past it's
[1:32:21] for us here this morning
[1:32:23] if you put your priorities right
[1:32:34] like i said jesus taught priorities
[1:32:37] how may believes it
[1:32:41] he said i am not come
[1:32:42] he says think not that i came to earth
[1:32:45] to send peace i came not to send peace
[1:32:47] but a sword i am come to set a man at
[1:32:50] variance against his father and daughter
[1:32:51] against her mother and daughter-in-law
[1:32:53] against her mother-in-law it's not gonna
[1:32:55] be a great big happy family if that
[1:32:58] great big happy family doesn't everyone
[1:33:00] have christ as their priority
[1:33:04] because you just can't have fellowship
[1:33:06] with darkness and rome
[1:33:09] huh

[1:37:17] he's given us
[1:37:19] for ourself

[1:37:26] amen i think about it
[1:37:29] whatever
[1:37:30] he doeth
[1:37:31] shall prosper another quote that goes
[1:37:33] along with another scripture that goes
[1:37:35] along with
[1:37:36] that quote about
[1:37:38] he'll be successful no matter what the
[1:37:40] devil puts in front of him
[1:37:41] remember over joshua the other one about
[1:37:43] putin he said this law of the book
[1:37:46] now wait a minute only be thou strong
[1:37:48] first chapter of joshua verse 7 and very
[1:37:51] courageous that thou mayest observe
[1:37:54] to do according to all the law which
[1:37:56] moses my servant commanded thee turn not
[1:37:58] from it from the right hand or to the
[1:38:01] left amen that's what time is all about
[1:38:04] he gets distracted so busy with this and
[1:38:06] so busy with that
[1:38:08] he turned from the right or to the left
[1:38:11] i ain't going to raise for a hand but
[1:38:12] how many knows you
[1:38:14] you know that a lot of times you get
[1:38:15] away from god
[1:38:17] god don't get away from you he convicts
[1:38:19] you he brings you back but we get away
[1:38:20] from god
[1:38:22] we turn to the right or turn to the left
[1:38:25] amen no way to get blessed right
[1:38:28] there listen or to the left that thou
[1:38:32] mayest prosper whether so ever thou
[1:38:36] goest
[1:38:37] brother madam didn't know what he was
[1:38:38] talking about didn't he
[1:38:40] and i'll show you a man that'll prosper
[1:38:42] that'll prosper not i'm not talking
[1:38:45] about financial you'll prosper
[1:38:47] spiritually
[1:38:50] remember david said i put the lord
[1:38:52] always before me
[1:38:56] like taking different ways always before
[1:38:58] me i put god first or i keep reading his
[1:39:02] word he would read his bible he would
[1:39:03] pray and always keep god in front of you
[1:39:08] how many knows that's keeping god with
[1:39:10] you at all the time and then what we
[1:39:12] want is god with you no matter where you
[1:39:13] go
[1:39:18] and then you'll see more of god's
[1:39:20] miracles you'll see more of god working
[1:39:22] praise the lord
[1:39:26] amen
[1:39:33] i like that
[1:39:36] jesus said behold the fowls of the air
[1:39:39] they so not
[1:39:41] neither do they reap nor gather into
[1:39:43] barns yet your heavenly father feedeth
[1:39:45] them
[1:39:46] are you
[1:39:47] much better than they
[1:39:49] brother bannon would go to a pentecostal
[1:39:51] meeting and those preachers man i got
[1:39:53] saved and god has blessed me he's
[1:39:56] blessed my business i own four cadillacs
[1:40:02] hey there's a lot of folks probably
[1:40:03] sitting in here could afford four
[1:40:04] cadillacs
[1:40:06] huh you prosper god does
[1:40:10] prosper you
[1:40:12] huh
[1:40:13] but brother baby says don't you go to
[1:40:15] bragging about those things hollywood's
[1:40:17] got it on your
[1:40:19] if that's god's blessing and remember
[1:40:21] they're more blessed than you are if
[1:40:22] you're just counting on that for your
[1:40:23] blessings
[1:40:25] he says that don't sound like pentecost
[1:40:28] pentecost they went and they sold
[1:40:31] everything they had
[1:40:34] here we go
[1:40:35] don't get sticky now
[1:40:38] do we have too much
[1:40:46] most of us
[1:40:47] like to get mower
[1:40:49] huh
[1:40:50] i remember i used to work with a guy he
[1:40:52] was a rough character
[1:40:54] but he says you know they used to call
[1:40:55] me joel gitmore
[1:40:57] huh
[1:40:58] he's always trying to get more i wonder
[1:41:01] how many get mores we have here this
[1:41:02] morning
[1:41:06] come on folks get
[1:41:08] get in the spirit with me will you
[1:41:10] that's right we like to get more
[1:41:13] lord help me i've determined god help me
[1:41:15] not i don't need anymore i only need
[1:41:17] what i need what do you give me god
[1:41:19] don't let me get so much that i don't
[1:41:21] got the time for god
[1:41:24] that's the problem that's why our pews
[1:41:26] are not as full as they are
[1:41:30] people are too got their priorities
[1:41:32] somewhere else
[1:41:37] huh
[1:41:40] that's why people aren't the kind of
[1:41:41] christians that's why we're not what we
[1:41:43] ought to be as christians
[1:41:45] is because
[1:41:46] we don't have our priorities right
[1:41:48] because you get priorities right you
[1:41:50] make christianity you make christ first
[1:41:53] i guarantee you you're going to reap the
[1:41:55] results of a good old-fashioned prayer
[1:41:58] life a good old-fashioned uh meeting i
[1:42:01] mean good old praying and reading the
[1:42:03] bible
[1:42:04] what's going to happen to you
[1:42:06] your
[1:42:07] life's going to change you can't jump in
[1:42:08] the water without getting wet
[1:42:11] amen
[1:42:13] and whatever it is you do when you do it
[1:42:15] with your whole heart you're gonna get
[1:42:16] better at it you're gonna get good at it
[1:42:19] amen that's what christ wants
[1:42:24] he wants first priority
[1:42:27] the first priority is not your business
[1:42:31] it's not about what you wear
[1:42:34] it's not about the clothes you have or
[1:42:35] the food that you have to eat or the
[1:42:37] house that you have to live in
[1:42:39] it's not first about being a housewife
[1:42:41] for being a husband
[1:42:44] it's first
[1:42:46] about being a christian
[1:42:48] by serving god
[1:42:49] how many believe that
[1:42:51] that's first
[1:42:53] everything else is
[1:42:54] secondary we get in trouble
[1:42:57] we get backslid
[1:42:59] we lose our hallelujahs
[1:43:02] we lose the ability the amen because we
[1:43:05] feel condemned
[1:43:09] huh
[1:43:12] we ain't we can't jump in church anymore
[1:43:16] huh because we don't live very high
[1:43:21] that's the problem
[1:43:23] and why is it
[1:43:24] i strongly feel it
[1:43:27] up there goes he's telling us we've got
[1:43:29] it's too easy to get distracted too easy
[1:43:32] to make christ second or third and then
[1:43:34] many times the prophet said we put him
[1:43:36] last most of the time
[1:43:41] we put it put him last
[1:43:44] we oh my you don't know how many times
[1:43:47] on saturday night i go to go to the
[1:43:48] house
[1:43:50] and i'll kick myself if i don't quit at
[1:43:52] noon saturday with whatever i'm doing
[1:43:54] and suddenly the rest of the day i feel
[1:43:57] condemned when i start to study that's a
[1:43:58] really good way to start studying isn't
[1:44:00] it when you feel bad about yourself
[1:44:03] no not really
[1:44:05] because i got too busy and i'm saying i
[1:44:07] haven't given the last of the day to the
[1:44:08] lord for tomorrow service
[1:44:11] people deserve better than that thomas
[1:44:13] what's wrong with you
[1:44:16] huh
[1:44:20] praise the lord
[1:44:23] what about us
[1:44:25] you didn't pray all day then in the
[1:44:26] evening when you're too tired to pray
[1:44:28] you say a 30-second prayer
[1:44:31] huh
[1:44:32] and off the sleep you go and that's all
[1:44:34] god gets
[1:44:35] and you wonder why you got trial
[1:44:37] problems yeah
[1:44:39] i wonder why we don't have no joy
[1:44:43] why we come to church and get quiet as a
[1:44:45] church mouse
[1:44:46] you can hear him squeak up in the walls
[1:44:49] you can hear his father calling
[1:44:52] not in this place

[1:45:17] priority was
[1:45:19] prestige there was uh being a big shot
[1:45:22] being uh looked up to having the
[1:45:24] uppermost seat pride was their priority
[1:45:27] that's why they rejected christ
[1:45:31] amen

[1:49:00] themselves anybody that puts their own
[1:49:02] interpretation their own ideas in the
[1:49:04] bible they consider themselves higher
[1:49:06] than god

[1:51:44] don't care if it's healing i don't care
[1:51:45] what it is you can have it if your
[1:51:47] priorities are right
[1:51:49] your priorities have to be right
[1:51:55] he's not obligated to you if they're not
[1:51:58] he said if he if you're not willing to
[1:52:00] forsake your own life you are not worthy
[1:52:02] of me
[1:52:04] amen
[1:52:07] praise be to god
[1:52:21] 16 26.
[1:52:24] all right you love him let that sink
[1:52:26] down here while i'm looking for
[1:52:27] something okay
[1:52:34] the ground of a certain man bought
[1:52:36] brought forth plentiful
[1:52:38] and he thought within himself saying
[1:52:39] what shall i do because i have no room
[1:52:41] for to bestow all my fruits
[1:52:45] and he said this what i would do i will
[1:52:46] pull down my heart i will build bigger
[1:52:49] and greater ones
[1:52:51] and there will i bestow all my fruits
[1:52:54] and all my goods and i will say to my
[1:52:55] soul soul thou has much goods laid up
[1:52:58] many years
[1:53:00] for many years take thy ease eat drink
[1:53:03] and be merry
[1:53:05] and god said unto him thou fool this
[1:53:07] night thy soul shall be required of thee
[1:53:10] then who shall those things be which
[1:53:12] thou has provided for
[1:53:14] so is he that left up treasure for
[1:53:17] himself and is not rich towards god
[1:53:22] oh i have a hope this morning i believe
[1:53:24] every one of us have a desire this
[1:53:26] morning that we want to be rich in god
[1:53:33] i want to be rich
[1:53:35] with god
[1:53:37] in god
[1:53:39] how many will make that your number one
[1:53:42] priority
[1:53:44] i want to be rich in god
[1:53:46] when our brother or sister gets down or
[1:53:49] whatever it might be let him god that
[1:53:51] the holy spirit be so much in me that
[1:53:53] what i say to him isn't just some off
[1:53:56] the walls crazy statement
[1:53:59] because i'm not prayed up like i should
[1:54:00] be but something that would help that
[1:54:02] would heal
[1:54:04] that would be good
[1:54:06] because how many of those anytime
[1:54:08] anybody's troubled or anything you can
[1:54:09] say the right thing or you can really
[1:54:11] say the wrong thing
[1:54:14] we all want to be able to say the right
[1:54:16] thing
[1:54:17] do the right thing
[1:54:19] be in tune with god be rich so that's
[1:54:21] what jesus says here
[1:54:23] this is your priority don't worry about
[1:54:25] some bigger barns and bigger this and
[1:54:27] bigger that make sure that you are rich
[1:54:30] in god
[1:54:34] amen
[1:54:40] i say to you take no thought for your
[1:54:41] life
[1:54:42] what you shall eat or what for the body
[1:54:44] what which shall ye shall put on
[1:54:46] it's not life more than meat embodied in
[1:54:48] raiment considered a raven state and so
[1:54:50] not neither do they spin
[1:54:52] amen
[1:54:54] but god feedeth them how much more are
[1:54:57] you better than the fowls
[1:54:59] amen
[1:55:01] praise be to god
[1:55:03] there again it says it in luke but
[1:55:06] seek the kingdom of god first
[1:55:09] and all these things shall be
[1:55:12] added
[1:55:13] unto you
[1:55:15] praise the lord
[1:55:18] let me talk to you a little bit
[1:55:20] about something else for a minute can i
[1:55:30] one more scripture towers this
[1:55:33] i i believe it the bib the bible says
[1:55:35] one place be careful beware
[1:55:37] of riches
[1:55:39] amen
[1:55:42] because they can absolutely drown your
[1:55:44] soul
[1:55:45] drown the spiritual man
[1:55:48] amen
[1:55:53] i'm talking to businessmen this morning
[1:55:54] myself haven't been a businessman
[1:55:56] i know how easy it is to get caught up
[1:55:59] isn't that right
[1:56:01] get too caught up
[1:56:03] until your business and your business
[1:56:05] deal
[1:56:07] is more important than staying quite
[1:56:10] honest
[1:56:11] huh
[1:56:12] or
[1:56:14] keeping god first in your life
[1:56:18] it can easily do it
[1:56:23] let me say this brother bennett said
[1:56:25] there's just as many millionaires
[1:56:29] many penny heirs he called them pennies
[1:56:31] and serious millionaires
[1:56:33] there's poor people that go after the
[1:56:35] money just as much as rich people do
[1:56:37] a lot of times
[1:56:39] amen and skirt god and push god's last
[1:56:42] even though they're just penny errors
[1:56:43] not very much at all but it's about
[1:56:45] chasing the mighty dollar
[1:56:47] lord i don't know about you but lord if
[1:56:49] i if i got to sell what i got if i got a
[1:56:52] now you know i thought about this and i
[1:56:53] thought we need to do like walmart says
[1:56:55] cut back a little bit
[1:56:57] some cut backs
[1:57:02] cut
[1:57:03] backs
[1:57:04] yeah let me say that again cut
[1:57:07] back
[1:57:10] if if it's causing you not to be
[1:57:13] in like you should be then you need to
[1:57:15] cut back
[1:57:17] say god i'm cutting back on this
[1:57:19] this is taking too much of my time
[1:57:22] this is taking too much of my time
[1:57:24] pretty soon you don't have any time
[1:57:28] when i thought about
[1:57:30] being ex
[1:57:31] because as a as a christian
[1:57:33] remember this other parable now one more
[1:57:35] priority can i go with one more priority
[1:57:37] example today this morning
[1:57:39] that is where he gives us a talent isn't
[1:57:41] it right
[1:57:42] he gives one one five one ten
[1:57:45] what did they do they all gained from
[1:57:47] those talents didn't they
[1:57:49] they all gained from those talents
[1:57:54] and i just in my mind i imagine that god
[1:57:56] has a wallet
[1:57:58] in his wallet he has
[1:58:01] he has money
[1:58:03] that is called time
[1:58:05] money
[1:58:06] time money a time money of a ten dollar
[1:58:09] bill
[1:58:10] time money of a twenty dollar bill
[1:58:14] time money of a thirty dollar bill
[1:58:17] time money of a forty dollar bill fifty
[1:58:18] 50 bill 60 bill 70 bill 80 bill
[1:58:23] brother perry she's cashing in on the 90
[1:58:25] dollar bill
[1:58:28] he's fixing a see a hundred dollar bill
[1:58:31] yeah a hundred dollar bill in time
[1:58:34] right
[1:58:40] remember i'm at 52 says you know i'm 52
[1:58:42] years old i'm an old man and if i'm
[1:58:44] gonna do something for god i better get
[1:58:45] to doing it
[1:58:47] huh
[1:58:50] just here the other day a young man i
[1:58:52] guess i probably a teenager mike knows
[1:58:53] in his neighborhood here in elkton i
[1:58:55] guess a young man got shot didn't he
[1:58:58] maybe maybe not
[1:58:59] even 20 years old he didn't even get the
[1:59:01] cash you know in 20 years that god had
[1:59:03] given him
[1:59:05] how many knows god has given us all time
[1:59:07] the talent of time
[1:59:10] he gives some 10 he gives them 20 he
[1:59:11] gives them 30. he might only give
[1:59:13] somebody
[1:59:15] maybe 50 50 years of time
[1:59:20] how many knows
[1:59:21] he adds your number he knows exactly how
[1:59:23] much time you have
[1:59:25] and the question we all have to ask
[1:59:27] ourselves
[1:59:29] what did we do how did we spend
[1:59:32] that money
[1:59:35] how did we spend that time
[1:59:42] brother parish
[1:59:45] the only
[1:59:46] time money
[1:59:48] that i don't regret spending
[1:59:51] is the time money that i have used for
[1:59:53] the lord
[1:59:56] huh
[1:59:58] how does that song the days have wasted
[2:00:00] are not few but many
[2:00:02] amen
[2:00:04] sometimes we waste our time don't we
[2:00:08] lord help us to use our time what we
[2:00:12] only have so much
[2:00:15] i'm cashing in on my 60 dollar bill
[2:00:18] maybe get the 70 i don't know but i know
[2:00:21] one thing
[2:00:22] and i hope this is for you too whatever
[2:00:24] whatever money he has given you
[2:00:27] let's use it
[2:00:28] for him
[2:00:30] let's use it to let our light shine to
[2:00:33] our neighbors
[2:00:35] to the people that come to our store
[2:00:37] brother irvin
[2:00:39] huh
[2:00:40] the people that we deal with to shine
[2:00:43] that light for christ because you only
[2:00:45] got so much
[2:00:46] and then it's going to be spent
[2:00:48] and you're going to be broke
[2:00:49] won't have time left
[2:00:52] keep it right keep that you keep your
[2:00:54] time
[2:00:56] bible says redeeming the time for the
[2:00:58] time is short
[2:00:59] you got to
[2:01:01] bring it back you got to say lord
[2:01:04] i'm wasting too much time on this and
[2:01:05] wasting too much time on that when i be
[2:01:08] needing to be using it for you more
[2:01:11] amen
[2:01:13] praise the lord
[2:01:22] how do you do it how do we actually
[2:01:25] put this into
[2:01:27] effect
[2:01:28] one thing is
[2:01:30] the way that you're going to be a better
[2:01:31] christian from this morning on
[2:01:33] and keep that priority
[2:01:36] the way that it's supposed to be in
[2:01:38] keeping christ first
[2:01:40] is discipline
[2:01:43] discipline
[2:01:45] is self-control
[2:01:47] making yourself do what your body
[2:01:49] perhaps don't want to do
[2:01:51] amen
[2:01:52] for me
[2:01:54] when i'm so into something i want to
[2:01:55] just do this and i say no stop
[2:01:58] take 10 minutes
[2:02:00] and get the prophet playing
[2:02:02] or the bible playing
[2:02:05] get out in the garage or
[2:02:07] got a little workbench there and
[2:02:08] everything or whatever and and and hey
[2:02:11] comes to my mind i need to pray a little
[2:02:13] right and just get down to kneel and
[2:02:15] pray more than what you do
[2:02:18] find the place to pray it makes a huge
[2:02:20] difference how many believes that
[2:02:23] find a place to pray find a place to
[2:02:26] just dedicate to god more
[2:02:28] amen we need it
[2:02:31] self-control or discipline
[2:02:34] is what it takes because
[2:02:35] how many knows we're in a world where
[2:02:37] there is just no discipline
[2:02:41] people don't discipline their self
[2:02:46] or control
[2:02:47] yourself
[2:02:50] they go with the feeling or the mood or
[2:02:53] whatever it is
[2:02:54] that's not what we're here to do
[2:02:57] amen
[2:03:05] let's stop
[2:03:07] and think about it
[2:03:11] and that is
[2:03:13] we need to be richer in god
[2:03:15] how many need to be richer than what you
[2:03:17] are
[2:03:18] i am not rich enough
[2:03:20] in god i don't have enough more enough
[2:03:22] of the holy spirit
[2:03:24] like i should have
[2:03:26] my priority is to be ready
[2:03:29] and waiting
[2:03:31] when he comes
[2:03:34] my priorities to see him when he splits
[2:03:36] the eastern sky
[2:03:38] when all the saints of all the ages come
[2:03:40] forth
[2:03:41] i want to be ready
[2:03:43] i don't care about all the other
[2:03:45] priority everybody else politicians

[2:03:53] gospel music stars whatever just
[2:03:56] whatever whatever your priorities that's
[2:03:58] you
[2:03:59] my heart's desire
[2:04:03] is to have the lord always before me
[2:04:06] and not get
[2:04:08] pulled away
[2:04:11] not something sinful maybe but just not
[2:04:14] keeping your mind on the lord like you
[2:04:16] should
[2:04:18] not doing what the bible says
[2:04:21] keep him
[2:04:22] on his law does he meditate
[2:04:25] day and night that's first i'm gonna
[2:04:27] remember your mind
[2:04:29] god wants your mind
[2:04:30] because if you got your mind he's gonna
[2:04:32] have your heart
[2:04:34] amen
[2:04:36] how many is guilty of not keeping on
[2:04:39] your mind
[2:04:40] like you should
[2:04:42] honestly how many is we got to be honest
[2:04:46] how many knows for a fact that that's
[2:04:48] why some of the problems that you have
[2:04:49] the anxiety nervousness you're going to
[2:04:52] get nervous if you get away from god
[2:04:56] yes i do you get nervous you're like

[2:05:34] christian walk with the lord
[2:05:36] and no matter what comes your way
[2:05:39] you will overcome it
[2:05:41] by god's grace
[2:05:42] if you have priorities
[2:05:44] all right let's stand this morning
[2:05:48] let's not multitask so much okay
[2:05:51] let's keep focused on our main task
[2:05:54] that's the right and christians before
[2:05:56] the lord
[2:05:58] let's bow our heads
[2:06:01] lord jesus we come before you lord and
[2:06:04] we're so grateful lord jesus
[2:06:07] that we
[2:06:08] don't have to just imagine or desire to
[2:06:11] have this but you made it possible on
[2:06:13] calvary
[2:06:14] and i know lord jesus from experience
[2:06:16] that whenever anybody ever really sets
[2:06:18] their heart to serve you
[2:06:21] like old buddy robinson he absolutely
[2:06:24] put the reins down
[2:06:26] of with his mules and his horse and his
[2:06:28] plow and he says god if you don't come
[2:06:30] and give me the holy ghost die you'll
[2:06:32] find the pile of bones lord he put you
[2:06:35] first
[2:06:36] his top priority was to have that holy
[2:06:38] ghost lord if we'll do that same thing
[2:06:40] it doesn't matter who it is in here
[2:06:42] anybody that doesn't have the holy ghost
[2:06:44] like they should have lord help him this
[2:06:45] morning right now to say i now raise my
[2:06:48] hand and say i'm putting god first
[2:06:50] my number one priority is to be a
[2:06:52] christian and to be holy ghost filled
[2:06:55] no matter how much the devil tries to
[2:06:57] tell me or i think of myself as not
[2:06:59] worthy i'm not looking at my worthiness
[2:07:01] i'm looking at his worthiness
[2:07:03] god bless those hands god bless you god
[2:07:05] bless you lord jesus our hands are up
[2:07:07] we're saying god we want to be filled
[2:07:09] with your holy spirit we want more of
[2:07:11] you we want to we want to do exactly
[2:07:13] what you said to do lord jesus not
[2:07:15] worrying about bigger barns and just
[2:07:16] that or the other but we're more
[2:07:18] concerned about being rich in you this
[2:07:20] morning that is our top priority lord is
[2:07:23] to be rich in you father and we raise
[2:07:25] our hands to you lord this morning and i
[2:07:27] pray god from this morning on
[2:07:29] that we will not go out of here just
[2:07:31] have heard another message lord but to
[2:07:33] have heard from you speaking to our
[2:07:35] hearts and we will change what we do and
[2:07:38] the way that we do it lord because we
[2:07:40] can never expect to have any different
[2:07:43] things happen lord doing the same thing
[2:07:45] lord but we will discipline ourselves
[2:07:47] control ourselves and say god this is
[2:07:49] what i'll do lord
[2:07:50] father how blessed it's been what a
[2:07:52] blessing it's been for me just and lord
[2:07:54] the adjustment that i've made lord
[2:07:57] in
[2:07:57] doing what you said
[2:07:59] draw nigh
[2:08:01] to you
[2:08:02] and you will draw an eye to us
[2:08:05] so lord you're waiting on us so father
[2:08:07] we're here raising our hands saying god
[2:08:09] i want to be closer to you lord
[2:08:12] i pray that every person in here after
[2:08:14] this morning would be able to go out
[2:08:16] those doors and have more of the love of
[2:08:18] god in their hearts
[2:08:20] and lord and to be
[2:08:22] absolutely legit that they will spend
[2:08:24] the rest of their time
[2:08:26] that you gave them for you
[2:08:29] lord jesus the talent that you've given
[2:08:31] them so or perhaps be able to win
[2:08:33] another soul to you lord
[2:08:35] because your prophet taught us that if
[2:08:36] we're not willing souls to winning souls
[2:08:39] then we're failing lord
[2:08:41] take that money that you have given us
[2:08:43] and to be able to win one soul that
[2:08:45] would be worth a thousand worlds lord
[2:08:48] help us to be a witness for you that's
[2:08:49] our top priority in whatever we do
[2:08:52] forgive us lord also father we ask now
[2:08:54] as we raise our hands in the name of
[2:08:56] jesus we ask god that you would forgive
[2:08:58] us of lord where we have lord you know
[2:09:01] god sidetrack so often we do so easily
[2:09:03] and in the cares of life and how busy we
[2:09:06] are we're just too busy lord and we ask
[2:09:09] god that you'd help us to bring back
[2:09:10] some of that time say god i'm bringing
[2:09:12] back more time for you
[2:09:14] and i'm going to stay focused on you yes
[2:09:16] i have to do this i have to do that to
[2:09:19] live but god it's you first before all
[2:09:21] that
