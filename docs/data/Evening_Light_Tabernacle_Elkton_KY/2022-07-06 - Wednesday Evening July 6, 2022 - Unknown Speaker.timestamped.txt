[31:22] real privilege to stand for jesus
[31:24] amen and testify of him amen brother
[31:26] sean
[31:34] god bless everybody
[31:36] um i know i talk a lot and y'all all
[31:38] know all about me so uh i'll just
[31:41] go past that part um
[31:44] i'm gonna start back uh talk to brother
[31:46] tommy i've been talking about the
[31:47] bothering brother david and even brother
[31:49] joe i believe i mentioned
[31:51] to him before i wanted to testify i felt
[31:53] like you know um
[31:56] it would be kind of a release for me
[31:58] because a lot of things you hold in um a
[32:00] lot i mean you talk to your family and
[32:02] you talk to people here and there and
[32:05] uh but i feel like uh speaking to you
[32:08] guys might really just
[32:10] be therapeutic and you know
[32:12] i guess you could say um
[32:15] so i'll start back um
[32:17] when i was about six years old um
[32:20] the first
[32:21] thing i witnessed
[32:23] from
[32:24] christ
[32:26] i used to have really bad earaches when
[32:28] i was a young kid um
[32:29] i mean i don't remember when they
[32:31] started but i do remember when they
[32:32] stopped um
[32:34] um
[32:36] but i had hearaches almost all the time
[32:38] and they were
[32:40] tormenting type of earaches and um
[32:44] i had stayed home from church one night
[32:45] my dad when at the time my dad was going
[32:48] to a pentecostal church um
[32:50] but he had come home and saw me writhing
[32:52] on the floor
[32:54] uh he called brother tatum i still
[32:55] remember his name the pastor of the
[32:57] church um to come over and pray for me
[33:00] and um
[33:02] and
[33:03] brother tatum came over and um
[33:05] i'm laying on the floor still crying and
[33:07] screaming and
[33:09] they get on their knees and they start
[33:10] they lay their hands
[33:12] on them
[33:13] and they start praying
[33:14] and and this to me it means like you
[33:16] know the faith of a child you know
[33:18] that's
[33:19] and some of you preached the other day
[33:21] about having a simple simple faith
[33:23] that's a simple thing we make it much
[33:25] more difficult than it really is and i
[33:27] just wanted to speak about this this
[33:28] part i'm sorry i can be talkative i'll
[33:30] try my best not to be but um
[33:34] so like i said my dad and
[33:36] brother tatum they got one knee on the
[33:38] floor with me and they started to um
[33:40] pray
[33:41] and in my mind um i know they're talking
[33:43] to jesus
[33:45] you know i i mean i remember i mean this
[33:47] is like probably the most vivid child
[33:48] memory childhood memory i have but i
[33:51] knew only thing i really knew and
[33:53] understood is they were talking to jesus
[33:56] and i knew everything was going to be
[33:58] all right
[33:59] and um
[34:01] i
[34:02] after just
[34:04] maybe a few minutes of prayer
[34:06] all of a sudden the pain just went away
[34:08] and i set up and i looked at my dad and
[34:10] i said who did that he said who did what
[34:12] son i said who pulled that out of my ear
[34:16] and from that day to now i've never had
[34:18] a problem with any of my ears and i
[34:20] praise god for that because that was
[34:22] just the first thing that made me see
[34:23] what god's capable of doing and that's
[34:26] you know i want to get back to that kind
[34:27] of faith and i'm sure i can speak for
[34:29] everybody here when saying that
[34:31] we need to make faith a whole lot less
[34:33] complicated
[34:35] um
[34:36] and uh it really shouldn't be but we let
[34:38] so many things in the world get in the
[34:40] way of our thoughts and
[34:42] uh you get confused and you you know you
[34:44] feel things and it makes you
[34:46] second guess but we need to get back to
[34:48] that simple faith where it's just as
[34:50] simple as taking god in this word that's
[34:52] that you know because that's what it's
[34:54] intended to be
[34:56] if y'all don't mind i'll i gotta i mean
[34:58] i could go on but uh
[35:00] another time
[35:02] my daddy he found a message church um
[35:05] probably maybe two years later
[35:07] roughly and uh it was bible tabernacle
[35:10] and um
[35:12] some of y'all may know albert greene
[35:14] remember albert greene
[35:16] around charlotte statesville north
[35:17] carolina area
[35:19] but um
[35:20] we were having church one night i think
[35:22] it was a wednesday night it was a really
[35:24] bad storm
[35:25] and they put on a projector to watch uh
[35:27] the deep on the deep cough into the deep
[35:31] and um
[35:32] we were just all sitting there i think
[35:34] i'm at this
[35:36] time i might have been eight or nine
[35:37] years old and
[35:38] um
[35:41] we were watching the deep policies i
[35:43] hadn't got very far into it a massive
[35:44] lightning bolt struck outside the church
[35:46] and knocked all the power out all around
[35:48] the neighborhood you can see it was just
[35:49] pure blackness
[35:51] and uh
[35:52] this is just something i witnessed
[35:53] supernatural
[35:55] with god i wanted to share with you all
[35:56] and um so we're sitting there in the
[35:59] darkness for a minute the projector
[36:00] obviously stops there's nothing on
[36:02] and um a light comes into the room a
[36:04] ball of light not like a reflection of
[36:07] like a you know a car
[36:08] going by but a ball of light came around
[36:11] started circling the church
[36:13] then it went to that projector and when
[36:15] it went to that projector that projector
[36:17] came on and started playing the deep
[36:18] cloth into the deep right there with no
[36:20] other power on anywhere in the
[36:21] neighborhood
[36:22] and i'm telling you god is real i mean
[36:25] he will show himself in so many
[36:27] different ways you can physically see
[36:28] him and i thought i feel i was fortunate
[36:30] enough to physically see
[36:32] the spirit of god that night coming
[36:33] there in that little ball of light just
[36:35] so we could watch that message at night
[36:38] it was and it um
[36:41] i don't know if i'm going too long
[36:43] on a personal level i want to thank god
[36:45] for um
[36:47] uh well all that it's personal but um
[36:50] i went through a lot of things um
[36:51] especially coming out of the military i
[36:53] had started drinking um
[36:55] while i was in the military
[36:58] and when i found out i was being
[37:00] medically retired i'm you know
[37:02] had nothing better to do and i got
[37:04] depressed and i started you know they
[37:05] sent me to my medical appointments to
[37:07] get you know evaluated and
[37:09] all my medical appointments were in the
[37:11] morning and i'd go home and just i'd go
[37:13] and that my appointment i go home and i
[37:15] just started drinking all day all day
[37:18] and
[37:19] it was nothing for me to put down 30 or
[37:22] more beers
[37:23] in a day
[37:24] and um
[37:27] it just got worse
[37:28] worse and to the point where
[37:30] i wanted to stop so bad
[37:33] but every time i tried i started going
[37:35] into detox
[37:36] you know my whole body would cramp up my
[37:38] muscles would cramp up
[37:40] and um
[37:41] and my heart would uh at some points got
[37:44] up to 189 190 beats a minute and i could
[37:48] have been going on the cardiac arrest
[37:49] and i felt like well if i could just
[37:50] taper off this alcohol you know if i
[37:52] could just taper off and i tried that
[37:54] but no it wasn't working and
[37:55] i just and
[37:57] and the only thing that i felt like was
[37:58] saving me from dying was to keep
[38:00] drinking it got to that point that's and
[38:02] that's what the devil does to you know
[38:03] you and he can get you to the point
[38:05] where it's fatal i mean and that's where
[38:06] i was at that point in my life
[38:08] and um
[38:10] i was i caused all kinds of problems for
[38:12] my family i was mean um
[38:16] i mean
[38:17] worst human being you could probably
[38:19] possibly imagine at that time in my life
[38:21] and um
[38:23] but
[38:25] i finally um
[38:26] called i forgot the name of the place in
[38:28] hawkinsville kentucky
[38:30] and said you know
[38:32] i know god's gonna take this from me but
[38:34] he also gave us
[38:36] help to get rid of these things so
[38:38] um
[38:40] i went and checked myself and i told him
[38:42] i want to be here for just three days
[38:44] just to let me you know help me through
[38:45] the detox thing and i'm never going to
[38:46] drink again and i knew in my mind if i
[38:48] could just get past that i would never
[38:50] drink again because i knew god was going
[38:52] to deliver me from it because in my mind
[38:54] i was already done drinking it was a
[38:55] matter of getting
[38:57] anyway i'm long-winded y'all so i went
[39:00] and after uh six days instead of three
[39:02] they decided to keep me three extra days
[39:05] i came home and i went years and years
[39:07] and years without drinking any more
[39:09] alcohol again
[39:10] and
[39:11] god delivered me from that and you're
[39:13] talking about a peace of mind something
[39:14] such a huge thing came off my shoulders
[39:18] but then i backslid
[39:20] but all that you know and i was drinking
[39:21] and this is recent and um not i mean
[39:25] fairly
[39:26] recent i started not as bad as not as
[39:29] heavily as i was before but i was
[39:31] drinking again and in my mind i'm like
[39:32] what am i doing am i really going to go
[39:34] down this road again
[39:35] and i ca and i kept doing them i kept
[39:38] doing it
[39:39] and i was even
[39:41] while i was drinking i would talk to god
[39:42] and say god i don't want this you've
[39:44] already delivered me from this
[39:45] um why am i letting this back into my
[39:47] life
[39:48] and then i was in a very very dark place
[39:51] not you know not long ago
[39:55] i would text brother byler and brother
[39:57] david and probably be incoherent because
[40:00] and i was embarrassed um
[40:02] i was trying to reach out but i was in
[40:04] such a dark place i didn't know how to
[40:05] talk i didn't know how to explain myself
[40:08] and um and it went through that and i
[40:11] was so depressed and you think you your
[40:13] thoughts come to your mind about ending
[40:14] your life and
[40:15] you know not being you know good for
[40:17] your family what's the use of you being
[40:18] around type of thing
[40:20] but i never but in my mind i never
[40:22] forgot that god already delivered me i
[40:24] just had to
[40:25] you know
[40:27] anyway
[40:29] um
[40:30] and then one night i had a really bad
[40:32] one day i had a really bad day and a
[40:34] really bad night and i mean i was just
[40:36] yelling to the top of my lungs just like
[40:39] i'm embarrassed about it
[40:41] i was yelling at my family i was whoever
[40:43] was around
[40:44] saying mean things
[40:46] was like god i can't be like this it's
[40:48] not who i am you know it's not what i'm
[40:49] supposed to be
[40:52] and the next morning i woke up and i
[40:55] and this was probably about three months
[40:57] ago
[40:58] and i woke up and
[41:00] all of a sudden i felt like that
[41:01] darkness had lifted out of my mind and i
[41:03] saw light again
[41:05] it just felt so good to finally got i
[41:07] knew that god had already delivered me
[41:09] it was just me
[41:11] you know i backslid into it i just kept
[41:13] on hanging on i'm already delivered i'm
[41:15] already delivered i'm already delivered
[41:17] and
[41:18] it left me again god took it away from
[41:20] me again
[41:21] and um i have
[41:23] i mean i could testify all day about
[41:25] things god's done for me but i just i
[41:27] just wanted to let everybody know there
[41:30] a little bit of background story about
[41:32] me you know
[41:33] the way of a transgressor is hard
[41:35] and i'm living proof of that i mean if
[41:38] you choose to i know i'm one of god's i
[41:40] know i am but if you choose to go
[41:43] against his word and turn her back on
[41:44] him because
[41:46] they didn't turn his back on me i turned
[41:48] my back on him
[41:49] and um
[41:51] if you choose that road and you're one
[41:52] of his
[41:54] you're going to feel it and i'm telling
[41:56] you what my mom was going through
[41:57] turmoil my body was going through
[41:59] turmoil
[42:01] and
[42:02] i'm still not where i need to be but i
[42:04] know that i've come a long way and i
[42:06] know i'm gonna
[42:08] like
[42:08] i remember one time brother bob looked
[42:10] straight at me during the service and he
[42:11] said
[42:12] you know god hasn't won didn't begin to
[42:14] work and knew that he i can't my mind's
[42:16] blank and i'm nervous so i can't think
[42:18] of the scripture but
[42:20] if he begins a good work in you he'll
[42:21] complete it i remember you you looked
[42:23] directly at me and said that and i was
[42:25] like it just gave me so much
[42:26] encouragement you know i was like yeah i
[42:28] know i mean
[42:30] you know we all have our faults we all
[42:32] we all
[42:33] we all have our failures and
[42:36] i want to share y'all share with you all
[42:38] mine and just
[42:40] um
[42:42] let y'all know a little bit about me um
[42:45] but um
[42:46] there's a lot of things i can stand up
[42:47] here and testify about things i've
[42:49] witnessed in the message and and maybe
[42:51] another time i'll be able to do that but
[42:52] i could keep talking all night so i'll
[42:54] just go ahead and just stop there and
[42:56] just praise god and thank him for
[42:58] everything he's done in my life
[42:59] protecting me healing me
[43:01] i mean there's just so many it's an
[43:03] endless list
[43:05] of things that god has gotten me through
[43:07] and i really appreciate him for it
[43:10] [Applause]
[43:19] amen
[43:20] thank you bye sean
[43:23] that was good amen god can deliver can
[43:26] he
[43:27] amen i'm so thankful for it praise be to
[43:31] god
[43:32] keep molding us and shaping this into
[43:34] his image amen
[43:36] amen who else wants to give a testimony
[43:38] this evening

[43:47] lord
[43:49] amen god bless you
[43:51] thanks for your service
[43:55] uh
[43:57] now that sean has brought it all up and
[43:59] cleared his conscience
[44:01] i want you guys to know
[44:03] the more it worked in the mysterious way
[44:05] because the devil was in sean and it
[44:09] backfired
[44:10] because he brought me
[44:13] who started sinning about 50 years ago
[44:16] into the church two years ago and
[44:19] believe it or not
[44:20] i quit smoking i don't drink
[44:23] i used to vape i don't fade
[44:26] i only got one little sin that i'm
[44:28] trying to get rid of and i'll get rid of
[44:30] it
[44:32] if i don't my wife's gonna kill me but
[44:35] other than that
[44:36] but i i want you to know
[44:40] sean
[44:42] i thank him every day for showing me
[44:45] that god is still here
[44:48] and that was one
[44:50] terrible night when
[44:52] all things went wrong
[44:54] and he was in one of his
[44:56] bad bed
[44:58] spaces
[45:00] and
[45:02] he
[45:04] he was talking
[45:05] crazy
[45:08] and
[45:09] you know you were
[45:11] and
[45:12] so he was going to walk home
[45:15] about five miles away or more and
[45:18] go home and shoot itself he said and i
[45:21] said well no you're not because i'm
[45:22] gonna tell you
[45:24] being the center that i was the lord
[45:26] punished me
[45:28] i had a 14 year old son that took his
[45:30] own life with a gun
[45:32] so
[45:34] that's on me
[45:37] never will i let that happen to anyone
[45:39] else
[45:41] and
[45:42] so that
[45:45] uh my
[45:46] our friend
[45:47] uh leo
[45:49] who served with sean in afghanistan
[45:53] uh we got in the truck and we took off
[45:56] and
[45:57] we got
[45:58] down and
[46:01] here
[46:01] here the police are
[46:04] and shawn's being being an idiot so we
[46:07] decided we better get involved and
[46:09] when we told the officer that we were
[46:12] both
[46:13] uh retired service
[46:15] men and sean was also retired he was
[46:18] just a little crazy right now
[46:20] instead of putting him in jail they took
[46:22] him and got him a little help
[46:25] and
[46:26] from that point on
[46:28] the lord has blessed all of us his
[46:31] family my family they have a beautiful
[46:34] granddaughter they have a wonderful son
[46:36] and a wonderful daughter
[46:39] and so i just can't thank the lord
[46:41] enough and i hope everyone realizes
[46:44] that he is still here and he works
[46:49] [Applause]
[46:54] amen praise god for his mercy
[46:58] amen all right who wants to go next
[47:03] amen you had all week to pray about it
[47:05] brother tommy come on up here
[47:07] he's wanting everybody to get fired up
[47:09] is that all right
[47:11] i think everybody half the church
[47:13] is yesterday right or the other day

[47:17] of guy better timing god bless you
[47:31] still always get nervous when i get up
[47:32] here
[47:34] i thought
[47:35] i started out thinking uh i've been
[47:38] wanting to say this for a while because
[47:39] uh
[47:40] tammy always
[47:42] messes with me about like if i build
[47:43] anything she wants the second one you

[47:49] sorry and you know it's like bless
[47:50] y'all's heart for y'all have to hear my
[47:52] first testimony because it was like an
[47:54] hour and a half you know
[47:56] then
[47:57] you live and learn and i remember my
[47:59] second one you know i
[48:01] got down to about 45 minutes and uh it's
[48:04] a little bit a little bit it's growing
[48:06] and progressing you know yeah
[48:09] and
[48:09] i just thought i was like man i put you
[48:12] all through it on that first testimony
[48:14] but uh
[48:16] i said uh
[48:23] uh
[48:24] i got my big checkup coming up next
[48:26] monday you know i'm coming up to go up
[48:28] to
[48:29] see if uh
[48:30] you know
[48:32] what the the aorta terror looks like and
[48:34] everything you know i'm just praying for
[48:36] a complete victory over this thing so
[48:37] you know because i got people all around
[48:39] me that you know you can see the
[48:40] unbelief in their eyes and when we talk
[48:42] they're like well i can't wait to see
[48:43] what you know happens up there you know
[48:45] i'm like well honestly i don't really
[48:46] care anymore what happens
[48:48] you know at the end of the day i got to
[48:50] put my faith and trust in the lord you
[48:52] know brother brown said too he said uh
[48:54] you got your healing as long as you as
[48:56] long as you keep believing for your
[48:57] healing so you know if i just keep
[48:58] taking god at his word he says by my
[49:00] stripes you're healed i'm the lord that
[49:02] god that healeth thee so i don't have
[49:04] nothing to worry about even if it does
[49:05] come back show a terror or something i'm
[49:07] just gonna keep on believing you know
[49:08] that i'm talking to the great physician
[49:10] you know it got me to thinking you know
[49:12] if i listen to the doctors and the
[49:13] devils i'd be shriveled up laying uh
[49:15] laying on the bed or in the hospital
[49:17] better on the couch in a dark place
[49:19] crying about it you know it was like
[49:20] they come it was like they come and just
[49:22] strip me in my life but you know jesus
[49:24] came on scene and restored my life you
[49:26] know gave me something shout out about
[49:28] you know i said i was on the way the
[49:30] other day i had to go down
[49:33] i had a little cousin of mine like 26
[49:35] years old he'd get to worry he was bad
[49:39] doing heroin and meth and stuff and kind
[49:40] of got off that and you know just gave
[49:43] him real bad uh alcoholic and everything
[49:45] and somehow another he fell hit his head
[49:48] and killed him you know what at odds you
[49:50] know i'm saying you know we never know
[49:52] in our life you know and all what god's
[49:54] brought me through in my life you know i
[49:56] should have been dead a million times
[49:58] over you know but you know and i i ended
[50:00] up my brother they ended up letting him
[50:02] release come down from prison i end up
[50:04] taking him back to louisville but it was
[50:06] kind of a weird experience on the way
[50:08] home the lord just started dealing with
[50:10] me man and it was just overwhelming
[50:13] experience i had with the lord that
[50:14] night but it was like i could see
[50:16] you know
[50:17] where
[50:20] i would have been dead or in prison if
[50:22] it wasn't for the grace of god you know
[50:24] that was me and i just began you know
[50:26] crying in the lord you know because it
[50:28] was just like man that was me and i
[50:30] don't even remember hearing this
[50:32] and brother joe said it the other night
[50:34] i don't even remember hearing the song i
[50:36] guess it's a song but i was like you
[50:37] know i was just crying man i'm crying
[50:39] out to god and i'm just like you know uh
[50:41] i want to cry out to you i don't want to
[50:42] rock crying out for me i want to cry out
[50:44] to the rock you know i just thought that
[50:45] was awesome hearing you say it you know
[50:47] i even heard it and i think it is a song
[50:49] but you know
[50:50] but
[50:51] and then the other day i
[50:53] had heard this song and shared it and
[50:54] said
[50:55] uh you gotta fall to fly and it wound up
[50:58] going on and it was it was going on in
[51:00] the song it was talking about a mother
[51:02] eagle pushing the little eaglets out as
[51:04] the eaglets are falling towards the
[51:05] rocks you know they're falling down and
[51:07] that little the mama eagle swoop up and
[51:09] put them on their wings you know and uh
[51:11] i had a little bible study going for
[51:13] these guys we're doing up here every
[51:15] monday and uh as we was getting in there
[51:17] the topic was on abraham and and having
[51:19] to sacrifice isaac and they start
[51:21] talking this and that and he was like
[51:22] something came to me and got a little
[51:23] revelation there you know the natural
[51:25] forerunning the spiritual i sing that
[51:27] song again and it was just making me
[51:29] think i say you know it was like god
[51:31] built abraham up to be able to have the
[51:33] faith about to know that even if he
[51:35] didn't he would be able to raise him up
[51:37] you know god gave him to me but raise
[51:38] him up but he lifted his faith and that
[51:40] made me think about you know us trusting
[51:42] in our wings that god's done gave us as
[51:44] we start swooping down he trains us and
[51:46] gets us to where we can trust in what
[51:48] he's done gave us praise god you know
[51:50] and uh i just thought that was awesome
[51:52] because that was just you know that
[51:53] little bit of inspiration just get you
[51:54] fired up you know think about the lord
[51:56] you know
[51:57] but it got me just thinking more of that
[51:59] victory and that trust in the lord it's
[52:01] awesome just being the bride of christ
[52:02] you know we all have these signs and
[52:04] wonders and things all around us we're
[52:06] so blessed to see you know uh brother
[52:08] branham and his ministry and see it and
[52:10] believe it you know i should just give
[52:11] us more all something to shout about his
[52:13] mercy and grace we found favor with the
[52:15] lord you know it's just it's i was
[52:17] thinking i'm like let's just all start
[52:18] shouting let's just i'll start pulling
[52:20] on the lord more that's why i was trying
[52:21] to serve the group up let's just pass
[52:22] the mic just praise god lift him up you
[52:24] know and uh
[52:26] i'm like this message you know of jesus

[52:29] it's awesome you know to be a part of it
[52:31] truly we're
[52:32] blessed chosen people you know it's
[52:34] given us something to shout about
[52:36] and you know as i'm sharing with family
[52:38] and friends you know and exercising them
[52:39] faith muscles like i said as we're
[52:41] sharing and digging in the word and we
[52:43] find our indifferences you know with
[52:45] different people and things you know
[52:46] it's like uh
[52:48] we was talking to a nightmare in a buddy
[52:49] of mine you know and it's just like you
[52:51] know as you start saying that you know
[52:53] we're just a continuation of the book of
[52:54] acts you know we should be seeing these
[52:56] signs these wonders of gifts of healing
[52:58] deliverance salvation all these things
[53:00] we should see here being baptized with a
[53:03] field full of the holy ghost you know
[53:04] just like they had in the first church
[53:06] we should have it now we should be able
[53:07] to lift them up you know
[53:09] and uh
[53:11] but more i dig in there the more more
[53:13] faith that god gives me you know it's
[53:15] like
[53:16] the message of the hour it's just got us
[53:18] more personal more in a deeper
[53:20] relationship you know what the lord this
[53:22] bride does you know he's restoring the
[53:24] power in the church and you know to help
[53:26] us soar higher you know and
[53:29] by the grace of god it's just a
[53:30] testimony in itself to even see it you
[53:32] know because you start witnessing it to
[53:34] anybody and talking with people i just
[53:36] heard i just heard a minister say
[53:38] brother branham said that uh the three
[53:41] or the three things i remember two of
[53:42] them the three things he's gonna bring
[53:44] in the armageddon he said the trinity
[53:47] rock and roll music he was typing rock
[53:49] and roll music with worldliness and
[53:51] worldliness he said now that was 1965.
[53:54] you can look now it's all into all the
[53:56] stuff you know with you know social
[53:59] media all these things you know i mean
[54:01] everything's fine as long as you can
[54:02] control it but you know what i'm saying
[54:04] and and i have buddies and stuff that
[54:07] you know want to art theologian
[54:09] basically and that was a bible front and
[54:11] back and they argued at their blood in
[54:12] the face and looked right over in the
[54:14] name of jesus christ you know
[54:16] but anyway i got off on a little tangent
[54:19] third uh
[54:21] i think i might have skipped over
[54:23] something i might get lucky
[54:26] but uh
[54:30] anyway i know that we're all in
[54:32] different spots in life you know and you
[54:33] know and as i'm growing i want to share
[54:36] my experience strength and hope as i'm
[54:37] growing and progressing you know i learn
[54:39] we learn from our mistakes that's what i
[54:41] was talking about you know she always
[54:42] said she like to have number two of what
[54:44] i feel because you know i'll get better
[54:45] at what i'm doing same thing we should
[54:47] be progressing in the spirit you know
[54:49] and uh you know i like to share as i'm
[54:51] learning seeing what was changing in my
[54:53] life you know
[54:54] uh before i was living you know just a
[54:57] halfway i mean that's why you look look
[54:59] what kind of fellowship did i
[55:01] have i didn't have no fellowship in the
[55:03] church i wasn't fellowshipping with god
[55:05] really you know i have a haphazardly
[55:07] stagnant complacent relationship with
[55:09] the lord you know i was basically i look
[55:11] back almost like a man running from the
[55:12] lord you start thinking on them things
[55:14] you know i just i caught myself looking
[55:16] at that stuff and i see the things that
[55:18] i started changing you know i walk in
[55:20] the spirit as he's in the spirit and i
[55:22] took the old bad habits and started you
[55:24] know just even just being complacent you
[55:26] know like i said it ain't like i'm out
[55:27] here doing
[55:29] drugs and stuff but just being
[55:31] anyway but it's like the more you feed
[55:34] on that spirit that spirit the more i'm
[55:36] feeding on that stuff reading feeding
[55:38] and doing these things and the more we
[55:39] praise god that's why i said you know
[55:40] and he inhabits the praise of his people
[55:42] it just gets me fired up talking about
[55:44] him sometimes you know i'll get it going
[55:45] you know and uh
[55:48] it's not like i had a boy either it's
[55:50] not like i'm sitting here trying to add
[55:51] a boy i'm just telling you what i'm
[55:53] learning from what i'm doing and it's
[55:56] working just blessed to be the god
[55:58] blessed be the name of the lord dig in
[56:00] there on him you know uh
[56:03] and he's the one changing my life it's
[56:05] him doing the work you know
[56:07] and don't believe me believe it works
[56:08] you know the lord i i just want my life
[56:11] to inspire others and
[56:12] and
[56:13] to become their fellowship become deeper
[56:15] in the lord and and deeper walk in the
[56:18] spirit as he's in the spirit just get
[56:20] into the spirit
[56:21] you get once you start getting into it
[56:22] like i was sharing with somebody some
[56:24] basic things the other day like you know
[56:26] because when i started saying you know
[56:27] it's about a personal relationship well
[56:28] then when you step back and think
[56:29] they're cause they're just like yeah
[56:31] so when you start thinking about
[56:32] somebody i don't really know a whole lot
[56:34] about a personal relationship so i
[56:35] started thinking i'm like well you know
[56:37] take a take a 30 day challenge i was
[56:38] trying to write them something out you
[56:39] know because i'm just praying god you
[56:41] can do the work and this time if we can
[56:42] just kind of give them something and the
[56:45] crazy thing was i wrote this little
[56:47] thing out a little and the next day a
[56:49] sermon popped up on my youtube channel
[56:51] exactly everything i wrote it was so
[56:53] crazy that's for the natural forerunner
[56:54] spiritual i believe that's just the holy
[56:56] ghost being right in the line showing
[56:57] you right on track but i just tell them
[57:00] you know simple things you know i said i
[57:02] said try to pray like david did morning
[57:03] noon and night something stupid simple
[57:05] to remember try to turn all your radio
[57:07] music stations to some something
[57:10] christian got to go to a church
[57:11] wednesday morning and sunday morning if
[57:13] you can somewhere just go find you a
[57:15] youtube channel when you're washing your
[57:17] car listen to a sermon i say you know
[57:19] you start doing that you're feeding that
[57:20] spiritual man he's going to get stronger
[57:22] your personal relationship with the lord
[57:24] is going to grow greater and you know
[57:25] it's just something simple like that i
[57:27] don't know i'm preaching to the choir
[57:28] here but i'm saying but that's what
[57:30] we're doing and that's what i was doing
[57:31] and that's what i've been doing and and
[57:34] seeing results just like jim if we're
[57:35] gonna share you know tips and tricks in
[57:37] the gym that's what was working for me
[57:39] but anyway
[57:40] uh you know i started seeing too in my
[57:43] life you know i come to a spot you know
[57:45] if our hearts condemn us not then we can
[57:47] have confidence in god we can come
[57:49] boldly before the throne of grace you
[57:51] know believe in all things are possible
[57:53] and uh and then you come into a piece of
[57:54] understanding that enjoy unspeakable
[57:57] full of glory blessed be the name of the
[57:59] lord
[58:01] [Applause]
[58:14] that's some good advice
[58:16] give the
[58:18] pray more in the morning
[58:20] think about the lord more feed on the
[58:21] spiritual things and
[58:23] it meant less of the things of the world
[58:25] praise the lord
[58:26] i mean i know sister tammy's seen the
[58:28] lord working in tommy she's probably
[58:30] having she probably have a testimony
[58:32] amen
[58:33] but anyway she could tell you some
[58:36] stories no doubt but praise god i'm just
[58:38] glad to see them
[58:40] amen together amen because i'll tell you
[58:42] what through all of those storms i mean
[58:44] it's pretty rough
[58:45] but the lord jesus is uh you know when
[58:47] he comes he comes he changes things
[58:50] don't he
[58:51] amen praise the lord all right anybody
[58:54] else
[58:55] amen all right brother joshua come on up
[58:57] here
[58:59] praise the lord
[59:01] amen it's a testimony of him being with
[59:03] us here isn't he yeah i'll give him a
[59:05] hand so josh
[59:07] [Applause]
[59:12] i thought song leading was tough
[59:16] um i wasn't planning to give a testimony
[59:18] i was driving in the truck today and
[59:21] thought about
[59:23] you know i really don't give the lord
[59:25] enough glory for what he's done in my
[59:26] life
[59:27] and um
[59:28] so i just thought if there was a few
[59:30] excrements i'd get up here and just
[59:31] thank him for what he's done for me
[59:33] um
[59:34] just some of the stuff he's brought me
[59:36] through and
[59:36] where he's brought me to and
[59:39] um
[59:40] i grew up in washington state
[59:43] and um
[59:44] and i was never very smart academically
[59:46] growing up
[59:48] preferred to goof off and kind of just
[59:50] waste my time and stuff
[59:52] and um
[59:53] skip forward to high school i
[59:56] failed out of high school
[59:57] i didn't graduate
[59:59] and
[1:00:00] that really got me depressed i was
[1:00:02] really down about it
[1:00:04] i was working at dairy queen when i was
[1:00:06] almost 20 years old still just felt like
[1:00:08] i was doing
[1:00:09] nothing with nothing with my life and um
[1:00:13] and i just
[1:00:14] i grew up in church i was raised in a
[1:00:16] message family and all my siblings were
[1:00:19] serving the lord and
[1:00:20] i just felt this pressure i had to do
[1:00:23] that too
[1:00:24] but i could never
[1:00:26] bring myself into section to do that and
[1:00:28] i always
[1:00:30] sat back quietly in church and just
[1:00:32] viewed everything that was wrong and
[1:00:34] spotted every hypocrite that i could and
[1:00:36] was like that's the reason why i'll
[1:00:38] never do that because
[1:00:39] that's like that and that was kind of my
[1:00:41] thing to sit in the balcony and
[1:00:42] then when everyone asked me you know
[1:00:44] what are you going to give your heart to
[1:00:45] the lord say well i don't want to be
[1:00:46] like this brother because he does listen
[1:00:47] this and this
[1:00:48] and so i would use it as an excuse
[1:00:51] to keep living the way i was and
[1:00:53] um
[1:00:55] and so i was just i was on a really bad
[1:00:58] really bad trip down and
[1:01:00] and um
[1:01:02] when i was about
[1:01:03] 19 i started getting heavy into drinking
[1:01:06] and um
[1:01:08] i found it kind of helped me cope with
[1:01:10] um
[1:01:11] the way i was feeling depression but of
[1:01:12] course you know the next day you wake up
[1:01:14] and you feel ten times worse
[1:01:16] it doesn't help anything
[1:01:18] and so with that and feeling like my
[1:01:20] life was going nowhere i was
[1:01:22] really depressed and really low and
[1:01:25] but there's one thing that always stuck
[1:01:26] in my heart and
[1:01:29] and
[1:01:31] i would hear the minister saying the
[1:01:32] only thing that would catch my attention
[1:01:34] in church and they'd say what's the
[1:01:35] desire of your heart when you sift
[1:01:38] through everything else what's the root
[1:01:39] desire in your heart
[1:01:41] and i'll sit there and think
[1:01:43] if i could
[1:01:45] be one way
[1:01:46] out of anything i don't care about a
[1:01:49] fantastic career
[1:01:51] or going big places wherever if i could
[1:01:54] just have one wish granted it would be
[1:01:56] to be a true real believer in my heart
[1:02:00] but i felt like there was never ever a
[1:02:02] place i could get there
[1:02:03] and i was so bound down and i was just
[1:02:06] depressed all the time and
[1:02:08] even when i quit dairy queen and got a
[1:02:10] better job and
[1:02:11] and started doing better and stuff and
[1:02:13] bought a car and all this stuff i still
[1:02:15] there was still that hole in my heart
[1:02:18] and
[1:02:19] i know i've sit there and think you know
[1:02:20] you're never going to get married you
[1:02:22] don't graduate high school like
[1:02:24] you don't anything off for anybody and
[1:02:26] that depressed me too
[1:02:29] and um
[1:02:30] i never thought there would be a
[1:02:32] solution to that
[1:02:33] and um
[1:02:34] then when i was
[1:02:36] 22 years old
[1:02:38] uh we had our church camp at bible way
[1:02:41] and
[1:02:42] um
[1:02:43] the ron spencer came and preached and if
[1:02:46] there i told the lord
[1:02:48] two things in my life and the lord has a
[1:02:50] sense of humor i said i'll never give my
[1:02:52] life to the lord at a church camp
[1:02:54] because it's a bunch of hype and a bunch
[1:02:55] of emotion and i would never find a girl
[1:02:57] at church camp because that was just
[1:03:00] where people find each other and i ended
[1:03:02] up giving my life to the lord church
[1:03:03] camp and meeting melea at church camp so
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:08] so
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:11] when i was 22 it's 2017
[1:03:15] and um brother ron spencer was the
[1:03:17] speaker and
[1:03:18] i
[1:03:19] for about the last three four years i
[1:03:21] didn't like going to camp i was like i'm
[1:03:22] an adult and i have a job and you don't
[1:03:25] need to tell me go to bed and take my
[1:03:26] phone
[1:03:27] and all that stuff and
[1:03:29] but then 22 was the cutoff year and i
[1:03:31] was like you know i'll go one last time
[1:03:33] like all my buddies were going i was
[1:03:34] like you know one last time hang out
[1:03:36] with everybody and then
[1:03:37] who knows what life has
[1:03:40] and brother ron um
[1:03:43] brother wrong came
[1:03:44] i was preaching and uh
[1:03:47] it was a saturday night service and i
[1:03:49] talked to my friend before
[1:03:50] and i was my best friend ellie and i
[1:03:52] said hey you know they're gonna have the
[1:03:54] prayer line that night i was like i'm
[1:03:55] not sitting in that tent for three hours
[1:03:57] let's go to the cabin like when they
[1:03:58] start singing at the end
[1:04:00] so he's like all right so we're going to
[1:04:01] sneak up the back hill and go to the
[1:04:04] cabin
[1:04:05] and uh
[1:04:07] and so he
[1:04:09] my friend ellie left and then i came
[1:04:11] after him and when i got up
[1:04:13] near the hill i realized i forgot my
[1:04:15] flashlight
[1:04:16] and uh so i turned around
[1:04:19] and uh
[1:04:20] i hadn't heard a word from that service
[1:04:22] i hadn't paid attention to any of it
[1:04:24] and um i went back to get my flashlight
[1:04:27] and then
[1:04:28] i just began sitting in the back and for
[1:04:30] some reason i just sat down
[1:04:32] and
[1:04:33] i had my flash on my hands and i was
[1:04:35] ready to go no one was gonna stop me
[1:04:38] i just sat down and i was thinking
[1:04:42] um
[1:04:45] like what am i doing like
[1:04:47] and i was thinking i could see the
[1:04:49] spirit of the lord moving i could feel
[1:04:50] it and i was like i can't
[1:04:52] do this again i'd had so many camp
[1:04:53] experiences i was like i can't
[1:04:56] survive another one thinking that i'm
[1:04:59] meeting the lord and then just falling
[1:05:00] on my face a few months later i was so
[1:05:02] done with it it happened so many times
[1:05:05] and um
[1:05:06] and so
[1:05:08] i i began sitting there and i was just
[1:05:10] pondering it and then i felt someone put
[1:05:12] their hand on my shoulder and
[1:05:14] it was my cousin jonathan and he just
[1:05:16] sat down next to me we were nine days
[1:05:18] apart and he just started talking to me
[1:05:20] and
[1:05:20] he was like you know like
[1:05:22] you're at a crossroads here and what are
[1:05:24] you gonna do about it
[1:05:26] and i was like yes i've heard this 50
[1:05:28] times and 49 of them were from you but
[1:05:31] this time it was just different
[1:05:33] and uh
[1:05:35] and so he gave me his little spiel i
[1:05:37] kind of was like yes yes okay so he went
[1:05:40] away and i was sitting there and then
[1:05:43] i was like man i don't want to get on my
[1:05:45] like i don't want to pray i don't want
[1:05:46] to do nothing so i left the service and
[1:05:48] there's a big field outside
[1:05:50] and i was just pacing back and forth in
[1:05:52] the field i finally just something
[1:05:54] witnessed to my heart and was like why
[1:05:56] don't you try
[1:05:57] talking to god like he's one of your
[1:05:59] buddies why don't you just talk to him
[1:06:01] like he's one of your friends don't
[1:06:03] approach him with a bunch of these and
[1:06:04] thousands
[1:06:06] you know king james version language
[1:06:07] just talk to him like you would talk to
[1:06:09] anybody else
[1:06:10] so so i was just walking that field
[1:06:12] looking like a crazy person just talking
[1:06:14] to myself you know and i was just
[1:06:16] telling the lord i said lord
[1:06:18] i don't even know if i'm going to try
[1:06:20] tonight but if i'm going to try this is
[1:06:22] the last time that i'm ever trying
[1:06:24] because i'm not going through that again
[1:06:26] and i was just walking in the field in
[1:06:28] the field
[1:06:30] i looked in and i saw the prayer line
[1:06:32] was coming to a close and i was still
[1:06:34] out in the field and
[1:06:35] something just witnessed my heart was
[1:06:37] like go through the prayer line i was
[1:06:38] like i can't build the prayer line if i
[1:06:40] go through it everyone's gonna think i
[1:06:41] had a big experience and got saved and
[1:06:43] started saying congratulations and i
[1:06:44] just don't want that
[1:06:46] and uh
[1:06:48] so
[1:06:49] i was just going out and i just kept on
[1:06:51] the lord you know
[1:06:52] like a friend and that was the first
[1:06:54] time i felt him
[1:06:56] like a friend when i started talking to
[1:06:58] him like a friend and i just
[1:07:00] and he just started witnessing my heart
[1:07:02] and just building up my courage and
[1:07:04] i knew i had to go through that line
[1:07:06] and um i went through so i went through
[1:07:09] the line and
[1:07:10] i was sitting there and i was still
[1:07:11] trying to keep my composure you know
[1:07:13] stand up i was the last i was the second
[1:07:14] the last person to come into the line
[1:07:16] and i know still trying to keep my
[1:07:18] composure and
[1:07:19] still putting on my tough guy act and
[1:07:21] standing there with my lit bit
[1:07:23] standing there you know all tough
[1:07:26] and the closer i got to the front i was
[1:07:27] like i could feel myself getting weaker
[1:07:29] and starting to crumble and crumble and
[1:07:30] finally by the time i got to the front
[1:07:32] of the line
[1:07:33] brother ron asked me i think it was
[1:07:35] rather wrong it was a little foggy and
[1:07:37] he's like
[1:07:38] you know he's like what's your desire
[1:07:41] like what's your desires what are you
[1:07:43] asking in my heart for all those years
[1:07:44] my i knew my desire was just to be a
[1:07:46] real christian
[1:07:48] and i tried to answer i said
[1:07:50] be real good then
[1:07:52] i was already born like a baby
[1:07:55] and oh from there it was kind of a blur
[1:07:57] and i just remember being pushed through
[1:08:00] hands pushing me and my head my
[1:08:02] shoulders and everywhere and it wasn't
[1:08:04] even that part
[1:08:06] but it just
[1:08:08] i came out of there and i tumbled down
[1:08:09] the stairs and i had clean eggs and i
[1:08:11] was blubbering and i just hit the floor
[1:08:14] just face down on the floor and i just
[1:08:16] began praying to god and just
[1:08:19] asking him to meet me and just come and
[1:08:21] fill my life
[1:08:22] and um and i i i remember specifically i
[1:08:26] really
[1:08:27] i want him to deliver me from drinking
[1:08:29] so bad
[1:08:30] and i wanted him to help my depression
[1:08:33] and i remember from that night
[1:08:35] i got up and there was not another
[1:08:38] desire from that night when i came up
[1:08:41] off that floor i'm at home
[1:08:43] i never ever had desire for another sip
[1:08:46] and
[1:08:47] i i went home i remember and went to my
[1:08:50] closet and pulled out like two hundred
[1:08:52] dollars worth of liquor and put it in my
[1:08:54] gym bag with my clothes and told my
[1:08:55] parents i was going to the gym and then
[1:08:57] going down the road throwing them out
[1:08:59] throwing them out the window cleaning
[1:09:01] out the house and
[1:09:02] it felt so liberal it wasn't no part of
[1:09:04] me was sad to do that and that was the
[1:09:06] part i was amazed about no part of me
[1:09:08] was sad to get rid of that stuff
[1:09:10] and um
[1:09:11] i remember
[1:09:13] sitting there and
[1:09:14] you know the lord has a sense of humor i
[1:09:15] would there
[1:09:17] i had uh
[1:09:18] i bought tickets for a metallica concert
[1:09:21] three days after after the camp was
[1:09:23] scheduled and before i went to camp i
[1:09:25] was like i don't want to go to campus
[1:09:27] i'll bet something will happen and i'll
[1:09:28] miss that concert
[1:09:30] and sure enough i gave my heart to the
[1:09:33] lord and i was like man
[1:09:34] it was on the wednesday after camp and
[1:09:36] for and camp ended on a sunday so monday
[1:09:38] i was just tortured i was like i know i
[1:09:41] can't go i know i won't enjoy it like i
[1:09:43] used to but i have to go
[1:09:45] and i was sitting there and i was going
[1:09:48] to i went to my friend's office and
[1:09:50] and i was like talking to him trying to
[1:09:52] make every excuse i'm like you know it's
[1:09:54] not even about you know they're just
[1:09:56] great musicians i just enjoy music and
[1:09:58] just trying to make every excuse he's
[1:09:59] like bro he's like you know you would
[1:10:01] not enjoy that i don't know
[1:10:03] if i paid like 250 dollars for that
[1:10:05] ticket
[1:10:06] and he's like
[1:10:08] so i just prayed i was like lord i was
[1:10:11] like
[1:10:12] i feel like you've delivered me but now
[1:10:14] i feel like you want me to overcome this
[1:10:16] delivery of some things i feel like you
[1:10:17] want me to overcome this
[1:10:19] and i was just praying and finally i
[1:10:21] texted the group and i was like i'm not
[1:10:23] going and i started freaking out and i
[1:10:25] was like if anyone knows someone that
[1:10:26] wants my ticket tell them to give
[1:10:27] whatever i ended up selling it for like
[1:10:29] 50 bucks
[1:10:30] and so that was that more sting but i
[1:10:32] guess i was paying for myself
[1:10:34] but i remember
[1:10:36] that it was a wednesday night and uh
[1:10:38] there was no service that night after
[1:10:40] the camp and uh it was a wednesday night
[1:10:42] i remember sitting in my car and just
[1:10:45] bawling and crying i was so tore up and
[1:10:48] i was like what am i even doing like
[1:10:50] what happened this weekend i i was still
[1:10:52] in a daze that seemed like
[1:10:54] i said what happened to me this week and
[1:10:56] i was crying i'm
[1:10:59] bawling and
[1:11:00] mad and punching my steering wheel and
[1:11:02] everything else
[1:11:04] and then finally i just went home and
[1:11:05] went to bed and i remember like two
[1:11:07] hours before i was like i could still
[1:11:08] make it to seattle you know it was just
[1:11:10] dumb
[1:11:11] and i went to bed wednesday night and i
[1:11:12] prayed that the lord helped me i
[1:11:13] remember thursday night thursday morning
[1:11:15] i woke up
[1:11:16] and i've never ever felt peace like that
[1:11:18] in my life it was just like it was all
[1:11:21] behind me
[1:11:22] and the lord just brought peace into my
[1:11:24] life and
[1:11:25] i couldn't believe the feeling i felt
[1:11:27] like i was literally walking on air it
[1:11:28] felt like i was just floating above the
[1:11:30] ground and i just began to praise and
[1:11:31] worship the lord

[1:14:37] couldn't stand it anymore
[1:14:39] you know
[1:14:41] anyway after trying to realize that's
[1:14:43] not gonna work
[1:14:45] anyway
[1:14:46] uh
[1:14:48] uh why but anyway
[1:14:50] so i just just gotta go to the doctor
[1:14:54] miserable gun
[1:14:57] up to the clinic and it's closed you
[1:14:59] know so there you go
[1:15:01] anyway monday morning not monday morning

[1:15:15] you're a very present help in time
[1:15:16] trouble lord jesus and i could really
[1:15:18] use some help right now lord if you
[1:15:20] would just come and give me some comfort
[1:15:22] amen just help me
[1:15:23] you know because i had all kinds of
[1:15:25] thoughts of going to the doctor and
[1:15:26] they're not going to help you because
[1:15:27] you didn't have no coverage shots and
[1:15:29] they're going to try to give you covert
[1:15:30] shots and then you're going to have to
[1:15:32] go out there
[1:15:33] and do it as yourself because you ain't
[1:15:35] got no
[1:15:37] hospital help you know
[1:15:39] and so all kinds of thoughts you know
[1:15:41] and so but don't have really don't have
[1:15:43] a doctor hardly you know i've had went
[1:15:46] to the quick care i guess up there
[1:15:48] in elk and several times when i had that
[1:15:50] asthma problem back in the day but other
[1:15:52] than that have had very thankfully very
[1:15:54] little heaven to have doctors in my life
[1:15:57] or medicine so i'm thankful for that but
[1:15:59] i didn't have a doctor to go to but
[1:16:01] anyway and i just prayed while i was
[1:16:02] praying there and amen in an office
[1:16:05] prayer you know it wasn't so long it
[1:16:06] actually come come open and release
[1:16:09] pressure amen and so i was very thankful
[1:16:10] for that and i said thank you jesus
[1:16:12] amen i know you do come on the scene i
[1:16:14] know you do care after all those days of
[1:16:17] of stress and so i haven't had to go yet
[1:16:19] and so hopefully i won't have to but
[1:16:22] and then it was just different things
[1:16:23] different things that that was the first
[1:16:25] blessing i think it was and there was
[1:16:27] something else that i had desired and
[1:16:29] that i wanted and didn't know for sure
[1:16:30] how i would go about it and i went and
[1:16:33] and talked to the people about it and it
[1:16:34] all worked out that i got what i wanted
[1:16:36] amen so that was blessing number two and
[1:16:39] i was starting to rack them up and that
[1:16:40] day on that where's two then it rained i
[1:16:43] just look there there's a third blessing
[1:16:45] right there and
[1:16:46] you know i was just counting my
[1:16:47] blessings amen and i just realized that
[1:16:50] god is real good
[1:16:51] he's real personal
[1:16:53] and he cares about you on a daily basis
[1:16:55] amen and so every day i watch for his
[1:16:57] blessings don't you because i know that
[1:16:59] when you're following in the path of the
[1:17:01] lord he watches out for you and he
[1:17:03] blesses you i know the footsteps of the
[1:17:05] righteous are ordered of the lord
[1:17:07] amen and when a man is following the
[1:17:09] lord in the way that he is supposed to
[1:17:11] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen
[1:17:14] how many believes that
[1:17:16] so we all know young people that we all
[1:17:19] know that following the devil and the
[1:17:21] world and all that it's it's a curse
[1:17:24] it's damnation and it's death
[1:17:26] amen the only channel the only direction
[1:17:28] that you want to go is in the lord jesus
[1:17:30] christ and if he gives you like brother
[1:17:32] josh said that desire check that desire
[1:17:35] that's where it's all at
[1:17:36] amen preachers can't give it to you
[1:17:38] revivals can't give it to you
[1:17:40] you can't give it to yourself god has to
[1:17:42] put that down there blessed are they
[1:17:44] that hunger and thirst after
[1:17:46] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:17:48] but i just thank the lord for being a
[1:17:49] personal god who cares about you in
[1:17:51] every little detail amen
[1:17:55] amen praise be to
[1:17:56] god all right
[1:18:02] anybody else want to give a i like that
[1:18:04] if anybody has a little testimony like
[1:18:06] that something that the lord has done
[1:18:07] for you maybe in the last few
[1:18:10] days or just something little all right
[1:18:13] we got brother troy and brother david
[1:18:14] brother troy come on up if you want
[1:18:16] and then we'll have good brother david
[1:18:17] to give a testimony because i believe we
[1:18:19] ought to have things like that amen
[1:18:21] different little things that god does
[1:18:22] for us praise the lord brother troy
[1:18:24] appreciate you brother amen
[1:18:27] that was good testimonies that's
[1:18:29] encouraging to hear those testimonies
[1:18:31] and uh tommy done texting me and said
[1:18:35] get some he was
[1:18:37] basically
[1:18:39] you know trying to encourage me to get
[1:18:40] up here it's hard to get up here
[1:18:42] anytime but uh
[1:18:44] and i was trying to think back of
[1:18:45] different things because every all those
[1:18:47] testimonies are really wonderful
[1:18:48] testimonies
[1:18:50] but i thought you know a lot of times
[1:18:53] especially me i don't thank him for the
[1:18:55] little things enough
[1:18:57] just just to have good health a good
[1:18:59] healthy family
[1:19:01] a job
[1:19:03] and most of all salvation
[1:19:06] and to to get to have a good church
[1:19:08] family a good church to go to a good
[1:19:10] pastor
[1:19:11] and then uh you know
[1:19:15] where i don't know where i would be
[1:19:16] without the message of the hour what god
[1:19:18] did in this age
[1:19:21] but uh those are all things i'm very
[1:19:23] very thankful for and then
[1:19:25] when brother tom was given this his
[1:19:27] testimony there and then
[1:19:30] this little thing popped in my head
[1:19:32] because
[1:19:32] i'm a little forgetful sometimes but
[1:19:35] i just thought of this how thomas saying
[1:19:37] that he helps us in so many things and
[1:19:39] he does
[1:19:40] so many times to go along in the day
[1:19:43] and you know the lord does little
[1:19:44] blessings for you that
[1:19:46] you i just have to stop and and thank
[1:19:48] him for
[1:19:49] well this was one and it's one of those
[1:19:51] unexpected ones this was when we were in
[1:19:53] florida and uh
[1:19:55] we were in the ocean and i was with zoe
[1:19:58] and paul there
[1:19:59] and the waves were coming in
[1:20:01] and we were having a good time and uh
[1:20:03] the waves uh i was about wave level and
[1:20:06] it hit me right in the face and knocked
[1:20:08] my glasses off and i never realized it
[1:20:10] uh for just maybe a couple seconds there
[1:20:13] and zoe and paul said you're glad dad
[1:20:15] your glasses are gone
[1:20:17] well
[1:20:18] i had this experience years ago in
[1:20:21] canada when i went on a trip there and
[1:20:23] and i lost my glasses in the lake and i
[1:20:25] was without glasses for
[1:20:27] uh well at least a week i think
[1:20:29] so i started screaming and yelling at my
[1:20:31] kids there well look for those glasses
[1:20:34] and so they start to look for him and
[1:20:36] and i start feeling for him because you
[1:20:37] can't see nothing it's it's
[1:20:40] got to be above waist level probably you
[1:20:42] can't see nothing and then i said i'll
[1:20:46] get a little
[1:20:47] uh
[1:20:48] yelling sometimes at my kids so i said
[1:20:50] i said
[1:20:51] i start don't look for him i said feel
[1:20:54] for him start feeling for him
[1:20:56] and so i was feeling for him diving down
[1:20:58] feeling for him and then it wasn't maybe
[1:21:02] uh maybe two minutes later paul kicked
[1:21:05] him with his foot
[1:21:06] and so the lord gave me my glasses back
[1:21:09] robin had lost her sunglasses
[1:21:12] maybe the day before and they never came
[1:21:14] back and then on the on the shore there
[1:21:16] you could see where a bunch of
[1:21:17] sunglasses done washed up on the shore
[1:21:19] from long time ago so
[1:21:22] it was a little thing but it's
[1:21:24] throughout the week and month and the
[1:21:27] different days that god blesses me so
[1:21:30] much with those little things
[1:21:32] that
[1:21:33] just wouldn't i don't believe happened
[1:21:35] you know without god doing those things
[1:21:37] for us so it was just extra blessing and
[1:21:40] and i'm just thankful to be able to to
[1:21:42] say something good about my lord up here
[1:21:44] so appreciate it
[1:21:46] [Applause]
[1:21:52] amen i believe in seeing god in the
[1:21:55] little things

[1:25:28] thank the lord for um lining me up a job
[1:25:31] uh this past week i went to arizona and
[1:25:34] i went to a couple shops and
[1:25:36] the lady wanted to hire me on the spot

[1:25:41] everything will be lined up for me to
[1:25:42] start work when i move like the week
[1:25:44] after
[1:25:45] so i was just really thankful for that
[1:25:46] it was a weight off my mind and just
[1:25:48] wanted to praise the lord and also
[1:25:51] a litter of my puppies was attacked by
[1:25:53] another female and none of them were
[1:25:56] killed
[1:25:57] but some of them were hurt so
[1:26:00] i would like to ask for prayer that all

[1:26:08] and i'll tell you what dog gets hurt he
[1:26:10] tears you up
[1:26:12] here
[1:26:18] well actually i'm helping zoe with a
[1:26:20] little testimony uh
[1:26:22] i'll let her read we have the quote uh
[1:26:24] screenshot here it's just real short but
[1:26:27] i had a little situation in the middle
[1:26:29] of the night where you know listening to
[1:26:31] a message and you have something on your
[1:26:32] heart and
[1:26:33] like the lord will just have brother
[1:26:34] brandon say it like
[1:26:36] so directly to you that you know it was
[1:26:38] for you
[1:26:40] and so we had a little situation with
[1:26:42] her when a couple weeks ago
[1:26:44] she had woke she kind of started getting
[1:26:46] a little sick and then she woke up in
[1:26:47] the morning before everyone i was
[1:26:49] already awake and she just felt so
[1:26:52] terrible i could tell
[1:26:53] in her face she did not feel good so she
[1:26:55] sat down beside me
[1:26:57] and laid her head down on me and covered
[1:26:59] up with a blanket and i was already
[1:27:01] listening to a message and brother
[1:27:03] brandon started praying and then she was
[1:27:05] going to read you the little part that
[1:27:06] he
[1:27:07] prayed and she looked at me and said mom
[1:27:11] brother ram just prayed for me
[1:27:14] you want to read it
[1:27:16] i see two little afflicted
[1:27:19] children sitting here tonight little boy
[1:27:22] and a little girl sitting in wheelchairs
[1:27:24] another little girl laying across her
[1:27:26] mother's lap with a blanket over
[1:27:29] and she said that was for her and you
[1:27:32] know i don't know why the lord sent that
[1:27:33] to her just to encourage her but we were
[1:27:36] so thankful so
[1:27:42] amen hearing that at that time that's
[1:27:45] enough to get your faith
[1:27:47] to
[1:27:50] jump
[1:27:51] up and reach out that way he really does
[1:27:54] amen praise the lord
[1:27:58] amen anybody held any anybody else have
[1:28:01] any little experiences they'd like to
[1:28:03] share
[1:28:04] amen
[1:28:06] all right sister bae
[1:28:18] so the other day i was praying and i
[1:28:21] always
[1:28:22] have
[1:28:23] felt sort of envious towards adam and
[1:28:25] eve because they had every evening in
[1:28:27] the cool of the evening god would come
[1:28:29] and talk to them personally
[1:28:31] and i thought you know that they had
[1:28:34] something we don't have they lived in a
[1:28:36] perfect place everything was so
[1:28:38] wonderful and they fellowship with god
[1:28:40] every evening and then it came to me
[1:28:43] that the fellowship we have with god is
[1:28:46] a lot better than what they had because
[1:28:48] he's our savior he's our healer he
[1:28:51] encourages us he lifts us out of
[1:28:53] depression i just got so happy i started
[1:28:55] acting really crazy
[1:29:00] [Applause]

[1:29:29] okay first of all my husband said i'll
[1:29:30] kill him i'll kill him with prayer
[1:29:32] kill him
[1:29:36] i'm very thankful that i had parents
[1:29:37] that were christians i can still
[1:29:39] remember the time and i every time i
[1:29:41] wake up in the morning my mother would
[1:29:42] be sitting there with the bible reading
[1:29:44] the bible and my dad would be the same
[1:29:46] way every evening because he worked all
[1:29:48] day so when he came home
[1:29:50] they we
[1:29:51] table which a lot of people don't do
[1:29:52] that anymore we'd sit at the table and
[1:29:54] we pray and we talk about our day what
[1:29:56] was going on and sometimes thank god for
[1:29:58] the things that we've done and that has
[1:30:00] happened to us um
[1:30:02] i
[1:30:03] stayed in in the church for many many
[1:30:05] years i stay i am christian i believed
[1:30:08] in god but um and i stayed that way
[1:30:10] until i was about 45 years old and for
[1:30:12] some reason
[1:30:13] i decided that i wanted to do other
[1:30:15] things i walked away from god i did not
[1:30:17] do the things i should do i didn't pray
[1:30:19] anymore i didn't read the bible anymore
[1:30:21] i've read the bible twice through
[1:30:23] i read it i didn't study it
[1:30:26] and that's what i found it was a
[1:30:27] difference in that and
[1:30:29] i have rededicated my life to the lord
[1:30:32] and i am so thankful that we have found
[1:30:34] this
[1:30:35] message church that actually preaches
[1:30:37] what god tells us to that we need to do
[1:30:40] sometimes i think brother brad and
[1:30:41] brother byler have uh cameras in my
[1:30:43] house
[1:30:45] because a lot of times they
[1:30:47] they preach on things that i really need
[1:30:48] to hear and then people are afraid that
[1:30:51] and i've i've i've heard people say well
[1:30:52] i don't want to go to church because
[1:30:54] they're telling me things that i don't
[1:30:55] want to hear well that's what we need to
[1:30:57] hear is the thing so that god can tell
[1:30:58] us what we need to change in our life so
[1:31:00] we can become better christians and be
[1:31:02] the bride that he wants us to be so i'm
[1:31:04] thankful for my parents giving me that
[1:31:06] opportunity to know either while i was
[1:31:08] away from the lord god still had it
[1:31:10] hitting in my heart and i knew something
[1:31:13] was there and i kept saying i need to go
[1:31:14] back to church i need to go back to
[1:31:15] church i need to go back to church and i
[1:31:17] found all kinds of reasons not to and
[1:31:19] i'm so thankful that there was a couple
[1:31:21] who was willing to invite us to this
[1:31:23] message church and i am so thankful and

[1:32:19] just want to say thank everyone for
[1:32:21] their testimonies i've been trying to
[1:32:23] think this week
[1:32:24] what what testimony i would give and
[1:32:27] nothing really is just really so much
[1:32:30] burning on my heart to give anything but
[1:32:32] i just want to say thankful for
[1:32:35] one thing i could say is god's patience
[1:32:37] and long-suffering
[1:32:39] because without god's patience and long
[1:32:41] suffering just listening to the
[1:32:42] testimonies tonight where would any of
[1:32:44] us be
[1:32:45] um you know we're i'm so thankful for
[1:32:47] the message of the hour but when you
[1:32:49] listen to the testimonies tonight it's
[1:32:51] about god's saving grace and no matter
[1:32:53] which rock you crawled out from under
[1:32:55] which gutter you dug yourself out of or
[1:32:57] god pulled you out of it was god's grace
[1:33:00] and we all like you said we all have a
[1:33:02] story and you know if if the bible were
[1:33:05] still being written and in pen and and
[1:33:08] paper today our names would be there and
[1:33:10] they would say this is the life of
[1:33:12] thomas this is a life of brad this is
[1:33:14] the life of john this is the life of you
[1:33:16] know and it would just keep going and
[1:33:18] and but thankful for for the little
[1:33:20] things that god does one of the little
[1:33:22] things just a quick testimony you're
[1:33:23] talking about little things god does
[1:33:25] you know we raise flowers and everybody
[1:33:27] knows there's a major drought i would
[1:33:29] say going around
[1:33:31] and we put
[1:33:33] lots of gallons of water
[1:33:35] on our flowers and keep them going and
[1:33:37] that's great but there's just something
[1:33:38] about when when the rain falls on them
[1:33:41] they do so much better
[1:33:43] and
[1:33:44] you know we were
[1:33:45] been praying for rain and praying for
[1:33:47] rain
[1:33:48] and i was down there watering one
[1:33:49] afternoon and all of a sudden just out
[1:33:51] of nowhere the cloud comes over and it
[1:33:53] just rains on our place and i
[1:33:57] see the sun
[1:33:58] the band of sun all the way around the
[1:34:01] outside of our property and it's raining
[1:34:03] just on our place
[1:34:05] and uh you know and then i called my dad
[1:34:07] and i said hey it's raining out here and
[1:34:08] he said that's what i prayed for this
[1:34:10] morning and i said well praise the lord
[1:34:12] we he answered our prayers you know he
[1:34:14] answered your prayers so uh just the
[1:34:16] little things that god does you know i
[1:34:18] don't ever want to take those little
[1:34:19] things for granted and i'm just thankful
[1:34:22] for all that he does in each of our
[1:34:23] lives and uh just i love the patience uh
[1:34:26] to be able to watch people grow i think

[1:34:37] the road than others we're quick to
[1:34:38] judge and quick to point
[1:34:40] but it's patience and that's god's
[1:34:43] patience it's got us all where we're at
