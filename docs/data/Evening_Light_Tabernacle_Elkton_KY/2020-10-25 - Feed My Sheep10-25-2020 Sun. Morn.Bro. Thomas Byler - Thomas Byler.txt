have got a little special treat this morning man my buddy back there brother tommy richmond sometimes he'll send me some texts and so forth and a lot of times he'll be like his devotional that he read but he's sent me something yesterday i really liked i says by the time i want you to come up and read that to the church this morning so amen we're going to have a little devotions this morning it'll be all right better time in richmond god bless you amen appreciate brother tommy what god has done in his life amen just relax i thought him i could get up here and do it if i could just uh maybe not do like i did in my last speech at a best man uh speech i put the paper in my pocket started winging it messed it all up so i'm just gonna try to read this for y'all uh here on the devotional yesterday it said that there's no other gods was the title of it in exodus 2 3 thou shalt have no other gods before me excuse me the most recent polls said is that the top five religions of the world are christianity islam hinduism buddhism and agnostic but there is one major difference between all of those other religions and christianity that is that christianity is the only religion that speaks of redemption in a non-work works-based method the christian faith and belief in the lord jesus christ is the one true god this non it's not a work based religion we know that it is our faith the free gift of which is given by grace that we are saved through islam believes in one god but bases it off a faith off of works hinduism has so many gods that you can choose your own god buddhism perhaps the most dangerous doesn't believe in a god and all but believes you can get by without god as long as you bring yourself to nirvana agnostic is neither the belief in god or the disbelief in god but a state of apathy and some about god all these religions have formalism passed to get you to some eventual meaningful end but none can provide the grace of almighty being bestowing salvation to a group of people completely undeserving in fact the christian faith is the redemption of those who threw the free gift of sinless living back into the face of god this is why the scripture says god is love and all the religions are dead and offer a dying humanity only temporal relief and distracting from their ultimate end the wages of sin being disbelief is death but god in his mercy gave us the shed blood of jesus christ to purchase our salvation by his stripes and we are healed god is a jealous god and wants nothing and no one ahead of him and his place in our hearts are you just following a religion or do you personally have a relationship with the lord jesus christ are you following or practicing or do you really know the love of the living god our god is the only one that came out of his grave and is alive and living among us today and brother branham said take and take on the whole armor of god all other religions are dead their forms are dead there's only one that's right that's christianity because christ is living in the church of christ amen making his word manifest and this he is the same it is the same word it'll do the same thing and show the same works and the signs of matthew 28 says so and by be be with me his army in them securing them think of it the great word general triumphing in us you know that's just awesome man because you know god is love it means a lot to me because i remember after i'd got born again and had a personal experience and accepting the law towards my lord and savior i called myself one day i made this cross and uh i wrote on it god is love and later on i look back and i thought to myself you know where'd that come from and you know i knew there was something in me you know and you know there's something in me that wants to share more of god and i'm not very good at getting up here doing things like this but you know god is an awesome god and you know i was just me and troy and mike and joe and a bunch of us started to start this little bible study over here just a little testimony and i thought we're trying to you know share the message a little bit because you know i've tried to share it a little bit with people and you know i've been told i'm a holy roller uh i follow a cold i've had the books gave back to me from family and stuff that said you know i wouldn't i wouldn't uh read these for the last books on on earth you know but you know them books that are gave back to me now i'm going to share them with somebody else and that day was coming up to the first bible study uh i was really nervous and uh you know how the devil is by the end of that day i better call it off but i got this in the mail that day and it was only thing in envelope there well had a stamp too but it said my sheep shall know my voice you know that was just confirmation to me that you know if they're meant to hear it they're gonna hear it but at the end of the day we're just blessed people by god's grace to believe the message of the hour and has praise god praise the lord amen god is good isn't he amen sister hannah are you going to give us a testimony this morning aren't you amen i told donna that i wanted to give you the mic so that she could turn the camera so that people on the internet could hear it too all right right would that be okay come on brother joe bring the mic up there with you all right yeah i'll bring it down amen and sister hannah i believe it's just a prime example of what the lord has done and can do sister hannah so when i become a nurse i was i actually wanted a job in the hospital but whenever i worked my i done my precepting in the hospital i would have to miss church every other week for the weekend shift because it's mandatory that you do it and so i said well i would i never got through nursing school had it not been for god so i sure ain't gonna miss church every other weekend so i chose to take the nursing home route which i've had a job for a long time monday through friday and it's worked really well and i rarely ever have to miss church but the on-call um where i'm at is ridiculous and so just to give you an idea i have a i'll call every tuesday and then so that's four days out of a month and then also a friday saturday and sunday a month so seven days a month which might not sound a lot to y'all but i'm on call 24 hours a day so i go in and work my regular shift sometimes i might have to work 3-11 i've had it lately where before i ever get home and get my car turned off they've called me and told me to come back um so even if you work your day shift hours then you also have to go back if they need you to work 11 to 7 which is really hard on your body so this summer i worked 37 out of 44 days night shift 12-hour shifts and it really took a toll on me and so i just been praying that the lord would give me a job where i didn't have to miss church i've had a few interviews lately and i actually went back to the hospital it was the exact same thing again that i'd have to miss church every other weekend i just said i'm not going to do it you know that cannot be god's perfect will for me and so i had applied for a position a year ago where i could work from home it would be monday through friday no on call no holidays uh nothing and make about the same that i make now and for some reason the lord just shut the door in my face and i just could not believe it honestly but i just told him you know i know you know what's per your perfect will for me so at that time it just was not god's perfect will so this time i applied again and um me and joyce actually applied together and i a girl that's in the message she's goes to brother joseph hammond's church her name is amber golden she actually works for the company that we're going to work for and i told her i said if y'all only have one position open i would rather just get it because she's under she's the director of nursing so she's under a lot more stress than i am she's actually on call 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year so um she has a lot of those days where she has to go back in and work night shift which is not right but anyway so i told the girl i said if there's only one position i would rather joe us get it and she did get it that's her story to tell though but um so i just joe was just like man you sure have your heart set on staying at home and he just did not he was just really questioning if that was the right thing for me and i just kept telling the lord i just don't see how it could not be your perfect willing way for a christian woman to be able to work from home if given the opportunity so um me and joyce have an office at work and there's just a bathroom that divides our office and one day we was just sitting there i was working away and she started screaming in her office hannah come here so i ran over i thought something was wrong she was like they have posted this job again you better get on here and apply for it so i ran back over to my office and i was applying for it and so i got the job and i'm very thankful that i start november the 23rd and we had to give a 30-day notice so our we will be done and uh no on call thank the lord so amen stand with me if you will all right praise the lord amen let's approach the author of our heads kind heavenly father we once again approach your throne of grace this morning thankful lord jesus to be able to assemble ourselves together in your name lord knowing father that truly we just want to hear from you lord we want to hear what the spirit has to say to the church this morning father and lord we realize the tremendous hour that we're living in the tremendous day and in the lateness of the hour and the sincerity of it all father we just prayed this morning lord that you would just come in a special way and draw us ever closer to you lord jesus and father the work that you have begun in our hearts in our lives lord that you would finish it father and have us ready and prepared to meet you in the skies lord to leave this world behind father and to be able to do like enoch did and that's to be translated and lord jesus before the flood came and washed everybody away lord and we realize that's what's happening we're right at the doors of it now and we just want to search your hearts lord jesus and to present ourselves before you and ask god if there's any ways in this lord that is unlike you and that you're displeased with that you would take it out lord and father just do the fine tuning in our life lord jesus the final touches so to speak lord to get us all just finely tuned and be ready to meet you lord we ask god that which i feel you've laid upon my heart to speak this morning that you would just use it and speak what you once said lord and completely get me out of the way that you might just have your way father both in the speaker and in the ears of the here we ask god that any sins lord jesus anybody has committed that it be all put under the blood so that we might prepare to receive from you what you have for us this morning lord so forgive the lord jesus for forgiveness is needed lord wash where cleansing is needed and filled where feeling is needed lord and inspire when inspiration is needed god and we just ask god your blessing upon the reading of the word now and upon the baptism of brother daniel wade this after the service we ask god that you'd bless him with the baptism of the holy ghost lord jesus as he gives his life unreservedly to you lord jesus and follows you and becomes your disciple lord we want to thank you for each one in here lord that loves you and that loves to come to your house to worship you in spirit and in truth lord and that is seeking to escape lord jesus this wicked age that we're living in and to get away from it and to be drawn unto the father and we just ask your blessing now in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen praise the lord this morning amen amen if you will let's turn our bibles this morning to [Music] saint john 21 saint john 21 and i don't know we'll just follow the leading of the spirit this morning if that's okay on the length of our service and then we usually have a pretty much uh routine on our time but i don't know which way it'll go amen it might be shorter than i think maybe longer we don't know but we just want to give the lord all the time that he needs would that be okay so we're going to give the lord time to speak to our hearts this morning amen i was praying yesterday and i'll just tell you how i got this come to this message and i was praying yesterday lord last night it was actually i'm just meditating on you on the lord and and saying you know i desire lord jesus that you'd help me or jesus that i might feed the sheep amen that i might have something to give to the people amen that would edify them and be a blessing you know and i got to thinking you know i know that the lord cares about feeding the sheep you know and then the scripture came to me and this is the scripture we're going to start off with i guess uh it came to me uh where he said to peter you know peter loveth down me and feed my sheep amen and from there i just began to more and more the lord began to kind of lay on my heart to speak so i just feel like this morning's message is going to be titled feeding my sheep amen feeding the sheep would that be okay all right so saint john 21 um and we'll begin with 1-17 after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise showed he himself there there they were gathered together there were together simon peter thomas called idiomus and nathanael and canaan in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples simon peter sayeth unto him i go fishing and they said unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come jesus stood by the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus then said jesus unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the other side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom jesus loved said unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he gird his fisherman scored on to him for he was naked and he did cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came it came in a little ship for they were far from the land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes as soon as as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid there on and bread and jesus said unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes 153. and for all there were so many yet was the net not broken jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciples thirst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise now this is now the third time that jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead so when he had dined when they had dined jesus said unto simon peter simon son of jonas love this thou me more than these and he saith unto him ye lord thou knowest that i love thee and he saith unto him feed my lambs he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas loveth thou me he says unto him lord yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas love this thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time loveth thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep amen may god add his blessings to his reading of the words you can be seated amen just the reading of this scripture tells us that jesus amen cares about whether we get fed or not amen how many believe that the lord jesus and i was just thinking you know if i as a pastor as a shepherd a minor shepherd amen would care about the feeding of the sheep how much more would jesus care about if you get something to eat or not amen how many knows the lord cares about whether you get food or whether you don't he cares that we are fed amen amen praise the lord so we want to begin here and just begin to think about how that the lord wants us amen healthy i mean just as a mother or a father would do anything to make sure that his children have the proper nutrition because i believe in this hour that it's time for us to be fed right amen amen now i want to perhaps if i could you know over in matthew 24 but before we go to matthew 24 i want to go to revelation actually the first one is in ezekiel all right let's go to ezekiel the third chapter ezekiel 3. now ezekiel 1 ezekiel 1 is the one i wanted let's begin with verse 4 of chapter 1 and i looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire enfolding itself and the brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst of thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and every one of everyone had four faces and every one had four wings amen and the and their feet were straight feet and the soul of their feet was like unto the soul of a calf's foot and they spring they sparkled like the cold the color of burnished brass and they had hands of a man under their wings and on their four sides and they forehead their faces and their wings and their wings were joined one to another and they turned not when they went and they went everyone straight forward now this is verse 10 is what i want to get to and then i want to go over the book of revelations and find out these same four living creatures spoke of all the way over in revelations amen revelations 5 i believe it is yes revelations 5 verse 10 and for as the likeness of their faces they had the face of a man the face of a lion on the right side and they forehead the face of an ox on the left side and therefore also the face of an eagle amen so the face of a man the face of a lion the face of an ox now this is not quite written in the same order in revelations as what this is here or is it yes it is okay the first one had the face of a man no the face of the man in revelations i believe was second or third he was first the lion so let's go see if that's that way revelations revelations hold on a second i've got room five seven so let's work to see where that takes us yeah that's right revelations 5 7 is correct let's go to start with verse 5. and out of the throne all right proceeded lightnings and thunders and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before their throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind amen and and the first piece was like unto a lion okay over on the other one i believe it was second here it's the first was like unto a lion the second beast like unto a calf the third beast like unto the face of a man and the fourth beast was like unto a flying eagle amen so we know through the prophet of god that these four beasts were powers that god used amen through the seven church ages since the time of christ that it represented the four beasts amen or the four peace powers amen that god anointed his church with the first one started with paul irenaeus and martin down through there it was the lion age amen the lion of the tribe of judah which of course represented jesus christ amen we was a lion age and then from the second one was an ox age which represents uh labor amen labor and sacrifice it remember those two things labor and sacrifice is what the uh our our brothers and sisters did during the dark ages amen of giving their life laboring for the lord and giving their life and they were slaughtered by the millions it was the ox age it was the time is what their anointed was amen you might wonder how in the world these people uh you know were able to withstand the persecution and the being burnt at the stake being fed to lions and and you know i speak here but if we had if we would ever see the the atrocity that was committed by the catholic church down through that age it would make every one of us throw up it would be we would be forever scarred if we had to look upon a lot of that and see a lot of that happening to our wives to our children i mean they would take pregnant moms and and it's just horrible things they did it ripped the babies out feed it to pigs i mean you couldn't imagine what they went through isn't that right so that's what our brothers and sisters faced and but you know they went with the anointing that god anointed them with amen they were more than willing to die amen just as a man would lay down his life for somebody that he loves without hesitation that's the way that our brothers and sisters back then how they loved the lord so much that they didn't mind giving good life for the lord amen paul he was ready more than ready to go and have his head chopped off for the glory of god and for the sake of christ it was the anointing that they were under amen that was the second anointing the third anointing we understand through the power of god that it was the face of a man that was to martin luther coming up john wesley coming up and revival amen it was a time of man spreading the gospel and and so forth it was the face of man time isn't that right but the last anointing the last anointing and that was uh people like uh just all of those brothers i can't even begin to name it dwight moody and all these other brothers way back then you know that went out there and and began to spread the gospel with tracks and different things it did it was a man's a the face of a man time and then the last anointing that's upon the earth is a flying amen that's why we call this the eagle age we believe this is the eagle h now he believes we're living in the eagle age now the thing about it brothers and sisters if you're going to eat something if god is going to feed us something i believe that we as eagles cannot be content amen with perhaps what we call moses or noah's message i mean no we can't live by moses's message it may come out of egypt perhaps in a spiritual sense yet but we can't go with noah's message and go and build an ark so to speak isn't that right or even brother bob talked about paul's message and so forth you think about we're living in another time and god has given us another message he always gives us fresh manna amen the bible says in matthew there we won't go to it but it talks about wherever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together amen eagles eat meat from birth amen that's why message believer we as message believers we don't have a problem with the heavy meat of the word of god amen because that's what we like we like fresh kill how many likes fresh revelation i believe that's what jesus christ gives us is fresh revelation and if i don't say nothing else this morning i want to tell you i believe that's where 99.9 of our problems come is that we don't have fresh revelation i don't know about you but i don't like amen i told my wife i said if you make a big old pot of something it's over three or four days old go ahead and give it to the chicken still enjoy it too i want something first i don't mind eating it for a few days but you know after a while you just want something fresh and i believe that's what i for myself that's what i thrive on it gives me prevailing as the prophet of god said he said revelation gives you prevailing power over the enemy so eagles we're living in the eagle age where we have to have meat where we can eat meat from birth amen praise the lord so we want to eat meat praise the lord we want to have a table how many believes that jesus has the table spread where the saints of god are fed [Music] amen it can't be and i was thinking you know last night i said lord i believe i'm in the place lord where you can speak to me amen you can give me something to give to the people and i do realize that as a minister as a preacher how in the world is god going to give me something fresh how can he give me something if i'm not in the place for him to give me something [Music] so that was one of the first questions when they in my in my thoughts in my mind that says thank you lord i believe i'm right with you i believe i'm here i'm in the place that you can give me something and i want you to know it wasn't 30 seconds later that he laid it upon my heart hello they begin to part out and i say lord i know that he i know you care about those people sitting there amen if i care about them how much more do you care about them he cares that you are fed this morning he cares that you are spiritually hydrated this morning he wants you to be a man fat so to speak amen he wants you to eat well amen praise be to god but you know i truly believe that god does get a table ready he's the one that gets the table ready amen brother bam says that the angel told the prophet of god he told brother branham he says you store up this food amen i'll tell you what it may be stored up in the freezer it may be but i'll tell you but when it comes back out i want you to know it's as though it was just as fresh today as it was cut amen start up why because we're gonna need it right now i mean at least we need that meat that god has stored up we need it right now you need it right now to sustain us in this evil age that we are living in the most horrible aid that was ever amen thought of satan in his eden is what coming right down to a financial collapse to where the devil can accomplish his purpose and that is that nobody's gonna buy nothing and nobody gonna sell nothing unless you belong to the mark of the beast the boycott amen isn't that right john paul i believe he says there's a crash coming there's an economic crash coming and all and so forth hey they're not so rough they're absolutely right there is going to squeeze the financial squeeze coming that's going to squeeze everybody amen and i said i had a truckload of concrete come to my door the other day and they don't even want to send me a bill they want to send me the bill over my text messages they'll tell me where the truck is this saturday other than the driver company says by next year they don't want to take your check or your cash they want to do it through a card huh well if i can't buy concrete unless i belong to have some cars or whatever it is that's pretty terrible ain't it but i thought boy that's a wake-up call folks the whole economy everything's coming down to a cashless society it's coming down to where they're going to make to where you either are part of it or you're not a part of it you won't buy or sell and that's where the devil's coming to but i want you to know that god is getting a people ready how many believes that there is rapturing faith in this table of food that god has you and i listen very very carefully you're going to either have this body to be changed amen you might go by the way of the grave some of us are getting a little older we might go by the way on the ground but we had better be so in tune with god like i said wednesday we better have the kind of fellowship with god that is ready for the rapture amen rapture ready the kind of fellowship that enoch had that whenever he walked he pleased god how many believes that's the kind of walk that he's looking for a deeper walk with almighty god amen if we get that through eating what the word of god [Applause] praise be to god oh hallelujah think about it amen let me tell you something you know what i just want to say i truly believe that a lot of our problems come because we are not spiritually eating the way that we should amen because if you're eating right i'll tell you what you're not gonna be skinny amen no you're gonna be spiritually healthy and god has the food prepared for us jesus has a table spread how many knows what he said he had that food already formed danielle he said was come and dine how many of these oh that's right every other like that like by the time he was reading every other religion amen they make you work for it and they still don't end up giving you eternal life redemption or anything like that jesus gives it all to you free and he says come receive it of it freely and people still don't want it well they don't have to get it but i'll tell you what if it's free i like it i'll take it i'll accept it and then no matter if it costs me whatever it cost me i don't mind whatever it is lord that's what i want we're a privileged people amen hallelujah god is good so let's let's just look at a couple scriptures of what jesus said amen about eating and what is truly food because he wants us to eat but we got to know what we're going to eat first of all i believe it has to be fresh revelation fresh meat fresh food can't have wiggle tails in it let me tell you something so many people and so many preachers are preaching from a past experience people are living by our past experience maybe you are living by your experience of god yesterday that don't work for today you gotta have an experience with god today a daily walk with god before we go to saint john 6 i want to go back all the way back to isaiah isaiah 55 praise the lord i preach on this different times i know but i really like it amen isaiah 55 one of my favorite scriptures when it comes to eating and drinking amen praise the lord god says to the people chapter 55 hug whoa oh i don't know it does help he said hey listen maybe that's a trying to get your attention maybe you reckon that's right everyone that thirsts blessed are they which hunger and thirst you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him great and if he's real thirsty you don't have to lead him doing he'll run you over getting to the top amen how many believes that goes for church that goes for coming to the house of god you ain't gotta drag people to church if they're hungry they'll run you over getting in there you can't keep chains on them you can't keep but believe it out of church why because they love it it's the one thing that we can do we can get together we can eat something that really does make us feel better that really does bring joy in our life something that we can drink that really does satisfy amen everyone that thirst has come ye to the wider oh my oh my sister mildred did you try to get a drink out of that fountain this morning did you try to get a drink out of the fountain didn't come didn't barely work just a little trinkle really didn't work right yeah she was wanting to drink from what i understand amen and we were wondering well why well we got the baptism around her so y'all might not want to use the bathroom we're trying to get a drink it's going to be pretty low water for a while right but anyway that's right when you turn that it isn't just a little god says come to the water amen there's a gusher of water amen it might not work out at the phone right now but i want you to know that god has water for you if you're thirsty this morning god has water for you but if you're not thirsty you're not gonna drink you're just gonna sit depends there if you're thirsty do you realize this morning that a preacher in order to get something from god he has to get away in a secret place and he has begun to go down in his soul he has to begin to dig deep and say god here i am help me more to get something from you lord here i am lord and begin to dig down deep let me tell you i thought that's right that applies for me and it all supplies for the congregation if you want something from god if you want more of god you better go down and begin to search your soul and to get a little more serious about the whole thing and when you get real serious about it i want you to know god will come and do something but as long as you ain't got the sincerity that you're supposed to have you won't get anything we got to give our sincere about it we got to dig deep begin to say god here i am i gotta have more i want more that's what god's looking for perseverance desperation you ain't going to get nothing from god being lukewarm happy go daisy lazy so if you want more god you got to dig a little deeper i gotta dig a little deeper amen because i want you to know he says come ye to the waters if you don't have a dime you have a palm on the street huh it don't matter calm yeah oh my what does it say i'm it just comes to mind last chapter last chapter of the bible one two three four fifth verse from the final scriptures of the whole thing he says the spirit and the bride say come come come come come amen notice what he says this just comes to mind we have no money come yet let's make a deal amen you give me of yourself and i will fill you up you empty out and i'll fill you up the problem is we don't want to feel yeah amen come and let him that heareth say come as the lord do we have any that are hearing what do you say if you hear it then say to others come people let him that is the thirst come oh my come unto me oh you were weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest amen all that come unto me i will in no wise cometh out amen tell me believes the lord spirit is calling for people to come like i said wednesday you know you want how many wants a closer fellowship with almighty god sure we all raise our hands but yet god once said he's more more serious about it than what we are about wanting a deeper fellowship with us a daily walk now at the end of the service perhaps if i don't get to it first and mess my message all up i want to tell you some of the symptoms some of the things that you can tell whether or not you have properly fed on the word of god amen i mean if we're going to believe that we're eating on the word of god there's going to be things that show that we truly are amen again let him come amen come yay and all that's our thirst come now notice he says come by and eat yeah come buy wine and milk without money and without price amen praise the lord wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread jesus said in the red letters he says you know labor not for the meat that perishes but labor for the meat that lasts unto everlasting life praise the lord now notice wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat that but it is good that your and let your soul delight itself in go ahead i can't hear you fatness if you hear that oh the terrible word fat oh fat none of us like that word oh no it's a horrible word but now when it comes to spiritual he says let your soul delight itself in fatness praise the lord hallelujah now we go to saint don let's see what jesus said here [Music] i've got wrote down here verse 26 well right here it is jesus in chapter 6 of saint john and verse 26 jesus answered him and said verily i say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you didn't eat the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perishes but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath the father seal amen now verse 32 then jesus said unto them verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven let me ask you some how many knows that this this eating of bread this eating of food and this drinking of water it is a matter of life or death it's a matter of life for death if you don't eat you're going to starve if you don't drink you're going to dehydrate you're going to shrivel up and pass away amen it is the same spiritually if you aren't eating spiritually if you're not drinking spiritually you're going to dehydrate and jesus says i am the true bread from heaven for the bread of god which is which he which he which cometh down is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world life-giving bread and jesus said unto no notice then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst amen how many knows whenever you take jesus into your heart it brings the satisfaction amen it satisfies you it causes you never to be hungry again now let's go to verse 48 quick verse 48 again he says i am the bread of life your father is the man in the wilderness and are dead and this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die amen i am the living bread which cometh down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world now notice this is one time that jesus was giving them meat to eat and they couldn't handle it they couldn't handle the meat that he was given this is where it begins to tell them something that in verse 66 says from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him because they said if i'm not wrong they said who can hear it this is a hard saying who can hear it and the jews stroll amongst themselves back to verse 52 jesus saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then said jesus unto them verily verily except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he have no life in you amen who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day now i don't know about you but if you'd have been standing there and you heard somebody say you're gonna have to eat my flesh and drink my blood if you want eternal life we'd have probably had a problem you've heard this before many times and illustrated but if it was your first time hearing it from some stranger somebody you don't really know saying that hello it would have taken something way down on the inside for you to stay with him because at one point point he says will you jesus even said to his disciples he says will you also go away they almost all forsook him because of some of the things that he said how many knows that when we say certain things out of the bible some people can't handle it they just no no no they go away you can't handle it but every last word of god is part of jesus's flesh it's part of god you can't deny any of it amen my flesh is mean indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth and drink he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood now notice how do you eat your flesh and drink your slice and drink his blood eat his sled and drinks but it meant by here's the answer this is how it's done dwelleth in me and i in him how many knows that's why how you take jesus in that's how you drink him that's why we take drink of the cup we represent the blood of jesus christ amen we have accepted and received of his spirit because his spirit that is him that's his body this is his body this word is his body and when you accept what he says he that believeth on me shall never die amen you're accepting the body of christ praise be to god and you eat his flesh drink his blood you have life in you and you'll never perish that's the only way to have everlasting life eternal life to actually be alive because i'm here to tell you there's so many people claiming the name of jesus that are actually dead amen they're dried up dehydrated amen how many believes that dehydrated amen notice and when jesus verse 61 and when jesus knew in himself that his disciples disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you why didn't if you shall see the son of man ascend to where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophetess nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life how many believes the word of god is life amen now first of all let me say this that when you come to jesus's table when you come to church because this is jesus table right here normally when you come to a table you want to have it all set everything is set the plates are there the knife the fork the spoon the napkins over to your right your glass is there perhaps filled with water isn't that right you have your vegetable dish amen and hopefully a good old pecan pie for dessert amen you have your main dish maybe a turkey or whatever it'll be here pretty soon at thanksgiving everything you said amen what does mama say supper is ready come and get it huh or she'll say get ready to eat how many knows when we come 30 minutes early and a lot of y'all's doing better on that coming early you're getting ready to eat lord jesus i got frustrated yesterday you already i didn't know i maybe made a mistake here there god i want you to forgive me lord i want to be ready amen mama can you come on to the table and guess what you've been out there and you know and you've been doing mechanic work maybe you got all your hands greasy hey man she'll say get over there to that wash base and get some of that goo goo go go go whatever that stuff it get it in your hands and wash up real good why because she don't want you to come to the table and then you're not said to eat with dirty hands are you reading between the lines have you got dirty hands and the one rule of eating at jesus table is that you've got to have clean hands [Music] and not just at church but out there when you're going home from church and you're playing that tape where if you go on the next day you're listening to the bible or whatever it is if you want to get something from god you have to have clean hands you've got to have a clean heart otherwise you come to church and you're just sitting there and you ain't getting a thing because you ain't got your hands clean [Applause] god ain't coming and giving you fresh revelation with all kinds of dirt on you the first thing you gotta do is get your heart right you got to be right folks i want you to know if that rapture comes and you ain't right you ain't going to be right there how many believes at first you got to have clean heart you got to be clean that's why sometimes i wonder if we don't come to church amen and we don't get anything we might have our minds tingle a little bit and tantalize with something new that the preacher said but it didn't ever go all the way down in the heart huh how many places got to go all the way down in the heart this is where it's got to go to amen amen it's got to come here can you imagine what it'd be like coming on church on sunday morning wednesday night if tom was in the bottler would never get a fresh revelation huh never get a fresh revelation let me tell you something it would be kind of stagnant it would be kind of old huh wouldn't be very good because i don't know about you but i like with a preacher i don't care what it is just so it's fresh just so it's the holy spirit doing it and not the preacher as long as it's that way it's always fresh we can go back to the beginning in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth hallelujah it's fresh why because it's in the presence of god we know all of these people are trying to say we come from a monkey we know that's all a bunch of rubbish it's all god created it all amen it was wednesday night it was fresh to me when i began to think back of how god was back there all by himself before he created the first thing before the first stardust was ever made before this thirst for star wars ever made he had you on his mind he had me on his mind and then god began to create the heavens and he does something for you folks i'm telling you if you had five hot dogs this morning and a glass of arsenic you aren't gonna be too healthy you're not gonna feel too good you can't just drink arsenic and expect to have a holy ghost-filled service amen everything that's poisoned there's the things of this world the vileness and the corruption of the world and that's all just poison in your system that thing you'll ever do is think about god in your jobs and wherever you are get your eye mind on god focus on god it's the only place that you'll ever get joy the only place you'll ever get life when you've got a consecrated life amen and you love church you love the word of god you love prayer you're going to be a happy person get away from that and i'm telling you there's going to be sorrow and grief and despair amen the best life is a good all holy ghost feel life that loves church loves the word of god and loves to be a witness to others and to feed other people remember jesus fed them and he says now you feed others i believe every last one of them ought to be in the place that we can actually feed somebody else somebody else should be able to say brother i never saw it that way amen that's good i like that huh to be able to feed others jesus was very concerned with peter peter i want you to know that i want my feature and my sheep fed i want a pet i want a bed god wants you fed this morning amen praise the lord i didn't bring my acorns i gathered a bunch of acres brother jeff i'm going to dump a bunch of that maker in there where i'm hunting at you know see if that'll help the deer come but i got some got some acorns out there i don't have it here with me i wish i bought me an acorn but i got them acres and i knew i should spread them out tommy you know spread them out so they don't start growing they'll dry out good maybe i can use it next year and at the beginning of the year when they got on they'll come you know you're always trying to figure out this buck you know you gotta use your head when you're trying to get that guy but anyway that little acorn that i thought about that aiken of course they spotted but listen that little acorn we know that that little acre every acorn it'll ever have every acre will ever be produced for every deer that'll ever sit under that tree and eat it's all in that one little thing right there amen but all it has to do is to be planet just plant it in the ground and then what do you do amen i don't know about you but i remember taking the old meal not the meal but the old horse amen and taking that little harrow down through the garden at home amen putting play potatoes in there putting carrots in there putting this after the other but the last thing we did was get a buckets and buckets of water and that right and we found each plant dump a good portion of water a good portion of water because you know when you plant something like that and if you don't water it it won't grow how many knows it has to have water for that little thing to grow and you take an apple tree amen and you want a bunch of apples bushels of apples all you got to do is water it that's what jesus was talking about make sure these people drink a lot eat a lot why because brother man says you know in that tree any tree it has to eat and drink more and then it's a lot of portion and lots of water means a lot of growth that's the way it is with you and i this morning you drink a lot you eat a lot amen you won't go around looking dehydrated all shriveled up that's right he's the lord amen i'll tell you what i gotta watch them reese's bars at night i like them reese's bars but when i eat them reese's bars i like to eat four or five of them because if i'm gonna adults i'm gonna know it's but i wake up this morning i look not me not this morning but i look in the morning the next morning and i'm all see what all that sugar does blow you up like a toad frog eating bug shot that's right just blows you up why because you're it's what you eat it's what you take in hey man how many has to do everything about us our daily life your walk amen i want you to know like the prophet of god you know that in that tree if you need healing amen just water the tree amen just get more you want joy it's in there just got to water it what would y'all do if i came to church to get a drink of water and that's the only place i would ever drink water was in church well i come up here pretty dry wouldn't i no i have to get water wherever i am my mama told me you know my mama when i was a little baby i had to wait i couldn't hold that cup by myself too early what happens when you give a child a cup of water too early it's everywhere it hasn't learned somebody that was funny it hasn't learned just how to hold that cup give him a spoon you don't give him a fork right he jab himself but give him a spoon after a while and he he learns to almost get it in there you know but after a while he learns how to feed itself amen and some people will say man well i'll tell you what i just don't get anything out of church anymore let me tell you something you don't get anything out of church it's because you ain't been drinking eating anything outside of church you're so starved you can't get in the chub nothing down anymore you probably got so much uh backstop up in here that you couldn't get something down god can feed you if you wanted to i mean the water isn't flowing anymore how many knows that when you drink this water jesus said it's gonna be a well in you flowing up bubbling up praise be to god all right let's talk about meat for a minute let's talk about what is meat well let's find out what's milk first shall we find out what's milk the milk chapter is found in first corinthians the first chapter let's find out what drinking milk is now we know we as human beings we have to drink milk for a while and that right but after a while you try to give them a little bit heavier food as they grow up and brother ben talked about the corinthians church how did paul said he couldn't give him any meat right okay so let's read this first corinthians third chapter verse 1. now brethren and brethren i brethren could not speak unto you as spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither now are you able in other words you're ready not ready for the heavy stuff why because you're still carnal because there's among you and being huh envy somebody else or the way that they are or what they have you're a little jealous of this that or the other there's envying and strife amen and divisions i'm gonna say it a church that has divisions in it is still a baby church it's still a baby church that's what's the problem that's not me that's what paul said you're you're babes in christ there's divisions among you you know he talked about i can't believe there's divisions among you you're supposed to be the same body all in christ and you're divided guys god is not divided hello and being strife divisions i.e not carnal and walkers men while one said you know paul's my pastor the other one says well apollos is my pastor i got a better pastor than you god huh they think that preacher dear following is better than any other one huh are you not carnal who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom you have believed even as the lord is given so he says here as long as there's strife long as they're fussing long as there's carnality and divisions then you're still babies how many believes that there we all want to get to a place where there's not this strife this contention these differences huh this fussing i don't know about you but i don't like fussing i like good peace amen amen so that's just the milk that's just people that are babes and they can't handle milk i can't come and tell you the deep things of god i still gotta tell you how not to fuss hello when two brothers grow up together maybe my boys your boys your children when they're young boy it's hard to keep them from buzzing huh hey my little elena the other day we was riding i'mma tell on you is that all right and they were back there and they were just fussing a little emblem's already saying no papa don't do it she'll get me tomorrow they were fussing and my nana says you know one more time and that's it didn't she she said one more time that's it that's it folks you know they know they don't want to cross that line that's the last line that's it but it's so hard sometimes that they still ended up doing let me tell you when your kids it's hard not to fuss you just have disagreements that was your toy you had it first move over you're sitting in my oh just all kinds of things folks what he knows all about in here he's back there he knows all about to try to get him not to fuss but let me tell you when they become a man when they grow up there should be shouldn't be that anymore isn't that right all that's grown by the wayside we as adults and we as christians all of that should be gone by the wayside same way with the marriage hello with the marriage maybe you fussed a lot amen in the beginning your marriage is out of there god give you the grace enough to grow up and learn to get along amen not to have to fuss and fight nobody wants to do that as an old crab and then you know some old grandma's and grandpa still do it but hopefully that will be you or me amen hopefully you'll get along amen and love each other and say honey what do you want how do you would you like it isn't that right she says no we ain't got to have it my way let's do it the way you want to do it i mean that's how to get along amen that's adults not babies anymore able to handle the meat over in ephesians let's go and look at some of the meats good good heavy meat stuff eagle food i call it how many knows but eagle revelation deep revelation the deep things of god you find in ephesians but man says that the ephesian church paul never had to tell the ephesian church he thinks he could teach him the deep things of god the real things that meant you would have never known before like ephesians 1 we'll begin with verse 2 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption praise the lord another scripture comes to mind if i can find it right quick i believe it's in romans the 8th chapter romans 8 bears this out also some people don't like predestination for knowledge isn't that right he was beginning to tell them where they come from he began to tell them who they are where are they going to be at and i want you to know that's one of the that's one of the the three biggest questions in life where did you come from who are you and where are you going to end up at is that right the two big three biggest questions where'd you come from who are you and if you get those answers you'll be a happy person you'll be a happy person you'll be a fulfilled person because there's a lot of them out there that like the agnostics they don't know whether there is a god or isn't the god and you know there's no hope no future just nothing what a horrible place to be oh i was gonna say even the uh hindus have a better religion than nothing they either think dear a god or that bug down there's a god at least to make something out of something but man to have nothing out of nothing that's really a terrible place to be but both are bad don't get me wrong but now listen romans 8 28 for we know that all things work together for them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for who he did for no amen but i'll tell you what you know when you talk about what i need to do and what you need to do what you don't do what i don't do that we ought to do and all of that stuff you know might get a little depressed but here's one thing sure when you talk about what god has done amen and what he has thought it's never depressing amen what he foreknew for whom he did for no he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover who he did predestinate amen demi also called and whom he called them he also justified and who he justified them he also glorified if god before us what shall we say then to thee things of god before us who can be against us how many knows now that is heavy meat that's real meat and we never understood it the way that we do until malachi 4 came along and showed us until the opening of the seals amen until god opened this revelation of the seven seals and showed us how the antichrist would come in how god's spirit moved down through the last 2 000 years and how these in this end time he'll do his other best to absolutely drown us with world and the cares of life and everything else trying to make us lukewarm you realize that's what darnell right that's his ambition to you this morning is to try to get you to be lukewarm just relaxed not dig down deep just kind of float along amen one more scripture on the on the line of me it's in revelations 10. now it's uh 13 revelations 13 and 8 that's where it is in verse 7 we'll begin with verse 7 and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and the power was given unto him over all kindreds and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are notice are not will be or were but are written whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world amen all whose names are not written amen but what is it those who are written won't be deceived and then it would be so did his leaving that if it were possible the bible says the elected would even be deceived but it's not possible if it was amen billy graham he says you know it's gotten so deceiving until even the elected are being deceived by the man comes along says no the bible says if it were possible it will come to me and i will not cast them out no man plucketh them out of my hands i will lose none of them how many believes that the viewer a child of god that you was in god before the foundation of the world and god knew he says i am the in the ending he knows the beginning he already knows the end he knows what the new millennium will be like he knows what the new heavens and everything like he knows whose names are written who he knew he knows who would and who wouldn't you and i don't not until you make that decision god i want to serve you with all of my heart god comes on and he confirms it with you filling you with the holy spirit giving you the desires of god and showing you that you are a son of god how many please the holy spirit has to show you that your son of god how is it that paul said that if i can just remind it he says now if any man have not the spirit of god he is none of his amen it's by the spirit bears record with our spirit that's what it is his spirit bears record with our spirit that we are the children of god ain't you like that's your son you're a dawn of god i say that to brother brian because i have watched him over the last 30 years and i know he knows believes with all his heart that he's the son of god and his bare life bears out with it amen how many knows that your life has to bear out that you are a son of god heaven and earth will pass away but you'll never pass away nothing will ever move you from being the son and daughter of god if you're a son and daughter of god amen that's maybe neat for some people some people don't believe in predestination in the foreknowledge of god but i believe it i know that god is infinite he knows all things he knows danny would get baptized in the name of the lord if it doesn't all end before we get to the water hello he knew danny would give his life to the lord that he would be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he knew every one of us he knew where each and every one of us he would sit this morning he knew i'd be here preaching the gospel amen he knows your heart this morning how many know jesus is right there he knows what you're thinking he knows the condition of your heart let me close with this we'll get into the baptism but you know one way of telling amen whether you're really uh eating the way that you ought to eat is if whether you're spiritually healthy or not amen whether you're happy or not how many believes the joy of the lord is our strength amen brother man says you know we ought to be the happiest people upon the face of the earth do you fulfill that scripture and that quote where we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth think of all the people all the different religions and yet you ought to be the happiest person now i want to say this this morning you have more peace than any of them has you have more joy than any of them have what is it brother david said brother irvin this morning something about i'm doing so great i need another person uh or something whatever it was it says he was just you know you just don't know i want to ask everyone how do you feel how do you feel i'll tell you what sometimes just wherever i am down and wherever i am there's just so much joy i just can't hardly stand it i'm like man how can anybody not want to feel like this you have such peace that you know that you don't have to worry about death you don't have to worry about there being in the casket you know what's on the other side you know what's laying there for you you know him you know jesus and that's all that matters you're feeding on the word of god and it's bringing joy you feel like that little calf that was fatted over the winter amen when she opened them doors up she come out there blind she or you know this calf calf don't make any civilized sound brother jet they go they make all kinds of great but they just bellow it out why because they're happy because like our children another when a child is good and healthy it's hard to keep them quiet they go outside to church here and they'll run and they're just screaming for no apparent reason but i'll tell you what when they're sick and they're hungry and they're dehydrated that's the way we are spiritually if you're not spiritual you're all droopy and you're all you know they're not happy but if you've got the joy of the lord the peace of god that's a good sign you're healthy and you're eating the way that you ought to eat because i want you to know you can't feed on anything else the holy ghost will only feed on this word that's all it'll feed on we won't get into over in isaiah or in ezekiel where god told ezekiel to go and eat the scroll eat the scroll eat the book amen said the same thing in his stomach it was sweet as honey it may go over to revelations right after revelations 10 and 7 he says john eat the book eat the book i want to say this morning church eat the book eat the it says eat the book that the angel holds in his hand that is open i eat the book and you'll prophesy before other people you'll tell other people prophesy and so forth yes the end is coming we're in the end of the world amen prophesy to him one more time bride the bride's going to buy it prophesy as she eats the book amen then you become satisfied so my question this morning amen with our heads bowed are you truly in your heart can you say that you have such peace with god that it passes understanding you just can't explain it or this morning do you sit this morning and this is who i really care i want you right with god and have that peace but i'm concerned for anybody here that would not have that peace that joy unspeakable that would actually give you joy out there wherever you are that you just about burst you need another person to fill some more of this up with you're just so overjoyed or do you not have those experiences anymore and i want to tell you i truly believe if if you don't have it it's because you lack the stimulation of revelation not stimulate it anymore you don't really feel overly good anymore because you've not heard from god in so long he hasn't revealed something to you in so long if you're that like that this morning you say god i'm kind of like that this morning where i just not had a real stimulation of revelation i've not had a real good word to come from you that blessed my soul so much until i was just overjoyed i don't know it's been a long time since i felt that real peace in my heart if there's any somebody here with all his bowel would you just raise your hands to god i i haven't felt that in a while i want that lord more than anything else i need that back in my life i want that joy unspeakable and full of glory i want that with all my heart i admit i confess i don't have it lord but i know that you're here i know that you're speaking to my heart this message was for me and here i am to say god i want that joy back in my life god bless you god bless you god bless you up in the balcony god bless you be honest not with me but with him be honest he's listening and he's watching he's looking at your heart right now and he is more than willing to give you that peace in the midst of this horrible nightmarish world he wants to give you peace unspeakable joy unspeakable he wants to give you full of glory but he's telling you this morning i believe that you have to eat you have to eat more you have to come and dine with him more you have to fellowship with him more you have to have a relationship him more god we just come before you lord we raise our hands say lord jesus forgive us although we don't have that joy and that peace like we should lord because one of these days we do realize lord that the economy and all of this it's all going to be a thing of the past the freedoms that we have they're all going to be a thing of the past it'll come down real close to squeezing us out but lord we know that at that time you'll take us up god and we pray god that you'll have us this morning as we get ready lord and as we feed on your word daily lord the food that you have given to us lord feed on we ask lord jesus help each and every member of evening light tabernacle each member of your body lord to begin to feed that spiritual inside lord and may they be fat so to speak in their soul lord may they be very healthy lord jesus may they lack nothing father lord bless their hearts just now bless their lives just now with a greater portion of you we ask this in jesus christ's name and then lord also as we are fixing to change the order to service and have a water baptism we ask god that you just bless brother daniel as he gives his life unreservedly to you lord as he dies to himself and says god i'm just a young man but lord i want to give my life to you my whole future my everything to you help me lord jesus that i might want to help feed your sheep and to be a blessing to others we ask for the baptism of the holy ghost for him bless him lord jesus as he obeys your word where do you have told us lord he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned so lord jesus we ask lord that your savior so lord may he may he outshine the stars outshine the sun lord may we all do that lord have lives in a home and a body god that's going to live a living last longer than the sun did the moon and the stars did millions of years from now lord we'll still be in your presence enjoying just sweetness of the holy ghost blessed now we ask in jesus name amen and amen god bless you amen if it's all right we'll change the order to service amy and brother david and different ones i don't know who all you're going to have to come and help move some of these things and prepare rather daniel if you would want to come back to this back room and get ready amen the rest of you just bear with us for a few minutes how many is that there's another baptism this morning it's always good to see this baptism we built amen go to work and amen and souls giving their lives to the lord jesus christ our
