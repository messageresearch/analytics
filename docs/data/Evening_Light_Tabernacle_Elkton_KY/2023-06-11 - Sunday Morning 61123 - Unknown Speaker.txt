Psalms 115. couple verses here we're going to read all the way through Psalms 115 not unto us O Lord not unto us but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake but our God is in the heavens he had done whatsoever he have cleaned pleased they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see nod they have hands but they handle not feet have they but they walk not

that fear the lord both small and green you're blessed in the Lord which made Heaven and Earth the dead praise not the Lord neither any that go down into silence but we will bless the Lord from this time forth and forevermore praise the Lord amen you may be seated God bless you brother Brian good morning brothers and sisters you know why reading those first six seven verses talking about the Heathen there you know they had actual physical God that they worship in our day and age every everything around you you can make a god um if you return with me to uh to Hebrews the 13th chapter I was listening to a message this morning I was just it was called the countdown and I was saying I'm I'm thinking in the opposite way you know brother by Adam said you know there's Believers and there are each stages of their life some are walking some are riding a horse some are riding a buggy some are driving a car some are flying an airplane but where we're at today as Christians you're all supposed to be a bunch of astronauts and I was just thinking you know once you get on that rocket ship and once you commit there's no going back you're either going into space or you're going in a flame of Glory in a ball of fire there's no stopping it once you commit there's no going back and that's the way it is with a Christian you can't go back in those ages anymore you just got to keep going forward but I was just going to read this 13th chapter here and I was just thinking the age that we're even talking about the things they do out in the world really is this is a place for but you can just know that it's a deprived world the brave world out there and it's not going to get any better and when I was thinking about acceleration is as a Christian in a heart's work accelerating toward a Rapture going into the presence of a living God and the world is acceptable Direction and like brother Bradham said you as we go further and further to that time things just happen quicker and quicker and quicker and quicker and before you know it you'll be on the other side but the world is going the wrong direction it's going in a fast pace too and I I'm not going to mention the things they do but who would ever thought in the year 2023 and then I was thinking sometimes we get so accustomed to the things that are going on around us we don't realize that how depraved it really is I was just thinking if you brought a a preacher from maybe the late 1700s or early 1800s and you brought them into this day and age he would he wouldn't have very nice things to say about the church and the world the state it is because he's not in this environment he's coming out of that environment into this environment so he would see it probably in more clear away than we would see it today and but as a Christian as a believer in the message you have a clearer eye you have the ability you have a clear Focus where you can see through the depravity of the age and you know where we're at so there's no excuses for us as Believers that we're not doing what God wants us to do in the age that we're living in and I'll just read this 13th chapter of Hebrews here foreign and all the depths of the Mysteries that are in brother Brown continually brings you back to the foundation brings you back to simple principles of Faith love in your brothers and sisters loving your God doing what's right whether it hurts you or not just simple things but I'll just read what Paul had to say here let brother we love continue to be be not forgetful to entrain strangers for their body some have an entertain angels unaware remember them that are in bonds and are bound with them and them which suffer adversity and then being yourselves also in the body marriage is an honorable and all in the bed undefiable whoremongers and adulterers God will judge you know you read a scripture like that and you think of the world we're in right now there's no hope outside of the the scriptures and let your conversation be without covetedness and you can take a word like that uh and you can that's the age it's a coveted age everybody wants what everyone else has in the age that we live in right now they're not satisfied with the things that God simply gives them they always want more and but when they want more they don't want more of what they can work hard for and get themselves they want what other people have and uh I lost my place there but covetousness and be content with such things as you have rehab said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man shall do unto me and that's the age we're in you know God is our helper you know whether whether you lose your job or not God's going to take care of you you still have to have that correct testimony for what you believe now God doesn't want cowards a lot of times when you're mixing up with people of the world especially in the age that we live and you're so afraid to tell people sometimes what you believe what you know is true what is not true you might think you might lose your job you know then you pretty much know the the age that we live in right now if you're not self-employed if you're working for a big company there are certain things that you would say that might make you lose your job and goes on to save or remember them which have rule over you and have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation and we all know this scripture Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever and this is really important for the age of this ninth verse here be not carried away with diverse strange doctrines first good thing that in the heart be established with Grace not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein and we have an altar wherefore they have no right to eat which is I'm having a hard time seeing these words here this morning for the body of those beasts which blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for seeing Auburn without the camp wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go therefore unto him without the camp bearing his report for there we have no kitchen for excuse me for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come you know it's really important I guess as I get older I realize the things that I say this a lot but it's true I realize the things I thought were important when I was 20 or 30 or 40 years old you know in context are they really that important the only important thing really is Jesus Christ in your relationship with them and where you're at day to day and you'll walk with Jesus Christ all the things that you think are important whether you're 20 or you're 90 or 100 you know they're really not as important as you think they are and he goes I lost my pleasure again but here we have no containment City but we seek one to come by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips given thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for which such sacrifice God as well please now that's really important you know when you bless people without them knowing you're blessing them you get a blessing from God that you don't realize sometimes you know it's not always doing things for people so they know it but it's doing things for people doing things for others when they don't know that really matters and it goes on obey them that have rule over you submit yourselves for they watch your soul they must give account that they may do it with joy and not with Greek before it is a non-profit for this is unprofitable for you it's kind of speaks to us sheep here where God wants us to be you don't want to make your pastor have to give account for you on that day because you didn't do or he asked you to do it's not him asking you it's the spirit of Christ through your pastor and through your teacher trying to lead you in the way that you should go and he goes on pray for us we trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly but I beseech you rather do this than I may be restored to you sooner now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead of our Lord Jesus Christ that great Shepherd of the sheep for the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in the side through Jesus Christ for whom be the glory forever amen and he just finishes here and I beseech your brother and suffer self of the words exhortation for I've written a letter onto you with few words now now ye that our brother of I've stopped there he's just talking about salutations to Timothy and the other people in the church he salutes the church in Italy but I was just thinking about that countdown message this morning and I was uh I just wanted to read you know out of Ephesians the first chapter I don't but I'll just read these few verses here and I don't I don't know how to you know when you when you're studying you're sitting there and all and you you know you think you know what you should say and then you come up here sometimes you can get you can become blank and that's when you just gotta let go and let God have his way sometimes but I was just thinking this morning in in that uh I was listening to that countdown message and I was listening to how he was explaining how we're in that last age where we're going to be raptured one day and we have to live the age that we're in this morning where we're not holding to anything of this world where that the only desire that we have is to be totally free in Jesus Christ this morning and I'll just read what Paul said here Paul and Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are his Ephesus and Paul is telling us right here that he's not an apostle he's not a prophet of Jesus Christ because of his will when it's God's will that he's in this office and what's your emphasis be faithful in Jesus Christ be to you and peace from God our Father from the Lord Jesus Christ you know I was thinking this morning you know when you all come here even the youngest child here really this morning even the youngest child here this morning has heard more more of the Bible has heard more of the word of God than anyone out there in the world in those denomination they they hear more about the word survive as a child mate can they place it can can they explain it no but there are years here more of the word of God and they'll hear in the Baptist Church down the way they'll hear more of God's word more of what God is doing for us and that's what I'm trying to say we're our blessed people this morning because you can go to churches nowadays that they'll have they'll have their little scripture but they'll spend an hour talking about everything else but the word of God where we're all blessed this morning our whole purpose here this morning is to talk about the word of God not just talk about the word of God but to receive the very blessings that come from believing the word of God in our hearts and lives and I'll just finish this this morning blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blood blessings in Heavenly places according as he had chosen us from before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love so that predestinated thought right there that God was thinking about you eons and years ago and that you're an Express attribute of what he was thinking about that should be a comforting thought to each of us this morning that God loved you so much that he placed you in this age knowing that you would be more than able to overcome the age that you live in this morning and he goes I lost my place here I'm sorry if I'm rereading the same thing haven't predestinated us to the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ and the self according to his good pleasure for his will to the Praises of Glory of his grace where in the hath made us acceptable and to beloved and I'm finished with that thing the one thing I'll say as I get older um I still think of myself I y'all probably gonna laugh at this but you know I'm almost 64 years old and I still think I'm 30 or 20 years old I don't I don't know if it's crazy but as a Christian you should your experience should be that young man experience every day of your life where the youth and the desire and everything in you should be just just like it was the day that God saved you your representation I don't care how many years you've been serving the lord it should be like the first day in the day that you're at right now it should be a new experience every day that Joy you had when God first touched your heart whether it was 40 20 30 days ago that experience should be the exam experience we're having our hearts every day and it's that fresh meat that God gives us by praying reading his word Desiring to see him do something for us and for the brothers and sisters that keeps us alive driving in the Asia Brother David amen your little Lord amen amen this old body is getting old but what's living in here I'll never grow old aren't you glad for that this morning and I was thinking of that and I always kidding I always tell them I used to never think I'd get 16 and I said now I've done turning it around and I've got 61. but you know at least I'm not as old as brother Glenn but anyways no no I was just kidding but you love the Lord this morning and you know we're we're all different ages but you know we're all the same age because if we were in his mind before the foundation in the world we're not a day older than than we were now than we were then we're a part of him what else could you ask for than to be a part of Jesus Christ this morning I don't know say well we could be a millionaire well you're gonna die or a billionaire or whatever but you know what to know that we're going to the land where we'll never go old this morning that ought to make us happy this morning I mean let's and this morning and and final course oh yes so yes I'm a child of the king this morning and amen and oh yes yes [Music] [Music] my veins and uh who was rich oh praise God praise God oh I'm

praise the Lord happily married amen that's the way it's supposed to be isn't it right praise be to God God is good amen thank you all from musicians I appreciate that this morning and certainly enjoyed being with everybody yesterday amen it it's just good to spend time together amen how many believes that and it's looking forward to spending eternity together won't that be something when amen will all be in one house one place amen and amen and we can't even imagine it can we Brothers just how it'll be amen so praise God but we do thank everybody for coming out amen and fellowshipping and amen we just appreciate the Lord giving us a good day it didn't rain this out amen but we are praying for rain now right let's let's start praying for rain Lord send us to the rain we really need some rain amen amen somebody believes he will amen I believe they'll send us some rain amen I can't think of any announcements amen so amen we uh I felt like I had something on my heart that the Lord had kind of laid on my heart already uh for today and that's why I did spend as much time out there yesterday as I did amen and so if you will stand with me we'll just get into the word of God this morning amen and uh feel try to deliver what they'll feel the horse lays on the heart to speak on its on the same thought again on the word of God at the power of the word amen and so amen this morning amen I want to speak on a message I've spoke on several different times but I want to speak on it again amen and uh the thing of it is is where to start but I want to title it the infallibility of the word of God Amen now Wednesday night I believe it was that we spoke on the conditional amen how the word of God Amen is conditional amen for many people there's a part of it there that's conditional and I I'll just re I look for it and I know brother Benham said it and I know that y'all will be able to know that that he said it but and I couldn't find it but he talked about how that when he would have a prayer line and he'd go through and people would get prayed for you're healed in the name of Jesus Christ right and he prayed for him and and they'd go and those people might receive their healing they might not we find out we know that there's a lot of people went through those lines didn't get their healing amen amen because it's based on their faith so Wednesday night we talked about if thou can't believe and and so forth many different conditions and so forth but if you'll all remember this part is the part that I want I hope you all remember brother Brahm said he said but if the Lord ever says thus saith the Lord there ain't nothing in the world will ever stop it I may know that I mean it's going to happen amen when it's thus therefore when he speaks like that it's done amen there's not enough devils in hell ever to stop that amen because it's God's directly speaking it's not on Condition it's God saying something and God can't feel and that's what we want to dwell on this morning and amen and uh amen and and this is touch a message that will give us help us to understand a little bit why brother Branham said that we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth this is kind of to bring that out to us amen and certainly we should be if you'll notice uh should but Abram said should be I don't know that he ever said we are amen but wouldn't it be nice if we could say this morning we are we are the happiest people on the face of the Earth amen and if you aren't you still should be and you can be amen if you just take this word and look at it that you should look at it look at the benefits that we have just like living below our god-given privileges amen but if I said we're living the church is living way below it's privileges amen and in the light of the different things everybody probably listening to different preachers and the things that's being said the promises of God that he made and the things that God has said when you look at that then you realize that we don't shouldn't have to say we're living below our privileges we should actually be able to say I'm not living below my privileges anymore I'm taking God in his word I know that he has promised it this morning focus is not so much on the conditional part but we want to focus on what God Said and it's going to be not only said let me say this because we know what brother bam said about God's thinking that God's thinking is his eternalism Lords are isn't that right so God taught it we're talking about the thoughts of God Amen that they are Eternal amen praise the Lord amen and then we want to look at how we are a part of that word and how that we're as Eternal as God as a word is eternal and how that we can no more pass away than God pass away but but that sounds like a condition to me don't it do you there's a condition amen that is you have to be in a certain place before that before that applies to you amen and I'll just go ahead and say it before I don't you leave church well I wonder what he was ever going to say and that is Mr bam says now if you have eternal life in other words if you're saved if you got the Holy Ghost then that means that you're a part of that that God is Amen in any thinking amen that's how it applies but that's where the butt comes from but if you are saved amen but if you're not saved then you don't know that yet amen you only know this because of it turn with me to Isaiah the 57th chapter review Isaiah 56 amen also I feel feel that say that I've been enjoying brother Danny's Thursday night messages and I know that we've only got maybe six seven I don't know four or five we ain't got a lot of listeners so I mean let's try to tune in on Thursday for brother Danny amen let's get him about 15 20 on there will we amen because I really enjoy his messages the Lord's giving laying some good messages on his heart and I enjoyed him now I'll be the first to confess last Thursday I completely forgot you know because I get caught up and I'm like oh my I was so busy trying to get ready for us the first Saturday and so and then I went the next morning and I listened to it you know and I listened to brother Danny and I guess he preached for an hour 54 minutes I think he said 54 minutes he preached and he realized it wasn't on it wasn't turned on right so anyway that was kind of funny but he wouldn't be defeated and then and he preached it again it was good amen so I certainly enjoyed it praise the Lord that's the way to go don't don't don't stop just because of technical problems and the devil getting into things and stopping you amen I may believe that so praise the Lord all right Isaiah and that's I don't think we've prayed yet so let's pray before we read Lord Jesus we have been taught by a prophet that is always good to talk to the author in a book before we read the book lord so now we're talking to you because we know that you have spoken this is your word that we're about to read father and Lord every time we look at this word it just gives us great joy to know father that we are looking at something that is infallible that is that has no blemish in it there's no wrong in it there's no mistake in it and as your Prophet has said the Bible has no contradictions Lord what a wonderful thing to be able to say this morning and to know that it's absolute truth Lord and father what you have spoken will come to pass it will happen Lord is happening presently in our lives Lord we ask God that you just bless the reading of the word now open the word to us Lord Jesus by your spirit anoint us to be able to minister it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen my wife is feeling good but she has called so much because of this that she has had I don't know what it is but in her left side she is really really hurting in a rib cage she can't hardly move around very much almost because if this decide that it's just really hurting she claims and believes that it's from coughing so much that she stretched something or whatever amen so we'll just pray that she is healed if not we may have to do an x-ray but she don't think she cracked any ribs or anything but it meant she certainly is hurting this morning so remember her in prayer would you amen Isaiah the 55th chapter Isaiah 55 and can we take our time this morning amen we all had a whole day of fun yesterday let's have a wow this morning anyway have good time in the Lord Isaiah 55 and verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and for as the rain cometh down and the snow from the heavens from heaven and returneth not feather but watereth the Earth and maketh it to bring forth Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me Boyd but it shall accomplish that which I please and that it prosper in the thing where to I sent it amen praise the Lord Matthew 5 I believe it is Matthew 5. 17 and 18. think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one job or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled amen let me see I think there's another one that I'll just go ahead and read that I really like in Matthew I'm thinking it's 24. Matthew 24. and I want you to remember that in Matthew 24 Jesus was talking about uh end times amen and uh Nation Rising against nation and so forth and false prophets Rising doing wonders and all these things and uh the car whoever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together to meet the true immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun being dark and then all these things amen but down in verse 32 now learn the parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and puteth forth leaves know ye that summer is nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all the things be fulfilled now remember how he is finalizing everything that he just said by saying heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall not pass away in that precious words God bless you you can be seated amen what a wonderful wonderful statement for him to say that heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away as we speak about the infallibility of the word of God sometimes we in me as a as a human being perhaps we as a human being I would say that it is hard for us to even imagine that there is a being that could never do anything wrong I'll never say anything wrong not even think anything wrong because we are such fallible people we are so full of failure as a matter of fact and you know it just seems like you know I guess just the other day I'll tell you what just sometimes it seems like everything you do you try to pick something up and you spill this or oh my you just try to give you anything done it's just all falls apart you know or I'll try to pick up a prune I won't cry too this will fall down and he'll knock something else down and I'm like well what else it's gonna fall down you know it's just so fallible amen sometimes we'll say things that you'll think oh I sure wish I wouldn't have said it that way to the brother or to the sister isn't that right amen so we're so fallible but to think that there is a God in heaven that is absolutely infallible randomly talked about he says you know I've made the challenge Amen to to the world over he says this Bible does not contradict itself amen nowhere does it contradict itself if God would make his own word contradict that be A Fault in it how many knows if there would be one fault in God isn't that right if he did he be fallible if he would be fallible he wouldn't be uh you couldn't have confidence amen how many knows that that's why I believe the Bible said don't have your hope said on a man you know right don't set your hope in your complete faith in the man because he's fallible he'll make mistakes amen we'll make mistakes so you have to have your faith in the almighty God Amen how many believes that we got to have it in him I like that praise be to God amen so we want to just take our time this morning with the help of the lord we want to start with this brother bam says you know he says you know God has allotted that his scripture from the beginning he says before there was any time he was eternal and these things that's happening now are only the attributes of God's thinking one thing that I'll just go ahead and say I'm just going to speak is it comes to mind if that's okay but you know uh every age was allotted a thought of God God thought of every age now just to back this up I mean it was just to back this up that God has a lot of the scripture for every age if you don't think so how about the church ages how many knows the first three chapters of the Revelation amen God has sent to John seven letters isn't that right in The Seven Ages but the Brandon brought it out by the holy spirit that he was actually talking about seven different Church ages isn't that right and the laodicea age of course we see that he was exactly right because this is that age of rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing amen and so now we see the manifestation of the word of God and light up for our age amen but a lot of time we don't realize that even just as each age was a lot of a certain word so God has a lot of that word to be manifested in flesh in people isn't that right in every age if you and I sitting here sometimes we don't grasp amen that great is the mystery of Christ that but Paul said which is Christ in you the hope of glory the great mystery is that God is in you fulfilling his word Justice Jesus was here to fulfill that word Peter and them they were fulfilling where he said even we are fulfilling the part where he says he says the works that I do shall you do also and greater than these are you because I go to the father so we got to realize that we are here fulfilling the word of God in our age we are the light for our age we are the light of this message to our community we are God manifested to this world the devil tries to hide that by your faults by your failures by how you think well I'm nobody I I am if I was a guy but yeah God is using you because remember brother bam says the devil ain't got nobody to work for through unless he has somebody to work soon it's the same way with God he's got to have somebody to have his hands somebody to be his feet somebody believe his mouth somebody to work through oh my when you think about that you realize truly that is a great mystery of God and to think about is if you're born again by the word of God now you see folks right there is it it is that is quite something that is why we ought to be the happiest people if you're born again to realize that you are part of God and everybody likes to be a part of something amen praise the Lord everybody be likes to get part of something and I am so thankful to have bi to be identified amen foreign God's word God's insoluble Unstoppable word now I want to talk about that a little bit amen praise the Lord so we find out that even the brother Benham said that in his discernment when he would go forth and he would discern the thoughts and peoples of hearts for years and years and years amen and he's challenged anybody to come and ever prove that that was ever wrong is that right all right that discernment was never was that wrong it was always correct amen because brother Brandon wasn't operating himself you know I believe in Monks the Pentecostals it can happen amongst message people it can happen amongst preachers that we get these unctions and we get these feelings and we get these thoughts and we might say something we might do something and we felt like it was that and we'll find that it was absolutely wrong amen that's right because you can't go by feelings and things like that those will sometimes Lead You astray sometimes they'll be wrong amen and even the Pentecostals were doing it then he says you know but when he would see a vision and when he would see that that would be different that's not just going by his feeling that was God operating amen praise the Lord when God said that listen and so with God's thoughts and his his word is so far above ours because the devil and your thoughts it'll try to put fear on you then well you won't succeed or or you'll never make it this that the other those are the thoughts that you might have God's thoughts are is that you've already made it how many believe that you've already made it if you ever made it praise the Lord amen so we see that this Bible is uh in God and his foreknowledge now thinking on the way driving here and I tried to put it in my phone right quick because I thought you know new things happen to us you know whenever something good happens somebody offers us a good job or oh a young man finds his girlfriend oh my they'll just be all happy you know mine you know it's just a new thing and top of the world or whatever it might be and or whatever it might be you know new things happen we get excited because of the new things but you know we've got nothing is nothing he doesn't live on that excitement God Lives by love he is love and and he and nothing surprises him there's not like all this happened oh my where did that come from amen how many knows that God knows all things and and and it's like well let me just try to express to you what it's really like with God it's like uh God is building or we let's say we or you I know Mike and Grace plan on building a house and they'll have a house planning and and on this house plan there'll be uh all right here's here's the layout of the foundation right here here's the footer you know and and over here is the joist and so forth the beams you know that's gonna have to be supporting walls and that you have to under have to have down in your foundation and and the next one it'll have uh your walls and you all lay out your floor plan layout plan the floor plan it'll have the rafter plan it'll help the roof plan it'll have the kitchen plan it'll have a crown mold plant it'll have all these different things and and and everything will be on paper amen it'll all be pre-planned how many knows where the man probably preach you know that it's all this is all been pre-planned by God God has pre-planned it well I'll tell you what we I wouldn't last long in the Amish or Mennonite church right now because they don't believe in that pre-planned stuff and the god that hadn't of anyone who knew everything and he you know before he ever started it was already all done now let me get you to concede correctly in your mind when I say it was all done it was all done in his mind isn't that right he already had it all when I go to the building something most of the times I don't have a plan like that little building your side that the plan it was a floor was there and I put four walls on it and I put a little foundation on it didn't take much planning but I did have a mental conception hey this is what I want this is hard not to be you know but with God eight minutes already all on paper how many believes it's all on paper whoa you know the thing that makes me hooting and holler is to find out that you are included on the good side of this if you can believe that you're on the part of the redeemed that you're on the part that gets saved you're on the part that you're his child you find out that you weren't that's under the devil but you're a Son of God you realize that's you that gives you great joy boy we could shout and scream and run the owls on that to know that you're a Son of God that's brother Brown says now are we sons of God we don't have to go to Catholic church and well you'll become a saint whenever we uh canonize you or whatever to do you know and overrun that no you're now I think now your sons and daughters of God I believe you are now filled with the power of God we're now in the place of authority amen praise be to God so as I was saying it's like a floor plan well in Ephesians Paul said it this way now therefore ye are no no of the hosts oh God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets amen everything has to be built on a foundation isn't that right Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone praise be the Lord how many believe that in whom all the building fitly framed together growth and also are building together for a habitation of God through the spirit so it's truly God is building his people God built Jesus Christ when he spoke to Mary amen she received the word and Jesus Christ come forth and it was absolutely a perfect Son of God he was the son of God it was God now God is taken from that once material from that one in this building of abroad a church I don't believe that I mean we're all I tell you what all fitly framed together I'm a carpenter so I know that things have to fit together I'll tell you what I hate crooked two by fours I hate crooked two by fours why because if you put a crooked two by four that cooking two by four it's always going to be cooking I've never known them to straighten out unless you're putting a door jamb up and you have to have a long short and a sword stud then you can take the bow from one stud and then take that shorts done turn it to the other way and then as you nail it together you pull it together and it kind of straightens it all out the only way I know to straighten up a quick before amen folk how many because we're all crooked two by four is it God has the street enough but I don't like it because you can tell you what if you've got two by fours and you put that most of the time you say put the bow out put the bow out let it be the outside but all the bows the same direction so they all kind of uniform are off difference and boy your wall it's going to look like that when you look down that sheetrock amen but God isn't a perfecting Sage isn't he but anyways all right enough crooked two by four top but listen so we got a fit Leaf frame together it grows into a holy Temple of the Lord in whom we are building together for a habitation of the Lord praise the Lord oh my now it's quite something brother Brian was reading out of Ephesians 1 because that's the very scriptures that I wanted to go through amen and am using I like whenever the whenever the spirit just uh seems to go in the same direction praise the Lord how many beliefs were led by the spirit here amen if we're not led by the spirit here we need help praise the Lord I'm glad that we are with the help of the Lord now notice let's go to Ephesians and look at this look at the Ephesians for a minute we're looking at predestination and foreknowledge a little bit you know and how like I said we're looking at what God does what God does and his plan now um because when God says something when it's Eternal in the heavens it's never going to change it's going to happen and verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with small spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us when we got burned again when we willed huh how many knows every believer Wills whosoever will let him come like we said Wednesday based on whether people want to or not amen and here we know that here he knows already the whole thing is amen that before the foundation of the world even the prophet said he says he knows who would want to and who would not want to he knew what was in everybody he knew what was in them and he could put it on conditions whosoever will let him come and that was going to call out most of them I was going to Cull out most of them because people don't want it Cain was offered it to him by God himself just do what's right and you'll be accepted he didn't want none of it did he Kane's children didn't know what about the Pharisees and the scribes and what was it Nicodemus came to him at night we know that dear Mastery and we know it sent from God nobody could do these things huh but did they all accept him then and Zach Nicodemus wasn't he wasn't speaking just for himself or he just said now I know but I believe if I'm not wrong it was we know we know that our heart come from God they knew but they choose to rather pick uh and be proud take the side of Pride like brother Brooke then said this morning got the revelation of God actually blinded them I never could figure out why people wanted to personally I don't want to mean to ignore Rabbit Trail here but persecute the Jews you know they killed the Lord what a horrible thing to do is kill the Lord do you realize if they wouldn't have done that you and I wouldn't be sitting here praise God they did praise God that he blinded them so he would they would they never done it if God wouldn't buy them amen then brings to thought well why did God blind him then it's his fault then let me tell you something the Reason God had a right to Blind him because he knew who they were in the first place we think well that's on justice of God that's not Justice by God don't you start even thinking those unjust thoughts of God God is there is not a fault in him he's perfect in his judgment he knew that in those Pharisees that he did blind that they were devils they were all their father the devil he said they'd have never wanted him in the first place anyway amen so he blinded them amen so he's he know God how many can say with me God knows what he's doing God perfectly knows what he's doing and I'll just say what comes to my don't ever question him we do sometimes it's easy to try it's easy easy to do but you aren't supposed to don't question God job wasn't questioning God by the random he didn't want to question you don't quit question God Amen even Brother Band thought that God owed him an answer for a certain thing you know for this that or the other he says he don't okay let's go on here according yes he's chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will praise the Lord I mean his will is his plan that house plan that we laid talk he's already got the beginning started I am the beginning I'm the middle I'm the end I'm the I'm after the end I mean he's after then the end of the world over in the Millennium after the Millennium the new heavens and the Earth that comes down that City that comes down after the millennium and that's something how he's already wrote it all out why do you think we rejoice and run the Isles sometimes when we say well you know oh we already know the outcome you already know the outcome and not just of the world but of yourself if you're in Christ praise the Lord what does this do I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna finish this scripture yet before I go over here having made known this is down in uh verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure of which he purposed in himself in other words he come up and he purposed this in himself this was just even another place over in Old Testament who has who has been his counselor who has taught God who has taught taught him how to hang the Earth and and so forth everything he said to Job you know how to balance it amen nobody he purposed names and stuff that is a dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who will Who worketh all things according after the Council of his own will that we should be the praise of his glory amen who trusted first first trusted in Christ amen praise the Lord Hallelujah you know when we see the infallibility of God's word it gives us an anchor how many believe that and I want to talk to you about that for just a minute amen but first we as Christians sometimes you know we act funny we're different from the world we're not like the world be called out of the world God's children brother bam says one time and you've heard this story before he says a little Norwegian not long ago come in and got saved in a meeting and he went back to his boss and he says oh now listen to this d-o-r-y to God d-o-r-y to DOD oh don't worry the god that's what he said praise the Lord I done dot the Holy Ghost dot dot the Holy Ghost the boss said what are you talking about what you talking about I went down he said the church said God give me the Holy Ghost w-e-r-y w-e-r-y w-e-r-y good I feel very very good I feel listen and he said you must have got to that bunch of nuts down there he said oh praise God for the nuts he said you know what you taking all the bill and if it didn't have any of the nuts in it it'd be a big bunch of young amen how many blades it's the nuts that are holding this thing together because this thing is certainly falling apart I may believe it the whole world is falling apart people are falling apart the world is falling apart but you and I are not falling apart because we've got the only thing that keeps things together this is the only thing that keeps things tied together [Music] oh my your mind will go crazy if you don't believe in this you'll get nervous nervous and you even to have your mind I have to deal with that why do you think people put their guns to their brains because their mind is tormenting them they can't handle it anymore can't think anymore how many Blues it's time to think God's thoughts I'm so glad that we have God's thoughts to think amen praise the Lord he gives us a stability it gives us an anchor a rock to cling to something that causes you not to move oh that's what God's word is it's an anchor for us amen let's read about that in our lives God's word is our anchor amen in Hebrews 6 he says for when God let me just before I say that how many ever remembers that whenever you go to a court if you're convicted of something and uh you know or if you go to testify or something whatever it might be you get in front of Judge and what do they do they'll take and they'll make you go up there and they'll put the Bible down and lay your hand on the Bible is that right and then they said do you swear to tell the truth nothing but the truth but the whole truth why because you're gonna swear by something greater than yourself I like the devil don't he just because people put their hand on the book ain't gonna make them tell the truth they ain't got that much respect I don't want to say they might as well not do it anymore all you got is a man's word you have to choose whether you're going to believe him or not my my because that's what the world's got to amen and this is just talking about the word of God this is talking about God speaking amen when God speaks he don't have to put uh he don't do you know what God has to swear by what does God have to swear by himself y'all are smart that's right God swears by the greatest that there is himself all right let's read now and when God made Abraham well I could stop there how many knows every word that he says if it's infallible don't come back boy then every word is a promise amen because he could Square no greater amen when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thee and so after that he had patiently endured he obtained the promise oh we could stop there for half day oh yeah God makes the promise only how many knows God made the promise of Abraham unconditionally you're going to have children like the stars of heaven and then there's a sand that is not there and sacrifice seeing his son as the prophet of God put it he says he knew he was One race from the dead already if I kill him God can raise him back up he already come from the dead so to speak amen and so God Abraham knew that it happened but he had to wait 25 years for it to happen 25 years it was a long time a lot of water went under the bridge a lot of doubt looked like it didn't it but in the New Testament and never spoke of all that right amen aren't you glad that with us it's the same way yeah yeah we cleaned this out of the other and it looks like a whole lot of Doubt but in the end it's all gonna be all right amen so I you know there's a lot of thought let's come in here and just kind of going up but what this is you've got of the past god of the now God of the future I am he which was which is and which is to come I may believe that now let's just look at it this here is what also what is to come how many knows that in about uh well let's just say 24 hours this is around or two is it one at 12 o'clock one o'clock 12 o'clock 12 o'clock noon tomorrow at 12 o'clock noon where are you gonna be where you gonna be on your job crushing cars brother Joe or you know what y'all be on the job what about like tomorrow morning or seven o'clock how many knows if time tarries that time will come we won't be here doing this you're going to be doing that it's going to happen that's the way this is huh that's the way this is that's why we got to be ready and we got to be looking for it to come looking forward to Hasting and coming of the Lord because time is just gonna just a little bit of a matter of time that's what Abraham do be a little patient just be patient God said it it's gonna happen I believe it was brother Brandon that said you know faith is a long-range vision isn't it you look ahead you want to be ahead and and so many people look at everything that's happening right here and and this out of the other and when you look at this everything is going on around dude you're gonna assemble and fall and wreck your bike over into the dead you got to look out at the end you know I ain't worried about all of this I'm I'm looking at the promise over there God said that there's going to come a resurrection we which are alive and remains how many believe that that's a promise of God and that's what we look at that's what we aim at you know all these little things don't worry about these little things they're totally insignificant amen all right let's read on for men verily Square by greater that's right that's why I said the story of going into a courtroom by a greater and an oath of confirmation is to them the end of all Strife they think well that that'll they'll really tell the truth now where is God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the immutable ability the immutability of his counsel amen the unstoppableness of his word isn't that right my confirmed it by though can you imagine praise the Lords y'all hear that told you it's gonna rain hey man raise the comments folks I'm looking forward to that listen so now look so he says immutable [Music] ways of his consoles confirmed it by Luke now the Bible said can you imagine God telling Abraham Abraham you're going to have a child you know and I've chosen how many first he had the twos go Abraham he had to call Abraham out amen and then he gave him the promise just like Romans 8. whom he has called then he also predestinated whom he predestinating he called Justified and also glorified amen you promised the Jews but he said that and then says Abram
