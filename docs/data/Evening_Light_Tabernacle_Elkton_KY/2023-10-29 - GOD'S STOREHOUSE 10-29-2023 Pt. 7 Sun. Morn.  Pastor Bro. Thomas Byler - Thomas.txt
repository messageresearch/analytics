========================================

destroy and kill you you know and it's truth you know everything that we face this morning as human beings is because they didn't believe every word that proceeded out of of the mouth of God and they didn't listen to what God told them it goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve decided not stay behind the word of God and use it as their foundation and protection when they stepped outside of that and use their own interpretation their own ideas what we're facing this morning it goes all the way back to that this morning and then at the end where we're at right now in that last age it's the opposite the only way you're going to make it on the other side is that you put yourself completely behind the word of God there's nothing left out there for your enemy to get in to your life you got to be totally sealed into Jesus Christ this morning but I was thinking this morning I was reading this I was thinking of uh of Ahab you know you all heard the stories of Ahab the bad king in Israel but I was just thinking you know ahab's that guy that just you you all see him in life ahab's that guy in life that he's he just can't get it done he just can't do right you you all run up against Ahab his name isn't going to be Ahab uh but there's always that guy no matter how much God works with him or how much he pushes him and prods him he just can't do right he's just an aab he's just who he is and I was reading at the end here I'm not going to this is a long chapter I'm not going to read this whole chapter but the prophet comes to Ahab and tells Ahab that he's going to give victory over the syrians and uh and in through the through I'm not going to read the whole chapter but there's two battles here one's in The High Ground one's in the low ground and the syrians being pagans well they believe that it's either the god in The High Ground that delivered them or The God in the low ground that delivered them being pagans and God told Ahab through the prophet that he was going to bring about a great Deliverance because of their them being a pagan nation and telling him that God couldn't do this but I'm just going to read at the end and Ahab made a bad choice sometimes we make bad choices he let the king of Syria get away and this is what I'll read what uh starting at about the 33rd verse uh here he says now men now the men diligently oberved whether anything would come from him and did hastily catch it and they said forgive my pronunciations here again and my starving thy BR brother benh Hadad then said go bring him then be came forth and caused him to come up into the Chariot and benad said unto him the cities which my father took this is the king of Syria they're talking about took from thy father I will restore Thou shalt make the streets for thee in Damascus as my father made in Samaria then say Ahab I will send thee away with his Covenant so he made a covenant with him and sent him away and this is what God they have in trouble because the word of the Lord told him to destroy the Syrian host and he just like Saul did he chose to do it his own way and then this these last few verses deal with that and a certain man of the sons of the Prophet said unto and I was just thinking also this morning you know Ahab had seen the fire this is this is after Ahab had seen the fire fall from Heaven and consumed the sacrifice and the and the false prophet of ba were destroyed so he he's seen all that and yet still he's doing this and a certain man of the sons of the Prophet said onto in the word of the Lord smite me so he's telling the prophet is telling someone to Smite him and he didn't I pray thee in the man refused to Smite him then he said on beh because thou has not obeyed the voice of the Lord behold as soon as thou are departed from me a lion shall slay thee and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him then he found another man and said smite me I pray thee and the man smote him so in his smiting he wounded him so the prophet departed and waited for the King by by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his face and as the king passed by he cried onto the king and he said thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man onto me and said keep this man if any means be he be Miss then shall thy life be for his life or else Thou shalt not pay a Talon of silver and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and when the king of Israel said unto him so thy judgment be thyself has decided it and in haste he took ashes away from his face and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets and this is the prophecy on aab here and he said unto him thus sayith the Lord because thou has let go out of thy hand a man who IO to underly destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people and the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to Samaria and I was just making some notes this morning and you know we don't want to be Ahab in our life we want to the whole word of God be in us let me go if you would jump with me to James the 2 chapter and this chapter actually speaks a lot about Ahab or people you know you know sometimes we act like Ahab sometimes sometimes we don't do what God tells us to do and we pay the price but uh I'll just read here from James the first chapter and then I'm going to jump back in my uh my the concordance in the back of my Bible and this is what James had to say in the first chapter James the servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which were scattered aboard greeting my brethren counted all joy when you fall into I Temptations you when you think of a scripture like that it's it's not fun to be in trials and temptations but James is telling you it's through those that you receive the blessings and my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations KN this that the trying of your faith worketh patience and I was thinking that we I was listening to a message last night and I was listening to my office this morning where it talks about does God ever change his mind and I and I was thinking he was talking about all the people in the Bible that thought that God would change his mind and they did and it's no different for us and then he goes on to knowing this that they trying your faith work is patience let your patience have its perfect work that you may be perfect and entire want nothing and if any of you lack wisdom let them ask of God it giveth to all men liberally and op prth not and it shall be given him so if you need wisdom you know where you have to go to get it you have to go to God through the word of God and let him ask in faith not wavering for he that waver is like the waves of the sea driven With The Wind in toss and basically Jame our brother James is telling us here this morning when you go to pray you have to pray believing that God's going to make it happen it goes on let not the man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord and I was just thinking of this scripture here this deals with Ahab Ahab right here a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways and basically I was reading a dictionary definitions of what it means to be double-minded basically a double mind person is inconsistent in what he believes he believes one thing one day he believes the next thing that that's say we all find ourselves like that sometimes you either believe the scriptures or you don't believe the scriptures if you're teetering back and forth between them and you don't have no foundation and you don't have no rooting that makes you double-minded and I was I had some uh scriptures here if you have a Thompson Chain reference Bible you can go to CH uh page 1533 but here's some examples of what it means to what the Bible says about being double-minded and I was thinking of and if you want to think of what a person looks like when they're double-minded Ahab is a perfect example of what a of a person that is double-minded he can't just seem to believe the right way he's in between two opinions all the time but I'll just read these scriptures because they speak volumes here and then 2 Kings the 2 chapter and the 33rd verse it says they feared the Lord and served their own Gods after the manner of Nations whom They Carried Away from hence so they didn't believe the word they were in between those and then Zephaniah the 1 chapter and the fourth verse it says I will stretch out my hand upon Judah and upon all theh up to je Jerusalem and I will cut off the remmen of bow from this place in the name of for my pronunciation here the Chans with the priest and Zephaniah the 5th verse it says them that worship the host of Heaven upon the house to and men that worship that swear by the Lord swear by the Lord and that swear by Malcolm so they they were covering they were you know like a lot of people do they like to cover their BS well if this works I'll use this if that doesn't work I'll use this so they're in between their whole life and in Luke the 16th chapter and the 13th verse this is what Jesus had to say no servant can serve two masters either he will hate the one or love the other or else he will will hold to one and despise the other you cannot serve God M and that's where we're are this morning you can't can't halt you can't have two different different opinions this morning you're either going to serve one or you're going to serve the other if you find yourself in between all the time there's a problem with your experience and he goes on to say in 1 Corinthians the 10th chapter and the 21st verse and this is the same thing you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of devils you know when you think of a scripture like that this morning we live in an age this morning where this this is more than possible with all the technology out in the world you know you can be if you don't find if you don't be careful you can find yourself jumping between these two different worlds and he goes on I just read in James the 1 and the eth chapter a double man is unstable and is all his ways and then James the fourth chapter and the eth verse draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts you double minded so James is telling the people that are halting between two opinions that they need to stay that opinion and go the right way but I was just thinking of that scripture this morning where you know your gospel 44 I was just you know like I said everything that we face as Christians or as Believers this morning is based on that scripture there Matthew 4 and4 whether you're going to believe God's word and act on God's word and believe every word of God and step out in faith believing it and I was thinking I was listening to that message this morning and last night when in Moses's life in Elijah's life and all the prophets all the kings everyone's life that the minute you step outside of what God has told you to do or where God has told you to walk you're going to have problems when Moses struck the rock the second time it caused a lot of problems in his life he came outside of the word of God when he struck the rock the second time and we're no better than Moses are any anytime we step outside of the Jesus Christ and outside of the word of God there's no protection for us anymore so as this age comes to an end here it just lets us know that you need to be under the word of God even more this morning than you were last night and you'll need to be under it even more this evening as you were this morning the only protection we have as Believers this morning is the reveal word of the hour that's the only thing that you can hold to in this age that we liveing and know that it's right and that it'll bring you to that place that you need to be but it's not just the word itself you have to have that experience you have to have that present in your heart and life Brother David amen you love the Lord this morning amen let's stand this morning if we could and amen pray that was a blessing to your heart this morning and amen let's sing that little chorus if we could this morning can't you see why I'm happy amen

praise the Lord how many glad for God's healing power you know I had a revelation this morning you know how brother BR and how some people stopped and try to teach how that the devil can heal and so forth you know and brother Bram absolutely refuted no no no no no and I never really thought about it that much but I felt like this morning I had a revelation because you know if the devil could actually he can put cancer on you he can put sickness on you is't that right but he can't cure it you know right he's not if he could heal he could raise from the dead he'd have the power to bring you I mean healing that's what it is isn't that right Amen to heal but he can't do that ain't got that power Ain't nobody got creative power but almighty God Amen so that philosophy is just completely wrong because if he could heal he could rais from the dead and so forth and he can't do that amen so God bless you this morning good to be in the house of the Lord hopefully you have been praying amen meditating and you I mean this morning I was just listening to everybody as we come in and it it just seemed like everybody was at the very beginning kind of just real lowkey you know and and so forth

have God do great things amen amen this morning amen we want to speak Amen on God's Storehouse God's Storehouse amen amen and we want to just bring you actually whenever I get into this there's like four different subjects really and I'm going to try to tie them together if I can with the help of the Lord amen because I mean it all kind of ties together and so amen but uh amen I wanted to call the first title that I had come up with is the Christian God the Christian God Amen uh but then I re wanted to retitle just God's Storehouse but I want to speak about both of those subjects also amen um so let's just begin with reading in I want to read about two or three scriptures to get it out of the way because I probably won't get to it if I don't read it see man so let's go to the second book of Kings Kings the second book of Kings amen I want to first kind of start with the help of the Lord amen on Amen on this thought of uh amen a Christian amen and his God Amen how many glad to serve the god that you serve cuz there is a lot of God in the world today amen there's thousands of gods amen thousands upon thousands of gods amen and uh you know anything that you put before God is your God isn't that right it's your idol butam says in an idol amen something that you worship whatever you put before God so if you aren't very careful amen it could be your job it could be money it could be popularity it could be be any of those things amen uh and so forth amen okay Second Kings we'll just get started here Second Kings amen and let's just bow our heads before we read Lord Jesus we come before you this morning Lord knowing many places your Prophet has taught us that anybody can open these pages but it really takes you to open the book to our hearts and Minds Lord and so father we ask Lord did you just come once again get me out of the way Lord and use your gift father to speak to your people the things that you once said father we would desire God that the Holy Spirit would speak to the church the things that you once said today Lord feed us from your word Lord Jesus and Lord father we ask God that you'd have your just complete perfect way and father exactly what you have seen this service to be Lord we pray that Lord you would just have your perfect way bless the reading of of the word the meditation of our heart now we ask in Jesus name amen and amen then MO AB rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab now notice this is ahab's Son and haaiah fell down through eladas in his upper chamber that was in Samaria and was sick and he sent Messengers and said unto them go inquire of be Elba the god of eon whether I shall recover of this disease but the angel of the Lord said to Elijah to tishbite arise go up to meet The Messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a God in Israel that you go and inquire of be elub the god of Arron now therefore thus sayith the Lord Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which Thou Art gone up but shalt surely die and Elijah departed may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this morning you know it's funny how that um Elijah amen was uh went and he told them that but after if you read the whole chapter you'll find out that the king sent about two captains of 50 and and the captain and both of those captains and the captains of 50 we know that uh because they went up to try to bring him down to come and meet the king is that right and they all got burnt is Right Elijah said if I be a man of God Amen Let Fire come down consume all of them and the third Captain when he came he came and he fell before he lied his feet amen I don't know about you but anybody would do that wouldn't they amen realizing that everybody up before he got fried amen but this one he coming you know and and then uh God told Elijah to go ahead don't be afraid go on down and if you read it amen really the only thing that it says is that Elijah told the King the same thing and he died it really didn't change anything amen amen but anyway so we look at this and I I I just want to take it from this for a for a minute we want to look with uh amen talking about uh you know uh the God Amen the Christian's God and also over in like I said I wanted to read just a few of them I believe it's found in um let me see here Isaiah 55 Isaiah 55 we'll bring these together with the help of the Lord it says in verse one ho everyone that thirsts Come Ye to the waters and the that he that have no money Come Ye by and eat ye come buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness amen so God is saying come and buy now how many knows that whenever you go to buy something normally you'll go to a store somewhere that right you'll go to a store and I don't know about you but I've many times and I've went to places I've went to stores and traveled a pretty good distance you know and when I got there was [Applause] closed and I don't know about you but that's really really disappointing when you really really want something amen that means you're not getting what you wanted it's closed amen you're not going to get anything you know a amen now and Jesus what he said about this talking about coming by and eat yay come by wine and milk without money and without price praise the Lord the Lord amen I believe it was in John let me see here in John 6 verse 27 uh Jesus said unto them said verily verily I say unto you seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filled and now notice Jesus says labor not for the meat that perishes for the but for the meat that which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give you and amen for him hath God the Father seal so even there Jesus is telling us that not to labor so much for the meat that perishes but amen how many believe you God has a food that we can eat amen the Christian has a food that they can eat amen that will sustain them that is so much more than just the natural food God has has has it in store he's got it all prepared amen and I just want to say Amen God's store this morning is not closed how many believe back in the 1965 and so forth brother B when he preached the seals and so forth he talked about how SE when these uh seals are open when these seals are open the Mercy's over Mercy's over he said that many times come on people y all know we did you know we were a little confused about it I still don't understand it perfectly but there's a lot of people thought that Mercy was over that the store so to speak was closed but aren't you glad later on when that came up the prophet again says don't you ever believe that you believe that there's still Mercy there's still Grace oh keep working don't quit working people just thought that it was all over with but aren't you glad it wasn't over with I'm glad that it wasn't over with that there was still Mercy for God's Great storehouse amen didn't but B say that God told him to go up and store up [Applause] food so I ask you this morning if he stored up food how fat are you that's a real good question huh how fat are you he tyed us with that widow woman when all of Israel and everywhere else people were starving to death isn't that right but there she was getting three Square meals a day her food her meal Barrel never run out the oil never run out folks you and I this morning that's us that's us we're enjoying a good meal why because the little food that we did have we give it to God ain't that right and God sustains us you and I are living amen you and I are not living in the gross Darkness is out there no we're living in the most glorious light that ever shined and that light is the fact that Jesus came and proved himself alive he proved that these things are real they're not just some historical God I want to say not just something of history but it's now amen so he stored up food lots of vegetables great grapes and oh my brother says all kinds of food spiritual food in Du season has been starred up and the Stars open to the whole world and I'm going to tell you after a while what's going to happen to those that don't partake of the food amen going to be a sad day folks be a sad day cuz I guarantee you they're going to knock they're going to want to get in but they won't be able to cuz God that God said he opens doors and no man shuts he shuts doors and no man opens amen how many believe that's God when he opens the door amen Jeremiah 8:22 is there no bomb in gillad is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered wo praise be to God Malachi 4 amen Malachi 3 he says bring ye all the tithe into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me there with says the Lord of hosts and I that I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing then there shall not be enough room to receive it w how many believ that man God has a storehouse and God intends for that Storehouse they have a little meat in it labor not for the meat that perishes but when you come to the house of God he mean you are getting meat that sustains you that feed you amen God wants meat in his Storehouse praise the Lord hallelujah all right how many glad that you there's there's there's many gods in the world today but there is only one real God only only one that really a god all the rest are false gods amen amen many times God talked about how that people will in the Old Testament he says they lavish gold out of the bag they weigh silver into balance and hire a Goldsmith and he maketh it a god they fall down yay they worship they bear him upon a shoulder they carry him they set him in his place and he standeth there from his place shall he not remove H yeah one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of all his troubles amen let me tell you something all the false gods and all five the false gods they'll
