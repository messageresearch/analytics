know I've been touched by the grace of God and if you had only known me 25 26 years ago you would not believe the man standing before you today it's nothing but the grace of God and I trust that's the same with all of us I'm not going to hold you very long this morning we have plenty of ground to cover but I do want to bring bring greetings from our our pastor brother Tim and the church back home even like Tabernacle uh I will say this it's great to be back with you amen come on now come on come on was great to be back with you you know it looks like evening like Tabernacle Elton Kentucky is becoming my home away from home I'm begin to preach here more than I preach anywhere else so that's a good thing at least I say it's a good thing you may disagree with that but it's a good thing so we we've had a wonderful time here visiting with brother Thomas uh a little Fellowship there doing some things that we enjoy and brother Tommy and just want to say thank you for the invite to not only come in Fellowship but also for the invitation to come and share the word this morning just under a great expectation what the Lord's going to do for us so as you're standing there we're just going to bow for prayer then we'll get into the word and and just let the Lord have its way this morning for us if you have a need just lift your hand up to God I believe he knows the need but more importantly he knows the heart uh behind that need so father we come to you this morning Lord we want to say thank you for your many blessings to us and thank you for the message of the hour that you have given us and our hearts have been turned back lord to the Faith of Our Fathers and Lord we're just under a great expectation of what you're doing in this hour Lord we see the hand of God moving ushering their people back to the promised land of the word and God we want to be a part of that ushering in Lord we want to be a part of that group that finds their place their blessings Lord our blessings don't rest on the outside of the promised land but it rests in the land of promise Lord the last time I was here we spoke upon footprints in the land of promise and Lord I believe today you're coming back to kind of speak to us along those same lines again today God we want to be a people who's blessed but not our blessings of wealth and prosperity but blessed by the word of God blessed in the word of God blessed because Lord you've sent us a message in this hour which we have received father and we just pray God that you would just keep your hands upon us you see every hand that was lifted every heart and I ask today God that you'd meet the need of the believer Lord and may you forgive us where we fail you and may you just take control of this service for we ask it all this morning in the precious name of your son Jesus Christ amen if you have your Bibles this morning I'm going to have you look here at habach uh chapter 2 and verse two we're not going to have a lengthy scripture reading we're going to look at chapter 2 verse two and verse three and I want to speak to you on the vision is speaking so we look here where's Gideon my my buddy Gideon at this morning is he here oh man well you send him my greetings tell them I'm still eating on the Tic Tacs he gave me they've been a blessing we man every time we go to church pull a little pack out and take it in well I know you're not supposed to eat candy in church but got to have something right well you just send my greetings to Gideon thank you all right so we look here habac at 2 and verse two and it says and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and lie not though it t wait for it because it shall surely come it will not t God bless you you can have your seats this morning like I said I want to speak to you I've been on a series back home and on living in the hour of fulfillment and I believe if you're cognizant of our political systems and world world systems and looking around looking at Israel and different things playing out you can see that we're living in that hour of final fulfillment where God is about to take home a bride and Life as we know it as civilization is coming to an end and there's going to be a a a Rapture for the body of Christ and we're going to live in an eternal reign with him but we find here it lays out in the word this morning and I want to speak to you on the vision is speaking because I believe that this Bible that we read daily is a vision of God I believe everything that's laid in here that pertains to the body that pertains to the bride of Christ will be manifested it will come forth just the way God plans it to it may not come according to your idea it may not come According to some other man's idea but it will be uh uh it will come to manifestation according to the plan of God according to the way God designed it and purposed it so we find here in the back of the scripture says write division otherwise don't just speak it brother Brad but write it down so Generations after Generations after Generations can come back to that word come back to that vision and Trust the vision that it will not car it will surely come to pass come on church so we got a promise we can come back to this same word not tainted with Man Hands not some man's idea not some Creed not some church entity but we can come back to the same word of God and believe that this word he said write it down for generations and generations not to the first generation only but to the generation that's living in the leot to see and age you can come back to the same word and have the same promise had the same outpouring have the same Revelation oh praise God this morning it's the same and though the vision T oh though it car wa for it for it shall surely come to pass it shall surely begin to speak do you believe that this morning so let's just slow down for a minute this is one of my teaching series don't you laugh you think huh he ain't teaching I'm not much of a teacher I'm a preacher right but we look at this word Vision it means an oracle it means a prophecy Divine communication a dream of Revelation and when you look here it says the vision is yet for an appointed time a lot of things we think of that we want it instantly we live in a microwave age you know back I'mma tell my age now about 26 years ago how many of you remember 2.8 KBS none of y'all that's dial up see y'all don't even remember that some of you youngsters you're like KBS what in the world is he talking about kilobytes per second you wait and you hear that it's dialing up and finally you get connected well today it's instant well we got 300 megabytes come on Church let's work with me a little bit this morning but we find it's for an appointed time so the vision may not be for right now but there's an appointed time that that vision is going to manifest itself it says but at the end it shall speak and lie not though it ter way for it so we find the word vision is an oracle Divine communication a dream and though it tar there's an appointed time just like every individual has an appointed time that they come and meet God you can't shove it down their throat you can try as much as you can you know we heard the old cliche you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink but you let that horse get thirsty enough he'll begin to drink let me tell you you let that Son of God who's been drifting and wavered he be drifted long enough and his life becomes a living hell he'll be reminded that there's promises in the word he'll come and take a drink of it you won't have to force him you won't have to make him because at the appointed time if there is a seed on the inside that seed has to come to manifestation that seed has to come and take a drink of the word of God so I don't get all worked up cuz my family some of my family members are not serving the lord I just wait on God cuz God gave the promise and some of you mothers and fathers that have wayward children don't don't be distressed because the Bible gives you a prophecy it gives you a word that they and their offspring shall be there let me tell you I would pray without ceasing for that Offspring and though it ter wait for it for it cuzz it shall speak and this word speak here means to breathe out to come to pass so just going to kind of look at this and lay the foundation this morning for the vision is yet for an appointed time and though he speaking it right now it's not going to be expressed or manifested for a distance time off in the future and we find here but at the end notice when this period appointed by God shall come it shall be accomplish it shall not disappoint the expectation now we have been given a prophecy regarding the end time we have had a Prophet come on the scene and tell us the things in which we should be looking for come on Church notice we're not like denominal Believers we're not like Sinners out there who's threatening and stressing and worried about chaos all around us we've had a Prophet come and show us the things that are coming the vision has spoken in this day and we can sit back with ease why because we know the outcome we know before the first bomb Falls this bride is going up Hallelujah this morning we don't have a reason to fret we don't have a reason to worry and to be fretful we have given a vision and it will speak church and it is speaking notice so the event that is habca saying here though the vision T it will speak or breathe for forth or it will come to pass and so it terries we're warned now and that's the thing I got we got to think about because a lot of times we're like What happens in the delay so many people because the Lord seems to have delayed his coming and we see things around us we're thinking well why isn't he come why didn't he come why didn't he come because that's part of the process cuz we're worn now you notice we're worn way back in AA though it t though it delay oh don't get comfortable in the delay well you're starting to do things you shouldn't in the delay you get soft in the delay you're not serving God like you should in the delay well you know if it's going to be it's going to be and you know you know if God comes I I guess CNN will put it on there they'll broadcast it for several weeks before he comes it ain't going to be like that God is looking for somebody who's earnestly desired ing his coming every day every day when you wake up you begin to pray oh God come today may this be the day may this be the hour may my children find you Lord may they surrender everything to you Lord may this be the time that our bodies are changed and we're going home Hallelujah though it Terry wait for it you know that's a hard thing for some of us man you miss that d up remember when you used to click the button brother Joe and it turn 2.8 or 28 KBS something like it was slow you sitting there waiting you go fix you a pot of coffee and finally you get back and then all of a sudden woo I got internet I'm connected now you're always connected come on hope you see the type now we're always connected this ain't waiting for some preacher to find some quote but but now we got the entire message at our fingertip we're always connected oh Hallelujah so we find here that the scriptures can have a compound meaning and I hope you don't mind I'm taking my time this morning brother Thomas when you get tired of me preaching you just come up here and pull my coat say all right brother Joe you're done we only have one service back home on Sunday and let me tell you it's a service and so we just follow the leader I've been taught by the best but I'm not going to try to hold you too long but notice now scriptures can have a compound meaning that mean it can have a natural occurrence and also a spiritual occurrence okay the natural can take place and manifest long before the spiritual so we look here in the book of habac and he's talking about the vision and he's talking about the destruction of the Babylons who are coming into there and and and back at his concern Lord you're allowing these people to come in and they're raping and they're pillaging and they're stealing and they're doing how how long are you going to allow this to continue where one man comes in and he goes out and they take destroy another nation and they take all their goods and they they take everything from him just to cast his neck back out and repeat the process and God is telling him there will be a time that I deal with the unbeliever there will be a time that I deal with Babylon there will be a time that I deal with the child is there will be a time but until that time you keep waiting for the vision to come so God begins to speak to him regarding the word regarding the time in which he's living and notice we find this compound meaning being played out are the compound scriptures being played out in the Book of Daniel now you go to Daniel 9 and we look here and it says now in the first year of Darius the son of hazaras the seeds of the M which was made King over the real of the Chans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by the books So Daniel begin to study the books begin to look back at what his predecessors had said he wasn't looking the books of Dr James doson he wasn't looking at the books of some preacher on the street he was going back into the prophecies he was going back into to seeing what the prophets before him what they had wrote down in the word of God I Daniel understood by the books the number of years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem so we find Daniel going back to Jeremiah's prophecy because he wanted to see when is this 70 years are going to play out when does it start when does it end so we notice now Israel at this time or Daniel here there's 70 years natural then there's also the 70 years spiritual the 70 weeks of Daniel and you play that out it's and we're close to the end of the 70 weeks if you had listened to the 70 weeks of Daniel I would encourage you go back now they don't pertain to the bride we'll get into that a little bit here this morning they don't pertain to us but they tell you exactly where we are in a timeline you know when I first became a Christian and and came to this message I read the 70 weeks of Daniel y'all remember the green book this Daniel 70 weeks man I put that book down it's like this is way over my little head like boy My Little peon brain couldn't understand that and I have avoided it for 20s something years but just here in the last several months I begin to to to study it and and go through it and go through it and go through it and my brother Brad the Revelation just begins to expound yet it doesn't pertain to the bride but we understand Israel is the time piece God distinguished at appointed time that Israel that he would pour out judgment upon her captives and bring her back into the homeland of the world and if we can watch Israel church we can also see when our homine when we're going back to our homeland in a spiritual union with the bride of Jesus Christ or with the groom himself let me tell you you put your eyes on Israel watch Israel because when you watch her you're watching yourself leave here so we find Daniel begins to look back at Jeremiah's prophecies and we're going to go to Jeremiah Jeremiah 25 and verse 7 I'm GNA try to slow this down I keep saying that but this is just too good not to preach all right that's two of you how about the rest of you come on that's two of you with me how about the rest of you I heard y'all had an outstanding service Wednesday night let's have another one this morning notice here in Jeremiah 25 yet you have not hearkened unto me sayeth the Lord that you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt therefore thus sayith the Lord of hosts because you have not heard my words now they've heard the words but they didn't hear the words does that make sense this morning cuz some of you sitting right here this morning you're hearing the word but are you hearing the word you're hearing a voice speak but are you hearing the voice behind the voice speak so every service you come has got to be more than just brother Brad it's got to be be more than brother just brother Thomas it's got to be more than that human voice but you're hearing the inspiration in which God laid it upon their hearts to speak a message that's when you're hearing the voice of God and you're hearing the word of God but here we find they didn't hear the words of God oh they heard the words of a prophet but they didn't hear the voice behind it therefore thus sayith the Lord of host because you have not heard my words behold I will s and take all the families of the north sayeth the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and I will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof against all these nations round about and I will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and a Perpetual desolation moreover I will take from them notice what he's going to take away from them to me I thought this was very very very profound I'm going to take away the voice of myr and the voice of gladness man when you ain't got the Lord you ain't got no happiness the voice of M your life stinks I'm going to take the way the voice of my the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride are all removed because they did what they didn't hear the voice of God they didn't hear the words of God and the sound of the millstones and the light of the candle otherwise he's removing the light out of their midst there would be no progress there be no work the sound of the millstones are grinding the way they make their living all these things he's pulling them he's telling them I'm about to come in I'm sending Nebuchadnezzar I'm sending in your enemy to come in because you turned yourself away from my Commandments and it says in verse 11 and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations Shall Serve the king of Bon 70 years and it shall come to pass when the 70 years are accomplished that I will punish the king of Babylon and the nation and that Nation saith the Lord for their iniquity in the land of the Chans and I will make it a Perpetual desolation and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah ha prophesied against all the nations for Many Nations and great Kings shall serve themselves of them also and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their hands for thus sayeth the Lord that after the 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you and causing you to return back to this place so there's a promise God's laying out here in the book of Jeremiah look because you didn't hear and because notice what it says now because you didn't hearken unto me sayeth the Lord that you provoke me to anger you wouldn't hear my word I'm going to allow your enemies to come in and bring you into exile to hold you captive so we find Israel was exiled or taken captive by the Babylonians in King Nebuchadnezzar due to their Disobedience to the Lord and we think we can be disobedient and get by with it but notice there's a set period of time there's a set period of there's only 70 years in which Babylon has the opportunity to work there's only 70 years that they had to remain captive to the Babylonians in King Nebuchadnezzar so we find here Daniel wanted to know he goes back to Jeremiah's prophecy to find when will that time be accomplished not only the time regarding God pouring out his wrath on Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian Kingdom but also the time when God is going to take the Jews who's been dispersed throughout the lands and take them back to the Homeland that they belong to notice God will never bless the Jew until he's in his homeland and God will never bless the bride until she's in the Homeland so notice there's a prophecy that's going forth there is a set time after the 70 years brother Tommy God is going to take the Jews and take them back to their Homeland back to where he can pour out his Spirit back to where they can be blessed back to where they can multiply put them back into the homeland of the land of Palestine it's a prophecy it tells him that they're not going to remain slaves indefinitely and let me tell you you're not going to remain a slave indefinitely your children will not remain a slave indefinitely devil only has a period of time but at the time appointed Hallelujah God is going to move and God is going to draw people back to the Homeland Hallelujah see they'll return home he's promised they're going to return home return to their native land return to the Homeland the land that they were taken from and we notice here that after the 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you so we find even in that day in Jeremiah's day it wasn't about Jeremiah the prophet come on church but he says I will visit you I'm going to visit your family I'm going to visit your youth I'm going to visit your old I'm going I'm going to visit your churches I'm going to visit your huge camps I will visit you at the time appointed let me tell you we're living in the appointed time we're living in the hour of fulfillment where God is about to wrap this entire thing up and there will be a bride and she will go home with him and though the prophecy T it will speak and I'm going to go ahead and tell you this morning it is speaking to those that are listening it is speaking well you say well brother Joe I'm blessed you know God never did bless Israel I'm just going to get comfortable well in a minute these little T-Rex arms I got notice God never did bless Israel as long as she was outside of her Homeland and God will never bless you outside of the homeland of this word oh you may be successful you may make lots of money you may have nice things live in a nice house you know wear the nicest clothing that's all fine and dandy let me just tell you what your Prophet said he said and so has our modern T Trend today falling away from the things of God and has brought the world to one of the greatest idoles that we have listen to one of the greatest idoles that we have and that's idleness we got young men playing Xbox more than we got young men reading the word of God God they so consumed on their video games and they don't even know how to be a man let me tell you when I was 78 n 10 years old I wasn't out there working in the field don't get me wrong H not having that but I wasn't playing video games man I was out there fishing riding four-wheelers doing things working on them doing it myself L to learn doing all this stuff we were poor so you had to do stuff yourself if you want to get something done but I wasn't at home occupying my time on video games like we see these young kids today we got young boys young married men 25 26 spend all their time can't hold down a job because they're too worried about getting caught up on their video game playing against their friends losing their jobs over a video game I don't know how the word I got here but notice idleness there it is he said just idling around great is the iniquity of the people today making plenty of money and think that's God's blessing us because he's prospered us he said that's no sign of God's blessing not at all he says what we need today is not a lot of material things he says we have that we don't need greater churches we don't need greater congregations we don't need more on the radio and on television we don't need so many more of these things but what we need today listen up Church what we need today to be spiritual is a person that will humble themselves before God if they haven't got a penny and will pray till that Spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God and a Revival takes place let me tell you you may have drove up in a hoote this morning but you can get into the presence of God and begin to pray and begin to call down the anointing and a revival can take place and even like El in Kentucky let me tell you what are we waiting for what are we waiting on we don't need the president to drive when God has got Vindicated Believers in our midst this morning we don't need fancy cars in the driveway we got what we need right here Sons and Daughters of God that are humble theel and say I need you this morning Lord I want more of you this morning I want to hear the voice of god notice if you haven't got a penny there ain't many of you here this morning that ain't got a penny but we pass pass a little tent this morning had a 70- year old man in a wheelchair in it and a 70y old lady sleeping in a tent on the side of the road what would they give for what you're listening to this morning look goes notice if they haven't got a penny and will pray to the spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God and a Revival takes place on the inside of their heart that changes their attitudes in the atmosphere that we live in now let me ask you how many of you are praying for Revival well I got one I got two I got three my goodness y'all scared of Revival I'm I'm going to ask it again it's not a trick question not tricky at all do are we okay how many of you this morning are praying be honest I started start seeing some hand slide up I ain't even finished the question yet how many of you are praying for a Revival come on how many you praying for your own Revival that's better how many you praying for Revival for your church how many you praying for Revival for your young people oh that should be our desire see praying for Revival get into the atmosphere you ain't got to let the preacher do it all let me tell you the creature is just part of the work let me tell you the greatest outpouring of the supernatural takes place right there in those pews when you begin to have a need and begin to call on God and begin to respond back to the word and then the Lord comes back and speaks to you then the Revival begins to change then the atmosphere in the church begin to change then the atmosphere in the home begins to change and then you come into the house of God expecting to hear from God that's what causes a Revival that's what causes a stir in the hearts and lives but many time we see the outpouring at other churches well they can have it there we can't no let me don't you take that attitude this morning no sir what they have there we can have here come on Church what they have there we can have here what we had last week and even like men you can have it and even like El because God is the same yesterday today and forever it the people will humble themselves if the people will go to crying out to God God can pour out his spirit and I will say God will pour out his Spirit Ain about about who has this and how much we have I tell my children we're blessed absolutely we have been blessed we live in a nice house like none of us wearing Rags you know we drive decent vehicles but if God took it all away I still serve them cuz I know what he's done for me brother Joe I know what I used to be and I know what I am now and I'm going to tell you the Baptist Church didn't do it the Pentecostal Church didn't do it the method this church didn't do it but God sent me a messenger God sent me a prophet and oh let me tell you I had to do some humbling brother Tommy to receive it but when I humble myself down it ain't about money it ain't about what I have what I have not it's about getting into into the presence of the Living God and letting that word change me and change my desires so what we want today we want the blessings of God this is where we raise our hands this is class participation we want the blessings of God let me tell I don't just want it in my car I don't just want it in my home I don't just want it at some Youth Camp I don't want it at just some Family Camp I want the blessings of God in my church I want it in the ministry I want it in the deacons I want it in the musicians I want it in the trustees I want the presence of God I want the blessings of God that come every service why should we not expect that come on why should we not expect that well brother Joe we just know maybe your preaching is a little bit too much for us well maybe it is but I want it and you should want it I'm telling we're so close to the end the Finish Line brother John is just ahead I can taste it oh I can I'm salivating I can taste it it excites me and it should excite you oh this heartache all the headache all the sickness all the trials of this life it's soon going to be over and we're going to finish that finish slide we're going to run over the race oh it should excite you this morning the joy of the Lord should excite you this morning the shout of the king is in the midst of his people that should excite you this morning that's nothing to be afraid of so y'all don't like clapping on this side there we go class participation everybody on three put your hands together one two and [Applause] three come on the vision is speaking and you're part of the vision I said you're part of the vision yes Lord come Lord speak to me Lord I know we done Pastor offering right you done Pastor offering I'm not asking you take up another offering don't don't go there I'm just reminded of the little story a little boy and his dad come in church Brother Brad you know and the dad they sat there and little boy's getting happy he's enjoying what he's hearing and Dad just you know he dropped a little dime in the Ser in the offering plate and when he got up and left brother Joe he took his dime back out of off from plate y'all heard this story I ain't never heard it okay and the son looks up at his dad as he reaches in and grabs that dime back and the son looks at him said Daddy he goes you would have got more out of the service if you would have put more into it said you would have got more out of the service if you would put more into what am I telling you this morning if you want a move of the spirit if you want a Revival if you want the voice of God to come and speak to put more in the service put more into the worship put more into it you can come your hands you can shout amen you can say glory to God put more into it and you'll get a blessing out of it we want the blessings of God therefore we must invest into the promises of God and believe the word of God notice now let's go back to my my topic that was all off topic Genesis 15 Verse 18 God promised God promised Israel a little piece of property brother Carson put that first picture up God promised Israel I don't know where your slides are oh mercy anybody find Israel in this picture you don't really see it but you see you see Africa you see Saudi Arabia you see Iraq you see Iran you see Syria but man God promised Israel a little piece of property let's look at his Genesis 15 and verse 16 keep that up says now in the same day that the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land and God's promised a land for his chosen people that's right notice now from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates the kenites the kenites the catamites the Hittites the perizzites the reims and the amorites the Canaanites the gites and the jebusites so we see here the total state of Israel total land mass of Israel is 8,630 square miles let's go to the next picture and bring this up a little bit closer now Israel is starting a form here you can see it but also you see Egypt on the left you see Jordan on the right you see Syria up to the Northeast you see Lebanon right there directly in North so you see she's just a little sliver of land I'm going somewhere with this see Israel is roughly the same size of New Jersey now when you look at the map of the United States New Jersey is right up here next to New York some of y'all that don't know that it's little bitty New Jersey Connecticut Rhode Island they're all right there very small little pieces of land and we notice here the country is bordered by Lebanon to the north Syria to the Northeast Jordan to the east Egypt to the Southwest the med the Mediterranean Sea to the west and notice now here also it's full of mountains and plains and fertile land and the desert they're often just few minutes apart so we look here go to the next slide now we're getting a little bit closer next slide now we see this is a little bit better picture and we find from Gaza right there all the way to the east if you go east you can cross Israel at its widest Mark in 90 minutes it took us almost an hour to get here from the the place we were staying I'm not telling y'all where I was staying because I was on a little bit of pleasure this week but we find at their widest mark it takes 90 minutes and from the very top of Israel up there by the Golan Heights by Lebanon to the very bottom down here by taba way down here at the very bottom it takes nine hours to go from top to bottom with traffic so Israel is a very small piece of land but yet God had promised The Chosen you can turn that off I'm done with that slide but God had promised Israel I'm going to give you a special land and notice God done all the research God knows what lays in the land we find here the Bible would tell us in Exodus 3 and ver8 I've come down to deliver them out of the land of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land notice it's a good land and a large land large put that slide back up one more time the last one or put the very first one up this is a large land I mean you can't even find it on the map but yet God oh come on church God has already spoke over the land he's already pre planned the land he's already predestinated that Israel will dwell in this little sliver of land that takes you a mere 90 minutes to cross and 9 hours to go up and down but yet it was a land that God chose that God picked out and that God said I'll bless you if you stay in that land I'll take you out of Egypt I'll take you out of the foreign lands oh and I'll place you right here and I'll bless you in that land it was also a land described is Flowing with milk and honey you know what milk and honey represents that's the diet of Kings oh he's telling you I'm going to give you the best of the best if you stay in the land but we find here due to Israel's Disobedience they begin to be dispersed and I got to speed up cuz I'm taking a lot of time here but I'm enjoying myself so we find that there is what we call the Jewish dispora how many have ever heard of that okay we're going to have to get y'all connected to civilization up here in Elton praise God we finally got internet it's a church we're making progress little by little we're going to get there but so they got what we call the Jewish dispora or the Jewish Exile it's a dis dispersion of the Israelites or the Jews out of their ancient ancestral Homeland and we notice the first exile took place was an Assyrian Exile in 733 BC before Christ the second Exile was in uh 597 by Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar and what it is is they come in because of their Disobedience to God and they came in and dispersed them and pushed them out of their Homeland or pulled them out of their Homeland and drugged them and made them captives and slaves in other lands that didn't belong to them so we find Daniel 70 weeks is going back to the disp and say there's only going to be a window of time there's only going to be an allotment of time that I'm going to allow Babylon and that I'm going to allow these other nations to come against you but at the end of that time I'm going to return you home oh come on oh hope you're seeing it this morning and what God does for natural Israel he does for Spiritual Israel what God's done for them he's doing also for the bride there's only going to be a short window where I'm going to let you be dispersed thank you Lord notice now so the Jews just as the Jews were dispersed from their Homeland for more than 2500 years they were dispersed 2500 years scattered throughout Arab Nations Egypt the European countries the true bride of Christ has been dispersed from the homeland of the word for seven Church ages where was she founded Brother Brad at Pentecost God gave her Pentecost as her Homeland it's more than just Supernatural it's more than just signs and wonders it's the reveal word of God God said this is your Homeland stay in your Homeland but 3:25 at the Nai and cancel they organized it and took it into Catholicism and then a few years after that they begin to be dispersed in the Baptist and the Methodist and the Pentecostal and all these other foreign land but God said I will bless you in the homeland of the word that's where our blessings lie it don't lie in Baptist Church it don't lie the Pentecostal Church it don't lie in the Catholic our blessings rely right here in the homeland of Malachi 4 the message of the hour that's the promised land that's the word of God to a Believer and just as God promised Israel I'll bring you out and I'm going to take you into that land it's a good land it's a land flowing with milk and honey it's a land that's got the supernatural it's a land that's got healing it's a land that's got Deliverance it's a land that's got prayer Liv it's a land that's got the supernatural it's a land of laying on the hands it's a it's the land of the Holy Ghost filling the people it's a good land you ain't got to go to some Pentecostal Church to get this word it's right here in the midst of the hour it's a good land and I'll bless you if you stay there yeah thank Hallelujah see God promised Israel that after 70 years our accomplish I'm going to bring you back and notice I'm gonna go a little bit further here God begins to bring his bride back why are you here this morning some of you were out there in those foreign lands some of you I myself was in a Baptist Church drifting trying to find the truth because there was something on the inside said you don't belong there I left the Baptist went to the Methodist good Lord I surely didn't belong there went there went to the Pentecostal now it's getting more my speed I like a little bit that jumping I don't mind a little shouting in church I like to feel the Holy Ghost all right I won't Jance for you that be all right I'll keep myself under control but it was getting closer because God was leading me out of the foreign land just like he led many of you out of those far lands of denominations and he brought you to the homeland of the word of God he brought you where he can bless you and that blessing ain't with money that blessing ain't with property that blessing ain't with natural things that's a spiritual blessing where he's going to change your heart change your desires fill you with the Holy Ghost and when they come back and change your body and take you to a wedding supper that's the blessings that lay in the word that's the blessings promised to the bride but I'll only bless you when you're in the word of God I'm not going to bless you looking like the world I'm not going to bless you playing with the world I will bless you in the word of God I hope this is okay this morning notice now let's keep going so there's a promise he said I will restore saith the Lord so there's a promise of restoration for natural Israel there's also a promise of restoration for Spiritual Israel and see there would be a restoration of the Bride tree now she' been ate down by these four bugs and we understand Joel said I will restore all the years that set time some of you may have still been at on done killed your joy and un killed your fellowship un killed you enjoying coming to the house of God God's got a promise over you I'm going to restore it oh you can't wait I'm going to restore you you ain't going to wait till the doors of the the church open up you'd be glad to go into the house of the Lord but we find here God promised he's going to restore people and elect a called out group back to the original word back to Pentecost don't be afraid of Pentecost I ain't talking about AO of Pentecost I'm not talking about the the nomination Pentecost but don't you be afraid of the signs and wers don't you be afraid of the supernatural don't you be afraid of the word cuz at Pentecost they had the word of God and let me tell you if we got the restored word shouldn't we also have the restored power shouldn't we have the restored SIDS shouldn't we have the restored wonders shouldn't it be in our midst what are we ashamed of then I'm not ashamed of Pentecost cuz I know where I stand on this word by the message of the hour but notice in Ephesians 5: 27 God promised that he's going to present to himself a glorious church not having a spot or wrink or any such thing but that it should be holy without blemish and as God began to deal with the Jews I'm going to show you something here maybe it went over your head maybe you never thought about this but the Lord laid this on my heart when I began to study this out God be to deal with the Jews right at the end of the first World War 1914 to 1918 was the first world war then he also be to move on the Jews again in the 1930s and the 1940s so God is beginning Brother Brad to deal with the Jews because now he's saying this end of those 70 years that Daniel PR that Jeremiah prophesied has to come to pass I gave them a promise I'm not only going to deal with their captiv and those kingdoms that came against them but I'm also going to restore them back to the homeland of the word they had been dispersed they had been scattered theyve not been blessed oh they may have prospered and they may have been wealthy and they may have been great businessmen and women and things of that nature but their true blessings doesn't lie outside of the promised land so God be to deal with the Jews in the early 1900s and what happened at that time in 1909 can anybody tell me what happened a prophet was born so God is Not only dealing with natural Israel now he begins to raise up a Ministry he begin to raise up a prophet in the end time around the same time that would do what that would gusher in the bride back to her Homeland so we find 1909 William Brandon was born 1933 at the age of 24 he preaches his first message and in the same year 1933 he had said seven continuous Visions regarding the end time 1936 brandom Tabernacle was built 1946 we move ahead 10 years he' received an Angelic visitation on May 7th 1946 that commission him with the worldwide Ministry and launching his campaigning career in the mid 1946 so we find in 1946 he's commissioned now to go around the world oh I hope you're seeing something here 1947 we had the first recording of William bram's message faith is the substance so what is happening here a prophet is coming on the scene to Usher the elect away from Creeds and dogmas and restore her back to the Vindicated word 1962 we move forward a lot so let's move forward real quick 1962 62 toward the end of brother branham's Ministry we begin to see a lot of things begin to plan begin to play out just like we did in 1940s with the Jews what God was doing there we find 1962 he preaches the restoration of the brid tree showing she's got to be restored 1962 he preaches why am I against organized religion see organized religion is foreign lands to a Believer it's not where you belong 1962 he preaches is this the sign of the end sir see he's looking to see we're close it's all about to come to fulfillment and he's preaching that 1963 he preaches the way of a true Prophet because a true Prophet is going to stay with the word of God then we also in 1961 or 62 I believe 61 he preaches a true sign that's overlooked because a prophet is that sign that's been overlooked for generations and generations oh Church don't you see that God has opened your eyes to what he's doing in this hour because it shows that you're not part of those out there in Exile but you're the ones that are coming home back to the land back to where he can pour out his blessings upon you oh he should excite you this morning to realize you're not forgotten and he's not forsaken you but he sent you a message to bring you back into the homeland of the word notice 1963 he preaches God hiding himself in Simplicity and see if you all you saw was a prophet you didn't see God God hiding himself in Simplicity simple oh me simple o you simple oh you simple oh you God hiding himself in Simplicity oh this is awesome I'm trying to show you you're not out there in those foreign lands God's bringing us home notice now this is at the same time he's dealing with the Jews so then we find in 1963 the seals become open the seals become open and the prophet of God said the Bible became a new book oh now when he looked into the word he saw it the way he'd never seen it before all the loose sins that men had probed at through generations and generations now it took a prophet and he tied those loose sins up and now we are the recipients of a great and wonderful message it's a message of restoration oh not Reformation but restoration we are going back to the H land of the word of God the seal have been open the book has become a new book it's a land church that's promised to us this morning notice 1963 the uniting time and sign oh I could go there with this but I'm G hold it for just one more sermon title then we got 1963 the token outside of the opening of The Seven Seals the most ordained message that I ever preached that's your Prophet so what is a token the very life literal as he said the literal Life of Christ coming and tabernacling your Humanity oh you talking about a blessing because it come from the word he broke the seals off of them now he's said oh your home every gate around Israel now they're destroyed you can go back to the homeland of the word so we find here the token then 63 Christ The Mystery of God revealed but if you pay attention he also speaks in Christ The Mystery of God revealed that the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed she is him oh man that's just beautiful she's not a denomination she's not a church she's not a man's idea she's not a Creed she's not a Dogma she is him woo that's who you are notice now then we find he preaches God's provided way for this day 1964 then the identification of Christ in all the ages so he wants you to see so you can see not only Christ in every age but you'll be able to see Christ in this age you'll be able to see Christ in this age in this age whatever age you are this morning whether you're 80 whether you're 60 whether you're 13 it's Christ in this age at 49 year old age at 69 year old I see Christ in that age I see him in the old I see him in the young I see him in the boys I see him in the girls I see Christ through every age and every generation Hallelujah this morning come on work with me this morning church this is good stuff notice then he preaches God is identified by his characteristics now if this wasn't God that's fine but he's identified by his characteristics then in 1964 he preaches to Mighty God unveiled before us and in that message he's getting to show deity is now tabernacling Humanity deity is now tabernacling Humanity then he preaches in 19 no let me go back one more 1964 toward the end of 64 he preaches the identified Masterpiece of God how many of you listening to that lately at least you're honest the identified Masterpiece brother Brandon wasn't pointing to himself as that Masterpiece he was pointing to a bride I said he was pointing to a body he was pointing the one just like Michelangelo when he sculptured the the the statue of Moses and I saw the replica out there in California let me tell you when Moses got done because what was in his vision became manifested he stroke he stroke it on the knee and said speak I'm here to tell you in this hour this little bride is speaking because why she's taking the open book and she's prophesy again and the word is Flowing that's the identified Masterpiece for this hour you are that identification you are that Masterpiece quit looking at some other church quit looking at some other young person quit looking at some other couple you are the Masterpiece you are the identification 1965 last year of his ministry seed is not air with the shook showing there's a distinction between the church and the bride that the seed will not be air with the shock otherwise we got a different Ministry oh my we're not going to be on the outside Lebanon and Syria and Egypt now we got a different Ministry we're in the Homeland of the word the seed will not be air with the shook the Shu just holds the seed in but at that appointed time the shook has to give way and the seed has to come forth and let me tell you it's the coming forth time the seed of the Bride it's come forth and it's in time and we are she we are ready to take a body [Applause] change 1965 the anointed ones at the end time Christ is revealed in his what own word not some other man's word not some man's idea he's not revealed through Thunders and perusia and two souls and no souls and all these other ideas they have a partial truth but that ain't where he said if God was so focused on all these other movements that surround the message he would have laid on a prophet's heart to preach those things but he stayed with the word he stayed with what belongs to the believer in the promised land and I me tell you Thunders it don't belong to us that's not our message but we got a message right here stay balanced stay in the middle of the road stay with it it'll take you on to the coming of the Lord 1965 the invisible Union of the bride of Christ notice the invisible Union there's a vow that's made before the wedd ceremony now how many of you got married here some of y'all should raise your hands I mean you may not like it but you got married anyway right before there was a ceremony there was an invisible Union that took place brother Troy you asked her will you marry me thank God she said yes come on Troy this is time for you to speak up yeah and we'll talk about that later tro we'll have marriage cancel when I get done but there's an invisible Union it takes place before the wedding ceremony look at your Prophet getting you into the homeland of the word no then he begins to preach the Rapture after this invisible Union's taking place then there's a promise that there's a Rapture you're going to be caught up the catching away not only are we going to I'm going to marry you but I'm going to come and take you to that that home beyond the skies then he preaches things that are to be toward the very end of 1965 things that are to be otherwise telling you you look for these manifestations in the scripture because the scripture is the vision and it is speaking then he preaches at the very end 1965 modern events are made clear through prophecy so you can look around that's why we're not fren that's why we're not afraid that's why we're not full of anxiety and on pills and medication it's because we had a Prophet come and said look for these things prophecy is beginning to make itself clear by modern events that's been all around us we see Israel right now she's back in her Homeland we see she's become the burdensome Stone every nation that surrounds her is her enemy but let me tell you it's only the vision speaking and it's telling us we're close little bride we're close to going home we won't be here much longer we will not be here much longer there will be a catching away because the union has already been been taking place The Vow has been made can I keep going let me try to bring this down I got I got a whole lot here but I know it's 12:00 and I'm watching that clock brother B say the church has failed instead of bringing the people together as one body it separated them out he says so the church will never take the people over Jordan he says Remember come out of her my people you see come out of her let's serve god with one heart one mind one Accord is that right and then God will take his church over Jordan that's over death now you believe that with all your heart so we find in 1947 there's something special happened here he got the commission from the angel and I want you to see no longer was it just a local Ministry around Jeffersonville Indiana but he was commissioned to take the message around the world to call out the bride that's been dispersed that's been in the dispora those in Europe those in Africa those in the foreign lands go around the world he went around seven times for what the message is still going around the world calling back the bride get her back to the homeland of the word of God where you can be blessed to take a Rapture and a body change that that's the entire purpose let me tell you this message was not about William brandom don't get hurt over that but it was about you it's always been about you youve been that bride that's been dispersed so God sent you a messenger to call you back to the promised land of the word of God where we can take a Rapture Hallelujah God has called us out of the confusion and far lands of denominations calling us back from the desport now notice they asked Jesus in Matthew 24 Jesus went out and departed from the temple and the disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily I say unto you that there should not be one notice left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and he sat upon the Mount of Olives and the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when these things shall be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world they were curious like us when are these things going to come like your like the counterparts that we work with they're wondering when they know something's happened they can see it they can sense it and Jesus tells them in Matthew 24 and verse 14 or 15 he says when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy Place whoever readeth let him understand so he's talking about the Jews now Jesus tells them when you see the Abomination when you you see what Daniel prophesied when you see what Jeremiah prophesied when you see the vision begin to speak then you'll know that the end is not and brother Brown would tell us in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel 1961 he says this is one of the most important scriptures in the book referring to uh Daniel 9 he says what does it do it tells the closing of the Jewish Nation the Jewish people this scripture to 70 weeks it discloses and tells exactly from the time that Daniel started there until the end of the consummation it's one of the greatest time pieces he goes if you want to know what day of the week he goes look at your calendar if you want to know what time it is you look at that clock back on the back wall it's telling me to hurry up but if you want to know where we are as a people as a nation as a country you want to know what time it is as far as the end of the end you got to look at Israel he said notice he said Daniel referring to Daniel 7 we has nothing to do with the Gentiles the Seven Seals the seven plagues the seven woes the seven trumpets has not one thing to do the Gentile church will be in glory at that time in another place he said when these things take place he says we'll be we'll be in glory at a wedding supper getting married oh Hallelujah y'all said that very weak I mean you telling me you getting married and you amen PR God girls if the guys didn't want to say amen that's where you should have shouted to the rooftop you know what it was like when you went from store to store looking for that dress getting everything planned out come on sister Tammy give me a little bit of amen amen that's weak come on come on sister Donna I know you got an amen in you yes sir man when you was getting married and that vow was made you got all excited all giddy you started planning everything everything out that's what we're here to do Church he's coming back to take a bride that says I will marry you you'll be bone of my bone fresh of My Flesh power of my power I've taking you home with me I'm not going to leave you here but you're going to go with me he says I go to prepare a place for you and if it wasn't so I would have told you he's got a land prepared he's got a word prepared he's got a all we got to do is ly up with the word the Gentile church he says will be in glory she'll be getting married come on sisters amen that's weak but y'all going to have to come visit Louisiana cuz our sisters want to get married man well we'll just move on we'll deal with marriage another service Hallelujah notice he says and it discloses the fact that God Deals Only with the Jews when they are in the Homeland Hallelujah so in Isaiah 11: 11 we find here God is predicting or prophesying that his children will be back in our homeland Jeremiah 29:10 Jeremiah predicts that Israel will return back to their Homeland Ezra 1:1 confirms at the return of the Jewish people back to their Homeland Genesis 17 God telling Abraham and his off they will be in a Land of Canaan it'll be a Perpetual holding so notice Israel has a natural Homeland it may not appear to be much but it's God's land and God gave it to him as her as his little bride and what am I telling this message may not look much to a lot of people that just glance at it and look at it and they want to cast it off and they want to throw it away but to the Bri it's the whole land of the world every promise lays in it every Wonder every sty every Supernatural every healing every Deliverance it oh Hallelujah it lays in the word it may not be big when you look at denominations but everything we have need of is right here in the word it's in the word and we've been restored back to the homeland of the word let me go a little bit further amen he goes I've always told you if you want to know what day of the week it is look at the calendar if you want to know what time we're living in watch the Jews that's the only time piece see God and he goes said God did not all low a certain time for the Gentiles there was no certain space of time he says now that's where I think many of the great writers mix it up trying to apply this to the jewi and Gentile because he said thy people but he was talking to Daniel not to the church Daniel's people is to Jew if he was talking to the church you can't make that run anywhere see you're way back because even before the coming of Christ it'll run right any kind of prophetic weeks you want to put it in there it's already run out but he was talking to the Jews so therefore the Jew is God's time piece it has nothing to do with the church the 70 weeks has nothing to do with the church so brother Joe why does Daniel 70 weeks why is it so important because it's our time piece it's telling us exactly where we are exactly where we are for many of us that are here this morning Israel has always been in that little land she was restored back in 1948 that's all that we know but for 2500 years she was dispersed and for many of you young people this message is the only thing you ever knew because your parents came from the dispersion the dispora and they came back to the word but the Jews were out there for 2500 years but at the time appointed the vision shall speak at the time appointed not only speaks for the the the Jewish bride but it also speaks for the Gentile bride let me go just a little bit further and I promise I'm I'm not going to hold you too long Matthew 24:32 he says now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branches yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is now they're asking when are we going to know these things he said was the little fig tree but we find prior to Matthew 24:32 he begins to tell about the signs of the end of the age in 24 3-14 then he speaks about the abomination of desolation in verses 15- 28 then he speaks about the the coming of the son of man in 29 through 31 but we find Israel for the first time for 2500 years is restored again to Jerusalem he says oh people don't let that go over your head he said that's the Fig Tree putting forth its buds this generation he said now 40 years is declared a generation Israel has now been a nation for 76 years how how close are we see the prophecy is being fulfilled the vision is speaking so that gives further Credence that we're living in the hour of fulfillment let me go on a little bit further because I want to show you one more PowerPoint a slide we go here and brother Bown says and it is I oh God we're glad today to see Israel come into our homeland of nation the old sixo star David flying under them Jews returning saying they'll never come back to die in a homel land but they come to see the Messiah oh God now he says now oh goes lce we're watching just as Noah watched Enoch and know immediately after Enoch come the Judgment was going to strike the Earth we see the Ark of the Jew being prepared again we know the translation of the hand the Jews are in the Homeland and and been going back if you get the decline of the world wars he said after the first world war flew over he said they flew over Jerusalem and captured it and it begins God went and began to hard melini's heart Hitler's heart Stalin's heart heart to men all over every country hating the Jew then he goes into Third Exodus he says as it was in Germany up in Russia and Italy the people raised up Joseph's talking about Jose of Stalin and Hitler and and Stalin and melini who hated the Jews they had to go back to their homeline he says God you got ways of doing things we don't understand you pressed him no home in Germany he says he says every everything was taken away from also in Italy and Russia no place to go they were sent back to the Homeland just to fulfill the word and so it is with you Church you have no home in the bride or in the in the Baptist Church in the Pentecostal Methodist Church our homeland is in the word of God he says oh the loving hand of God how sometimes it looks cruel the way the people suffer but it's still it's the tender hand of Jehovah so you're telling me that a second world war 75 million people casualties included military and civilians around 3% of the world's population died in the second world war and it's the tender hand of Jehovah let me give you some numbers many civilians died because of the liberate genocides massacres Mass bombings disease starvations the Soviet Union Russia lost around 27 million people during the war .7 million military 19 million civilians Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses mostly on the Eastern Front during the final battles of Germany Nazi Germany as part of the deliberate program of Extinction and systematically killed over 11 million people including six million Jews in addition to the Nazi concentration camps the Soviet Googs labor camps led to the deaths of 3.6 million people yet after all the Death after all the destruction after all the cruelty and all the wasted life it is still the tender hand of Jehovah God will do what it takes to get his elect into the homeland of the word and he will do the same for the bride he will let Destruction come he will let hard a come he will do whatever it takes because his word will not return void notice she's one of the great time pieces let's put that PowerPoint up if you do he said we found ourselves 40 years coming back since the first world war the Jews have returned back to their Homeland God never did deal with Israel until she was in her Homeland now them Jews them true Jews he said them that never had an opportunity now brother there's your 144,000 there's 12 Tribes of GAD and Asher and Reuben 12 tribes he said they're finally all standing on Mount Si back in the Homeland there they were but we find here in Exodus 19 I'm going to show you some pictures and they're not the best pictures but you'll get the gist of it anyway Exodus 19 we we see it 19 and verse four says you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear you on Eagle wings and brought you unto myself so in May 1949 the country of yeeman allowed the majority of the Jewish population to leave Israel immediately jumped into action you can show the next slide jumped into action launching operation on on the wings of an eagle it's an a covert airlift operation to bring tens of thousands of yemenite Jews to their new Homeland in Israel the operation officially named originated from scripture you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bore You On Eagle's Wings and I brought you to myself Exodus 19 and4 during the operation nickname operation Magic Carpet some 49,000 yite Jews mostly children were airlifted to Israel from yeman Aden and several other places of Saudi Arabia the mission was a a secret only revealed to the media after it was completed next line you see you remember hearing brother bam talk about these things he said they seen a little real played how they were waiting to go back to the Homeland here I have a a story I'm going to share with you from a man by the name of Mr ozrey he was a little four-month old child during this time he said his 20-year-old father and a friend loaded up on their donkeys and went to the market they were in yeman yeman was a very backward country Mr azrey said we didn't have news we didn't have we didn't know what an airplane was if you went to the big city you you'd see a car but very few people went to the big city so only donkeys could you imagine getting a church this morning on a donkey The Village all Jewish in in very close proximity to all Arab Village made up about 40 Jewish families all inter married with each other because they were disconnected from other Jewish communities so everyone was related to everyone the market town was named as big TZ which my grandmother said was about a half a donkey's day ride away on the road they went him he's talking about his father now on the road the two men Mr Oz's father and another gentleman they met a stranger also on donkey back the man was a eski Jew he didn't look Jewish but he said the Shalom Alum to them and they just looked at them and startled they said who are you and he said said I'm a shelc or the messenger from etrit Israel and Israel a state whose existence had they had not heard yet although it was in the land that they believed someday their descendants would visit they said you don't look Jewish but the shelc started reciting the Shima and by the end of the first paragraph they said we believe you he goes he goes on to say he goes these three were men were able to talk to each other because the Y Jews still spoke Biblical Hebrew as a living language and the shc said you should go back to our homeland he told me he says we have our own State now we have a leader whose name is David benu and another leader another leader whose name is moshi moshi sherad who followed bingan his prime minister and they asked how did we get there they said they're airplanes you can show the next Slide the airplanes will be waiting for you in addin the British control yemenese Seaport about two week donkey R away so they asked him and said what is an airplane he he took out a piece of paper out of his pocket and he drew it threw on and he looked at it he said what looks like an eagle next slide he said that's what God promised to send us back on in Exodus next slide God talks about bringing Israelites out of Egypt On Eagle's Wings and the promise of in gathering of the Exiles on eagles's wings echoes in Jewish Jewish dreams he goes now back on the the dusty road to yea the man poured out a loaf of bread out of his bag and he said now I brought this for you so take it back to the vision the the village and show them and tell them so my father and his friend turned around they went back to the village and they stood stood by Rabbi and the rabbi said to assemble everyone in the synagogue and they said the service for gratitude and Thanksgiving they also said the blessings for new things then the rabbi told everybody to be ready to move in five days and in five days they left and they rode their donkeys to at next life so they went to ad and the jdc and the Jewish agency took good care of them and they prayed that God will send eagles wings that was the air lft sometimes known as operation flying carpet but known to the people who brought brought their new Liv on the wings of an eagle next slide you see next slide go forward to the next slide now they're on the ples heading back next slide here they are the yemenite Jews who didn't know what an airplane was but they knew there was a Homeland that they've been waiting for to get back to that fulfilled Exodus 14 and9 and we find here next slide here we find brother Brandon would tell us he says notice he says then when the old Rabbi stood out there and he seen the pl land them Jews he says you read it in the magazine they're still plying with wooden plows and when they seen the thing sat down that wasn't going around it the old Rabbi stood there and he says remember our Prophet said we're going to go home to our homeland and we'll be carried Back On Eagle's Wings and they asked are you going back to the Homeland to die he said no we're going back to the Homeland to see our Messiah what am I telling you Church we're not going back to the homeland of this word to die we're going back to meet the Lord Jesus that's why I sent you a message that's why we got a prophet in this day we're going to meet the Lord in the skies musicians come what God does for natural Israel he does for the supernatural for the spiritual Israel oh hallelujah we're going back to our homeland not to die but we're going back we're going back to see the Messiah we're going back to see our Lord and we also let me just end with this last scripture as I break this down for this we say this is 1 Thessalonians 4 verse1 15 for this we say by the word of the Lord that we which are alive or remain at the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the dead and Christ shall rise then we which our Al remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words notice in the Rapture message I believe that's our message I believe we can take comfort in the Rapture message he says three things have to happen a shout what is a shout it's a message going forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride that's why you're here church you've heard the shout he says now he goes God God has a way of doing things he never changes his policy he never changes he's an unchanging God Amos 3:7 he said he would do nothing on the earth until he reverse reveal it to his servant the prophets so the shout brings forth the bride getting a people ready he says now we come through the church ages but were're promised in the last days according to Malachi 4 that there would be a return again a prophet in the lamb that's right notice his nature what he would do notice he said he used the the the spirit of Elijah five times but the first thing is a shout he starts to ascending from heaven and there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together oh we may have been dispersed but he came with a shout and went around the globe seven times to get the little bride together to get her ready for what for a homecoming time a shout of message get the people together a second is the voice of the Resurrection the same voice the loud voice in St John 11: 38-44 that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together then the resurrection of the Dead to be caught up with it now watch these three things take place the next is what a trumpet he says now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets is the calling the people to the feast that'll be the bride supper oh Hallelujah the Lamb's supper with the bride the first thing comes of fourth is a message the calling of the Bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeper bride the ones that died back in other ages that were caught and the thirds the trumpet the Feast of Heaven in the sky why he says that's the thing that takes place friends and he goes therefore the message calls the bride together the same one with a loud voice he screamed out with a shout and a voice and he woke Lazareth with a loud voice he cried Lazarus come forth and the voice wakes up the sleeping bride sleeping dead and the trumpet with the sound of a trumpet and when he does it he calls he says always a trumpet called Israel to the Feast of trumpets which was a Pentecostal Feast a great feast in the sky and the Feast of the trumpets now a trumpet do you announce a calling together come to the feast and that's what we're waiting on brother and sister we have heard the shout we have heard the voice and we're waiting on the call come up hither my people and be not partakers with her plagues we've heard the voice we responded to the voice we've heard the shout we've woken ourselves up from a slumber we come out of the denominational Creeds and we're back in the Homeland and can I tell you the vision is speaking the vision is speaking we've received the message and that's why you're here wherefore he tells us wherefore Comfort one another with these words you don't have to Fred you don't have to worry comfort one another you've heard the shout you've heard the voice and you're waiting for the trumpet God bless you Saints it's been
