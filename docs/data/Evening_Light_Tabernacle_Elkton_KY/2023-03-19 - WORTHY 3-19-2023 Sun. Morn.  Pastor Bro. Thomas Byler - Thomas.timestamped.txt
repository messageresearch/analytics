[17:29] would you pray over
[18:07] children can be dismissed
[18:21] we will read psalms 122.
[18:24] she'll turn with me
[18:40] I was glad when they said unto me let us
[18:44] go into the house of the Lord
[18:52] Jerusalem is builded as a city that is
[18:57] together
[19:06] for there are set Thrones of judgment
[19:08] the Thrones of the House of David
[19:17] peace be within thy walls and prosperity
[19:20] within thy palaces
[19:29] because of the house of the Lord Our God
[19:32] I will seek thy good
[19:36] everyone can be seated
[19:38] brother Brian
[19:48] brother Brian's not here this morning
[19:50] but uh so
[19:54] so I'm going to be doing Sunday school
[19:55] so we'll see how it goes
[19:58] got some stuff together but usually some
[20:00] well a lot of times it don't go quite
[20:01] like you're playing it to go so that's
[20:03] that's life I guess but I know
[20:07] Let's uh
[20:09] if you could let's go to uh
[20:12] Luke here
[20:19] Luke 17.
[20:22] trust everybody's had a good week
[20:24] a little bit cold but
[20:27] we're heading in the right direction I
[20:29] believe so
[20:30] Luke 17 this is just a one little
[20:33] scripture we'll try to we'll bounce it
[20:34] through the scriptures just a little bit
[20:36] here
[20:37] and this is Jesus
[20:40] and uh
[20:43] kind of just going over things this
[20:46] morning be kind of like a glass half
[20:48] empty glass half full type of people
[20:50] what what kind of people are we
[20:52] so Jesus says here he's saying to his
[20:54] disciples then said he unto his
[20:56] disciples this is 17 1.
[20:59] it is impossible but
[21:01] that offenses will come but wound him
[21:04] through whom they come so Jesus was
[21:06] telling him his disciples that offenses
[21:09] are going to come he said
[21:13] it is impossible but that offense is
[21:15] will come so telling him that offenses
[21:17] are going to come so we know that
[21:19] offenses are coming so then
[21:22] what are we going to do when they come
[21:25] we have choices of how we act and react
[21:27] to him
[21:28] uh then let's go here let's see to
[21:31] Romans
[21:34] Romans
[21:36] 9 and we'll start in 20 here
[21:44] Romans 9 20.
[21:47] nay but oh man who art thou that replies
[21:50] against God shall the thing form say
[21:53] unto him that formed it why hast Thou
[21:56] made me thus and not the Potter power
[21:59] over the clay of the same lump to make
[22:01] one vessel onto honor and another unto
[22:03] dishonor
[22:04] what if God willing to show his wrath
[22:07] and make his power known endured with
[22:09] much long-suffering vessels of Wrath to
[22:12] destruction that he might make known The
[22:14] Riches of his glory on the vessels of
[22:16] Mercy which he had for prepared under
[22:19] Glory
[22:20] even unto whom Heath called not of the
[22:23] Jews only but also the Gentiles people
[22:25] who can't see predestination that right
[22:28] there is a predestination scripture in
[22:30] my opinion I'll go back to Jeremiah
[22:32] talking about the Potter again
[22:34] and that's what come to church that's
[22:37] go down they say it go down to The
[22:40] Potter's House
[22:42] to be broken over and
[22:44] sometimes made over and get all that
[22:46] stuff out that we don't want in us
[22:47] anymore so uh Jeremiah chapter 18.
[22:52] and starting in verse 1 here
[22:57] the word which came to Jeremiah
[23:00] I can't wait just a little
[23:04] Jeremiah chapter 18 verse 1 the word
[23:07] which came to Jeremiah from the Lord
[23:09] saying arise and go down to The Potter's
[23:11] House and there I will cause thee to
[23:13] hear my words
[23:14] and then I went down to The Potter's
[23:16] House behold he wrought a work on the
[23:19] Wheel
[23:20] the wheels and the vessel that he made
[23:22] of clay was marred in the hand of the
[23:24] Potter so he made it again another
[23:26] vessel as seemed good to the Potter to
[23:28] make it then the word of the Lord came
[23:31] to me saying O House of Israel cannot I
[23:33] do with you as this Potter saith the
[23:35] Lord behold as the clay is in The
[23:37] Potter's hands so are ye in my hands O
[23:40] House of Israel it's again just being
[23:42] made over by the Potter
[23:45] and uh
[23:48] sometimes well
[23:51] a lot of times things don't go it's
[23:54] quite like we always plan it just like
[23:56] coming up trying to prepare something it
[23:58] doesn't always go as you plant it that's
[23:59] that is kind of how life goes a lot of
[24:01] times we have a idea in our mind how
[24:05] things should go but a lot of times the
[24:07] Lord has a different
[24:08] different plan for us than what we think
[24:10] of that our life should go
[24:13] and so
[24:14] sometimes it gets hard well a lot of
[24:16] times it does get hard actually so but
[24:19] uh
[24:20] let's see uh so I was going back
[24:25] let's go to
[24:28] but it molds us and basically makes us
[24:31] into what God would have for us nobody
[24:33] wants really difficult situations and
[24:35] nobody wants
[24:36] buses and fights but sometimes that's
[24:38] what we have coming in our life it molds
[24:41] us makes us and presses into what God
[24:43] would want for us
[24:44] especially in today's age we don't want
[24:46] hardships uh we live in a really really
[24:50] easy easy age rich and they think
[24:55] they're they're increased with knowledge
[24:56] but
[24:57] strange knowledge but they but they're
[25:00] rich they don't want no hardships
[25:02] everything's supposed to be easy
[25:04] it's a ladyfc and age that we're living
[25:06] and they want smooth sailing
[25:08] but even as we look back through the
[25:10] scriptures a lot of times God God's
[25:12] people they didn't really have smooth
[25:14] ceilings a lot of times it got really
[25:15] rough like Paul he didn't he and this is
[25:18] the other thing we wouldn't choose our
[25:20] you guys might choose I wouldn't choose
[25:23] sometimes these hardships that come upon
[25:25] us
[25:26] but they're there for the pressing and
[25:27] the making of what we're supposed to be
[25:29] and how we're going to come out on the
[25:31] end
[25:31] Paul didn't he didn't want that thorn of
[25:34] thorn in his flesh because Paul he
[25:36] didn't even want that form of Flesh it
[25:38] was it wasn't his choice
[25:40] but God Did It for Paul to to bring
[25:42] humiliation so he said that he wouldn't
[25:44] get puffed up he said in him he's and
[25:47] when he realized that then Paul said he
[25:49] accepted it and he he glorified our Lord
[25:53] and glorified in his infirmities that's
[25:56] here in the last one here let's see
[25:59] I think it's over here such a one-hour
[26:01] Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but
[26:05] in my infirmities
[26:06] Paul speaking for though I would desire
[26:08] to Glory I shall not be a fool for I
[26:10] will say the truth but how I forbear
[26:12] lest any man should think of me above
[26:14] that which you seeth me to be
[26:17] for that he heareth of me
[26:19] or that he heareth of me unless I should
[26:21] be exalted above measure through the
[26:23] abundance of the Revelation there was
[26:25] given to me as a thorn in the flesh
[26:26] messenger of Satan to buff at me let's
[26:29] say should not be exalted above measure
[26:31] for this thing I ever sought the Lord
[26:33] Thrice that it might depart from me
[26:36] and he said unto me my grace is
[26:38] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[26:39] made perfect
[26:41] in weakness
[26:43] most gladly therefore will I rather
[26:46] glory in my infirmities that the power
[26:47] of Christ May rest upon me therefore I
[26:50] take pleasure and Infinities and risk
[26:51] approaches and necessities and
[26:53] persecutions and distresses for Christ's
[26:55] sake for when I am weak then I am strong
[26:59] Paul said and Brendan said it too
[27:03] well I'll read it I don't know you
[27:05] better let's see I got it right here
[27:07] brother Bear's talking about tensions
[27:10] and and tensions in life whoever
[27:13] speaking of how we have these different
[27:14] tensions and things
[27:16] speaking of tension I was praying about
[27:17] it this morning what would you do if you
[27:19] didn't have any tension just think of it
[27:21] tension is a part of a living that kind
[27:23] of encouraged me when I thought of it
[27:25] that way had if you had no tension you'd
[27:28] be like a rag doll you wouldn't have no
[27:29] feelings there'd be nothing
[27:32] nothing you could work on like a husband
[27:34] and wife me wants to do something
[27:36] they're trying to work together
[27:37] especially Christians the other one once
[27:39] then when you come together to you you
[27:41] find out
[27:42] what she's done she finds out see the
[27:45] tension really brings you closer
[27:46] together and somebody tells you that
[27:47] well said just think of the little wife
[27:49] that went under a lot of tension then
[27:51] you wasn't so good or the husband went
[27:53] under some tension when you wasn't so
[27:54] good and then it's all forgiven look how
[27:57] you feel about it uh he said see have
[28:00] tension that's all I think of of feet yo
[28:04] feelings
[28:06] what if you didn't have any feelings no
[28:07] pains or nothing
[28:09] what if they're what be no no pain at
[28:12] all you'd have no feelings at all see if
[28:14] you had no feeling then one of your
[28:16] senses would be gone everything's uh God
[28:19] just give us Grace to stand up to it
[28:21] that's the thing if we just stand up
[28:23] with the grace and stand there and say
[28:24] we know that when this is life is over
[28:26] the great ones on the other side where
[28:28] we'll be looking to go to and we'll
[28:29] remember all these things that's tension
[28:32] and then some uh people uh some people
[28:35] tries to introduce Christianity and you
[28:37] feel free from worry
[28:40] he said no you're not you're free you're
[28:43] free from tension he said oh no you add
[28:46] tension when you become a Christian
[28:47] because you was kind of a slop go happy
[28:51] go lucky whatever it was out there not
[28:53] caring what you did
[28:54] but when you become a CR a real
[28:56] Christian every moment you're wondering
[28:58] am I pleasing my Lord if I could hear
[29:00] from him it puts you on attention puts
[29:02] you on a guard
[29:03] that's what makes you T makes you what
[29:06] you are so after all tension is a
[29:08] blessing
[29:09] it's just the way where you're looking
[29:11] at it just the way you're looking at it
[29:14] if you just look at the other side
[29:16] there's no matter how thin you slice
[29:18] anything you still got two sides to it
[29:20] you see so you want to see both sides so
[29:23] tension I think is what's the tension if
[29:25] I could could have been born without
[29:27] this tension well it wouldn't have
[29:29] if I could have been wrong with us well
[29:31] if I wouldn't have had this tension I
[29:34] wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't
[29:36] have been a Christian perhaps it was a
[29:39] tension that drove me to Jesus Christ
[29:40] see so it's been a blessing thing to me
[29:42] so then as Paul said as though tension
[29:45] something another he had consulted the
[29:47] Lord take it away the Lord said Saul my
[29:49] Paul's Grace uh to Paul his grace is
[29:51] sufficient he said then I'll glory in my
[29:53] infirmities when when I'm weak I'm
[29:55] strong as long as the will of God all
[29:57] right and brother Branham says now I
[29:59] consulted him one time when it used to
[30:01] bother me so bad it scared me
[30:03] and he told me this is about brother man
[30:05] talking about tension in his life about
[30:07] eight or ten years ago he said it'll
[30:09] never scare you again and it never has
[30:11] no sir don't worry about it I just feel
[30:14] it but I know it's there but I just go
[30:16] on because it doesn't scare me no more
[30:19] so thankful for that
[30:21] now this is what brother Brown said he
[30:23] said he could now he could have said it
[30:25] won't be there no more and that's why a
[30:27] lot of times we want we want it gone
[30:31] but he said you won't be scared no more
[30:34] so it is his will that it happens so I
[30:37] just embrace it and say thank you Lord
[30:39] I'll walk that way
[30:40] brother Branham said so that's how it
[30:43] was for brother Branham that's how it
[30:44] was for Paul I guess we sometimes think
[30:47] it might be different for us and
[30:48] sometimes it is sometimes the Lord takes
[30:50] things away from us and we don't have to
[30:51] worry about anymore and sometimes
[30:53] it bothers and lags and lags and lags on
[30:56] us it creates attention in our life
[30:58] but I believe that tension is to draw us
[31:00] back to Christ it
[31:03] and really uh you know it takes the Holy
[31:07] Ghost
[31:08] to say just like Paul said I've I've
[31:12] asked Thrice now for it to be taken away
[31:14] from me but it wasn't taken away from me
[31:16] Lord in in my weakness Thou Art strong I
[31:20] become strong so it takes the Holy Ghost
[31:23] to say that in those times because
[31:25] otherwise you know then there's a lot of
[31:27] people that do it they get angry at the
[31:29] situation and sometimes we we struggle
[31:31] through life it's not not easy but
[31:34] basically that's the idea you know is
[31:37] the tension
[31:38] that it's brought a lot of times for the
[31:41] breaking down of us and to really
[31:45] really help us a long life's journey I
[31:48] have a lot of other stuff here but
[31:50] that's pretty much what I had there so
[31:52] I don't know I think I'm about one time
[31:55] so Brother David
[32:03] of the Lord this morning
[32:05] I thought that was very good
[32:07] sure helped me and brother Woody said it
[32:09] helped him this morning and you know our
[32:12] heavenly father he knows what we have
[32:13] need of this morning
[32:15] amen let's stand this morning and
[32:17] sing that little course

[1:01:33] um
[1:01:36] read the fifth chapter amen and we'll go
[1:01:39] from there and when I saw and I saw in
[1:01:42] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:01:44] throne a book written within and on the
[1:01:46] back side sealed with Seven Seals and I
[1:01:49] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:01:52] loud voice
[1:01:53] who is worthy amen now or that's what
[1:01:56] we're going to speak on worthiness
[1:01:58] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:02:01] loose the seals thereof and no man in
[1:02:04] Heaven Nor in Earth nor under the Earth
[1:02:06] was able to open the book neither to
[1:02:09] look thereon and I wept much and I
[1:02:12] remember this that brother banham said
[1:02:13] that John the Revelator here was a type
[1:02:16] of the Bride amen of the church isn't it
[1:02:19] right and he was the type of it I went
[1:02:21] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:02:24] open and to read the book neither
[1:02:27] to look there on and one of the elders
[1:02:30] said unto me wheat not Behold The Lion
[1:02:32] of the tribe of Judah the root of David
[1:02:35] hath prevailed to open the book into
[1:02:37] loose the Seven Seals thereof
[1:02:40] and I be held in low in the midst of the
[1:02:42] Throne of the and of the four beasts and

[1:02:47] it had been slain remember Wednesday we

[1:03:04] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[1:03:06] the Earth and he came and took the book
[1:03:09] out of the right hand of him that sat
[1:03:10] upon the throne and when he had taken
[1:03:13] the book The Four beasts and the Four
[1:03:15] and Twenty Elders fell down before the
[1:03:18] lamb having every one of them Harps and
[1:03:21] golden vials full of odors which are the
[1:03:23] prayers of the Saints
[1:03:25] and they sang a new song saying Thou Art
[1:03:28] Worthy to take the book now notice Thou
[1:03:32] Art Worthy how many believes that he is
[1:03:34] worthy this morning we want to take a

[1:03:59] and nation and that's made us into our
[1:04:01] God Kings and Priests and we shall reign
[1:04:05] on Earth and I beheld and I heard the
[1:04:08] voice of many angels round about the
[1:04:11] throne and the beasts and the elders and
[1:04:15] the number of them was Ten Thousand
[1:04:18] Times Ten thousands and thousands of

[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:08] oh I wrote down all these different
[1:06:10] things amen that he's worthy of
[1:06:12] but I want to read a couple more
[1:06:14] scriptures just to lay the foundation if
[1:06:16] I could Wednesday we read on the eighth
[1:06:18] verse of the fourth chapter it says and
[1:06:20] when those beasts give Glory let's go
[1:06:22] back up one and the four beasts verse
[1:06:25] eight and had each of them six wings
[1:06:27] about them and they were full of eyes
[1:06:29] within and they rest not day nor night
[1:06:32] saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[1:06:37] which was and which is and which is to
[1:06:39] come now part of my whole inspiration
[1:06:42] was the things that I've heard about
[1:06:44] Azusa Street and different revivals and
[1:06:46] when they start they don't stop they
[1:06:49] keep right on going
[1:06:51] you know the touch of Heaven A blending
[1:06:54] of heaven and worship the way that it is
[1:06:56] up there coming down even to where they
[1:06:59] even hear angels and uh and brother
[1:07:01] Branham talked about uh having I haven't
[1:07:03] heard that in certain churches in
[1:07:05] certain places you know how hard the
[1:07:07] Angelic choir would even join in
[1:07:11] you know how many knows that when we get
[1:07:12] over Yonder there's not going to be any
[1:07:14] night there

[1:07:18] going to be doing constantly
[1:07:20] yeah
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:23] praise be to God
[1:07:25] you know I can't help but believe that
[1:07:28] if we're going to do something over
[1:07:29] there or be something over there
[1:07:32] that we're going to have to be at over
[1:07:34] on this side
[1:07:35] because remember father God said hi
[1:07:37] everyone you go from this Dimension to
[1:07:38] the other you mean you don't change it
[1:07:40] doesn't change your character or what
[1:07:42] you are amen

[1:07:50] there there don't you know you know and
[1:07:52] I'll tell you what we might be a quiet
[1:07:54] maybe we're quiet worshipers here
[1:07:58] but I'm telling you why when we get over
[1:08:00] there we're going to make a lot of noise
[1:08:01] remember this is going to be a noisy
[1:08:03] place over there

[1:08:23] I don't think for sure will follow the
[1:08:24] leading in the spirit is that okay
[1:08:27] all right so now notice here now that
[1:08:30] scares you all to death already I
[1:08:31] shouldn't do that all right
[1:08:34] so he said now notice here it says they
[1:08:37] said the rest not day or night amen
[1:08:40] saying holy holy holy

[1:09:12] eight it says I am Alpha and Omega the
[1:09:16] beginning and the ending
[1:09:19] talk about predestination for knowledge
[1:09:21] huh Bible says he's the beginning and
[1:09:25] he's the ending he already knows all of
[1:09:27] it
[1:09:28] he's the star he's the Finish
[1:09:32] he is he which was noticed in worshiping
[1:09:35] for what this is one of the reasons why
[1:09:37] they're worshiping him is because he is
[1:09:40] the one that was he's the one that is
[1:09:43] and he's the one that always will be you
[1:09:46] and I we've got a short little old
[1:09:48] lifespan here
[1:09:50] isn't that right but he don't never
[1:09:52] start he don't never finish
[1:09:58] he never stops
[1:10:00] he always wants help me with me
[1:10:09] I wrote down here I says man you have
[1:10:12] got to let it get all over you
[1:10:15] how many believe that
[1:10:17] you know I can preach I'm gonna preach
[1:10:18] this morning and if you'll open up
[1:10:20] because I'll tell you what as I study
[1:10:22] and as I read and as God reveals these
[1:10:25] things to me and as I hope put myself up
[1:10:27] for this it does some it does some
[1:10:31] awesome things
[1:10:33] really does something for you if you're
[1:10:35] going to get any out of church if you're
[1:10:37] going to get anything this morning
[1:10:38] you're going to have to just get it all
[1:10:40] up in it you're gonna have to let go
[1:10:41] amen
[1:10:42] get at it get all over you
[1:10:46] because I may I I'm a thorough believer
[1:10:49] for that
[1:10:51] well one thing but the man says we're
[1:10:52] living way below our privileges
[1:10:55] huh so I don't know about you but I'd
[1:10:57] rather come up a little I've been higher
[1:10:59] to my my privileges
[1:11:04] foreign
[1:11:05] amen and this is just going to be a
[1:11:07] start because all these things that
[1:11:09] we've read already
[1:11:11] we could probably take all summer on
[1:11:17] all summer on notice which is now notice
[1:11:21] the beginning and the end saith the Lord
[1:11:26] he didn't say God saith the Lord he just
[1:11:28] saith the Lord
[1:11:29] which is and which was
[1:11:33] now notice they said which was which
[1:11:34] isn't it to come his spirit says it
[1:11:37] which ears which was and which is to
[1:11:40] come the Almighty
[1:11:44] how many beliefs he's the Almighty
[1:11:49] amen Almighty
[1:11:52] I want to talk about
[1:11:55] how that he's worthy of Glory
[1:11:59] honor
[1:12:01] power nobody said
[1:12:05] let me see here
[1:12:08] in verse 11 of chapter four now I'd like
[1:12:11] for you to have your Bibles with me and
[1:12:13] follow me with me today if you would
[1:12:14] with these scriptures
[1:12:17] because sometimes I want you to just
[1:12:20] read it out there with me amen
[1:12:23] say it with me why because we're going
[1:12:25] to be saying it together over there
[1:12:27] isn't that right they're all saying it
[1:12:30] so we want to say it
[1:12:32] amen
[1:12:35] let's read chapter 4 verse 11 together
[1:12:42] thou
[1:12:43] are you there yet
[1:12:45] Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory
[1:12:50] and honor and power for thou has created
[1:12:55] all things and for thy pleasure they are
[1:12:58] and were created
[1:13:01] now when you and I think of pleasure we
[1:13:04] think of fun don't we
[1:13:06] if we was to use the word pleasure we
[1:13:08] said we're going to go ahead and have
[1:13:10] some fun so God did his all this for his
[1:13:13] own fun
[1:13:14] for his own pleasure
[1:13:16] this is what God did for his own
[1:13:19] pleasure
[1:13:21] don't even think of telling God what to
[1:13:23] do and what he can't can't do
[1:13:25] amen
[1:13:28] foreign
[1:13:36] just blows my mind
[1:13:40] just the thought of God
[1:13:50] in that Isaiah 40
[1:13:54] verse 20 it says there is no searching
[1:13:57] of his understanding
[1:14:00] our puny Minds aren't big enough to ever
[1:14:03] search God out and figure him out
[1:14:06] there is no searching of his
[1:14:08] understanding
[1:14:09] amen
[1:14:12] praise the Lord
[1:14:15] so we see here now I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:14:17] cover some ground here with the help of
[1:14:20] the Lord but let's just talk about what
[1:14:23] he's worthy of
[1:14:26] and let me back up just a minute
[1:14:29] first of all
[1:14:31] the chapter that we just read to me I
[1:14:34] guess has to be one of the most
[1:14:37] outstanding chapters in The Bible why
[1:14:41] because if he is not worthy to redeem
[1:14:45] and take that book then All Is Lost
[1:14:49] all of humanity Adam and Eve and
[1:14:52] everybody from there on is gone they're
[1:14:55] all lost he has to absolutely throw us
[1:14:58] all into hell he has to be absolutely
[1:15:00] destroy everybody he's all lost if he is
[1:15:03] not worthy
[1:15:04] to take that book
[1:15:07] no man was found worthy and John began
[1:15:10] to weep you mean it's all lost
[1:15:14] huh
[1:15:16] and another one came and said don't weep
[1:15:18] God we find one that's Worthy
[1:15:24] I'm here to tell you we're going to talk
[1:15:26] about this through this season's changes
[1:15:29] of Eternity we're going to be worshiping
[1:15:32] this one that was Worthy
[1:15:39] how many believe it
[1:15:41] if y'all notice that all of the whole
[1:15:44] crop Heavenly Angels the 420 others all
[1:15:47] ten thousands times ten thousand they
[1:15:50] all fall down before him and
[1:15:52] a worship Him
[1:15:56] why because they said thou aren't Worthy
[1:16:07] he acts Worthy
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:12] all right
[1:16:14] I want to
[1:16:15] secondly we're going to begin to talk
[1:16:17] about
[1:16:19] uh
[1:16:23] well let's just do this
[1:16:25] so we see here these four words we find
[1:16:32] in verse 9 of chapter four are you if
[1:16:35] you're with me
[1:16:36] he says and when those beasts give what
[1:16:39] they give Glory
[1:16:41] in honor
[1:16:43] and thanks
[1:16:44] now notice here that thanks comes in to
[1:16:47] play how many believe that in worshiping
[1:16:51] God thanks has to be into play
[1:16:56] it has to be in the play because why
[1:16:58] because of what he done we're grateful
[1:17:01] we're thankful for what he done
[1:17:04] give thanks with a grateful heart give
[1:17:08] thanks to the Holy One give thanks
[1:17:12] because he's given Jesus Christ his son
[1:17:16] amen
[1:17:19] enjoyed the Sunday school this morning
[1:17:20] but I tried but I had it right here on
[1:17:22] my sheet right here it says Paul gave
[1:17:24] glory to God in his weakness for when he
[1:17:27] is weak and God is strong
[1:17:30] amen glory praise the Lord notice give
[1:17:34] him glory that's one of the first topics
[1:17:36] we want to talk about once I get get
[1:17:38] started here
[1:17:39] give glory and honor and thanks to him
[1:17:43] that liveth forever and ever now I
[1:17:45] notice down in verse 11. when you've
[1:17:47] already seen glory honor
[1:17:52] Gloria
[1:17:54] Glory I am power also he's worthy of
[1:17:57] power
[1:17:58] because he has created all things and
[1:18:01] for thy plan
[1:18:03] were created
[1:18:05] I don't know if I'll get to it but it
[1:18:07] comes into my mind right now and I want
[1:18:08] to say it before I don't that is the
[1:18:09] Bible says one place the scripture says
[1:18:11] and I I read it and then I lost it but
[1:18:13] it says the whole earth is full of his
[1:18:17] glory
[1:18:20] how many believe that
[1:18:21] the Earth is full of his glory you can
[1:18:24] talk about one thing and praise be to
[1:18:27] God just to think of how that the sun
[1:18:30] makes a perfect a complete turn in 24
[1:18:33] hours
[1:18:34] and it came perfect time
[1:18:37] why are you so excited about that well
[1:18:40] I'm excited because I know it's god
[1:18:42] making that happen
[1:18:51] amen that's just one
[1:18:54] the whole earth is full of his glory you
[1:18:57] can see God everywhere right
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:10] something's happening to me
[1:19:13] I don't know just what it is but I like
[1:19:14] it
[1:19:16] something's happening to the world isn't
[1:19:18] that right it's getting darker and
[1:19:20] darker
[1:19:21] you know on Tuesday they're supposed to
[1:19:22] arrest Trump right
[1:19:24] and we all know in the all states are
[1:19:26] going to be a dark day because it's a
[1:19:28] representative of what they would do
[1:19:30] with any conservative
[1:19:32] what they want to do hello
[1:19:34] it's a dark hour the world's getting
[1:19:35] darker but God's doing
[1:19:38] people too that's what I'm looking for
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:42] it's going to get darker it's going to
[1:19:43] get worse out there
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:50] all right
[1:19:52] let's focus on this not the negative now
[1:19:54] let's look at this so he says also here
[1:19:57] and power you're worthy of honor and
[1:20:00] power for those created all things now
[1:20:02] over in verse 13 we go over it again if
[1:20:06] that's all right Worthy is a lamb that
[1:20:08] was verse 12 that to receive power
[1:20:12] okay notice power verse chapter 5 verse
[1:20:16] 12. if you want to follow
[1:20:18] now they were saying with a loud voice
[1:20:22] [Applause]
[1:20:24] you know I mean you know me I'm a loud
[1:20:28] person
[1:20:30] you know you clad people that's
[1:20:31] wonderful but I'm a loud person
[1:20:34] folks you know
[1:20:37] Worthy is the Lamb that was slam slain
[1:20:40] to receive
[1:20:46] receipt and here's another one wisdom
[1:20:50] boy that's going to be a good one when
[1:20:52] we get to that
[1:20:54] I'm just gonna say it get ahead of
[1:20:57] myself all right
[1:20:58] human beings
[1:21:01] they are so they're dumber than the
[1:21:04] animal kingdom
[1:21:09] now I'm not talking about Christians and
[1:21:12] people that serve in reverence God but
[1:21:13] I'm talking about the others
[1:21:16] because a cow's smart a horse is oh and
[1:21:19] you're not just some dumbass they're
[1:21:21] very smart they know who they are they
[1:21:23] know what they are and they do exactly
[1:21:25] what God has Instinct them to do
[1:21:28] they follow it to the letter
[1:21:30] you don't see you don't see a deer
[1:21:33] modifying or all these other birds
[1:21:34] modifying they make the nests like they
[1:21:36] always did
[1:21:38] they're smart they follow the things
[1:21:41] that God has given but Humanity they
[1:21:43] don't know whether they're male or
[1:21:45] female come on folks
[1:21:47] they look worse than you know and I say
[1:21:49] that they don't know who they are
[1:21:51] where'd he come from what they're here
[1:21:53] for
[1:22:00] and and I say that because of the
[1:22:02] prophet of God saying that morally our
[1:22:05] women have gotten worse than a dog or a
[1:22:06] or a hog or a dog or whatever else
[1:22:09] isn't that right he says our morals our
[1:22:12] morals are worse than the animal kingdom
[1:22:16] yeah that's right man with man win with
[1:22:19] you don't find that in the animal
[1:22:20] kingdom folks you find a big old fight
[1:22:22] going on
[1:22:24] that's right
[1:22:25] but now and as human beings
[1:22:28] boy oh boy when God created us can I say
[1:22:31] this he created us with the ability to
[1:22:34] become really dumb
[1:22:38] I said the ability to become
[1:22:41] but he also give the believer the
[1:22:43] ability to have the wisdom of God
[1:22:46] to be a son and daughter of God and to
[1:22:48] look like Christ
[1:22:49] how many believe that
[1:22:51] amen thank God for that
[1:22:55] Total Insanity didn't know what the
[1:22:57] prophet God said the whole world go into
[1:22:58] sanity and insane
[1:23:01] amen and that's where we are amen
[1:23:04] okay so that was just a little thought
[1:23:06] on wisdom God is the Fountain of all
[1:23:09] wisdom isn't that right
[1:23:12] all right so he's worthy of wisdom and
[1:23:15] spirit thanks
[1:23:20] thanks
[1:23:21] and honor and glory and also blessing
[1:23:26] amen how many know that we all enjoy the
[1:23:28] blessings of God but sometimes we need
[1:23:31] to bless God
[1:23:33] to bring those blessings back to him
[1:23:38] oh my
[1:23:42] God all right
[1:23:43] now notice isn't it something that
[1:23:45] we read it in chapter verse 12 and then
[1:23:48] and in third verse 13 he says it again
[1:23:51] and every creature is in heaven and
[1:23:53] earth and under the earth and the Sea
[1:23:54] and all over that are in heard I saying
[1:23:56] blessing and honor and glory and power
[1:23:58] begin to be to him that sits on the
[1:24:01] throne and unto the lamb forever and
[1:24:04] ever
[1:24:07] think about it they're praising him
[1:24:11] forever and ever and ever
[1:24:14] [Music]
[1:24:17] oh my you get tired of church
[1:24:22] you sure gonna get tired over there
[1:24:26] huh
[1:24:27] what's the brother man say about church
[1:24:29] service he's a Believer can stay alive
[1:24:32] we have short services for those that
[1:24:34] come and maybe uh you know or not
[1:24:37] whatever it ought to be with the Lord
[1:24:38] and uh you know not to wear them out we
[1:24:41] want them to come back
[1:24:43] but we could say all night if the Holy
[1:24:44] Spirit comes and does something in that
[1:24:46] right believe you can because this is
[1:24:48] what we live for
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:57] praise the Lord
[1:24:59] glory and honor and power those are the
[1:25:03] same blessing and honor and glory and
[1:25:06] power be to him that setteth on the
[1:25:08] throne
[1:25:09] amen
[1:25:13] and the four beasts said
[1:25:17] hey
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:23] somebody tell me right quick raise your
[1:25:25] hand what does amen mean
[1:25:27] there you go brother Glenn very quick
[1:25:30] that means so beer
[1:25:33] oh my you see how that can do that is a
[1:25:36] worship word
[1:25:38] that's confirming God sin that's right
[1:25:40] God said it so let it be written so let
[1:25:43] it be done so be it if I said it show me
[1:25:48] it
[1:25:52] boy I mean if he would have just said
[1:25:54] that
[1:25:56] it said well I'm not so sure about that
[1:26:00] huh the devil got even said well you
[1:26:03] know maybe he doesn't really mean what
[1:26:04] he said no she should have said God
[1:26:07] show me it
[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:15] but we got a bride in his end time that
[1:26:17] believes that that's going to say so be
[1:26:19] it
[1:26:20] God said it he spoke it through a
[1:26:22] prophet I believe it that settles it
[1:26:33] straight is the gate listen to that
[1:26:36] sermon brother bam talks about there's
[1:26:38] millions and billions of so-called
[1:26:40] Christians that don't know more about
[1:26:41] God than the hot dot knows about Jones
[1:26:43] shoes and so forth
[1:26:44] so-called Christians
[1:26:46] I know why he said it
[1:26:48] because later on he talked about how God
[1:26:50] can come down and do the very same thing
[1:26:51] time and time and time and time again
[1:26:53] and they won't believe it yet they call
[1:26:55] themselves Christians
[1:27:00] let me tell you something when God come
[1:27:02] down and he spoke you are from so and so
[1:27:05] your name is from so and so and this
[1:27:06] Center the other that was a little
[1:27:07] longer brother Branham
[1:27:09] that was a lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:13] speaking through him doing the very same
[1:27:15] things he did back then
[1:27:18] and the world will burn because they
[1:27:20] don't believe that
[1:27:25] amen
[1:27:27] can I say El to you something good are
[1:27:29] you ready you will go to heaven because
[1:27:31] you do believe that
[1:27:34] he that believeth shall be saved he that
[1:27:36] believeth not
[1:27:38] my Works how can we work the works of
[1:27:41] God then disciples says believe on him
[1:27:42] who he has said it still stands true
[1:27:45] today
[1:27:45] believe who God sends
[1:27:48] because if you don't believe him don't
[1:27:50] try to tell me you didn't believe him
[1:27:51] back then everybody claims to believe
[1:27:52] him what he did on Calvary but when he
[1:27:54] comes right in front of him and does the
[1:27:55] very same thing then they call up the
[1:27:56] elzibar and of the devil you are of the
[1:27:58] devil claiming to be a Christian folks
[1:28:02] anyway that's free wasn't going to say
[1:28:04] that now but I just you know
[1:28:06] he got down on this generation on this
[1:28:08] bunch of Christians who call people that
[1:28:10] claim to be Christians and so forth and
[1:28:12] won't believe God when he does something
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:19] I'm not following a man I'm following
[1:28:21] God through the man
[1:28:24] all right here we go
[1:28:26] so once and more let's look at find some
[1:28:28] more
[1:28:30] praise be to God all right I like this
[1:28:33] stop right here I gotta stop here just a
[1:28:36] second before we said amen
[1:28:39] and the 420 Elders fell down and
[1:28:41] worshiped him that liveth forever and
[1:28:44] ever he fell down in worshiped forever
[1:28:46] and ever let me tell you something that
[1:28:48] God wants forever worship it's the devil
[1:28:51] was the devil was in heaven for billions
[1:28:54] of years maybe we don't know how long it
[1:28:56] was is that right but eventually it got
[1:29:00] old to him and he got jealous and had
[1:29:01] hatred and he had he had jealousy in him
[1:29:04] and he wanted to be a god like God was
[1:29:07] huh
[1:29:09] and even Jesus when he was here on the
[1:29:11] earth he says you know the word comes on
[1:29:13] some people oh and I'll tell you what
[1:29:15] the word makes him shout and they
[1:29:17] Rejoice for a season and the fine bye
[1:29:23] my goodness gracious brothers and
[1:29:25] sisters this pastor right here is so
[1:29:27] sick I see people coming and by going by
[1:29:29] the wayside
[1:29:32] God don't have much for quitters
[1:29:35] Paul said those that turn back my soul
[1:29:37] shall have no pleasure in him
[1:29:40] I would love people that stick with it
[1:29:43] God loves people that stick with it I'm
[1:29:46] here to worship God to serve God through
[1:29:48] eternity not just for a period of time
[1:29:50] or until the next trial comes up or the

[1:30:28] and after this I be held in law a great
[1:30:30] multitude which no man could number
[1:30:33] of all Nations

[1:32:12] more of that in US

[1:34:00] did corrupt the Earth with her
[1:34:02] fornication and had Avenged the blood of
[1:34:04] his servants at her hand and again they

[1:36:28] great multitude and as the voice of many
[1:36:32] Waters and that's the voice of a mighty
[1:36:36] thundering saying
[1:36:39] Hallelujah
[1:36:42] for the Lord Our God omnipotent that
[1:36:46] means all powerful the all-powerful god
[1:36:50] rage

[1:37:22] future because I'm here to tell you one
[1:37:24] of these days it's going to materialize
[1:37:26] I may believe one of these days the body
[1:37:28] of Christ and then we're gonna see him
[1:37:30] in Disguise it's gonna materialize and
[1:37:34] this body is going to materialize you to
[1:37:36] a glorified body it's gonna happen it's
[1:37:39] gonna happen it's gonna happen that's
[1:37:42] what we need to get a mind it's gonna
[1:37:44] happen
[1:37:47] it's coming it's coming it's coming
[1:37:52] people don't have a revelation of that
[1:37:54] that's why they're so thoughtful
[1:37:56] so sloppy
[1:37:57] they think it's just going to keep on
[1:37:59] going like it is it's not going to keep
[1:38:00] on going like it is it's coming during
[1:38:03] the Brooklyn
[1:38:04] this ship this America's ship is taking
[1:38:08] on major water it's about to go down
[1:38:13] it's going down
[1:38:16] there's only one hope
[1:38:18] if only hope
[1:38:20] you only have one chance one hope of
[1:38:22] ever making it out of this alive and
[1:38:25] that's in this man that is a lamb that's
[1:38:28] Jesus Christ
[1:38:30] there was one that was found worthy to
[1:38:32] take the book it was Muhammad or Buddha
[1:38:34] or any of those it was the lamb that was
[1:38:36] slain on Calvary
[1:38:39] Worthy
[1:38:42] the only one that could redeem this back
[1:38:44] to God remember this book that we just
[1:38:46] read about it it is the book of
[1:38:48] redemption

[1:39:08] causing numbness and this out and the
[1:39:10] other and I know it's just this devil
[1:39:12] the last night I went to bed kind of
[1:39:14] thinking maybe it's going to be a bad
[1:39:15] night and I said Lord Jesus

[1:39:59] I want to dedicate myself more how many
[1:40:01] beliefs this morning you need to
[1:40:02] dedicate yourself more to God
[1:40:10] amen I believe that's what God is
[1:40:12] helping me do
[1:40:13] dedicate yourself more
[1:40:15] amen sure we're claimed to be Christians
[1:40:18] and serving God but you know dedicated
[1:40:20] our time our thought our everything to
[1:40:21] him
[1:40:22] 24 7 it's all about God
[1:40:26] and
[1:40:28] I like this let's go on
[1:40:30] came out of the throne saying praise our
[1:40:33] God ye servants and he heard a great
[1:40:35] voice of money multitudes and many
[1:40:38] thunderings saying hallelujah the Lord
[1:40:40] Our God omnipotent reigneth
[1:40:45] let us be glad
[1:40:48] amen how many believes I came to give
[1:40:51] you Joy
[1:40:53] that more abundantly
[1:40:55] life and met more abundantly joy
[1:40:57] unspeakable let us be glad and rejoice
[1:41:02] and give honor unto him
[1:41:06] honor I guess is one of the first things
[1:41:08] I want to talk about this morning as we
[1:41:10] get started honor
[1:41:12] let's rejoice and give honor to him for
[1:41:15] the marriage of the Lamb has come and
[1:41:18] his wife has made herself ready
[1:41:22] amen praise the Lord
[1:41:26] that's what we got to do let's give
[1:41:28] honor
[1:41:29] to him
[1:41:32] we're going to start with that for just
[1:41:34] a minute
[1:41:35] honor
[1:41:38] honor
[1:41:41] I thought about that
[1:41:45] in God said over in Malachi
[1:41:49] 1 and verse six he says the son honereth
[1:41:52] his father and a servant his master
[1:41:56] if then I be a father where is my honor
[1:42:02] if I be a master where is my fear saith
[1:42:04] the Lord unto uh
[1:42:07] the Lord unto the hosts of hosts unto
[1:42:10] you
[1:42:12] how many believe that God is worthy of
[1:42:15] honor
[1:42:19] amen
[1:42:21] now
[1:42:23] there's something I want to cover at I
[1:42:26] want to go back
[1:42:27] and I want to cover a little bit before
[1:42:31] we're going into it too heavy
[1:42:35] we realize that without God
[1:42:38] you're nothing
[1:42:40] now some people think they are so I'm
[1:42:43] thinking sure we're here
[1:42:44] we live out our lives
[1:42:47] but eventually you'll actually come
[1:42:50] to nothing
[1:42:52] I mean
[1:42:53] you'll cease to exist you'll become
[1:42:56] extinct
[1:42:57] never be
[1:42:59] without God you
[1:43:01] are going to become extinct
[1:43:03] you're nothing
[1:43:04] without God
[1:43:07] and anything that you have has been
[1:43:10] given to you by God
[1:43:12] that's why he's worthy of it all
[1:43:15] amen
[1:43:17] this
[1:43:19] our flesh begins to fade you can begin
[1:43:22] to lose your strength
[1:43:24] huh you lose your glory
[1:43:27] that's right the glory of young man as
[1:43:29] his strengthened and so forth but all of
[1:43:31] that Fades away
[1:43:34] amen as we get older we begin to think
[1:43:37] about our deathbed we think about how
[1:43:40] that we're going to go
[1:43:41] amen
[1:43:43] brother Daryl Hampton brother Stephen
[1:43:45] called me last night he says you know
[1:43:46] that he had a uh four different
[1:43:48] bleedings into his brains a major uh
[1:43:52] stroke so forth they don't know whether
[1:43:53] he's even going to make it and so forth
[1:43:55] and he said he's only 64. I look at it
[1:43:57] and I'm 61. well I'm not that far off
[1:44:01] how many tells you every day is Grace
[1:44:04] for any of us I don't care what age you
[1:44:06] are
[1:44:07] but you got to realize something and
[1:44:08] that is that you in our flesh we are
[1:44:11] just like grass we're like a flower you
[1:44:13] know right that comes and it blooms and
[1:44:15] then it lasts for a while then it's gone
[1:44:17] but the Lord that's why we look to God
[1:44:20] that's why we look to him look unto me
[1:44:23] and be saved
[1:44:26] aren't you glad that there's one that
[1:44:28] you can look to in this world
[1:44:30] and to know that in the spite of all the
[1:44:33] perishing that's going on you don't have
[1:44:35] to perish
[1:44:37] amen because if we have that lamb that
[1:44:39] was worthy to take the book
[1:44:45] let's look at how God see things first
[1:44:48] of all
[1:44:49] we know that God is omnipotent he
[1:44:51] reigneth he truly reigneth and I want to
[1:44:54] talk I'll bring into some of that when
[1:44:55] we talk about his power because I want
[1:44:57] to talk about his glory his honor and
[1:44:59] power this morning
[1:45:01] I'd like to cover those three if I could
[1:45:03] but first I want to talk about
[1:45:05] how that without God
[1:45:08] you have no strength there's no glory
[1:45:10] there's no honor and God doesn't share
[1:45:13] his honor or his glory
[1:45:15] Bible talks about he won't share his
[1:45:17] glory with another
[1:45:19] right
[1:45:22] so let's talk about this flesh for
[1:45:24] syllabus
[1:45:26] because we know that
[1:45:29] this flesh
[1:45:31] some some people don't even realize that
[1:45:34] they're Triune beings
[1:45:37] how many knows that a lot of us whenever
[1:45:39] we first had the circle up here and we
[1:45:41] had brother Branham drawn out how they
[1:45:43] were a threefold purpose uh threefold
[1:45:46] being an audit the outside is the flesh
[1:45:48] see taste feel here and smell and so
[1:45:50] forth and then there's on the inside
[1:45:52] there's another part of you that's the
[1:45:54] spirit being
[1:45:56] so most people don't even think they
[1:45:58] don't think about that Spirit that's on
[1:46:00] the inside of them isn't that right and
[1:46:02] the things that they do allow those
[1:46:04] spirits to come and make them miserable
[1:46:08] and they're completely miserable because
[1:46:10] they don't even understand who they
[1:46:11] really are
[1:46:13] and then on the inside of the inside
[1:46:15] inside of that Spirit on the inside is
[1:46:18] the real
[1:46:19] you it's called your soul
[1:46:23] now unfortunately that's the one that
[1:46:26] people think about the least
[1:46:29] people think about their soul the least
[1:46:35] we put so much I wrote on a reinvest so
[1:46:40] much in this flesh
[1:46:43] huh
[1:46:44] I put a different tie on this morning
[1:46:46] and didn't have a pin for it and I said
[1:46:48] oh I'll try a different eye
[1:46:50] come Wednesday I said well honey this is
[1:46:52] a terrible matching isn't it she says no
[1:46:54] that's great you do wonderful after 30
[1:46:56] years of experience you ought to have a
[1:46:58] little bit of a taste and be putting
[1:46:59] things together but I still question
[1:47:00] myself it's got a match and so you know
[1:47:03] I tried to make sure I match
[1:47:05] right try to do this out of the other we
[1:47:08] put so much in our flesh because we want
[1:47:10] to look right we want to dress right we
[1:47:11] want to have our hair right
[1:47:16] is that right
[1:47:18] but what about making sure that when we
[1:47:20] come to the house of God your spirit is
[1:47:22] right your attitude is right you're kind
[1:47:25] you're sweet you're loving that spirit
[1:47:27] is just how it's we ought to invest more
[1:47:30] in making sure we got the right attitude
[1:47:32] that we've got the right spirit
[1:47:35] because that matters more than you
[1:47:37] flushed us how many knows you might be
[1:47:40] ugly as Sin and you may not have watched
[1:47:41] for a week but if your Soul's watch you
[1:47:44] can jump up without
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:45] me
[1:47:48] Joy comes from the inside not just
[1:47:51] outside that's why so many out there the
[1:47:54] whole world is absolutely failing to get
[1:47:56] the joy that they want because you're
[1:47:59] trying to do it with the fleshly
[1:48:01] appetites and it never will work
[1:48:04] it has to be in the spirit realm you got
[1:48:07] to care about that Spirit on the inside
[1:48:10] and not just the spirit but that Soul
[1:48:12] that's on the inside
[1:48:14] people don't think
[1:48:16] but
[1:48:17] they don't they don't never think about
[1:48:19] what they're going to spend eternity
[1:48:22] or that they're going to lose their life
[1:48:25] because how many know that's why Jesus
[1:48:26] came is that you might have life
[1:48:28] he came to that you could your life
[1:48:30] could be spared
[1:48:31] because we were all Damned
[1:48:33] the whole world is was Damned
[1:48:36] amen oh mankind was dimmed
[1:48:40] but God came to save all of mankind
[1:48:44] so it's important
[1:48:46] not so much the flesh
[1:48:50] flesh Prophet as little Paul said
[1:48:52] don't mean much
[1:48:56] amen
[1:48:59] time goes so swiftly
[1:49:02] I'm so fast
[1:49:07] but that spirit and in that soul
[1:49:10] I think the properly God said one place
[1:49:11] he said you know that well I'll tell you
[1:49:13] you go to a restaurant and you find a a
[1:49:15] bug a roach in your peep stuck on the
[1:49:18] cheese
[1:49:20] you're going to have a problem
[1:49:26] I need a big old I need a super Pizza
[1:49:29] okay give me a big old Super Pizza I'm
[1:49:31] gonna eat it and I don't want to be
[1:49:32] charged for none of it
[1:49:34] trying to feed me a bug
[1:49:36] that's how we are right
[1:49:38] I wouldn't have no doubt they would say
[1:49:40] we're so sorry let me get you another
[1:49:41] one and a fresh one if you won't walk
[1:49:44] out
[1:49:45] and if you don't you're going to be
[1:49:47] taking a knot and looking around right
[1:49:48] now right
[1:49:52] I'm gonna say something I'll tell you
[1:49:53] what if I'd ever get in a squabble or
[1:49:55] whatever with somebody about my food I
[1:49:57] wouldn't say go make me another one I
[1:49:59] would leave because it probably spitted
[1:50:01] or something because they don't like the
[1:50:02] way you just did them
[1:50:13] as a Christian isn't that right to make
[1:50:15] somebody seem so upset you spit in your
[1:50:17] food in the first place
[1:50:18] be nice about it you probably wouldn't
[1:50:20] have to worry about it isn't that right
[1:50:24] but
[1:50:25] what do you say but then sometimes
[1:50:27] you'll cram you'll let the devil get on
[1:50:29] your iPhone wherever whatever and cram
[1:50:31] mess in your your Facebook this Saturday
[1:50:34] or the other and you'll feed that Soul a
[1:50:35] bunch of junk
[1:50:37] then you come to church and wonder where
[1:50:38] the Holy Ghost is and why the preacher
[1:50:40] can't preach and why you don't feel the
[1:50:41] way that you ought to do hello it's
[1:50:44] because you got to watch what you're
[1:50:45] feeding your soul
[1:50:47] watch what you're feeding your spirit
[1:50:49] man that controls his spirit is mightier
[1:50:52] than the man that takes a city if you
[1:50:54] can control your spirit
[1:50:56] kind of spirit that you have you are
[1:50:59] mightier than uh Napoleon
[1:51:03] that could take a whole world
[1:51:06] almost he could not control his own
[1:51:08] Spirit died of alcoholic
[1:51:11] because he never could conquer himself
[1:51:12] huh
[1:51:14] amen Lord help us
[1:51:17] for God
[1:51:26] amen
[1:51:27] [Music]
[1:51:30] because I'll tell you this in Isaiah 40
[1:51:32] verse 6.
[1:51:37] it says the voice cried and the voice
[1:51:39] cried and said on well he said
[1:51:43] wait a minute and the voice said cry
[1:51:47] and he said what shall I cry cry that
[1:51:51] all flesh is grass
[1:51:55] grass
[1:51:59] don't you know that we're made out of
[1:52:01] the same material
[1:52:03] grass is made out of and the dirt was
[1:52:05] made out of 16 elements of the Earth
[1:52:08] why she's not not a bunch of grass
[1:52:11] bunch of dirt
[1:52:12] and they're all the goodliness thereof
[1:52:15] is as the flower of the field the grass
[1:52:18] withereth and the flower fadeth
[1:52:20] amen because the spirit of the Lord
[1:52:23] bloweth upon him but surely the people
[1:52:25] is grass
[1:52:30] your flesh don't mean much folks
[1:52:32] it doesn't mean a whole lot
[1:52:35] if you think it's so wonderful and so
[1:52:37] gorgeous and so beautiful go out there
[1:52:39] and dig one of these days up
[1:52:41] and look at that bunch of pile of bones
[1:52:44] and that rottenness
[1:52:46] it's not so much
[1:52:49] amen
[1:52:52] grass
[1:52:54] the grass withers the flower fadeth but
[1:52:57] the word of Our Lord shall stand forever
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:03] how many so glad that when Peters talk
[1:53:06] about being born again we're born again
[1:53:08] it says by the word of God
[1:53:11] he talks about that when she's a flashy
[1:53:14] slash but that which is of the spirit
[1:53:16] and spirit and you and I are not born of
[1:53:19] his flesh but if you're a child of God
[1:53:20] you have been born by God's word and
[1:53:23] God's word endures forever
[1:53:28] I mean he's glad for that
[1:53:30] to be born by the word of God not not
[1:53:33] just flesh anymore
[1:53:35] there's something down in here that's
[1:53:37] warned by the word of God
[1:53:39] laughs
[1:53:41] how am I think about it that by the
[1:53:44] foolishness of preaching to save those
[1:53:46] that believe that word into your heart
[1:53:49] it quickens that seeds on the inside you
[1:53:51] come to life
[1:53:52] and you have
[1:53:54] eternal life
[1:53:59] down in verse 12. who have measured the
[1:54:03] waters in the hollow of his hand
[1:54:06] and mean it out to heaven with the span
[1:54:10] and comprehended the dust of the Earth
[1:54:13] in a measure and the mountains and
[1:54:16] scales and the hills and the balance
[1:54:18] who hath directed The Spirit of the Lord
[1:54:20] will be in his counselor had taught him
[1:54:22] this comes with being the wisdom of God
[1:54:24] how many knows he is all wisdom
[1:54:27] this also comes with the power of
[1:54:29] almighty God
[1:54:31] all right
[1:54:33] with whom to key Council and who
[1:54:36] instructed him and taught him in the
[1:54:37] path of judgment and taught him
[1:54:39] knowledge and showed him the way of
[1:54:40] understanding behold
[1:54:43] the nations are as a drop of a bucket
[1:54:49] and are counted as a small dust of a
[1:54:53] balance
[1:54:55] all these nations
[1:54:57] mean absolutely very little
[1:55:00] to God
[1:55:04] they're nothing
[1:55:06] compared to him
[1:55:09] behold you take up the owls as a very
[1:55:11] little thing
[1:55:13] verse 17 in all nations before him are
[1:55:17] as nothing and they are counted to him
[1:55:20] less than nothing and vanity
[1:55:26] how many as we get to think in so much
[1:55:28] of ourself
[1:55:30] people think so much of their self
[1:55:32] the world thinks so much of their self
[1:55:36] when they're nothing notice how God says
[1:55:39] less than nothing
[1:55:41] that means minus zero minus
[1:55:49] because without God
[1:55:51] it had really been better for you to
[1:55:54] never have been born
[1:55:56] now what he said about Judas and so
[1:55:58] forth
[1:55:59] it'd have been better for him not have
[1:56:01] been born
[1:56:03] less than nothing
[1:56:06] because God is every I'm trying to say
[1:56:08] God is everything people he's everything
[1:56:12] he has to mean everything to you beat
[1:56:17] you this morning
[1:56:18] he has to be everything to you
[1:56:23] he is my everything he is my all
[1:56:27] he is my everything both great and small
[1:56:30] we sing that song and that's what he
[1:56:32] needs to be every day of your life
[1:56:36] isn't it something how we invest
[1:56:39] so much time in this flesh not enough in
[1:56:42] the soul not enough in the spirit
[1:56:47] God help us right
[1:56:49] Lord help us to invest more time to
[1:56:51] making sure our soul is right and our
[1:56:53] spirit is right
[1:56:55] amen
[1:56:56] and I hope that time is right
[1:57:01] all right amen
[1:57:08] all right
[1:57:10] I want to
[1:57:16] did we start with honor
[1:57:18] honor yes
[1:57:20] I believe it's so important that we
[1:57:22] honor God
[1:57:25] and having studied this and prayed about
[1:57:28] this and getting closer to the Lord I
[1:57:29] realized Lord help me to honor you
[1:57:32] in the way that I live
[1:57:34] the things I do the clothes I wear
[1:57:37] everything that I do Lord let it bring
[1:57:39] honor and glory to your name
[1:57:42] how many knows you're sitting in church
[1:57:43] this morning because you want to honor
[1:57:45] God
[1:57:47] we want to honor we want to reverence
[1:57:49] him
[1:57:50] honor he is worthy of respect he's
[1:57:54] worthy of honor
[1:57:57] all of our leaders and so forth they
[1:57:58] think that they are that you've got the
[1:58:00] honor and you got to re respect them but
[1:58:02] what about God
[1:58:04] where she's on her he is deserving of
[1:58:07] all honor
[1:58:10] foreign
[1:58:17] David always honored God did he
[1:58:20] David honored and glorified God I want
[1:58:24] to talk to you about some of them that
[1:58:25] honored God and some of them didn't
[1:58:27] David was one that honored God

[1:58:39] God that delivered that bear into my
[1:58:41] hand the god that delivered them but uh
[1:58:43] lying into my hands he will deliver you
[1:58:47] God will do it

[1:58:51] ever gonna achieve anything do anything
[1:58:53] it's going to be God that does it
[1:58:58] he's worthy of honor and Glory
[1:59:01] Nebuchadnezzar was one that didn't honor
[1:59:04] God and that he thought that what he did

[1:59:22] okay we're gonna read a little bit is
[1:59:23] that okay
[1:59:25] in Daniel the fourth chapter Daniel 4.
[1:59:29] we want to read about King
[1:59:32] Nebuchadnezzar that did not give honor
[1:59:34] to God the way that he should have
[1:59:40] one place Brother Band makes a statement
[1:59:43] he says if you don't bring honor and
[1:59:44] glory to God you're going to find
[1:59:46] yourself a cold backslitting person
[1:59:48] someday I mean because we got to honor
[1:59:50] and glorify God
[1:59:52] amen
[1:59:54] in Daniel
[1:59:56] 4 and verse 28. all this Came Upon King
[2:00:00] Nebuchadnezzar at the end of 12 months
[2:00:03] he walked in the Palace of the kingdom
[2:00:06] of Allah Babylon
[2:00:08] the King's bacon said is not discrete
[2:00:11] Babylon that I have built for the house
[2:00:14] of
[2:00:14] the King by the might of my power
[2:00:20] and for the honor of my Majesty boy he
[2:00:24] was really stuck up wasn't he he really
[2:00:27] thought he had done something
[2:00:29] and if you'll remember what we just got
[2:00:32] through was that Nebuchadnezzar had a
[2:00:35] dream oh my man I didn't have time to do
[2:00:38] it but yesterday taking a nap I I played
[2:00:41] Daniel and and and before I fell asleep
[2:00:44] I read where he talks about how to you

[2:00:48] all of these uh wise men and uh
[2:00:51] magicians and all of you go I'm gonna

[2:01:12] give me a bunch of Lies if I tell you
[2:01:13] the dream you're gonna lie to me about
[2:01:15] what the interpretation is basically is
[2:01:16] what he said
[2:01:17] and they were about to go out there and
[2:01:19] kill him and the leader of them the
[2:01:21] leader of the ones that were supposed to
[2:01:22] kill him Daniel came up to him after
[2:01:24] praying about it and God showing him the
[2:01:26] dream he says now hold off a minute I
[2:01:27] got something for you
[2:01:29] and Daniel come before the king he says
[2:01:31] I want you to know that there's a God in
[2:01:33] heaven that reveals secrets
[2:01:40] the same thing people come and say
[2:01:42] brother banham I want you to tell about
[2:01:44] the interpretation of my dream and he

[2:08:32] took to hang the stars out there and the
[2:08:34] moon and Jupiter and Mars and Venus and
[2:08:37] all these galaxies of stars
[2:08:41] they don't go praise
[2:08:43] people will scream and hollering jumping
[2:08:45] carry on with football games and all of
[2:08:47] this that or the other what they can do
[2:08:49] and give honor to them but the god that

[2:09:08] worship this and worship baton oh my
[2:09:11] it's all great it's all nothing to God
[2:09:12] and to a Christian if you'll turn your
[2:09:15] eyes on Jesus look full in this
[2:09:17] wonderful face you'll realize that the
[2:09:19] things of this earth grow strangely dim
[2:09:21] in the light of his glory and his grace
[2:09:26] he thinks his fade away
[2:09:30] amen how many beliefs Paul said I don't
[2:09:32] come to you with enticing words of man
[2:09:34] wisdom that your faith wouldn't rest in
[2:09:36] the wisdom of man but it would thrust
[2:09:38] into power
[2:09:41] oh a power that could forgive you of
[2:09:44] your sin of power that could direct
[2:09:46] Lazarus from the dead that's some power
[2:09:52] a power that could change somebody like
[2:09:55] Tommy over there
[2:09:56] huh
[2:09:58] that man for nothing good to have that
[2:10:00] man he wouldn't listen for nothing
[2:10:03] God got his attention
[2:10:05] take the power of almighty God to change
[2:10:07] your man
[2:10:10] to change his nature changes desires
[2:10:14] oh I feel that power working already
[2:10:18] you are more of the power of God than
[2:10:20] yours more the power of God for you to
[2:10:22] have
[2:10:24] not for you to notice I'm in the seasons
[2:10:26] and so forth but you shall receive power
[2:10:29] after the Holy Ghost come upon you don't
[2:10:32] be like those amen that have a form of
[2:10:34] godliness but to deny the power thereof
[2:10:41] even Jesus said about the Pharisees
[2:10:43] you by your Traditions have to make the
[2:10:45] word of God and on effect it's powerless
[2:10:47] because of your traditions and the stuff
[2:10:48] that you mix in
[2:10:51] amen
[2:10:52] Lord help us
[2:10:56] power yeah that's real power
[2:11:01] real power I should love those that hate
[2:11:02] you real powers that pray for those that
[2:11:05] despitefully use you
[2:11:06] real powers to be able to turn your
[2:11:08] other cheek
[2:11:11] huh real power
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:16] real power isn't to be able to run all
[2:11:19] over the building and scream and shout
[2:11:20] and all this out of the other but real
[2:11:21] power and real strength comes from you
[2:11:24] being able to surrender yourself to God
[2:11:32] show me a man that is surrendered to God
[2:11:34] and I'll show you the power of God
[2:11:36] all right
[2:11:40] my oh my we're just basking in it this
[2:11:43] morning don't you enjoy it
[2:11:45] for asking in the power of God the word
[2:11:47] that's coming forth is power if you'll
[2:11:49] receive it
[2:11:51] folks it's enough power right here to
[2:11:53] change you to give you victory over sin
[2:11:55] to give you joy unspeakable and full of
[2:11:57] Glory if you just get yourself out of
[2:12:00] the way and say that's what I want
[2:12:01] brother boiler
[2:12:02] [Music]
[2:12:08] God hates a powerless religion
[2:12:16] why because God is full of power
[2:12:19] think of what it took to make all that
[2:12:22] and then I thought about faith brother
[2:12:24] toy of faith
[2:12:28] how that God just wants you to believe
[2:12:30] how that we can believe and receive and
[2:12:33] put ourselves completely in the trust of
[2:12:35] almighty God made all these things your
[2:12:37] little problems ain't nothing
[2:12:39] Goliath was absolutely nothing
[2:12:44] no wonder this just comes fresh no
[2:12:47] wonder he said that nations are nothing
[2:12:49] but a drop of a bucket they don't mean
[2:12:50] nothing they're less than nothing he can
[2:12:52] take one man Moses and they stop I oh
[2:12:55] Nation
[2:13:00] just take one man in his hand and I'll
[2:13:02] destroy the biggest army there ever was
[2:13:04] don't mean nothing to God
[2:13:06] less than nothing
[2:13:11] and that's the god that you and I served
[2:13:13] this morning
[2:13:14] that's why we're all so quiet about it
[2:13:19] yeah I guess God could
[2:13:24] maybe he will
[2:13:28] I'll be like Shadrach Meshach and the
[2:13:30] Bendigo I don't know if you will but I
[2:13:32] know that he can't one thing we know
[2:13:34] we're not bound down
[2:13:36] oh he got mad isn't that right he got
[2:13:39] mad and he fired that thing up oh I want
[2:13:42] to say something God help people that
[2:13:45] tried to manipulate things and change
[2:13:47] things by their own carnal ways
[2:13:50] you'll never get free you'll never win
[2:13:52] against God
[2:13:54] with your carnal ways
[2:13:56] and what you think you can do
[2:13:58] it'll never work
[2:14:00] you'll be defeated every single time
[2:14:05] but trust in the power of God
[2:14:07] put yourself in his hands and watch him
[2:14:09] come on the scene God loves to do it
[2:14:14] oh my can you imagine how God could have
[2:14:17] showed his power if he wanted to
[2:14:19] but he's
[2:14:21] killed his grace and his mercy and he
[2:14:24] showed that he was real to our
[2:14:25] generation he showed that he is real to
[2:14:28] see if people will do it
[2:14:29] we don't see him in all of his glory now
[2:14:32] how many knows where he's beat down he's
[2:14:34] the all-scouring of the Earth the other
[2:14:36] but when he comes in oh when Jesus comes
[2:14:38] in his glory
[2:14:40] it is Glory
[2:14:42] oh flesh it says I will see his glory
[2:14:46] praise the Lord
[2:14:48] talk about power and Nebuchadnezzar here
[2:14:51] taking it for himself folks

[2:15:03] fourth chapter
[2:15:08] seven times well I'll pass over thee and
[2:15:11] thou that thou mayest know that the most

[2:15:45] two or a month or two
[2:15:48] no he doesn't want you to have a Revival

[2:19:19] you talk about
[2:19:20] power
[2:19:23] now in glory
[2:19:28] and giveth it to whomsoever he will and
[2:19:33] that's something how the Holy Spirit
[2:19:34] just pulled that in
[2:19:35] taking that River even though he thought
[2:19:37] he was so secure underneath it came
[2:19:40] can I say something else that just comes
[2:19:42] to mind
[2:19:44] didn't brother Brown says don't worry
[2:19:45] about the the the the Woodpecker the
[2:19:48] bird that's pecking on the outside worry
[2:19:50] about the worm that's on the inside of
[2:19:52] the Apple
[2:19:53] don't worry about the Communists out
[2:19:55] there we're almost taken over by the
[2:19:58] commies now
[2:20:00] that's right I don't care who out there
[2:20:02] here the commies Communists have almost
[2:20:04] taken us over
[2:20:06] that's right
[2:20:10] you should hear those reporters saying
[2:20:12] we are a police state now
[2:20:14] we are a police state
[2:20:16] the only question is to the extent that
[2:20:19] we are
[2:20:20] when we can arrest somebody that we
[2:20:22] don't want to run for president we can
[2:20:24] do that
[2:20:25] we don't want him to run
[2:20:26] and what he's done what they're charging
[2:20:28] him of is nothing compared to what
[2:20:29] they've done not even a little smidgen
[2:20:31] close to him
[2:20:34] let me tell you something that's some
[2:20:35] pure evil that's right Pure Evil
[2:20:38] I don't care who hears it that's the
[2:20:40] truth
[2:20:41] huh that's where we're at folks
[2:20:44] won't be long come after you come after
[2:20:47] me come after your land come after your
[2:20:49] mommy land our money your money whatever
[2:20:51] it is
[2:20:53] and it's all perfectly according to the
[2:20:55] scriptures
[2:20:57] perfectly fulfilling the scriptures
[2:21:00] supposed to come
[2:21:02] but guess what there's a bride that's
[2:21:03] getting ready to get out of here that's
[2:21:05] the question are you ready this morning
[2:21:07] are you ready to get out of here
[2:21:09] amen I want to be ready
[2:21:14] oh my because it just comes to mind
[2:21:16] remember he said when that squeeze comes
[2:21:18] it's already too late
[2:21:20] it'll be too late then
[2:21:22] remember brother bam saying that
[2:21:25] when that comes and there'll be a time
[2:21:27] when people won't be able to be saved
[2:21:30] I went in this morning if you're not in
[2:21:32] this morning
[2:21:33] kidding this morning
[2:21:36] finished epic members nether here and
[2:21:39] the same hour was the thing fulfilled
[2:21:40] upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven
[2:21:42] from men and did he grass and as oxen
[2:21:45] and his body was wet but the Dew of
[2:21:47] Heaven till his hairs were grown like
[2:21:49] eagles feathers
[2:21:51] that's pretty long
[2:21:54] ah
[2:21:57] like a woman sure enough
[2:22:00] and his nails like birds claws
[2:22:04] I don't know about you but you see my
[2:22:06] nails
[2:22:07] probably not
[2:22:09] because I have a real good nail clipper
[2:22:12] I don't know why he didn't think about
[2:22:13] it just go ahead and chew him off like I
[2:22:15] do
[2:22:17] but he grew long nails
[2:22:22] I don't know if we'll ever get to see
[2:22:23] him Brother Brad or not a picture of
[2:22:24] Nebuchadnezzar when he was out in the
[2:22:26] field
[2:22:27] let's see what he looked like long hair
[2:22:29] beard
[2:22:31] looked like Moses Maybe
[2:22:33] only worse because I'm sure Moses cut
[2:22:35] his hair
[2:22:37] and at the end of days
[2:22:39] the days Nebuchadnezzar lifted up his
[2:22:42] eyes unto heaven
[2:22:44] mine and mine understanding returned
[2:22:47] unto me
[2:22:48] and I and I blessed the most high and I
[2:22:53] praised and honored him
[2:22:58] do you realize over in Revelation it
[2:23:00] talks about when those plagues come and
[2:23:02] says and they would they repented not to
[2:23:06] give him glory
[2:23:08] all of our Revelations so people will
[2:23:11] not give him going they'll not get him
[2:23:13] out
[2:23:14] anymore but there's a group of people
[2:23:15] here that does I mean honoring and
[2:23:18] bringing glory to almighty God
[2:23:21] but now he praised him he honored him
[2:23:24] that liveth forever
[2:23:28] whose Dominion is an everlasting
[2:23:30] dominion and his kingdom is from
[2:23:33] generation to generations and all the
[2:23:35] inhabitants are of the Earth are reputed
[2:23:39] as nothing
[2:23:42] and he doeth according to his will in
[2:23:46] the army of Heaven
[2:23:48] uh aren't you glad there's Army in
[2:23:50] heaven
[2:23:54] remember Elijah showed his servants he
[2:23:57] says open his eyes
[2:23:59] he says that he might see that the
[2:24:01] syrians that are down there by the
[2:24:03] droves there's more of us than there is
[2:24:05] of them and he opened his eyes and the
[2:24:06] whole hillsides and everything was
[2:24:09] filled with chariots and I'm not sure if
[2:24:12] it wasn't the fire fire horses of fire
[2:24:14] and chariots they were all
[2:24:16] them serious didn't have a chance
[2:24:21] can I just say something
[2:24:24] can you imagine what it was like in the
[2:24:26] spiritual realm when all of the
[2:24:29] Philistines and
[2:24:31] remember when they would kill each other
[2:24:32] and all these things that they do can
[2:24:34] you imagine the Army those armies of
[2:24:36] Charities to come down there and wipe
[2:24:37] them all out in the spiritual Realm
[2:24:43] the armies of Heaven
[2:24:49] praise be to God you've got him on your
[2:24:50] side this morning
[2:24:52] I may believe that you've got them on
[2:24:54] your side
[2:24:56] and among the inhabitants of the earth
[2:24:58] and none can stay his hand
[2:25:01] or say unto him what do is thou at the
