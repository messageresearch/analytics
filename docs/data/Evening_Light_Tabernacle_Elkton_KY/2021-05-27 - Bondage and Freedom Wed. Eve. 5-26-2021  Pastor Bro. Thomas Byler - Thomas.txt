really like them but i've always loved music and and uh when the lord saved me and i never i never was like brother you see dc i thought those people look weird and i don't wanna i don't wanna hear their garbage so i listened to mild rock and i thought i could never do without it i went to bed with it and woke up with it and the lord delivered me it was all over with and then i began to love the music and the sing because my dad always sang and just just to sing something that has heart in it and you know if you're if you're not feeling good just start singing when you're by yourself lower down speak to your heart the prophet even said that god healed through singing that's what he said take it up with him but i just believe that the more we do to be in his presence the better off i

just solid and just just appreciate each and every one of you we just don't want to rule anybody out tonight and you know i think sometimes our church family we're closer to them than we are our natural family because sometimes our natural family they they don't think much of what we believe but i'm so glad that we're going home on these days to be all together and amen it's just going to be a great time and you say well i've heard that my whole life i have to but i believe we're closer now than ever before and we're just looking forward to that day and let's sing that little course turn

brother brad for taking service sunday amen got to listen to that today was very good amen so just good to see everybody good to be back and we had a good time with our family up there amen we didn't quite get a fellowship with another family that i was trying to make connections with but maybe next time but anyway we did have a good time and amen just continue to pray for my family up there they certainly need a touch from the lord they need jesus amen amen and so amen hope you're having a wonderful week amen it certainly is late in late spring now and some of those when you get out there in the sun it's you know it's a lot harder it's just a lot hotter and so we're getting ready for the amen for the summer so praise the lord amen if you will open your bibles we'll just get into the word for a little while tonight just a simple little thought that i feel like amen we certainly have spoken before but amen i don't know why the lord has me going in this direction but amen i'm sure that he has it for a purpose and i pray that it'll be a blessing to you amen um so did you mention that brother david about timmy parish or no you did okay i just i was probably busy studying and i didn't know for sure and they had asked me to make sure to mention that so we want to make sure to remember him in prayer tomorrow in a special way too amen let's turn our bibles to saint john saint john 8. and then also hebrews i'm going to hebrews the 12th chapter but let's read saint john 8 first and we'll begin with verse 30. and as he spake these words many believed on him then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then ye are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayeth thou ye shall be made free jesus answers them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed over in hebrews the 12th chapter verse 1. we're foreseeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god may god had his blessings to reading in the words you can be seated i want to talk tonight for a little while about freedom and bondage bondage and freedom amen amen so that's what we want to speak on with the help of the lord if you notice here jesus talking about he was telling them that whoever the son makes free is free indeed amen and when we think about that we go back to all the way back into genesis of course but let me uh also talk just for a few minutes on the weight talks about let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beside us amen and what really began to come to me when i began to think about this subject was the weight of sin amen the weight of sin and i wanted to focus on that for just a little bit because somebody knows that sin is a is a great real big heavy weight amen and of course we know what weight does weight puts you under stress amen it puts up puts you under a burden it stresses you out amen so that's what weight does it stresses you out it gets you put you under pressure right that's what weight is naturally speaking naturally speaking in our flesh amen and i got to thinking about this how that uh you know one of the biggest battles i guess the person will face amen one of the biggest battles in the natural that you and i are going to face is the battle of the bulge isn't that right that's right getting fat it's a real battle amen i've been battling it for years now guess what i'm still fat you know so it's quite a battle it's it's weight just wants to come on it's so easy it's easy to take weight off but i'll tell you what if you aren't watchful very careful amend them to mocus it's just too easy to order and the weight just seems to come back how many knows it's uh how many have a problem with losing weight and then it comes back you ain't got to raise your hand i'm just but yeah you can say amen too if you want to but that's the truth isn't it and so we think about that and that wait how many knows it it is it's me i don't know about you but when i get it get to a certain point amen brother ryan laughing too because we know it's hard to tie that shoe it's hard to put that shoe on isn't it yeah it's just it's just and i'll tell you what you know uh you know when i i'll tell you what you know and and and as you get older you get too much weight and you're in your mind so so i'll tell you what i know and i know when i'm too heavy brother jeff when i'm too heavy i'll go down my stairs like this you know but i get especially after playing volleyball or something like that i really walk like that you know but anyway you think about it in the natural weight is not good for you how many knows the doctor says weight is not good for you amen it is so many things that goes against you as you gain weight amen i told my wife i said you know people that are obese you know i've come to the conclusion that they probably just gave up isn't that about the truth because it's a real battle it's a it's a hard fight and eventually you just said i just can't do it you know and if you ever come to that place it's just going to get a lot worse amen you must keep up the fight you must keep pressing amen to not over get overweight it's a constant battle and it's the same way spiritually and that right the bible says let's lay aside every weight amen because every little sin every little something that causes you to weigh you down amen that's what weight is spiritual weight is something that weighs you down it makes you heavy it makes you harder to walk it makes you immobile spiritually amen you can't go forward anymore hardly anymore and you can't do the things you used to do amen and it piles on how many knows it's just like calories the more you do the worse it gets the heavier you get now we know the prophet of god said that people god put a thirst in people and people try to quench that thirst isn't that right and they try to find a little joy they try to find a way to release get out from under the pressure of the weight and they'll drink they'll go out and get drunk and they're right they forget about all their troubles until the next morning is twice as bad what is it it's a multiplication of weight the sin just gets worse and worse and worse the weight gets worse and worse and worse until the brain says you know that there's so many that'll blow their brains out because they just can't stand it anymore that's where it goes to amen and we know that the first stress the first weight the first sin that eve brought amen was all the way in the garden of eden and amen adam and eve you know they were in a place where they were truly free isn't that right they were truly free and then they walked with the lion they put their arms around the lion and oh my what a beautiful place it was but after the weight of sin came in and that right after sin came in it brought such a weight until they brought in fear sin is a amen excuse me wait the weight of sin brings fear one of the first thing that sin does it brings scare people get scared people begin to worry and then they begin to amen get boggled up and get scared now once adam walked with the lion and now amen we find him hiding behind the bushes huh he got a little weight on him and he had sinned and now he goes from being free to having weighed on him amen and being scared of the lord and his voice and not only that but it brought inferior he meant he felt like he was inferior he wasn't worthy of being in the lord's presence it brought condemnation it brought all kinds of things that's what sin does it brings all kinds of weight on people amen and just because that we are free at one time how much and how often it happens folks amen if you are free amen the devil will do anything in his power to put weight on you to weigh you down amen now i got to thinking about this and life is weight how many knows life itself is weight first of all we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies amen we were born with a weight on us life is weight doesn't matter what portion you think about it it's all weight it's all stress it's a burden it's responsibility amen and the older we get the more responsibility we have isn't that right i mean even as a child you think about it even as a child they were they're free they're happy but let them do something wrong and when obama comes with the stick when they're fixing to get paddled them kids get under stress oh no this is terrible their whole world turns upside down isn't that right it's not a beautiful place anymore they're stressed because they did wrong and they're going to get punished for it amen because what that's what sin does that's what wronged us and they were born to that isn't that right and so just from one thing to another the responsibilities of life i mean those that's a weight it meant having to get up every morning we have a responsibility every morning we got to get up we got to go to work some people think they can just be a couch potato stay home and maybe let the government take care of them i don't know but it don't work that way for me doesn't you no it's hard and then people don't like an alarm clock you know i hated that thing too but guess what it's going to go beep beep beep beep beep i gotta go another day i gotta go to work huh you don't think about it but it's a responsibility it's a weight it's a pressure the whole world is under a pressure now what the prophet of god said even preached on how did it disperse the people's under it amen and they don't know how to get out from under it it weighs them down and it also enslaves them i mean this way enslaves people and causes them not to be free anymore now there's nothing like being free and truly we won't be completely free and that right how does that song go amen about these bars of bones and so forth amen when my spirit will be set free isn't that right amen when this life is over all the weight of it all the burden of it amen you'll always be under responsibility you'll always be under uh stress there'll always be pressure as long as you're in this world but we'll truly be free when we leave this world amen that's where that true freedom is amen as far as the natural but now we're talking about a spiritual stem in our hearts and in our souls and in our minds hello we can be free now free freedom or bondage you're either living in one or the other tonight you're either free or you're bound amen and jesus was trying to tell them that hey you know if you're my disciples if you believe my word amen you will know the truth and the truth is going to set you free now we know that in the old testament whenever they sounded that trumpet and so forth and went out saying everybody can go free isn't that right they knew that that sound of that trumpet it was said you can be free and that's what jesus came to say is that you can be free amen it was the rising of the sun same with the uh the slaves and so forth we know that abraham lincoln and so forth died they mean afraid of slaves free fled for when you get old it all goes backwards free to slaves amen to freedom slaves and he says when that sun rises every freak every slave can go free it's a freedom amen it's a type of jesus christ i mean when he rose he make a declaration all right you can go free now you always in bondage to the devil amen even jesus says you know if you're a servant of sin you are a slave to him amen anybody that commits sin is a servant of the sin or you are a slave to it and he came to set us free from that amen and i'm glad for that he came to set us free and he made a proclamation that if he sets you free you are going to be free indeed let me tell you i could mention different ones in the church here you know like brother david was talking about how that you know how that he he got an anchor way back in his life there's an anchor that happened amen we can look at each other's lives and we can tell whether we got that anchor or whether we don't have that anchor that right because that anchor holds how many believes that anchor holds you if that egg isn't there oh it is never going to work amen we need that anchor and it doesn't matter what comes or what goes or how much of a burden what it is we've learned how to let off the pressure amen praise the lord so you think about how that uh you know we were not free our minds were under condemnation amen when you're condemned and uh you're guilty of something how many knows there's no freedom there i'll tell you what just since i've i've listened back to 1959 los angeles and listened to brother branham's life story and how did he talk about how that you know how he lost his wife and the promise that he made that he would meet her on the in heaven and so forth and how that she had come back and and she didn't want to leave she had an eight-month-old baby and about a two-year-old boy i guess billy paul was somewhere in there how did she want to leave him but she says you know they're calling me home i'm going home and it's such a beautiful place of perfect peace he says ever since time he says one thing that he made a statement in that message was you know set your sight set your affections on things above not on the things of this world amen amen so we realize brothers and sisters that even as in this life there's responsibility you have to uh you have to make many choices in life it's a big responsibility it's a weight there's just there's just weight that we have to deal with pressure that everybody has to deal with teenagers have to deal with it and people are absolutely cracking under that pressure under the weight of sin people are going crazy the whole world is going crazy amen but you know how many knows that we were not made to be in bondage amen i'm glad tonight for it over in matthew over in matthew 11 and verse 28 jesus makes a statement now notice this how many knows that jesus had the weight of the whole world on his shoulders in other words if he doesn't go through with this it will cost every soul every soul was on his shoulder the weight of the whole world was on the shoulders of jesus christ you talk about a heavy weight but yet he could say to you and to me he says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden now the pharisees says we ain't never been fried in bondage to nobody they were in bondage and didn't know it isn't that right because everybody that is born of sin shaped iniquity everybody was under bondage everybody was heavy laden amen how many know that if you're not in christ you have a real good reason to have a frown amen your smile is turned upside down isn't that right that's what weight will do i mean that was too much responsibility even we as human beings we were only man to take so much pressure so much weight amen but think about it he says he who had the whole weight of the whole world on him says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest praise be to god there isn't the church in the world that can bring you to this there ain't a prophet no priest nobody that can bring you to this only can you find this in christ only in the baptism of the holy ghost will you find this place of rest and this place that you can lay down your heavy weight amen take my yoke upon you and learn of me for our meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rests unto your souls now how many knows a person that's fat they're going to get tired twice as quick as a person that isn't huh they're going to get weary twice as quick amen and they're going to have to sit down a whole lot more they're going to have to rest a lot anybody that has a lot of labor he says if you're laboring and heavy laden he said come to me and i will give you rest i don't know 20 30 40 50 60 about 40 years that i've been in in the lord by god's grace and i'll tell you i am never i always marvel i am just amazed at how a person that's in christ how they can rest you don't have to worry how that you can have peace in the midst of the storm and when this world is just falling apart like it is you can have rest that's what jesus said he come and give you rest give you peace he said i give you peace not as the world gives give unto you amen but jesus is peace that passes understanding amen but now notice here also verse 30 he says for my yoke huh how many knows a yoke is a burden something they put on their back a yoke that you got to carry a burden that you got to carry my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen that's right and my burden is light so when you come to christ his yoke is easy and his burden is light you can feel like there is a ton of weight on you or you can feel light as a feather the holy ghost makes you feel like it could just almost float away amen why because it's not necessarily because this body but it's because of what's going on in your spirit hello all the weight's gone amen how many knows that weight can only be dropped you can only drop this weight it ain't by no diet phil huh the only way you'll drop that weight is to bring it to jesus huh it's not by a workout but it's by getting on your knees that's where you get rid of the weight praise be to god i'm so thankful for that amen i want to talk more about fear ma'am i may not but you know i pray that we would be so so free that we could be free from fear even if we come down to the door of death that you don't even have to fear death wouldn't that truly be wouldn't that truly be a place of freedom to get to the place of death that you would not fear it wouldn't be scared of it at all that's where god wants us he wants us at that place to where not only in death but anything anything in life you don't have to be afraid of it i mean those when you come back to christ the scare is gone well they're going to shoot you so what they're going to take me right into the presence of god this may happen and that and it's all okay when you're in christ amen all right let me uh there's a couple quotes i want to read to you and one illustration that i want to i want i want to i want to use this evening and it is this illustration of brother branham's visit to the zoo in cincinnati where he seen the eagle is that all right i remember one time at the cincinnati zoo cincinnati ohio i was looking at an eagle had just been captured and it was one of the most pitiful sights that i'd ever had the privilege of seeing this great heavenly bird had been captured and netted by someone and thrown into a cage nahami knows that's exactly what the devil did the serpent did the devil did through the serpent and then he absolutely netted the whole human race and threw him into a cage and that poor fella was so out of place that he would jump with all that was within him against the big bars flopping his wing only to find himself to fall back on his back amen how many knows outside of the baptism of the holy ghost giving you victory over sin you may try to overcome you may try and try and try but you'll find yourself right on your back amen defeated man tried and tried and tried but he couldn't david couldn't solomon couldn't solomon the wisest man of all and all the boy he was so wise but didn't in the end his wives mislead him and he worshipped the mother god he tried but outside why do you think we needed the baptism in the holy ghost amen because in themselves they couldn't david couldn't none of them could tried to do right tried to show forth even them great man david and so forth just couldn't do it neither can you or i outside of the holy ghost and that poor eagle had beat himself to those bars until all the feathers were speed from his wings and his head and his face was all bloody and bruised amen and as i watched him again proudly walked back and with all that he heard he poured himself against those bars only to find himself knocked backwards again and as he laid there on that floor and his weary eyes soared the skies i thought what a pitiful sight what a pitiful sight there he was laying on his back all beating bruised and he looked up there where he used to soar up above the clouds now he's looking up at the clouds he used to look down at the clouds and here he is in the cage what a pitiful sight almost enough to make anybody cry but iran says if i'd had a million dollars i'd have given and i believe it if i believe probably god had a million dollars he'd give him that let this eagle go you know how many knows brother brandon wasn't much on canaries and all of these caged animals and cage birds i don't like it either amen no why they were made to be free amen but this eagle was in such a terrible way he was looking now notice no so he says what a pitiful sight made not to be on the earth here he's a heavenly bird his whole makeup was to live in the blue way above the haunts and cares of this world amen but to see a bird like that borned up there born in the earth the sword of skies and he had caged in such a way that he could never again soar the skies that reminded me of samson how many knows he knew what it was like to be victorious to be undefeatable am i right nobody could stop him he would he would go and light their fields on fire he'd pick a fight samson pick fights he could be proud he had he could not be defeated until he gave his secret away and there he was isn't that right his eyes plucked out going around in circles going around and a slave to the enemy what a horrible sight i have to push around that grinding meal and just go round and round he was a slave to the enemy that's the way you and i were we were slave to sin we were slave to our lusts we were slave to all of these other things we were slave to it how many knows we're going to you're going to be a slave one way or the other we're going to be a slave it's either going to be the devil but it's going to be god remember jesus said no man can co can serve two masters let me tell you how many knows if there would have been more than two he'd said four there's only two either serve one or you serve the other you're either a servant of one or you're the servant of the other you're a slave to one or a slave to the other you're either bound hello you're either in chains you're either a slave to the devil tonight and you're not free or you're free and you're serving christ amen one or the other praise the lord i am so glad amen so and listen all right but to see a bird like that made up there noticed yet caged in such a way he could never sword the skies again and as he laid there looking at that place where he had been and had been made to soar but by the cunningness of man he had been caged for life that's sad isn't it caged for life i don't know about you but that's a hopeless situation if he was to be like in prison for life no chance of parole huh no chance of parole what if you was about a quarter of the way through your sentence and they found out that hey it wasn't really you you know you're going to be set free wouldn't you be happy well that's what we find out guess what you can be free it was the devil's fault he's the one that done it you ain't got to be the slave to the devil you can go free you can be happy amen oh my what a pitiful sight how many knows that's what hell hell that's what hell's gonna be hell's gonna be you're getting a place where you know you could call for god and he ain't there you you know you think about all the chances that you could have had and that you had but you don't have any chances over there it is for life amen it's a horrible place just to know that but by the cunningness of man he had been caged for life what a pitiful sight but brethren he says that's not a bad sight at all to walk out here in the streets of chicago and we don't have to go to chicago we can go to walmart over there at russellville or you can go around and you can see how that people are absolutely encages enslaved to the devil weighed down with sin amen wait heavy laden to find men who were born and shaped in the image of god to be sons and daughters of god to find them caged by sin and habits and the cares of this world it's far more pitiful shape than that eagle was how many knows man was not made to be bound he was made to be free amen how many knows that's truly what all of man was made for and the reason they do all the crazy stuff that they do is they're trying to get out that's exactly what the prophet god said listen he said they drink they cry they do all these things listen he wasn't made to be a slave he was made to be a son of god he was made in the image of god he was placed in him an immortal soul and a thirst to thirst after god and then he tries to satisfy that blessed holy thirst with whiskey alcohol tobacco big times luxury amen pleasure any way that he can people that get weighed down they'll drink they'll do all of that to try to satisfy that thirst that's in their heart because you're not complete you are absolutely not complete without god without the baptism of the holy ghost you're still empty amen and they try all these things to satisfy and it doesn't work does it no it doesn't men and women are only caged and kept away from the real god given privilege that they have they're bound by sin not that god wants them that way but they willfully do that amen they thirst for satisfaction notice brother bam says here this is what i thought about now here we hear so much today we are free we live in a beautiful america and we are free amen isn't that what we hear so much and we have been free it's been you know how many say that freedom isn't free you have to fight for it and guess what you have to keep shedding your blood you have to keep fighting to stay free well we can clearly see that the fight's over people are not willing to fight for freedom anymore that's why it's going to keep going the way that it is amen and that's why our freedoms will be taken from us huh because people oh no no no back whenever kennedy come into office and he was a catholic what happened with him just a little before that brother bam says now they didn't put up with that just a little bit before that but now it's gotten to where people are sleeping yeah and they let it in huh they let it in it came in and so forth and now we don't think nothing of it we could get really political here but we'll hold off anyway listen you are in a million listen so now i know this we are free oh we live in a beautiful we're free he says oh the air is full of it thousand seven but you are a million miles from being free you're not free don't you be deceived by that america is one of the greatest deceived nations and in more bondage than any place i know of they're worst in bondage than communism could put them in that's what he said we're worse as far as not being free here in america then you would be if you was under well putin i was going to say garbage off but that was a few years ago we're up to putin now huh that's right over there they choose you to take you out they take you out you better do what they say do you think they have any people rising up there with police brutality over there i haven't heard anything lately so they will shoot you you know communism real tough no freedom but yet brother brahm says it's worse over here and why can we go into why for just a few minutes let's look at where our liberty truly lays and what it is that we're bound by they're there in worse bondage than communism could put them in cause communism can only hurt the body they can put the body into bondage but when a devil comes in he puts the soul in bondage and man is a slave america is a bunch of slaves amen you may be a slave to pride huh you may walk up and down the street go through the store and follow the you know you may be addicted to fashion and looking good huh that right people will put a tattoo here and you know and yeah i gotta put one over here and i gotta put one down here and i gotta put one over here and uh you know they can't never quit their slave huh and they're marked how many knows the devil's people are marked and god's people are marked the devil's people have the mark of the beast and the people of god are marked by the holy spirit sealed by the holy ghost we're marked by the holy ghost amen now notice that he says you become a slave you can become a slave to your dressing you can become a slave to your money huh that's the only thing you ever think about is money money grab here and distance of yours he says you're a slave i think this church i think every one of us i'm glad i'm glad that god's been very good to us i don't think there's you know everybody that anybody that has to be without hello we're blessed amen if there's anybody don't have any beef we got a freezer full of beef down there by god's great there's still plenty left down there huh i'm just glad for the blessings of god but you have to be careful that you don't become a slave to money and i'll tell you this when you put money before you put the lord you're a slave to that money amen another place how many does he say we're a bunch of idol worshipers an idol worshiper is somebody that puts something else before the lord amen i believe brother brad said it's something to talk about you know we got to put god first god stays first and it is truly too easy to become too occupied with other things and the lord takes the second place in the third place you put the lord in the second place i guarantee you won't be long until he's about six or seventh i could get past early here you wonder sometimes i'll be honest some folks around here they've i don't know where they got him i don't i don't even know he's back somewhere you better get him right better get it right if you expect to make the rapture exactly right hey man you better put him first amen christ first amen all right brother man makes a statement he says listen if you are a christian you're a slave praise the lord brother jeff i'm a slave [Applause] think about it i'm a happy slave i'm glad to be a slave [Applause] you know we ought to walk up and down the streets with the time on our on the front of us am god's slave and then walk around the back and say whose slave are you paul said no man lot to himself and no man dies to himself in other words you're going to serve somebody i don't believe you're going to serve somebody and that master i'll tell you what the devil is the most cruel guy that you could ever imagine serving and being a slave for he will make you so miserable you want to blow your brain down he'll take every bit of joy that you have he'll take every bit of spirit that you have any kind of love any kind of goodness you have and he'll leave you completely empty oh you might think it's a good time to drink and smoke and live in adultery and everything else but it leaves you completely out empty void and condemned unhappy and then at the end of it all he'll let you there and he'll let you die without any hope without god and not care one bit for you amen he won't be your friend in time of need hmm how many believes that when a brother or sister is down you really need to be there for him because if you ain't there for him don't convince me or try to tell me you got that god in your heart nah because that's who god helps those who are in need amen but on the other part we're a slave to how many that's where slaves paul called himself a bond slave to christ i am a prisoner of christ but in this prison when we do literally go to prison we sing songs we pray and angels come and break us out i can't hear you hallelujah how many knows that when the devil captures you when they put you in prison amen and you get down on your knees and you say god break me out of this he'll come and he'll brush you out of your lukewarmness out of your stiffness and out of your being lukewarm and god amen he'll give you the baptism he'll forgive you he'll break you out of that prison that will get you come on folks if you're happy smile let me know you're happy if you're afraid we are not ever afraid i was on the way to church thinking about how that kid's they're free you know huh and i thought i don't know if i'm gonna act to fool or not tonight but maybe we will i said you know why kids go like this is that skipping or something right i can't really do it anymore why because they're happy they're free and they're right and then it's a sign that they have joy they're happy they're free that's the way the believer ought to be god wants you free he who he christ sets free is absolutely free i could use a little more of it up here a little more freedom how about you can you little freedom say oh lord sir set me free set me on fire let me be free from sin from doubt huh but you know how the devil tries to capture us a lot of time if the devil's going to capture you if he go get you you're not going to get you through your mind he'll bring thoughts around oh you're not really of god huh you'll bring things to all kinds of thoughts around uh you can't never overcome huh he'll bring thoughts on my stat sister i tell you i just know that sister don't like me she didn't even look at me and you'll go all week fret you'll be bothered i'm sick that thinking will bother you and bother you when that sister didn't have nothing against you at all that's what the devil does amen he likes to bind us with a bird he likes to make a nest on our head but says you can't help the thoughts from coming but you can help keep that bird off of there and for making a nest on it and while let me say that let me put it that correctly i believe it says he can't help but the birds fly over your head right but they ain't gonna land and get a bunch of straw amen and get you all bungled up because the devil wants your mind boggled up let me just say this 40 years of experience preaching if a thought torments you it's probably not of god if a thought causes you not to be able to sleep at night remember it's the devil because i have thought i've had a lot of them i've had a lot of new thoughts man i tossed and turned and threaded fretted and carried on but you know if i pray if i'll pray and i'll get the right thought every single time if i think what god wants me to think it'll bring me peace it always brings me peace and i say that's it thank you lord praise be to god you love him tonight all right so he says if you're a christian you're a slave you're a bond slave to the lord jesus now notice you have uh you're like two people your body and spirit and if you cater to the flesh you're a slave of the devil amen how many of us we're not here to show our biceps i don't know what triceps are but something somewhere along in there we're not here to brag about our flesh we're here to brag about the holy ghost we're a bag about god amen we're not worried about the flesh the flesh is the devil amen of the devil because holy spirit is of god so notice if you cater to the flesh you're of the devil you and now but you've got to crucify you'll crucify the soul that's in you in other words the flesh will go out doing things that'll just grieve your soul right away from you for the bible says the soul that sinneth that soul shall die and you have to crucify the flesh in order to be a bond slave amen to christ to be a servant of jesus christ so your slave anyway you take it i believe that you're a slave one way or the other amen when you're a loved slave to christ you're shackled to christ by pre-destiny by for the nation by election how many know that his love is in election he elected you that's how he proved his love amen and you're chained by that you put and then you're you're chained to jesus christ you've got a shackle on your leg amen and you love the lord and i'll tell you when your flesh wants to go and do that it just can't go it won't let it go that way no unless you got a unless you uh how does it say it uh you've got religion you're religious but you know the power thereof people deny the power thereof amen you're shackled like paul said he was a prisoner of christ but abandoned when he spoke on that he says he was a love slave to jesus christ i know a man in the message believe the message seemed to be holy ghost filled john smith down in florida and he just quit he went out on the barstool drank he just he just went and went to drink it it wasn't hardly any time at all he was dead seven weeks donna about a week or two seven days or so you know and hey well you say well no you brother bran says you know if a child is disobedient and does that god will take you off the earth you know i'm not the judge of whether you'll be there but it looks to me a whole lot like that's what god did wouldn't you want to be that kind of a slave to god that you would say god before you let me go before i before you let me go you take me i want to be i want to be tied that way to god that he'll take me off the earth before he'll let me be lost i don't know about you but i like this i like this servitude to the lord i like being a love saved to him is it nice to know that cast all your cares upon him for he cares for you cast all your cares upon him for he cares for you that's all you cares upon him for he cares for you what about it why do you keep saying that because i'm 100 convinced that that's what a lot of us need to do a whole lot more of we still have so many cares in our mind well i gotta do this and i gotta make sure that's taken care of don't worry about all of that just cast it all on him and say god i care about you i ain't gotta fret about this i gotta fret about that people are so busy so enslaved with the cares of this world until they can't really be free like they ought to be i hope everybody out there listening listen to this amen don't be so enslaved with the cares of life having to have money having to pay your bills having to do this until you become a slave to it huh jesus didn't want us to be that way no he didn't he says seek ye first the kingdom of the god of heaven and all these things shall be added unto you jesus was the perfect example of god took care of everything he had need of and that right foxes have holes birds have nests simon man didn't have a place to lay his head but there wasn't the time but when he needed a plank to get on the boat that god made him a plank out of water a water plank and he walked out on the water and then right and god will do that for you how many is glad to be serving the living god the living god that cares about you that knows about your daily needs everything you have need of it doesn't matter what it is if you are a slave to him he's the master i don't care how many goliaths giants and stuff come over your way and fixing the clobber you over the head and knock you out no they have to come through him before they come through you to you no matter how don't fear cancer don't fear any of those things it has to be okay by the master first amen and if he allows it to come whoa he'll also take you through just like he did job amen he never thought that a perfect man like job would have to go through that but god allowed it we don't know what our future holds we don't know what we have to go through amen and it doesn't matter because we know the one that holds the future because we are a love slave to him we're tied to him amen and he will not let you go mercy said no i will never let you go amen you love him tonight god bless you let's stand close your eyes bow your heads i want each and every one of you to do a little analysis of yourself what i mean by that is i want you to think about in your life where perhaps you aren't free like you should be i'm sure it isn't drinking or smoking or this that or the other but that's why you have to look at yourself and say am i really free like i should be or am i sitting here a message believer and yet not really free i i've got a weight on my shoulder i'm stressed i've got burdens i'm stressed out i'm under all this pressure i don't know which way to go i don't know what to do maybe it's not even that bad but it's just one little thing in your life somewhere that's got you kind of weighed it down wonder if you'd be honest search your heart think about what it is first of all you have to know what it is before you can lay it at jesus feet see we could have you come to the altar i thought about doing that if you want to lay down your weight you want to lighten up you want to feel like a feather but you know i know that you don't have to come to the altar because i know the altar is your heart and i know he knows your thoughts right now he knows what you're thinking he hears you and i wonder if there's those that were just in their heart and mind say god you know what i have need of right now you know that i'm not as free as i should be i've been caged i've been like a captive i've been like and i've got this and i want to give it to you right now and say god i want to cast my cares upon you i'm coming to you now right now in the name of jesus christ i'm coming to you and i'm casting all my cares upon you lord lord i'm weary i'm tired of this i'm heavy laden i need rest from this god bless that hand god bless you being honest lord jesus i come before you lord both with myself my own hand up and others that are heavy-lifting and have something in their heart that they want to overcome that they want to be free from and i ask in the name of jesus christ that you'll come in the altar of their heart just now father and when they come back sunday when they wake up in the morning when they go home tonight they're going to be different than what they did when they came in those doors because you did the work in their life lord jesus i thank you for being that real of a god that can change something just like that lord we realize lord that it is so hard people cannot change but the holy ghost does change people you do change as lord we ask god that you do it right now lord jesus set us free make us completely free from anxiety from stress from worry from all these things set us free lord and help us to completely yield ourselves to you god to go from this place lord jesus a different person there's any on radio land the same there if truly in their hearts they mean to god don't let thursday be the same as wednesday was but change them change their attitude change their perspective lord on their job amongst their workers god made the people see there's a change that's taken place right now father in the name of jesus christ we ask god amen and amen you love him god bless you brother david
