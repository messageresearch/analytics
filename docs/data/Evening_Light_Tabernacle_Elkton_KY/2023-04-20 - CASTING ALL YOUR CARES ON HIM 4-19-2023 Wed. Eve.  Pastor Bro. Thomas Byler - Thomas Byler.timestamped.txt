[47:57] and thank you
[48:09] is it okay if I give a short praise
[48:11] report just a minute or two
[48:13] um I just wanted to thank the Lord so
[48:15] back in November of 2020 I was actually
[48:19] flying here Celia and
[48:23] um a friend gave me a handgun the day
[48:25] before as a gift and I forgot it in my
[48:28] carry-on bag and brought it through at
[48:30] the airport
[48:31] and uh I got arrested at the airport and
[48:34] my parents were with me and They
[48:36] confiscated the gun but they ended up
[48:38] letting me get on my flight and
[48:40] everything but I never thought I'd see a
[48:41] gun again I didn't know if I was going
[48:42] to get prosecuted when I was reading
[48:45] online and they said it was a minimum
[48:47] three thousand dollar fine from TSA
[48:50] um and then the state could prosecute
[48:52] too so I was really nervous but back
[48:54] then we just prayed and committed to God
[48:57] and said whatever happens and I never
[48:59] heard anything about them
[49:01] um but I kind of always lived in the
[49:03] back of my head just waiting for the
[49:04] phone call that it was time to go to
[49:06] court and on Monday I got a call from a
[49:09] detective with Seattle Police Department
[49:10] and he told me that the statue of
[49:13] limitations has run out on the case they
[49:15] never prosecuted so I'm free and clear
[49:18] and they also shipped a gun here to
[49:20] Elkton so I got to come back too so I
[49:23] just want to thank the Lord
[49:26] all right I've never been more happy to
[49:28] pay a 25 shipping fee better than a
[49:32] three thousand dollar fine amen
[49:35] I was down this evening as brother
[49:37] Butler comes listening Jesus the light
[49:39] of the world

[53:45] certainly ministered on before but we
[53:47] want to try to just go over it again I
[53:49] hope you don't mind amen and it has to
[53:52] do with really it has to do with
[53:54] guarding guarding ourselves amen
[53:58] um
[53:59] and also about having a walk with the
[54:04] Lord amen and uh so turn your bibles if
[54:08] you will to II Peter first Peter if you
[54:10] will we'll just get into the word
[54:13] first Peter
[54:23] and I'll just kind of share you with my
[54:26] testimony a little bit first Peter and
[54:29] five
[54:31] first Peter 5.
[54:39] and verse 6 humble yourselves therefore
[54:42] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[54:46] exalt you in due time casting all your
[54:50] cares upon Him for he careth for you and
[54:53] I believe she titled that casting all
[54:55] your cares upon Him amen
[54:59] praise the Lord
[55:01] for he careth for you be sober be
[55:04] vigilant because your adversary the
[55:06] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[55:09] seeking whom he may devour whom resists
[55:12] steadfast in the faith amen I hope that
[55:15] that will be a key word that we use and
[55:18] expound on this evening amen resisting
[55:22] the devil Amen in faith amen how many
[55:25] knows that your faith is what quenches
[55:27] all the fiery darts of the wicked amen
[55:31] faith we also understand is not one of
[55:33] the five senses that we have but in a
[55:36] Believer is the only one really that has
[55:38] this it has that called The Prophet
[55:40] called it is Sixth Sense amen how many
[55:43] believes we've got to live by that Sixth
[55:45] Sense
[55:45] amen knowing that the same afflictions
[55:48] are accomplished in your brethren that
[55:50] are in the world but the God of all
[55:52] Grace who hath called us unto his
[55:54] eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that
[55:57] ye have suffered a while make you
[55:59] perfect established strengthened and
[56:01] settle you amen may God add His
[56:03] blessings to reading of the word you can
[56:05] be seated tonight amen amen I was just
[56:09] kind of going through something a little
[56:10] bit this week something was just kind of
[56:12] Weighing on my mind and amen and all my
[56:15] heart and I was just seeking the Lord
[56:17] about it and praying about it and amen
[56:20] this came to me amen and about casting
[56:22] all your cares upon Him for he cares for
[56:26] you amen of course just being able to
[56:29] pray and being able to commit it to God
[56:31] I experienced the experience of being
[56:33] able to images lay it on the Lord and
[56:36] just give it to the god amen and and I
[56:40] stand here with that amen gone with that
[56:43] care so to speak out of my heart out of
[56:46] my life so I believe that it's you can
[56:48] do that amen it believes you can do that
[56:50] you can cast your cares on the Lord
[56:53] because he cares for you
[56:57] amen now another place you know Jesus I
[56:59] believe it was said in Matthew 11 and 28
[57:03] he says come unto me all ye that laborer
[57:06] and our heavy laden and I will give you
[57:09] rest take my yoke upon you and learn to
[57:11] me for our meek and lowly in heart and
[57:14] ye shall find rest unto your souls
[57:19] amen so we could look at it we realize
[57:21] that you and I were born with a heavy
[57:23] weight on us amen a lot of cares and
[57:26] I'll tell you what a man that is born of
[57:29] a woman is a few days and
[57:32] amen full of trouble so you can expect a
[57:35] whole lot of trouble in this world
[57:38] other than that you know and then not
[57:40] only that but all the days of your life
[57:43] now unfortunately those that don't have
[57:45] Christ don't have a place to take their
[57:48] cares a place to take their burdens
[57:51] their weight amen but the Christian does
[57:54] we've got somewhere where we can take it
[57:57] praise the Lord and God will just fix us
[58:00] up so to speak you know I had to think
[58:02] you know this week I was going and I was
[58:04] trying to work on my tractor and getting
[58:06] Tobacco off of it and so forth taking
[58:08] them big hydraulic hoses off something
[58:10] I'd never done before and so anyway we
[58:12] took it off and realized that somehow we
[58:14] got to plug them hoses hoses and artists
[58:17] Hydraulics you're gonna go screw viewing
[58:19] everywhere right don't take much of a
[58:21] Byler to figure that one out you know
[58:24] but anyway that went uh I went you know
[58:27] I went to Lewisburg and they had the
[58:28] size before then the size above it below
[58:31] it and above it the ones that hey uh up
[58:33] here to Elk and there they do hydraulic
[58:35] hoses they had the one above it they had
[58:37] the one below but I went over to aiming
[58:39] all the way over to that place over
[58:41] there in Russellville and they do and I
[58:43] forget the name of the place but it's a
[58:44] big Dave's slices and hydraulics there
[58:47] the thing below it and above us and then
[58:49] they had two of them that had a special
[58:51] coupling on it you know and it was 25 or
[58:54] more dollars each and it was five fifty
[58:56] two dollars or so for for just two
[58:58] little couplings and they said but I can
[59:00] have it tomorrow you know I can have
[59:02] them for about eleven dollars you know
[59:03] and I needed about four of them because
[59:05] I want to plug everything that needs
[59:06] plugged I got some extra but anyway car
[59:09] you know it was a little frustrating and
[59:11] then so it was the next day of course
[59:13] the next day I come to find out they
[59:14] didn't have they didn't get it so we'll
[59:16] get it in tomorrow and I'm like oh boy
[59:17] you know this place deals with this you
[59:20] know so anyway that Tractor Supply to
[59:22] Nava we went to the other places over
[59:24] there nobody hardly had it you know but
[59:26] uh you know it's nice when you go to a
[59:29] place and they have what you need
[59:34] amen amen and you know Paul said my God
[59:37] shall supply all your need according to
[59:41] his riches in Christ Jesus so when we
[59:44] come to church folks I want you to know
[59:46] when you come to Christ you come to a
[59:49] place that he can take care of what your
[59:51] need is
[59:53] oh aren't you glad for that amen and I
[59:57] don't care what your care is I don't
[59:59] care what problem is your trouble is
[1:00:01] your trial is it don't matter Cass not
[1:00:04] some of your cares about it but it casts
[1:00:06] all your cares upon Him for he cares
[1:00:11] about you how many knows he knows
[1:00:13] everything about you not like living for
[1:00:15] the Lord because I'll tell you now that
[1:00:17] if you didn't have a daily walk with
[1:00:19] Christ
[1:00:20] and you didn't have fellowship with on
[1:00:22] them a daily basis you'd be a miserable
[1:00:24] person
[1:00:26] oh my
[1:00:28] God praise the Lord but you know I want
[1:00:30] to go into something with the help of
[1:00:32] the Lord but now I know there's not I
[1:00:33] want to just realize that you know that
[1:00:35] we come to church we come to Christ not
[1:00:37] just church but certainly this should be
[1:00:39] a place that when you have a need for
[1:00:41] something amen and I want to finish the
[1:00:44] story but anyway they ordered it did
[1:00:46] they said they'll be a day later so
[1:00:48] today I went there and they had my
[1:00:49] coupling so praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:00:52] you know but you know when I went there
[1:00:54] at first I needed two males and I I
[1:00:56] believe it was two males and a female
[1:00:58] right well I got so caught up in trying
[1:01:01] to find something that they give me four
[1:01:03] males well I got home and I said I
[1:01:04] forgot about the female you know I need
[1:01:06] to tell them I need a female and so I
[1:01:09] got that you know I got back to the
[1:01:10] track this afternoon you know and I said
[1:01:13] I gotta go try that see away from that
[1:01:15] back end you know and in any way come to
[1:01:18] find out no no you're still stuck that's
[1:01:20] this boy that's just how it is with
[1:01:21] heavy equipment you know it takes three
[1:01:23] days to try to get a couple plugs or
[1:01:25] something you know but you're gonna have
[1:01:26] to be patient but anyway
[1:01:29] so anyway now where was I
[1:01:31] yeah I'm about as forgetful as I did
[1:01:33] about the female right but anyway it was
[1:01:36] diving away and realizing no you gotta
[1:01:38] have females so thank God I had their
[1:01:39] car took their card with me right I give
[1:01:41] them a call hey yeah thanks for getting
[1:01:43] me them caps real nice like you know I
[1:01:45] appreciate it and I realized I need a
[1:01:47] female also can you order me yeah no
[1:01:49] problem we'll have it at 9 o'clock oh
[1:01:52] not happy but whenever your need is
[1:01:56] supplied how many believe that Christ
[1:01:57] surprise you or need tonight
[1:01:59] amen so we can catch all of our care all
[1:02:03] of our cares we can cast upon him
[1:02:08] oh my cares are like needs or or things
[1:02:12] you know uh things that you have need of
[1:02:16] your carers amen and do so cast all of
[1:02:19] those upon him
[1:02:21] praise the Lord
[1:02:22] you know now and I want to go into
[1:02:25] something like I said have you preached
[1:02:27] on many times before but I want to go
[1:02:29] into it again because we realize that it
[1:02:32] says here that the devil be over be
[1:02:35] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:02:37] devil has a roaring God walketh about
[1:02:39] seeking whom he may devour tonight's
[1:02:43] service it's got to have it's got to do
[1:02:45] with dying daily I was thinking on the
[1:02:47] way to church you know amen you mean I
[1:02:49] gotta deny daily what that means is that
[1:02:52] you've got to kill yourself every day
[1:02:59] yeah you
[1:03:01] get every day and I don't nobody gonna
[1:03:03] commit the suicide here folks let's not
[1:03:05] misread this
[1:03:07] But You Gotta Die to yourself that's
[1:03:09] chance to die every day why because that
[1:03:12] self always wants to raise up
[1:03:15] amen info now we know that better brand
[1:03:17] of preach a message called the greatest
[1:03:21] battle that was ever fought wouldn't it
[1:03:23] any minute he got his message I'll just
[1:03:25] love the way the prophet God could lay
[1:03:27] down out there under the river green
[1:03:28] beans look up in the skies and get it he
[1:03:30] can pick up a cigarette back and get him
[1:03:32] in he could drive down the road and get
[1:03:33] the message you know and so anyway he
[1:03:35] was looking at the solar system and the
[1:03:37] galaxies and everything like that and he
[1:03:38] realized that all of those places you
[1:03:41] know they have a place amen and they
[1:03:43] stay where they're supposed to be amen
[1:03:46] and he talked and he began to talk about
[1:03:48] what our greatest battle is and how did
[1:03:49] our greatest battle starts in the mind
[1:03:52] and the human mind is where the great
[1:03:54] battle
[1:03:55] star
[1:03:57] amen and that's where the problem is
[1:03:59] right here
[1:04:00] I like what Phil Bontrager he says I
[1:04:03] talked about he says if you can bring
[1:04:04] every thought captive to the word of God
[1:04:06] Amen it'll stop a lot of problems in
[1:04:09] your life
[1:04:10] yeah
[1:04:12] why do we gotta Die daily because the
[1:04:14] devil don't stop the devil don't never
[1:04:15] stop trying to get you
[1:04:18] and if you don't die every day and if
[1:04:20] you don't know what you're fighting
[1:04:22] why you never know how to defeat him
[1:04:25] but this man's caught the greatest
[1:04:26] battle ever found it's a great message
[1:04:28] see brother begins to talk about amen he
[1:04:31] begins with talking about the three
[1:04:33] little rings and I really was wishing
[1:04:35] that I'd have had about another day
[1:04:36] because I really want to get back on my
[1:04:39] projector and so forth up there and and
[1:04:41] you know a little much more teaching and
[1:04:43] so on but he's at the three little Rings
[1:04:46] which was the body and the three second
[1:04:48] one was the spirit but inside of that
[1:04:50] third one was the soul amen and he
[1:04:53] talked about on the outside we have she
[1:04:56] taste feel here and smell
[1:04:58] damn it
[1:05:00] and so many people and you and I whether
[1:05:03] you
[1:05:04] taste I don't deal with so much you know
[1:05:06] and smell I don't deal with so much you
[1:05:09] know because that has a whole lot to do
[1:05:10] with the state that I ate today
[1:05:12] nice State too you know but it's really
[1:05:15] gotten very little spiritual
[1:05:16] significance but not the things that I
[1:05:18] see the things that I hear
[1:05:21] hello Amy not that has a bearing on my
[1:05:24] life and the way that I no I mean the
[1:05:27] way that we feel has a big balance on
[1:05:28] our life
[1:05:30] amen and so that's control but the man
[1:05:32] talked about how they were controlled by
[1:05:34] these senses or we make contact with
[1:05:36] this Earth through these census
[1:05:39] how many believe that amenities outer
[1:05:42] senses and so forth now on the inside
[1:05:44] since of course we realize on the
[1:05:47] spiritual side is your mind
[1:05:50] is in the spirit Realm
[1:05:52] how many believe that your mind is in
[1:05:55] the spirit realm and Brother Band talk
[1:05:56] about how that we have conscience we
[1:05:59] have reasoning we have memories we have
[1:06:01] infect affections and we have
[1:06:03] imaginations
[1:06:05] thank you
[1:06:09] wow
[1:06:11] and we got a lot of noise
[1:06:17] huh
[1:06:18] that better
[1:06:20] something up here
[1:06:22] huh
[1:06:25] well well well
[1:06:29] just get on out of here Dev I know you
[1:06:31] just don't like this service already
[1:06:33] all right let's see what I'm doing wrong
[1:06:36] all right
[1:07:04] you all get to see whether I know how to
[1:07:07] do this thing or not
[1:07:10] all right we'll let the clip be back
[1:07:12] there somewhere praise the Lord
[1:07:14] all right so we see you in the in the
[1:07:16] spiritual realm we have we have
[1:07:23] an imaginations and these are all I call
[1:07:25] them 12 doors
[1:07:27] 12 doors
[1:07:29] that the devil can get into you
[1:07:32] he can give you problems with he can
[1:07:35] give me problems with because see part
[1:07:36] of my problem was is the devil tried to
[1:07:38] get in my memory this week
[1:07:42] and he tried to make me think things
[1:07:45] because so what you think affects you
[1:07:48] I mean it affects your whole world the
[1:07:51] thoughts that you allow to go through
[1:07:52] your mind affects you
[1:07:57] oh my it's a very very important thing
[1:08:00] this right here is
[1:08:02] amen devil as of support don't worry
[1:08:05] about your neighbor don't never know
[1:08:07] about nobody else just think about you
[1:08:09] just think about yourself that's what I
[1:08:11] think about myself
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:18] it's quite something but you know in our
[1:08:20] government oh I take accountability for
[1:08:23] what I didn't but after they're in
[1:08:24] office no they didn't you know
[1:08:25] immigration problems that's happening
[1:08:27] now that was Trump's fault
[1:08:29] oh that's really taking responsibility
[1:08:31] they didn't do that when he was here
[1:08:34] and the American people they just
[1:08:36] swallowed up don't they but let me tell
[1:08:38] you as a Christian to me as a Christian
[1:08:40] we got to take responsibility for
[1:08:41] ourselves
[1:08:43] how many believe that got to take
[1:08:44] responsibility for ourself it's your
[1:08:47] world
[1:08:48] it's your mind it's your your Galaxy is
[1:08:51] the prophet of God's head
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:54] oh my now notice
[1:08:57] so we see that there's those those and
[1:09:00] then there's two more there's actually
[1:09:02] two more
[1:09:03] actually let's say
[1:09:06] yeah do more things
[1:09:08] all right dispute realm is affections
[1:09:11] and all of those but in this song oh
[1:09:14] how many knows that only has one of two
[1:09:18] that's gonna govern you
[1:09:21] Faith or doubt
[1:09:24] Faith or doubt your whole world
[1:09:26] everything else amen all of you all of
[1:09:30] your feelings all of your imaginations
[1:09:33] all of your spirit is going to be
[1:09:35] controlled by the property God said by
[1:09:39] the three moral agency uh the power of
[1:09:42] self-will
[1:09:43] the choice that you make of whether
[1:09:46] you're going to be operated by doubt or
[1:09:48] whether you're going to be operated by
[1:09:50] faith
[1:09:53] I may believe that
[1:09:55] amen now conscious let's just talk about
[1:10:02] it's for a little bit because that means
[1:10:03] they want to get they don't like
[1:10:05] Christians
[1:10:07] they don't like for women to walk down
[1:10:09] into Walmart with a dress on and long
[1:10:11] hair because they're conscious
[1:10:14] they know that what they're doing is
[1:10:16] wrong that's what they're supposed to
[1:10:18] dress like you realize that you are the
[1:10:20] world's conscience
[1:10:22] they know better
[1:10:25] they know but they don't like it and if
[1:10:27] the devil
[1:10:28] Devil Couldn't he wants to get rid of
[1:10:29] the Christians why do you think they
[1:10:31] kill them get rid of them give me the
[1:10:33] one I'm not we don't want no
[1:10:34] Commandments we don't want nothing but
[1:10:36] to do with God
[1:10:37] because their conscience bothers them
[1:10:40] remember even brother man said they're
[1:10:42] all laughing you this out of the other
[1:10:45] day of a conscience that bothers
[1:10:46] somebody trying to appease themselves
[1:10:49] and they're trying to satisfy that in
[1:10:52] Old way and getting themselves fixed by
[1:10:55] having a fix or the drugs or all of that
[1:10:57] trying to drown out their conscience
[1:11:02] foreign
[1:11:04] you glad that you don't have to do all
[1:11:06] of that
[1:11:07] because you came to the place to work
[1:11:09] for your conscience and things are taken
[1:11:12] care of
[1:11:13] they know they're going to come to the
[1:11:15] door of death
[1:11:16] they know they're going to die
[1:11:18] huh we know that we're gonna pass away
[1:11:21] but we won't have to be scared of it
[1:11:24] huh and it bothers them
[1:11:27] people even go to church people go to
[1:11:29] church and denominations church and
[1:11:31] everything else to try to appease their
[1:11:33] mind and their conscience
[1:11:35] but it can never bring its satisfaction
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:40] just one of those things is precious how
[1:11:42] many believes it's precious to have a
[1:11:44] conscience we're supposed to be
[1:11:45] sensitive in our conscience but
[1:11:47] sensitive with everything that we do
[1:11:50] every word that we speak
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:54] but people as the prophet of God said
[1:11:56] don't have any conscience a lot of
[1:11:57] people don't have conscience
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:00] so we think about these different
[1:12:02] avenues that the devil actually tries to
[1:12:05] work in now notice Let me just read on
[1:12:07] and in the end on the inside amen you're
[1:12:10] a free Malaysian you either accept it
[1:12:13] or reject or rejected you to accept
[1:12:16] Faith or doubt and that creates and
[1:12:18] makes your
[1:12:20] world
[1:12:21] now notice that for Satan begin at the
[1:12:24] principle of part to cause the spirit of
[1:12:26] man to doubt God's word at first I
[1:12:29] thought about speaking on the power of
[1:12:30] the spoken word or the power of the word
[1:12:33] because remember this that God uses word
[1:12:36] to create our world and the devil uses
[1:12:40] word
[1:12:42] to deceive us
[1:12:44] he uses word
[1:12:47] God has said she said and the devil said
[1:12:49] yeah but huh
[1:12:51] Thou shalt not surely he used words and
[1:12:54] brought this whole thing into what it is
[1:12:57] because of somebody believing the wrong
[1:13:00] word
[1:13:01] how many beliefs it's a very important
[1:13:03] what word you allowed to go in your mind
[1:13:05] a thought that you allowed to go in your
[1:13:07] mind
[1:13:08] and it's a daily Bible folks I know
[1:13:11] I know because the devil will try to
[1:13:14] cause you to have a memory an infection
[1:13:16] and things like that because we all have
[1:13:18] affection we're supposed to have
[1:13:20] affection feel kindly affectionate one
[1:13:22] to another isn't that right
[1:13:24] people don't even have that they don't
[1:13:26] even have any kind of a feeling now
[1:13:28] notice this and I want to just say this
[1:13:30] greatest battle on paragraph 52 but the
[1:13:33] RAM says if this church right now could
[1:13:35] be put together and knitted together
[1:13:37] with such that every person would be in
[1:13:39] one Accord with not one shadow of a
[1:13:42] doubt anywhere there wouldn't be one
[1:13:44] feeble person in our midst in another
[1:13:46] five minutes
[1:13:49] oh my there would not be nobody here
[1:13:52] Desiring the Holy Ghost
[1:13:55] but what would receive and if you could
[1:13:59] get that something fixed
[1:14:01] oh my
[1:14:03] hello how many of those Let Jesus fix it
[1:14:07] I believe this is a fixer-up place this
[1:14:09] is where Jesus fixes that
[1:14:14] what does he do he teaches us the cast
[1:14:17] all of our cares
[1:14:20] upon him
[1:14:22] for he cares for you
[1:14:25] now we know that we are all born in sin
[1:14:28] shaping and they will get it coming into
[1:14:29] the world speaking lies we all come
[1:14:32] needing fixed
[1:14:35] we need fixed and a lot of times we fall
[1:14:38] short of the glory of God
[1:14:40] a lot of times we fail we need fixed
[1:14:43] amen I hope you don't leave this
[1:14:45] building tonight until you get fixed if
[1:14:46] you need fixing tonight
[1:14:48] amen
[1:14:50] no sense in it
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:54] praise the Lord
[1:14:56] all right
[1:14:59] praise be the God now notice what he
[1:15:01] said now first it must be accepted in
[1:15:04] the mind and then it's believed with the
[1:15:06] heart
[1:15:08] then the word of God become a reality I
[1:15:12] mean believe that
[1:15:14] amen first before you can ever become
[1:15:16] the kind of Christian that you're
[1:15:17] supposed to be you have to first receive
[1:15:19] it in your mind then believe it with
[1:15:21] your heart amen and then it becomes a
[1:15:24] reality amen
[1:15:26] amen
[1:15:28] now notice I'm gonna stop there and read
[1:15:31] perhaps the other half
[1:15:33] here in a little bit
[1:15:35] you see way back Yonder
[1:15:38] he says if we want to open up our
[1:15:40] channels then and we've uh we can see we
[1:15:43] find that about this one and that one
[1:15:46] over there thousands of them testifying
[1:15:48] of what God has done but the devil will
[1:15:50] try to come right back see if he could
[1:15:53] get in there at all amen if notice if he
[1:15:57] can get in our Senses at all he's got
[1:16:00] your army routed right then
[1:16:02] how many knows if he can get you see
[1:16:04] your teeth you feel you hear your smell
[1:16:06] if he can get in any of those channels
[1:16:09] he's got you
[1:16:11] who got you right there
[1:16:14] your affection
[1:16:16] you look at the wrong thing
[1:16:19] how many of those he's got you right
[1:16:21] there I mean you got to watch what you
[1:16:23] look at
[1:16:25] you gotta watch what kind of affections
[1:16:27] you have
[1:16:29] um I want to go somewhere but I'm going
[1:16:31] to hold off
[1:16:33] praise the Lord
[1:16:35] he got your army routed but right back
[1:16:38] right then if you've got your senses
[1:16:40] your seed tastes feel hear and smell he
[1:16:42] says they're all right but don't trust
[1:16:44] them unless they agree with the word
[1:16:48] praise be to God how many knows even
[1:16:50] while I was while I was struggling with
[1:16:52] this thought that the devil put in my
[1:16:54] mind it caused me to feel a certain way
[1:16:57] and then I said now I know that that
[1:16:59] feeling isn't the way that I should feel
[1:17:04] huh
[1:17:05] this feeling that I got is causing me to
[1:17:08] have thoughts that I shouldn't think
[1:17:11] huh
[1:17:12] it's not according to the word
[1:17:16] whoa
[1:17:18] man am I ever glad and I prayed and I
[1:17:21] prayed and I cast my cares upon Him and
[1:17:23] all of a sudden God give me the right
[1:17:25] thought
[1:17:28] all of a sudden my mind began to think
[1:17:31] the right thoughts and my feeling begin
[1:17:33] to feel right again
[1:17:36] it's not always easy
[1:17:38] to take the right things
[1:17:41] because the devil will come into your
[1:17:42] memory over a minute oh you remember
[1:17:44] this and you remember don't let the
[1:17:46] devil come in there in your memory
[1:17:48] because most of the time the devil
[1:17:50] coming oh you remembered I'll tell you
[1:17:51] right now if I would go back and I think
[1:17:53] about everything I ever done wrong I'd
[1:17:55] just pretty much want to damn myself
[1:17:59] don't even don't even bring it back
[1:18:01] don't even pick it up I don't want to
[1:18:03] hear it because that ain't nothing but
[1:18:06] huh
[1:18:09] wouldn't we all
[1:18:11] we all we dwell on the past
[1:18:14] on your past the failures that you've
[1:18:17] had
[1:18:18] come into that memory
[1:18:21] amen
[1:18:23] then it'll make you think like you
[1:18:24] shouldn't think
[1:18:25] feel like you shouldn't feel
[1:18:28] praise the Lord
[1:18:34] amen
[1:18:37] I'm happy in the Lord anyway
[1:18:41] it doesn't matter it would come my way
[1:18:44] follow you on how many please there's
[1:18:46] after such a thrill in Victory
[1:18:50] can I say something we either live
[1:18:52] Victorious lives or defeated lives
[1:18:57] I believe as Christians sin
[1:19:00] should be under our feet
[1:19:04] all of our affections and all of our
[1:19:06] reasons and all our emotes sometimes we
[1:19:07] have good days and sometimes we have bad
[1:19:09] days I ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:14] praise the Lord
[1:19:17] oh my
[1:19:21] praise God let me go on
[1:19:24] now notice don't trust them unless they
[1:19:27] agree with the word
[1:19:29] that's right listen they're okay but if
[1:19:33] they disagree with the word don't you
[1:19:35] listen to them
[1:19:37] how many's ever had a feeling
[1:19:40] huh
[1:19:41] that was a really bad feeling
[1:19:44] and you knew that wasn't God
[1:19:47] let me tell you as a Christian all of us
[1:19:49] as mature Christians here for mature
[1:19:50] Christians not just We Are Tonight
[1:19:52] you can tell when you've got a feeling
[1:19:54] that you shouldn't have
[1:19:59] amen
[1:20:01] we don't go by those feelings we bring
[1:20:03] those feelings under subjection say God
[1:20:05] I'm casting my feelings on you Lord
[1:20:08] my memories on you I'm cast my memory on
[1:20:11] the Lord cast all your cares for on him
[1:20:14] for he cares for you
[1:20:17] you know I wrote a couple things down
[1:20:19] I'll just maybe mention it well maybe
[1:20:22] I'll read it when you don't cast your
[1:20:25] cares upon Him
[1:20:27] it means that you have a lack of faith
[1:20:29] in him
[1:20:30] you're not operating by faith
[1:20:33] whether you don't cast your cares
[1:20:35] because whatever your care is he can fix
[1:20:38] it he can take care of it
[1:20:41] amen
[1:20:43] but a lot of times sometimes we we try
[1:20:46] to fix things ourselves
[1:20:50] because either we think that God is not
[1:20:52] able
[1:20:54] but most likely we do it because we know
[1:20:56] God isn't going to fix it the way we
[1:20:58] want it fixed
[1:21:00] so we're going to fix it the way we want
[1:21:01] to fix it and that's when we get our
[1:21:02] dirty hands in it
[1:21:05] and mess it up royally
[1:21:07] and I'm here to tell you when you do
[1:21:09] that it's the devil governing you
[1:21:11] the devil governing me when I'm going to
[1:21:14] fix something that we all want to fix it
[1:21:15] I'm going to make it happen
[1:21:18] let me tell you something that's an Esau
[1:21:20] person
[1:21:22] there's always a spiritual church and
[1:21:24] there's a natural carnal search the
[1:21:26] carnal Church tries to achieve it by
[1:21:28] natural means
[1:21:29] I'm going to make this happen no no no
[1:21:31] give it to the Lord
[1:21:34] cast your cares upon Him
[1:21:37] and let him take care of it for you
[1:21:40] he who shall supply all your need
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:46] Lord help me when I think about it these
[1:21:48] I'll tell you what these emotions and
[1:21:50] these affections these feelings if
[1:21:52] they're not a whack it's a terrible
[1:21:54] thing
[1:21:55] are you with me nobody likes to feel
[1:21:57] terrible
[1:22:00] have bad affections and all of that
[1:22:03] nobody
[1:22:06] praise be to God
[1:22:07] I thought you know now notice let's go
[1:22:10] on so now imaginations
[1:22:13] oh boy do we let our imaginations run
[1:22:16] away from us sometimes don't we
[1:22:18] conscience memories
[1:22:21] reasons and affections they're all right
[1:22:24] if they agree with the word but if your
[1:22:26] affection doesn't agree with the word I
[1:22:28] mean knows if you ain't got the right
[1:22:30] affection
[1:22:31] then get rid of that affection you got
[1:22:33] the wrong affection
[1:22:36] amen get rid of it you'll blow a flu
[1:22:39] right quick if you reason if your reason
[1:22:41] disagrees with the word get away from it
[1:22:44] amen or any of those things now notice
[1:22:46] what do you got then you've got a solar
[1:22:49] system Hallelujah God sets the Stars up

[1:23:18] get a man in his hands till he can get
[1:23:21] all of his senses and conscience and all
[1:23:23] of that cleaned out until there he
[1:23:24] stands God there behind it in the spirit

[1:23:29] can poke in there whoa

[1:23:42] devil will come at you with he can roar
[1:23:45] all they want stupid they'll never go in
[1:23:47] there if the holy spirit is in there
[1:23:50] governing
[1:23:52] controlling every
[1:23:55] portion of you
[1:23:57] amen
[1:24:01] oh my praise be to God aren't you glad
[1:24:04] for that

[1:24:18] Eve before she could take any word in
[1:24:20] she had to open up her mind isn't that
[1:24:22] right
[1:24:23] the devil uses it the same way God uses
[1:24:26] it you'll never be saved until you
[1:24:27] believe your Gods who loved the world
[1:24:29] and he gave his only begotten son
[1:24:30] whosoever believeth him shall not perish
[1:24:32] isn't that right till you believe that
[1:24:34] with all of your heart

[1:24:38] the Holy Spirit placed at the
[1:24:40] Battlefront to take God's word see he is
[1:24:43] the word and he stands then there's
[1:24:45] nothing going to stop it then nothing

[1:24:49] cleared up just like an old boiler with
[1:24:52] flu stopped up you put a fire in a Blow
[1:24:54] The Thing Up he said that's what's the
[1:24:56] matter with so many blowed up Christians
[1:24:58] is because if they don't clean that
[1:25:00] channel now
[1:25:02] how many believe we got to keep our
[1:25:04] channels every channel

[1:26:53] at all nothing at all just accept it on
[1:26:55] the what the word of God has said and so
[1:26:58] and it sets a stream now notice this
[1:27:00] front line it's it sets a stream between
[1:27:03] you and God and every channel comes open
[1:27:07] between you and God then he says there's
[1:27:10] the battle that's the very front
[1:27:14] lying
[1:27:16] somebody believes that's where the front
[1:27:17] line of every one of our battles is

[1:27:43] thank you
[1:27:46] well let me let me finish this other
[1:27:47] quote before I go into there
[1:27:49] notice he says it must be accepted in
[1:27:52] the mind and so forth he says and then
[1:27:53] he says in every sense of your soul and
[1:27:56] body
[1:27:57] poured out with the Holy Spirit then
[1:28:00] your sense of God your conscience of God
[1:28:02] you're everything that's Godly flows
[1:28:06] through you
[1:28:07] how many ones that see that's what I
[1:28:09] want everything that's Godly
[1:28:11] flows through me
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:18] there's not a doubt anywhere
[1:28:21] there's nothing that can rise up there's
[1:28:24] nothing that can come up in your memory
[1:28:27] saying well miss so and so they tried to
[1:28:30] trust God it doesn't matter how many
[1:28:31] tried it and it didn't make it or fail
[1:28:33] or whatever it doesn't matter amen
[1:28:36] now no matter what Miss Jones or one of
[1:28:39] them did now notice but Abraham says
[1:28:41] kill him at the beginning stop him dead
[1:28:44] in his tracks
[1:28:46] how many believes in stopping the devil
[1:28:48] dead in his tracks
[1:28:53] it ain't how long you can make the war
[1:28:55] linger
[1:28:56] huh how many knows sometimes we fight
[1:28:58] with stuff for a long long time I have
[1:29:02] years and years and years Amen to fight
[1:29:06] with things fight with things in my mind
[1:29:10] oh my
[1:29:13] praise be to God
[1:29:16] you know I want to say about memory
[1:29:19] especially me when I was thinking about
[1:29:20] memory and the things that the devil
[1:29:22] tried to bring back in my mind
[1:29:24] you know I thought Lord Jesus I am so
[1:29:26] glad that I don't have to remember all
[1:29:28] that
[1:29:30] I can cast all of that in the Lord
[1:29:32] because if I would live by the things
[1:29:34] that I would remember I would be nuts
[1:29:37] I would be crazy you would probably be
[1:29:40] too huh
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:45] now notice hey that's right now notice
[1:29:48] no matter don't make the war linger it's
[1:29:51] stop it right now if you'll come and
[1:29:53] you'll keep them memories and conscience
[1:29:54] and everything that you're thinking
[1:29:55] about well I might fail and so forth he
[1:29:57] says don't even do that at all throw it
[1:30:00] aside and open up the channel and say
[1:30:01] God your word is eternally true and it's
[1:30:04] for me if the whole church failed if the
[1:30:07] whole world fails yet I can't fail
[1:30:09] because I am taking your word
[1:30:13] let's talk about that word the rest of
[1:30:15] the service for about 10 or so minutes
[1:30:16] well let's go out early tonight
[1:30:19] Tommy I know he's got a long way to go
[1:30:21] whether Steve's got just as far as not
[1:30:24] feather amen
[1:30:25] amen we appreciate how long distance God
[1:30:27] persons amen and our short distance
[1:30:30] people
[1:30:31] but listen let's talk about that word
[1:30:33] with the help of the Lord first of all
[1:30:35] the word the Bible talks about how that
[1:30:37] wears to bring to bring every thought
[1:30:39] into captivity to what The Obedience of
[1:30:42] the word of God
[1:30:46] I was thinking today
[1:30:48] amen about uh
[1:30:52] something that Jesus said
[1:30:57] it is found in Matthew 12 Matthew 12.
[1:31:03] this is where I want to just say
[1:31:05] something as a pastor here to the
[1:31:08] congregation here
[1:31:10] to us amen
[1:31:12] because I want us to I want us to
[1:31:16] because I know that if we're truly a
[1:31:18] Church of God the devil's not going to
[1:31:20] be happy with that
[1:31:21] he's not going to leave us alone
[1:31:24] he's going to attack us he's going to
[1:31:26] come in any channel any Avenue that he
[1:31:29] possibly can
[1:31:31] and I'm believing I'm talking to mature
[1:31:33] Christians I have believed that we hit
[1:31:36] that evening like Tabernacle our mature
[1:31:38] Christians where there's a lot of things
[1:31:40] that we are above
[1:31:41] are you with me
[1:31:43] if we're not above it then we're still
[1:31:45] children
[1:31:47] amen still babes in Christ
[1:31:51] amen things that uh you know things that
[1:31:54] men you we should never have to battle
[1:31:56] again
[1:31:57] amen
[1:32:00] and I got to thinking about this
[1:32:02] in Matthew
[1:32:05] 12 and verse 30
[1:32:08] 5 a good man out of the good Treasure of
[1:32:10] his heart bringeth forth good things and
[1:32:12] an evil man out of the evil Treasure of
[1:32:14] his heart bringeth forth evil things but
[1:32:17] I say unto you that Every Idle word that
[1:32:20] men shall speak they shall give an
[1:32:23] account thereof at the day of judgment
[1:32:25] for by thy words Thou shalt be justified
[1:32:28] and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned
[1:32:32] amen
[1:32:34] how many beliefs it's very important the
[1:32:37] things that we speak
[1:32:39] the things that we say
[1:32:42] every word not notice Every Idle Word so
[1:32:46] now I got to thinking of how that every
[1:32:48] time that you did something that you
[1:32:50] shouldn't do every time that you have
[1:32:53] said something that you shouldn't say
[1:32:55] remember all of that is going to be
[1:32:57] played back and it's all got to be so to
[1:33:00] speak straightened out
[1:33:05] if not here over there
[1:33:11] huh if not here
[1:33:13] over there
[1:33:15] every every word that you have spoken
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:20] everything you've said
[1:33:22] and how many beliefs even your thoughts
[1:33:25] even your thoughts
[1:33:27] people think well God's is going to
[1:33:29] judge them for this big thing and that
[1:33:31] big thing and then no he's going to go
[1:33:33] into every detail of their life every
[1:33:35] thought they've ever had
[1:33:37] everything they've ever said everything
[1:33:39] they've ever done
[1:33:40] is going to say look at that look at
[1:33:42] that look at that look at that I thought
[1:33:43] boy oh boy Thomas Byler you gotta better
[1:33:46] make sure you've got things right
[1:33:48] I'm at least it's important to get
[1:33:50] things under the blood
[1:33:53] get things under the blood of Jesus
[1:33:57] Christ
[1:33:58] and when they're under the blood folks
[1:34:00] remember when something's under the
[1:34:01] blood if you bring it up I bring it up
[1:34:04] you are guilty of whatever that sin is
[1:34:08] that's the only way that you can live
[1:34:10] righteous and holy before God is get
[1:34:13] whatever it is under the blood
[1:34:15] in the sea of his forgetfulness and I'm
[1:34:18] so glad that I can cast my sins on him
[1:34:21] and Lord all my sins and all my failures
[1:34:24] anything I've ever said wrong Lord
[1:34:26] anything I've ever said to spoken to
[1:34:29] somebody
[1:34:33] because I've spoken things that I regret
[1:34:35] speaking amen
[1:34:37] I have to look back and I said I should
[1:34:38] have said that different
[1:34:41] amen now this is going to get a little
[1:34:43] touchy is that okay
[1:34:46] but a lot of times people will do things
[1:34:49] that that we don't like
[1:34:53] and if somebody crosses us
[1:34:55] amen all of a sudden we decide we have a
[1:34:58] boycott that person I ain't gonna do
[1:35:00] nothing for that guy anymore
[1:35:03] huh now let me ask you I don't know if
[1:35:05] you ever have hopefully not but has that
[1:35:08] feeling has that ever been
[1:35:10] right
[1:35:17] no not because Jesus says you know even
[1:35:20] if people persecute you and despitefully
[1:35:22] you do good to those that die look for
[1:35:25] something that you can do good
[1:35:28] amen
[1:35:32] why because that's what Christ would do
[1:35:36] that's still that self that has to die I
[1:35:39] may believe that that shows you that
[1:35:41] you're still alive you didn't find the
[1:35:44] right thought you didn't find the right
[1:35:46] path to walk
[1:35:48] amen
[1:35:50] anytime you've gossiped
[1:35:54] it'll have to be a given account for
[1:35:57] amen
[1:36:01] isn't that something let me tell you
[1:36:03] something I believe this church we need
[1:36:05] to be above gossip
[1:36:09] I was thinking about that how that
[1:36:11] gossip gossip is literally it's absolute
[1:36:14] poison
[1:36:16] those poison acids of malice and all the
[1:36:19] little things it's poison
[1:36:21] and I wanted you to know that I as a
[1:36:24] pastor have watched people drink that
[1:36:25] poison and there's many of them that are
[1:36:27] out in the world now they're gone
[1:36:31] poison
[1:36:33] gossip
[1:36:36] what's gossip gossip is when I talk to
[1:36:38] you about so and so now did you know by
[1:36:40] the as soon as somebody says you know so
[1:36:42] and so you better put a red flag up
[1:36:45] watch out this is either God or it's the
[1:36:47] devil
[1:36:48] amen
[1:36:51] and if I talk about the brother or
[1:36:52] sister because here we're brothers and
[1:36:54] sisters how many believe that we got to
[1:36:55] keep the devil out we don't ever have to
[1:36:57] deal with that mess and if you talk bad
[1:36:59] about people you should give an account
[1:37:01] you should apologize you should make it
[1:37:03] right
[1:37:05] how many believe that
[1:37:07] that's right
[1:37:09] amen but a lot of time let me tell you
[1:37:11] sometimes we think that we're this
[1:37:12] person ought to make about remember if
[1:37:14] you do the same thing you're a hypocrite
[1:37:17] you make sure you haven't done that same
[1:37:19] thing
[1:37:21] yeah that's right we gotta all we all
[1:37:23] stand before the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:37:26] when I sit and I listen I say words very
[1:37:30] important listen Bible says what uh how
[1:37:33] did I want to put this
[1:37:35] amen
[1:37:37] um
[1:37:40] what do you say
[1:37:43] to somebody or about somebody if you
[1:37:45] can't say something good
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:50] that's the correct answer
[1:37:52] if you can't say something good about
[1:37:53] something don't say nothing at all
[1:37:55] it's good it's okay to talk about people
[1:37:58] if it's good
[1:38:00] but if it's bad remember that's not God
[1:38:03] it's not God at all that's sowing seeds
[1:38:06] of Discord
[1:38:07] amen sowing seeds of Discord
[1:38:10] I've been guilty of it we probably all
[1:38:12] have
[1:38:13] say anything to be ought to have said
[1:38:16] Amen brother listen it better be
[1:38:19] especially about but the pastor and so
[1:38:21] forth you're going to speak and make
[1:38:22] that person have less confidence in that
[1:38:25] Pastor you remember you'll give account
[1:38:27] for it on the day of judgment
[1:38:29] because you might as well have gotten a
[1:38:31] shotgun and shot the man in the back
[1:38:34] by killing his influence and making
[1:38:36] other people think less of him
[1:38:38] amen and I feel like that goes for every
[1:38:40] one of us
[1:38:42] whether it's me you or you me or
[1:38:43] whatever anytime you talk negative and
[1:38:46] here at evening like Tabernacle we don't
[1:38:48] want to talk negative about each other
[1:38:49] we lift each other up and we say
[1:38:51] positive things and if anybody does
[1:38:53] other than that
[1:38:54] shut him down
[1:38:57] shut her down whoever it is shut me down
[1:39:00] hello and I'll tell you it'll stop that
[1:39:03] acid it'll stop the devil in these
[1:39:05] tracks
[1:39:08] because I'll tell you what I know I know
[1:39:10] what it's like I know what it's like to
[1:39:11] have and you know you remember when Paul
[1:39:14] said one place I wanted to pull this up
[1:39:16] Paul says you know if some of you burn
[1:39:17] and some of you are hurting I more
[1:39:21] amen this and I thought you know some of
[1:39:23] us feel like you know maybe we're hurt
[1:39:25] folks I'm telling you what you multiply
[1:39:29] that by 10 whatever you have ever
[1:39:30] experienced you multiply that by 10 or
[1:39:33] more
[1:39:33] that's what this guy goes through
[1:39:35] because I care about every one of
[1:39:37] y'all's feelings your affections and
[1:39:39] everything else and have to deal with it
[1:39:41] any family that's ever come and has it
[1:39:44] gone it's heartbreak for me anything
[1:39:46] I've ever tried to straighten up and
[1:39:48] couldn't be you don't know how I'm
[1:39:49] heartbroken that makes me hello you talk
[1:39:53] about heartbreak yeah I know heartbreak
[1:39:55] but I know one thing I can't hold
[1:39:57] anything I don't hold anything I cast
[1:39:59] all my carriers on the Lord
[1:40:03] because even brother Bynum because hurt
[1:40:04] so many sometimes remember whatever
[1:40:06] unless you don't know he's been cut deep
[1:40:09] many times
[1:40:11] we all get cut deep by each other
[1:40:15] amen but do we let that infest sucks no
[1:40:18] we let the blood of Jesus Christ take
[1:40:20] that and heal us cast all your cares
[1:40:23] upon Him for he careth for you
[1:40:27] amen I have you know I have I don't want
[1:40:30] it too personal but somebody's not
[1:40:32] coming here anymore and I was kind of
[1:40:33] that way look if they're going to do
[1:40:35] that and so forth and uh you know then
[1:40:37] I'm just gonna not gonna have nothing to
[1:40:38] do with him
[1:40:40] what the holy spirit says that's not the
[1:40:41] right attitude
[1:40:43] you should try to do something that
[1:40:45] would make them really feel of you as a
[1:40:47] Christian and do something good if you
[1:40:49] possibly can how many believes there's a
[1:40:51] wrong thought and a wrong attitude and
[1:40:52] there's a right attitude to things
[1:40:56] amen now I'm here to tell you this right
[1:40:59] now the differences between God using
[1:41:01] you and the devil using you
[1:41:03] to get it right amen this means God's
[1:41:06] going to use you it's going to mean that
[1:41:08] little things that you go through amen
[1:41:10] it's going to mold the character of
[1:41:12] Christ in you amen
[1:41:16] mistreat you that's Christ amen
[1:41:21] but our carnal nature he doesn't want to
[1:41:23] do that it's hard but it takes prayer
[1:41:25] and it takes casting all your cares
[1:41:28] upon him for he careth for you
[1:41:32] you love him
[1:41:34] so remember brother and sister say good
[1:41:37] things about one another because I feel
[1:41:39] like this I feel like I feel like the
[1:41:41] Lord has brought us up he's he's brought
[1:41:44] us up
[1:41:47] the devil wants us to be at the bottom
[1:41:49] of the ladder he don't want us up here
[1:41:51] the devil wants us down here admiring in
[1:41:53] the muck we're beyond that we're past
[1:41:55] that how many is with me
[1:41:58] we're past juvenile
[1:42:00] we're past brother Glenn we're past
[1:42:03] being children having to be taught how
[1:42:06] to talk
[1:42:12] because remember two-year-olds they have
[1:42:15] to be taught how to talk
[1:42:18] amen and we should be past that you
[1:42:20] ain't got to tell me brother Bible I
[1:42:21] know I need to keep my shot mouth shut
[1:42:23] unless he's good don't say nothing at
[1:42:25] all
[1:42:26] that's learning how to talk
[1:42:28] why because words man I'll tell you what
[1:42:31] the devil is in those words remember the
[1:42:33] devil was in speaking to Eve and he can
[1:42:36] paint you such a purdy picture
[1:42:39] amen but remember as the prophet of God
[1:42:42] said if it ain't right it's the devil

[1:42:47] wrong listen do you realize that you're
[1:42:50] you know you know the past or deacons
[1:42:54] are supposed to take care of the the
[1:42:55] elderly and so forth he says but who
[1:42:58] wants the pastor to do what's his
[1:43:00] responsibility over the spiritual part
[1:43:03] of the church
[1:43:06] in other words if there's something
[1:43:07] wrong that's on him

[1:43:11] that amen
