And my you know, today's a very important day. It's a national holiday. Brother John Wade's birthday. How old are you, Brother John? &gt;&gt; 55. &gt;&gt; 5. Oh, he's double nickels. He's a young guy. My He's young. I didn't know he was that young, Brother John. God bless you. Let's give Brother John a hand. Amen. And you know, I I really appreciate him. They they drive a long ways and several of you do. And you know, I have a rough trip. It's about four minutes and it's hard for me sometimes, but God bless you all that you make such a great big sacrifice and and you know, uh, the Lord just knew I I needed to be close. That's all I can say. But we got mom had her procedure done today and she's doing good. And other than them being about four hours later than they were supposed to to do it, but everything went well. And and uh they of course at mom's young age, they were worried that she might not wake up. But you know, as I told them before, we don't worry about things like that because I believe that we're in God's hands. And when it's our time to go, whether we're walking, talking, or we're sleeping, we're going to go. But I believe that he's got us in his hands. You know, we sing that song. He's got the whole world in his hands. And I believe he's got me in his hands. You believe he's got you in his hands? And I got one more testimony. There's a lady in our in the church there at Christian Tabernacle in Arkansas, and Sister Mner Alexander. Uh, I've known her my whole life and she's the one that said that I would be in prison by the time I was 20 because I was so mean. About a year and a half ago, she developed bleeding. She was just bleeding profusely. They had to go in and do surgery on her. Well, Thursday night, it started again. The cat come scratching at the door. So they rushed her to the emergency room and in and hing out there where we used to live and and so they transferred her to Jonesboro and and they was trying she it was just wasn't looking very good and and so they done surgery on her the next day and and when the surgeon got in there, you know what he told her? He said, "You healed yourself. There's not one drop of blood on the inside of your body." &gt;&gt; She healed herself. I said, 'Yeah, the great physician come by. Amen. And give her healing in her body. And Amen. She's in her She's in her 80s and but God is a healer tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I, you know, I just I I think of what brother Donnie Reagan said. He called him said, "You poor old dumb devil. Every time I take my medicine, I say one of these days I'm going to be healed. I'm claiming what God's done for me. What can wash away my sins? Nothing but the blood. What's give us healing? The blood of Jesus Christ tonight. The song's been on my heart all day. Well, what can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood, Jesus. Oh, and what can make me whole again? Oh, nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Brother Tom don't feel good tonight. So, we're going to stand tonight and we're all going to pray for Brother Thomas before he comes out. Let's stand tonight.

If we truly believe that all things are possible. Amen. Ain't that a nice place to be? &gt;&gt; Amen. Nice position to be in to be at a place to where we can believe that the God that you serve, with him all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible. Wow. Right. &gt;&gt; Nothing's impossible. &gt;&gt; Well, that ought to get us excited right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be back. Amen. Had a good trip. Unfortunately, I think some of us caught some kind of a bug. I don't know just what it is, but it don't seem to be too bad, but Amen. So, uh just a little bit of chest congestion and and so forth, but Amen. Not enough to keep me down. Praise the Lord. We're going to get up and keep going. So, God bless everybody for coming out tonight. Amen. God bless you. We had a good trip. Amen. So, if you will, we'll just get into the word this this evening. Amen. I was just in my office this afternoon and really kind of just uh trying hard. Lord, give me something. Give me something. you know, and uh I had some thoughts that I had a little bit few hours before and I just kind of didn't know about all that, you know, didn't just didn't think about it. And then I begin to think about those thoughts again and and then it begin to kind of come and I says, "Well, Lord, maybe that's what you wanted." Amen. Amen. So, Lord, help me to be able to listen to your voice. Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads before we read his word. Dear kind heavenly father, we Lord thank you Lord Jesus. Father to be gathered here with your children, the purchased of your blood, Father, that which you went to Calvary for, all the suffering that you went through, Lord Jesus, the price that you paid, the physical agony, the spiritual agony that you went through, Lord, for the people that are before me, Lord. And as the prophet has said, if I had a drop of blood, drop of your blood, how precious that would be in that vessel. But you said, "I have something even more precious than that before me." And that is the purchase of what that blood did, what that blood purchased, Father. And we thank you, Lord, for every soul that is here, Lord. And for those who love you, love you enough to come out on a Wednesday night, Lord. Lay aside their work, lay aside their busy schedule and the things of the world to come into your house to listen to what you have to say to us, Lord. We believe, Father, that you'll speak to our hearts tonight, Lord, through your word. Give me strength, Lord. And bless me, Lord Jesus, and give me the gift, so to speak, as the prophet put it, the real gift is to be able to get yourself out of the way, Lord. This is so true. So help me, Lord, to get out of the way and just let you have your way, Father, tonight. And bless the bleeding of the word, the meditation of our heart. For we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Amen. All right. Go ahead and put that title up if you will. Amen. I want to talk about being occupied. Occupied. And it's actually kind of different because uh I don't really even have a word, amen, to pull out of the scriptures, but we'll try to explain a little bit. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the first one we want to go to is John 6 and St. John 6. So, I thought, well, we'll just do a little Sunday school lesson today. Just a little teaching maybe. Amen. All right. St. John 6, Brother David Gadman will be with us this coming weekend. Amen. Our first Sunday of the month. Hadn't had brother David in a while. And so, Amen. We're looking forward to Amen. to hearing him minister. Amen. This weekend. All right. John 6. Yeah. Okay. Thought I had the wrong one. It is the spirit. Oh, 63. Did I tell you 63? &gt;&gt; All right. Now it's up there. Okay. Well, it got me again. All right. That's right. It's right there. It's on your coat. Right. All right. It is the spirit that quickenth. The flesh profitth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. Amen. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. Amen. You can be seated. That's a scripture that came to me and I was beginning to think of how brother Bam talked about how that spirits travel with words. Ain't that right? Amen. Words carry spirits. That's what we want to talk about for a while with the help of the Lord. And and also uh there's another scripture I'm going to go ahead and read just to kind of lay a foundation. Jesus said, "When a strong man armed keepeth his his palace, his goods are in peace. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him, he taketh from him all of his armor, wherein he trustth and divideth his spoils. He that is not with me is against me, and he that gatherth not with me scatterth." Amen. When the unclean spirit of a is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none, he saith, I will return to my house, whence I came out. And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. Amen. So one thing we want to speak on a little bit with the help of the Lord is also along with this other is how that how that u you can be saved, you can be sanctified, you can even be filled with the Holy Ghost, but the devil will always bombard you. He will always come at you as long as we're in this life. Ain't that right? And we're living in an age when there the devil has many many weapons that are formed against us. &gt;&gt; He has so many tricks up the sleeve that it's not even funny. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, but the first thing I want to talk about first of all is uh avenues. Amen. Avenues by which uh the devil comes in. Amen. Amen. and and and how how how important words and the power of words are. Now, I thought about this here and and and where I got this about being occupied. Amen. It says that when he found this house, it was garnished. It was cleaned. It was swept, right? But how many knows it wasn't occupied? Amen. There was nobody there. It was empty. Brother Bam taught that if you don't get the Holy Ghost after being saved and sanctified, Amen. There's nobody there to protect you and he comes back. Amen. And gets you become more evil than what you was before because you've got to have the the Holy Spirit occupying the house. Amen. Guarding the house. How many believe there's a lot of guarding that we've got to do in our age? &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to talk to you about uh I want to talk to you about why people change. Why do people change? Amen. People will be going along just being you know uh so to speak perhaps a Christian and and so forth or or even preachers, message preachers even. Ain't that right? Go along for 20 years preaching the message and all of a sudden something changes. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I wrote down here, I said, "The reason that people change, the reason that we change is because we still haven't gotten to the place that we need to be." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's pretty pretty strong statement, but it's true. Amen. Because we we need to change. Amen. We need to get better. We need to get closer to God. But I'll go ahead and say it while we're on it. Amen. Kind of getting ahead of myself, but h how um how many knows? Can somebody tell me what he said? what brother banham said about orman Neville. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. He said no matter coming or going, he said he never changes. He's he's always the same. You know, and me and my wife driving back from our our trip, we was listening to a message. I'm not sure which one it was anymore, but he had or brother Orman Orman Neville come up and to pray. And you talk about a prayer. My I wish I could pray like that. &gt;&gt; I thought, "Wow." I mean, he went on for a good little while and he was just my it was just a prayer now. And and you could see why Brother Brandham wanted brother Orman Neville for the pastor. I mean, it was he kept him in there many times because he knew what brother Brand what Brother Orman Neville was. Amen. But you know, it's the devil's business, isn't it? And this is this is going to really talk about uh a stability. Amen. Because Amen. We're starting we we're running in this race. Ain't that right? Amen. And I want everybody here to be stable. &gt;&gt; I want you to get to the place to where you don't have to change. And I know we're going to have to change probably a little bit all the way till we go to rapture. But you shouldn't be up and down and in and out and uh you know all of that, right? Brother Bam talked about that a lot of times because people haven't gone far enough. They're just justified or sanctified and and so they're still very unstable. They're still uh you know they're they're still uh um affected by the weather by a different weather that comes along. Amen. And for example, Amen. when somebody says something bad about you. Amen. A lot of people can't handle that. We say, "Well, you know, words can't hurt me. Six and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me. And we realize, well, I hope that you're at that place. Congratulation. That's very nice. I'm glad you're at that place. I hope that I am. Amen. Why? So to where I could, well, that person said this about you. And how many knows that is one of the biggest tricks of the devil a lot of times is for somebody to go tell somebody else something somebody said about them. Right. &gt;&gt; That's very nasty. That's very dirty. That's that that's can be very demonic because you're sowing discord. &gt;&gt; You're bringing bitterness towards those people. And and so and we realize that our tongue is a world of fire. And this is what James said. Amen. Behold how great a fire little fire kindleth. It's like a match. Amen. And you just light that little bit and you just say a little something and funny. I'm here to tell you it can split a whole church. It can divide families. It can split up friendships. It can all kinds of things. So, well, how many knows that words are powerful? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Words are powerful. Amen. And spirits not only not only with words, but thoughts are powerful. &gt;&gt; How many know words? Of course, a word is a thought expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And I believe it was brother Bam said that Eve before she ever fell, before she ever had a relationship with that serpent, Amen. she first had to open up her what? &gt;&gt; The womb of her mind, in other words, the thoughts, the words that she was hearing, she had to open that up. &gt;&gt; Amen. And how many knows the second that that uh uh the serpent said, "Thou shalt not surely die." Now, there was a spirit. And brother Bam said, "The most horrible spirit that there is is a spirit of unbelief." &gt;&gt; Amen. A spirit of unbelief. I mean, come on, folks. How How about it? He really got us into a lot of trouble by her spirit of unbelief, didn't she? &gt;&gt; It caused a lot of problems and so will it to anybody that when you allow unbelief to come into your life, you're in for a world of of of terrible things. Amen. And before we go too far, let's just say this. And I like to take the opposite a lot of times here. It says, "The words that I speak to you, they are spirit and they are life." Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So he says this Bible, Amen. these words here are spirit. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are spirit and they are life. But they it does have to go into the right kind of ground into the right heart &gt;&gt; and that but they're alive. Amen. God God said, "My word goes forth. It will not come back to me void." Amen. &gt;&gt; It's powerful. Their spirit and their life. Amen. And &gt;&gt; well, maybe I should. What the hell? Go ahead and say it, you know, and and well, I'll wait. Amen. I'll get this thing all messed up. But anyway, Eve, Eve, back to Eve. Thinking about when Eve when the first things, you know, and I want to go back further yet. Let's go on back. Let's go back. You know, when the devil was still in heaven, all the way back when devil was still in heaven. What did he say? Thou has set in thine heart. &gt;&gt; In other words, it began with thoughts that the devil had, I would be like the most high. I will do this, that, or the other. And let's admit it. Any job that you have, any objective that you have, the first place that it comes to is in your mind. You might not tell your wife, you might not tell your family. You might not tell nobody, but you're going to have a plan. And that plan is in your mind. And that's the way it is with the devil. He just his thoughts got him into a lot of trouble. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Just those thoughts. I want to be like him. Amen. Let me say again with Eve it was thou shalt not surely die. The second that she received that word and believed that she wouldn't really die. She doubted the word of God. How many know that was it? She had fallen right then and there. Long before she was cursed, long before God come along, she had already fallen. &gt;&gt; The second that she opened the womb of her mind. See that? How many knows that's one of the main channels that the devil comes into our mind. Amen. Comes up into the womb of our mind. And so, Amen. That's where the great battle is. And that's how a lot of times how the devil gets into or back into the house. &gt;&gt; Cuz we want our house, we want our house to be protected. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the goodman of the house, if he's stronger, how many knows you've got to be stronger than the one that's coming after you? How can you ever be stronger than the devil if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost? But the Bible says you don't stand a chance against the devil without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You got to have the goodman of the house. You got to have that Holy Spirit there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To guard because it mean if you don't if you don't have the Holy Ghost, Bible says greater is he that is in you &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; So it's important to have that baptism of the Holy Ghost in your heart. Amen. And then faith also, brother Brandon many times talked about faith being that goodman. He said that whenever people get healed all the time, people come in meetings, get healed. Amen. And a week later, week later, they're worse than they were to begin with. Why? Because went out there, he said they went out there and they got sicker because the thing died or whatever. You know how he explains it. Amen. And they got sicker. And he says just as faith that killed that thing, unbelief will resurrect it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. ended up saying to that person's twice as worse as what it is was before. Amen. Amen. So we see that on the one side God his word they are spirit and they are life. They're powerful. Every thought every word comes from somewhere. Amen. And so on the other side of the coin so to speak, Amen. The devil's words are powerful. &gt;&gt; How many believes the devil's words are powerful? The devil's thoughts are powerful, &gt;&gt; they're not as powerful as God's, &gt;&gt; but they're powerful enough that people get to taken out and believing his word. All creation fell because of it. It was powerful enough to get all of humanity in the condition that we're in. Every ambulance, everything that ever happened was because of the unbelief that he brought that that evil spirit. How many believes it was an evil spirit &gt;&gt; that come into Eve? &gt;&gt; When she received that, she received that evil spirit &gt;&gt; of I maybe you're right. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're right. &gt;&gt; That's what it took. Brother Bam said in a church, and I don't I like to preach on this. in a church. Oh, somebody will go through the church and say, "Well, this ain't right and that ain't right." Hello. Be careful. He said, "Because why? Those are words. If you listen," And he also said, "If you just listen to gossip, &gt;&gt; what will the Holy Spirit do? &gt;&gt; It will take its flight if you just listen to it." Now, you might listen to it and say, "Now, brother, let's pray about it." &gt;&gt; Huh? And you might try to do that. But if you believe it and you accept it, you're going to have the same bitterness. You're going to have the same attitude that that person has. &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil has a lot of ways to bring evil spirits upon us. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows that uh uh just that type of just those words, just those words of saying something bad about somebody. Amen. It'll it'll it'll bring an infraction. Amen. There's a spirit that comes with it. Amen. Proverbs 18 and 21 it says death and life are in the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; In the power of the tongue life and death. Ma Yeah, excuse me. In Matthew 12:36, I say unto you that every idle word that a man shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. Hallelujah. Remember we preached on you're your own judge. God don't judge you. Brother Bam says your own judge. You decide whether you want to go to heaven or hell. It's whether you accept God's word or whether you're going to doubt God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And whatever you confess with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. So by thy words, Amen. You'll either be saved or be condemned. You'll either say what God said. How many believe that that's actually what's going to save you? If you'll if you'll confess with your mouth, hey, the Lord Jesus died on Calvary. it. I think Romans 7 or 8 there, Paul said, "For if we believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again and that God raised him up, amen, we shall be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto salvation, then with the mouth confession it's made unto salvation." Something like that. A little rough there, but anyway. Amen. So, it's got to be a confession of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why brother Abraham said never let a negative thought go through your mind. I mean he believes you got to watch every thought that go through your mind &gt;&gt; because the way that most of the time before you do something that thought will come in. I don't care what it is. I don't care if it's lust. I don't care if it's jealousy. I don't care if it's hatred. I don't care if it's bitterness. I don't care if it's unforgiveness. All those things are thoughts that come into your mind. a lot of times hurts and pains and wrongdoings and saying something wrong. Amen. I remember preaching something uh uh uh you know something about being led by the Holy Spirit and saying nice things. Amen. And went right after church went out there and embarrassed myself. Amen. Saying something to you. Amen. What I said to you, sister. Amen. And it was just, you know, I was like, man, can't I say anything right? But how many knows how many of you how many of you have ever done that? You say something, "Man, I wish I would have said that." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's because we're human yet, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Sure. But it's very, very important. You tell your children the wrong thing. You tell them, "Amen. You ain't no good. You'll never amount to anything." You're really sewing a seed that you ought to be sewing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. What was it, Jehoshaphat? And I wanted to go read that letter, but I didn't get to studying on it. But how many knows Jehoshaphat? And I'm not sure which king it was, but it was an enemy that had conquered everybody else. He sent Jehoshaphat a letter saying, "Don't you think that you're going to trust in God now?" now all these other guys trusted in their God. Ain't that right? And they were they weren't able to deliver him. And neither is your God going to deliver him. So just surrender. Ain't that right? But he went into prayer. Ain't that right? He went to prayer. Amen. And God spoke to him. Amen. And that whole army ended up being defeated. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he didn't take he didn't take what that what we would call letter of intimidation. That's what it was. It was a letter of intimidation. And that's what the devil does to every one of us if we aren't careful. He tries to intimidate you. &gt;&gt; Amen. With thoughts that are not according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. So, let's let's look a little bit just for a few minutes in Numbers 13. It says uh uh you know, when they were when they were given the commission, uh I think a man out of each tribe, they were commissioned to go into the promised land and to spy out the land. Go spy the land out. Come back. Amen. and tell us what what's going going on. And they of course brought grapes like you wouldn't believe. And notice and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel. This is in numbers 13 and verse 26. Amen. And the wilderness of Pyan Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land. And they told him and said, "We came into the land where the thou has sent us, and surely it flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it." Wow, that was very positive. It's good, wasn't it? Nevertheless, uh-oh. Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and very great. And moreover, we saw the ch children of Anoch there, giants. &gt;&gt; I wrote down here what we're facing. You and I, Amen, we fight, we we we face giants. Amen. That the uh medical world says won't be healed, can't be healed, cancer, diabetes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's one of the first things that when I found out that, you know, that uh you know, well, I don't want to say I had it, but anyway, the doctor said that I had it. Diabetes, somebody said, "No, that'll never be healed." Amen. Amen. That's something never healed. That's a giant. &gt;&gt; Big, mean, and ugly. Hello. Amen. That you know, and and and big giants were in the law. We saw there the children of Anoch. Whether it's high blood pressure, maybe cancer, and the Amalachite dwell Amalachites dwell in the land of the south, the Hittites, and the Jebusites, the Ammonites dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanites dwell in by the sea and by the coast of Jordan. Amen. But Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And possess it, for we are able to overcome it. We are well able to overcome it. &gt;&gt; How many likes to confession like that? Amen. And I want to say tonight, this layout is age when the devil has got every gun that he's ever accumulated in 6,000 years. Every bit of his smarts, everything that he has, Amen, he's throwing it at you, he's throwing at me. But guess what? Amen. We're not going to go down with that thing. We're going to well overcome it. We're more than able to overcome it. We're able, oh my, we're more than able to come overcome lukewarmness and formality. Amen. just some church entity. &gt;&gt; We Oh my I believe that we can live the literal life of Jesus Christ. Amen. The way that the prophet said that we had to have in order to go to rapture. &gt;&gt; It will take the literal life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not just some formalism, &gt;&gt; but we're more than able. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm going to just say it where it comes to mind. We've come a long way, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've come a long way. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're going to go further. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that we're going to go further and we're going to keep going and we're going to keep going. We're not going to stop. We're not going to have a certain plateau. We're going to go till we get out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to go all the way to the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Not just partial, not just a halfway. &gt;&gt; Not a halfway Christian life. No, that's not going to do for us. &gt;&gt; Got to be a complete surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, let's look at this report. Amen. One guy says, "Let's go up with one." But the men that went up with him said, "We be not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we." And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched out in the children of Israel, saying, "The land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature." And there we saw the giants, the son of Anoch, which came to which come of the giants, and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers. &gt;&gt; And in so were we in their sight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, I believe that we need a certain amount of self-confidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not I should not say self, but a certain amount of confidence about oursel. &gt;&gt; Amen. Self-confidence would be confidence in yourself. But we have confidence in what we are &gt;&gt; and who we are. We've got confidence in the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; When David went to Goliath, he didn't think I'm a little grasshopper. He said, "No, you big giant. You know, the bigger they are, the harder they fall." &gt;&gt; Amen. I read in the Bible the other day, Brother Brad, I've always had that giant getting hit and then hit falling backwards. I had it wrong. I read it the other day and it said he fell on his face. &gt;&gt; That's right. fell on his face. I wonder how many tonight have had giants in your life and you saw them fall on your face. Fall on their face. Depression fall on your face. Cancer fall on your face. High blood pressure fall on your face. Lukewarmness fall on your face. &gt;&gt; Amen. Emptiness fall on your face. Robbing my joy fall on your face. Robbing my peace fall on your face. anything that takes away and robs you. &gt;&gt; Amen. In their own eyes, they were as grasshoppers because I'm here to tell you, they should have thought of it as David did. You know, we're more than able. Amen. Caleb stilled the people. Oh boy. I'll tell you what, no doubt. But he wanted to probably tell him, "Hey, y'all y'all need to shut up." &gt;&gt; That's right. Quit with your negative talk. There ain't a one of us sitting here that should not be able to over any kind of a issue or problem that comes ahead of you that you face tomorrow. Any trial that you face, anything that you face tomorrow. Hello. Are you with me now? Amen. Amen. Because why? Because what? Look at what God has done. Look at what God has done in your past. Amen. All you got to do is have faith that that same God. Amen. He's going to take care of you in the future. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we shouldn't be doubters. Well, he saved us there. He brought us out of Egypt to give us water. He gave us food. Amen. He opened the Red Sea. But now we're whiners. There's giants over there. We can't do it. I'm here to tell you something tonight. Now, people listening out there, because of their statement there, they did not go in and God rejected them. Amen. They're going to hell. They're eternally lost. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. They came to Katis Barnea and they doubted for the last time. My God took them out and they all wandered in the wilderness and they all died off and their children went in. &gt;&gt; But and Jesus said they're everyone dead. &gt;&gt; God doesn't take kindly to unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when we cry, when we doubt, don't fear, don't fret, don't be dismayed. How many know the devil tries to bring fear on us? He tries to scare the liver out of. But the Bible says, "Take courage and don't be dismayed." &gt;&gt; There's thoughts, amen, that come just like these people. They were dismayed. When those people gave that report, they were dismayed. They were discouraged. I wrote down here that it turned their courage and it melted it down. &gt;&gt; It melted their courage. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as when David cut the head off of Goliath, ain't that right? And they were scared. They had been melted down into their foxholes. They were scared of that Goliath. But when the little old David come out there and took his head off, come on you men. I thought you guys were big guys. I'm a little guy and I took his head off. How about getting up out of there and killing a few yourself? &gt;&gt; You know how many men got courage and how the giants and others killed because David's faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as their courage was, you know, became greater because Amen. of what was done, so because of these men's words, they were dismayed and disheartened and discouraged. Amen. The doctor says, "You've got high blood pressure, &gt;&gt; you've got diabetes, you've got cancer. You're going to die of cancer if you don't aren't careful. You'll be dismayed." &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But we're not to do that. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; We're to take courage. Be of courage. Be very courageous. He told Joshua, "The land's ours. We're more than able. &gt;&gt; How many believe we're more than able to overcome anything the devil throws at us? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, never let a negative thought come into your mind because those negative thoughts will bring all kinds of things. I call a these negative thoughts, they are a a cesspool. Amen. Hurts, wrongs, feelings. Amen. They bring evil spirits and bitterness. That's where the devil comes in a lot of times. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unforgiveness is a place of cesspool for hatred, revenge, murder. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Unforgiveness. Why you think the Bible said so much that you got to forgive one another? &gt;&gt; As we walk along here, you got to forgive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, it makes an opening. It's a window that the devil comes in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My my my praise the Lord. Amen. Question. What is it? What is it that defeats the devil any place, anytime? &gt;&gt; It's the word of God in it. &gt;&gt; But man makes a statement paraphrasing. The word of God will defeat the devil anytime, any place, under any circumstances. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily gifts, &gt;&gt; not emotion. &gt;&gt; No, but faith in the word. You've got to speak it. &gt;&gt; Give him the word. Brother Brandom, I did a search and he says, "Boo the devil. If the devil boos, boo him back." And how do we boo him? He said, "How do we do him? How do we boo him?" By quoting him the word. &gt;&gt; See, it's nowhere in the Bible. Just boo. &gt;&gt; Hello. But that boo is in you applying the word like Jesus did. &gt;&gt; He said, "Man, if you're Christ, you know, make these stones into bread." Boo, devil. The word says, amen, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. And he got his feather sins, folks. &gt;&gt; You apply the word. You give him the word and it will defeat him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's so important that we apply the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So much so that before God can heal you cuz he's the high priest up there now of what? He's the high priest of our profession. Brother Bam said profession confession is the same thing. In other words, before God can heal you before he can deliver you, do anything for you, you've got to confess that he's already done it. &gt;&gt; You got to believe that he's already done it. Even so, it's so crazy to think that better bannon would say if Jesus was right here, he couldn't do no more for you than what he's already done. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. He was here in my suit. If he's here in my suit, he can do nothing until first you accept what he done already. How many is glad that you can accept what he has done already? By his stripes, I am healed by his word. I am saved by his word. I am forgiven. I am justified. I am sanctified. I am glorified. His word said it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. That gives the devil a black eye. The power of confession. Faith confession. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing is powerful. Brother Bram says, and I I had I had had one quote and I didn't bring it out. This is one of the rare times I only have one quote out here, but he's talking about the atom, the atomic bomb, and greatest battle ever fought. He's talking about how that the word Amen. will how Let me think now. Wished I had it. That's why he says that thing that that atomic bomb. Amen. Faith in the word of God is like the atomic bomb. It annihilates, disintegrates, casts out, &gt;&gt; keeps out, keep the devil out of your house. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? It completely eradicates him. That power of that word in you speaking &gt;&gt; keeps him out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Part of the reason was I begin to think about this, I thought, you know, we're living in an unstable world. Brother Brandham was living in a world where the Christian world the people that he knew he even had to preach a couple message called why are the people so tossed about ain't that right amen and different ones and he was mentioned say some of them are in the justified state some are sanctified state why why can't people keep the victory and so forth you know because they hadn't gone far enough with God &gt;&gt; why can't they be stable why do why do why are they so movable why do people move so much Why do people go here and there all the time? Cast to and fro. Amen. I think as brother Bradam mentioned here, if everybody that has come to this church would still be here, the balcony was be full. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; But what is it? Something happened. &gt;&gt; Something happens with people. I think about brother Josh, Leah, Devin, and Jana. I think about those who have come here few years ago. I really wouldn't expected you to stay very long. &gt;&gt; Why? Because people would come and go just like that. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was still too much unbelief around. That's right. &gt;&gt; People were not anchored. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; It's almost for a pastor, it's discouraging. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is wrong? Oh, you know, I don't care what you say about this church or me. I know where I stand. &gt;&gt; I know what God has done for this church. It ain't what I've done with this church. This is what God has done with this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want. We want God in it. God gets the glory. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, no weapon formed against God's church will stand. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's unstable people. People ain't got no anchor. People ain't got the Holy Ghost down into soul that let thoughts come in, jealousy come in, pride come in, &gt;&gt; all kinds of things and rule them. &gt;&gt; It's all carnality. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not godly. It's sulfuric acid. Lord, thank I thank God for stable people. &gt;&gt; I thank God that he's caused us to be stable. &gt;&gt; Amen. And people that can control their tongue, &gt;&gt; people that control their hearts, people that control their minds, and what thoughts they allow to come in. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's where it all starts. Comes into the mind, goes from here, goes to there. And I will, as a pastor, I will constantly hammer on people saying stuff they oughtn't say. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doing things they oughtn't do because I know where it gets us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to be a humble, simple Christian church. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I thank God for his goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. today. Can I have a little more time? &gt;&gt; Talk about avenues by which the devil comes in and brings spirits in. We know that brother Brandon preached against the television because we know that. Amen. One wrong movie, one wrong word. It's a It's a window. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right for the devil to come in? &gt;&gt; That's right. It was one window. But now look at it. &gt;&gt; We even called it in in our phones and everything to call it Windows. Windows 9, Windows 11, all kinds. It's windows. All you got to tap on that window and you better watch out. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're scrolling, you got to be very careful. I don't care if you're hunting videos and stuff. They'll throw some crap. &gt;&gt; Will throw a little crap in there, baby. They'll throw some trash in there. Ain't that right? Got to watch this window. Oh my. But isn't that right? You got to watch it. That's why you got to watch your children whether they have a phone or not and where they are and whether they're alone or not and all that other stuff. You better watch out. Those spirits will come in quicker than we can shake a stick. &gt;&gt; Amen. Kids, we know all the way back in Elvis Presley and all of that when they begin to come out with those songs. Amen. And those rock and roll songs and those lusty songs. Amen. The world just blew up in lust. Blew up in murders. Blew up in all kinds of stuff. That's where brother Ram says streams of demon powers are coming because of the music that's being played that's being allowed to play the words that are being sung. And now you have people getting ready for Armageddon with all the video games and the killing and the murdering and the bloody splattering desensitizing people. Them kids are becoming desensitized. They can go into a school and shoot them up and have no feelings about it. Why? They practice it on a video game. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think you like that video brother Tommy sent. I think it was on the church said I wa watched that where a little girl Amen. You know, she was on her phone and she had gotten killed because her mom wanted her help her look, you know, and see because it was raining hard and she didn't. She was too busy on her phone and Amen. and so forth and and all the things that Jesus told her about, you know, how girls will get on there and and look at all these models and wish they were like that and they'll feel bad because they're not. Hello. And and and it ends up they end up getting spirits that ought to have depression. They ought to have just by getting on there. &gt;&gt; Why? These are all windows avenues by which the devil comes in. Amen. You take let a woman dress ill fame. Let her dress wrong. What does it if a man don't turn his head and he looks and he thanks, a spirit of lust, boom. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? A spirit of lust will jump on you quicker what you can shake his dick. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you open up your mind, that's why you have to turn your head. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just avenues by which the devil comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Nelly Sanders found out. She found out when she stopped and had a couple thoughts. See, she ought to have thought that said the devil said, "Do you remember?" Sometimes the devil uses our memory. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He uses our memory. We used to dance this, that, or the other. And what happened? What happened with her? She stopped and she entertained the thought and a spirit came on her. And before she knew it, she was out there dancing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And right back out there and a hideous devil, devil demonized bat looking thing got into her. Brother Brandham cast it out and maybe she had a hard time getting it out of the house. Ain't that right? Y'all remember the story? &gt;&gt; Go ahead and laugh a little bit. It's It was funny, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; His brother jumping off the bed and him going in behind and his brother sobered up. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Sobered up, man. That's right. But the point was she allowed that thought to come in. How many we got to guard our thoughts? &gt;&gt; Well, I'm tired. But I don't feel like going tonight. &gt;&gt; Bitter guard your thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. He that is faithful in little things will be faithful in many. &gt;&gt; He's not faithful in little things, how will we be faithful in on many big things? Amen. Amen. So many things. Praise the Lord. That's right. John Ryan, what did he have to do? Didn't feel it. Went back and says, "I ain't healed." And you said I was going to be. Don't you believe me? Yeah, I believe you. All right, then. Go out there and confess it. All he can do say is, "Praise God, I'm healed. Praise God, I'm healed." Amen. If you can't do nothing else, repeat that word over and over and over and over again. Amen. And your body will come subject to it. Doesn't have to be an emotion or a thrill down your back. No, just take that word, believe it. Brother Bam says something's got to happen &gt;&gt; cuz God keeps his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. the thought of what God said. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Legion. How did he get that way? Brother Ram said maybe he came home and had a drink or whatever and his wife asked him if he had a drink. Said, "No, honey. I didn't drink." Huh? What happened? The second he chose not to confess and be honest, a spirit of lying came on him. Ain't that right? The spirit of lion came on him and then another one came on and then another one. Before he knew it, he was out there in that graveyard. How many knows? Listen kids, it's easy. Amen. To take one spirit and then they take a lot of spirits. &gt;&gt; Amen. They multiply. They come in by the droves. Ain't that right? They'll come in by the droves. You just get a little attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. In saying this, I thought about saying this. You might get an attitude towards me. That's right. Because I'm not perfect. Sometimes I say stuff up here that some of you maybe don't like. And maybe I shouldn't say it. Maybe it was my carnal self. But my question is, what kind of attitude do you take towards it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I ain't never coming back. &gt;&gt; I'm leaving here. He ain't got a lick a sense that armies boy, huh? All kinds of things. Just just the attitude. Hello. &gt;&gt; Just a second you take that attitude or you say, "Wow, I'm sure he didn't mean to say that." Or, you know, there's another way of looking at it. Bless him, Lord. &gt;&gt; Huh? So I thought about saying that. So now I said but no matter no matter who it is, no matter what it is, guard your heart. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Guard your heart. How do you guard your heart? By guarding your mind and by guarding your thoughts &gt;&gt; every single day. &gt;&gt; How many knows the internet and all of that stuff? Those are all weapons that are formed against you. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's Oh, it's Oh my. Here we go. I said when I come to this part, I said, "Now preach. Woo. Think about it. Every form." Amen. He has so many weapons against you. But when you got that Holy Ghost, you got to have that Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; to keep him out. &gt;&gt; When you're happy, stay happy. &gt;&gt; When you're stable, stay stable. How many believe that God brings stability in people's lives? &gt;&gt; Not instability. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Every word of God when you think about every word of God is spirit and they are life. Now, in closing, we know that God spoke the word. Ain't that right? Even the prophecy of Revelation is the spoken word. And whatever isn't fulfilled yet will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. Mary was the beneficiary of that. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because it was alive. It was real. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll send you Malachi 4. I'll send you Elijah to prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember this before I go on. It's the devil's business to devalue the word of God. Just like the water baptism, people might say, and I know sure it's not anybody here, people might say, "Well, doesn't really matter how you baptize." I just got one thing to say. Jesus after dying on the cross, going down to hell, fighting with the devil, kicking him around, grabbing the keys of death, hell, and the grave, coming up out of there, making himself visible to the disciples. And one and only commandments that he gives them is to go into all the world. Amen. And baptizing them in the name of the father, son, and the holy ghost, which is Jesus Christ. And you want to say it doesn't matter. Amen. How many knows that's that's a devil talking? &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "If you've been baptized, Amen. and and you got the Holy Ghost." There's a lot of people baptized in Father, Son, the Holy Ghost on in dark ages. But he said, "Now that you know, it'll be different. &gt;&gt; You're not ignorant anymore now. &gt;&gt; You'll be responsible when you hear the truth. If you've got the Holy Ghost, I'll say this. I'll say this. I believe if you've got the Holy Ghost and you reject the truth of the word, you're going to lose your Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hello. Well, you can't turn the light down. Amen. I want to say this. How many believe this message, the message of the hour, Amen. This is what God has sent to us. &gt;&gt; I want to say that this message, every message is anointed. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we wonder, well, what should I testify? What should I say? What words should come out of my mouth? Tell them that God sent a prophet in this generation. Tell them that God's in Malachi 4. I'm here to tell you tonight, Brother Brandham said, if they are seed of God, when that light shines, when that word comes forth, amen, they'll be quickened. &gt;&gt; It'll quicken. There'll be thousands that won't believe it, but there'll be that one &gt;&gt; in a while that'll receive it. &gt;&gt; How many is that one once in a while? &gt;&gt; That's right. We got a lot of them. That one once in a while will say, "I believe that's the truth." tell them that God had to come down and all this mess of these churches and everything. I mean, he had to come and show us a way that we would know that's right. If that don't catch their attention, I don't know what will. It did mine. I would say absolutely that is the truth. I do want to know which way is right. So, what I say, what I'm saying is when you speak this message, when you're a witness of this message to people, Amen. It's got power in it. &gt;&gt; It's not some old dead letter. It's power. God is behind it. &gt;&gt; I've heard of people for the first time listening to serpent seed and other very strong messages. Hello, and picking it up just like that. &gt;&gt; I don't say sometimes it don't take a little bit. I don't say that. But if they're a seed, according to the prophet of God, if you're a seed of God, when that light comes across your way, you're going to come. You're going to sprout. You're going to come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right. Praise the Lord. God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; So, let's get shut in with God. How many wants to get shut in God? With God. &gt;&gt; Young people get shut in with God. Remember what I'm telling you tonight about watch every thought that comes to your mind. &gt;&gt; Watch everything that you watch on the internet. Be careful. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz it them things will jump out of that phone onto you in a heartbeat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you're going to have victory in your heart, you're going to have joy in your heart. The devil's going to try to get you. All of those weapons out there, everything out there is formed to try to get you &gt;&gt; to fall, to open up your heart or mind so that he can come in and bring all kinds of devils in. &gt;&gt; Don't really want to say it. Amen. So, I don't think I will. But I'm here to tell you one thing that if you open up all of that garbage that's out there, &gt;&gt; you'll be susceptible to it. &gt;&gt; You'll be susceptible to it. &gt;&gt; Terrible. Evening like tabernacle. Be sound. Be stable. Get to the place to where you can stay the way that you're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Oh, I got to change. I got to change. Well, then change. &gt;&gt; Change to what you're supposed to be and then walk in it. God hung the stars. He put them there and he says, "Go there and hold your place. Find your place." Amen. And then stay there because the devil do anything to get you out of your place. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand. if you'll come. Thank you for your prayers. Thank God for the energy to be able to minister and Amen. Not being dog sick. Little bit, but not bad. Praise the Lord. Amen. Could use Tylenol right now, but that's all right. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you love each other? &gt;&gt; Amen. We all love each other. Amen. Let me see. How does how does that go? Right. That's okay. Is it a heart? Ain't that right? It means I love you. Right. &gt;&gt; Love you. I just thought about that when I was studying. I said, I'm gonna give him a heart. Everybody else does that. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand. Say thank you. Thank you, Lord. God bless you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's awesome, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I The song come on my heart and uh God is good all the time. And the first verse says, "If you're walking through a valley, there are shadows all around, but do not what?" That's right. Amen. For God is good all the time. Well, if you're walking through the valley, oh, there are shadows all around. Do not fear. He will guide you. Oh, he will keep you safe at sound. Remember, where'd they go [Music] of Thomas? God is good all the time. He puts a song of grace in his heart of mine. God is good all the time and through the darkest night his light will shine. God is good. Oh, he's so good. God. Well, we were sinners, so are worthy. Yet for us, he chose to die. He filled us with the Holy Spirit. Now we can stand and testify. Oh that his love is everlasting and his mercies oh they will never end. God is good. Oh yes. All the time he puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. And through the darkest night, his light will shine. God is good. Oh, he's so good all the time. And though I may not understand all the plans you have for me. For my life is in your hands and through the eyes of faith I can clearly see. Oh God is good. Oh all the time. He puts a song of grace in this heart of mine. God is good. All the time through the darkest night, his light will shine. God is good. Oh, he's so good all the time. Amen. Amen. Amen. You love him with all of your heart. You know, there's something I've always thought of when they talk about that they carried that cluster of grapes out. How many likes grapes? Oh, I when I worked in the grocery store, those grapes would come in those big clusters. I think it took two men to carry a cluster of grapes. I always thought, how could they not believe with the evidence that was in front of them? And how can we not believe today without with the evidence in front of us? Amen. It's been good to be in the house of the Lord. And brother Brad, we have a prayer request that come in. Would you come and pray over this and dismiss this tonight? It was given to me just a few minutes ago. It's a prayer request for Mansky's son, Tammy Mansky's son, friend of Adriana, and he's having surgery tomorrow at 9:00. and we just want to pray that the Lord would guide the hands of the physicians and that all would be well. So, let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we come before you tonight. Lord, we're praying for this young man, Danny. And we don't don't know the situation of the surgery or uh or what the ailment is, but Father, we know the the creator of the body. We know the maker of the body, Lord. And we know the great physician. And Lord, the doctors, they'll treat us and they'll give us medicine and pain relief and try to fix the problem. but only you're the healer, Father. So Lord, we commit this young man into your hands tonight, Lord. And we just ask, Lord, that you would lead and guide and direct the physicians as they prepare to do the surgery and that they would just be able to to have the surgery without any complications, Lord, and that you would just sweep through the operating room. And Lord, that you would touch his body with a supernatural touch, Lord, and give him the the recovery that he needs. Lord, we just want to tell you we love you. We appreciate you. We thank you for the word tonight, Lord, as it went forth. And we thank you for this close-knit church that loves one another and and that has been growing in in in the word and and with each other. And we just ask, Lord, that you continue to bless our church, bless our pastor, and and each and every family that's here, Lord, and be with us tonight as we go our separate ways, Father. And may your guardian angels be about us, encamped about us, and bring us back at your appointed time. We just want to tell you we love you. We appreciate you. and thank you for all you do. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God is good all the time. He puts us all the praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time.
