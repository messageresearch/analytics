[Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] know [Music] morning I told uh told Brother William Brother David I just don't get up here and make everybody upset then they'll have to get them back in good spirits for service starts I was looking around outside yesterday we're letting our trash get out of hand over in our provision over there and on the pick a ball court and just scattered around um if if you're able to take a cup up up there you should be able to do something with the cup when you're done I'm uh the Lord has blessed us abundantly and uh I noticed this even goes back I just sort of watch uh even from the bonfire and everything that we have had the week before the trash was left up there and then last weekend with us having the carry in it just accumulated more so after service today I'm expecting volunteers to go up there and clean up another thing is we have people from in the neighborhood bring their kids of course and play um and that that was expected after we put up the playground but they have been really good about not trashing our area uh but I'm afraid if we don't keep it clean what's going to happen is you know hey they don't care so why should I care and so uh I want have them to talk to so I just like for that to be took care of today and I notice the broom handle has got broke uh we'll get that fixed I know y'all need it to clean the rocks and stuff off the pick a ball court so that'll get took care of but let's just try to take care of what the Lord has blessed us with this also applies to the fellowship building um if you have an event or or something or even if you just come to play uh pingpong that's perfectly okay but don't leave a mess down there uh it's Sister Mary Jane and sister Jessica clean the church and everything but I don't want to put more of a hardship on them to feel like they have to check behind us done it Fellowship building too they do a really good job and so that's just basically what I had to say uh did I miss anything my wife knows what I was going to say because I told her uh if you put food in the trash uh let's try to tie that up or do something Brother David has been super faithful about hauling getting rid of the trash once it's and so uh I asked him this morning I said do you mind he says no said I I don't mind said uh I've got somewhere to put it so let's get everything in bags let's get it tied up and uh and we'll put it in his truck so I think that's that's everything that wasn't too painful was it okay as long as we just clean up behind ourselves and and remember this you know we got a very nice facility very nice and uh we're going to take care of it okay Lord bless you brother Troy we'll just all standing this morning got the bad news out of the way now we're here for the good news so no that's that's good we definitely want to keep it clean um if you'll just bow your heads maybe brother Joe will open us in prayer this morning e believe you all tell amen the children can be dismissed for Sunday school and if you'll go with me in the Psalms we're going to go to Psalms 71 it's a little bit longer Psalms but um Psalm 71 it's an encouraging Psalms Psalm 71 in thee Oh Lord do I put my trust let me never be put to confusion be thou my strong habitation wherein to I may continually Resort thou Hast given commandment to save me for th Thou Art my rock and my Fortress for thou art My Hope Oh Lord God Thou Art my trust from my youth I am as a Wonder unto many but Thou Art my strong Refuge cast me not off in the time of old age for take me not when my strength faileth saying God hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliver him let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt my mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for I know not the number thereof oh God thou Hast taught me from my youth and hither to have I declared thy wondrous works thy righteousness also oh God is very high who has done great things oh God who is like unto thee Thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me to on every side my lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee and my soul which thou Hast redeemed my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my hurt God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters if you would turn with me to uh you can turn to Luke the 6th chapter and then Ephesians the fourth chapter you not about what brother Steve was saying but people are people you know that uh that Parable that talks about narrow is the way broad is you know Broad and narrow is the way that's just you can't get away from Human Nature you know it's just that way everyone wants to take the easy path no one wants to take the hard path but um I lost my place here uh about the 46th verse of the sixth chapter of in Luke we just before I get started this is the beginning of this month um I had the the I just chant the southern states did fill up the tanks in December so all the all the propane tanks are filled up I don't know how much it cost us though I'll know that in a week or two and then we have to make another quarterly insurance payment on the uh about the 15th of December and that'll be about $1,000 payment so that's where we're at and then in the general fund it's gotten a lot better we're back up to about $88,500 in the general fund so of course I'll have to pay the insurance payment and the um and the fill up but we're getting back on where we were at before we started doing all that work in in August but I was uh listening to a few messages this morning and over the week and I was just was thinking in the world the world we live in just like the psalm we just read uh it's I was just thinking about the world everything is falling apart out there in the world you there's no safety out there in the world and and I was just thinking in my office this morning you know our lives are just like an old uh childhood nursery rhyme about the three little pigs and I I'm going to I'm going to read this this morning and and which which one of them are you and I'm hoping you're the one that has built your house with stone and not with hay this morning but I'll just read this here uh if I got myself to the right place I'll start at about the um we all know that a Jesus was giv Parables about trees there's good trees and bad trees and then I'll start about the about the 43rd verse I'm going further back I know I do this a lot for a good tree bringeth forth not corrupt fruit and neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit it's impossible you're like brother Brown said your nature is going to people know who you really are once you get out there and mingle with people they see the good and the bad side you You Can't Hide who you are sooner or later everyone's going to know who you are and what you are and he goes on every tree is known by his own fruits for the Thorns of men do not gather for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes so whatever you are whatever type of fruit you bear that's what people receive from you and a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart is the mouth speaketh so you you know a lot of people say you can talk a good talk but do you live what you actually talk about and a lot of times people don't realize who they really are until other people start telling them what they see in their lives but I'm I was thinking about these four verses here this morning and he said when why call you me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say and that's where we're at this morning in this world whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built his house and dig deep and laid a foundation on a rock and when the flood Rose the stream beat verly upon that house and it could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock and that everyone here this morning has a foundation everyone here has built a building building in Christ this morning or you haven't and when the storms come what is going to hold and sometimes we don't find out until we have trials and we have struggles in our life what kind of foundation we really have and that's the worst time in your life to find out what kind of foundation you have when all the world is falling apart you want to have the right foundation this morning you want to have that right experience you want a house that's built by Jesus Christ this morning morning so when the storms of life push against you that your foundation doesn't fall and and I was just thinking the world we living is just falling apart this morning the whole world is just being shaken you know and that it goes back to uh Hebrews the 12th chapter everything that will be shaken will be shaken and when you look out there in the world there's no hope the only hope is in and I'll go on and but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation is built upon the house and the Earth against which the stream did bended me and immediately it fell and the runin of the house was great and um I know we don't want to be that example this morning and I was just thinking of that nursery rhyme about the Three Little Pigs we you don't want to be the one that when the wolf blows down blows your house down on that day and the only way that you'll have that Foundation goes back to what we were what I was thinking about earlier there's two paths that we take there's a narrow path like in Pilgrim's Progress it's a narrow path it's a hard path to follow you have to stay in study of God's word you have to stay prayed up every day to stay on that narrow way that leads to righteousness that leads to Salvation and really in life there's a Broadway and that's the easy path and that path in the end will bring you to destruction but I I'm not going to I say that but I'm not going to read if you would go to the fourth chapter of Ephesians Ians starting at about the 16th ver it kind of starts with what I was saying this morning from when the whole body Filly joined together compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the affectionally working of measure this is the fourth chapter of Ephesians the 16th verse I know I get in a hurry sometimes according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the ad ifying of itself and love goes back to what I was saying the whole body is put together and when it's put together correctly nothing can shake it apart and I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as others Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind you know you can read that scripture this morning and you can see it out there in the world today they're just running after their the vanities of this life and he goes on to say having the understanding darkened and being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of Their Own Heart who being past feeling have given themselves over to lishness to work all unclean with greediness forgive my pronunciations of those words but you have not so learned Christ and that's what I'm thinking this morning that's not what I've learned I've learned what God has taught me in the word of God this morning in the message of the hour which is total opposite of what I just read he goes on to say if it if it so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and uh and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and we go on to this 2 fourth verse says that you put on the new man which is after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness and it goes back to that Foundation that Jesus was talking about if you have that true foundation and God has built this house and built this body in you then you there's nothing that can shake it death whatever it is nothing will shake it wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one another uh be be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your WRA so Paul's given us nuggets here he's given us principles this morning how we were to interact with each other as brothers and sisters this morning did to give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him label working with his hands the things which is good that you may have to give him that needeth and when I read the scriptures I think it's so simple I mean I know God puts it so simple but a lot of times it's in the it's not in the nature of man to look at what he needs to do for salvation he thinks he has to do some great thing or he has to struggle with it but all it is is simply believe in God just letting go and believe in God's word and just letting it have its way with you that God does it and you don't do it yourself and uh I lost my place and he goes be angry and sin not let the sun go down on neither give place to the devil let him that stole no more rather let him label working with his hands that things which is good that he may have to give them which needeth and this is really important in this age that we liveing it's to really control your mind control your heart and your life and your soul that when you speak to people that you don't let the corrupt communication that doesn't there's more that speaking corrupt Community speaking a neev negative confession speaking something that's not positive to people you know you should be biting your if all you can say to something somebody is something negative or something that's not upbeating then it really shouldn't be said you should everything you when you communicate to people should be uplifting should be in everything should be have a good voice to it does it mean that if you have to talk to somebody about something they did wrong there's a right way to talk to people about when they do things wrong let not corrupt Communications proceed out of your mouth by that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be you kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you you know that the thing I I see in a in the word when I look at the word of God it sometimes it's so simple it's even hard for me to reason with it sometimes but as you read what Paul had to say in Ephesians 4th chapter you you read in Luke the 6th chapter what I realize is not how much you can manufacture something it's but it's how much you can get low enough in your life to let God do it for you where you're not struggling with the things in life but you're willing to let go I I mean I got to be honest that's that's a hard thing for me it's in my Baldwin traits is sometimes I get ahead of my skis as I say I want to do it myself instead of letting God do it for me and in this age that we living right now it's really important before you make whatever that decision is in your life that you pray about it you look at God's word and you desire to do what God would have you to do it's real easy to run ahead when you run ahead sometimes when you get to the end of the path you find out that you left a lot behind with you that you should have brought along with you so if I not wanting to menander and thought the most important thing I thought this morning this world is falling apart and what hope do we have but in Jesus Christ this morning I I know I say that a lot but I I was just looking at the uh political events going on in the world and and I I think of the message of the hour what brother brandham taught in the message you know and he taught about those different powers when you when you see the Roman power where you see the leader of the Roman Church allowing outright filthy sin in the church and then you see see China is on the March that bamboo curtain like brother Bram thought it's on the March it wants to conquer the known world you you see the you see the Israeli conflict you see the Syrian conflict you see the Russians you see the north you see that bear you see all this conflict in the world it just lets me know that every day is precious and we just brings us closer to that time where God's going to Rapture the church and I from what I see in the world today I I would just encourage you all we don't want to be here after that day we all want to go up to heaven in the Rapture this morning and just like Jesus said in in Luke the 6th chapter that Foundation that house it has to be built on Jesus Christ this morning if it's not built on that it won't hold it won't last on that day uh Brother David amen you love the Lord this morning amen I'll read an announcement before I get started this morning and says Christmas dinner is next Sunday and says there are still slots that need to be filled for the food please sign up as soon as you possibly can so we will have enough food thank you sister Grace this morning amen you love the Lord with all of your heart this

pouring out his blessings upon us and amen and drawing us closer to him amen so amen we just trust this morning we be be a blessing to you also amen and I'm going to go back before I get into my subject I want to go back amen as I've talked to you about having this series uh I feel like this is still part of it amen and so uh which it's kind of funny but it all ties together so it's all uh from one end to the other it all ties together so it's all a series amen but amen we tried to try to express a little bit of this am mean calling it The gospel in a nutshell basically just that but amen as I've said it would have to be awful big nutshell but turn to Revelations if you will and we'll begin Revelations and this is an expression now of course once again of when the saints are on the other side isin't that right when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be amen amen how many believes it'll be a great day of rejoicing amen praise the Lord I certainly believe that amen uh it'll be a great time praise the Lord amen uh and I'm just going to read you Revelations 19 and6 is says over there and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as The Voice voice of Mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife ha made herself ready and of course we know she was granted to be clothed in uh raid in uh linen clean and white and that linen is the righteousness of saints amen so we see how that when you get over there it's going to sound like thunder when all of that Crowd Goes to worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ amen now over in Revelations 5 Revelations 5 amen and again it is the Saints on the other side and what they say what their expression to God Is So if you wonder this morning what our expression is going to be when we get over there this is how it's going to be Amen in verse eight and when he had taken to book the four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou has slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and Nation amen how many believe that's what God's doing amen God's work is is a universal work amen every brand every tribe amen goes over the whole world it's not just any certain tribe but it's every T tongue and tribe God has a people that he comes Amen to receive and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth and I beheld and the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the N of number of them with was 10 thousands times 10 thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is a lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing amen praise the Lord how many I believe he's everything he's everything to me he's my father he's my mother he's my brother he's my sister amen he's my strength he's my S He's My All In All amen we want to talk about what he is amen I thought about titling this he is amen he is the alpha the Omega he is the same yesterday today and forever he's the beginning he's the ending he's the author and finisher of our faith he is more than what I ever can take five hours to express amen praise God every creature which is in heaven and on Earth under and under the Earth and such are in the sea verse 13 and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth on the throne and to the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen four beasts what was those four Beast amen was the eagle amen verse seven it says the first Beast was like a lion like a calf third was like the face of a man Luther and Wesley fourth was the Beast was like a flying eagle which was the prophetic age Amen brother brandham and all those four powers every one of those Powers amen voiced their opinion amen and they heard amen saying blessing and honor amen they all say praise you can be seated this morning may God add His blessings to the reading of the word amen we just wanted to recap we're talking basically and trying to speak on what God is amen and talking about what he does Amen his attributes the attributes amen the attributes of God now we know those attributes was that before there was ever the first Stardust was ever created before the first star was hung before there was any Angels before there was anything at all God was all by himself for eons of time we don't know it's unfathomable amen the human mind can't comprehend the greatness of almighty God just not big enough to do it but yet we know that he is amen and way back before then he had something in him Amen to express amen and so he wanted to express it and the only way he could express it was to create a situation like what we're in right now how many believes that this was the plan of God this was no accident not just what happened and I'm going to make adjustments God don't work that way he don't make adjustments just you know as he goes along he knew the beginning from the end he said I am the beginning and I am the ending I'm the first and the last I'm Alpha and Omega he is all of that amen so there's nothing no surprises to God Amen can I recap Wednesday night a little bit for y'all that didn't hear hear it and mean we talked about how that uh God loves to put trials on us he loves to test us bad things happen he allows bad things to happen we're going to recap here a little bit before we get into my message praise the Lord that's right I don't think I have my other one that's right he loves to just put us into places like he did Israel after he brought them out like I said you know sometimes it seems like God could do things and get things fixed up before we get there but sometimes he don't like Israel he didn't have the red SE open he leted him to go down into a trap so to speak is't that right get him into what he calls a trap prophet of God says he put him right there in a trap he me he he puts you sometimes right in a trap to see what you do about it he put them in a trap down there amen and my whole core of men tonight was don't worry about the Trap God is not not God is not concerned with your trial it's not about the trial that's hello remember job he was a perfect man there was no reason to put a trial on him perfect most upright is that right and our scripture for my thought this morning is job God allowed that to come upon him and he went to Satan said hey have you considered my servant job Jo and and Satan said what he said yeah yeah all that a man has you know but if you take all of his stuff and everything away he says he'll curse you to your face so it was about what job would do that God allowed job to go through that trial go through that test God allows us to go through tests and not so much God can just use anything he wants to put a test on you he'll have somebody cut you off on the road or something you know and see what kind of road rage that you have and that right do any kind but he uses different things and with job he allowed all this to come upon Him amen and God was going to prove to the devil that job wasn't going to curse God because if you'll notice every time after the first chapter he says job said the lord gave the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord that was the response that God was looking for it is not about the trial it is about your attitude and your response to the trial that God is looking for woo I believe we need that down in our hard drive don't you way down in the core of our car amen just as me and my wife as you know we got that bad news ain't that right amen of the doctor saying just saying that hey you you know when when I said I I said well what what can we do are you going to move remove the breast what are you going to do no there's no use in removing it it it just cause the car you are going to die of breast cancer is what she told her very bluntly which is I guess the way we need it and of course you know that was a real shock when somebody tell you are going to die huh like I said earlier you know if somebody says you know you know you know you've got cancer but I'll tell you what it's a tumor and I believe we can cut it off I you know you've got hope there but when there's no hope amen you're in a trap what are you going to do of course you know me I went to boohoo and and falling on her lap and may everything else you know but she was like what you crying about help me on my head what are you crying about you know not necessarily those words but a it's okay and she's smiling and stuff and you know the whole way the whole way through this she never got that fear never got that scared that that's what she said that's what the doctor said that's not what I said that's not what God says and I'm just going to go ahead and say it but you her breast was all it's got a big big spot on it big red the whole thing was almost big and red and it's about almost half that size this morning that's right it's gone down dramatically amen but you know you can either have doubt and you can think about the feeling funeral and you can think about the suffering of death and everything you can think about that and you can boohoo huh and there was a few time I'll just be personal this morning but there was a few times out in the barn and so forth I was just overwhelmed amen and sorrow come upon me and I begin to cry out God spare Lord Jesus and I it was not I didn't feel like it was me but I felt like God put this upon me two times it happened two times majorly amen that I just went down on my knees on the bail of head and began to cry out to God Amen it said God you said that the righteous cry and I hear them and deliver them out of their own that's what you said God Amen and I begin to inter I felt like I was interceding how many believe we need some interceder when God puts that intercession you and begin to pray amen that's God doing not you trying to manufacture something but I believe that it's God doing something amen but a trap talk about this trap that we get into it Israel get into this trap and I found so much that I've had to come up to the level of faith that my wife has you know God is more than able he's the same yesterday today and forever and we know amen that if he ever healed anybody if you meet those same conditions that those people had you will be healed all you got to do is meet those same conditions because God is the same yesterday today and forever amen if anybody ever got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen everybody got anybody that ever got saved amen got the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the inside you meet those same conditions this morning amen and you can have it too no matter what it is oh I'm so glad that all of God's promises the Bible says are yay and amen they are positive there's nothing negative about this these promises God has given us exceeding and great and precious promises the Bible says it's not just salvation it's healing it's Deliverance it's Joy it's peace it's all of those things there's so much that's ours amen praise the Lord amen it's our responsibility to believe God's it's his responsibility to do rest amen this morning I want to title this The Great Escape The Great Escape we talked about being in a trap how Bud like to hear about getting out of the Trap I like that amen so God allows us to get in traps he allows it he did Israel isn't it something because he loves to see your response see how you respond because right here brother bam says he puts you right in that trap to see what you're going to do he put them in that trap right down there amen praise the Lord but listen to what he says the writer once says he says when they got into that place wondered that what Moses would do see God had commanded go forward go go forward if you're in the line of duty no matter what comes in the way he says the greatest experiences that I've ever had that I've come up against something that I couldn't get over it couldn't get under it am mean just stand there and watch God make a way through that's right that's the way to do it just keep moving keep moving just press your nose right up against it he said you come up against the wall God wall God say just keep on going that's what Israel hey we're going to just stand still and see the salvation of God but don't doubt now one more point that I made Wednesday was that the Bible says that they provoke God by unbelief first he gets them in a trap a place they can't get around can't get over can't get around it and then when they murmur and complain God gets angry with them right hey that's my daddy you're talking about that's right that's right like some of our daddies you fall down and skin your knee a little bit after you get so big Ain that right when they're little oh you might pet them and stuff but when they get it's just a little scratch quit your whining quit crying so much huh cruel daddies sometime whip our kids and then say all right dry it up or I'll give you some more Mike and Caleb now they're like yeah we you know they're like well it's easier to dry this up than it is to say in them more but that's what God told Moses god Moses cried he was crying to him and God says why are you crying why Cry To Me Speak the word and go forward how many believe that's what we got to do speak the word say What God Says and go forward amen keep going forward just keep on going amen praise the Lord he says just keep on going God Will Make A Way because God is a specialist of the impossible once you come to the place of impossible and not anything you can do that's where God is a specialist of stepping in if he's got to wall up the waters dry up the land and walk across amen praise the Lord are that's right and they did and I'm believing that he's the same today as he was yesterday God hasn't changed any amen now when you uh when you get into this trap and let me just start out by saying this that every one of us was born in this trap we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies what does that child do as soon as they get old enough and smart enough to do they'll lie they're not angels huh no they're first they were born with the first wrong nature I mean we were born with the wrong nature why do you think God said that you got to be born again Born Again of the spirit amen let me just say this somebody asked brother Bram he says you know I'm a Christian but I still have these desires I still do these things do these things he says well just what happens if a tree dies or a a follow the year comes and the life goes down in amen and what happens all those leaves just drop off and he says that's the way with a born again believer when you change your nature the old leaves they just F they just fade away when God comes and he takes something from you it's finished amen but we were born in a trap born without hope in this world condemn amen what a terrible place to find ourselves amen and let's admit it this is a cruel place you know in all of this it makes the reality of dying a little bit more real the fact that we all come to that place we're all going to come to that place if time would tar amen we do our hunting we do things that we enjoy doing we all of these things but in the end guess what the ultimate outcoming would be a funeral is that right and we always we always think well it's somebody else it's somebody else but someday it hits you someday it comes to your door that ambulance that we hear screaming up and down the road one day it could be you could be you in there one of these days that Hearst going down the road it's not going to be somebody else goingon to be you amen praise the Lord but think about it and we realize that God allowed us to get into this situation through the prophet of God we even understand that he designed Eve as a byproduct ain't that right because he knew Adam wouldn't fall but he made a byproduct off of him and he knew before he ever made her that she would fall that's right amen oh boy this is get this is going to be a little meaty here but do you realize and I never knew it until the message of the hour that God that that even the angels that God created were on free moral agency they could choose whether they wanted to stay with God or they wanted to go with Lucifer and there was a big division in heaven two-thirds of the angels went with Lucifer is that right they were all cast out they made their choice so they were made and designed so that they could fall amen that's why we have Cancers and tuberculosis and suc diabetes and all these other demons they're devils in the Supernatural realm amen that's right we've got hatred and bitterness and envy and jealousy and all those things are demons hello that's right hatred like Cain did led to murder but I've got a scripture of Hope for you is that okay first I want to talk about the bad for a while is that all right but I'm going to I'm going to talk if I can here if I can find it right quick let me see it's either in Romans or Corinthians see the creature in Romans 8 and2 says for the creature was made subject to vanity not willing you but by reason of him who has also subjected the same in hope in other words God allowed us to come into this place but God has also subjected us to Hope and I don't know sure just how I got it let me just read it the way I got it wrote down hopefully makes sense God that allowed us to get into this sming Burning dump so to speak this hell hole this terrible place this evil place how many knows this is Satan's eating now all kinds of evil and wicked things the god that allowed us to get into that place amen has also given us something that is greater than that there's something that's greater Paul said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US us this 60 70 80 years of suffering and so forth amen for the sake of Christ it's not worthy Paul and his suffering and all of his suffering he says all the suffering that he did how many knows Paul suffered a lot shipwreck Stripes imprisonments his head cut off hello but it says it's not to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US amen so all in all no matter how depressing it looks no how bad things are we still shout the glory of God we have our heads above it why because of God is greater than any of it amen amen I'll go ahead and say it since it comes to mind it's actually the end of my sermon but I'll go say this you say well what about death brother B what about when somebody isn't that such a horrible terrible thing as far as leaving and and and being absent from them people it's terrible thing but the Bible says how precious is the death of one of his children in God's eyes it's the best thing happened to him how many knows brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time he shook their hands he hugged them and he seen them they were there they're really there that's right he says you know when he came back he says there's no words in the English vocabulary to describe to you how beautiful it is over there there's no old age There's No Tomorrow there's no yesterday there's no you know pretty good and good days and bad day it's absolute perfection and beyond that and so when it comes right down to it folks even the worst that you can think we know that beyond that last breath is a world that is beyond our comprehension awesome Amen so that's our hope that's our faith that's what we know amen why you think Paul could said oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your Victory EV Bosworth the different one says man who's dying here you or me play me some Snappy gospel song Oh down at the cross where my savior play me some Snappy songs why because they knew that going into the presence of God so now the Stinger of death has been taken out when you look at that in the right way you're doing good because the devil wants you to look at it in the wrong way is that right he sure does praise the Lord so we were born in this trap born in a terrible thing called our first nature huh but we were born with a nature that's even wrong something that how many knows you can fight it all you want to you can fight that nature all you want to but without the power of the Holy Spirit you'll never overcome it you can come to church and you can call yourself a Christian you take communion you can do all of those things but you're still going to go out there and cheat and lie and steal and everything else you're going to do things that's wrong why because it's your nature that's why we need a nature change the fruit of the spirit is love and joy and peace forgiveness longsuffering gentleness and all of those things Galatians 5 talks about the fruit of the flesh is emulation and wrath and strife and Sedition and adultery and all of hatred and variance and emulation terrible things nothing good about the nature of a flesh but God comes to change that amen so we're born in a trap amen now I want to go to our beginning scripture is that okay amen praise the Lord 1 Corinthians 10 1 Corinthians 10 this is what the Lord laid on my heart to speak on this morning if comes to me I'm just going to say it as it comes you know Jesus says you believe in God why don't you also believe in me ain't that right I want to say that this morning people say they believe Jesus Christ of yesterday why don't they believe the Jesus of today what God is doing today he says and even Jesus says unless you believe that I am he that was to come you'll die in your sins amen how many believ it's important to believe Jesus Christ in your hour in your day amen now in uh 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 13 there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with that Temptation also make a way of Escape praise the Lord hallelujah aren't you glad that God makes a way of Escape I believe it's in Hebrews Hebrews 2 chapter says therefore we ought to give the more Earnest to the things which we have heard least at any time we should let them slip for if we for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape amen if we neglect such a great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard them the third scripture of Escape is in second Peter second Peter 1 and verse4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises how many believe that that's right I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you whatever you ask in my name I will do it amen I say unto you that if you say to this mountain be plucked up and cast into the sea and if you doubt not it shall be done how many beli so many promises that if you ask anything in my name I will do it Lord help us to come up to that whatever you ask God I will do it why because how many believes we've been restored back to the in our spirit realm we've been restored back to the way that Adam was before the fall exceeding great and precious Promises by the that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen so we have escaped there one place we've escaped amen the corruption that is in the world if you're a Christian this morning you have escaped so many things so many things to be a Christian means that you be Christlike to be filled with his holy spirit amen unless you are born again you cannot even see the kingdom of God Jesus said unless a man is born of water and of spirit Paul said he that hath not the spirit of God is none of his it takes a new birth of the Holy Spirit to change your nature to cause you to escape the corruption that is in the world I mean there's some real corruption out there I'm glad that I'm not governed by Satan this morning don't have to tattoo myself and paint all over myself and wear nose rings and eye rings and have orange hair and pink hair doesn't the devil just really paint him up good don't he go to Walmart and you got orange and green and pink hair and oh my you're on my if you're you're if you're man didn't get win the election just going crazy because somebody didn't win the election come on folks huh it's just sad amen Amen brother brand preached a message in 1956 making a way that's where I like got a lot of De thoughts from but my initial thought was this and that is that I want to say make a statement are you ready for this no matter what it is no matter what it is it don't matter like I said all the way to the door of death God makes a way of Escape if he' had just left us in this condition it had been a terrible way to have to live but no he has provided a way of Escape no matter what it is H and there's only two factions there's only two factions that governs everything that's Faith or doubt when you get into those traps when you get into those places you'll either be governed by fear or faith and I want you to understand something about God and that is God forces you to make a decision you have to pick one or the other just like you have to pick heaven or hell you have to God put it out there and he said whosoever will let him come you have to decide even the prophet of God said God isn't going to send you to hell you make the choice yourself of whether or not you're going to go to hell why because he put the pardon there if you don't accept it you're sending yourself there Amen in the greatest battle ever fought there's only two elements that you can be controlled by that's either Faith or doubt amen he says we've had Wars rumors of wars that's how the Earth stands today there'll be plenty more Wars but do you realize there's only two powers in the universe and all of our differences between the Nations difference between each other and everything all it all amounts to two Powers there's only two powers and two kingdoms amen and all of the rest of these little minor things are all connected to either one of those Powers that's Satan's power and God's power the power of Faith or the power of Doubt amen another one here he says there's only two elements in the world that control controls the world tonight that's fear and faith and I don't think I uh but on the other quote he says that's either fear or doubt and fear will accompany doubt how manyan knows it's ultimately fear and faith but doubt and fear always accompanies doubt amen if I doubt that Donna is going to live I could be very depressed when I think about her dying and me not being with her and so forth or it can be very depressing it could bring fear is that right bring fear and depression because that's what doubt does Amen so think about it doubt brings fear when I think about Adam how many knows Adam let's let's look a little bit with the help of the Lord on to two different things that uh doubt brings doubt amen will make you keep your condemnation how many know people that don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ don't believe in the Forgiveness of sins don't believe in the remission of sins they don't believe the Lord they will keep their condemnation that's right they will always be condemned like Adam was and the first thing that happened even when Eve disbelieved the word look at what it brought fear death Adam willfully stepped out to save his wife and so forth and what did they find themselves doing hiding why hide because they were scared because they had fear that's the one thing that comes into each and everyone and I don't care even the prophet said he's been by many a person that has many brags and everything else and curse God and whatnot but when they come to ding they say could I have been wrong when it comes down to the door of death there's that fear that comes in and they realize they going out amen and fear come into Adam why because doubt was there but doubt has absolutely no virtue there's nothing good about fear or doubt butam says you know if I knew I was going to get shot tomorrow it wouldn't do me any good to be scared about it to worry about it fear and worry doesn't do anything for you but make it worse amen amen I think you I think yall have a lot of confidence in what I say because you know I talk from experience I talk from experience amen that was put on me it was forced on me it was forced on my wife it's forced on all of us what are you going to do which way you going to go amen and I thank God for his grace for his Mercy that in the midst of all that you can find the right way you can find the right thought and that is his thoughts not your thoughts and not the devil thoughts and I I'm here to tell you it brings you peace peace that passes understanding when the waves are coming when the ship is about to sink amen it's just like the disciples when they had to go back there and wake him up don't you care that we perish he up there and says oh ye of little faith how long will I suffer you he rebuked them can you imagine getting up they're about to drown amen where's your faith amen I'm here to tell you that there's God is still here that calms the storm he's still got power over the waves amen I want you to understand there's still an anchor that can hold that ship that the waves may come over may come around may come under but if it's anchor to that Rock Amen it ain't going nowhere it'll hold that's right praise be to God and I'm just going to go ahead and tell what comes to mind we have went all of us I we've went through a lot of hard things and God has brought us through all of those and he is taking us through this he is taking us through this thank you Jesus thank you Lord cuz he's the same yesterday today and forever and our faith and our confidence is in him but it does take Faith you got to believe how many believes that when that uh what was it I believe it was the man with the epileptic child came up to him he says if thou can't believe all things are possible I mean that boy was in a terrible State and God says if you can believe how many knows he's still saying the same thing to every one of us if you can believe all things are possible he's the same yesterday today and forever but there are those let me say this there are those who do not Escape there are those who do not not make it amen there are those who do not make it first of all I want to start out with this remember Jesus said go and sin no more when he would deliver somebody go and send no more or a worse thing come upon you you can lose your healing you can lose these things if your doubt goes down if you begin to have doubt and you don't believe it anymore guess what you'll lose it even as God might sanctify you and clean the house and get rid of the evil that you have but if you don't feel that up with something seven more Devils more evil than that one will come back what about the children of Israel how many they came they escaped Egypt right but they kept doubting they kept not believing in hard situations they let their faith dwindle God brought them up to that Red Sea isn't that right and they complained wasn't there enough Graves for us to be buried in in Egypt how many times say oh I wish I would have we we let's go back and go back to Egypt naan and C they doubted that Moses was called to be the leader he thought I ought to have a little bit in this leadership stuff it's not just a one man thing here no we're all holy we're all say go Moses was grieved God was so so grieve with them cuz they doubted God's calling of Moses did they escape no no they didn't they swallowed them up they died because they didn't believe so I in my study I come up with this conclusion it's dangerous it's deadly it's horrible it's dangerous to not believe amen ex very dangerous not to believe you'll send yourself to Hell by not believing you'll not be healed by not believing you'll not be saved by not believing amen God doesn't like that unbelief God sent us a prophet in this generation took his picture with it the pillar of fire very same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel amen did signs and wonders very same things he did millions of times Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart brother Brandon would have to wait till he comes oh you know who I'm waiting on and all of a sudden your name is from so and so the very same Messiah sign and people don't believe it people don't believe it on the day of judgment Jesus is going to say I did that world over challenged the Hindu Buddha 30,000 of them said any of your all of your gods come open this Blind Man's eyes and I'll have your relationship but if my Jesus will open it did all of that and they still won't believe he says we did that all for you amen but you wouldn't believe amen go ye into all the world Jesus said and demonstrate the gospel the power of the Gospel 12 people raised from the dead will people believe it no remember last when you know he he this this this rich man died went to hell and said man send somebody back from the dead send somebody back back from the dead and let them he said no if they don't believe the prophets they won't believe anybody even though they're raised from the dead God can graise people from the dead and they still don't believe man can't do that that's God and I thought M when I thought about doubt and what it does God keep me away from from doubt it'll bring depression CU see I've got wrote down here uh you know this condemnation brings fear fear brings a complex when you're scared of something you can't be the man that you're supposed to be you can't have confidence it brings inferiority is't that right you feel inferior and and you are inferior it brings weakness it brings feelings of worthless lessness you want to you're it's you you're scared you want to hide it brings unsur you're on sinking sand it brings sorrow and it brings depression many times it brings suicide people feel so worthless that's what doubt will do it'll keep your sin upon you amen condemnation my go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned there it is that's right so God says you know if you believe for God send his for God to love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved there is your pardon you have that pardon now accept it or don't accept it decide which way you want to go decide where you want to spend eternity you have to once you hear the truth once you hear the gospel You're Not Innocent anymore God this morning service in my preaching is being recorded and it'll be played back on the day of judgment that's why it's so important that I say what the Bible says what God has Vindicated and proven to be true amen or I'll be judged I will have to give an account you see where we're at amen it's dangerous to doubt man if you would have just realized how dangerous it was to flirt with that serpent she'd have smacked him like a good woman does flirting with a somebody that ought to be flirting with I just thought about that you like that iing about picture of it smack him get away from me stay away from me don't you even come don't come anywhere close to me I mean that's what you and I ought to be saying don't don't you come anywhere close to me don't you try to get up in my mind and make me doubt cuz that's what he does and he's a good guy at it try to make you doubt by your own reasoning your own thinking watch your own thinking it better be the way that God thinks amen praise the Lord you've got to give things up folks you got to give your own ways up got to give your own thinking up your own ideas up amen what does it say lean not to your own understanding my my my that's right he that believeth not just that simple sends your soul to hell because you don't believe that's dangerous that's not something that we want to do amen I looked up on theory about penicillin where it come from some kind of mold I'm out it's some kind of mold amen menitis and a few other things a bunch of stuff that that's good for is that right that'll cure but before they could find that how many knows those medical science or what do they call them chemists I guess what they'll do is they'll go out and they'll find out try to find Roots they'll find they'll just try about everything I mean who have thought let's get some terrible mold that'll kill you and let's find out if we can get a cure out of it even prophet of God says you know you go to praying for a for a a disease an antidote you might get one they do that why to try to cure different diseases different sicknesses I don't know about you but praise God for Tylenol praise God for aspirin praise God for everything medicine all of medicine that they've been able to come up with and make you feel better that's right but you know they say that they'll take these chemistry and they'll take a a rat or something and inject that rat with it is that right and see how they do see how they react put the sickness on them first and then see if it works and if it works amen even Trump has allowed stuff that hasn't really been proven right but if a person is terminal go ahead and try it right can't lose you know it might just help but you know they've come up with vaccines for things we thank God for those vaccines you and I needed a vaccine from this nature of sin that we're in from our depression from the things that tear us apart from grumbling from complaining from not getting along for being hateful [Music] mean hello why because we ain't got peace in our heart amen and how many knows God one day looked down from heaven saw his son ain't that right and he injected the spirit into Jesus cuz he came down like a dove and landed on him he injected him with something and I'm here to tell you when he come to Matthew 4 he was up on the mountain of the devil tempted him in every manner amen he got sined and the inoculation hell when he come up the demons when he come up the epilepsy when he come up the blind people it's would he come up to any kind ofbody like that woman at the well with the blood issue just touch him that inoculation was good how many's glad for that amen then he went on the ramp parts of glory amen let me say this first of all and then but he wanted to get the ultimate serum why because even though he had it you couldn't have it he could heal you but you really didn't have power to heal others you couldn't lay your hands on somebody else and give them the Holy Ghost cuz you didn't have the Holy Ghost hello but he went to Calvary that's why we promote Calvary that's why we promote the cross of Jesus Christ cuz when he died he said it is finished the prescription has been wrote go ye into all World baptizing them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sin that right Father Son and the Holy Ghost is with Jesus Christ and they shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the promise is to you to your children let me stop for a minute when God does something he's not like us he doesn't have to advance he doesn't have to get better he doesn't have to improve on it and has never needed to improve isn't it something how our doctors of divinity in our Bible schools tried to tell the muhammads and different ones that Mark 16 from a certain verse on down amen well that wasn't inspired they're trying to make the inoculation no good but they can't never make it no good no matter how the much they doubt no matter how much they disbelieve amen it's still good today you repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promise is to you to your children my grandchildren to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen aren't you glad that if you oh we had the blues we'd have to drink and smoke and everything else to try to have a little pleasure and it would never satisfy none of those things satisfied but aren't you glad that you've got the bread of life you've got the water of life that he didn't drink of this water shall never thirst again he's got the Cure he's got the escape from all of your troubles he's got your the escape from your Wy Wy wound us from your Blues from your sadness from your oh my lukewarmness amen aren't you glad that he's got a cure he's got an escape for all of it God makes a way Hallelujah sure he put them Israelites in a trap but what did he do amen let's not Glory over the Trap too much let's Glory over the water that was parted amen and God provided a way when you believe God God is obligated to make way believe God God Will Make A Way my that just feels good that's right Oh my he doesn't hold back God don't a that right he might let you be thrown into a lion's den he didn't stop at the wall no he let him throw them all in W but Daniel believed he didn't doubt he didn't fear he believed in his God and God made away and he had that Pillar of Fire down there but the prophet of God said the lions are afraid of Fire amen amen I like how Hanan preacher says Daniel was busy petting kitty kitties all night how you kitty kitties doing y'all doing all right see we got the master with us here's the pillar of fire we got our maker with us don't we we love each other when he's around y'all don't want to eat me anymore I don't want to hunt you and kill you hello we get along when the Master's here God made a way how many glad that we've got a way maker he's my way maker he's my promisee keeper he keeps his word brother says you believe God genuinely with your heart something's got to happen God keeps his word he's not a liar I don't care how many people die butam says if I pray for 500 people they all die I'll come back next night and I'll preach Divine Healing cuz I don't care if I if you had 500 unbelievers huh doesn't do the way with the believer no come right back and prach you God is a I am the god that Health all thy diseases heal all thy sicknesses he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we will are healed you were healed spiritually amen bruised for your iniquities your sins your spiritual welfare God came to heal that to give you escape out of your old nature and by his stripes your natural person can be healed amen and what is the first thing that comes to your mind a lot of times the devil will try to say well but look at that person they tried they said they believed and they doubted and they died I mean boo who cares devil tries to scare you huh oh I don't know if I'm any better that person I'm not saying you're any better maybe it was God's Divine will for for them to go maybe it was his their time to go hey I'm always willing to get accept God's Divine will anybody that isn't got a problem I might as well say it while it comes to mind Brother Brad but through this all I've thought about something the big battle a lot of times the big battle and I want to say this that even Jesus Jesus had a big battle brother Bram says that he had fought his greatest battle in the Garden of Gethsemane between God's will and his will even Jesus when he was facing death said if it be possible even Jesus let it pass from me so hard but yet he said nevertheless not my will but thy will be done that's for every believer how many believes that's for all of us amen that's right amen it's always the sweet will of God praise be to God you love him this morning amen that's right God makes a way for the believer can't say that always how many let me say this how many knows that God was merciful to the Israelites ain't that right now to daythan and car to Dayan he wasn't very merciful when Dayan rose up and all of those princes and everybody rose up with him ain't that right Moses said you bring your incense you bring your incense to the the temple and we're going to see who God has received and who hasn't is that right and after that we found out that God didn't give him another chance he opened up the Earth and swallowed him up but with all of the israelit when God wanted to just SW wipe them all off he says just separate yourself from them Moses and Moses was a Jesus and he stood in breach no Lord people say he wasn't able to deliver and so forth before you them take my life how many times that God was merciful to Israel even with their doubt even with their doubt God was merciful But ultimately we understand that it was only their children that went in when they doubt it for the last time at ktie Baria God said that's it go back out into the Wilderness and they all went back into that Wilderness until they were all dead all those people that doubt it were all dead two million that's pretty strong folks but they didn't make it let me tell you something that's how dangerous doubt is when we come to the Judgment bar up there if you disbelieve trust me it'll show on that day God will show it in Box Car size letter the thoughts that went through your mind what you did with the word of God Amen this generation of Pentecostal Baptist methodists Catholics every kind that saw the manifestation of Jesus Christ 10 times greater than the book of Acts and they still walked away judgment's going to be bad for him it's going to be a bad day for him because brother Braham says my tape those tapes will be played back because that's not me but that's Jesus Christ Ministry they'll be played back on the day of judgment amen amen whenever brother brandom is praying for somebody with cancer or or sick person now raise your hands you don't know how many times me and my wife will raise our hands and now get up on your feet for laying on the bed we'll stand on our feet why do we do that because brother brandham said that even after I'm gone these tapes they will live on they will live on why are they're still alive the word of God is still the [Applause] TR amen if you can believe it amen somebody made a comment about that Pillar of Fire and God healed a't that right that's right made a negative confession about it and also got a damnation for it that's right God knows the motive and objective he knows our hearts thoughts and intents of our heart I'm going to try to close here with Paul's description of those who believe not in uh 1 Corinthians 10 moreover Brethren I would not have you to be ignorant that not all of our father that all of our fathers were under the cloud they all passed through the sea amen everybody claims to believe in Jesus everybody claim to be a Christian they were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and the Sea they didn't all eat the same spiritual meat they all drank from the Spain spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ oh I'd love to preach a little bit on that how many of knows when they were so thirsty they were about to dry up God didn't have a little spring springing up out of some soft sand somewhere no he had water to come on a hard rock God can do anything praise the Lord but with many of them God was not pleased because they were overthrown in the wilderness because they believe not now these things were our examples to the intent that you should not lust after evil things as they also lusted don't be idolators as some of them also were the people sat uh down to eat and to drink when they rose up the play and neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 20 and 3,000 amen and don't murmur how many know when they were murmuring the snakes come and bit them they're complaining and they're murmuring woo like I said Wednesday Papa a hard God sometimes you want to cry and you want to complain maybe because of the hard times you go through amen God doesn't want you to murmur and to complain he wants you to believe him amen all the things and they were destroyed of Destroyer now all these things happen unto them for in samples and they are written for our admiss admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come boy oh boy so to speak aren't we at the ends of the world yeah we're at the ends of the world and we've got all of these examples when God does something believe him don't doubt no matter what comes your way don't doubt don't falter don't walk away don't run don't quit but believe amen Lord help us to be people of Faith how many want to say Lord don't get me around don't let me get around that dangerous thing called doubt or unbelief don't let it enter in my mind immediately cast it off amen and then all things are POS possible your salvation Deliverance let me close with this once again no matter what the sickness is sin sickness depression no matter what it is how many believes God has an escape for you he makes a way of Escape for you amen amen this just comes to me but even brother Braham says aren't you glad there is such a thing as death you see these old people and and and they just just the quality of life just just just barely they're just about dead huh I don't know about you but when I get to that place I don't want to do that for another 50 years okay just just let me go on you know that's right why to take you out of this pest house and give you a brand new body how glad oh man how glad that even the Bible says if this Earthly Tabernacle if this house is disolved M it's already got an escape you ain't got to wander out there in the regions of the Lost no you escape the regions of the lost and enter into your new body he's got a new house for you brand new amen we're so thankful for that that no matter what comes we're in the great Shepherd's hands stand with me this morning Amen Brother David I'd like to sing that way maker song if we could at least that one if you could amen if you know how let's bow our heads how many beli that Jesus is here he's in your heart he's in my heart anybody that's in here that's a genuine Christian has Jesus in their heart for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world now take a moment and think of what you need Deliverance or an escape from think of what your need is this morning Paul said my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Christ Jesus think about that need if you have a hand you want to raise up say God you know what I in need of I don't know about you but if I wouldn't have anything else I would say Lord more of you Lord I want more of you father Lord Deliver us all help us all to escape from our first nature and let the second man rule let the first man be dead and the second one man have have to preeminence so to speak the white dog let him be fed so much until the black dog is starved to death Lord you see the hands that are up they defy gravity and they rais their hands to you and you see that hand you see that heart you see the mind you see what they're asking for just now Lord and help them to believe right now God that it's their possession it's their property that you paid for on Calvary it would be an insult for us not to accept our healing it would be an insult for us not to accept our Salvation when he died for it when he went and paid the ultimate price for us so now we accept Lord Jesus every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line Lord continue to refine us continue to mold us and shape us into your image for we know that soon you're coming God and you're going to help us to escape this world by giving us a body change we're going to escape this tribulation period by what we believe to be the Rapture will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump we which are alive and remain shall be CAU up together to meet them in the air care and so shall we ever be with the Lord When We Get Over Yonder we're going to say like we did on this side Thou Art Worthy Lord to receive honor and glory and power and strength for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created Lord we thank you God for your grace in our lives Lord Jesus if there's anyone in here God that hasn't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not saved Lord I ask God that you would do a work of Grace in their lives and that they would believe help them to doubt their doubts they might think oh I'm not saved I'm not filled with the Holy Ghost I'm not worth don't let them think them things they're your child they're it's their right they can because if they don't and they they doubt they send themselves to hell and Lord help them to believe God that it's for them for we ask these things in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and everybody said amen amen
