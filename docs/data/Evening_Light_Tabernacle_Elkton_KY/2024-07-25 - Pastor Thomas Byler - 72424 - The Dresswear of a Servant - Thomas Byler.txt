a timely fashion Lord you know just what we have need of hearing and then Lord we just thank you and may we receive it may we receive our healing may we go from here a better people than what we was when we came Lord and if that's truly what happens then we have been been been edified in the Church of God on this Wednesday night bless those that are listening and streaming Lord and those that will stream it father may they be blessed Lord as we read your word now we thank you Father for your word and for what it means to us in Jesus name amen and amen Isaiah 6 and verse one in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon the Throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and the one Cried unto the other and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory now REM remember that the whole earth is full of his glory amen so if you're in the earth you are around his glory amen one and uh verse four and the posts of the door moved at the voice that cried of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell amongst the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he had laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also I heard the voice of Lord saying who shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight amen we will amen I was thinking of trying to condense this a little bit amen the message tonight and I thought back there if you was a good preacher amen I thought you'd uh you wouldn't get past just the first step amen but anyway we'll just say what the Lord wants us to say and go from there is that okay amen so tonight amen and I want to read uh let me just read a quote here if I may amen we'll start right there how about that she found that in my pictures today and put it oh my gracious this ain't supposed to go off for 15 minutes amen but anyway she put that up there let me just uh start with a quote before I tell you my my title amen and the sermon that we're going to basically teach out of tonight is going to be an influence 1963 0803 amen 0803 and 63 brother Brandon preached a message called influence and we want to just do a little study with the help of the Lord out of that and I say that because for some reason I don't know why but amen I it came to my heart came to my mind about this scripture amen and those wings that those angels had and I was like well what what does the Lord want me to preach on and so I begin to study that and it just begin to flow so amen for some reason or other amen it's a certainly a subject that we all know well amen amen the subject of influence amen but we just want to go over it amen and just study it for a little bit for tonight amen and maybe maybe somebody needs it is that right how many believe that's how God works amen surely there'll be somebody that needs it amen and so we're thankful that God does work that way we believe that's how church works I mean that's why we have a live Ministry isn't that right so that the Holy Spirit can get right down where we live and speak to who he wants to speak to amen amen and say what he once said amen so now and this is way in this is 13 23 paragraphs in in already but I thought it was a good way to start now what a real servant that is of god he see he showed the prophet how his prepared servant should be what should a prepared servant be now these servants uh look at he says he looked at a man on Earth here and see what a failure he had made then God showed him a Kingdom in Heaven a throne that's the one to look at then he showed him what a real servant ought to be that served in his presence and here was the seraphim then covered their holy faces covered their feet and with two Wings they went into action reverent humble and in action amen if that ain't a dressed up servant I don't know what is amen humble and in action oh my I tell you so my title is amen the servant of God's the the dress Weare of a servant the dress Weare of a servant amen and you know I like I like this because it's it's it's it's not real deep you know it's not really hard it's not it's just three different things one is humble reverent and in action amen and so if God so seen fit to create seraphim which brother Braham said there's cherubims then there's sarap which I think he said somewhere in here amen that they were like handlers of fire or burners burn ERS and so forth amen that that's what they were and of course we know what they did there is they got a coal of live fire and they touched the prophet amen and that fire made him pure as could be amen and so brother bam says you know of course we understand that it takes the fire of the Holy Spirit to clean you and I also how manyan believes if that fire doesn't ever touch you amen you can't really exper uh uh expect to be clean takes the five of God to burn out any filth that's in you but here um and let me just give I'm I'm going to read a little bit that okay amen and we're going to try to follow some of my some of my numbers and the way that I've got it down first let's find out a little bit about Uzziah Uzziah the king isn't that right because this is in the year that King Uzziah died amen it was talking Isaiah was talking here and he had that how he went into the temple of God and he begin to see am mean see what was was there God opened up his eyes now let's go back in the background of Uzziah brother bam says it this way Uzziah the King was a Shepherd boy he was a very young fellow amen and a King's son that loved the outdoors the woods and he was a herdsman and he also liked The Vineyards and he liked to see things grow and this young F was brought up under a real good influence amiah his father had been a great man in his last days he let down a little bit and picked up some Gods from another country and the Lord had taken him off the Earth but this young fellow had a good influence because his mother was a daughter of Jerusalem and his father was a Believer and therefore the boy had been raised up with a good influence amen and that's the good way to bring up your child he says in the way that it should go and you know what your children of the one of the main ones that's watching you they watch what you do whatever you do they copy after you because you're sitting the example before them amen a little bit more here now notice he says now that's what was made him such a great example to this young Prophet at the same time Isaiah now Isaiah the prophet lived in the days of Uzziah the king and both of them being young together the prophet and the King they were great Chums together and Isaiah stayed in the palace and leaned upon the arm of the king and we find out that this young fellow's influence influenced Isaiah he says and he become a hero to Isaiah because it made no difference to the uh to in the people whatever he never let anything sway him from one side or to the other he was determined to serve God and to serve God alone and that's a good person to take an example of Praise the Lord amen and we find out that he never compromised with any of the Heathen Worlds the Heathen world and so forth after they seen him build his kingdom so great and God was with him in blessing him and God will bless any man that'll stay with his word that's right God is Duty bound to do that to bless any man that will stay with God's word so we see how that Isaiah um Isaiah and Uzziah grew up together and I don't think I've got it here but we know I I think brother bam said that Uzziah became king at like 16 years old and we know that he became a great man isn't that right and we know the story of him and how that he lived and become very very prosperous amen but you know he got lifted up is't that right he got lifted up Amen in Pride amen he got lifted up in Pride amen listen that's where he got in trouble we'll get into the thought of humility tonight and then we want to get into the thought of reverence and then also with the help of the Lord we'll try to get all the way over in and into action amen now let me back up just a little bit before we go on talking about this man that got lifted up and so forth amen uh first of all I can only imagine you can only imagine in your mind these seraphim amen with wings that covered their feet feet is that right I don't know where they would be attached to amen maybe up here and reaching down right and then perhaps of course you think about maybe a Wings being right here by your arms cover their face is't that right or maybe there's maybe they're up up a little higher because maybe we could let's just say that the wings for flying is your arms that would make more sense wouldn't it we're just doing a little imagining here is that all right to try to figure out what we're going to do with all six wings that's a bunch of wings on a person ain't it or an angel six wings that's a lot of flying ability right there but with two of them they covered their feet there two of them am me they covered their face and with two they did fly and you know God doesn't make things uh that doesn't have any significance everything that he makes is very very significant the prophet here picks this up and he begins to preach many sermons on influence and so forth and and what can happen to a person amen and we want to want to first of all we want to go down the road of humility amen if you're going to be God's servant the first thing that we have to have is humility now humility is the opposite of what Pride there's pride and then there's humility now Uzziah stayed humble for a very long time but he was very blessed he was very blessed of God and he prospered greatly but one day he got lifted up one day he allowed Pride to come in brother BR Bo about have to listen to this talks about preachers that you know perhaps be get famous or be have a congreg and they think they can do anything they want to and get away with it no no no no they get lifted up in Pride he says be careful it's one of the dangers isn't that right same way with uh uh uh anyway so let me go on and when they now listen when a man or a woman no matter whether he's a bishop or a cardinal or whatever he might be when you begin to feel that yourself Reliant then you better begin to watch and to take heat because see God won't let you go on like that because he will not share his glory with another no sir God takes his glory how many believes that to God be the glory and God alone sometimes God can bless a man and give him a little ministry that's been a little better than his brothers or maybe not better but just something a little different from his Brethren amen think about around the message now little better than his Brethren and the first thing you know that man becomes exalted with his chest out and Oh my he would he would brush you off in the street see that's the time that I believe that man is started out the door cuz God can't use a person like that amen and though this King though he'd be a Godly Man as he was he felt self-sufficient he felt like that he could hoist himself up in Pride and that he could take over and do whatever that he wanted to do and he didn't have to ask anybody amen my my my he got lifted up in Pride didn't he not something that you want to do see the problem with the world is is they have a pride problem and I was thinking of how when you're younger when you're a teenager when you're 20 30 40 you're in a peak of health and strength and boy you can just become proud and think you're invincible and is that right you feel like you're invincible and if you aren't careful you'll be Li get lifted up in Pride when when you get a little older and you begin to lose your strength and you get feeble humility begins to set in you realize you're not what you used to be amen but but the thing of it is that we got to remember is that even though you're maybe in the prime of Youth and the prime of strength amen the secret to absolutely being able to serve God successfully and I hope this is what we get across to everybody and I'm sure we all are here tonight Desiring to be used of God isin that right to be God's servant and to be successful at it and so the one thing that you must have is recognition of what you are of who you are you have to put yourself in the right place humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and he will exalt you in due season but first you have to be brought down you have to realize how how what you really are that's just a little bit of dirt you're some you're dust you made out of the Dust of the Earth and so now and I and I I be I thought that and when I when I was thinking about it then when I studied this brother bam came across this and I thought it was such a good example that I want to just read you what he said see even brother bandam says a man that's born of a woman is a few days and full of troubles and the living now know that they have to die ain't that right and we know that it was once appointed to man to die and after that the Judgment so so we know that we must he says I don't want to live in this old pest house that I'm living in it catches every disease that floats through I want one that's not made pans fashioned after God that's not a hybrid plant like this I want one that's made by the hands of God that diseases and sickness and death goes from it that's right whenever he s summons me I'm ready by the grace of God believing that when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that we move into it that cannot die no more amen all right we're going to go on to the next one here and we look here we see that we're they're just a shadow anyhow we are a shadow I look on the platform I see men that moves I look in the streets and see women that moves they got life but yet it cannot be real life brother bam says that it's just a shadow I think Peter said it's a vapor that appears for a while and then it vanishes away brother bam says the life that we're now living in it's just a shadow amen before you can ever become humble you got to look at something you got to recognize that you're not always going to be here that you come and that you're going to be gone and it won't be long and you'll be just basically in the grave so get the right to put things in perspective don't it and then something how he brings this out my my where how much better off everybody would be if they' put things in perspective realizing that they're just amen it's just a sh people wouldn't do the stuff they do amen if they get a little bit of humility but they live like going to live forever amen all right so I don't know all right thought I made some examples now listen to so what he says he says and David like David said because death's it cannot be real life because it's death in it David said I'll walk through the valley of the shadow of death now it takes so much light to make a Shadow there has to be so much light if it's allog together Darkness it don't make a Shadow see it has to be so much light in the dark to make a Shadow if I see a man walking fin looking young man in a few years his hair turns gray and slips out his shoulders droop down if you don't mind brother Glenn you're 70 what uh come on up here Michael come up here would you stand up here amen now they're a little bit they're a little bit different they're a little bit different heights but let's just say we don't know you don't know what uh uh brother Glenn looked like when he was his age do we we'd have to have a picture but let's just look here's how you doing brother Glenn we're going to call him Glenn for a minute boy brother Glenn you look awfully good you ain't got no wrinkles no gray hair you're Stout you're ready to go look at that belly there that right looking good huh that's right but what happen but I'm looking at a young man young man a few years his hair turns gray slips out in just a few years brother fam says look at what happens ain't that right wait till we get our new body that's right we're going back to that h aren't we right but brother bam says see see s you might think oh and look in that in the same amount of years this brother here he's probably going to look a lot like him ain't that right give it give it a little time folks and then man it all turns it changes don't it amen so get right look at it in the right perspective thank you brother Michael amen Glenn amen so brother B says look at that a beautiful young girl standing with a saintly Godly face on her who can we use sister Sherry are you GNA be the old version Elena Elena let's get Elena up here she's real young yet ain't that right you all are about the right height so what I'm preaching might match up pretty good amen now we we you know we don't know what sister Sherry looked like back then that we now but let's just say hi sister share you boy you're look at look at that turn that way a little bit look at that nice flower just just beautiful brother M say a beautiful young woman standing there with saintly Godly face amen standing there and praise God and come back in a few years find out we're stoop shouldered ain't that right stoop shouldered packing two or three children well now that's down to the road yet Ain that right but any it shows that that body there is death in it no matter how well it's taken care of how lovely look it still got death in it thank you sisters I appreciate it amen so how many know look at life people if you just realize hey you're not always gonna be I'm not always going to be here I'm not always going to be preachers I think of many times of brother bandam how hard he preached we listen to his tapes but look at where he is today wouldn't it be nice to have him come and preach for us still no but he's gone the work is done and he realized that work was done so he did all that he could while he was here how many believes that's what we need to do we need to have the right perspective realize hey folks it ain't going to be long amen isn't long before amen it'll cause you to Humble it humbles you realize hey you know don't be so proud don't think you're invincible and everything else amen but get the right perspective on things amen shows that there is death in the body now another point now I want you to watch which way the spirit in there leans amen yeah how many believes it's important which way the spirit of anybody leans if it's a spirit representing light speaking of light talking of the light will walk in the light touch a beautiful light preach it brother hello anden it shows there's a reflection coming it's going back to the light but if something in there is of the darkness and influence by the world brother baham says there's nothing but for it to turn back into darkness when it dies into outer Darkness so you see so you see what we are we must remember that we are only what we are by the grace of God none of us can brag about it we can only bow in adoration and humility before God and give praise to him for his goodness wouldn't it be nice if everybody in the world would do that be humble and realize you were coming back going back to the dust that we came from but our spirit's going back to God where it come from and we ought to give him praise we ought to give him glory and the honor that's do him that's what God created man for and there's just a small group here doing it my isn't it sad amen now adoration and humility and we find that as long as this King felt that way God blessed him but when he got to a place that he wanted to not abide in his own calling but he wanted to take the calling of somebody else and he thought because that God had blessed him that it was all right that he could do it but how sadly we make that mistake oh how bad my he says You must absolutely be honest you mustn't you mustn't do anything unless God has directed you to do it and proves it and vindicates it and you know that it's God that done it amen somebody believe that when God calls you to something when he places you in something stay there don't take somebody else's calling now brother bam had a real problem with that Ain that right because he had the businessmen trying to get into Pulpit he said even in this message there's a lot of preachers out there ought to be in the Pulpit he say you businessmen stay out of the puppet why do you ain't got got a hard enough time keeping it straight amen otherwise what happens there's a lot of impersonation that comes around ain't that right all right praise the Lord so we see and we notice that this King and another thing we learned from here from Uzziah that when he was called down by the man who had the authority to take the sensor in the consecrated man for the service when he called him down he got angry with him amen oh what a cursive thing that would be when a man tries to point out to a fellow that you're in the wrong and prove it to him by the word of God you're in the wrong and then that man because he feels in himself he'll do what he wants to he won't submit to the word then he gets angry amen praise the Lord if you'll notice what happened to the king leprosy broke out on his face while he was still in his anger lepry struck Isa Uzziah in the face and the priest and those recognized and threw him out of Temple and he died a leper that great life that started out so well ended up be to be a leper cast out and had to live in a separate house out to himself all the days of his life that man and theight in God had once influence amen one once an influential life now he was an outcast and everything and I'd say with respects we got men today in the field young men middle-aged men old men who started out on a good run and tried and made a go good shto God but we find them today out y under alcoholics and broke up amen there in the other away from us some of them backslid all together some of them me money crazy some of them went women and crazy and married other women that wasn't their wives all the things and the the disgrace that's been brought on every denomination we one can't tell one from the tell the other bad because they're all guilty every denomination we found men like that that's once influenced by God had a great influence to the people and yet they felt self-sufficient how many knows that part of humility is submitting yourself to the word of God submitting yourself to the truth how many those those Pharisees did had too much pride amen and pride brought what what did Pride they were they thought they were something they want the when they made prayers they made long prayers to be heard of men they love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and to them when Jesus come along he was some some woman that wasn't married when she got pregnant and she he was an illegitimate child to them that's what they thought of him and and when he come doing Miracles and and wonders Amen in a humble humble like he was they just couldn't receive it because of the pride that they had cuz how many knows that when the truth comes from all those churches out there with the prophet of God when God came they should all humbled themselves and said yes that's the truth but they had too much pride pride is a terrible thing folks it kept let me just say this this Pride led the Pharisees to jealousy their jealousy LED them to hatred and their hatred LED them to murder is that where it goes that's where Pride takes you that's where sometimes when you're telling people about the baptism and the the father son the holy ghost that nobody ever was some of them people some of them that you'll meet they'll get Plum mad at you you recognize right then that that's not the spirit of God that's a devil in there amen amen a spirit of Pride they they don't want to Humble themselves to the truth you got to humble yourself to the truth where would they be at today if they had just humbled themselves to the truth I believe that's what every one of us come to church for and if the word says it prophet of God said it we say amen I don't care if you're doing something contrary to don't try to justify yourself cuz that's a lot of people do it people in the message they'll find a quote they'll find this that or do they to justify themselves but they're still not right they're just too proud to submit my my all right we won't go down that road too far Pride came in amen oh my 61 where we're at praise the Lord many disgraces come many disgraces from people who still want to have their own way and won't humble themselves ain't that right listen when a man gets to a place where he can influence for God he ought to Humble himself all the time constantly how many knows God dwells in humil and we are to clothe ourselves the way he did with humility that's supposed to be our dress wear what we clothe ourselves with is humility and the one thing that God helped the prophet of God to do all of his life is that right was stay humble when I was back in the office I was thinking about this and I remember brother brandham saying something to his children about great men that came out of Kentucky was it one of them Abraham Lincoln who was the other one Daniel Boone maybe all right Daniel Boone and and Abraham Lincoln and then he went to say and your dad y'all now brother baham said that but he says no no that that's not right I don't need to feel that way ain't that right go listen to it he says no no no don't don't start getting lifted up in Pride even though we know that's the truth ain't that right even though we know the truth but there was a thought trying to come in to try to make him get lifted up amen how many believ we all got to watch that got to watch that Pride coming in amen all right now and we find out that this King died in disgrace a leper leper and he was a lesson to the young Prophet not to put hopes upon any man but to look to God only when he begin to look at a man for an example this man failed yet being a good man and we find out that the king died in disgrace of leper leper and he was a lesson to the young Prophet not to put his hopes upon any man but to look to God only now how many knows we do brother Bram taught he knows that we all are influenced by each other we influence each other isn't that right people around the message have great preachers and this great preacher never ever put your confidence in a man amen you have confidence in him as far as you know you're trusting he'll stay true and but brother B says man is so full of failures do you realize when brother bham said that told the story of how that he married a couple of couples and and later on he was going and checking on them seeing how they was doing ain't that right and they came up close to the house and he heard him inside and he just kind of hung outside and listened to him a little bit well that woman never he she completely rejected the message because she thought he was like a Peeping Tom or a you know this side or the other can you imagine he was being honest no he just stopped for a minute to listen to see how their conversation really was remember he said that to the rich the Richer ones he stopped at their house and boy they were even there fussing about this that and fussing about that he knocked on the door finally and they opened up and said oh how you doing brother bam how y'all getting along oh we're doing just wonderful but said no be honest but the other couple you know the poor couple as we know he says oh honey I really wanted to get that dress for you with the money that I had this week but I just can't quite do it and she says oh I don't need that we're just I'm just fine yeah but I really wanted to get he says now there's a real couple right there is know right it wasn't anything evil about it he's just wanted he cared for people amen but because of of person's pride and everything else look where it got him look at where it got them Pharisees and the scribes even though they realized Jesus couldn't do these things unless God was with him but it just didn't fit their criteria and their frame of mind in the way that they were thinking they weren't ready willing to Humble their minds down to hey you know what we're wrong he's right amen boy that goes for this generation a't that right that goes for this generation what a lesson for the young Prophet all the hopes look to God I like that as you see for a long time he had influence he influenced Isaiah and Isaiah had confidence in Uzziah and all this but then that all fell apart and he went into the temple and he learned what he's supposed to look at doesn't matter what preacher we don't want any preacher to fall we don't want anybody to fall but if they do then where do you stand is't that right then is your real confidence in a man or is it in God Amen brother brandom how many knows he had faults he had failures amen that he told what the failures and the faults were amen sure we're full of failures and faults my un so listen so that's a lesson to us tonight to keep our minds upon God regardless of what man it is let him be Cardinal or priest or Prophet or whatever it might be he is not immune from M from mistakes and error and even death and sin but there's one who is and that's Jesus Christ he's immune from all of that amen but this Isaiah learned a lesson God orders his man to his place amen listen and the man no man has a right to take up and say well I'd make an easy living if I was a minister I believe I'll study the ministry I believe I'll do this that or the other I believe if I would impersonate this gift of God has given brother Bram said many of them impersonated him ain't that right I'll have great compan compa so forth we see so much of that today amen now listen so what a change where are we at number 70 what a change what a change what an influence this must have been upon this young Prophet when he saw the failure of man and though although good men would fail but now he sees God and he sees these seraphim and notice the special covering of these seraphim had they was covered with two Wings over their face two wings of their feet and two was for flying wings God is all together holy think of it even angels has to cover their holy face to stand in the presence of God I wonder my brother I wonder my sisters if we'll look at that when Holy Angels has to cover their face to stand in the presence of God in reverence and respect amen and I thought of that I thought you know before I even begin to study I thought what is reverence I thought to me reverence is respect so when I heard brother Bram said I thought well my mind must be on the right Channel with reverence and in respect but today we find people who call themselves Christians even has no respect at all for God or his word or his people or his ministry or nothing where are they going to come up at in the Resurrection the Bible says if the righteous scarcely be saved where will the Sinner and the ungodly appear so how many believes it's important to Keep Your Eyes Upon Jesus keep your eyes on God how many believes that we can see God we can see God in his Universe all the Earth is filled with his glory you can see him in the trees you can see him in these things and as I was studying today something unique happened something happened that I never had happened before and I just kind of followed it and I begin to write what it's like to see God Amen and so I don't know if it's a Psalm or if a song or a Psalm or what it is but I'm going to share it with you I told my wife on the way to here I said I feel like the Lord just give me something I don't know what it is but I'm going to share with everybody tonight amen this is what I wrote right here in the middle of my sermon today as I begin to thinking about when you look at God can you see God all around you it says look at God in the oceans amen the fish the great whales all that there is out there so unique isn't that look at God in the oceans and in every motion because this week I was thinking of the uniqueness of how God has designed everything every motion every motion was designed by God the smile moving of the hands every motion look at God in the oceans look at the fish to see and in every motion every fiber and Divine Design amen knowing that it wasn't yours or mine makes me fall on my knees to give reverence and respect and humility amen now let me speak of your Divinity because of the fire that you have placed in me like the woman at the well let me also live to tell of your love for those who fell amen amen and that's as far as it went amen it has three paragraphs amen I thought that's right Lord let me live like the woman at the well because brother brandham in this message says you know she went into action ain't that right when it came to action and he she saw the sign of the Messiah amen she ran into the City and it says the city believed on on him because of what you had testified amen says you can't put it out amen when there's a fire oh boy here I go all the way back to the end of my sermon amen when whenever there's a fire lit amen it's like trying to put a fire out brother bams has a house fire on a windy day woo so let me lift to tell of your love for those who fell amen now notice all right people don't have any respect do they to have God all around the glory of God the Sun going oh my wouldn't it be something brother Tommy if we'd say now we don't know for sure if it's going to be 7:15 5:15 or just what time the sun's going to come up tomorrow we're going to go to we're going to wait till the sun comes up and then go to work cuz it might be 9 9:30 you know the next day it might be 4:00 in the morning Roost is CW lights up the next day it's not till noon the sun comes up that's these atheist philosophy of the Big Bang of something just happened happened but we know how many knows that it takes a Divine Creator a Divine designer to make it absolutely in a 100 years from now they can tell you when that Sun's Rising wo when I think about his Divine Design oh it's divine all around God everywhere but they ain't got no respect that's why they live like they do they ain't nobody worth a time that ain't got respect for God how do we ever how does the world expect people to have any kind of character outside of the Bible and outside of Jesus Christ that's why we come to church to work on our character to work on our morals to work on what we're supposed to work on they throw it all out now you see what they got oh here we go brother brandham when he seen these beat neck boys with these bangs with these little bangs I guess they had some care right here a little bit right he just these boys that don't know which F side of the fence they belong on what would he say now what is that where did that come from I'll be good I'll be good bogy man don't scare me like that huh scary it ain't no pains anymore walking around and dresses and go through to drive through it you don't know if what it is I thought about Colin said there was somebody that looked like you I thought what would it be like if I if I I thought about going up time says what do you identify as it was so bad I thought about questioning him what do you identify you look like one of those that you know identify something I'll tell you what they identify as I'll call it if you don't know what you are I'll just call you well you're a it you're just something that's sad ain't it amen I hope Trump does it get a little trumpy tonight brother I told my wife I'm dressing a little trumpy tonight David and them said now you got to have a darker blue at least he'll come out he says he'll come out what he's going to do is keep the boys keep the men out of the women's sports isn't that something didn't brother say with politicians man people will just say well if they want this give them if they want that give them they said no he says let's give some men who have some backbone and stand for something how many knows it's a real breath of fresh air to hear somebody say we're going to take the men out of the women's sports we'll probably get a lot of hits on this one probably some angry hits that's all right you don't know what side of the fence belong on you've lost your mind back to our thought we got a couple good things here can we go a little longer tonight this is a Sunday morning one but we've had all Sunday mornings lately isn't that all right is't that good have all Sunday morning Services that's right praise the Lord okay all right what a change now where we're at 71 praise the Lord no reverence people ain't got no reverence do they no respect that's what the world lacks reverence first you got to be humble then you got to have some respect for God if you really want to be a man you really want to be a woman have respect for God realize he's here he's everywhere he's watching you he's not off somewhere on a distant land he's right here oh I got a few more points I got to make we notice today that because that people they have no reverence to come to church people will come to church and cut up and laugh how many knows that's why we have church order that's why we try not to talk in the congregation in the sanctuary here out of respect they'll talk they'll chew cheing um sitting where the gospel is being preached no reverence at all and meet you in the street you don't any expect any respect from people we must do that but yet it shows Christian dignity to at least honor the people and say good morning brother Brandon when he went down the road he waved at everybody didn't he did you ever try that I have just wave at everybody you're still in Kentucky we're back on 106 people will actually wave at you once in a while the rest of them are like what in the world I don't know you look at you funny huh but some of them wave anyway brother that's just Christian dignity what do you do when you go to Walmart brother Matthew passing everybody out I'll tell you what if I don't want to salute everybody I just kind of keep my head down and keep going what I'm doing I'm I'm just doing my thing but if I happen to pass you how you doing how you doing hey they'll look at you like do I know you most of them some people here in Kentucky yet they'll not to you how many believe that have have a little bit of dignity at least recognize people people don't recognize each other anymore that's right people won't say good morning hello can you imagine going to Walmart and everybody you pass by hello hello hello hello you'd be considered a weirdo but it's human dignity Christian dignity how many believes we need to have respect amen that's what's happened with our politics no respect isn't that right all right you don't listen say good morning brother or whatever you wish to some of them will Pro hell well hello preach oh if that ain't common but Bram didn't like that too well remember Jesus says As you do Under the one of these you've done it unto me amen and the irreverence you know what it is De not conscience of the presence of God the world has become so common and religion has become such a lowb until there's no respects just as it's always been how many knows if the Pharisees had a real respect for God when they knew that your man couldn't do that outside of God they they went they went and listen to him s Nicodemus isn't that right Nicodemus came to him but night he had enough respect to at least sneak to him none of the others did huh to come to him at night and ask what is the way what must I do and so forth is that right that's right but not conscious and I wanted to say this that God is everywhere God is present many knows God is everywhere God is here but people can't feel it in their conscience can they he can be right up against people he can be everywhere the air that they breathe is the glory of God how many know he has those trees out there making so much oxygen he created the world with the right oxygen level and everything so you could live not have to wear a mask but they don't recognize it God is almost everywhere except for people's heart except for people's heart and their conscience they're not conscience of God conscious of God because let me say it this way because God isn't in their conscience how many believes God needs to be in your conscience then you'll be conscience of God and then you'll be like the prophet and you'll see him everywhere you'll see him in the trees you'll see him in the wolf you see them everywhere why because you're in the presence of God because the presence of God is where in you how many believes we as children of God Amen are in the presence of God and then we have to stay humble and realize that even Paul amen thought about getting lifted up and he wanted he wanted to get highing God and he wanted to go up and God kept him humble isn't that right kept him down wow God keeps us down keep us as humble oh boy I missed some but that's okay didn't even Jesus with the Rich Young Ruler try to Humble him one place he says if a man isn't willing to forsake all to follow me can you can you imagine that Rich Young Ruler he just say you want me to sell everything I got I'll have nothing I'll be a nobody huh it was more than he could do Jesus was trying to Humble him he needed to become a nobody so that God could make something out of him because we got to recognize true humility is recognizing that it's not about you hello it's about him and what he does through you the way up brother baham says he's down he took Paul that proud Pharisee he said I was a Pharisee of the Pharisee I was zealous for Israel and so forth and he persecuted the Christians but after Jesus come and talk to him he humbled him isn't that right then God could use him he had to become the very thing that he persecuted and he had to confess with his mouth the thing that I persecuted I have become real realizing that I did it in my ignorance Moses the great man of God remember he was to be the next Pharaoh God had to Humble him he had to take him on the backs side of the desert for 40 years to take that out of him God help us take all of me out of me help me realize it's not me amen you're not the designer I'm not the designer he's the designer we come into His design not him into our design that's what the churches in this world and the denominations of this time they should all recognize that that was of God they should all humbled themselves because it lack of humility it was a matter of Pride and things that caused them not to accept the message this hour amen all right we'll hurry they're not conscious of the presence of God Amen look at them soldiers we could think tonight what a irrational and a horrible thing it was for those soldiers put a rag over his face of the Lord to make fun of him being a prophet and could know the secrets of the heart they put a rag over his face set him in the courtyard took a stick and struck him on the head and passed it one to another said if you be a prophet tell us which one of us hit you see no respects at all how many know that's why people don't get God is because they ain't got no respect for him buddy Robins said he has so much respect he says God if you don't come and fill me with the Holy Ghost amen you'll F me dead these bones in this cornfield you'll find me on my bones had that much respect that's how much respect that people need that's how much reverence that we need if you really want to get a hold of God the woman at the well she had such respect not the woman at the well but the woman with the blood isue remember her oh they touched him they hit him and pull his beard out they didn't get nothing but the woman just Touch the Hem of His Garment how many believes that's the way it is you come to church come to church have reverence say Lord let that preacher say something that I need you know what I have need of and when God speaks to that need raise your hand say Lord I accept it touch the ham of His Garment and be made whole all you got to do is Touch the Hem of His Garment it's about respect people haven't got no respect living in his glory well I just finish tonight out on this living in the sunshine a't that right living in the warmth drinking water all from God enjoying Health enjoying life all come from God but they won't even recognize him say we come from monkeys can you imagine brother Joshua it's probably a good thing we ain't God get him a tail we have him Ching like a monkey in the drop of a hat you want to talk about a monkey I'll make you a monkey that's right oh my I could preach now can you do you realize how easy it would be for God to convince the whole world that he is God oh he could in a heartbeat he could do it in a heartbeat amen just like that that one guy that said a bunch of bad stuff about his friend's religion and Jesus Christ and all those bad things happened he got back up there says I ain't even GNA say him ain't that right that's right God convinced him and right and he could do that to the whole world can you IM imagine if people up there am mean says no we come from monkeys and right there in front of everybody zap he turns into a monkey and everybody every maybe everybody maybe a bunch of them B say yeah that's right they all turned into monkeys everybody rais your hand believe that they all turned into monkeys can you imagine the rest of them that didn't they'd say whoa there is a God there is a God God could convince this world but guess what he don't want you to have to he don't want you to believe that way no he wants you to have faith he wants you to have faith to believe whether you see anything or not God is still God that's what pleases God you don't have to see it you believe it anyway even doubting Thomas got rebuked isn't that right unless I touch his hands and unless you put my nail scar in his hands and he decide I'm not going to believe W thank God for Mercy for Thomas ain't that right Jesus showed up and says come here Thomas put your hands in here but you here you go amen this is what comes to my mind in that situation Thomas this is just me felt so bad about what happened he loved the Lord so much he didn't want him to go but he did and he wanted to see him so bad that he says I'm not going to believe it unless I see it I want to see him you see God knew what was really in Thomas's heart that's why he forgive him because if he would have been a unbeliever it had been a different story Thomas was not an unbeliever he believed but there's a reason just like Paul he persecuted and so to speak blasphemed against the Church of God God should have taken him for what he did against the Church of God ain't that right for what he did against the works of the Holy Ghost but Paul later come and says he says you know the reason God forgave me is because I did it in my ignorance and God seen that I did it in my ignorance but let me tell you this generation of people who seen the power of God it wasn't in their ignorance amen and God is the judge of who does it in their ignorance and who don't I got one more good point to make you want me to go a little bit longer oh my I think this is two more but that little woman within that Faith That Could Touch His Garment she got her desires you see we've got to be we've got to become conscious conscious of God's presence these little five senses that we live in that's just a little world of our own see that's we was only given those so that we could c contact this Earthly home but there is senses beyond that from other dimensions and another dimension I thought about what I preached on that the last time I preached on am me believing in Aliens and other worlds amen other dimensions so what is this sense what is this sense that's From Another Dimension and then Faith that's right we've got a sense of Faith it's not from this dimension what came to my mind when I was studying this it's from another world From Another Dimension God is always present we must remember that if we could only remember that that angels of the Lord are encamped about those that fear Him in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ in this building is hosts of Angels thousands of them gather around you don't see them but you can feel the influence of them how many believe we need to open up we need to open up our heart we need to be humble and we need to be respect realize God is here in one of the later scriptures that quotes just that down from maybe I have it here I'm not sure but he says that's what I try to get people to believe that Jesus is here that God is here if you have need of something he's here to minister to you how many believe that that he's ever present amen gather around but you can feel the influence of them telling you that they are here if that isn't so the scripture isn't so if the scripture isn't right then God isn't right the Bible isn't right the angels of God are encamped they don't leave they stay right near those that fear Him Jesus said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in their midst that makes him in the world that we cannot see that our five senses doesn't contact but Jesus Christ is here present if we could just be conscious of that how many believe that just as Isaiah went into the presence of of God ain't that right and when he got in there he realized I am a man of unclean lips I among people of unclean lips isn't that how we feel Lord I'm not perfect and I live in the world that's not perfect but come and touch me amen take the fire of the Holy Ghost let the Angels come and touch me with that fire and I'll be clean because that's the only way you'll get clean amen and remember not only here but when you're walking down the street wherever you are you that professes to be Believers and fear the lord remember the angels of God are moving with you wherever you are they watch everything you do every thought that go through your mind they know all about you therefore we must be conscious of that listen before we can influence we've got to recognize God we've got to be clean we've got to be humble we've got to get ourselves down and know and just keep imagining how knowing how little that you are you are nothing I am nothing and none of us is nothing but he is all and he is worthy of all praise Glory hello oh Lamb of God what we need to do go back to the temple we need to go back to the altar of God and to make an altar in our own Hearts where we can surrender ourselves and then we can see the Lord Jesus Lord God of hosts come down in these last days and do what he did when he was here first you'll understand when the coal of fire touched the prophet making him as pure as can breathe when the voice of God said who will go Forest then he answered Master here am I send me amen praise the lord we won't go into tonight we won't go into the last part into action because when coal of fire touches you how many believe it puts you into action you begin to testify of the power of God you begin to go and spread his Fame abroad You're Not Afraid like the disciples were on the book of the day of and and the day of Pentecost a't that right they waited in Jerusalem until they were lit by the fire when that fire touched them they come out of there no more waiting they humbled themselves they reverenced and they God filled them and they went out everywhere trying to win the lost and do what everything they can whatever God wanted them to do how many's with me let Lord here am I send me the whole world world is lost and dying musicians come on up if you would please amen I'm going to sing one verse one maybe two songs with you before leaving stand with me you've been sitting a little while hopefully we didn't keep you longer than what your
