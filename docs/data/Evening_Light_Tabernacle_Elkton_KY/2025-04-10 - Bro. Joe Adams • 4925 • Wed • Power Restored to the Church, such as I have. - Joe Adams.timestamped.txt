[20:34] Oh, the more I see of this
[20:39] world, the less it means to
[20:45] [Music]
[20:58] me. Well, good evening everyone.
[21:02] I'm telling you, I want to give you a
[21:04] praise report and I want to personally
[21:06] thank each and every one of you for your
[21:08] prayers. As you know, I think you might
[21:11] know Sunday night or Sunday afternoon a
[21:14] week ago, we were parking in a fast food
[21:18] place and all of a sudden I went crazy
[21:21] and I run over my handicap parking sign
[21:23] and right up over the curb through the
[21:26] gravel and Sherry told me I even ran
[21:29] went all the way back around and parked.
[21:31] I don't remember any of it. I remember
[21:33] hearing her, but she sounded like she
[21:35] was a thousand miles away.
[21:38] So, of course, our
[21:41] neurologist, I have these little
[21:43] strokes. He thought maybe it was a
[21:45] stroke. So, Monday, they put me in the
[21:49] uh MRI tube for an hour and a half, and
[21:52] that thing clunked and clunked and
[21:54] clunked. And then they brought me over
[21:57] for an EEG and they cooked up 32 leads
[22:00] to my brain. It turns out it was no
[22:02] stroke, it was a
[22:05] seizure. And it was because the left
[22:07] side of my brain is all scrambled up. So
[22:10] I'm going to work on the right side from
[22:12] now on. But unfortunately for me, I
[22:17] cannot drive for six months. So I'm at
[22:19] the mercy of my
[22:21] wife. And I begged her for a week to
[22:24] take me to Where's that place, honey?
[22:27] Where we buy the
[22:29] stuff? Uh, Rural King. Because I wanted
[22:32] me some trail mix. She finally broke
[22:35] down after a week and let me go buy
[22:37] trail mix. All right. So, anyway, you
[22:40] guys need to help me pray for her so she
[22:42] won't be so stubborn. Okay? And I want
[22:46] to praise the Lord. and he laid this
[22:49] song on my heart. And let me tell you
[22:52] something, it is no secret what God can
[22:56] do. Because look at what he's done to
[22:58] this 77y old fool standing up here. All
[23:01] right.
[23:02] [Applause]
[23:07] [Music]
[23:13] The chimes of time ring out the
[23:19] news.
[23:21] Another day is
[23:25] through. Someone slipped and
[23:31] fell. Was that some new
[23:37] you? You may have
[23:40] longed for added strength, your courage
[23:46] to
[23:49] renew. But do not be diseened.

[34:27] change an entire life. Lord, it can
[34:30] change an entire destination, Father. We
[34:33] could be going one way,
[34:35] Lord, and then all of a sudden, Father,
[34:37] one moment in your presence, completely
[34:39] turn around and and living a right life,
[34:42] Lord, heading down the right road,
[34:44] Father, making the right choices, being
[34:46] strengthened by the word for this hour.
[34:48] We're so thankful to be servants of the
[34:50] living God, to worship you tonight in
[34:53] spirit and in truth, to have a calling
[34:55] in our hearts and our lives. Lord, we
[34:57] have turned from unbelief to believe.
[34:59] And Lord, we have turned from doubt to
[35:01] faith. Lord, we have turned from sinners
[35:03] to be sons and daughters of God. And
[35:06] Lord, we just invite your presence to
[35:07] come tonight. Lord, you see that we have
[35:10] we have wearied ourselves with the daily
[35:12] affairs of life, taking care of uh the
[35:15] homes and different things of that
[35:16] nature. But Lord, tonight we just want
[35:18] to set all that aside and ask God that
[35:21] you would just speak through the vessel
[35:22] and you would speak to the ears of the
[35:24] hearer tonight that we can be in tune
[35:27] one with another. Lord, with the spirit
[35:29] of God and what you would have said for
[35:31] us tonight, we just commit our lives to
[35:33] you now. Father, we ask you bless this
[35:35] service. Bless every need. We pray in
[35:38] Jesus' name. Amen. If you have a need
[35:41] tonight, I want you to just lift your
[35:43] hand to God. But I want you got that
[35:45] need. And as I begin to take the word
[35:47] tonight and preach, I want you to hold
[35:51] that need over that the word as it goes
[35:53] forth because I believe the Lord really
[35:56] laid something on my heart for the
[35:57] service today. And as Brad said, we were
[36:00] been busy there trying to get the home
[36:02] situated and everything and we've really
[36:04] put every bit of energy we had into it.
[36:06] But I knew that God gave me a confidence
[36:08] you're going to preach this message
[36:09] tonight. So I just rested in that.
[36:13] And so I'm just believing for the
[36:15] supernatural tonight. How many you going
[36:17] to believe with me? Gideon, you going to
[36:18] believe with me tonight? We're going to
[36:20] believe for an outpouring of the spirit
[36:22] of God. It's a Wednesday night, but we
[36:23] can still invite the presence of the
[36:26] pillar of fire to be in our midst to
[36:28] still move in our lives. I believe he's
[36:30] a living God. I don't believe he's
[36:32] limited by a Wednesday or a Sunday or a
[36:34] Friday. I believe he's God every day of
[36:37] your life. If you'll just trust God,
[36:39] believe God, no matter the situation, no
[36:42] matter the trial, put God on the scene
[36:45] and God will show up and God will show
[36:47] out for you tonight. I just believe it,
[36:50] church. I want to preach to you tonight.
[36:52] Power restored to the church.
[36:56] Power restored to the church. How many
[36:59] of you in Elton, Kentucky ever lost
[37:01] power?
[37:04] Some of y'all don't have houses in, do
[37:05] you? Man, you know what it means when
[37:08] you lose power and you're just waiting.
[37:10] Everything's in the dark. Nothing's
[37:11] working. But when power is restored to
[37:14] the home, that's it. Woo! We got power
[37:18] again. The refrigerator's working. The
[37:21] lights are on. Hallelujah. We can see
[37:24] where we're going. What about power
[37:26] being restored back to the church of the
[37:28] living
[37:29] God? I'm telling you, we got more than
[37:32] energy power. We got more than co-op
[37:35] power. We got a supernatural power
[37:38] restored back to the
[37:40] church. Oh, the lights are on,
[37:43] somebody. Whatever you have need of in
[37:46] the house, you ain't got to worry about
[37:48] it being disconnected. There's an energy
[37:50] flowing through that current, through
[37:52] that line tonight. If you can trust God
[37:54] and believe,
[37:56] power has been restored back to the
[37:59] church of the living God.
[38:03] And for a subtitle, I want to call it
[38:05] this. such as I have.
[38:08] Now, let's get in the word. You seem
[38:10] prime for service tonight. Acts 3 and
[38:12] verse
[38:14] one. We're certainly honored to be
[38:18] here. And as brother Brad insinuated,
[38:21] and I think I did in January, our kids
[38:23] done went and did it. So, we going to be
[38:25] here a lot more.
[38:28] Y'all could have done a little bit
[38:29] better than that.
[38:30] [Applause]
[38:32] Come on. Give us a little bit.
[38:35] priming for us,
[38:37] honey. You're embarrassing me.
[38:40] That's all right. I'll come along. We'll
[38:42] have a good time. There's turkey season.
[38:44] There's deer season. I mean, there's all
[38:47] kinds of stuff we can do in Kentucky.
[38:49] Woo! I'm coming. All right. Acts 3 and
[38:52] verse one. Now, Peter and John went up
[38:54] together in the temple at the hour of
[38:56] prayer being the ninth hour. Notice they
[38:59] were attending service.
[39:02] Don't tell me you can have church at
[39:03] home because Peter and John were going
[39:05] to the house of God. They were going to
[39:07] make petitions and make their petitions
[39:09] known to God. We done got so
[39:11] supernatural, so spiritual in this hour,
[39:13] we don't need church.
[39:16] And find out where you'll be when you
[39:18] don't go to the house of God. Find out
[39:19] where you'll be when you're not making
[39:21] petitions known to God. Peter and John
[39:23] at the ninth hour went to the temple at
[39:25] the hour of prayer. And a certain man
[39:28] laying from his mother's womb was
[39:30] carried whom they lay daily at the gate
[39:32] of the temple which is called beautiful
[39:35] to ask arms of them that entered into
[39:37] the temple who seeing Peter and John
[39:39] about to go into the temple asked in
[39:42] arms. And Peter fastening his eyes upon
[39:45] him with John said look on us.
[39:50] Woo man,
[39:52] you get some preachers doing that today,
[39:54] telling you to look on me, look on this,
[39:56] and look on that. We snip these little
[39:58] things out and send it all around the
[40:00] world. Look what he's trying to do.
[40:01] Build his own kingdom. Peter wasn't
[40:04] about building his kingdom. He was about
[40:06] displaying the kingdom of God. He saw a
[40:10] man crippled. Let me tell you, there's a
[40:11] lot worse things you can be than
[40:13] crippled in your feet. You can be
[40:15] crippled in your spirit. You can be
[40:16] crippled in your soul. You can be
[40:18] creepled in your in your mentality
[40:20] toward the things of God. And Peter saw
[40:23] him and he said, "Look on
[40:25] us. Otherwise, take your eyes off your
[40:28] problem tonight. Take your eyes off your
[40:30] situation tonight. Take your eyes off
[40:32] your trial tonight and look on us for a
[40:35] minute."
[40:36] Peter done been somewhere, church. And
[40:38] if you'd been where Peter was, you'd had
[40:41] that same kind of fire, that same kind
[40:43] of passion, that same kind of
[40:44] confidence, that same kind of trust.
[40:47] Peter knew where he had just come from
[40:50] and he was ready to expose it or to
[40:53] share it to give it away. Notice now
[40:55] Peter put his eyes on. He said, "Look on
[40:57] us." And he he gave heed of them
[41:00] expecting to receive something of them.
[41:03] Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I
[41:06] none, but such as I have give I thee."
[41:10] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ of
[41:13] Nazareth, rise up and walk.
[41:17] Come on, you can do better now. ELT,
[41:21] in the name of Jesus Christ, whatever
[41:23] that need was that you lifted to God, in
[41:25] the name of Jesus, rise up and walk away
[41:28] free tonight. Walk away delivered
[41:31] tonight. Walk away healed tonight. Amen.
[41:36] And he took him by the right hand and
[41:38] lifted him up. And immediately his feet
[41:40] and ankle bones received strength. And
[41:42] he leaping up and he walked and he
[41:44] entered in with them into the temple
[41:47] walking, leaping and praising God.
[41:52] Oh, we're not supposed to act that way
[41:54] in church.
[41:56] [Music]
[41:58] Come on,
[41:59] man. What can we do on a Wednesday night
[42:02] when somebody gets set free? When
[42:05] somebody's crippled his leaves and they
[42:07] begin to leap up and walk and shout and
[42:10] praise God, but it's a Wednesday night.
[42:12] I don't care if it's a Tuesday night. He
[42:15] still deserves your praise. He still
[42:17] deserves your worship. It's God that
[42:20] breaks the chains off of our lives. It's
[42:23] God that raises you from a crippled
[42:26] [Applause]
[42:28] condition. There was nothing bashful
[42:30] about his worship.
[42:34] And all the people saw him walking and
[42:36] praising God. And they knew that it was
[42:39] he which sat for arms at the beautiful
[42:42] gate of the temple. And they were filled
[42:44] with wonder and amazement at that which
[42:46] had happened unto him. God bless you.
[42:49] You can have your seats. Unless you want
[42:51] to stand with me all night. We'll have
[42:53] church.
[42:55] Let's go.
[42:57] Hallelujah.
[42:59] I don't know about you, but I feel fired
[43:01] up tonight.
[43:03] Notice here in this section of scripture
[43:05] that I read, I had a brother reach out
[43:07] to me a while back and he says, "Is this
[43:10] the third pool in action?"
[43:13] I told a brother back I said if we are
[43:15] the people of the open book and we
[43:17] believe that Revelations 10 is truly to
[43:21] the bride of Jesus Christ and we are
[43:23] born again believers and we are a
[43:26] continuation of the book of Acts then I
[43:28] say yes sir we must fit this scripture.
[43:33] We must be a people in the end time
[43:35] operating under the fulfillment of the
[43:37] word of God. Come on somebody.
[43:41] But notice unbelief which is the enemy
[43:43] of our faith is prevalent to what?
[43:45] Hinder
[43:46] you hinder you from re receiving the
[43:50] promise of God or to even destroy your
[43:52] expectation. Can we have that in 2025?
[43:56] Can we have that in my church? Oh, we've
[43:58] we come from this church and they didn't
[44:00] act like it in this church. See, they
[44:03] try the spirit of the enemy is trying to
[44:05] destroy the expectation that we can have
[44:08] a revival.
[44:10] Come on church, get behind it tonight.
[44:13] Let me tell you, the devil is going to
[44:15] be there every step of the way to hinder
[44:17] you, to stop you, to prohibit you. But
[44:20] the bride of Jesus Christ, she has said
[44:23] the Lord, and the move is on, brother
[44:26] and sister. I say the move is on for for
[44:29] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[44:35] But the spirit of the enemy is there to
[44:39] always put your focus on something else.
[44:42] Whether that's a man or he's building
[44:43] his ideas and he's building his kingdom
[44:45] and he's doing this and he's doing that.
[44:47] But
[44:49] notice there is a scripture that we're
[44:51] going to get into tonight and we we find
[44:53] it in the book of
[44:54] Joel because Peter goes back to the book
[44:57] of Joel shortly after this. We find in
[45:00] Joel one it says that which the polymer
[45:02] worm had left the locust has
[45:05] eaten and that which the locust had left
[45:08] the cankerworm had eaten and that which
[45:11] the cankerworm had left the caterpillar
[45:14] has eaten. So we find that these four
[45:16] insects are the very same insect only in
[45:20] a different stage.
[45:23] Just like the believer, he can live in a
[45:27] justified stage, but he's got to
[45:29] progress to a sanctified stage. And from
[45:32] a sanctified stage to a Holy Ghost
[45:35] fililled stage. So it's the same insect
[45:38] through four different stages that we
[45:40] find this insect is about
[45:44] destroying, not building up, but
[45:46] destroying the bride tree. God planted a
[45:50] tree in the garden. God had a perfect
[45:52] tree. And we find what did the enemy
[45:54] come do? He came and defiled it. He
[45:56] become to eat on it and eat on it and
[45:58] eat on it. And we find brother Brandon
[46:00] would tell us the polymer, what did he
[46:02] do? He ate the fruit off the
[46:06] tree. Ate the fruit of joy. Ate the
[46:09] fruit of faith. Ate the fruit of
[46:10] brotherly love. Well, they don't go to
[46:12] my church and they believe this crazy
[46:14] idea and they did. And we can't have no
[46:17] fellowship with nobody because of all
[46:19] our separations.
[46:21] I ask you, where is brotherly love in
[46:23] any of that?
[46:25] If a tuxedo should put their arms around
[46:27] some overalls, where are we at in 2025?
[46:32] Somebody don't make as much money as we
[46:34] make. And we
[46:36] Oh, come on.
[46:38] Oh, we done got so dignified in the
[46:41] house of God. We We about like we were
[46:43] in junior high.
[46:46] Little status, little symbol, a little
[46:47] bit of money, a little bit of no money
[46:48] and all that.
[46:50] I keep them at arms length. They don't
[46:52] they don't make six figures.
[46:57] Okay. But notice the cankerorm or the
[47:00] polymer worm here eats off the brotherly
[47:03] love. Listen what your prophet say about
[47:06] it. He said all that Luther left the
[47:08] Methodist ate. All the Methodists left
[47:10] the Baptist eat. All the Baptist let the
[47:11] Pentecost and he said the whole thing is
[47:13] cut down. And then what it do? The first
[47:15] fruit of it was brotherhood up. He says
[47:17] that's one of the thing that kills the
[47:19] church right there. When there's no
[47:21] brotherly love,
[47:25] I'm not supporting their meeting cuz
[47:26] they don't support mine. Where's the
[47:28] brotherly love at in that?
[47:32] I ain't supporting that meeting cuz I
[47:33] don't like that brother. He done me
[47:35] wrong 25 years ago. Well, get over it.
[47:39] Have some brotherly love about you.
[47:41] Don't let that little insect eat that
[47:44] off of you tonight.
[47:46] God's got a promise of restoration.
[47:49] Notice brotherly love. Then brother Bam
[47:51] talks about now let's see God's God's
[47:53] tree. How many want to see God's tree?
[47:55] How he describes God's tree.
[47:58] All right, brother. I think it's going
[47:59] to be me and you and one other person
[48:00] want to know about this tree tonight.
[48:02] I'm not sure where everybody else is at,
[48:04] but notice what he says. Let's picture a
[48:06] big tree, God's tree. It's bearing nine
[48:09] spiritual gifts. There's healing the
[48:11] sick. There's speaking in tongues.
[48:13] There's casting out devils. that's doing
[48:15] great works, preaching the unadulterated
[48:17] word of God. No denomination to tie them
[48:20] down. They are free doing a great work.
[48:24] Amen. I'm talking about God's tree.
[48:27] God's church, not a man-made church, not
[48:30] a man-made idea, but what God thinks
[48:33] about his tree. What God thinks about
[48:35] his church. And you look at 1
[48:37] Corinthians 12 and verse4, Paul will put
[48:39] it like this. Now there's diversities of
[48:42] gifts, but the same spirit. There's
[48:44] differences of administration, but the
[48:46] same Lord. There are differences of
[48:48] operations, but in the same God, which
[48:51] workketh all in all, but the
[48:53] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[48:55] every man to profit with all. For one is
[48:58] given by the spirit of the word of
[49:01] wisdom. So now look at these nine
[49:04] spiritual gifts that you're that should
[49:06] be in operation in every church of God.
[49:11] Nine spiritual gifts should be in
[49:13] operation in every
[49:15] church. So for to one is given by the
[49:18] spirit of the word of wisdom, to another
[49:20] the word of knowledge by the same
[49:22] spirit, to another faith by the same
[49:23] spirit, to another the gifts of healing
[49:26] by the same spirit, to another working
[49:29] of miracles. That word miracle, there is
[49:31] dunamis power to perform miracles. Don't
[49:34] tell me that the days of miracle is
[49:37] over. When God laid it in his word, he
[49:39] said, "This is one of the nine spiritual
[49:41] gifts that should be in operation in
[49:44] every local assembly." We should expect
[49:47] the power of God. We should expect the
[49:49] supernatural. We should expect the
[49:51] miraculous to take place, the miracles.
[49:54] It's here today, church. It ain't passed
[49:56] off for another day. It ain't back in
[49:59] 1965. He is here today doing the same
[50:02] signs, the same wonders because his word
[50:05] declares it. Amen.
[50:11] The working of miracles to another
[50:13] prophecy. Well, that's only for a
[50:16] prophet. Nine spiritual gifts in every
[50:20] local assembly. And what is preaching
[50:23] the gospel? Prophecy going
[50:27] forth. And to another the discerning of
[50:30] spirits. And to another diverse kinds of
[50:34] tongues. and to another interpretation
[50:36] of tongues. But all these work at that
[50:40] one in a self-same spirit, dividing to
[50:42] every man severally as he will. But you
[50:45] see, the enemy gets in and he wants to
[50:48] eat
[50:49] off these
[50:51] gifts so that that church sits cold,
[50:55] formal, powerless.
[50:58] There's no expectation on a Wednesday
[51:01] night.
[51:04] Come on.
[51:06] Oh, we come and we go through the form.
[51:09] We go through the formality. We looked
[51:11] apart, dressed apart, sit in our same
[51:13] pew. How dare you get in my pew?
[51:17] I have been sitting in that pew for 15
[51:20] years. But have you made a
[51:22] move? Have you made a move?
[51:27] Oh, I'm talking about making a move. I'm
[51:30] talking about the crippleness getting
[51:32] off of you tonight. You can sit there
[51:34] until the rapture comes. I ain't talking
[51:36] about your place on a pew. I'm talking
[51:38] about your place in the lamb's book of
[51:40] life. Have you been inscribed there? I'm
[51:43] talking about one that's here tonight to
[51:46] make a move for you, to move for your
[51:48] child, a move for your kid.
[51:51] He's the same living God tonight in
[51:55] Elton, Kentucky that he is when he
[51:57] walked the shores of Galilee as he is
[52:00] when he was in in in Groos, Virginia and
[52:02] just healed brother Ron Spencer. He's
[52:04] the same God. And he's looking for
[52:07] somebody that'll take him at his word.
[52:10] Somebody that'll believe, somebody say,
[52:12] "Yes, Lord. Let it be me tonight, God."
[52:17] [Music]
[52:19] somebody that can look to the scripture
[52:22] and say, "You can't tell me that that's
[52:24] not alive today."
[52:26] God put it in his word. Who are you as a
[52:29] man to take it out?
[52:32] God put the operation of the nine
[52:34] spiritual gifts there. Who are you to
[52:35] say it ain't in operation today?
[52:39] Who died and made you God?
[52:45] Well, we got the word.
[52:50] Yeah. Then read it.
[52:55] Really? I mean, come on. At least
[52:56] practice what you're saying. You got the
[52:59] word. We'll read the word. Put it in
[53:01] operation tonight.
[53:05] But that little insect begins to eat
[53:08] down. Oh, we ain't seen nothing in a
[53:10] long time.
[53:12] Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. Heats the
[53:16] joy off the church. Eats the faith out
[53:20] of the believer. How do you know this is
[53:23] a word? It's been translated over and
[53:26] over. I mean, come on. This is the King
[53:27] James. When was he
[53:29] alive? He didn't even do it himself. He
[53:32] just took credit for it. Come on.
[53:36] Notice, eat the joy off. I love what he
[53:38] says here about that. See, that's
[53:39] another fruit that he ate off. The joy
[53:41] of salvation.
[53:44] How many of you got the joy of your
[53:45] salvation?
[53:50] How many? Come on. About two or three of
[53:52] us. I mean, you really got the joy of
[53:55] your salvation. You don't mind coming to
[53:57] church. You don't mind how long the
[53:59] preacher preaches. You don't mind how
[54:01] he's laying it down. It don't matter if
[54:04] it's, let me tell you, if it's joy
[54:05] unspeakable and full of glory, we should
[54:08] receive it. We should accept it. We
[54:10] should say yes, it's for me and for my
[54:12] family.
[54:17] But he's Oh, you he didn't ate the joy
[54:20] of your salvation. Sh. You shouldn't be
[54:23] that emotional in church, brother Joe.
[54:29] I know some of you. It's a quote out of
[54:31] the restoration of the bride. Shh. You
[54:33] people make too much noise.
[54:37] Let me Y'all done heard me talk about my
[54:40] testimony. I used to be out there in the
[54:42] world, man. I'd hoop it up, run it up,
[54:47] drink it up, shout it up, praise it up
[54:49] for the devil. And if I could do that
[54:52] with an uncurrender life, what can I do
[54:54] with a life committed to
[54:57] God? I'm not going to give the devil
[54:59] more than I I'm not going to give him
[55:01] more than I can give my God because he
[55:03] redeemed me. He saved me. He set me free
[55:06] tonight. He broke the shackles off my
[55:10] life. I
[55:12] enjoy I enjoy my salvation. I enjoy my
[55:16] religion. I enjoy this message. I enjoy
[55:19] my God.
[55:22] Why not enjoy it?
[55:25] Why poke your neighbors? They get you
[55:27] some of this. It's good. It's worth
[55:31] serving. Let me tell you, it'll make you
[55:33] have a take a bad day and turn it into a
[55:35] good day.
[55:44] You people make way too much
[55:46] noise. You ever heard
[55:49] that? You make way too much noise,
[55:52] Gideon. All that jumping around. There's
[55:56] some churches you can't say that about.
[55:58] Ain't no jumping. Everybody's bent over
[56:01] stiff from alahhide done set
[56:05] in. They
[56:09] dead. But to enjoy,
[56:12] enjoy, brother Glenn, all that God's
[56:15] done for you. Enjoy what he's done and
[56:18] expect him to do more. It ain't over,
[56:20] church. It ain't over till God says it's
[56:23] over. And you're sitting there tonight
[56:26] is proof that God still wants to move.
[56:28] He still want to pour it
[56:32] out. But you make too much noise. All
[56:35] that crying, saying amen, shouting,
[56:38] that's a bunch of nonsense.
[56:42] We don't do that here in
[56:46] Kentucky. I'm just picking on Kentucky
[56:48] because I'm in Kentucky
[56:51] tonight. There's nothing to that. First
[56:53] thing you know, he says, "You set in a
[56:55] big morg, you know, sat there, all of
[56:58] them dead, some of these inbombing
[57:00] fluids of so-called doctrines of creeds
[57:02] pumped into their veins where the spirit
[57:04] of God ought to be running." Where the
[57:06] spirit of God, did you hear that? The
[57:09] spirit of God ought to be running. Well,
[57:11] we don't act like that. Well, do you got
[57:13] the spirit of God running through your
[57:15] veins? Or don't you tonight? Because if
[57:17] you got the spirit of God running
[57:19] through your veins, you can't help but
[57:20] shout. You can't help but dance. You
[57:22] can't help but praise God because he's
[57:25] done something for you. He's turned your
[57:27] life around. He made you a son of God, a
[57:30] daughter of God. He's healed your body.
[57:33] He saved your soul. Oh, hallelujah.
[57:36] That's what God has done for you
[57:38] tonight. And the spirit of God should be
[57:41] running through our veins.
[57:44] This ain't some dead Methodist church.
[57:47] This ain't some dead Catholicism. We are
[57:50] the church of the living God
[57:53] and power has been restored back to the
[57:56] church.
[58:04] He says, "No wonder they're icy cold and
[58:06] dead. Spiritual thermometer 90 below
[58:09] zero." Yep. Somebody say
[58:12] amen. Crack that neck
[58:14] behind. Oh, don't act like you ain't
[58:17] never done it.
[58:19] Who did all that?
[58:22] There you go. Oh yeah.
[58:26] Spirit moving. All of a sudden, somebody
[58:28] shouts out a hallelujah. Acts
[58:31] uncontrollably, maybe stand up. Heaven
[58:34] forbid somebody
[58:36] run. I told Brother Brad, "Look, I done
[58:40] picked up me some new
[58:42] shoes. I polished them up for you last
[58:45] night. I said, I put my dancing shoes on
[58:48] tonight cuz I'm expecting God. I'm
[58:52] expecting God to do great things. I
[58:55] didn't come with sad shoes. I didn't
[58:57] come with concrete shoes. I came with
[58:59] dancing shoes. I came with praising
[59:01] shoes. I came to glorify my king tonight
[59:05] because he does great things.
[59:08] Let the spirit of God flow through your
[59:10] veins. You'll get as excited as I am
[59:12] right now. Amen.
[59:16] Brother Tommy, you know what it means
[59:17] for alcohol to flow through your veins.
[59:21] Man, you feel 10 foot tall, bulletproof.
[59:24] No, we ain't but 5 foot
[59:29] nothing. Feel like I'm the biggest man
[59:31] in the
[59:32] room. If alcohol can do that, what about
[59:35] the spirit of God?
[59:39] If alcohol, if drugs can make you feel
[59:41] that invincible, what about the spirit
[59:44] of God? What about the power that is
[59:48] supposed to be in the church?
[59:54] How many of you have ever ever went to a
[59:57] like a little electrical plug and
[59:59] accidentally touched it?
[1:00:03] When there ain't no power, you can touch
[1:00:05] it all day long. Look at
[1:00:08] me. Turn the power on that
[1:00:12] joker. Turn the power on it. Flip the
[1:00:15] breaker. Turn it back on, church. And go
[1:00:19] over there and touch it, man. You'll get
[1:00:20] a shot. Hallelujah. I said you'll get a
[1:00:23] shot you can't
[1:00:25] control. There's power in the church.
[1:00:28] There's power in the house of God.
[1:00:32] Hallelujah.
[1:00:33] Just touch it one time. I can't see it.
[1:00:36] You can't see it, but I dare you to
[1:00:37] touch it.
[1:00:40] I dare you to touch it tonight. You got
[1:00:42] a need from God. I dare you to touch him
[1:00:45] tonight. I dare you to let the power of
[1:00:47] God restore back to you tonight.
[1:00:55] Then the locust, brother Brad, it would
[1:00:58] change stages. Then the locust be to
[1:01:01] munch and eat. And what did he do? He
[1:01:03] ate the leaves to
[1:01:05] fellowship off the
[1:01:09] tree. Well, we should be able to
[1:01:12] fellowship with one another. What does
[1:01:14] the leaves do on a hot day in the
[1:01:16] summer? Y'all have them here in
[1:01:18] Kentucky. You want to find the tree
[1:01:20] that's got the most leaves on it. Brings
[1:01:23] a little bit of shade, a little
[1:01:24] coolness. No matter how you're feeling,
[1:01:27] no matter if you agree or disagree with
[1:01:29] the other person sitting underneath that
[1:01:30] tree, you're there to cool off,
[1:01:34] no matter how frustrated you are with
[1:01:36] what's going on in the
[1:01:39] church, in your
[1:01:41] family, on your
[1:01:43] job, just come sit under the coolness of
[1:01:46] the big oak tree.
[1:01:49] But if the leaves are ate
[1:01:52] off, there's no reprieve from the
[1:01:55] heat. All you feel is the heat and the
[1:01:58] pressure of life and the pressure of
[1:02:01] this and the pressure of that and the
[1:02:02] intensity of this. And we find that this
[1:02:05] locus begin to eat the fellowship off.
[1:02:08] Well, he's a Presbyterian. I won't have
[1:02:10] any fellowship with him. Or he don't
[1:02:12] believe this or he believes this
[1:02:14] doctrine. He believes that idea. Well,
[1:02:16] we g we're not having
[1:02:19] fellowship. I tell you what, your your
[1:02:22] prophet your prophet was a prime
[1:02:25] example. Draw me out of your circle. I'm
[1:02:27] going to draw one bigger and I'm going
[1:02:30] to draw you right back in.
[1:02:32] I'm going to pull you right back in my
[1:02:34] circle because see the locust hadn't ate
[1:02:37] off his fellowship, had ate off his
[1:02:39] leaves. And we find next thing you got
[1:02:41] the canker worm. What's he do? He gets
[1:02:43] into the bark of it and it begins to eat
[1:02:46] the life out of the
[1:02:47] tree. Don't let some cankerworm spirit
[1:02:50] get a hold of you and just eat the life
[1:02:51] out of you. You sit there full of
[1:02:53] bitterness. You sit there full of
[1:02:55] jealousy. You sit there full of envy and
[1:02:57] and disgust about how God's blessing
[1:02:59] this one and not blessing you and you're
[1:03:01] going through a trial. Let me tell you,
[1:03:03] God brings you to a trial so he can
[1:03:05] perfect you through the trial.
[1:03:08] I just got through reading the book of
[1:03:10] Job and I tell you, you know, sometimes,
[1:03:13] Brother B, I'll be honest with Brother
[1:03:14] Thomas, I'd skip over the book of Job
[1:03:16] because you know what? I'm like, my
[1:03:18] goodness, that man went through it.
[1:03:23] That was for you. Job went through it.
[1:03:26] His friends turned on him. I mean, it's
[1:03:28] chapter after chapter after chapter
[1:03:29] after chapter. If I had friends like
[1:03:31] Job, I'll get some new ones.
[1:03:35] And then his
[1:03:37] wife, won't you just curse God and die?
[1:03:41] Tired of hearing about it, Joe. I'm sick
[1:03:44] of it. You're making a house a wreck. We
[1:03:45] done lost our wealth. We done lost our
[1:03:47] kids. We lost everything. And you look
[1:03:49] at you. You look
[1:03:51] pathetic. Don't let that be you,
[1:03:54] wife. Job went through it. But Job
[1:03:58] remained faithful. Job remained true to
[1:04:01] God. And notice Job did. He wasn't aware
[1:04:04] of the conversation that God had with
[1:04:07] his archeneemy, the devil, about Job's
[1:04:10] life. See, God had confidence in Job.
[1:04:12] And I'm going to tell you tonight, if
[1:04:14] you're going through a trial, God has
[1:04:17] confidence in you tonight. He know
[1:04:19] you'll stand. He know you won't fall. He
[1:04:21] know you won't back up. He knows you
[1:04:23] won't wither. God knows it's about you
[1:04:26] tonight.
[1:04:30] God allowed the trials to come to
[1:04:32] perfect Job's
[1:04:35] life and his the Bible says that in his
[1:04:39] latter days he was blessed more
[1:04:42] abundantly than his early
[1:04:45] days. God restored.
[1:04:51] Did you hear that? God restores.
[1:04:55] He restored double to Job.
[1:05:01] Notice the canken worm after he got
[1:05:04] amongst the congregation, he got them
[1:05:05] all
[1:05:11] dignified.
[1:05:12] Dignified,
[1:05:14] aristocratic. We don't act like that.
[1:05:17] I'm not even going to pick on any
[1:05:21] Canadians or or would be Canadians.
[1:05:26] They just different than us Louisiana,
[1:05:29] southern Kentucky
[1:05:31] people. But you hear what this
[1:05:33] cankerworm does. Gets in there and gets
[1:05:37] us all dignified. If you don't come with
[1:05:40] the suit, you're not welcome at our
[1:05:44] church. We expect you, no matter how
[1:05:47] much money you make, to look the part.
[1:05:50] There are churches under the umbrella of
[1:05:53] what we call the
[1:05:56] message. They are churches. There are
[1:05:59] movements that you must come in dressed
[1:06:02] to the
[1:06:03] nines. You may drive a hoop at home, but
[1:06:06] park it at home. You rent that stinking
[1:06:08] the Cadillac and drive it to church and
[1:06:11] dress like you're there for
[1:06:12] business.
[1:06:14] Churches have become so dignified. The
[1:06:17] people become so dignified. He said you
[1:06:20] took all the fellowship. He took all the
[1:06:22] fellowship
[1:06:23] away. Come on. Even like don't let that
[1:06:26] be you,
[1:06:29] brother Thomas. Don't let that ever be
[1:06:31] Thomas Ber. You keep preaching this
[1:06:34] message. I don't care if they walk in
[1:06:36] it. Well, half-dressed, but you got to
[1:06:38] make sure you got enough clothes on to
[1:06:40] hide it.
[1:06:42] But come as you are. Let me tell you,
[1:06:44] don't don't go out there and rent a
[1:06:45] suit. Yes. Don't go out and try to put
[1:06:48] on to be something that you're not. No.
[1:06:51] Get the love of God in your life. Get
[1:06:52] the Holy Ghost in your soul. Let me tell
[1:06:55] you, you won't try to be dignified. You
[1:06:57] won't become starchy and cold and
[1:06:59] indifferent. No, you come expecting God
[1:07:01] to move. You'll come believing for the
[1:07:04] power of God.
[1:07:07] Next thing you
[1:07:10] know, notice he said instead of giving
[1:07:12] them the new birth, they gave him a they
[1:07:14] gave him a creed. shake the preacher's
[1:07:16] hand. Brother would tell us, "Don't take
[1:07:18] the natural. The natural is always
[1:07:20] death." Then you got the caterpillar.
[1:07:21] What does he do? He sucks the He's a
[1:07:23] sucker. He sucks the life out of the
[1:07:25] tree. And the Holy Spirit is the life of
[1:07:29] the vine. And that when that thing goes
[1:07:33] to work and goes to eating and goes to
[1:07:34] knowing, it sucks the life out of the
[1:07:39] tree. You know what it does? that gives
[1:07:41] you some kind of form of godliness, but
[1:07:44] you deny the power. You deny the effects
[1:07:46] of the power of God and all you have is
[1:07:49] a
[1:07:51] formality. Oh, my hair is long. I don't
[1:07:53] wear makeup. I wear skirts. Boys don't
[1:07:56] wear skirts. Just FYI, I'll throw that
[1:07:58] one out there just so we're free and
[1:07:59] clear on that one. In this day and age,
[1:08:01] you got to put that out there,
[1:08:04] right? We don't operate like that. But
[1:08:07] we find here, you see what these enemies
[1:08:09] are doing. You see the spirit belongs in
[1:08:12] the bride church.
[1:08:15] Shouting belongs in the church. Joy and
[1:08:19] the joy it belongs in the bride church.
[1:08:23] Peace belongs in the church. Oh, healing
[1:08:27] belongs in the church. Prophecies belong
[1:08:30] in the church. Interpretations belong in
[1:08:33] the church. Let me tell you, tongues, it
[1:08:36] belongs in the church. Let me tell you,
[1:08:38] we should have joy in the house of God.
[1:08:42] It belongs in the church. Are you the
[1:08:44] church tonight?
[1:08:49] What? One left, the other eat until
[1:08:51] there was nothing left but a dead
[1:08:53] tree. And every time God sends a big
[1:08:56] rush of the glory down, they just
[1:08:59] moan. Oh, we hadn't had a move. We
[1:09:02] didn't do that when I was a kid. We
[1:09:05] didn't act like that. We don't need all
[1:09:09] that. It'll do some of us good to go
[1:09:11] back to Pentecost.
[1:09:15] Some of us all we went back to is 63,
[1:09:17] 64, 65. It'll be some of us good to go
[1:09:20] all the way back.
[1:09:23] Not 1909. I'm talking about all the way
[1:09:25] back. Keep going on a little bit
[1:09:27] further. Keep going on a little bit
[1:09:29] further. Oh, go back to where the church
[1:09:31] was inaugurated. Go back when they came
[1:09:34] out of the upper room staggering like
[1:09:36] drug men, like drug women. Oh, they were
[1:09:39] stammering with lips. They thought they
[1:09:41] were drunk and full of new wine. It'll
[1:09:43] do some of us good to come to church and
[1:09:46] go out acting like
[1:09:48] that. What happened on the day of
[1:09:50] Pentecost? God tripped the breaker and
[1:09:53] turned the power on. I say, God, turn
[1:09:56] the power on
[1:09:58] tonight. People got a need. Kids are in
[1:10:01] need. Mama's in need. Daddy's in need.
[1:10:04] Grandparents are in need. Turn the power
[1:10:06] on tonight.
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:11] In the book of Joel verse or chapter 2
[1:10:13] and verse 25, I just read you what this
[1:10:16] these insects have done to the
[1:10:19] tree. But God in the richness of his
[1:10:23] word. Joel 25 verse two verse 25.
[1:10:27] Chapter 22 25. I will restore.
[1:10:35] I will restore. He's going to restore to
[1:10:40] somebody.
[1:10:42] Come on. You could be sitting by your
[1:10:44] neighbor not getting nothing. Dead,
[1:10:47] cold, indifferent. But God promised a
[1:10:49] restoration to somebody. God said, "I
[1:10:53] will restore, not may restore. Oh, if
[1:10:56] it's possible, I think I will restore.
[1:10:58] If you can believe for it, let me tell
[1:11:00] God put in his word. There's going to be
[1:11:02] a restoration of the bride. Whether you
[1:11:05] want to believe it, whether you want to
[1:11:06] doubt it or not, God is going to
[1:11:08] restore. And there's going to be a
[1:11:09] people. There's going to be a bride.
[1:11:12] There's going to be somebody. It's going
[1:11:13] to be a beneficiary of the restoration
[1:11:16] of power.
[1:11:19] They're going to believe. Somebody's
[1:11:21] going to believe in this day
[1:11:24] that the power is on.
[1:11:29] Oh,
[1:11:31] hallelujah. When you say, "Brother Joe,
[1:11:33] I need a scripture." Go to Ephesians 5
[1:11:35] and verse 27. This is God speaking that
[1:11:39] he is going to
[1:11:40] present. Notice he is going to present
[1:11:43] to himself a glorious church.
[1:11:47] God is going to present a glorious. This
[1:11:50] word glorious here means splendid.
[1:11:53] Oh, come on. You can do better than
[1:11:54] that.
[1:11:56] Honored, gorgeous.
[1:12:00] You know, when I look in the mirror, I
[1:12:01] don't think I'm ugly.
[1:12:05] I just be I'm like, "Oh,
[1:12:07] boy. God did good when he made you." No,
[1:12:10] I'm just
[1:12:13] kidding. We look in the mirror and we
[1:12:15] look Oh, man. We see every fat sale. You
[1:12:17] know what fat sales? They going to make
[1:12:18] it in the
[1:12:19] rapture. Them things don't die, they
[1:12:23] multiply. We've been starving ourselves
[1:12:25] to death for two months getting ready
[1:12:26] for this wedding. I feel I ain't lost an
[1:12:29] ounce. But I don't stand in front of
[1:12:30] that mirror all gloomy. No, I look at
[1:12:33] the
[1:12:34] transformation. What I was to what I am.
[1:12:40] Oh, I want you look in the mirror of
[1:12:41] God's word tonight. Look at what you
[1:12:42] were and look at what you are tonight.
[1:12:44] Look at what your desires used to be and
[1:12:46] look what they are tonight. Stand in the
[1:12:48] mirror of God's word. Quit looking back
[1:12:50] at what you used to be. Look at what God
[1:12:52] has made you today. Look at your
[1:12:53] reflection in the mirror of God's word.
[1:12:56] God has restored unto you
[1:12:58] tonight power and demonstration and
[1:13:02] manifestation. You're not what you used
[1:13:04] to be. You may not be what you want to
[1:13:06] be, but thank God something's changed.
[1:13:08] Thank God you're different. Thank God
[1:13:10] your desires have been changed. Thank
[1:13:12] godly for the supernatural.
[1:13:16] He's going to present to himself a
[1:13:18] glorious church.
[1:13:21] Honored, gorgeous.
[1:13:24] Woo. You need to start thinking some
[1:13:25] good pronouns for yourself or some
[1:13:28] adjectives. We say it around my house.
[1:13:30] We're blessed and highly favored.
[1:13:34] Come on, somebody. We're the head, not
[1:13:37] the tail.
[1:13:39] What do you mean, Brother Joe? The head,
[1:13:41] not the tail. I'm like, we ain't the
[1:13:43] dog, the tail wagging the dog. We are
[1:13:45] the head directing the tail. Hallelujah.
[1:13:48] We are sons of God tonight. We are the
[1:13:50] head and not the tail. We're going up
[1:13:53] and not down. Some of you need to tell
[1:13:56] the devil that tonight. I am the head
[1:13:58] tonight. I'm blessed and highly favored.
[1:14:02] [Applause]
[1:14:04] Oh
[1:14:05] my. A glorious church. illustrious,
[1:14:08] honorable esteem free from sins.
[1:14:15] Sounds like to me he done restored power
[1:14:17] to that church.
[1:14:19] Earlier this morning, we had no water at
[1:14:23] 1,65 stream whatever drive we was on. I
[1:14:26] guess that's the address. I got lucky.
[1:14:28] Maybe not. Had close
[1:14:30] enough. And that trailer we was in. Got
[1:14:33] there this morning. No water. It was cut
[1:14:37] off. But you know what we did? About two
[1:14:41] or three hours in, we done replplumbed
[1:14:42] that entire
[1:14:44] house. Put new fixtures in, new lines
[1:14:47] in. Some of them we had to put a little
[1:14:49] tape on them, little teflon tape to tidy
[1:14:51] them up a little bit. Some of you need a
[1:14:53] little bit of tape on you. Tidy up so
[1:14:54] there ain't no leaks.
[1:14:58] Come on. And all of a sudden, Brother
[1:15:00] Brad said, "I'm going to turn the
[1:15:02] power." I said, "Praise God. We need a
[1:15:04] potty in this
[1:15:06] house. We tired of driving down the road
[1:15:08] to use the bathroom, but when he did, we
[1:15:11] found a couple leaks. We didn't leave
[1:15:12] them leaking. And let me tell you, God
[1:15:14] ain't going to leave you leaking
[1:15:15] tonight. Got to fix it up, right? Got to
[1:15:18] put some teflon or the Holy Ghost around
[1:15:20] those toilets and make sure there ain't
[1:15:22] no
[1:15:24] leaks. And I tell you, when we walked
[1:15:26] out of that house at 4:00 today,
[1:15:28] everything was plumbed up. The toilets
[1:15:30] were running. The sinks were running.
[1:15:32] Everything ran as it should. Why?
[1:15:34] Because there's been power of water
[1:15:36] restored back to the church.
[1:15:41] What can God do to us?
[1:15:44] I just been leaking, brother Joe. I just
[1:15:45] been leaking. You ain't got a leak
[1:15:47] anymore. You in the right place for it
[1:15:50] tonight. Some of you raise your hand. I
[1:15:52] got a need. That's a leak. Let me tell
[1:15:54] you, God is here. He's the greatest
[1:15:56] plumber you've ever met. He can fix that
[1:15:58] leak.
[1:16:00] He can make sure the water flows. The
[1:16:03] water of the Holy Ghost flowing through
[1:16:05] your life, flowing through your family,
[1:16:07] flowing through your children. God can
[1:16:09] do that for you.
[1:16:14] But thank the Lord, he put a promise in
[1:16:16] his word. I will restore.
[1:16:21] These destroying insects had eaten a
[1:16:24] bride tree down to there was any hope of
[1:16:26] revival. Can we have a revival? She'd
[1:16:29] gone down through the dark
[1:16:31] ages. But there was a word that's
[1:16:34] already been spoke. And no matter how
[1:16:37] dark it
[1:16:38] got, no matter how much they ate, it was
[1:16:42] not going to rule out the word of
[1:16:44] restoration. And can I tell you tonight,
[1:16:46] no matter how far it goes, no matter how
[1:16:48] far that waver child goes, that prodal
[1:16:50] goes, no matter how sick they get, it
[1:16:53] doesn't anull, I will
[1:17:00] restore. Brother would tell us, we got
[1:17:03] too many beaver preachers
[1:17:05] today trying to dam up all the water up
[1:17:08] and say, "Well, this is ours and this is
[1:17:10] just for us here and this belongs to
[1:17:12] us." And what happens to it? It becomes
[1:17:14] stagnated. That's what's the matter with
[1:17:15] a lot of organizations trying to back up
[1:17:17] the water for your organization only and
[1:17:20] it's got stagnated.
[1:17:22] Notice you know stagnated water get a
[1:17:24] little of these wiggle tails in it.
[1:17:26] That's what the matter with some of the
[1:17:27] church today. Little wiggle over here
[1:17:28] and wiggle out there. The days of
[1:17:30] miracles have passed. No such thing as
[1:17:32] divine healing. Can't sit five minutes
[1:17:34] in a minute. Oh my goodness. Stagnated
[1:17:37] water. Beaver dance. Blow it out.
[1:17:40] Come on somebody. Blow it out tonight.
[1:17:43] Blow out the stagnated one. Take that
[1:17:45] log of indifference and blow it out
[1:17:47] tonight and let the Holy Ghost flow
[1:17:51] through. God gave the promise of
[1:17:54] restoration. And that's what this
[1:17:56] message is. It's a promise of
[1:17:58] restoration. What? Restoration of life.
[1:18:01] Restoration of power. Restoration of the
[1:18:03] promise of returning back to the
[1:18:05] original.
[1:18:08] A promise of fulfillment. Restored
[1:18:10] fruit.
[1:18:14] joy, faith, peace, happiness. Some of
[1:18:18] you need that fruit tonight.
[1:18:23] Some of us need it. Let me tell you,
[1:18:24] there's good days and bad days. We're
[1:18:25] human, right? And sometimes you don't
[1:18:28] want to come to church.
[1:18:30] You bring this old carnality nature and
[1:18:32] take it and bring it, drag it to the
[1:18:34] house of God. Say, "Oh, boy, you need
[1:18:36] some joy. You ain't going to get it at
[1:18:38] home." Let me tell you, you stream all
[1:18:40] you want to. It ain't the same like
[1:18:42] being in the presence. When Moses got in
[1:18:45] front of that burning bush, he didn't
[1:18:46] stream the
[1:18:48] bush. Oh, he felt the effects, brother
[1:18:50] Tommy, of the bush. You couldn't tell
[1:18:53] Moses that bush was fake. You couldn't
[1:18:54] tell Moses that was only scientific
[1:18:56] reason. It was only intellectual. Moses
[1:18:59] was at the bush. Moses heard the voice.
[1:19:02] Moses felt the power. I said, "Oh God,
[1:19:05] let me feel the power of the burning
[1:19:07] bush today."
[1:19:09] They can't talk it out of it. I've been
[1:19:11] there. I've been changed. I'm not going
[1:19:14] back. I can't be the same.
[1:19:20] Restored leaves, restored fellowship,
[1:19:22] restored covering, restored
[1:19:25] life. Jehovah Gyra, God said, "I will
[1:19:28] restore, sayaith the Lord, all the
[1:19:30] years. I'll send back another church in
[1:19:33] the last days. I will restore that
[1:19:37] original power again.
[1:19:41] Tell me we days of miracles has passed,
[1:19:44] I say hogwash.
[1:19:46] Tell me we can't have miracles today, I
[1:19:48] say hogwash. You tell me God don't
[1:19:51] deliver cancer, I say hogwash. You tell
[1:19:55] me that God can't save our children, I
[1:19:57] say hogwash.
[1:19:59] I say God will again restore the
[1:20:02] original church with the same power, the
[1:20:06] same size, and the same wonders.
[1:20:12] We either believe this or we don't.
[1:20:17] So God sent us a message to restore this
[1:20:21] end time
[1:20:23] bride back to the same power to be
[1:20:28] equivalent to the same bride and the
[1:20:32] same power and the same supernatural and
[1:20:35] the same miraculous that they received
[1:20:38] on the day of Pentecost. Amen.
[1:20:42] The same.
[1:20:44] How do they
[1:20:46] act? 120.
[1:20:49] Well, I don't believe that
[1:20:52] way. 120 staggered out.
[1:20:56] Well, I didn't learn that. They didn't
[1:20:58] learn that either. All they had was
[1:21:01] Moses's law. They weren't expecting Joel
[1:21:03] to his word to come to pass. They kept
[1:21:05] looking to Moses's law. Moses's law.
[1:21:08] Moses's law. But when the word of
[1:21:10] fulfillment came, they didn't see it.
[1:21:12] Oh, little bride, don't get disgusted
[1:21:14] out there. Don't discredit the word
[1:21:16] because you ain't seen it. You begin to
[1:21:18] expect it. You begin to pray for wait on
[1:21:21] it. Wait on it until the day of
[1:21:24] Pentecost fully
[1:21:27] came. 10 days they waited in that upper
[1:21:30] room. I'm going to go just about another
[1:21:32] 15 minutes. That okay tonight.
[1:21:35] They waited 10 days and no doubt there
[1:21:37] was some
[1:21:38] chatter. Peter, why you got us up
[1:21:41] here? John, let me come on have a talk
[1:21:43] with Peter. Come on. We We've been here
[1:21:45] forever and we ain't seen
[1:21:47] nothing. Sometimes that's how we get
[1:21:51] cuz we're human, right? Ain't none of
[1:21:54] y'all robots programmed for
[1:21:57] this? They just as natural as us. You
[1:22:00] mean we got to have a week of meetings?
[1:22:02] I mean, come on, brother Thomas. What
[1:22:03] are you thinking? It's hot in
[1:22:05] May. It ain't that
[1:22:08] hot. But it's going to get hot. Going to
[1:22:11] get hot. And if you ain't right with
[1:22:13] God, it's going to get hotter and hotter
[1:22:16] and hotter.
[1:22:19] But notice here they were in the upper
[1:22:20] room 10 days
[1:22:23] finally. Oh, you feel that?
[1:22:26] Whoa. Come out like a mighty rushing
[1:22:30] wind.
[1:22:31] There was no denying who was flowing in.
[1:22:35] There was no denying what was happening.
[1:22:38] This wasn't some gentle breeze. This
[1:22:40] wasn't the the windows lifted up so they
[1:22:42] can get a fresh air. No, the power of
[1:22:44] the Holy Ghost came down like a rushing
[1:22:47] mighty wind and begin to lay upon them.
[1:22:50] And the prophet of God said that was the
[1:22:51] logos himself dividing himself upon the
[1:22:55] people. I said, "Oh logos, tonight
[1:22:57] divide yourself among us. Follow me
[1:22:59] tonight. Let me fill your spirit one
[1:23:02] more time.
[1:23:09] If this message is a restoration
[1:23:12] message, then why shouldn't we believe
[1:23:14] for it?
[1:23:19] The message that we've been given, the
[1:23:22] opening of the seals, the restor, excuse
[1:23:25] me, the restoration of original power.
[1:23:28] If this is not the power, then where is
[1:23:31] it?
[1:23:34] Come on, church. I'm asking you an
[1:23:35] honest question. If this is not the
[1:23:39] power, then where is
[1:23:42] it? If William Brandham is not the
[1:23:45] manifestation of Malachi 4, Revelations
[1:23:48] 10:7, then where is that man that must
[1:23:51] fulfill that scripture? Cuz we're not
[1:23:54] leaving here until that has been
[1:23:56] performed.
[1:23:59] But can I ask you another question? How
[1:24:01] many of your hearts have been turned
[1:24:02] back?
[1:24:05] Come on. I need a little bit more
[1:24:07] participation today. How many of your
[1:24:09] hearts have been turned back? Well, then
[1:24:11] your proof tonight that Malachi 4 has
[1:24:14] already came. Your proof tonight that
[1:24:16] Revelations 10:7 has already been
[1:24:19] manifested. And if that's the case, you
[1:24:22] are proof tonight that power has been
[1:24:24] restored back because it took the power
[1:24:27] of God to change your thinking and
[1:24:29] change your mentality and turn you from
[1:24:31] unbelief to believing.
[1:24:34] [Applause]
[1:24:36] If this is not that source of power,
[1:24:39] then I ask you
[1:24:41] where where will it come from? Cuz I
[1:24:44] want to be near it. I want to receive
[1:24:47] it.
[1:24:49] If I knew at my house I had no power and
[1:24:52] my neighbor had power, that means one or
[1:24:56] two
[1:24:57] things. I didn't pay the bill.
[1:25:02] That means I didn't do my part.
[1:25:06] Or somebody cut the source.
[1:25:13] If my neighbor has power and I
[1:25:17] don't, if my
[1:25:19] neighbor has power and I don't, I don't
[1:25:23] want you to put it in a neighborhood on
[1:25:24] a house address in the street. I'm
[1:25:26] talking about your neighbor in that pew.
[1:25:27] If my neighbor has power and I don't,
[1:25:31] either I didn't pay the bill. Come on. I
[1:25:34] either I didn't do what I need to do to
[1:25:36] have their power restored on when I come
[1:25:38] to the house of God and I sit there like
[1:25:40] a bump on a pickle. If I didn't do my
[1:25:43] part, then shame on me. There won't be
[1:25:45] any power. But let me tell you, all that
[1:25:47] you got to do is come down to the altar
[1:25:49] and pay that bill and the power will be
[1:25:52] restored to that church. I said the
[1:25:55] power of the Holy Ghost will be restored
[1:25:57] back to that life.
[1:26:01] And another thing, if there's no power
[1:26:03] and you have paid your bill, then
[1:26:06] somebody has cut off your
[1:26:10] service and you can appeal to the agent.
[1:26:15] Say, "Look, my bill is in. I got a I got
[1:26:18] a clear check." Woo!
[1:26:21] I said, "I got a clear check. The debt
[1:26:23] has been paid. I should had power. They
[1:26:27] will dispatch an army out to that house
[1:26:29] and flip the breaker and turn that
[1:26:31] source of power back on. Somebody needs
[1:26:34] to appeal to the Holy Ghost tonight. I
[1:26:37] don't have power. My family don't have
[1:26:39] power. My marriage is lacking power. But
[1:26:42] tonight, I'm appealing my
[1:26:44] [Applause]
[1:26:46] case. How old power turn back on.
[1:26:52] He may be going through a mental
[1:26:53] condition.
[1:26:56] feel like you're just waited down by
[1:26:58] depression, anxiety,
[1:27:01] fears, maybe even contemplating suicide.
[1:27:05] That's a lie of the enemy, that's
[1:27:07] because the source of power has been cut
[1:27:10] off, man. Well, if you can ever get that
[1:27:13] current flowing, oh my, you can ever get
[1:27:17] 220 pumping back into that house,
[1:27:20] pumping back into that breaker, right?
[1:27:22] It comes through one source where
[1:27:24] there's a lot of breakers in that box
[1:27:26] and it feeds this room and it feeds this
[1:27:28] room and it feeds this one and this one
[1:27:29] and this one. And if you can ever get
[1:27:31] that main source powered back up,
[1:27:33] church, there ain't nothing that that
[1:27:35] house won't provide. Let me tell you.
[1:27:36] And if you can get this source powered
[1:27:38] back up, there'll be spiritual tongues
[1:27:40] in the church. There'll be manifestation
[1:27:43] of interpretations in the church.
[1:27:44] There'll be discernment in the church.
[1:27:46] There'll be healings in the church.
[1:27:48] There'll be miracle. Come on, somebody.
[1:27:50] There'll be miracles in the church. All
[1:27:51] we got to do is get the power
[1:27:54] restored. Prodigals have come back home.
[1:27:57] I don't care how long they've been
[1:28:02] out. Turn the power on. All right, let
[1:28:05] me bring this down to a close. I got to
[1:28:07] skip a lot of
[1:28:09] stuff.
[1:28:11] Notice now Peter and John went
[1:28:14] together two by two. I like that. Don't
[1:28:17] go by yourself, church.
[1:28:19] Peter and John went to the
[1:28:22] temple about 7 o'clock on a Wednesday
[1:28:27] night. I mean, y'all didn't hear that,
[1:28:29] did you?
[1:28:32] 7 o'clock on a Wednesday night.
[1:28:36] Went going to the church and notice what
[1:28:39] they
[1:28:41] find. Oh, I can just preach, man. I'll
[1:28:43] tell you what. I'll pick that up later.
[1:28:46] Peter and John went up together into the
[1:28:48] temple at the hour of praying in the
[1:28:50] ninth hour. And a certain man laying
[1:28:53] from his mother's womb. He was carried
[1:28:56] there whom they laid daily. Notice they
[1:28:58] laid him in this same spot daily. And
[1:29:02] the history tells us for 40 years of his
[1:29:06] life. Picked up and placed to
[1:29:10] beg. A beggar every day, seven days a
[1:29:14] week. That's the only way he was going
[1:29:17] to make it. That was the only way his
[1:29:20] family is going to make it. And some of
[1:29:23] us, we come
[1:29:25] daily, Sunday, Wednesday, special
[1:29:27] meetings, and we sit right in our same
[1:29:31] spot. This is my spot. I've occupied
[1:29:35] this spot
[1:29:37] forever. Do you know that? When we built
[1:29:41] this church, I claimed that pew. It's
[1:29:44] got my name somewhere written on the
[1:29:46] bottom of
[1:29:47] it. 40 years. Y'all been in this church
[1:29:51] 20 plus years somewhere around
[1:29:54] there. But he was a
[1:29:59] Couldn't offend for himself.
[1:30:01] Couldn't walk for himself. Couldn't
[1:30:02] provide for himself. Depended upon the
[1:30:05] people to provide for him.
[1:30:10] But this
[1:30:12] day, this service was different.
[1:30:18] This service was different because Peter
[1:30:21] and John just left
[1:30:23] Pentecost. Peter and John were four days
[1:30:27] out from Pentecost. Peter, oh, I'm
[1:30:30] telling you, Peter, is there another
[1:30:31] Peter here with me tonight? Is there a
[1:30:33] John in here with me tonight? You done
[1:30:35] been to Pentecost. You done been
[1:30:37] changed. There ain't no hallelujah. What
[1:30:39] about a young person? Have you been
[1:30:41] there and been changed by the power of
[1:30:43] God that you know that you know that you
[1:30:45] know that you met that same pillar of
[1:30:47] fire and Peter came from that thing four
[1:30:51] days and then he comes into the house of
[1:30:53] prayer and he sees a lame man
[1:30:57] Gideon and he he looked at
[1:31:02] him. Notice Peter just for a minute said
[1:31:05] take your eyes off your lameness.
[1:31:08] Take your eyes off your problem. Take
[1:31:11] your eyes off that condition. Take your
[1:31:14] eyes off that situation. Look on us.
[1:31:20] Why was Peter directing him to look on
[1:31:22] us? He wasn't about building Peter's
[1:31:25] kingdom. He wasn't about building the
[1:31:28] universal church, Catholic church. No,
[1:31:32] Peter had just left the source of power.
[1:31:37] Peter had just left. When they turned it
[1:31:39] on, Peter was so overturned. Notice
[1:31:41] Peter was a liar. Peter was a denier.
[1:31:44] Peter was a cursor. Peter said, "I'll
[1:31:47] die for you, Lord." And just a few hours
[1:31:49] later, he denied the Lord three times.
[1:31:51] What am I telling you tonight? God can
[1:31:53] turn your life around. You may walked in
[1:31:56] and denying Peter, but at the day of
[1:31:58] Pentecost, when he walked out, he was
[1:32:00] changed. He was charged with the power
[1:32:03] of
[1:32:05] God. And when he walked out four days
[1:32:07] later, oh hallelujah, that lame man
[1:32:10] looked as if Peter was about to unload a
[1:32:12] a pocketbook of
[1:32:15] money. Peter didn't have no money,
[1:32:17] Brother Brad. He gave up fishing. He
[1:32:21] went fulltime in the ministry.
[1:32:24] You don't get rich in the ministry.
[1:32:27] I would thought I would heard some
[1:32:29] preachers say amen to that, but none of
[1:32:30] them did.
[1:32:34] You don't get rich, but your blessings
[1:32:36] are on the other side.
[1:32:38] Notice what Peter said. Peter looked
[1:32:40] down on Peter. Remember the word of Job.
[1:32:43] If they will call upon the name of the
[1:32:45] Lord, they shall be saved. Hear this
[1:32:49] lame man, man, 40 years at the
[1:32:52] same spot calling on the name of the
[1:32:54] Lord. I want to be saved. I want to
[1:32:57] walk. I want to be free. I don't want to
[1:32:59] stay in this condition. Let me tell you,
[1:33:01] if that's you tonight, God can raise you
[1:33:03] up out of that crippled
[1:33:07] condition. Oh, Peter looked at him. He
[1:33:09] said, "Silver and gold, hallelujah, have
[1:33:12] I done, but such as I have, such as I
[1:33:15] have." What do you got tonight? I got
[1:33:18] power. I got the anointing. I got the
[1:33:21] Holy Ghost. I got an experience. I've
[1:33:23] been there. I've seen the power turned
[1:33:26] on. Such as I have give I
[1:33:31] thee. Such as I have. And he reached
[1:33:34] down and lifted. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:40] He reached down. Gideon picked him up
[1:33:43] and he went walking, leaping, and
[1:33:45] praising God.
[1:33:49] Come on, Gideon. Walking, leaping,
[1:33:51] praise God. Cuz we're free tonight. I'm
[1:33:55] telling you, you're free tonight. Power
[1:33:57] has been restored. Power has been
[1:34:03] restored. Such as I
[1:34:09] have. He was expecting some money. Well,
[1:34:12] what Peter was about to give him, he
[1:34:15] would never beg again.
[1:34:18] He will never hear me when I say this.
[1:34:21] He will never come back to that spot.
[1:34:27] 40 years in that spot. But this day was
[1:34:31] different. I'm never coming back to that
[1:34:34] spot. God knows that
[1:34:37] spot. Never coming back. God knows that
[1:34:41] spot. Young man, that condition. Let me
[1:34:45] just tell you tonight, God knows. He's
[1:34:47] seen no seizures. And I'm here to tell
[1:34:49] you tonight, God is here to move on your
[1:34:51] behalf. Cuz such as I have, give I to
[1:34:53] thee in the name of Jesus Christ. You
[1:34:55] don't have to be tormented any longer by
[1:34:57] seizures. Father God, I pray you'll
[1:34:58] touch them. May there be a spirit of
[1:35:00] God, touch them right now, Lord, I
[1:35:02] preach faith, the power of God, I pray
[1:35:04] right now, Holy Spirit, as I lay my
[1:35:06] hands on this child. May the power of
[1:35:08] Pentecost, may the power of the Holy
[1:35:10] Ghost surge through him right now.
[1:35:12] Satan, I rebuke you in the name of
[1:35:14] Jesus. Take your hands off of God's
[1:35:16] property. You believe it, church. The
[1:35:19] power is here. The anointing is here.
[1:35:21] It's been restored to the church of the
[1:35:23] living God. You got a need. I got a God.
[1:35:26] You got a situation. I got a God. Such
[1:35:28] as I
[1:35:31] have. Musicians, come. Such as I have.
[1:35:37] Give I thee tonight.
[1:35:41] power restored
[1:35:43] to the church. Not a oneman ministry. Uh
[1:35:47] those days are over. God is working in
[1:35:51] and through his
[1:35:53] bride. And if you got a need tonight, I
[1:35:56] say like Peter, look on
[1:35:59] us. When that angel of the Lord told
[1:36:01] your prophet said, "If you can get the
[1:36:04] people to believe you, nothing will
[1:36:07] stand before your prayer, not even
[1:36:09] cancer." He said, "Not believe me, but
[1:36:12] believe what I'm telling you. I have
[1:36:15] preached to you the word of God and the
[1:36:18] spirit of God accompanies the message."
[1:36:20] And if you got a need tonight, I got a
[1:36:23] God for you.
[1:36:25] No matter what your need is, no matter
[1:36:26] how big, how small,
[1:36:29] I believe God is here for you tonight.
[1:36:32] Restore power. If you got a need, won't
[1:36:36] you just make your way now? We got a
[1:36:38] song leader
[1:36:40] tonight. Let's just sing Only Believe.
[1:36:43] Let's invite the angel of the Lord here
[1:36:45] tonight.
[1:36:46] Amen. Brother
[1:36:48] Jonathan, today's a different day. Yes.
[1:36:51] Yes. Today's a different day. Yes. When
[1:36:55] I was studying this thought, Amen. God
[1:36:58] laid you on my heart. I didn't know your
[1:37:00] name, but I know you were John's son.
[1:37:03] Amen.
[1:37:04] And I was telling brother Bad in the
[1:37:06] back when I came to here last year at
[1:37:07] May and Turkey hunting and I left here.
[1:37:09] I went to North Carolina and I preached
[1:37:11] for brother uh brother Josh Bennett. And
[1:37:14] there was a young man. His dad's a p or
[1:37:17] his dad's a preacher. I can't remember
[1:37:19] his name. name. I think it's Seth Carlos
[1:37:21] nephew Coffee. Seth Coffee, his son
[1:37:25] about four or five years old, maybe
[1:37:26] maybe three or four. He had something
[1:37:28] going on with him and he was just out
[1:37:30] uncontrollable and doctors couldn't
[1:37:31] figure it out what was going on with
[1:37:32] him. And at the end of the service, I
[1:37:34] called him up.
[1:37:36] Amen. And we prayed and we laid hands on
[1:37:38] him and we anointed him with
[1:37:41] oil. He fought us cuz he didn't know
[1:37:44] what was going on. But we prayed and six
[1:37:48] months after that service, I got a phone
[1:37:50] call, tell brother Joe that my son is
[1:37:54] completely healed. He's not had one more
[1:37:56] bout. What am I telling you? I'm telling
[1:37:59] you, it's time to
[1:38:01] believe. It's time to doubt your doubts
[1:38:04] and put your faith on the line and know
[1:38:06] that God has called you to be a son and
[1:38:09] daughter of God. And we're not waiting
[1:38:11] on the church. We are the church. We're
[1:38:13] not waiting on the power. The power's
[1:38:16] here. God is looking for somebody
[1:38:18] that'll believe. Will you believe him
[1:38:21] tonight? God bless you, church. You got
[1:38:23] a need, I'm here to pray with
[1:38:25] you.
[1:38:27] Only
[1:38:31] believe.

[1:52:51] Jesus is here. Yes Lord.
[1:52:56] All things are possible. Yes, Lord
[1:53:03] Jesus is here.
[1:53:09] Amen. We can say we've certainly been in
[1:53:12] the presence of the Lord
[1:53:14] tonight. God certainly been mindful of
[1:53:16] our needs, our
[1:53:19] desires, the intents of our heart.
[1:53:24] It's just been good to have been in the
[1:53:25] house of the Lord. You know, when as
[1:53:28] brother Joe was preaching, I couldn't
[1:53:29] help but think and I talked to brother
[1:53:31] Ron this week. And you know, if you
[1:53:33] hadn't seen his little testimony, you
[1:53:35] ought to watch it because it sure builds
[1:53:36] your faith.
[1:53:38] Four months. They gave him four months
[1:53:41] to live five years ago. And he got his
[1:53:45] first clear SCA scan of his brain this
[1:53:47] last week.
[1:53:50] Let's give the Lord a hand.
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:00] And I talked to him. I said, "You must
[1:54:02] be ecstatic." He said, "Man, we are
[1:54:04] feeling good." You say, "Well, that's
[1:54:07] brother Ron. It's happening here.
[1:54:12] Clear clear limp nodes." Sister Donna,
[1:54:14] they sent her home on hospice. We're
[1:54:17] still moving.
[1:54:20] Sister Donna, brother Ron said to tell
[1:54:22] you just to keep taking one step in
[1:54:24] front of the other and that you're on
[1:54:26] the prayer list and he thinks of you
[1:54:28] every single day. God is moving,
[1:54:30] brothers and sisters. Prodals are coming
[1:54:32] home.
[1:54:34] He's very mindful and tonight we've seen
[1:54:37] the power and the demonstration of the
[1:54:39] Lord. Why don't we just bow our heads
[1:54:41] before we dismiss and uh Brother Troy,
[1:54:43] would you dismiss us in prayer tonight?
[1:55:15] Everything.
[1:55:33] Amen. Aren't you thankful that you can
[1:55:35] leave a service tonight, no matter what
[1:55:36] you're going through, and know that
[1:55:37] victory is yours? You can have victory.
[1:55:40] You can have deliverance. You can have
[1:55:42] healing. You can have redemption.
[1:55:44] Everything you have need of, victory is
[1:55:46] yours. Let's sing that as we get ready
[1:55:47] to go. Victory is mine. Oh, victory is
[1:55:51] mine. Victory is
[1:55:54] mine. Victory today is mine.
[1:56:01] Well, I told Satan to get thee behind
[1:56:07] cuz victory today is
[1:56:12] mine. Well, joy is
[1:56:16] mine. Joy is
[1:56:19] mine. Joy today is mine.
[1:56:26] Well, I told Satan to get thee
[1:56:31] behind. Cuz joy
[1:56:35] today is mine. Victory once again. Oh,
[1:56:39] victory is
