before you Lord thank the Lord Jesus to have a great and wonderful God like you to serve to serve a father that is in heaven the Lord Jesus we just ask God that your perfect will would be done this morning on Earth as it is in heaven Lord Jesus give us this day our daily bread Lord forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever We Praise You Lord Jesus we ask God that you just have the preeminence in the service you know every need the thoughts of every heart Jesus Christ's name amen and amen children are dismissed for Sunday School you would turn with me into the book of Psalms uh we're going to read chapter 63 probably read this many times this is David it finds herself in the wilderness and uh it's a it's a good good Psalm there and you I like where he says early I'll seek you and when I go to bed I'll be meditating on you so he's constantly no matter where he's at and it shows us no matter where we're at in our life what we're going through God should be our focus and he's there for so Charles Spurgeon he he wrote in his commentary said that in the early days uh the early Christians it was a decree and they were ordained to sing this Psalm at least once a day every Christian so pretty interesting when you think about it that way how important the psalm is so Psalm 63 oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh long for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is foreign kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee my soul shall be satisfied as with my myrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice she's so alone but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the Earth all together but the king shall rejoice in God every one that sweareth by him shall Glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped bless you good job oh I'm sorry brother Brian I forgot to tell everybody this morning Sister Janice gives everybody uh her greetings amen so God bless you continue to pray for her amen she's made it to Russellville and she says she's really looking forward to walking again so I says you can do it amen by God's grace if you return with me to the third chapter of Lamentations you know what brother uh Brad was saying is so true to what your focus is is going to bring about the circumstances in your life if you're focusing on the negative all your life that's what you're going to have if you focus on the positive the positive is what you're going to have doesn't mean you don't have tribulations and struggles we all have tribulations and struggle but whatever and anything hard happens to you where do you go do you immediately go in the negative or you just turn to the Lord and put that before that's that's where we have to be and I was uh Lamentations to 26th chapter I was just thinking you know Jeremiah when he wrote These Lamentations it's our day exactly like his day no but the things that politically spiritually naturally fell going on around that time are kind of close to where we're at this morning and uh even through all that or everything that Jeremiah had to see is the prophet of his day that happened to the children of Israel he still had a perspective he still put his trust in the law of God but uh before I get started I was just going to mention this this morning as of this morning uh the the insurance for the church for the upcoming years totally paid and a brother brushed us with that and the fuel the Summerfield is paid for and the winner prepaid is paid for not in the last two years because of the price of propane I haven't been paying as much for the winter Phil I paid for a thousand gallons and uh which was a pretty which was like twenty four hundred and eighty dollars for a thousand gallons and maybe the lower blesses and not have a bad winter and that'll be enough for the year but going if you have any questions don't be afraid to ask me I was going to tell you what was in the general fund but there's been a lot going on financially and uh the bank the the statements I get to balance the checkbook are coming later in the month so as soon as I have that I'll let you know but if you would go with me to Lamentations the third chapter and then if you want to mark your Bible to the 30th chapter of Psalms uh I'll read from about the uh this is what uh Jeremiah had to say I'll start at about the 21st this is what he said this I recall to my mind therefore have I hoped it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fell not no matter what the circumstances were Jeremiah had a a very good perspective on things that were going on there are they are new every morning and great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him the Lord is good unto them they wait on him and to the soul that seek him and then it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord and I was thinking about that this morning and jumping back to this 30th psalm I was about to say something I say a lot but I held my tongue here um David says the same thing in the 30th psalm you know I know I teach a lot of Sunday schools about the proper type of Hope a Christian should have the hope you have is to settled Affair between you and your savior this morning it's not a wishy-washy hope it's not a non it's a actual Eternal hope that God has given you if you've walked in faith into Jesus Christ you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost then no matter what happens to you in your life whatever circumstances are going on the end is already settled so that gives you a great hope in your life that you can hold fast of the truth that God's given you but I'll read this 30th Psalm this morning I will extoll thee Oh Lord for thou Has Lifted Me Up and thou has made my fullest to Rejoice Over Me O Lord I've Cried unto thee and thou has healed me and that's all we all hope that every day oh Lord thou has brought up my soul from the grave thou has kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit sing unto the Lord O ye Saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness you know David gives us perspective he gives us principles and his Psalms that we need to apply to our lives every day and he goes on the for his anger and door but a moment in his favor is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning and I was thinking that's what we were reading in Jeremiah and what he's saying here you know you've all had situations in your life wherever you know before you go to bed that night you got the whole world's weight on your shoulders you're wondering how you're going to make it no matter what that situation is you finally get to sleep and you wake up in the morning and everything seems just a a whole lot better or a little bit better well that's the same thing when you pray and you get before the Lord everything might seem hard like there's no way out and before you know it God will give you peace in your heart and there'll be a way out you know just what you're trusting in and what you're depending on make and I'll finish this this morning I apologize if I re-read the same scriptures again for his anger and Earth but a moment in his favor in his life weeping man door for a night but joy cometh in the morning and then my Prosperity I said I shall never be moved but by thy favor thou has made my mountains to stand strong thou didst hide my face and I was troubled I cried to thee O Lord and unto the Lord I made my supplications what prophet is there in my blood when I that shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth here Lord and have mercy upon me Lord be thou my helper thou has turned for me my more morning into dancing that was put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent O Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever and I'm just going to jump in my Thompson Chain reference Bible over here and I hope I marked it right I'll I'll just read a few of these scriptures that deal with you know with hope uh I'll just I'll read this one here from uh Corinthians the first chapter and the fifth verse I'm losing my training Authority here but acts 24 and 15. and I have hope toward God which they themselves also out loud that there shall be a resurrection of the dead but both of the just and the unjust so that's something we're all not going to escape but like I said a couple of minutes ago if Jesus Christ is in the center of your heart then there's no fear when you go to that direction and he goes on to say and uh Colossians the first chapter in the fifth verse for the Hope which is laid up for you in heaven wherefore you heard before in the word of Truth and gospel and then Titus the second chapter in the 13th verse looking for the Blessed hope and the glories appearing of our great God Our Savior Jesus Christ and then this last one is pretty important here and it and it's really it's Hebrews 6 and 18 and we all know the scripture by heart there are two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie so God is it's impossible whatever God promised in his word he's going to bring about it he can't lie he isn't lying to you if you hold faster the truth he gives you you'll be there on that day and he goes for God's Alive that we might have strong consolation who have fled for a refuge to lay hold upon the hope that set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul but sure in steadfast and which enter into within the valve so that's my hope this morning I hope everyone's hope is whatever promises God has given in his word that you need this morning he's more than able to meet those needs for you and like I said no one gets out of this life without a little struggle without a little problem but we all get out of this life of our relationship is right with the hope of knowing that God has set the course for us on the other side and I was thinking what brother Brad was saying about Spurgeon I mean people don't talk they called him the prince of preachers but you know the one thing he always brought people back to and and it's the same thing with brother Brian or any real man of God is they'll always bring you back to the word of God to the truth they won't have their own ideas or their own ways but everything they'll teach you is right back to the word of God brother Josh hey man let's down this morning I'm happy to be in this presence this morning man I want to welcome to all of our visitors it's good to have you here and we pray that you'll be blessed this morning let's sing that song are you Washed by the Water of the word hey

ever was a desire in the hearts of the people of God it is to be completely fully surrendered to the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ you love the Lord this morning amen good to be in the house of God you could be seated for just a little bit if you'd like I want to invite my wife to come if she will um get right into the preaching of the word of the Lord I want to tell you quickly while we're in this part of the service I get to the preaching part I'm going to forget it all together but I want to let you know that we did by the grace of God make it to the Congo just a few weeks ago remember I had y'all praying about that trip and we've been trying for several years to make it happen and uh just by the help of the lord we you know I'm going to say it like this just to sum it all up there's a lot of talk in here but just to sum it all up when it don't work it's the hardest most difficult thing you've ever seen in your life when the Lord's ready and it's time it just everything even the flights where I was sitting right down to even the waiters we got in a restaurant at Serbia Pepsi I mean they were just everything was just perfect and I just give you this little report if you don't mind me sharing it with you and uh all this talking I did through these years about asking you to pray about I better say something amen but um we were assembled together in a meeting that they as I understand been trying to put back together for about three or four years since the pandemic started and this particular meeting was one of not just a matter and Africa meeting or an African meeting but it was the African meeting as I understand it this is one they've been pushing to get to uh for a number of years there was over 800 ministers gathered at one time for a Minister's meeting the very beginning of it and as I understand there was four or five thousand here in the building and then behind us right behind us and you could hear them hollering amen but right over the window line there's about five more thousand kind of back tucked in this side over there and uh Laura Laura what are you doing here God bless you I've known that girl my whole life she's a buckeye amen oh and I O ain't that right says hey man oh my goodness I like to fell over I saw you over there Hallelujah Sam where'd you go it's Laura you didn't tell me you should have wiggled but anyways we um so as I understand it back behind us there was about five thousand gathered in the building there was a lot of them that couldn't come because their countries were restricting them because of covet and other things there was 25 000 online represented in the seven continents or but I think even the Penguins and the polar bears were listening to this meeting and uh so it was a very large Gathering and the message or the theme I should say was based upon the vision of brother Branham and the message now that we're at this time period online what do we do now where are we heading and what's the whole purpose of it and so you know just by the help of the Lord this may sound very arrogant you forgive me for this in advance I don't mean this to sound arrogantly but Americans have a better view of this than other countries do and I'll tell you why we are 20 years Beyond where many of them are just now coming into things so we experienced 20 years ago and it gives me a little bit of a special Advantage when I go there to be able to see where they're at in the conditions of it and you can almost like you're looking in the history book you can see the same behaviors and the same choices and things being made that we made that either put us in a better place or a worse place and so you know by the help of the Lord I'm able to see those things so when I go I can warn them and I can bless them I can give them caution and I can tell them Full Speed Ahead so it's been good and and we saw a lot of great effects I'm still getting messages and things from people saying you know how their lives were changed and all that that's what we go for we like to hear that and but can you imagine some 35 000 people tuned in at one time listening to The Messengers 30 speakers in this convention so there's a lot of great great preachers and we got to the very end of the meeting and as I understand it the place of honor in these meetings is the last one and so we get down to the last two hours to the meeting and they they whisked me away into this room to sit down and usually they serve your private like that as a guest they'll bring people food and things I thought well I've come all this way just to listen to some good preaching go home and be served in her or whatever and that was it all at once the door flew open and they started hollering come on come on it's your turn to church they have put me in the very Choice place of the entire meeting and I'm thankful to God for that because I got the opportunity to hear all what was being said then gather all of that up and bring a summary to it and I just feel like it was the mind of the Lord and really in a way and I don't mean this about me again if it sounds arrogant I don't mean it that way or prideful but I just see the hand of the Lord in it that you understand I'm on the road 52 weekends a year ago sometimes you know uh 60 70 000 miles a year all around the nation and what better person could God have chose than somebody's had that kind of bird's eye view of where we are around the message in the different churches to be able to project a vision to the people about where we are in the messes so I could see the hand of the Lord in it and God has given me give me a lot of Grace and give me words to say and how to say it and we heard nothing but one benefit after another for the things and the con and what was spoken things that we could share in our experiences so please from the bottom of my heart let me say how grateful I am how thankful I am for you being able to pray for us and uh you know hold us up before the Lord in prayer and whatever prayers you've contributed for the last few years we've been trying to make this happen it's mission accomplished at this point so we thank God for it remember not I'm saying these things not uh it's hard not to say it in a certain way it sounds braggy in a way I don't mean it that way as far as that goes anybody could preach the message but the point I'm making is that the Lord knows how to put the right people in the right places at the right moment to say the right things and that's what I'm meaning is that the Lord took all of this that I've done for the last 20 years full time and allowed me just to put that right out there before the people and when you see them sometimes leaning toward the prophet too much everything was brother Brown brother Brown brother Brown brother Brown I see as an American I go back 25 years and we did the same thing in the 80s and I can tell them too much on that that you're going to start leaning this way then you see certain doctrines and things sneaking in the back door you can say I I let me tell you where that led to brother Brandon called those in his life story Stepping Stones he said in May the life that I share with you today may be stepping stones that you won't make the same mistakes that we did so by the grace of God they uh they received a a very thorough explanation of what that looks like so let me put it that way but uh listen we love you and we thank you so much and I um I I didn't get many pictures to share maybe just one of the crowd or something I know when we come from Egypt I shared the presentation with you and um that was quite an extraordinary thing in itself seeing there's only one message Church in Egypt only one at this point and the way the Lord is beginning to break ground in some of these areas you can sit and listen and watch the people beginning to come up come up come up come up to some of the great Revelations that the Lord has been given to us here in the United States and uh being that this is Ground Zero what the Lord shares with us a lot of times it'll come here first because we got books and English is available that's a big thing just having English available then being French speakers you know it's a little more difficult to get the understandings the translations they don't know what hair and a biscuit means there's no translation for that and it was hair in a biscuit mean but I said a lot was like a hair and a biscuit a gaggy thing gaggy doesn't have a French word that I know of Amen but you know for us we catch that quickly especially some of you southern people here you know that speak that kind of uh hillbilly type you know cultural Southern type language like that you understand brother Brown plainly it took him a year to figure out what he was trying to get at and so you know we we get things a lot quicker here and uh but you I was really impressed to see the brother they're coming right up into the very understanding of not just the God sent a prophet but what was the message he was sent here to bring us and what is our position in it and seeing that made my heart swell brother I was swelling bigger than any number of people in that entire country out there just to see that because you want to see that if the bride is going to go all at the same time one in the bed and one in the field well then they have to have the same understanding the same Revelation they got to come up to the same place all of us have got to be on the same page you can't have some little kid down here not even understanding so to speak spiritually not understanding who Jesus Christ is and they do one or three or whatever it is and then all of us up here on the Capstone side and him down there not even know his position God's just as obligated that that one right there as he was this one right over here and the Lord will give us an equal type Revelation in many of those things now I know brother Brown said that there's a babe in Christ so if they're in Christ they'll go when the Rapture if their names on the boat they're going the Rapture comes but the majority of the bride of Christ should have some kind of understanding because this is the placing of sons and daughters in the last day so skim milk is part of it but we're Way Beyond skim milk into the understanding of who the mystery is all about that was me I was a part of that you you were a part of that Revelation and then to see the Brethren climbing into that realm that just does your heart so good you just want to scream and shout and holler and praise the Lord so thank God for it and um as far as that goes now leaving the meeting of course many places around the world now that you know hey come bring some of that over here and come visit us here in this that and the other way you know you don't just take every beating you get at least I don't I pray over them and pray over and pray over them but will you just add this prayer to the whole you know the conglomeration of the whole thing just pray that the Lord will lead me on whatever the next steps in the mission work is that he'll show me exactly where I need to go when and how I need to get there will you do that for me and man God bless you so much appreciate you again I hope I don't sound arrogant or prideful I'm just telling you how it was it's just it is what it is and there ain't no is or my grandma used to say and that's what it boils down to and uh but I appreciated you know the way the Brethren treated us everybody was real real nice and friendly and sweet and uh you get over there you know you're you're kind of like a celebrity to them because you're an American and I I got tickled at the young people they all wanted to get selfies with me I took so many selfies I I thought my face was going to split in half from smiling everyone himself everybody shake your hands so much you almost hand get raw and stuff like that you know and and uh but I did my heart good to see a lot of young men and women maybe 18 19 20 early 20s something like that just on fire for the Lord shouting and worshiping and praising the Lord so young people and there's many of you around the building this morning don't feel like you're alone in some of these other countries there's people that believes and loves and braces this truth just like you do in your heart just the same so be encouraged in the Lord and kind of make some of us older ones feel a little happy about it that those young people coming amen and I'm not so young anymore 45 now I know brother Florida I know I know he said I got he doing more I got food and refrigerator on you boy hallelujah amen but uh but anyways we we appreciate the Lord and we certainly love the people of God and uh what a privilege it is to be back here with you today thank you brother about it for receiving us and church body for receiving us we love you so much are y'all happy to see the Little Giant back here

know if I ever shaved mine my wife would roll in the bed and say who do you think you are who are you amen appreciate the Lord Jesus he's just so good to us and uh the Lord helping us I want to go this morning in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22. Ephesians 5 22 22 23 and 24. my speech this morning the Lord helping us upon the ministry of surrender the ministry of surrender you heard the song that we uh we're invited to the pulpit on surrendering the kingdoms of our heart and that was just absolutely uh directed by the Lord to sing that in the first place because that was exactly where I had my mind settled today I wanted to um I shouldn't say I had it settled I was 60 percent there and I just kept wondering what the Lord would do and how he would bring it and when the brother sang the song and and invited us I thought well that's what I've been waiting on is that little something I'll let you know amen Ephesians 5 22. now I know you're looking at your Bible already sisters just relax this is not a message on marriage and divorce I'm not going to try to get you straightened out I'm going to use this as a spiritual time like brother Brown did an invisible union he said that the natural marriage type the spiritual part and that's what we're going to show this morning is the spiritual condition the bride what she's able to do wives submit yourself under your own husbands as unto the Lord but the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ let so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything now let me just put a little piece in here like this Brothers when it says everything that doesn't mean that you need to know you know what day of the week she's going to go grocery shopping or you know what color clothes she's going to wear next Sunday what does referring to as in the Lord the things that are subjected to Christ the things that are given in the Lord I I forgive this this is not good Pulpit talk but I know men years ago when I was a boy that even wanted to know them women had to call to get permission to go to the bathroom and I'm not lying to you that I've had that had that experience of seeing that that ain't nothing but abuse come on Brothers louder that ain't nothing but abuse that's all it is right taking advantage of something in the Bible to make make a dictator out of yourself right the message Jehovah driver says a woman it is her name a trivial woman to surrender to a man and it is the nature of the church to surrender to Christ surrender to his will just surrender she has no thinking of her own she takes his word on somebody else's if Eve would have done that we would have never had to die but she listened to the reasonings but the real bride of Christ takes the headship of Christ the word hallelujah brother says and only believes God's word that's the real restored bride and it says it again hallelujah amen let's pray over the word can we why your heads are bowed this morning if you'd like to be remembered in prayer just let it be known by the lifting of your hand amen my hand's up to Lord Jesus what a privilege it is to come into this place we're so grateful Lord for the love that you've said abroad to all of us and father we are so grateful for the visitation of your presence today Lord Jesus in this service where we've assembled ourselves together we do it in the name of Jesus Christ knowing that thou art God and your angels in power and Supremacy is right here with us this morning to do all above what we could abundantly even ask or think now Lord we are opening our hearts to not only Thy word but to thy leadership and thy willingness to come and do for us what we cannot do for ourself take Thy word may you minister to us take me as a vessel may you use me to do it may I get completely out of the way that you could speak through my mouth and my actions and so forth law that you could bring great uh blessing as it were to the body of Christ not through me so much but through the word that will be spoken in this service May the power of God open the heart of every person Lord you've seen the hand that was raised every life that is represented in here this morning Lord with that hand in the air they have a need from you and God they're depending on you to be the one to see that need through Lord how many times our hand may have shot up wandering praying expecting waiting sometimes patiently sometimes impatiently oh God when's it going to come but Lord thou art mindful of a sparrow you're mindful of every time we put our hands in the air signifying we need your help we commit every need every spoken unspoken request Lord to the hands of Jesus Christ be with our Brethren actors Lord in all of the places that might be streaming in their homes or wherever they might be this morning and us here in the general assembly granted in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen and amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you really good we thank the Lord for the mercy of God you know that's another thing now that I'm pulling my jacket off they're not one of them preachers pulled their jacket off and hit 115 over there and I said how in the world do you preach with a code on your body I never understand that I said there's two things I learned you can't do in a coat you can't eat and you can't fight we're about to do both of them amen amen but we appreciate thank you brother we appreciate the Lord Jesus and I I want to take if God will help me this morning I want to take some of these little places that we're going to use as um uh as a parallel to the spiritual church and I want to just kindly dwell upon these verses in Ephesians for just a little bit and if you'll bear with me in some of the talk that I'm going to talk for just a moment about home and home life and things now again this is not a sneaky way for me to start laying it on to sisters so don't be nervous I know preachers do that sometimes but this is not a bad boy I'm not looking for a way to get the women in line I feel like that by God's grace that if a woman is right with the Lord and she's wanting to serve the Lord in the best way she knows how that the Lord can teach her and show her how how to submit properly and all of that so I I'm not here to tell you to get your bathroom breaks on the schedule for your for you for your husband okay that ain't gonna happen but I I want to use this not may sound strong what I'm going to say I want to focus just a little bit on the negative part of of women of what we know and remember when I say this now brother Branham tells us in marriage and divorce that when he's relaying it on hard about that prostitute type spirit and that unwillingness to have kids and all that kind of things he said now remember I'm not talking about you sisters I'm talking about the women of the world lady Lucia those without the Holy Ghost so it's the same thing here today and really ultimately my purpose in bringing this is I want to show us as the people of God the way that we are going to be able to not only surrender to the Lord but the way that it's already been put in us to be surrendered people because I guess um you know you're getting these prayer lines and your people the restaurants and you you know how does being a minister you hear a lot of things about oh I fight this battle and I'm troubled this way and that way and on and on and the main theme of all of it is is that some people just don't believe that they have the ability to surrender to the Lord and they're waiting for this one moment and I see this again and again and with Brad you know brother Paris you know when you deal with people they're waiting for some kind of lightning bolt push button pull a lever moment where all of a sudden they're going to hit this place in Christ where they're just gonna and become a surrendered Christian almost overnight immediately and on the moment on the spot the truth of it is is it's not so much that we don't have the ability to do these things it's that we as God's people have not recognized that it's laying in us already we just haven't learned how to tap into that part that has already been given to us by the Holy Ghost now girls you sitting around here that's unmarried you may think to yourself okay what's the future look like and what's the man I'm gonna marry look like and what kind of person is it going to be you'll wonder all of that and I know girls you've probably been many of the sisters are already married they could probably testify you've been planning your wedding since you were old enough to plan do you know exactly what kind of flowers you want uh what the building's probably going to look like we've got all of these plants laid out but I'm sure that on top of all of that there's also this curiosity within you what kind of a woman am I going to be what kind of wife am I going to be and the reason that if you'll stop and just think for a moment in a spiritual way the reason that you even consider things like that what kind of wife what kind of housekeeper what kind of uh you know just just name it right down the list of what you might be the reason you wonder those things is because God has already provided within you that working knowledge even though it may lay dormant it may lay suddenly underneath your subconscious kind of hidden in there God has already provided in you the ability to do the thing that's why you're even wondering about it in the first place because you see curiosity of that nature leads you to expression those are the things that when you begin to understand okay I want to be a good woman I want to be supportive I want to be a good cook or I want to be a seamstress or whatever it is for the house and and do what it takes to maybe even work or whatever the Lord leads you to do that Curiosity within you is God's given deep that's calling out to another deep and remember how the prophet paralleled that for us he said before there was a fit on a fish's back in other words before there was a wife there was already the characteristics laying in her to be able to do the thing that she was wanting to do before there was been on a fish's back uh there was water to put him in now think about this in terms of Adam and Eve now when Adam was created and Eve was taken from him as a byproduct nobody had to send Eve maybe over into the east side of Eden into a great big spot where they had leaves and things kind of built to go to wife's School and nobody had to teach her how to be submissive to her husband she was I'll say the word created but she was formed as we know as a byproduct she was formed in a manner that she already had within her the ability to know how to submit to Adam remember she was made in such a way that not only did she submit to the level of obedience and what maybe Adam would want or desire but even her own name reflected that submission because remember Eve was not given to her until after the fall if you'd have said the Bible of course says that their name was Adam so if you just said hey Adam both of them want to turn around and said hey it's me too because she was all that was the first metoo movement by the way and that really brings it back to the bride of Christ which was originally not named Pentecost Methodist Baptist this that and the other but she was under the identity of Jesus Christ from the very found foundation of the world you say how the prophet in 1959 tells us and of a message called we're not why we're not a denomination that when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world now when he was slain the blood of Christ was taken from his body and wrote on the Lamb's Book of Life all of the names remember your name didn't go on the other day you got saved the day you recognized Christ the day that you wanted to get saved but the reason that you even felt that way was because before there was a son a moon a star a speck of Stardust or planets or anything else your name was wrote on God's book associated with the lamb brother Graham said the first name that went on that book was the name of Jesus Christ then every name subsequently thereafter was placed upon that book wrote In the Blood of Jesus Christ which is by the way the reason why that the devil if he could ever cross that bloodline he would be my brother because not only is my name and my identity with the lamb but is it's wrote In the Blood of Jesus Christ now looking at the the unfolding of all of the characteristics of God look at the feminist part of Eve remember when God reaches into Adam and pulls out of his human spirit that feminist part this was not something separate from Adam this was a part of Adam in the beginning their Spirits were Blended together they were one they were in Oneness and now that blending is occurring in two different bodies but remember it wasn't so much that Eve somehow when she left the word it wasn't so much that I don't know how to say this exactly maybe the Lord helped me say this right but it wasn't so much that uh you know that when she fell that all of that went away I know a lot of people got this in their mind that when Eve fell in the Garden of Eden all of the good things about a person disappeared and they're true the Bible said that the tree that they partook of was not just a tree of evil but remember it was also a tree of good as well the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and even the prophet said a message called Blasphemous names that there can be characteristics in the human nature that would be similar to the nature so The Virtue uh the nature of the virtues of Christ he said some could be more patient some could be more temperate some could have that something about them that seems Godly in a natural way but it's not really the natural part uh the the spiritual part of Christ it's more of a natural passing down of goodness and good things that follow around families and uh down through generations like that now don't forget that when when Eve found all of the same characteristics of submission still laid within her just the same as it was with Adam and the prophet identifies it this way he said what is the Son of God he said in his State as he is now in his Fallen condition he said he is just an undone creation of God that is dominated by the devil so in other words he has all of the same potentials that he's always had but it's now dominated by Satan and friends that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost does for you and I it gives us the ability to move Satan away from that place of control so that we can now rule over the sin that once ruled us a nature of that personality all those things that trouble you so much the Holy Ghost gives you power over that remember it's the same thing on the other side of it being born again doesn't change this right here all of the bad stuff that lays inside of you all of the temper and the fighting and the bickering and the whatever else might be heightening your cells all of that is still there but remember said my conversion never took out of me my love for the woods he said I've always been a Woodsman a lover of nature he said even my conversion didn't take that out of me so there are places in us that are very good places in us that are very bad but God created the human being in such a manner that all of those characteristics will remain even you take some women that don't know that nothing about church that never named The Name of Christ they've never gone but you watch them they they're good moral type people that have been raised in the type of family to show respect to give honor where honor is due and even a natural woman without a speck of the baptism of the Holy Ghost has that something about her to submit to somebody and this is where it gets trouble uh when you get into the side about a woman that just chases and chases and chases looking for that one person to kind of settle her and then she doesn't find it there so she runs to the next one so don't find it there she runs to the next one the next one the next one and what it is deep within her is this call or this place that God that is something that God placed within her to want to be submissive to the man don't want to submit herself to a leader and to submit herself to leadership and what a thing the devil has done in this last day by honing in on the women's rights and the women's Liberation and women's empowerment and he tries to focus that woman that listen you don't need a man you you don't need it it's impossible for you to succeed while this guy's lording over you and actually that's what the devil has told a big lie you see a man and a woman that knows their positions and knows how God made them and can work together in Tandem and work together as a one unit as a team they fight together they laugh together they love together they fail together they succeed together that is one of the most powerful units that has ever been seen on the face of the Earth amen it is the very backbone of every assembly every church every place every person here today is a part of a family unit in some way or another let a man start breaking that let a woman start getting out of that position and watch and see how it sends shock waves to a church let a man or woman get caught up in drugs or adultery or some kind of a sex sin or some kind of a A thieving type thing they get caught lying or they get caught look at how that one little thing sends a shock name not just through one assembly but thanks to Facebook and the rest of the social media and buying their brother knows it by midnight so there we have a conglomeration if you will of a family is setting you know in churches this Patriarchs and matriarchs isn't it I mean you look and you think uh most of our Memphis churches are made up uh maybe one or two families that they come there many years ago and then you've got this son and that daughter and they're married to this family and they're married to that one they got grandkids and cousins and it's all kind of associated together and the family unit is the strongest part of the church not the single people and those that are in bad situations merrily aren't strong but I mean what kind of strength can be shown by a man and woman that can hold themselves right live right before the Lord and live in a place to where they can project that relationship upon the rest of the church when you see families many times that the husband's always at a life and the wife is always at the husband and people they call it that awful isn't that terrible they're always picking at one another let me tell you something more I've been married going on 25 years Samantha and I we fuss sometimes we nitpick at each other we pick at each other we joke we Josh we laugh we cry we fuss we get angry and when we first were married we were nothing but a bunch of kids we rolled in the floor with handfuls of each other's hair screaming and throwing things and acting like a bunch of children but you know what brother Brad we did it together we've done it together if we fought together we did it if we laughed together we did it and brother that's what Jesus Christ wants us to do with him amen no matter what maybe follow us in this life no matter what might come before our doorway he wants us to do it with him laugh with him love with him fight with him and stand by the side of of Jesus watch him Stand By Your Side the same way amen young people get this idea out of your brain that marriages are made up of that stuff you're reading books and see on social media and that big Hollywood thing walking arm and arm and the sunset amen the hair blowing just so so thank God they got hair to blow at my age you start praying that God let us stay in amen some of us are fortunate for it to turn gray some of us are fortunate enough for it to turn loose come on somebody now what I'm trying to say to you is that this is what real life looks like you know it troubles me it troubles me when I see preachers in this message tried to create this spiritual Utopia of marriage that oh if you've got the Holy Ghost you'll never have a problem and you'll never have a fight you'll never have an argument what kind of imbecile is leading the church that is not reality see that is not human life and you know what happens that kind of preaching has such an influence that when the doors closed and you guys are having World War five not even three you've been skipped to five then you start feeling condemned and upset in your spirit oh oh we don't even have the Holy Ghost no Holy Ghost filled people fight three-eyed three eye blinks two head nods and a couple amens right brothers and sisters argue husbands and wives fight people in the church disagree with one another the word say man in case you forgot it right we preach such a a standard of oh one of these days we'll reach such a plateau in God that will never have another argument I don't know if you've been smoking and funny cigarettes or not smelling some kind of chemical in the air where you were but that is not reality the reality is this my friends that you'll have all of those kind of things in your life but the Holy Ghost will bring you to such a plate of growth to where you'll know how to repent quickly you know how to straighten the mess up you'll know how to move on immaturity and walk like a son and a daughter of God ought to do when they mess up and the church said amen right but that lays in the heart I hear young people young people all the time talking about how that they struggle with different things everything from sex to music to you name it and and the reason they struggle is because deep in their heart they want to live right but if we're not careful by the time I'm afraid what we've done is preach such a manifested Utopia of the spiritual parts of God that we have forgotten how to teach them to be young people how to teach them that they are going to have days they're so confused that they don't know which way is it's up and down they are going to have sexual battles and they're not going to know how to how to how to deal with it or how to approach it they are going to succumb to Temptations and girls will be tempted to do this and boys be tempted to do that brother the key is not to take their Humanity away from them but to show them how to surrender to the hands of the Lord so that God can help them whip all of that Lydia see and mess somebody say Amen right because we've heard this our whole life don't look at me that way I was raised to this message I've been in this message since I was born I know how our preachers have preached I know how our people have told us oh you get God in your life all of that goes away and why ain't it gone away in his life because I guarantee you by the end of the day you could pull the book on that portray be just as guilty as you are about everything else he tells you not to do amen listen friends our Prophet didn't keep a cross hanging in his car because he believed he was an angel our Prophet didn't have brothers around him all the time out in meetings like that gone three months of the clip with from his wife and family and them because he thought that he was some holy you know some holy uh uh uh infallible Prophet that could never succumb to temptation other man knew what kind of man he was he knew what kind of person he was he knew his weaknesses and he knew his strengths and knew how to cover himself that's the key by the way that he could overcome in every situation that would come by him you think Brothers didn't get offended you think there were times he didn't want to grab somebody by the nape of their neck and throw them out of the church you think we're taught listen to him sometimes when he's preaching one time he was going on and he was just laying into some of these preachers and these people about the way they treat the Lord in church he said some of the stupidest he's excused me for that that's a little bit too strong let me say that differently that proves to me when you hear things like that brother bam understood what reality of humanity looked like this is like in sicknesses we go through these physical battles in our body and then immediately immediately we start questioning whether we're even Sons and Daughters of God because we've got this belief in our mind that if I'm a born-again Christian I should be the picture of Health look around if I started asking right now how many of you here take high blood pressure pills if I started asking how many is on insulin how many has to see a doctor twice a year for this how many has that blood work for that every person in here would have to raise their hand to some kind of Affliction or ailment in some way or another and for you that are the picture of Health don't sell me your vitamins after church I've got my own little regimen unless it's Brother Floyd then I want to know the secret [Laughter] the thing that I'm saying is that we got to understand what Christianity how it's really designed because you take a person that enters into this wall Brethren tells us and there's many places I could read I'm trying to omit the reading but the thing that we've got to understand is how many times the prophet would say just type in some time flowery bed of ease let's look again how many times brother Adam said some people try to present Christianity like it's a flowery bed of these you know why he's saying that because the preachers of his time and those evangelists and those leaders in his time were telling everybody come to Christ and don't Prosper greater than you better prospered I can tell by the look on some of y'all's faces even without my glasses I can tell that you don't believe that and the church age but the prophet said the majority of God's people are poor people some of you right now struggle from paycheck to paycheck to paycheck but here's what the devil tells you and the preachers leaders spiritual people in the church what glory to God if you were living where you should Hallelujah you shut money running out of your ears I learned a long time ago don't take advice from broke people and just because their didn't mean they always got it honestly sometimes listen I'm a business major and I met a lot of these business folk and I hear their stories in the lunchrooms and that said that when the maybe I should stop there I can understand what their deal is they'll step on anybody that undercut the mother if it took that to get a get a get a buck in there that's not necessarily because God gave him the wealth they just took whatever skills that God gave them they used it for the wrong thing right being wealthy is something that if God puts a lot of money in your hands you know why God give you that money to take care of your family and to give from the abundance of your receiving to the other ones that need the help and the grace and that's where rich people usually fall off the wagon I'll give my money to somebody else that's what Paul said if you believe the Bible he said give to those like maybe I should take up an offering right now do you understand why a lot of this stuff has been propagated around the message just because people have missed the key element of all of this it's not about what you can do it's about how you can surrender I mean think about it for us to sit down right now with a tape recorder and let's just make it like a little room type thing like brother I'm running them through the roof each one sits here with us ministers gives your story let's say we give you 10 minutes to give your story could you imagine after it was all those 10 minutes was collected about what maybe 100 people said you know what your number is you take all of their stories right down to the littlest one you might walk in the door and say I was playing my toys and my brother bought my toy okay all them stories imagine how different they're all gonna sound imagine the variety that consists in all of those stories like that and yet God gave us a one-size-fits-all answer Glory Brother Brad that is surrender you see this is where the devil tries to take people and measure them against one another so you see your background maybe sister you're someone that didn't have your virtue when you went to the Altar and maybe you were somebody that slept around or was a party girl or you had some guy like I don't have to be you women here today I mean just around the message in general let's say you come to your husband you confess them things out made it right and all come to the altar with no unresolved issues and everything was known and he confessed to you the same way you confessed to him don't forget there's always two sides to that goal nobody needs to find out about a girlfriend that they used to have seven months after they've been married that needs to be said seven months before the marriage come on I see sister Laura's sitting out there I I had a I have a sweet on Amy Laura's sister years ago and uh we went to church together one time and you know just really really far apart and you know even had to call long distance and things like that you know as a 16 year old 17 year old boy it wasn't really in the cars for me number one I didn't have enough money to make all them phone calls and it just didn't work out but I liked Amy I still like him I think she's a good girl but I didn't hardly even say hello to Samantha but I wasn't ready to start telling her about all of the girlfriends and the people and whoever and all that it's a very short list relax I know some of you boys would probably take a few days to get that thing out you're going to need a but that's the honesty of the thing right let me move into something else it all comes to surrender no matter what the background is you get the point I'm trying to make Paul even said it about the Pharisees measuring themselves against themselves that are not wise then somebody might say yeah I sat with a few ministers one time I was about maybe 25 26 something like that so it's been about 20 years ago and I was sitting there in this one old boy he said well you don't know nothing about the world do you because I started preaching at 14 the Lord Sanctified me at a young age and you know and and the Reason God did it is because he knew how Wild I was kind of got me earlier I'd have been a mess at all he got me early not because that makes me more holy holy he got me because I'd have been more Unholy than holy oh yeah I'm a norob through and through and our people were wild men Nordic it comes to the NORAD it comes from Nordic which is Vikings imagine any kind of History you hear about the Viking there I am you know I never dragged never smoked you know my brother used expression the first kiss at the altar yep I understand all that doesn't make me nothing does the Lord put me in that position so I could preach and do what I'm doing and these brothers you don't know nothing about smoking do you you don't know nothing about running to bars do you and they're such a made fun of me for 45 minutes while they sat and bragged about all the bars they run to and all the women they slept with and all the drugs they did and I thought maybe perhaps you've done a few too many drugs because you've almost sound like your brain ain't working too well sitting here just bragging about something like that to me that's not a badge of honor to me that's things that you understand and say God thank you for delivering me from that stupidity brag about you know when we talk to our kids you know we try to tell our kids glory to God I used to be the biggest on if he'd be just hold still Old Faithful keep that stuff in there testify to him about how God can deliver you don't go through all of the details I don't need to know that stuff besides your mama if I was a kid I wouldn't want to hear my mama talking that way but all of those varieties of backgrounds imagine what every story would be like if you just get up here and play it one time and somebody might say well glory to God I'll have you know I was and then somebody come along and say well I was raised in the message and I really don't know much you know and there's somebody see you there you don't know nothing about the grace of God don't you ever say that especially for our young people raised to this message some of you older ones listen to brother Ben don't you ever believe because you come out of Pentecost Methodist Baptist don't you ever believe that our kids have not had to overcome just as many if not more denominational Spirits than you did they've been exposed to everything not by the baller's fault not just preacher's fault I don't mean that but they've been exposed to everything from Facebook to Twitter you name it uh people they go to camps with people that they go and associate in special meetings with they bring all their baggage with them when they go to them camps that's why you better know before you make moves like that you better know you're sending your kid into the right place strong enough to be able to withstand some of them secret private conversations in them cabins well ain't nobody looking amen I know I got girls of my own I know how it is I hear the stories they tell one young lady come back from the camp told my wife she said how discouraged she was because every girl in the in the cabin was standing down there and one of the big dorm rooms that every one of them was putting their makeup on getting ready to go to church I'm talking about kids born in the message raised in the message don't you ever think because you come from the outside in that you got you had more to overcome than them actually they're the ones that have more to overcome than you did because it's obvious to see when you're a part of trinitarian church it's obvious to see once you see the Oneness of the godhead what the better version was right but when you've been raised here in brother Ramset brother Brian said the Bible said brother Madison the prophet said you talk confusing it takes the Holy Ghost to discern all of that to lay it out plainly before you to show you what is truth and what is not truth and sometimes it's such a fine line a razor blade line between some of them elements you don't really know which way is up and which way is down listen brother it took me 10 years I was raised in a church that said you know many of you know this I was raised in a church that was leaning toward return Ministry for many years and it was about time I was married whenever the pastor come full blown with brother Brown coming back setting up a tent nobody had the Holy Ghost but the prophet we can't even get rapture and faith going through a little room on and on and on and on you talk about confusing this is the same man I watched pack a little bible in his pocket and knew the Bible so well you could start a verse and without even looking he could wreaking finish quoting it and tell you everywhere the prophet said associated with it humble lived a good life a Godly life with just that little bit of something in there is just enough to confuse you that if you don't have the mercy of God in your life and if you don't seek for the leadership of the Lord my young friends you listen to me you've been raised this message if you don't have that in your life you talk about confusing and when they jump on these websites and they see the Bergens and the Collins boy out there throwing all that stuff before them by the time see it seems like more clarity to them all them guys are doing is they are honing in on supply and demand there is a demand for people to see something different they've supplied something different many of the folks that run after these websites and these false things about brother random stop and think for a minute who you're talking to now this is public knowledge I'm not saying this behind us back a Collins boy was thrown out by Wilbur Collins brother Collins for sexual indiscretion turned over to the devil you want him as your Authority go back and look at the lives of these men they've made themselves public go back look at them how many Devils have they cast out how many sermons have they preached how many people have they led to Christ in the ways they've done those are the authorities but you see people run after that because they're so confused about themselves and our leadership has done nothing I mean I can't say we into nothing we've done nothing to really settle the people into this idea that that stuff is going to be out there and yes you're going to see confusion in your own ranks but in all of that mess there's going to be a truth laying in there somewhere that if you'll just surrender yourself to the word of God and to the will and the leadership of the Lord watch God just spread all that mess lie open in the Red Sea and show you what is thus saith the Lord if you want to know it's there for you to know amen hallelujah my sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they will follow amen but the ministry of surrender this is where we've got to know I've got the ability to surrender to him no matter what my past looks like no one of my back no matter what the background may be I've got the ability to surrender to him and all of that makes up his bouquet there's going to be some people standing on the other side and be able to declare I was a drunk and God delivered me I was this I got delivered me I was that God delivered me and they're going to be some people that was raised in this truth to be able to say I was associated with all kinds of confusion and the Lord brought Clarity to my soul and mine now let's turn to First Peter chapter 5 verse 5. can I go a little bit further thank you appreciate it I know some of you probably feel like I'm just getting started but we've been going 45 minutes already the anointing will do that for you hopefully the naughty will stay for at least 30 more minutes praise the Lord now listen First Peter chapter 5 verse five likewise she younger submit yourself unto the Elder yay all of you repeat that with me all of you be subject one to another be clothed with humility for God resists the proud you don't want God resisting you a lot of people in this world if they turn their nose up at you that's one thing but you don't want God resisting you when your creator turns his nose up at you that's a bad thing bad very bad gives grace to the humble how many wants Grace he gives it to the humble now not this false humility you know how people are I'm just an old spare time yeah we know humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time now notice this a message the meanest man in Santa Maria says when Rebecca came to meet Isaac did you notice she veiled her face he said that they'll still do it today he said they don't know what they're doing he said but the bride veils her face why the man is her head the nature of a woman is to yield to a man that's the reason the church should be veiled it's got a head that's Christ so here Peter is saying be failed with what humility now listen for his false humility that we see in the ranks of this message it God help me say this it makes me so sick to my stomach I feel like puking all over the floor I get so aggravated to people sometimes I get aggravated me too don't think I don't but I get aggravated to people you know you somebody sings a song or something and you know you said man I like that song man that was good I just just be gracious just be honest thank you I appreciate that that really helps me God ain't looking for false humility about to put on trying to be humble that's why I told you some weeks ago preaching here at the church some some months ago you look at our girls they all look the same flat shoes same type of hairstyle same type of dresses I'm not saying that we don't need holiness but if we ain't careful we're going to reach a spot where we're going to be manufacturing it rather than seeing individuality amongst the masses God doesn't want us to be a manufactured bride go back in the message look up manufactured sometime they're manufacturing the latter rain he said no such thing as that it's got to be something that is born out of the individual experience with Christ themselves right there's one man one time was just burning these women up for curling their hair glory to God if you had the Holy Ghost you girls wouldn't curl your hair you're just wanting a man stupidest thing I've ever heard my I thought man wake up she's a girl girls want to curl their hair I'm just rejoicing the boys don't praise the Lord but this is what I'm saying we have made Christianity an element of something that we do and if you read the Bible at all you can't offer him nothing if you do the minute you offer him something listen carefully the minute you offer him something you are trading law and Grace [Music] because there's nothing that you and I can do as Sons and Daughters of God to ever Merit the salvation and the mercy and the grace and the righteousness of God God somebody preached to me nothing we can do to marry you can live holy every day of your life have your sins forgiven and thrown as fire as the East is from the West you can be absolutely committed to the Lord in every way and still go to hell this is not a matter of how how much do I can do how much can I offer he's never asked us for that he's only asked us to sir give over to Jesus I know what I'm getting ready to say is going to be controversial but it Bears to say because it's true in our message we have movements we've all had them where people think salvation especially for the young people it's about coming into altar screaming and running and laying on the floor and crying let me tell you something friends it would do my heart good to see my babies sprawled on the floor crying tears out of their eyes screaming the name of Jesus and throw me to death as a daddy throw my heart better than anything I can think of but as a preacher for right now 31 years around the world I've watched him do it not my girls not the people I've watched people do it and in six months not a thing change in their life I know what I'm getting ready to say is controversial and I'm not trying to say this in a way to throw out emotion we believe anybody knows me at all knows that I believe in worshiping the Lord and being an emotional person and shouting and praising the Lord and if God shout you then God shouts you if God cries with any cries and thank God he does it but there will be many of our young people in this message receive new birth that may not make a speck of emotion if we're not careful we'll be critical of that way we got it yes but they wasn't raised in the same atmosphere you were raised in when Matt and Laura and I come into the truth and we started coming to the Lord amongst our young people of that generation not just for 25 years 30 years now the people of that generation were very emotional all their calls and running and dancing and screaming that was the kind of environment that we were born under was at that time many of you remember back in the late 80s and the 90s there was such a Revival type feeling amongst message people and now you got to go into a place and you've almost got to put on a clown suit and dance like a bear to get them to even say Amen they're just not enthused about nothing come on you know I'm telling you the truth I just hear me anywhere they'd lost that passion that excitement for the word of God and they don't have it like they used to the environment the atmosphere the culture has changed completely so what are we supposed to do try to revive it back up and bring the emotions back in why don't we just let God lead this thing and instead of being the type of leaders I'm not the same preachers now but leaders at home and leaders in the church how about we just say okay this is the culture of people now this is where they're at and God can use this like he can use anything else hey if he could use a rooster and he could use a donkey he can use any kind of atmosphere he can use any kind of environment so I mean you're looking at me because you don't believe that but I'm telling you the truth see that that hits our denominational Spirit we hold they get it they got to get it like I got it but they're different person than you and I believe that there'll be a group of young people they'll be completely Born Again by just simply surrendering to what they've been told their whole life as the land is taken little by little so will I believe that experience will be the same way they may not make a move in church but brother you'll catch them one night everybody's in bed lights are off you go to the hallway down to the bathroom or something of course you've scheduled it with sister I'm sure made sure got permissions and everything Sam my list is coming don't worry they're not ridiculous call them on the phone can I go to the bathroom they should have met my red-headed mother about 30 years ago yeah I'll tell him when I'm going to the bathroom all right so all of a sudden you might walk down the hallway and you'll see a light on peeking the doorway sitting there with the Bible open maybe a tape plane in the background don't overlook that don't devalue that they're learning and being led by the Lord in the culture that they're being raised in that Revival Spirit has died down to such a point to where you call a meeting now call one get the biggest preachers you know of get the get this so celebrities of the message get the most visible men you can think of bring them in all be said about 30 minutes after the church started pastors are set in the back office going I just don't know where everybody's at they usually come to these things now of course every Church ain't this way but the majority of them are people just don't support things like they used to again the culture the environment has changed as Minister we have to adapt to that I have to adapt to that I have to grow and change and I have to flex with the people I preach to so when I see young people that come up with a genuine desire to want to be in service to the Lord I don't stand there and say all right now Lord God Shake That World maybe he's already shook it if I keep my mouth shut I'd see that me grabbing them by the hair of their head and shaking them all over the platform is not evidence that God's dealing with them there's not evidence he ain't dealing with them in this day and age for someone to make a move at all is evidence that God's doing something I'll take it I don't care if it's just a little finger wiggle I'll take it I'll treat it like it was a holy ghost golly washer shot in Revival for some people and I preached to many of them for years that aren't just emotional if I see them do like that in church I've had good God that had Holy Ghost Revival tonight sometimes you've got to accept people the way they're made but around said God deals with them the way he's built to think he's an artsy type person God will deal with them through art of his musical of the music if he's acting like you're dealing through intellect wow some of you young people said how are you going to get to the right experience if in your mind you think the only way I can get there is I've got a shot and speak in tongues and run all over the place I'm so glad you come to church this morning that I got the privilege to tell you this just surrender to what you know is right to what you know is true and whatsoever things will be holy of good report virtue on and on and on surrender thank upon these things and moms and dads it's up to us leaders uncles answer who you are it's up to us to adapt as well to learn that they don't do things the way we think they should do it listen kids of this generation they got a different language than what I understand my girls come in for my school sometimes and they'll say little things to me and just cackle and laugh and I ain't got the slightest clue what they're saying to me my my middle daughter annalize come to me the other day I said something about you know some little thing of truth that it was some little you know and she looked at me she said No Cap foreign that used to be cool many years have gone out of the bridge since then so as a leader what am I supposed to do look at that and say you girls are just rotten if I love them right I've got to work with them in the capacity in which they are living in now you say but the Bible don't change the message don't change the prophet said uh-huh see there you go that right there proves you're on the wrong side of the fence already stop hitting people in the face with quotes and start thinking use the brain God give you at the same time discern the time that you're living in the hour you're living it discern the face of this of the skies and what's going on around you and know the message of God intended for another generation don't just focus on things like we have glory to God if they've got the Holy Ghost they won't have Facebook in their house maybe they will because I could go back 30 years and some of the things that you called The Devil is nothing but an innocent little lamb today unless should this be a good time for me to enter into the monitor conversation come on some of you'll reveal it's not about to Facebook it's not about the Instagram I'm not supposed to put buzz in from Facebook Instagram I'm trying to be cool I'm trying desperately it's not about those things it's about whether they can surrender to the word now granted if some of those things are causing them a problem if an eye offense pluck it out if the arm's having a problem cut it off spiritually speaking of course you can't look down your nose at every kid you mean they got a Snapchat maybe they do they're going to go through the same type of environment in their own way as what we've gone through ours let me hurry listen to this in second Chronicles chapter 34 or verse 27 God said because thine heartless tender he tells Israel that is to Humble thyself before God when thou hardest the words against this place and the inhabitants thereof and against them humbled by self before me and you rich your clothes and wept before me he said I've even heard they saith the Lord now if I was to take this and I would say okay you Gentiles ain't sincere you're not humble none of you Gentiles me include none of us are sincere because when we hear the word of the lord we don't rip the beard out of our face and tear our clothes apart and throw dirt and Ashes on our face and weep in the middle of the street for days you don't do it you're not spiritual environment they were raised in this is how a Jew showed their humility they position themselves in a way to where when they were showing God that they were sincere about what he said the first thing someone did was pluck their own beard out of their face oh God that's painful even thinking about that they take their clothes and just rip a big hole in them and they'd start rocking on the grounds they put dirt and things over their face this was a symbolic way that they showed Jehovah God we are sincere about what you're telling us do you know what the equivalent is today being able to wake up in the morning and raise your hands on the side of your bed and say Jesus you are my my boss my God my leader being able to go through the day and fight against the things that are wrong struggle against the evils of the day some of that humility looks like the way you dress ladies boys the way you behave to women and things the way you behave to one another that shows our humility in much the same way that they did and if we want to point back to that culture and say if we're going to be spiritual we got to be like that well then that same idea shouldn't follow down to us that we in our generation middle age and above should look at the Next Generation and say you're going to have a different way than what we did and what they did the ministry of surrendered all of us have that Ministry you may never be called to preach and if you're a female you'll never be called to preach on Facebook Instagram or anywhere else for that matter but you have a Ministry and that is to surrender to the Lord let me let me read you something before we go can I get a little bit more time out of you anybody in a hurry I know brother Thomas got a wedding to get to after a bit I hope I ain't holding you too long for them watch us now in Psalm chapter 10 verse 17. Lord thou Hast heard the desire of the humble thou will prepare thy their heart that will cause thine ear to hear so you see when your desire is to be submissive now listen listen it doesn't mean you succeed in submission it doesn't mean you're perfectly surrendered but when your desire is to surrender oh I fear the Holy Ghost this place Hallelujah he says Thou will prepare thine heart for what to receive Grace to receive Mercy to receive wisdom understanding counsel and consolation from the Lord who is our comforter he actually prepares my heart to receive it by being what just humble well if it's that way with faith and joy and peace and healing what about the Rapture what about Resurrection if my desire is to be surrendered to the Lord we'll also prepare my heart to come up when he comes for me Proverbs 16 19 better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly then divide the spoils with the proud Psalm 29 23 a man's Pride shall bring him low but honor shall uphold The Humbling spirit Isaiah 57 15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that hadth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell God said in the high and holy place with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit Glory to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones how many wants bride's Revival I just read you how to get it God said he would bring Revival to those that are humble and those of a contrite spirit he said I dwell in the high and lofty places with those that have the same kind of spirit I do [Laughter] glory to God no wonder Paul said we send Heavenly places with him because the way up is always down now listen to this let me close he questions answers brother Brown it says is it just three more minutes he says if I can to get something short here maybe he said I remember I can't give completely over to Jesus have I an evil spirit he said let me spend the rest of the time on that you can't surrender to Jesus he said I don't know who you are man a woman he said I can't tell which it is God knows that but you can't surrender to Jesus why what's the matter he said if you're a woman don't you have to surrender to your husband to be a wife surrender all that you are little lady when you were married virtuous follow your life to stay virtuous one day you found a man that you loved you were his completely and those things that you fought against all of your life try to live clean clear virtuous you surrender every bit of it to that one man is that right he says you put yourself completely in his hands you are his and all that you stood for decency moral and everything like that you turn it over to this man because you surrender yourself can't you do the same thing to Jesus Just Surrender yourself that way and then in quotations whether I'm says It's Like a Prayer like you're saying to him all that I am all my mind all my thoughts he said you with them uh thoughts like that he said don't I don't think it's an evil spirit that you're possessed of but he said an evil spirit certainly anoints you with them kind of thoughts so even brother I was telling this woman or man everywhere it's not that you can't surrender it's just the devil's telling you you can't do it let me go on record right now every single one of us can surrender to the Lord everybody let me get the balcony so I don't miss anybody in the rooms in the back all of us have the ability to surrender like I said starting out sister that thing that was placed in Eve is carried all the way down 6 000 years later that's in women right here today the fall didn't take that away from her the same thing with the person whoever they are they have the ability to surrender to Jesus praise God so let me show you something why would you want to surrender to him because there's something calling you to surrender the very fact she was even or he was even asking this question if it was it's a very good sign you ought to surrender yourself the very reason you want to know is because God's helping you to want to know the answers in the question if you didn't want that you wouldn't care wouldn't bother you you wouldn't be interested in it but the very fact that you want to know how do I get closer to God it's because God's in there trying to get a hold of your heart to let you know I want you to surrender they say but rather be in aha I I've just got so much the Bible said a day with the Lord is a thousand years a thousand years a day do you think your little 40-year 50-year 60-year whatever you are a little spot in time means all that big of a deal to a god that a thousand years is like a day do you realize when all of this is over with I'm talking about church ages and everything and the new new city sets down on this Earth seven thousand Church years has passed God's gonna do this whole message what a week to him what is your 15 minutes of this or 30 minutes of that or six month battle or one year of this or that thing so a God that looks at a day like it's A Thousand Years it's a tiny little Whistle Stop so when we go to him oh I've got so many problems I've got so many just look at the size of what you're talking about verses of God how much you think he's seen in a thousand years hello and how many billions has he seen it with come on you preached to himself uh-huh I know I'm a little over time and I never killed nobody yet just hang with me man I'd have quit 20 minutes ago but the Lord been dealing with people I'm trying to hold on to it as hard as I can just say to yourself well you just don't understand I I just don't I just don't feel that way you don't have to feel that way I just don't want it you don't have to want it just be obedient to it because what you need to understand is your feelings to you I've met thousands of people and have counseled thousands of people around this world that have told me emphatically I don't feel it Barry dig down to that buried recesses of their subconscious long enough and that little want to is hiding underneath all of that stuff pile on top of it sometimes you bury things so deeply you convince yourself it ain't that way if you just start surrendering the pile underneath that pile is a genuine desire to want to serve God you say it ain't neither then why are you here well you said in this piece for oh my mommy made me come I've met kids whose mommy tried to make them come it's a bigger mess than what you're talking about hello I've met daddies who forced their kids to come oh yeah that that lasts for only just a little spot of time no you're you're here because the Lord Jesus has given you a chance to get right to surrender fully oh I felt that oh yeah that's right preaching them young people that's right get them right I'm saved already I don't need it buddy boy see that's arrogance when you hear something like that about a young person that's older ones ought to be saying God help me even to do triple that so I can prove to them what it looks like what surrendering really is all about I don't care how long you've been saved how long you've been served the Lord whether we be a preachers or not every one of us need to continually Die daily which means a surrender daily repent daily keep ourselves right with God if we don't the Rapture is not in our future last comment we go on home Christ is only going to Rapture these kind of people I don't care who you are what your name is how many times you put in a bucket if you ain't that you'll be left here when the tribulation begins because God will not associate himself with a bunch of prideful stuck-up message people that think they've got the market cornered on Holiness God Revelation and everything else he's not looking for a monopoly on Christ he's looking for people that are just so grateful and just so gracious to him that I could be a part of this great program just to think he would call me me out of the millions and billions in the world out of all the generations of all the educated and the wealthy and the good-looking and the fantasy take all the way down through that and he'd go to Ohio and get a worthless nut foreign they call us Buckeyes you know what a Buckeye's good for nothing it is a worthless nut God took this worthless nut Hallelujah glory to his name [Music] that he made all things beautiful in his time I don't deserve it I didn't work or Merit for it he had mercy upon whom he'd have mercy compassion upon whom he had compassion and brother Brad I'm just grateful to be a part of it brother Matt I'm just thankful that Jesus thought of me as being a part of his plan have I made a million mistakes oh sure have I messed up with zeros on the end yeah but at the end of the day who ain't we we puff ourselves they did that but I would never do that but what you're doing is even worse than what I should have ended a few seconds ago I had you right where I want you you was happy on the mountain then I got to say these things like you they're not a person living that don't experience this kind of move in their life you're going on going going and all of a sudden wamo Lord it's like the little book are you there God it's me Margaret she's always going back to him back to the well you know are you there God is me Margaret all of us have experienced mistakes to that magnitude to where we just think I might as well just forget it I might as well quit sure we've all been through that but you say well how am I supposed to whip it I'm so glad you asked me keep surrendering keep humbling keep making yourself littler and littler and littler and every time you blunder go back to him and say Lord Jesus it's just one more bit of proof that without you I'm of all men most miserable you back your hands with me just a moment and even before the musicians come just everybody I want I want everybody to have a moment I didn't keep you here bundle ten to one for no reason this my friends that's where they say the rubber meets the room when you come to the end of the planting like this and the seeds gone in those hearts now's where the attention and the attraction turns from me giving it to you doing something with what's been given to you now I want you to think within your spirit I want all the young girls all the young boys all the middle aged all the old ones I don't care what your station of life is I want you to think for a moment look back at every issue you've ever had every problem you've ever confronted maybe things you're going through right this very moment just just boil it all the way down to the very bottom line of it all what does it really boil down to I just wasn't surrendered like I should have been every time you got mad and said bad words or every time you got mad and yelled at somebody or every time you got mad and kicked the door in or done some kind of crazy thing I'm just being ridiculous not this may not fit you but just making examples every time you got offended or hurt for no reason to you as a reason but really when you looked at it back on the passive line man what are you getting mad about that every time somebody just slighted you and maybe you're sitting here with a genuine offense sure but maybe your reaction to that wasn't like it should have been not as Godly not in this right place stop and think for a moment children of God what's the real answer to all of it I just wasn't surrendered like I should have been the very moment any human being ever who they are gets to thank him that they can control their lives that is a person that doesn't understand the grace of God Grace means that you're willing to relinquish your control so that he can help you while you're walking while you're moving while you're pressing try and fulfill your dreams your Visions your aspirations finishing school getting through a college going through this going through that even something someone was driving a car there's nothing the Lord doesn't want to be active in your life you've heard of absentee fathers the Lord is not wanting to be an absentee father he wants to be there in your life sister told me a story the other day something that happened to her many years ago one of her little children her babies was nursing and she had to go away her husband's a minister and had to go on a missions trip or go overseas while she was gone you know she she just seemed to have all these kind of feelings as mothers do about being away from her baby she got back home and the baby wouldn't nurse and wouldn't nurse and wouldn't nurse and wouldn't latch and wouldn't latch and she just kept fighting and struggling wrestling and said she finally looked down at the baby and said Just Surrender to me and said all at once that maybe just kind of relaxed itself and gave over to the mama and started nursing she said the Lord spoke to her now this may not be exactly the story but the short version of it is that the Lord spoke to her and said that's the way it is with you you're going here going there doing this doing that but I am El Shady eye the breast to God and I would feed you my strength my authority if you would just surrender to me imagine friends every moment you've ever had in your life maybe you are sitting here right now without the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know that's the truth maybe you're sitting here tonight or this morning rather you're sitting here back slit you know that you're not where you need to be the Lord maybe you men you women maybe you married for maybe you playing around with things in the shadows that you know you ought to be fooling with you know you're getting ready to get in trouble with the Lord you can feel things happen and you feel this thing happen to that thing I'm what's what's really the answer surrender maybe you're associating with people that's going to hurt you down the road how do you solve that not getting a big fight put them down tell them get away from you and scream in their face surrender to the Lord surrender yourself to the right thing flee from the things that are wrong and cling to that which is right now for all of you if your head's bound that includes me the pastor the ministers the deacons the trustees young people older people married people single people Grandma's grandpas all of us now with our heads bowed we're like Israel folks at this very moment we've torn our clothes plucked our beard as it were and put ashes on our head and now we're humbling ourselves before the Lord that's what that bowed head represents and I'll take it if God would let me say this right if I be Jesus speaking I'll take it the prophet said that he's such a gentleman that if you put him not in the first place but the 13th down in the basement he said oh he'll take it if that's what you're willing to give him so if your head bowed don't you stop for a moment and think you're not doing anything to get his attention just you bowing your head in this service right now is assembled before him that you are humbling yourself to the voice of God now you know your heart you know your conditions you know what you're facing without specifying without being specific not just making calls for Sinners and backsliders and but for all of us you see what your need and your heart is and where you're at in your walk with God would you just be willing right now to say father I'm just going to put one hand up here and there maybe two if you want to do it that's fine but I'm going to put a hand up here in the air Lord and I'll say you see me and now when I raise this hand up to you that is a universal sign of I surrender to you and I'm taking that thing that you see in my heart and I'm surrendering it friends the Lord Jesus is my judge what I'm getting ready to tell you the moment some of you put your hands in the air I felt his presence rushed with satisfaction I'll meet that at his judgment bar if I'm lying to you I felt a pleasure come out of his presence the moment your hands went up I felt in his Spirit up here on this platform I felt him go ah thank you Lord for letting me sense that from you it's just Vindication Lord of what I was telling you people it don't have to be a screaming Time Around The Altar folks all you got to do is just let him know I'm here Jesus I'm here Lord let's pray together all of us let's take these needs before father you see every hand every life that was presented before you you see the very nature of your people you see the very existences The Bad The Good The Ugly the indifferent the pretty the handsome ever what it may be the rich the poor the weak the strong Lord Jesus your eyes want run true to and fro throughout the Earth and you see all things and I'm praying that the Holy Ghost will make one great sweep across this little audience right here this morning that Lord you will not leave one life untouched undone you will visit the individual home the address as it were because Lord you're still a God that knows where we live in our addresses that you will visit Lord your children right where they're sitting you see their needs Lord many of them may be the Holy Ghost many of them need maybe backslidden many of them

Victor or a conqueror or overcome or whatever what it is Lord it doesn't matter Lord I stretch my hands over this little body right now and I ask that you would take from these little symbols of our surrender to you you take them into your great heart and see them as a as an effort as a nod as it were toward what you're saying to us this morning thank you Father for your people thank you for your children we commit this service and the remainder not at your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I wonder now if there be somebody here that would say brother Ben I just I feel
