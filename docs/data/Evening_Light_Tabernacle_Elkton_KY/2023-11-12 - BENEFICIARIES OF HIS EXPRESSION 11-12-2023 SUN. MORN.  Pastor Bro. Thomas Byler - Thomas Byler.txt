[Music] [Applause] [Music] morning brothers and sisters you'll just stand with me this morning maybe brother Brian will open us in prayer this morning speak amen if you'll go into the Proverbs with me and children can be dismissed for Sunday school we're going to go to Proverbs 15 in Proverbs 15 we'll start at verse one and we're going to read up to verse 16 a soft answer turneth away wrath but Grievous words stir up anger the eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good who despises his father's instruction but he that regardeth Repro is prudent lips of the wise disperse knowledge but the heart of the foolish doeth not so may of the wicked is an Abomination unto the Lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness hell and destruction are before the Lord how much more than the hearts of the children of men merry heart maketh a cheerful continence but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken all the days of The Afflicted are evil but he that is a of a merry heart hath a continual Feast better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters I was just going to go back to this uh fourth verse here you know the scriptures says uh a lot of things but this scripture is really true a wholesome tongue a wholesome tongue to me would be a person that doesn't allow anything to come out of his mouth that can't be reason fre the filter of God's word that you won't speak evil of your brother and sister you won't speak evil of anything you try to hold yourself in in the word of God where you only the things and speak the things of God's word a wholesome tongue is a tray of life and perverseness therein is a breach in spirit and I know some know what this means because you get around them people in the world and there's no such thing as a wholesome tongue anymore they they just they just can't stop talking about evil and evil things I was thinking this morning brother bradam taught in that message the countdown that we're in the rocket age and we I I'm not saying adding to it I'm just saying we've gone from the rocket age to warp speed right now because everything that's going on in the world is just so accelerated it just moves so fast you kind of shake your head sometime the world is falling apart one day in one area then the W world is falling apart somewhere else in another day know it's only been about a month since the uh people decided that attacked the children of Israel and now the world's ready to move on to something else they're tired of that struggle they want another struggle somewhere else and I was just thinking this morning out if you don't have this word of God in your heart and life this morning it's a really deceptive age that we live in I mean it's a really dark age I know I say that a lot but it's the truth it is a Dark Age there is no light out there the only light that we have is through the word of God and the world out there as long as you keep this right here as long as you're experiences the word of God out here and not in your heart and in your life they're they're happy to be around you but the minute you put this in your heart and in your life this morning you the friends you used to have you'll find out that they're not they're not your friends anymore and they just go somewhere else not to say that they don't talk to you but they just think you're crazy anymore and I was thinking if you turn with me um to the sixth chapter of uh Mark I think a lot of it is as human beings we or as people we look at examples we look at other people we look at things and we just can't believe what we see sometimes and I'll just read this and this is something from last week um I'll read these this I'm not going to read this whole chapter it's a long chapter in Mark but I would read these first 10 verses first 11 verses here in Mark and U it really and then I'm going to go to uh second Peter third chapter maybe first John I might jump around a little bit and then I'll start reading here first verse in the sixth chapter of Mark I know I'm like a machine gun I get in a hurry I'll try to slow down and he went out from this and came into his own country and his disciples followed so he was in his own country you know around Nazareth and the places where he grew up and when the Sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue many hearing him were astonished Shing from once haveth this man these things wisdom is this which he's given unto him that even such Mighty works are wrought by his hands so we're starting to see here in his own country that they couldn't see past his flesh they couldn't see past the person they knew as a child that they knew that learned a trade in his father's house they couldn't see past that and he goes on to say is this is in excuse me I'm stuttering him is this not this the carpenter comma so they thought he was just the Carpenter and then the next thing is not the son of Mary the brother of James and J's and of Judah and Simon are not his sisters here with us and they were offended at him you know that knocks the Catholic church right out there they tell you Mary never had any children other than Jesus himself that kind of knocks that theology right out but it goes on to say and Jesus said unto them a prophet is without honor without honor but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house so they couldn't receive what God had for form in the form of a man because they just thought he was a man you know what he was saying was just what a man would tell him not that the very Living God was in his heart and life but now jump over here this is from uh November 5th this is last Sunday it comes comes out of Hebrews uh the fth chapter the verses 14 to 18 and I was thinking you know that's the same thing we're in the world today sometimes we can't you know when a preacher comes to you or an evangelist comes to you or any man of God a lot of times your enemy is going to want to show you the faults of that man or that person and not have you listen to the word that's coming from that man and that's the whole that's that's what it all borrows down to and I'll just read what it says for as much as then as the children this is out of Hebrews the 2 chapter 14 for8 for as much then as the children to are protect Akers of the Flesh and Blood he also himself also likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that have power over to death amen that's where we're at this morning that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage and that's really true this morning if you're if God has taken control of your heart and your life this morning not to say that you don't H or you don't worry about things but there's no more death has no victory over you this morning you're not in bondage to death this morning anymore you have Victory through Jesus Christ and he goes this scripture goes on to say for verily he took not onto him him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it is behooved him that he be made like unto his Brethren so this goes back what I was reading in Mark 6 they couldn't see past the flesh they couldn't see past that even with all the signs and all the Miracles they just couldn't see p the flesh the seed of Abram wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like onto his Brethren that he might be merciful and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in him he himself ha suffered being tempted and is able to scour them that are temped so he he felt what you and I feel he knew our experience he knew what we would face in our life and he had enough love and compassion for us that he is willing to bear that all and go to the Cross this morning so us as Christians he he gave us the victory what do we have to worry about and I was just thinking the age that we're in this morning if you're not careful it is going so fast it'll leave you behind if you don't stay with the Lord and stay with Jesus Christ this morning morning if you don't stay in the spirit of Christ this age will take or just go right by you'll be left standing on the road and it'll just go right by you this morning this is what brother brandom had to say about it this morning and it's no different whether it's brother branam or it was Luke or Mark or any of these famous swindale I'm not swindale I mean all the F famous preachers of the 1800s Campbell and all these other people people sometimes couldn't see past the man that there I'll just read what it says Jesus was completely totally man he would cry like a man he would eat like a man he could become like a man he was completely totally a man in his physical beings and in his Spirit he was completely totally God so he made his flesh submissive to the spirit that was in him that's we're no different we're no better ourselves you have to make your flesh come into submission to the word of God we're no better ourselves you see he was tempted in all manners like we are he was a man not an angel he was a man he had desires and temptations like we do the Bible said he did he was a man not an angel above Temptations and then we go back to what I read in Hebrews Hebrews said he was made lower than the angels He was a man completely a man and God took a complete man to bring total Deliverance that he filled him with the whole his Spirit the holy ghost that was in him without measure and he was tempted like we were but we're a little bit different now that everything that he was God poured into his church this morning and it's through that that we have the hope this morning whatever that need is that you have this morning I hope I didn't lose my place here uh he was completely God he approved he raised the Dead when he stopped nature The Roaring Seas the mighty winds when he spoke to the trees and so forth they obeyed him and he was God inside and he could be that he could be man for he was man and he was totally completely delivered himself as a man into the hands of God for the service of God he is our example and I can't change that is totally true this morning Christ is your example this morning everything you need as a human being this morning is in the word of God and in Jesus Christ this morning anyone tells you anything different they're lying to you and or also Christians that he's our example um rereading he was totally man he's totally God but he surrenders his natural parts to his physical parts his own thinking his own doing his own cares and I only and he said I do only which pleases the father we're no different ourselves you got to surrender your thoughts your mind your body and everything to the word of God here said Rabbi so so they tried to bribe him into the affiliations and denominations but he was totally deriv because he trusted in God did not the psalmist say they will deliver him he was completely trusted in me and I will deliver my darling from the dogs because he trusted me so somehow when when we come to the end of this life's journey I want it for mine I know I want it for yours I want him to say I deliver him from the grave on the res Resurrection morning totally deliver him both soul body and spirit because he trusted me I'm just gonna jump over here and in uh I won't take a lot of time but over in um I was thinking sometimes when God sends people to us sometimes sometimes we we see the person more than we see the god in the person sometimes and there's only 18 verses here I'll finish with this is The Second Epistle of of Peter but Peter talks about other people in his I'll just read it and let it speak for itself and this is what Peter said this is The Second Epistle beloved now I write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by the way of remembrance and that even goes back to that scripture that we read in Proverbs that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of The Commandments of us the Apostles of the Lord Savior and any real man of God will always bring you back to the word of God not his own ideas not his own opinions but everything brings you back to the word of God knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming that's where we're at this morning everyone's falling away because they don't see the promise of his coming and he goes I lost my place there uh for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation for this they willingly are ignorant of by the word of God that the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water so he's he's saying it it keeps happening age after age after age they just refuse to hear the word of God and things happen to him judgment comes to him whereby the world that was them was being overflowed with water and purst it goes right back to the Genesis 6th chapter it it just keeps happening time and time again but you we're out of that cycle we don't keep going in that cycle of death anymore that the world is in you're outside of that cycle right now through Jesus Christ this morning beloved be not ignorant of this one thing I I miss the scripture there but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved on the Fire against the day of judgment and predition unto ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing as a the Lord is not sck concerning his promises some men count slackness but his longsuffering to us W not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance that's where we're at this morning There's Hope for any of us this morning if you put it in Jesus Christ but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heaven shall pass away with great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and The Works therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of person ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness again that goes back to what we were reading in Proverbs this morning looking for the hastening and onto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for the new heavens and the new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness I believe that's why everyone's here this morning you're looking for that day and he goes on to say nevertheless according to the promise or I already excuse me wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found in him in peace and without spot blamus and that's why you're here this morning that through the word of God that you can be purified this morning and the that long suffering of the Lord is salvation even and this is what I was thinking about this morning this scripture it goes back to when we look at people bringing the word of God to us sometimes you got to look past the person and if that message actually hits your heart and hits your life don't see the person but see the spirit of Christ delivering that word to you whether it was brother brandham whether it was Paul whether it was Peter James John any any minister of God if they have the truth of God and something they say touches your heart and life don't look at the man but look at the word of it should bring bring you right back to the word of God this morning and make you want to change and count this long suff from the Lord I miss that uh I'm sorry if I keep rereading the account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to wisdom G given to him hath written unto you so Peter's pointing back to Paul in all his Epistles and he goes on to say also in all his Epistles speaking in them of the things which which some things are hard to be understood so even in Peter's Day some of the things Paul was writing was hard for even him to understand understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction and I'll just finish these last two verses here ye therefore beloved see you know all these things before be and we're no different ourselves we have the word of God for our hour We're no different than Peter's age was yes he s before beware least you also being led away with eror of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness now that's what God's looking for this morning is steadfast Christians but grow in Grace in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and to him be glory both now and forever Amen Brother David

things that he had done and she said God Is A Healer she said I'm a doctor but she said I know that if God don't do it it ain't going to get done and I thought you know that was encouraging to me that my doctor would encourage me to believe in the Lord there I went trying to be to confess what I believe but then she encouraged me to even believe more you know we serve an awesome God and and I said

so praise the Lord God is good amen no choice like the choice of serving him amen this morning we just want to Amen to title this beneficiaries of his expression or attributes beneficiaries of his expression or attributes amen and so I was going to uh I was originally going to title it praising him for who he is praising him for who he is amen and I'll tell you what I'll tell you one thing a month straight every day speaking of this wouldn't be long enough amen amen and we've spoken on it before but this is just what the Lord laid on my heart so I trust that it'll be for somebody out there amen so if you will turn to Colossians we'll begin with the book of Colossians the first chapter CH Colossians 1 as we begin to look at this amen I can't think of any other announcements so amen praise the Lord Colossians 1 and we'll begin with verse 13 WHO hath delivered us from the power of Darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son am me I'm going to move this down a little bit in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the IM image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature remember he's talking about Jesus amen he was the very image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether there be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen praise the Lord that's the first one and I want to go to First John not first John but St John let's go to St John if you will St John 1 St John 1 and 1 through3 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God Amen now remember the Word was God Amen and it was With God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made you know I had to think about this and you know how that the devil Satan he can't create anything there he can't make a boat all right he can't create anything if anything was ever made it was God that made it amen praise the Lord now turn with me over to Revelations 4 I have a couple more just to kind of lay a foundation if that's all right Revelations 4 amen I like that song Brother David saying let the Saints arise Amen Let Them worship Amen Let the worshipper arise is't that right I believe that we're living in an hour amen when God 's people especially are going to recognize amen the greatness of the god that we serve amen how great he really is amen and that he is worthy of Praise amen more so than what we can imagine but I hope that by God's grace and help just to convey to you this morning a little bit by God's help amen the praise and the honor that he's worthy of because if if you'll notice here in chapter 4 in verse 10 amen it talks about the let's go back to verse n and when those beasts give honor and glory and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the 4 and 20 Elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped amen it's a time of worship a time of Praise amen worship him that liveth forever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for th pleasure they are and were created amen you want another one let's do one more shall we just one of many amen another one is in Revelations 5 and beginning with verse 11 and I beheld now notice how this was after amen he was uh under fifth chapter one sat on the throne so forth amen and nobody was worthy to take the book is't that right to loosen the seals thereof amen but the line of the tribe of Judah had prevailed and so forth on down and at the end of all this we find in verse amen 10 it says and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall rain on Earth and I beheld and a I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders is that something how I talked about the elders and so forth over on this other chapter now it talks about the angels is't that right round about the throne and the Beast Sandy elders and the number of them was 10,000s times 10 thousands and thousands of thousands W how many believe there going to be some folks Over Yonder there going to be some people praising God Over Yonder but I ain't going to wait till I get over there are you we might as well start it now why because well who he is we ain't got a whole lot to brag about who we are because we were so low down and mean we had to die to oursel to ever Mount anything is't that right all right thousands of thousands sing with a loud voice oh I like that we got to be a little loud this morning is that okay not quiet he I guess he's worthy huh no no he said with a loud voice Worthy is a lamb that was slain Amen to receive power and riches and man is is all the stuff that we always want we want power we want riches we want wisdom we want strength is't that right but it says he's worthy of all these things because when you get to be an old man and your strength begin to fail you realize that any kind of strength and power that you have is power and strength that God gave to you in the first place amen all right so he says that's right to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing that's what he's worthy of and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as our and to seea all that were all that are in them heard me S or I sing blessing John even got into it John be to say blessing and honor and glory and power how many know John's a type of the Bride so if that type of the Bride shouldn't be we be saying that blessing honor glory power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the for be said so be it amen and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever God bless the reading of the word you can be seated amen first we want to start with saying that we realize through the prophet of God and that uh he brought to us the understanding that way back in Genesis 1 and I believe it was 126 when he God expressed himself as Lord God that he expressed him himself from the Greek speaking about being Elohim which means the self-existing one he was the self-existing one and God means in the English language it means a uh object of worship to have any kind of a God or whatever it means object of worship so God wasn't even God at one time because you have to be an object of worship and there was nobody to worship there was no angels He was all by himself this is where our find finite Minds can't comprehend amen God you know you don't start asking yourself questions like well how long was it before God ever made the first star don't even go there it a little blow your mind we don't know how long it was you know in our minds everything has a beginning everything has to start somewhere you know but God never never never did stop I'm just so glad that he came and proved himself alive today and that he's real the problem with people in their lives is that they don't have the reality that Jesus is real that God is real amen I'm glad to know that he's real my God is real he's real in my soul amen for he has washed that he's made me whole I'm not the man I used to be you're not the woman that you used to be amen God is coming he does something I want you to know that this whole thing is about God he is the alpha he's Omega he's the beginning of the he's the entire alphabet he's the beginning he's the end he wrote the end in Revelations he wrote about the thousand year reign the new heavens and the new Earth he's everything Bible talks about he is all and he is it all and it's all for him when you begin to think about him and what he is and who he is we realiz said amen in him in him in the self-existing one that he had attributes that he had something that he wanted to express himself just kind of like a person that's filled with the Holy Ghost and you want to tell people about the gospel you want to give them the good news but people don't want to hear the good news I believe it if Isaiah said something about it's like a fire shut up in my bones how many believe that's the way it ought to be Christianity isn't just a big old wet rag amen the sour amen Sad and Blue Nights of fire that shut up in your bones and you got to somehow try to express it I get the honor and the privilege of expressing myself when I come up here when I live and whatever I do am but this be gamous say oh how greater God is Express and God wanted to express himself he had attributes in him what to be a lord in him was to be a father that father was shut up on the inside of him Amen to be a son to be the Holy Ghost to be the pillar of fire to be a redeemer to be a savior to be a deliverer he wanted to do all these things when he comes right down to it brothers and sisters we realize that the victory that is in your life it ain't your Victory it is the victory that he had in him and he expresses it to you and through you when you overcome that's he overcoming when brother Phil Wednesday when he was here and he was talking about it he said man you know don't be don't put Jesus over on the co-pilot he's not the pilot get out of the driver's seat sit over there let him do the driving he's the one that made you can the for thing form say to him that formed why Thou made me thus in Romans 7 no don't tell him say Well why have you made me this I'm glad he made you are you glad he made you amen that's him expressing God wanted to express and we are now at Easter many times we'll take messages preach on the Ben being beneficiaries of the Resurrection is that right tonight this morning for a little while we're going to just begin to talk about being beneficiaries of his attributes or of his expression on why because there's millions of people that have have not partaken that are not benefits that are not benefits of what he is amen but to be a part of what he is first of all oh my and like I said it could go a long ways because amen if you have the Holy Ghost there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's own life that right according as he has chosen Us in him before the found of the world you have to be a seed Gene you have to be an expression of the almighty God to be a Son of God if he he has called you he wrote the Bible says you know all whose names were not written in the Lamb of books a lamb Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be deceived before it oh boy this is a big word for most people but before it ever started God already knew how it would end he knew what everybody's choice would be he put Humanity on free moral agency I was thinking on the Church on the way to church here how simple it really is the accountability that got has put Humanity upon amen what's 2 million time 3 million what's 3 million time 2 million 6 million time 3 * 2 2 * 3 6 million right or if you say 3 million plus two billion simple right what let's go big let's go one trillion time 20 trillion is 20 right but God Gave You reasoning he gave you understanding and guess what for that understanding he hold you accountable he made it to where you can judge what is right and what is wrong and he holds you accountable for [Applause] that put them on free moral agency amen all right well I don't want to go down that road too far but let's just look at him amen for just a minute oh my how we could think about all the different things but different you know how manyan knows the god or the Lord or the father of the Old Testament I mean knows he's the father he's the father he's the Creator he's dead I'm glad when he made the family unit how many knows it's one of the greatest things that we can have as a family a husband and a wife that was something that was down on the inside of him to be a father or to be even a husband the word husband he is our husband amen he is our father he is our friend he is our savior listen he is so much all and in all until even the trees represent him cuz he is the tree of life even the rivers represent the river that flows and the River of Life even food that you eat expresses what he is he is all and in all it all points to him he's everything he's everything to me when you begin to say Lord Jesus I want every one of your benefits because there's a lot of people don't have the benefits of knowing him as Savior savior that's what he wanted to be he wanted to save somebody he's got a strong arm he can rescue you he can deliver you amen amen Oh Oh My Oh What A Savior ain't that right it's supp to be awesome to think that we're a deep myy pit that you were in Lost and undone without God or his son he reach way down gotta reach down and picked you up he saved your soul and now you're a beneficiary of him being a savior thank God for that I'm glad I'm just excited about being a benefit of who he is Oh What A Savior wonderful glorious amen I think he was reach way down he's worth everything when you realize what he is you realize he's worthy of the praise he's worthy of honor and he's worthy of Glory I thinking back there you know all these champions of fighting and different things and oh how they become uh I guess the latest fighter was Mike Tyson and how bad he was supposed to be then you got these dead debt weightlifters great big Giants pick up nine 00 lb or something you know we go wow but we never go wow to the guy that made the guy we never say yeah that's what I thought God can make big strong people that's God how many know he God is worthy of all glory you know it's kind of nice isn't it once in a while to hear some of these Sports athletes and so forth you know to actually could God to actually credit God it's amazing and people don't like that do they others don't like when you credit God they don't realize they wouldn't have nothing do you realize you wouldn't have nothing you'd be nothing without him cuz anything that was ever made he made it he made my tongue he made my mind he made my heart he made my Fe and I'm going to serve him brother I'm going to glorify him with I'm going to press him with it not the devil El get t tent and serve the devil with it all these musicians out there country rock whatever it is they put a talent there it was supposed to serve god with it but they used to serve it the devil with it oh my oh I mean know you can't get too loud for God you look over there in Revelations you find people get awful noisy it gets so noisy it sounds like thunder I wish this place would sound like thunder R just Rumble with the Praises of God why cuz he's worthy there anybody worthy of it it's him that's worthy of praise that's right give him a good hand cluff we give him a little handcuff I says praise you with the praise him all the L praise him any way that you can possibly take God he's one to be praised cuz he is everything he is your all without him you don't breath you don't breathe without him you don't live without him you

he is let's praise him for who he is amen you would have no strength if it wasn't for him that you would never get better if it wasn't for him sister Janette she would never quit coughing if it wasn't for him so let me ask you is it better yeah it's better praise God folks we'd all be laying in the cast somewhere if it wasn't for almighty God God does all our healing I heal all your diseases that's who I am it's who I am Hallelujah oh my we could just take glory and receive the honor of receiving what he is you wouldn't have to worry so much about what you are so much so that even like brother Phil was talking Paul said the life that I now live not yet not I but it's Christ that lives in me how many know even very life is not you it's supposed to be the Holy Ghost that's in you living his life remember that in all things he is the head of everything so that everything he can have the prence us cuz he made this ship he knows how to sell this ship he made this car he knows how to drive this car he made you a creature of worship he knows how to worship that ain't Thomas B that's the Holy Ghost hello when it's all said and done folks they all fall down and say he's worthy when it's all said and done folks we say he's worthy of honor and power and strength and wisdom any kind of smarts you have it's him oh aren't we glad for him he's worthy of all praise honor glory amen I don't know just how to express it but I'll tell you this this is here is God expressed in letter form is that right and this word before it was a word was a thought come on this is God's thought put on paper come on Amen let me tell you something this is the beginning and this is yeah the end yeah me it's everything it's every age SM Church age pergamus age TI Church age Le see a church age and even behold I'll sent you Elijah the prophet before a great grateful day of the Lord and he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the father he'll make us like Paul preach what Paul preach baptized the way Paul baptized the Holy Ghost the way holy the Paul said by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body not a handshake not joining a church but You' got to be baptized with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be a part of this body back to the original he said he would he did Martin Luther was an expression Paul was an expression all of them was an expression what he had already wrote amen folks you if you're a Christian you're an expression of him how many believe that that's right you are an expression listen the only way that you can be a son and daughter of God is because and you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life man that is God Amen oh my listen the gene of your life the spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule just as you was in your great great great great grandfather long before you ever got here that's why you've got to be in God way back there and then as time goes on he says only come down he says you're sitting here in church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation to this people to this neighborhood where are you associate how many pleas are every one of us is called to be an expression of God in our neighborhood to our families and our friends to express God that's what we're ordained to do Jesus was the light of the world and Jesus says ye are the light of the world how many believe that the believer is the light of the world we can die to ourselves and let his thinking come in let his Spirit come in and drive us and push it mean then we can be a light to the world no other way amen praise the Lord oh my I don't care if there's a shepherd He said he was a chief Shepherd how many you glad for that he's our heavenly father how many knows that in Matthew there he talks about you know foxes have holes and so forth and and the birds he says Heavenly Father cares for the birds not one Falls and not one hair of your per not your head will perish but what God resered why you worry about this why you don't you know your heavenly cares Heavenly Father cared aren't you glad to have a father I'm thankful that he to me he have I have a been beneficiary of his fatherhood think about all those out there the Pharisees they didn't want him as their father is that right Jesus says you're of your father but it's you got a different Paddy you're of your father the devil millions of people have not that same comfort that you have have somebody watching over you protecting you amen who knows but what brother Josh and sister Leah who knows but what that car was coming perhap at a great speed of great speed perhaps it might not have been but it could have been and and just before it got there there was something that shook him up woke woke him up amen and they because common just tapped them pretty good and give him a little tap huh cuz how many know it could have been a complete different story if it was real bad qu lash broken neck whatever it is but we have a heavly father that cares about us that watches over us on the daily basis just like a good dad cares about every issue of that home about the wife about the children he takes care of every bit that's the kind of Dad we have that's the benefit that we have of having the heavenly father aren't you glad for that I want you to know I've got the greatest adad in the world I'm glad to have the greatest adad there is he had these attributes of being a savior about Redeemer now notice I were thinking about savior well to save something is to bring something back that's lost isn't that right and it's also brings in the word Redemption he is Our Redeemer that has redeemed us you have brought us back we were in The Lost condition we're out in the world and sin but it's not where we are not who we are and when you come and you called us my sheep hear my voice and the stranger voice they will not follow all that the father have given me will come to me aren't you bad for that he's Our Redeemer to bring us back into the fall to save us like if we was in the wilderness somewhere and they put out a search party look for you huh can't find you for days you B lost about ready to perish and somebody comes up to you hey Thomas where are you over [Applause] here over here boy you know how glad I would be after about time just to hear somebody else's voice talking to me I I'm here I'm here I would go I would I wouldn't be like Oh I'm over here I'm over I'd let them know they hear me right I'm here I give it all I got come and get me out of here I don't ever want to come back in this place again that's where we are as children of God when God save you from sin I don't ever want to go back into that again I'm happy to be saved he's our savior beneficiaries of him being a savior oh yes oh my when I think about this I can't even barely drink for having to tell you but when you think about when you get old perhaps you got to B go by the way of the grave but I want you to know we're beneficiaries of his resurrection just as we have been beneficiaries since saving us we ain't got a thing to worry about he's going to bring our he's going to bring us back again when my savior calls I'll answer I'll be somewhere listening for my name we're beneficiaries cuz what was it Mary said you know we know that said we know he'll raous come forth in the resurrection yeah we know he says look at me you're looking at the resurrection you're looking at it I am the resurrection and the life amen how many is glad you already are potentially resurrected when you get this baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life you become Born Again by the holy spirit amen praise God God is good isn't he that's right we are expressing almighty God to this world he says not if we are those attributes if we are those attributes he says then we can't live by Creeds we can't live by denominations we've got to live by the word the ages of denominations and different ideas and everybody doing their own thing those days are over how many knows that now it's man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedes out of the mouth of God shall Man live by and if anybody add one word to this or takes one word away his part will be taken out of the Book of Life praise be to God oh when I think about him as a deliverer or Overcomer to him that overcometh like go Ahad desend with me in my thr God was so powerful you know there something how did the devil he don't even stand a chance against God does he and God come down in some know it nothing a bunch of people that are nothing like David the least in the family least little you know but his daddy said man you know we got one more but he ain't much of a kid you know we can't get a word in sideways or he don't never talk unless he's talking about God or you know what how great God is this that of the other well bring him here and man and got take David David will go out there he slay Giants but I want you to understand that it wasn't David that slew to John it was God that slew to John God gets the glory god gets the credit Samson the same way it was God that made him up give him the power to do it it's God that gives you strength it's God that gives you power to overcome the enemy it's God that does it wo to anybody that begins to teach gift of God even preaching oh look how great preacher I am I woe to anybody that takes the credit for it it ain't me it's God Amen he gets all the glory David gave God all the glory I don't come to you with a sword and a shield I don't come to you in my own power how many beli that that's how we approach other that's how we Face the devil I don't come to you because I can but I want you to know that I know somebody that can and he will do it more than we're more than when he's there doing it oh my he's everything he's everything to me he's my father he's my mother he's my brother I mean those he created Brotherhood Isn't it nice to have somebody that you love and that's a real brother a real friend he created friendship he is friendship he is Brotherhood he is father father he is Mother he is brother what a friend we have in Jesus what a friend he's a pharah up 10,000 aren't you glad but GL you may not have a friend in the world but if you've got him you've got all the friend you [Music] need Lord sometimes we as friends let each other down we hurt each other we do this that or the other but he'll never let you down amen never you'll let him down but he won't let you down how many glad to have him as your friend as a deliverer amen as a conqueror but Abram compared Napoleon to Jesus a little bit because Napoleon I think at the age of 33 had conquered most of the known world he was a mighty conqueror feared is that right but he met his waterl he met his defeat isn't that right he met his feet and ended up going down as he drunk and dying as he drunk the brother talks about how that Jesus that 33 he had conquered every devil oh he conquered him in Matthew 5 I believe it is amen when he was up on the mountain he conquered sickness he conquered epilepsy oh an epileptic child that even the disciples could not cast out when he came folks I'm here to tell you if Jesus couldn't have cast him out we'd have had a problem if there had been one devil that the devil got that Jesus couldn't overcome we' had a problem but there was nothing that he couldn't not a one that he did couldn't overcome Oh my he fought that great battle all the way up the calvary he me stretched his arms and maybe the devil thought that he had it but that was his biggest victory of all because with that blood that came out he bought you and me he purchased everything back it was his mighty Victory he was dead until the Stars said he was dead the moon said he dead the sun refused to shine all said he was dead and he went down to the hell Ain that right he went down to Hell oh I like the way the prophet put it he went down into hell come up to the G said who is it it's Jesus Jesus oh my goodness I thought I had you when I killed Lael I thought I had you when I killed Isaiah thought I had you in him man I thought I couldn't believe that that was you Calvary but here you are open up huh he opens up grabs the devil throws him up against the wall grabs the keys off of his side turns him around gives him a good Ki get back in that close as it door he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave he come and give us the keys give us the victory over the devil rose triop on the third day and now he's resurrected and you're resurrected you're raised with him after you've been buried with him that's what the water baptisms about showing that you're dead now and may you rise in goodness of Life the old man is dead we got to bury we got some stinking people in here this morning that need to go to the Grave need to die they need to be buried when they come forth folks they come in New his life

wherever the baptism wherever the Holy Ghost is is Christ and wherever he is there's Grace there's salvation there's forgiveness there's Redemption that's reconciliation there's joy there's peace there's forgiveness that's everything that's what a church is supposed to hold when we come together and bring God's presence it's here how many beli this morning you have one sin that needs forgiven say God I'm here I need forgiveness Lord I need more joy Lord give me more joy give me more peace give me more strength Lord whatever it is it's in Him Glory and Honor are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place give unto the Lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the Lord glory and strength give un the Lord the glory do unto wow we're gonna be busy people aren't we if we give God the glory that du to his name we're gonna be busy giveing praise and glory in the way that we live the way that we conduct ourselves the way that we dress the way that we do our hair the way that we do our mouth the way we do our eyes the way whatever ever it is about us we want it to reflect him how many believe that doesn't matter what we do okay praise the Lord I'm working up a sweat I'll cool off in a minute amen praise the Lord do to his name bring an offering oh my come before him make a little sacrifice huh how many believe we need to Little B make a little more sacrifice people can't even make a sacrifice of their time to come to the house of God sometimes where's the glory where's the honor giving to God Amen I believe not Isaiah but Malachi says you know if I be a father where is my honor if I be a lord where is my my my fear amen amen all right bring an offering come before him that's what we're here for Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness amen fear before him all the Earth the world also shall be stable and it shall not be moved let the heavens be glad and let the Earth rejoice and let man say among the Nations the Lord reth Psalms 148 says it this way praise ye the Lord Praise ye the Lord from the heavens Praise Him in the highight praise him all his angels praise him all ye hosts oh when I come to this message I says man the more God blesses the more God gives the more God expresses the more it ought to turn into praise how many believe that even in sorrow even in the bad things that God allows you to happen in your life you should still praise him I believe that amen Praise Him Praise Him son Praise Him Moon praise him all ye stars of light Praise Him ye heavens of Heavens ye Waters that be above the heavens let them praise the name of the Lord for he commanded and they were created you want a reason to praise him there it is he made you that's good enough right I'm glad I don't know about you but I'm glad to be here are you glad to be here are you glad to be alive well then praise him say thank you Lord we're glad that we're alive Lord that you've given us eternal life that's Reon up he creat praise the Lord oh my praise the Lord let them praise the name of the Lord for he commanded and they were created he had also established them forever and ever he had made a decree which shall not pass praise the Lord from the earth ye dragons and all ye deeps fire hail smoke Vapor stormy wind fulfilling his words mountains and hills and fruitful trees all Cedars beasts and all cattle nah that's right let me hear it again praise the Lord go out there hear them cows move pray with that's all praise the lord it's God that give him that [Applause] voice amen he gave the dog let the dogs praise the Lord let everything that has breath Bible says praise the Lord that everything that has breath praise the Lord y'all are alive that's nice praise the Lord praise be to God praise be to God okay creeping thing flying foul Kings of the Earth all people princes all judges of the earth both young men and maidens and old men and children let them praise the name of the Lord for his name alone is excellent his glory is above the earth and the heavens amen think about it sister I mean all of the wonders of the Earth Earth how great and how wonderful it is but his glory is greater than all of that the fact that he made all of it makes him greater than all of it and I I forget that new constellation they looked in that scope in between a few Stars he was saying he says just lately I guess 19 maybe in 2016 somewhere in there they begin to look between these Stars they seem kind of a area they begin to investigated between the stars and they look way up in there and they said there's galaxy out there not just one more star but beyond that was galaxies and things and it showed pictures of [Music] it unfathomable how great our God is but his glory of who he is and he has come and he lives your heart and my heart who in the world would not want to be a Christian who in the world wouldn't want to go like Jesus says go you into all the world World baptizing them amen for the remissions of sin who would be ashamed to take his name amen and be baptized not me I don't care if he stands me to stand on my head Brother Brad we're gonna stand on my head whatever God asked me to do will do you love him let them praise the name of the Lord for his name alone is excellent his glory is above the heavens and the Earth amen now we're going to get into a baptis be okay we'll change the order of service and take some baptismal uh scriptures amen as we amen are so grateful to once again see people come uh into the Lord and I will say this with brother Glenn amen there's four of them so maybe it'll be one of them we we got a four four times chance of that being the last one everybody right with God you got it Time Lord Jesus forgive me of all my sins Lord Jesus I want to make sure if that's the last one make sure all all is right I want to be ready to go we understand that when that last one comes in it's it not one more soul will be sack not a one he came to redeem all those names that were written on the book when those names are redeemed he comes to reclaim his own praise the Lord you love the Lord Jesus Matthew 28:18 it says and Jesus came and spake unto them wait a minute I'm ahead of myself let's go back a little bit let's talk about about two scriptures I want to talk about in John 14 this has to do a little bit it is definitely colge baptism but it's just a little bit different note St John 14 verse one let not your heart be troubled believe you believe in God God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also much could be said about Revelations and God will be with them wipe away all their tears from their eyes and he shall be their God and they shall be his son a't that right and whether not notice if I go I'll go prepare a place and I'll come back and get you again whether I and whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether th goest how can we know the way isn't that something that Jesus would bring this up do you not reckon that he probably knew what Thomas was going to ask he wanted to get something across to us and Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen Isn't it nice to know that Christianity in Christ is the only way to happen you can't get up you can't go you can't get there any other way I watched on YouTube somebody asking well what about all of these different religions the mention of all are you saying that they're not going to be saved he says that's exactly right he says cuz Jesus says I am the way no man comes unto the father but by me if his Bible true they're all false and it was a it was a sticky point because they meant to put him on Under Pressure are you saying that he was like yeah I'm saying that I am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me nobody else died Jesus the one that died there's no remissions of sins in any other name but in Jesus name don't oh my in St John now notice this is again talking about who he is right he is the way he is the truth he is the life amen in John 101 says verily verily I say unto you he that enter not in by the door unto the Sheep fall but climbthestacks verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep he's you don't get into the Sheepfold any other way but through Jesus Christ amen amen and I won't get into the Good Shepherd there he talks about uh the being the Shepherd that Jesus Christ with the great Shepherd now we go to Matthew Matthew 28 then the 11 28 and we'll begin with verse 16 then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted and Jesus spake and said unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth amen all power amen go ye therefore and teach all All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost amen teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and L I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world Amen now we all know that there was never one person ever in the whole Bible will you ever find a person being baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost not one amen but in Luke let's go to Luke next chapter is Luke the end of Luke and verse 45 then opened he their understanding uhoh had to have a little open of opening of their understanding that they might understand the scriptures verse 45 and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remissions of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem amen but and you are witness of these things but T ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so he told them to go to Jerusalem didn't he to go to Jerusalem and wait until they are endued with power from on high amen now over in the book of Acts I have one in Acts let me see now they were in Jerusalem of course this is Acts 2 and after they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they went out there and Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and he told them how that uh you know he said men and Brethren let me freely speak of you of the patriarch David and he basically preached the whole sermon down into verse 34 for David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit down on my right hand until I make thy enemies thy foot stol therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God ha made Jes this same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ amen now how many knows the Lord I Am Lord there is no other God in the Old Testament he says I Am Lord there is no other God besides me now Jesus is this lord of the Old Testament Jehovah of the Old Testament come down into Jesus he says I have I been with you Thomas and Philip have I been with you so long and you still don't know me you still want to see the father it is the father that doth the I and my father are what the father dwell on the inside which was the spirit a't that right that's right amen now where we at he made him both Lord and Christ which Christ represents the Holy Ghost so he's got the father or Lord and he's the son which is Jesus right father son and the Christ or the Holy Ghost he says the names of the father no he said name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost which is Lord Jesus I'm a father not my name I'm a son not my name I have the Holy Ghost not his name the Holy Ghost name is Christ amen so he was asking for the it's something how that the Catholics in the 300 what was it around 300 ad I believe it was even they confessed that they used to baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and then they turned it and converted went back to the titles rather than a name and out of those titles they get a trinity that's where the three different gods comes from three gods and there anytime you have three Gods you're a heathen it's Heathen isn't to believe in any than one God there's one Lord One Faith one baptism only one God and that God is the Lord Jesus Christ all power is given to him amen all right now then when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do how many remembers Peter was given the keys to the kingdom then said Peter unto them repent repentance of sins and remissions of sins should be preached in his name beginning at Jerusalem right here we are in Jerusalem and he's doing exactly what Jesus told him to do there's a lot of people say well i' rather take what Jesus did than Peter did no Peter did exactly what Jesus said to do and if you do what Jesus said as far as just taking the titles you're not doing what Jesus said you're actually not doing what Jesus said because he said use the name but he put it in such a way isn't that something called a great doctrine that came out of it into false ranks amen what shall we do men and brethren Peter said unto them repent every and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is to you there's people that believe that the Holy Ghost was only for the apostles only for the 12 or this that or the other no they got it in the max 10 they got it you know 3,000 on the day of Pentecost and and all the way over in Acts 19 amen there was those that were following uh you know John the Baptist and they had to get Reb baptized let me tell you something if you ain't never been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if by immersion you wasn't baptized right you need only one way there's only one true baptism this is right here nobody ever was baptized in titles always in the name I can take you to many places where he did amen for Mission and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I like that for the promises to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord are call the last as one to come in if God's going to do any more calling your promis the baptism of the Holy Ghost which I believe they have I believe they have the Holy Ghost already amen even the house of Cornelius the Holy Ghost fell upon them is that right and then Peter commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus after they got the baptism the Holy Ghost don't put God In The Box he can give you be a baptism before after whatever it's when you truly believe is when the baptism is and how many knows that this is just an outward showing this doesn't baptize you with the Holy Ghost it just makes you amen a candidate for God to give you the Holy Ghost but it'll be based upon your faith there's many of people go down in this water come up and never get the baptism of the Holy Ghost folks it's your faith in God that God honors and gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost but this is an outward showing amen because water don't save you the blood saves you amen the Holy Ghost saves you praise the Lord one more oh we're getting running late is that okay little little extra for the Lord would be all right right amen acts 4 and verse 7 and when they sat them in the midst and asked Deering them by what power or by what name have you done this amen when they laid hands on him you know and healed that man then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto him ye rulers of the people of Elders and and Elders of Israel if we be be this day examined for the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he was made whole be known unto you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you have crucified whom God has raised from the dead even by him that this man stand before you here before you whole this is the stone which was set at not of you Builders which has become the head of the corner and neither is their salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved amen God bless you amen let's just have a word of prayer stand with me this morning Lord Jesus
