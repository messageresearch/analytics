========================================

trouble and anguish have taken hold on me yet thy Commandments are my Delights the righteousness of thy testimonies is Everlasting give me understanding and I shall live God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters God is good all the time right Janette knows but you know our enemy can be funny sometimes she knows what's going on in my heart and life right now I had an old customer decideed to call me this morning you know how the dev devil is sometimes he brings up the past when when they do so youall have to forgive me if I seem like I'm thinking about something else while I'm up here this morning but if you would turn with me to um the 14th chapter of Matthew I was thinking this morning with all that's going on in the world I'm not going to read all of this this is where Herod had executed John the Baptist but I was going to read at the end of these scriptures here this morning you know the only thing I can say this morning there's an allc and I watching us this morning no matter what people do to you no matter what they say to you or how they treat you five years ago six years ago 7 years ago we don't have a right as Christians to strike back at people because they didn't do us right so your enemy is watching you in any situation to see how you're going to react and how you're going to respond doesn't mean that you're makes the back of your mind rest I'll be honest that your mind doesn't rest in the back but as a Christian you've got to be able to project love and understanding even though they won't love and understand you but I don't know where I'm going with that but that's good um I was thinking here when I start at about the 11th verse here this morning no not the 11th that's not important and the 12th verse of the uh 14th chapter of Matthew here uh 13th verse I'm jumping around sorry when Jesus heard of it he departed hence excuse me I'll start at 12 and the disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told Jesus so they went and told Jesus that John the Baptist had been executed and when Jesus heard of it he departed an by ship into a desert bra apart and when the people that heard thereof they followed him on foot and out of the Cities but I was just thinking if you go to the other gospels Jesus brought the 12 discip brought his disciples off the scene after he heard of what happened to John John the Baptist and they had a private time together and I was thinking this morning in our life and in this world we live right now there's Great Tribulation going on out there in the world and the only way you're going to be able to over overcome in the hour that we live in is that you have to take that time in your heart and life each day and dedicate yourself that the only voice that you're going to listen to is the scriptures for the hour and the and the spirit of Christ as he leads and guides you because the world is ready to to fall apart it's ready to start shooting nuclear missiles I never thought 40 years ago you know 20 years ago we'd be where we're at today but we have a we have a prophetic voice for the hour saying that'd come a time where we'd be at this state where we're at this morning and it it requires us as Christians this morning to be quiet and take that time that the word of God ministers and let me just read here this morning uh and Jesus went for and saw the multitude was moved compassion toward them and he and he healed their sick and when and when the evening time disciples came saying that when this desert place and the time is now passed and the multiple away they may go on the village and buy themselves Victors so we know already what Jesus was going to do this morning and I'll just read a few more scriptures here but Jesus said unto them they need not depart give you them to eat and he already knew that they didn't have the money or the they had the substance to supply the needs of the people and they he said onto them we have here but Five Loaves and two fishes and he said to them bring them hither to me me and he commanded the multitude to sit down in the grass and took Five Loaves and two fishes looking up to heaven he blessed and break and gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitudes and they did eat and were filled and they took up the fragments remain 12 baskets full and we know that he fed the 5,000 but what I was thinking this morning here is God is more than able in this age that we live in this morning to take care of your needs to watch over to provide for you to heal you whatever your need is this morning you know whatever I'm feeling as a human being whatever your feeling God is more than able if he could feed 5,000 he can heal and feed you this morning no matter what the situation is but I'm I wanted to jump over to Hebrews the 12th chapter I don't I I'm not going to say something I know I say it all the time but we're truly a needy people this morning as the as I see the days progressing in the world you there's no hope like I said I said it last week I keep saying it every there's no hope out there in the world your only hope is in Jesus Christ this morning so I'll just read what they have to say in Hebrews the 12th chapter here and it really means this is what we need to do each day or I need to do each day where see foreseeing also or can pass about with such great a cloud of witness you know we had that witness in our day and age in the revealing word of the hour we have that witness and the only hope he gave us in this witness that he gave us was to be in Jesus Christ this morning so great a crowd of witness let us lay aside every weight and sin which so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking on to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sat down on the right hand of the Throne of God so you know when I read a scripture like that it tells me that you know I'm no better than than Christ was we all have to endure our sufferings we all have to endure our cross just like he did we you just have to take each day a day at a time for he considered them that endured such contradiction Sinners against himself these she be weary and faint minds and that's what I was thinking about this morning the age that we live in is trying just to Flat wear you out this morning it's trying to get you to surrender trying you give you no hope no desire no nothing this morning trying to get you just to pack it all in and go the other way but as a Christian it should make you want to get closer to the Cross not further away from it for consider him endured such cont Sinners against himself at least you be weary and faint in your minds and we have not resisted on the blood striving against sin you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto us as children my sons despise not the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked to him for whom the Lord loveth he chastens and scourage every son whom he shall receiveth if we endure Chas and God deal with you as with sons and if we which are sons in whom the father Chase not but if you be without chastisement where for are all partakers than than you are bastards and not son so what I was thinking this morning I don't have a lot to say and I thought I say I wouldn't say that this morning I know I say that a lot I you know we all are we have our own ways you know we all have our own inconsistencies the way we're brought up and things but the most important thing is as individuals this morning are you sold out to Jesus Christ this morning am I sold out this morning no matter what man does to me out there in the world I am not going to render evil for evil I'm always going to do the right thing because you know that I'll be honest with you in this world that we live in if people know that you're going to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do I'm going to tell you right now they're going to do everything they can to take advantage of you this morning but it doesn't give you a right to be to to strike back in people and all I could say this morning we just need to be closer to the cross this morning we need to be closer to Jesus Christ you see what's going on in the Middle East this morning you what's going on in the world we were given that time clock brother brandham said that's your time clock this morning what you see going on with his children this morning that she'll let you know that the only hope we I I can't say this enough the only hope we have this morning is in Jesus Christ Brother David that's right thank you Lord amen you love the Lord this morning amen how many believes your only hope is in Jesus Christ this morning amen let's stand and sing that little chorus this morning all my hope is in Jesus this morning amen you enjoy the Sunday school this morning and I tell you I

tell you dear Lord I love you now more than ever before amen you love the Lord this morning certainly good to be in the house of the Lord and um why don't you just you can have your seats for just a second maybe we'll speak here for just a minute and I I too want to say how much I enjoyed I think that'd be all the music thank you musicians uh how much we enjoyed yesterday and just the atmosphere and and uh the presence and uh just to see the smile on faces from two years old to brother Glenn how old are you 76 76 so I think he's our oldest here so but just to see The Smiling Faces and and we sure appreciate it and and uh just a good uh good uh time in the Lord and and seeing everybody happy you know a lot of times our our our children only see each other at church so they don't get a lot of time to talk and really Fellowship outside of of church so events like that's good for them and good to uh to let them get to know each other and and appreciate each other so um just uh just want to say a quick thing or two about the and just what I've seen in current events and stuff and it's no secret brother Brian talked about it what's going on in the world and and with Israel and attacks you know it's it's just a late late hour and uh you know uh we know brother Billy Paul passed away last week and and I told my wife I said uh you know when they were kind of announcing it looked like he was fixing the crossover I said this could really shake the message World up and U and I said but you know we have to look at it and and and know that God's in control of it all and so I wanted to look up that that thought and I found it and and it's it's in a mess too but it's you can find in the book of the acts of the Prophet where um uh brother Perry green talks about his interview with brother Billy Paul and so forth and then I thought it was kind of as I read through it he was talking about the destructions and the things that are to come to pass and I heard uh I was listening to brother Ron Spencer preach I guess it was last week he was preaching at his home church and you know the the world's doom day clock uh was set at 3 minutes I think back in the 60s or whatever um and then recently like last year year and a half it was set at 90 seconds and brother Ron said he saw and where somebody was talking about it now it's at 18 seconds so we're close we're close 18 seconds and uh so this little little excerpt here where brother random was talking about California you know we can't take for granted the prophecies that we've heard and the prophecies the things we know um because they we seen them come to pass time and time and time again so we can't take them for granted and he said California would would go into the ocean and it'll send a Title Wave all the way back into Kentucky and so it's you know I'm I'm hoping we're gone at that time but it it will happen um and you know the the statement that that I thought would shake the world would be where uh brother Bram said he turned to Billy Paul and and and uh he told him he said where you're standing downtown Los Angeles and brother Billy Paul replied he said yeah where you're standing in front of May Company downtown Los Angeles Billy he said I may not be here but you won't be an old man until shark swim right where you are standing well he's not an old man anymore and you know brother I think brother Potter made that statement years ago and I thought wonder what he means by that you know he kind of tried to hit on it but you know brother Billy Paul's not an old old man anymore he's in a body about 18 years old so you know I'm not trying to to to to be anything or say anything it's just uh just be aware of your surroundings and be aware of the events that's that's taking place around us so um if the if the world scientists and and people that's watching the world event say we're 18 seconds from from the end there's probably something to it because they sure they sure don't want to admit that but it's happening so stand with me and we'll get into the scriptures and good to have my Mom and Dad here with us this morning and and I know they watch online a lot but certainly certainly thankful to have them with us and um just a just an honor I'm I'm I'm who I am because of those two in the natural sense so I'm very thankful for my parents turn with me if you would to Second Kings chapter 6 and 14 we're going to try not to keep you long I know every everybody's probably tired and weary and but uh you know if you'll if you'll pull as hard today as you did on that rope yesterday we'll we'll get somewhere today so just just pull on the spiritual side today pull on that spiritual rope second Kings chapter 6 therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host that they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold and host let me slow down I hear your pages turning a host Compass the city both with horses and chariots and his Ser said unto him Elias my master how shall we do and he answered and said fear not for they that be with us are more than they be with them and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened his eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha I want to speak this morning on the thought of come and see come and see let's pray Heavenly Father we're thankful to be in your house this morning thankful for the Believers that's gathered this morning to to hear your word and to grow in your word and to be encouraged in your word Lord and we just want to tell you how much we love you and appreciate you and just ask Lord with all of our heart that you would use my vessel this morning and that you would uh just take take my thoughts away and put your thoughts in and and that you would use my mouth to speak the words that you would have us uh to speak to the people open our hearts that we could receive Lord we just want to tell you we love you with all of our hearts and thank you in Jesus name amen you can have your seats come and see come and see now I want to try to lay a foundation this morning I'm going to take my time I'm trying not not to hold you long but I do want to take my time to get started here and and lay a foundation I want to look at a familiar incident that happened to the prophet of the hour and he tells a story like this he said seeing God come in action isn't it wonderful he said here some time ago at Arlington Texas I was down at a hotel where I was staying and I heard a woman cry and I thought somebody is in trouble and I turned around to look and it was just coming through the little place and these two young girls probably in their early 20s 21 22 standing there a blonde and blackheaded girl they had their arms around one another and they were weeping and I said pardon me Miss I'm a minister can I help you and she said yes brother Brown I I knew I knew she knew me and I said what's the matter and she said well we couldn't get a prayer card to get in line and we know you the hotel you were staying in so we stayed right here and thought maybe if your Shadow might pass over my friend she would be healed Oh my he said I said what's the matter with her and she says she's mental and I brought her here and she's standing there in that great faith not a make Bel but a real faith and a vision broke forth and I said yes you come from Northern Texas near lck I said you brought her here in a yellow Buick car coming along there was half the Road was concrete the other half was tar and I said you started to turn around the corner you both were laughing you had the top down you almost had a wck can you imagine somebody sitting there and telling you the whole tra traffic that you just took the whole travel plans and and and you just screamed at the top of her voice and she just screamed at the top of her voice and I said thus sayith the Lord she's healed that's right and he said the next day she set the town on fire said she stirred the nest of the devil we need to get to a place that when God moves in our lives that we set the world on fire that we set the world on fire and we stir the nest of the devil now don't think that's always going to come back and bring goodness to you and glory to you because that means you're setting yourself up for maybe a little bit of hardship because he says as as she stirred the nest of the devil he said if you want to stir the devil start preaching Divine he he said Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and 3,000 Souls were saved and Satan never moved I'm talking about God In Action in our day I'm talking about God moving on the scene and answering your prayers I'm talking about healings taking place I'm talking about Deliverance taking place I'm talking about people who are already saved putting the power and demonstration of God into action and he says that's right the devil don't like to see God God display his power he thinks he's got a lot of power but he's finished our Christ is predominant take the initiative don't let him push something on you because so many times we find ourselves we let Satan creep into our lives and into our homes and into our bodies and into our even our minds you know and we allow Satan to come in and the next thing you know he's pushing things on you and he said don't let him do that don't let him push things on you but put God's power on display that's you and I displaying the power of God and listen what happens he said a couple of days after that here come brother Baxter in and said brother Bram he said the fats in the fire and I thought I don't know that I've ever heard that one and I know a lot of these little slangs and says but he said the Fat's in the fire and I thought I'm gonna look that up sure enough it means a course of action Within evitable bad consequences has begun there's trouble ahead for example now the fats in the fire the boss arrived early and we haven't even started work he said it's an or it says it's an expression and so think about this it's something that leads to trouble that has started and looks like it can't be stopped because this young lady receiveed her Deliverance because the power of God moved onto the SE she stirred the devil's nest and set the town on fire now the Fat's in the fire the heat is on and brother bter comes in and says the fats and the fire basically what he's saying is man brother brandom you've really done it this time you've really done it this time because you've set a chain of events into action and the devil is mad the devil is mad in this hour because God's people are living lives of Deliverance God's people people are seeing Miracles God's people are moving on up to a higher level that they've never seen [Applause] before Lord and he looked at him and he said what's the matter what's the matter he said they're going to expose you tonight as Simon the Sorcerer come on he said oh is that so is that so he said yeah brother brandom he said they got cards all over the city and then two girls you know the ones that was healed I said yes he said they're downstairs and they're crying and they're packing up their clothes to go home he said oh it's pathetic brother brandham he says what I said well what's the matter and he said well they said they hated it because their testimony had stirred up such an awful road down there they felt sorrow they felt bad because their testimony of going out and say come and see let me show you what God has done for me they they felt sorrowful because they're testimony was getting the prophet in trouble and he says so he says they went down there he says you need to go down there because the FBI is going to get you tonight and expose you these two girls are going out with a testimony and a witness of what God's done in their life see what God has done for me and the devil says I'm going to expose you you see what's happening it's always a conflict it's always about ble a good versus evil and so he says oh okay he says if that's right I ought to be exposed he's not afraid if that's right I ought to be exposed he says well you better get in there and talk to them they're downstairs he said okay he said went to the room he said I knocked on the door and they were crying and packing their clothes these two young ladies 21 22 and said brother Brandon we're so sorry we're so sorry he says what are you sorry about and she says well uh We've caused you so much trouble and we've got you in trouble and said it's all over he said trouble you have over someone getting healed you see how the devil tries to take a good thing and pervert it into a Bad Thing sure these girls now have a guilty conscience because of what God has done for them we don't have to live a guilty conscience because of what God has done for us we can still stand there and say a testimony look what God has done in my life I was a sinner you were a sinner we were all liars born in this world speaking Lies come and see what God has done and these girls are sitting there and he says you ain't got me in no trouble the devil's in trouble he says that's the one that's in trouble not me and she said well brother brand said we're so sorry we're we sat down by a woman today and she said are you in that brandom party and I said no ma'am I guess she kind of misunderstood what what she was asking she said oh yes you are I think Peter was in that place one time yeah oh yes you are said you just said no no I just got healed over there the other night in a hotel he said the other night when when he prayed we my my friend got healed and she said listen that man's a that man is a witch and we know it and she says W said she said lady my friend come with me that was going into an insane institution and to test her but today she's perfectly normal she's perfectly normal and she said oh yes now listen you listen to how the devil will come back against this and he he'll put his his own interjection in there and she said oh I know this woman that she was talking to I put a boy in his meeting one time that had TB and he went up there and did his Hocus Pocus over him he said and the baby got over the TB but it was the devil and any and brother Brown said anybody that knows no don't know no more about that knows that the devil don't have one power or nothing to heal I challenge that he said if the devil that can heal then he's he's in cahoots with God and the Bible says I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases and so she listen now she says well we're sorry she's still sorry we're going home we're so sorry he said now look you know your girl your friend's healed yes isn't God wonderful in healing yes said you want to come see him in battle tonight boy he's wonderful he didn't cow down when the spirit of evil come against him and when the spirit of evil tried to contradict what had happened and the spirit of evil had tried to take credit for healing a boy with TB he said no you need to come tonight and watch because watch him in battle he's wonderful and and he said she said you're not going over there and he said well you don't expect me to run do you we're not running from anybody I'm not running from the Satan or the devil or any of his any of his people out of the pits of hell I'm not running I'm going to stand Toe to [Applause] Toe and she said well the FBI is going to expose you I said expose what he said what have they got to expose he said I like this I've been trying my best to be exposed to try to get the gospel to everybody I can I'd like to be helped along a little he talking about a comeback just come on bring it on so when we have circumstances in our life no matter what it is say devil expose what God has done to the entire world so that the world can see God is mighty he said sure I said come and see the Lord in battle you know he's wonderful in healing you see him in battle once time you see how great he is in there he's marvelous in battle I said I've never seen him come into battle yet where he comes out without packing the victory you say well I'm in a tough battle I'm fighting a battle like I've never fought before I've been sicker than I've ever been sick before I've been more depressed than I've ever been depressed before I've been more anxious than I've ever been anxious before he's never went into a battle where he didn't come out packing the victory listen to this he said even when they put him in hell they put his head they put his his foot on his neck he put his foot on the neck of the devil and took out the keys away from him and on the third day even in death he come out in Triumph and he said Satan ain't got nothing on him Satan ain't got nothing on him brothers and sisters we're in a battle this morning and even though the battle is Raising we can look at the time the timeline of what's Happening in the world and the battle is Raging we can't be afraid to put a little fat in the fire we can't be afraid to stir the devil up a little bit we can't be afraid to step up and say this is what God is capable of through me through you through his Believers we can't limit what God can do brothers and sisters it's a time that we Face Satan face to face toet to toe and under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost let the world know that Satan you ain't got nothing on us because under the Holy Ghost you're exactly what God is and if and if Satan don't have nothing on God with you being filled with the Holy Ghost and on the inspiration of the Holy Ghost how can he have anything on you thank you Lord you say how are we going to do it how how can we prove it let me tell you something you were born to overcome yeah you were born to conquer you were born to defeat Satan's Army and the Ws of the devil in this last day you were born to be a witness and I know that there is a greater force than cancer listen to me there is a greater force than cancer than fear than doubt than nervousness there's a greater force than all of that this morning and if all of Heaven stands who can stand against us how can we lose I said how can we lose how can you lose sister Alicia how can he lose how can he lose how can you lose Elisha and his servants are surrounded by an enemy Army and Elijah's servant is is panicking and he's saying we're surrounded there's only two of us and there's an entire Army that's coming and going to take us they set the Army against us to come and get us and destroy us they're coming after us brothers and sisters let us God help us to realize that we're living in a spiritual warfare this morning and that God's Army knows no defeat greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and El sitting there looking at this and Elisha now can you imagine the prophet of that hour calmly looking around and looks at his servant and says Don't Be Afraid don't be afraid for those that are with us are more than those that are with them and I can imagine at this point he's looking around and he says man this guy may be a prophet but he ain't no math magician mathematician he ain't no statistician but cuz there's two of us and thousands of them and he's sitting there panicking and he's panicking and he's looking and he's thinking there's no way we're going to get out of this sometimes Satan will tell you yeah that's right it's what you see what the doctors tell you what's your financial advisors tell you what the therapist tells you what your boss tells you what your neighbor tells you the tumor is too big the anxiety can't be overcome the fear is too real are you with me and you hear these things over and over it's terminal your marriage is lost it's genetic but somewhere down the line we have to look at there and be like Elisha and open our eyes of spiritual eyes and say there's Chariots of Fire all around me and these Chariots of Fire are angels sent from God that will not let me be we have to understand there's an army that stands behind us that is greater than any military force amen and I thought about this and I hadn't told this but I'm going to tell it I think brother Tommy will let me brother Tommy went through we know we've heard his testimon we know we we were everybody was here when it happened he went through a through an illness a disease that he should have dropped dead I'm a nurse sister Le is a nurse my wife's a nurse Hannah's a nurse other nurse brother Troy's got nursing background medical background he should have dropped dead just like that when you tear the aorta the biggest blood vessel in your body there's no stopping it but God had other plans God other plans we begin to get on our knees and we begin to pray for brother Tommy we begin to pray and we begin to believe that God can still work miracles was there time of trouble brother Tommy was there time of trouble did you lay in a hospital did you fear he was scared no doubt he was scared but we were believing for him he had began to believe and as he began to get better and better he can see the working of God in his life and know that I should be a dead man but God is raising me up I thought man this is it he's good he's he's he's got they got him on the right medication now and he's gonna he's gonna pull through this it wasn't long I preached and he come up here to The Altar and he said I'm throwing my medicine away I want you to pray for me think about it and I'm standing right here and I got my arm running he said I'm throwing my medicine away and I want you to pray for me I'm a registered nurse so from the natural side I'm wanting to say man you can't do that you you you you you you you you you you can't do that brother throw away am I right from the natural side but I said his faith is greater than my faith right it's not for me to question his faith I said I'll pray I'll pray for you so we begin to pray and we prayed right there at the bottom of that Altar and we pray that if he want to get off his medication that he could back it up by doctor's proof that he's getting better and he got as far as I know he got off of it he may still be on something I don't know but he come back later and he had testimony and and images that God had moved in his life and that the terror had begun to heal and that he was getting better and better he let science prove that my God is the great physician so the doctors can say terminal all they want they don't know my god when the doctors say terminal I say come and see when the doctor say it can't be fixed I say come and see when your marriage looks hopeless I say come and see anything we go through it can be the simplest of things let me tell you I I'll just give you a little testimony you know we and you know our little side business we raise flowers well this year we put out all our flowers like we normally do we cut back some just just because we had some we couldn't move last year we felt good about it and I was sitting there and I started calling some of the people that we sell to well this one of our biggest customers decided not to buy this year so now we got like thousand plants we don't even know what we're going to do with thousand plants another one that I called yeah my kids not playing on that team anymore we're not going to we're not going to do it this year we do fundraisers for teams and schools call another one well yeah we we've had a change in coaches we're not going to we're not going to be doing that this year they decided they want to do something different these numbers are adding up and we're growing flowers and I thought to myself I said there's one of two things I can do I can either panic I can panic and throw in the tow and think man there's no way we're going to come out of this or I can say come and see and watch God move on the scene so we begin to pray and we begin to pray and my dad he said in the eye we'll get rid of him it'll be all right that's and he's generally not the most optimistic I'm G to step over here I don't want him throwing a song book at me and he telling me it's going to be all right yeah God can move on the S we picked up a new customer and we picked up another new customer and we picked up another new customer and they want more next year and they want more this year and we cleared off all of our moms about four weeks before we normally clear them off so and gone let me add to it disease is a problem you got to watch in these flowers we normally raised about 5,000 or so 6,000 moms and we would lose 100 200 to disease we cut back our numbers this year we raised about 4,500 to 5,000 I don't know and if we had have lost a two or three hundred to disease we'd have been short on months probably I think we lost seven every everybody else around the community was saying man we're losing them left and right disease is going through this is going through that's going through we're losing we've lost this many we go by mum pad there be piles of mums off to the side that's disease stricken [Applause] seven God is mindful if you will just look Satan in the eyes and say come and see watch what God does for me my family my children my church and let him work on the [Applause] scene Ela he says oh Lord please open his eyes that he can see and the Lord opened the eyes of his servant and all these horses and chariots are there and all of a sudden the servant realized yes yes we're more than able we're more than them with that Army and that's the way we need to live on day by day we are [Music] more I got a I got to uh I got to speak tomorrow at Sister Mary rli's funeral and burial they asked me to come and speak so I'm going to speak and and I got to thinking about it and was talking to Debbie her daughter and you know Sister Mary if you remember she would always always sing that song There are angels all around us and she it was her signature song and she would sing that song over and over in a world full of trouble as we travel along God is our father we're on our way home if forces of evil ever close in on you Jesus has promised this is what he will do there are angels all around us and I thought about that and I thought you know this goes so well with what Elisha saw and what elishah did for his servant Elijah and he looks and he sees these chariots and I just say God help us realize in this Unseen World you're pushing us every single day to be better and and stronger and more full of the Holy Ghost and [Applause] power the spiritual forces they're pulling us we're just we're just trapped in a at this point we're just in a trap we're trapped on this Earth in a time in a moment of time between two forces this one's pulling this one's pulling somebody said the other day what is it you take one step forward two you get KN two back and it feels that way sometime but help us to realize that these forces of evil that are pulling us they're trying to pull us away from God if it's not something that you would be willing I liked what one person said maybe I think I think it'll be okay young lady was wearing stuff she shouldn't have been wearing okay Grandma tells her dad she shouldn't be wearing that stay out of our business kind of thing you know that was the reply The Comeback and she said she shouldn't be wearing anything to school she wouldn't wear to church let that sink in when we allow things to start pulling us and pulling us things get a little little less important you know what I'm saying little little more showing a little less spiritualness a little more of this kind of music or that kind of music next thing you know you you you you find your children listening to music they shouldn't be listening to yeah and I'm I'm a person that thinks you got to be there for your children you got to be there Holy Ghost and you got to do things but you also got to let them find out where the rubber meets the road they've got to have their own experience so you can't go in there and just constantly bang bang bang bang bang this is the way it is this is my opinion but I there there's a line there's a limit to where we say no this ain't happening you're gone too far and then we let God come back in and take over and let God begin to move on the scene and let God pull them back over this way if Satan's pulling this way we need to get on that tug-of war rope brothers sisters when your children are being pulled this way grab a hold to that rope it's like uh brother brother Austin said or brother Josh said he said you ever wants to real tug of war match on YouTube I said no not really he said you to look it up he said they dig trenches he said they dig trenches and they sit down they get in those trenches and they'll all sit there and they'll say who P so when you see your loved on you see your children you see people and he say pull a certain way we all need to get together and grab a hold and say Boo brother sister pull brother sister pull and pull on God and let God pull our children back into the back into the where they need to [Applause] be good preaching there's a time when we need to make an announcement to the world that's right you know what an announcement is Right announcement is when you say hey this event is fixing to happen we want you all to be there we all want you to participate we all want you to see what we're about to do when a wedding we have a wedding we have a wedding announcement right you're announcing to everybody hey this is a special day well that's what we got to do we got to set an announcement up and say today come see my God In Action today the doctors told me this come see my God In Action today my children are going to stray but come see my God In Action I'm going to announce to the world Watch What Happens because I'm dedicating this situation to God because I have no control if I could fix all of our problems with a magic wand I me and brother B would do we'd be wanting everybody it look like Harry Potter up here that's right we'd be trying to fix everybody's problem but it's not us we have to have God to fix our problems and we have to announce to the world and we have to believe and we have to trust in God that he can and will fix those problems so come see my God as a Healer come see my God as a deliverer and brother Brown said this he said oh God in nature watch him in his Universe just a moment he says we can take no matter how hard the trial is just hold on to his wings and he'll bear you away watch God in his Birds watch how he cares for it watch God in his Sunset he said watch God in his rabbits watch God work yeah all right I'm gonna finish my my story for just a minute he said so that night there had been that couple of girls that been healed and they come over crying and said oh they was going home they was afraid he said the FBI I'll pick you up brother brandom and this girl was put in her right mind and he said we seen the vision over her and and uh he said it cause they thought it caused trouble and I said oh you're scared he said I said but you've seen God the Healer haven't you and I said watch him as a warrior watch him in battle and he said see how great he is

because I'm no criminal said every time an FBI agent come into my meetings they got [Applause] saved he said their Chief got saved in the meeting he said and and no FBI does anything like that he said no what it was what it is is two backsliding preachers that's right yeah oh now we're standing Toe to Toe now we're seeing God as a warrior in battle now we're seeing God moving on the scene and saying that he's mightier than Satan and as they stand Toe to Toe the challenge is going forth into the balcony and he's calling out these too he says I see that Spirit he said there is a big black thing hanging over the audience and I seen it move right up into the second balcony and I said right there setting one with a white suit one with a gray suit Toe to Toe [Applause] Showdown and he said they got down like that and I said don't get down down don't get down I thought you was going to expose me I thought you was going to expose me he says you're just a bunch of a couple of backing preachers you have nothing to do with it and said you say I'm Simon the Sorcerer And casting out devil with witchcraft he says but and you say you are holy and righteous and God come on down to the platform if I'm Simon the Sorcerer I will fall dead yeah keep in mind this showdown is taking place between here and two people up there and he said there were thousands watching come and see come and see my God In Action thousands were watching he said and and if and if you're son if you're the one that's wrong you'll fall dead he says come on down and now we'll see who's right we'll put them to that challenge he said they kept their head down and I said don't duck your heads like that don't duck your head like that Satan I got something for you boo [Applause] devil you know brother Ron had some of his signature messages boo devil well I'm going to use it today I like it Prophet said he was reading the other day where a man said the devil got before him and he said he was just a little bitty old devil and he said boo and I jumped back and he said I jump back and every time that the devil would holler boo I would jump back and the devil get bigger and he said over and over I'd get little he'd get bigger because the devil kept saying boo and I get smaller each time that I jump back and he'd get bigger and I said I know I've got to fight him sometimes fighting the devil ain't always a challenge we go looking for yeah but you can't shy away he said I know I had fight him and I said I looked around and I thought what I found the word of God and I rolled it into my hand and the devil said boo and I said boo and he said and and when he said that and when I said boo back every time I said boo he got smaller and I got bigger every time I said boo the devil got smaller and I got bigger and it's all what side you're pulling from are you going to listen to him or are you going to tell him what he's going to do get out of my life Satan get out of my children Satan get out of my marriage Satan get out of my body Satan get out of my mind Satan boo devil boo devil boo devil you know it's it's fun well I can't say this really but it's fun to know you got the upper advantage on people you know Satan's under your feet right and I probably shouldn't say this but I'm going to I'm human I don't always you know preachers get in the flesh sometimes too just telling you if you didn't know that we do Carson comes home one day love you buddy and he says this teacher is kind of bullying him telling him this telling him that and this and that and this and that I said no you're not going to be bullied by some teacher they're supposed to be there to teach you to encourage you to show you right I said don't let him bully you well they they'll kick me out of Honor Society they'll kick me out ofan this and this I said listen next time this is what let me finish my story before you judge me I said next time he tells you this that or the other I said you just walk up there and look down on him he six six in Boots okay I said you just walk up there and look down on him and say would you like to say that again or would you like me to call my dad he said you serious yeah I'm serious but then I thought about it and thank goodness nothing happened that day and I said listen if it happens again if this continues to go on I said don't go up there getting his face don't go making a s I said but just pull out your phone you know you're not supposed to have your phones in school I said just pull out your phone and start dialing and when he asked what you're doing say I'm calling my dad so you can tell him what you just told me I thought that would be a better approach but there's always something about when you got the devil under your feet if youve got that upper Advantage you got the devil under your feet you you you you're moving in the right direction boo devil make him smaller you get bigger boo devil bigger devil smaller back to our story and B said now people who see who see who is in the right and who's in the wrong this is actually he said don't duck your heads he said they are scared and they went out over the top of the there just as hard as they could go oh I see you're leaving he said perhaps maybe they're coming down here' he said they went out of the building as hard as they could down those steps I stood there and waited and I saidwell now we'll just see let them come to the platform let God know who is who that's right and I said if I'm if I be falsely then God will show it falsely if I'm right God will always Testify the right we can rest assured that God will always testify if you're doing right you say well sometimes I feel so defeated sometimes I feel so small well there's a little boy one time the little small boy of the family and he's out tending sheep and there his brothers were out fighting a battle that you can't imagine and his daddy says hey take your brother says David pulls up there he walks up there to the to the battle scene he's looking out there and he sees an entire Army of paralyzed soldiers under the paralyzed Spirit listening to a a a a Goliath of an enemy these solders sitting out there and they're listening to Goliath Boo and they're getting smaller yeah that's right and goli says boo Y and they're getting smaller and weaker until to the matter that they just stand there and they don't know what to do and here comes this little Ruddy boy and he walks up there can you imagine as he stands toet to toe a just a teenager possibly a young Ruddy boy and he stands toet to Toe with this Behemoth of a giant and he's got five Little River Rocks in his pocket let me tell you the whole world was watching you can bet that there was tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides when that Philistine called out and David come stepping out there and said today buddy I'm gonna take your head off what what did he say today buddy come and see what God is going to do for our people come and see how God can move in our lives [Applause] there's a man by the name of Daniel there's a man by the name of Daniel and he was in a Babylon Babylonian Kingdom Under the rule of Darius and Darius liked Daniel so much because Daniel was so wise he was a man about 80 years old when all this happened and he he so wise and he was so popular with Darius and Darius put him up into into a little bit of the hierarchy well that made people jealous you ever know notice how the devil gets jealous you can be doing good you're doing something for God you're exactly where you're supposed to be and somebody sees it look at him he's trying to do this I was supposed to do that jealous and here's Daniel now sitting there and so these jealous bodies come and say hey we think we need to have a decree put in place that only prayers can be PR is to our God well you know Darius wasn't thinking too much Darius wasn't thinking too much and he looks there and he says you know what that's a great idea we love our Gods so everybody should pray to our gods and if they don't well we'll put them in the lines then he he forgot about old Daniel and then he realized as as Daniel goes home and he begins to pray and they come and warn don't you can't pray to your God what did Daniel do he pulled up the blinds and said come and see abolutely come and see watch what I do for my God come and see God in action so they come and they haul Daniel away they come and they haul him away and they put him right there at the pit of the Lion's Den and Darius now is in a panic because oh no this is Daniel this is my favorite and and Darius is saying I'm I'm so sorry Daniel I'm so sorry but I can't back up on the decree you got to go into the liines then yeah that's okay come and see come and see what my God can do for me they threw Daniel into the lion's pit and Darius it said did not sleep all night long worried about Daniel and as they threw man he said I hope your God can can save you Daniel and all night long Darius is losing sleep and Darius comes back on the next day all panicked and nervous and nervous and hands are sweating and he looks down there and he says Daniel Daniel yeah yes [Applause] sir did your God see you through yes kittens man I got the best pets in the world yes they Shu the mouths of the Lions get up out of there Daniel come up out of there Daniel and you know when Darius when all this happened they took and Darius through the ones down there they come up with this decree and it says instantly the Lions broke every bone in their body come and see what God can do come and see what God can do you I can imagine I can imagine as as Daniel's down there and no doubt when he first got through down in there maybe those lines kind of snarled up and Daniel said boo come and see what God can do there was a lady of ill Fame I'm hurrying Lady of ill Fame all of her money invested into a an alabaster box and she looks over to the side and sees her sees her savior sees her Jes Jesus at a party at a get together nothing more than to make a mockery out of Jesus Christ and there she sees him sitting in the corner dirty filthy stinky dirty feet and she goes over there and she begins to look and she begins to take all of her life's savings and earnings of ill Fame the money she made as a prostitute and she invested into God you think all eyes wasn't on that scene you see we never know who's watching but I promise you Somebody's Watching somebody's watching and she begins to S over there and she breaks the bo the the the box of alabaster with the perfume and the oil and she begins to shed her tears on the feet of Jesus and she begins to anoint his feet with oil and she's crying tears and tears because she knows who she is and she knows who he is and and and then they come down there and Simon comes down there and says hey this woman is going to ruin your reputation this woman is going to ruin your reputation she's no more than a prostitute she's going to ruin your reputation but you see that ain't the truth you that that can't her reputation couldn't have been ruined because Jesus's reputation is built on sinners do you realize that Jesus's reputation is not built on Kings it's not built on gold it's not built on riches it's not built on cattle it's built on you and I who wasn't worthy and because we and I wasn't worthy and we were Sinners his reputation says I went to the cross and I died for those people that's the reputation of Jesus and now all eyes are on this and Simon it says hey you can't let her do that you're you you're making a mockery of my of my party here and Jesus says Simon I got something to say to you look at your Bible Jesus speaks to him I got something to say to you Simon you left me here dirty you left me here filthy you left me here stinking you didn't offer me any drink you didn't offer me refreshment you didn't offer my to wash my feet and this woman here has not ceased to stop washing my feet come and see can you imagine as she looks up at Jesus and the tears are running down her face and her hair is all down and drenched with the oil that she'd been washing his feet with and she looks up and wonders what will he say and she says forgiven she hears forgiven come and see come and see about the 11:00 in the day Jesus as sends his disciples into the city go get us some food I'm going to wait here by the well and Jesus is waiting by the well and here comes this this uh Samaritan woman about 11:00 in the day keep that in mind and Jesus is sitting there and he says woman bring me a drink and this woman looks around you you you you can't be talking to me this this is not customary you can't talk to me you can't ask me for a favor you can't ask me for a drink and he says woman if you know who I was you would ask me for a drink well it took her a few minutes because she said well you ain't even got nothing to draw with Buddy and he looks at that and he's sitting down there and he begins to look and she's sitting there and they begin to convers converse with each other you would ask me for a drink if you knew who I was and how are you going to do that because the well is deep and you have nothing to draw with and he said the water that I give is the Water of Life aren't you thankful this morning that you've been to the Water of Life that you've been to the water the fountain you don't have to have a bucket to drink out of you don't have to have a fountain or a garden hose you're not going to go to the to to the desani but you've got the water of life that flows from the very Throne of God that gives you life and life Everlasting this meant so much to her she began to see that because Jesus began to speak to her and you know the story he began to speak to her said you you know you you've got five husbands and one you're with now is not your husband and she said you're a prophet for 400 years we've been waiting for the prophet you must be the Messiah and Jesus speaks to her what did what did she do what did she do she run into the City and said what come and see a man who tells me everything come and see I got time for two more Mary and Martha Mary and Martha sent word to Jesus Jesus our brother is sick we need you to come right away hurry no Jesus so he comes down and he begins to see he he finally shows up and he can see the the atmosphere and people are Weeping and people are crying so he knows what has happened it wasn't a surprise to me he knew what was going to happen because you know Jesus even at a distance he could have prevented the whole thing he didn't have to be there he got wor he could have just easily change the whole situation that's how powerful God is you don't have to necessarily be prayed for by a certain preacher you don't have to be go go pay penants you don't have to do it's just a matter of getting in contact with God and if God is ready to do that just like that he can prevent he can give he can take he's God yeah but the whole situation could have been prevented but then here Jesus comes and he sees all of this and then the shortest ver in the Bible is what Jesus J wept now you know you can read what the scholars write about Jesus weeping and how he was sorry and he felt bad and he was mourning with Mar and Mary but I kind of like the way brother Tim preaches it he said Jesus wept not because he was sad because Lazarus was gone he wept because he was sad that he had to bring Lazarus back from where he was Lazarus was on the other side Lazarus was happy Lazarus was living the life and now Jesus is thinking Mary Martha don't don't me can you just imagine don't make me do this can you imagine what Lazarus felt when he C when he was called back and he stepped back he probably thought why am I back here why did you call me back but here's Mary and Martha they go out to meet Jesus Martha does and she says if you have got here earlier Lazarus wouldn't have died and she said don't wor he said don't worry your brother will he'll rise again and she said I know I know he'll rise again I know I know everything's good there I know when God's people are resurrected and so she went to get Mary and Mary and Martha run in there and they begin to look at this and and as they're sitting there Lazarus is buried in the cave and people are gathered around it and Jesus arrives at the cave and he asks all the people roll away the stone now can you imagine how many eyes were on that event here's a man been in the grave no modern day embalming wrapped in grave clothes in probably a hot climate wrapped up been there dead for four days and Jesus says roll away the stone and Martha gas no no you how can you do that you can't do that Lazarus has been dead he's going to [Music] stink and the people begin to push on the stone because Jesus said Martha just wait and see wait and see because if you believe you will see the glory of God thank you Lord so Jesus then the stones rolled away and Jesus begins to speak and as Jesus begins to speak and he looks down there and he says Lazareth come forth there was a showdown right there yeah can you imagine how Lazarus felt when his eyes open I'll be saying get these get these wraps off of me and that's what happened Jesus said what did he say take those grave clothes off of him take the can you imagine being the person say I don't know about this I don't know if I want do do that but Jesus said take those grave clothes off of him Lazarus come forth do you think Lazarus just kind of stood there and was like well here I am no I think he said probably said here I am what do you want Lord here I am what are we going to do he probably had a little pep in his step just like when Jesus went down there to the pool of bassetta and he's sitting there and the man's slaying on the on the cot and he says or do you want to be made well I nobody will take me to the water and Jesus says that's not what I ask you do you want to be made well do you want to be whole yes Lord but every time the waters are troubled everybody runs in front of me they knock me down and I can't get there and I can't get to the water do you want to be made whole it's not about what happens all around you it's about the relationship and watching what God can do in your life and he said yes Lord I want to be made whole he said well rise up pick up your bed and follow me rise up and walk I don't imagine he was walking I imagine he was a running I imagine he said praise the Lord I hadn't walked in 30 years I haven't done anything in 30 years but praise God come and see world watch what has happened see what God has done for me I have to close here Jesus is laying in a tomb cold and chalky spear been placed in his side nails through his hands nails through his feet spit was on his beard by the mocking soldiers they tied a rag around his head and said now you Vision Seer prophesy tell us who hit you mock was still in the air as they say come down off that cross perform a miracle all eyes were on that scene All Eyes Were Watching if you're a miracle worker make us believe all eyes are on that scene and the prophet said the same devil that met him and said if thou be the Son of God perform a miracle and let me see you do it and I'll believe it that de human flesh today but it's still a devil and he says that Jesus didn't go to put on a public show he didn't go to put on a public show or make himself a clown or he didn't clown around for the people but he did what was right he did what the father showed him to do and he said but let's watch him now as he stands there listen to what he says I've never read this till this this evening he says let's watch as he stands there all eyes are on Jesus and he says gravitation loses its power gravitation loses its power his feet begin to come up from the earth there's light beneath his feet and he gets higher and higher and higher and gravitation lost its power just as death loses its power he was the center of gravitation he was the creator of gravitation he held gravitation at his own command and he held death at his own command when Jesus went into the cross when the blood was shed all eyes were on the calvary all eyes were on the temple and when he went down and when he come up again and the veil was rent of the temple for the whole world to see what Jesus has done for you and me make no doubt about it Jesus God Almighty will go Toe to Toe with the devil for you and you and you and you and me any place any time anywhere any challenge that the devil wants to throw at of us on our families our children our jobs or whatever it may be in your life God will stand toet to toe and he will win every single time [Applause] right let's stand to our feet you know you say well so and so ended up dying we prayed for him is that what you think was they a Christian then they didn't die you said well we would we thought a miracle was going to happen here we thought a miracle was going to happen on this side we thought they were going to raise up we thought they were going to be completely healed let me tell you when you cross over the devil has no more victory over you they he can torment you he can come into your dreams he can come to you he can torment you day in day out he can Hound you he can push your buttons all he wants to but there comes a day when he cries and he says I didn't get them they made it when we take a Rapture and the Bride of Jesus Christ is lifts up here and we watch gravitation lose its power there's coming a day when gravitation will lose its power and Satan's going to look he's G say they made it I didn't get them I tried and I tried but I couldn't get them they win they [Applause] won you love the Lord this morning listen How Great Is Our God I don't know what key we're in what key would we be in brother Josh How great is our God uh
