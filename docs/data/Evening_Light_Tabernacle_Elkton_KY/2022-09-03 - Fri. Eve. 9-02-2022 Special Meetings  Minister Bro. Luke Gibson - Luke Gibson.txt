lord for to me so great yes it is so rich and free let's give the lord a great handclap of grace tonight praise be to the living god i'm sure glad salvation is free because if it wasn't i sure wouldn't be able to afford it we couldn't pay the price no man could have paid the price i didn't have the ability to redeem anybody and none of y'all had the ability to redeem me we couldn't afford to pay that price and if we did have any righteousness the bible said it's all as filthy rags so you sure wouldn't take a filthy rag and try to clean something that's already dirty we had to have someone that could that was greater than this that was beyond us and that was almighty god who's changed his strain from the great holy god spirit and come down and become a man he become one of us and what an exchange he made he he who knew no sin became sin that we by the grace of god might become his righteousness amen i'm glad it's a free gift amen it's for anybody that's willing to accept and to believe it amen certainly good to be in the house of the lord tonight brother thomas thank you so much for amen inviting us again to minister in this youth meeting and i just trust that the holy spirit will just guide us tonight guide us throughout this meeting and i trust when it's all said and done if you're not saved you'll get saved and then if you are saved i pray that it just brings us closer to christ that's our desire anyways to walk as close to him as we can and not only that not just walk with him we want him to walk in us until we are god with two feet on him amen so god bless you tonight if you would open your bible with me to saint john chapter 5. i said in my heart i'm not going to preach long every service i'm going to be quick get into my message get my thought over and let you get out and brother david's already bragging on the food over there so i didn't know if he's trying to tell me hurry up so we can get over there so whatever it is we just trust that the holy spirit will have his way tonight thank you for being here i'm glad i'm here my wife is with me i don't know where she's at she's somewhere there she is sister lisa and then it got about eight of our young people from eight or nine i think from our church that's here with us and you know we were here i don't know how many years ago quite a few years ago i don't remember we brought a bus up about 40 or so young people or so and all of them well my daughter-in-law back there they all of them are growed up married and all got kids and i've got six grandchildren one more on the way well all of them were like these guys when we came and so we have a little generational gap and these are our next group coming up and they're just as bad as that other young group they're already looking at women and you know girls and boys and all that and that's just a part of life that's the way it is amen we just want to serve the lord that's that's our main purpose and i'm sure that's why you're having these meetings is to bring young people closer to the lord amen so john chapter 5 if you have your bible saint john chapter 5 and i want to read four verses from there saint john chapter 5 thank you brother saint john chapter 5 beginning with verse 1 and then i want to turn over to jesus chapter 2. everybody happy tonight amen saint john chapter 5 beginning with verse 1 after these after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem by the way um he did celebrate the jewish feast jesus as a boy all the way up to his life attended his feast ultimately he went because he would end up being the fulfillment of all of these feasts now there is a jerusalem the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue besada having five torches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk are blind and halt and withered waiting for the moving of the water now listen to this for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever noticed these words whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease they had so let me say this again whosoever that means anybody when the angel troubled the water they got in there they were cured of whatsoever it wasn't nothing too hard for god he'd do anything for anybody he so it was whosoever was healed of whatsoever now i'm gonna bring something to your thought tonight because what you will not find in these verses is when so ever because whensoever was only when the angel stirred the water these same sick folk could got in that water a day before or day after and it wouldn't have done no good because we believe in whosoever but not when so ever you can only get in when god stirs the water can't come to god whenever you want you come when the holy ghost calls you now turn with me in ephesians chapter 2 if you would ephesians chapter 2 very familiar verse verses here starting with verse 1 and paul said and you have the quickened who were dead dead in trespasses and sins that's all of us where any times past this is before christ you walked according the course of this world according to prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our conversation that means the life that you lived in times past how in the lust of our flesh fulfill the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature notice this nature the children wrath even as others by nature that means we all came in the world by sexual birth and we had a nature that was contrary to god just because your bride denied doesn't mean that you weren't a sinner we all were sinners but you see this little word in verse 4 starts the verse but that means everything changes but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead notice this even when we were dead in sins and trespasses had quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up now here's present tense raised us up and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus now here's our future that in the ages to come he might show of exceedingly riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus or by grace are you saved through faith i love this and not that of yourselves it is a gift of god not of works lest any man should boast now everybody here tonight has a right to boast you have a right to brag as long as you brag on the right one and that's on jesus bow your heads if you would just for a moment father we thank you for your word we thank you for the privilege father of again tonight of being assembled lord in your divine presence we thank you for the songs of zion that was sung oh god lord we come now as we open the bible all the greatest book that's ever been written on the face of the earth what a privilege it is to read from it tonight father the lord your prophet said any man can open the bible but god it takes the holy spirit to make it live and lord jesus we pray as we just pull our little thought tonight from this oh god that you'll just like take the bread and put it in your hand and multiply it father to the heart of the people speak to the young people tonight lord in a special way oh god i pray you'd help me to get out of the way and lord jesus you just to have your way in this service we pray that you'd meet every need among us oh god we're all a needy people tonight may you have the preeminence in this service we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ and the whole church says amen god bless you you may be seated what i find amazing in this little story first of all is that jesus performed this miracle following the troubling of the water on a man that had been lame and he didn't have the ability to be able to get into the water the time it was troubled and jesus performed a miracle and the religious folk of that day got angry because that he performed it on the sabbath i think it's a terrible shame when we get to the place that we're more interested in laws than we are souls when our creeds of our church means more to us than sick folk but jesus didn't matter because he knew that the sabbath was made for man and man was not made for the sabbath not only that he was the lord of the sabbath and then he follows that up when when their anger he follows it up and says basically i've only done what the father showed me for the son can do nothing of himself but what the father shows him so our scene tonight begins at the pool of the seder and here at a certain season the bible said an angel would come down and that angel the prophet said would actually get into the water now maybe sight unseen maybe they never saw no angel but they saw the effects of the presence of that angel tonight we may not necessarily see god with our natural eyes but we certainly feel the effects of his presence when he comes in we see him heal the sick we see him cast out devils the greatest thing we see him do is take a sin sick soul and redeem them by his grace wash them in his blood and they walk out and hear a spotless son and daughter of almighty god that's one of the greatest miracles that could ever happen on a human being is to be redeemed by the blood of the lord jesus christ and so i will say this before we get started that each one of us were at one time in that condition and it is true we could not help ourselves we could maybe reform we can maybe do a little better we can make a lot of you know a little what we call every year make little vows and things of that nature but that won't get us any closer to god there's nothing that man can do to reach god but there is something god can do to reach us i'm glad one day he reached down and got a hold of us amen so we find here that when the angel and i want to hurry the angel troubled the water the first person to get into that water amen after it was troubled was made whole now let me just say this that means there was a lot of sick folk i'll show you what brother batman said great multitudes brother madam said one multitude is about 2 000 people he said there were great multitudes so there were several thousands of people that was there at that water waiting with anticipation on the stirring of that water now brother they could have gotten that water every day they could obey they could have swam they could have baptized they could have done a lot of things dumped themselves in it and it would not have any effect on them but once that angel stirred that water and put virtue in that water and it started turning the first man that dropped in there became a beneficiary of the virtue of that water which tells me one thing it was just water there was no healing in it there was just water but when god got in it it became supernatural amen brother i'll just say this we can have church this weekend and we can have church and go out and say we had church but if god comes among us it'll be all together a different story amen lives will be changed now we understand the probably god told us that the water had no healing power believe this or not the church world has got to the place they sell miracle water they sell holy water now i'm just going to be honest and i'm not going to be mean but you'd have to be dumb as a box of rocks to believe that i'm not sending no man no money for no holy water the pope ain't got holy water the pentecostals ain't got holy water there's only one real holy water and that's called the holy ghost and i can tell you how to get it tonight but you got to be willing to come god's way now we know when the angel come on there on that water and stirred it the prophet literally says he got in it and left the virtue in there and then when a man stepped in the virtue of that angel from that water went into that person's body and whatever their need was glory to god they was made whole nothing's too hard for god so the angel would come at a certain season now what i want to preach about just for a few minutes tonight bear with me if you would i want to preach on a season of troubling a season of troubling when i read the bible i realized that this bible and nature testifies to it that there are seasons in nature they're seasons in the world we call it winter and winter everything dies that's the season it's death that life leaves them them leaves them limbs and goes down into the root where it stays there until the winter is past then when the season changes which i love spring i love seeing all right now even in my yard i'm starting to watch leaves fall and they're changing colors and we we just people will drive up in the mountains people from our church are going up in the mountain just to watch the changing of the leaf and they don't even realize they love the colors but it's really a sign of death [Music] but then when spring comes around and that life starts coming back up that sap come back up through that tree out into them limbs and then the leaves come out on there again seasons has changed every time a season changes there's a reaction to the changing of the season you can go out here and everything's green or it's springtime so we have winter we have spring and we have summer and we have fall and behind all of that creation is a creator it's all set up until brother branham would go as far as to tell you that nature was god's first bible then we think of the seasons as the prophet would preach it in the spiritual realm like for example justification was one season then as the seasons change we come into sanctification from sanctuary tension we come into the baptism of the holy ghost and from the back back to the holy ghost we come to the holy ghost himself there are seasonal changes and it's all in god's divine timetable nobody can make it happen beforehand nobody can make it be late martin luther came right on the scene at the time god wanted him john wesley came on the scene right at the time god wanted him the pentecostals came on the scene right the time god wanted him and let me just say it you're here tonight right at the time god wanted you you ain't early you ain't late you're here just when god wanted you you know when you saw this message when god wanted you to you know when you got saved when god wanted you to you know when you got the holy ghost what god wanted you to it's all on his divine timetable oh i hope you believe that and again that two spiritual seasons are controlled by god himself who determines the the construction of his own body that's why i tell you mothers don't ever i preach it home don't care where your son is tonight i don't care where your daughter is don't you ever give up on them well you don't know where they're at brother luke they're setting in jail they're over here on drugs my daughter's living in adultery she said i don't care where they're at you keep praying holding your token and one day that season will come and the holy ghost will go and he'll bring that individual and you'll sit back in amazement how did this happen it ain't up to me how it happens as long as it happens amen and god will keep every promise he's ever made to us you believe that do your inheritance believe and thy in thy house shall be saved but it's in god's timing then we think of the natural world and the natural world we come into the world we come in as a child childhood then we come where some of you boys sitting here and different young people tonight teenage years then we come to adults which i'm not saying you're not that but some of us are that and then we come into the elderly time and the elderly time's a wonderful time and that's because you get to go back and be a child again and nobody gets to say nothing about it i told my son i can't wait till i get old instead of us changing your diaper you're going to change my there's nothing you can do about it payback's rough isn't it [Laughter] paul told us when it come to the day of the lord he said but of the times and seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night that time will come when men will not expect it it's a strategic time that is divinely known by god himself until when brother brennam come to the seventh seal and he picked up all the six seven seals in matthew 24 and when he come the seventh seal jesus said no man knows the day of the hour not even the son the father only brother said was written across it was an unknown term that couldn't make it out and brethren said no man knows that day well there's a reason for that god holds that particular season his own power because why if we all knew it if we all knew it exactly the day would come you know what happened to most of us we'd live in the like today's eagle spirit we live in a backseat condition say well he's coming the weekend we got got to get ready but the truth is because we don't know we live every day at could be that day that jesus would return for his bride when they asked our lord jesus about the kingdom you know because they be honest with you disciples sorry i'm trying to get right into my thought but this is important but they asked jesus to this question but you know after his resurrection will you at this time restore the kingdom of israel they were thinking that was the hour that the kingdom would set up he would come in and run the romans out and set the kingdom up and basically the millennial reign but the truth was death never fit into their program of a messiah it just wasn't in their program until even peter could not see it there was no season of death for messiah in their theology until he said not so my lord that'll never happen to thee jesus turned after telling he was blessed and god gave him a revelation who he was in the next sentence a dialogue he turns to peter get behind me satan he said for the things that you savor be of god and not a man in other words you can't stop god's program you just got to get in the broads program you got to accept god's way of doing it and know that somehow it's all going to be worked out according to his perfect will and it was so after his resurrection just before his ascension they asked him will you this time now will you do it now are you going to start the kingdom he says it's not for you to know the times or the seasons but the father has put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and he tells them to go up to jerusalem and wait until they're endued with powerful on high and the season was this a little secret in between the rejection of the messiah and the return of messiah to the 140th a little season there about two days just two days a little season that jesus would construct himself a gentile bride and we're now the finishing up of that gentile bride he's laid the foundation through paul he built it all the way up and here now we've come to the great time of the capping of that great pyramid where christ will come down and become one with his church in the invisible union of the bride of christ aren't you glad to be a part of that god didn't put you down there in the way wide age of ephesus he didn't put you down there in the age of reformation put you right up here at the at the calling out of laodicea hey man that little rim there that little elected group where that headstone would come down and set up on a body amen then resurrect that body and change our body and take us home to glory to three and a half years of a great marriage supper i'm glad tonight by the grace of god to see that and to be a part of that by his grace you know when jesus was here foxes have holes birds have nests but the son of man had no place to lay his head but he came in this day foxes have holes and birds have nests but the son of man now has a place to lay his head and he's laying his head upon his church she's finally been built that when the headstone comes it was rejected when it was the cornerstone but the cornerstone has now become the headstone and that headstone is sitting on a body today and one day will take us home to glory how many believes that now tonight we each are here because we recognize something about god in this day listen close and what we've recognized is he had spiritual food in do season this was the season this message that you and i are loving tonight could not have come in any other age but this age we look back the people that are caught in previous seasons like the lutherans and they're the baptists and they're the nephites and and we sit and we think of them and and in some way look down upon them not really they're caught in the season of another age but their message was good in its season but and we believe that message but we have that plus because the life has moved on and now it's here in the great seed age not even the shock the seed age this is the season of it the ripening age what does that mean that this message arrived in just the right time this was the season for this particular message listen to brother adam for a minute he said let's think of a tree the fall of the year when the autumn time is now we take a leaf i love this you know something about brother brandon the way he talks brother he said let's take a life and here we are if we're born again listen to this we are a leaf off of the tree of life so you think of the natural tree out here i'm not real smart with trees you recognize a few of them i love trees but i i can recognize a few of them saw a tree the other day in clemson south carolina asking elderly man there how long you lived he told me so what kind of dream we talked about that particular tree for probably 50 or 20 minutes just a tree it's incredible to watch god that expresses himself in his nature but brother madam said if we're born again if we're born again we are a leaf on the tree of life now watch and if this tree that we see here in the woods the light finally leaves it pulls away from the leaf because the season is over for the leaf watch it the season is over for the leaf he said then the light leaves the leaf then the leak will drop off and when the light leaves it now we're all real sure that as we look out our windows now that soon as the light leaves the leaf the leaf will drop off and that's the body that we bury now he's calling your body a leaf on the tree of life and what happens when the light leaves you the body drops back in the earth and your light goes down in the root in other words it goes back where it came from then the problem said but the life that was in that leaf goes back where it come from down to the tree into the root and there it remains in the root watch this until another season hey death ain't the end of it the grave is not our end the grave is just a season and when you leave this body glory to god there's a body already waiting on you you step death death christians don't die we just change dwelling places and we go to another body waiting for the season of the earth to change now watch what happens then the prophet says now the sun rocked away from the earth it's falling to orbit as it goes around its way around the cold weather is headed for the earth therefore the root holds the life of the leaf until the earth rocks back around again there's no way to ever hide that leaf from coming back again it'll come back as sure as the sun comes back it'll come back but it has to wait for another season before it comes back and today that gives a great testimony there's a witness of god of creation because that when we are in the season notice this now of mortal life raising children marrying bringing forth families there's a life or the season of mortal life that's what this is but when we have been born from above the body returns back that's where it comes from the spirit goes where it come from or goes up rather where it comes from to god who gave it and there will come another season and that season will come that will come will be what brother being called the immortal season when the son of god rises with healing in his wings it'll be totally impossible to hold these bodies in the ground any longer they'll come forth in the brightness of the son of god and very nature itself testifies to that there's some of you got loved ones laying out here in the grave tonight but there's coming another season one of these glorious mornings they'll come out at ground and god will pick up that leaf let me taste them and he'll change it never to die again given in not only an immortal life but now he'll give it a body that's commended with the light that he's already already got in other words he'll give a body that not just the soul let me tell some folk your soul is just as immortal as it ever will be when you receive the holy ghost and when you leave here you're still immortal but when that resurrection comes there'll come a body up that will match the condition that your soul right now is already in i might as well say your soul is in a season of immortal life we're just waiting on this body to catch up for that same season and it will in god's time now he says so if we're a christian we're born of the spirit death can hold nothing for us but victory he said because this old corruptible body that satan still has power will drop into the dust of the earth somebody told me the day said somebody said if your bride you don't catch covet i said that's so stupid that don't even make a lick of sense if that's the case but none of us should ever get sick brother babe didn't teach in the bible don't teach divine health it teaches divine healing these bodies are subject to sicknesses that's right sicknesses come and sicknesses will go one day a sickness will come and we'll go with it then mortal season will be over but that ain't the end of it this is the wrong season now brother of him says this is mortal season but in mortal season it's coming when the immortal one comes he will bring with him the immortal spirits that return to him from the earth and they will come forth again in the resurrection for the great millennium and shine in his glory listen and the bible tells in the philippines will receive a body like unto his own glorious body in that wonderful bride and groom in the millennium all living and glorified but no wonder satan is bound for a thousand years ain't got nobody to work through not bound by log chain he's bound by a chain of circumstance now this brings me tonight to my thought i want you to imagine being there for a minute i kind of caught the picture in my mind as brother branham describes it literally thousands so many gathered on this porch so many gathered on this porch so many gathered on this porch so many on this porch and so many and as you're still in that porch and looked out over that water body of water all you would see was thousands of sick full infinite folk laying waiting on this season where an angel would come down and stir the water and just hopefully they could get in there for somebody else and it didn't matter what the knee does now some people think it's that superstition but it's not god ain't superstitious god is a reality he is supernatural so the angel come down at a certain season brother bannon today i read him again he said that it would come like maybe a month this is what's amazing is nobody could know when it was going to happen do you realize we could have service after this is one reason that i'm not into all this stuff of trying to manufacture services to run a certain way you're getting this thing where you think everybody's got to shout every service and then when it don't happen look you understand god's a god of variety every service don't have to be shouting sometimes we have servants on wednesday night they shout a bit i sit there and teach the word of god they pray soundly walk out it's just as powerful at that moment it was if somebody was shouting if somebody that y'all god moves different ways it's it's in his seasons the way he wants to do it and it's just as powerful one way as it is another way and the reason i stand on that is because i don't ever want to get to the place that i try to manufacture the moving of the holy ghost y'all hear me say man i don't want to manufacture nothing i just want to wait like you could have a service you know brother man said we don't know if he come but we'll wait on him we don't know but we wait on him that's all in god's sovereignty everything's controlled by him you and i don't tell him what to do so they would sit there and he'd wait and maybe that water brother said start churning you know it's amazing he also said when that water turned it was a dangerous time troubling brother man said dangerous time this is what he also said amazing this is brother branham he said they also said brother in quotes history that some people want to get in there so bad they take a knife and stab another person so they could get in i said man that's desperate that's why i pack a gun i don't know how crazy people are around these churches anymore my deacons pack guns these people are crazy nowadays but you imagine stabbing somebody they're already sick you just made them worse so you could beat them in the water that thicket says one thing anticipation desire to be healed i don't say stab each other but i wouldn't be good brother if we could actually see people beat other people to church that people at our church got upset not long ago y'all know it's true i tell them i don't care somebody said well that's my seat i said well you know i don't i'm not sure but that too right there i don't believe ever been judged about sanctified or baptized with the holy ghost that seat ain't saved so if you come early and you want a certain spot get it when that person arrives and said hey that seat say say well glory god's oh my no such thing as if you want to see get there first wouldn't it be good to see that kind of anticipation i got to get down there and maybe the church is not completely full but you still want to find that particular it'd be good if folk would fight to get in the front row yeah if you were sick and you was around that pool i promise you you fought to get the head to that porch my wife was listening to tape the other day it was shocking about the balcony nobody's up there tonight but you know i don't know exactly if i can remember it right but brother man literally said this he said it's good for your sick vote to get down here close to the pulpit get out of here in the front he said very rarely does the holy spirit ever leave me and go up into the balcony that's what he said that he said sister lisa where are they ever get up here in the balcony but you get down here in other words get under the sprout where the glory's pouring out get close to it so it didn't make a difference and why did them people come in that prayer line and when they got close to the end he said now you feel that you sense his presence in other words you want to get us young people you want to get as close to god as you can good spot to be sitting right there not way back in the corner where you can pull your phone out and check it while the man that god's preaching no you get up front have your bible i don't know i can not see people tap their bibles anymore well that's that's god's word this is the part of your you know your this is your schooling you bring this book when you come to church this is god's word pack it with some people leave their bibles only to save their seats boy and lose the holy spirit when somebody moves their bible save seeds well i can promise you they wanted to get as close as they could to that water i would have if i'd been sick i'd want to get right up there close and keep my eye and don't you do you see something moving and when i've seen that water stern brother i do my best to get in there to let that virtue let me just say it when you see the holy ghost moving that's the time to get in when you see the word of god going out the man of god preaching that's a good time to say amen to the word of god when you feel the sin in the soul comes beside that's a good time lift your head say praise the lord tell them like a bunch of robots no it should be spontaneous it should be in your heart the music is really the bible team it feeds and i gotta heard but in ephesians five you read it it said it didn't say the piano said in your heart making melody to the lord worship isn't here so brother man literally thousands when you look out there you see this great gulf of humanity here's the amazing thing everybody there is in need talk to his lord everybody there you ever come to the house well i don't really need nothing from god you ever think that way you're in trouble every time i come lord i need to get closer to you i need you to crawl me closer if you've got to use the man of god you know as i was thinking today you got a mirror and you got a magnifying glass christians do not carry magnifying glasses you carry mirrors and the mirror is to show you yourself that bible's a mirror people that carry magnifying glass is only trying to check out everybody else's problems but we're here to check out your problem here to check out my problem and the thing is everybody that was at that pool all of them had problems let's say that again all of them now you might be a little secretive and might be a little introvert and you don't want nobody know your problems we know humanity long enough we all got problems one way or another great multitude now here's what i found out brother branham believed and i believe and jesus believed and the bible teaches that a literal angel came down there are men today that want to remove the supernatural so much from the church that they don't even believe that the story of john 5 is literal they believe is an analogy a metaphor or some allegory they have trouble believing that an angel could come down oh they still got trouble today believing an angel could come down but he did something about angels read my bible every one of you tonight you young people you old people like every one of you you know you've got an angel that stands and beholds the face of the father that represents you do you know tonight if you got the holy spirit you literally possess a portion of the angelic beings that rotated off that pillar of fire that resisted satan's lie in the beginning brother man said it let me let angels just satan deceive a third of the anger but there was elect angels that wouldn't believe his lie in heaven and there's elect church that won't believe his eye today because we got a portion of that same spirit that resisted that lie there's a bride here that cannot be deceived we got a holy spirit we're sealed our names as in the last book of life and all these tales that satan is telling not not the t-a-i-l the t-a-l-e the lie that he told there was a bride sealed him with christ we know his voice we came to the sea by the tail that he told because we're a part of the head the ancient honorable here is the head the prophet that teach the lies he is the tale we got a true prophet we got the truth we're identified with the angel of the lord he come down there's angels involved here and angels are involved in the affairs of men until hebrews tells us that they're literally sending the earth to be ministering spirits to those that would be our salvation we have a cloud that they're against today seven angels that make up the face of christ literally they made his wig seven angels that accompanied this prophetic ministry the opening of the seven seals angels came to abraham angels came to gideon angel came to joshua angels were present at jesus's birth angels coming this day angels even rejoice over one sinner amen one center that finds their way back to god angels there was a literal angel there was literal water the water was troubled the waters were moved there was a pool and that pool of water was troubled when the angel come down and if you could get in that water now watch where i'm going if you could get in that water when the angel stirred the water you were made whole of whatever your condition was and if you didn't get in there you stayed in your condition god has a season that he troubles us why does he trouble us is he against us no he loves us and sometimes god has to trouble us so much that brother madam said god loves you so much that he'll put you on your back to get you to look up sometimes people don't retain god in her knowledge and don't mean they mean not to it's just they get so busy and so occupied with everything there is listen young people the devil's going to do his best you make up your mind you probably already done it before i have i'm going to read my bible every day i'm going to pray and i'm going to listen to the prophet that's three things you could do i'll tell you what brother bam said he simplified you want to grow deeper in the love of god pray and read your bible every day i don't want to offend you but you know what brother bam's quote book was the bible this was brother branham's quote book 66 books of the bible that's what this prophet preached out of this message ain't contrary to this bible this bible is the word of god you young people you get in this bible you young men read it every day pray you watch as soon as you say i'm going to pray and read my bible every day watch satan start sending things that try to preoccupy you you'll get more texts than you ever got people like your facebook post you know people live for that say so and so got saved you get one or two likes somebody dress a certain way that they shouldn't be and everybody god's green earth knows about it satan likes that all that negative stuff what you do young people i'm not on facebook what you do is get out of facebook and get your face in this book get as close to the water the moving of it as you can amen do you know god sent an angel among the waters of humanity in this day read what a prophet of god said he said waters represent multitudes of people he said an angel down in this day and troubled the denomination waters a heavenly angel that descended to an earthly angel and his message troubled the systems troubled it so much that they didn't like the trouble that it sent to it and finally ousted the angle out it was too troubling for me but then every now and then there'd be one that would get in one that would get in one that would get in and what god do he was calling them out of it but troubling it that water could have been used for all kinds of things but it was just water why would god trouble it brother bam said he likes to see the reaction of our faith let's look at three things quickly number one whosoever got in was healed of whatsoever this speaks to us something about salvation let me explain to you first of all the bible teaches in hebrews 2 9 that jesus by the grace of god tasted death for every man he died for all humanity let me tell you something there's some people sitting around that water of humanity that you look at them and think there's no way no way god could save them there's a boy worked on i guess y'all won't get offended i ride a motorcycle harley i like i like motorcycles like them so much i got two of them i ride them and i still got the holy ghost and i ride a motorcycle and every now and i take the mountain to this old vet vietnam vet his son's got earrings big holes weird-looking holes and i could just see the devil wrapping that chain and leading him around big holes in his ears one day i you know do everything he can and i in my motorcycle i had one of them cds that you just asked me about was laying in the back of my motorcycle anything about it took my motorcycle down there and in months past maybe several years passed i was going down the highway 11 there coming out of walhalla south carolina there was a tent set up every time i see a t i like it so i just pulled in when i pulled in they were setting up chairs getting ready for service at night and i walked in just kind of sat down was kind of looking around the tent this fella comes up to hey luke i looked at him you know me yeah you don't know me i said no i don't i don't know you who are you he said i'm the one he said well first of all let me tell you this i need to ask your forgiveness i said sir i don't even know you there's no way you could done he said yeah i stole something out of your motorcycle when i was working on it i said no you can't be him and this guy changed and honestly i didn't think in my mind i just thought no way for this dude man he's too far gone tattooed up earrings hanging out smoking one cigarette after another and just never knows good at nice people just never know just a ungodly atmosphere and i never said much to him but he knew as a preacher my sons would go up here take their motorcycles he told me he said i stole that cd out of your motorcycle and i listened to it over and over and over he said god started dealing with me he said i went down there to church and he said i got saved i said man i can tell something's different about you i wanted to say you mean he really could save you but he saved him and he said i want to tell you this your boys came up here to that motorcycle shop and i watched them voice and they were different and every time i'd see them and watch them or something me one craved wish i could be like them i said if you met the same god they did then all you gotta do is be like him but it just shows god can save anybody wasn't on my time had to be on god's time he was different brother no man no man comes in young people nobody ever comes in contact with christ but what they leave different than what they came so he said he takes death for how many men every man it changed my perception that don't judge people no don't put them out right yeah but i've been raising so was i i was born in the hospital on tuesday and by sunday i was under a tent in a little carriage my mom a pentecostal lady took me straight to church been in church my whole life never did a lot of things that they did out here you know as far as the ungodly things but i was just as much as a sinner as everybody else because i found out you don't have to sin to be a sinner you sin because you're already a sinner you come in the world how the matter of fact you was conceived in sin when you come out you come out as a cute little baby with two horns on your head you've got a nature that came from health yeah but i've never cut my you i don't care if you live by your mom and daddy's conviction you got a nature from hell i told my boy didn't that decorate i said if you told all michael saw six of them and now my daughter's different they're lucky she didn't come first because none of them probably would have been here that's a joke you can laugh six sons i said you live in my house you're going to borrow my conviction until you get your own in other words you're going to live by my standards in my house the day you don't like my standards you get out go live make your own standards i never had that problem all good boys can't i can't complain god's been good but my point was this you have to borrow mine because you're in a fallen tradition that's cause they come out of my seed through mama's agony born into a message home that's we all we did was born sinners into our message home they don't come out of marvel's womb christians [Music] just because i dedicated them to christ i dedicated him but they're not dedicated yet they've got to meet christ preach with me now they got to know christ god somewhere in their life has to trouble them the way he troubled you i'm just gonna say it nobody ever repents but what god troubles them and here's what i found out them boys you've never smoked you better not you've never drank nope still a virgin yep ever kissed a girl glory to god keep away from as long as possible once you start it's over come on now it's good they come to order the virgins that's wonderful our girls and boys should be but just because they're clean morally don't mean they're saved they still got a nature that's upheld you say well one day we'll get them no you ain't going to get them right you don't reform young people that nature has got to die and it's got to rot and they got to be born again and they've got to be born to get into the same three elements that they were born naturally water blood and spirit come on now justification of the holy ghost not better again not good again born again for that to happen trouble's got to start for him to be born the first time trouble started i remember i heard it trouble started mama went in the labor pains trouble started woman in tribal remember jesus talked about john 16 travail trouble starts natural birth happens trouble starts spiritual birth happens god has to trouble you young person he will trouble you individually he'll come one day to your life and god will trouble it and there ain't but one answer and that is to repent you've got to repent is that right and god troubles the water you got to get in and only get in is repent but just watch this why does god do that why does sometimes god linger like you know some of us become quick we see a condition in the world it's terrible i mean honestly i've never seen the earth as bad as shape that is in now morally god keeps lingering long suffering why not willing that any man should perish but that all would come to repentance that's god's desire for god so loved the world that he gave his only god son that whosoever that means anybody but the problem is anybody can come but only when god calls several years ago that's where this message come from from let me tell you right now it's where i'm preaching his message from it came back in 2017 i was sitting in my office just booked a trip to south africa i was going to preach in four cities johannesburg over in port elizabeth then up to durban and down to cape town first night was in a little place called port elizabeth my wife come in the room she said look you ever thought about taking jeremiah he's the son before him he's married now got a baby on the way but he was 17 years old remember this list sister lisa she brought him in she come into the office and asked me i said how's mama that boy gonna go with me i said he's a mama's boy i said that kid can't even make a glass of water without asking you to do it and that wasn't a joke that was true and i said no that'll be gone two weeks and i ironed that boy's clothes for two weeks she said i'll teach him to iron i said well go ask him and honestly when she left the room i think the lord jesus let that boy say no that's 2800 dollars she'd come back in a few minutes she said he said he'll go i said mommy you better teach him to iron so i got online i bought him it couldn't believe me it's going i really i really couldn't believe it got online bought him a ticket got him a plane flew about 16 hours got that first night stayed in johannesburg next day we flew over to port elizabeth i was going to preach that night have my message all ready prepared went into the back office sitting there and the message i was going to put you gone and i you know how it is i'm already nervous but then i got real nervous you know how this man don't want to walk out here he must feel like he's got something to control at least what he's going to go what he's going to say and i got down on the pastor's study there and i started praying i said god you got to help me i mean i don't like to go to pool without something burning on me because i believe unction the pulpit brings action in the pews the lord you got to help me and honest to god before god lie not something spoke to me and said open to john 5 and that's where i got this message and i opened the john 5 there and something said to me and i just wrote it down what not in my voice or something in my heart i believe whosoever can come but not whensoever only when god calls and i went out that night and i preached on the sovereignty of god in salvation that god must call you i preached it on there about 30 45 minutes and i heard somebody weeping about four or five rows back sitting where that boy in the blue shirt is jeremiah was sitting there saying oh boy weeping bawling and crying i thought what in the world is going on son you could have did this for the last 17 years in south carolina you coming to south africa for god to deal with you that's where in my mind and be honest he's the only one responding he's weeping and crying and i get to them my message i said is there anybody here that would like to give their is god troubling you is anybody here wanting and his hands went up what in the world and so i just closed the service out we went back to the little apartment we stayed in i went in the living room i had a cover and i covered over my head at the couch and i started praying thanking the lord for the service and those things and i felt somebody come in and sat down it was jeremiah i told him i said what's wrong sonny's tears coming down his face he said daddy tonight i gave my heart to the lord jesus christ i said if i would have said i got a million dollars i'm gonna donate five hundred thousand to church all y'all lord i got tells you somebody got saved i'd be happy somebody got saved rejoicing over one sinner that repents so i said jeremiah you've heard that he preached for 17 years you know what you've got to do when we get home what's gonna he said home i said yeah you gotta get next thing is me what he said baptized i said when we get said daddy i can't wait till i get home i got to be baptized now that's how you knew something happened trump he was troubled and he pretended what's the next thing that when that when god drove the water you had to get in the water so when god traveled he says i got to get in the water you're going to baptize me i baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ these this boy these people tell you god radically changed that voice he met christ and he met him for himself god troubles your water the only thing you can do is repent next thing you do is get in the water let this man of god baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ and when you come out of that water the holy ghost will come in and fill you with the holy ghost and he'll heal you whatsoever your need is he'll take a sin-sick soul and make a son and daughter god out of it come on now is that right take a girl's ill-famed that people thinks well if she wears them certainly this and she does that just get it to christ we're happy they come to church when she's cut her hair well i wonder if she's dressing what's it make a difference she's just being a sinner sinners do what sinners do pigs go to the wall that's their nature don't need to change our outward appearance we need to get into christ and you get into christ he'll take care of the outside we want to get the outside right and the inside ain't right get the inside right and then outside the tree will bear the fruit of the light that's on the outside god trouble us if somebody's not right with god we pray god travel them don't let them sleep trouble like that girl said when they come to jesus i've been troubled in my dreams over this man not trouble them trouble them trouble them trouble their life until they look here and they look there and they can't find they can't find it but there's a thirst there got trouble until they realize what they need is christ still with me no man can come said the bible except the father would send me draw him like a magnet god has to draw you he said when he comes god draws he'll come but that trouble can only be at a certain season now let me hurry what time does that clock say anybody see that i'm getting too old i just turned 52 the other day praise the lord somebody said 52 i said yep man you're over the hill it's a lot better than being under the hill at least i'm still over it i want you to notice he's at this pool quickly now there were five porches i don't think the bible makes mistakes there are five portraits the word veseta means the house of kindness the house of grace all them people in that condition horrible conditions had not yet met christ hadn't gotten the water yet but yet while they were still in there let me just sit like this while you were still a sinner god had you in grace there were five porches five is grace they hung around there when you was a sinner god was watching over you he don't let you go so far you know how many times satan would have snuffed you out but god sent an angel and protected you because he knew your hour was coming you know i ran around with a boy when i was young i ran around with a boy that stole and and i was with him and the things that he did now i'm not going to talk about them they were dark there were things in the world it shouldn't have been done and no though i may have not shoved the stuff in my pants to steal it i ate of it i was just as much a thief as he was and you know at 13 years old in a meeting one night sitting about where you are my brother the spirit of god i didn't know what was happening but something was talking in this little boy's heart and i found my way in order and i repented with godly sorrow and the bible tells ii corinthians 7 that we repent what god has saw that not to be repented of that means i never regretted the day i gave my heart to jesus ain't a person here that's gave their heart to christ but you would you you elders would tell these young people you've never regretted the day that the holy ghost called you and you turned your life to christ no regret 13 years old god dealt with me and i i i i felt i ran around with a cousin of mine we started going different paths i went toward christ and ultimately toward the ministry went full time in the ministry at 17 years old preaching in the pentecostal church and by the time he was 18 he was sitting in a prison house been in the prison house to this day to this day gets out in about 2023 he called me used to call my wife collect i tell her talk to him when he calls we used to send him money and he told me one day on the phone when i was talking to him he said good to god i had parents like yours that whipped you when we did things wrong he said when we did things wrong and our parents found out you got the whooping i went home and my daddy only said boys will be boys he said my life has been spent in prison your life has been spent down there in church god brings you different ways say oh i'm not like him yes i was i was just like him but god stopped me i'd go so far and i'd feel that thing just pulled me back [Music] and going so far feeling pretty god not even born in him i just feel that thing pull me back let it go so far what was it the tender hand of god watching over your life even while you were yet sinners listen while you were exit it don't say why you dead center god died for the godly while you were yet sinners christ died for the ungodly we were sinners come out of the womb of a holy ghost woman daddy was a preacher but we were still sinners y'all still with me that's right finally one day god come to trouble my waters i've never regretted the day but he troubled me troubled me enough to make me look to him think about this titus 2 3 46 the love of god our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteous we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration renewing of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through our lord jesus christ and in our texture but god who is rich in mercy and i found out one day mercy is god withholding from me what i do deserve and grace is god extending to me what i don't deserve the prophet of god said say what you want to i heard a man today a lot of brides not sinners that's a lie care if you are a bride you were a sinner we're not better than them the only difference between us and those that don't know christ is the grace of god no man will grab another more don't care who he is and take him in the bottom pointed finger at him we can't condemn nobody but for the grace of god there go out now let me tell you what brother bam said i'm gonna bring this a little bit a little bit more just for a second it's too much here but he says this all that water was troubled this one would get in and all of a sudden the scripture says and there laid a man in a condition for 38 years can you imagine laying by a pool knowing that water was troubled and you're in a condition for 38 years and you get there and you're trying to work your way through the crowd and you're trying to get up as close as you can this one beat you there and all of a sudden you know what you're going to take up and another man pushes you back he jumps in and jesus comes walking let me tell you what's happening this time he don't have to get in the water the water is coming to him [Applause] the water's coming to him you see i can't do it i can't make it i can't no we can't but he can look young people you don't have to get right to get right you just come the way you are and he'll make you right i can't get in no man to help me you go back to the previous chapter chapter four water comes up again and a woman who had been had five husbands the one she lived with now wasn't her own and y'all could say what you want to you'd have a hard time believing if that woman was in this church married five times come in here at six and was looking for another one no way she could be bribed what constitutes bride past conditions no what constitutes bride is when the holy spirit comes he calls that individual hey and wipes away all their sins don't care what they've done what they've done where they've been when the grace of god comes in there they're just as clean as anybody else if a body-paired woman come here tonight if god saved her night her hair is just as long as yours that never cut it in the presence of god i just don't think we have a reality of what grace is i'm talking i'm not talking about this great i'm talking about real grace jesus come walking up there guess where he went he came over here and he sat down on a well and she came out to draw water but she was fixing to draw from a different water and it was called the water of life woman if you knew who it was talk to you he said you'd ask me for a drink and i'll give you a drink that you'll never thirst again hey he's still at water tonight i can't get in i've tried i've tried i tried yeah you tried let him take over let him take over he's come tonight maybe tonight you can't get them but the water is coming to you maybe this meeting the spirit of god's coming to you he's coming to you in this meeting all these you said this is going to be a different meeting for you god's coming to you and all you've got to do is say here i am lord here i am do what you want with me here i am i surrender everything i am to you [Music] let me let me give you one more those porches represented water represents humanity and then portraits were actually god's mercy over top of the water they they they're waiting on and it didn't it kept them from drowning let me put it that way that's why brother said it could have been dangerous but then portraits were god's grace to them while you was a sinner something was watching over you somebody might have pulled a knife on you one day somebody may be determined to shoot you you don't know satan thought i'll take him out in this car wreck somehow the hand of god kept you while you was a sinner let me let me say this to you i got to go everybody there had the same problem universal problem they were all were inflicted i know i'm driving the point home but i have to i've done it i'm gonna say this maybe somebody wouldn't understand several years back about oh it had to be before 2008 probably 2004 some of that area all them young kids i talked about that came years ago or in our church we had about 50 of them i think and i started praying so along the lines i am brother brad asking god to give these young people an experience with him i wanted him to receive the holy ghost you know my old days brother all i knew was to seek the lord and i got a couple of gallons of water my wife can tell you i hooked up my camper and i got my truck and i drove up into beckley west virginia and i rented a little campground there i said i'm gonna go fast and pray for three days i'm just gonna drink water for three days and ask god to do something for these young people you know i was up for three days when the third day within the fourth day the morning of it i nothing happened no voices just prayed read my bible listen to brother branham that's about it headed back down out the mountains got down into charlotte north carolina i said lord these young people need a revival something spoke to my heart and said well let's start with you so what about me lord and that's what he said do you remember brother in that truck i was troubled he said do you remember he took me back to a temp meeting i was in and i met a minister who was i don't even talk about it but he left his wife and was living with another woman and church was all broke up they introduced me to him and he made a little remark at me when did i smarted him off i was about 21 years old 22. do you know what i said to that man troubled me for years i'd be down and pray and that little thing would come up and i'd just kind of push it away and keep going but see the day come when i got desperate needed god do something and that little thing kept coming up he said let's start with you and i said lord what do you want me to do he said you'll do anything i tell you anything you tell me he said you call that man apologize for what you said so i got on the phone i started calling this person can you get his number you called can you get in the finance got his sister and his sister gave me his number and i called him up i'll tell you my conversation in the truck a conversation was lord yes i said that but he was a soul something spoke back and said not another but something in my heart said yeah but you wasn't a david i said all right lord i called him up got him on the phone and i said brother you're probably not going to remember me it's been too many years he said what's your name i told him i said i met you one night at tempe and he goes oh i remember you i said yeah and i said something to you that night outside that tent that i had no business talking to you that way as an elder i didn't care if i disagreed or you were wrong or right or whatever it was not on me to say what i said to you and the holy spirit has had me to call you to tell you that i'm sorry for what i said i should have never spoke those words and brother you know what he said son you were forgiven don't you ever worry about it again and when he said it was like something went off of me and i felt so free i got back and started preaching on the holy ghost and being born again to our young people my wife can tell you these these here probably would never some of them weren't even born the holy ghost started coming to the meetings and we literally some nights was in there till midnight asked my wife and we had to carry some of the young people to the cars to get them home they were getting so drunk on the holy spirit but it started right there i had god had to trouble me and i had to face what i had to face and you said you didn't go no water no but i got washed by the washing of water by the word that cleansed me and appeared cleaned this up when he cleaned this up it gave god a chance to work and we baptized over 40 young people in several months right and and to this day as far as i know most of them are baptized maybe a couple the majority now are married got children and they're serving the lord and i'm going to tell you something what he did for them what he did for me and what he did for your mother and what he did for your father what he did for this preacher he can do the same thing for you because we all have the same universal problem we were born in sin shape iniquity coming the world speaking lies all have sinned and come short of the glory of god you say but there's just an unpredictable passing yes there is but i say tonight pass me not old gentle savior hear my humble cry wild on others our calling do not ask me by would you bow your head just a minute just a moment if you would brother said don't let satan deceive you he said one time he said you know i would serve the lord at a young age but there was a spirit that hung over me and kept saying just wait this way just wait you might not be in the condition the woman wasn't john 4 i don't know you made me one of the ones that laid at the porch and you can't get in you need help well he's here to help you i'm telling you his presence is here tonight to help you if you go from john 4 to john 5 you get to john 6 then the bible said jesus come and took him on the other side of the water tonight he can take you on the other side he's here to do that i won't hold you much longer but if you're here maybe maybe you're not a sinner maybe there's some things in your life that just have a hard time letting go but in his presence you're willing to say lord i'll i'll go with you i'll go all the way would you lift your hand up right where you are just now god bless you these hands god bless you young people god bless you i'm not here to embarrass nobody in no way shape or form but i'm telling you god can help you tonight care where you're at what you've done okay what's in your life there's a god tonight that can supernaturally change any situation [Music] father [Music] i just feel your presence in my heart tonight lord take this little message oh god you've let it penetrate our hearts there's some tonight lord feel that they just need help they just it's like they just can't get over it but lord your prophet said there were thousands there that day and he went by thousands just to get to one then after he touched that one he walked on tonight lord there's millions in the world and yet father you went by millions just to get to us what what tremendous grace that is lord you see the hands that's one up in this place you see the young people that's got their hands up now i wonder tonight this isn't invading we can just put both hands up that's just what that means is i surrender i wonder if my brother could just sing that little song there lord i surrender maybe you're here tonight and you just need him and he's passing by now don't you let him help you i want you to just draw virtue off of him while he's here won't you just pull the strip and say lord here i am i surrender all to you while your hands are up just love him just let god work in your life while he's singing it i always tell people the orders are open if you'd like to come and pray you don't come you just say well i might go they'll think i'm a sinner no it's kind of good being a sinner sometimes christians just come and pray
