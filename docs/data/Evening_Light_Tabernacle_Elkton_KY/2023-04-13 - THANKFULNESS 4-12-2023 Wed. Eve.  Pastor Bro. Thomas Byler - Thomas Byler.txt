brother Brian's back there too we're glad to see him aren't we hey man let's give the Lord a hand praise the Lord amen thank you that's right amen that's right let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you father tonight grateful once again Lord to come into your house father Lord and we just ask God that you'd come and space away father and just Lord Lord do what you always do father just have your way Lord and help us to get out of the way father that you might Lord bless us with your presence Lord Jesus with the words that you want us to speak and and do the words that you want the audience to hear that would bless them Lord Jesus and benefit them and we ask Lord Jesus help me to get out of the way and Lord father is I feel you've let me in this direction we ask God that your divine inspiration would come in a special way and and just annoying this to be able to minister your word father under the anointing of the Holy Spirit we love you Lord Jesus we want to thank you for all you goodness now Lord as we take another thought from our series Lord we ask God your blessing upon it in Jesus name amen remember brother Daniel tomorrow night are you going to be on tomorrow night and then brother Brad will be ministering coming Sunday amen to take the Sunday service amen turn your bibles if you will we'll just get right into the word amen let's go to Book of Revelations amen I've dressed down a little bit and I hope nobody Minds amen I just don't doesn't quite feel right but it feels good amen so amen I said I'm just going to dress down I says no maybe I'll wrote and I said no go ahead I felt like the Lord give me the go ahead so anyway praise the Lord let's go to Revelations the seventh chapter revelation 7. amen and we'll begin with ah verse 9 and after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all Nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb both with their white robes and Palms in their hands amen and cried with Allah to our god which sayeth upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the Angels round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts fell down before the throne on their faces and worshiped God saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving and honor and glory and might be unto our God forever and ever a man amen now I'm if I'm not wrong this was uh the Jews that I believe brother bam call this that this was the Jews and so forth I know that the different times that this is spoken and it's different groups of people amen but and I don't know for sure about some of the ones that we read over around the fourth chapter uh you know just what which group it was but I do know that it's the same Angels amen same elders and amen saying the same thing amen so this is what's going on in heaven now the question tonight is which one of these words amen are we going to go with and I think the one that I haven't really covered and I really wanted to I was leaning towards the glory of Victory and overcoming amen that's kind of what I was studying on until it just kind of changed a little bit amen and it went to uh uh not from that from the glory of Victory Amen to Thanksgiving amen Thanksgiving amen now notice that they worship God saying that all of these words and including Thanksgiving then I will jump down to be unto our God forever and ever amen make this blessings to reading of the words you can be seated now Sunday we spoke on Amen riches didn't we amen riches amen that he's worthy of riches we talk about what riches are the only thing that you can take with you that's truly rich is your character the kind of person that you are amen your personality we might call it in that you're the kind of person that you are your character and so forth It's the only one only thing we can take amen and that character is made by sufferings by trials by tests by chastisements amen and all these different things and all the trials that come our way amen are to mold us into the character of Jesus Christ and that is the gold and end that is uh accepted by God and that's the goal that God was looking for was the character that is made out of pure suffering amen and a lot of times we suffer and we've seen where Peter said amen that if you are suffer wrongfully that's when you really get a blessing for not if you suffer rightfully but if you suffer wrongfully that's where the real that's what God has said ordained us to do amen because that's when we truly find out what kind of person we are amen so praise the Lord but tonight amen I wonder with the help of the Lord going over and thinking about this word Thanksgiving amen Thanksgiving so we see here that um Thanksgiving and it led me to several different words amen and uh before I get into that I want to I want to just say a few words perhaps um if I could off of the subject kind of but we're talking I was thinking about uh what the prophet of God said about us staying in Revival amen I remember you know as you said that we're to stay in Revival amen and I've made the comment that I don't guess you'll find anywhere amen and so but how that we shouldn't need Revival amen you know so I think another word for staying in Revival would be or stay revived would that be okay stay revived amen stay in there amen or as we might put it in another words uh Jesus said be hot amen and stay hot and if there's any direction that I want to take us into the church is to get hot for God and to stay hot for God and how do we do that and I got to thinking how do you stay hot how do you stay how do you stay revived and you know I thought about it and I thought about how that uh whether it was Muhammad Ali whether it was Mike Tyson or whether it's any fighter that becomes Great and Powerful and uh knocks out the enemy and there's a there they hold the world title they're Victorious they're uh on top of their uh name so to speak you know and they're right up there you know but you know what they have to do is they have to keep exercise don't they they can't let up and start eating too much and not exercising every day the Bible talks about how that we have to exercise our faith we got to exercise all these different things in order to do it another place the Bible talks about trimming your lamps trim your Wicks isn't that right you gotta keep keep your wing quick trim and Brother Band says you know just like your natural body if you don't eat naturally you're gonna die he says that same type goes with your spiritual body that if you don't eat spiritually you're gonna get cold on God you're gonna get away from the spirit amen and before you know you've got calluses you've got all kinds of moss back you've got it all kinds of things that come in if you don't stay Sharp Amen to that man ever that's up and then you know a lot of times it's because of old age or because you're getting weaker somebody comes and beats that guy don't he amen because that's humanly that's natural but let me say this let me bleed from the bride of Christ we wouldn't be the kind of people that doesn't get older and weak in our in our faith in God we want to have to stay strong in order to say victorious amen so I thought that's right that's how we stay in Revival amen I hate to say it but you really need to pray like Daniel then you pray in the morning you pray at noon time you pray in the evening you feed on God amen and Daniel say in Revival you can keep power keep the power of the Holy Ghost let me tell you that's how you keep your house clean that's how you keep amen your sharp sword and keep the devil away and keep the right attitude keep the right spirit but you get away from that and all kinds of things come in God bless you good to see y'all amen so praise the Lord amen I thought about that that's how we do it stay in Revival God wants us hot amen can't be lazy but you gotta keep feeding yourself keep feeding amen otherwise amen it goes the other way and the enemy comes in and robs you of your blessing amen so we think about let's think about this first of all amen I want to say this that first of all amen before you can be thankful now God is worthy of a lot of thanks isn't he sure he is he's worth of all thanks praise the Lord we're thankful that we can amen give God the glory that is to him all right amen my ran out of paper so I'm looking for my paper but I wrote it on the back side for once I use back by being conservative here all right not really but anyway all right let's look at this so we got here amen first of all I believe it's in uh uh let's go to Philippians Philippians and first we'll go to first Thessalonians first Thessalonians if you want let's see what the scripture says about thankfulness amen praise the Lord and I want to say that this thankfulness I believe is also a part of the character of the bride of Christ amen it's part of our makeup just like giving God glory and worshiping God it's all part of us amen amen and being thankful amen uh an attitude of gratitude now tonight's service amen I've wrote down here that is really a remembering service it's something that I've spoke on many times but I you know maybe we need to just have our minds stirred up by the way of remembrance amen be forgetful sometime amen all right if you talk about this so and I noticed in uh Thessalon first Thessalonians the fifth chapter in verse 16 says Rejoice Evermore does that mean forever I mean always rejoicing I'm rejoicing night and days that'd be all right rejoice Rejoice rejoice and again I say rejoice rejoice in the Lord oh if it just comes to mind is that all right and again I say rejoice how many believe you need to rejoice many times over in the Book of Revelations we can say rejoice you his Saints amen praise the Lord we're practicing aren't we not just practicing but actually doing what we are what we're going to do over there pray without ceasing and in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you amen if you really want to know more about it go back over into and look uh David one place he says I will wake up at midnight and give thanks to the Lord hey man he wakes up at 12 o'clock thank you Jesus [Music] because he's worthy of things isn't he he's worthy of being appreciated and I'll tell you what this to being the thing of being thankful a lot of time amen it means sometimes that we have to take inventory we have to look back at what we can be thankful for because I'll tell you right now this generation of people is the most unthankful people that I know of my my and I won't go too much into it but I believe it's in Roman the second chapter it talks about homosexuality it knows whenever it was over into there he says they didn't retain God in their knowledge and neither were they thankful they become unthankful and then off they went you have to be thankful amen and my do we have a lot to be thankful for all right don't we amen in rev I'll just read one Psalms 105 verse 1 it says oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk ye of all of his wondrous works praise be to God Amen amen let's think about it we've got to take inventory see what we have to be thankful for amen and first of all I want to say why don't we talk about several different things first of all we realize that a person that is thankful is usually a person that's satisfied is that right it is a person that's content satisfaction and contentment amen it's two words let me tell you it's two words in other words I want to put in there amen and then a contented person is happy happy a contented person is a happy person [Music] whoa oh my ah all right a bunch of thoughts going through my head I'll go ahead and share it with you all right I was at home studying this and my thumb was hurting and this stuff that just wants to hang on to me and I was kind of you know just kind of wowzy wowzy woo and I said how am I gonna preach this you know I don't feel all that happy I don't feel all that but you know my time I got here I got out here the Lord just knowing hello we don't always feel like it doesn't matter we still preach the word isn't that right amen so that's what I was thinking I was debating on whether I want to tell you that or not but amen we don't always feel like it but we we got to be happy for the Lord and be thankful amen so a contented person amen contented I like that not just content but satisfied A Satisfied person in what I was doing where I was going with that is those three words amen satisfied contentment and happy those three and joy and having Joy how many knows that that's truly what what the whole world is looking for the whole world out there is thirsting for satisfaction ain't nobody but what likes to be satisfied because if you're not satisfied you're a miserable person amen I was thinking the other day you know I want to make sure my wife is happy because if my wife's happy happy wife happy life is that right and if she's in a better half so to speak you know you got to make sure she's happy you know I thought you got to do a better job amen praise the Lord all right so we think about this let's look at another verse here now um Paul let's think about this let's just read it first of all let's read the quote First only quote I got I've used this before identified with Christ in 59 he better bam says you know he wanted to take a tax but he says you know there is this country today so many this satisfied people and it's amazing when you get around to find out so much this satisfaction oh my now notice he says uh talking about people blowing their brains out this out of the other but I call them unhappy unhappy people folks and I'll tell you what if anybody that goes to a garage closes their garage up and and and closes the windows of the car I'll put a hose from the gas from the tailpipe into the car and you have got to be seriously unhappy you kill yourself huh or a gun to you you have got to be the whole world is unhappy people are unhappy people dissatisfied they're not content amen and therefore certainly not thankful but the more happy you are the more content you are you can't be that way without being thankful they'll just tell you can you imagine the immigrants right now that have to go from Guatemala they come from El Salvador to come from Haiti and they have to swim across the that Big River to uh Rio Grande or whatever it is and a lot of them drowned and all this other stuff that goes on I want to get into the country and if they ever make it through that wall if they ever get on the other side they've made some happy people don't you reckon opportunity [Music] can you imagine the joy the happiness they can have just to be in this country now I thought you know when we started looking at our blessings look at the blessing not only are we you know we're not just immigrants but you and I are citizens I don't have to worry about getting towed back out I'm a citizen are you a citizen not you can be happier than he is he's illegal they've got so much to be happy for I got to thinking you know I get to jump in my truck and I get to put it in gear I used to have to go and I had to get the horse out of the song I had to put the harness on I had to do this go down the road real slow like if you go somewhere it's a half a day to go about a mile and a half and back all right is that right but that's to be happy about now that's just natural things what about the spiritual things face be to God God wants his children happy my oh my God said in Isaiah listen everyone that thirsts has Come Ye to the waters and he that has no money come by eat yeah come buy wine and milk without money without price why do you spend money for that which is not bread and you labor for that which satisfies not how many know well I'll tell you what I gotta become a billionaire I gotta become a millionaire I gotta have some money's money and I'll be happy no they're never happy they're never content they're never satisfied amen I got to thinking you know some people let me tell you something amen your wife will never satisfy you a new job won't satisfy you more money won't satisfy you this church won't satisfy you no church will satisfy you you why won't none of them will but let me tell you something you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and you'll be So Satisfied that you're what you're happy with your wife you're satisfied with your husband you're satisfied with your church you're satisfied with your neighbors you're satisfied with your boss you're just satisfied but he takes the satisfaction in here if you don't get satisfaction in here you'll always be empty you'll always be in need come on y'all can get up if you feel like it stand up Shout Whatever praise the Lord oh my I'm satisfied you know why I'm satisfied you know why I'm content because I believe that a person can walk with God every day you can live a Victorious Life every day but you got to stay on your toes you got to stay prayed up Don't Let The Devil come in there somehow he'll try anyway to come in there and to rob you of your joy he'll rob you of your smile he'll rob you of your happiness if you possibly can in any way that he can amen okay praise the Lord Paul said in first Timothy 6 and verse 6. godliness with contentment is Great Gate praise the Lord Glory if you've got the Holy Ghost if you got his righteousness on the inside if you've got that godliness and you're content with that that is priceless that is great gain because he was talking about people that man disputing perverse disputings of men with corrupt Minds destitute the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw yourself amen you need to make all the money you want to ain't gonna give you no happiness it most likely get you more sorrow more headaches more troubles amen but aren't you glad aren't we glad tonight there's a water that we can drink and it ain't no water H2O amen we can eat a steak but it's not that kind of steak it is a spiritual snake a man that absolutely satisfies I'm satisfied without the cottage pillow maybe a little silver and a little gold I ain't got gonna have nothing just as long as you got the Holy Ghost can be as satisfied human be there ain't nothing better I like to get around satisfied people don't you like to be around somebody that's satisfied man you can just sit under evergreen tree for a million years that's what we're gonna do when we get to heaven let's just sit under every Green Tree and just enjoy this just enjoy this oh Mike just comes to mind you know why sometimes a lot of times we get it off the track we get unhappy because we do like Eve did Eve was in perfection how could it be any better than what he had it but Eve wasn't satisfied was she she thought there was something else that may be a little better why can't us humans leave good enough alone man if something's working don't fix it if God's blessing you don't fix that it's fixed already because I guarantee you get your hands in it and it's going to get messed up isn't that right brother bam said that about the Pentecostals he said about those other ages especially the Pentecostals he said this should have kept going to what it was Mr Susan Street the God was blessing and he was had them all unified but no he said man I have to get their dirty hands into it they had to have something into it something they had to do in it he says and he messed everything up isn't that what Nathan did everything was going good and God was blessing but they had an idea you know you're not the only Holy One he tried to have something to do into it amen whenever God's blessing you and you're happy in the Lord stay that way because I'm telling you if you get yourself that's why we have to Die daily because that self always wants to eject itself let me eject this and this is that way this is a no no that's blessing it just hold on to a very very steady right there stay right there with it amen because you can do serious chaos if you get man and yourself into it amen praise the Lord all right let us be glad how many believe God wants you to be glad let us be glad Revelation says let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come I believe we can be what glad we can be happy well I'm happy in the Lord anyway and it really doesn't matter what come my way today I'm gonna wear a smile hold my head up high and say I'm happy in the Lord anyway every day I just one day but every day not just Sunday or Wednesday but every day is sweeter than the day before amen listen look with godliness is great game for we brought nothing into this world and it's certain that we will carry nothing out and having food and Raymond let us be there with happy thankful content everybody got food everybody got water and clothes [Music] everybody can dance Paul didn't even have that he said Timothy I'm getting cold can you go get my clothes can you go get my coat he was in prison in shackles and everything else he said man you know if you have food in Raymond you ought to be a happy Christian they're not gonna carry none of that with them you're not going to carry anything with you except for your character and what you got already inside of there so you can be happy because of what you have how many is with me you can be happy and content because of what you have in here one more scripture and I quote them close sometime after that all right Philippians 4 and verse 11 Paul says for I speak in respect of one for I have learned in whatsoever State I am there with to be content wow now I'm sure Paul was talking about the situation and that God allowed him to get into now folks when I get myself into trouble and I know I've done wrong and I'm not where I'm supposed to be I get very very discontented I'm not happy there I'm not going to stay content in that state but when God allows you to get in bad places remember we're talking about suffering he says you know whenever you suffer you're called to suffer you're going to go suffering's gonna happen so that you'll learn to get on your knees and rely on God and it talk to God about it let him handle that amen that's what it's for and he said you know we've got the God wants you to conduct yourself with joy in the midst of the trials that God allows what I gotta be happy in the middle of my trial really that's what he said all this Paul was always happy he was always content whatever state he was in you don't believe me I know how to be a beast and I know how to abound everywhere in all things I am in destruction both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ with strength of me amen isn't that something how Paul could say something good after all that something positive amen don't you like a preacher that lifts you up a preacher that encourages you because that's the word of God isn't that right the word of God encourages you oh you're not going to have a flowery bed of these anybody that thinks this life is the flower bed of ease amen no it's not never meant to be but the one that helps you go through it is in here one that takes care of it all you know what I was about to say I understand why people shoot theirselves because that's about what I'd want to do if I wouldn't have God I'd want to shoot myself because it would be so miserable then that's why they do is because they don't have a God no hope without hope without God and turmoil and hell on Earth so to speak and it just ended because that's like without God what would you do now you need to understand what brother bam says isn't it a wonderful thing to be a Christian thank you Lord thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord I wasn't whole but now I'm whole amen I wasn't complete I was empty I was worried I was darkness in there but for making me whole I thank you Lord thank you thank you Lord for saving me amen praise the Lord give thanks We're The Grateful heart give thanks to the Holy One give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ his son and now let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich because of What the Lord Has Done give thanks I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me amen think about it how many knows that a Christian is a thankful person it's part of the atmosphere that a person creates that other people want to be around I believe that don't you like to be around a person that has a smile on their face if they got a frown I believe I'm just going to go out that door this time huh the people you love to be around people that you don't really want to be around ah you need to go try to cheer them up yes but still Christians are they have a smile on their face they're to be happy be glad rejoice amen go to work for McDonald's go to Dairy Queen they aren't that way anymore I guess but used to they'd say now look when they come through the line you gotta go hi good morning how are you I don't care how terrible you feel how much you don't want to be there how much you hate the job how much you just man can't say that you better have a smile and be friendly huh well God wants his children to be happy to amen but not because you put it on but genuinely how many knows you're the salt of the earth amen let's not lose our saltiness Eve was not content in the state she was Nathan was not content in the state she was Pentecost in the Souza Street were not content in the state they were let me tell you something if you're not content with the message of the hour that God has sent there ain't no contending you amen there's no content Beyond Christ what he has done in our age I'm content the good the bad the everything that all the bad that's around the message and so forth that just goes with it amen be nice if it was all perfect but it's not amen no there's all kinds of things and think about it now let me go back a little bit you know because we can go on down the line of how good God has been I thank you Lord for a nice place to worship don't you I'm glad that the pews aren't all empty and I'm talking to that clock back there I thank God I'm thankful for every one of you amen but more than anything I am thankful for Christ and what he did for me on Calvary that's what he does every for me thankfully every Redeemer that is my God he's my leader he's my sustainer when I fall he picks me up how many believe that when I get sick please by either will I get depressed he's my lifter up of my soul oh my so much to be thankful for amen listen God says about this layout I see a age that they are wretched amen wretched miserable like I said earlier if you ain't got that contentment in your heart you're miserable they're out there think about the whole world's out there trying to get that contentment they're trying to get that happiness just trying to get that peace you're trying to get that Joy they want to that ain't a soul that I know if they don't want to be happy I don't want to have that on the inside but aren't they looking for it all in the wrong places amen hopefully nobody knows this song I maybe shouldn't mention it but Neil Kenny Rogers one of them he says they're looking for love in all the wrong places they're looking for happiness in all the wrong places isn't that right they're looking trying to quench their thirst in all the wrong places amen oh if I can just get a preacher that is a preacher the way you ought to be a future and so forth and I'll be happy no you won't huh no I'll just go to this church here evening light Tabernacle I'll be happy no ain't gonna give you happiness must go much deeper than that you've got to get into Christ pray the Lord aren't you glad there's a place that you can go where you are happy I'm content I'm happy where I am that's in Christ amen I thank the Lord it's like that rabbit where the hounds of hell are after it and it's dodging it that dog is running like crazy and that rabbit had to do a sharp cheek to the right and the dog can't turn that fast and it gives that rabbit just a little more Advantage all of the quickness of that rabbit is keeping the dog back but he's got to get to that rock power there's a hole where he can get down to that rock pile and my idea says he goes down the street stretch he looks back he sees that dog gaining on him amen he's only gonna have a split second and then he dives into that hole and the dog dies into that hole he gets his face stuck and wow hurts him a little bit because he don't mean there too hard that little rabbit he could just say thank you Lord for saving me thank you Lord for setting me free he'll never get through that rock I am in the cleft of the rock I'm hiding in the craft of The Rock that devil that wants to do this to me and make me feel bad and all of this he can't touch me because I'm gonna clap of The Rock I'm praising God I'm thanking God every time that Paul David talked about amen thanking God he also said praise be to God thanking God and praising God and worshiping God amen praise the Lord rehash rehash not rehash but re-say no wife no children no family no amount of money no matter popularity or fame will ever satisfy you but if you get the Holy Ghost you'll be happy with your wife husband whatever whoever State you are you'll be satisfied you'll be like Paul not always easy huh take a couple little minutes and take a couple more minutes let's go back to Israel and that's something how God made the way he brings a man in there a one man and he conquers pharaoh huh the word spreads through all of Israel that Moses there's a man that's confronted uh pharaoh and he told him to let my people go that the I am said let my people go don't you know all of Israel the two million people that was a rumor they all heard about this they said what can you imagine all the doubters and the Skeptics oh that'll never happen ain't no way ain't no way but guess what fleas and flies and frogs and blood and water and oh my is that right even the death angel coming down until one day there was a news proclaimed he says Pharaoh said get your stuff and let's go their eyes are like wow sorry they all triumphantly marched out of there God one man took it and made that whole Army made that man into so powerful turned his mind and let him go they all marched out there praise be to God how did you believe had a good time Revival shouting and so forth and then let them all the way right down to the Red Sea huh right down to the Red Sea I love the Red Sea story come down there and guess what God wanted to see what kind of a character they had what kind of people are these huh and maybe it was Joshua maybe it was Caleb they were all starting to Grumble and complain oh look what you do look we're in the Trap and you know what did you do bring us out here before I said hi I can hear Joshua can't obtained hey at least we ain't an age thank the Lord boy I'll tell you what all of the angels and God himself would have got off his throne and did a jig perhaps if he'd heard all of them say the same thing at least we ain't in Egypt we know that God that brought us out of here will take care of us now God was looking for a people that are thankful be thankful in everything and give thanks I don't care what it is give thanks in all things give thanks even the hard times wow so

tonight God has brought us safe this far God will take us through folks Let Me Be Happy Let Me Be Happy all right listen now the Christian's trial is a blessed thing and his attitude one of Joy whereas this description is phrased as wretched and miserable the laodice trial how strange in this age of Plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance How can there be trials or should I say anybody unhappy I'm gonna let that sink in a little bit we got more stuff we got I don't care what you want to eat I don't care if you're a health food fanatic and you want to go to only a certain herbal they've got stores for that they've got stores for everything and anything we are the most uh Rich the most scientifically advanced civilization since the time Noah but in this age of Plenty and opportunity when everybody has so much and there is so much more to be had when our with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure all right all of these inventions think about it give us pressure or should I say to make you happy you ain't gotta go get the hot water you ain't got to get a washing machine and go over a scrub board all you gotta do is soda clothes in there put a little bleach or whatever in there and push the button nice happy you ought to be happy is that right you ain't got to go get firewood that's the Amish do and go out there and get that fire going you know first in the hot summer if you're going to cook you got to make a fire of some kind of course they got little coal oils and burners nowadays you know but just to turn the stove on and put the frying pan on and you ain't got to scrub anymore they make non-stick pets we got so much say we ought to be happy about all these inventions all right to give us pleasure he says now listen when everybody ought to be happy everybody ought to be happy but we find out a lot do the things don't bring you happy let's do that never enough how many knows that whenever you ain't got the Holy Ghost nothing is ever enough nothing ever is good enough you will always complain you will always be dissatisfied unless you got the total satisfaction right in here doesn't matter if you don't have anything I thought about that black man I forget his name now the one that I guess was the leader of the Zuzu Street and how that he couldn't even go into the church where this man was preaching and had a really wonderful preaching he had to sit on the back steps back there by the door and put his ear up there but he never complained he was happy I get to hear it oh can you imagine today wow people wouldn't be that happy with they not that content just to be able to hear the word of God Lord help us amen everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about amen and yet people are more unhappy than ever more empty more dissatisfied than ever one tattoo is Never Enough one earring is Never Enough we got to do the nose we gotta do something else and something else why do you think they look so hideous out there huh well I'm here to tell you it is more and more now that you see two women together and two men together more and more Right Here Local is that right it's getting worse and worse why because they never quenched that thirst they never get satisfied and they're never thankful for what they have amen think about message people message people people that claim to be in the message I don't care if you go to Donna Reagan's right the business goes well people are there's so many people I know because I hear a little bit down in Florida and then so forth people in big churches and so forth and discontent unhappy people that there is just because you're in a message search don't mean you're a happy person don't mean you're a Content person don't mean nothing absolutely nothing the only thing that means something is is the holy ghost in your heart is Christ in there I'm not here to bring you to this church I'm here to bring you to Jesus Christ let it be in your heart 24 7 100 stay strong in here in him you'll be content and if you're content with what you have God will give you more he'll give you more God is always he's always blessing with more doesn't he yeah if you're a Christian don't worry about getting more God's always going to give you more he just does at least that's my experience if anything you got to push it away say God I don't want that responsibility I don't want that much huh sure He blesses us he says but when you're full now don't forget me amen he's none of your fat don't forget me I got to thinking about it the land we live in what we have what I have Lord help me to be satisfied with what God has given me satisfied and I am not I'm not talking natural I'm talking about spiritually I'm happy because why because I have him I know he's my guide if he's your guide you're happy all right now notice it boasts this generation boasts of all of its great achievements but it can't back it up it cries peace and there is no peace he cries that it has a great amplitude of things but it keeps burning with desire is that right I want I want I want I want I want the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen I shall not need I have him people are always burning with want and one Lord help us isn't that right burning with a desire like an unsatisfied fire but he says there is no peace saith my God unto the people that are not filled with the Holy Ghost the wicked I mean please anybody that's not filled with the Holy Ghost has no peace let the person feel with God peace peace oh wonderful peace coming down from the father amen do you love him tonight I thought about this thankfulness truly if you're satisfied you're thankful truly if you're content you're you're thankful thank you Jesus thank you
