[36:46] amen the children can be dismissed for
[36:47] sunday school

[36:51] psalms we're gonna go back to psalms
[36:53] 119.
[37:02] psalms 119 and we're going to start with
[37:04] verse 17
[37:06] and we're going to read verse 32
[37:14] deal bountifully with thy servant that i
[37:17] may live and keep thy word
[37:26] i am a stranger in the earth hide not
[37:28] thy commandments from me
[37:36] thou hast rebuked the proud that are
[37:38] cursed which do air from thy
[37:40] commandments
[37:48] princes also did sit and speak against
[37:51] me but thy servant did meditate in thy
[37:52] statutes
[37:58] my soul cleaveth unto the dust quickened
[38:00] thou me according to thy word
[38:10] make me to understand the way of thy
[38:12] precepts so shall i talk to of thy
[38:15] wondrous works
[38:22] remove me
[38:24] from
[38:25] remove from me the way of lying and
[38:28] grant me thy law graciously
[38:36] i have stuck unto thy testimonies o lord
[38:39] put me not to shame
[38:41] i will run the way of thy commandments
[38:44] when thou shalt
[38:47] charge my heart
[38:48] god bless you may be seated brother
[38:50] brian for adult sunday school
[39:01] morning brothers and sisters
[39:08] as we go through the 119th
[39:11] psalm there
[39:15] i don't know if you all know that but
[39:16] that's actually the hebrew apple that as
[39:19] you're going through from the start to
[39:20] the end also
[39:24] their language is a lot different than
[39:26] ours the semantic language words is or
[39:29] totally different than ours grammar
[39:31] everything so
[39:34] if you would challenge me to romans
[39:38] the
[39:38] fourth chapter
[39:46] i was listening
[39:49] to that uh reading that uh devotional
[39:52] this morning
[39:53] brother branham was talking about i'll
[39:55] just read a couple of these verses it
[39:57] says i beseech you therefore brethren by
[39:59] the mercies of god that you present your
[40:01] bodies
[40:02] a living sacrifice holy and acceptable
[40:07] because you're a reasonable servant so
[40:08] paul is saying here
[40:10] no matter what our circumstances
[40:12] whatever state we're at or where we're
[40:15] whatever is going on that's your
[40:17] reasonable service to present yourself
[40:20] before the living god
[40:22] and to present your sacrifices before
[40:24] the living god no matter what the world
[40:26] is doing to you out there you still have
[40:28] an obligation as a christian to serve
[40:30] your lord and it goes on say and be not
[40:33] conformed to the world but be
[40:35] transformed by the renewing of your
[40:37] minds
[40:38] that you may prove what is good and
[40:40] acceptable in the perfect will of god
[40:43] and it's really hard to fulfill the
[40:45] second scripture if you're
[40:47] number one if you're not doing the abcs
[40:50] like brother brown taught you always
[40:52] believe christ and also read your bible
[40:54] and pray every day
[40:56] it's going to be a hard thing for you to
[40:57] do the second verse here and he goes on
[41:00] to say
[41:01] for i say through grace given unto me to
[41:03] every man that among you not to think of
[41:05] himself more highly than he ought to
[41:07] think
[41:08] but to think soberly according as god
[41:10] has dealt to every man the measure of
[41:12] faith and that really speaks to our age
[41:15] that we're in you know a lot of times
[41:17] people think more of themselves than
[41:18] they really are you know you know my old
[41:20] profession you know i used to you know i
[41:22] say it a lot you know people have that
[41:24] disease
[41:25] of self-importance they think that more
[41:27] important than they really are in the
[41:29] scheme of things
[41:31] it's a heart disease
[41:34] once you
[41:35] it possesses you that you think without
[41:37] you
[41:38] nothing's going to work or nothing's
[41:40] going to be successful unless you've got
[41:41] your hands in it but that's not how a
[41:43] christian is you know that it's god's
[41:45] will in god's hand that guides
[41:47] everything um but that devotional i was
[41:51] reading this morning
[41:52] brother branham was talking about he was
[41:55] talking about the scripture transforming
[41:57] and you know he used to work as a
[41:59] lineman in an electrical company you
[42:02] know i do that every day deal with all
[42:04] kinds of different types of electrical
[42:05] parts
[42:06] when you know the thing about a
[42:08] transformer
[42:10] it has no moving parts there's nothing
[42:12] moving in that transformer but it takes
[42:14] a voltage from one state and moves it to
[42:17] another state whether it's higher or
[42:19] lower but i was just thinking this
[42:22] morning
[42:23] the truth about it is
[42:25] everything electrical
[42:27] you you gotta have something first
[42:30] before anything else will work and
[42:31] you've got to have the source you have
[42:33] to have the power or the energy to make
[42:36] it work and that's in anything we do in
[42:38] life if you don't have the power of
[42:40] jesus christ in your heart and life if
[42:42] you don't have the power of the gospel
[42:45] in you
[42:46] none of this is going to work you can
[42:48] try and try and try it's not going to
[42:50] work unless you got the baptism of the
[42:53] holy ghost and god has possessed your
[42:55] vessel
[42:57] it's not going to work not to say that
[42:58] you shouldn't strive to try i would
[43:00] never tell someone not to try i mean
[43:03] that's that's a bad spirit well you know
[43:06] you hear a lot of people saying well
[43:07] you're not going to be there so don't
[43:09] worry about it no i always encourage
[43:12] people to try to change as best they can
[43:15] but god when he gets on a hold of you
[43:18] and he changes you you know that god's
[43:20] done it for you we all come from
[43:22] different circumstances different places
[43:25] in life we're all raised in
[43:27] so most of you are from this state some
[43:29] of you come from other states and other
[43:31] places you know you all
[43:33] have your family groups you're from
[43:35] you're all raised different but the
[43:37] thing about being a christian all that
[43:39] goes to the wayside and when god makes
[43:41] you something then it's what god did for
[43:44] you not where you came from that matters
[43:46] and i'll just read a few more of these
[43:47] scriptures here
[43:49] you know the brother asked me this
[43:50] morning i'll be honest when i came to
[43:51] church this morning i was blank you know
[43:53] sometimes it's that way you can you
[43:56] can pray and you can read your bible for
[43:58] an hour sometimes and you don't have a
[44:00] clear concise thought that you want to
[44:02] express but
[44:04] the thing about whatever you do for the
[44:06] lord you've got to be willing to yield
[44:08] your vessel you got to be willing to
[44:10] just put your mind away and let god have
[44:13] his way in whatever you're doing
[44:15] in any circumstances whether it's at
[44:17] work whether when you come here whatever
[44:20] when you're dealing with issues in your
[44:22] family you've just got to be willing
[44:24] sometimes to be quiet enough to see what
[44:27] god's going to speak to you in any given
[44:30] situation and let me finish start with
[44:32] this third verse
[44:34] for i say through the grace given unto
[44:36] me to every man that is among you not to
[44:38] think of himself more highly than he
[44:40] ought to think
[44:41] but to think soberly according to god
[44:43] hath dwelt every man the measure of
[44:45] faith soberly you know you could spend
[44:48] a long time just talking about that
[44:50] world it goes back to these seven
[44:52] virtues behind me so being sober that's
[44:55] something this world doesn't have
[44:57] be sober that everything you do every
[44:59] time you think of thought or you're
[45:01] about to engage in another type of thing
[45:03] that soberly you consider it in prayer
[45:06] and reading of your bible to make sure
[45:08] you're doing the right thing he goes on
[45:10] to say in the fourth verse for as we
[45:13] have had many members in one body and
[45:15] all members have not the same office and
[45:18] that's being brutally honest here we're
[45:20] all not the same god
[45:22] raises us up to do different things
[45:24] should you be jealous of another man or
[45:26] another woman because god has raised him
[45:28] up to do something different no but you
[45:30] just got to accept the fact that
[45:31] everyone has a different purpose and a
[45:33] different
[45:34] office that they're going to fill
[45:36] having gifts differing according to
[45:38] grace has given us whether prophecy let
[45:40] us prophesy according to
[45:43] uh here's my pronunciation of our faith
[45:46] or ministers let us wait on our
[45:48] ministering for he that teaches on
[45:50] teaching that goes to what paul started
[45:52] with in the first couple of verses again
[45:55] you have to be willing to yield and wait
[45:58] for god to give you the green light or
[46:00] to open the door for you to do something
[46:03] and then he goes
[46:05] i don't want to re or he that exhorts
[46:08] exhortation he that giveth let him do it
[46:11] with simplicity he that ruth with
[46:13] diligently he that show with mercy
[46:16] cheerful cheerfulness
[46:18] you know that's when you know you have
[46:20] to show mercy that's a that's a hard
[46:22] thing to be cheerful about it you know
[46:24] you have to do the right thing
[46:26] and be cheerful about doing the right
[46:28] thing even though it might tear you
[46:30] apart when you're doing it but that's
[46:31] what the bible says sometimes you've got
[46:33] to make decisions where god is leading
[46:35] you to do something whether that's
[46:37] humbling yourself realizing you made a
[46:40] mistake
[46:41] or giving the other guy an advantage
[46:43] knowing that you're giving them an
[46:44] advantage you got to do it cheerfully
[46:46] you don't do it cheerfully it doesn't
[46:48] make a difference and he goes on say let
[46:51] love be without this simulation
[46:54] but poor that which is evil cleave that
[46:56] which is good and really
[46:57] for the day we're living that's really
[46:59] important yeah as you see things
[47:01] going
[47:03] just going crazy
[47:05] just let you know that you need to cling
[47:07] to christ even more and he goes on
[47:11] be kindly affectionate one to another
[47:13] with brotherly love and honor
[47:15] preferring one another
[47:17] not thoughtful in in business fervent in
[47:20] spirit serving the lord
[47:22] rejoicing in hope patient and
[47:24] tribulation continuing instant in prayer
[47:26] you know these goes back to what brother
[47:28] branham taught us about your abcs
[47:31] you know you have to do them do you do
[47:33] it out of uh if here's the difference
[47:36] you either do it out of love or you do
[47:38] it out of law and everyone has
[47:40] that
[47:41] where you have to say are you doing it
[47:43] out of love or are you doing it because
[47:44] you think you need to do it and he goes
[47:46] on rejoicing in hope patient and
[47:48] tribulation continuing instant and
[47:50] prayer
[47:51] distributing to the necessities of the
[47:53] same given to hospitality bless them
[47:56] which persecute you bless and curse not
[47:59] rejoice with them that you rejoice weep
[48:01] with them that we basically paul is
[48:04] talking here about just simple christian
[48:06] compassion for your brothers and sisters
[48:08] be of the same mind one toward another
[48:12] but not mind high things but
[48:14] condescended to men of low estate be not
[48:16] wise and you know this goes back i'm
[48:18] stopping in the middle of this verse
[48:20] it goes back to the second or first
[48:21] chapter of james's verse right here and
[48:24] you can see the bible is all intertwined
[48:26] together you know all the teachings in
[48:28] the bible you can find
[48:30] where you see paul say something you can
[48:32] see james or peter say the same thing
[48:35] and he goes on to say
[48:37] recompense no man evil for evil provide
[48:39] things honest in the sight of all men
[48:41] and if it be possible as such as lieth
[48:44] and you live peaceably with all men
[48:46] that's a goal for any christian as as
[48:49] much as people try to riley up you want
[48:51] to live at peace with them and it goes
[48:53] on to say dearly beloved eventually not
[48:56] yourself but rather get placed around
[48:58] for it is what written vengeance is mine
[49:01] and i will replace
[49:03] saith the lord therefore if thy enemy
[49:06] hunger feed him if he thirsts give him a
[49:08] drink for in so doing god shall he calls
[49:10] a fire upon his head and he that
[49:12] overcometh evil both overcome evil with
[49:15] good and like i said i come here flank
[49:17] this morning but the one thing i believe
[49:19] you you can't read god's word enough you
[49:22] know uh
[49:23] moses told the priests
[49:26] in his you know most people couldn't
[49:28] read and write in moses's state you know
[49:30] even
[49:31] 150 years ago even 50 years ago even in
[49:35] our old
[49:36] country knowing a lot of people couldn't
[49:38] read god's word they had to hear it from
[49:40] the preacher or hear from someone that
[49:42] could read it to him and but
[49:45] the thing moses told the priests is they
[49:47] were constantly supposed to throw the
[49:50] word of god upon the hearts and upon the
[49:52] minds of the people that was one of
[49:54] their obligation as priests they were
[49:57] constantly supposed to read the word of
[49:58] god and present the word of god to the
[50:01] people so they would fulfill it and it
[50:03] comes to us in our age as christians
[50:06] that can read and write and can reap
[50:07] what god has to say you know we don't
[50:10] have an excuse the closer you stay to
[50:11] god's word the closer you stay to him
[50:14] brother david

[55:31] morning god bless you it's
[55:33] like we said good to have each and
[55:34] everyone here this morning and
[55:36] amen and those that are watching online
[55:39] god bless you this morning
[55:41] you man you know i i read something this
[55:42] morning and
[55:44] i guess
[55:46] i'm kind of like brother brian this
[55:47] morning when i was praying the songs it
[55:49] seemed
[55:49] and now the way i felt like going it's
[55:52] going a little different but that's okay
[55:54] too and
[55:55] but branham said if you're a christian
[55:56] you love to go where other christians
[55:58] are
[55:59] and fellowship with other christians so
[56:01] you cannot stay away from church
[56:04] and live the same life
[56:06] you can't do it because it's like i'm
[56:07] hungry but you never go to the table
[56:11] i never eat or i just ain't gonna do it
[56:13] see you've got to go and feed on the
[56:16] word of god and fellowship
[56:18] with one another and that's our heart's
[56:20] desire and this song come on my mind
[56:21] this morning
[56:23] since i've been here this morning god's
[56:25] wonderful people i love the thrill that
[56:27] i feel when i get together with god's
[56:29] wonderful people and
[56:31] you know sometimes we struggle we battle
[56:35] just to get to the house of the lord but
[56:36] you know there's a reason why
[56:39] because the enemy doesn't want you to
[56:40] feed this morning
[56:42] he doesn't want you to praise the lord
[56:44] he doesn't want you to worship in spirit
[56:46] and truth this morning
[56:48] he wants you to feel beat down and feel
[56:51] like you're nobody but guess what you
[56:52] are somebody this morning
[56:54] you're a child of the king this morning
[56:56] and amen i love the thrill that i feel
[56:59] this morning amen
[57:02] i love the thrill that i feel when i get
[57:06] together with
[57:08] god's wonderful people i love
[57:13] [Music]
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:20] just to see all the happy faces praising
[57:24] god in heavenly places what a thrill

[1:19:58] things that you once said lord jesus and
[1:20:01] help me not to say anything in myself or
[1:20:03] in the flesh but just what you want to
[1:20:05] speak is what we want to hear lord and
[1:20:07] we ask god that you would help father
[1:20:09] the congregation this morning to pull on
[1:20:11] the gift lord of god lord jesus and that
[1:20:14] the cups may be
[1:20:16] lord held up high lord desiring father

[1:20:36] god bless you brother bo amen i don't
[1:20:38] know if i've seen you before or not
[1:20:40] probably have but anyway
[1:20:42] amen it is good to have emma sister emma
[1:20:44] with us this morning to you so and god
[1:20:47] bless you
[1:20:48] amen praise the lord so it's just good
[1:20:51] to be in the house of the lord
[1:20:52] amen so
[1:20:54] amen we're just going to take a little
[1:20:56] thought i feel like the lord's laid on
[1:20:58] my heart to speak
[1:20:59] i was
[1:21:00] studying last week and i ran across this
[1:21:04] and i was kind of leaning that way and
[1:21:06] but then the on the other hand i just
[1:21:08] stayed with what we had there and
[1:21:12] i felt went with what i felt like the
[1:21:14] lord wanted us to have last week
[1:21:16] and then so this week we're going to
[1:21:17] turn if you will to the book of
[1:21:19] ephesians
[1:21:24] we'll turn to the book of ephesians
[1:21:32] and we're going to do a bit of reading
[1:21:34] in the book of ephesians this morning
[1:21:39] certainly a thought
[1:21:41] we want to try to pick up that paul had
[1:21:43] and
[1:21:43] expressed
[1:21:45] and for some reason the last couple
[1:21:47] three services has been
[1:21:50] has to do with
[1:21:51] the holy spirit or christ being in us
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:55] and so
[1:21:56] as we spoke wednesday about how that we
[1:21:59] serve one another we serve god because
[1:22:03] amen and it doesn't fall in the category
[1:22:05] of serving man
[1:22:07] amen because we don't serve man but
[1:22:09] serving man is to serve
[1:22:12] a man's will outside of god's will
[1:22:14] that's serving man amen
[1:22:16] but to serve god's people by the holy
[1:22:18] spirit that's serving god amen as you
[1:22:21] serve one another you serve god we seen
[1:22:24] in judgment there wednesday night how
[1:22:26] that the sheep and the goats were
[1:22:28] separated and so forth and and both of
[1:22:31] them were
[1:22:32] either blessed or condemned because of
[1:22:35] how
[1:22:36] they treated
[1:22:37] god's people
[1:22:38] because god was in his people the least
[1:22:41] of these as you have done unto these the
[1:22:43] least of these mine
[1:22:45] children you have done it unto me amen
[1:22:48] so we know that as we treat each other
[1:22:50] as we treat god's people amen that's how
[1:22:53] we treat god
[1:22:58] amen
[1:22:59] in that right so be careful how you
[1:23:01] treat folks amen because amen if you are
[1:23:04] mean god's people remember you're being
[1:23:06] mean to god so and that's not going to
[1:23:09] be looked over so well so praise the
[1:23:12] lord i just love that thought the lord
[1:23:13] gave us and that was found and last
[1:23:15] sunday we touched on
[1:23:17] ephesians the second chapter amen and
[1:23:20] i'll just touch on it
[1:23:22] and verse 14 chapter 2 verse 14
[1:23:25] he says for he is our peace
[1:23:27] he is our peace
[1:23:28] who has made both one and has broken
[1:23:31] down that middle wall of partition
[1:23:34] between us amen talked about god amen
[1:23:38] abolishing petitions in that right and
[1:23:40] divisions and walls and barriers amen so
[1:23:43] now we want to go down a little bit
[1:23:45] further and let's uh
[1:23:47] go down to verse 16 through 22 and this
[1:23:50] is what we'll speak on for a while this
[1:23:52] morning
[1:23:54] all right verse 16 that he might
[1:23:56] reconcile both unto god in one body by
[1:23:59] the cross having slain the enmity
[1:24:01] thereby and came and preached peace to
[1:24:04] you which were afar off and in them that
[1:24:06] were nigh
[1:24:07] for through him we both have access
[1:24:12] by one spirit
[1:24:14] unto the father
[1:24:16] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[1:24:19] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[1:24:22] the saints and of the household of god
[1:24:25] and now notice here we go we go to
[1:24:28] talking about building a building from
[1:24:30] here on out
[1:24:31] talking about building a building
[1:24:33] and are built upon the foundation upon
[1:24:36] of the apostles and prophets jesus
[1:24:40] christ himself being the chief
[1:24:43] cornerstone amen
[1:24:45] how many believes god is building a
[1:24:47] building
[1:24:49] now notice in whom all the building
[1:24:52] fitly framed together groweth into an
[1:24:56] holy temple in the lord in whom ye also
[1:25:00] are build it together
[1:25:03] for inhabitation of god through the
[1:25:05] spirit amen this morning's title is
[1:25:08] going to be
[1:25:09] a habitation for god amen so god bless
[1:25:12] this reading of the word you can be
[1:25:14] seated this morning
[1:25:15] praise be to god how many believe that
[1:25:18] god is a builder
[1:25:21] god is a
[1:25:22] builder he is a wise master builder
[1:25:26] amen i
[1:25:28] i've done carpentry work many years
[1:25:31] myself amen and i know what it's like to
[1:25:35] build and i know what it's like to have
[1:25:37] to tear down and to redo and and so
[1:25:40] forth and every every carpenter i
[1:25:43] believe has a reciprocating saw
[1:25:47] amen
[1:25:48] amen because that reciprocating sauce
[1:25:50] for the most part is to tear out what
[1:25:52] you did wrong amen and so but that's not
[1:25:56] how it is with god god don't need no
[1:25:58] reciprocating salt he doesn't need to
[1:26:00] redo anything because he knows how to do
[1:26:03] it perfect the first time
[1:26:05] amen and i'm glad for that so we know
[1:26:07] that god is in the building business
[1:26:09] amen i believe he said in saint john 13
[1:26:12] to 14 i'm thinking maybe it was 14 where
[1:26:14] he says you know i go to prepare a place
[1:26:17] for you
[1:26:19] amen
[1:26:20] and i believe in the future home but
[1:26:22] says that jesus christ is presently over
[1:26:24] there amen and that he is building the
[1:26:26] future home
[1:26:28] amen of uh amen for us for the bride
[1:26:31] building our future home
[1:26:33] amen and so i can't imagine what it
[1:26:35] would be like now how many knows he took
[1:26:37] either i don't know which it was to be
[1:26:40] honest with you i don't know if it was
[1:26:42] uh one week or if it was 6 000 years
[1:26:45] that god took to build the earth isn't
[1:26:47] that right amen it talks about six days
[1:26:49] and so forth and then all the way to the
[1:26:51] sixth day he built this that or the
[1:26:52] other seventh day he rested amen but at
[1:26:56] any rate whether it was six days or six
[1:26:58] thousand years because the bible does
[1:27:00] say that one year is with him as a
[1:27:02] thousand years or one day is with him is
[1:27:04] a thousand years isn't it not one year
[1:27:06] but anyway so we know that he's been
[1:27:08] gone now for about what uh the lord's
[1:27:11] been working amen for a couple of
[1:27:13] thousand years you can only imagine what
[1:27:15] god can get done in that time frame amen
[1:27:19] so we know that we have something on the
[1:27:21] other side that's going to be
[1:27:23] something amen that we can't imagine
[1:27:26] amen like paul said it's not entered the
[1:27:28] heart of man the things that god has
[1:27:30] prepared for them that love him amen but
[1:27:33] he is getting a place ready for us and
[1:27:36] he is building that place over there how
[1:27:39] maybe he's going to have streets of gold
[1:27:41] walls of jasper and so forth i mean
[1:27:43] there's going to be houses and avenues
[1:27:46] and there's going to be oh man a river
[1:27:48] flowing down through the midst of it all
[1:27:50] and all of these things that you can
[1:27:51] only imagine god is building amen
[1:27:55] but can we say this morning would it be
[1:27:57] okay to say this morning amen that the
[1:28:00] streets are empty
[1:28:03] the houses are empty
[1:28:06] huh
[1:28:07] i think it'll be okay to say because how
[1:28:10] many knows he is building that for you
[1:28:12] and me
[1:28:13] amen and so you know he's getting it all
[1:28:15] ready on that side he's getting
[1:28:18] everything ready everything built just
[1:28:21] to our take and on this side he's
[1:28:23] getting another portion ready he's doing
[1:28:27] some building over here too
[1:28:30] so i don't know about you but a god is a
[1:28:32] very busy man and amen he's very busy
[1:28:34] and he's got a lot going and but you
[1:28:37] know i i can't you just blow your mind
[1:28:40] if you try to figure out how god can do
[1:28:42] all this but he can
[1:28:43] because he's god he's awesome he meant
[1:28:45] he's over here on this side and he's
[1:28:47] doing the work also and he's building
[1:28:49] something he has a purpose and he has a
[1:28:52] plan
[1:28:54] amen now to the world
[1:28:56] it is a mystery
[1:28:58] right
[1:28:58] to the world what god is up to
[1:29:01] is a mystery
[1:29:04] you know i can't figure it out
[1:29:06] they don't know what it's all about
[1:29:10] oh my
[1:29:12] but aren't you thankful that you know
[1:29:15] because listen the bible says that when
[1:29:17] he wrote
[1:29:18] which he wrought in christ when he
[1:29:20] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:29:22] his own right hand in heavenly places he
[1:29:25] said in far above all principality and
[1:29:28] power and might and dominion and every
[1:29:30] name that is named not only in this
[1:29:32] world but that which is to come so how
[1:29:34] many believes that creases christ at
[1:29:36] this present time is above every power
[1:29:39] above every dominion that there is he's
[1:29:41] above it all
[1:29:43] and he's got the highest name that there
[1:29:46] ever was named amen
[1:29:48] not only in this world but also in that
[1:29:50] which is to come and has put all things
[1:29:53] under his feet and gave him to be the
[1:29:55] head over all things to the church which
[1:29:58] is his body the fullness
[1:30:00] amen that of him that filleth all and in
[1:30:04] all praise the lord then in chapter one
[1:30:06] of ephesians verse uh eight will go and
[1:30:09] read that listen he says wherein he has
[1:30:11] abounded toward us
[1:30:13] in all wisdom and prudence
[1:30:16] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:30:21] his will
[1:30:24] praise be to god aren't you glad this
[1:30:26] morning that you understand
[1:30:28] what it's all about
[1:30:32] oh my there is nothing like having
[1:30:34] clarity of mine
[1:30:39] amen having a clear mind understanding
[1:30:42] something perfectly it is rather
[1:30:45] illuminating amen
[1:30:47] because if you're confused and don't
[1:30:49] know and don't understand it's a
[1:30:52] terrible place to be
[1:30:55] and that's where the world is they don't
[1:30:58] understand they don't they just don't
[1:31:00] comprehend it they don't know what it's
[1:31:03] all about
[1:31:06] amen but i'm here to tell you there's
[1:31:07] only two factions in the world there's
[1:31:09] two programs in the world the one
[1:31:12] program is god's program the other one
[1:31:14] is the devil's program
[1:31:16] amen we belong to one program or the
[1:31:19] other and if you truly believe to the
[1:31:21] program that i want to help you by the
[1:31:23] grace of god this morning to get you to
[1:31:25] understand that if you have the
[1:31:26] revelation that you are part of god's
[1:31:29] program
[1:31:31] when you truly get understanding of who
[1:31:34] you really are the prophet said the
[1:31:36] rapture will take place
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:41] amen oh my
[1:31:44] all right let's go home

[1:31:47] you are you can just go home and be
[1:31:49] happy for the whole week can we get back
[1:31:51] sunday again amen
[1:31:53] it's the greatest joy that in the
[1:31:56] world if you can understand what in the
[1:31:58] world you're here for who you really are
[1:32:01] here which side you long on where you
[1:32:04] belong and then you can put that
[1:32:06] foundation down and nothing can shake
[1:32:09] you though the storm's rage nothing can
[1:32:11] shake you
[1:32:13] amen
[1:32:14] praise the lord

[1:32:18] jesus said a wise man what he built his
[1:32:20] house upon a rock
[1:32:23] and that right he built his house upon
[1:32:25] iraq amen the winds blew the storm games
[1:32:28] amen the streams and luke he said the
[1:32:30] streams beat me eminently against that
[1:32:33] house but it stood because he had
[1:32:36] founded his house upon the rock
[1:32:40] amen
[1:32:42] oh my that's what you got to do first
[1:32:44] the foundation amended peter i mean
[1:32:47] ephesians said he says that jesus christ
[1:32:49] is what the chief
[1:32:52] cornerstone that's what all the house
[1:32:55] leans on is that chief cornerstone he is
[1:32:58] the very foundation the chief
[1:33:00] cornerstone
[1:33:02] praise be to god
[1:33:03] he made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:33:06] will
[1:33:08] according to the good pleasure which he
[1:33:10] has purposed in himself
[1:33:13] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:33:15] of time he might gather together
[1:33:18] gathered together in one
[1:33:21] all things in christ
[1:33:24] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:33:27] in earth even in him
[1:33:31] amen
[1:33:34] praise be to god
[1:33:36] it's part of the things of christ are in
[1:33:38] the earth the dust of the earth isn't
[1:33:40] that right
[1:33:43] back to adams they burned them they fed
[1:33:45] them the lions they did all these things
[1:33:47] but one day god's going to gather those
[1:33:49] things all together
[1:33:52] amen

[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:14] amen you've got to be in christ
[1:34:18] not in church
[1:34:21] in christ in the holy ghost
[1:34:24] that's the only way that you're going to
[1:34:26] be gathered if you go down to your grave
[1:34:28] without that quickening power there
[1:34:30] won't be nothing to raise you back up
[1:34:33] you got to have that quickening power

[1:40:56] that is lage which is jesus christ
[1:41:00] praise be to god
[1:41:06] you know as much as we admired our
[1:41:08] prophet and even he did such signs and
[1:41:10] wonders and jesus worked through him so
[1:41:12] much and he's earning the thoughts of
[1:41:14] the people in the heart
[1:41:15] and the healing that took place out
[1:41:17] there until they thought he was jesus
[1:41:20] but even brother brown says i'm not just
[1:41:22] nine no better than the sinner that was
[1:41:24] saved yesterday and in his picture
[1:41:26] you'll find that he is pointing us to
[1:41:28] christ
[1:41:30] every true prophet or messenger or
[1:41:33] preacher will not point you to their
[1:41:35] self they will point you to jesus christ
[1:41:40] you try to get in any other way and you
[1:41:42] are nothing but a thief and a robber and
[1:41:45] you're going to be
[1:41:47] found out and you're going to be said to
[1:41:49] amen how did you get in here
[1:41:52] cast them out they'll be weeping and
[1:41:54] wailing and gnashing of teeth jesus
[1:41:56] christ is the foundation there's no
[1:41:58] other foundation than jesus christ
[1:42:01] even what he did on the cross that is
[1:42:04] the foundation of every principle of
[1:42:06] christianity
[1:42:08] i tell you something in revelation 3 and
[1:42:10] 14 and talk unto the angels of blasians
[1:42:13] right this is a faithful and true
[1:42:15] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:42:19] god
[1:42:21] amen how many know jesus was the
[1:42:22] beginning of the creation of god and
[1:42:25] romans 8 says that he we were
[1:42:27] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:42:29] image of his son
[1:42:32] that's what god's building god is
[1:42:34] building sons and daughters god is
[1:42:36] building and has been building
[1:42:39] oh
[1:42:42] a place
[1:42:44] of habitation
[1:42:47] a place
[1:42:49] to habitate
[1:42:51] your house
[1:42:53] is where you habitate
[1:42:55] i right
[1:42:57] that's your habitation where
[1:42:59] do you live
[1:43:01] 2901
[1:43:03] green ridge borrowed that's where i live
[1:43:06] that's where my house is
[1:43:09] the world can ask jesus christ where do
[1:43:11] you live
[1:43:14] where is he gonna say
[1:43:16] i live
[1:43:17] in my people
[1:43:19] i live
[1:43:20] in my church
[1:43:22] that is the place
[1:43:24] of my habitation
[1:43:40] now if any man build upon this
[1:43:41] foundation gold silver precious stone
[1:43:43] wood haze double every man's work shall
[1:43:45] be made manifest for the day shall
[1:43:47] declare it because it shall be revealed
[1:43:49] by fire
[1:43:51] and the fire shall try every man's work
[1:43:53] of
[1:43:54] what sort it is
[1:43:58] amen
[1:44:00] notice
[1:44:01] if any man's work shall be burnt notice
[1:44:03] if any man's work abide which he hath
[1:44:05] built upon he shall be shall receive a
[1:44:07] reward if any man's work shall be burned
[1:44:09] he shall suffer lost but he himself
[1:44:11] shall be saved
[1:44:13] yet so as by fire
[1:44:15] i don't know just what that means
[1:44:17] verse 16
[1:44:19] not that ye are
[1:44:22] the temple of god
[1:44:29] and that the spirit of god dwelleth in
[1:44:33] you why don't we drink why don't we
[1:44:35] smoke
[1:44:37] why don't we cuz why don't we do all
[1:44:39] this get all kinds of dirt on our hearts
[1:44:41] and our lives
[1:44:42] because the next verse says if any man
[1:44:44] defile
[1:44:46] the temple of god
[1:44:48] him shall god
[1:44:51] save
[1:44:53] destroy
[1:44:57] don't defile
[1:44:58] the temple of god
[1:45:02] for the temple of god is holy
[1:45:05] which temple are
[1:45:07] ye
[1:45:10] think about it
[1:45:11] we know that the threefold purpose of
[1:45:14] god one of them was that god was gonna
[1:45:16] be above us which was the old testament
[1:45:19] then he came down and he was gonna dwell
[1:45:21] with us emmanuel jesus christ in the
[1:45:24] flesh
[1:45:25] and then the third was that he was gonna
[1:45:27] be in his people
[1:45:33] that's why you can't give a child of god
[1:45:35] a cup of water
[1:45:36] but you'll get a reward for it
[1:45:39] you can't call them stupid
[1:45:41] but that you'll get a reward for it
[1:45:44] huh
[1:45:46] you can't call them nails you can't do
[1:45:48] anything
[1:45:49] to them but what you receive a reward
[1:45:51] for because they are where god dwells
[1:45:56] amen i think we need to remember this i
[1:45:58] think that we get so common i believe
[1:46:00] sometimes we become so common to
[1:46:02] ourselves that we forget the fact that
[1:46:05] it's god living in us
[1:46:07] doing his own good pleasure
[1:46:10] that you are not your own your bought
[1:46:12] with a price you're not living your own
[1:46:14] life you are now god god's now living
[1:46:18] his life through you
[1:46:20] everything you do everything you say
[1:46:24] everything you think should reflect
[1:46:27] christ
[1:46:29] oh i love to talk about how that we
[1:46:31] ought to have a good old shout and
[1:46:33] praising god worshiping god on this side
[1:46:36] oh we love them hallelujah gloria times
[1:46:38] let the glory roll when the roll is
[1:46:40] called glory
[1:46:42] but remember one of these days we're
[1:46:44] gonna walk those streets of golden we're
[1:46:46] gonna walk up and down on the streets of
[1:46:48] gold and i'll tell you what we want to
[1:46:50] walk here the way we're gonna walk on
[1:46:52] those streets of gold
[1:46:55] are you with me this morning
[1:46:57] what kind of life did you live the
[1:46:58] attitude that you have the spirit that
[1:47:00] you have
[1:47:01] the thought pattern that you have
[1:47:03] is that right
[1:47:05] is it worthy to walk down those streets
[1:47:07] but will you just fit in when you're
[1:47:09] transferred from here to there
[1:47:14] if you drown drop dead right now we want
[1:47:17] to be the way that you are
[1:47:21] why do you say that brother byler i say
[1:47:23] that because we know that the prophet
[1:47:25] taught us that death doesn't change you
[1:47:30] when you die that's what you are
[1:47:33] death doesn't change you amen so you ask
[1:47:36] yourself if i died right now
[1:47:39] is that how you'd want to be
[1:47:42] if not i hope before next sunday you
[1:47:45] come back you can say yeah i am where i
[1:47:46] need to be
[1:47:48] amen or should i say before next sunday
[1:47:51] before the service is over let's not
[1:47:53] push it off that long you might be dead
[1:47:55] before they get chance
[1:47:57] amen
[1:48:00] would you fit there
[1:48:04] man if you got amongst a bunch of shout
[1:48:06] and preach and scream and hollering
[1:48:08] people over there where should be god
[1:48:09] said oh i'm so glad
[1:48:12] that the lord brought me out amazing
[1:48:15] grace how sweet this
[1:48:26] how much does he really mean to you
[1:48:29] folks by saying that i realize god is
[1:48:31] building something everything he is
[1:48:33] doing he's building and working on you
[1:48:36] brother david sings that song a lot of
[1:48:38] time when i preach these things he's
[1:48:39] still working on me making what i ought
[1:48:42] to be yeah that's exactly what he's
[1:48:43] doing
[1:48:44] i believe he how many believes he's
[1:48:46] working on you because you are
[1:48:49] the temple of god and if he isn't
[1:48:52] inhabiting the way that he should then
[1:48:54] lord help us
[1:48:56] to make some more room for
[1:48:58] him back to ephesians
[1:49:02] amen how many believes were his body
[1:49:05] now we've heard all kinds of symbols and
[1:49:07] things like you know a red horse and a
[1:49:09] black horse and uh you know scorpions
[1:49:11] with tails and heads like lions and all
[1:49:13] kinds of symbolic things in the bible
[1:49:16] but our our
[1:49:18] a little bit different symbol is that we
[1:49:20] are the body of christ and the head is
[1:49:22] in heaven
[1:49:24] how many believes that
[1:49:26] the head is not with us
[1:49:28] the head is in heaven but this is the
[1:49:30] body
[1:49:32] whenever whenever they i don't have a
[1:49:34] hoffman i don't have a cloud here but
[1:49:36] how many knows that he says that was the
[1:49:38] hoffman's head of christ those angels
[1:49:40] formed the hoffman side of christ and
[1:49:41] i've seen pictures where you can see the
[1:49:43] eyes you can see the chin you can see
[1:49:45] all of that he says that's the head
[1:49:46] that's your head
[1:49:48] the thing of it is we still get orders
[1:49:50] from the head it's not severed it's not
[1:49:52] disconnected we are connected to the
[1:49:55] head isn't that right amen through
[1:49:57] spiritual revelation we're connected to
[1:49:59] the head but you are the only body that
[1:50:01] he has how many plays out this morning
[1:50:04] you are his body even the prophet said
[1:50:06] the devils don't they can't they can
[1:50:08] seem english can't do anything unless
[1:50:10] they got somebody to work through
[1:50:13] that's the same way with the holy ghost
[1:50:16] huh
[1:50:19] everything's just
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:25] absolutely nothing
[1:50:27] without god being in your heart
[1:50:31] amen
[1:50:33] these are god's hands
[1:50:35] these are god's eyes
[1:50:37] this is god's mind
[1:50:38] watch what you let to go through it
[1:50:41] isn't that right
[1:50:44] amen
[1:50:45] praise the lord
[1:50:47] okay
[1:50:48] so now look
[1:50:50] let's go uh down to verse 15 of chapter
[1:50:53] four
[1:50:54] and then we're gonna go backwards and
[1:50:56] pick up a couple scriptures before that
[1:50:59] okay
[1:51:00] okay four
[1:51:07] and 16 right here
[1:51:09] we'll go to that first
[1:51:12] let's go 15 but speaking the truth in
[1:51:15] love you may
[1:51:17] grow up
[1:51:18] into him
[1:51:19] in all things
[1:51:21] which is the head
[1:51:23] even christ
[1:51:25] from whom the whole body
[1:51:28] fitly joined
[1:51:30] together
[1:51:32] and compacted by that which every joint
[1:51:35] supply of accord according to the
[1:51:38] effectual working of the measure
[1:51:40] of every part making increase of the
[1:51:44] body
[1:51:45] unto the edifying of itself
[1:51:48] in love amen so we find that the body of
[1:51:52] christ is to be fitly
[1:51:56] joined
[1:51:57] together
[1:51:58] that's why paul said don't let there be
[1:52:00] any divisions among you
[1:52:03] every one of you think the same thing
[1:52:05] speak the same thing
[1:52:07] amen
[1:52:08] because that's how a body is supposed to
[1:52:10] work so that's how everything's supposed
[1:52:12] to work the foundation comes to the
[1:52:14] primitive lord it comes to this it comes
[1:52:16] to the walls walls everything is that
[1:52:19] everything is in the place that it ought
[1:52:21] to be
[1:52:23] isn't that right
[1:52:25] notice
[1:52:26] when he went up into heaven verse 9
[1:52:28] going backwards now here he said verse 9
[1:52:31] when he ascended what was it but did he
[1:52:33] also descended first into the lower
[1:52:36] parts of the earth that he that
[1:52:38] descended is the same also which
[1:52:40] ascended up far above the heavens said
[1:52:42] am
[1:52:43] feel all things
[1:52:46] praise be to god
[1:52:48] i thought about that on the way to
[1:52:50] church
[1:52:51] feel all things
[1:52:56] what would happen
[1:52:59] if god was
[1:53:00] to die
[1:53:03] everything would die
[1:53:05] then brother bam says the blade of grass
[1:53:08] they don't even know what makes that
[1:53:10] grow
[1:53:10] what makes that life what's the life in
[1:53:12] that he says that's god in there
[1:53:15] huh
[1:53:19] everything with that die
[1:53:20] because he's the one that keeps
[1:53:21] everything alive
[1:53:24] all right
[1:53:25] and that's what he wants to be in his
[1:53:26] body
[1:53:28] he wants to feel
[1:53:30] all
[1:53:31] feel
[1:53:32] everything
[1:53:34] he wants to feel
[1:53:35] all things
[1:53:37] and he gave
[1:53:39] some apostles prophets some evangelists
[1:53:42] pastors and teachers
[1:53:44] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:53:46] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:53:49] the body of christ
[1:53:52] how many knows that we already know that
[1:53:54] the body of christ
[1:53:57] and all the way down to each believer
[1:54:00] that you are
[1:54:01] that temple that he's building
[1:54:03] you are the building of god the body of
[1:54:05] christ is the building that god is
[1:54:07] inhabiting and now he's given apostles
[1:54:10] and prophets and teachers
[1:54:12] to do what
[1:54:14] tear out things that aren't supposed to
[1:54:16] be there
[1:54:17] because let's admit it this is a house
[1:54:19] that has to get renovated
[1:54:21] it has to completely get renovated
[1:54:23] because we've got all kinds
[1:54:25] of things in there that needs to be
[1:54:27] ripped out and it needs to be made brand
[1:54:30] spanking no
[1:54:33] amen
[1:54:35] every time the lord rebukes you every
[1:54:38] time the lord speaks to you brothers and
[1:54:40] sisters he is working on you
[1:54:44] oh i'm so thankful for that aren't you
[1:54:47] aren't you thankful that god is causing
[1:54:49] you to grow
[1:54:51] and to come to completion
[1:54:56] i believe that we had a man in this
[1:54:58] generation that came to completion
[1:55:01] that came to
[1:55:02] perfection we did i truly believe it
[1:55:07] amen that god could say that ordinary
[1:55:10] young couple that's kissing each other
[1:55:12] all over the place close to the front
[1:55:14] row just doing it to disturb the whole
[1:55:17] congregation
[1:55:18] he said whatever you say to them it'll
[1:55:20] happen to them
[1:55:22] huh well we need another anonymize and
[1:55:25] spy can you imagine no doubt but
[1:55:28] probably if he said because if you have
[1:55:30] done this they will pack your bodies out
[1:55:34] and they drop dead right there it has
[1:55:36] brought a reverence and the scare and
[1:55:37] the fear in the church like you ain't
[1:55:39] never seen
[1:55:41] lord of mercy people come in here and
[1:55:43] watch what they even think isn't that
[1:55:44] right
[1:55:46] sure but he didn't do that did he
[1:55:48] he was merciful
[1:55:51] he was merciful
[1:55:53] because that's what god is he's merciful
[1:55:55] and he says i'll tell you what
[1:55:57] can you imagine older than people god
[1:56:00] just told me that whatever i tell
[1:56:01] whatever i say about y'all it'll happen
[1:56:04] to you
[1:56:06] no doubt but the holy spirit scared the
[1:56:07] liver out of them no doubt potato had
[1:56:09] such a respect
[1:56:12] man i messed up
[1:56:14] but when he said
[1:56:16] i forgive you for that
[1:56:17] huh
[1:56:18] i forgive you for that
[1:56:20] because remember even brother bannon
[1:56:22] said that elisha i believe it was and
[1:56:24] the bears he says that was the wrath of
[1:56:26] man
[1:56:27] when he cursed them children because
[1:56:28] they made fun of him and not having any
[1:56:30] air
[1:56:31] huh
[1:56:33] it wasn't christ it was him but god
[1:56:35] backed him up because that's what he
[1:56:36] said
[1:56:40] amen
[1:56:42] oh my
[1:56:45] let me just say
[1:56:47] what's come to my mind
[1:56:50] when i think about even this church a
[1:56:52] lot of us folks
[1:56:53] have known each other for the last 30
[1:56:54] years now by the bread
[1:56:56] been here this october 20th be 30 years
[1:57:01] when i know you i know y'all y'all know
[1:57:03] me
[1:57:04] i'm so grateful i'm thankful that god
[1:57:06] has caused us to grow up
[1:57:13] no we're not completely grown yet
[1:57:16] but we've improved isn't that right
[1:57:18] we've grown
[1:57:19] a lot we've learned a lot there's a lot
[1:57:23] of things that just don't happen anymore
[1:57:25] things that we don't do anymore because
[1:57:28] it's childish and it's foolish isn't
[1:57:30] that right
[1:57:33] well i'll tell you what brother glenn if
[1:57:35] i was still doing the same thing i did
[1:57:36] 15 years ago
[1:57:38] huh
[1:57:40] if i couldn't pastor any better than i
[1:57:42] did about 15 years ago ago i should quit
[1:57:46] huh you got to grow you got to get
[1:57:48] better
[1:57:49] grow up into him amen how many wants to
[1:57:53] do that see god i want to grow up and i
[1:57:54] just work on a little bit more amen
[1:57:58] praise be to god
[1:58:00] i know i say things that's a little
[1:58:01] sticky sometimes but i have a right to
[1:58:06] amen
[1:58:08] praise the lord you love the lord
[1:58:10] i like that
[1:58:13] paul saying
[1:58:14] the building fitly framed together
[1:58:17] groweth into a holy temple of the lord
[1:58:19] and it was just the next chapter that he
[1:58:21] goes from talking about fitly frame
[1:58:24] together to coming to perfection through
[1:58:26] the five-fold ministry that is to help
[1:58:29] and
[1:58:30] absolutely help
[1:58:32] amen how many knows if you don't ever
[1:58:34] listen to a preacher what are you are
[1:58:35] you going to get any better
[1:58:38] no
[1:58:39] because that's the way god ordained it
[1:58:40] to be amen
[1:58:42] until we come into the statue of a
[1:58:44] perfect man
[1:58:45] amen
[1:58:47] you love the lord this morning
[1:58:50] the beginning of the creation of god now
[1:58:52] notice let's look at another habitation
[1:58:54] for a few minutes would you it just came
[1:58:57] to my mind back there in the con in uh
[1:58:59] in my studies i was beginning to think
[1:59:01] about the habitation of god but god has
[1:59:04] been working to get a place that he can
[1:59:07] live
[1:59:08] a place that he's going to live out of
[1:59:10] his life and that he's going to inhabit
[1:59:15] and i thought about there's another
[1:59:16] habitation in order for that to happen
[1:59:18] in order for god to come and inhabit you
[1:59:22] and inhabit me how many know there has
[1:59:24] to be an opening of your heart's door
[1:59:28] for god to work on you you have to first
[1:59:31] open your heart before god can ever come
[1:59:33] into your heart you've got to open it
[1:59:35] because he said i stand at that door and
[1:59:39] i
[1:59:40] knock
[1:59:47] amen if any man open the door
[1:59:49] i will come into him and i will sup with
[1:59:52] him and he with me
[1:59:55] in other words we'll have fellowship
[1:59:56] together so there has to be an opening
[1:59:59] amen if you want more how many can say
[2:00:02] this morning go with me if you want more
[2:00:04] of god there has to be a further opening
[2:00:07] of your hearts door
[2:00:10] you got to open a little wider you gotta
[2:00:12] open a little deeper
[2:00:15] and how do you do that
[2:00:17] how do you get anywhere is through
[2:00:19] choice
[2:00:21] through choice
[2:00:23] let me ask you this how many knows that
[2:00:25] how many knows what you're gonna do next
[2:00:27] week
[2:00:29] right well this is what i plan on doing
[2:00:31] tomorrow morning this is what i plan to
[2:00:33] do it's because of the choice that you
[2:00:34] make hey you can be at work or you can
[2:00:37] say i'm going to canada i'm going to
[2:00:39] somewhere else i'm going here there
[2:00:41] whatever it might be i'm going to take a
[2:00:42] vacation you can be wheelchair wherever
[2:00:44] you want to be
[2:00:46] and so is it with god when you open up
[2:00:48] your choice your heart your mind and say
[2:00:50] i want more of god then guess what
[2:00:52] you're going to get more of god
[2:00:58] oh my i've been holding back on saying
[2:01:00] this but i'm going to go ahead and say
[2:01:02] it
[2:01:04] because ultimately this is what i want
[2:01:05] to try to talk about tarzan a little bit
[2:01:07] but you know because i've been praying
[2:01:09] lord draw me closer to you and yeah i've
[2:01:11] been praying lord talk to me today
[2:01:14] speak to me today how many ever does
[2:01:16] that
[2:01:17] lord speak to me because when we pray
[2:01:19] let me
[2:01:20] oh my we go down here and we get in our
[2:01:23] knees and we say lord jesus pray for my
[2:01:25] mom my dad my brother my sister god i
[2:01:28] just bless them bless me today and help
[2:01:29] me to do everything according to your
[2:01:31] will and lord do this for me
[2:01:34] and we go rattling but everybody says we
[2:01:36] do all the talking most of the time and
[2:01:39] we don't do the listening
[2:01:42] we don't do any listening god can't get
[2:01:44] the word edgewise in
[2:01:46] prayer is supposed about
[2:01:48] speaking it's lord i want to thank you
[2:01:50] and for your goodness wonderful a day
[2:01:52] you gave me and you know
[2:01:56] so i was driving down the road again i
[2:01:57] said lord i know that you want
[2:01:59] fellowship because uh you know you made
[2:02:01] it your prophet taught us that when
[2:02:03] we're reconciled to god like paul says
[2:02:05] we have every right to be in every
[2:02:07] condition that adam was before the fall
[2:02:10] folks if you need a storm to stop you
[2:02:12] should be able to stop the storm
[2:02:19] i believe it i absolutely believe it's
[2:02:21] there for us
[2:02:23] huh
[2:02:25] and he wants to fellowship and he must
[2:02:27] come come here
[2:02:28] and we're going down the road that says
[2:02:30] lord speak to me today
[2:02:33] and you know it wasn't five seconds he
[2:02:35] did brother glenn
[2:02:38] now i found out that when you want to
[2:02:39] have a fellowship with the father it's
[2:02:42] not that you're having fellowship with
[2:02:43] grandpa
[2:02:47] because if emilyn has fellowship with
[2:02:49] grandpa when we go down through walmart
[2:02:51] like she went and told her mama mama
[2:02:53] papa bought me everything
[2:02:59] oh it was just a three dollar nick not
[2:03:01] carrying a two dollar that and i can
[2:03:03] afford 15
[2:03:04] she calls that everything
[2:03:10] but he's not a grandpa that just bestows
[2:03:12] everything upon you and that just oh man
[2:03:14] it lavishes you with things so when i
[2:03:16] ask for fellowship love fellowship lord
[2:03:19] bless me and lord i just want to have a
[2:03:20] fellowship with you talk with me i don't
[2:03:22] have a greater talk with you
[2:03:26] diving down the road and he says okay he
[2:03:28] said look at your speedometer
[2:03:32] yes lord yes lord
[2:03:35] pull it back a little
[2:03:37] well i wasn't expecting that
[2:03:43] what does a father do a child most of
[2:03:46] the time when he's growing in that right
[2:03:49] you correct me man well dude don't do
[2:03:50] this would you what you might don't
[2:03:51] start doing don't do this
[2:03:53] aren't you kids about tired of hearing

[2:04:20] often do not to do
[2:04:23] tear down their own house
[2:04:25] i don't understand why our young
[2:04:27] generation is tearing down their own
[2:04:29] house
[2:04:30] we have a lazy generation
[2:04:33] amen
[2:04:35] i trust it's not all millennials
[2:04:38] but millennials most of the time when
[2:04:40] you see them out there they're still
[2:04:41] walking the sidewalks with their pajamas
[2:04:46] they're going to walmart they're still
[2:04:48] wearing their tablets
[2:04:50] come on huh
[2:04:52] it's sad
[2:04:54] like i said i gave room for some
[2:04:56] they're not all like that
[2:04:58] but thank god for a mom and a dad taught
[2:05:00] you how to work
[2:05:02] amen the value of a good day's
[2:05:04] work but they're thinking about that i'm
[2:05:07] getting on my track here but the lord
[2:05:08] spoke he says you know well what about
[2:05:10] that i said thank you jesus
[2:05:13] amen because he'll speak to you
[2:05:16] amen and every listen to me if you just
[2:05:18] late my this is what i got from the lord
[2:05:20] to hear in the last club
[2:05:22] if you just listen deeper oh i hope this
[2:05:25] goes out there amen
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:27] every little thing that you do that's
[2:05:30] contrary to the word god will speak to
[2:05:33] you about
[2:05:39] most of the time
[2:05:41] we are listening
[2:05:44] let me tell you something and i find out
[2:05:46] most of the time we're not hearing god
[2:05:47] is wanting to fellowship with us he is
[2:05:49] wanting to talk with us
[2:05:51] but the problem is not with him talking
[2:05:53] to us how many believes that
[2:05:55] how many believe jesus loves to talk to
[2:05:57] you god loves to talk to you
[2:05:59] but it's our hearing ability that's the
[2:06:01] problem
[2:06:04] and for everything the holy spirit would
[2:06:06] convict you on
[2:06:09] that you kind of smooth it under
[2:06:12] that steal yourself in the way
[2:06:15] of him inhabiting your body
[2:06:19] you're still preventing him every little
[2:06:21] thing that you don't hear because he'll
[2:06:22] tell you if you speak too harsh to your
[2:06:25] wife he'll tell you about it
[2:06:28] if your the wife doesn't treat the
[2:06:29] husband the way that she should the holy
[2:06:32] spirit
[2:06:33] will
[2:06:34] tell you
[2:06:35] you just don't hear it because you're
[2:06:36] not here listening he'll tell you how
[2:06:38] many believes you'll do
[2:06:40] you get sensitive to the holy spirit how
[2:06:41] many had no brother ben nora that other
[2:06:43] brother that was here he said it is
[2:06:45] absolutely amazing how message believers
[2:06:48] have gotten so callous
[2:06:50] in their conscience
[2:06:53] huh
[2:06:55] and folks i'll be the first one to raise
[2:06:56] my hand
[2:06:57] hey folks i'll raise my hand lord i've
[2:06:59] gotten too calloused
[2:07:02] too calloused
[2:07:04] too hard in my heart
[2:07:06] amen
[2:07:08] he'll speak to you
[2:07:10] amen in everything
[2:07:14] praise be to god
[2:07:17] remember we're going to live with him
[2:07:18] the third thing is the third stage of it
[2:07:21] all is that he is going to have the
[2:07:23] preeminence in his people
[2:07:25] and the next thing is what
[2:07:30] in revelations 22
[2:07:33] they shall be my people and i shall be
[2:07:35] their god we will once again
[2:07:38] be with him he was was with us
[2:07:41] in one body form
[2:07:43] just among so many people but then he's
[2:07:46] going to be with all of his saints of
[2:07:48] all the ages
[2:07:50] amen
[2:07:52] praise be to god so we see brothers and
[2:07:54] sisters how that
[2:07:56] he's looking to inhabit now
[2:07:59] i want to talk about the other
[2:08:00] habitation
[2:08:02] the other habitation is
[2:08:04] that in the age that we're living in we
[2:08:07] know that the prophet god said
[2:08:10] and i just read it this morning but he
[2:08:13] talked about how that because of
[2:08:16] music
[2:08:18] because of
[2:08:20] mostly a lot a lot of it was because of
[2:08:21] music
[2:08:23] and then of course women not dressing
[2:08:25] right and so forth at all begin at the
[2:08:27] same time
[2:08:28] and i guess elvis they called him the
[2:08:30] king of rock and roll he was one of the
[2:08:32] first to come out in that right he was
[2:08:34] one of the first to come out and do that
[2:08:35] rock thing them and the beatles and so
[2:08:37] forth they come out and
[2:08:40] i've read the histories and they'd say
[2:08:42] that right after that rock and roll was
[2:08:45] let loose and even better bam says one
[2:08:48] little song you know that they let
[2:08:50] through and they didn't censor
[2:08:52] oh my how many knows there is no
[2:08:55] censorship of nothing anymore that is
[2:08:57] way
[2:08:58] gone
[2:09:02] man folks they used to have policemen
[2:09:03] out on the beaches make sure everybody's
[2:09:06] bathing suit was so low and so long huh
[2:09:09] there ain't no sensors
[2:09:12] but what did it do it opened up the
[2:09:14] floodgates of
[2:09:16] hell there was a whole lot of rape there
[2:09:20] was a whole lot of brutal
[2:09:22] killings that happened
[2:09:25] that escalated on a massive scale as
[2:09:28] soon as that rock and roll came out
[2:09:30] what did it do it opened up for demon
[2:09:33] powers to come out
[2:09:35] and brother bam said the lid had come
[2:09:37] off of hell
[2:09:42] i mean those all of our politics all of
[2:09:44] that stuff there ain't nothing but more
[2:09:46] demons coming out
[2:09:48] inhabiting and getting into people you
[2:09:50] see it in churches you see it in the
[2:09:52] nation you see it in the government you
[2:09:54] see it in churches you see it in
[2:09:56] preachers you see it in the
[2:09:58] congregations hello
[2:10:02] it opened up the floodgate
[2:10:06] and it became
[2:10:08] revelations 18 says it this way and
[2:10:11] after these things i saw another angel
[2:10:12] come down from heaven having great power
[2:10:15] and the earth was lightened with his
[2:10:18] glory
[2:10:19] amen i believe brahman said that was the
[2:10:22] angel of this hour
[2:10:23] that angel had come down and the earth
[2:10:26] was lightened with his glory seven times
[2:10:30] around the world isn't that right
[2:10:32] healing campaigns like never before how
[2:10:35] many semi loads of cots and stretches
[2:10:38] amen in one of the meetings that they
[2:10:40] took either india africa in that right
[2:10:42] going down the street the whole city in
[2:10:45] the shutdown
[2:10:47] whole city shut down worshipping the
[2:10:49] lord the next day amen with those trucks
[2:10:52] going out there and hauling them all
[2:10:53] away and all of them singing only
[2:10:55] believe well we were almost in heaven
[2:10:58] we were ready for the rapture it was
[2:11:00] almost rapture time can you imagine
[2:11:03] i don't know about you but i love to
[2:11:05] been down them streets with them
[2:11:07] i don't love to been there just to feel
[2:11:11] the atmosphere
[2:11:13] of god
[2:11:15] so powerful
[2:11:17] healed all those people
[2:11:19] so many gave their lives to god
[2:11:22] the earth lightened
[2:11:24] with his glory
[2:11:28] but how many knows the church world
[2:11:30] didn't accept
[2:11:31] jesus christ in this hour they flat
[2:11:34] turned him away
[2:11:38] and because of it
[2:11:39] verse 2 happened and he cried with him
[2:11:42] mightily with a strong voice saying
[2:11:45] babylon is fallen nominal babylon means
[2:11:49] confusion
[2:11:52] all these 900 different churches which
[2:11:55] one is right it's confusion
[2:11:58] and those church world the church world
[2:12:01] fell how many knows is because the
[2:12:02] church world fell
[2:12:04] it's because sin is white sin the wave
[2:12:06] of sin came in
[2:12:08] the church is the type of the moon and
[2:12:09] when that let down and when they fell it
[2:12:11] let the flood of the streams come in
[2:12:15] and if you aren't founded upon the rock
[2:12:17] folks
[2:12:18] i don't care if you're a christian 30
[2:12:20] years
[2:12:22] you can be a preacher we've had
[2:12:24] preachers in this message preached
[2:12:25] probably 30 years i don't know how long
[2:12:27] go deny the prophet deny it speak evil
[2:12:30] of it and everything walk away
[2:12:32] you never had it
[2:12:34] a son of god cannot blaspheme the holy
[2:12:36] ghost
[2:12:38] you was faking it
[2:12:40] he was an imposter
[2:12:44] that's what she was
[2:12:46] you don't you don't walk away not a son
[2:12:48] of god god doesn't god doesn't make a
[2:12:50] son of god like that
[2:12:51] and then let him go like that no it
[2:12:53] don't happen that way god isn't that
[2:12:54] foolish
[2:12:55] when he makes the son and daughter of
[2:12:57] god it's for eternity
[2:12:58] he'll hold you he that has begun a good
[2:13:01] work will finish it but now he have all
[2:13:03] kinds of imposters marriages sometimes
[2:13:06] all of a sudden the wife or the husband
[2:13:08] to go out into the world
[2:13:10] huh
[2:13:13] folks i believe that's a lot of times we
[2:13:15] don't have the victory that we do we
[2:13:16] don't have what we do because we get it
[2:13:18] on the flesh and we get it on the spirit
[2:13:21] but if he goes to that soul
[2:13:24] it has to go to that soul and change
[2:13:26] that thing
[2:13:28] amen all right babylon
[2:13:32] and that confusion that great is fallen
[2:13:35] is fallen and is become the habitation
[2:13:39] not of god but of devils
[2:13:43] how many believes that's exactly the
[2:13:44] truth
[2:13:45] now people are inhabited by the devils
[2:13:49] instead of god
[2:13:50] god has a place he inhabits the devil as
[2:13:52] a place that he inhabits
[2:13:55] praise be to god
[2:13:56] and the hold of every foul spirit
[2:14:06] our
[2:14:07] church up in elkin
[2:14:10] and folks are going to have to have a
[2:14:11] vote take a vote whether they want to
[2:14:12] have homosexual preachers
[2:14:15] but he got them through that place out
[2:14:17] i'd be going so fast if they thought
[2:14:19] about taking the vote

[2:14:24] going to pray about it y'all pray about
[2:14:26] it i'm going to leave about it

[2:14:38] you even think about it you're telling
[2:14:40] me i don't need to be anywhere close to
[2:14:42] this place it's the hold of every foul
[2:14:45] unclean spirit
[2:14:50] i'm sorry folks but i was watching a
[2:14:52] helicopter going over across us here the
[2:14:54] other day

[2:14:59] protecting me oh my lord i know they
[2:15:02] don't want to die they're going to run

[2:15:07] ought to be in the military until
[2:15:08] they're ready ready to die

[2:23:15] they think it they desire it and if they
[2:23:17] ever get the power to do it they'll do
[2:23:19] it
[2:23:20] because you are not in a welcome world
[2:23:22] we're not welcome here
[2:23:23] you'll never think you are
[2:23:26] and remember these unclean birds and so
[2:23:28] forth he says but there's another angel
[2:23:30] that went out and said come on my people
[2:23:33] and just before that basically says
[2:23:36] because the kings of the earth and the
[2:23:37] merchants of the earth they have been
[2:23:39] waxed rich through the
[2:23:40] abundance of her delicacies
[2:23:44] folks when you think goodnight this

[2:23:48] through that prostitute that
[2:23:51] catholic church you're going to own all
[2:23:53] the gold of the world they're going to
[2:23:54] have your money they're going to have
[2:23:55] your pocketbook

[2:24:01] abundance of these
[2:24:04] delicate thieves of this world keep it
[2:24:06] with the fellowship of the father amen
[2:24:09] don't get so caught up with the
[2:24:11] delicacies of this world that you allow
[2:24:12] the holy spirit to drown out
[2:24:18] we get so busy we can't come to church
[2:24:22] oh i know how many knows when you don't
[2:24:24] make it to church the holy spirit
[2:24:25] screams at you what's wrong with you why
[2:24:27] can't you go what's your cheap excuse
[2:24:29] but we shut that out no this is
[2:24:30] important
[2:24:34] is that all right
[2:24:36] well maybe he don't you but he does me
[2:24:39] and i believe he'll do every christian
[2:24:41] that way you're filled with the holy
[2:24:43] ghost you can't wait for them doors to
[2:24:44] open
[2:24:45] oh i understand an ox being in a ditch
[2:24:47] but that box better be pretty stuck
[2:24:51] you love the lord i believe you do
[2:24:54] amen listen to what he said i read this
[2:24:57] unwelcome world though we be in a place
[2:24:59] where we're hated we're called
[2:25:00] scandalous nations what difference does
[2:25:02] it make we ought to have our chin up
[2:25:04] just like that slave remember that slave
[2:25:06] that was a slave and yet he worked hard
[2:25:09] he walked with his chest out now we
[2:25:11] don't walk like that
[2:25:13] like that like brother brown says chin
[2:25:14] up and chest out that's kind of proud
[2:25:16] it's a figure of speech you understand
[2:25:19] because a real humble christian walks
[2:25:20] with his head down wheat blood
[2:25:22] humble and so forth but at the same time
[2:25:25] down in here you're proud that your king
[2:25:28] your father is the king of a tribe
[2:25:31] isn't that right hey man you walk the
[2:25:33] way that you are
[2:25:35] wait what you act like you should
[2:25:37] because you're a child of the king
[2:25:41] amen we're going to heaven we're going
[2:25:43] to walk the streets of god we're going
[2:25:45] to be with
[2:25:46] god let's act like it
[2:25:49] let's talk like it let's walk like it
[2:25:51] let's live like it let's think like it
[2:25:53] everything we do every breath we take
[2:25:56] it's like a child of god son of god the
[2:25:58] daughter of god
[2:26:00] quit this wish you're watching us
[2:26:03] assisting us
[2:26:08] oh my
[2:26:10] trying to build
[2:26:12] something he can happen
[2:26:14] that's god there
[2:26:16] and you realize
[2:26:18] it's the greatest mystery there is
[2:26:21] i'll give you the scripture for it is
[2:26:23] that all right
[2:26:31] finishing off
[2:26:34] but says christ in you
[2:26:37] makes him the center of the revelation
[2:26:41] see and christ in you makes you the
[2:26:43] complete revelation of the whole thing
[2:26:47] i never could understand that phrase too
[2:26:48] well but it's the truth
[2:26:50] the greatest mystery the mystery of it
[2:26:52] all
[2:26:54] is that god
[2:26:56] is in you
[2:26:58] the world says ah that's just a
[2:27:00] christian ah he's just a christian you
[2:27:02] don't realize that's god
[2:27:04] how you treat him is how you treat god
[2:27:07] he is the light of that area
[2:27:09] you are the light of the world let me
[2:27:11] believe that
[2:27:12] a scripture for it's found here
[2:27:14] colossians 1 verse 25 wherefore i may
[2:27:17] the minister
[2:27:18] according to the dispensation of god
[2:27:20] which is given to me for you
[2:27:22] to fulfill the word of god
[2:27:24] even the mystery which has been hid from
[2:27:26] ages and from generations but now is
[2:27:28] made manifest to his saints
[2:27:31] to whom god would make known what is the
[2:27:34] riches of the glory of this mystery
[2:27:36] amongst the gentiles what is this
[2:27:38] mystery which is
[2:27:41] christ
[2:27:42] in
[2:27:44] you
[2:27:45] the hope of glory
[2:27:48] it's the mystery they don't even know
[2:27:49] about
[2:27:50] they don't know what's going on
[2:27:53] but that's the great secret the great
[2:27:55] mysteries that god
[2:27:56] was going to dwell in you
[2:28:00] and in me
[2:28:03] and what does that do
[2:28:05] it tells you who you are
[2:28:07] that you're part of the program of
[2:28:09] almighty god
[2:28:11] and not part of this other
[2:28:12] habitation of devils
[2:28:14] unclean and hateful birds
[2:28:17] huh
[2:28:19] religious women
[2:28:22] hair like mine
[2:28:24] tight pants tights blouses whatever
[2:28:27] coming up here behind the pulpit and
[2:28:30] preaching
[2:28:32] huh
[2:28:33] remember the bible forbid every last one
[2:28:35] of them
[2:28:36] every one of those things
[2:28:39] amen
[2:28:40] paul said it's a shame for a woman to
[2:28:42] cut her hair so forth god says it's an
[2:28:45] abomination in the sight of god for a
[2:28:47] woman to wear a garment that pertains
[2:28:49] into a man
[2:28:50] there is no such a thing as women's
[2:28:52] slacks all right that's just what they
[2:28:55] named it so they wouldn't call it a
[2:28:56] man's pants
[2:28:59] huh
[2:29:00] that's right
[2:29:01] but they give them another name
[2:29:04] you love the lord this morning stand
[2:29:05] with me
[2:29:14] since you can come
[2:29:26] with our heads bowed
[2:29:29] eyes closed
[2:29:31] take the scanner of the holy spirit and
[2:29:34] look across your heart
[2:29:40] begin to search your own heart
[2:29:43] ask yourself what kind of fellowship
[2:29:45] do you have with the father
[2:29:48] how much does he speak to you every day
[2:29:52] what does he say
[2:29:56] he has a lot to say to each and every
[2:29:58] one of us
[2:30:00] now how many knows this morning
[2:30:03] that you need to be more sensitive
[2:30:05] to his voice
[2:30:07] and you need to heed
[2:30:09] that voice
[2:30:11] more
[2:30:12] it is in the lack of him telling us i
[2:30:14] truly believe he tells every everybody
[2:30:16] that
[2:30:17] he talks to everybody
[2:30:21] but they don't hear it
[2:30:23] because they're like that prospector
[2:30:26] that had found gold and he was on the
[2:30:27] way home
[2:30:29] and his dog barked and parked at night
[2:30:31] told him many times to shut him he
[2:30:33] wouldn't shut up
[2:30:35] finally took his gun and shot the dog
[2:30:39] and guess what he slept comfortably
[2:30:42] no more dog barking never heard it
[2:30:44] anymore if you're not here at hearing it
[2:30:47] remember you've hudged it
[2:30:50] you've hushed it
[2:30:53] you just don't hear it it's not that it
[2:30:55] isn't there
[2:30:56] until a man knife plunged into his heart
[2:31:00] he woke up for a few seconds before he
[2:31:01] passed away
[2:31:03] we know this story because the man that
[2:31:05] killed him confessed it
[2:31:07] before he died
[2:31:12] let's not be like that prospect or that
[2:31:14] hush
[2:31:15] that voice
[2:31:16] because i guarantee you god will lead
[2:31:18] you in a much greater way this morning
[2:31:22] if you'll hear that voice every time
[2:31:25] and if you'll heed
[2:31:26] that voice every time
[2:31:29] how many raise your hands i want to hear
[2:31:30] that voice more
[2:31:32] god bless you lord jesus we can now come
[2:31:34] before you confessing our faults and our
[2:31:36] failures
[2:31:37] and then lord jesus you're still working
[2:31:39] on us you're still building on us
[2:31:41] and this morning i believe that you have
[2:31:42] worked on the area
[2:31:44] of us
[2:31:46] and our ears
[2:31:48] and our hearing
[2:31:50] being able to hear what you have to say
[2:31:52] to us lord that still small voice that
[2:31:55] little something that tells us what to
[2:31:58] do
[2:31:59] or what we shouldn't do
[2:32:01] if we would just listen
[2:32:02] and to hear that instead of overriding
[2:32:05] it with our own voice and our own
[2:32:06] thoughts
[2:32:07] lord this morning we ask god that you
[2:32:09] look believe every hand forgive us
[2:32:11] of where we have failed to hear you like
[2:32:13] we should and lord from this sunday
[2:32:15] morning on we ask god that you help us
[2:32:18] lord to listen no matter where we are

[2:32:47] because we have learned this morning
[2:32:48] that we need to open our ears to hear
[2:32:51] what the spirit says to us
[2:32:53] along the way not just in church
[2:32:56] but the greater things is going to be
