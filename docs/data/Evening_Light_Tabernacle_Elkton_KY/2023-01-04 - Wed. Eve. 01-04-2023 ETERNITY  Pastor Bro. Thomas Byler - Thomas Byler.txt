into the word God in Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and once again approaching your throne of grace knowing Lord Jesus that you said you'd never leave us nor forsake us even to the end of the world Lord and father we're so grateful that you are still here you're with us you're in US you're leading us you're guiding us Lord Jesus directing his father and we just ask God tonight that you'll bless the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid Upon A harshest Minister we ask God that you just help us to say just what you once said Lord speak to your children feed your sheep tonight and help me just to get out of the way now and bless your people and we do pray for all those that are sick Lord that they would believe with all of their heart as we do that they are well that they're healed Lord Jesus for you have said that by your stripes we are healed Lord and just help them to be you begin to be able to believe that and act as though they are we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen certainly feel for all those I mean they're not feeling so well but let's turn our Bibles in tonight remember Sunday said something about amen we've spoken about times and seasons and things like that dispensations and whatnot but I kind of wanted to speak about eternity amen so amen that's what we want to speak about tonight with the help of the Lord and we're going to certainly be pulling some uh things out of the message the prophet God preached on uh in the future home in the future home but let's and and I want to turn first John first not first John but Saint John if you will will begin with reading a verse in in first John I mean Saint John Saint John then I think I'll also read just comes to mind now and I may turn to that acts 1 if you want to help go over there to acts 1 if you will uh kind of pull that page up okay right there Saint John five and verse 24. verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's pressed from death unto life over in Acts the first chapter amen we want to just kind of blend it together a little bit uh last sermon with this one amen acts 1 and verse 6. and they therefore when they therefore will come together they ask of him saying Lord will that this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times and the seasons which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the other most parts of the earth amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen tonight with the help of the Lord for just a little while I'd like to speak about and on eternity eternity amen and I like this because one place here just capping up recapping here what Jesus was saying he says you know that uh he that he heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but his past amen I want you to pick up that word passed a little bit amen past amen now um you know when when somebody dies we say they passed away is that right and it has the same type of meaning amen that they went from one thing to another amen but you've passed now not just passed into death but you've passed from death and to life um and there's so many scriptures maybe I should just pick up a couple would that be okay I think Paul had another good expression of it when he said in the second chapter of uh Ephesians you hath he quickened who were dead amen you you were dead in trespasses and since we're in times past he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among also we have had our conversation in times in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by nature to Children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love which wherewith he has loved us even when we were dead in sins he hath quickened us amen together with Christ and hath raised us up together and has made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen praise the Lord notice verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which he hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen how many believe that praise be to God now I just want to go back again and read some more Amen in uh Saint this is one scripture that uh talking about how that Jesus said that if you believe his word you have passed from death unto alive now y'all remember the rising of uh Lazarus and so forth when Martha Jesus came to Martha and them and Martha says you know he said says and then said Martha this is in chapter 11 of Saint John but I know and Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou Hat's been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus saith unto her I am the resurrection amen y'all remember what brother bam says that if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you already have the resurrection and the Rapture in you remember that amen it is just a scripture that backs that up because if you've got Christ you've got the resurrection and you're ready amen I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live foreign that Jesus could have said he could have stopped there but he's going to throw throw so to speak a monkey wrench in it he's going to challenge people's faith he goes a little further and he says and who who's whoever is alive we're liveth and believeth in me shall never die now how many knows we as Mortals know that hey you know that's a big word word for this old flesh right here huh but we already know there's a lot of other scriptures he says you know that he came to you know to give us eternal life and to raise us up at the last day so we know that he's talking about the soul isn't that right he's not talking about the feds not a one amen well did the apostles did they die yeah they all died come on folks amen amen he's talking about the soul the Bible says the soul that sinneth it shall surely die amen and even the prophet of God says you know there is no such and I'll read it here probably got to hear there's no such a thing as death to a Christian because death means separation from God that soul will never be separated from God we know that when you take that last breath you don't die you just go from here right under the altar of God right into the presence of God and you're just as live as you ever was you are not going to die amen believe us now this I like that he says can you believe that amen you always liked the challenge as with with believing and so forth now now let me say something else here read one more scripture over here and and at first John and a very very familiar scripture to me I like it a lot in first John 5 and um verse 12 we'll just go to verse 12. he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the Son of God and not life amen now we know that what that's talking about eternal life don't mean they're not alive they're alive but they have a temporary life they're as good as dead isn't that right so without God you're dead there's only one real form of eternal life and that is God's own life and that's what we want to talk about with the help of the Lord tonight and Jesus really emphasized it saying that you know if you uh truly believe on him you have passed from Death not only death but sorrow sadness depression everything that comes along with death you've passed from that how many knows something really happens to a person that gets born again the person that gets filled with the Holy Ghost something takes place that's of Eternal value I'm gonna read some more I just last couple minutes there I just picked it up therefore if that Eternal value is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus when he was here he makes this statement in Saint John 6 and 27 he says therefore labor not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life amen and I'm you know I I just last I'll tell you what it was just been special to me ever Sunday Lord really bless Sunday if you had great two great Services just the atmosphere and I went home and I thought boy I just need more of this you know it's just eternal life and I got to thinking you know so and I think about how busy we get and the things of the natural amen how busy we are about things that's really our is going to pass away and how little we put into the Eternal things that's not going to pass away and Jesus and tells us don't labor so much for that he says but labor for the meat that endures unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for he hath defi him hath the father's seal amen notice how he says in verse 35 Jesus says and says I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst oh my you know this and I'm going to jump around and down in verse 49 he says I am the bread of life your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven If any man eat thereof that a man may eat thereof there we go that makes sense with the rest of it about messed up that a man may eat thereof and not die amen how many glad to be alive tonight I want you to know that if you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have got life in you you don't have to hold it just just breathe the Holy Ghost away from you from it and find out how depressed you get huh how quickly how sorrow sets and how how deflated you get y'all probably have done it a time or two I have huh but when that repentance comes and you receive even back how practice it is amen amen praise the Lord all right so he says that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the bread which came down from heaven If any man eat with this bread and he shall live forever amen and the bread that I will give is my flesh and I will give and I will give for the life of the world that's why even Paul could come back with the with the um the Jailer that had jail them and so forth and he says you know he wanted to repent he says what must I do to believe me to be saved and he says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is that right believe what Jesus Christ was going to do and how did he gave his life for the sins of the world if you believe in that if you believe in him you'll never perish amen praise be to God oh my God that's right that he'll give for the life of this he exists and verily verily I say unto you I'll accept you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you how many believe that this is the only one thing that you can eat the only thing that you can eat and live forever I wanted to speak on something just a little bit on the side but I want to just I felt led to speak on it and that is true appreciation how we truly appreciate having the truth and being able to have a voice and know that we have a voice we have the word that is truth and in the midst of all the voices that are out there huh to know that you have absolute the one thing that we know is absolute truth is this Bible is that right this you don't ever have to question this right here there's a lot of people that might have all kinds of interpretations but you come back to this and then of course uh you know there's another voice that is that that comes forth you know and that would be the fivefold ministry and how many knows that that fivefold Ministry is prophets and pastors and teachers advances and so forth and they are here to tell you what their own ideas well I think no not well I think but the word we're here to bring the word and of course we know that a prophet Amen to me that Prophet is a uh is a Divine revealer of the word he would to me be the highest Authority isn't that right he'd be the highest Authority I don't know nothing but reveal his sequence so he servants the prophets so we have a prophet God vindicates and he proves that Prophet is that right even as he did Paul Paul was a prophet and he wrote the whole new testament and said if an angel from heaven come and preach anything other than what we have preached if he's an angel from heaven let it be a curse so I don't know he says this Bible is the complete Revel the complete revelation of Jesus Christ in other words we haven't had nobody writing any more books lately right not since the time of John being on the islands The Book of Revelations and so forth you know we've had never had that too every it's complete it's a complete revelation of God and anything that anybody ever preaches it has to be and we have heard some crazy stuff I have heard some crazy stuff even the interpretation of the message of the hour you know of the things that people do and what they come up with and everything else isn't that right and the only way that you choose truly know when anybody any preacher is preaching the truth is he saying what that Prophet said is he saying what Paul said is he saying what the Bible says because we don't need to be per says anything different than this right here you have to have the discernment to be able to know whether he is or not amen so I'm thankful tonight for Truth for absolute truth five full minutes read in of course like I said the preachers they preach the word of God they say what the prophet said amen I mean no somebody brother Branham uh you know I don't forget just not just exactly which tape it was lean not to your own understanding or one of them he says you know you don't know how important it is just to save what's on those tapes amen and let me tell you tonight tonight even tonight the things that I'm going to teach here tonight is going to be something that has been uh uh you know I don't want to put you on guard already but has been controversial among some people and so forth but you know I pray for the uh an understanding of what the prophet is trying to say I certainly don't have all of it because you know there was a time when uh there's things that I didn't understand and I was kind of against it I would really uh you but get people preachers would say but later I found out that that's what the prophet said and the way that he taught it but God had to open it up but anyway and uh it has to do with eternity and I'll get to that here in a minute but the next now notice how after that you talk you have preachers we have so forth and then of course we have what I call the inside voice we have an inside voice isn't that right everybody has an inside voice but you know I found that that is a tricky thing because there's always two voices in there uh the carnal of mine is damned if you get there side by side hello then we've had and you've probably known people that you know have thought that you know I I'll tell you what I'm gonna follow the leading of the spirit I feel like I'm following the living of the spirit and so this is what I'm gonna do and end up going and doing that and find that it's a bitter failure huh and that can put you a real question on the leadership or that voice that you listen to right sure so yeah make sure that it's according to the word and you have to search your own heart and say God how did I miss it because I don't want to miss it I mean when you listen to that and you miss it you're really missing it because whatever you got to go by other than that really right there in the word of God because there's a lot of people claim to go by this and it has to you do have to have that voice that still small voice and sometimes the fact of the matter is we don't listen hard enough we don't listen hard enough sometimes amen but no doubt a lot of us can always a lot of us can you know and and that's what you have to exercise yourself in you have to learn to listen to that voice amen say Lord let me let me hear it and the more that you realize many times as a matter of fact just this last week happened to me I had a certain thought certain thing certain way I wanted to do something and so forth but I prayed about it and the Holy Spirit showed me no don't do it that way do it this way and that was less to get in you know what hey it's very easy for you to listen to that other one that flesh voice but yeah you know anytime it's carnal and 10 times it's hateful or whatever it might be anytime it's that way remember that's not God amen praise the Lord another thing I wanted to just uh just just just go before I get started here amen and that is something I uh spoke on a little bit I believe it was uh Sunday and you know I remember I told you I said I had a 24 inches that I wanted to talk to you about where is my other people where did it go you know people are always trying something new they're going here they're going there and there it is way back down here amen and I thought you know I don't never finished it but I said you know if people listen you don't have to go far to get anchored you don't have to go far to find the place you ought to be what is that 24 inches well I don't I didn't take a tape measure to it but I guarantee you there's about 24 inches from here to here all you got to do is go right down there that's the only moving that you got to do amen the holy spirit will show you what you need to do where you need to be in everything else and then it'll stabilize you you've heard of people putting down their roots will go to a place we'll fire we'll start a business we'll buy invest home and some people and man they invest in a certain place until you know there's all kinds of streets around here named after people you know and and so forth people get roads named after because they got root sounds so deep huh but I'll tell you what we really need to do is drop 24 inches and get our roots in Christ Jesus amen praise the Lord Hallelujah all right let's go back to our thoughts so we think about this we think about eternal life and how that Jesus came for the purpose and many times if you'll notice in his preaching I came to give them eternal life let me believe that's what he come for he says I come down from heaven not to do my own will he says but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which he has given me I should lose one or two now I said I would lose nothing so that sermon has to do with not only seeing where you are but who you are is that okay I mean listen to where you are and who you are but should raise it up again at the last day that everyone would see at the Sun and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will the last day no man can come unto me except my Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at last day amen let me go on into uh into this brother banam as you know he was a typologist how many knows that he did a lot of typing and and so forth he had did a lot of typing amen and when he was preaching when he was preaching the uh future home he was preaching to feature home he got to talking about being out of dispensations and not of types and so forth he typed the future home he talked about the earth and the process that it goes through if y'all remember he talked about Noah how that the world got his water baptism isn't that right under Noah and how did it got Sanctified and purchased on Calgary isn't that right it got Sanctified on Calvary by the blood of Jesus Christ and the Earth is still again it's baptism and then brother bam goes talking about dispensation he says now somebody might say that you've run out of your complete dispensation so forth he says now where are you going to go to now you're a dispensationalist but the BAM says which I am and but I believe that God is too notice how uh we we've talked Sunday about times and seasons and we're always living in New Years and New moons and this that and the other and we've come through seven Church ages in that right Seven Stars and we know that their last star now listen to this and put in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God and don't talk about the eighth messenger amen doesn't talk about another age Beyond this we know to lay out I see a church age of course was Revelation 3 they were lukewarm isn't that right uh they had need of nothing rich and increased words and so forth brother Branham talked about how that we're not in the laodicea age I hope you're not in that hope you're not lukewarm wretched miserable poor blind and naked I hope you have had eyes have in that right I hope you snucked on your heart's door and you've opened up you've come over to Revelations 4 amen where it talks about come on up higher he said we're now in an astronaut age we're in a bright age she called it the bride age a different age and in this this is the word you've probably heard this kind of language before but I hope I make sense tonight now notice he says now you've run out of this compensation he says uh now that you're out of dispensational types for you're going to put something what are you going to put beyond that seventh day how are you going to get it where are you going now and I'll tell you what it takes a lot of study going back and forth amen because a lot of times you'll talk about seven days he'll talk about seven Church ages and so forth and I hope that we can halfway put it together all right now call your attention to something amen I ain't out of dismissations yet I've got another scripture here and he goes to uh Leviticus I believe it is 23 amen says and he reads the 36th verse and thou shalt offer offerings made of fire unto the Lord on the eighth day and on the Eighth Day shall be a holy convocation see there's another holy time coming a holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord for assembling now but the man says and this was the scripture now he goes into talking now we got an eighth day how many knows heard a lot of eight day doctrines around here amen amen there's been a lot of different doctrines of us being in the Eighth Day amen so let's see what the brother bam says now there's only seven days but here we speak of the Eighth Day a holy convocation he got it out of of course we know back in the Old Testament we know seven days and those seven feasts they all typed those seven Church ages brother ban him even one place if you remember in the church age book he says that he has given Israel two thousand some years at the same time as what he has given us but at the same time and he also says that they have went through theirs I have an ages now we're going through down Seven Ages amen if you've if you've heard him say that now notice so he's not now does notice do not work see the Eighth Day are what back to the first day again amen which speaks of Eternity all right and as she rolls around with a stopping place now he just touches on it a little bit here you know because how many knows our hearts are turned back to the faith of the fathers isn't that right amen by the band one place he says if you remember he says you know the book of Acts those that church should have taken the rapture and that'd be going on into that perfection they would have taken an option but we know it wasn't the will of God isn't that right so the first thing that happened is the first church what happened they lost the first law and that right there off their first love and notice how the first church age did not start until 53 A.D what happened with the other what about what was the other no time there a lot amen but talks about going back to the eighth day it doesn't go to uh you know it doesn't go really I hate today but it goes back to the first so now notice he says upon this Eighth Day the last day the feast day of Tabernacles after the feast day after the last Church age now notice up here yet said you know uh the seventh day here talks about seventh Church age so you kind of got to know what he's picking up on last Church eight after the seven complete days upon the Earth all right he says after the Millennium that this holy convocation comes I see be up too high I'm like I'm gonna put it down a little bit that I'm catch a lot of wind so how many knows that in time wise we have had 6 000 years is that right and the seventh day all right is going to be this millennium everybody understands that that's real simple easy to believe easy to believe but now notice he says remember the Feast of the Tabernacles of the Gatherings and so forth you know talking about the Millennium and so forth so now notice he says the Sabbath day which speaks of the Old Law which was to pass away the keeping of the Sabbath which passed away changed another he said no does it just change from the old law keeping of a certain day Isaiah said precept must be upon precept here a little there little whole fact that which good for within this family my tongue will I speak to my people and here is the rest see you will enter into life not keeping of a day or a shadow Paul said over Hebrews the fourth chapter you keep days and shadows and things like that I'm scared of your experience see we don't pass into certain days and orders he says you pass from Death unto eternal life so he brings it into what Jesus said not days and times you pass into eternity amen hallelujah there's that's the holy convocation now notice how he talks about a type of the eighth days amen even how many knows there's even after the Millennium there's still a fire amen there's still another battle with the devil and everything else but way over he's talking about Plum over past the Millennium being attacked now this is where it's getting at if you'll take you can I can show you many quotes where he talks any types the experience of the believer and what happens to you is a type of those seven Church ages and then the eighth day amen or the Sabbath day Plum over in the Millennium and pass that seven days switch pass away or I have said will change to another eight days deals with New Creation not all creation eight days will deals with New Creation for it was on the eighth day that our Lord raised from the dead amen now notice how even he ties in Paul's teaching he tells him to Paul teaching about not no rituals of man and no no uh you know you got to do this and laws and all these other things you know you pass from all of that Amen Let me see let me read that real quick Paul said and he may he may uh yeah in Colossians 2 he says in verse 13 and you being dead in your sins and uh and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses and blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the Cross having small principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it therefore let no man therefore judge you and meet or in drink or respect them any holy days or of any new moon new moon or of any Sabbath days which only a shadow things to come amen so let me know that we we actually honored the resurrection as the prophet of God said amen one place he said he wouldn't fish he wouldn't do this he wouldn't do that yet at the same time he said you know if you're way out somewhere you don't have church anywhere to go to if you wanted to hunt a little bit I guess you'd be all right or finish huh why because it's what we can't never go contrary about Paul taught you know but every day how many believe that for a Believer every day is Holy it's holy day every day if this is go back to keeping that Sabbath or you're part of the mark of the beast they want to go back to ordinances and laws and stuff you know Paul says we don't do that anymore we don't even do new moves we're not worried about we're not worried about uh uh we still go through this and this is the big thing this carnal this flesh still in time huh because I looked it up and brother man says we're not in time anymore we're in eternity you gotta understand what he's saying isn't that right another place he says now us creatures of time any prayers are creatures of time you know sure this is still a creature of time but this in here is a creature of Eternity Hallelujah all right I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man all things have passed away how many leaves that now he talks about and if you notice he types it with Revelations 21 when he says I saw a new Heaven and new earth amen Paul said put on the new man didn't he put on the new new man which is renewed after the spirit and so forth you know and cleanse and mortify the Deeds of the flesh get rid of all of that other stuff you know let the Holy Ghost Fire come down and burn it out all right let me just go on all right so now notice there's your convocation you're holding us not considering this sabbath or feast days or so forth amen but it was the Feast of habit or the Pentecost now notice after this having Sabbath seven Church ages Jesus raised from the dead hey which is a holy convocation which is the first day young passed through try time and drop into eternity again keeping of days and Sabbath and new moons like God's past change form amen but passed from Death unto eternal life that's what the Bible teaches is past now again he says in do you don't come by laws and rituals huh I mean how many remembers that brother bam taught he says you know uh all these times and all these dispensations these changes uh it's like a building a wall or a house amen and he says we're building a house not just a wall and God's Building you know and he says any mason can lay on a straight wall but it takes a Mason to turn the corner and how many know that's where the problem is with Humanity they get stuck in a rut to get stuck in a certain age and they can't turn a corner isn't that what happened with Israel you know there were so much in the washing of the pots and the pans and oh you better wash your hands before eating and this out of the other and you don't do this and don't do that they're so stuck in that rut they couldn't turn the corner when Christ come on the scene Jesus said that unless you believe that I am here you will die in your unbelief or your sins now right so they couldn't turn the toner every time even all the way up to uh it might have been went to every Church you don't know whether it was a Methodist a Lutheran the lutherans when Wesley come along they just got stuck in that rut amen because he said you know every last one of them would have been turned to uh Westlands and then to West and all of them if they had turned the corner did it become Pentecost because God was always turned into corner amen all the way to Pentecost Nomine knows that even Pentecost couldn't turn the corner even though God himself would come down and vindicate himself and prove himself alive like you did they just couldn't accept it because they wanted to stick to their you know speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost if you don't believe that I don't care how much Jesus comes to your search we're not coming and we don't believe it that's basically what they said in action isn't that right because they said anybody goes to another man meetings of us will actually communicate he don't believe that I didn't see evidence of the Holy Ghost you talk about terrible that's a terrible thing amen turn the corner God keeps turning a corner and even from laodicea I mean he's turned the corner God has come out of her my people how many is part of that part of that come out of her my people you're my bride you're my church You're The Virtuous unadulterated pride of Jesus Christ if you believe every job every table we've called back amen not to some station and remember on the tapes back there I wanted to get it and I didn't I forgot to but on the tapes back there on the back of that little card it talks about I didn't call you to church I didn't call you to follow me or start another church or do this that or the other I came to bring a fellowship between man and God he came to bring us to God amen point us to Christ not some other not a new church age or something amen so you don't come by laws and rituals and orders and you come by predestination that's there's the genuine holy convocation and we're ending this Evans church age the Pentecostal age you see it we're entering into that Holy convocation we are ending into that real genuine eternity amen how many flat to be in eternity have eternal life amen where the church is called not not some station not some denomination but into eternity where there each with their Eternal King amen oh my there's no such a thing as days and things and times and so forth you've passed into eternity where you come from you is there to begin with amen listen he says if you've got eternal life there's only one form and that's God and you by and express you're not gonna be there anyhow oh sometimes I think better better he said one place he says you know if we would really grasp if this would all come flooding down in wheatgrass but he says the Rapture would take place didn't he we just we could translate it if you just really comprehend all this you're not sitting there by accident you're not sitting there by chance oh I just happen to be here no you did not happen by no means to be here and if you can believe the word of God you did not happen to be able to believe it that was something that God had ordained before the world ever began that's why you're sitting Where You Are that's why you have eternal life that's why there is something down there to Quicken because he thought of you before there was ever a stardust before there was anything expressed that you be if you're not you're not gonna be there anyhow because no man can come unto me except my father's draws him see which passes away and all these old things but these things don't he says he speaks of Eternity the Holy Ghost is eternal then you are in eternity where you was all the time amen but you just recognize what happened I believe it's in here also the brother Brown talks about he says you know you weren't saved on a certain day oh yeah we sing the song yeah I can take you two time and I can take you to please where the Lord Save Me by his wonderful Breeze I can take you to the time and I can take you to the place where I recognize what God did for me where I accept that what God had already done for me that's what you can point but you was wrote down in the last book of life before the world was ever made if you're ever going to make it your name was there then if you're a Christian and your life is absolutely tallying up and you know that you're one of yours what that ought to do to you amen it ought to be like but it's bad it says every day with God it's a new day every day it's a new start I thought of that song something about um every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true every morning his mercies are new he's fresh it's good it's every morning amen praise the Lord oh my my how I'd like to get you know but you know better brand believed in justify bye State Sanctified state but God if you're here she'll bring you to a holy ghost baptism State isn't that right he'll fill you with that baptism of the Holy Ghost some people it may deliver on the edges but not really into that Shekinah Glory I I'm so glad that you ain't got to just come to church to be in the Shekinah Glory uh you could be in that Shekinah Glory Wherever You Are your car at your work wherever it is in the woods you can get so full and so join in that and not until you'll run around a tree like the prophet did that's your kind of Glory is with you are in eternity time don't mean anything we're just waiting for this to play out amen because we know the seventh Church Aid in this world goes all the way to the end amen but in this in this age God catches us up and brings us back into eternity where he was to begin with praise the Lord oh my you now notice you just recognize what happened see you were made for an eternal purpose you as the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that that of you and expressed Hallelujah look at each other look at each other I'm looking at an expressed attribute of God I'm looking at an ex expressed attribute of God God thought of you before the foundation of the world and you are sitting here an expression of a thought that makes you feel good it makes your blood run blood through your veins a little better hallelujah thank you pass away you can't fail more than he can fail because it's him doing it in the first place what did Jesus say he says I will lose nothing come to me and I will lose Glory I won't lose a one yeah we could close church we had Church Folks lose a one hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord for being let me be part of that expressed attribute thank you Lord for bringing me into an eternity I ain't got to be in some Amish ritual huh I was past the buggy tonight in the dark and one little land I said there they go live or die we're gonna do what we believe we're gonna run through the dark a little video left Chuck my Chuck come over the hill and run me over hey that's just part of our religion they died for their belief bless them Lord they failed to turn the corner isn't that right they failed to move on with God same with Mennonite all the way up to Pentecost people fail to move on with God huh amen that genuine eternity the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost all right so now notice now notice you are the manifestation of the attribute that was in God thought of you and expressed you and he made the Earth to take you out of he made you a human being and sin come along okay I'm supposed to have one other one here it is right back here this is what I'm looking for next now notice he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being isn't that what he did to Adam he dust took dust and made Adam is that right put him in the body because he was wanting to have sons and daughters of God he knew he'd have sons and daughters of God so he came and redeemed you while sin come along and perverted his way you come on you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he come to redeem that to redeem you the express attribute and also and also redeems his Earth by the same way then his purpose rolls oh well and see hallelujah oh that does me so much good just think of what lays ahead see Heaven and Earth have met God and man is reconciled how many believe that sure everything that Adam lost we have rights to again let me believe that our thinking on this at home studying and I thought we ask ourselves well then why ain't I moving mountains why ain't I speaking to this and telling that to do this and telling that to that well why aren't you well why aren't you the prophet did he stopped storms he stopped Bulls he stopped Hornets he created squirrels and he was our example now wasn't he but how many knows he didn't do that of his own and I think that's the way it was we met with Adam he just don't do all of its own oh my get me going here but he did it as the Holy Spirit led him to do it and he could stop storms he could stop bulls and I want you to know that in our Spirits we are redeemed how many believe you're redeemed you're Redeemed by God we have been given the ministry of reconciliation be reconciled to God Paul said we've been reconciled the only thing the only problem is flesh still huh it's not redeemed huh it still has to be redeemed and we're going to look right now at how that's going to happen is that okay God and man is reconciled a restored Eden has begun see now now all the curse is gone now notice over there in the new heavens and Nerf all the curse is gone just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Spirit accepts you amen can I talk about first to take some time talk about the the the curse being gone the curse being gone God never did curse Adam did he he cursed the ground right he cursed the ground it'll bring thorns and thistles Nevada sweated eyebrow now what was Adam made of dirt that's why at that time I mean those at that time things went from immortality to horse from immortality trees all the animals huh everything all done hard everything was Immortal it was you know because he's taking this back to Eden there's nothing going to die the trees will be Evergreen everything will be all green you'll live forever ain't gonna be no fall over there huh but at that time when he cursed that he cursed his body also his body came under the curse of what death he lived for a long time yet but the Earth was cursed his body was cursed and that's when he got old how many knows when it's the curses lifted these bodies will do what again change I mean it was Adam's Body changed and the Rapture comes your body will change if you're alive and remain your body will change brother Brian go back to the color of hell you had at 20. huh mind same way cut back to 20 to go back just like He restored Abraham curse will be gone praise be to God but notice how he says the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Spirit accepts you all right let me skip over here a little bit see you was born in sin but God had that attribute here you express yourself here on Earth and he comes down and he gets you let me believe that even the woman that dwell she was in bad shape but she was expressed attributes she had to see dinner there's something to Quicken and the Holy Spirit come down and found her see you're back here here's where you belong sin lost its power that's right the desire of her sin done gone from your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in amen you are a restored person he says and then when the earth is restored by the same way there can be no more cursing no more storms no more winds no more typhoons rather you reconcile God a man has met no Grace no tear drops no blood checks you'll never moisten the tear and so forth now notice even the desert will bring forth Blossom as a rose at all sticky I'm gonna say that old sticky attitude we have huh well Blossom one day like a rose when she's redeemed when she takes her fire baptism there's all kinds of cactus and stickers and everything now but she's got a fire baptism coming like the man was when he still had hatred and Malice Strife until that fire baptism come and cleaned it off no more jealousy no more nothing to desire for sin away it takes some meanness away I got wrote down here he'll take a man and make a gentleman he'll take a woman and he'll take make a lady out of her that's what the Holy Ghost does amen takes man Beast man no matter how bad the man is no matter how bad the woman is to make a lady out of you make a gentleman out of her praise be to God aren't you glad that's why he says put a little sway lying and all these things from you let the Holy Ghost burn all them things out amen we want to come down to a close here oh my get all of that out it's just it's a type when the fire baptism came no no no he cleaned it off there's no more jealousy no more nothing it's just absolutely the dwelling place for God when you're sitting on your rocker when you're driving down your car or wherever you are remember you are the dwelling place how many believe that how many dwelling points do you have Hallelujah I like it let me go back and pick up just one more before I finalize on this here quote now notice Ephesians it calls it the fullness of time when the fullness of time has come that's when time is fulfilled there is no more time you go over into eternity after the seventh Church age is over now it has in a parenthesis and it is I don't know what the parenthesis is if there's somebody putting that in there it means the whole thought of it so I'd have to go back and listen to the tape let me knows you have to watch that stuff but it says and it is Luther's age is over Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is over amen and now you go into what eternity no more sevens threes he turned eternity whether it's no such such things as numbers and times amen I mean think about it after seven Church age what's next millennium amen as far as we're concerned when you get saved all of those things pass by now notice now all sin is gone and taken away at the Millennium at the great white Throne judgment a type notice how he always types it a type of the Holy Ghost after the world is on fire and baptized it's baptism of fire from heaven all sin is gone all germs is gone all Devils is gone all Temptations is gone all evil is here gone type now then what does God do he can set up on the earth because all sin is gone how many blocks Christian's not supposed to have no devil on him you can have a devil in the flesh but you better not have a devil in the spirit huh because you're a lot of trouble if the devil's in the spirit devil of cancer devil of any kind can be on the flesh but not on the spirit we're called We're called to what cast out devils oh cast out sin cast out all of these other things resist temptation amen resisted the devil he'll fly flee from you there's no devils amen are you with me he says now notice because all sin is gone he's talking about after the milim that's the same thing he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism of fire he can come and bow with you and then we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are already oh my in that rather bad we are already in him not just will be in heaven but we are already in heaven please thank you for the time you've been saying that and been doing that YouTube y'all y'all listen to brother Tommy YouTube y'all it's really good I appreciate it amen you got brother Danny tomorrow night it's happening let's not forget that amen not we will be we are now sitting in G esus how do we get into it by one baptism amen Valerie aren't you glad the fire's already been and it's cleaned out all the germs well now it goes good there's a fire coming second Peter three Heaven's being on fire the Earth will be element shall felt melt with fervent heat but a bam says the gases that are up there we'll catch on fire now how many knows that scientists are worried about the ozone layer and all this gas and stuff that's building up up there huh yeah maybe it is building up it's building up all this polluting building up things gonna get hot around here folks but I want you to know it's already got hot right here I hope it's gotten hot right there and it's burned out every germ everything that's evil out of your your life because if it is if you're gonna stay here and it's going to get burnt that's what the prophet said if you've got no things in your heart remember you're going to be in the heart of the fire because all those things are going to get burnt so we can um we can gladly hopefully each and every one of us can say I'm glad and I'm happy because I'm standing why are you so happy little brother huh a little big sister was saying I'm happy because I'm standing where the fire has already been amen all right same thing when he gives you the Holy Ghost now notice again he mentions all germs is gone makes it a fit place then for the Heavens to dwell here on Earth type now of sitting in heaven places in Christ Jesus pass from just dirty like the woman was into the expressed attribute of God now while we're talking about that I'm going to read what he's typing it with Revelations 21 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth and the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more seed and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God now how many knows that that does type the spiritual because God is not just with us but he's in us already he's already tabernacled in you and in me he made all things new amen there's a new man amen who wasn't saying that oh it was brother Glenn singing that song he says you know that old man is dead amen praise the Lord and God so my ball tears from them from their eyes and there shall be no more death nor sorrow nor quietly nor shall be any more for the former things are passed away no notice pass from just dirty like the woman was too and that would be God now are we sons of God not we will be we're the attributes of your thinkings thinking sin all gone Millennium not said it's time for the Holy Spirit takes its place amen when he does he passes from Death unto life it passes from Death unto life dwelling in Heavenly places in Christ in his glorious presence even physical death will pass away then just as spiritual death has passed away now there is no such thing as spiritual death now to a baptized saint of God Amen though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die all scriptures must be fulfilled you see you can't die you've got eternal life the only thing is the Redeemer has made you recognize this and you always was that that's the reason that you see the date that you're living in amen how many believe that it takes the Holy Spirit to Quicken to you the hour and the voice and the word for your hour otherwise you'd be say well no we got to be the Amish we got to be Mennonite we got to be Pinnacle we gotta be this that or the other if he wasn't but if you're an Express attribute you'll recognize a day that you are living in in closing now notice and remember people that are washed people that are clean people that had scoured out he says brother bam says yeah let me just say let me just read it like the man was and he still had had written malice and strife when fire baptism come and cleaned it off no more jealousy no more nothing it's just absolutely a dwelling place for God and remember that's his delegation that's going to meet him over there how many believe that that's who is going in the Rapture those who have already experienced the fire baptism and have went over into eternity amen all sin gone all doubt gone all of that gone just simply up dwelling please for God Amen that's not just a story that's the truth that's what the ba the bride goes to amen God bless you stand with me if tonight if you will musicians if you'll come in closing there's a couple more things I wanted to do but I'm just going to do this one and that is I was thinking of how I was speaking Sunday a little bit about our past and how that in order to get it for gotten now how many knows it God can forget your past when he drops in his bleach he goes in his past and he don't remember it no more over in Revelations the Bible says and God has remembered her iniquities that great Harlot before he judges her double her and so forth according to what she said God remembers her iniquities but God doesn't remember your iniquities however you probably as long as you live will remember your past is that right see when we get to heaven the Bible says the former things will not come to mind he won't be remembered anymore so the Bible says that even you over there won't have to worry about well you know I remember back on earth when I did this how many would say I don't want to remember that you know I don't know if they need a good thing but he says a lot all of that will be gone out of your mind the devil might try to play with you here but over there it'll be gone however on the other flip side of things in Hell remember the rich man was in hell and he remembered that Abraham reminded him of how he had it right and how Lazarus needed and so forth and he remembered everything I'd ever done that's what's going to torment people in Hell their memory won't be gone they'll remember how that they turned God away they'll remember all their bad they're all that memory because your memory how many of you remember it can haunt you amen that's why if he gets under the blood you'll be fine you can just tell the quit fishing and then you're late but for people that are lost remember they'll remember it over on that side and all through hell as long as they're in Hell they'll remember that and it'll be a torment to him amen aren't you glad that it can be gone in the sea of God's forgetfulness amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and we just think of what we have said tonight Lord and what your word has said father of who we are not only who we are but where it is that you have taken as Lord that is Paul we don't have to fear death we don't have to worry about dying there is no such a thing as death to a Christian Lord when we get to the other side Lord you'll have a brand new body for us Lord and we know that this coat Lord will change one of these days we which are alive and remain and father our hearts desire tonight is God we want to be part of that delegation Lord that the fire has come and it has taken all these things out of us Lord if we still see these things in US Lord I pray God if there's someone in here Lord there's still got things in their life that they know they can't go in the Rapture world may they raise your hands they gotta take it out of me take it out Lord let the fire consume it Lord May that desire of it completely go away by the fire of almighty God the Holy Spirit give me the desire of Eternal things Lord Jesus give me a case for Eternal things Lord give me everybody here and everybody out there streaming Lord just now father hearing my voice I ask God that you'd give us all of them a greater desire to eat from the meat and to labor for the meat that don't perish Lord for the Eternal things Lord and let loose a little bit of those things that are just so Temple God help us Lord Jesus so that we might be ready to be your delegates when you come Lord to take us Lord to that home beyond the sky we ask God In The Name of Jesus Christ each one father hearing this Lord will raise your hand and now and say God take all of the world out of me take the love of the world out of me Lord Lord the desire of the Health's more this and more that God take it away help me that I want more of you Lord and more of your spirit more of your power Lord Closer to You Lord helping God to feed on the things that are eternal father if we ask God that
