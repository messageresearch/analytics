[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning brothers and sisters if we'll just all stand this morning just bow our heads before the Lord and maybe brother Joe will open us in prayer this morning ch are said we you BL amen the children can be dis dismissed for Sunday school so good to be in the house of the Lord this morning if we'll go in the Psalms Psalms 130 just a few verses here Psalms 130 out of the depths have I Cried unto thee Oh Lord if thou Lord should us Mark iniquities oh Lord who shall stand I wait for the Lord my soul doth wait and in his word do I hope let Israel hope in the Lord for with the Lord there is Mercy and with him is plenteous redemption and he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities God bless you may be seated brother Brian Lord bless you all I was that U forgive me here that one verse I'm used to hold in a mic that one verse where it said we were reading in 130 if the Lord should Mark my iniquity the Lord who shall stand and that's a pretty pretty awesome statement there you know it's if we actually realize who we really are if it wasn't for the grace of Jesus Christ this morning we'd be in trouble this morning and the scripture like that that tells you that your only hope is to cllean closer to Jesus Christ this morning that your iniquities would be forgiven if you would turn with me uh back to uh the 15th Psalm I was reading that this morning doing the while I'm well ahead in the daily devotional but um I'll give you a chance to get there I know I once I start I don't stop but uh if you'll turn to the 15th Psalm this morning I never give you all a chance to get there and it's a short one too and it says Lord who shall abide in thy Tabernacle and who shall dwell in thy Holy Hill and then I of course as all good Christians as you are you're saying me in my heart I will because God has touched me and he that walketh uprightly and walketh righteousness worketh right righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart so you're not deceived in your own Spirit you know who you are you know what you are and you know what you need need to do daily to be there on that day and he goes on to say here he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbor nor taketh up reproach against his neighbor he lives those Christian virtues basically when I read a passage like that I think of those Christian virtues you you live you live those Christian virtues again I I would say that but without the Holy Ghost and without the presence of Jesus Christ can you live those virtues probably not but once you have that presence in your heart and life you're more than able to re live those virtues do you not fall sometimes yes of course you're going to fall but you get right back up again and you keep walking forward you know that's the difference between a good fighter and a bad fighter is a good fighter will always get back up again and get back in the fight a weak man would just stay there and lay out and the worst thing about a weak man he's the guy that hides behind the tree and he's the guy that hides behind the cover when everyone else is engaging forward and we aren't those kind of Christians here this morning you're going to be in the thick of the battle fighting against the enemy of yourself and the enemy of your brothers and sisters and he goes on to say here in in whose eyes in whose eyes a vile person is condemned but he honth therein fearth the Lord Heath sarth to his own hurt and CH and changeth not now when I read that that's what I was reading this morning what it has to say about when a man or a woman gives a vow this is what he said here he that sth to his own hurt so if you make a promise to the Lord or you make a promise to your family you make a promise to your brothers and sisters you will do whatever you promised even though you know it'll hurt your yourself might hurt you financially might hurt you physically when you give a vowel when you say you're going to do something you'll do it no matter what it costs you you're going to do it and it's you can take it back into salvation again whatever it cost you you're going to cast it all the s side so you can embrace the cross and Jesus Christ this morning and and the last verse it says who putteth not his money to user nor taketh reward against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved and it re really was striking this morning I'm going to if you would turn with me uh to if I didn't lose my place this morning to Galatians the 5th chapter when when I read a scripture like that or when I read the Psalms that brother Choy read I go to in my mind in the Bible I go to places that that second that opinion or second those thoughts that reinforce those thoughts this morning and I am totally off what I was going to say this morning but um Paul had to say this uh this is where the negative is and the positive is I'm I'm going to read the positive I won't we all know what the negative is but this is what Paul had to say and it and it has to do with our lives and I'll start at about uh about the U sixth verse for if Jesus Christ neither circumcision prevaileth anything or uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love so everything we do by faith is in love this morning and it goes on you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth so Paul you know I I say this a lot Paul's Ching talking to a church that is already starting to fall already people are contending with each other church is already starting to contend even in this day and he goes on the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you it doesn't come from Jesus Christ it comes from man's Wisdom and man's ways um little 11 uh a little 11th the whole lump I have confidence you through the Lord that you will be none otherwise minded that he that troubles you shall bear his judgment whoever whoever so he be and I Brethren if I yet preach C circum decision you do I yet Surfer persecution then is the offense cross ceased I would not even cut off trouble you for Brethren you have been called on to Liberty only not use your Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but to love and serve one another and not thinking of circumcision here just thinking of all the things the world is trying to put on you and force you to do that have nothing to do with walking a Christian Life this morning and basically Paul's saying anything any man any organization anything that's trying to take you away from the cross and from the true word of God you just got to cast it all away this morning and I lost my place there I would then even cut off when you Trav for bre and you have been called onto Liberty only use not that Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but love and serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor as thyself and I I'm G to and it says if you bite and devour one another take heed least you be consumed one another and that's what goes out there in the world it shouldn't be among the Church of Jesus Christ but out there in the world that's what's going on right now but I'm going to jump past the bad part and finish at the started at about the 22nd verse this morning but this is the fruit of the spirit this is what should be in my life should be in our lives this morning not the bad stuff it should be the good stuff this morning but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness and gentleness is something I I got to raise my hand as I get older Janette tells me all the time she sees a little bit of my father in me and I try to keep that away uh gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law as long as God abides in your heart and life this morning in the spirit of Christ these things will will manifest thems from you and if you don't see these things manifesting then you just got to go back to the beginning again and I lost my place there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust and if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be my pronunciation desirous of vain Glory provoking one another to eving one another that's one thing that shouldn't be in the Church of God is we shouldn't be envying another man's what another man has or what another man doesn't have but I was going to jump over here I think I got the right place you don't have to turn to it but I was reading this morning over there and it it this Parable really speaks to the day and age that we living this morning and then I'm going to sit down this is in the uh 13th chapter of Matthew it's the 45th verse and it says and again the Kingdom of Heaven is liken onto a merchant man seeking Godly pearls who when he was found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it so that really speaks to us are we willing to sell everything that we have this morning are we willing to cast off everything that we have this morning to possess that Pearl and we all know what that Pearl is that's the very presence of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost in our hearts and lives are you willing to give up everything for it this morning and then it goes on to say I'll just read a few more voice verses here again that the Kingdom of Heaven is likened onto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind and this is the gospel net you can't change people you can't make people be who they're not you just got to let God do it he goes on to say kind which when it was full they drew it to the shore and sat down and gathered The Good Into The Vessel and the cast The Bad away and so shall it be at the end of the world when the Angels shall come forth and S the wicked from among the just and she I'll just finish that verse this morning and it should never discourage you you know to encourage people to be better than they are I I don't I've always had problems with people that tell well if you're not going to do right just be worse i' I've never like that type of attitude in our lives we should always encourage people to be better than they are to be better Christians just to be better people and I was just I'm not trying to be funny in the world that we live in this morning it's going to change you one way or the other it's it's not getting any easier every day we just go further down this course that we're in this morning and it's choosing time like they say and God you're going to find out who you really are and I was just thinking as as an older man you know I was thinking of what Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Isaiah had to say you know you can be a righteous man for 40 or 50 years and if you make a mistake and you don't repent of that mistake your righteousness isn't going to do you any good on that day so whether you're a new believer or an old believer the you have to hold on to that profession of Faith until the end or it's not going to do you any good and as I see this age coming about I just I would just hope that God will keep working on me so I'll be there on that day and then of course Christian will reach out in faith and say God has accepted me so I'll be there on that day Brother David amen let's stand to our feet this morning as we get ready to enter into the worship service how many's happy to be here well I know a few are happy to be here brother John's happy to be here sister Becky brother Steve they're happy to be here how many's happy to be here amen we could all be in a

set the young people's hearts on fire to renew the fire and and US older folks you know that's what we're here here for right we're here for that you know brother brother Brian made a statement he

my mind that we was going to have our get together next weekend and and for some reason I just had it in my mind that's when it's going to be but it's two weeks so y'all remember that two weeks amen amen the fish are biting Mike and brother Mark went out on a boat yesterday and I think he cut at least 50 bass right Micah so about 50 bass they caught out there course they're pretty good at it I guess so you might want to cut that in half unless you're good you know anyway at least I would have to amen but still amen so looking forward to it amen how many's looking forward to fellowshipping together amen I trust everybody will be able to make it and so amen Timothy puit will be up there up here with us also amen that weekend so we're looking forward to that amen praise the Lord so amen let's I can't think of any other announcements or anything so let's just bow our heads and go before the heavenly father we come before you Lord and we want to thank you Lord Jesus for this opportunity again Lord Lord of being able to assemble ourselves together Lord Jesus and to be able to yield ourselves to you father that you might use us to speak and also Lord that you might be with the ears of the hearer Lord and help each one to receive what you have for us this morning Lord father we just ask God that as we look at your precious promises and open your word God that you would lead us guide us and help us in everything that we say and do now in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord so amen we want to have a part two of Wednesday if that's okay amen praise the Lord amen called releasing the power of God amen amen and then I had a subtitle amen I believe it was called about letting go amen and I want to just touch on some of that a little bit more amen I was thinking when I was thinking about this I says you know whenever you go to a restaurant amen and they serve you you're real good and the steak's just right and amen everything's just real good youen go back to that restaurant don't you you want some more amen amen Longhorns and some of them places that try to get it to you right every time amen unfortunately we some some sometimes we might not get it to you the same every time but we do want to surrender to God and hopefully it'll be a good again this morning amen amen because we just don't realize sometimes amen that we're privileged people how many believes we're real real privileged people amen amen and uh so if you will we'll turn to Proverbs amen we'll just stem from a a scripture amen a scripture that I had that came to my mind amen that I want to try to build off of with just for a little bit with the help of the Lord and also then we want to read the quote basically that we feel like amen was inspired to us from the service couple of times ago amen amen Proverbs 23 Proverbs 23 and I just want to read half uh well we'll read the whole scripture there verse seven for as he thinketh in his heart so is he amen eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen I'm thinking there's another scripture and I may be wrong but I thought there was a scripture that says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he amen as a man thinks in his heart so is he amen quite a statement amen and we want to with the help of the Lord just see and and go a little bit further amen as deep as we can with that let me see I want to I'm going to go ahead and read you another one in Matthew 15 and I believe it's verse 11 as you know um in verse 8 it says 15 and 8 says this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mou out of his mouth this defileth a man amen then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying amen and he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father ha not planted shall be brooded up let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch he didn't change his tune much did he he offended him and I'm sure that if they found out what he said about him they'd have been off Ed a little bit more that right but he said don't worry about them they're blind leaders of the blind amen and if the blind lead the blind they'll both fall into the ditch how many knows that Jesus always has a way of just kind of telling it how it is amen he just he tells it how it is and that's what he was doing amen then answered Peter and said unto him declare unto us this Parable and Jesus said are ye also yet without understanding do you not yet understand that whatsoever entereth into the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draw now here's where we want to get to but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart amen so how many believes it's very important what's down in our heart amen amen amen as a man thinks in his heart so is he and another another way you know we could look at this is as a man focuses and as the goals that you have and the way that you think is what you become brother Bram taught that you know the way uh the womb to your soul is your mind amen and what you allow to come down into here is what you become young people you've got goals you got Ambitions well I want to be a doctor I want to be a vet I want to be this I want to be whatever it is that you begin to think about is what you become amen and we're privileged people this morning that this can apply to Christians that as you think in your heart that's what you become now how many knows when brother B preached on Samson and Delilah and he talked about you know how that he was backslid and so forth amen just once more many times he preached on just once more Lord Samson had gotten in the backslid state amen and he says at the end of the most of those service he says now we know that Samson knew that in his backslid State he was not Amen in the condition to meet the challenge of the power how many beli that we've got a challenge in our day and you are going to have to have more than the Pentecostals did or the Baptist or any other church or anybody else amen because we've got a challenge amen and that challenge is the rapture it's a showdown the brother R said you're either going to be left here or you're going to be raptured and in order to be raptured you're going to have to be ready for a Rapture and if you're ever going to have a body change changed in very atoms what is it going to take think about what that's going to take amen my my my praise the Lord now how many knows if if if if Jesus would leave that Mercy Seat tonight or today amen all of your desires and Ambitions and and desires to want to be what you want to be that it all be over with you'd not be a privileged person anymore but we're privileged people because you can be as you think in your heart I don't always think this say evil and all of that amen if Jesus applied this to evil thoughts that defile a man then guess what when you got good thoughts coming for something else is going to take place your whole being your whole outlook everything about life is because of the thoughts that you think the thoughts that you allow to come into here ain't that right is what you become because you through the womb of your mind is amen everything that comes comes through the Bo of your mind amen and there's a sacrifice there that'll enable you to become especially this word amen I hope this comes out right it's going to take the Holy Ghost to straighten this mess up because I've got about I don't know how many but just so many different things that I want to try to bring in here but I just want to hopefully by the grace of God just follow the leading of the spirit amen and to preach by faith because that's really where it all comes down to anyway is that right amen increase our faith Lord amen amen praise the Lord so you got to watch it amen how many belever we got to watch what goes through our mind why because he's the high priest of our profession he's the high priest of the things that we confess if I ask you when did you get saved when did I get saved well around 1982 1981 maybe down in down in Sarasota Florida you know and so forth but no the prophet comes along and says no you weren't saved on any certainty he said everybody that ever got saved got saved when he died on Calvary and another place he says you know anybody that ever got saved was saved with God before the foundation of the world in the mind of God you always was let's talk about the double barrel shotgun for just a minute shall we let's talk about this now listen talking about uh uh blind barnaba sitting there and I can imagine he sat there and God begins to deal with his heart and prepare for something little did he know just around the corner what's the Fountain of Life hallelujah amen just around the corner when you get to thinking about Divine Healing get to thinking about Christ keep him on your mind if there be any praise if there be any virtue the Bible said think on these things oh if any thought comes by well maybe I can't be get that off of your mind think on things that's positive never let a negative thought pass

can't think they think that's what the devil wants you to think always think positive thought don't let a negative ever thought ever passed through oh man don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind but don't let it stop like the old farmer said I can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double barrel shotgun said I can sure keep them from roasting so you do the same thing he says don't let them roast you just let them pass right on through and here's the shotgun to use both New Testament and Old Testament wait a minut it's very good it's for you just keeps all the negative thoughts oh let me just say what com to man this world and everything in it it'll bring a depression there ain't no no saying how low that people will go amen the people

you to I want to say to the bride of Christ out there you ain't seen nothing yet I believe the power of God's going to come down on his little group of people amen unlike you have ever seen before why because we have got to learn Amen brother ra says when you realize who you are and when you begin to confess who you are the Rapture will take place he's at another place man if a person would actually take all of these things and it hit them all at once he says man it would bring Rapture that's how good it is aren't you glad that we live in the age that we can have it the way that we do we take it for granted folks we take for granted coming to the house of God isn't that right we take it for granted but the prophet of God said they would close these places up one of these days you won't be able to come to the house of God and if you do and you offer prayer for this one or that one without permission they'll blow your head off he said they'll shoot you it's going to get bad after a while hello so how many oh man I'm telling you right now while I have the advantage y want to praise God I'm going to serve God I'm going to come together with my brothers and sisters as much as I can releasing the power of almighty God Amen this is where you get your strength Paul said I count all things but Dum you've got to forget everything you ever had that I might know him in the power of his resurrection he said laying aside every sin and every weight that so easily besets us let us lay aside everything let us run this race oh my brother Brian he talked about he says you know always like to see a man whatever state he is am me become a little bit better how many believ that we can do all of that every one of us needs that this morning Amen to become a better person than

person with one person with genuine Faith he can put 10,000 Devils running just as hard as they can go yes sir amen I'm so glad of that aren't you amen what does the Bible say running I thought man running as hard as they could amen that's exactly right Jesus said the Bible says amen Peter said resist the devil and you will flee he'll flee from you that's what I want him to do I don't want him to walk away I want him to get on out of here I want him to run Fleet oh my we got about 75 people in here amen and each one chasing 10,000 amen what is that 700 50,000 devils are going to have to go to run it if I can just get this whole group to believe in genuine Faith dropping down amen every demon of Doubt every demon of unbelief of depression sorrow guilt SK I'll have to go flee folks if we get together right we can get about 750,000 running I hope that math is right maybe maybe not but it's a bunch but guess what if you want more of God you want more of God you're going to have to make R that's right you ain't never never never going to get any more of God than what you got now unless you make more room for him why do you think we're preaching man think on him every day every hour keep your mind on him amen make room we ain't got time that's why you ain't got nothing else either because you ain't got time for God you ain't got time to make put him first enticing Spirits versus the word of God brother BR plus like I've been preaching out he says show me a housewife give me a housewife give me a farmer give me a a mom or whatever amen it's filled with the Holy Ghost amen that'll put God first in everything and I'll show you a person that'll be successful despite everything the devil could do amen Oh I thought about that why that's a bunch of devils is there that many around well let's just take a little trip brother Bram said that in our age with all this rock and roll that's come out hello the church is letting down that right preacher letting down there's been an invasion he says the lid has come off of hell and streams stream streams here goes the stream there goes the stream here comes another stream here comes another stream streams upon streams of demons are coming out of hell and they're inhabiting the people and look at what it's making them do it's making them dress crazy have an orange hair having pink hair amen the other man I can't go through the mo Burger King anywhere going through it but there's a woman uh you know with a a woman's name got her hair cut up and looking just like a man her head looks like a man body looks like a woman hello streams of demon poers saking people over making them act all kinds of crazy amen but aren't you glad there's a outpouring of a holy ghost also and he causing us to act a little crazy to him it makes us want to act right it makes just want to dress right people say they love God but if you love God you love God's people you love to dress right you like to conduct yourself as a Christian amen I'm glad for the other side yeah I'm a little crazy too I act a little foolish too but I'll tell you what I'm a fool for Christ who's fool are you amen they are sorrowful and they got to do drugs and they got to do alcohol they going to do everything for just a little bit of Joy I ain't got to do nothing but to come in the house of God am me I got to just read the word of God Amen I'm happy at 24ever I am I got fullness of joy amen I don't care if it's in the morning if it's at noon time it's in the evening I'm always full of joy brother Braham said this ain't nothing but a Powerhouse of Joy what do you do for fun what do you do for f that girlfriend of brother Bam's ask you don't dance you don't smoke you don't don't drink what he do well go to church with me and I'll tell you what I do for fun I kick Devils out I kick depression out and we get people that are lost amen we get them to be found that's what we do that's our joy amen praise the Lord God is good isn't he amen this is as I said it before letting go you got to let go of something if you want more God lay aside every weight amen the things that beset you I like this I don't know about that Tommy it's nice but preacher got to have room think about it just to think about the things of God the joy that it brings you the comfort that it brings you amen why wouldn't we want this why would why don't people want it it's because it's it's a heart problem me that's where we got that's he said he think as a man thinks in his heart how many has ever had thoughts in your mind thought you didn't like I have arguments all the time sister I have arguments all the time the Mind wants to think something and the heart says no that's not my thought get on out of there why and that thought has to play every one of us we get in trouble when we let that that thought come down into our heart ain't that right then sin comes in and then separation comes in then depression comes in then all of that stuff that you ever did 30 40 years it all comes flooding back but I'm so glad this morning that there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's vein amen that the Sinners plunge beneath that blood lose all their guilty stain it's still open that Fountain is still open oh my where's that double barrel shotgun brother he says that's right the Old Testament New Testament every time the devil tries to tell you you know you're just a brother bam wondered whether there'd be a handful or doesn't make it to Rapture devil will try to tell you you know I don't think you're gonna make it huh your mind will say I don't know if I'm G to make it I don't know if I'm good enough go ahead and think the devil's thoughts that's all the devil thoughts the devil is trying to get you to think that you're not good enough that you're not worthy but don't look at your worthiness you're not you're it's not about your worthiness and it's not about you holding on it's about you let it go and let God have wonderful way I mean know David let go and let God have his way amen I have to bring this in yet I didn't I didn't last time but the holding on that Jesus did Brother brandom Illustrated he said he had his n he had his hands nailed to the cross and he was holding on ain't that right and he said the Angels were saying I know that you got your hand hands fastened but we're watching you said all you got to do is move your finger brother B said all he had to do brother Brad all he had to do is say come on come on come and get me off of here but thank God he didn't he says no I'm not moving my finger leave me here because I got to fulfill the word of God and me because every one of us would been lost if he'd have moved his one finger he held on and I trust what he did anybody that'll ever get saved it will believe what God did for you on Calvary you've got to accept what he did on Calvary amen he that believeth with his heart that God has raised him from the dead and confesses with his mouth the Lord Jesus shall be saved I me if you've got to make a confession you've got to make an admission you've got to accept what has already done everything oh I love this I love that one of the greatest thoughts that there is is all the work is already done it's already finished he is just waiting on you to accept what is already been done brother Bram said many places he says if he was here in my suit if he was up here this morning if Jesus was here this morning he couldn't heal you he couldn't save you the only thing he might do is earned the thoughts and the tense the heart to raise your faith in what he's already done I don't have to have discernment I don't have to have any provoc provocation am me that cause me to believe I believe how you with me I believe what he did I believe I'm saved I believe I'm filled with the Holy Ghost nothing like faith in the word of God you love him isn't he awesome he's awesome God praise be to God Amen heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away amen the word of the Lord is sure and steadfast God's word never changes the sun comes up the sun goes down the months come the months go the years come the years go the generation comes the generation goes amen this Century Comes This Century goes this Millennial comes and the millennial goes we've had about two Millennia since Jesus died on the cross and his word has never changed the power of the word has never lost one drop of power but is waiting for somebody to open their heart to open their mind to open their soul to open their strength and saying God I love you with all of my heart all of my strength all of my mind my soul every bit Lord I love you with all of my heart and I believe you with everything I got amen we got to get to a place where we are like brother Brandon was amen he had to believe it he was sick and him and he couldn't eat nothing he says if I'm going to die I'm going to die and he eat that food and that right threw it up and ate it again God help us he got his healing shamgar and them they were some Mighty Warriors weren't they shamgar he didn't have no double second thought about it when he grabbed that Ox goat up amen he was oh afraid in himself I can't handle one of them Philistines I'm no Warrior but when he got that Ox guard and got a little bit of Faith amen and they yield himself to the power of God he took out 600 of them I don't know if there was any left I don't know about Tommy if he left one man to go back to tell the story or not or if he just simply escaped but I'll tell you what if it had been 1,00 2,000 it wouldn't have mattered that's the kind of Faith you and I mean like the three Hebrew children sometimes you don't know if God's going to do it or not we don't know but we know this one thing we are 150% sure that he's able we know he's real we know that he's the same yesterday today and forever and this morning all things are possible if you will believe that he's the same right now as he ever was oh my we had cripples in here this morning you ought to jump up and say I believe he's still a Healer no matter what it is if you can have faith in the word of God you can have it it's a finished work folks yeah I got say well I got saved in 1982 no that's when I accepted what he had done for me that's when I recognized hey that is for me but not only done and we he know that he could have never redeemed us outside of that shed blood that's why he says he you were saved them but in the aspect of God's mind it's as good as done when God thinks it way before the foundation of the world so when the devil tries to tell you no you're not gonna make it you just take the word go back and take that one barrel amen take that word amen where brother B says if you ever made it you already made it I many believes that he also said you can no more pass away than God can pass away because you were part of his thinking and his thinking is eternal that's what brings power that releases the power that comes out of that right side of that shotgun a't that right their devil their devil eat on that Buckshot huh amen praise the Lord do you want me to give you intellectual preaching just stuff that I can come up with and say in my mind because sometimes it seems that way just preaching from my intellect or preaching by inspiration amen by the power of the Holy Ghost I got notes but folks if the Lord wants to go completely down a little alley somewhere ain't that right like when I preached on hope I couldn't figure out why in the world I'm preaching on Hope amen but until sister Janette said that was for her and if I'm not wrong I said maybe it's just for one person maybe I don't know cuz I didn't think about it amen but God knows how to come down your alley don't he Lord help the preacher to get out of the way Lord help each hearer to be able to hear what the spirit is saying to the church cuz if you have a blessed ear blessed are those ears that hear and understand you can receive eternal life and be set free how many believe the power of God is to set you free we ain't barely got enough freedom to laugh or to smile huh we want the devil wants us depressed he wants you down in the mully grubs he loves when you've got the wowy wowy Woos let's remember brother juel huh let's give him a hand remember brother juel that's right we love brother jeel amen he told us and taught us that God doesn't want a bunch of wowy wowy Woos he wants his children full of joy Full Of Love full of power God hates a powerless Church ain't got enough power to say amen hallelujah praise be to God Amen jump a little once in a while I'm gonna say like David said you think this is bad wait till I get over there a that right amen when this body keep keep me down this flesh oh man I got responsibility all of that all of my job all of your responsibilities and everything all of that all that money stuff all that does is suck the very holy ghost out of you it's when you get alone in your closet it's when you have fellowship with God it's when you get in that secret place amen who God who sees in secret when you get to that place that's where you plug into the outlet amen and you get Juiced up amen and you they get charged that's why brother B said the preacher shouldn't be Al frolicking around and all of this other stuff he ought to be there alone in the secret us amen amen meditating on the Lord go all that other stuff bunch of Riff Raff amen it's just stuff we got to do but you got to get alone with God if you want to let loose of the power of almighty God Amen I me believe we need more of it prayer is one of the most powerful things when you're all by yourself somewhere amen like brother Brandon was way up in the woods he was out there in the woods meditating having some Serene time with the Holy Ghost amen praise be to God Amen that's right praise the lord we have a challenge we have a challenge is that right the devil's asked the question how are you ever going to overcome this lead ofia how are you gonna come overcome this flood of sin unbelief that I'm going to throw at you a that right amen how are you going to do it God comes back and says we've got the answer to the devil's question speaks through his Prophet says we've got the answer to the devil's question amen you let everything loose you throw all of Hell at me amen God's going to throw all of Heaven he's going to bring all of Heaven that time folks how many know is every borign again Holy Ghost filled Christian you're not alone you've got all the host of Heaven behind you you go and you notify that that devil that he has no right on God's Property he has no right to rule in your hearts she has no right to have preeminence fear has no right in your in your bosom all of Heaven all the Chariots remember Elijah amen gesi amen gesi said man there's more of them than there is of them and there was only 50 of them about 50 I guess it was was he said God opened up his eyes and the whole mountains were covered with chariots and forces of fire hello all of Heaven said oh my how many knows brother bradwood he said let Fire Fall amen I imagine in the spnatural realm amen them horses and them angels went to Galloping them and throwing them some Fireballs down on them folks and burned them up and they went back up on the mountain now what else are you going to say listen to his word cuz he had they had orders from headquarters whatever that Elijah says you all do it ain't that right amen Angels camped around right here they're trying to influence you amen how do they do it through ministers speak through me the anointing come through me and talk to you saying you're more than able to do it all those doubting Israelites there was a Joshua and a Caleb he says no no don't you think negative don't you say that there's big wall chariots and everybody else and Giants no we're more than able to conquer it how many knows we're more than able to take the Rapture we're more than able to come to Perfection we're more than able to be without spot and without Rael and without blemish at the coming of the Lord we're more than able to let the five-fold Ministry bring us to Perfection more than able why because it's not us it's him greater is he that is in you this morning than he that is in the world nothing shall be impossible for you how many believes that for a Believer nothing's impossible sometimes God does things only once you never know what God might do I don't know he talked any more than once through that donkey ain't that right right got to talking to him you know I don't know that Peter ever again walked on water is that right doesn't record that he did so it's just ain't no telling what God will ever do wouldn't it been something if I just walk out here and walk and not go down huh God told me to do it I'd have no fear saying look I ain't gonna go down I'mma walk on air wouldn't that be something oh I know what it looked like back there right it be I'll be looking in eyes like that what what what amen God told me brother Abraham said go raise Abraham up Lincoln is that right or George Washington whatever it might be whichever it was said I invite the world because how many knows Jesus did such things he raised the death through the prophet opened the eyes of the blind healed the sick he wasn't afraid because he knew the power of God how many knows at the church we as people listen we want to see the power of God Paul said I don't come to you enticing words of man's Wisdom that your faith would rest in the wisdom of man but I come to you in the power of the holy spirit so that your faith will rest in the power of God that's what we want to rest on completely Trials come your way tests come your way you can say well that ain't nothing that ain't nothing for God my God not to be able to handle but how many knows we all know what it's like that when you think about your own self of how you can handle it it gets scary oh I don't know if this is gonna this is going to be all right amen is that right brother Troy knows brother R and sister Martha didn't know what it's like well is Troy going to be okay is this going to be all right amen it can cause us to worry and threet and everything else amen but he's here let's give the Lord a hand brother Troy made it God took him through some sometimes we can't get over it can't get around and we try everywhere to go just hold still just wait on God how many know sometimes patient patience is a real release amen of power patience those who through patience inherit the promise don't get in a hurry you know sometimes I thought about this the other day brother Joe I thought you know when we pray we expect it right now well guess what brother B said Jesus is never in was never in a hurry I really don't think he's in a hurry today he's in no rush it's us that's in a rush it's us that thinks it's got to be done at a certain time amen he can be four days late still right on time woo let's give the Lord a hand oh my praise be to God how many's glad to be chasing the devils and not having the Devils chase you amen how many's glad to have the devil's under your feet and not feel like you're under the devil's feet folks I'm here to tell you if you backslid if you're not where you ought to be with God I want you to know there's blood on the mercy re seat for you amen you ain't got to stay that way if you're depressed if you got sorrow whatever it is you ain't got to stay that way no you can have joy unspeakable and full of Glory but you got to make up your mind you got to make up your mind of what you're going to allow to come down on the inside because I'm here to tell you we are becoming what we eat and I'm eating perfect faith I'm eating perfect love amen and I know that I'm going to become just that because that's what you take in you become what you eat and what you eat is what you think about all the time because this is where it comes in amen through your ears through your mind and then it goes down there and it lodges amen that's why it's so important to think God's thoughts say what God Said Amen now are we sons of God God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but when we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him amen for we shall see him as he is and he that hath his hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure well brother I just can't get righteous enough I can't get holy enough do you realize if you're born again if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Bram says you know you we become the Bible says not brother but the Bible says he says that we become Paul said you have become the very righteousness of God next the devil times the devil tries to bring you of your past you remind him hey the Bible says amen my sins are in the sea of his forgetfulness and I am his righteous is God according to the word when you realize who you are the Rapture is going to take place I believe not just in the physical Rapture but I believe that we've got to get caught up a little higher than what we are right brother R we got to get caught up a little bit higher than what we are our heart has to become the very Throne of almighty God so that his love he can project his love out through you it ain't you loving people it ain't you having faith it's God doing it through [Music] you that's what it's all about I can't help but say it ain't you praising God it's God praising God Amen what it's him and good that's in me it's him doing it he gets all the glory he gets all the praise greater is he that is in you than you we need to all be able to say that God is greater than you are cuz if it was me I'd have the wowy wowy Woos I'd have the blues I'd have depression amen amen praise be to God you don't even have to fear death you ain't got to be scared of death amen all right on this ribeye or on this T-Bone there's I guess the flame flaming yawn on one side right let's get down to the F monan shall we amen let's see if we can find the F man praise be to God listen to what he says it's so strange such a strange thing this is so much thought of by the people and they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say Amen how many we're living in an hour when it's time for the week to say I'm strong when it's time for the weak to say I'm strong when the poor say I'm rich when the sick should say I'm not sick I'm Healed when the Lost should say I'm not lost I'm saved when those that don't have the Holy Ghost I believe God has given me the Holy Ghost amen oh my listen what he says he says the thing to do is to know that you're coming to fulfill a promise that God made for you there's going to be thousands of people praying for you and when you come by this prayer line when we pray lay hands on you just as soon as those hands is laid upon you you just like rising up from out of the water and being baptized you have done something that God has giv you a promise that would happen he that believeth on me and is baptized shall be saved go right out of this building testify that you're saved what if you go out there bu out of this building say well I don't know then you're not saved but God will make your body obey your confession how many believe that you're a child of God how many believe that you are saved and that you're going to go in a Rapture that you're going to be without spot and without wrinkle cuz God's word said it you're going to [Applause] be amen listen to what he says that's right see he's the high PR of our confession before you can be healed you have to confess it first you have to believe that you are healed amen and when you believe that you're healed God make makes your body obey your confession amen praise be to God let me just give you another one you might come by here to be prayed for you might have angels to lay hands on you it will never do a thing until you first believe it how many believe that you've got to accept it you've got to believe it first first doesn't matter if the prophet how many knows that's the way it was with the prophet Amen in the name of Jesus be healed in the name of Jesus you're healed it all depends on whether that person really believes that or not because we know a lot of them went through and they never get get their healing others would amen praise be to God got to confess it first amen we've got to confess it first then he can be a witness to God for he's the high priest of our confession amen praise the Lord so my question this morning is what's in your mind what's in your mind amen well I'll tell you one thing that's in my my I two thoughts one of them is well you're in this flesh and you're always going to make mistakes you're never going to be perfect you'll always make mistakes so get that out of your hand out of your head hang your wings up back there and don't you ever think you're ever going to be a real Saint I'm sorry but how many knows we're Saints here we're Christians am amen or you can believe this prophet of God said that a man can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with him yeah that's right let's go with that amen I know all of that other stuff but I don't want to think about that I want to think about how that I can live so close to God the devil every day has to get up a new script he's got to get another piece of paper to try to figure out how to get to me because you just don't know how to get to me amen I've got a big question for you yall ready for a big question all right thank you is that where you are is that where you are amen I'll give you my answer for myself y'all listening now ain't you what's my answer W I'm not what I want to be but one thing sure I'm not what I used to be and I'm getting closer all the time I'm working that way oh yeah Monday I

I don't feel like I'm there yet amen when my wife spats at me I still have a tendency to want to spat back spat back a little bit huh she wants to cobwebs washed off the off the ceilings and everything else and this that or the other and I don't really want to do it huh yeah I'll wash your cob whips off of your porch for you huh amen so we're getting closer Lord help us how many believe from glory to glory changing me it's not from sorry to sorry I'm getting worse getting worse oh getting worse I feel like shooting myself huh no no from Glory Paul said from one glory to another I'm seeing Glory changing y'all's faces I see some smiles back there I didn't see him five minutes ago God's changing you how many will promise me that you'll go home and you'll begin to think on good things amen think on good things a good report whatever things are honest what things are lovely and I'm here to tell you this is lovely I ain't got to go to hell I I ain't got to go to judgment I don't have to fear death there's a body for me waiting over there think on good things I've got a body waiting for me brother brand said Perfections on the other side and if that's what you're craving it shows there's a body over there that'll never make a mistake it'll never say the wrong thing it'll never do the wrong thing it'll never think the wrong things and it's waiting there CU When I got born again there was a little sea germ a little man that begin to grow and when he gets full grown perhaps God will take him home amen and give him the house that he belongs to be in that he longs to be in amen not a body that'll keep looking like that what time is it Anyway am I going too long am I holding the people too long amen when we been there 10,000 years bright shining as the sun with no last days to sing sing God's praise then when we first began I feel to say in the name of the Lord under the anointing of the spirit my my my if people get bored in church what are they going to do in heaven they get tired of going to church it's a boore to them Heaven's going to be a real bore place for you just like the man that came and said brother random I was enjoying your message until some lady back in the back Screech you know and praise be to God and amen amen it sent chills all over my back can make me have a cold chill run all over me brother Bram says boy when you get to heaven you're going to be froze you're going to be frozen to death over there cuz people us going to be screaming and shouting and Hallelujah like you ain't never heard how many agree with me that when we get over there and we know that we made it and we're there there's going to be some shouting going on there's going to be some praising be to God I made it I made it I made it I made it I'm here I'm here I'm here faith is a long range Vision anybody that's ever a Christian you by the power of God look into the future at what you're going to be is't that what we do that's the Power released by almighty God through faith we believe we're going to see Ivan again we're g to see our loved ones again those who have gone on before those Christians who've gone on before we're looking forward to seeing them your mom sister Bey never forget you shoveling that dirt praising God cuz you had that confidence I'm going to see my mom again this ain't the end it does something to you when you truly believe that this is not the end no this is just the beginning amen the Power released by faith can I have five minutes I wanted to talk about that same way with love and faith some of the most powerful things that God puts into your soul and into my soul is Faith starts with that simple faith of I believe Jesus died on Calvary for me paid for all my sins he paid for every mistake you I'll ever make as a Christian he paid for every sin brother bam says for Cain's sin every sin that was ever committed from the beginning to the end he died for every last one of them but you got to accept it when you accept it it goes into his sea for into his sea of forgetfulness oh my here we go how many knows everything that's not seen is real salvation is real forgiveness is real Grace is real amen depression is real sadness is real Emptiness is real but I'm here to tell you there's something that's more real that's being filled too overflowing I don't know about you but lately as you can tell my cup's just been kind of running over a little bit amen hang on bring out the napkins cuz we're going to keep pouring and we're going to keep letting it overflow I hope it gets over on you I hope it pours out on you put all of us until we get so full of the Holy go amen we go out there and become different people it's the atmosphere of God that brings new birth we don't know brother we don't know how treasured we have it to have this atmosphere that we have right now to have this Freedom that we have right now it's one of the greatest treasures we can have cuz the devil man he will try to do everything his power to get you to come to church gloomy and depressed and it's even much more of a victory for him when you leave I would say the same but I can't say the same is that right somebody tell me why you won't leave the same who said who said you won't leave the same there you go Brother David that's the correct answer brother bam says you come in those doors you never leave the same you either go out better or you go out worse you hear M like this you hear the word of God that he's come he's here how many believe Jesus said he who the son has set free is free indeed brother he said indeed he's free indeed he's absolutely free how many's free this morning thank God I am free free free from this world of sin free from sin free from unbelief free from cares free from all these things because the power of the holy spirit amen comes to do just that what do you got in your mind that's right I got in my mind that if the devil tries to tell me I ain't going to make it I call him a liar liar you ain't saved brother B you ain't got the H you liar I can take you to the time and I can take you to the place where the Lord saved me where I thought I got saved amen where God did something when I recognize that God has saved me that it's for me I can put my foot down amen now the sins I used to do I do them now no more the sins I used to do I do them now no more the man I used to be I am no more amen praise God how many's here to worship I like that quote brother BR says I guess a preacher can preach and worship at the same time I got my written permission Brother Brad I can worship and I can preach I can have a good time both and you can too praise be to God Amen let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus who thought it not equal to be thought it not robbery to be equal with God you're not some defeated pushed down in the corner something but ABR said you're a Son of God how many believe that he actually in our age he called us Gods you sisters realize that goes for you you're God a God not the god anybody tries to make themselves God the god you Antichrist amen might get struck down but he God a ruler how many believes that we're rulers how many beli we're Kings he has made his Kings and Priests that's what the word said not some defeated no good bad poor Christian no you're a strong Christian and I believe in the grace of almighty God we're saved by grace through faith that not of yourselves it's only by the grace of God that you can doubt your doubts is that right well I don't know I don't know that if I can do it I doubt that thought I don't believe that thought I said one more one more quote but I want to read you this getting almost two wet up here amen listen to this oh my listen when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spiritual the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her disbel the devil amen disbelieve what he says and accept God and His word the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against us Satan knows that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God not your power I I I hate repeating myself 10 times but let me say it again emptying out and letting go is about you getting rid of your onean power and become a thousand horsepower so to speak a million horsepower unlimited there you go now we're getting right unlimited not a th000 not 10,000 but you go from a very very limited power to unlimited power all of the hosts of Heaven all of the power of God is with you when you can let go of yourself and the hardest thing for any of us to do is to let go of our s our Ambitions our goals our plans is that right every one of us should say this morning well you know whether it's Wesson going to college this that or the other and no matter what it is maybe you've got a business you want to start maybe this that or the other just remember say God I want your plan in my life whatever your plan is that's what I want whatever your will is the disciples came back bringing food back to Jesus and and they ask him have you got any meat he says you know he says I'll tell you what my meat is I'll tell you what my food is my food and my my food is to do my father's will ain't that right that's the way we should feel my meat is to do the father's will whatever that is praise the Lord amen Satan hates Revelation he hates when you get a real revelation of God how many knows that I'm GNA I'm going to stop here here in a minute he knows assuredly that the original Church of Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus comes and claims for his own I just want to say evening light Tabernacle Saints we're starting to look a little bit more like the book of Acts and I'll tell you what come comes to my mind the reason I say that is because of how much brother brother bam emphasized that it's not he said it's so important that those original Saints amen they were not led by man or Bishops and this out or the other but the original church was led by the Holy Ghost how many believes that's what we got to be led by is by the power of the Holy Ghost each individual in the church has to be led by the Holy Ghost and we'll see amen his power his in him in action amen listen The Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist Spirit would come in to the church defile it making it look warm formal and Powerless second Timothy 3 it says you know that there be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and he and high minded and traitors and all these things and having a church a form of godliness but denying the power thereof how many knows the power of God makes you act different live different it'll make you cut your hair different or not cut your hair it'll make you wear dresses that are not too tight it'll make you men amen not wear shorts out there in public and everything else hello it'll make you conform to the word of God hallelujah and you won't be formal it ain't going to be formality Oh I thought about this and it scared me and I as I was studying I thought maybe I should ask everybody you should ask yourself do I just come to church as a farm cuz that's scary and that's dangerous just to come no I don't just come to come I come to worship God I come to praise God I come to get something for God and if you leave that the same come to same and leave like almost seeming the same all the time maybe it's just formal don't deceive yourself you're not going in that condition you better get hot for God and have some power about you amen oh Revelation exposes Satan attempt at destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word right down to the time that he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows if the people get a true revelation of the true church how many knows if you really get a revelation of who you are the devil will be powerless in front of you Jesus what what it about him he knew who he was now if I was to ask everybody does the devil sometimes cast doubt in your mind about who you are because that's his business if he does he's doing his job trying to get you to wonder whether you're really a son and daughter of God he's about that business you just slap him right back in the face amen if y'all ever seen that where they're slapping each other slap contests folks I'm here to tell you you do that to the devil slap him so hard he knocks him out make sure he don't get up say devil you just get on out of here I know who are oh yes oh yes I a child of the king his royal blood flows through my vein I who was wretched and blind now can see amen oh I'm a child of the king how many children of God do we have in this morning how many children of God have we got amen I'm a Child of God devil get behind me I'm God's child behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us amen that we should be called the sons of God and to as many as he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as believed gave he the power to become Sons and Daughters of God wo Glory it's not my power that's my power terrible sounding isn't it that's a human's power that's a little bit of God's power huh make you shout make you praise God don't you hate being depressed don't you hate being bowed I hate that stuff I am not happy brother Joe unless I'm driving down the road and i' be able to sing in my car wherever I am nobody has to hear me I don't care if I'm down the bu that's right that big buck going hear me brother Tommy you know how many times I've sat in the tree side and just wanted to scream and I knew i' Ru my whole hun if I did did you get that I said I'd ruin my whole hun if I did Scream the way I felt like especially if I ran around a tree or something but anyway praise be to
