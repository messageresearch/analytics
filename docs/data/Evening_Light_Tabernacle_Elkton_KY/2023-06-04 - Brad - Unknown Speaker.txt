TRANSCRIPT
========================================
examples in the Bible where you where you have Abraham takes Isis up to Mount Moriah and God stays his hand about offering eyes of deaths and sacrifice but if you go this interview I hope I don't wind up reading this whole chapter but a lot of you know who Jacob was he was a he was a criminal well not a criminal but he was an outcast among the people and he was surrounded by uh people that were considered outcasts or criminals but I'll just read a few I'll just jump around my point and my point being you got to be careful as a father or as a man or woman the vows that you make before the Lord because he's going to hold you accountable for it the thing I find striking in this 11th chapter you know I'm just I'm just a man I can't play scripture but you know you would think that Jacob that God would stay his hand that he wouldn't sacrifice his own daughter as a burnt offering but I'll just read what's in this chapter and you know what I was reading in the 11th chapter of Hebrews where his name is mentioned in those you know in that Hall of Fame of all the people his name's there too but all and forgive my pronunciations I'm not the best with them then Jacob went to the Venture program with and the eldest of gilia and the people made him head and Captain over them I'm sorry and shape without all these words before the Lord misspound and Jacob sent messages on to the king and the children of Amon saying why is thou to do with me why else Thou come out against me to fight in my land and they're talking this is the land that Moses had given them you know on both sides of the Jordan and this is the land that they took from Amon when they wouldn't let the children of Israel pass through and the king of the children they weren't answered unto the message of japheth because there Israel took away my land when they come up out of Egypt from Iran and on to Jay Park and on to Jordan now therefore restore these lands again if you know the scriptures you know that God said you can never give back to the heating what I have given you so that was you can't do it he couldn't do it and Jacob sent messages saying unto the king of the children of aeon Amon and he said unto them thus saith jape if Israel took not away the land of the land of the children of Mayon but when Israel came up from Egypt and walked through the Wilderness onto the Red Sea and came to cut us when Israel sent messages onto the king of Edom saying let me I pray thee pass through the land and the King Amendment would not hearken they're there too and in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab and he would not consent so as we go down he talks about all the people that the that the Israelites asked for permission to go through the land instead of letting them go through they Ward against them and then I'm jumping down to the ninth verse and Israel sent messages well let me jump then the Lord God Israel now I'm gonna jump I don't want to read all these scripture shares I'll start at about 23rd verse here and now the Lord God of Israel had dispossessed the armorites from before his people of Israel should have stopped possessing but thou possess what charm us thy God giveth thee to possess so whom ever the Lord I'll drive out from for Force then when we possess now art thou anything better than ballet the son of zippoor the king of love do you ever strive against Israel or did we ever fight against them when Israel grew up in heshban and her towns and Aaron her towns and and the cities to be along the coast of era there are three therefore did you not recover them so he's given them a response at no other time than they ever tried to repossess the lands and then he wherefore not sinned against thee but thou that's me wrong to war against me the Lord the judge be judged this day between the children of Israel and the children of Imam are that the king the children of Amon heart did not unto the words of Jeff which he sent them and then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Jacob and he passed over Gilead and Manassas and passed over misbah and Gilead and from mispar of Gilead he passed over onto the children man and this is this is already verse instead of reading all that and Jab fouled a vow unto the Lord and said if that will without fail so delivered the children of aeon into my hands then shall it be that whosoever come forth the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of them shall surely be the Lord and I will offer it up for a burnt offering and I was there you just got to be careful of what you promise you know what you promise people you're going to do what you promise them you're not going to do what you make a vow to the Lord you know every vow that you make before the Lord should be a vowel that goes that intertwines through the scriptures you can't promise someone that God's word doesn't promise you can't do for something somebody that's something that's contrary to the word of God you know I'll just he got the victory and then I'll reached on at the 31st fourth verse and Jeff came to miss Pawn to the house and behold the his daughters came out to meet his daughter came out to meet him with trembles and with dance and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter so this was his only child and he came to pass when he saw he ran his clothes and said ask my daughter that was brought me very low about the one of them that traveled me if I open my mouth onto the Lord and I cannot go back and that's what he's trying to say once you make a promise you got to keep it you know I was going through the scriptures you know I would think the only thing as a man like I said I'm not a profitable I can't play scripture I can't tell you what God was thinking you know if I've been with the disciples in the Day of Israel I would have asked about this year why didn't God send a prophet but I can't I can't say anything other than what the word of God says and she said unto him my father if thou has opened thy mouth unto the Lord to do to me according to that which has preceded out of thy mouth for as much as the Lord have taken Vengeance for thee for my enemies even for the children of Imam and she and he said unto her father let thine things be done for me let me alone for two months that I may go up and draw upon my mouth upon the mountains and beware my virginity and I am my fellows and he said go and he sent her away for two months and she went with her companions at beweld her virginity upon the mountain that came to pass at the end of the two months she returned on to the father who did who did with her according to his film which he have found and she know knew no man and it was a custom of Israel that the daughters of Israel went yielding to lament the daughter of Jeff the Gilead light for four days in a year and I'm just gonna jump up here to this Psalm 2 and then sit down this morning you know sometimes you can star well and you finish bad um I was just also thinking I'll just read the psalm and sit down but we live in an age where it's really important you know who you are and I'll just I was thinking this morning I was talking at the beginning I was talking about how the world is out there and you see all that's going on but just remember when they made the the one reli the one group of Believers they're constantly attacking making fun of trying to destroy is the Christian believer they're not I I say to people sometimes you know when they talk bad about Christians I'd like to see them to say the same thing about a Muslim or the things they do to church uh Christian Church just let them see them do it do a Muslim Mosque and they wouldn't go very far it wouldn't fall on a very good crowd but I'll just read what the second Psalm has to say why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine obeying things and the kings of the earth set themselves to take counsel together against the Lord and against this anointed saint let us break their bands in asunder and Cast Away their quotes from us be that sitteth in heaven shall laugh and the Lord shall have them in delivers him he shall speak unto them in Wrath and vexil them in his sword displeasure yet I have set my king upon the holy hell of Zion I will declare the decree in the Lord that said unto me thou art my son this day have I begotten thee ask me and I shall give Thee the Heathen for thy inheritance and the uttermost part of the earth for thy possessions now thou shall break them with a rod of iron thou shall vast them in pieces like upon us this be wise now therefore oh you Kings and be instructed you Jersey judges of the Earth serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with Kremlin kiss the son least he be angry and ye perish from the wife when is wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they they put their trust in him and I was just thinking in the age that we live and that's a hope that we're having the belief the unbelievers out there in the world there's not any we you hope the best form you desire the best for him but if you believe God's word you I I don't know how to say it there's no outside of Christ in your heart and life there's really no hope for for the for any anything that you know anything that you hold dear out there in the world I'm not saying it ain't a good thing but the only hope we have is Believers or as peoples in Jesus Christ and if you're looking for anything else other than that then you're going to be disappointed on that day brother Steve yes yes amen certainly good to be in the house of the Lord [Music] everybody today is fulfilling jobs that need to be done and that's the reason I'm up here so y'all bear with me if y'all stand foreign let's just start off singing a little chorus come and go with me to my father's house because I feel like that's what the desire was in each one of your hearts this morning or you wouldn't be here [Music] come at me to my father's

get past brother Steve either so it's not to be but I'll sing for you just a little song taken out of the Psalms you're probably all familiar with Psalms 19 more to be desired are they than gold beautiful when you look at the first line of each verse there the law of the Lord is perfect the statues of the Lord are right the fear of the Lord is clean more to be desired are they than gold and I'll just share a brief little story of uh comes from Mr Rockefeller who had the wealth of the world right and there was a reporter interviewing him he asked him at what point were you satisfied with your wealth or anything that he said that what does it take to satisfy a man and very insightful Mr Rockefeller said it just takes a little bit more so you never if you chase riches you'd never catch it it's a it's an empty thing when you get there and that's why you find a lot of wealthy people that become philanthropists they want to give it away because they realize there's no joy in having the wealth it to anyhow here's true riches here's more to be desired are they than gold the statues of the Lord fear of the Lord the law of the Lord the love the Lord is expect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple more to be desired are they than gold yea then much fine gold oh the sweeter also then honey and the honeycomb the statues of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart [Music] the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes more to be desired are they foreign [Music] [Music] ever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous all together oh [Music] hallelujah thank you [Music] thank you brother Russell I don't want to put anybody on the spot but does any of the family got a song back there okay all right but that was like you don't know that's my niece and their family from Jeffersonville area the Steve would you like to come up and give a testimony and God bless you Saints I think I know a few in the congregation uh no brother Steve of course and but it's good to be here with y'all um I uh I do a lot of things there at the church there in New Albany brother Nathan Bryant's Church the open door uh teach Sunday school and help out whatever wet can just like you do so sometimes I as the trustee I plunge the toilets um other times I preach a sermon so we just do what we can for the Lord uh I've had the opportunity a few times to go overseas and one thing that always strikes me is the presence of the Lord amongst the people no matter where you're at what state what country when you get around Believers that have the Holy Spirit it's that same spirit and we know because we're all baptized into the body of Christ by that same spirit so I'm looking forward to meeting more of you all uh chat with you outside but really looking forward to the service today What the Lord Has for us in the word and um you know I was just thinking as that brother was teaching Sunday school this morning what he was saying there about this age and about the importance of having Christ a real relationship with Christ Jesus that's the only thing that can hold a person in this age is that Holy Spirit that true word living in us and it can't just be taking somebody else's word for it learning from somebody else but that word as he was saying has to be something that we consume and come alive in us reminds me of you know Psalms one there where it says that believer planted by the rivers of water bringing forth fruit in its season so I don't know what the brother wanted me to to say as far as the testimony but I'll just say one little testimony of something good the Lord's done in my life uh a few years ago we we felt led to get a little place uh you know a different house with a little bit of land and uh as as it would work out the lord gave us a place uh helped our house to sell for more than we thought it would sell for and worked everything out to where we could get that place and we thought hey it's smooth sailing praise the Lord everything's good but you know that's when Satan's on his road to give you a hard time is when the Lord's doing something for you so as it worked out for us right as we were getting ready to try and close we got Another Blessing where we got to move some of our stuff into that house ahead of time because the prior people had left but then right about that time I lost my job and you know what happens they do that employment verification check to make sure you have a job before and everything and I was real worried you know I was tempted to be worried there do that check and this deal is going to fall through and all these thoughts come into your head you know uh my half my stuff's in the house I'm gonna have to pay somebody to move it out and get all this worry and all this things coming on I thought you know what the same God that gave me that house and helped my house to sell for above asking price so I could get that house is the same God that's going to get me a job and work this all out and you know uh I just went to the Lord in prayer and just started doing what I could do and through an employment agency um I got an interview with a company that I had worked at before and I left on good terms but I didn't want to go back you know how that is sometimes but the Lord got me an interview and it was a phone interview with about 15 people and as I got on the line and started to introduce myself there was one man that spoke up and he said you know what I hired Steven the first time he came to this company and he was a great employee we don't even need to continue this view I'm going to hire him and so it just worked out I I was able to within two weeks get the new job start the new job the employment verification went through fine we got the house and uh you know it was just a real reminder to me to take God at his word and remember the things that he's done even in the midst of the trials he's guiding every step and he is faithful to perform and complete every work that he has started God bless you Saints it's great to meet you looking forward to the word today God bless you [Applause] amen we all have testimonies of how the Lord is we can look back in our lives and even before we ever started serving God we can say where you brought us through areas that we shouldn't be here today but we are and there was a reason amen let's stand and sing amazing Graces but the bad comes out and really looking forward to the service this morning [Music] uh Amazing Grace [Music] [Music] [Music] my heart is here and grace Of My Tears release [Music] [Music] [Applause] Happy Days [Music] [Music] [Applause] God grace God praise God praise God praise God oh praise God praise God praise God [Music] praise God praise God praise God praise God thank you amen how many come to praise the Lord this morning let's sing that little song if we could I don't know what you come to do [Music] well I don't know what you came to do but I came to praise the Lord I don't know what you need to do but I came to praise the Lord but I don't know what you came to do but I'm gonna praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah well the devil don't like it but I don't care I'm gonna praise the Lord the devil don't like it but I don't care I'm gonna praise my lord the devil don't like it but I don't care I'm gonna praise the Lord Hallelujah [Music] amen praise the Lord God certainly is good thank you musicians it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and just want to take time just to spend a an hour or two or three or however long it takes to Just Praise the Lord and share the words so I don't want to keep you long this morning but just until I finish so some of you caught that uh if you want to be turning in your Bibles I'm going to read from a couple of portions of scripture uh first John and then I'm also going to Reign from read from Saint John and uh just thinking and listening to the testimony of our brother how good God is and he's always faithful and on time and he knows our needs before we even have need of them uh he's our protector he's our healer he's our God he's our financial advisor he's our counselor we can just go on for hours of what God does for us and and what he does for through us um you know just uh just a quick testimony the other day uh and and I didn't I didn't even think about this till the brother was speaking and I just thought how good God is uh Weston was up at the at the house the other day riding the four-wheeler and just kind of getting away and uh wasp got after him as he was sitting there watching the deer he jumps off the four-wheeler and starts dancing and probably screaming you know a little bit about this red wasp and right when he's getting ready to step and running from this walls he looks down and there's a copper hit he was one step away from stepping right on it and we sat down at the dinner table I said you know what that was I said that was just the hand of God showing you where where not to put your footsteps I said because you were you should have been bitten you were that close they don't play they they're aggressive they don't play but God is mindful of every step we take I want to speak to you this morning if we could on the comforter and The Advocate the comforter and The Advocate um you know we're in a late hour I'm gonna I'm gonna let you stand for just a minute it it uh it'll do us some good to get legs stretched right so uh thinking about this I thought you know we're living in a late hour we're living in an hour where sin is rampant and we know that is not nothing new to us it shouldn't take us by surprise uh it it doesn't take God by surprise the Bible tells us and I'm going to get into some of that the Bible tells us as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be so when we hear about homosexuals and we hear about transgender and and we hear about all these different uh events that's happening and and wars and rumors of wars and the political parties are absolutely uh inspired by the devil whether you like him or not no matter what what side of the fence you're on left or right they're all inspired by something and I don't think it's a heavenly and so you know I'm thinking about this and and uh just was listening to a little clip that Joe has pulled up there's a weather man that does uh clips and stuff and he was talking about the New Madrid fault as many of you know we are just miles from the New Madrid fault line and he said that scientists have proven that it's 35 years past due of a major event now the last major event run church bells in Boston it busted sidewalks in Washington DC and so this next major event who knows I hope we're gone it'd be nice to have taken a Rapture right before that happened and get out of here but the world is shaken and they said the New Madrid is waking up um if any of you know where Nebo is it's just a little town maybe 30 40 miles north of here had a 2.5 I think it's probably closer to Brother John and his family maybe up that kind of that direction um Nebo they had a 2.5 earthquake last week and another one followed it up and we're right here on the we're on the line and uh you know so things are shaking they shouldn't surprise us what that should tell us is hey we're at the end we're at the end to where God is going to raise up somebody we're that somebody we're that standard that's going to have to be raised up to a higher level let me read this to you this is Brother Brown I'm speaking who is The Advocate Jesus Christ the righteous and he is a propitiation for our sins and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate what is an abdicator what does it do he makes advocate he has Mercy it stands in your place it stands in your place and it says it does things that you cannot do this Advocate is an amazing thing that we need the holy spirit is a believer's must because it does think it makes me do things that I'm not capable of doing it'll make you do things in your life that you're not capable of doing he says it's a propitiation for your sin it's righteousness it's your healing it's your life it's your Resurrection it's all that God has for you that's what this Advocate is that's what this this uh propitiation does he says and here we go we can go into details he says and he makes intercession for our ignorance he says sometimes we got the Holy Ghost praise the Lord sometimes we have the Holy Ghost and he says [Music] we ignorantly stagger into something how many has ever been in that place you know you're born again you know you've got the Holy Ghost you're feeling LED and inspired by God and the next thing you know you find yourself in a situation in a place listening seeing hearing talking and you think man I've got myself in a pickle here this is not where God wants me to be in our ignorance sometimes we find ourselves there and he said but he's the advocator for us he's our attorney he stands in pleas for us he plays your case to God he please on your behalf he says because you can't plea for yourself we can try all we want God I knew I shouldn't God I wished I hadn't God I knew better we need an advocate in our life that goes Before the Throne of God and says God I'm not worthy please forgive me that Advocate speaks on our behalf and he says the Holy Spirit giving utterance he says and when we walk into things like a little kid he said we're walking in the dark in a world full of enemies and full of sin and full of traps and full of everything and he said you say oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take a Christian Life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid to do that don't be afraid because we have an advocate Don't Be Afraid we have an advocate he stands by us he stands in us he makes intercession for us the Holy Spirit he says constantly constantly constantly making an advocate for us all the time constantly on our behalf brother Russell good to see you and your family he said it's a seal a sign a spirit of Life the god of Heaven the comforter the Life The Advocate what he is oh my we could go on for hours um turn with me into the book of First John chapter 2. first John chapter 2. then we'll let you have your seats here in just a minute brother Butler I'll tell you it must be getting hot outside because it was getting hot in there I don't know if that air is working in there John first John chapter 2. now John speaks of this Advocate five times four times in uh in Saint John and once in first John and here's where he speaks about it this is considered one of the most intimate and inspired writings in all the Bible uh aside from the Song of Solomon and John opens with the words little children little children meaning the born ones how many this morning can say we're born again we're the born once so John here is speaking he says little children the Born Again Sons and Daughters of God Little Children these things are right unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is a propitiation for our sins and not only ours but the sins of the whole world that propitiation that word right there means the act of gaining favor or making things right with someone especially after having done something wrong isn't that amazing the man who could do no wrong stands in the gap for us to all we can do is wrong because we're born in flesh and then let's go down to the end of that verse six he says and he the saith he abide in him all to himself also to walk even as he walked so if we're going to gain the benefits of this propitiation if we're going to gain the benefits of this Advocate that stands in the gap for us the word tells us that we ought to walk the way he walked we ought to do the things that he did we ought to say the things he said turn with me now to Saint John chapter 14. here we at the notice we're at the last passover supper supper's just ended Jesus has just washed the disciples feet he's explaining to him about what's about to happen and tell them where he's going what's happening and what they're supposed to do and thank God that Thomas was bold enough to speak up and ask what everyone else in the room was thinking and afraid to ask we you know we get we get hard on Thomas sometimes and and we laugh and we poke fun at Thomas but do you realize if he hadn't asked the question of where are you going who are you what is what are we really what have we witnessed what's really happening here if he had not asked that question do you know we probably wouldn't have had a clear picture of who we are and what the Spirit-filled believer's supposed to do in our day and he asked a question and got the elephant out of the room that everybody wants to know the answer to can you imagine all them looking at Thomas like look at this guy I wonder what he's gonna say and he looks at him and he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and what Greater Works than me shall he do because I go to my father so Jesus was telling him hey brothers it's your time to shine I'm leaving this place all of the wonderful Miracles you've seen the blind eyes that's been opened the ears that's been opened the healings have taken place the demonic spirits you've seen cast out through my Ministry all of these wonderful life changes that changing events that you've witnessed now that same Authority is being handed to you because I'm leaving I'm leaving here and verse 13 says and whatsoever you shall ask him my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name what's it say one more time so if you the believer are living the life of a Believer and you ask anything in the name of Jesus he'll do it that's some powerful words right there I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments he stresses that keep my Commandments and I will do it the problem is sometimes we don't keep all the Commandments and he says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we're thankful to be in your house this morning Lord and just wanting to stand this morning humbly before the people humbly before your bride Lord with this little thought that you've placed on My Heart Lord and I pray Lord that it will be a blessing to your your bride Mrs Jesus Christ I trust it will lift us up it will encourage us it will show us who we are I trust Lord that it will bring us closer to you that we would be uh those that are doing the Greater Works as your word says Lord we just want to tell you we love you we appreciate you and dedicate this service into your hands Lord in Jesus name we pray amen you may have your seat sorry to keep you standing so long the word as we're looking here I'm going to focus on verse 16. and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever this scripture here came to me about six months seven months ago and it completely changed my way of thinking in a good way of Who We Are of who Jesus would have us to be it completely inspired me to look at the Bible through a different set of eyes from the very beginning uh at the children of Israel even to the to the where they put the blood over the Leno and the token was applied it brought it down into the the Book of Judges where I seen the men that was overcoming in the Book of Judges it brought it all the way down into uh the Psalms or I could see where David's life was inspired by this comforter it brought it down into Peter and James and John and it brought it into Mary and I began to see this is something more than what I've ever thought the holy spirit is an essential need we have to have it and if we don't have it we got to get it because there is a bride that's going to be a special group of people it's not an everyday Christian Life that in and out of church here there ups and downs woes and and giving in to the world the believer the Bride of Jesus Christ is a holy ghost filled power with authority type bride foreign look at this word another comforter another when you look at that in the Greek it means an identical or just just alike so Jesus Is Telling Brothers I'm leaving here I'm going to go prepare a place for you I'm going to prepare a Heavenly home for you so that when I come back you can leave this old hellish world you will leave this place you won't have to rub shoulders with those nasty dirty hairy demons up in the the abide in this world anymore you won't have to sit and watch two men walk down the street holding hands anymore you won't have to look and watch two women locking lips and kissing and loving on each other anymore at the stop lights on the sidewalks in the malls in the restaurants you won't have to worry about seeing men dressing up like women wearing high heels and painting their lips come on this is the world we're living in and Jesus is telling me you won't have to worry about that you know Disneyland listen to this Disneyland of all places Cinderella has now become Cinder fella have you seen this has anybody in here seen it raise your hand if you have I'm not sure which park it is but it's Disney they have a place where there's a man standing out there and Cinderella dress with a mustache and inviting the little kids come in you can be you can be a princess if you want little boys come on in you can be whatever you want just come on in we'll dress you up and put you in a cute pink little skirting and pink little sandals and you can just parade around and you can be a princess that is inspired straight out of the pits of hell for a place that has the of the public uh presentation in the audacity to to lure little boys little children three four five years old in and say come here dress like a girl it's the age we're living in it's part of this scripture or part of the where brother Brown said there must be 200 000 demons be poured out before the Rapture takes place they were rubbing shoulders with them day after day and but you remember now Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of son of man he said see we are everybody will agree we all agree with that we all agree that we're in a solemn condition listen he says I picked up a Los Angeles paper this is 1965. I picked up a Los Angeles paper here not long ago and it said homosexuals is on the increase by 30 percent each year you know you can do compound interest and one point five percent grows pretty quick over 40 years into a big big number so 30 every year he said it's horrible the government is horrible everything's perverted the whole thing the whole system the church is all perverted brothers sisters that's the condition that we're living in it's in time and like I said earlier this is no surprise to God it didn't catch him off guard that men are dressing like women we look at it we magnify but we we fail to remember that somebody's going to keep the standard somebody's gonna raise up that standard the book of Isaiah says when the enemy comes in like a flood and how many can say we've seen a flood of evil spirits in this last day a flood you can feel it when you go out in public used to you could go to a restaurant have a decent meal used to you could drive to Clarksville and get around used to you could go to Nashville and enjoy not anymore I hate it I hate going out I hate going to Nashville I took a 30-minute detour the other day just because I didn't want to drive by 24. because of the road rage the spirit the evil that's out there you don't know what the person next to you is doing look at them wrong they'll shoot you it's an evil evil age we're living in but just as Isaiah said it will say the evil will come in like a flood it says the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against it there is a standard that's going to be lifted up are you with me this morning is this working who is the standard we are the standard where are the standards Jesus said listen fellas I'm gone amen without me it's not going to be easy maybe it isn't Arizona brother Russell maybe life is easy maybe they don't Mock You in Arizona or in Louisville but he says it's not going to be easy you're going to have to take a stand you're going to be mocked you're going to be ridiculed you're going to be made fun of they're going to try to tear you down they're going to try to destroy the family altar um how do they do that how does Satan and his little evil spirits do that time time if they can occupy your time if they can occupy your time where the family can't sit down at dinner the family can't talk about the goodness of God well the family can't get together and pray together read the Bible together hey I'll tell you I'm guilty we're guilty I think I probably all of us are guilty to some point where's a few honest ones here time he wants our time he takes our time they tear down the altar but Jesus says don't worry don't worry I won't leave you comfortless I won't leave you comfortless don't worry little bride in this last day in this last age I will send a comforter to you I will send another comforter and that comforter will make you walk like me it'll make you talk like me it'll make you act like me it'll make you forgive like me it'll make you love like me it'll make you have joy like me and happiness like me and peace like me and authority over sickness like me and authority over death like me is anybody with me this is what he said that comforter is going to do for you death brothers and sisters is just a bump in the road when we begin to realize that that anything in this world really doesn't matter that life was before the foundation and it lives Eternal there's no end to life when you die you just cross over it's just a bump in your journey sickness heartache heart attacks disease diabetes bump it really doesn't matter it's irrelevant I'll give you another comforter this is the word that caught me months ago the comforter and I mentioned it in a service that I preached just briefly but it stuck out to me I couldn't get away from it the comforter in Greek is paracletos it's not a new word it's in the all Scofield Bibles been there since 19 whatever paracletose and it means one called alongside to help mine uses it four or five times in that context one caught a long side to help so you mean to tell me brothers and sisters when all hell is stacked against me when all hell is stacked against you in this day and you're battling depression and you're battling fear and anxiety and cancer disease and diabetes you're battling all these things and the devil has you even doubting the very walk of God and tells you you're not even going to make a rapture yeah does he ever tell you that because he has told me that you're not going to make a Rapture when all of hell is stacked against you like that look at the Devil and say devil you're a liar double you're a liar because I know one who's caught alongside me to help I know an advocate today I know an advocate who fights my battles and he's never lost a war Psalms 46 says that God is our strength and our refuge a very present help in a time of trouble what do we have to fear or ours are worries our worries why are we why do we fear Prophet says who is this Spirit then what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ in you the comforter the Holy Spirit and when the comforter has come he will do the very same thing that I've done while the comforter is in me he said I'll pray the father and he'll give you a comforter you know the comforter the world don't know him you see I said there's something different about a Christian and a bride not everybody knows this comforter because that comforter is the Holy Spirit there's Christians there's Christians Christians Brides brides churches churches but without that Holy Spirit you can't have that relationship with that comforter the one who comes alongside you to help the one who's there in the ever-present time of trouble and need he says listen you know the comfort of the world don't know him never will but you know him because he dwells now with you you Jesus speaking he said I shall be in you there you are that's the comforter shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless he said now that's the comforter that's the Holy Ghost so brothers and sisters we have an advocate this morning we have an advocate this morning that Holy Ghost Advocates us there for us to fight our battles yes and a quarter long you have attorneys you have a prosecutor and a defense attorney I don't need a prosecutor he's already out for me he's already prosecuted he's already pressing charges he's already making accusations but what I have need of as a defense attorney I have an advocate that says I'm your defense attorney I'll plea for you I love you I defend you I'll overcome sin for you and I'm going to place Holiness in you Holiness you made them you may message people can still have holiness you ain't message people can still run and shout and clap and praise and and are you kidding me yes God said I'm your Advocate I live in you I'll dwell in you I will be your holiness let me tell you this may hurt a little bit this may sting some if it does it does but let me tell you this this Advocate I'm talking about this this Holy Ghost this power and this Authority that I'm talking about and fixing to illustrate it's not for the weekend warrior oh it's not for the fair weather Christian no no that's not who this is for it's not for the person who just shows up when I feel like it it's not for the person that that you know you don't get the kind of overcome power you don't get that overcoming power if you don't have enough strength to come to church just cause you're tired on Wednesday night um well it's not for that Christian that says well Sunday Sunday morning is all I need thank you Your Average churchgoer anything else matters jobs matter Money Matters cars matter fun matters ripping and running matters but when it comes to the house of God I'm just too tired I can't do this man I had to work all day today and I had to fix supper for the youngins and man I just need to kick my feet up God understands he knows I'm tired it's not for the Christian who can't come to church because everything's not just right the music's just not right the song leader just ain't right the preacher ain't right the temperature ain't right the Hypocrites ain't right I can't go to church because brother so-and-so goes there you ain't got it buddy [Applause] you're missing it you need to find a place where you don't get on your prayer bones get on your knees and say God let me come before your throne and clean out anything that hinders me from being in the house of God if it's job if it's family if it's wife get your house in order you know we could all come up with a million reasons and excuses not to be here amen if it's a problem with the church go to your pastor no that's what he's there for he's your he's your leader he's your guys when you got a problem if you got a problem with this brother and you can't work it out and it's just hindering and festering on you go to the pastor and say brother Butler I just got to talk to you about this this is hindering my walk with God because of this am I wrong or what do I need to do you asked a question you better be ready for an answer it may not be the answer you like but if we believe he's LED man of God to be here that's who we ought to go to boy something's just pulling at me here somebody's pulling at me I just wonder if brother Byler come up here we just all agreed he's the lead man of God to be in this in this in this town he's our leader he's he's our God he's he's trying to get every one of us every single one of you here he wants to see you in that rapture that's his goal that's his mission God is placing the desire on his heart to say I've got to get these people ready to go so what would happen if he said I want to have 10 nights of service that's that's mild compared to what used to happen six eight nine ten weeks every night not missing a service I wonder how many pews how many people how many how many Tails will be setting to infuse well you got that for free how can we be ambassadors and representatives for Christ if all we find ourselves doing is murmuring and complaining and finding fault holding grudges laying out a church praise God I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I can't stand that brother God don't like him either I know he don't because I don't like him righteous brother Brown said the enemy will come the enemy will come and when he does what's he say there cling cling that much closer together why is it so easy to go take part of things that's out in the world but it's hard to get together to have a fellowship with Believers of like Precious faith cling more close together and the one that the devil is using for your enemy will either get out or he'll come in and be one of you so you mean to tell me that guy that I can't stand I've got to be even nicer to him I've got to be kinder to him I've got to display more Christianity to him than I do the brothers that I love how am I going to do that God the comforter the comforter he says well now God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another write that with one another I'm gonna tell on myself I know more about people in my community than I know about some of you in this church does that make it right I know but if we're in an hour when the enemy's coming in this flood of evil is come don't you think we might ought to put our arms around each other a little closer don't you think we might ought to say hey bring your Holy Ghost lick a holy ghost over here and let's meet everybody meet on Wednesday night and let's just see what God will really do when this look of fire and Slick of fire and that lick of fire and this liquor fire all come together it's gonna be a hot one in here when the fire burns like that cling together here's the quote nobody likes the home go the home stairs they don't like this one don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder and get in there to fellowship with your brother it didn't say you can't hardly wait to start your boat and go to the lake on Sunday it didn't say you can't hardly wait to get to the baseball field on Sunday for junior to play and travel ball I've been there I know and I know the feeling when you think man I gotta sacrifice Church or my kids my kids going to be the one that can't go to the ball game because his Holiness Daddy pulls him out and he's got to go to church I've been there I ain't always made the right decision but I can be honest about it I don't want to make that this is the wrong decision again anytime the doors are open you want to be in there and get in there and fellowship with your brothers and he says if you don't feel that way it's time to go to praying he said the Bible exhorted us much more gather as you see the day approaching love one another assemble yourselves in Heavenly places listen now this is important if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't ever let me take a root of bitterness if you want something to destroy your life let a little rude bitterness spring up you'll start seeing every little fault every little failure every little thing that you can possibly see the devil will will highlight it and put it under a magnifying glass and you'll see that Brother In a Different Light you'll see that sister in a different life for the rest of your life until you get to the altar bitterness hatred jealousy it begins to grow he says I'm an ambassador of Christ has Authority the ambassadors got the the power that's on the throne he says listen to this as long as as long as that exists talking about fear and trembling and wondering what will happen wondering and wondering this and wondering that and and doubting if things will happen if the power of God he said as long as you got that as long as that exists the church can never stand upright you could come to church every every time the doors open but if you don't realize who this Holy Ghost is and the power that lays within it you can't stand upright he says when we talk every talk of fear is vanished the holy spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and that church has the power he says it has everything that heaven owns behind them you talking about a powerful group of people when we get to a place that we have no more fear no more doubts and we know exactly who we are and we're living with our lives filled with the Holy Ghost and that means that all of Heaven everything that heaven owns all the streets of God all the crystal Rivers all the Seas all the love can you imagine that perfect love that we're striving for it'll stand behind you we become a new creature we become a new creation something has changed because it's no longer us speaking but it's God he's a Christ you go into all the world you are my Witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come to you that's what a witness is it's an ambassador it's a witness the whole powers of Heaven is right in your hands can you handle it ask yourself are we at a place that we can handle that can we handle the whole powers of Heaven in our hands because it's there I didn't say that he said that either you believe it or you don't you can take it up with him on the other side but he said that all the power of Heaven is in your hands why do we set why is the church Barren why is it doing it because we don't recognize these things it's so easy so easy to get caught up in the thing round the church just becomes humdrum I gotta go oh no it's Wednesday I forgot we got carry in I forgot it's communion I guess I'm gonna get out of here but let's look at what the powers can do and what the power of God can do in the hands of his believers still got some time are you with me no we look here and we say Noah Noah was just a farmer many times we fail to realize how our insignificant lives are just like the insignificant lives of those in the Bible and here's Noah just an everyday farmer who goes up gets up in the morning fixes his breakfast he gets his eggs his ham and bacon his biscuits goes out Till's the field works all day but the promises there come a time that that man had to come to a place of purpose he had to come to a place of purpose and he said it's something that would change him anytime a man meets God he will never be the same once he meets God and here's Noah out working praise the Lord here's Noah out working till in the fields and God comes to him and says I've got a purpose for you what do you want me to raise more corn if we're not putting enough up in the in the crib uh what we don't need to raise more wheat what do I need to do God no I need you to build a boat a big boat a boat what do I need to build a boat for well you say no it's going to rain what's rain there never had been any moisture on the Earth no rain had ever fallen there was not even the word rain spoken to that time what's your name just build the boat so like I said what we have to do we have to realize that the things in this world really don't matter so Noah spends the next several years pounding away on a boat he's not worried about farming he's not worried about cattle he's not worried about pigs he's not worried about chickens he's not worried corn wheat grain he's pounding on a boat and I say look at you you're crazy man you're going to lose everything you've got what are you doing well I'm building a boat why are you building a boat because God says it's gonna rain what language is God speaking Noah because I've never even heard that word tell us Noah what is rain I don't know when's it coming I don't know is there going to be a Rapture yes it is is there coming away yes there is there's going to be a going away yes there is when is it I don't know God said it and Noah stands here under the anointing of God and he's building this boat over and over day after day pounding away at this boat a man of insignificance inspired by God here we got David here's David this ready little fella to be anointed king Samuel goes down here and he he Samuel gets a word from the Lord and the Lord says go down to the house of Jesse and he's got some boys down there and my next anointed king is in that house I'll let you know when when you find him so he goes down there says well how am I going to do this God they'll they'll persecute me when they find out what I'm doing when i'm trying to overthrow King Saul he said we'll go there and make a sacrifice go to the house of Jesse tell him you're making a sacrifice and then look for this anointed the one we're going to anoint King a little bit of wisdom there trickery whatever you want to call it God knows what he's doing so Jesse had our Samuel heads out down there to Jesse's house and he starts going through and he says I'm here to look at all these boys I'm going to anoint one God told me to anoint one of your boys Jesse as king the anointed man of God you know how proud Jesse must have felt throw them shoulders back it's good to see you Samuel come on in here's my boys one by one by one by one they're being looked at Samuel then comes down there to his oldest iliab and he says this has got to be the one he looks like a king he acts like an ID he's fit like a king he's muscular he's tall he's handsome he looks like a leader this man can replace Saul you know Samuel made a mistake by judging eliabs basis on his appearance because they had already made a mistake of picking one king based on his appearance Saul was a mistake Saul was chosen because he looked the part he acted the part he he looked like he could be a leader and he could lead people he was favored amongst people he stepped in there and God said this is not the man of the hour for me but Samuel looks at this guy he lives and says I think this was the replacement God says Samuel Samuel Samuel you're looking through the wrong set of eyes you're looking with what man looks at can be you're looking at what man looks at I want you to look at what I'm looking through ask him if he's got any more boys Jesse I just stopped feeling that this is the this is the way we ought to go here do you have any more boys oh well he ain't much of a man boys right he's out there with the Sheep you know he never even called his name didn't even recognize him by name he's out there tending to the Sheep he stays out there all day he don't know nothing about leadership he don't know nothing about anything he just sits out there all day all day after day after day talking to those sheep and talking to God he does what I said he sets up there all he can talk about is God how much he loves God and how much he loves nature and how much he loves the goodness of God and the things that God does for him that's not all that boy can do is talk about God I want to see him bring him in here let me talk to him for a minute oh no we're not gonna bring him I won't sit down Jesse till he comes in this house and Samuel sits there it's bold and bold sits there and says I want to see this boy and here comes David brothers and sisters we may not be the most intellectual people we may not be the most well thought of people in our own family circles we may not have any Prestige any notoriety any fame or Fortune but when God is in it little is much and here's little Davis this Ruddy little fella has now been called up there and he's looking before him and Samuel's looking at him and says David you look nice but you don't look like a king he didn't look the part of a king 10 to 14 years old they say and Samuel is going to say this is our next anointed king you're a nice looking boy David and the Lord said Samuel arise arise and anoint him he is he is the one arise and anoint him he is the one see God's choice of David was we don't have to quit our jobs he was 10 years old [Music] a lot of times we think if we're going to do anything for Christ we got to go to the extreme oh I can't do I can't go I can't do this I have to give up this and I have to give up that he didn't ask him to give up nothing he said just be anointed and I'll take care of the rest so Samuel that comes and he gets the anointing all and he takes the anointing and pours it over the head of David and can you imagine as Jesse and the brothers what in the world is this quack doing where did he come from we thought we thought this man was really holy we thought he was really special he wanted to come in and anoint one of us King and he chooses him he's lost his mind but David has spent time David knew God David had trusted God the real anointing happened when the Holy Spirit come upon David David's life began to change under the anointing of the Holy Ghost under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and David on that day received an advocate from God are you with me David was out in the field 10 in the flock and a line comes up to take the flock and David can't get there and he grabs him by the beard it says not today Satan a boy a boy of 10 to 14 years old a bear comes to take Israel take it from the flock and steal from David and David goes up to this growling bear and says not today Satan how could he do that how can you do that how can I do that by the power of God that's within us by the anointing of God it's on his people David face is now this big filthy uncircumcised philistine that's a mocking the whole Army and nation of God boy if we haven't seen some of that what are you doing man if you've seen this guy David huh I've seen and he's cursing us he's mocking us he's laughing at us he's tearing down our religion I said somebody's gonna have to raise up to the standard and David says thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistines shall be just like one of them because I serve a living God and David says moreover than that the Lord that delivered me out of the paws the line now the Paul of the bear he'll deliver me out of the hands of this Philistine brothers and sisters David was facing a gigantic problem in his life he was facing a problem like he had never seen a problem that was that was defined the whole Army of God and David is facing this how many of you can say brother Brad sometimes I feel like I'm facing gigantic problems in my life sometimes I feel like the Giant's too big sometimes I feel like I can't stand David looked at this Philistine and he goes out there and he says not today Satan not today Satan it's not going to happen today and David goes out to this Philistine and says you come at me with the sword and a spear and a shield you think that scares me you see a lot of times we let the devil get his blood thin on us that Big John had been sitting there bluffing a whole Army of grown men muscle-bound sword bearing Shield bearing armor-bearing soldiers have been bluffing them day after day after day and we allow those gigantic problems in our life to do us that way not today Satan David comes out there and he says you come at me with all this but I come to you in the name of the lord of the hosts of God this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hands confession positive confession today the Lord will deliver thee into my hands and I will smite thee and I'll take your head off um how many is willing to take the head off your enemy today I like when it says David reached into that bag and he pulled out that little Stone and he began to slang it and the more he slang at the faster the more velocity it gained until he finally let it go and he said it sunk into his head now the most profound thing that I think that I like about this story is it said David ran over to him he didn't have a sword but he said he ran over to him and stood up on the philistine you're under my feet Satan and he grabs him by the head pulled his own sword and slays his head off and says now I Reign not today Satan that's the power of God Gideon is a man in hiding he's afraid but God says God the brother Brown says God can't use a man that's afraid if you're afraid of your animal if you're afraid of the things that's hindering you and hounding in you and and coming after you God can't fix that you have to trust God and find yourself unafraid Gideon have to send all of them that was scared away God wants Heroes that's what he said God wants Heroes he wants something that's Brave he said he wants someone who will stand up and talk that's not scared to tell you or tell your boss or anyone else that Jesus Christ the son of God has saved me from life of sin we all know that feeling don't we when you guys say it then you don't want to say it you're in a place you're in a position and you think man I can't I just can't I just can't say it they're asking me about church and they're asking me about this and I've asked me about that I just can't say it and somebody something just keeps saying say it say it say it say it we were in the store the other day Joyce and I and it was just us and the clerk there we're here come this husband and wife in dress holiness and she looks at Joseph says what church do y'all go to I said oh boy so she said we go to the evening like Tabernacles down the road well what do y'all believe here we go [Applause] I said we believe in Holiness we believe in the every word in the Bible and we follow the teaching of William Brown okay I'm out of here that's what she said that's what she did you thought I touched her with a hot poker when I said that it was a conversation over we're out of here she knew she knew she knew that name she knew those prophecies she knew the healing she knew the ministry but she didn't want none of it um God wants somebody that'll stand up Gideon now standing there The Field's been sown the crops are ready to be brought in and it says that Israel had sown the midianites came the amalekites came the children of the East even they came up against them I know who they were I didn't look deep into it but I thought that's astounding that the Bible says and even they came against them everybody's against them and they had camped about them and they destroyed the increase they left no sustenance for Israel no food no sheep no oxen no cattle no grain and they come up there and they begin to take everything and it says Israel was greatly impoverished because of these midianites and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord and you know what the Lord said he said didn't I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptians didn't I deliver you out of those the hands of those that oppressed you didn't I drave them out from before you and gave you their land yeah I think that I think that was me I think I'm the one that done that I think I'm the one that done that for you I am the Lord your God not the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell I've given it to you and the angel of the Lord it says set underneath the oak tree and begin to watch the scene here and here's Gideon hiding afraid scared he's in there threshing his weak behind closed doors you know you're supposed to thrash weed out in the field and on a Hilltop so that the wind can throw it can blow away the trash and he's in there in a little low Dusty room no doubt choking on the dust in there trying to thrash sweet can't even breathe and the Lord looks at him what are you what are you doing oh my Lord if you would be with us it's something about it when you know where you're supposed to be living and you know you're not living there's a conversation you can carry on with God and you say oh Lord if you'll just give me one more chance if you'll just be with us one more time if you just just help me well in this situation one more time and get in there and the Lord says unto Gideon says surely I will be with thee and get in finds out the advocate in his hour of despair I will be with you I'll be your Advocate I will work for you I will we'll get all this we'll take all this over when all hope was lost God stepped in and said I'll be with you and you know the story we'll condense it get him now he's got 32 000 men and God said that's too many that's too many men send all them home that's afraid ten thousand go home or 22 000 or 22 000 gone ten thousands left 12 000 go home ten thousands left I'm not good at math I'll admit it now we got ten thousand men so that's still too many we need to narrow it down some more you said you'd be with me Lord I'll do whatever you say take some down by the Brook you know the story those that lapped like a dog you look you look you look you look that's the word in Greek it means lap like a dog because it sounds like a dog laughing yellow you look send them home but those that are aware of the enemy without fear I want those man 300 men to take on over a hundred thousand but God said surely I'll be with thee surely I'll be with thee so what did he do he separated them into groups it says now when we'll come together you go on this side you go on this side you're on this side and God said to break our pictures light our lamps blow our trumpets and brothers and sisters when God steps in the enemy has to flee they were scared to death they run they thought they were fixing to be overtaken and now the Gideon and his people all get to eat [Music] thank you foreign trying to hurry now sometimes God has to put us in Unfortunate Events or unfortunate times or uncomfortable is the word I'm looking for uncomfortable days on our journey there was a little girl about 13 years old just an innocent little girl an angel of the Lord comes down to her and says Hail Mary Thou Art highly favored what does the next sentence say the Lord is with thee here's this girl now that becomes favored among all women it says for good for her not to fear and God is going to let her bring forth a son and you'll call his name Jesus well that sounds pretty enticing to a young girl probably about that age and no doubt some fear and some some uh thoughts about wondering how this is all going to play out bands I hadn't ever been with a man foreign says there's a decree to go out we have to have a journal of everybody oh God says we can't be doing that so Mary you're going to have to take your pregnated self and you're gonna have to ride a donkey for 10 miles a day for 10 days and you're going to have to ride through some of the most grueling lands to get to Jerusalem you're going to have to ride through the lands that are infested with bears and lions and wild boars and bandits and robbers not to mention it's raining it's going to be a rainy season the cold weather could be moving in but I want you to think about this The Advocate was on the inside did you ever think that no matter what Mary went through on that Journey she would never go into premature labor no matter how rough no matter how bumpy there was never a dog there was never an animal a line a bear a boar there was not a bandit there was nobody that could touch her why because she had an advocate on the inside of her she had an advocate named Jesus who would die for the entire world and there was nothing out of the pits of hell that could touch Mary on this journey brothers and sisters when we find out that we've got that Advocate on the inside of us we have nothing to fear there should be nothing on this journey that hinders us or slows us down or puts doubt or fear in our lives but we press on just like Mary did [Music] it's time brothers and sisters for the bride of Jesus Christ to stand up and say when I am weak he's my strength we hear these scriptures but we need to apply these scriptures when I'm weak he's my strength when my adversary comes up against me I have an advocate that says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me not not my not my brother yeah I want him to be strengthened too but he strengthens me when my adversary comes against me when fear and doubt rise up God says I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that's the promise he made he's never backed out on a promise God has never told the first life he did this is all in vain God has never told the first lie when sickness comes our Advocate on the inside says I'm Healed do you believe that it's time to look the devil in the face and say not today devil because we've got a power today in the name of the Lord let me tell you how powerful this name of the Lord is it stood out to me as astounding Peter and John go into the temple at The Hour of Prayer the ninth hour and there was a man out there asking alms they were asking alms this man had been there for years everybody in the town knew this and he says silver on the give me some silver give me some gold and Peter and John look at him and what do they say silver and gold have I not but what I have I giveth thee rise up to your feet and walk now that's power isn't it that's power and that's authority to stand where we're good you're so Anointed with God that you can tell that to somebody and they rise up and walk let's go a step farther when they heard that Peter was coming into the city they had heard how powerful he was under the anointing of the holy spirit that they brought men and women crippled Oh I thought the whole city and laid them down on cots and mass and said if this the shadow of Peter will overcast them they'll be well and I think brother Brown said every single one of them if the shadow passed over was made well that's some Authority brothers and sisters we've got a lot to be thankful for that God would entrust us to be his ambassador that God would entrust us to and dwell as an advocate and a comforter the Holy Spirit leading and guiding us it's a huge responsibility but there is a bride that's built for it you're built for it look Satan in the eye and say not today Satan let's stand to our feet we got to get to the communion service you know God has given us so much peace and joy and love and happiness forgiveness we could just go on and on with all the fruits and all the goodness that God has given us and Satan his job is to kill steal and destroy and I thought about that little song and I'm not going to try to sing it but I thought about it and it says the world didn't give it the world didn't give me peace the world didn't give me happiness the world didn't give me my salvation the world didn't give me love the world didn't give me compassion and the world can't take it away God give it I accept it I claim it now I'm going to go live it let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father We Trust Lord that the message today would have encouraged and inspired someone to step up and see that how important it is for the advocate to be in our life the comforter the importance of the scripture as as we're a vessel a vessel that houses the Holy Spirit Lord and it is important in our lives Lord that we uh that would cherish that lick of fire that's on the inside of us that we nurture it that we live for that we love you that we be like a day we did all we can do is talk to you and talk about you Lord we're not trying to be fanatical but we just know we're in the end time we know we're at a late hour and we know we want to be ready whatever it takes to be ready that's where I want to be Lord and I don't want to make I don't want to make the mistakes that others have made in the past but Lord I want to find myself ready when the time comes Satan May growl he may Roar he may boast he may mock at us he may make fun of us but Lord I know the comforter has a final say the comforter has the final say and Lord as we get ready to turn the service over to our pastor for this communion service I can't help but think about that last night on that last passover when you were explaining all this to your Apostles and Lord as we take this communion service today May our hearts burn with inside as we take this communion knowing that you went away to prepare a place for us and we do this in honor in reverence to you because you dwell in US Lord help us to be a vessel of Honor today Lord we just love you Lord with all of our hearts and dedicate Our lives our thoughts our families our jobs our homes everything we do we dedicate to you Lord and we want you to be in the Forefront the preeminence we want you to be in the front lines of our life Lord first you are a priority Lord we love you Lord with all of our hearts in Christ's name we pray amen father you love the Lord today amen can we give the Lord a hand a clap of praise he's worthy of our praise [Applause] union service if you will turn your Bibles Amen to the First Corinthians amen how many believes that we do this in honor to the Lord because he has asked us to do this as often as we meet amen and to remember what he did for us amen because everything hinged on what he did First Corinthians the 11th chapter verse 23. for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this two years after she drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup he do show the Lord's death till he come whiffer whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup I mean he believes it's important that you search your own heart because you know where you stand with the Lord amen for he that he didn't drinketh unworthily eateth and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order amen when I come let's have a moment of silence as you judge yourselves make sure that everything's right in your heart with the Lord before you take of the communion Lord amen and amen everybody wants to line up over on this right side everybody wants to take up the communion today Amen Brother Steve you'll come and that Danny are you helping this morning amen come on up and uh the rest of you can be seated if you want and ask the blessing but then if you would on the bread yes Lord Jesus thank you before he was nailed to the cross for me he was nailed to the cross for me he was nailed to the cross for me at the cross crucified for me he was nailed to the cross over me he was there to the cross for me he was nailed to the cross for me at
