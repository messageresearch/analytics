prayer requests and uh sister john ace is not here she's not feeling well we want to remember her in prayer and i called her and i just forgot to do it she wasn't here sunday so she just said to remember her in prayer and also janet is at home and uh she kind of overdid it she went with me the other night i worked kind of late and she worked late at work and her legs swollen a little bit so she's home with her legs propped up tonight and they told her that would help get some of the swelling out so remember her also brother sean he's not feeling well tonight and i want to remember him in prayer he's not here tonight and also it says please have prayer for adriana she's not feeling well tonight either and also i talked to aunt martha the day sister jeanette had let me know that one of her granddaughters had passed away and she was 42 and at the present moment i her name just slips in my mind but uh i called sister martha and talked to her and she said remember said richard had just got over uh coed and he'd had back surgery right before that and said he wasn't doing very well and then his daughter passed away so to remember them in prayer very much and that god would just help them and she said they wasn't going to allow but 10 people at her funeral let's do the covet out there it's pretty bad so she has to remember them in prayer and also my sister i'd had prayer for her sunday she had coveted and they took her to the hospital she got dehydrated but she's back home and she's doing a lot better so we thank you for your prayers for that if you have need on your hearts you might let it be known without lifted hand remember our shut-ins by the parish and then brother brad would you pray over the offering tonight uh amen when the saints go marching in a stranger wandering through this world [Music] on [Music] the same [Music] [Music] oh lord i want [Music] oh i know i'll see my savior if my life is free from sin [Music] o heaven's doors will open [Music] marching in when the saints go marching in oh lord i want to be in that [Music] and when we get around the throne and the gates are closed with it oh i'll be shy but in glory oh yes when the saints go

go marching in oh when the saints go marching in oh lord i want to be in that number [Music] when the saints go marching hey man you want to be in that number tonight amen thank you lord amen we've got so much to praise him for and i uh you know i believe we've been taught with all of our heart if we'll only believe that all things are possible no matter what the circumstance is and sister hannah had wrote a a praise report and said we want to thank the lord employees in our business we had a big fire but by god's grace no one was hurt and you know it's just his grace and mercy that and he takes care of us and we thank him for and and i just want to just give him praise let's give him a hand to praise tonight for his goodness and mercy amen and amen these uh it's one of those nice new kind of cars and they don't get put out very easy with water and i told sister hannah i was i said uh she said we bought two of them and both of them will be trouble and i said i thought yeah i bought one and i sold it to somebody else because i i heard that you can get killed by them things it's one of those uh i call them hypocrite cars because they're always passing me and there's to be a energy efficient and good on gas and i said yeah that's not fair you are cheating but anyways we just thank the lord for that and god's been so good to us and i'm gonna ask the girls if they'll come sing tonight and [Music] so victory is my victory is mine victory today is [Music] victory today is [Music] victory is my victory is my [Music] victory today is mine [Music] victory today is my love is my love today is mine [Music] [Music] [Music] amen do you enjoy that let's give them another hand tonight i'm trying to figure out why brother thomas's door is always open when they sing and he's ready to come out maybe because he's grandpa amen surely appreciate that and amen there's nothing like seeing your children and your grandchildren serve the lord i i sure miss my little one coming and singing with me she keeps telling me she's going to come back to church but the devil just makes sure that she doesn't get that a chance but god will just give him a greater desire to in the house the lord you know he's the only one that can give him that desire you can preach to him all you want and say what you want but if god doesn't light that fire it doesn't do any good because if they come just because you want them to come somebody else can get them to go do something else so just remember my children in prayer and man they know the truth and they believe the truth but they've got good reasons they say why they don't go but we all know what that story is we all have seen that before but amen just pray for them god bless you let's stand tonight pray that song starts being a blessing to you we're gonna sing that course once again for the thomas comes tonight victory is mine well victory is mine oh victory is mine oh victory today is [Applause] [Music] oh victory is mine victory is mine [Music] [Music] praise the lord let's give him another hand thank you lord jesus again praise the lord god is good isn't he amen good evening everybody it's good to be back in the house of lords that'll be all for the music amen good to see everybody out tonight amen praise the lord well hallelujah it looks like the hot summer's about over amen cool weather is right around the corner amen i'm looking forward to it it won't be long we'll be saying when are we going to get that hot weather back it's so cold you know but one makes you appreciate the other donut amen it sure does so amen that's the way the lord have it but we know one of these days amen it'll be the perfect temperature every day every minute of the day can you imagine that that would be nice amen so it's coming with the help of the lord all right well i can't think of any special announcements so that's just our heads go before the lord in prayer kind heavenly father we once again are so grateful or to be assembled together lord jesus in your presence father to be able to open your bible lord and desire god that you'll just speak what you once said to our hearts tonight father and that you'll bless the meditation of our heart our study and our prayer father we just desire god that you'd have the preeminence in every portion lord and we do all remember all of those that are not here lord jesus for whatever reason we ask god you just be with each and every one or those that are streaming father we pray lord that there be a special anointing lord upon them father to be able to receive the word of god and that they could get their petitions met lord jesus for whatever they have need of father wherever they are we want to thank you lord for the be able to come tonight lord jesus assemble ourselves together in the midst of a pandemic that seems to be as bad as ever but yet father we just kind of continue on and serving you lord jesus we ask god that jesus bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart now in jesus name amen and amen amen if you will turn with me to ecclesiastes ecclesiastes amen ecclesiastes 3. amen verse 1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill a time to steal the time to break down and the time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn in a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace any time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and the time to cast away a time to rend and a time to sow a time to keep silent and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace amen may god his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated we want to talk to you a little bit with the help of the lord we're going to talk about mountaintop experiences valley experiences amen desert experiences and the different experiences that life amen has for us amen now man a title at micah title it the seasons of life all right the seasons of life amen i'm thinking it is solomon that wrote ecclesiastes amen and so i thought about that and i begin to thinking about the differences and the things how that how that there is uh seems to be like a season for everything in life and here he begins with verse two a time to be born and a time to die amen now how many knows we have all kinds of celebrations and things like that birthdays happy birthdays right and then whenever one is born as one once one comes into the world but you know it's completely different isn't it at a time of death amen one in one point one place you have a super high so to speak and then you have a super lows you have your ups you have your downs i mean i got to thinking about that song life is like a mountain railroad amen and talking about a train that is traveling on a railroad hut it has its ups it has its downs it has its ends it has its outs it has its good times it has its bad times now when brother brandon went over beyond the dimension of time he went over there and one of the things that he said was he says there's not when you get there is no it's not it's a good day and then a bad day it's not pretty good and then pretty bad he said it's just perfect all the time it's the same all the time amen and we can't even imagine in our mind what that perfection how that perfection is but you know i mean no doubt but every one of us thinks about the times perhaps some of the best times in our life you know the very best times in our life and you know no doubt a lot of us had a lot of good times amen really good times and it's uh god made it that way how many know that god made it this way it was actually in the plan god's plan it's the way that he designed it it was a it was specifically purposed for this for us to have seasons to have good times to have bad times amen amen and to be able to go on mountains all the way up on the top of the mountain sometimes you know you feel so good you feel so happy you feel overjoyed you know perhaps we could think about brother brandon running around the tree just praising god just over joy sometimes uh kids they'll get so happy they'll just scream right hey sometimes kids in church will get so happy they'll just scream out that's right y'all remember here at a time or two isn't that right sometimes we get so happy they just scream out we get so oh it's so so smart and what we can bear i think it was brother howard carroll i learned to saying something he says how are you doing something about oh so good uh you know i need two of me or something you know you know i need you need another one of me to enjoy this more the abandoned meat get religious and he'd get in the spirit he began to say well my shirt just fits a little better just right right and and everything is just so much better all of just feeling good amen and i begin to think about this and the purpose of it and what it's all about and how did god intends for it to be that way one time brother bannon makes a mistake and i think y'all probably remember he says you watch your family and that family uh you know they'll be running smooth and then we might take that as a plane going down the plane and everything will run smooth for a long time huh now i'm talking about something that probably every last one of us if we've lived over 20 can fellowship with this there's times when it runs smooth amen and then all of a sudden but the bible says man it'll begin to go bad and he says when it rains it pours they'll just man it'll just go really bad for a while we all know what it's like to have a a good day right everything just falls in place we all know what it's like to have a pretty bad day and then we know what it's like to have a real bad day how many has ever had them just seems like nothing goes right it's terrible right amen kind of like in our marriage or sometimes oh my you're just so in love and you'll have a big old argument and you're just furious you're all tore up well hopefully somebody don't know what i'm talking about there but it does happen right and you got to go back and you got to make up and and then you get to feeling better again but you know it can go from you know i believe it's probably god taught he says you know if you just have felio love his filial love is all you have that feel your love will turn to hate and as we know that filio love it'll go further if it goes too far and so forth and into murder and into killing people who once loved each other hello but we all know what it's like you know you have a pretty good days you have kind of good days well not too bad right things ain't going too bad you know but just to learn how to cope with that learn how to deal with that tonight we're going to learn how to cope with that and what god expects out of all of that amen we've said it many times but we're going to say it again is that right so we'll take an example first we'll start perhaps with i job i was joke man i'll tell you what he was on the mountaintop he was my his children were uh at a party right and i think that's what it was called they were at a party they were having a party together you know and where was job at job was somewhere in his closet somewhere and praying for his children lord if they've sinned in any way god forgive them forgive them and that what he was praying for his children his that's a concern daddy and he was there and he was rich he had everything you could imagine he had flocks he had herbs he had camels he had children he had a big family a big sweet wonderful family hello amen a season for it to go good nobody know this better than solomon not solomon how many knows you go back into the song of solomon different places where he talks about you know proverbs different vanity of vanities how life is vanity and oh he saw the vanity of this world and the vanity of life and i've come to the conclusion myself when i look at it bringing into a thought where brother branham talked about what this world and what this really is i never really thought about it that way until i preached on it and we was talking about how that in this world and how brother bam says when he become born again when he got the new birth he said he was in a what it was like he was in a nightmare he identified this world that we're living in as a nightmare and he's trying to wake up [Music] trying to wake up because you know i mean we as long as things are going pretty good for you and everything you know that's all fine and dandy but when you think about the pain that's out there you think about the murder that's you think about the filth that's out there you think about the evil that's out there you look at your nursing homes and the conditions that people get into when they get older it's no fun thing there's nothing joyous whatsoever it is truly a nightmare i mean as many of those people want to die please let me die since your hand back there not in the head brother bad you've worked there you know they don't want to live in this anymore when i left my army visited my army's bishop of when i was a child here he is and he can't function he can talk for a little bit and then he'll lose his focus and so forth and he'll say he doesn't know why he's up here anymore he wants to go down he wants to go there he kept talking about wanting to go down i know what he's talking about why can't he go down he wants to get out of this world he's done with his world amen and overall that's truly what the what it is this is truly what this world is is a nightmare [Music] how many knows it was a nightmare for lot lot lived in a nightmare when he lived in sodom and two angels came down and those sodomites they come in there and they were wanting to make a relationship with those guys they were beating his door down i don't know about you but if some bunch of homosexuals trying to beat my brother that would be a nightmare huh but how many of those they are trying to take over they are working their agenda pushing their agenda brother bam says if you send your kid to school there or what to become two-fold more a child of hell he didn't have much for schools at all back then huh look at it what it is today amen but anyway we won't go down there but i was trying to say when you think about the nightmare he was saying that that's what this world really is like for a believer if you're too if you're very at home here you better get on your prayer bones you better get it on your knees and realize hey this world is not a fit place to live anymore and it's getting worse by the minute i've said it before i want to say it again listen both here and on the streaming world this snowball is starting to snowball i mean it is really starting to come down over this hill it's going faster and isn't that exactly what the prophet of god said he says in the last few hours of jesus christ's ministry more scripture was fulfilled in the last few hours in his whole life he said that's how it's going to be just before the rapture those scriptures and things in prophecy they're going to fulfill real quickly we believe that that's what's happening it's happening and it's fulfilling very very quickly amen so anyway it's getting darker and you've got to think about it you know i think about the people that i've buried people that worked hard on life work one place were faithful for 40 years they had a great retirement plan and they dropped their first retirement check the next one we buried him huh i think he was right about one maybe they got one joe hendrickson huh at kensington he was you know he could have retired he could have had 15 20 years of kind of having it nice right well we know joe was a christian so we're not worried he has a greater retirement he would have ever had here is that right but what i was trying to say a while ago it's so that i would say that if it wasn't for the fact that truly is life after death if there is into heaven this wouldn't really be worth it it really wouldn't there's too much disappointment there's too much sorrow there's too much sadness there's too much pain there's too much horrible things it's a horrible world amen because it's governed by the devil if it wasn't for grace if it wasn't for god and that right if it wasn't for the fact that you know that god has had this plan and he allowed it to come into this to get a people ready amen are you with me together people ready to mold character in you and in me that's fit to live with him through eternity that's the purpose of times and seasons that's whether it's good that's where there's bad that's why you have your mountaintops and you have your valleys you have your deserts amen brother glenn i'm here to tell you sister i know what it's like to go through a spiritual desert yeah you walk and you walk and you walk and you walk and it's dry and oh my you're looking for an oasis you're looking for amen some trees you're looking for a little bit of water somewhere and oh it's just right it's just more hot more heat more more more troy toils more laboring just keep on you say boy is this ever gonna end huh now i'm going to say something i never said but just about the time you just wonder if there's ever going to be an end god brings light at the end of time god turns it all around all of a sudden you look over the horizon you see the top of a tree i see a top of a tree and i know where there's a tree there's got to be some grass hey where there's some grass there's got to be some water hello and you come and you reach you come out of that boy you can regard you can leap you can dance where before you didn't feel like dancing he didn't feel like shouting huh i call it a desert because it's long trials trials last not a week not a day it's not a bad day i know what it's like to not have a bad day i know what it's like not to have a bad month i know what it's like to have a bad decade huh right many many years amen you know i thought about this message and i thought about job i thought about joseph how did joseph you know he had a vision of how our vision our dream of how you know even his mom and dad you know they were even going to bow to him and do obesity and everything he had all of this and what happened one bad thing after another it happened to him i went back and read joseph a little bit today and her brother said we're gonna kill him [Music] huh and you talk about god controlling the brains how many knows god controls people's brains amen and one of the brothers said ah let's not do that we don't want to have blood and let's just throw him in this pit and they threw him in the pit and then all of a sudden some some foreigners come traitors and so forth like caravan come and they say hey let's just sell them to them huh and sell a kill of them amen that was god how many that was god in god's hand all in god's doing god had it all why you and i can rejoice to know that god don't allow something to come upon you unless it's permitted ah this shouldn't have been well sometimes maybe you bring things upon yourself huh but most of the time we know when that time is not right most of the time if you didn't pay your water bill you knew what was going to happen you didn't pay the electric bill and they even send you a tax you ignore that and when they shut it off and it cost you an extra 45 dollars for reconnection you know that wasn't god that was your stupidity your negligence things like that things that you do and bring upon yourself but when there's something that is out of your control maybe you don't understand then you know it's what god allows amen he had this goal that and joseph had to go through these things god allowed them to go through these things you my you would think that god would have a mediocre about this a little more mediocre a little bit not as hard maybe that is quite as comfortable no he didn't he allows it to get really bad i mean he allows it to get really bad like he did joe joe was on top of the mountain he was on top of the world and all of a sudden it come crashing down then how many knows it was god's doing that's right you go back read job job i mean god from what i understand talk to the devil talk to satan because he comes to the house he says have you checked out my son have you considered my servant job they ain't not like him they ain't not like my servant joke and the devil says yeah i know but you've got a hedge around him you got a hedge around him and if you take the head you out and you let things get bad he'll curse you to your face no he won't no he won't yeah he will no he won't yeah i will no we won't okay then well touch that's news let's see that says all right all right we'll do that i'll let you take it all the way all of these things just don't touch his life joke goes home on monday you talk about a bad week huh from the top of the mountain and i don't know about you but i wouldn't mind so much if i found out that all my camels got killed and the tornado came and got all my even my lambs and everything else really oh my oh my i lost all my sheep but i'll tell you i guarantee you just one thing it'll rip your heart out if you find out all your kids are dead knows we may scream to the top of our little lungs with joy sometimes but there's another time of life where you weep bitterly in this life you also find there's a season for weeping bitterly perhaps so strong that you can't even stand anymore you might fall to the ground you might pass out because of the immensity of the bitterness of having the love part with a loved one amen god help us you know we might lose our wife we might lose our husband we might lose grandpa or mom or dad or so forth and we know that's you know that's a certain amount of uh weeping a certain amount of sorrow but i understand they say that if you lose a child it's worse really bad if you lose your child one of your children go before you amen that's why us as parents probably all of us desire to go before our children do why because somebody knows it doesn't matter who or what them is your children and you love them with all your heart amen i hope i never have to experience it but in life you'll find that there's times when it's such bitter sorrow jesus even knew it the bible said he whipped bitterly isn't that right he knew what it was like to have to read uh raise lazarus from the dead but he also knew what he was to be betrayed by his friends and his everybody he'd be all alone to come to his own his own receive him not amen brother branham he said you know jesus didn't die from the spirit he died of a broken heart my died of a broken heart because i think if i'm not wrong be after he was dead they put that spear inside the water in the blood came out just to make sure he was dead amen but look at job from top all the way to the bottom amen and guess what can we say there's another season that is down from the bottom down from the bottom because remember job was faithful he said he worshipped went to church the next sunday he said the lord gave the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord and then there was another one made you know he said sure yeah you won that one god you got me there but i guarantee you you know the man will do that but you let me touch his flesh let me touch his flesh then he'll curse you to the face to your face god says nah i don't know about you brother glenn but if i'd have been god i said devil you're pretty dumb don't you know i know everything i already know what job was doing gonna dude so why are you standing here arguing with me you know i'm that smart you know i know the future amen but he's not too smart huh god said no you won't [Music] said the devil said yeah he will i he said let go at it go ahead and job got miserable he got boils on his skin i don't know what all kinds of stuff he got right it was horrible i don't know about you but i've been out in the woods and when i get bit that's horrible all right i don't like the scratch here i've got one right here and and just them chiggers driving me crazy i can't imagine what job all over his body [Music] kind of like pharaoh no wonder he let him go all them fleas under his sheets and biting himself he said get out of here i can't take it aboard that right just go of course it was after the death he was even stubborn enough to wait until death of his firstborn then he said go god got his attention but job boils and and he was on the ash sheep but oh he was so miserable and if you'll read it he cursed the day that he was born and all kinds of things that he said you know everything which he wouldn't have been born and all these other things but he never would say he never would curse god right and then what did god do give him a revelation amen that on the last days my in my flesh i shall see god he got a revelation of god and god restored his life back restored children back is that right brother bratton was wide enough to know that he said that he had given him over yonder his children were preserved you know let me just say this since it comes any parent that loses a child if they know have complete confidence that the child is in heaven they can have some confidence and some comfort because even paul said don't weep you know like those who have no hope because if you don't have any hope you're going to weep twice as much if you think they're lost but if you know that they have hope if you believe that they're there that is great comfort and knowing that his kids were there he knew they're in a better place and sure the house fell in on them killed them all we're all going to die some way somehow amen amen it's something that you think about it how many i don't know about you but i believe the bible says god gave us all things freely in life that we might enjoy it god does want you to enjoy life he does he gives us things freely and enjoy amen and now i'm thankful for that job he was restored all that so he went back up god raised him back up joseph he went through the horrible horrible it seemed like when it rained it poured you know it just doesn't come a little bit it just keeps coming keeps coming keeps coming how many knows god said that he wouldn't put more on you that you're able to bear what about those who can't bear it maybe they're not his huh because if you're his he promised he won't put more on than he can maybe somebody was impersonating or something i don't know but i know god is true amen so how many is going on for that that guy won't put more on you then he can bear i was looking up smooth running and so forth because i was looking up where he was talking about a family i'd run smooth and everything and i've come across this place where he says he believed that it was lincoln or one of them that said he says he was made the statement in time of peace prepare for war he says and that would be a good for us thing for us to think about it in the time when everything's running smooth he says you better get ready isn't that the truth oh my we love i don't know about you but it's so easy it's it's uh to praise god on the mountain right when things are running smooth it's all good but get ready you're in this world that season's fixing to change just like it changes from summer to fall from fall to winter and from winter to springtime amen just as those seasons change are the seasons of our life change but when everything's running smooth get ready he says because satan isn't going to let it run smooth very long amen not very long how many knows let's talk about another one let's talk about israel for a few minutes israel knew what it was like to be on the mountaintop to god on the mountain right when they left egypt it says they were rejoicing if you ever watch the movie they're rejoicing in their oh my they got all kinds of gold it says the bible says the egyptians came them silver and gold and jewels and packed them full of stuff they went with their pockets full of money man they they were ready wow i got a perch full of stuff my neighbor gave me everything they had huh why they were happy weren't they they were on top of the world praising god but you know paul told us in first corinthians there that there's a direction that israel went that you don't want to follow that they were examples of what you don't want to be murmurers complainers and idolaters and all these things how many knows he never said that about moses he never said it about abraham's unbelief in the new testament but yet paul said it about them why because they're all as jesus said they're dead they're lost amen so there they were on top of the mountain season of victory victory is mine victory is mine well what about when victory isn't yours you're down and defeated down on the bottom amen because see this life we were born in sin shaped iniquity coming to this world speaking lies we come in a horrible place it was in a bad place we were to begin with amen and god wants to take and make something good out of something bad amen life is like a rollercoaster right up and down huh and then sometimes you have to straight places i this just comes to me says all right i want to give everybody some rollercoaster advice you know cause i remember when i went on the first day for a rollercoaster one time and and they went up over the hill way too fast you know sure i was buckled in i was fine with that i'm buckled in but i guarantee you these wheels are coming off the track over this yo right they're gonna just go out over well i learned later you know they have them on bottom they've got them gripped on they're not going to fly out it's going to hold there you know but i guess when i went on the one i was afraid that's what scared me was what was it it's not going to come back on the tracks so don't worry you're not going to leave the tracks how many please that's the way it's with christ folks that's up and it's down but just stay buckled in god's got you here he's got a control of it he ain't gonna crash unfortunately i guess the news here in the last lately a couple of them people getting killed on them things and stuff stuff wears out it's man-made amen but it's so oh my how many knows that especially especially younger now we like to say that sisters and women they're very sensitive and emotional right don't we like to say that their emotions up and down and moan they're just supposed to be more emotional right well let me tell you something i mean those guys we don't we aren't so far behind amen if we don't have christ every one of us how many knows every one of us probably don't go all day hardly with having a change in moods how many has changes in moods as you get older it's it's worse i'm brother glad you can say amen here but as you get older the days get darker huh the days get darker it's worse life is worse when you get older i'm 60. i'm not looking forward to 70. not at all not one bit not even a little yeah yeah it becomes a job picking up your pen off the floor folks i can still do it pretty good right but i'll tell you what i was on that week bench a little bit today and oh my brother glenn's words right out to me you can't do that when you're 70. getting too close to ready aches and pains come to church on the way to church i went out there and worked out about three or four o'clock i got my message to make sure i'm awake to get get good you know get my blood pumping because i know what it's like on michael to go all day and be pumped just oh yeah i feel real good you get my age those days are few hey it's not a day it's a few minutes or like you know oh my but yes how many knows today it gets worse as you get older folks god forbid we ever have to go to a nursing home or have a care or something like that isn't that right i mean it gets real bad as you get real older folks this world is not so inviting anymore as time goes on how many knows that's why it is so important to have christ he made it that way god designed it that way why to let you know that you need an anchor you have to have something that anchors you so whether you're in the valley or whether you're on the mountain whether you're in a storm or wherever you are you really don't change it really don't change you aren't you glad for that because if you don't have the anchor of the holy ghost well i'll tell you what somebody asked you how you're doing i'm not doing so great i'm just doing terrible i'll tell you what i've had a back pain i've had a toe pain i've had a knee i don't want to hear about you all grapes that's just part of it yeah you walk around oh yeah i'm doing great praise be to god everybody's crying and learning to smile through your tears that's what you got to do right you got to learn to smile through your tears why because you know you have something more than just this life you got something more than just those high places those screaming hollers and praise be to gods or those deserts or those valleys those low places isn't that right paul he was prestigious he had probably a nice house i'll tell you what his trim the nicest table the nicest chairs he was the next gay ephesus he was prestige he was in good standings everybody said there goes saul that saul pharisee of the pharisee he called himself and there he was and after he got converted he went from jail to jail didn't have but a coat yet to ask for an extra coat amen his good times when him and paul and silas got thrown in the inner jail they were at midnight oh i tell you that it's so hard to be agreed no they begin to pray and sing songs they begin to worship god glory hallelujah huh remember brother bam talk about the church age book you know he says you know he did all that he did for us and what we have to do is to learn to conduct ourselves with joy amidst the trials that god allows to come our way amen to conduct ourselves with joy in the midst of the trials that god allows to come our way i've learned not to get too excited about stuff don't get so excited when an ambulance comes and you're next to death you want to take your uh maybe put something around your arm and you're bleeding and stuff and this out of the other they know what they need to do first don't panic keep you cool right and do what you know you need to do we'll get to that in a minute huh that's the way the christian is don't let your trials that come upon you suddenly and surprise you don't let them surprise you and don't let them throw you off guard amen my but look aren't you glad we don't have to have amen go with the way that we feel all the time like i said coming to church i was sleepy i was tired i said how can i preach feeling like this i feel terrible you know what i did i went to dairy queen i went to dairy queen and i got me a big old shake a vanilla shake like i need it huh i got me a crispy chicken sandwich that's right not a burger the the flamethrower was yesterday oh my god me some fries i ate all of that down i'll tell you what i felt pretty good i you know and i realized maybe i need food nightmare i thought came to my mind how can you eat before preaching aren't you supposed to be fat and i said i'm not fasting right now i need food right now paul said whatever you do do it with faith right but just to show you you know yeah yeah you're feeling this way and after you know in the next hour or so you feel a different way folks i'm telling you we'd be very every one of us would be hard to live with if we live by our emotions it would real a real be a ride i think in james it talks about you know a double man double-minded man is unstable in all his ways he's like a wave driven with the wind a person without the holy ghost in this world it's like having a sailboat with no rudder wherever the wind pushes them that's where they go amen but it's nice to have that runner but over in james it talks about we put bits and horses out and so forth they go we have a helm on the ship and so forth that's what every person in this world needs they need that running they need that guide to guide them through all of these things god allows it to come our way god allows you to dance in the spirit and run the owls and on monday you feel like crawling under the benches huh because something happens everything that can go ahead yeah go ahead finish it will go wrong i'll tell you what god opens up the valves of murphy's law and it hits us oh my it's about like taking a drink having a cup of coffee and it's all on your lap can't i even hold a cup of coffee anymore no it's just a trial sent your way amen how many loves the lord how many staff to have an anchor i'm so glad to have an anchor that whether i feel like i'm a christian or whether i feel like i'm saved that ain't got nothing to do with it i know the experience that god gave me i know that he has kept me and helped me through every storm through every wind amen so i know that just because you don't feel like this or this out of the other that's got nothing to do with it amen oh yeah first thing god allowed israel to do is go down to the red sea get in the trap and what did they do did they praise the lord but wasn't that was what god was looking for that's exactly what god was looking for he wanted them to dance on this side of the river they wanted miriam and them to dance on this attitude that's what god was looking for praise be to god god delivered us out of egypt and look here they have to come after us then poor people we're wondering what god's gonna do next let's just praise him you know what let me just be a presumptuous preacher tonight is that all right they wouldn't have got grounded in the red sea god had come down with the fire and destroyed them guys he'd been so happy with his children because they were doing what they wanted just like the three he was children of the fiery furnace right he was so happy with him he came and walked in there with them he didn't give up israel would have done that that's what god was looking for that's what god is looking for you and you you and me is in those valleys those deep valleys i mean not all of us is a joke right not all of us is a mo joe a uh israel or a joseph but this is one thing that we all are if you're sons and daughters of god hebrews 12 says that if you're his son you are going to be chastised every son that comes to him is chastened am i right god is going to chasten you he is going to rebuke you he is going to correct you and that right brother bam says one place he says when he was in his bottom when he was in his valley when he was in the bottom of the bottom of his valley you know right and god he was calling on god to at least spare sharon rose his baby god's buried i did this not my baby god put a black sheet on him the devil tried to tell him well he don't love you and brother in his mind was thinking devil's trying to tell him well if god's going to be that way am i right that's right and brother branham she says the lord give the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord and he makes a statement that every sun comes to that spot every sun comes to that all the way at the bottom of the valley to see what you're made out of so if it's peace if it's running smoothly what do you do keep your head up be ready here he comes amen that's right every son of god must be chastened must be tried paul certainly was what kind of a man was paul he had been beaten how many remembers all the things that he said there in corinthians about he was shipwrecked he was left for dead thrice was not beaten with rods he had a rough life he had a hard life life was certainly a nightmare for him but it didn't matter he could go through the nightmare as long as god is in it how many knows we can go through this nightmare as long as we have god that god that is what god wants he wants us to have an anchor of our soul not be tossed by every valley by every mountain i'm still going to have my mountaintop experience i'm still going to shout scream hopefully get happy enough to dance in the spirit huh sure i'm still going to have my low times when i'm so sad i don't know how to get any sadder but it don't matter whichever it is i'm still going to worship and praise god amen paul said this is what paul said i speak in respect of need or of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to complain therewith to be content my contentment i know both how to be a based can you imagine when he was left for dead bleeding they thought he was dead we killed the guy he wasn't quite dead yet shipwrecked wasn't he didn't he have ship how many times did he have shipwrecked two or three times maybe he was shipwrecked how can you miss i would have a little complex after a while hey i ain't getting on this boat everybody goes down one wasn't too happy with it god allowed it right paul had it rough and in his inauguration in paul's inauguration when god called him he said that god showed him all the things that he must suffer he says he's you buddy i'm here to tell you i'm introducing you buddy you're going to have a hard life you're going to suffer a lot of things for the kingdom of god's sake but he had something in here he had joy and peace and an anchor it didn't matter if he did die am i right he says i'm more than willing to go up to jerusalem and be killed for i have a desire to be with present with the lord but it's needful for me to hear to stay with you but my desire is to be with him because he knew where he stood he had an anchor in his soul i trust everybody here has that anchor in your soul because if you don't you're in for the ride of your life i mean it's all them tattoos all that they're all just being woof any women to come i'm gonna load ring it i'm gonna put an earring i'm gonna put this big old thing hmm i know who is in the neighborhood i shouldn't say too much but there was one guy that was talking about going into the ministry and he had one of these african where they take the ears put a big big o in it big big old circle you know they make it bigger and bigger i'm like dear lord what have we got to somebody want to go into ministry looking like an african heathen huh i was i was me and my wife going down the road you know you can't go to dairy crew without them having a bull bull ring in their nose anymore if you took a picture of the african heathens and put some of these tattooed people up these over here these american heathers look worse than the africans probably and it just kind of hit us it kind of hit me and my wife how that even brother bam said that civilization the pinnacle always spins back so what he said think about that he said that the 50s and 60s he says it'll go right back to hedonism look at what his prophecy is exactly right swinging back now there are a bunch of heathens out there with a bunch of paint all over their face and nose and arms painting themselves up just like heathens nose rings earrings all these other things tossed with the wind because they have no anger their emotions feelings no wonder our politics our politicians can't get along they got if you ain't got god you can't get along with nobody you can't get along with your dog you'll kick him when he's just being a dog and wanting the nibble huh no wonder the world's in the state it is because they don't have god they don't have christ they haven't got the holy ghost how many is glad for the holy ghost folks i don't know about you but i don't i want the holy ghost more than anything else in the world in my life to help me live out this treacherous journey we are fixing to go through the briar patch folks a long stretch of briar patch horrible things the haunted house yeah we're living in a haunted house it's spooky it's freaky looking out there folks isn't it bad it really is my oh and that's mild it's worse than that amen amen but that's where i want to be how about you brother ben talked about how to why is it so hard for people to keep the victory he talked about a person that has it mentally and a person that has it down here he said they can have the same pastor come to the same church one is always up one down and in and out and so forth huh and the other one they always seem fed up let me kind of read the way he says did you ever meet a person that's in there that's anchored they've tasted and they're living on this manner why you can meet them on monday they'll be nice as can be but sometimes on tuesday boy you don't know what has been hidden no you don't put it that way monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday cloudy day bright day gloomy day you can meet him in the time when things are going right wrong he's always sweet how many knows we could use some more of that i got to learn i got to work on it i'm a guy and i'm a a little a little bit rough huh i was doing something the other day today as a matter of fact and it demanded being a little bit delicate you know and i don't know about you but these fingers are not delicate i said i could do i could be delicate i tell myself that brother brian all this plastic stuff why can't they make it out of steel you just bend it a little bit too far and it snaps right off you're like oh my come on americans we can build it better than this but sweet gentle huh meet a person that's always sweet always full of love never talk or do anything wrong he's living under the glory of god he never gets hungry he doesn't have to go to church to get built up he's just always full of god you know how we want to be no matter whether you're up there whether you're down there you're still hold steady hold steady be the same person how many want to be that way well some of you i know about you i believe all of us want to be that way because we all know that when the trial comes when some of these things come we don't always pass the test that right i remember when i first got married and i don't know what it was my wife was doing something just to be a little whatever i says you can't make me mad you can't make me mad guess what she made me mad don't tell nobody that don't tell your wife i shouldn't tell her it's not fair but she'll be right i'll read the newspaper and she says did you ever notice how that works jump on it oh my just stuff like that but anyway you might not think that you might not pass the trial but you better be careful isn't that right all of us i mean god knows how much pressure to turn up on you how much pressure to give you amen to see you whether you're really what you ought to be god bless you let's stand tonight musician you'll come pull up that song micah would you life is like a mountain railroad would you help bleed that brother david we would i like that song let's sing that [Music]
