[Music] how many is happy amen god bless you may be seated for just a little bit if you lie i'm gonna take just a moment and uh i'm gonna go sing if it's all right and have maybe a song for the lord and then get right into the preaching of the word of the lord i just want to say what a privilege it is to be here with you again always count the supreme elkton and uh we uh just know that the coming of the lord is drawing nigh and we're getting a little bit closer a little bit closer as the days go on and god knowing that we would be in a position as the elect of god that we would need not only the strength of a message like we've got today but the outpouring of the holy ghost that we've received as god's people and uh yes sir all right hold that thought for just a moment technical difference i thought i had it on no yes no now you can hear it all right praise the lord i'm a doctor y'all i know how to turn a microphone on you know [Laughter] anyways god knowing we would need the strength of not only a great message to get us through this time but the lord knew what kind of outpouring of the holy ghost we would need in this last day that's why brother bremen taught us that it's not the what we would say it's not the chemistry of the blood of jesus christ for us today that washes of our sin 2000 years ago but it is the literal life of jesus christ you think about that you think yourself what does that mean exactly well it's very simple what it really means is it means that nothing that we believe is an unknown whatever we need to get ourselves ready for the rapture has been laid right out there before us we're not waiting on anything folks people got this idea in their mind that some great big thing is going to happen this way or that way what they're talking about when they think of revival and great revelations and those type of things what they're thinking about tribulation people because the great next revival that's going to take place publicly will be with moses and elijah and that'll go straight to the 144 000 and israel will receive those two prophets and honey she's going to have a revival like you've never seen before imagine 144 000 i'm get the holy ghost at one time oh god just let me look over the banister and just watch that thing happen you talk about church and uh when they find out where they are they ain't gonna sit around like much as messes people do you know kind of looking around the corners of the building they're gonna be thrilled they're gonna be excited and they're gonna be drunk on the holy ghost even a little bit it wouldn't hurt any of us to get there tonight don't you think so amen i i i love worship and i love worshiping the lord and remember all of these things are the children's bread you believe that hallelujah and i'll say this last thing just as uh just passing a comment you know i i think one reason folks do sit around and look at the corners of the building they've just really lost their excitement you know for the things of god brother brahm talked about it becoming common to us and i i pray all the time you know being a preacher and i'm on the road you know sometimes 60 000 miles a year 52 weekends a year i mean i've wore out four or five cars in the last 20 years traveling you know and and uh you know it's um uh a lot of times the same remarks same sermon same bible same jesus same message and all of that and to be he's get common after a while repeating the kind of phrases telling 100 people they're going to get the holy ghost and then telling 100 churches on top of that to get the holy ghost and after a while those phrases just become almost repetitious but i pray all the time but the day that my key that my heart i say god just let it continue to be fresh don't i don't want it to just start running into that thing where it just becomes words to us just keep it fresh in my heart that's what i really love and i i love it when the lord does it that way and i believe he does it that way because once it's something you're passionate about so you've got to be passionate about i said the violent he said we'll take uh the kingdom of god i'll just put it the king james way he said the kingdom of god suffereth violence and the violent passionate take it by force those people around this truth i'm afraid that are just casually a part of it they just casually go to church i'm afraid they're going to find themselves in a very rough place one of these days and you think the economy is bad wait until that hour arrives amen and then the destructions and the things on top of that we don't want to wind up the tribulation period because we're just casual christians i want to be so aggressive that when i start to wake up in the morning the devil down in hell says everybody get ready here he comes again hallelujah don't you feel that way yeah i do too you know i saw something the other day i i thought was interesting the prophet of god talked about how california is going to go down right did you know and i didn't realize this too that i never thought of this the other day did you know that if california or los angeles specifically sinks into the ocean do you realize how much of the world's economy is tied to just that one thing right there alone if california goes off breaks off into the ocean if los angeles is what brother bram said repent los angeles not california but los angeles if los angeles has sunk all of the major businesses and international trades of the world on that coast out there it will literally send the world into an absolute complete economic failure altogether just that one action of los angeles going in now folks you people that say brother branham didn't know what he was talking about well he may not know he was talking about but he was a vessel to let god use him to tell us what the truth of it was and you imagine what kind of impact corona had upon the world economy just think when all of their big banks and businesses and their men and all them are sitting about 60 000 leagues under that it'll put him in bad shape oh god let my heart be ready for the hour of the coming of the lord amen well anyways just nice to talk to i love you so much and uh thank you for coming to church tonight you probably had a feeling it might be me and you showed up anyways appreciate that amen but uh uh we we we certainly love the lord and uh we'll sing a little bit we're gonna get right into the preach of the word of the lord did you come hungry for god's word tonight oh my fill my cup lord i lift it up lord can you say amen to that praise the lord and i know i've sang this one little song here before but i just been it's been on my mind and i think maybe i'll just go ahead and sing it again one day at a time says the song i'm only human i'm just a man [Music] help me believe in what i can be and all that i am [Music] show me the stairway [Music] oh i have to climb lord for my sake teach me to take one day at a time one day after time sweet jesus that's all i'm asking of you give me the strength to do every day what i have to do [Music] yesterday's gone [Applause] and tomorrow may never be mine lord for my sake show me the way one day at a time [Laughter] do you remember [Music] when you walked on then jesus you know if you're looking below it's worse now than then all the pushing and shoving that's crowding my mind lord for night teach me to take one day [Music] of you give me the strength to do every day what i have to do [Music] yesterday's gone sweet jesus and tomorrow may never be mine [Music] lord for my sake teach me to take one day at a time lord for my cake teach me to take one day at a time can you say amen to that amen exactly right his holy name praise his holy name i want to sing old song tonight and uh it's been so long since i've done this one and i'm sure you'll remember it once i start singing it but i love this old hymn and uh but other conditions and the things of what we've seen in this day and time i thought this little hymn is quite appropriate for where we're living it says uh some glorious morning sorrow will cease some glorious morning all will be peace [Music] heartaches all and dead school days [Music] jesus will come [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] victory break through the blues [Music] some golden day break for me for you i like this sad hearts will gladden all shall be bright [Music] goodbye forever to earth [Music] change in a moment like him to [Music] jesus i'll see [Music] jesus will come [Music] [Music] [Music] victory break through the balloon [Music] some golden day break for me and for you [Music] what hallelujah meeting there in the skies no tears no crying shout in our eyes love wants you united [Music] [Applause] that morning will be sang some golden day break jesus will come stan we should get your bible some golden day break battles all [Music] break through the blue some golden day break for me and for you sing it again with your hands raised some gold and daybreak saying jesus oh that sounds beautiful receive our praise father son gold and they break all your heart now battles all one think about it friends heal shout the victory he'll break through the blue some golden day break for me for you he'll shout the victory break through the blue [Music] for me for praise the lord praise his holy name amen and amen and amen let's turn in our bibles if you would like to go to the old testament tonight i'd like to invite you to the book of psalms and we're going to look just a little bit more on a subject that i i preached to you some time ago on divine healing and just feeling led to the lord just to dig back into that tonight and uh you may not remember when i preached it or what i said i promise i won't leave you leave you behind but i just felt led to kindly revisit some things that i didn't get to some time ago psalm 103 and then i want to look at one two and three verses one two and three psalm 103 one a psalm of david bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me blesses holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases now i want you to notice how that iniquity and jesus is directly connected together so when you look at someone saying well sickness yes sickness is there it's present it happens but sickness doesn't just occur because it's sickness alone sickness is the result of sin maybe not your sin but maybe someone sins back in the generations before you maybe the reason why that certain things are with you today is not really something you're conscious of it's something that happened because of sin somewhere in your family line listen to this i want to uh bring you out of the he cares that you care message now brother said we believe that doctors help people what's a dangerous quote to read in the time of this vaccination debate ain't it thankfully i'm brave enough to read brother branham i think he knew more than i did anyway i believe that god heals my medicine god heals by surgery god heals by understanding god heals by love to show a little love goes a long way that someone be upset and just show them you care for them see god heals by love god heals by prayer god heals by miracles god heals by his word god heals whatever the source is god heals by it it's god that heals for he said i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases let's pray for the word father we thank you this evening lord for the privilege of being able to open up the bible and to be able to speak the word and the dictates of our heart lord we are so grateful that as we are assembled together in this place not only did you promise to be here where two and three are gathered but lord jesus you by your grace and mercy are going to take thy word tonight and speak to each one of us we are thankful tonight lord we open our hearts and turn our cup up waiting upon your reigns to come into our lives may you speak to us now and edify us by the preaching of the word anoint me lord jesus that i might be able to get out of the way that you can use me and anoint their hearts that they might be able to receive take all the business of the day away from us lord and strengthen our bodies and our minds and our spirits that we might receive from your table tonight as we committed to you in the name of the lord jesus christ and all the saints said amen you may be seated mate god bless you so very good now i don't want to just uh i don't want to waste any time on some of these subjects i want to jump right quickly as i can into the subject that i was hoping to bring some time ago and y'all are such good pullers that you know i don't even have to read these notes sometimes but sometimes when things are left laying there i say well i really wish i could have got into that you know as a preacher sometimes you just wait on the lord wait on the lord wait on the lord and then sometimes he gives you a green light to revisit a couple things and i thought tonight i just felt like i saw the light changed green and and i want to start from where we read now and i want to jump into the new testament and have you got your book there first john chapter 3 and i want to look at verse 10. and then i want to read three verses inclusive 10 11 and 12 by god's grace to to lay a little bit of some of these thoughts i want to preach on uh into you tonight now while you're turning there i want you to listen to this statement brother brahman says uh christ couldn't help being what he was he was a son of god and he said see what i mean now he said if you were intended you see the word of god if you were intended you see the word of god you believe it because why he said have you ever heard of a strain in a family a son will kind of impersonate his father or the mother grandmother grandfather that strain in the family you said you've heard of it he said it's the same thing from predestination you're supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way you did you're subject to the fall but being that you're predestinated you hear the word of god and it brings you right back where you were predestinated amen never saw that before he said if you hear brother ben i'm on that tape he goes never saw that before fresh right out of the platform right on him now i i also want to read now this and john to kind of uh dovetail all this together notice he said in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother for this is the message you know i i we hear that term thrown around thrown around thrown around thrown around message message message message i'm not making fun this is what brother branham called his message he said i have a message in the last day but when people use that term the message i wish they'd put this in with their terminology he said this is the message that you've heard from the beginning that we should love one another and all you christian people out there said amen right not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous now i want to stop for a moment and and just hold your place there in john we're going to revisit it in just a second and i want to talk to you just a minute about where my mind is at on this subject okay first of all when we talk about sickness when we talk about what sickness is we know that sickness in jefferson summarize at all what it really is sickness is an invader of the body it is an invader of someone's cells an invader is someone's perhaps your bloodstream uh whatever part of your body that that germ gets into it's an invader that goes into your body illegally and it gets in there contrary to the nature of the human system and the natural process of your system and it invades with the purpose and the intent of destroying now we know what the bible tells us in the book of james when he tells us to humble ourself before the mighty hand of god that he might exalt you or peter set apart me but he goes on to say after we are humbled before the lord he said remember your adversary the devil goes around walking like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour see satan from the very beginning has been from his change from being lucifer the great angel down to satan or this demon this head demon of all of these groupings of angels that fell and became demons lucifer's whole purpose in becoming what he became was to become god to be worshiped and to do all those things that he spoke about in the book of isaiah but also don't forget in order for him to be worshipped and to be like the most high he was going to have to invade another spot in the kingdoms of heaven he said i will go to the north and amen he said i will become like god set up my kingdom and so forth like that and i i was laughing i told somebody other day they said uh you know how in the world do you know that god's a southerner i said because the devil wanted the north evidently god must have been in the south amen you can think on that and say amen a little bit later now when we look at the way that satan organized his affairs and when he put it all together and he placed that in there remember that the devil was not trying to take uh creative power because he had none and start a brand new kingdom a brand new work apart from god but his whole purpose was to invade amen god's creation and god's kingdom and god's way of doing things and to invade that and corrupt it and pollute it same thing exactly takes place and every time you see a church split or you see marriages split or home split somewhere there has been an invader that got into the sanctity and the synchrony of that home and split them apart just absolutely drove a wedge and next thing you know husband and wife are fussing and fighting there's no agreement you don't love me anymore i don't love you anymore all this kind of stuff church is the same people the same with friends on and on why because satan who is an invader decided to make himself a wedge in between amen the angels of the lord and almighty god in the beginning he preached to those angels a beautiful kingdom gospel the prophet said and as a result of preaching that message he was able to draw a thousands of these angels away from the presence of the lord and they become demons as we know them today then what did satan do as the prophet told us sin did not start on the earth but sin started in heaven he'd after he invades heaven and separates and conquers in heaven then he goes right to the earth and there's nowhere for him to go nowhere for him to work in until he was able to invade the serpent and as the serpent stood there created an image of a man he was close enough to look like a man had the same type of blood that a man would have same type of cells and chromosomes and genetic structure and all of that and then standing there having a place for a soul but had no soul the devil somehow was able to figure out i can invade that body now we don't know exactly how he got there there's many silent things in the scripture that don't tell us the whereabouts and the timelines and how that happened but all we know is that when satan invaded the serpent moses by vision went all the way back and christ pinpointed him right to the moment that satan began to invade the entire human race now let's be honest about it he could have gotten the serpent time and time again could have used the serpent maybe made test runs so to speak of how he could influence that beast but yet at the same time none of that had any significance at all until eve stopped to listen to him one day when the devil invaded that serpent's mouth and he said yea hath god said we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but the fruit that's in the midst don't touch it or eat it unless you die and then now satan is going to not only invade the serpent but now he invades eve brother brennan tells us that he invaded her mind before he ever got to her body before he ever got to her spirit before her soul became polluted before the lord satan had already invaded the womb of her mind am i preaching that past you listen that slow which one amen now remember the holy spirit then is also an invader he wants to come into the human heart and he wants to invade our lives and he wants to separate us from the wages of sin and from the behaviors of sin and from the things that amen would cause us to wind up in the regions of the lost the lord jesus not only invaded my heart but he invaded hell he invaded everything there is to invade that's why they hated him so bad when he showed up in human flesh he invaded all of their synagogues he invaded all of their doctrines he didn't leave them one bit of room to be able to set that and say well we have this jesus said do you all right and then he would lay the scripture on just bust the thing all to pieces the devil absolutely despises being upped in his own game but we love it thank god he does now i want you to think now about the things that we read remember he said the lord has benefits to divine healing to his mercy and so forth and he said but iniquity shall be forgiven at the same moment your body is healed now do you realize that even james said that if you'll call for the elders of the church he said the prayer of faith shall save the sick but listen and if there be any sins they shall be forgiven that's not the baptism of the holy ghost but that is the blood of jesus christ washing away past sin or past iniquity in a person's life whatever led them to the spot to where that they were able to take on this sickness being invaded by the sickness the holy ghost goes in there and just wipes that thing clean all the way back this is why jesus said now go and sin no more or a greater thing will come upon you later and friend it's always important to remember that if the lord does any kind of supernatural act in our life of any kind of any shape form or fashion we should purpose in our heart from that moment on to dedicate every single day and minute thereafter to nothing but his service and to surrender ourselves completely to the lord jesus christ amen you believe that say amen now notice again that if he is the healer that also forgives the iniquity if iniquity and the sickness come together amen then iniquity must be a special key to understanding how sickness operates now what does iniquity do for you and i all right let's stop for a moment and let's think about what that means brother branham and the bible clearly make it just a plain picture for all of us that when someone has iniquity iniquity is when you know to do something but you fail to do it now brother if you're ignorant of it sister if you're ignorant of it that might be one thing but when someone knows what is right and what is wrong and they step over that to do their own thing them it becomes iniquity and remember it was not the sins of the amorites that god was waiting to fill the cup it was the iniquity of the amorites you see people get this in their mind that the lord is not just and that he doesn't overlook things and show leniency to people when they're ignorant he does i guarantee you that many of the people walk in the face of this earth that you and i would take a message book and throw at them from a distance and say you're going to hell don't you know how to do anything different that cigar and that dip and those clothes and that hair and on and on and on but rather god cannot hold them accountable for what they don't know he cannot judge that we would look at some guy walking around tattoos all over his body big gauges in his ear a man smoking on the end of a cigarette riding a motorcycle acting like a tough guy and we had cussing out of both sides of his mouth and we would look at that fella and we would say man those cigarettes gonna send you to hell man all of that is gonna send you to hell no it's not the thing that will send him to hell is the fact that once he realizes he is a sinner once he rejects the propitiation that can forgive him of his sins that is what sends him to hell cigarettes don't send you to hell whiskey and all that don't send you to hell but it is knowing that you need to be saved and rejecting that that's the thing that sends you to hell quicker than all the alcohol and the pubs and all of the honky tonks in the world there's not enough of that that can send a man to hell all of that is done because he knows he's a sinner and he refuses to get right remember folks when people commit adultery and they lie and they cheat and they steal them they do all kinds of manners of evil they're not doing them things because they're a christian that's just doing some bad things doing little you know little little badnesses they're doing them things because in their heart they're still a sinner you realize one reason that a lot of people operate the way they do in churches and act the way they do in churches they saved i'm not talking about holy ghost i'm not saved one of the first things that you should dedicate your heart to doing is just simply be saved go to the lord and say i'm a sinner i need salvation because i'll beg to tell you right now brother i'll argue any day of the week that many of our people will talk holy ghost holy ghost revelation revelation they've never been saved they said right on these pews like i did as a boy raised up hearing about the prophet raised up seeing the pillar of fire raised up seeing the church age pictures and all of the paraphernalia that goes with this message but nobody seems to care enough about our young people or individuals in the church for that matter to say hey have you ever been saved have you ever recognized sitting here in the house of god that you are a sinner and you have a savior if you want him and his name is jesus christ if we could ever come to that spot and get started on the right foundation we're on our road to true healing in our lives we have an expression an idiom so to speak that we use when we call it don't put the cart before the horse if we ever expect to have the quality of life that god wants us to have and that quality of life isn't this scientific version the psychological version where every day you live you're going to be smiling because i got news for you brother life has made up like that and some of our young boys and girls sitting here you're gonna get married one of these days god willing and don't let hollywood teach you that marriage is all about one ear to another it ain't there many times you feel like killing them it's okay to say man we're in the house of god don't lie don't lie there are many times you you my mom used to say about me it was a boy it's a wild when i was a little boy she said there's been many times i've contemplated murder for that child right marriage is made up of all kinds of strains and difficulties and pressures it's not an easy thing and many times we'll sit back and we might say to ourselves ah christianity ought to be a bowl of cherries ought to be happy it is all of that but it's a fight to get there you have to surrender you have to struggle you have to work to get to that spot and often it is created this image is created in our minds now once you start serving the lord all your problems go away well let's just be very plain very honest you're living in a world that is as anti-god and anti-christ as it could possibly get now sister i realize you want to look pretty i realize i'm not bashing our sisters to that when i say this i realize you want to do little things that makes you look pretty and all that you should look pretty if our boys get that spirit on my mom be sure to lay my hands on them suddenly it's all right if you want to wear a pretty dress or curl your hair or if you want to uh you know i mean people almost pass out if they see a girl with a heel on them we've become so legalistic oh my god she's got heels yeah on the bottom of her feet too and they act like oh they can't do this and that listen but you take our sisters with one little necklace around their neck or one little ring on their finger compel compare them women to the modern day woman walking the street today you got day and night just as clean as it can be the fact of the matter is when people are so legalistic about everything most of the time when you hear preachers carrying on like that about women he got a problem with them women he don't want to see him pretty amen it's okay you don't have to say it man i'll say it for you amen right and he's scared to let people have liberty because he's got a problem himself right many of the preachers that are so legalistic they got that dominating thing on them that the people have to do it exactly like they say so are we trying to form the people in the image of the preacher then or in the image of jesus christ look at the questions they asked brother ram while we're here let's just stay on in a minute but is it okay for a woman to wear a necklace or a pen he said now sister i have no scripture on that so why is it everybody else does brother brown didn't have no bible but they do it's like return ministry in the tent vision he said i can't interpret it but we've got 4 4 800 people this message for the last 60 years that's had a better interpretation than the man who had the vision himself preached to me right the thing i'm trying to show you is that iniquity develops in the heart of the people whenever we begin to see the word of god not some man's idea a person is not sinning then my mom was telling about it the other night whenever she said we were an apostolic we were told you women you stay away from your husband don't you hold his hand don't you kiss him don't you be romantic with him in any way he's a sinner thank god brother come along and said don't you women do that you'll drive him from the presence of the lord and yet the attitude becomes what is iniquity iniquity is not the idea that you've got formed in your head about what spiritual looks like spiritual is not based on your idea well hallelujah i meant to get here by the way so i'm here now i'm taking a little bit of a road around to say a couple things but just bear with me a moment you know myself personally for years i wouldn't wear a beard i'm a preacher preachers don't wear beards until one day i got to looking in the mirror and i thought to myself why why do i care what people think about something silly like that where's the quote oh if jesus was here with a business suit on he'd have a three-piece business suit on and he'd be clean-shaven yeah i know that's what he said but many of you men unless you are willing to wear a three-piece suit every day of your life be quiet that's not iniquity ourselves oh it's iniquity glory to god as i've told you this when i was in a certain place in canada a fella said to this one sister because she had red on that sign of adultery and some of them people snuck around when they wasn't what he wasn't looking and they said brother ben is it is it really what do you think about that i said now listen this guy's my friend he's my brother and i'm not saying this to put him down but him and i've had these very conversations ourselves but i've told him just like this he needs to get his nose out of the scarlet letter and get it in the bible where it belongs there's nothing in this message that teaches such things like that you know a lot of that is men that's got problems you might as well preach to him it's coming anyways right they're trying to cover up their own sinful ways himself making our women look like a bunch of antiques uh-huh praise the lord the lady told my wife here not about seven years ago you are a married woman put your hair on top of your head i said i beg your pardon i'm her lord and i like it down and of course sister samantha being the good sport she is she went along with it until we got home and she said i'll do with my hair what i want i said not as long as i'm sucking wind sister you're mine and the bible said your body mine your eyes are mine and your hair is mine that's where you handle that one quote the word but the point being is all of these things that sum up what the church has called iniquity for years they're not a special bible for this stuff much less the message of the hour we realize that brother ram is preaching holiness to people he is basing it on a godly standard but people have taken that thing and run 47 ways to sunday instead of really preaching to people where iniquity genuinely lies i would rather take a person walk in this back door and sit down this pew and not know nothing about nothing but have a pure heart before god that they can be corrected and dealt with and worked on and the holy ghost can touch them and teach them something then some of these stubborn legalists around this message that think if you chew more than one pack of gum in a year's life that you somehow sin before the lord iniquity is not a man's idea iniquity is when now let's see close iniquity is when god god has revealed to you what is sin from his word if you're not careful you'll get caught up in a lot of people's opinions and opinions are like elbows everybody got one and what you can do with your little opinion you can take it and you can place it next to the next guy's opinion and then put that opinion next to the next one and take them pick them up gather them up in a bag and throw them in the trash can because they don't mean anything trying to get saved hey brother look if god wants to save you and fill you with the holy ghost sitting in that seat right there me dragging you to an altar to pray through isn't going to uh uh a bit of good if god wants to do it another way that's why we need to be sensitive to the holy spirit come on preach to me now operate by a program we're not denominational people that's the whole reason we follow this message is organizations of the devil notice y'all everybody okay anybody need to break to take a blood pressure pill or get some insulin or we good all right now i want you to think about how this bleeds into what john said john and i'm going to sum it up this way john is essentially saying that what manifests the child of the devil is his feeling and his attitude toward his brother if a man is filled with the love of god there's no way he can hate another saint now i'm just going to say saying specifically there's no way he can hate his brother no way that doesn't mean you won't get angry doesn't mean you won't get crossed won't feel anger you won't be upset maybe even a little bit a bit of bitterness or fight some kind of a hard feeling but there's no way that a man could absorb hate into his heart if i'm full of the love of god how can i hate you there's no way in the world so notice john is identifying that the sickness of the sinner is not necessarily the behavior but what is dwelling in them so if love is dwelling in men god is love and hate is dwelling in another then the devil is hate so the real issue of healing in our soul has more to do with what dwells here than what this does now some of y'all folks probably won't think brother ben preaches this way so often he probably don't believe in holiness i do but i also i'm not going to spend a lot of time beating people over the head and i mean if i stop and ask you how many years you've been in this message 30 years 40 years 20 years 15 years some of you kids in here raised in this message you got seniority already you don't even know nothing married yet i mean why in the world do we have to spend all of our time trying to beat away you mean to tell me that girl she wore a ribbon in her hair what that sinner and half the church got hate in their heart bitter angry mean oh i hit a land mine good i like land mines like when my daddy blows them up the attitude of a child of god when it comes to iniquity is not about behavior on the outside folks this is the reason many of us look at our walk with god and we judge ourselves not to be a christian and not to be spiritual because we judge ourself by behaviors out here which is not what we really are at our core paul said it himself the things i want to do i don't the things i want that i don't want to do that's what i'm doing those are paul jumped back here and said i need to get the holy ghost i need an older call get your music loud and fast so i can get saved paul said i found the law when i'm trying to do good evil sitting right there preach to me the core of who we are if i am a child of god then my behavior will reflect what i am my neighbor and even if i do things that isn't as out of spiritual as highly godly if i've really got the holy ghost here he'll make this come in line eventually sure he will jesus said when he comes he reproved the world of witness that's what he did when he entered into this world he reproved it awakened wickedness we come from the type of churches when i was a kid that didn't teach too much holiness that way and so when i was a boy you know i run around shorts for a number of times i never will forget whenever i first received the holy ghost i stood up one day to put on my shorts go to school i was in high school when i got the holy ghost i was on my way with my shorts the whole day i felt like i had assaulted somebody or stole from them or done something oh they didn't teach you know their attitude back then ah let that boy wear them so i ain't no big deal but the holy ghost thought different about me now you do what you want but as a preacher the holy ghost told me not to do it and i wasn't permitted to do it therefore i had a nice little bonfire when my mother come in that evening why did i do that because i read it in a book no because the holy ghost led me don't do that when a person at their core is jesus jesus will lead him and guide them hallelujah into every spot of truth in every place this is why preachers are called of god to make sense of the word they're called of god to show the people what the truth is but they are not called of god to be your holy ghost and your discerner now listen folks i'm going to say something a little strong but don't let it check you a preacher has no business meddling in your affairs before the lord if you pray a certain way or you think a certain way or you do a certain way it's none of my business how you do what you do don't pass out now hang on breathe and through the nose out through the mouth not my job to educate you on how to live you want to learn that go to school somewhere find you a clinic talk to a doctor psychologist it's my job as a minister to show you how to yield yourself to the holy ghost who will show you how to do those things that's why some some sister may say you know i can't wear a necklace like that that thing gets a hold of me when it does next i want to have rings on every finger and dude it up and load it up fine the holy ghost leads you to do it that's fine but don't make that your plum line for everybody else unless it's just that right sin we know the commitment adulterer is wrong we know that you know those kind of things are wrong we know that being a thief is wrong you know and some people are bold enough for this message to say well i could steal and do this that the other doesn't bother me you know that may bother you but i do what i want to do we're talking about people that are making excuses because all along iniquity is hiding inside of their hearts a real child of god full of the holy ghost don't make an excuse for the wrong things nor do they make an excuse for the right ones they just simply yield and let the lord do the leading i can see why you wanted me here tonight praise the lord notice he said whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god i see that a man's got to do righteous all right explain that to me tell me what it looks like now if i go home with you tonight i can pull the book on you before we get done with the cart right and you can pull it on me you'll see enough out of me and enough out of you to where both of us will be starting to pray for one another to get saved come on righteousness righteous behavior is not the everyday constant action and never making a mistake and never messing up and never getting discouraged that's why our people are running out of here in droves because nobody offers folks hope how am i supposed to preach people into a rapture and not give them the everyday peace of mind to know that they wake up and they're in a bad mood god ain't gonna throw them in hell for it hello how are we gonna get ready for the resurrection how are we gonna prepare our families and our churches to get ready for the coming of the lord when we put so much fear on people so they can't even pray without acting like a catholic almost like the rubbing beads and every word has to be perfect and they've got to say brother to be spiritual what is it it's iniquity in the hearts of people they know they need to get right and they're just not yielding themselves to the lord and because they're not like adam they've got to make their own religion to appease their conscience so therefore if a man isn't going to get right with god a woman ain't going to get right with god and they still want to be religious this is what you get this is the mess you get they'll be so religious they can't even buy a chocolate bar on sunday preach brother ben but they will sit in the house of god service after service night after night day after day listen all kinds of hundreds of preachers listen every sermon could be preached and still never yield their heart to become a safe born-again christian living so perfect and so clean that you couldn't put a finger on their life and yet iniquity is there they're still sick they're still a sinner and they're still eat with sin disease eat up with it well i've put you on some tough places before but tonight's a dandy still love me everybody with me still i see a lot of white teeth out there i'm doing all right so far just don't start gnashing on me with them teeth all right i got new boots on i don't want you messing my boots up praise the lord watch again now neither he that loveth his brother for this is the message not his cain who is of that wicked one now watch how john describes this he doesn't go into the works and then go into where he was up he goes into where he was of and then he connects that to his works why was cain's work evil because of who he was iniquity was in his heart oh glory but why was abel's righteous because faith was in his heart praise be to god how do i know that i'm going to turn out all right and not be cast off into the lake of fire because in my heart is the faith the revelation of the son of god a personal revelation in me that god loves me that god has died for me and raised for me and it's gonna take me out of this whole satan scene one of these days my confidence of how i behave doesn't lay in my ability to do it it lays in his ability to give me the feeling the faith the confidence praise god with the david to get all that in feeling inside to give us everything we have need of to want it because let's face facts if god didn't do that for you you wouldn't want it come on don't you look at me that way oh brother ben i've been in this message all my life yes but if you're not converted you're still a sinner and you still have not got faith in your heart i don't care how righteous you live on the outside it's got to be on the inside press into the works out later people do the works because they think the works is what pleases god they quoted abraham my works sure but james said this remember what he said you say you've got faith and you've got works he said i'll show you my faith by my works not apart from it but faith is what produces genuine works he uses abraham y'all to give us the example of that did you ever stop to think who he was talking about this the guy that not only fell on his face and laughed at god when god first told him he's gonna be a daddy but then he lies two different times before his body changed and after his body change lies hello takes his son all the way up to the mountain and when he finally gets his works in line isaac said father here's the wood here's all these other things but where's the sacrifice do you know that abraham was so determined to please god that the lord had to send an angel of god in an express manner urgently because when abraham drew back that knife to kill that boy abraham meant to follow through and remember the angel of the lord stays his hand he sends the message from god down to abraham says now i know you love me and that's a strange thing to say he who called the friend of god it took that to show god that he loved him it's not that the lord didn't know that he loved him but he was god was seeing out of abraham's life the thing of love and your heart is now producing it on the outside brother that don't come right away then things don't happen overnight you've got to fight labor and struggle and die daily to get to the spot to where you can really express those things in christ might i remind you that when galatians 5 talks about the fruit of the spirit fruit in the tree don't show up on its first planet it shows up when it hits maturity and when it starts growing into a lively branch that's when fruit starts producing out of the life but my goodness how many people in this message want to put carp before horse you get saved today and in a month from now they expect you creating squirrels i'm just trying to figure out how to pray hello i've spent all these years just trying to learn how to live right and if anybody's still working on that [Applause] you're still fighting still struggling to keep your humanities checked sure but many times we hear these these inflated sermons from people in the message and listen these words how many times have you heard this the elect of god has nothing to do with the world the scary part about that is is this guy is going to be the one that defines to me what the world looks like even based on his ideas based on what he thinks so that way for some of you guys in here that like sports the second that you sit and watch a football game mr i'm going to tell you what the world is all about is going to condemn you and throw you in hell over a football game bang was lost by the way in case you didn't know it now you understand that the ideas that come from the platform this is why preaching must be on target with the word how are the people going to know what lays in their heart true iniquity if it's convoluted and confused with this part of a man's idea and this part of a tradition and this part of a family idea and then mix all that together with the word of god and then you've got the hard task of trying to sort it out and you don't even have a gift to preach try to give to deserve it how many times preachers are going to have to stand before that white throne of judgment and give an account they're being so sorry to the people where instead of making time and sitting down and learning how to rightly divide that word they just think well i don't like it therefore god don't like it hallelujah anyhow ain't gonna let some of these hard looks get me down and your heart and your mind you may think but we've got to be holy based upon god's holiness do you understand there are people in this message that believe that if a man wears a colored shirt he's singing so every one of you men sitting here tonight with anything else but white on your ass in some people's estimation and sister i'm not going to start with y'all because all y'all be in bad shape if i took the same measuring stick stipulated on you do you understand what i'm saying to you friends how do we know what iniquity is if nobody gives us a plain understanding of it how do i know i'm sitting before the lord if it's not plain to me what that means and what that looks like can i use a simple example i don't mean to just summarize a bible story but think of the woman that caught in adultery moses said get both of them and bring them before the people when this woman showed up she was by herself i would love to know god i would love to know who the other fellow was yeah could have been a local pastor as we would say i learned local evangelist or teacher or whoever could have been one of the degrees of the church or the trustees or the song leader or whoever started the david i'm putting me in there too so i'm not throwing it on just one all of it it could have been any kind of god remember the prophet of god said ananias and safar were chuck members the bible told us plainly that they were working with the disciples and they kept back some of the money that they should have contributed to the work of the lord they scheme together right there in the message a message church until peter caught them what'd you lie to the holy ghost for you see it wasn't the attitude that you made the lie it was the intention of their heart they intended on doing evil and that one evil would have led to a thousand more evils why iniquity was hiding in that heart and when jesus brings this woman up he lays right there and and this and writes himself something in the sand and these guys are throwing the word at him oh you could have heard them little message chickens pecking him to death the prophet said the problem said the prophet said and jesus just sit down and thought a little bit and just kind of you know how you do sitting somebody talking a restaurant you'll play with a a straw rapper a napkin or you'll feel around with your spoon before jesus kind of writes down in the sand looks around what you want to use without sin go ahead and get started and i always get this wrong but i think the bible said either the eldest to the least or the least of the elders they one by one just started kind of sidestepping like whoop we better get out of here now these are men that according to the to the uh new testament history times of jesus and all these other books you can read these are men that you couldn't put a finger on their life what was they condemned for why'd they feel under conviction hello iniquity iniquity was hiding in their heart they knew they had never fully surrendered to the lord they were just doing what the like the rest of us do i mean in terms of humanity we just follow along with the program and hope we don't wind up in hell whew i am preaching tonight smack dab in one line land mine after another i can feel it i know i'm rubbing you the wrong way good good it helps us to learn where we're wrong that friends are these legalistic attitudes we've got oh praise god you know i heard a guy say today a man wears a pair of sandals a man i thought evidently you ain't never heard the story about the ram tells about jesus with dirty feet taking the sandals off to get them washed such foolish behavior as that is only a cover for the real truth hiding inside their heart and that that is there is iniquity they've never repented of hey adultery piece of cake god can forgive it cigarette habits no problem the lord washes it away and doesn't stick a stick at it but unbelief that's the hardest animal for him to wrestle with and god's a hunter you see jesus is a hunter he is on the hunt for that old devil that's crawling around which is unbelief trying to get in the hearts of people remember what he said he said smoking drinking curse and then things aren't sin he said unbelief is the only real sin there is think about the type i'm using tonight cain did what he did not because of the action of it paul did the same thing that king did oh thank you lord never saw that one cain was justified i was just as guilty of the same thing that cain did he held the call of stephen when he stood there and watching people stone that man to death it wasn't the behavior it was what was laying on the inside of that heart hallelujah many people can do things wrong many people can behave like a sadder but it's what's inside your heart that counts oh thank you jesus this is why if i'm gonna be a real genuine christian believer okay if i'm really going to serve the lord from the depths of my heart the word is a discerner of the thought and the intention of your heart do you know why god don't quit fooling with us he sees our intention [Music] oh how beautiful thank you lord jesus he sees what we intend to do now what we're doing glory to god hallelujah it's not the i the idealist focus on the behavior and the dress and the hair and all i know what do you intend to be in your heart do you intend believer do you intend to be a christian then god sees that and works by your intention oh thank you jesus thank you jesus now you and they like me whoa hey kill a heart and yet at the very same time brother sister this is where many preachers in the message and the like will follow through oh see what kind of shoes you're wearing air jordans nike by my god nike is a greek goddess why are you a heathen you know how many people in this message are the most ridiculous idiotic foolish people ever walked the face to play all in the name of religion and they've never even been saved come on somebody preach to me tonight they've never received the holy ghost they've never been born again and yet they can tell you everything that displeases god when they don't even know the man i'm going to preach to you the truth i want to be able to hear from god like we are right here this very moment to be able to hear from god about what people need to hear not what i think that's why when i show up and pull pits around the world i don't walk up there in that platform and think okay i'm going to tell them this i'm going to tell them that i'm going to talk i said lord uh your microphone turn it on and go i learned something many years ago if i tell you how to live then the next thing you do when you mess up you're going to be trying to know how to get redeemed how to be reconciled so if i the guy that's telling you then you're going to need me to keep doing it there go fish for a man you feed him for a day teach him to fish he's for the rest of his life to me brother the whole real bottom line of all of this is what is the intent of a man's heart woman's heart what does god see don't forget when he saw i talked about that in questions answers about that little piano player sitting up there with a short dress hair and makeup on her face all of that would have been so displeasing to many people around the ranks of this message they would have said she nothing but a sinner and she don't belong on the platform brother ben said leave her alone she's a baby in christ and you know what the truth be told she probably had more holiness in her little finger than many i'm having their entire christian walk so called because when you're sin sincere and you're honest before god you may not always do it right but god honors you a whole lot more because of the intention of what you mean to do praise god can you imagine what it must be like for the lord jesus to look down on all these people that think that they can make themselves holy him knowing that's the whole reason he died guys you can't make yourself holy you can't your righteousness as filthy rags in the eyes of the lord jesus amen amen so by his holiness he come down and he makes something different in our heart he changes the intention and the attitude and the spirit of our heart that's how he gets us right [Laughter] praise god so my job is simple i keep pointing people in that direction until they get there and if they don't get there make it so hot they get there or else and then if they get there and then they start fooling around doing things today right burn them up right oh you all ain't harming any man is loud on that one but it's the same amen as the other one was if you're a believer and you're doing something ain't pleasing to the lord you better watch out cause god ain't gonna take it easy on you when he knows you his boy and you his girl he's a jealous god now he won't let you go down roads it's going to hurt you or destroy all of the plan he has for you in his life he will put every roadblock in the way smack your mouth if he's got to so to speak now watch this and say john 8 44. you have your father the devil the lust of your father you will do that word lust doesn't mean sexual now but that word lust is desire an illegal desire it is a desire that comes from a person to get somewhere with something that they ought not have think of this in terms of how he spoke about the lust of the eyes jesus had to overcome the lust of the eyes what did that mean that means that anything that jesus saw that he knew would be illegal to the call and the walk that god had placed before him he had to overcome that lust so many of them pharisees probably handed him a million and a half dollars for praying for somebody come on i'll tell y'all something i'm not one of these guys that i'm not one of these guys that cares about the money part of it i get nervous if i can't if i feel like i'm not gonna be able to make ends meet or bills or something's getting a little tight i get nervous that way as a leader as a father as a husband i always want to make sure we're on the straight track and spend a little bit too much eating out or too much amazon or some of these type of things you know and i'll pull the reins quick hey slow down but i know what the bible said trust the lord pay your tithes and your offers and god will always take care of you i've watched him do it for 20 years now so my financial freedom isn't based on my day-to-day behavior well glory to god i don't have a credit card whoa glory to god glory to glad for you the three quarters this church probably here probably does you may not tell me you would get into debt and here we go notice how blanketed it was pay your tithe offer do you ever start to think god don't need your money y'all think he's going to be a little bit late this month i'm paying the light bill for the sun dp l and uh these so whatever the power company is for you you all reckon that he's going to need a little help a bump maybe in the tithing this weekend so that the lord jesus jesus can get the all the grass planted for spring but y'all look at me so strange he owns a cattle on a thousand hills he don't need your money but you see when a man pays ties and offerings he's showing forth an intention and his intention is i'm going to be obedient to god simply because the lord asked me to do this you know you hear people i ain't giving that old preacher my tithes that's fine keep them they ain't really tithing anyways that way because god loves a cheerful giver not a stingy one well praise the lord i'll have you know right now glory to god ah whether tommy works a job he's got enough that ain't what god said god didn't say you judge based on what you see he said this is your church that's your pastor pay tithes pay offers now the point i'm trying to make to you is you can start getting into the debates of the wise the whats and the whos and the winds but at the very core of all this god said pam same thing with living right the lord tells me don't do this don't do that do this dude but the very the very bottom line of all of it is is it in my heart to do right yes or no if it is and i will do right eventually [Laughter] come on somebody down the road i may not get it today i may not get it a month from now but by the grace of god eventually i'll be able to do that thing that's laying in my heart think of how long it took david david cried to god my lord dwelleth in tents and look at this big fine castle i'm living in he cried after the lord for a long time and god came down said david you've got the right move the right objective i see your heart is right but i can't let you build it you've shed too much blood that thing laying in david's heart laid there and laid there and laid there and laid there and what eventually happened eventually the temple was built god determined upon the children of israel 70 years that's bible years now not 70 literal years as we know but 70 bible years here we are from the time daniel recorded that about 4 000 years down the road israel has been blinded and in sin for 2 000 years my question to you is how nervous y'all think god is right now about israel's end y'all reckon he's worried when trump took office uh-oh when biden got in uh oh no that's us i most certainly felt that way when biden got office but that's just my american speaking i will say though old uncle joe impressed me the other day he went over to poland which i've got students that i teach in poland all the time and he got over there and he had a slice of pizza one of the local shops and walked around shook hands and kissed babies i was proud of him you know what he let no big mouth putin over there no we ain't worried about you when you could peacock peacock i was i was proud of him because i thought at least he ain't acting like a coward uh-huh but the attitude becomes this well i'm a believer but no no no rewind go back a little bit i'm a believer stop mark chapter 16. anybody ever why you don't raise the dead anybody ever wonder why you're never laid hands on sick and they've recovered anybody please put your hand up anybody wonder why you never spoke with new tongues if you see a few hands going up does it trouble you you know why white troubles you for the same reason trouble with me you're reading too far what you should do is you should stop where it says he that believes if you're a believer just let god take care of the rest of that because that being a believer part is way more important than what are you raised dead or not come on i'm almost out of here i'm getting ready to parachute like jewel he that believeth and is baptized now we get to this this idea well glory to god if i'm bride if i'm a real believer i'm going to raise the dead just be concerned with being able to get your hands raised in church in the corners of your mouth raised up when everything's going wrong just be concerned with raising your cup up to the lord every time you come and let god do the rest of it if you're a believer it's up to him when and how and what you will perform and what you will do because listen to me if you never raise the dead if you never speak in new tongues if you never lay your hands on the sick and they recover that doesn't take away the fact that you are still a believer what we've done folks and i don't say everybody now i'm lumping this quite a bit tonight generalizing quite a bit don't misunderstand me i believe there's godly people godly men around the world has got this right but there's a greater far greater amount of these other type of sermons that we hear that discourage us every time you hear somebody speak about the third pull you don't know what to do with that how do you apply that to your daily life when's the next time you're going to be in sportsman hollow and need some squirrels to eat and got to create them the whole point of god showing us those things to brother brown wasn't so we've become a bunch of mimicry to show sons of god that when and daughters of god when they are in need i don't mean to leave you outside daughters of god too to show that when you are in need take no thought for what shall be given for in that hour the holy ghost will give it to you because when your life story is road and the third pool is expressed in your life it may come in a much different way you might just be looking at old broken tractor and you may need that old tractor to work and you may just speak to that thing in jesus name you start out and there she goes that's just as much third paul as amen get speaking the storms come on somebody but what we've done is we've placed our vindication upon what we do not what we are i am not a christian because of what i do i'm a christian because of who i am [Music] hallelujah and if i am a believer then godly things will express out of me holy things will express out of me holy behavior and supernatural works of god will express through me if i'm genuinely a holy ghost-filled man but not based on what i think will happen let me show how this works please i want you to express yourself in a moment if you're guilty of this let all the rest of us see just you stupid as i am okay it's raining you hate to rain or it's bothering you got some kind of problem how many of you come on i said i command you you look around to see if anybody's looking see he told you people in here so stupid as i am and somehow in our heart we have established that if god would let us stop the rain somehow that makes us spiritual wait a minute wait wait wait don't think listen what about that everyday grind that you live and you still serve god in spite of all of the disappointments and started all of the the down-hearted stuff and all of the rotten stuff and the mean stuff that happens in your life how you discourage your own self how you get discouraged with your life and your walk with god and yet you get up the next morning and go head long right back into that kind of life still calling on the name of jesus to help you live and make it another day what about that to me that's more powerful than stopping a rain how often do people get in this mode to where they think if they're spiritual they have to raise the dead listen and i got to quit time's gone john was the one that recorded in that there matthew was the one that recorded in that day he will come to me and say lord lord didn't we do and he called him workers of iniquity why did he call him a worker of inequity because that's what was in their heart just because they could tap into enough faith to do something supernatural did not make them a christian and it certainly didn't make them spiritual of course we would see that scripture we go amen but wait a minute you can't say one thing about a certain set of works unless you said about all of the works so be just you see people that live better than you come on admit it you do christians that live higher than you so you think because they look spiritual talk spiritual walk spiritual people walking around bible underneath their arm and they're speaking in these and vows and we go oh my that's a real christian that is a hollywood trumped up not donald trump a trumped-up version of christianity and there's nothing spiritual about it a brother friend of mine down in south carolina brother gary hall he was with brother branham in los angeles and i loved what he told me the other day he said you know brother ben he said a lot of people put brother brad in this high category he said i met brother branham in 19 and 16 62 i think it was and he said when i walked up to shake his hand he stunk because he'd been standing there preaching on the prayer line i had been going he'd been standing that hot california son he said i could spell smell perspiration on him a mile away he said he stood there and talked to me and spent one out of the side of his mouth the brother had some broken teeth and at that particular time his parcel was all messed up and he spit a little bit when he talked oh i don't see this kills our image of what we think is holy but that has not got one thing to do with being holy or holiness in general all that is is a thing we have created in our mind and what makes you holy is the fact that nothing is in here that displeases the lord don't get me wrong when it comes to your adoption your behavior will determine whether god can trust you sure but don't get your cart before that horse you make sure this right here is right with god and clean with god and all of that foolishness is out of here before you start trying to work out here remember what he said in the book of john if a man's heart don't condemn him but he said if his heart condemns him god is greater than that meaning the lord's got control over all these things that's why i just choose to surrender to him instead of trying to fix it praise god i should have never told you i was getting ready to close because it's getting late now you're wanting to get out of here you fooled me i'll hold you 20 more minutes just to be angry just be spiteful think about the condition of a man's heart when he comes before god david said forgive me of my sin my presumptuous and sacred unknown sins there are things that maybe god would hold against us that we don't even know is wrong and yet how am i supposed to keep track of all that if i woke up first thing in the morning i got me a pencil and a paper and i started trying to keep track of everything i thought was wrong and by the end of the day i had rolls and rolls of papers that's just full of lists of things that i've done wrong before the lord you know how much that concerns god he lets me go to sleep and brother john i get up the next morning and i go again i guess i'd have to start a new book but what we do is we make a library of our sins so when we go before the lord in prayer we're trying to do something spiritual or a man's preaching to us like this we've got all kinds of compendiums we've got all kinds of volumes and series and levels of reading we've got books thicker than encyclopedia war and peace and all of it put together of the things that we've done wrong that we feel like is displeasing to the lord but listen the prophet of god said when abraham's divine commentary was wrote god didn't include anything that abraham might have taken notes on glory he eliminated all of that you know they said in world war ii that one of the advantages that hitler took over the jewish people was he had a book burning you know what i think we need right here tonight i think we need to build up a fire the holy ghost and i think we need to take them old compendiums and encyclopedias glory to god and burn up in the fire the holy ghost and say god i'll no longer look at my own sins and my own what i want to read your notes on me rather than my own notes on myself because you know that one little thing that you do or those two little things you do or those six little things you do that you go through the day and you think i'm so stupid why can't i get myself straightened out you know god don't look at the way you do do you think you having an irritating little way about you some little irritating little thing that happens all the time and it's a besetting thing do you think that tiny little thing that you struggle with is such a big concern to god when he's got to keep the world turning keep the sun turned on he got to feed tens of millions of birds every day and you think that little attitude you got is a big deal to him words say man in case y'all forgot it no no no see it's a big deal to you that's because you keep notes on yourself but when abraham's divine commentary was wrote god never even referred to not one volume not one series or not one compendium that abraham wrote on himself when paul penned it down he said he grew strong staggered not i can point you right to the old testament a few different times he staggered would you like me to remind you of hagar would you like reminder of where ishmael come from a very time an evident time the prophet said oh you see you're being a smart like no that's the attitude people take about many of these things when they're so legalistic that it's got to be word by word much of this bible right here you're never going to understand it and if you get it figured out you're still wrong the real key to being able to live this word is to let god be his own interpreter for you for you not for everybody else and their brother and the dogs and the chickens for you but god interpret those things for you and here moses the prophet is telling abraham listen to sarah do you understand that sarah was out of the will of god suggesting that he go sleep with a concubine come on now ishmael was a wild man and the bondwoman cannot be heirs with the free and yet when paul writes it he grew strong giving god praise staggering not at the promise of god i'm done i don't think any of y'all can take any more anyway if i'm going to be right with god brother david i've got to come to this conclusion that whatever i'm doing before the lord it must be based upon my intent to do the right thing and if i've got the right intent if it's in my heart to do the right thing then god will help me work out all those details i can think of a thousand times i've looked back on my life in this last couple weeks i've been thinking back on things i didn't look at my life i can tell you right now there's been many times god's been lenient with me on certain little battles i fight he's giving me a space to work it out things are happening all the time i'm battling some certain little thing maybe it's a you know an attitude i know it's hard to tell that i would ever have an attitude but yeah i get them sometimes i get so aggravated people i like to slap them right in their teeth i like to hit them as hard as i can hit them say you are so ignorant what's the matter with you you know why i'm like that i love people i've committed my life 31 years this summer i've committed to the service of god's people and i've committed my entire life and you know when ain't nothing gets on my nerves worse than to tell them how to fix it watch them break it again so then i gotta go for the lord well are you there god it's me margaret ain't now y'all ever read that book right the looker always goes back before the lord are you there god it's me margaret the way i feel sometimes brother john are you there lord it's been again but i look back on i see how much leniency he could have whipped me he could have spanked me he could have dealt with me and said change your attitude or else but he let go on he let it go on he let more people aggravate me more people aggravate me more people thank you lord and i'm also aggravating to them i'm sure but i don't want to know about that part i'm not interested at just how they aggravate me it's all i care about hello your side's awful it's human and that's the fight you know how it is hey man good you've been to that person look how they've treated you and there was the fight then you have the struggle and struggle okay lord help me help me help me then you see that brother or that sister and you hear that you know things they've said and they never come to you about you know it's funny people when they hear things they never go to the guy or the girl they will ask 14 people if it's true before they pick up the phone and ask you about it and every time they get through that 14 people to get through that big telephone they've done created it don't look nothing like the original and the guy that said it in the first place don't remember what he said i'm sorry grace i'm driving you crazy having to move that camera move that camera see she won't be mad at me tonight that guy but the point i make it to you folks is a lot of times the lord jesus will see those things he sees my heart i don't want to be short in my spirit i don't want to be irritated in my spirit no when i love people and i see him doing things that's wrong and aggravated and i want to see him do better so what do i do i fight and i wrestle struggle with me until i can get that thing under control get to surrender the lord until i can come to a place where i can legitimately honestly walk into prayer and pull that person up before the lord take them up there with me shoulder and shoulder and say now god you've helped me get my attitude right now help this brother get himself straightened out we put ourselves in such a bad position over and over and over again because we think it's our job to keep track of what we do you all ever hear about the marriage ceremony when the woman stands there in the old testament she stands at midnight when they do the ceremony takes her veil and she lays that veil across his shoulder the reason she does that is because symbolically she's telling everybody that's witnessing this marriage i am no longer responsible for me you got the holy ghost how many got it put your hand up like that yeah you know what you're saying you are no longer responsible for you he is responsible for every day-to-day thing so i should just quit worrying about things i don't but i should and i should trust him to be able to help me get one foot in front of the other and walk right what happens if i what's up good you mess up good question repent make it right go on we get so distraught because we do it guess what you're gonna do it again and if it ain't that it'll be something else well that's that's altar call expressions right there don't beat yourself up stop being the one that's got that catholic spirit on you to give yourself the cat of nine tails every time you mess up just go back to god and say lord you see mine you see what i'm trying to do help me do it stand with me let's let's quit here i've kept year five to nine again one of these days i'm gonna learn to shut up i'm sorry you gotta work and all these other things and here i am go go go go go let's pray many wonderful things were presented before us and i want to give you grateful in thanksgiving and sweet praise to you lord for speaking to us so clearly because lord the the subject tonight's divine healing i'm talking about healing of the soul of course help us lord to understand that if the soul is not completely healed of this stroke of iniquity will never be able to manifest perfect perfect faith perfect love and even perfection as you said matthew 5 48 be ye perfect oh god how will we ever get there if this soul condition isn't healed help us lord lord they're just like me i'm just like them we get discouraged when we do things that we think is displeasing to you sure and it's good that we do i'm glad i've got conviction i'm sure they're glad they feel convicted when they do things wrong but lord jesus help us to draw a line in the sand between what you see and what we see help us rightly divide those attitudes and spirits when we see humanity working on us help us lord not to be so critical of ourselves that we can't even pray sometimes because we make ourselves feel so unworthy when the reality is we could make ourselves feel worthy it takes your blood your righteousness your cleansing to do that we're not feeling worthy because we make or feel or we're we're basing it upon what we think is worthiness and lord i pray you will help us get this divided in our hearts tonight and may everyone under the sound of my voice may you bless them and encourage them and strengthen them by these words that were spoken here tonight and god let us walk out of here tonight with a new vision for our lives and a new perspective on how to live before you grant it my lord as we love you and thank you tonight heal every one of us god in jesus name amen amen you just raise your hands up the lord and say thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord praise his name let's say amen anything you want praise his holy name oh thank you lord thank you lord jesus [Music] god bless all the saints listening as well may the lord bless you greatly [Music] to run with god [Music] [Music] in a secret place [Music] there in the spirit [Music] beholding his face don't you want this [Music] [Music] to be shotted as they played quietly think about this a moment when aaron's rod was in that presence of god it was a stick behave like a stick acted like a stick as that's what it was but when the holy ghost come upon that element the elements and the components and the structuring and the fibers of it all the science you can throw at that stick when god looked out of that stick and he got it in the presence of god he brought things out of it that that stick could not bring out of itself why because that rod was intended by creation's purpose to bring forth flowers to bring forth fruit to bring forth god created that seed to bring forth of its kind it couldn't do it on its own but when it got in the presence of god god gave it the power to live out its predestination i didn't get to it brother bram said that's why you can hear the word because you're predestinated for that purpose hallelujah there in the spirit can you imagine this beholding [Music] isn't that what you want for it [Music] give her [Music] to it's my intention i long [Music] to be shot in with god [Music] just let us anointing his spirit just let it just let it hover around tonight just absorb that good rich presence of god be holding his face for i'm gaining [Music] jesus i long to be shedding with you lord in with god listen that little chorus sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweep [Music] just a minute before we go okay sweep over my soul sweet spirit [Music] we fixing to go get all
