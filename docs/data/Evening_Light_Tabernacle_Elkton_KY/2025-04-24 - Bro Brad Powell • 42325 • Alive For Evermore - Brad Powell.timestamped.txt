[23:09] Let's go before the
[23:11] Lord. Dear gracious heavenly father,
[23:14] Lord, we come once again to you today,
[23:17] Lord, giving you thanks for the desire
[23:20] in our hearts to be here today, Lord
[23:21] Jesus. We're so glad, oh Father God,
[23:24] that you led our footsteps to this very
[23:27] place,
[23:28] Lord, to the house of God. And father, I
[23:31] was thinking about your servant King
[23:34] David, Lord, when he said
[23:37] that one day in the house of the Lord is
[23:40] better than a thousand outside. And
[23:43] Lord, that is so true. Oh God, if we are
[23:46] here just once, Lord, what a blessing it
[23:49] is, Lord. We rather be here than
[23:51] anywhere else, Lord, because this is
[23:53] this is where Father God is. This is
[23:55] where your presence is. This is where we
[23:57] can lay lay down our burdens at your
[24:00] feet, Lord. No matter what they may
[24:03] be. Father, we bring these prayer
[24:05] requests before you, oh God. You know
[24:08] them all, Father. Before they were
[24:10] pinned down, there were there was faith
[24:12] in the hearts of those people, Lord, who
[24:16] took it upon themselves to cry out to
[24:18] you in faith. And we pray, heavenly
[24:21] father, oh God, that as you had respect
[24:23] unto the faith of Abel back at the
[24:27] beginning, Lord, we pray that you would
[24:29] have respect unto the faith of those,
[24:33] Lord, who pinned down these requests,
[24:35] Lord. May you come and meet them in a
[24:38] special way, Lord. And not only those,
[24:41] oh Lord, that were read, not only those
[24:43] requests that were unspoken, but oh God,
[24:46] we all have needs. Some have spiritual
[24:49] needs, other have financial needs, other
[24:52] have Lord, just needs everywhere. But
[24:55] we're so glad that heavenly father, we
[24:58] serve a mighty God. We serve a living
[25:00] God. And we know that you're touched by
[25:03] the feelings of our infirmities. Lord,
[25:05] we know you're moved when we pray. And
[25:08] you're a merciful. You're a merciful
[25:10] God. You love fatherhood. And you love
[25:13] to bless your children, Lord. So we pray
[25:16] you come Lord to those who are in need
[25:18] at this time. And we pray that Lord you
[25:22] would touch them in a special way. Lord
[25:24] may you confirm your word with signs
[25:28] following for themselves. Lord may they
[25:31] know they come into the presence of the
[25:33] living God to receive what they have
[25:35] need of. Lord you promised in your word
[25:38] that you would meet all of our needs.
[25:40] you would you didn't promise that you
[25:42] give us our wants, Lord. But our needs
[25:44] are met, Lord, because it's a promise
[25:46] that was given by you to us, Lord Jesus.
[25:50] Father, we pray for the offering that
[25:51] will be taken up, Lord. May you multiply
[25:54] it and may it serve its purpose for what
[25:56] is given for, Lord. Lord, we love you
[25:59] tonight and we just thank you for all
[26:00] these things. We bless your wonderful
[26:03] name, Lord. Father, we're just happy to
[26:06] be here at your feet, ready to receive
[26:09] what you will have for us tonight. Lord,
[26:11] in the precious name of our Lord and
[26:13] Savior Jesus Christ, we pray today.
[26:16] Amen. Amen.
[26:20] Father, I appreciate
[26:22] you. Oh, heavenly
[26:25] father, I
[26:29] appreciate you.

[26:36] father, I

[36:07] congregation. It might do us all a
[36:09] little good. Will you thank Sister
[36:11] Becky? Amen. Praise the Lord. Turn in
[36:14] your Bibles if you would to Revelations
[36:16] chapter
[36:21] 1. Certainly glad to be be here and be
[36:25] able to be a help for our pastor. And
[36:28] when he's called on us, we've able to
[36:30] help and minister. And if you'll endure,
[36:33] we'll we'll just preach tonight. And I
[36:35] don't say if you'll endure, if you'll
[36:37] pull, we'll preach tonight. If you
[36:40] endure, we're not going to do much. So,
[36:43] we'll just let the Lord have his way.
[36:45] And I I had to I was kind of at a I
[36:50] guess you would call it a writer's
[36:51] block, if that's what you want to call
[36:52] it. And kind of was thinking, man, I
[36:55] don't know what we're going to preach
[36:56] on. But then just just like that, as I
[36:58] began to pray and get my mind before the
[37:00] Lord and my heart before the Lord,
[37:02] things started coming. And I believe the
[37:04] Lord's really got something that'll be
[37:05] good for us tonight. So I won't keep you
[37:08] standing long. I'm going to read
[37:09] Revelations chap out of chapter 1 verse
[37:12] 18. And it
[37:15] says, I am he that liveth and was dead,
[37:19] and behold, I am alive forever more.
[37:23] Amen. and I have the keys of hell and of
[37:26] death. My title this evening will be
[37:29] alive forever more. Let's pray. Heavenly
[37:32] Father, we come before you tonight with
[37:34] grateful hearts. Thankful Lord to be in
[37:36] your house that you've allowed us
[37:37] another opportunity to come and just to
[37:40] hear what you would have in store for
[37:41] us. So Lord, we come with expectations
[37:43] tonight and we just ask that you would
[37:45] just fill our plate tonight and and
[37:47] satisfy our appetite for more of you.
[37:49] Lord, that you would just move in a
[37:50] mighty way tonight. speak to our hearts.
[37:53] Encourage those that are downhearted or
[37:55] downcast and encourage uh the ones who
[37:58] need encouraging. Lift up those who are
[38:00] down and brokenhearted and sad and
[38:01] afflicted, Lord, and those who are sick.
[38:04] We ask that you would touch them tonight
[38:05] and through the ministering of your
[38:06] word. May they find their healing and
[38:08] may we find our peace and may we find
[38:11] you, Lord, the the breath and the life
[38:13] of us all. We love you, Lord, with all
[38:14] of our hearts in Jesus name. Amen. And
[38:17] you can be
[38:18] seated alive forever
[38:22] more. You know,
[38:24] Jesus when he was on the
[38:27] cross, and this has been kind of
[38:29] circulating through through social media
[38:32] and little clips and so forth. So, if
[38:33] you've heard it, that's fine. It's worth
[38:36] repeating. When Jesus was on the cross
[38:39] and he cried out, "It is
[38:43] finished." And then you look at that and
[38:45] you look at what that means. There's
[38:46] more. It's a little deeper than what we
[38:48] think. And we look at it in and in the
[38:50] Greek there's a word that's
[38:53] totalisty.
[38:55] Tatelisty. And when you look at that
[38:57] Greek word to telly in in the business
[38:59] realm, it means that the debt has been p
[39:02] fully paid in full. It's they write it
[39:04] on a on a receipt to tell us. Your debt
[39:07] has been paid in full.
[39:10] In the court system, they use that word
[39:12] in the Greek to telly. It means that the
[39:15] sentence has been fully served.
[39:20] Thank you, Lord.
[39:22] And on the battlefield, the military
[39:24] uses it to tell us that the battle has
[39:28] been won.
[39:30] So when Jesus was on the cross and he's
[39:33] up there and he's bleeding and dying,
[39:34] he's hanging on the cross and he cries
[39:36] out, "It is finished or to tell us,"
[39:40] what is he saying? He is he is declaring
[39:42] that the debt of your sin has been fully
[39:44] paid. The judgment for your sin has been
[39:47] fully served and the war against death
[39:50] has been completely won.
[39:54] To tell us
[39:56] and so when we think about that word,
[39:58] we're looking here and I want to look at
[39:59] this tonight. I want to just continue
[40:01] with the thought of the cross and what
[40:02] happens after that. And we're looking
[40:04] here and I want to go right into a story
[40:06] where the prophet comes in and and he
[40:09] says there was a couple by the name of
[40:10] one Cleopus and so forth. You know, the
[40:13] Bible doesn't tell who was with Cleopus.
[40:15] You can't find it. It's not in there.
[40:17] But here they are here. This couple is
[40:19] is walking and they're on the road to
[40:21] Emmas. And the prophet says they're
[40:23] going on the road to Emmas and they're
[40:25] sad and they're they're sadhearted.
[40:27] They're brokenhearted and they're going
[40:29] along the way and they're talking about
[40:31] this and they're talking about how bad
[40:33] it was and they're talking about how bad
[40:36] it was and then all of a sudden he said
[40:37] someone stepped out of the bushes.
[40:41] And he said someone stepped out of the
[40:43] bushes and this man was was just an
[40:45] ordinary man. He he was no different
[40:47] dressed. He he looked like the rest. He
[40:49] wore his hair, his beard, everything
[40:50] looked the same. And he looked like the
[40:52] rest of them. He wasn't any different.
[40:54] And we don't need him to be a great
[40:56] different. His life proved his
[40:59] credentials.
[41:01] His life proved his credi credentials.
[41:04] He said, "And that's what God wants us
[41:06] to be. He wants our lives to prove our
[41:10] credentials."
[41:12] Amen. He said, then he began to talk
[41:15] along the way and and and he says,
[41:17] "Brethren, why are you so
[41:22] sad? Think about this.
[41:25] The death, burial, and resurrection had
[41:27] just taken place. Brethren, why are you
[41:29] so
[41:30] sad? And they look at him, they said,
[41:32] "Are you a stranger from around here,
[41:34] sir? Do you not know what has happened?
[41:37] The whole country is torn up. The whole
[41:41] country is torn up with what's going on.
[41:43] And we're walking on our road back to
[41:45] the home because we thought Jesus of
[41:47] Nazareth was the prophet. We thought he
[41:50] was the king of Israel. We thought he
[41:52] was the Messiah." And now he is dead.
[41:56] They've buried
[41:58] him. They pierced him in his heart. They
[42:00] put him in the ground. And they And now
[42:02] they buried him away. They put him
[42:04] away. And now to add matters word worse
[42:07] matters on this third day there's women
[42:09] that's went down to the grave. And they
[42:11] say they seen visions of
[42:13] angels and they say that he's alive,
[42:16] that he's risen. But we can't believe
[42:18] that. That's just a story. We're they
[42:20] were just carrying
[42:26] on. So going along
[42:29] here, the resurrected
[42:32] savior, he looks at these guys and says,
[42:34] "You fools, and you're slow of heart not
[42:37] to believe all that the prophets have
[42:39] said concerning Christ, how he must
[42:41] suffer, how he must die, and how he must
[42:44] rise again on the third day. How
[42:46] slothful are you?"
[42:49] Woo.
[42:51] Turn to Luke chapter
[42:55] 24. We'll read here. Luke chapter
[42:59] 24 verse
[43:03] one. Now upon the first day of the week.
[43:07] Are you there? Say amen when you're
[43:08] there.
[43:11] On the first day of the
[43:13] week, notice that. I want you to keep
[43:15] that in your mind. the first day of the
[43:17] week. Very early in the morning, they
[43:19] came unto the suppler bringing spices
[43:21] which they had prepared and certain
[43:23] others with them. And they found the
[43:26] stone rolled away from the suppler. Now,
[43:29] in our minds, we read that and we think,
[43:31] "Praise God, he's alive. The cross
[43:34] couldn't hold him. The grave couldn't
[43:36] keep him. Death couldn't defeat him.
[43:38] He's alive."
[43:41] That's right. But what did those
[43:42] believers think? They entered in and
[43:45] they found not the body of the Lord
[43:47] Jesus. And it came to pass they were
[43:48] much
[43:50] perplexed. Perplexed. They were
[43:52] completely
[43:57] baffled. I hope you I hope you're going
[43:59] with me. But they were completely
[44:02] baffled. They were perplexed. There
[44:04] about two men stood about them in
[44:06] shining garments. And as they were what?
[44:08] Afraid. Is this a time to be afraid when
[44:11] the savior of the world has just
[44:13] resurrected and they're looking at here
[44:15] and they're bringing spices to embalm
[44:17] and they're looking here and they're
[44:19] afraid and they fall down on their faces
[44:21] and what does the angel say? Why seek ye
[44:23] the living among the dead?
[44:26] It took an angel of God to pull the
[44:28] remembrance of what was supposed to
[44:30] happen.
[44:32] That's right. He's not here, but he's
[44:34] risen. remember how he spake unto you
[44:36] when he was in Galilee. And so, in other
[44:39] words, they're saying, "Listen, ladies,
[44:41] can't you remember what he told you
[44:43] would happen?" The very angels of God
[44:46] are bringing to remembrance the events
[44:49] day after day. He'll be suffering. He'll
[44:51] have to cru crucify. He'll have to die
[44:54] for three days. He'll lay in the ground.
[44:56] Then, he'll rise again. Can't you
[44:58] remember what he said?
[45:01] And they say, "The son of man should
[45:03] must be delivered into the hands." And
[45:04] they tell him this and he'll rise on the
[45:06] third day. And they remembered the
[45:09] words. Brothers and sisters, if we could
[45:12] just remember the words.
[45:15] If we could just remember the words
[45:17] tonight during our struggles, during our
[45:19] darkest hours, we need to remember the
[45:22] words. It is finished to tell us. Our
[45:25] debt's been paid.
[45:27] Sickness has been defeated.
[45:32] Sorrows are now
[45:34] joy. This is what the angel was trying
[45:36] to remember, bring to their remembrance.
[45:39] And and they returned from the suppler
[45:41] and told all these things to the 11 and
[45:43] to all the rest. Now I want you to watch
[45:46] this. So now during all this hard times,
[45:48] grief is surrounding this group of
[45:51] believers. Notice I said believers.
[45:57] And here they are surrounded in grief.
[45:59] and they're they're surrounded and
[46:01] they're during hard times and they're
[46:03] crying and they're mourning and they're
[46:07] wailing
[46:09] believers over a risen savior.
[46:16] Hm. And all of a sudden, these these
[46:18] ladies start to remember the words of
[46:22] Jesus. And they start to stand on these
[46:25] words. And they begin to use the words
[46:27] to to build a foundation on which the
[46:29] gospel is to be shared. And Mary and
[46:32] Joanna, they begin to testify. Listen
[46:35] guys, listen what's happened. We went
[46:36] down there to the tomb and the tomb was
[46:38] rolled. The the the the stone was rolled
[46:40] away and he wasn't there. Amen.
[46:45] They begin to tell these other
[46:48] apostles. And what does it say in verse
[46:52] 11? Their words seemed to them as idol
[46:57] tales and they believed them
[47:03] not. Huh? Isn't that an amazing thing in
[47:06] the Bible? We overlook that because this
[47:09] scripture means so much to us. It
[47:11] encompasses our whole life, our whole
[47:14] well-being, our whole victory, our whole
[47:17] eternal life is right here in this
[47:19] scripture. And here they are. They can't
[47:21] even believe
[47:25] it. Brother Brandham's talking. He's
[47:28] telling them more about this road to
[47:29] Emmas. And he's talking, he says, I want
[47:31] you to look how beautiful. Look at this.
[47:33] Christ among the sad and the
[47:35] brokenhearted. That's where he
[47:37] goes. Amen.
[47:40] Aren't you thankful?
[47:43] That's where he goes. They were going
[47:45] along in their darkest hour that they
[47:47] had ever seen. All their hopes was gone.
[47:50] Listen now. These these brothers have
[47:52] been put out of church. They've been
[47:54] kicked out of their groups. They had
[47:56] been kicked out of society, out of their
[47:58] synagogues because they believed on him.
[48:00] They trusted on Jesus Christ. And now
[48:02] here he was dead, lying in the tombs. So
[48:06] they think
[48:08] You see, sometimes our stinking thinking
[48:10] gets us in trouble. These are believers.
[48:13] These were Christians. These were the
[48:14] followers, the apostles of Jesus Christ,
[48:16] the disciples of Jesus Christ. And their
[48:18] stinking thinking puts them in a in a
[48:21] bondage.
[48:22] And sometimes it's our thinking of
[48:24] negativity and fear and doubt that puts
[48:26] us in bondage.
[48:31] And he said, "Now here was some women
[48:34] had come around with a little story
[48:36] about a vision. They'd seen some angels
[48:38] and they tell the and they and and tell
[48:40] his disciples that he would meet them in
[48:42] Galilee. But they couldn't believe that.
[48:44] Why? Because they were
[48:46] brokenhearted. They were sad. They were
[48:48] crying. And there the lovely Jesus
[48:50] appears amongst the brokenhearted
[48:54] all along. The very thing they had the
[48:56] most need of, they were
[48:59] rejecting. The very thing they had the
[49:02] most need of in their lives, they were
[49:03] denying.
[49:06] We're going to get to why later. And
[49:08] it's really astounding. Astounding when
[49:11] we look at it. He said he walked there
[49:13] with them men and began to talk to them.
[49:14] And he began to tell them, "Well, you
[49:16] ought to believe what the prophet said.
[49:17] You ought to believe all of the
[49:19] scriptures." All of the scriptures that
[49:21] was written. He says concerning Christ
[49:24] that he must suffer and die and rise
[49:26] again. But they were too brokenhearted.
[49:29] After a while, he began to speak. And
[49:31] there was something about this man. And
[49:33] he said he spoke just a little
[49:36] different. This man, he said he spoke
[49:38] different from other men. He wasn't from
[49:40] the average line of man. He said there
[49:43] was something about him that seemed to
[49:45] have such a deep sincerity in his
[49:48] voice. Can you imagine the voice of
[49:51] Jesus? And he begins to explain the
[49:53] scriptures to him. He said there was
[49:55] something about this meaning. There was
[49:57] something about the meaning in the
[49:59] scriptures. He began to explain them
[50:00] because he was a scriptural teacher. He
[50:03] said, "And the prophet said that Christ
[50:04] would die and raise again, and how their
[50:07] hearts begin to burn within them.
[50:11] Something be to take place.
[50:13] Something be to move on the inside as
[50:15] they begin to hear the words and Jesus
[50:17] begins to speak to them. Something be to
[50:19] move on the inside of them." And he
[50:21] says, listen to this. He said, "And they
[50:23] journeyied on and they talked through
[50:24] the day slowly walking right with the
[50:27] resurrected Christ and they didn't even
[50:31] know
[50:35] it." The quote don't stop there. Listen
[50:39] to what he says. He says, "How many
[50:40] times has he sat in the seat with you?
[50:43] How many times has he stood with you in
[50:45] the hours of your trials, of your
[50:47] troubles, and you didn't recognize it?
[50:50] Oh, I can say I've been guilty as I look
[50:53] back in my life and I say there was
[50:54] times I went through things that I
[50:56] thought I was on my own and I was all
[50:58] alone, but it was God standing there all
[51:00] along, standing by my side, leading me
[51:03] and guiding me and giving me a good
[51:05] spirit about myself.
[51:07] [Applause]
[51:08] And he said, "How many times was he at
[51:10] the wheel when you were almost killed in
[51:12] an accident and you didn't even know it?
[51:17] How many times you didn't recognize him?
[51:20] How that he was with you when the barrel
[51:23] was empty and the cruise was dry.
[51:29] You know, a lot of us we look back or we
[51:32] could should be able to look back. Most
[51:33] of us in here come from meager
[51:35] beginnings. I would say most of us in
[51:38] here now can probably say the Lord has
[51:39] blessed us. We we're doing good. We we
[51:42] we really don't have need a need for
[51:45] nothing. We may want some things, but
[51:46] our needs are met.
[51:50] But you can probably look back at a time
[51:51] when your cruise was dry.
[51:55] And he said, "How many times was that
[51:56] there when there was nothing for the
[51:58] babies and how that man come and set
[52:00] them groceries down on the front door
[52:02] for whatever reason it was." He said,
[52:04] "That was Christ. That was Christ right
[52:07] there. That was Christ. And he's alive
[52:09] today. Not dead, but he's alive." And
[52:12] that's the way it is in our life. He's
[52:13] still alive today. meeting our needs,
[52:15] our children's
[52:17] needs. He's moving in our
[52:19] midst. How quickly and how many times we
[52:22] find ourselves, think about this, in
[52:25] phenomenal church
[52:26] services. We find ourselves in
[52:29] phenomenal church services and and we
[52:31] feel the spirit moving amongst us a and
[52:34] there's such a presence that sweeps
[52:36] through the
[52:37] building and we pray at times that the
[52:40] Lord sweep through each aisle and we can
[52:43] feel that presence sweep through and and
[52:44] he's meeting each need and he's touching
[52:46] each heart and he's going and visiting
[52:48] each heart along the
[52:50] way and at that
[52:53] moment and under that
[52:56] inspiration you You throw your shoulders
[52:59] back. You feel
[53:02] unstoppable at that time when that
[53:04] spirit is moving in your life and the
[53:06] music's playing, the anointing's on, and
[53:08] you're feeling lightfooted. You can't be
[53:10] beat, Satan. You can't beat me with
[53:13] anything you throw at me. Why? Because
[53:15] I'm an invincible army. I'm moving under
[53:17] that inspiration, under that spirit.
[53:20] And you wake up and it's Monday morning.
[53:30] We just got done with Easter and one of
[53:31] my favorite sermons is SM Lockheart. Are
[53:36] you familiar with
[53:37] him? Probably most of you probably not.
[53:40] Black minister from in the early 1900s.
[53:44] His name is SM Lockheart. He wasn't
[53:47] expected to live. He wasn't given hope
[53:49] to live. He they they doctors had given
[53:51] him up. His mama named him SM Lockheart.
[53:54] Shadrach, Mach
[53:58] Lockheart. She left a bindigo
[54:01] out, but that's what SM is. And he's the
[54:05] one that preaches the sermon that's been
[54:07] played for thou for hundreds for for the
[54:09] last 10
[54:10] decades. Sunday's
[54:14] coming. It's
[54:16] Friday. We like that part, don't we? We
[54:20] like that part. Jesus is praying.
[54:22] Peter's asleeping. Judas is betraying,
[54:24] but Sunday's coming.
[54:26] And he preaches that sermon over and
[54:28] over. It's
[54:30] Friday. Pilots are struggling. The
[54:33] council's constru conspiring. The the
[54:36] the the the crowd is vilifying. But
[54:39] Sunday's coming. Well, I'm here to tell
[54:41] you, Sunday's come and gone. Monday's
[54:43] just happened. Yeah,
[54:48] we get under the inspiration of those
[54:49] kinds of thoughts and those under under
[54:51] the inspiration of those kinds of
[54:52] sermons and the preachers that are
[54:54] pouring out their heart under the
[54:56] inspiration
[54:58] invincible. But
[55:00] Monday, I can't count the number of
[55:02] times that I've approached someone on a
[55:04] Monday
[55:05] morning. You know, I was a director for
[55:08] seven, eight years. It was my job to
[55:09] keep everybody on the up and up.
[55:12] So when I was when I was mad, when I was
[55:14] sad, when I was depressed, when I I had
[55:16] to wear a smile. So I'd go in on Monday
[55:18] morning. I can't tell you the number of
[55:19] times I would go in with a big smile on
[55:21] my face and say, "Good morning. How are
[55:22] you today?" And their reply is, "Well,
[55:25] it's a Monday."
[55:28] Oh, you've heard that, too.
[55:32] It's a
[55:33] Monday. It's a
[55:35] Monday. They're dwelling on a Monday.
[55:39] They're dwelling on a negativity.
[55:41] They're living in a place that their
[55:43] minds then go into a negative place and
[55:46] all day long it's
[55:49] Monday. Are we ever going to get through
[55:51] with Monday? And if they're having a
[55:54] real bad week on Thursday, you say,
[55:55] "How's your day going?" It's just
[55:57] another Monday.
[56:00] But they're living in those negative
[56:02] realms. They're living in negativity.
[56:04] And let me tell you what negativity
[56:07] scientifically has been proven to do to
[56:10] the human
[56:11] being. Oh, it's quiet
[56:14] now.
[56:16] Negativity has been scientifically
[56:19] proven. And this is why it's so
[56:21] important that we stay in a positive
[56:23] atmosphere, that we stay in the word.
[56:25] You know, there's nothing negative in
[56:26] the word. If you're having a bad day,
[56:29] open the word. If you're having a bad
[56:31] day, go to prayer. If you're having a
[56:33] bad day, recite scripture.
[56:36] But negativity leads to a variety of
[56:38] negative outcomes, including physical
[56:41] health issues, mental health issues,
[56:43] diminished ability to f to function
[56:46] effectively in daily life. It can also
[56:50] impact
[56:51] relationships and decision making. From
[56:55] the physical health, your immune system
[56:58] becomes suppressed.
[57:03] and that person's sick all the
[57:06] time. Now, if you're if you're a person
[57:08] that suffers from some sickness, I'm not
[57:10] saying you're a negative person, but I'm
[57:12] saying these are some of the symptoms
[57:14] that can happen under
[57:16] negativity. This Monday morning
[57:18] attitude, the immune system begins
[57:21] weakened. You become suscept susceptible
[57:23] to illness. Negative mo emotions can
[57:27] affect your digestion potentially
[57:29] leading to stomach problems and slowed
[57:33] digestion. You ever heard of irrital
[57:35] bowel syndrome? You didn't hear about
[57:37] that 40 years ago. Did you ever, brother
[57:41] Steve? Am I telling right? Never.
[57:45] But all of a sudden in this age, in this
[57:47] world of
[57:48] negativity, headaches, fatigue, chest
[57:52] pain, common physical symptoms
[57:55] associated with stress and negative
[57:58] thinking, changes in your metabolism.
[58:03] Uhoh. Why can't I lose no
[58:07] weight? Let's say it the other way. Why
[58:09] can't I gain no weight? You know,
[58:10] there's people that actually say that I
[58:12] just want to choke them.
[58:18] I just can't drink enough protein. I
[58:20] can't eat enough eggs. Shut up.
[58:28] But negativity affects your metabolism.
[58:30] Gain weight, lost weight. It disrupts
[58:32] your metabolism, impacting your weight
[58:34] and your energy levels. Negative
[58:36] thoughts interfere with your sleep, your
[58:39] quality, and your quantity.
[58:42] It leads to insomnia and sleep
[58:46] disturbances. You think maybe that might
[58:48] have a part to do with
[58:51] nightmares. Anxiety and
[58:54] depression. Negativity, negative
[58:57] thinking is the one major contributor is
[59:00] the major contributor to anxiety and
[59:05] depression. There was a whole lot more,
[59:07] but I only picked out some that I
[59:09] thought was pertinent.
[59:12] So this scientific evidence, what is
[59:14] this scientific evidence proving? It's
[59:16] proven that Satan wants you dwelling in
[59:18] negative thoughts.
[59:20] You see why negativity is so forced upon
[59:23] us? Why negativity is is just pushed and
[59:26] pushed and pushed? Brothers and sisters,
[59:28] there is an actual disease called Monday
[59:32] morning blues.
[59:36] They've named
[59:38] it. They've named it. They've named it
[59:41] because the Monday morning blues as a
[59:43] feeling of
[59:44] dread. You don't want to go to
[59:47] work. You don't want to go see your
[59:49] boss. You don't want to see your fellow
[59:51] employees. Everybody's blue. Everybody's
[59:54] mad. They didn't want the weekend to
[59:57] end. There's no
[1:00:00] excitement. Brother Josh,
[1:00:06] behave. I'll get to you in a minute.
[1:00:11] They don't feel the excitement. The work
[1:00:13] is beginning to build up on them. They
[1:00:14] feel overwhelmed in their
[1:00:17] workplace. Now, let me ask you, as a
[1:00:22] Christian, how many times as a Christian
[1:00:24] have you thought, "Man, I sure don't
[1:00:27] want Sunday to end."
[1:00:31] Come on, church. That would have been a
[1:00:33] little louder on that. Because why? We
[1:00:35] get into a church atmosphere. We become
[1:00:37] in a in a in a place with brothers and
[1:00:39] sisters of like precious faith. We begin
[1:00:42] to worship around the word of God. We
[1:00:44] begin to sing the songs of Zion. We
[1:00:46] begin to worship our Lord and lift him
[1:00:48] up on high. And we get in that
[1:00:50] atmosphere.
[1:00:53] And we don't want Sunday to end. Let me
[1:00:57] tell you, Sunday don't have to end.
[1:01:00] Sunday don't have to end. You can take
[1:01:03] Sunday with you on Monday, on Tuesday,
[1:01:06] on Wednesday, on Thursday, on Friday, on
[1:01:10] Saturday, until th Sunday again. You
[1:01:12] don't have to quit worshiping and
[1:01:14] serving and being happy in God just
[1:01:17] because the service is over. It's not
[1:01:20] because the preacher's preaching. It's
[1:01:22] not because the song leader singing.
[1:01:25] It's because he lives.
[1:01:29] He lives within my heart.
[1:01:32] I take him with me everywhere I go. I
[1:01:35] don't leave him here on Sunday.
[1:01:40] Oh, if you We shouldn't be s as
[1:01:42] Christians, we shouldn't be suffering
[1:01:43] from the Monday morning blues. We ought
[1:01:46] to be singing with the with the Monday
[1:01:48] morning blessings.
[1:01:50] We ought to be reflecting back on the
[1:01:52] word and says, "I can do all things
[1:01:53] through Christ who strengthens me." Be
[1:01:56] strong and courageous. Do not be afraid.
[1:01:58] Do not be discouraged. For the Lord your
[1:02:00] God will be with you wherever you go.
[1:02:04] That's what I want to recite on Monday
[1:02:06] morning. It's the blessings. Do not
[1:02:08] fear.
[1:02:12] How many of you ever wake up on Monday
[1:02:14] and you have that little anxiety
[1:02:19] pulling? Somebody be honest. Thank
[1:02:25] you. It's
[1:02:27] okay. It's that little anxiety that
[1:02:30] pulls and says, "My goodness, what am I
[1:02:32] going to have to do this
[1:02:34] week? What am I going to have to tackle
[1:02:36] this week? What is Satan going to throw
[1:02:38] at me this week?" And you begin to think
[1:02:41] of all the tasks that you have to do.
[1:02:45] But the Bible says, "Do not
[1:02:47] fear, for I am with you."
[1:02:51] Don't be dismayed.
[1:02:54] Don't be dismayed about this, for I am
[1:02:57] your God.
[1:02:59] When you think you're not strong enough,
[1:03:01] I will strengthen you and help you. You
[1:03:03] see, the Bible has an answer for every
[1:03:05] bit of negativity we face. We just have
[1:03:08] to get in there and find it. We have to
[1:03:09] dig in there and says, "I will uphold
[1:03:11] you with my righteous hand." It's not
[1:03:13] you. It's him on the
[1:03:15] inside. It's him on the inside holding
[1:03:18] you up, saying, "Keep pushing. Keep
[1:03:20] pushing. You're one of mine. Keep
[1:03:22] pushing.
[1:03:27] You say, "Well, I don't know if I can do
[1:03:29] it." Where's your hope? Because the
[1:03:31] Bible says, "Those who hope in the Lord
[1:03:33] will have their strength renewed."
[1:03:36] They will soar on wings like eagles.
[1:03:42] That's not a place of anxiety.
[1:03:46] That's not a place of
[1:03:47] fear. That's a place of freedom.
[1:03:51] That's a place of freedom. When you're
[1:03:52] soaring like eagles and you run and you
[1:03:56] never grow weary. Isn't that a feeling?
[1:03:58] Can you imagine? Can you imagine what it
[1:04:01] would be like? You know, I I I
[1:04:02] occasionally jog a little bit.
[1:04:04] Occasionally, I said when my knees ain't
[1:04:07] hurting, my ankles ain't
[1:04:09] rolled. And after about two miles, you
[1:04:12] reach to a point that is called a
[1:04:13] runner's
[1:04:16] high. And you feel like you can just
[1:04:18] keep going. Well, maybe some of you's
[1:04:20] never reached two miles.
[1:04:26] But at two miles,
[1:04:29] you feel like you can just keep going.
[1:04:31] Your breathing's regulated. Your legs
[1:04:34] quit burning. And at four miles, you
[1:04:36] think, man, will I ever stop? And after
[1:04:39] about five, five or six miles, I finally
[1:04:41] say, I got to go home. I got stuff I got
[1:04:43] to do.
[1:04:54] But we run. It's a feeling that you run
[1:04:56] and you don't grow weary.
[1:04:59] There's nothing to worry about. You run
[1:05:01] and you don't grow weary. You
[1:05:05] walk and not faint.
[1:05:10] When when do I do all this is the day
[1:05:13] that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice
[1:05:16] and be glad in it.
[1:05:18] That's every single day. We just
[1:05:21] celebrated the death, burial, and
[1:05:23] resurrection of our Lord and Savior this
[1:05:25] Sunday. But what now? What happens
[1:05:29] now?
[1:05:32] Monday. Let me show
[1:05:35] you. Oh, I'm having fun. And that
[1:05:37] clock's moving fast. It's having fun,
[1:05:38] too. It's moving.
[1:05:44] Day
[1:05:45] one after the
[1:05:48] resurrection, early in the morning,
[1:05:50] there's a group of several women, Mary,
[1:05:52] Magdalene, they they run to the tomb and
[1:05:54] they they go to complete the burial
[1:05:56] customs of of uh on behalf of Jesus. And
[1:06:00] so here they are in mourning and they're
[1:06:03] grieving after the greatest event that
[1:06:06] has ever taken place in the world's
[1:06:08] existence. And they're thinking negative
[1:06:12] thoughts. You say, "How do you know they
[1:06:14] were negative thoughts?" Well, if they
[1:06:16] were having positive thoughts, they
[1:06:18] wouldn't have needed any spices to
[1:06:20] embalm the body of
[1:06:22] Jesus. If they were thinking the
[1:06:24] thoughts they should have been thinking,
[1:06:26] they would have been saying, "Where's he
[1:06:28] at? Come see me, Lord. I know you hear
[1:06:31] me."
[1:06:34] If they were thinking the right kind of
[1:06:36] thoughts. But they go to the tomb and
[1:06:38] they look and they're alarmed. And Mary
[1:06:40] runs to Peter and John. And I want you
[1:06:42] to watch this is all through Matthew,
[1:06:43] Mark, Luke, and John. You have to dig
[1:06:45] into all of it to put it in
[1:06:46] chronological order. And they run to to
[1:06:49] Peter and John and with this distressing
[1:06:51] news, they've robbed the grave.
[1:06:57] They didn't come and say, "He's
[1:07:00] alive." They said, "He's robbed the
[1:07:03] grave.
[1:07:05] They've taken him. Why have they taken
[1:07:08] my Lord?" And so Peter, meanwhile, Peter
[1:07:11] and John, uh, they go in there to
[1:07:13] investigate her claims. They go in there
[1:07:15] and investigate. They want to see for
[1:07:17] their self that this body is
[1:07:20] gone. Well, Peter, knowing who he is,
[1:07:24] the little rock with a little bit of
[1:07:26] revelation, he goes back through there
[1:07:28] and and Peter and John, they begin to
[1:07:30] look at this and John, not
[1:07:33] Peter, John begins to believe that the
[1:07:36] resurrection has happened.
[1:07:38] It doesn't say what Peter's thinking.
[1:07:41] His his his thoughts aren't recorded.
[1:07:44] But John's beginning to think that this
[1:07:46] has happened. The other women that were
[1:07:48] with him reported angels to the
[1:07:49] apostles, Peter and John. They've not
[1:07:52] returned yet. So those women go to the
[1:07:54] remaining nine apostles and tell them
[1:07:56] the story. And they're in total
[1:07:59] disbelief. You are crazy.
[1:08:07] Why would the garrison of soldiers move
[1:08:09] the stone away and steal the
[1:08:12] body? You're
[1:08:14] crazy. And the Bible says that Mary then
[1:08:17] lingers around and weeps and cries and
[1:08:20] is fearful at the
[1:08:24] tomb. So now here's Mary. She's sitting
[1:08:26] at the tomb and she's boohooing and
[1:08:28] crying and she's looking in the tomb to
[1:08:30] see and trying to figure out what's
[1:08:31] going on. She's in disbelief.
[1:08:34] And all of a sudden, two
[1:08:36] angels look at her and they say, "I
[1:08:38] wonder why she's
[1:08:40] weeping." And from behind her, she's
[1:08:45] approached. Now, she doesn't look
[1:08:47] directly onto this guy. She thinks maybe
[1:08:50] it's the gardener, maybe it's somebody
[1:08:52] tending to the tombs, maybe it's
[1:08:54] somebody tending to the cemetery. And
[1:08:56] she's just boohooing and boohooing. And
[1:08:58] he says, "Mary,
[1:09:04] My
[1:09:05] Lord, my Lord. At the sound of his
[1:09:09] voice, Mary, she begins to look and she
[1:09:12] knows and she runs and she clings to him
[1:09:15] because now she knows my Lord is alive.
[1:09:18] This is Jesus's first appearance.
[1:09:22] the very first time he shows himself to
[1:09:25] the believers after his resurrection.
[1:09:27] And Mary's now clinging to him. And
[1:09:30] Jesus sends her back to the apostles
[1:09:32] with the news to prepare that he's going
[1:09:34] to be there later in the day. Go tell
[1:09:36] them I'm going to come later in the day.
[1:09:38] I'm going to show
[1:09:39] myself. The other women depart to go
[1:09:41] tell the go the the apostles what's
[1:09:43] going on. They're on their way back
[1:09:44] home. And Jesus appears to them.
[1:09:49] He sends them back the second time now
[1:09:52] that he has shown himself to his
[1:09:55] believers or should we say the
[1:10:02] doubters. Now let me ask you, is this
[1:10:05] Monday ever going to
[1:10:07] end? That's just the
[1:10:10] morning. This is the first day after the
[1:10:13] resurrection. So now is this Monday
[1:10:15] morning ever going to end? Later that
[1:10:17] same day, there's two disciples walking
[1:10:19] on their way to
[1:10:21] Emmas and they're
[1:10:23] pondering on what they've heard about
[1:10:25] the rumors of a
[1:10:27] resurrection. So now they're walking
[1:10:29] back and Jesus comes out behind them,
[1:10:31] steps out of the bushes like the prophet
[1:10:33] says, and he begins to walk with them
[1:10:36] along the way. And the Bible tells us
[1:10:38] that their eyes were holding that they
[1:10:40] should not know
[1:10:41] him. So I want you to think about this,
[1:10:44] brothers and sisters. Here they are.
[1:10:46] They have locked
[1:10:48] eyes with
[1:10:53] Jesus. They've locked eyes with Jesus as
[1:10:56] he's talked along the
[1:10:59] way. Their ears have heard the very
[1:11:02] voice lip to ear. They've rubbed
[1:11:06] shoulders on this road to Emmas. Now, I
[1:11:10] want you to know this road to Emmas, the
[1:11:12] travel distance was about seven miles
[1:11:15] long.
[1:11:18] Seven
[1:11:21] miles I can do. I can walk about four
[1:11:24] miles walking four miles in an hour. So
[1:11:27] let's just figure for two to two and a
[1:11:29] half hours because the prophet said they
[1:11:31] walk
[1:11:33] slowly. They walking along the way for
[1:11:35] two and a half hours. And Jesus is
[1:11:38] talking small talk with these guys.
[1:11:41] These two followers, this disciples,
[1:11:43] Cleopus and the
[1:11:45] unknown. Some say it was his wife, some
[1:11:48] say it was Luke, some say it's you. Put
[1:11:50] yourself in the shoes. They say that's
[1:11:52] why they left the story the way it is so
[1:11:54] that you can identify yourself in that
[1:11:57] in that
[1:11:59] journey. Two and a half hours they're
[1:12:02] walking with the resurrected savior of
[1:12:05] the entire world and they don't even
[1:12:08] know it.
[1:12:10] Think about this. Sometimes we beat
[1:12:13] ourselves down so much when we fail to
[1:12:18] realize that God is moving in our
[1:12:20] midst. We don't give oursel enough
[1:12:23] credit. We don't give God enough credit
[1:12:25] in our
[1:12:26] lives. We fail to realize all of the
[1:12:29] goodness. You got a clothes on your
[1:12:31] back. You got a roof over your head. You
[1:12:33] got a job. You got food on your table.
[1:12:35] You got kids in your house. Your kids
[1:12:38] are serving the Lord. your business is
[1:12:40] prospering,
[1:12:42] your home is doing well. And we then
[1:12:45] then we begin to look and we get
[1:12:46] discouraged. I'm so discouraged. Nobody
[1:12:48] appreciates
[1:12:51] me. Nobody
[1:12:55] cares. Where's your Jesus? That's right.
[1:13:00] Where's your Jesus? That's right. He's
[1:13:03] supposed to be right here. That's right.
[1:13:07] I went to a nursing home the other day
[1:13:10] and this lady that that's working there,
[1:13:14] she worked there a year and a half ago.
[1:13:17] Let me back up to a year and a half.
[1:13:18] I've told this story. My wife says I've
[1:13:20] never told her or told this story. She's
[1:13:22] like, "Are you never told?" I said,
[1:13:23] "Yeah, I've told the church. You must
[1:13:24] have been
[1:13:29] sleeping." I didn't really tell her
[1:13:31] that. I just said that here.
[1:13:34] Lord, help me.
[1:13:36] will.
[1:13:38] But I went to this nursing home about a
[1:13:40] year and a half ago and there was this
[1:13:41] woman. She's in her office and just
[1:13:43] boohoo and crocodile
[1:13:44] tears. And she's crying with all and
[1:13:47] she's
[1:13:48] heaving. You know how you get the heaves
[1:13:50] when you get to crying. And she's
[1:13:52] heaving and she says, "Brad, aren't you
[1:13:55] a preacher?" I said, "I am." She said,
[1:13:58] "Would you please pray for me?" I said,
[1:14:00] "What in the world is going on?"
[1:14:04] She said, "I've been married
[1:14:05] for TW, I think it was 27
[1:14:09] years, faithfully married. My husband
[1:14:12] has started cheating with another
[1:14:18] woman." She said, "Will you pray for
[1:14:21] me?" Now, listen now. I'm I I I'm
[1:14:23] in no man's land. Timbook two. They
[1:14:27] don't know
[1:14:31] me. And it's an awkward
[1:14:35] situation. I look at her dress. I look
[1:14:37] at the, you know, I look at the, we're
[1:14:39] human. We look at the outer appearance.
[1:14:41] She don't look a lot like
[1:14:44] us. But she had a need in her
[1:14:47] life. She was hurting so much on the
[1:14:50] inside. She said, "Would you pray that
[1:14:52] God will save my
[1:14:54] marriage?" I said, "I'll do that."
[1:14:58] And I know she didn't mean when I got
[1:15:01] home. So I said, "You get one of the
[1:15:03] other girls here to come in here, one of
[1:15:06] the other ladies that works here to come
[1:15:08] in here." And I said, "We'll pray." She
[1:15:12] called her friend. She was boohooing.
[1:15:14] She already knew what was going on. And
[1:15:16] we just put put our hands on her
[1:15:18] shoulder and we began to pray. And I
[1:15:20] said, "God, you hear the cries of your
[1:15:23] people. You know the pain. You know the
[1:15:25] suffering. You know the hurt. you know
[1:15:27] how broken she is, but her desire is for
[1:15:31] her marriage to be
[1:15:33] restored. I said, "Lord, we know this is
[1:15:36] going to take time. This is going to
[1:15:38] take patience. This is going to take
[1:15:40] you, but it can
[1:15:43] be." I come back about two or three
[1:15:46] weeks later. I I make a
[1:15:48] route. She's not working there anymore.
[1:15:50] I said, "Where's so and so?"
[1:15:54] He
[1:15:54] said, "She's having such a rough time.
[1:15:58] She can't be on time for work. She
[1:16:00] couldn't put in her hours. She couldn't
[1:16:02] she couldn't dedicate herself like she
[1:16:04] was supposed
[1:16:05] to. So, she just finally she just said,
[1:16:07] "I
[1:16:08] quit. Life's too hard. I quit." I
[1:16:10] thought, "My
[1:16:12] goodness. My goodness."
[1:16:16] for over the next year, every time I
[1:16:18] would go, I would just kind of wonder
[1:16:20] because a lot of times in nursing homes,
[1:16:22] if you've been around them, you know,
[1:16:23] people kind of make a
[1:16:25] route. They work a while, they quit,
[1:16:27] they work a while, they they quit, they
[1:16:29] work a while. And I kept thinking, one
[1:16:31] of these days, maybe she'll come back.
[1:16:32] So I I go to the administrator and I
[1:16:34] say, "Hey, have you heard from so- and
[1:16:35] so?" Because the admin she was the
[1:16:37] administrator's right hand, basically.
[1:16:39] And I said, and for a year, I said, "Are
[1:16:41] you going to hire anybody to help you
[1:16:43] because you're getting kind of
[1:16:44] overworked." I could see it. She said,
[1:16:46] 'N no, I can't find nobody. I can't find
[1:16:48] nobody. I said, 'Well, have you have you
[1:16:50] talked to so and so? I'm not going to
[1:16:52] call her name. Have you talked to so and
[1:16:55] so? And she said,
[1:16:58] "Yeah, but she's not ready to come back
[1:17:00] to work." I said,
[1:17:02] "Okay." About a year and a half now
[1:17:04] passes currently up to two weeks ago,
[1:17:08] four four weeks ago. And I walk in and
[1:17:11] she's sitting at the desk behind the
[1:17:12] desk on the computer.
[1:17:15] And I said, 'Hey, what are you doing?
[1:17:18] She said, Brad, I'm back.
[1:17:21] And I'm married. Amen.
[1:17:24] We got involved in a good
[1:17:26] church and me and my husband worked
[1:17:29] things out. She said, "I think about
[1:17:32] that a lot when you prayed for me that
[1:17:33] day." She said, "But I want you to know
[1:17:35] God worked everything out in our lives.
[1:17:38] He's faithful. I'm faithful. We're
[1:17:40] happy." And I said, "Praise the Lord.
[1:17:42] I'm so happy for you.
[1:17:50] And I was over at the computer getting
[1:17:52] ready to run some stuff off at the
[1:17:53] printer and there was a little Jesus on
[1:17:56] there. You seen those little Jesuses?
[1:17:58] Have anybody seen them little Jesus? I
[1:18:01] wanted I've been want one of them little
[1:18:02] Jesus so bad. I mean I I I've been
[1:18:04] wanting to I was going to buy them by
[1:18:06] the hundreds and hand them out. They
[1:18:07] little bitty look like about the size of
[1:18:09] a Lego. They call them little Jesus. And
[1:18:12] I said, 'Hey, there's a little
[1:18:14] Jesus. And she said, 'You want one?' I
[1:18:18] said, 'You got one? You got an extra
[1:18:20] one? Because you're not supposed to take
[1:18:21] them if it's somebody's only Jesus, you
[1:18:23] know. And she said, I got a pocket full.
[1:18:26] She said, I give them out everywhere I
[1:18:28] go. You can have a little Jesus. I said,
[1:18:30] I need a little Jesus. Let me have him.
[1:18:33] I put that little Jesus in my
[1:18:36] pocket. I carried that little Jesus with
[1:18:38] me. I brought it out. I showed you. I
[1:18:39] said, look what I got. I got a little
[1:18:41] Jesus. She said, "Where'd you get that?"
[1:18:43] So, I go to tell her a story and I get
[1:18:45] in the truck and it's sticking in my
[1:18:46] pocket. So, I stick it out and I put it
[1:18:48] on the dash of my truck and he's been
[1:18:50] riding there for the last few days. We
[1:18:54] coming to church tonight and she looks
[1:18:55] she says, "How you got that Jesus
[1:18:57] standing up there?" I said, "Jesus,
[1:18:58] don't
[1:19:04] fall. Jesus don't fall."
[1:19:09] But that just goes to show you what God
[1:19:11] can do when you apply him in our lives.
[1:19:14] When you believe and you stand on faith
[1:19:16] and you work and you let God move on the
[1:19:18] scene instead of beating ourselves
[1:19:22] down. Be what God wants you to be.
[1:19:27] After this seven mile journey, Jesus is
[1:19:30] now sharing a meal with these two
[1:19:32] disciples, Cleopus and the
[1:19:34] unknown. And Jesus is sharing this meal
[1:19:37] with the disciples and he begins to
[1:19:38] break the
[1:19:41] bread. And something about breaking that
[1:19:44] bread draws a remembrance into their
[1:19:47] mind because you know there was a time
[1:19:50] when Jesus broke the bread. There was a
[1:19:53] few loaves and a couple of fishes.
[1:19:56] But Jesus took those five loaves and
[1:19:59] began to break. And he broke and he
[1:20:02] handed and he broke and he handed and he
[1:20:04] broke and he handed and he broke and he
[1:20:06] handed and they said, "Hey, I've seen
[1:20:09] that
[1:20:11] before. I've seen that before." And he
[1:20:14] began to break the bread. And as he was
[1:20:15] breaking, they it brought back to their
[1:20:17] remembrance of what he was and who he
[1:20:19] was. And they said, "This is the one who
[1:20:21] fed over 20,000 people. Look at him.
[1:20:24] Look at him, Cleopus. Look at him. And
[1:20:26] he began to break bread again. And he
[1:20:28] said,
[1:20:29] "Here,
[1:20:31] bless." And then they see the nail scars
[1:20:34] in his
[1:20:37] hands. Did you ever realize when he
[1:20:39] broke the bread, he had to show them
[1:20:40] palms
[1:20:43] up. Look at the nail scars in my
[1:20:46] hands. Their eyes came open. Their eyes
[1:20:51] came open. They He revealed his true
[1:20:54] identity. They've been talking about
[1:20:55] this death, this burial, this
[1:20:56] resurrection. They were so sad. But when
[1:20:59] he spoke and when he broke bread, their
[1:21:00] hearts began to burn on the
[1:21:06] inside. This was the third time now
[1:21:09] Jesus has showed
[1:21:11] himself to unbelieving or I should say
[1:21:14] doubting
[1:21:20] believers. You got to remember this.
[1:21:23] This wasn't the people who mocked him.
[1:21:26] This wasn't the people who spit on him.
[1:21:29] This wasn't the people who who who uh
[1:21:31] tortured him and and wanted to see him
[1:21:32] and cried for him to be crucified. This
[1:21:34] was not the people. This was the people
[1:21:36] who loved him. This was the people who
[1:21:39] followed him. This was the people who
[1:21:40] adored him. But yet they could not
[1:21:46] see. These two disciples returned that
[1:21:48] evening to go to Jerusalem. And they
[1:21:50] say, "Go, let's go tell the apostles."
[1:21:52] So, Cleopus and the Unnamed go and they
[1:21:55] begin to tell the apostles what
[1:21:56] happened. Let me tell you what happened
[1:21:58] on our way here. You'll never believe
[1:22:02] this. And they
[1:22:05] didn't. They didn't believe them no more
[1:22:07] than they believed when the women come
[1:22:09] and told them. But at some point along
[1:22:11] the way, Peter says, "I got to think
[1:22:14] about this. I'm going to have to take me
[1:22:15] a little walk." And so Peter goes out
[1:22:18] now and he begins to take him a walk and
[1:22:19] he's thinking now I've heard about
[1:22:21] Mary's story. I've seen the stone rolled
[1:22:23] away. The tomb is empty. I've hear
[1:22:26] Cleopus tell a story and John believes
[1:22:29] it and I and Cleopus tells me about
[1:22:31] Jesus coming and talking to him and he
[1:22:33] had nail scarred hands and he began to
[1:22:34] break the bread just like he did. And
[1:22:36] all of a sudden, Jesus steps out, says,
[1:22:40] "Peter, the fourth time, Jesus shows
[1:22:43] himself to doubting believers." And he
[1:22:47] steps out there and he begins to tell
[1:22:48] them, "Now all of a sudden, the
[1:22:50] disciples are
[1:22:52] believers and they're apologizing to
[1:22:54] Cleopus, hey, we're so sorry that we
[1:22:57] didn't believe you. How could we not
[1:22:59] believe when we know what was about to
[1:23:01] happen? How could we not have believed
[1:23:03] that?" Let me ask you, how can you not
[1:23:06] believe for your healing when you're
[1:23:07] sick? How can you not believe for your
[1:23:09] children when they're running ragged?
[1:23:13] The word says ask.
[1:23:16] The word says to believe. The word says
[1:23:18] have faith and ye shall.
[1:23:24] Amen. Jesus appears to this small
[1:23:26] gathering and he's telling them all he's
[1:23:27] going to do. And they come in, they say,
[1:23:29] "Here, let's fix you some boiled fish
[1:23:31] and some honeycomb.
[1:23:34] And Jesus says, "You're starting to
[1:23:36] figure this out because spirits don't
[1:23:38] have flesh and spirits don't
[1:23:43] eat." So
[1:23:45] now there's
[1:23:47] Thomas. Poor Thomas. I tell you what,
[1:23:51] everybody gives Thomas a hard time, but
[1:23:53] let me tell you, after tonight, don't
[1:23:54] you ever give Thomas a hard time again.
[1:23:56] Because he wasn't the only doubter in
[1:23:58] the
[1:24:00] house. Amen.
[1:24:03] He may need a little more convincing.
[1:24:08] And here comes Thomas now. He wasn't
[1:24:11] with the rest of the followers. And so
[1:24:13] the followers now were telling him,
[1:24:14] "Hey, we saw the Lord. We saw the Lord
[1:24:18] and you ain't going to believe this."
[1:24:21] Ain't that something how we tell people
[1:24:22] what they ain't going to believe and we
[1:24:23] want them to believe
[1:24:27] it? You ain't going to believe this,
[1:24:30] Thomas. But we were
[1:24:32] walking. True
[1:24:36] story. And Thomas said, "Now that's
[1:24:38] that's a little far-fetched. That's a
[1:24:40] little hard to believe. And I'm going to
[1:24:42] have to see those nails in his hand and
[1:24:44] the the wound. I'm going to have to
[1:24:46] stick my hand in his side before I ever
[1:24:49] believe this far-fetched story you boys
[1:24:51] are telling. Let me go. You going to
[1:24:54] tell me next you caught a fish this this
[1:24:57] big? cuz y'all sure are stretching your
[1:25:00] imagination because this ain't
[1:25:03] happening. And you know what
[1:25:06] happens?
[1:25:08] But God is so mindful of our
[1:25:13] characters. Eight days
[1:25:17] later, not the same day, not the next
[1:25:19] day, eight days
[1:25:22] later, the apostles with Thomas are in a
[1:25:26] locked room.
[1:25:28] Let me say that again. They're in a
[1:25:30] locked
[1:25:31] room and they're having a little
[1:25:33] meeting, a little pow-wow, and all of a
[1:25:35] sudden it says the Lord stepped
[1:25:37] in. That's all the convincing I need
[1:25:40] right
[1:25:42] there. When somebody walks through walls
[1:25:44] and through doors that are locked,
[1:25:47] don't need to tell me nothing else.
[1:25:50] I believe.
[1:25:52] But here he is. He comes in there and he
[1:25:54] looks at him and he says, "Look at here,
[1:25:56] Thomas. put your finger right
[1:25:58] here and shove your hand right here in
[1:26:01] my side. And Thomas looks at him and he
[1:26:04] looks at him and he stops doubting and
[1:26:06] starts believing and he says, "My Lord,
[1:26:09] my God,
[1:26:12] it is true." Can you imagine the
[1:26:14] overwhelming joy that must have been in
[1:26:16] Thomas's heart to believe such a story?
[1:26:18] Now it's coming to pass. Oh my Lord, my
[1:26:20] God, here you stand before me.
[1:26:27] So, how is it, brothers and sisters,
[1:26:30] that we can have signs and wonders and
[1:26:32] revelation and revelation and revelation
[1:26:36] taking place and God showing us time
[1:26:38] after time after a time and we so many
[1:26:41] times still miss
[1:26:47] God. Huh?
[1:26:51] The prophet said he made his work so
[1:26:55] simple. So simple that anybody could
[1:26:58] understand it. God made himself so
[1:27:00] simple with the simple in order to be
[1:27:02] understood by the simple. He said in
[1:27:04] other words in Isaiah 35 I believe he
[1:27:07] said though a fool should not er
[1:27:10] therein. It's that
[1:27:12] simple. So it's God in simplicity. It's
[1:27:15] God in human. It's God in man. It's God
[1:27:18] in you. It's God in me. It's God that's
[1:27:20] sitting beside you. It's God in your
[1:27:22] neighbor. That's what we're talking
[1:27:24] about. And he begins to tell about this.
[1:27:26] And he begins to talk. He said, you
[1:27:28] know, God is so great till we expect
[1:27:30] some great something and we miss him in
[1:27:33] the simple things.
[1:27:40] We stumble over simplicity.
[1:27:45] Who would have
[1:27:48] thought? Who who would have thought it
[1:27:50] would have been your
[1:27:51] husband, your wife, your children, your
[1:28:04] neighbor. The death, burial, and
[1:28:06] resurrection wasn't hard to understand.
[1:28:08] It's pretty simple. Matthew talks about
[1:28:11] it two times. Mark talks about it three
[1:28:13] times and Luke mentions it several times
[1:28:15] and Jesus clearly tells them, "I'm going
[1:28:17] to I'm going to have to be put into the
[1:28:18] hands of those. They're going to condemn
[1:28:19] me. They're going to put me to death.
[1:28:21] I'm going to die. They're going to put
[1:28:22] me in a tomb. I'm going to resurrect."
[1:28:24] And at one point, they even look at it
[1:28:25] and they say they were exceedingly
[1:28:29] sorry. So, they believed the story,
[1:28:33] but they couldn't believe it when it
[1:28:35] happened.
[1:28:36] See, when the rubber meets the road, it
[1:28:38] didn't seem at all possible that a man
[1:28:40] could die, that he' be buried, be in a
[1:28:41] grave, and then walk out of that grave.
[1:28:43] I mean, come on. This is
[1:28:47] impossible.
[1:28:49] H I was talking about that word
[1:28:51] unbelievable. There was a a guy I heard
[1:28:54] he told a story he said about the word
[1:28:56] unbelievable. And he was just talking
[1:28:58] about the word unbelievable. He said
[1:29:00] it's a word that no Christian, nobody of
[1:29:02] faith should ever use.
[1:29:07] Unbelievable. Why do we use that word?
[1:29:10] Well, God healed her of cancer and it
[1:29:12] was just
[1:29:16] unbelievable.
[1:29:20] Really? You should have seen that guy.
[1:29:22] He was strung out on drugs and and and
[1:29:24] and this was going on and he was running
[1:29:27] here. He wasn't ser he was running with
[1:29:28] the devil. And all of a sudden, you
[1:29:30] wouldn't believe it. It's unbelievable
[1:29:32] what God done.
[1:29:40] H for 40 days after the resurrection,
[1:29:44] Jesus is on the scene and Jesus is is
[1:29:46] telling going from believer to believer
[1:29:48] to believer and he's saying, "Here I
[1:29:52] am. Here I am for 40 days. Here I am.
[1:29:55] It's me. I'm the resurrected one. I'm
[1:29:58] alive and alive forever more. Here I am
[1:30:02] for 40 days to groups as big as 500
[1:30:14] people. It was a negative
[1:30:17] atmosphere. If Jesus had to expose
[1:30:20] himself for 40 days to get people to
[1:30:24] believe, what kind of atmosphere was
[1:30:26] they living in?
[1:30:29] That's why we as believers, brothers and
[1:30:31] sisters, we got to be careful that in
[1:30:32] this atmosphere of negativity in the
[1:30:34] world we live in, a world full of hate,
[1:30:36] full of doubt, full of fear, full of
[1:30:39] anxieties, full of envies, full of
[1:30:42] strife, people would just assume to
[1:30:45] smack you to look at
[1:30:47] you, say the wrong thing, do the wrong
[1:30:49] thing, cut the wrong person off in the
[1:30:51] road
[1:30:54] accidentally. It may not be your best
[1:30:56] day.
[1:30:59] So we got to be careful that we don't
[1:31:00] forget the promises of God. And when I
[1:31:03] thought about that, I thought, what can
[1:31:04] we look back? How can we reflect in this
[1:31:06] world of negativity? What one scripture
[1:31:08] can I look to and say, this is the solid
[1:31:11] we can go to? Psalms
[1:31:13] 103. Psalms 103 says, "Bless the Lord,
[1:31:16] oh my soul, and forget not all of his
[1:31:18] benefits."
[1:31:20] It says, "Who forgiveth thine
[1:31:23] iniquities? Who health all thy diseases?
[1:31:25] Who redeemth thy life from destruction,
[1:31:27] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[1:31:29] and tender mercies, who satisfyth my
[1:31:31] mouth with good things, so that the
[1:31:33] young is renewed like eagles.
[1:31:39] We got to get to the meat of our story
[1:31:41] here. Can I have maybe 10 extra minutes
[1:31:45] tonight? Amen.
[1:31:47] The Bible tells us that he made this his
[1:31:49] ways known unto Moses and his acts unto
[1:31:52] the children of Israel. And we know the
[1:31:55] story that God and and and and back in
[1:31:57] that day when the children of Israel was
[1:31:58] trying to get out of Egypt, God moved in
[1:32:00] on the scene and God displayed himself
[1:32:02] as a as a savior in the act of applying
[1:32:05] the blood to the doorpost to the lentils
[1:32:08] and he's pushed the blood on with the
[1:32:10] hissip. What was that? It was God's
[1:32:12] token on display that when the death
[1:32:15] angel come through that the death angel
[1:32:17] couldn't touch them.
[1:32:19] And under that blood of that innocent
[1:32:21] lamb, there could come no harm. And what
[1:32:24] I like about that blood is once that
[1:32:26] blood was applied to the door, no matter
[1:32:29] what storms came, no matter how much
[1:32:31] rain fell or hail fell, there was
[1:32:33] nothing that could wash that blood off
[1:32:35] the lint of the door. Nothing could
[1:32:38] change who they were identified by. The
[1:32:41] token had been applied over them, over
[1:32:43] their household, and no firstborn should
[1:32:46] be harmed.
[1:32:49] That lamb's blood was the only thing
[1:32:51] they had as a token.
[1:32:54] But you know that same lamb's blood is
[1:32:56] not enough for the believer today.
[1:33:01] That's not enough for today. So for 40
[1:33:04] days of appearances, watch what Jesus
[1:33:06] does. 40 days he appears to the
[1:33:07] believers. For 40 days he's given
[1:33:10] instructions on what he do. And at the
[1:33:12] last time he's appears in 40 days he
[1:33:14] takes them to a place called
[1:33:17] Bethany. And he's getting ready to
[1:33:19] ascend out of here. But before he
[1:33:21] leaves, he says, "Listen, here's what
[1:33:22] you got to do." Now, I can bet these
[1:33:25] guys who were believing or doubting
[1:33:27] believers were now full-fledged
[1:33:29] believers. Tell me, Lord, what do we
[1:33:31] need to do?
[1:33:34] We've seen the miracles. We've seen the
[1:33:36] works. We've seen the goods. We've seen
[1:33:38] the death, burial, and resurrection. We
[1:33:40] know who you are. What do we have to do
[1:33:42] to get to where we need to be?
[1:33:46] He said, "Go and wait into the upper
[1:33:48] room
[1:33:55] until the Holy Spirit
[1:34:02] falls." Now, we're talking about
[1:34:04] something completely different than
[1:34:08] blood. Justification,
[1:34:10] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:34:12] Ghost.
[1:34:15] The prophet begins to tell us and he
[1:34:17] explains to us in the token message. He
[1:34:19] said the Holy Ghost is the token. Listen
[1:34:22] now. He said, "A man believes God."
[1:34:24] That's true enough. But the Holy Ghost
[1:34:26] is the gift of God. It's exactly
[1:34:30] something different than your faith.
[1:34:32] Your faith applies it. That's exactly
[1:34:34] right. But listen, I want you to catch
[1:34:36] this one sentence right here. The Holy
[1:34:39] Ghost is the witness.
[1:34:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:46] Let me ask you tonight, why could Mary
[1:34:50] and Johanna and Cleopus and the 11
[1:34:53] apostles, even Peter, why could they not
[1:34:56] see who Jesus was after the
[1:35:00] resurrection? What did he say? The Holy
[1:35:03] Ghost is the
[1:35:06] witness. They knew the
[1:35:09] stories. They saw the miracles. They saw
[1:35:12] they saw the things take place. They saw
[1:35:15] uh the very signs of the Messiah on
[1:35:17] display. They were there the day that
[1:35:19] they crammed and shoved the the crown of
[1:35:21] thorns upon his head. They were there
[1:35:23] and saw the blood run down his
[1:35:25] face. They were there the very day that
[1:35:28] they saw the blood sling from the cat of
[1:35:30] nine tales as he took 39 lashes on his
[1:35:35] back. They stood there that very day.
[1:35:37] They watched as they hammered the nails
[1:35:40] and heard the ping ping ping as the
[1:35:43] nails were driven in his hand. And they
[1:35:45] watched as the blood ran down his naked
[1:35:48] body and pulled at the foot of the
[1:35:52] cross. But still they had no Holy
[1:35:59] Ghost. You see how much God loves us in
[1:36:02] the age we live in. So he says, "Go and
[1:36:05] wait in this upper room. Stay right
[1:36:07] there because the Holy Ghost is the
[1:36:09] witness and we're going to need that
[1:36:10] Holy Ghost. Brothers and sisters, we
[1:36:12] have to have the Holy Ghost in this
[1:36:14] hour.
[1:36:21] He said, notice they didn't come just
[1:36:22] together to talk about
[1:36:24] it. They they didn't come together just
[1:36:27] to talk about it and say, "Oh, we
[1:36:30] believe." We can't be guilty of that on
[1:36:32] Sunday morning either. that we just come
[1:36:34] and we occupy a pew and we come in and
[1:36:36] we sit in the same spot every Sunday.
[1:36:39] Every Sunday we sit in the same spot. We
[1:36:42] do this, we do that. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:44] The preacher, we're out the door. We
[1:36:46] believe. We're believers. We're here.
[1:36:48] We're believers. God sent a
[1:36:53] prophet. He said, they didn't come and
[1:36:55] just say, "We believe." He said, "Oh,
[1:36:57] no. They believed it, but they had come
[1:36:59] to apply the blood that the token might
[1:37:01] be seen underneath it. You see, we got
[1:37:05] to have the token in this hour. He said
[1:37:07] the new testament means new covenant.
[1:37:09] The blood life, the blood life itself is
[1:37:12] the token. The life out of the blood is
[1:37:14] the token. Remember, it is the life from
[1:37:18] the blood that's in that person for the
[1:37:22] token.
[1:37:24] Yeah.
[1:37:25] That's why they had to have whatever
[1:37:27] they were on the day of Pentecost.
[1:37:28] That's why on the day of Pentecost, they
[1:37:30] sat there and they waited for the spirit
[1:37:32] to fall. It wasn't about speaking in
[1:37:34] tonesues. The Pentecostals have that all
[1:37:37] wrong. I hate to tell them. You might
[1:37:40] speak in tonesues. You might interpret
[1:37:41] tones. You might run. You might dance.
[1:37:43] You might shout. We love it all. I love
[1:37:45] it all. I wish I could do more of it.
[1:37:48] God help me. But that's not what God was
[1:37:51] doing. God was taking and he was
[1:37:53] manifesting himself in a lick of fire
[1:37:56] and a fire was falling and a lick of
[1:37:58] fire went to this person and that person
[1:38:00] and this person and that lick of fire
[1:38:02] was no other than the life of Jesus
[1:38:04] Christ falling on the inside of the
[1:38:07] believer.
[1:38:09] That's the token he's talking about.
[1:38:13] You see, there's a lot of people that
[1:38:15] have the blood. There's a lot of people
[1:38:17] that claim the blood. There's a lot of
[1:38:20] people that that that go before Jesus
[1:38:22] and say, "He's my savior." And they live
[1:38:24] any way they want to
[1:38:26] live. I can't do it. I can't do it.
[1:38:31] Something on the inside of me says, "You
[1:38:33] can't live that way and claim to be what
[1:38:35] you are." You know you done wrong. Fix
[1:38:38] it.
[1:38:42] Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:45] Brother Brandham said when Egypt, and
[1:38:47] I'm closing, he said when when they were
[1:38:48] in Egypt, when Israel was in Egypt, he
[1:38:50] said they is the the the children of
[1:38:52] Israel were a called out country out of
[1:38:55] a calledout
[1:38:56] country. They were a called out country
[1:38:59] out of a country. And he said, "The
[1:39:00] bride is the same way. She's a church
[1:39:02] that's called out of a church."
[1:39:06] One church has the
[1:39:07] blood. They can preach Jesus better than
[1:39:10] anything you've ever heard.
[1:39:13] They can preach that blood. They can
[1:39:16] preach that resurrection. They can
[1:39:17] preach
[1:39:19] forgiveness. But they can't preach a
[1:39:21] life
[1:39:26] that's hard to
[1:39:28] swallow. But it's a life lived. That's
[1:39:31] the token. It's God on the inside.
[1:39:34] That's the token. Look at this. Let me
[1:39:36] get back to this here. His life produved
[1:39:40] his credentials. What he was. That's
[1:39:41] what God wants us to be. Wants our life
[1:39:44] to be our credentials.
[1:39:50] In closing here, I was reading a story.
[1:39:52] I was watching an interview actually
[1:39:55] with Morgan Freeman. Everybody know who
[1:39:56] Morgan, some of you know who Morgan
[1:39:58] Freeman is.
[1:40:01] If you don't know, he's an
[1:40:03] actor. He's well known for his voice. He
[1:40:06] has a very distinct voice. He's a lot of
[1:40:08] times used to play the voice of God.
[1:40:12] and he has a very distinct voice. But
[1:40:15] Morgan Freeman is a he he's an
[1:40:19] agnostic. You know, an agnostic is a
[1:40:21] person who neither has faith nor
[1:40:24] disbelief in God. So, they don't really
[1:40:26] believe in God. They don't really
[1:40:27] disbelieve. They just believe that
[1:40:29] things just
[1:40:30] are. His religion he actually follows is
[1:40:33] I'm gonna try to pronounce this. Who
[1:40:35] knows where they got it. Zoroastrianism.
[1:40:40] Okay, that's his belief system. His
[1:40:43] belief is good thoughts, good works,
[1:40:45] good deeds. That pretty much sums it
[1:40:48] up. But I was watching an interview with
[1:40:50] him because he's a real interesting
[1:40:55] character. Has anybody ever heard him?
[1:40:58] Okay. I thought I was the only
[1:41:01] one. Thought, man, I got to do some
[1:41:04] repenting.
[1:41:09] But he's a very interesting fella as you
[1:41:11] listen to him and and you listen to the
[1:41:14] interview and he's got that distinct
[1:41:16] voice and they begin to ask him
[1:41:17] questions. You know, he's that guy that
[1:41:19] when you ask him a question, he answers
[1:41:21] your question with a
[1:41:23] question. So, you never really know what
[1:41:25] he's thinking, but he's interesting. He
[1:41:28] says statements, he makes comments that
[1:41:29] make you just go,
[1:41:32] "Hm." And they ask him the
[1:41:35] question. They said, "Religious? Are you
[1:41:38] religious? Do you believe in something,
[1:41:41] anything?" He replied, "Yeah, I believe
[1:41:45] in
[1:41:46] me." And I
[1:41:49] thought, "Be careful
[1:41:52] there." And the interviewer said, "Oh,
[1:41:54] okay." And she kind of chuckled and she
[1:41:56] said, "But don't you believe in anything
[1:41:58] else as in God or there's something like
[1:42:00] that?" And his answer was really amazing
[1:42:03] to me. Take it for what it's worth.
[1:42:05] penny for your thoughts. He said, "You
[1:42:08] can separate God from
[1:42:11] religion." He said, "Which is what I
[1:42:13] do?" You know, I thought about that. I
[1:42:16] thought, "There's a lot of people who
[1:42:17] make God religion.
[1:42:20] They're
[1:42:22] religious." And he said, "You can
[1:42:24] separate God from religion, which is
[1:42:26] what I do. I believe in God. I believe
[1:42:29] in
[1:42:30] me." Same person.
[1:42:38] I believe in God. I believe in me. Same
[1:42:45] person. I got to thinking, hm, he ain't
[1:42:49] too far
[1:42:51] off. Because it's God on the
[1:42:54] inside. It's God on the inside that
[1:42:57] moves us and makes us and molds us into
[1:42:59] what we are to
[1:43:01] be. You say, "Man, I got to have a quote
[1:43:03] for that." You getting you getting out
[1:43:04] there now. Oh, well, a good thing I've
[1:43:06] made a copy. Let me find it
[1:43:08] here. Oh, don't you ever lose that. If
[1:43:11] you lose that to a place to where you
[1:43:12] get ashamed to go into a relationship
[1:43:14] with
[1:43:15] Christ, let him dwell in
[1:43:19] you, God in man. Amen.
[1:43:25] Making himself known to the people by
[1:43:27] his spirit, a royal ple priesthood, a
[1:43:30] holy nation, a peculiar people, odd,
[1:43:32] different from the world, sanctified by
[1:43:34] the blood, and set aside from the things
[1:43:36] of this world. I believe in God. I
[1:43:39] believe in me. Same person. Let's
[1:43:46] stand. Like I said, don't take Morgan
[1:43:49] Freeman as the gospel. It's just an
[1:43:51] illustration.
[1:43:53] He may he may use his voice as God, but
[1:43:55] he sure ain't God.
[1:43:57] Okay. Let's keep it
[1:44:02] separate. You love the Lord tonight.
[1:44:05] Aren't you thankful for a blood that was
[1:44:07] shed on Calvary and more important the
[1:44:08] token the life of Jesus that was that
[1:44:11] was come back on the day of Pentecost to
[1:44:12] the believers and it still falls on the
[1:44:14] believers today? All you got to do is
[1:44:16] accept it. All you got to do is accept.
[1:44:18] You say, "I need the Holy Ghost." Just
[1:44:19] accept it. He's there for you. Open up
[1:44:21] your heart. Live a clean life. Do the
[1:44:23] best you can do. And just keep saying,
[1:44:25] "God, fill me with more. Fill me with
[1:44:27] more. Fill me with
[1:44:31] more." The blood that Jesus shed on
[1:44:34] Calvary will never lose its power.
[1:44:36] Sister
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:39] Becky, let's just pray if we could.
[1:44:41] Heavenly
[1:44:42] Father, we thank you, Lord, for this
[1:44:44] day, for this service you've given us.
[1:44:46] We thank you for your presence.
[1:44:48] We certainly trust that needs were met,
[1:44:51] desires were fulfilled, hearts are grown
[1:44:54] closer to you. Lord, if there was
[1:44:56] anybody that was unsure or questioning
[1:44:58] their walk or their stand with you, I
[1:44:59] hope that it's it's a firmer
[1:45:01] relationship from this moment on. Lord,
[1:45:04] we love you with all of our hearts. We
[1:45:05] ask that you go with us. Keep us into
[1:45:08] that positive atmosphere of the Holy
[1:45:10] Ghost. That the token would be applied
[1:45:12] to our lives and all that we do. That we
[1:45:14] don't have to fall away. We don't have
[1:45:15] to we don't have to accept things that
[1:45:17] are handed to us, sicknesses and and
[1:45:19] doubts and unbeliefs. We don't have to
[1:45:21] hand have that because the prophet said
[1:45:23] the token overshadows those
[1:45:26] things. So we there's so much that can
[1:45:28] be said about that token that Lord I
[1:45:30] just couldn't cover tonight. But we
[1:45:32] trust Lord that that it would sink deep
[1:45:34] into the heart that we don't have to
[1:45:36] accept anything Satan puts upon us if
[1:45:40] the token is applied. The token is a
[1:45:43] sign that the price has been paid. the
[1:45:44] debt is paid in full, that that we are
[1:45:46] free in this life we live, and that that
[1:45:49] blood never loses its power. And we
[1:45:53] thank you for it,
[1:45:55] Lord, in Jesus name. The
[1:45:59] blood that
[1:46:02] Jesus
[1:46:05] shed for
[1:46:10] me way back on
[1:46:14] [Laughter]
[1:46:17] Calary. It's the
[1:46:19] blood that gives me
[1:46:23] strength from
[1:46:25] day to day.
[1:46:28] It will
[1:46:31] never
[1:46:33] lose its
