[52:18] blessing to the reading of the words you
[52:19] can be seated tonight
[52:21] amen
[52:23] sunday i focused on a little bit on how
[52:25] that the christians desire something
[52:28] that is eternal something that lasts
[52:31] right
[52:32] so tonight we want to talk a little bit
[52:34] for a little while with the help of the
[52:36] lord about surety i mean i'm something
[52:38] that is sure and when i think about that
[52:40] word sure the more i think about it the
[52:43] better i like it i mean i believe it's
[52:45] the prophet of god that said that he
[52:46] liked that
[52:47] word perseverant real well but i like
[52:49] this word sure also
[52:52] because this word here really only
[52:54] belongs to one person
[52:58] are you ready
[53:00] this word sure is only belongs to one
[53:04] person and that is god
[53:07] amen
[53:09] because
[53:10] there is nothing else that's sure
[53:13] right
[53:15] amen heaven and earth will pass away
[53:17] it's not sure there's so many things
[53:18] tonight that's not sure
[53:21] amen
[53:22] uh to me it it illustrates something
[53:25] that's going to be or it's an absolute
[53:29] amen
[53:31] and i believe god used it uh you know
[53:34] or should i say satan used it in eve
[53:38] in in the garden of eden with eve when
[53:40] he said when he was changing the word of
[53:42] god and
[53:44] and he twisted the word uh you know and
[53:46] he says when god said that you are going
[53:48] to die if you eat of it
[53:51] but the serpent said you are not surely
[53:54] going to die
[53:55] he took something that was sure and made
[53:58] it unsure
[54:00] isn't that right
[54:01] he twisted it he said not surely
[54:05] because you know what surely is
[54:07] it's gonna be
[54:09] ain't no changing it
[54:11] it's absolute
[54:13] amen
[54:15] i mean no the word of god is sure
[54:18] if you're not tied to this sure
[54:21] you're not going to be sure
[54:25] and we have a lot of unsurety in the
[54:27] world today don't we
[54:30] a lot of in unsurety i was just thinking
[54:33] and meditating on this and i was
[54:35] thinking about how that
[54:37] the times that you are and i are living
[54:40] in are really unsure times
[54:43] it reminded me of uh scripture i believe
[54:45] in the old testament somewhere talk
[54:47] about how israelis said they were
[54:48] supposed to stay close to the ark
[54:51] because they hadn't passed this way
[54:53] before
[54:55] and i got to thinking about how you and
[54:56] i for the most part of our lives we've
[54:59] had pretty normal lives
[55:01] but in the last five years we have seen
[55:04] a major changes take place
[55:08] and every
[55:09] almost weekly something changes right
[55:12] and it's changing really really rapidly
[55:17] amen you know and uh uh what is it they
[55:20] call it the uh you know things are just
[55:23] falling apart eroding
[55:25] you know they talk about the erosion of
[55:27] the constitution the erosion of law the
[55:30] erosion of morality erode everything's
[55:32] eroding and not only roading but it's
[55:35] shaking
[55:37] how many believe we're living in shaking
[55:39] times
[55:41] amen
[55:44] we're living in shaking times and god
[55:46] said that everything that can be shaken
[55:50] will be shaken
[55:52] amen and only god's word is going to
[55:56] remain and to be sure
[55:58] and so we look at that and i thought i
[56:01] would begin to think how we haven't
[56:02] really went this way before
[56:07] amen
[56:09] and and and but you know the other
[56:11] thought that i had there was i like the
[56:13] second thought that came to my mind are
[56:15] you ready
[56:17] all right the second thought that came
[56:18] to mind you and i personally perhaps
[56:21] haven't went this way before but god has
[56:26] god has been here
[56:28] multiple times
[56:31] isn't that right
[56:33] amen
[56:34] ends what i'm talking about is the ends
[56:36] of civilizations
[56:38] or
[56:39] kingdoms
[56:41] he has seen the fries and the fall of
[56:44] many of them
[56:45] and especially in the days of noah when
[56:48] he seen the end of all humanity coming
[56:51] right
[56:53] he seen the end of all humanity coming
[56:58] and you know those people those people
[57:00] were just sure that it wasn't going to
[57:02] rain
[57:05] i mean they gambled their lives upon it
[57:07] didn't they
[57:09] they gambled their lives upon it but the
[57:12] good part about it is is we haven't went
[57:14] into on these shaky grounds knowing that
[57:17] it's going to get more shaky
[57:20] it's going to get worse
[57:25] all the way to the way i see it as a
[57:27] minister the way that it's going to get
[57:29] all the way worse until it comes down to
[57:33] the boy caught you
[57:35] or to put a squeeze on your finances
[57:38] your finances unless you don't come the
[57:41] way they want you to come
[57:45] mark of the beast that's that right
[57:46] that's according to descriptions the way
[57:48] that the prophet taught it that's where
[57:50] how bad it's gonna get
[57:52] amen and so you'll find out that it's
[57:55] it's a shaking time and i also kind of
[57:57] compared it in my mind
[58:00] with california
[58:03] and the prophecy the sure prophecy that
[58:05] we have thus saith the lord california
[58:08] going to see los angeles going to sink
[58:10] right
[58:11] amen and how many times we as message
[58:14] believers have talked about i wouldn't
[58:16] want to live in california
[58:22] right
[58:23] who wants to live in california knowing
[58:25] it's going to go down
[58:26] yeah and so we wouldn't want to live
[58:28] there because we know it's going to go
[58:30] down
[58:33] and you know you can just imagine this
[58:36] now
[58:37] how that perhaps one of these days it'll
[58:39] rock it'll shake it'll crack off and
[58:41] it'll crumble the sky rises everything
[58:43] will go down and perhaps the place some
[58:45] of the planes will just be leaving as
[58:47] the ground crumbles under him
[58:51] and imagine yourself there
[58:54] imagine yourself there and there's a
[58:57] plane leaving in five minutes and this
[58:59] whole place is gonna be a swamp with
[59:01] water in about ten so load and get on
[59:03] board
[59:06] would you hurt yourself getting on board
[59:08] you probably heard the next guy treat
[59:10] you getting on board but
[59:12] yeah you'd want to make sure you got on
[59:14] board anything and how good it would
[59:17] feel
[59:18] to get your feet off the ground and
[59:20] knowing that you're not going to go down
[59:22] with it
[59:24] right
[59:26] now how many knows even brother bam says
[59:28] you know that in the under the sixth
[59:30] seal the volcanoes will go up and this
[59:32] place will shake and it'll be turned
[59:34] inside out and everything all of this
[59:37] the whole world is doomed for such a
[59:39] scenario
[59:41] amen
[59:44] and how many knows it's sure to happen
[59:47] it is going to happen
[59:50] now unfortunately i'm here to tell you
[59:53] that even though you wouldn't live in
[59:54] california but i'm talking about how
[59:56] those nukes and everything could be up
[59:58] in the air in the next five minutes
[1:00:01] we have no promise of tomorrow why
[1:00:03] because this earth is doomed it's
[1:00:05] prophesied to go down
[1:00:11] and in hebrews it says that we have fled
[1:00:16] for
[1:00:17] refuge
[1:00:20] huh
[1:00:21] let me know i don't know about you but i
[1:00:23] care about my life
[1:00:27] i hope you care about your life and i
[1:00:30] have fled for refuge
[1:00:32] i don't care if it would be a helicopter
[1:00:34] i don't care if i'd have to time myself
[1:00:36] to erupt to something just get me out
[1:00:38] this rock that's going down
[1:00:40] well that's the way it is spiritually
[1:00:42] whatever it takes lord i don't want to
[1:00:44] go down with this thing
[1:00:48] i don't want to be left here in the
[1:00:49] tribulation period
[1:00:53] huh
[1:00:54] because i'm afraid too many
[1:00:56] melancholy christians
[1:00:59] are going to find themselves in this
[1:01:01] tribulation period
[1:01:03] they're going to tell themselves you
[1:01:04] know i just didn't take it serious
[1:01:06] enough
[1:01:10] huh
[1:01:12] but how many knows the christians
[1:01:14] god's gonna do something to the real
[1:01:15] christian he's gonna have you
[1:01:18] be ready
[1:01:20] amen we're gonna take wednesday nights
[1:01:21] we're gonna take some we're gonna take
[1:01:22] monday tuesday wednesday amen whatever
[1:01:24] it takes we're gonna be ready to leave
[1:01:26] this place because we don't wanna be
[1:01:29] lacks a day's ego we don't wanna be here
[1:01:32] when all of that happens because it's
[1:01:33] sure to happen
[1:01:36] amen and we've laid fled for refuge to
[1:01:40] lay holes huh
[1:01:43] to lay a hold on something
[1:01:46] the hope that is set before us
[1:01:49] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:01:52] soul
[1:01:53] is sure
[1:01:55] i like that
[1:01:57] in a world of uncertainty in a future
[1:02:00] that is certainly uncertain
[1:02:03] i'm sure
[1:02:05] you can have
[1:02:07] surety you can be
[1:02:08] sure
[1:02:11] amen aren't you glad for that that you
[1:02:13] can be sure
[1:02:15] god wants us to be sure
[1:02:17] he said we have laid half as an anchor
[1:02:20] on our show it's both sure
[1:02:23] and i like the other word to use
[1:02:25] steadfast
[1:02:28] amen steadfast it holds
[1:02:32] amen just like that boat brother brown
[1:02:34] says when he was coming in on an
[1:02:35] airplane they seen that big old ship out
[1:02:37] there in the ocean and it was so
[1:02:40] horribly rough it looked like it was
[1:02:41] going to sink
[1:02:43] but somebody on the on beside him says
[1:02:46] no it's not going to sink because it has
[1:02:47] a sea anchor and it's gripping that rock
[1:02:51] amen and as long as it just has a hole
[1:02:53] in the rock he can't go sideways and
[1:02:55] capsize it's going to go right through
[1:02:57] it the waves will come over and around
[1:02:59] it but it's
[1:03:00] it's gonna make it
[1:03:03] that's the way a christian is we have an
[1:03:05] anchor that's both sure and steadfast
[1:03:08] and if you aren't anchored to christ
[1:03:11] and i thought about this because how
[1:03:13] many knows the revelation of jesus
[1:03:15] christ is the rock
[1:03:17] huh
[1:03:18] it's not this word is the rock but if
[1:03:21] you're not anchored to that rock
[1:03:23] the right don't do you any good
[1:03:26] and a revelation or a personal
[1:03:28] relationship and walk with almighty god
[1:03:30] experience with almighty god young
[1:03:32] people it's the only thing that's going
[1:03:33] to hold you
[1:03:37] everybody else drifts off
[1:03:40] drifts off
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:44] i hope to if i have time tonight to
[1:03:47] bring it down to a personal base
[1:03:49] personal basis on this
[1:03:52] amen both sure
[1:03:55] my
[1:03:57] my
[1:03:58] my
[1:04:01] if you want to
[1:04:02] even
[1:04:03] begin to imagine how unsure and shifting
[1:04:06] things are
[1:04:08] go out there and try to find a decent
[1:04:10] looking human being anymore
[1:04:13] everybody's got nose okay folks nose
[1:04:15] rings and earrings tattoos everywhere
[1:04:17] and
[1:04:18] dress every old way it's just a terrible
[1:04:20] world it's getting worse all the time
[1:04:22] huh
[1:04:24] we need an anchor we need something
[1:04:26] that's sure it's just drifting the whole
[1:04:28] world has drifted and it's drifting
[1:04:30] faster and faster people drift
[1:04:34] we drift
[1:04:35] i drift
[1:04:38] huh
[1:04:39] well get into don't don't let me forget
[1:04:41] i want to really get into this because
[1:04:42] we want to get down to where it it it is
[1:04:44] part of us paul talked the good that
[1:04:46] they would that i do not and so forth
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:50] this body here it wants to shift all the
[1:04:52] time
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:55] but i looked at this
[1:04:57] and we find out that
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:01] piloting them they thought they could
[1:05:03] make it sure
[1:05:05] huh
[1:05:06] they thought that they could put us some
[1:05:08] some of their good soldiers there and
[1:05:10] we're gonna make absolutely sure that he
[1:05:12] don't come up out of there
[1:05:16] huh
[1:05:18] but like i said there's only one real
[1:05:20] sure
[1:05:22] and it's not man man can't say sure
[1:05:24] huh
[1:05:25] nebuchadnezzar and baldi's hazer the
[1:05:28] greatest kingdom of all they thought
[1:05:29] they were secure
[1:05:31] huh
[1:05:32] they thought they were sure
[1:05:34] but they weren't were they
[1:05:36] no right at the very time that they were
[1:05:38] doing all that the enemy was going way
[1:05:40] down the river of the river and
[1:05:42] diverting the river so they could go
[1:05:44] right under the gates and then come in
[1:05:46] right through there through the dry
[1:05:48] river
[1:05:49] bed amen
[1:05:50] and they did
[1:05:52] didn't talk about america and when any
[1:05:54] country it begins to think that they're
[1:05:56] secure how did they let down and to go
[1:05:59] into sin
[1:06:01] huh
[1:06:04] we think we have nukes
[1:06:07] huh
[1:06:10] my
[1:06:12] doesn't make you secure one bit
[1:06:14] does it
[1:06:15] know your your capabilities your your
[1:06:18] powers and so forth no it's got nothing
[1:06:21] to do with security nothing to do with
[1:06:23] being sure
[1:06:24] the only surety is it's god
[1:06:28] amen
[1:06:30] let me tell you when god begins to die
[1:06:31] like that when god begins to do
[1:06:33] something
[1:06:35] ain't enough devils in hell to ever stop
[1:06:37] it
[1:06:39] amen
[1:06:41] praise be to god
[1:06:43] i'm so thankful tonight to have a place
[1:06:46] that you can be sure about how many
[1:06:49] notes god said malachi 4 jesus christ
[1:06:51] himself come down and absolutely time
[1:06:55] after time made himself known to the
[1:06:57] people
[1:06:58] that he's alive well so that you could
[1:07:00] be what
[1:07:02] sure
[1:07:03] that you could know that you know that
[1:07:05] you know

[1:07:11] very sure
[1:07:13] because this is an hour then you've got
[1:07:15] to be very sure now god is sure
[1:07:18] but do you realize that god wants not
[1:07:20] just himself to be sure
[1:07:22] he wants you to be sure
[1:07:29] let me uh kind of get off the side here
[1:07:31] for a minute daniel this just has one
[1:07:33] more quote on surety
[1:07:35] daniel the second chapter
[1:07:37] you remember the vision that
[1:07:39] nebuchadnezzar had of the golden head
[1:07:41] and of the person and so forth and uh
[1:07:44] you know all the way down to the co pose
[1:07:45] and so forth i'll make this quick 2 and
[1:07:48] 45
[1:07:52] 43
[1:07:54] and whereas thou saw's iron mixed with
[1:07:56] myery clay

[1:07:59] what was iron kushchev
[1:08:01] [Music]
[1:08:03] or was chris jeff clay and eisenhower
[1:08:05] was iron and then what the prophet
[1:08:08] yeah the prophet of god said when when
[1:08:10] uh i believe it was christian he grabbed
[1:08:13] his shoe and
[1:08:14] hit the table with it to get everybody's
[1:08:16] attention at a big meeting they had
[1:08:19] it signified they were down by those
[1:08:21] toes that he talked about the kingdoms
[1:08:23] and so forth
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:26] and
[1:08:26] all right all the way down when daniel
[1:08:29] saw
[1:08:30] the whole future
[1:08:32] of all of humanity right he saw
[1:08:35] everything that there was going to be
[1:08:37] all the way down to a kush chef and i i
[1:08:40] is an hour
[1:08:42] and they shall mingle themselves with
[1:08:44] the seed of men but they shall not
[1:08:45] cleave one to another have you ever
[1:08:47] noticed how do we just can't get along
[1:08:51] huh trump even tried

[1:09:06] able to cleave one to another as iron
[1:09:07] does not mix with clay and in the days
[1:09:09] of the king shall the god of heaven set
[1:09:11] up a kingdom we shall never be destroyed
[1:09:16] and the kingdom shall not be left to
[1:09:18] other people but it shall break to
[1:09:20] pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[1:09:23] and it shall stand forever
[1:09:28] see folks this is where you read between
[1:09:30] the lines
[1:09:32] and realize that you are part of that
[1:09:34] kingdom that shall never be destroyed

[1:09:39] that's right this kingdom it could never
[1:09:42] end
[1:09:44] i mean if we're in the kingdom of god
[1:09:46] right now it'll never end
[1:09:49] and it is going to break to pieces and
[1:09:52] consume
[1:09:54] all these other kingdoms
[1:09:57] for as much as thou saw as the stone
[1:09:59] that was cut out of the mountain
[1:10:01] without hands and that it break in
[1:10:04] pieces the iron the brass the clay the
[1:10:06] silver the gold the great god
[1:10:09] has made known to the king what shall
[1:10:11] come to pass here after
[1:10:13] the dream is certain and the
[1:10:16] interpretation thereof is sure
[1:10:20] amen
[1:10:22] and i remember over there in hebrews it
[1:10:23] says we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:10:27] shaken
[1:10:32] how many knows the devil tries to get
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:34] he tries to shake us
[1:10:37] let me tell you something this
[1:10:39] anything outside of a genuine new birth
[1:10:42] can be shaken
[1:10:44] but a real genuine new birth holy ghost
[1:10:48] experience faith in almighty god it
[1:10:51] cannot be shaken
[1:10:53] jesus says any man it comes to me will
[1:10:56] you know no man can pluck him out of my
[1:10:59] hands isn't that right
[1:11:01] i'm not a loser one of them he said
[1:11:04] amen i'm thankful for that
[1:11:08] so he's sure this is
[1:11:10] sure amen
[1:11:15] let me see
[1:11:19] i'm trying to find that place
[1:11:21] where it talks about well it shall break
[1:11:23] them to pieces and consume all the
[1:11:25] others i thought it talked about
[1:11:27] grinding them to powder in other words
[1:11:29] it's not going to be nothing but ashes
[1:11:31] left of all of these kingdoms
[1:11:34] amen that's not very sure
[1:11:36] not very
[1:11:37] that's not something solid i mean but
[1:11:39] it's the truth
[1:11:40] amen

[1:12:26] this way you know when we have confessed
[1:12:28] our sins and met every requirement that
[1:12:30] god requires
[1:12:33] he says and we've confessed to it all
[1:12:35] and we've made all wrongs right
[1:12:37] everything we know of done everything
[1:12:39] that we know to do every requirement
[1:12:41] that god has made
[1:12:42] we've met every requirement yet
[1:12:44] sometimes he lays still and he don't
[1:12:47] answer us
[1:12:50] now this is god working on you and me as
[1:12:52] an individual
[1:12:59] he says and i'm sure that i'm speaking
[1:13:00] to peoples this morning who's come to
[1:13:02] that place we can all say amen probably
[1:13:05] i've been there many times myself when
[1:13:08] i've trade things back in my life turned
[1:13:10] over every stone
[1:13:11] try to make everything right amen but
[1:13:13] yet he says i have met it and still he
[1:13:15] won't move seems like he's silent
[1:13:18] that's when you have to be sure that
[1:13:21] he's god
[1:13:25] don't be discouraged the only thing is
[1:13:27] that in your heart you are certain that
[1:13:30] he ends
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:36] my
[1:13:38] you know sometimes we think well
[1:13:40] this happens to me because i did this or
[1:13:42] i did that or the other
[1:13:44] no not always
[1:13:47] amen not always how many remembers jesus
[1:13:50] said i'm jesus out in the old testament
[1:13:53] jehovah of the old testament became
[1:13:54] jesus of the new
[1:13:56] so he said you know to the devil about
[1:13:58] job he says he's the most perfect and
[1:13:59] upright man in the land
[1:14:03] he was a godly man
[1:14:05] he feared god
[1:14:06] he made sure that every sacrifice was
[1:14:08] made the sins of his children covered
[1:14:11] his sin skill covered everything was
[1:14:13] covered
[1:14:14] and then all of a sudden everything that
[1:14:16] could happen did
[1:14:19] i mean things went really bad all of his
[1:14:22] riches
[1:14:24] vanished in one day a bunch of thieves
[1:14:27] and robbers
[1:14:29] huh
[1:14:31] oh
[1:14:32] my
[1:14:34] i have no i've never learned this as an
[1:14:36] amish boy
[1:14:37] you won't learn it as a mennonite or a
[1:14:39] baptist or harder to anybody out there
[1:14:42] but if you'll notice before any of these
[1:14:44] things happened
[1:14:45] somebody got permission didn't they
[1:14:49] yeah they had to have permission
[1:14:51] because he says it you know
[1:14:53] the devil said to god yeah you know he
[1:14:56] don't serve you for naught you know he
[1:14:57] you've got your heads around him but let
[1:14:59] this happen to you let that happen to
[1:15:01] him and he'll curse you to your face
[1:15:04] and then god says go ahead
[1:15:07] he had to give him the good just don't
[1:15:10] touch his life and so forth isn't that
[1:15:12] right he had to give him the permission
[1:15:13] he had to take the hedge down
[1:15:16] amen to a perfect and upright man he
[1:15:19] believed god
[1:15:22] and now this happens
[1:15:24] his whole financial world comes down
[1:15:26] and not only that folks it wasn't just
[1:15:29] his financial world that was destroyed
[1:15:32] his family was destroyed
[1:15:35] now folks if the first one you can pass
[1:15:37] with i can maybe get by with that but
[1:15:39] when it's your family
[1:15:41] when it's your sons
[1:15:42] and your daughters that you've raised
[1:15:46] i wonder where we would stand huh
[1:15:49] folks it'd be real hard i believe it was
[1:15:52] nine of them
[1:15:54] isn't that right the house fell in on it
[1:15:57] he allowed the devil to get into the
[1:15:59] wind and make a tornado and go and knock
[1:16:00] that house down kill him
[1:16:02] huh
[1:16:04] that had to be real hard
[1:16:08] but what was god doing
[1:16:11] amen making job and testing his faith
[1:16:16] trying him
[1:16:17] seeing if he was really
[1:16:20] sure
[1:16:22] amen i believe god does that to you and
[1:16:24] me
[1:16:26] he wants you he wants to make sure that
[1:16:29] you are really sure
[1:16:34] and that sure has to do with faith
[1:16:36] because that's the only thing that's
[1:16:37] sure
[1:16:38] amen faith is the only thing that'll
[1:16:41] really hold on
[1:16:42] real genuine faith
[1:16:45] it don't let go
[1:16:47] no matter what the circumstances are
[1:16:50] amen
[1:16:53] amen don't be discouraged
[1:16:56] oh my
[1:17:00] listen so he says if you're certain of
[1:17:03] god you're sure that he's god that's
[1:17:05] when faith goes to work right there
[1:17:07] faith stands
[1:17:09] steady
[1:17:11] for it knows that he is
[1:17:13] you've met every requirement you believe
[1:17:15] that he is faith holds steady oh my
[1:17:18] blessed be his name faith won't move

[1:17:26] diligently seek him
[1:17:28] amen oh may this go way down and never
[1:17:32] move from you random tabernacle eating
[1:17:34] like tabernacle if you've met god's
[1:17:37] requirement and in your art you believe
[1:17:39] that he is
[1:17:40] he is only testing your faith
[1:17:46] amen
[1:17:49] my because you know and i know as well
[1:17:51] as any time that if you're ever gonna be
[1:17:54] unsure
[1:17:55] it's not on the mountaintops but it's
[1:17:57] done in the valleys
[1:17:59] it's down into hard times
[1:18:02] amen
[1:18:04] remember young people
[1:18:07] you've got it coming
[1:18:09] that test is coming to you
[1:18:12] that's what the prophet said he says
[1:18:14] every son that comes
[1:18:16] is tested to the ultimos
[1:18:19] you'll be tested on this
[1:18:21] and that what the teacher says now read
[1:18:23] that good because you're going gonna be
[1:18:25] tested on this
[1:18:27] you have a test on it
[1:18:29] you heard it tonight you're gonna be

[1:18:32] you're a child of god god is gonna find
[1:18:34] out whether you really believe it or not
[1:18:38] whether you're absolutely sure because
[1:18:41] if you're sure
[1:18:42] that means you've got your anchor
[1:18:45] that is sure the anchor that's in our
[1:18:48] heart how many believes it it's a sure
[1:18:50] anchor
[1:18:52] when it's gripped on the silent rock
[1:18:54] it's sure
[1:18:56] now if you're hooked on feelings if your
[1:18:58] anchors on feelings
[1:19:00] emotions
[1:19:01] or a mental understanding of the word
[1:19:05] you're going to be flung all over the
[1:19:07] place by these waves that come along
[1:19:09] these temptations that this age offers
[1:19:12] is going to throw you for a loop
[1:19:15] you'll never be able to resist against
[1:19:17] the temptations of this age outside of
[1:19:19] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:23] amen brother balor
[1:19:25] that's the truth you'll never resist
[1:19:27] these temptations the devil's got out
[1:19:29] there
[1:19:31] amen it's too strong
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:35] got to have the holy ghost and you've
[1:19:37] got to have that blessed assurance that

[1:19:43] glory divine
[1:19:45] make a way down listen
[1:19:48] i like this
[1:19:50] now he loves to test us he loves to see
[1:19:53] your reaction or the reaction of your
[1:19:56] faith
[1:20:01] oh man i've preached this a million
[1:20:02] times in this pulpit but i gotta say it
[1:20:04] again
[1:20:06] god loves to see what you do
[1:20:09] in extreme situations because what you
[1:20:12] do in extreme situations
[1:20:14] is what
[1:20:15] class i've taught you this many times
[1:20:17] what are you under pressure
[1:20:21] you are what you are
[1:20:23] under pressure it shows what you are
[1:20:26] it shows who you are
[1:20:29] amen how many knows
[1:20:31] we're defined by the decisions that we
[1:20:32] make
[1:20:33] i mean we are shown what we are by the
[1:20:35] decisions that we make
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:39] people know us by the choices that we
[1:20:41] make
[1:20:42] you know yourself
[1:20:44] by the choices you make
[1:20:47] amen and i don't know about you but i'd
[1:20:49] like to be able to jump from here to
[1:20:50] there to know that you don't always pass
[1:20:52] the test
[1:20:54] but if you're a child of god you'll get
[1:20:56] on your knees and say god i shouldn't
[1:20:57] have done that
[1:20:59] amen when you do that it shows your
[1:21:01] child of god
[1:21:02] but if you just walk away and hey i
[1:21:04] never did nothing wrong there's
[1:21:05] something serious wrong with that man
[1:21:07] there's something seriously wrong with
[1:21:08] that woman when they just walk away and
[1:21:10] never even see their own fault and
[1:21:12] mistakes and just think they're right
[1:21:13] anyway you are in the wrong direction
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:18] how many believes that god wants to make
[1:21:20] you sure
[1:21:21] he wants to make he wants us to be sure

[1:21:25] to be sure that you're sure as they say
[1:21:27] you gotta know that you know that you
[1:21:29] know
[1:21:32] amen
[1:21:34] praise the lord

[1:21:41] now job come on now
[1:21:43] somewhere in your life you got some
[1:21:46] secret sin
[1:21:49] huh
[1:21:50] god wouldn't punish a man like this if
[1:21:52] you didn't have some secrets in
[1:21:54] i've been told that before or heard that
[1:21:56] it was said about me
[1:21:59] gotta have some secrets in and i don't
[1:22:00] say i'm faultless
[1:22:02] not here to say i'm a joke and i'm
[1:22:03] perfect
[1:22:05] but i don't believe that's what it was
[1:22:06] all about
[1:22:08] i think i just had some really good
[1:22:10] friends
[1:22:11] like job did

[1:22:24] closet i've got i made the sacrifice i
[1:22:26] know that in my heart i'm right so don't
[1:22:28] give me that
[1:22:31] huh
[1:22:32] he didn't understand it
[1:22:34] because the first round wasn't enough
[1:22:36] losing his children his riches next time
[1:22:38] they met again the devil says you know
[1:22:40] god says look at him he's faithful yeah
[1:22:42] he is
[1:22:43] skin for skin but he says but you touch
[1:22:45] his body and he'll curse you and god
[1:22:47] said okay touch his body just don't take
[1:22:50] his life
[1:22:51] in other words you can take him all the
[1:22:52] way to where his heart beat goes down to
[1:22:54] maybe six seven eight times a minute i
[1:22:56] don't know but you just can't kill him
[1:23:00] he can't die under your hand and he
[1:23:02] won't die under your hand and he was so
[1:23:04] miserable
[1:23:06] oh my folks come on let's admit it
[1:23:10] being perhaps so sick and oh my i just
[1:23:12] want to die or you're just feeling so
[1:23:14] horrible i don't know that anybody any
[1:23:16] of us have ever come this close what
[1:23:19] job did and feeling completely miserable
[1:23:22] no no i don't believe we have
[1:23:25] because he had he had he had sores and
[1:23:27] and and he was so miserable
[1:23:30] he i for mother said he says why was i
[1:23:32] ever born and and god take the day away
[1:23:35] that i was ever born and oh my all kinds
[1:23:36] of things he said

[1:23:40] finally says man you're so miserable i i
[1:23:43] love you honey i just want you out of
[1:23:44] your misery basically right why don't
[1:23:46] you just go ahead and curse god and die
[1:23:50] yeah maybe she did it out of love
[1:23:52] huh i'm sure she didn't do it out of
[1:23:54] meanness i'm sure he had a good wife
[1:23:57] huh
[1:23:57] but look at that he says
[1:24:00] you speak like a foolish like he didn't
[1:24:02] call you foolish woman you quit talking
[1:24:05] now he said you speak like a foolish
[1:24:07] woman
[1:24:08] you know
[1:24:10] what he said he says am i gonna take
[1:24:13] good from god and then not take that
[1:24:18] come on christians that put that in a
[1:24:20] hard drive you expect to get good from
[1:24:22] god and you don't want to take bad when
[1:24:24] he has it to you
[1:24:26] the lord gives you and he's got the
[1:24:28] right to take it away blessed be the
[1:24:29] name of the lord that's our attitude
[1:24:31] ain't it design
[1:24:33] amen
[1:24:37] all these trials all these tests that
[1:24:39] come you where e are to make you more
[1:24:43] sure
[1:24:45] it's not to give you road rage

[1:24:52] like we feel like sometimes i'm gonna
[1:24:54] write if it gets any worse i'm just
[1:24:56] gonna lose my mind
[1:24:59] no it's the drive you turn your knees
[1:25:02] and from your knees it takes deep
[1:25:04] deeper root in god and say god
[1:25:07] i can't get over it i can't get under it
[1:25:09] i can't get around it
[1:25:11] i don't know what to do with this
[1:25:12] problem
[1:25:14] amen
[1:25:16] the best problems are the ones that you
[1:25:18] can't handle
[1:25:20] because i'll handle a problem if i can
[1:25:24] you'll handle a problem if we all will
[1:25:27] because we like a sure life how many
[1:25:29] likes is your life
[1:25:31] amen those over there in uh
[1:25:36] ukraine right now they don't have a sure
[1:25:38] life
[1:25:39] that's a terrible way to have to be in
[1:25:41] that right
[1:25:42] we should appreciate amen
[1:25:45] so anyways god loves to see your
[1:25:48] reaction
[1:25:50] because he wants to know he wants to
[1:25:52] know that you're angry he wants to
[1:25:53] anchor you
[1:25:56] amen
[1:25:58] and he wants you
[1:26:00] to be sure
[1:26:02] and we all know and i'm going to say it
[1:26:04] again that there's only one place that's
[1:26:06] sure
[1:26:07] that is in christ
[1:26:10] i mean how many knows there's no other
[1:26:12] everything else is
[1:26:14] all other ground is sinking sand
[1:26:17] all of the ground is sinking sand
[1:26:24] just comes to mind so i'll say it
[1:26:29] well right here's a scripture for it
[1:26:31] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[1:26:33] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:26:35] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[1:26:37] father many will come to me that say
[1:26:39] that say well i thought i was for sure
[1:26:41] right with you
[1:26:43] well i i prophesied in your name and in
[1:26:46] my name cast out many devils and done
[1:26:48] many mighty work they thought they were
[1:26:51] sure
[1:26:52] i mean there's a world full of people
[1:26:54] out there that thought they were sure
[1:26:58] but when it came to obeying this word
[1:27:01] they just didn't think they really had
[1:27:03] to
[1:27:06] how many knows that's the only kind
[1:27:08] workers of iniquity knowing to do better
[1:27:10] not doing it they know
[1:27:12] that ah the word says this but i don't
[1:27:15] really want to do that
[1:27:18] it doesn't cut how much profit saying
[1:27:19] you do how many devils you cast out
[1:27:21] you're on uncertain ground
[1:27:24] and millions are in that place
[1:27:28] amen
[1:27:29] but i like this part
[1:27:31] he'll say no i don't like this part here
[1:27:34] because i feel bad for them
[1:27:36] and then will i profess unto them i
[1:27:38] never knew you depart from me that work
[1:27:41] iniquity
[1:27:42] this part i do like therefore whosoever
[1:27:44] hears these things of mine and doeth
[1:27:46] them i will liken him unto a man which
[1:27:49] built his house
[1:27:51] upon
[1:27:53] a
[1:27:55] rock
[1:27:56] help me preach
[1:27:57] upon a
[1:27:58] rock a solid foundation
[1:28:03] how many knows jesus is the chief
[1:28:04] cornerstone anything that's built got to
[1:28:07] be built on the word
[1:28:10] anything thomas or any preacher preaches
[1:28:12] has to be on the word
[1:28:17] amen i might say well this is what i
[1:28:20] think and you might hear it but it's not
[1:28:22] what you take for gospel
[1:28:26] amen before i tell you my shifting sands
[1:28:29] idea i'm probably going to give you a
[1:28:30] heads up here here's my idea when i say
[1:28:32] that
[1:28:33] yeah a little those tenants go up and
[1:28:35] realize hey now this is not gospel they
[1:28:37] brought about
[1:28:38] preaching
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:44] praise the lord you love the lord
[1:28:46] tonight
[1:28:46] how many is glad to have that
[1:28:50] you know what i would suggest that we
[1:28:52] leave the lights turned on
[1:28:54] we leave the place open if there's
[1:28:56] anybody that's not sure you stay right
[1:28:58] here
[1:28:59] close the door whatever tomorrow noon
[1:29:01] whatever it takes you to get sure get
[1:29:03] your
[1:29:05] huh
[1:29:06] you can't afford to go out there and die

[1:29:59] sent in this day aren't you
[1:30:01] because that brought us surety it
[1:30:03] vindicated it it proved it
[1:30:07] oh my
[1:30:09] how many times you know now we've been
[1:30:11] this morning
[1:30:12] listening to multiple messages and so
[1:30:14] forth and the prophet of god saying now
[1:30:16] whatever jesus did back then if he does
[1:30:18] that today will you believe it was him
[1:30:21] well yeah of course you would believe
[1:30:23] then he would do it you know let him
[1:30:24] come i can't do anything but if you'll
[1:30:26] come
[1:30:28] amen and you can know that it's him
[1:30:30] again
[1:30:31] and we know that it's him so that you
[1:30:33] can be sure
[1:30:35] what i like about it even though we
[1:30:36] haven't down went down this crumbling
[1:30:38] the earth is
[1:30:40] oh man our our kingdom our our nation is
[1:30:43] crackling the the ground is giving and
[1:30:46] it's just about to fall is that right
[1:30:48] how many knows america is about to fall
[1:30:52] and that may be a little bit light
[1:30:55] and that rights may have fallen already
[1:30:57] it's in the fall it's already falling
[1:31:00] huh
[1:31:02] it's just fallen so hard
[1:31:04] so far and it's going to continue to
[1:31:06] fall
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:10] and why then it makes you realize hey
[1:31:12] don't look at america
[1:31:16] okay
[1:31:17] i just thought about what i wanted to
[1:31:18] say yet in closing
[1:31:21] you look at the circles of kingdoms
[1:31:23] right you look at the rise of all the
[1:31:25] kingdoms right
[1:31:27] and the greatness of them nebuchadnezzar
[1:31:30] was the greatest
[1:31:32] then there was greece
[1:31:33] then there was rome right then there was
[1:31:35] rome and then it was russia and us and
[1:31:38] so forth and then there kicked different
[1:31:40] kingdoms
[1:31:41] north korea china all kinds of different
[1:31:43] kingdoms that's there and so forth all
[1:31:45] these different kingdoms that's rose up
[1:31:47] but do you see the rise of rome you
[1:31:49] don't hear the only thing rome around
[1:31:51] here is roman catholic church sitting
[1:31:52] over there
[1:31:54] yeah they fell
[1:31:56] right they fell uh all of them they rose
[1:31:58] he came to greatness and fell now we see
[1:32:00] our own country that feared god right
[1:32:04] feared god and and we became the
[1:32:07] greatest
[1:32:09] unbeatable
[1:32:10] god was with us and then what happened
[1:32:15] we just can't
[1:32:16] hold steady
[1:32:18] it's just not sure
[1:32:20] it may look sure but it's not because
[1:32:22] it's man's kingdom
[1:32:25] amen
[1:32:27] and it seems to go back slide back goes
[1:32:29] backwards again and falls rises and it
[1:32:32] falls rises and it falls amen just like
[1:32:35] it's a circle that it goes in
[1:32:37] amen
[1:32:38] goes back and so forth and then i
[1:32:40] thought about sometimes you know
[1:32:43] this is what i want to get to you know
[1:32:44] because i want to make sure that my
[1:32:46] anchor holds and grips the solid rock
[1:32:50] but how many this is my question how
[1:32:52] many of us tonight
[1:32:56] have made
[1:32:58] um
[1:32:59] what do you call them when you turn a
[1:33:00] new leaf
[1:33:02] a new year's resolution or whatever
[1:33:05] i've made many a resolution
[1:33:08] and you know i won't call it necessarily
[1:33:10] a resolution but i'll repent and say god
[1:33:12] i want a fresh start today anything i've
[1:33:14] done wrong lord i don't want to be
[1:33:17] like like i have been father and so
[1:33:19] forth and you get a new start and and
[1:33:22] you feel closer to god and and i
[1:33:24] remember after brother billy died i said
[1:33:26] you know i'm gonna i want to live every
[1:33:28] day like it's my last one
[1:33:30] something about it just brought me
[1:33:31] closer got to god you know i'll come to
[1:33:33] that place one day and i want to just
[1:33:35] live for god every day and and think
[1:33:37] about him and uh you know when brother
[1:33:39] danny preached that on on putting god
[1:33:41] first and many times i'll preach on god
[1:33:42] first you know and listen to that tape
[1:33:44] in the morning or listen to that tape or
[1:33:46] not do my prayer and stay close to the
[1:33:47] lord but it just seems like no time
[1:33:53] are you with me it seems like you
[1:33:54] slipped back in that other old circle
[1:33:56] and you don't have that fervency anymore
[1:33:59] you don't have that you know and and i
[1:34:01] took yesterday or today and this
[1:34:02] afternoon and i says i ain't doing
[1:34:03] nothing
[1:34:04] i'm not where i want to be with god and
[1:34:06] i and you know it's just not what i want
[1:34:08] to be and i've i i've wanted to take
[1:34:10] more time listen and so forth and hey
[1:34:12] you know i like to take the tape and
[1:34:14] play or wherever i go and whatever and
[1:34:17] soon you seem to drift away from it and
[1:34:19] i said i'm just going to take some time
[1:34:20] lord
[1:34:22] and i thought you know we do that we
[1:34:23] kind of go through that cycle
[1:34:26] that no matter how much in our minds we
[1:34:28] resolute that we're going to do this
[1:34:30] we're going to do that we're going to
[1:34:30] pray more we're going to take
[1:34:32] this body and i can understand perhaps
[1:34:34] that's what paul was talking about in
[1:34:36] romans he says the good that i would i
[1:34:38] find that that which i would not that i
[1:34:40] do
[1:34:41] oh wretched man that i am who's going to
[1:34:44] deliver me now i realize that this body
[1:34:46] there's nothing sure about this body
[1:34:49] are you with me and there's nothing sure
[1:34:51] about the desires of this flesh it all
[1:34:54] goes the wrong direction it pulls you
[1:34:56] the wrong way
[1:34:58] that's why you have to have your days
[1:35:00] that you take off to get closer to god
[1:35:02] that's why you have to have your
[1:35:03] renewals with god are you with me
[1:35:06] how many believe you have to have that
[1:35:07] renewals god
[1:35:09] let me not get drifted away don't let me
[1:35:11] drift off here
[1:35:13] huh
[1:35:15] and get cold on you and not have that
[1:35:17] intimate relationship
[1:35:20] and that joy in by heart how many knows
[1:35:23] it's easy to lose that joy
[1:35:25] that joy of the lord that's in your
[1:35:27] heart and
[1:35:28] my
[1:35:30] i believe we just get a lot of times i
[1:35:31] think we get consumed
[1:35:33] with the cares of this life
[1:35:35] and we get so busy with the cares of
[1:35:37] this life that we don't have the prayer
[1:35:39] time
[1:35:40] the time to uh listen to a tape read our
[1:35:43] bible or have the bible read to you you
[1:35:45] don't even have to read it you can have
[1:35:47] it playing in your ear
[1:35:49] amen that's better nothing is that right
[1:35:52] we have it there but just taking the
[1:35:53] time that says lord i want to be more
[1:35:55] sure i want to be steadfast i want to be
[1:35:57] more sure lord i hate this i hate this
[1:36:00] you know of of
[1:36:02] feeling like you're right where you want
[1:36:04] to be with the lord and then in a couple
[1:36:05] days you got so
[1:36:07] caught up with your job and your your
[1:36:09] your tasks that you had huh
[1:36:12] that you forgot to play a tape that day
[1:36:15] you've got to listen to where you forgot
[1:36:16] to talk to the lord
[1:36:18] amen
[1:36:26] because i like it i like it
[1:36:28] when i'm thinking on the lord
[1:36:31] and you know i've said it many times
[1:36:32] over the pulpit blessed is he whose mind
[1:36:35] is stayed on thee
[1:36:38] it truly is right
[1:36:41] but it's hard that's hard to do because
[1:36:42] of all the other things that you have to
[1:36:44] think about
[1:36:45] and and we know already that the bible
[1:36:47] says that you suppose that you think
[1:36:49] about it when you get up
[1:36:51] when you're working when you go lay down
[1:36:52] at night no matter the bible says the
[1:36:54] two on this they'll meditate day and
[1:36:57] night
[1:36:58] i believe that's the only way to stay in
[1:36:59] that place with god that you need to be
[1:37:02] amen if you find yourself going away
[1:37:04] from that you need to repent and say god
[1:37:06] get me right back
[1:37:07] because this flesh wants to go into its
[1:37:09] cycle of death
[1:37:11] how many believes in those that people
[1:37:13] that are not really genuinely born again
[1:37:15] they'll go into that cycle of death they
[1:37:17] don't never come out of it
[1:37:19] pretty soon they don't care about
[1:37:20] whether they're in church or not they
[1:37:21] don't come to church
[1:37:24] amen
[1:37:25] and they quit coming to church why
[1:37:29] because they let that flesh just carry
[1:37:30] them away
[1:37:32] if they're not a child of god amen
[1:37:34] they'll stay away but if they're a child
[1:37:36] of god god will get a hold of him
[1:37:39] young people listen you may get away
[1:37:40] from god a little bit but listen if
[1:37:42] you're really child of god you'll feel
[1:37:44] terrible you'll feel terrible in here
[1:37:46] and say god i don't want to feel like
[1:37:48] this this is not the way it's supposed
[1:37:50] to be
[1:37:50] you'll get on your knees and you'll get
[1:37:52] right with god again
[1:37:54] amen
[1:37:57] donna what was that saying that you read
[1:37:59] to me about church and
[1:38:01] people they end up not going
[1:38:06] you don't remember what you thought it
[1:38:07] was do you
[1:38:09] not you don't okay anyway there's some
[1:38:11] kind of a riddle about people who
[1:38:14] start not coming to church and then in
[1:38:16] no time you don't go to oh something
[1:38:18] about missing
[1:38:20] missing
[1:38:21] you'd have to pull it up
[1:38:24] anyway
[1:38:25] start missing and pretty soon
[1:38:28] i mean you don't go anymore and that's
[1:38:30] the way it is with your prayer life how
[1:38:32] many of those if you start missing your
[1:38:33] prayer your wall pretty soon you don't
[1:38:36] have it anymore
[1:38:37] that joy's gone that peace is gone
[1:38:40] so how many tonight will with me if you
[1:38:42] stand with me tonight just say in your
[1:38:44] heart god i know what the brother balor
[1:38:47] is talking about
[1:38:49] those little things that we played
[1:38:50] ourselves to and we find ourselves away
[1:38:52] from them and have to come back to him
[1:38:54] and and so forth lord tonight we just
[1:38:57] want to rededicate ourselves again and
[1:38:58] say lord jesus
[1:39:00] help us lord not to get away from you
[1:39:02] lord not to slip not to rise to come to
[1:39:04] the
[1:39:05] place of really being in fellowship with
[1:39:07] you just to let the cares of this world
[1:39:10] once again drag that right out of us
[1:39:12] suck it right out of us
[1:39:14] lord jesus and then we're back and not
[1:39:16] not so happy anymore and grumpy and
[1:39:18] everything else lord i ask god that you
[1:39:21] help each and every one of us and
[1:39:22] forgive us lord of where we're like that
[1:39:25] and and the good that we would lord
[1:39:27] jesus we just sometimes don't find and
[1:39:28] that which i would not sometimes we find
[1:39:30] we're doing that
[1:39:32] lord it's a body of sin it's a body
[1:39:34] that's pulling us the wrong way but
[1:39:36] there's a anchor in our heart now in our
[1:39:38] soul that's sure and steadfast and we
[1:39:41] thank you for that anchor lord and we
[1:39:42] know that it's you holding on to us
[1:39:45] we're not holding ourselves we realize
[1:39:47] it's you god that's holding on to us
[1:39:49] amen and you won't let us go
[1:39:52] because you are yours lord and we're
[1:39:54] thankful for that god bring us all to a
[1:39:56] close walk with you lord jesus and help
[1:39:59] us to remember this today lord tonight's
[1:40:01] message father of how that we need to
[1:40:03] stay focused on you and and keep our
[1:40:05] mind stayed on you more than what we do
[1:40:07] and each and every one in here lord as
[1:40:09] we raise our hands say god help me and
[1:40:12] help me to keep my mind stayed on you
[1:40:14] because there is no joy greater there is
[1:40:16] no peace created and for you to be
[1:40:18] revealing yourself to me lord and
[1:40:20] speaking through me to to me by your
[1:40:22] word and enlarges that fellowship that i
[1:40:25] can have with you and the revelation
[1:40:26] that you just pour out in our souls lord
[1:40:30] lord so many times the cares of this
[1:40:32] world it stops up the
[1:40:34] the channel lord jesus of that that
[1:40:36] revelation that's coming down in our
[1:40:38] soul and and lord you'll speak to us
[1:40:40] about what we're doing and how we're
[1:40:42] doing it and our jobs and and all the
[1:40:44] way that we're treating our children
[1:40:46] children parents and husbands wives
[1:40:48] wives and husbands and everything that
[1:40:50] we're doing you're trying to show us the
[1:40:51] right way and how to have the right
[1:40:52] atmosphere lord but the cares of life
[1:40:54] seem to drown us out lord because we're
[1:40:57] in rich laodicea and we're so busy and
[1:40:59] we've gotten too busy lord help us not
[1:41:01] to be so busy and to get time for you
[1:41:03] lord jesus because we want to be

[1:41:08] life
