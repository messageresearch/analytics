[1:01:39] that uh
[1:01:40] god has continued to move in his bride
[1:01:41] and his people and
[1:01:43] and i just i just want to be part of
[1:01:45] that
[1:01:46] so i want to speak this morning if you
[1:01:48] want to turn in your bibles
[1:01:50] uh we'll read from two places we'll read
[1:01:52] from
[1:01:53] john chapter 3 and second corinthians
[1:01:56] chapter 12.
[1:01:58] two very familiar scriptures but i just
[1:02:00] want to speak on if we could for just a
[1:02:02] little bit
[1:02:02] uh and if i would title this it would be
[1:02:06] descending into greatness i'm getting
[1:02:08] some rebound is that
[1:02:09] is that me for the micah okay
[1:02:13] descending into greatness and if you
[1:02:16] look in john chapter 3
[1:02:18] let's just go there this is this is
[1:02:20] where john is speaking john the apostle
[1:02:22] speaking of john the baptist
[1:02:24] and this is considered his last
[1:02:25] testimony john the baptist's last
[1:02:27] testimony
[1:02:29] after these things jesus after these
[1:02:32] things came jesus and his disciples into
[1:02:34] the land of judea
[1:02:36] and there he tarried with them and
[1:02:38] baptized
[1:02:39] and john also was baptizing in anan near
[1:02:43] salem because there was much water there
[1:02:45] and they came and were baptized
[1:02:48] for john was not yet cast into prison
[1:02:51] then there arose a question between some
[1:02:54] of john's disciples and the jews about
[1:02:56] purifying
[1:02:58] and they came unto john and said unto
[1:02:59] him rabbi he that was with thee beyond
[1:03:02] jordan
[1:03:03] to whom thou bearest witness behold the
[1:03:05] same baptizeth
[1:03:06] and all men come to him and john
[1:03:09] answered and said a man can receive
[1:03:11] nothing that's important a man can
[1:03:13] receive nothing
[1:03:15] except it be given him from heaven
[1:03:19] he yourselves bear witness bear me
[1:03:21] witness
[1:03:22] that i said i am not the christ but that
[1:03:25] i am sent before him
[1:03:27] he that hath the bride is the bridegroom
[1:03:30] but the friend of the bridegroom which
[1:03:32] standeth and heareth him rejoiceth
[1:03:34] greatly because the bridegroom's voice
[1:03:36] this is my joy therefore
[1:03:38] is fulfilled here's what we want to get
[1:03:40] to
[1:03:42] he must increase but i must decrease
[1:03:46] he that cometh from above is above all
[1:03:48] and he that is of the earth is earthly
[1:03:50] and speaketh of the earth that he cometh
[1:03:53] from heaven
[1:03:54] is above all and what he hath seen and
[1:03:57] heard
[1:03:58] and testifieth and no man receiveth this
[1:04:01] his testimony
[1:04:02] he that hath received this testimony has
[1:04:05] said to seal
[1:04:06] that god is true for he whom god has
[1:04:09] sent speaketh the words of god
[1:04:11] for god giveth not the spirit by measure
[1:04:13] unto him
[1:04:14] the father loveth the son and hath given
[1:04:17] all things into his hand
[1:04:19] he that believeth on the son hath
[1:04:21] everlasting life and he that believeth
[1:04:23] not
[1:04:23] the son shall not see life but the wrath
[1:04:26] of god abideth on him
[1:04:28] second corinthians real quick if you
[1:04:29] would
[1:04:31] chapter 12 verse 9 and 11.
[1:04:46] second corinthians 12 9 and 11.
[1:04:49] give you just a second i still hear
[1:04:51] pages turning
[1:04:54] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:04:56] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:04:59] made perfect
[1:05:00] in weakness most gladly therefore will i
[1:05:03] rather glory in my infirmities
[1:05:05] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:05:07] me therefore i take pleasure in
[1:05:09] infirmities
[1:05:10] and reproaches and necessities and
[1:05:13] persecutions and distresses for christ's
[1:05:15] sake
[1:05:16] for when i am weak then i am strong
[1:05:19] i am become a fool and glory and that
[1:05:21] you compel me
[1:05:23] for i ought to have been commended of
[1:05:25] you nothing
[1:05:26] for in nothing am i behind the very
[1:05:29] chiefest apostles though i be nothing
[1:05:31] may god as is blessings to the reading
[1:05:33] of the word you can have your seats
[1:05:36] so i'm going to take this thought
[1:05:37] descending into greatness and you know
[1:05:40] i'm a topic preacher so i study out
[1:05:42] topics and i try to
[1:05:43] go at it and break it down and just kind
[1:05:44] of look at it and see what
[1:05:46] what the lord would have for us but this
[1:05:48] morning will be similar the same way but
[1:05:50] this is not at all
[1:05:51] what i had in mind uh really when
[1:05:54] brother
[1:05:54] balor asked me wednesday night to take
[1:05:56] this service um
[1:05:58] uh this is not what i had on my mind up
[1:06:00] until about three o'clock this morning
[1:06:01] so
[1:06:02] we need the help of the lord this
[1:06:03] morning okay uh we always do but this
[1:06:05] morning this thing we need a special so
[1:06:07] but if that's what what he wants that's
[1:06:09] what we'll we'll deliver so
[1:06:11] um bro brandon says here in paul he says
[1:06:14] when i am
[1:06:14] weak then i am strong yes he said i will
[1:06:17] glorify my infirmities of the weakness
[1:06:20] and so forth
[1:06:21] i'm thanking god that all of all is out
[1:06:24] of me
[1:06:24] and when i get everything out of me then
[1:06:28] god can come in but as long as i've got
[1:06:31] some of myself there
[1:06:34] then god can't get in so brother brown
[1:06:38] is telling us that as long as he's got
[1:06:41] just a little bit just a portion just
[1:06:42] some just a
[1:06:43] fragment of himself in the way god has
[1:06:46] no room in there there's no room for god
[1:06:48] there and god can't get in there
[1:06:50] listen what he says he says and that's
[1:06:52] it we
[1:06:53] smother him out we drive him away now
[1:06:57] that is a bad thought to have in our
[1:06:59] mind that we would be in such a place
[1:07:01] that we
[1:07:01] drive push or smother god away from us
[1:07:06] he said it's from the poorest to the
[1:07:08] richest from the least to the greatest
[1:07:10] we keep god out of our lives because of
[1:07:13] our
[1:07:14] own selves it's
[1:07:17] he says i've often said you've heard it
[1:07:19] a million times
[1:07:20] that the greatest enemy i got is william
[1:07:24] brown
[1:07:25] so we're talking about the prophet of
[1:07:27] the hour a man
[1:07:28] sent from god to come to reveal the word
[1:07:31] to a bride in this last
[1:07:33] age and he's not talking about his
[1:07:35] greatest battle or his greatest
[1:07:36] enemy that he's got he's not talking
[1:07:38] about satan he's not talking about
[1:07:40] the anything any of the demons that
[1:07:42] satan can throw at him but he's talking
[1:07:44] about himself
[1:07:45] because he knows that jesus christ has
[1:07:47] already defeated satan
[1:07:49] and there's nothing that satan can throw
[1:07:51] at him that he can't overcome
[1:07:53] but it's himself that he can't overcome
[1:07:58] that ought to catch our attention he
[1:08:00] says because he's the one
[1:08:02] that gets in the way william branham
[1:08:04] he's the one that gets
[1:08:06] lazy william
[1:08:09] he's the one that gets into a place
[1:08:10] sometime that he thinks he can do
[1:08:12] something about it
[1:08:14] and when he does he shoves god right out
[1:08:17] of the picture
[1:08:19] and that is easy for us as human beings
[1:08:22] because we want to fix things
[1:08:24] we are constantly in our minds if
[1:08:25] there's a problem we try to figure out a
[1:08:27] way to get through it around it over it
[1:08:29] or whatever
[1:08:30] instead of sometimes letting god do the
[1:08:32] work
[1:08:33] we lift ourselves up and brother brown
[1:08:36] said if i can get rid of
[1:08:37] that guy when i get into a place like
[1:08:40] that and he's out of the way
[1:08:42] then god can come over and do
[1:08:45] things that william branham knows
[1:08:47] nothing
[1:08:48] about the prophet of the hour
[1:08:53] if he can get himself out of the way
[1:08:57] and god can come in and do something
[1:09:00] that
[1:09:00] william branham knows nothing about you
[1:09:03] talking about a man of humility
[1:09:06] he's talking about a humble approach and
[1:09:08] getting himself into a place
[1:09:10] lower than low to allow god to come in
[1:09:13] and do something through him
[1:09:15] he says that's when god can use you
[1:09:19] that's when god can use any of you
[1:09:22] you can point finger at yourself this
[1:09:24] morning and say if i can get
[1:09:25] myself out of the way i can let god come
[1:09:29] in and use
[1:09:30] me you think how would god use me what
[1:09:33] can i do for god
[1:09:34] who's his eyes who's his ears
[1:09:38] who's his voice how's he expressing
[1:09:41] himself in the world today
[1:09:42] he's expressing himself through his
[1:09:44] believers if we
[1:09:45] just get out of the way
[1:09:52] so we see these two we read our
[1:09:54] scriptures we see these two
[1:09:56] patriarchs of the new testament
[1:09:59] and they're that's their goal that's
[1:10:00] what they're trying to do they're trying
[1:10:01] to get themselves
[1:10:03] out of the way men of god william
[1:10:05] branham and these two patriarchs we
[1:10:07] talked about they're
[1:10:07] recognizing that the whole world is
[1:10:10] relying upon them
[1:10:11] to get out of the way and let god move
[1:10:13] on the scene and do what god
[1:10:14] wants done
[1:10:18] now it's a bold statement when john the
[1:10:21] baptist
[1:10:22] says i have to decrease
[1:10:25] so that he can increase
[1:10:28] you think about those two words decrease
[1:10:31] and increase decrease means to make
[1:10:34] something smaller
[1:10:35] fewer in size the amount the intensity
[1:10:37] or degree
[1:10:39] and so increase is just the opposite of
[1:10:41] that
[1:10:42] we're growing we're getting better we're
[1:10:44] getting stronger we're getting bigger
[1:10:45] we're adding to
[1:10:46] god's kingdom and we think about in the
[1:10:50] human or in the
[1:10:51] american language english language we
[1:10:54] think about the word down
[1:10:57] and that has a negative connotation to
[1:10:59] it you think about down and you think
[1:11:01] well man that that's not a good word
[1:11:03] it's reserved for losers
[1:11:05] down the word we try to avoid it
[1:11:08] we want to try to ignore it when it's
[1:11:10] thrown at it because when you attach it
[1:11:12] to other words
[1:11:13] they bring us down like down and out
[1:11:16] down-hearted
[1:11:17] downfall down scale downhill downer
[1:11:20] down under
[1:11:25] but the word up is just the opposite
[1:11:28] it has these positive connotations and
[1:11:30] it's associated with the heroes and
[1:11:32] winners and the people of the bible
[1:11:34] it's upscale upcoming upper class
[1:11:38] upstanding
[1:11:40] and we think about our present world we
[1:11:42] live in
[1:11:44] what have you been taught your whole
[1:11:45] life to move up
[1:11:48] in the world to move up in your career
[1:11:51] to move up in your job to move up
[1:11:54] amongst your peers to move up in school
[1:11:56] to constantly be moving up
[1:11:58] and here we've got that in our minds and
[1:12:00] in our minds we're directed towards that
[1:12:02] way to go up up up and people
[1:12:04] they want to rise above the rise to the
[1:12:07] occasion or rise above odds
[1:12:10] that's what we're taught so how do we
[1:12:13] change that in our minds when we think
[1:12:15] about
[1:12:16] christ how do we think change that in
[1:12:18] our mind when we realize
[1:12:20] that in order to get stronger in christ
[1:12:21] we have to get weaker
[1:12:26] how do we change that let's look at this
[1:12:30] these john the baptist when he says that
[1:12:34] it had to startle his disciples and open
[1:12:37] their eyes in such a way they're looking
[1:12:38] at him
[1:12:38] in shock and in awe and he tells them i
[1:12:42] must
[1:12:43] decrease so that jesus can increase and
[1:12:45] that goes completely against their
[1:12:47] fleshly desires
[1:12:50] so how do we descend into greatness
[1:12:54] let's look at this passage for just a
[1:12:56] minute
[1:12:57] so right before we get to this scripture
[1:12:59] we had jesus just had the conversation
[1:13:01] with nicodemus
[1:13:02] and during that conversation jesus is
[1:13:04] telling nicodemus
[1:13:06] that you have to be born again and we go
[1:13:08] to the most important or one of the most
[1:13:10] famous verses in the bible john 3 16 for
[1:13:12] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:13:13] only begotten son
[1:13:14] that's whosoever believeth in him should
[1:13:17] not perish but have
[1:13:18] everlasting life so jesus is having this
[1:13:20] conversation with nicodemus and after
[1:13:22] it's over he's
[1:13:23] he's witnessed the nicodemus and all
[1:13:25] that's taking place jesus then travels
[1:13:27] about 50 miles
[1:13:28] into another another area called salaam
[1:13:31] and he's associated right there with the
[1:13:32] jordan river
[1:13:34] and so over there jesus then begins to
[1:13:36] baptize people
[1:13:37] and it's one of the only accounts i
[1:13:39] think the only account where we see
[1:13:40] jesus actually baptizing
[1:13:42] in the river and so john the baptist is
[1:13:45] over here in the same place now let's
[1:13:47] get the setting here
[1:13:48] and he's over there baptizing people at
[1:13:51] the same place
[1:13:53] and there's an argument that that ensues
[1:13:55] between john's disciples
[1:13:57] and some other jewish men now we're not
[1:14:00] we don't know the bible don't tell us
[1:14:01] what they were arguing about
[1:14:02] maybe they were arguing about how you
[1:14:04] get baptized how how you how you
[1:14:06] who baptized who should do it how you do
[1:14:07] it wherever
[1:14:09] but anyway we know that the end result
[1:14:10] john's disciples come back to john
[1:14:13] and they question what is jesus doing
[1:14:20] they told john they said that man that
[1:14:23] you was with on the other side of the
[1:14:24] jordan
[1:14:25] the one you testified about he's
[1:14:27] baptizing
[1:14:28] and now everybody's going to him
[1:14:32] you see they were followers of john the
[1:14:34] baptist
[1:14:36] they was loyally following him and now
[1:14:38] all of a sudden this new guy
[1:14:39] comes into town and he's getting all the
[1:14:42] credit
[1:14:43] this new guy comes into town and they
[1:14:45] don't like it one single bit
[1:14:47] they're sitting there and they look and
[1:14:49] they because to them it's a competition
[1:14:51] now
[1:14:52] this was their life to them this is what
[1:14:54] they did day in and day out they went to
[1:14:56] give people they witnessed they
[1:14:57] they brought people to john the baptist
[1:14:58] he baptized them and everything was good
[1:15:01] this was their livelihood man they were
[1:15:02] in control of their life
[1:15:05] but now they're not happy about this
[1:15:07] that man over there has moved into our
[1:15:09] territory
[1:15:13] they've got a little bit of anger about
[1:15:15] them
[1:15:17] and just think about it you know it's
[1:15:19] like if you owned a successful business
[1:15:21] on north main street in the town you
[1:15:24] live in and you had the one product that
[1:15:26] everybody had to have
[1:15:28] everybody needed it and you're the only
[1:15:30] place in town
[1:15:31] that carries this product and then all
[1:15:33] of a sudden you find out that on south
[1:15:35] main street
[1:15:36] somebody else is putting in a store and
[1:15:38] you know what they've got that same
[1:15:39] product that you've got
[1:15:42] how would you feel so here is the
[1:15:45] disciples of john the baptist
[1:15:47] and they're here and they're going
[1:15:48] through this and in their mind they're
[1:15:50] proud of the work they're doing and they
[1:15:52] go
[1:15:52] and they go to john and they tell him
[1:15:54] they don't even call him by name
[1:15:56] they don't even notify or recognize him
[1:15:58] as jesus
[1:15:59] they don't even recognize him as a
[1:16:01] messiah
[1:16:02] even though john does they don't it's
[1:16:04] that man you were with over there
[1:16:08] who is he why is he here what's he doing
[1:16:11] he's
[1:16:11] encroaching on our territory
[1:16:16] john baptist ministry was big it was
[1:16:19] established
[1:16:21] it was growing by the hundreds and
[1:16:22] hundreds and hundreds and john's
[1:16:24] disciples are just are
[1:16:26] concerned about this but john
[1:16:30] he had a different approach he listened
[1:16:32] to what they had to say
[1:16:34] but he knew exactly who he was they
[1:16:37] thought john was the man for the hour
[1:16:40] they thought that john was the man going
[1:16:42] to take us all in
[1:16:44] he's the one that's going to going to
[1:16:45] settle all this even though john says i
[1:16:47] told y'all don't you remember me telling
[1:16:50] you
[1:16:50] i'm just the forerunner i'm not the one
[1:16:54] i'm not the one that needs to be getting
[1:16:55] the credit john knew that jesus was the
[1:16:58] man of the hour
[1:17:02] so john he knew who jesus was his
[1:17:05] disciples didn't
[1:17:10] but they're upset everybody's going to
[1:17:12] jesus
[1:17:14] watch what john says because he knew his
[1:17:17] ministry was only successful because of
[1:17:19] god's blessings
[1:17:21] it wasn't anything he was doing it was
[1:17:23] what god allowed him to do
[1:17:25] he said a man can receive nothing unless
[1:17:27] it has been given to him from heaven
[1:17:30] and brothers and sisters we've got to
[1:17:31] keep that in our minds at all times or
[1:17:34] if not we find ourselves puffed up
[1:17:36] we find ourselves in a prideful
[1:17:38] situation we find
[1:17:40] god not able to move through us and use
[1:17:42] us
[1:17:43] because we have got ourselves into a
[1:17:44] place that we are successful
[1:17:48] i did it i'm successful i did this
[1:17:51] i did that you see how easy it happens
[1:17:56] that's exactly what john john the
[1:17:58] baptist disciples did
[1:17:59] you did this john we're with you where
[1:18:01] one were you
[1:18:02] how come he's coming in
[1:18:05] they couldn't put their self in a lower
[1:18:10] place but i'll tell you this
[1:18:14] anything we have come from heaven
[1:18:18] if you've got a business and it's a
[1:18:19] successful business it's been given to
[1:18:21] you from heaven
[1:18:22] if you've got a uh uh if you've got
[1:18:24] peace in your life
[1:18:26] it's nothing you did you didn't learn
[1:18:28] that in a school that's been given to
[1:18:29] you from heaven
[1:18:30] if your marriage is still held together
[1:18:32] today it's because it was given from
[1:18:34] heaven
[1:18:35] all of these things that god had done
[1:18:37] and he's done it to you because it comes
[1:18:38] down from heaven
[1:18:40] and if we can find ourselves stepping
[1:18:42] out of the way in life
[1:18:43] and letting god be first
[1:18:49] how much how much further along will we
[1:18:51] be down the road
[1:18:53] how much more could god use you
[1:18:56] how much more could there be a ministry
[1:18:58] in your life i'm not talking about
[1:18:59] preaching i'm not talking about singing
[1:19:01] i'm just talking about being a christian
[1:19:04] i'm talking about living the life before
[1:19:06] others
[1:19:11] i like where john goes into the
[1:19:12] scriptures there
[1:19:15] and he immediately likens himself to the
[1:19:17] best man at the wedding
[1:19:21] and i i never caught that before last
[1:19:23] night at 3 30.
[1:19:25] i've never caught that that john likened
[1:19:28] himself to the best man at the wedding
[1:19:30] in this case he knows that jesus is in a
[1:19:32] in an accordion and a marriage with his
[1:19:35] bro with the bride or the church
[1:19:36] and john understands his role in the
[1:19:38] kingdom of god and he understands
[1:19:40] that the groom is the one to be blessed
[1:19:45] and that's what he tells his guys he
[1:19:46] says you know i'm happy
[1:19:48] being the best man in the wedding
[1:19:51] i'm happy to be the best man because the
[1:19:54] groom is the most important man of the
[1:19:57] hour
[1:19:59] in this case last night i think it was
[1:20:02] probably a different scenario
[1:20:04] but in this case he's putting god first
[1:20:07] and foremost in his life
[1:20:09] and brothers and sisters if we can
[1:20:10] continually do that
[1:20:12] there is nothing that will stand in the
[1:20:14] way because god delivers those
[1:20:16] who gets out of the way god he he trusts
[1:20:19] those who gets out of the way
[1:20:21] god he makes the believers that get out
[1:20:24] of the way
[1:20:24] god can use and he never fails
[1:20:29] you have you are in a win-win situation
[1:20:31] you have nothing
[1:20:32] to lose you know you see you hear ball
[1:20:37] games and stuff you hear
[1:20:38] athletes they go into they're the
[1:20:40] underdog they have
[1:20:41] nothing to lose they have no worries
[1:20:43] they have no
[1:20:44] fear they don't care because all they
[1:20:46] can do is upset
[1:20:48] and defeat the other team you've got
[1:20:51] nothing to lose
[1:20:54] let's look at paul for a few minutes
[1:20:57] brother brown said this was a man that
[1:20:59] was trained
[1:21:00] he could speak almost any language there
[1:21:02] was in the world
[1:21:04] he had the right to brag about it he was
[1:21:06] brought up under the strict sect of the
[1:21:08] pharisees his father was a pharisee
[1:21:10] and later he was a pharisee of the
[1:21:12] pharisees
[1:21:13] and that means he was the strictest of
[1:21:16] the pharisees
[1:21:17] a great fellow and he had authority and
[1:21:20] he was
[1:21:21] smart his father had given him an
[1:21:24] education or the best teacher
[1:21:25] and there was all that there was all in
[1:21:27] all the land and at that time the most
[1:21:29] notable teacher of any schools
[1:21:31] and paul became that type of man he
[1:21:33] learned every language
[1:21:34] every psychology and he was going to
[1:21:37] make havoc
[1:21:39] of the church can you
[1:21:42] imagine knowing how to speak every
[1:21:44] language
[1:21:46] of the land what kind of man is this
[1:21:48] what kind of education what kind of
[1:21:50] training and teaching does this man have
[1:21:52] that that he could know every language
[1:21:54] and psychology
[1:21:56] but yet paul with all of his education
[1:21:58] after he received christ
[1:22:00] listen to what he said he says it's not
[1:22:02] how strong and great i am
[1:22:03] i've got to forget that in order for god
[1:22:06] to use me
[1:22:07] he had to realize that he couldn't
[1:22:09] depend upon himself
[1:22:10] he couldn't depend on his education he
[1:22:13] couldn't depend on
[1:22:14] his upraising and his teaching because
[1:22:16] it wasn't right
[1:22:19] and he said he got there and he's come
[1:22:20] to a place and he says brethren when i
[1:22:22] come to you
[1:22:22] it's not with excellency of speech but
[1:22:25] it's with the power of god
[1:22:28] he wasn't relying upon all he had
[1:22:29] learned
[1:22:34] listen what he says can you imagine a
[1:22:36] man a pharisee a pharisee he's a teacher
[1:22:37] a teacher
[1:22:38] trained from a childhood for the
[1:22:40] ministry
[1:22:42] and this is this is the guy's going to
[1:22:43] wreak havoc on the church
[1:22:45] an eloquent man smart
[1:22:49] a man who could turn the world upside
[1:22:51] down the greatest
[1:22:52] missionary that's ever been known to
[1:22:54] confess
[1:22:56] that he come in weakness
[1:23:02] we're taught from a child
[1:23:05] to be strong we're taught to be
[1:23:08] durable we're taught to fight through
[1:23:11] the battles we're taught to be
[1:23:12] overcomers
[1:23:13] this message teaches us to be overcomers
[1:23:16] but if you want to be an overcomer
[1:23:18] you've got to find yourself in a
[1:23:19] weakened condition
[1:23:21] that god can actually come in and use
[1:23:23] you and you've got all of your pride all
[1:23:25] of your education
[1:23:26] and everything out of the way just like
[1:23:28] paul did he said he come
[1:23:35] in weakness and in fear he said not
[1:23:38] and in much trembling he said the reason
[1:23:40] he was fearing was not because he was
[1:23:42] scared of anything
[1:23:44] so paul wasn't scared of anything he
[1:23:46] said it was something that he learned
[1:23:48] he said he didn't come with excellency
[1:23:50] of speech but he came in fear
[1:23:52] in the way knowing nothing but christ
[1:23:54] and him
[1:23:55] crucified his fear come from not being
[1:23:58] able to get low
[1:23:59] enough that god could step down in him
[1:24:01] and use him
[1:24:03] and overcome all that he knew in the
[1:24:05] past
[1:24:10] this was a man
[1:24:13] who was a warrior he had to be stripped
[1:24:16] of himself
[1:24:19] we got to be stripped of ourselves
[1:24:22] our homes have to be stripped of
[1:24:24] themselves
[1:24:26] our schools have to be stripped of
[1:24:28] themselves
[1:24:30] our churches have to be stripped of
[1:24:31] their selves
[1:24:33] our marriages have to be stripped of
[1:24:35] ourselves
[1:24:39] because if we're not dripped down
[1:24:42] god can't can't intervene god can't be
[1:24:45] in your marriage if you're going to do
[1:24:47] it
[1:24:48] if you're going to control the marriage
[1:24:50] god's not in it
[1:24:56] our priorities sometimes get wrong
[1:24:59] we place ourselves up here and god down
[1:25:02] here
[1:25:03] instead of being up here low weak meek
[1:25:06] lowly
[1:25:06] and humble we put ourselves up here
[1:25:10] as bread winner
[1:25:13] head of the house
[1:25:18] it's the truth
[1:25:22] we got to strip ourselves down listen to
[1:25:26] what he says
[1:25:27] i hope this gets deep to us he said that
[1:25:30] you realize that you've got to become
[1:25:33] nothing not a know-it-all
[1:25:37] not a great somebody a nobody
[1:25:41] you've got to come to dust a place where
[1:25:44] you know you're
[1:25:44] nothing and then later you can
[1:25:49] rise back up right no he said and you've
[1:25:52] got to be able to keep yourself there
[1:25:54] and never
[1:25:55] rise above it never rise above it for as
[1:25:59] soon as you rise above it
[1:26:02] you rise above god
[1:26:11] keep yourself in the dust and on the
[1:26:13] road to damascus you got to keep
[1:26:15] yourself off your high horses
[1:26:18] god took paul and made a slave out of
[1:26:20] him
[1:26:21] bound him to himself and i love this
[1:26:24] because
[1:26:25] we want to say sometimes god has a sense
[1:26:27] of humor here's where god has a sense of
[1:26:29] humor listen to this
[1:26:30] brother ryan said that he bound him he
[1:26:32] made him a slave and bound him to
[1:26:34] himself
[1:26:35] and bound him to the gentiles which he
[1:26:37] hated
[1:26:39] god will take you and use you in places
[1:26:41] that you never wanted to go
[1:26:43] he'll take you and use you and i guess
[1:26:46] people are with people that you just
[1:26:48] can't stand to be around and that's what
[1:26:50] he did to paul
[1:26:51] he said you've stripped yourself down
[1:26:53] paul now i'm going to come in now go to
[1:26:55] those gentiles
[1:26:56] go to those people that you hate go to
[1:26:58] those people that you can't stand the
[1:27:00] ones you put in prison the ones you beat
[1:27:01] the ones who's tortured go to them now
[1:27:03] and bring them to me
[1:27:07] you're talking about breaking somebody
[1:27:09] down
[1:27:11] we talk about stripping out stripping
[1:27:12] this stuff away god stripped paul down
[1:27:14] in such a way that he couldn't do
[1:27:16] nothing but walk around with his head
[1:27:17] huh
[1:27:19] all the pride he ever had had to have
[1:27:21] been stripped away from him
[1:27:24] and that's what we got to do to
[1:27:25] ourselves today
[1:27:31] god said to paul my strength is perfect
[1:27:34] in your weakness
[1:27:38] you know sometimes we don't even
[1:27:41] recognize god until we're in a situation
[1:27:43] to where we are completely
[1:27:45] out of control
[1:27:48] you hear stories about all time somebody
[1:27:50] and i'm not using this church as an
[1:27:52] illustration but
[1:27:52] you hear it all the time people somebody
[1:27:54] goes to a hospital
[1:27:55] somebody's on their deathbed and all of
[1:27:58] a sudden god
[1:27:59] miraculously steps in why was that
[1:28:01] because somebody got so broken down that
[1:28:04] they could not rely on themselves
[1:28:08] the family was so broken down because
[1:28:11] they
[1:28:11] had nothing to do with the doctors they
[1:28:13] don't know medical conditions all they
[1:28:15] know is their loved one's dying
[1:28:16] and they get so low and down before god
[1:28:20] that god hears their prayers and it's
[1:28:23] sad that it has to be that way
[1:28:25] but sometimes that's the way it happens
[1:28:27] you have to get that low before
[1:28:30] my strength is perfect in your weakness
[1:28:33] and brother brown says the more that can
[1:28:36] be yielded
[1:28:37] the better i can use you
[1:28:42] anybody that's ever got up before people
[1:28:44] in a church
[1:28:45] singing ministering music if you don't
[1:28:48] yield yourself
[1:28:51] god can't move you can have a bunch of
[1:28:54] notes and quotes and thoughts but if
[1:28:57] god's not in those thoughts
[1:28:59] there is not a connection between the
[1:29:01] people and the minister
[1:29:02] and the word just goes out void
[1:29:06] you have to yield yourself into such a
[1:29:08] place that you're dedicated you're weak
[1:29:10] and you get your mind to a place that is
[1:29:12] away from everything to do with the
[1:29:14] world
[1:29:14] and god begins to use you
[1:29:22] let's look in the book of hebrews real
[1:29:23] quick chapter 11 the hero the heroes
[1:29:26] of the bible made strong through
[1:29:29] weakness
[1:29:31] you know all those heroes down through
[1:29:33] there you got samson you got gideon you
[1:29:35] got david you got samuel you got all
[1:29:37] those prophets you got
[1:29:38] uh i think rahabs in there you got all
[1:29:40] these different heroes
[1:29:42] and heroines of the bible and then when
[1:29:44] you get down there and it says
[1:29:46] this and and chapter and verse 34.
[1:29:48] quench the violence of fire
[1:29:50] escape the edge of the sword and out of
[1:29:53] weakness
[1:29:53] they were made strong
[1:29:59] they had to get weak before they could
[1:30:02] get strong
[1:30:03] out of their weakness they were made
[1:30:05] strong
[1:30:08] here's something to console us he says
[1:30:10] here's something that encourages
[1:30:12] out of weakness and humility god chooses
[1:30:14] people
[1:30:15] to build his kingdom out of
[1:30:19] out of your weakness out of your
[1:30:21] humility
[1:30:23] out of you becoming humble before people
[1:30:25] god
[1:30:26] builds his kingdom that's an amazing
[1:30:29] statement
[1:30:30] that the prophet says he said you stand
[1:30:32] in front of a bunch of people that's
[1:30:34] been weak and rejected
[1:30:35] and cast out by the world and know
[1:30:37] nothing but that's what god is building
[1:30:39] his kingdom out of
[1:30:44] i promise i'm gonna lift you up when i
[1:30:45] get to the end
[1:30:49] i'm gonna get you back up out of the
[1:30:50] gutter okay so just bury with me
[1:30:54] isn't it strange though that god likes
[1:30:55] us to sheep
[1:31:02] he likes us to sheep the most helpless
[1:31:04] thing that there is
[1:31:05] in the animal kingdom one of the most
[1:31:10] insufficient animals with defense is the
[1:31:14] sheep
[1:31:16] the squirrel they run in a tree the
[1:31:18] rabbit runs off in the bushes
[1:31:20] the dog bites
[1:31:25] lions tear up brother branham said the
[1:31:28] horse can kick the bird flies
[1:31:31] but the sheep just stands there
[1:31:35] has anybody ever raised sheep nobody's
[1:31:38] as ignorant as i am
[1:31:41] i tried raising sheep you're talking
[1:31:44] about
[1:31:45] aggravating
[1:31:49] they just look at you
[1:31:52] get over here get over here
[1:31:59] they drive you nuts but they're
[1:32:01] defenseless
[1:32:02] at the night when when they they were
[1:32:05] laming we had to pull them into the barn
[1:32:07] because when they had their lambs the
[1:32:08] coyotes would carry them away because
[1:32:10] they don't fight
[1:32:11] man they just stand there
[1:32:14] and they just stand there and let it
[1:32:16] whatever it is come down and get a hold
[1:32:18] of them
[1:32:18] and god likens us to that right there
[1:32:21] and he wants us to realize
[1:32:23] that we are totally insufficient without
[1:32:25] him
[1:32:26] those sheep were totally insufficient
[1:32:28] without me bringing them in
[1:32:30] feeding them water them to make sure the
[1:32:32] lambs were nursing
[1:32:35] i said when those when those sheep would
[1:32:37] have babies they just they just born die
[1:32:43] you couldn't keep those things alive
[1:32:46] insufficient
[1:32:49] and he wants us to realize we're
[1:32:50] insufficient and he takes that person
[1:32:53] that's insufficient
[1:32:54] and he begins to modem into a person
[1:32:56] that god can use
[1:32:58] he begins to build their character he
[1:33:00] begins to take that weakness
[1:33:02] and then he begins to make his own self
[1:33:09] that's why our childhoods are so
[1:33:11] important how we raise our children
[1:33:14] is so important
[1:33:17] because you're beginning to instill in
[1:33:20] them
[1:33:21] the ways of the gospel the ways of
[1:33:23] christ
[1:33:24] and when you instill that into them
[1:33:25] there's something on the inside
[1:33:27] that they begin to realize even at a
[1:33:29] young age
[1:33:30] i'm nobody i'm a nobody
[1:33:36] but god can use me as somebody
[1:33:42] david you look at david there
[1:33:47] out on the battlefield the poorest
[1:33:50] excuse of a soldier that could be found
[1:33:54] the bible says that he was a ruddy
[1:33:56] little fella
[1:33:57] brother brown said he was a scrawny
[1:33:58] looking fella stoop shoulder probably
[1:34:00] just out there
[1:34:01] ready stoop shutter had a little piece
[1:34:02] of sheepskin around him he
[1:34:04] never had any training in swordsmanship
[1:34:07] he didn't know anything about battle
[1:34:10] but he's he he got into such a place
[1:34:12] that he was so low
[1:34:14] as he looked out there and he said why
[1:34:16] are we bowing
[1:34:18] down before this god before this giant
[1:34:24] and so he stood there and relied upon
[1:34:26] god and god
[1:34:27] looked down at him and he said this
[1:34:29] little guy's got
[1:34:31] this little guy's got fire in him that
[1:34:34] he wants to do something for me
[1:34:35] when he sees the whole army of israel
[1:34:38] bowing down and cowing down
[1:34:39] he's standing there as low knowing that
[1:34:41] he has no ability whatsoever in himself
[1:34:44] and he calls up on me to deliver the
[1:34:47] giant
[1:34:49] five little stones
[1:34:53] moses we look at moses
[1:34:57] and we look at the life of moses it's an
[1:34:59] interesting life because
[1:35:00] moses was raised right in the courts of
[1:35:02] pharaoh
[1:35:03] and moses was the had taken such a
[1:35:06] position the prophet said he was the
[1:35:08] next in line
[1:35:09] to be pharaoh he was smart he was
[1:35:12] educated
[1:35:13] he was training the soldiers this guy
[1:35:15] was a trained
[1:35:16] soldier but when he seen what was
[1:35:19] happening
[1:35:20] with his own people when he realized who
[1:35:22] he was and he goes out into the backside
[1:35:24] of the desert
[1:35:27] and he goes out there in the desert he
[1:35:28] settles down he's running from all that
[1:35:31] he knows
[1:35:31] he's running from his education he's
[1:35:33] running from his his royal throne he's
[1:35:35] running from all that he's in the desert
[1:35:37] in the wilderness and on the backside a
[1:35:39] man 80 years old
[1:35:41] with long whiskers brother brown said he
[1:35:45] got didn't learn he got one glimpse of a
[1:35:47] burning bush
[1:35:48] that stood there and said i'll be with
[1:35:50] you
[1:35:52] go to egypt because he knew in himself
[1:35:57] he wasn't anybody moses had come to the
[1:36:00] realization
[1:36:01] i have i am nobody in egypt i have no
[1:36:04] authority in egypt
[1:36:06] if i go to egypt they will probably have
[1:36:08] my head
[1:36:10] and he knew in himself he was nothing
[1:36:12] but the prophet said he went right down
[1:36:14] there with a little old stick in his
[1:36:16] hand
[1:36:17] and took over a whole nation of people
[1:36:22] because he allowed god to use him he got
[1:36:25] himself into a place
[1:36:26] that god could use him
[1:36:36] i truly believe that if we want to find
[1:36:39] the king
[1:36:40] kingdom of god and we want to find
[1:36:43] heaven
[1:36:45] and we want to find ourselves and maybe
[1:36:47] a place right here on earth
[1:36:48] that god can use us we have to be
[1:36:51] willing to do exactly as john did
[1:36:52] as paul did as moses did as david did
[1:36:56] brothers and sisters we have to descend
[1:36:58] into greatness
[1:37:00] we have to descend into greatness
[1:37:01] because i don't think there's any other
[1:37:03] way to do it there's
[1:37:04] you can't be a halfway christian you
[1:37:07] can't be a halfway
[1:37:08] uh a good person there's nothing you can
[1:37:11] do
[1:37:12] halfway that'll never work you and i
[1:37:13] both know
[1:37:15] that if we want to get great we have to
[1:37:18] descend
[1:37:19] i have to be able to give myself to god
[1:37:22] i have to be able to
[1:37:23] let god use my feet i have to be able to
[1:37:26] let god
[1:37:26] use my voice i have to be able to let
[1:37:28] god use my character and my christian
[1:37:30] ability out in front of the people to
[1:37:32] draw people to god
[1:37:33] i have to be able to submit myself to
[1:37:36] what he wants
[1:37:44] but there's risk involved
[1:37:47] there's risk involved there's risk
[1:37:50] involved if you submit your life
[1:37:52] and you surrender to god
[1:37:56] you say risk what do you mean risk
[1:38:02] you just can't give god a little bit
[1:38:05] that's risky there's risk
[1:38:08] you've got to be able to go all in with
[1:38:10] god
[1:38:11] and allow him to use you it's like
[1:38:12] jumping into a swimming pool
[1:38:14] you stick your toe in and you freeze to
[1:38:18] death
[1:38:19] but if you rare back and you run as hard
[1:38:21] as you can go and you jump in
[1:38:22] a big cannonball right in the deep end
[1:38:24] you're all in
[1:38:27] you're all in at that point and that's
[1:38:29] what god is looking for people who will
[1:38:30] go all
[1:38:31] in who will take that risk who will get
[1:38:33] themselves into a place god i surrender
[1:38:35] everything to you now use me god
[1:38:50] i want to be the person that allows god
[1:38:52] to use me and myself
[1:38:58] not be in his way my thinking is not in
[1:39:01] his way my beliefs
[1:39:03] are not in his way and when i say
[1:39:05] beliefs it's a tough one
[1:39:07] because we believe this message but
[1:39:09] sometimes we have beliefs
[1:39:11] that don't completely line up with this
[1:39:14] message
[1:39:15] i'm just being honest and i think we all
[1:39:17] have things in our lives things that
[1:39:19] maybe you were taught in message
[1:39:21] churches in the past that don't truly
[1:39:23] line up with god's word when you dig
[1:39:24] into it and we've got beliefs that we
[1:39:27] stand on
[1:39:28] and beliefs that we look at and it
[1:39:29] hinders us from allowing god to use us
[1:39:36] the risk and become more christ-like
[1:39:40] is that the more you look like christ
[1:39:42] the greater your challenges will be
[1:39:45] are you up to the challenge are you up
[1:39:48] to the challenge this morning because
[1:39:50] you're going to be faced with powers of
[1:39:52] evil that are going to come at you over
[1:39:54] and over and over and the more you look
[1:39:55] like christ the more
[1:39:56] satan throw your way the biggest i ever
[1:40:00] told is once you're a christian you got
[1:40:01] it made that is the biggest lie ever
[1:40:03] told
[1:40:03] by anybody in shoe leather because once
[1:40:06] you become christian once you submit
[1:40:07] your life to god you're a christian
[1:40:08] and god begins to use you satan's going
[1:40:10] to come at you from every angle of
[1:40:12] attack possible
[1:40:14] he is very good at strength in the
[1:40:15] strategies of warfare and he knows where
[1:40:18] your weaknesses are
[1:40:19] and he will throw them before you
[1:40:23] but god's looking for people who could
[1:40:26] stand that challenge
[1:40:27] god's looking for people who can allow
[1:40:29] himself to come in and then
[1:40:31] use him use you as he would see fit
[1:40:37] that's why we have to say when i'm weak
[1:40:41] he's strong the beauty of christ
[1:40:44] increasing in our lives
[1:40:46] is the way we live our lives it's the
[1:40:49] way we experience life
[1:40:53] it's the way others see how we live
[1:40:55] isn't it
[1:40:56] don't you live different when just be
[1:40:58] honest with yourself don't have to raise
[1:40:59] your hand but
[1:41:00] don't you feel good and feel different
[1:41:02] when you know that you're walking
[1:41:04] hand in hand with god when you're
[1:41:07] submitting yourself when you when you
[1:41:08] when you're not working you're not
[1:41:10] placing anything before god
[1:41:11] and you're walking hand in hand with god
[1:41:13] and you can feel him and you know you're
[1:41:15] in a special place with him at that time
[1:41:16] in your life
[1:41:17] don't you feel different
[1:41:22] that's when you're weak you know the
[1:41:25] footprints on the stands of time
[1:41:27] it wasn't that perky it wasn't god left
[1:41:29] that person god was packing that person
[1:41:32] it was in their weakest hour god was
[1:41:34] doing something for them and in our
[1:41:35] weakest hours when god does something
[1:41:37] for us
[1:41:40] when we have christ increasing on our
[1:41:42] soul we become more satisfied
[1:41:44] the things of this world don't matter so
[1:41:46] much anymore you say well i struggle
[1:41:48] with this i struggle with that i
[1:41:49] struggle over here i struggle over there
[1:41:51] you know your struggles
[1:41:52] but the closer you get with god and the
[1:41:54] more you allow him in your life
[1:41:56] the less those things matter they just
[1:41:59] don't
[1:42:00] matter anymore i used to think it was in
[1:42:02] houses
[1:42:03] i used to think it was in lane i used to
[1:42:04] think it was in automobiles it doesn't
[1:42:06] matter those things
[1:42:07] are nothing but it's
[1:42:11] if god is in my life it's god in my life
[1:42:14] of my wife it's god in my children that
[1:42:16] is my heart's desire those are the
[1:42:18] things that have value
[1:42:24] others will look at you and marvel
[1:42:28] at god working in your life when we when
[1:42:31] we hear these stories of david
[1:42:32] and we hear the stories of paul and we
[1:42:35] hear the stories
[1:42:36] of moses and how what they did we marvel
[1:42:39] at that
[1:42:41] that's not just history that's our
[1:42:43] brothers
[1:42:45] that's who you are god chose us in this
[1:42:48] hour he chose people a chosen group of
[1:42:51] people
[1:42:52] to live out that kind of life that you
[1:42:54] would write a testament of
[1:42:56] yourself for god
[1:43:03] being humble being humble
[1:43:10] we've got to give god credit for his
[1:43:12] accomplishments
[1:43:17] that's an image that's an image of
[1:43:19] decreasing so god can increase
[1:43:22] just give god credit
[1:43:26] how do you do that die daily
[1:43:32] paul said i have to die daily brother
[1:43:34] brown said he has to die daily
[1:43:35] i have to die daily we get up we live
[1:43:37] our lives and we go through our routines
[1:43:39] and everything and by the end of the day
[1:43:41] sometimes we are in such a place that we
[1:43:43] just have to say god
[1:43:46] i need to die before you i need to lay
[1:43:49] my life down before you god because
[1:43:51] i didn't do too well today
[1:43:55] i failed over here i felt over there i
[1:43:57] did this i said this i shouldn't have
[1:43:59] done this
[1:44:00] is that just me
[1:44:04] thank you i was feeling nervous
[1:44:08] but we have to be able to to lay
[1:44:10] ourselves down before god and say god
[1:44:13] if i don't die before you i am nobody
[1:44:23] i just want to be able to proclaim him
[1:44:25] as lord as savior
[1:44:27] as forgiver as my god
[1:44:32] the messiah the one to come it's real
[1:44:37] it's he's coming i don't know if i'll
[1:44:40] see it i hope i do i believe i will i
[1:44:42] believe we're at a late hour and i know
[1:44:44] you've heard of some of you all your
[1:44:45] life
[1:44:47] but one thing about it he don't lie so
[1:44:50] it's going to happen
[1:44:55] he's going to come down and catch a
[1:44:58] bride away
[1:45:00] listen at the humility of god before we
[1:45:02] get ready to close
[1:45:04] the humility of god is so great
[1:45:07] but there was a there was a a cross
[1:45:09] called calvary
[1:45:12] you want to talk about descending to
[1:45:15] become
[1:45:16] great god went to a place that he was
[1:45:20] beaten
[1:45:20] he was mocked he was scorned he was spit
[1:45:23] upon
[1:45:24] he took you your pride your arrogance
[1:45:29] my arrogance your my pride my
[1:45:32] my mistakes that i made in life and he
[1:45:34] carried all of that upon his shoulders
[1:45:36] and packed it on a cross up to a hill
[1:45:38] called golgotha
[1:45:40] with up that they beat and spit and
[1:45:42] mocked and scorned him to death
[1:45:45] and then he went there when he died you
[1:45:47] talk about descendant he went down into
[1:45:49] the pits of hell
[1:45:52] and he took those keys from satan
[1:45:55] and he come back up it took greatness he
[1:45:58] overcome on the third day when that tomb
[1:46:00] was open
[1:46:01] god showed i can go down i can carry all
[1:46:04] the sin the weight
[1:46:05] of this world and i will raise myself
[1:46:07] back to greatness
[1:46:12] so there's your there's your way out
[1:46:17] god did that on calvary
[1:46:22] maybe you're sitting today and you think
[1:46:23] man i got so much pride in my life
[1:46:26] i got so much pride in my life i'm just
[1:46:28] like those disciples that was following
[1:46:30] john baptist
[1:46:32] just let go of it die today
[1:46:36] just die today and put it right here on
[1:46:38] the altar and just die and say god i
[1:46:40] don't want this pride in my life anymore
[1:46:41] because i realize
[1:46:43] you can't use me you can't even talk to
[1:46:45] me with such pride
[1:46:47] and arrogance in my life
[1:46:51] maybe you got shame in your life
[1:46:55] well i'm gonna say something sticky here
[1:46:57] how many of you ever been ashamed of the
[1:46:58] message
[1:47:02] you've had an opportunity to say
[1:47:04] something and he was ashamed
[1:47:08] hey i'm i'm probably guilty more than
[1:47:10] any of you
[1:47:11] especially those of you that's been
[1:47:13] raised in a message
[1:47:15] because i've got people that i've got
[1:47:17] friends i've got family i got people
[1:47:18] that know
[1:47:19] nothing of this but was i ashamed to say
[1:47:21] something about it
[1:47:24] god i've got to get rid of that shame
[1:47:27] how can i lead people to christ if i
[1:47:29] can't tell them about the message
[1:47:30] if i'm ashamed to tell them what god's
[1:47:32] done in this hour how will they ever see
[1:47:34] it
[1:47:38] peter had shame it's nothing to be
[1:47:40] ashamed about
[1:47:42] peter had shame he stood there and and
[1:47:44] right there when they asked him hey i
[1:47:45] know
[1:47:46] you he said no i don't i don't know him
[1:47:50] so how could he be a witness
[1:47:55] god had to get a hold of his life
[1:47:59] fear fear
[1:48:02] maybe fear's gripping you maybe you're
[1:48:05] afraid to get up in front of people
[1:48:06] maybe you're afraid to
[1:48:07] maybe you're afraid to sing maybe you're
[1:48:08] afraid to to even praise god you're
[1:48:10] afraid of what somebody will say
[1:48:16] you got to lay that down you got to lay
[1:48:20] that down
[1:48:20] at the altar and say god whatever you
[1:48:23] have me to do it's pulling on my heart
[1:48:25] lord
[1:48:25] you've been there i know there's people
[1:48:27] in here that's been there that god has
[1:48:28] pulled on their heart to do things
[1:48:30] and they don't do it because they're
[1:48:31] afraid of what somebody will think
[1:48:33] say or do
[1:48:39] it's the truth die
[1:48:43] today we die today
[1:48:46] so that god can ascend we die today so
[1:48:49] that god can be great
[1:48:51] not in himself we know god's great the
[1:48:53] world knows god's great they can't deny
[1:48:54] that but i want them to see god great in
[1:48:58] you
[1:49:02] let's stand to our feet if we could i
[1:49:05] just want to be able to say lord
[1:49:09] if there's anything in my life pride
[1:49:11] fear shame doubt
[1:49:13] pray arrogance a lack of commitment
[1:49:18] because i'm committed to other things
[1:49:19] maybe i just want to be able to say lord
[1:49:21] if there's anything that's causing me
[1:49:23] not to allow you to be magnified through
[1:49:26] me i want to lay it right here on this
[1:49:28] altar
[1:49:29] i want to put it right here where
[1:49:30] there's no more doubt

[1:49:43] early lord and
[1:49:45] i know it's not a jumping shouting
[1:49:46] message but i believe lord there's real
[1:49:50] nutrients in this message there's food
[1:49:52] in there there's the ability to overcome
[1:49:54] the ability to
[1:49:56] to uh get ourselves into a place that
[1:49:58] you could use us
[1:49:59] ability to for us to just surrender
[1:50:01] ourselves lord
[1:50:02] that's what you did for us god you
[1:50:04] surrendered yourself
[1:50:06] for us at calvary and all you ask in
[1:50:09] exchange
[1:50:10] is that we just serve you and love you
[1:50:11] lord and lord we just want to empty
[1:50:13] ourselves out
[1:50:14] this morning and if there's anybody here
[1:50:17] that has
[1:50:17] got anything you know your hang-ups you
[1:50:19] know your faults you know your failures
[1:50:22] you know where you're where you you
[1:50:23] don't allow god completely into your
[1:50:25] life
[1:50:25] to where god could use you maybe god's
[1:50:28] been calling on you with a gift in your
[1:50:29] life maybe a gift of ministry or music
[1:50:31] your heart denied to do it because
[1:50:34] you're afraid your fear you're worried
[1:50:37] what somebody will say
[1:50:38] or do won't you just lay that down today
[1:50:43] lay that down before god in the altar of
[1:50:47] your heart
[1:50:48] and say god from this day forward
[1:50:52] i'm not going to fear what others say
[1:50:53] i'm not going to be ashamed of the
[1:50:55] gospel i'm not going to be ashamed of
[1:50:56] the message
[1:50:57] i'm not going to let my pride stand
[1:50:59] before men i'm not going to be arrogant
[1:51:03] because you and you alone are worthy
