[50:29] the teacher amen
[50:32] how many believes that we need a teacher
[50:36] amen
[50:38] let's read
[50:39] chapter 3
[50:43] and we'll begin
[50:46] with verse 24.
[50:50] wherefore the law was our school master
[50:53] to bring us to christ
[50:56] that we might be justified by faith
[50:59] but after that faith come we are no
[51:01] longer under a schoolmaster
[51:04] for ye are all the children of god by
[51:06] faith in christ jesus
[51:08] for as many of you as have been baptized
[51:12] into christ have put on christ
[51:14] there is neither jew nor greek there is
[51:16] neither bond nor free there is neither
[51:19] male nor female
[51:21] for ye are all one in christ jesus
[51:24] and if you be christ then ye are
[51:26] abraham's seed and heirs according to
[51:29] the promise
[51:30] now notice he was talking about
[51:33] the law bringing us being a school
[51:35] master to bring us to christ now
[51:37] in the next
[51:39] chapter chapter 4 he talks about if we
[51:42] are an heir notice if you be abraham's
[51:44] seed
[51:45] then ye are heirs according to the
[51:48] promise now understand here what he says
[51:50] about the error
[51:52] all right
[51:53] now i say
[51:55] paul says that the heir
[51:57] as long as he is a child right
[52:01] amen
[52:03] difference nothing from a servant though
[52:07] he be lord of all but he's under tutors
[52:10] and governors until the time appointed
[52:13] of the father amen may god that is
[52:15] blessing to the reading of the words you
[52:17] can be seated
[52:20] and then before i start my lesson this
[52:22] morning i want to talk to you about just
[52:24] a couple
[52:25] prophecies that
[52:27] brother branham made some prophecies and
[52:29] the different things that he said
[52:31] uh but you know
[52:33] and and we also of course understand no
[52:35] and
[52:36] and you know even my wife was talking a
[52:39] little bit about about it this morning
[52:40] and she was saying how she's so thankful
[52:43] to be an american and have the liberty
[52:45] and the freedom that we have amen and i
[52:47] says yes we do enjoy it but we do know
[52:51] that these liberties and things will be
[52:53] taken from us
[52:55] he knows that
[52:57] and so and it's happening it's really
[52:59] happening these prophecies and things
[53:01] that the bible talked about
[53:02] amen
[53:04] will be taken away and i told her i said
[53:06] you know even to where
[53:08] you know even to where you won't be able
[53:10] to buy or sell
[53:12] unless you
[53:13] belong to the organization amen
[53:16] and
[53:17] and so forth or the system so to speak
[53:20] amen and so
[53:27] i want to just to read a couple of these
[53:28] here just to kind of get us on our toes
[53:30] because as a minister as a as a pastor
[53:33] of course we as christians as they all
[53:36] we need to watch the signs of the times
[53:38] don't we
[53:39] we need to see what's happening around
[53:41] us and what's going on
[53:42] you know and i want to just say that i
[53:45] think one of the latest things that
[53:48] uh you know we talk about government
[53:50] overreach and things like that
[53:54] you know to make it mandatory and and
[53:56] and i believe it was biden that said you
[53:58] know that he made it mandatory that any
[54:02] uh job people that have jobs and so
[54:04] forth any
[54:05] uh business i believe it is that has
[54:08] like over a hundred employees
[54:10] that they have to make it mandatory
[54:12] right
[54:14] that they have to make it mandatory that
[54:16] uh that they get vaccinated you know
[54:19] and that's just that's all that is is a
[54:21] little feeler
[54:23] right
[54:24] because you know
[54:25] that it's not gonna stop at a hundred
[54:28] huh next time it'll be anybody that has
[54:30] five or two it'll be everybody right
[54:33] i mean you know it's just putting those
[54:35] fillers out if you can get away with
[54:37] that then you know look at what what's
[54:40] coming next right and so we already know
[54:43] that there's maybe i hope hopefully
[54:45] nobody here but people actually losing
[54:48] their livelihood
[54:50] right
[54:51] and it's affecting your pocketbook
[54:52] unless you do what
[54:54] is not you know not valid some of the
[54:57] and this is the thing of it we know that
[54:59] we have a a law we have there's a lot of
[55:03] laws that we don't even know know about
[55:04] that are passed that i'm going to read
[55:06] to you about that the prophet knew about
[55:08] that had already been
[55:10] that have already been passed
[55:12] and you you don't realize that we don't
[55:15] realize a lot of times when uh perhaps
[55:18] even with this
[55:19] what do they call this new
[55:21] uh
[55:22] this um
[55:24] loan they're getting for 3.5 million
[55:26] that they want to do a reconciliation or
[55:29] whatever you know and it's a 29 paid 2
[55:32] 900 page law that they're
[55:35] putting into fact what's all in that
[55:37] 2900 pages that's a lot of pages right
[55:41] and so but that's been going on for many
[55:44] years you know right and in those pages
[55:46] and all those things uh you know they
[55:48] put things to where uh you don't even
[55:50] know the laws that there and i'm going
[55:51] to read you a couple that'll be shocking
[55:53] to you that the prophet knew about but
[55:55] like i told my wife it says you know
[55:57] it'll come down to where you know you
[55:58] won't be able to buy or sell unless you
[56:00] belong and i you know to me it just puts
[56:03] my
[56:04] uh
[56:05] my um
[56:07] be ready my b be aware up
[56:10] because perhaps it'll be a lot smoother
[56:13] than what we think right it'll be more
[56:15] slick
[56:16] the mark of the beast and things will be
[56:18] a lot more slick than what you
[56:19] anticipate
[56:21] you know
[56:22] and so it'll be it'll be you know it'll
[56:24] definitely be smooth it'll it won't be
[56:26] something that'll look like the muck of
[56:28] the beast
[56:29] but unless you know and unless you're
[56:31] aware of it you'll know not to you
[56:33] people will partake of it folks i'm here
[56:34] to tell you when it comes to livelihood
[56:36] people are probably going to take them
[56:38] shots it's my livelihood i'll take the
[56:40] shot
[56:40] and it's probably nothing wrong with it
[56:42] you know
[56:44] i'm going to put i'm going to give you a
[56:46] little bit of
[56:47] a little bit
[56:49] of ease
[56:50] you know because we know trump tries to
[56:53] take the the
[56:55] the credit for this pizza or whatever
[56:58] vaccine that they come up with you know
[57:00] so
[57:01] you know because you know you don't want
[57:03] to take something from somebody you
[57:04] don't trust
[57:06] and that's why we're so leery of it
[57:07] right
[57:09] but anyway but that's just a vaccine but
[57:11] you know
[57:12] what if it goes in numb we know that
[57:13] it'll go into something else other than
[57:15] just a vaccine
[57:17] you know and i i love the joke somebody
[57:19] said about you know he says we gotta
[57:21] protect ourselves from the unvaccinated
[57:24] somebody said well isn't that what the
[57:25] shot's supposed to do
[57:27] yeah i thought that was pretty good you
[57:29] know yeah you get vaccinated that's
[57:30] supposed to take care of it no no no we
[57:32] gotta protect yourself from that hell
[57:34] but anyway so but i'm just saying that
[57:36] look at that look at how it's coming in
[57:38] amen now let's know what the prophet of
[57:41] god says now the jews united themselves
[57:43] against jesus and against his
[57:45] messiahship
[57:46] and his messiah message and we see the
[57:49] same thing happening now the same thing
[57:52] communism is uniting to destroy the
[57:56] church
[57:57] how many knows that this is this far
[57:59] left move is communism
[58:01] 100
[58:03] that's right and one thing they hate is
[58:05] christianity anything with christianity
[58:08] they hate it
[58:10] anybody you know and the only way that
[58:14] this is after the church has united
[58:15] itself to the world council of churches
[58:18] the world council of churches to deny
[58:20] and to destroy the message
[58:23] all right they have turned down the word
[58:26] how many knows the church world has
[58:28] absolutely turned jesus christ away
[58:32] it didn't matter how many signs how much
[58:34] discernment i know how much that jesus
[58:37] christ could let me just say this
[58:40] the fullness of jesus christ came back
[58:42] into the church in your age and my age
[58:45] through the prophet of malachi 4. what i
[58:48] mean by that is
[58:49] jesus come back and he dis like he did
[58:52] with the woman at the well you've had
[58:54] five husbands in the one you're living
[58:56] with now it's not yours and so on and so
[58:58] on she says well we know when the
[59:00] messiah comes he'll do these things and
[59:03] he said i am he and she ran into the
[59:05] city and convinced the whole city that
[59:08] he was the messiah because of this
[59:09] testimony
[59:11] well jesus has come the very same way
[59:13] because remember he said when the holy
[59:15] ghost comes and does the things and you
[59:18] speak against that it won't be forgiving
[59:20] in this world of the world to come
[59:22] amen so we know that the holy spirit has
[59:24] come again in the church in the
[59:27] preachers in the prophets and he has
[59:29] come in a more fuller way than john
[59:31] wesley or martin luther or those reforms
[59:34] but he come in form and for seven times
[59:36] around the world this deserves and these
[59:39] miracles and this
[59:40] infallible proof that jesus was alive
[59:43] and that it was him and that right and
[59:46] yet in all of that the churches were too
[59:49] blind to see it
[59:51] to recognize that it's not brother
[59:53] branham it's not a prophet it's not my
[59:55] life it's jesus christ in the church
[59:57] doing the very same works that he did
[59:59] when he was here on earth
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:03] and so you know and and the church world
[1:00:05] turned him turned christ down i mean he
[1:00:08] knows that so they now notice they have
[1:00:11] turned down
[1:00:13] the word the churches have they cannot
[1:00:16] accept it because it's against their
[1:00:18] denominational creed
[1:00:21] this is true if they played message
[1:00:23] state it would condemn their very church
[1:00:27] because they teach things that's
[1:00:28] contrary to the bible that's what it
[1:00:30] condemns
[1:00:32] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:00:34] of men
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:36] and so they can't accept it they didn't
[1:00:39] accept it and because it didn't come
[1:00:41] their way the way they thought it should
[1:00:42] come they turned it out
[1:00:45] amen because of that jesus christ has
[1:00:47] spewed him out of their mouth it means
[1:00:49] he's not in there anymore now they
[1:00:51] cannot accept it because it's against
[1:00:53] the denominational crete no matter how
[1:00:55] many pillars of fire
[1:00:57] hello no matter how many pillars of fire
[1:01:00] the fbi went investigated this year
[1:01:03] at the head of the fbi and they seen if
[1:01:05] it was any double exposure or anything
[1:01:07] he says no that was they declared it was
[1:01:09] the only supernatural light that's ever
[1:01:11] been photographed
[1:01:13] they even they verified that pillar fire
[1:01:16] the fbi did and no matter how many
[1:01:18] pillars of fire would hang in the midst
[1:01:19] of the people or how many people would
[1:01:21] be how many uh things would be foretold
[1:01:24] to happen and all the great signs that
[1:01:26] he promised of the last day they cannot
[1:01:29] do it therefore they are uniting
[1:01:31] themselves now and your pastor here and
[1:01:34] many of them you can tell them to
[1:01:36] can tell you this reading that they have
[1:01:38] an ecumenical movement of the world
[1:01:41] there's a lutheran minute lutheran
[1:01:42] minister over and if there comes a
[1:01:45] disaster what happened in this
[1:01:47] neighborhood here and he was talking
[1:01:49] about this is in paperwork now already
[1:01:52] this is already in law because we know
[1:01:53] that we have a little common law and
[1:01:55] then we have a
[1:01:57] a law that is under a what is a disaster
[1:02:01] right emergency
[1:02:02] if if a state declares a state of
[1:02:05] emergency we go into a different mode
[1:02:07] we've already experienced that isn't
[1:02:08] that right people can just pretty much
[1:02:10] make their own law
[1:02:12] amen and just the supreme court just got
[1:02:15] finished upholding some of those things
[1:02:17] that people have made hello so it goes
[1:02:20] to show you now notice so he says in
[1:02:22] this neighborhood if there was a
[1:02:23] disaster if we are not united with that
[1:02:26] ecumenical move then our church can no
[1:02:29] more be church
[1:02:31] and they can use it for a storeroom
[1:02:34] or if one of the brothers would be
[1:02:36] somebody would be dying or hurt and try
[1:02:39] to minister it to him any spiritual
[1:02:41] blessing
[1:02:43] we could be shot for it
[1:02:45] exactly right we can be given 10 years
[1:02:48] in federal prison for ministering
[1:02:50] anything because we're not a member of
[1:02:53] that ecumenical move
[1:02:56] how many knows this woke thing it's
[1:02:57] something that's woke up already because
[1:03:00] you know if you don't agree with them
[1:03:02] well they just rather you died
[1:03:05] you just rather have you dead they have
[1:03:07] no mercy for you whatsoever
[1:03:09] right
[1:03:10] so you look at that now don't you see
[1:03:12] the mark of the beast there see now
[1:03:15] another one in just once more shreveport
[1:03:17] in 1963 he says this jezebel system
[1:03:21] and we know that's what we got
[1:03:23] right
[1:03:24] now blind spiritually to the word of god
[1:03:27] joining themselves right into the
[1:03:28] council of churches everything our great
[1:03:31] evangelical teaching we have to forfeit
[1:03:34] that to be an organization because all
[1:03:36] of the organizations that isn't in this
[1:03:38] council of churches i got the paper on
[1:03:40] it that even if your church is not in
[1:03:43] this council of churches in time of
[1:03:46] trouble they can use your church to
[1:03:48] store ammunition or anything they want
[1:03:50] to
[1:03:51] and if any man is caught praying for
[1:03:53] anybody outside of affiliation with this
[1:03:55] council of churches can be shot
[1:03:59] as a federal offense
[1:04:04] that's right i got the papers on it in
[1:04:06] washington see
[1:04:08] they're going to force it into
[1:04:10] force you into it and that's why i've
[1:04:12] been against the organizational system
[1:04:15] that's right now i've had to keep quiet
[1:04:17] about it being the mark of the beast but
[1:04:19] it's too late now it's late enough now
[1:04:21] until you can know that it's the truth
[1:04:24] that's exactly right
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:29] so that goes to show you folks
[1:04:31] where we're heading
[1:04:33] how many knows we're hidden
[1:04:35] it's going that way that direction to
[1:04:37] where they will force force you
[1:04:41] to do what they want you to do
[1:04:43] amen but it also goes to show you how
[1:04:45] late the hour is
[1:04:47] amen
[1:04:48] and where we should be amen
[1:04:52] and how that we have patiently waited
[1:04:55] for this time we have preached for 30
[1:04:58] years here from this public that i've
[1:05:00] been waiting
[1:05:01] for these things to happen because these
[1:05:03] things that's been prophesied these
[1:05:04] scriptures that are written in the bible
[1:05:06] this you know because we know one thing
[1:05:08] is for sure it's going to happen the way
[1:05:11] this book said it's going to happen
[1:05:14] you can put that in the bank right
[1:05:16] because you know that this is not wrong
[1:05:18] and so when it comes down to where you
[1:05:20] can't well they won't you know
[1:05:22] you might not you might not be shocked
[1:05:24] for just having church but you cross one
[1:05:26] of their other things they'll shoot you
[1:05:28] or whatever and they'll certainly play
[1:05:31] on your pocketbook amen you won't be
[1:05:33] able to have this that or the other and
[1:05:35] all of your church you'll just take it
[1:05:37] away from you if they want to
[1:05:39] so don't hold on to anything in this
[1:05:41] world too tight
[1:05:43] amen so let's get on the subject this
[1:05:45] morning i felt like just teaching a
[1:05:46] little bit on the teacher amen and we
[1:05:49] want to just look a couple scriptures
[1:05:51] here about this teacher because we see
[1:05:53] how that here paul is saying that uh you
[1:05:56] know whenever you get born again when
[1:05:58] you have experienced a new birth
[1:06:01] and i'm just uh if i might just put it
[1:06:03] away let me just read up
[1:06:06] say it the way the prophet of god said
[1:06:07] it and i want to first go back and read
[1:06:09] his quote on what he said about the old
[1:06:10] testament and how that what this tutor
[1:06:12] ship come from back in the old testament
[1:06:15] a father he maybe he owned a great
[1:06:17] portion of ground on this he had little
[1:06:19] buildings and in there he had servants
[1:06:22] amen when his son was born into his
[1:06:24] family this son as soon as he was born
[1:06:26] he was a son
[1:06:28] because he was born a son now this may
[1:06:30] be a little strange but i trust that you
[1:06:32] take it and look at it first he says
[1:06:34] when the pentecostal church and the full
[1:06:36] gospel people received the holy ghost
[1:06:39] they said this is it we're born into the
[1:06:42] kingdom of god and that's all settled
[1:06:44] but abram says that's in ever
[1:06:47] amen it's not all settled it's not all
[1:06:50] done how many knows god begins to work
[1:06:52] on you there
[1:06:54] that's when you are a little child
[1:06:57] you're just starting to grow
[1:06:59] this morning i want to talk about how
[1:07:01] sometimes we are so hard on our children
[1:07:04] i mean as even as teenagers sometimes
[1:07:06] boy if they're not perfect we'll climb
[1:07:08] all over them
[1:07:10] what in the world
[1:07:12] and all you got to do is look in the
[1:07:14] mirror a little bit of what you would
[1:07:15] like it as a teenager and you say whoa
[1:07:18] me i was a lot worse than that person
[1:07:21] ever thought of being
[1:07:22] but yet we're judgmental we tend to be
[1:07:24] so hard and that right
[1:07:26] amen and we gotta just realize that hey
[1:07:28] when we're born again folks that's just
[1:07:30] the beginning of it all right
[1:07:33] so he says here that's right he says
[1:07:35] listen
[1:07:36] um
[1:07:37] that is an heir when a son was born into
[1:07:39] the family that's true he was the son of
[1:07:41] his birth but this father he was so busy
[1:07:43] he had so much to do so he looked out
[1:07:46] through all of the country and he got
[1:07:48] the best tutor that he could find
[1:07:50] a man to educate his son and to raise up
[1:07:53] his son and to make him the right kind
[1:07:56] of boy
[1:07:57] or can we say the right kind of girl
[1:08:01] how typical that is of our heavenly
[1:08:03] father when his children is born into
[1:08:04] the kingdom they're not given a bishop
[1:08:07] huh
[1:08:09] i'm going to put pastor in there
[1:08:11] is that right
[1:08:13] not given some earthly person but god
[1:08:16] the father has given the best tutor
[1:08:18] the church could have the holy spirit
[1:08:24] how many is that this morning to realize
[1:08:27] that you have on board if you've got the
[1:08:29] baptism of the holy ghost you have got a
[1:08:33] teacher you've got your tutor you've got
[1:08:36] your teacher with you
[1:08:38] 24 7.
[1:08:47] so what did your teacher teach you last
[1:08:48] week
[1:08:52] huh
[1:08:53] last month
[1:08:56] all right
[1:08:58] let me just say this
[1:09:01] all right so he gave tutor to church
[1:09:03] have the holy spirit as a raiser of the
[1:09:05] church when he comes he will teach you
[1:09:07] and guide you into all truth the holy
[1:09:10] spirit now when this
[1:09:12] when this duty this teacher of raising
[1:09:14] the son was to bring word to the father
[1:09:18] again of how that he had progressed his
[1:09:21] concept determined his inheritance if he
[1:09:24] was a good son he would inherit all that
[1:09:26] the father had but he was if not a good
[1:09:29] son then he wasn't given nothing because
[1:09:31] he wasn't worthy oh my
[1:09:35] my goodness
[1:09:39] now according to the prophet y'all know
[1:09:42] hear him in different places he taught
[1:09:44] and the scripture tells us amen that
[1:09:46] there is a place of adoption we are
[1:09:48] called to the adoption of children by
[1:09:51] jesus christ above paul says amen so you
[1:09:54] know i got to thinking of how that we're
[1:09:56] learning and learning more and more
[1:10:00] let me establish first of all that this
[1:10:02] scripture and what i'm saying is true
[1:10:06] in saint john i believe it's the 14th
[1:10:08] chapter jesus said if any man love me he
[1:10:11] will keep my words and my father will
[1:10:13] love him and he will come unto him and
[1:10:15] make our abode with him
[1:10:17] amen he that loveth me not keepeth not
[1:10:20] my saying
[1:10:21] now one of the things that we want to
[1:10:23] teach here is that one of the things
[1:10:24] that god tries to get us to do one of
[1:10:27] the things that he teaches us is to be
[1:10:29] obedient to the word of god
[1:10:32] you're either an obedient child or
[1:10:34] you're a disobedient child
[1:10:40] amen let me tell you something
[1:10:42] maybe just a little ahead of time here
[1:10:44] but you would not believe how many
[1:10:46] bastard children are out there how many
[1:10:49] disobedient children are out there
[1:10:51] but notice and he that loveth me not
[1:10:54] keepeth not my sayings and the word
[1:10:56] which you hear is not mine but the
[1:10:58] father which has sent me
[1:10:59] these things have i spoken unto you
[1:11:01] being yet present with you but the
[1:11:04] comforter which is the holy ghost whom
[1:11:06] the father will send in my name he will
[1:11:09] teach
[1:11:12] amen
[1:11:14] he will teach you
[1:11:16] all things
[1:11:20] and bring things all things to your
[1:11:23] remembrance how we can stop there and
[1:11:26] how that we all know that most of the
[1:11:28] time in a lot of times when we are in
[1:11:31] dealing with the holy ghost there's so
[1:11:33] many times that he'll bring things back
[1:11:35] to our remembrance remember this
[1:11:38] remember that
[1:11:41] because we are forgetful people
[1:11:43] it takes the holy spirit to bring back
[1:11:46] to our remembrance what god said hear
[1:11:47] about this what god said about that but
[1:11:50] you know as many times school children
[1:11:54] we don't listen to god
[1:11:57] we don't hear what the teacher is saying
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:03] and i like this because we have an on
[1:12:06] board teacher
[1:12:10] teacher
[1:12:11] that i thinks teaching you things i
[1:12:13] can't teach you
[1:12:15] amen
[1:12:19] amen
[1:12:21] that only the holy spirit
[1:12:23] can teach you over in first john 2 and
[1:12:25] verse 27 but concerning but the
[1:12:28] anointing which you have received of him
[1:12:30] abideth
[1:12:31] in you
[1:12:32] and ye need not that any man teach you
[1:12:36] but as the same anointing teaches you
[1:12:39] of
[1:12:40] all things isn't that something other
[1:12:44] scriptures dovetailed together
[1:12:46] and is truth and is no lie and even as
[1:12:50] it has taught you you shall abide in him
[1:12:54] what does it say it shall lead you and
[1:12:56] guides you
[1:12:57] into all truth
[1:13:02] amen
[1:13:08] so notice and just because that you have
[1:13:10] received the holy ghost that doesn't
[1:13:12] mean that everything's just going to be
[1:13:13] poured out into your hands that's the
[1:13:15] reason if the church would just get
[1:13:16] quiet just a little bit
[1:13:18] and quit trying to say i'm assembly of
[1:13:20] god i'm oneness i'm trinitarian i'm this
[1:13:22] i'm down to the other
[1:13:24] i mean i know if we just sit quiet
[1:13:28] if we just be still
[1:13:30] hold still and learn the holy ghost
[1:13:33] could teach us something
[1:13:35] amen how many believes that he could
[1:13:38] teach us something if we
[1:13:40] would just learn in first corinthians
[1:13:42] the third chapter paul said
[1:13:45] for who has known the mind of the lord
[1:13:47] that he may instruct him but we have the
[1:13:49] mind of christ and brethren when i could
[1:13:52] not speak unto you as spiritual but as
[1:13:55] unto carnal even as unto babes in christ
[1:14:00] i have fed you with milk and not meat
[1:14:02] wherefore hitherto you were not able to
[1:14:04] bear neither are ye now able to bear it
[1:14:06] ye are yet carnal for whereas among you
[1:14:09] envying in strife and divisions are you
[1:14:13] not carnal and walk as men
[1:14:16] for one saith i am of paul i am apollos
[1:14:19] are you not carnal amen
[1:14:22] he says you know i have planted paul is
[1:14:24] watered but it's god that gives
[1:14:26] increase in other words there are still
[1:14:29] divisions i mean let me tell you
[1:14:30] something as long as there's still
[1:14:32] divisions in the church body there is
[1:14:35] still carnality
[1:14:38] people are still in their
[1:14:40] diapers still babes
[1:14:44] when you go to gossiping and running
[1:14:46] everybody down or this out of the other
[1:14:48] you aren't grown yet you haven't even
[1:14:50] learned how to control this right here
[1:14:53] control your tongue you haven't to learn
[1:14:55] to control your mind
[1:14:58] amen
[1:15:00] praise be to god
[1:15:02] oh my i got to thinking about this and i
[1:15:04] got to thinking of how that you know
[1:15:07] you know that we we we tend to be
[1:15:10] uh dogmatic many times
[1:15:13] you know
[1:15:14] and i've known i'm just going to say
[1:15:16] i've known i know people in this message
[1:15:20] you know and i don't want nobody to get
[1:15:22] the picture of who because i'm not here
[1:15:23] to preach against anybody but i'm just
[1:15:26] here to tell you there's people amen
[1:15:28] that have been in here for close to
[1:15:30] probably 50 years
[1:15:33] but when you robbed them the wrong way
[1:15:37] you robbed that person the wrong way all
[1:15:39] of a sudden you're you ain't even got
[1:15:41] the holy ghost you're not saved you're
[1:15:43] not a believer you're you're you know
[1:15:46] you're a judas
[1:15:49] they destroy you can you imagine if a
[1:15:52] person like that was given the power of
[1:15:55] the spoken word i wouldn't want to be
[1:15:57] anywhere close to him would you
[1:16:01] no
[1:16:02] amen and so god has to bring us to a
[1:16:04] certain place and i wonder even the
[1:16:06] problem said you know the baptist and
[1:16:07] methodist we ought to be at this place
[1:16:10] where god can adopt us because how many
[1:16:12] believe we're going to go into a rapture
[1:16:14] one of these days
[1:16:15] joseph the bible says that they're going
[1:16:17] to not be you're not going to be able to
[1:16:19] buy or sell
[1:16:21] so the bible also says we which are
[1:16:23] alive and remain unto his coming shall
[1:16:25] not prevent them with your sleep but we
[1:16:27] will be changed in the moment in the
[1:16:28] twinkling of an eye in that right
[1:16:31] we're going to be caught up together to
[1:16:33] meet the lord in the air and so shall we
[1:16:35] ever be with the lord
[1:16:37] oh my the closer that comes to that
[1:16:39] place that you can't by herself the
[1:16:42] closer it is to the coming of the lord
[1:16:44] how he believes that
[1:16:46] the more the squeeze comes down the more
[1:16:48] the pressure comes down the closer it is
[1:16:50] to the coming of the lord it's a road
[1:16:52] sign telling you we're almost there
[1:16:55] folks
[1:16:56] amen if sodom and gomorrah had to get in
[1:16:58] that condition if the days of noah had
[1:17:00] to get in that condition such a horrible
[1:17:02] condition the sons of men saw the
[1:17:04] daughters of men and man's thoughts were
[1:17:07] continually evil
[1:17:09] then it's got to be that way again
[1:17:11] before he brings the fire down
[1:17:14] and folks you talk about a fire
[1:17:18] amen
[1:17:21] i don't want to be nowhere around when
[1:17:22] the fire of god begins to fall to you
[1:17:25] it's going to burn like you ain't never
[1:17:27] seen
[1:17:29] amen
[1:17:31] but how many is glad to be in the house
[1:17:32] of god where the fire is falling now
[1:17:35] the fire of the holy spirit is falling
[1:17:38] today on us
[1:17:40] what's it doing
[1:17:41] as same consuming fire which we know god
[1:17:44] is a consuming fire right that same holy
[1:17:47] spirit is consuming everything in here
[1:17:50] that's not supposed to be
[1:17:52] there
[1:17:54] are you with me
[1:17:55] we come to church this morning so that
[1:17:57] the holy spirit can consume everything
[1:17:59] that doesn't fit in
[1:18:01] over there
[1:18:03] we come to not be children anymore
[1:18:06] praise be to god but let the teacher
[1:18:08] teach us
[1:18:11] amen what if i next sunday
[1:18:14] wanted you to have a piece of paper

[1:18:26] brother brother i got nothing
[1:18:30] what would i tell you as your pastor i
[1:18:32] probably tell you you really need to

[1:18:41] knows god the holy spirit is working
[1:18:43] with you he's working with every one of
[1:18:46] us every day trying to teach you

[1:19:17] lot more of you because i know there's a
[1:19:19] lot sitting out there that the holy
[1:19:20] spirit has taught you a whole lot
[1:19:21] already
[1:19:23] ah
[1:19:24] learning to lead learning to lead i'm
[1:19:28] learning to lead on jesus
[1:19:32] finding more power than i ever dreamed
[1:19:35] because why i'm
[1:19:39] learning to lean
[1:19:41] we're learning to trust i've learned to
[1:19:44] trust in god
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:47] i've learned to believe his word to
[1:19:49] trust in him he has taught us that no
[1:19:52] matter what comes your way
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:55] no matter how much people mistreats you
[1:19:58] amen that you're supposed to love them
[1:20:00] anyway
[1:20:01] the only way you could ever love them
[1:20:03] anyway is to never let it get to you
[1:20:07] never let it bother the second that you
[1:20:09] let that get to you they got you
[1:20:14] and people will do stuff to you just to
[1:20:16] get you mad
[1:20:19] no christians
[1:20:21] yeah
[1:20:25] that's when your flags go up right this
[1:20:28] guy's supposed to be a christian right
[1:20:31] and not everybody that clean name of
[1:20:33] christ a christian you find out right
[1:20:35] quick
[1:20:36] i'm here to tell you you don't always
[1:20:38] know what spirit people are sometimes
[1:20:40] you don't know what spirit you're off
[1:20:43] amen everybody disagrees anybody wraps
[1:20:45] you wrong boy you're ready to destroy
[1:20:47] him
[1:20:48] even the prophet of god had to come to
[1:20:49] the place
[1:20:52] to where he could look at that young
[1:20:53] couple that was kissing all over each
[1:20:56] other and they had been corrected two or
[1:20:57] three times and they were worthy of
[1:20:59] being said they'll carry you out like
[1:21:01] ananias and savara and i grant you there
[1:21:03] ain't going to be no more kissing around
[1:21:05] this church
[1:21:06] drop dead nobody else would be doing no
[1:21:08] kissing in church
[1:21:10] but he didn't do it that way didn't he
[1:21:13] no very unusual right
[1:21:16] because the other prophet that i
[1:21:17] remember was the name of elisha
[1:21:19] elijah he had a ball they didn't have
[1:21:22] any hey
[1:21:22] [Music]
[1:21:24] he couldn't help that he didn't have any
[1:21:26] bare hair and them kids
[1:21:28] had heard their mom and daddy mock him
[1:21:31] on the dinner table and said he claimed
[1:21:33] to be a servant of god that ball to it
[1:21:37] so when the kids got out there he says
[1:21:39] go on up ball head like elijah did go on
[1:21:42] up bald head
[1:21:43] huh
[1:21:45] and what did he have did he have love he
[1:21:47] had no love at all i curse you in the
[1:21:49] name of god and god has to honor the
[1:21:51] prophet's word
[1:21:52] god always honors the prophet word
[1:21:55] huh
[1:21:57] and then poor innocent kids
[1:22:00] because kids just do what they learn
[1:22:04] i'll tell you who should have dropped
[1:22:05] dead with the parents at home that's who
[1:22:07] should have got mauled
[1:22:09] but no because of that because he cursed
[1:22:11] them god destroyed 42 of them
[1:22:14] folks i'm here to tell you it wasn't no
[1:22:16] pretty a picture to have a bunch of
[1:22:18] couple of she bears coming out of the
[1:22:19] woods and tear them them kids to pieces
[1:22:22] but it did
[1:22:23] but it wasn't the right thing to do
[1:22:26] amen
[1:22:27] come on let's just admit it that's what
[1:22:29] we do a lot of times if we aren't
[1:22:30] careful
[1:22:32] we still ain't got the love that we
[1:22:33] should have
[1:22:35] you ain't a mature christian folks you
[1:22:37] haven't you aren't ready to graduate you
[1:22:39] ain't ready to have the gods come and
[1:22:42] speak to you and say say what you will
[1:22:44] and it'll be done
[1:22:47] unless you've got that perfect love in
[1:22:48] your heart
[1:22:50] are you with me
[1:22:52] and you can only learn whether you got
[1:22:54] that or not when people rub you wrong
[1:22:58] it goes against your grain 100
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:04] that's right so i'm thankful i'm be
[1:23:07] thankful for what god has taught you
[1:23:09] it meant through trials
[1:23:11] every sunday comes has to be tried and
[1:23:13] tested
[1:23:14] amen you have to learn
[1:23:17] things the preacher can't teach you
[1:23:21] that's right
[1:23:23] because there's nothing like
[1:23:26] hands-on experience
[1:23:30] like learning from experience
[1:23:33] experience is the best
[1:23:35] teacher
[1:23:36] folks how many know many of us have to
[1:23:38] admit
[1:23:39] some of us might brag about how
[1:23:41] hard-headed we are
[1:23:43] yeah i am so hard-headed let me tell you
[1:23:46] if you're a human being you're so
[1:23:47] hard-headed
[1:23:49] everywhere every human being is
[1:23:50] hard-headed
[1:23:53] every human being can be super evil
[1:23:56] huh
[1:23:58] nothing to brag about the human part
[1:24:01] the only thing worth bragging about is
[1:24:02] the christ part what god does through
[1:24:05] you amen
[1:24:07] but we have to learn the hard way how
[1:24:09] many says say i gotta most of the time
[1:24:11] the only way i learn
[1:24:12] is the hard way
[1:24:16] well
[1:24:17] in a way that's good in another way it's
[1:24:19] not but let me tell you something even
[1:24:20] god has to put you
[1:24:22] through the trial so that you can learn
[1:24:25] the hard way
[1:24:27] amen israel they thought oh hallelujah
[1:24:30] praise god shaking and shouting they got
[1:24:33] plum horse they were so happy leaving
[1:24:35] egypt
[1:24:36] first thing god did was try to teach
[1:24:38] them something
[1:24:40] remember the bible says they have not
[1:24:41] known my ways
[1:24:44] they don't know me very well
[1:24:46] let me tell you something if you're
[1:24:47] gonna know anything about god when you
[1:24:49] claim the name of christianity you can
[1:24:52] know this one thing
[1:24:53] god is gonna find out whether you got
[1:24:55] what you claim to have or not
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:00] now i'm going to tell you this right now
[1:25:02] any leader at all is not fit to lead
[1:25:04] until he's been through these things
[1:25:06] that's why he talks about a pastor not
[1:25:07] being no novice
[1:25:09] huh
[1:25:11] was 29 years old and i was almost too
[1:25:14] green
[1:25:15] right
[1:25:17] i have to learn a lot of stuff yet the
[1:25:19] hard way
[1:25:20] things i would never do today amen
[1:25:24] but no remember what i'm saying is
[1:25:26] you're worthy of leading once you have
[1:25:28] proven yourself
[1:25:31] once you have went through the hall of
[1:25:33] critics
[1:25:34] i mean those nobody goes to the hall of
[1:25:36] fame unless you first go through the
[1:25:38] hall of creeks
[1:25:41] everybody that you can think of
[1:25:43] criticizing you like job i secret sinner
[1:25:46] you've asked you that that couldn't
[1:25:48] happen to a christian man and oh my god
[1:25:50] everybody tries to fall find all the
[1:25:53] fault in you they possibly can
[1:25:57] huh they did jesus

[1:26:02] him in here they always watching amen
[1:26:04] for every fault you know

[1:26:10] fame too you went through the hall of
[1:26:11] critics
[1:26:13] amen but i love it because listen the
[1:26:15] one thing that we learn is to learn to
[1:26:18] lean on him
[1:26:20] learn to trust him
[1:26:24] amen
[1:26:25] not on your own ability
[1:26:27] but on god's ability
[1:26:30] and learn this other thing and that is
[1:26:32] endurance how many believes you have to
[1:26:33] learn endurance
[1:26:38] let me just go to
[1:26:40] hebrews i'm going to talk about
[1:26:42] endurance

[1:26:57] running with the devil
[1:26:59] on the highway to hell that's right
[1:27:01] i'm glad i wasn't in that state when
[1:27:03] jesus come
[1:27:05] he had mercy and grace on me amen
[1:27:07] aren't you glad for that

[1:27:28] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:27:30] that was set down before him endured the
[1:27:34] cross despising the shame and he sat
[1:27:37] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:27:39] god for consider him that endured such
[1:27:42] contradiction of sinners against himself
[1:27:44] least ye be weary and fate in your
[1:27:48] minds you have not yet resisted unto
[1:27:50] blood striving against sin and have you
[1:27:52] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[1:27:54] unto you as children
[1:27:56] my son despise thou not the chastening
[1:27:59] of the lord nor faint with our rebuked
[1:28:01] of him for whom the lord loveth he
[1:28:04] chastens us and scourges every son whom
[1:28:06] he receiveth
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:13] amen i heard brother brown says man why
[1:28:15] people say why are you always scolding
[1:28:17] people why are you always so hard on
[1:28:19] people why are you always rebuking them
[1:28:22] can somebody in here telling me why he
[1:28:24] was always rebuking them
[1:28:28] because he loved him
[1:28:32] huh
[1:28:35] most of the time when somebody rebukes
[1:28:36] us for our sin
[1:28:38] oh the first thing we do is think about
[1:28:41] that person in his sin right
[1:28:43] well you ain't feel good yourself
[1:28:46] right
[1:28:48] rather than saying
[1:28:50] thank you brother thank you sister
[1:28:52] i appreciate that
[1:28:54] because i don't want that in my life i
[1:28:55] don't want to be that way our response
[1:28:57] should be i'm sorry brother i'm sorry
[1:28:59] sister that i did that or am that way
[1:29:03] huh
[1:29:04] that's a correct response are you with
[1:29:06] me
[1:29:07] the devil and carnality will try to make
[1:29:09] you look at the other person i'm not
[1:29:10] concerned about the other person right
[1:29:12] now i'm concerned about this person
[1:29:15] amen and rebuke does us good
[1:29:18] amen because it's love even god said in
[1:29:21] revelations as many as i love i rebuke
[1:29:25] oh brother bother you gotta quit
[1:29:27] stepping on my toes when i come to
[1:29:28] church
[1:29:30] no
[1:29:31] no
[1:29:32] you should say thank you
[1:29:34] for stepping on my toes
[1:29:37] huh
[1:29:38] yeah you got i've got faults you can
[1:29:40] look back at my faults when i look at
[1:29:41] your fault be that way if you want
[1:29:45] huh
[1:29:46] i ain't perfect y'all know everybody
[1:29:48] knows but i'm not perfect i sure ain't
[1:29:50] but i'm striving to be let me tell you
[1:29:52] something none of you are perfect and
[1:29:54] i'm not looking at that i'm looking at
[1:29:56] what you want to be
[1:29:58] amen of where we want to be and that's
[1:30:00] the right way to look at folks not
[1:30:02] everybody's in eighth grade or college
[1:30:05] some people just starting
[1:30:08] amen
[1:30:10] so notice here
[1:30:11] every son scourges every son whom he
[1:30:14] receiveth and if you endure chastisement
[1:30:17] god dealeth with you as with sons for
[1:30:20] what son is he that who the father
[1:30:22] chasteneth not correcteth not and if you
[1:30:24] be without chastisement or chastening or
[1:30:26] correction or rebuke then you're oh well
[1:30:30] all are partakers and are you bastards
[1:30:32] and not sons
[1:30:34] brother abandon one place i forget the
[1:30:36] exact words i wanted to look it up but
[1:30:38] he said sometimes he feels like just
[1:30:39] sitting on the top of the pulpit he
[1:30:41] called this whole church while a bunch
[1:30:42] of illegitimate bastards
[1:30:47] he was hard
[1:30:49] i'll have to pull that quote up sometime
[1:30:50] but he was hard
[1:30:53] because that's what they were
[1:30:54] no matter how much jesus would do
[1:30:57] know how much much proof he would give
[1:30:59] him no much how much the scriptures he
[1:31:00] would take they would not be corrected
[1:31:03] they wouldn't be chased eyes they would
[1:31:06] not take karook and there's only one
[1:31:08] category that fits them in and that's
[1:31:09] bastards
[1:31:11] bats are children
[1:31:13] and not sons
[1:31:15] is that right
[1:31:16] because the real son of god
[1:31:18] takes correction
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:22] you don't realize in the old testament
[1:31:24] that if the son would not be corrected
[1:31:26] would not be correct it would not be
[1:31:28] correct and he was rebellious what
[1:31:30] happened to him
[1:31:32] they took him outside and stoned him
[1:31:35] with stones until he drawed his last
[1:31:37] breath
[1:31:38] that's what god thinks of rebellion
[1:31:42] i believe one place the bible says
[1:31:43] rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft
[1:31:46] amen
[1:31:48] my
[1:31:50] my mind
[1:31:51] so that's what this generation
[1:31:54] i mean that's what this generation
[1:31:55] that's what the church world out there
[1:31:57] is
[1:31:58] that's why they have bisexual bishops
[1:32:01] they have homosexuals and everything
[1:32:03] else they allied
[1:32:06] because they never would take correction
[1:32:07] now look at where they are
[1:32:09] like i said wednesday look at the
[1:32:11] condition of the women in the church and
[1:32:13] see what the convert the church is like
[1:32:18] going there to dress like a bunch of
[1:32:19] prostitutes that's what that church is a
[1:32:21] prostitute church
[1:32:22] the preachers have got no more audacity
[1:32:24] than they stand in the pope and say
[1:32:25] anything against it
[1:32:27] no they're getting paid so much a week
[1:32:29] or whatever it is
[1:32:31] huh it's about the money it's not about
[1:32:33] the money folks it's about your soul
[1:32:35] that's what it's all about
[1:32:38] amen when it doesn't it's nothing but of
[1:32:40] the devil
[1:32:42] amen
[1:32:43] all right
[1:32:46] oh my make sure your spirit is right how
[1:32:48] many believe that we got to make sure
[1:32:50] that our spirit
[1:32:52] is right
[1:32:54] many times we don't have tolerance we
[1:32:56] don't have patience how many believe we
[1:32:58] got to have patience with one another
[1:33:02] you cross me and i don't have patience
[1:33:04] with you
[1:33:06] i don't care if i do think that your
[1:33:08] judas is scared i still want to have
[1:33:10] hope for you
[1:33:12] i still want to believe for you
[1:33:15] amen
[1:33:17] jesus did
[1:33:18] he kept going back to those pharisees
[1:33:20] and scribes and pharisees and trying to
[1:33:22] get them converted even after he knew
[1:33:24] they were of their father the devil
[1:33:26] straight up came and said whoa
[1:33:29] let me tell you something you think this
[1:33:30] is strong preaching you you know jesus
[1:33:32] himself down here it'd probably be
[1:33:34] strong when i'm giving it
[1:33:37] he called him they said he were off
[1:33:39] he got him so mad
[1:33:41] that they was gonna kill him
[1:33:43] several times they were gonna kill him
[1:33:46] jesus congregation got so mad they're
[1:33:48] gonna kill him he had to
[1:33:50] get a angel
[1:33:52] to make him invisible
[1:33:55] and the bible says he walks right
[1:33:56] through the midst of them
[1:34:00] they didn't even see him
[1:34:03] praise be to god god is good i mean love
[1:34:05] the lord let's give the lord and say
[1:34:07] thank you jesus
[1:34:08] awesome awesome to serve the lord ain't
[1:34:10] it
[1:34:12] nothing better than the word nothing
[1:34:13] better in the world
[1:34:15] than to get a little proto plasma
[1:34:17] simulation
[1:34:19] nothing better for us than to get a good
[1:34:21] whipping
[1:34:25] i'm talking about let the god correct
[1:34:27] you
[1:34:28] that's right when you do something wrong
[1:34:29] let everything that day for you fall
[1:34:31] apart
[1:34:33] that's right when you get up you step
[1:34:34] your little toe on the edge of the bed
[1:34:36] it hurts like crazy
[1:34:38] huh
[1:34:40] that's right you don't go down the seat
[1:34:42] go down the stairs
[1:34:46] gotta quit
[1:34:47] oh my you missed the last step
[1:34:50] you almost fly out the back door
[1:34:55] it's just everything right
[1:34:57] lord knows how to get your attention
[1:35:00] amen how many wants to be blessed and
[1:35:03] not cursed
[1:35:04] amen you can't live in sin and expect
[1:35:06] the blessings of the lord it's not going
[1:35:08] to happen that way
[1:35:10] got to be right with god
[1:35:12] you gotta listen to that teacher how
[1:35:14] many believes this morning that's my
[1:35:16] message this morning is the teacher
[1:35:18] wants to teach you young people the
[1:35:19] teacher wants to teach you we got a lot
[1:35:21] to learn
[1:35:22] and you have to listen to that voice on
[1:35:24] the inside to learn it
[1:35:29] amen let me go back in time just a
[1:35:32] little bit
[1:35:34] this church was having all the trouble
[1:35:36] all of our trouble that we were having
[1:35:39] i'd get down on my knees sometime and
[1:35:41] say lord give me the answer lord give me
[1:35:43] an answer
[1:35:44] tell me how to do this what to do
[1:35:46] and he'd tell me how to do it
[1:35:48] and i do that
[1:35:50] amen and i'd have deacons and i says do
[1:35:52] you have the answer for it
[1:35:54] do you have the answer for this problem
[1:35:56] i have to get it i think you have to get
[1:35:58] it too
[1:35:59] i think you need the right answer
[1:36:00] because if you don't have the right
[1:36:01] answer you're going to do the wrong
[1:36:03] thing
[1:36:04] when you do the wrong thing you're
[1:36:05] dearly going to pay for it
[1:36:07] huh
[1:36:08] how many believes we've got to have the
[1:36:09] holy spirit to tell us the right thing
[1:36:12] and sometimes that don't come easy but
[1:36:14] it comes if you really search it
[1:36:17] you'll really find out what is lord what
[1:36:19] is it because this is what i feel like
[1:36:21] to it but god what is it that you want
[1:36:23] me to do
[1:36:24] and there's a peace
[1:36:26] and a comfort
[1:36:28] that comes with knowing what you're
[1:36:29] supposed to do
[1:36:31] amen
[1:36:33] can i say this while i am thinking about
[1:36:35] it i believe the two two
[1:36:37] two statements that will fulfill
[1:36:40] whether or not you're ready for adoption
[1:36:42] and whether you're in the place that you
[1:36:44] ought to be
[1:36:45] and that one statement is the statement
[1:36:47] that jesus said he says i always do that
[1:36:50] which pleases the father
[1:36:53] can you make that statement can you say
[1:36:55] you i always do
[1:36:56] but please the father if you aren't
[1:36:58] you're not ready for adoption yet you're
[1:37:00] not ready for authority to for him to
[1:37:02] come down like he did for the brother
[1:37:03] bantam just tell me who are those
[1:37:05] squirrels how many squirrels you want
[1:37:06] and where do you want them squirrels to
[1:37:08] appear
[1:37:09] how many knows god told him to hold that
[1:37:11] god told him to stop that storm up on
[1:37:12] the mountain and then and he said shine
[1:37:15] for three days and there was a great big
[1:37:16] monstrous storm coming amen and
[1:37:18] everybody knew it was going to last for
[1:37:20] days and all of a sudden that storm just
[1:37:21] disappeared
[1:37:23] because god was up there and he says now
[1:37:24] you say to this perform what you want
[1:37:26] and he did same way he did with that
[1:37:28] woman with that couple down there say
[1:37:29] what you will to them and it'll be done
[1:37:31] amen
[1:37:32] how many believes a guy can speak to you
[1:37:34] he can speak to me like that but you got
[1:37:36] to be at the place of jesus we got to
[1:37:38] come to the place of adoption come to
[1:37:40] the place that god can invest his
[1:37:41] authority and his power in you
[1:37:45] because i think if we was real honest
[1:37:47] folks this road rage isn't going to work
[1:37:50] huh
[1:37:51] that's right our anger and our issues
[1:37:54] and things like that that's not going to
[1:37:55] work in our christian walk
[1:37:57] why because we would speak things the
[1:37:59] wrong way
[1:38:01] amen
[1:38:03] so i think this morning we can all grow
[1:38:05] in that area we can learn
[1:38:07] i can i know i've got a long ways to go
[1:38:09] yet folks
[1:38:11] praise the lord
[1:38:14] i hope you're enjoying this because i
[1:38:16] labored hard for the lord to give it to
[1:38:17] me amen lord lord help me lord help me
[1:38:21] amen
[1:38:23] this is not an easy job
[1:38:26] if i mess up
[1:38:28] i have to answer to god it's not good
[1:38:31] if i say the wrong thing
[1:38:32] amen
[1:38:33] i want to you know
[1:38:38] i thank god i thank god for his grace
[1:38:41] because i'm not perfect i make mistakes
[1:38:42] and i thank god that he forgives me
[1:38:45] for when i do things wrong or say things
[1:38:47] wrong
[1:38:48] sometimes in the pulpit i'll say
[1:38:49] something that afterwards i said you
[1:38:51] should have said that
[1:38:53] huh and i say sorry lord help me
[1:38:56] amen
[1:38:58] or in that way
[1:39:01] amen
[1:39:02] how many is with me saying that
[1:39:04] sometimes i do things i shouldn't
[1:39:06] think i think act in ways i shouldn't
[1:39:09] i don't want to do that anyway and let
[1:39:10] me just say something else this morning
[1:39:12] let me teach you one more thing and that
[1:39:14] is that many times we do things in the
[1:39:15] haste and this just comes to be
[1:39:17] refreshed and it's because we're not as
[1:39:19] patient as what we should be we're in
[1:39:20] too much of a hurry i believe the
[1:39:22] prophet of god taught us that he says
[1:39:24] that's when we do things we shouldn't
[1:39:26] normal or don't normally do is because
[1:39:28] we're in too much of hurry
[1:39:30] all of our businesses and everything
[1:39:32] when i was growing up folks brother
[1:39:34] irvin knows hey we got to get a pallet
[1:39:36] of pellet down every 10 minutes hurry
[1:39:39] hurry hurry hurry let's go
[1:39:41] we were talking hurry hurry i can hurry
[1:39:43] ever since brother
[1:39:44] i'm just now slowing down brother
[1:39:51] why because we're in this generation
[1:39:53] everything is geared
[1:39:55] you know time is money come on now right
[1:40:00] and we get into a frantic state and we
[1:40:02] do things say things get impatient get
[1:40:05] upset
[1:40:06] when really that's not the important
[1:40:08] thing folks
[1:40:10] i was reading ecclesiastes yesterday and
[1:40:12] where solomon talked about everything
[1:40:15] here is all vanity and vexation of
[1:40:18] spirit you should see how many times
[1:40:19] solomon talked about how this world and
[1:40:22] everything even the labor that we do and
[1:40:24] all of that is vanity and vexation of
[1:40:26] spirit because it all doesn't mean
[1:40:28] nothing
[1:40:30] it all fades away
[1:40:32] he says i've gotten everything that can
[1:40:33] be gotten i've had multitudes that are
[1:40:35] the other and all i know is that one day
[1:40:37] somebody else is gonna have get all of
[1:40:39] that and are they gonna be as wise as
[1:40:41] what i was with it no they'll probably
[1:40:43] just spend it all in two days
[1:40:47] in other words all vanity and then he
[1:40:49] said vexation of spirit in other words
[1:40:52] he said the more i think about it the
[1:40:54] more i understand how this world really
[1:40:56] works the more vexed i
[1:41:02] am yeah there's only one thing that
[1:41:05] gives you peace and hope and that is the
[1:41:07] holy ghost that is christ
[1:41:09] that's salvation how many know that's
[1:41:10] the only joy that we really have
[1:41:12] the only peace that we really have
[1:41:15] everything else is vanity and vexation
[1:41:17] of spirit
[1:41:19] to think that one of these days my boys
[1:41:21] are going to have to look and down the
[1:41:23] casket and see me there
[1:41:26] cold and stiff and dead
[1:41:28] that's why it's kind of talking about
[1:41:30] god forbid that they would go before me
[1:41:31] i think about my wife i thought i looked
[1:41:33] at her yesterday she was sleeping there
[1:41:35] and just snoring a little bit
[1:41:38] i said when she takes her last breath i
[1:41:40] think i want to take my last breath
[1:41:44] yeah
[1:41:45] and i said you know that's this world
[1:41:46] that's what it's all coming to you
[1:41:49] amen
[1:41:50] all coming down to the grave folks
[1:41:52] even the solid as you brought nothing
[1:41:54] with you you ain't taking nothing with
[1:41:56] you
[1:41:57] what do you have what's it all for how
[1:41:59] many we want to try to find the true
[1:42:01] purpose of life if you don't find that
[1:42:03] you lost everything
[1:42:05] amen
[1:42:08] you love him this morning
[1:42:11] praise the
[1:42:12] lord sometimes we can have a wrong
[1:42:15] spirit not realize it
[1:42:17] all right
[1:42:19] i believe it was uh
[1:42:22] peter
[1:42:24] he was very
[1:42:25] zealous for the lord he was a good
[1:42:27] christian
[1:42:28] but yet whenever they tried to take
[1:42:30] jesus what did he try to do
[1:42:33] he tried to take somebody's ear off
[1:42:36] did he
[1:42:38] or was he really having for the year
[1:42:40] come on people
[1:42:42] i can't help but think it's aiming a
[1:42:44] little bit different myself
[1:42:46] right
[1:42:47] aim for the year and cut the ear off
[1:42:49] what is that got it bit holyfield's ear
[1:42:51] off right
[1:42:53] no no i believe it's going for the head
[1:42:55] he was serious
[1:42:56] i'm willing to die for you you know and
[1:42:58] all this
[1:42:59] ain't nobody gonna take you
[1:43:01] he had the wrong spirit wrong attitude
[1:43:05] he's not the only one
[1:43:08] it came to pass when time was come that
[1:43:09] he should
[1:43:10] be received up jesus he steadfastly set
[1:43:13] his face hard to go to jerusalem
[1:43:15] and he sent messenger before his face
[1:43:17] and they went and entered into a village
[1:43:19] of sumerian the samaritans
[1:43:21] to make ready for him but they did not
[1:43:23] receive him this is in luke 9
[1:43:27] did not receive him because his face was
[1:43:29] as though he would go to jerusalem and
[1:43:31] when his disciples
[1:43:33] james and john
[1:43:34] saw this they said lord well now that we
[1:43:37] command fire to come down from heaven
[1:43:39] and consume them
[1:43:44] even as elias did

[1:50:47] you but they don't like you

[1:51:02] how many ways we need more of the love
[1:51:03] of god in our hearts
[1:51:05] but abandonment is preaching here you
[1:51:07] hear me preaching in this adoption a lot
[1:51:08] of this is what i got this morning he
[1:51:10] went to talking about love at the end
[1:51:13] how people don't have they have falling
[1:51:14] outs over baptisms over this that or the
[1:51:17] other all they had these falling out he
[1:51:19] says what is the holy spirit going to
[1:51:21] report back to the father
[1:51:23] how is he going to how he how ashamed
[1:51:25] that he must be
[1:51:29] let me just say this here and on radio
[1:51:32] land everywhere out there think about
[1:51:33] this how do you think jesus feels about
[1:51:36] having 900 different churches out of
[1:51:40] what he taught
[1:51:41] and those churches being against each
[1:51:43] other
[1:51:45] how do you think that makes him feel you
[1:51:47] think he would say yeah that's what i
[1:51:49] intended
[1:51:50] or is it the 17th chapter of john he
[1:51:52] says that you all might be one as we are
[1:51:55] one
[1:51:56] that's what god wanted that's what
[1:51:58] christ wants everybody to be one
[1:52:01] now i want to say this that in this
[1:52:02] generation through to malachi 4 through
[1:52:04] to brother branham he called all these
[1:52:06] churches together he said forget your
[1:52:09] denominational differences let's come
[1:52:11] back to the word of god he called for
[1:52:13] that unity he called for that oneness he
[1:52:16] gave her space to repent
[1:52:18] but she would not repent
[1:52:20] how many believes that he called jesus
[1:52:22] christ called for the unity of all the
[1:52:24] churches
[1:52:25] but they would not now guess where
[1:52:27] they're going into the echoing
[1:52:29] mechanical console
[1:52:31] into the mark of
[1:52:34] the beast
[1:52:36] and they will have to drink of the wine
[1:52:38] of the wrath of god
[1:52:40] because all those that don't have the
[1:52:41] mark of god in their foreheads how many
[1:52:44] knows they partake of the wrath of god
[1:52:47] amen
[1:52:48] so i say this morning to you
[1:52:50] lord help us
[1:52:56] to do what paul told the ephesians
[1:53:01] paul told the ephesians
[1:53:04] church
[1:53:10] that he henceforth
[1:53:12] be no more children
[1:53:14] toss to and fro
[1:53:16] and carried about
[1:53:19] with every wind of doctrine
[1:53:23] be wise let the holy spirit
[1:53:26] teach you as john said
[1:53:30] these things have i written
[1:53:32] concerning them
[1:53:34] that seduce you
[1:53:36] that the anointing which you have teach
[1:53:38] you how many knows preachers people want
[1:53:41] to seduce you they want to mislead you
[1:53:44] they want to misguide you
[1:53:47] take advantage of you
[1:53:49] amen
[1:53:50] that's not what a true servant of god
[1:53:52] does
[1:53:53] they want to lead you to christ for your
[1:53:55] benefit not their benefit
[1:53:58] not selfishness
[1:53:59] don't be carried away with every wind of
[1:54:02] doctrine by the slight of men to cunning
[1:54:04] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:54:07] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[1:54:09] that you may grow up into him in all
[1:54:11] things which is the head even christ he
[1:54:14] gave us apostles and prophets
[1:54:17] evangelists teachers

[1:54:29] edifying of the body of christ till we
[1:54:32] all come to the unity
[1:54:34] of the faith
[1:54:36] to the acknowledge to the
[1:54:38] end of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:54:40] unto
[1:54:42] a perfect man
[1:54:44] and to the measure of the stature
[1:54:47] of the
[1:54:48] fullness of christ
[1:54:53] i feel i believe like paul said i groan
[1:54:56] i believe
[1:54:57] i groan

[1:55:51] because of the kind of person that you
[1:55:53] are because you like christ and they
