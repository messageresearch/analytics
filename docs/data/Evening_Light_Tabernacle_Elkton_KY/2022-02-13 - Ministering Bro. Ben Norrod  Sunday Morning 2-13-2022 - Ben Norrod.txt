[Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] great [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] so foreign [Music] [Music] we realized foreign jesus christ amen oh not myself well [Music] he shall [Music] because of the men who bring away the violence here shall delight themselves more shallower this one again you as individuals or everything will be all right whether you're rich you're poor whether you're great god knows who you are if you would look for a different god here i mean [Music] read this whole chapter at the end and he just talks about the testimony of these individuals written in the bible having demonstrated god's faith to them about the 28 words in the eleventh chapter through faith he kept the passover from the sprinkling of blood these heat that destroyed the firstborn shall touch them and by faith they passed through the red sea that's dry around which the egyptians are saying redeemed were grounded the sheriff israel went across the dry land where the same egyptians went across and was destroyed and he goes the judges you know before you get the sound and there's only three mentions well it's actually for gideon derek sampson and jacob and i was just thinking of this song this morning i don't know if you all have friends i was just thinking of this man's testimony if you learn anything from his testimony and what went on in his life i was just thinking this morning be careful what you said because you might have to fulfill the vows and uh i'll try not to read the song um some of you know about islamic young obviously you're now pronunciation not they have grew up across catholic he was put out by his own brothers then they refreshed from his [Music] people that wouldn't be able to live in a [Music] you [Laughter] [Music] and strung me out of my father out of my father's house now why are you coming up to me now when you earth and destruction and beyonce therefore we turn again [Music] let me jump over here you know i was reading last week and now this is what jesus had to say in the seventh chapter of matthew say here just not beat judgment that is [Music] [Music] you read the whole chapter you see where he testifies that when the children of israel were going through the wilderness and became the follow in haman that all they asked to be is to be led through the land of their and those these kings of that time chose to fight against israel and in the process of doing that they lost the possession of their land and israel for control and jacob explains that to the people to among [Music] and at the end of the chapter i don't know if you all know but he made he said that he would sacrifice the first thing that came out of him when he returned from the battle of the lord gave his victory well that person was regarded and now as i read this chapter striking that you we would all think that god would send the prophet and i'm not making any assumptions here that god would like to send a problem to him i send somebody to him and say that he didn't have to fulfill himself but if you read the chapter that in the end of that chapter he actually had sacrificed his own daughter because he made it know that now we're just thinking this morning you got to be careful what you commit yourself to because god is whatever that is you know sometimes whether you're a businessman whether you're a father whatever it is people are listening to you and what you tell them you're gonna do they're expecting you to do it no in the day when you live well between christians if i tell you when i'm going to do something i should do exactly what i tell you what i'm going to do but then i give you a responsibility [Music] [Music] [Applause] great deal if you can't campaign great soul savings and all across the country in the world but you bring it to our day and they've got the same spirit speaking for us today i mean it's so different [Music] desire in my heart or the things that used to be important to us are very important to us this morning i can only speak for myself everyone else has to you know have their own experiences and their own life experiences where god is [Music] amen god is good isn't he appreciated that this morning and amen sing that little course i love you lord and i left my voice this morning i love you lord [Music] [Applause] [Music]

because i'm the glenn a child of the king this morning and he loves me enough that when i do wrong he's going to spank me amen and the the election the officers of the church and brother brian said we

they'll sing this morning and we're going to ask for the ben norad to come this morning and we're going to sing this little song i really like this and you probably realize that i sing it a lot but i love this praise him praise him praise him in the morning praise him in the noon time and amen you know there's one thing you can't do too much is worship the lord and pray amen let's sing with all of our heart this morning well praise oh praise him praise him in the morning oh him in the noontime oh praise him why don't you praise him we're praising till the sun goes down [Music] why don't you

[Music] praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah what a wonderful thing it is to be in god's house of praise that's why we come here is to worship and praise him and give him honor and glory what better thing could a christian do anyhow one day we're going to end all of this time where we debate and fuss and carry on over this doctor that thing and when we get to the eighth day it ain't going to be nothing but worship day and night praising him day and night and i guarantee you some of you all that ain't never moved too much in church you ever make it there how to get your mover moving i promise amen amen some of us be coming through the gate scrim and i made it i made it thank god i made it hallelujah i appreciate the lord today appreciate you you may be seated if you like for just a minute i'm going to invite my wife to come if she will my valentine that's right amen and praise the lord we don't believe in cupid but we know who our cupid was don't we baby jesus i'm glad she got to come with me she don't get to do much anymore because she's a school teacher big shot making big money you know how it goes and i uh i i gotta let her do her thing you know because she helps us in the ministry and the family and and uh it's a good calling that the lord's in her to be a teacher she's certainly a natural born teacher and uh and pretty too i like that party man love my wife appreciate her and glad she's here with us i want to say thank you to brother tom church body for receiving us again it's always a privilege to get to come here good to see everybody in the house of the lord today and uh you pray for us now got a lot of hay on the fork so i hope you come hungry and i'm gonna try my best to preach everything that i got laying here today but um also don't forget that in a time like we've seen over the last couple years with this this what they call climate with covet and things of that nature the culture that we're in we don't know but what this legitimately could be the very last time we're able to meet like this the health department can step in tomorrow and say everybody go home we don't know we didn't think it could happen until a couple of years ago and talked about days like that would be coming for us that coming to church and these things would be a fond memory so do me a favor do jesus a favor do yourself a favor get as much out of this service today as you possibly can because friends if there ever was a time that i think we're close to going home i believe right now is that time if i've ever seen it anybody been paying attention to russia russia watch russia watch russia remember brother had him repeated over and over again you know what they're down they're trying to get oil natural gas he said watch when russia goes after that oil watch what happens and takes place then i teach polish students english online and the polish people have been i've had a young lady 17 years old the other day in tears over the whole thing we don't know what's going to happen so many thousands of troops and the board of belarus and over by ukraine and all of them threatening to come down and you see how it's beginning to heat up but for the elect friends it might been a surprise it might have been a surprise to msnbc cnbc and fox but to the elect we've been watching looking for the club coming of that glad millennial day when jesus will take his waiting bride away it's no surprise to us thank god we had eyes in this day i could look way on out there and tell us what's getting ready to come this way amen may i take this moment to encourage you it's going home time let's get our lamps full of oil trimmed and brightly burned and ready to go home don't you think so amen now how would i take a poll today politicians do this but a christian i'm going to do this today as a christian politician how about that or a christian preacher i don't know whatever it goes anyways i'm taking a poll how many loves jesus this morning put your hand up like this oh thank you lord it'll be wonderful to us any good i i love how his presence comes and these old songs and i love to sing you all know this i'd rather sing than preach any day of the week and i certainly appreciate the ability to be able to worship the lord and worship in song we're going to sing three or four songs and be all right and then do a little singing she don't get to come all the time and then we'll jump into the preaching so love you god bless you appreciate you from the bottom of our hearts and uh we'll come back the pulpit get our bibles open in a minute and get right into the word of the lord i'm looking forward to what he's going to talk to us about aren't you amen chef [Music] what would i do without jesus the shepherd of my valley lord i just couldn't walk this world alone when i'm hungry he feeds me when i'm thirsty he's my water i couldn't make it without jesus what would i do when i need someone to talk to he's always there to listen when arm is full about me he rocks me in his boozer what would i do without jesus the shepherd of my valley i couldn't make it without jesus what would i do [Music] when my tears flow like a river add my burdens high as the mountain and the ones that i counted on have let me down [Music] that's when i go to jesus he's the one i can depend on i couldn't make it without jesus what would i do [Music] i need someone to talk to is always there to listen when arms i could make it without jesus what would i do [Music] i couldn't make it without you jesus what would i [Music] praise the lord can you say amen to that yes sir exactly right amen without jesus what would we do amen um we have sang this a thousand times i just feel impressed let's do it again um i can pray [Music] how many believes in the power of prayer say amen [Music] you say i'm not able i'm too young or i'm too old and i can't sing a preach and no titles do i hold what can i do [Music] for i want to do my part and i want to help with all of my heart i can pray until the walls come down to this healing all around that's something i can do oh i can pray in my secret place [Music] on your name and something i can do i can pray [Music] [Applause] [Music] and my child has gone so far and though i tried my best to reach them lord their hearts seem so hard what can i do to help bring them back to you for my family's lost and dying and my words they don't get the room then i can pray [Music] that's something i can do [Music] calling on your name that's [Music] [Applause] now my friend you may not be a singer you may not be a preacher you may not be somebody looked at as great in your local community folks may look at you and just say oh just a just a regular old joe they might pass by and even shake their head but one thing is absolutely for certain if we've got the baptism of the holy ghost if we have been born again by his spirit when we open up our mouth and lift our eyes to heaven and talk to him from the bottom of our hearts he said while you're yet speaking the answer is on the way yes sir when things look like it's over when things look like it's hopeless you i've got a message for you you can pray if you believe it shout a man i can pray until the laws come down [Applause] in my secret place [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we can [Music] praise the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] some have made jesus a game that they play to others a song that they sing but since i met jesus i'm happy to say to me he's become everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's become everything when i wake up each morning he's right by my side at night he's my last thought in mind [Music] he's joined for each moment and he's hoped that they freeze to me he's become everything to me he's become everything yes he has everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's become everything [Music] for each moment he's hope that pig brings to me he's become everything you're saying to me he's become everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] the first and the been last every third thing yeah praise hello thank you jesus thank you jesus amen how wonderful how wonderful how wonderful he is and i want to sing this one today so all my hope is in jesus thank god my yesterdays are gone [Music] all my sins are forgiven [Music] [Applause] [Music] you see i've been down to the river [Music] i felt the fire from above [Music] [Applause] i've been held by save yours oh the light to say a prodigal return can you say thank god oh and all my hope is in jesus yes oh thank god my yesterdays [Music] and all my sins are forgiven oh yes they are [Music] listen to this verse i'm no stranger to prison you see i've more shackles and chains [Music] but i've been helped by the savior [Music] i'll never be the same that's why i say all matter is in jesus yes sir somebody say man thank god my yesterdays my sins are forgiven and i've been washed by my sins are forgiven you see i've been watched [Music] [Laughter] praise the lord sing it with me will you all my hope is in jesus as you get your bible thank god my yesterday are gone thank you musicians all my sins are forgiven aren't you glad about it i've been washed by his blood sing that once again all my hope is in jesus ephesians chapter one thank god my yesterday are gone all my sins are forgiven washed by the blood all my sins are forgiven all my sins are forgiven i've been washed by the blood make that last line personal you see i've been washed by his blood [Music] somebody say praise the lord verse 13 ephesians 1 verse 13. i want to speak to you this morning upon the bride's equipment the bride's equipment how many knows we've been equipped ephesians 1 13 in whom you also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after everybody say after after that ye believed ye were sealed with a holy spirit of promise that holy spirit of promise ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise when after you believed not when but after those that believe that the true understanding of receiving the holy ghost occurs when you believe something you are completely in error my friend it doesn't occur when you believe it because the fact the matter is you have some old drunks staggering out of a bar you believe in god yeah sir i believe in him but what happened after you believed ask message people you believe the message you believe the prophet you believe the lord yes sir i believe it hallelujah you've got the tapes of belt buckle and on and on but what happens after they believe the real truth of the matter is many of the ones that say they believe they may believe but god don't believe they believe because if god believed they believed he would seal them with his amen praise the lord because see it's not when you say i believe it it's when god says yeah you believe it amen hallelujah that makes the big difference between well apples and oranges to some people but it makes the difference with being a christian and not being a christian right which is the earnest earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory now let's turn to second corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 and 22 second corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 and 22 we're going to go to the book of correction corinthians is the only book in the new testament that modeled correction correction for saints correction for leaders correction for the church and whole in general as a whole it's the only book in the entire bible that model correction like this you'll never actually find this anywhere you find god scolding israel throughout the new testament or the old testament part me but coming to the new testament this is the only book that you find god actually modeling what godly correction looks like especially from the man of god i like what the brother said today all of us that are his sons and daughters if we misbehave and we won't straighten up we will get a weapon and friend i'm going to let you in a little secret if you get a weapon that means jesus loves you if you don't get a weapon you better get to praying right because he corrects those he loves that should have been a big a man right there right see the modern day later seeing world they don't want correction they don't want you telling them what to do how to do it don't boss me don't tell me what to do that's why some people they can't work for another boss some people go into business for themselves because that's the only boss they can get along with and half time don't get along with him or her either praise the lord right stubborn contrary going to do their own thing can't listen can't humble i'm preaching already uh-huh right notice he which established establishes us boy that king james gets that tongue establisheth us [Laughter] with you in christ i'll get it hath anointed us is god by the lord help us and hath anointed us is god who anointed you god did it not your gift not your abilities i get out of the way i no he which anointed you is god listen to brother branham you know what i'm waiting on friends if he leaves me here i'll never be able to do nothing i'll walk away defeated i'm waiting on him to come bring me anointing right who hath also sealed us and given thee earnest now paul uses two words for this in the in the new testament we'll look at them just a moment the earnest of the spirit in our hearts let's pray together father thank you for your word today thank you for the opportunity to come into your house i pray now that you will use me lord as a voice that i might be able to speak to them only that lord which you would want them to hear and i pray you'll open every heart to receive it jesus we need you on this platform and those pews without it lord it's just learning a bunch of words and how they fit together but god make this service supernatural for all of us in some way some way quicken it to us lord make it real as we commit this to you now and the service and the remainder of it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen the saints said amen you may be seated may the lord bless you now the word that paul uses in corinthians here even though in the english it is the same word earnest in the greek there's actually two words that paul uses here for this now in ephesians looking at the 14th verse there of the first chapter he uses the greek word arab now this greek word means that it's money or a pledge or a down payment of a purchase waiting upon a full amount so the down payment or the pledge or the little portion if you put it this way like the little white button as he called the holy ghost a little white button comes into you this little portion is only god's pledge or a down payment waiting for the full portion to come now if what we got now is this good my lord jesus what waits for us when this full payment comes because serving the lord is some of the greatest experience so you'll be some of the greatest moments of your life and brother steve no matter how long you serve the lord it gets sweeter and sweeter every time you take a step troubles trials yes we'll have a few yes we'll have many but serving the lord is the greatest experience and that's just the down payment imagine what the full inheritance is going to look like now in second corinthians paul uses the english word earnest again here all right now when you translate these words into the english a lot of times they're taking that same word and trying to keep it in in continuity but actually when paul speaks this he speaks two different phrases this particular word is corrio when this word means to anoint or to consecrate or to furnish with the necessary powers for administration so in other words if god has called you to a certain administration in life ever what that is but the bible told us that in some cases he said god would give birth he said before the foundation lord he gave birth to housewives factory workers farmers painters preachers on and on if god called me to preach he equipped me with every thing i would have need of the intellect or the lack of intellect that's even an equipment in some cases if you don't believe that ask moses god couldn't use an ounce of that in him or paul god equips a man with a style the ability to even adapt his style maybe to as an evangelist you know i have a kind of a chameleon type ability if i go amongst people that are real starchy and they don't know how to hold a man and say praise the lord i know how to blend right in with that that's part of the gifting that the lord's given me if i go to a congregation that's wild and over the top i know how to get right into that anointing with them and pull that back in why not because i sat down and read a bunch of books 101 ways to be a successful evangelist in the message but because the gifting of the lord gives me a wisdom or a knowledge to know how to tap into that to make it beneficial for the people's sake not for mine but then when a man or woman has been gifted by the holy spirit for whatever administration they've been called to the devil likes to chase that understanding with well you'll never get there you'll never be what god called you to be uh you'll never be the kind of mother that you need to be never be the kind of father that you need to be you will never pass to the church like you want a pastor or on and on and on and on and on the truth of the matter is that when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost i'm only talking to those that are born again by the holy spirit if you don't have the holy ghost this morning you are missing a great portion of the calling of the lord in your life and you need it you need the baptism of the holy ghost and friend that it's more than just that time you raised your hand and felt a chill go down your back that is a complete change of your nature amen if that hasn't happened yet you need to go back and talk to the lord and find out all right lord where am i missing what area of my life am i lacking or slacking in help me to find a way to be pleasing to you that you can seal me with that holy spirit of promise now for a person then that is born again by the holy ghost everything you have need of for this life's journey is placed inside of you with that holy ghost baptism which means that if you're ever going to be a father if the lord will allow you to father children to have a child on this planet amen it gives you the ability to be the right kind of father you don't need dr spock and you don't need any of the rest of the gang to tell you how to get there your holy ghost is a reservoir of knowledge wisdom and understanding that if you would just spend time in prayer tapping into that resource the answer would show up before you even understood what happened right jesus gives us a preview of this when he tells his disciples before the holy ghost even comes you will be hated for my name's sake you'll be despised they'll reject you like they rejected me but don't take thought when you come before magistrates judges and people of influence for in that hour what the holy ghost will give you what to say brother brown was talking about it when he comes into the message marriage and divorce when he's challenged in a debate on serpency and he said he was standing there and this man was carrying on with all of his sciences and his theology and he said well he said if the original sin is here he said then the original sinner must also be pla present and brother said before i thought he said i heard him say it's the serpent now you understand that the holy spirit can actually operate above your own thinking now friends the devil does the same thing when you come up against somebody that is working beyond their own mental and physical capacity when you see somebody that is smarter in certain areas than what you know they really are you might want to take notice something demon power some supernatural thing is going on beyond their own mind when you see a child acting out arguing in a manner that is beyond their age i'm not saying people are stupid friends but let's be honest some people just don't have good common understanding about certain matters but all of a sudden you see a change in them and a child will argue you like you're standing there arguing a lawyer that child got a devil on it praise the lord if demon power will make a man or a woman to be ten times their strength their attitude can be that way their speech can be that way they can be anointed to go beyond their own capacity well if that's the way then what about the holy ghost can not the holy ghost anoint us to go beyond what our own reasoning would say you sit in a doctor's office and he tells you you're dying with cancer your mind tells you you're gone you better make preparations but a man or woman that's got the holy ghost and if they tap into the revelation of divine healing that i am not going by the way of the grave this sickness is not unto death but god is going to deliver me out of this amen don't you realize what's happening the power of god is taking them beyond what their own reasoning and mental power can comprehend [Music] you understand something as simple as forgiveness as the brother quoted this morning don't judge don't judge unrighteously in other words don't judge by yourself we only judge ourself by the word folks i can't judge you by my standards and what i think and what i feel and you can't judge me the same because if you judge me and i judge you one of us got a toothpick one of us got a telephone bolt sticking out of our eye maybe both praise the lord amen and what we need to understand is that the power of forgiveness true forgiveness comes from the source of the born-again life if you ain't got that you could try your best to forgive them the first little thing that comes back and you have a flashback you'll go right back to the same old grudge right back to the same old feeling you've always had why because the spirit of god is the only thing that can truly bring forgiveness in a person's life that's why folks sit in church for 30 years got grudges against one another hold things against one another hold it up in their face every time they turn around and got a speck of mercy and a speck of forgiveness because they ain't got even a speck of the holy ghost amen the holy ghost will make a man or woman forgive unconditionally right notice he tells us again that the inheritance is an anointing or a power for consecration now listen close you do not have the ability be included now you do not have the ability to bring yourself in total surrender of the word it's absolutely impossible you and this skin veil do not have the intestinal fortitude if you will to be submissive are you kidding me y'all i'll change your mind three times after church where you're gonna go eat you sisters probably changed your mind three times what kind of dress you were gonna wear this morning unless you just as the expression goes on the street messy hair don't care and you just threw on whatever and okay huh brothers you might have changed your tithe three or four times and you need to tell me with as fickle as we are as human beings and as as the wind blows when we change our mind that somehow i'm going to take this and 100 completely consecrate myself to jesus christ to the level that he would be pleased with me to say this is my beloved son if i could do that i wouldn't need him if i could make that happen i wouldn't need the holy ghost and god knew that when you took the breath of life he knew you did not you lacked the ability the supernatural quality to be able to make that word live in that regard and so he knew that that's why he equipped you with the holy ghost so that you could dig right down into consecration and when this thing don't want to consecrate there's something inside of you that just keeps dragging you right back down to that place at the foot of the cross consecrating yourself to jesus christ my friend i know that blow's legal let's plumb out of the building because when you get this idea that you can do something now listen i'm also not on the other side i know i i preach a lot dealing with that legalistic type thing but i'm also not on the other side where if you got the holy ghost you live any way you want i do believe a man or woman should live holy but you can't do that within yourself you can't make that live within yourself take somebody working a job 30 years you've got to be honest with yourself and know you spend all that time at work you haven't always been the most loyal employee you've just learned how to work the system well that's the way it is in day to day life what about spiritual things a lot of people have learned how to work the spiritual message system long hair check long dress check eagle belt buckle check 270 rifle check pray so hard got all of the little dots on the eyes and the crosses on the t's and every time we get to that spot in our minds if we think we can take that into the rapture [Music] that is nothing more than filthy rags in the eyes of god come on somebody preach to me there's no way in the world that you can take that in the presence of the lord because it's like the little evangelist danny greenfield he said i thought i was a good guy until i got in the presence of that light that's why we cannot stand before him nothing short be them being covered by the blood and the righteousness of jesus christ a man which only comes by the baptism of the holy ghost so this holy ghost gives you the power to consecrate you that are born again know what i'm talking about you go through these laws in your walk you're not praying like you should not read your bible like you should you're fed up with the church fed up with people fed up with christianity now i know about two of you might blink your eyes at me the rest of you will be honest to save your life but it's true i've been in this people game nearly 31 years y'all ain't gonna fool me see might as well go ahead and shake your head this way uh-huh you get bored sometimes wore out sometimes you look in the mirror and some of you said somebody said this old stringy hair god i wish i could do something with it now that's exactly when humanity would overwhelm you and take you right out of your fellowship of god but what happens in those moments think about it brethren something begins to take place and it comes from a source that you can't explain you get so wore out you think i'm done you know how many times i've retired from preaching i wasn't even 20 yet i wanted to give up this whole thing many many years ago but somehow something on the inside would start compelling me i feel such a burden for people that would almost keep me up day and night i think god is there because if it wasn't there you'd walk away from your call you'd wake up walk away from your family you'd walk away from your job everything would be a bum on the street look at your prophet and standing in the gap when he stood thank god for a man that was honest enough to tell us these things too he was about ready to give up because he thought people didn't want to hear his message and the lord showed him his pathway was going to take him right into a garbage dump amen to completely remove him amen from the glory and the prestige of being a servant of god where the lord placed him at the head of the table brother m didn't put himself there he may he wanted the back seat god put him in the upper seat but because this prophet of god had that holy ghost he shows him a vision of something that will never take place just to let him know if you follow your line of thinking billy won't stay with you your wife will leave you oh brother how many times have we been there sister how many times have we been in that very place young person how many times have you been in that spot where if you'd follow your line of thinking it would get you in a lot of trouble but you this got the holy ghost something comes from another source that says don't you take it around don't you go that direction don't you think that way no more brother don't you understand why the world cannot make a sound decision anymore they're not led by the spirit of god but they that are led by the spirit of god what are they the sons of god and the daughters of god the real key to christianity is the ability to let when you see people combative angry over every little thing that moves and split hairs don't you understand what nature that is it's certainly not the holy spirit no because this equips you with the power of consecration the power of humility comes with your holy ghost that's not to say we won't be arrogant from time to time and the church said it doesn't mean you won't get too big for your britches there won't be times of course where there will be times rather that you'll be walking around thinking a certain way and be completely wrong thinking you're right thanking and believing that you've got thus saith the lord until he comes in the midnight hour in the middle of your sleep or on your job or you're riding down the road in your car and all of a sudden you hear a voice and say you are wrong do you understand what would happen if you wasn't equipped with the teacher you would never learn god's ways you'd learn your ways you learn what somebody else told you you'd learn from the influence of media but you would never learn god's ways that's why he said the teacher will be in you and with you he will lead you and guide you into all truth and what is he trying to do teach us how to have his character and i know what you think well i'm never going to get there you just are pushing a timeline that you're not in control of when you get in a hurry thinking you should be farther down the road remember this is not your timeline you don't control this is not netflix where you can fast forward and rewind 10 seconds or 30 seconds as much as you want y'all gonna sit and act like you don't know what netflix is don't you that's all right that's all right i'll let you conceal your secrets this is not a thing where you can say i think i'll add to my faith you can add it all right but you better have the will of god and the mind of god before you start trying to add or take away anything because the day you take the notion i think i'll tackle brotherly kindness today that'll be the very month week year or ten years that every brother around you become the most sourpussed person on the face of the planet nobody will be lovely to you nobody will be nice to you and jesus will be sitting in heaven saying still want to add brotherly kindness are you sure you want it yet no lord let's tackle faith first and then we'll work on it but this equipment that god gives to the bride positions her in a place to where that as he instructs her and as she walks that which is inside of her will express when it's time some people have been in battles for 20 years and they can't understand why can i get over this because that thing is there to unearth what's hiding inside of you and if there's a lot of it in there it'll take a lot to get it out so you may be confronted with that over and over and over again but brother joe thank god that something in christ that is not only long-suffering but patient he don't get in a hurry because it doesn't happen overnight hey man this is not a popcorn religion he waits and waits and waits the bible said the husband waits long suffering waiting for the fruit to come off the vine we get so nervous i'll never be what i want to be question one do you have the holy ghost the answer is yes then statement number one you will always be what god wants you to be to believe anything contrary to that is to not believe the bible right and how many of you and i how many of us sitting right here today how many times do we doubt our own walk with god that will ever accomplish anything later because we don't think that we can get there question number one do you have the holy ghost statement number one you'll always get there with god's help always somebody tells me sometimes young men you know when older men alike will say i feel called to preach what do i do to preach look there's no books to read we have no online courses for this the best we can do is try to watch the other brothers and figure it out but honey if that gift is in there you jump in the pulpit it'll kick in gear don't worry about it it'll show up before you know what's happening same thing with you mom i don't care what's coming on in your home i don't care what kind of problem you're confronted with if god has equipped you with the holy ghost he gives you the ability to know how to overcome that wayward son or daughter or that problem or that spirit or that issue or that or that or that and friends what you understand the bottom line of all of this is we just need to trust what god has done within us amen if we can put confidence in that to know that he has anointed us listen the anointing is not shouting alone the anointing is not feeling chills run down your spine the anointing is your equipping that is something that comes beyond your five senses you don't see it you don't taste it you don't feel it you feel the rain you feel the rain and the anointing of the holy ghost when it moves on you you feel the inspiration of god that is an attribute of the anointing joy is what we feel when we feel like clapping our hands and singing and shouting and worshiping that's joy but the anointing is not something you get by screaming at an altar or some man laying his hands on you or going to another louisiana camp or some other special meeting the anointing is something that once it enters into your soul it never leaves you or forsakes you it is there to equip you for the rest of your life you know what's beautiful about receiving the anointing the true anointing of the holy ghost you only got to do it one time you know years ago when we were younger the early days of this message especially folks who come out of pentecost apostolic and charismatic type movements like that you thought to be anointed you had to go to your prayer closet and pray until you spoke you have to go to church and shout real loud to get the anointing what we're doing is out there and i call it indian dancing you know they used to do the rain dance lord praise the lord i'm in about 12 different tater patches right now right they get out and they would dance trying to call the rain down not realizing that without rain or with rain they were still indians with or without a feeling i am an anointed son of god because i've got the holy ghost how contrary that is from what we've been instructed to believe though that the anointing is something that comes because an angel of the lord draws thee or because a man becomes gifted years ago we used to judge how anointed a man was by how wet his tie was when he got done preaching and the sweat was dripped drip drip dripping off the end of his time man he was anointed tonight uh what did he say what was his message did he have any substance to it no i didn't understand the thing he said but glory to god he shouted all over the place that it's not the anointing that's the rain and it falls on the just and then just come on people don't just look at me get in with both feet because this is a misconception of pentecost pentecost modern day pentecost is not what we were restored to no sir we were not restored back to the faith of those modern day pentecostals they had gifts they had a portion of revelation but we were restored plum back to the original how hard is it for us to believe this though when we read the bible we see these anointed servants of god we call we see these anointed saints of god and in our mind the anointings when they were opening blinded eyes and casting out devils no that was an attribute of the true anointing and young people when you go to special meetings and and there's a call for the altar please listen to brother ben and understand you don't go to that altar to receive the anointing because of how you'll feel if you go pray in an altar somebody lays their hands on you you are inviting christ to come take residency right here you're asking him to make a permanent move from his attribute in heaven into your house glory to god and brother you will never have to put a for sale sign up on that again you'll never need another realtor that's what i am this morning a holy ghost free at a time i'm trying to sell you a house that jesus can move into and once you get that brother john once we receive the holy ghost it's not a feeling how many christians here can put your hand up testify how many times have you went through this life not feeling god can you say at least once twice 12 times 50 100 more well did that mean you lost your anointing when you quit feeling him what was it that drove you to the next feeling what was it inside of your heart that day you wanted to quit and commit suicide and something runs up inside of you and said don't you harm my tabernacle it was the anointing this is why the prophet of god taught us that if you genuinely got the holy ghost you'll be able to say amen to every word why because it's like a magnet the anointing will draw you to the truth i don't care how obscure or how far away that truth is if the holy ghost is on the inside of you it will draw you like a magnet to metal amen right to the anointing right to the truth of the word the anointing will do that sister bible through the years if we've seen ministry through the years and you know you've seen it sis we get this misconception that the anointing is how loud somebody scream down here and maybe whether tom or whether brad or some of these ministry will lay hands on people and they will pray and say god help this man or help this woman and i've heard it a thousand times in my own ministry i just didn't feel anything what they fail to understand is that when a servant of the lord lays his hands on you it doesn't have to be a preacher now do you realize nothing is really happening just because i place my hands on you what i am doing according to the message recording the bible is i am sanctioning before god that you say you're a believer and that you believe his word and i am sanctioning that you believe what's truth when jesus said in mark 16 go to the world preach the gospel lay hands on the sick and they shall recover show me one time you said you'll feel it y'all might as well hang with me because this is where the lord took me here we are away with feelings and experiences as your plumb line we don't stand and find a foundation based upon what do i feel because if i was to go by the way i feel y'all have to be praying for me because that plenty of folks i'd rip a goozle out of them i'd shake them to their false he fell out of their head praise the lord including myself huh we don't base things upon well i feel like a christian what does that feel like exactly what's feeling like a believer mean we don't go by sight we go by faith the things we can't see those are the things that paul told us were the most real and yet the anointing when it moves in it's there to furnish and equip you with everything listen to this and show us the father i've read this quote so many times in my lifetime i don't even have to look at this i've read this one over and over and over one of the first things the lord showed me when i first got saved got the holy ghost was this quote right here shows the father 19 55 he said everything you have need of for this life's journey is in you when you receive the holy ghost divine healing even the rapture is in you when you become born again well i'll never make the rapture question one are you born again statement number one you will always do what god has called you to do if you've been called to make the rapture you utilize in your seed in the seed germ that christ placed inside of you is one of two things it either has the power to bring you to rapture or the power to bring you to resurrection there are some that are equipped right now with the ability to take the rapture and when that hour arrives they'll speak to their own bodies and tell it to change oh you say that's ridiculous no it's not that's what i do every day of my life as a believer when i wake up every morning and i don't want to pray i tell my body shut up we're going to talk to the lord a lot oh but you say i can't oh oh careful as he said the holy ghost come to take all those cants away from you i can do all things through christ which strengthens me oh but i don't know how to ah now you're getting somewhere you don't but you're equipped with the ability to let that expression come from your heart and what does he do he draws this body subject to that how do i get there well first of all we got to stop taking the reins and driving the bus we need to learn how to surrender a little bit and say lord i don't know the answer i don't know how to face this i don't know how to overcome this but if you'll take over if you'll teach me the way praise god oh i got 13 pages here and i haven't even got to pass page one yet it's one that preaching to y'all they're you hungry little eagles gotta be ashamed of yourself being so hungry now notice the same word is used when jesus walks into the temple luke chapter 4 verse 18. you got it with me the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath carrillo furnished me consecrated me anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor you know that always surprises me most preachers want to preach to the rich that's where the big offerings come from if i've been called to preach i've been called to preach those ain't got no money and i've done it time and time and time again never fails 19 years full-time ministry around the world i go to a church they might give me 50 bucks and that's the best they can do cost me 250 to get there but that's the best they do following that next service somebody will feel led to give a hundred led to give 200. led to give this led to give that as long as i pay my tithes and offerings i've never not one time in nearly 20 years i've never seen him fail when the bills are due and it's time to put food on the table he knows how to take care of you brother that's not just for preachers that's for every son and daughter of god he said try me in this area pay your tithes and your offering and see if i won't open the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing you can't even contain it brother i'm going to tell you something if folks would learn that simple principle right there they'd have a whole lot more joy their prayer lives would be better their marriages would be better come on when you don't do it you live under a curse and god absolutely will not bless you in the way you need to be blessed until you get back to that sound principle again i love preaching this week he's an evangelist i don't receive tithes so i can say it all right to the holy spirit equips you with the ability to do the thing you've got to do again if i'm a preacher there is a congregation somewhere that god called me to preach to i'm an evangelist there is a there is an audience for me to evangelize to this is what jesus told his own disciples when you go don't take a bunch of things like a person a script don't don't pack up your suitcases like you're going to florida i imagine it was quite the sight brother tom and them guys coming out probably had all their fishing gear and had everything loaded up you know when they go down and fish i mean you when you take vacations going to disneyland or dollywollywood you might have all kinds of things you'll have extra extra extra just in case but jesus told his disciples don't take nothing but the shirt on your back why because he's anointed those men remember they shared in his anointing they share in the christ anointing the anointing of his ministry they shared in it and judas even shared in anointing as well and that anointing had equipped them to go to places and preach to those folks that had no money probably didn't have a roof over their head even jesus himself said the birds have a nest and foxes have hole i ain't got nowhere to lay my head but he wasn't complaining because he turns right around and says that my lord feeds the spare hosts he knows how to dress the fields with grass glory to god clothe them with grass he said in other words jesus is saying that you are anointed a man with the ability to go into nothing and god can bring something out of nothing don't forget we believe in a christian big bang theory there was nothing god spoke and banged there was a bunch of somethings everywhere he knows how to hone in on your need and it's a two-way street you see because he's got the answer he placed that answer inside of you i like the the the message this morning on the vows and being faithful to god vowing to god i've actually been teaching on this quite a bit i just did a a zoom meeting with about about 50 pastors down south america and central america and mexico and the question was about a woman vowing herself in engagement and so forth like that and i took it from this avenue that when the bible spoke about a vow your soul was actually bound to that vow and god would hold you accountable for vowing yourself to the lord but watch james when it comes to the new testament it's not like hey i'll meet you for coffee on friday and we'll go down and have a starbucks james said don't go to a city and say i'll do this or that but say if it's the lord's will that's different than a vow that binds your soul before god and i like what the brother said if you are going to tell the lord that you are going to serve him that's different than saying i'll see you in church on sunday you say in that case if the lord be willing my ox might be in the ditch i might not be able to make it come on now but when you vow to god i'm gonna consecrate my life to you he will hold you accountable for the thing you promised him that's a whole lot different than i'll meet you on friday for a starbeast huh on triple stars points thursday or whatever it is i usually don't know i just hold my phone up and say hit it oh you have a free donut thank you i'll take another but the anointing is your is your vow it's your body that your contract between you and god you understand it's not when you have received the holy ghost or accept the holy ghost is when the holy ghost accepts you and because of that reality if the holy spirit says amen to your life and gives you the holy ghost he is making a vow a binding contract with you you are my son my daughter and one thing i love about him he never breaks his contracts i can't ever say that i've been faithful there at the risk of sounding like i've got only a speck in my eye when i've got a telephone pole i have not always been faithful to that idea there have been plenty of times that i've told him how sorry i am for getting weak discouraged disgruntled frustrated feeling like quitting feeling like giving it there have been a thousand times that i've told him lord jesus i cannot take another moment [Music] hey god that little something begins to wash over a son and over a daughter that says listen don't don't worry i'll drive for a while it's the most refreshing thing in the world when sam and i've been on the road sometimes eight nine a thousand miles and i've gone four or five hundred and we're trying to press to get back home some kind of a matter of the family or some kind of thing and i get this but i can't honestly stay awake i'm biting my cheek and rubbing my eyes i got the lights on and music playing and everything else i can do to stay awake and she leans over and says hey i'll drive for a bit now mind you i go to pray a lot harder when she does but we keep each other prayed up believe me between my lead foot and hurricane sitting over the steering wheel we were a match made in heaven happy valentine's day baby what a comfort it is for somebody just to take the wheel and i can rest brother sister we need those moments in our life where we just step back and say all right lord your turn he called his fellow laborers with christ which means that he doesn't always drive the charge there are times we've got to do the thing that we've got to do and we've got to do it the way he wants us to do it build upon the foundation we got to work and labor to be the right kind of christian but there are moments when you get so weak to where you can't do anything else that's when he steps in and says it's okay i'll drive where he's gone i looked up it's 20 after 12. you can't believe it i can't believe it but i've got to find a place to quit we're just getting started acts chapter 10 verse 38 they refer to jesus how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed to the devil for god was with him notice in john 2 19 20 21 jesus answered said destroy this temple in three days i'll raise it up what a bold statement y'all won't kill me fine do it within three days i'll take this body that you kill and i'll raise it up again why could this man this this creation of god why could he speak with such authority because he knew i'm anointed and here's the beauty of the anointing the anointed the anointing carried him all the way into the garden of gethsemane and when the anointing of the holy spirit when the actual anointing itself lifted off jesus listen it didn't take the character that the anointing had developed because when peter cuts off malcus's ear jesus with no anointing on him reaches down and picks the ear up puts it back on his head without even a scar i like what brother carol used to say there he said because if there had been a scar that could have made an accusation against peter and it could have put him in jail but because the ear went back on without a scar as though it was never off in the first place there was true justification involved that's what god did for you and i there could be no accusers against the true bride if you're born again no one can stand and say you're a sinner not even christ now you may get frustrated and say ah but not him once he makes this contract with you he knows what you are he knows where you come from he knows where you're going he knows all about you your secret parts the end parts the out parts the bad parts the good parts and he doesn't change his contract because you have down times no no see that's why he sent the anointing into your soul because if this was easy everybody would do it i shouldn't have told you the time now some of y'all are going okay we're done now let's go ahead and get here few more minutes we'll quit notice notice these words i love this when peter is speaking about the lord jesus in acts 4 and 27 now this is going all the way down from the time that jesus was anointed remember jesus was not anointed until he come to the river jordan he was only god's creative body he was the seed he was the son of god he was the virgin born son of god and jesus did not receive the holy ghost because he was a sinner and needed to be saved he received the holy ghost without measure because he needed to be equipped find me one place in the scripture anywhere that said jesus had the holy ghost before he leaves jordan and goes into the wilderness jesus being full of the holy ghost goes into the wilderness be tempted to the devil find the scripture before that says that well then why did he receive it that way oh you say because he was god be careful jesus as a man the human body that was created was just as much flesh as you and i except it wasn't born according to the fall remember i said some time ago on the cross god crossed himself with that human body and placed that supernatural in the soul why because jesus in a little bit was gonna have to come nose to nose with the devil and even as the virgin-born son of god listen he was no match for the devil in his flesh oh that should have set the down i might offer some of you there was no way that he could have overcome satan in that human body he needed the holy ghost glory to god and once he got it then he goes into the wilderness i don't think he walked around looking for the devil like the terminator a rambo or somebody the holy ghost sent him into an attitude and an atmosphere of consecration did you notice when jesus comes out of jordan and steps to go into the river the very first thing he does god anoints him to go into fasting for 40 days he goes into a place to pray first thing he does goes out into the wilderness to consecrate himself why because now this anointing that has housed itself in this virgin-born body is now going to consecrate this vessel to do the works of god the lame is going to leap like a heart the blinded eyes are going to come open bruised and broken hearts are going to be mended all of these great things are going to take place show me one time he did it before that moment in jordan the best we get is 12 years old he's debating in the temple and mary jo joseph run off and leaving and when she comes back she said your father and i have sat you with tears well i bet that was a broadway production drama queen mary here she comes uh-huh that's what she was your father and i boy putting on the dog in front of all of those big high pollutant message preachers and jesus looks at her and says woman now you know that jesus was not a regular boy because if i would have said to my little redheaded 85 year old mother woman i would have probably never known anything else except the back side of her hand and the underside of the grave she'd have killed me the brother adam said the word corrected the error because he was the word but the anointing did not come to jesus so that it could make him the son of god he already was a son that's why he could receive the holy ghost this is the reason you can receive the holy ghost not because it makes you a son or daughter but because ye are sons glory because you are dollars he can send his spirit into your heart crying happen father father last statement we're gonna quit there was not one thing that ever confronted jesus that he wasn't equipped to beat let's put ourselves in his shoes okay brother brad you and i are evangelizing together right we go into a city somebody comes running to us this young girl's died she's 10 years old come come lay hands on her so we go into the house we walk in there the spirit of the lord moves on us this is not a she's not dead she's sleeping and everybody in the room imagine this room everybody starts laughing oh you know how people are but when they get on a roll especially when that spirit of fun making gets on there's a difference between fun making and having a sense of humor believe me please do yourself a favor do a study on the difference and learn a difference it'll help you and they go and they start laughing to scorn jesus says every one of you get out and then he reaches down takes her by the hand and speaks in that dimension arise mate could you imagine what it might have looked like on the other side of the veil and that chasm of the gulf of paradise where that that veil was just right here just like it'd be in another room and there's a veil just a gulf fix and she's standing there in that dimension next to father abraham and jesus speaks and before she knows it she just walks through the door and she's laying back on the bed you say how do you know that because we already had one astronaut that told us that's how it works [Laughter] hallelujah he said he moved out of his body and looked back there was sitting on the bed he didn't allow laughter to overcome him can i say something to you social media people young ones middle-aged ones if you are equipped with the holy ghost there is no amount of social media bullying that can overcome your walk with god let everybody on instagram let every vile or post speak against you let people make fun of you say all manner of ought and evil against you but if you're born again of the holy ghost there's not enough bullies on the internet to take you away from what god called you to be you know why people get overcome with this stuff i go just a bit further can i give you thank you i hate to quit right here i got so many good things but and demonology the prophet said like this he said let's talk about the death side how could a person in that estate though not being born again in that kind of condition ever be sick why because your body is not yet redeemed no matter how good you are how saintly how holy how much holy spirit that's only your soul and your soul is not completed yet it's just got the blessing the promise of god which is the earnest of our salvation he said because see the earnest which is the baptism of the holy spirit that's down payment the earnest which holds it secure in heaven for us paul said if we leave this life we have another body waiting bigger than five we have one a tabernacle already waiting do you know why it's waiting because the down payment for your new body has already been made and when you receive the holy ghost your holy ghost secures that body in heaven for you glory to god it'd be like you bought a car and waiting on it to be delivered you lay down the earnest money you pay your payment all you're waiting for honey is for the truck to pull in your driveway and drop it off oh hallelujah that's exactly what the rapture and the resurrection is going to be for every one of us that are born again by the holy ghost i'm only waiting on the fairy man to cross the river and bring my new body to me [Music] it secures my eternal life because what good would it do to be all born again in the soul and have a body that still gets old and sick and decrepit and dies and goes off by the way of the grave so my down payment holds my resurrection and my rapture holds it you know how it is when you go to layaway or some of these places and you put down some money you bought this certain bit of carpet or a piece of furniture or something of that nature long as you got your earnest money down your pledge down nobody can touch it let the devil strike you with cancer let him strike you with coven let him strike you with all sorts of evil and diseases and manners of evil let him strike this body all he wants my down payment is holding my eternal body nobody not even the devil can touch it he can't take it away from me he can steal it from me oh glory he's got it held in heaven reserved in heaven waiting on me to get my change [Music] he said that's right think of it a down payment if there's no joy here then there can be no joy there we just got the earnest that's right and if there's no healing here there's no resurrection there healing what does divine healing speak of it's the earnest of the resurrection if there's no holy spirit now to baptize us there's no eternal life in the world to come so what your holy ghost speaks of when you have joy when you have peace when you have understanding when you have wisdom when you have supernatural working when you have a word of knowledge when you have faith when you have all of these things that work in a portion you may only see it once a month but that one time that it shows up is ever defense that there's more coming on the other side i'll never understand people in this message that claim that they're going to a heaven where they shout rejoice praise the lord and have eternal joy and they can't seem not even get a little tiny piece of it down here they're so miserable they're miserable are miserables i mean they're just miserable their whole life is nothing but one great big misery and then you ask them about the holy ghost yeah i'm born again all right good lord i wish you would notify the rest of you i talked to a brother the other day wonderful brother beautiful brother i genuinely believe he's a christian full of the holy ghost but he is the most negative human being i've ever heard in my life i said to him i said don't you understand the holy ghost is supposed to give you positivity he said i am positive that life is bad but you see sometimes this is just the nature of people but when you get to hold a ghost no matter what nature you're born under there is a supernatural something that kind of moves in even if it's just a brief fleeting moment i may only and the years i've preached you're going on a long time now there's some of you i don't know that i've ever seen smile i preach a lot of services here at this little church and some of you i don't know that i've ever seen some of you smile and i pull out all my best good jokes make all the funny faces i need to make i act like an idiot sometimes just to get some of you to loosen up woo preach but if all i ever get to see every now and then is just all of a sudden i mean when that happens some of you all are in revival you are wide open forget about tongues forget about interpretation forget about right raised to the dead and seeing angels somebody said glory to god i want the power to be able to raise again i said i wish you just raised the corners of your mouth every now and then [Music] but if there is joy here speaks of eternal joy there glory to god and if i've got his holy ghost now it speaks of eternal holy ghost do you know that even in the new city you'll still be baptized with the holy ghost only difference is you won't just have a portion you'll have the full inheritance oh you say brother ben these things preach something deep man you understand that in the years that i have traveled i i've studied um hours of my life away understanding the mysteries of god understanding the things that's been brought to us i feel like after all these years i have a comprehension and a revelation to be able to talk to you about any subject you want to talk about and i don't say that bragging i just mean that i've tried to do my homework i've tried to be a good steward and be faithful and be what the bible said study to show myself approved i believe i've reached that place by god's grace to some extent but do you know what i find when i talk to people because i listen to them i find that out of all of these great mysterious and deep things that we talk about these are folks that still don't even know how to have joy on an everyday basis they can't sleep their marriages are a mess they hate their job and they have not a speck of joy in their life now come on somebody tell me is this what god wanted for us that's what the holy ghost is supposed to bring for us ultimate misery i know that dying is a part of living sure i know that sorrow is a part of joy i know that sickness is a part of health there are law of contrast but god did not give us the precious holy ghost so we could walk around focusing on how dark it was all the time that's why in the darkest hour jesus comes as a light in the darkness because the lord don't want us walking around with no joy no victory no peace some of you that are battling health problems in your body you cry to the lord god please please please but eve even in the middle of sickness even in the middle of financial troubles and everything else there is a resource where you ought to be able to step back from every bit of it and say this is but a temporal thing because all my hope is in jesus all of my joy all of my worship all of my love and only at the feet of jesus will i worship the bride's equipment you're equipped with every thing you have need of let's stand together you're having fun enjoying the word i am too but that clock is not gonna stop and i know some of y'all got super bowl parties to plan popcorn to buy potato chips to get a hold of i know i don't want to ruin your shopping experience that you get down to business by the way root for my bengals that's where i come from [Laughter] it's actually kind of comical we come up over the river going i was heading north for a meeting and we hit used to be riverfront stadium back when the reds was playing with pete rosen guys they tore that thing down now it's the great american ball park in the back and then they got the big stadium up front you know and we come right over the bridge on 75 they hit that border right at kentucky right when the bengals won the playoffs and they had it you know the yellow fireworks was going off all over the stadium and we pulled over and you could see a glimpse of the stadium coming down and there was so much orange and then people were on their feet and they were screaming and they were freezing to death too it's ohio y'all and they were just carrying on and i thought i looked at that and i thought to myself this is the only joy some people's ever going to get in their life over a big bag of air that i still can't catch very well i can play that though i can do something you can't do and the fact of the matter is brother brahma said don't condemn the sinner when he enjoys his pipe and his cigars and things it's the only joy they know oh children of god please hear my words why can we not experience that on a such higher level that even when life is completely upside down there ought to be something inside of us to be able to raise our hands and say lord you woke me up this morning i was in my right mind you see in every case there's always a silver lining can i say one more i this was out of an old article many many years ago about the procrastinator no no no no no no well the not antagonist what is it when the positive and the negative pessimist and obvious thank you so two boys at christmas all right the one boy gets a bunch of presents he's the pessimist opens everything up breaks them within 10 minutes this off the dad walks out to the barn and the optimus is out there with a shovel his hand throwing manure everywhere what in the world are you doing he said with all this manure in this bond out here i know there's a pony hiding in here somewhere and friends we can either choose to let the holy spirit show us the good things he does for us every day or we can choose to focus but you say i'm hurting yeah i'm in pain yeah i'm sorrowful yeah i'm burdened yes but just choose to look at it the bible said his mercy is new when every morning we have a resource we can tap into pray with me father right now i pray that the holy spirit will sweep over this audience and whatever might be in this congregation be it a sickness be it nervousness depression oppression fear cancer lord be it some evil bitter feeling some unforgiveness be it discouragement across this platform all the way out
