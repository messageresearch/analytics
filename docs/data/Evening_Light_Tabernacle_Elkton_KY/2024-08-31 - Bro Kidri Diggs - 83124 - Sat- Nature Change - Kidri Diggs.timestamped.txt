[1:03:47] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:03:51] the knowledge of him that have called us
[1:03:55] to glory and virtue whereby are given
[1:04:00] unto us exceeding great and precious
[1:04:03] promises that by these ye might be
[1:04:07] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:04:10] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:04:14] world through lust amen let's go to
[1:04:17] Psalms
[1:04:19] 51 Psalms 51
[1:04:28] Psalms chapter
[1:04:34] 51 I want to start at
[1:04:42] verse let's start at verse
[1:04:46] three the Bible says for I acknowledge
[1:04:49] my transgression and my sin is ever
[1:04:51] before me against thee the only have I
[1:04:56] sinned and done this evil in thy sight
[1:04:59] that thou mightest be justified when
[1:05:02] thou speakest and be clear when thou
[1:05:06] judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity
[1:05:10] and in sin did my mother conceive me
[1:05:14] behold thou desires truth in the inward
[1:05:17] parts and in the hidden Parts Thou shalt
[1:05:20] make me to know wisdom Purge me with his
[1:05:23] up and I shall be clean wash me and I
[1:05:27] shall be whiter than snow make me to
[1:05:30] hear joy and gladness that the bones
[1:05:33] which thou has broken May Rejoice hide
[1:05:37] my face from my sins and blot out all my
[1:05:40] iniquities create in me a clean heart oh
[1:05:44] God and renew a right Spirit Within Me
[1:05:47] cast me not away from thy presence and
[1:05:50] take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore
[1:05:54] unto me the the joy of thy salvation and
[1:05:57] uphold me with thy free spirit amen may
[1:06:01] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[1:06:02] of his word you can have your
[1:06:05] seats you know I I believe tonight is
[1:06:08] kind of geared towards the youth but I
[1:06:11] think what we're going to talk about all
[1:06:12] of us you know have to come down these
[1:06:15] roads and tonight by God's by God's uh
[1:06:18] Grace I want to use for a subject change
[1:06:21] of nature a change of nature amen you
[1:06:25] know uh the Bible says in in the verse
[1:06:28] we read it it it said that we're going
[1:06:31] to be partakers of the divine nature of
[1:06:35] God but before we get there we have to
[1:06:38] have a nature change amen but uh I think
[1:06:42] um when it comes to the youth you know
[1:06:46] something about the youth you know uh uh
[1:06:49] there's a breakthrough that has to take
[1:06:51] place you know because even as parents
[1:06:53] one thing I want you to understand
[1:06:56] our job and and and and we've done a
[1:06:58] good job of this putting our kids in a
[1:07:01] good atmosphere you know in a good
[1:07:04] church and and you know where the word
[1:07:06] of God and Truth is being preached we've
[1:07:08] done that Hallelujah but you know what I
[1:07:11] think another thing we've all we've also
[1:07:13] done we've assumed that they've changed
[1:07:17] because they're in the right place you
[1:07:20] know we we we assume that there's a
[1:07:22] desire for God because you know they
[1:07:25] they they may dress right or they may
[1:07:27] you know they they they they may
[1:07:29] participate and sing and all these
[1:07:31] things in church but what are their
[1:07:34] desires amen and the only thing that can
[1:07:37] change their desires is when they meet
[1:07:40] God hallelujah and that has to go beyond
[1:07:43] just coming to church and you know
[1:07:46] coming to church is fine but you know uh
[1:07:49] each individual here each parent
[1:07:51] Hallelujah you know your children better
[1:07:54] than most of us us hallelujah you know
[1:07:57] the things that they Crave You know what
[1:07:59] they do in their rooms you you know what
[1:08:01] they like to watch you know the gam they
[1:08:03] like to play you know you know what they
[1:08:05] do on the internet and a lot of these
[1:08:07] things tells what their nature really is
[1:08:12] but you know a lot of times in church
[1:08:14] young people are good at being uh uh if
[1:08:17] I can say it like this
[1:08:19] chameleons Hallelujah you know what a
[1:08:22] chameleon is a chameleon is able to
[1:08:25] change
[1:08:26] hallelujah it's disposition to hide
[1:08:29] Hallelujah and fit
[1:08:32] in and a lot of times young people are
[1:08:34] very good at that hone they can come to
[1:08:37] church and they they know how to fit in
[1:08:39] they know how to play the part they know
[1:08:41] how to look a Christian amen but really
[1:08:44] on the inside there has to be a nature
[1:08:47] change and young people I want you to
[1:08:50] understand this tonight that all of us
[1:08:52] had to come that way brother digs had to
[1:08:54] come that way because I went to church
[1:08:57] for years and didn't know God hallelujah
[1:09:01] but I sang
[1:09:02] sometimes we got to church on time you
[1:09:06] know I clap my hands sometimes but then
[1:09:08] I walk out of church and go right back
[1:09:10] to doing the same thing I would do why
[1:09:14] because I wasn't
[1:09:16] converted and young people I want you to
[1:09:18] understand unless there is a true
[1:09:21] conversion a meeting with you and God
[1:09:24] where God overpowers you Hallelujah
[1:09:28] that's what has to happen amen you can't
[1:09:30] just be a good church person but God has
[1:09:33] to dominate you God has to overtake you
[1:09:37] God has to impute his thoughts his ways
[1:09:41] his nature everything about you has to
[1:09:43] become the desire of God and until you
[1:09:47] get there you continue to do things
[1:09:50] Hallelujah of another
[1:09:53] nature Hallelujah
[1:09:56] and you know uh uh the hardest part
[1:09:58] about this is uh brother B the hardest
[1:10:02] part about preaching these things like
[1:10:04] this because young people look at their
[1:10:07] life and they'll say well I ain't never
[1:10:09] did nothing
[1:10:11] wrong I'm I'm a I'm a pretty good
[1:10:15] person I ain't never shot
[1:10:17] nobody the
[1:10:20] Lord I ain't never stab
[1:10:23] nobody even when I get in a fight fight
[1:10:25] I say I'm
[1:10:28] sorry you know what they begin to do
[1:10:30] they begin to look at themselves morally
[1:10:33] and then they'll say well I'm all right
[1:10:36] but God's not uhh dealing with you on
[1:10:39] the surface God's not dealing with just
[1:10:41] you and the mor things that you can do
[1:10:44] God wants your heart Hallelujah God
[1:10:48] wants your being God wants to live
[1:10:50] through you Hallelujah and until God can
[1:10:53] dominate you and live through you you'll
[1:10:56] desire the things of the world
[1:10:58] Hallelujah and you can sit in church for
[1:11:00] years waiting for an opportunity to get
[1:11:03] away from it why because you never got
[1:11:08] converted and even as parents and church
[1:11:11] people as parents and church people
[1:11:13] we've seen this already in our
[1:11:15] churches we've seen young people that
[1:11:18] grew up in this church and got a certain
[1:11:20] age and left why because they never met
[1:11:23] God but they sat here they listened to
[1:11:25] the word they even clap their hands they
[1:11:28] even sung specials but never got
[1:11:33] converted but what we want is a nature
[1:11:36] change and it ain't just the young
[1:11:38] people they're
[1:11:41] adults Hallelujah sitting in church for
[1:11:44] 10 15 years and then all of a sudden
[1:11:46] they say I'm just tired of it never got
[1:11:50] converted never got a nature change and
[1:11:53] we know what the prophet of God said the
[1:11:55] Prophet The Prophet now if you listen
[1:11:57] real close Hallelujah I might not read a
[1:11:59] lot of quotes but I'll quote a lot of
[1:12:04] quotes Hallelujah so you got to know
[1:12:07] your message amen when somebody like me
[1:12:09] is preaching Hallelujah but Church you
[1:12:11] you you what the prophet of God said he
[1:12:13] said hey and young people I want you to
[1:12:15] catch this we're out here in Farmland
[1:12:18] amen beautiful country there's a lot of
[1:12:20] farming going on Amen you know but one
[1:12:23] thing I haven't seen it may be somewhere

[1:12:29] sloppy

[1:12:50] the to match the skin put baby oil on it
[1:12:54] shine it up and even put a bow on his
[1:12:56] neck and you say oh you can put a you
[1:12:59] can put a rope around his neck and you
[1:13:01] can walk down the street with it and you
[1:13:02] can say hey man you see my pig my pig is

[1:13:32] mints and you can do all that to a pig
[1:13:36] you can clean it up you can make it look
[1:13:38] like something different but I guarantee
[1:13:40] you you leave it alone for a day by a
[1:13:43] pudle slop and I guarantee you you'll
[1:13:46] come back your pig will be dirty nasty
[1:13:49] Nails will have Clay all in it and it'll
[1:13:51] be eating slop you know why because
[1:13:54] that's it
[1:13:56] nature Hallelujah that's his nature
[1:13:59] it'll look at Mud and it'll say oh I
[1:14:02] can't wait to it raise cuz I want to get
[1:14:05] [Applause]
[1:14:09] dirty you know the pig the pig it hates
[1:14:12] a drop it wants rain so it can be
[1:14:17] muddy so it can get sloppy and gooey and
[1:14:20] nasty and then say oink oink I love it
[1:14:25] that's its
[1:14:26] nature and the only way you can stop a
[1:14:29] pig from being a pig is if you change
[1:14:32] its nature but I haven't seen Hallelujah
[1:14:35] a pig sitting at the dinner table
[1:14:39] these as long as I've been living it's
[1:14:42] always been what eating
[1:14:45] slop why because that's its nature and
[1:14:48] it's okay with that and I want you to
[1:14:51] understand young people adults
[1:14:52] Hallelujah that's also your
[1:14:56] flesh Hallelujah your flesh it want
[1:15:00] something sticky and nasty Hallelujah
[1:15:02] your flesh Hallelujah it'll keep running
[1:15:05] back to the thing that it shouldn't have
[1:15:07] but it craves
[1:15:10] it and I want you to understand young
[1:15:13] people until you are converted you will
[1:15:17] continue to go back to
[1:15:21] sin you hear the preacher come and
[1:15:24] preach on some of the things I'm
[1:15:25] preaching on which probably has already
[1:15:28] been preached in this
[1:15:30] church and it'll keep coming and keep
[1:15:32] coming if you're a child of God why
[1:15:35] because God wants you to
[1:15:45] surrender you know you take a young
[1:15:48] lady who grew up right you know her
[1:15:51] parents had her in church and you know
[1:15:53] she kept herself and she did all these
[1:15:55] things and she may look at herself right
[1:15:57] now and say I'm a pretty good
[1:16:00] girl you know I've never been touched
[1:16:03] I'm virtuous I'm just I'm just pretty
[1:16:06] inside no you've been shaping in
[1:16:11] iniquity that's what the Bible says the
[1:16:14] Bible says in Psalms 51 behold I was
[1:16:18] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[1:16:21] mother conceive me Hallelujah if
[1:16:24] everybody in this place has a mother you
[1:16:27] were born in
[1:16:29] sin
[1:16:31] Hallelujah and if you are here and
[1:16:34] hadn't been and and hadn't been born in
[1:16:37] sin that means you're a supernatural
[1:16:40] being Hallelujah but most of us
[1:16:43] everybody in here has a mother and we
[1:16:45] were born in sin that means our nature
[1:16:49] is
[1:16:50] Fallen Hallelujah we were born
[1:16:53] Hallelujah automatically
[1:16:57] lying if you watch a little baby you
[1:17:00] don't have to teach it to
[1:17:03] lie it's already in it you know why
[1:17:06] because we're born with an attribute of
[1:17:10] fear and Adam and Eve hallelujah what
[1:17:13] did they do because they fear God
[1:17:16] hallelujah they lied they did different
[1:17:19] things why it was the nature of sin
[1:17:22] after sin came into their lives
[1:17:25] and until you meet God hallelujah there
[1:17:28] are things that'll come out of you
[1:17:30] whether you like it or not why because
[1:17:32] you're a product of your
[1:17:36] birth and until your birth with the Holy
[1:17:39] Ghost you always go back and do things
[1:17:42] of that fleshly
[1:17:44] nature Hallelujah you love your Xbox
[1:17:48] more than you love God why it's your
[1:17:51] nature Hallelujah you love YouTube
[1:17:55] videos dressing up and putting on your
[1:17:57] hair and eyebrows and all this other
[1:17:59] stuff you'll love that more why it's
[1:18:02] your
[1:18:05] nature but when you meet
[1:18:08] God God will take those things away God
[1:18:12] can change those things H when you meet
[1:18:14] him he becomes your sacrifice your
[1:18:17] Supreme sacrifice amen and we take on
[1:18:20] the nature of God and you know lately as
[1:18:23] I've been traveling one thing I've been
[1:18:25] realizing brother B there are young
[1:18:27] people in the church who have never even
[1:18:33] repented young people people in general
[1:18:36] we're just
[1:18:39] religious we're here we come we listen
[1:18:41] to the word but we've never felt sorry
[1:18:44] for the life we
[1:18:46] lived we've never come to God and say
[1:18:48] Lord forgive me for living below the
[1:18:51] standard of what you revealed no we just
[1:18:54] find a seat amen the word and it's all
[1:18:57] good and you leave out of here with the
[1:18:59] same old
[1:19:01] desires Hallelujah and we have people
[1:19:05] and young people and people in church
[1:19:07] who have been baptized and never got the
[1:19:10] Holy Ghost you know why cuz they never
[1:19:13] repented there's nothing wrong with the
[1:19:15] product there's nothing wrong with the
[1:19:18] formula repent be baptized and ye shall
[1:19:21] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[1:19:24] you ask yourself tonight Hallelujah if
[1:19:27] you've been baptized in the name of
[1:19:28] Jesus Christ and haven't received the
[1:19:30] Holy Ghost there's nothing wrong with
[1:19:32] the
[1:19:33] formula there something wrong with your
[1:19:38] approach
[1:19:41] Hallelujah you know I've been noticing
[1:19:44] young people brother Pat young people in
[1:19:46] church faithful in good homes good
[1:19:50] church you know you go to their houses
[1:19:53] and the prophet is beinged played All
[1:19:55] Day scriptures being prayed played but
[1:19:59] there hasn't been a
[1:20:02] conversion so what they're doing they're
[1:20:05] being a
[1:20:06] chameleon they'll come in and they'll
[1:20:08] play the part they'll sit down they'll
[1:20:10] wear the clothes you buy
[1:20:12] them they'll listen to The Commandments
[1:20:15] you tell them Hallelujah that that we
[1:20:18] live by don't cut your hair you know
[1:20:21] don't weigh pants don't do all these
[1:20:22] things they'll conform to these things
[1:20:25] they'll become a chameleon Hallelujah
[1:20:27] but if there's no nature change when
[1:20:29] they get a certain age they'll get tired
[1:20:31] of
[1:20:37] it and we're not painting a picture that
[1:20:40] all young people want to go live in the
[1:20:42] world we're painting the picture that
[1:20:45] everybody needs to be
[1:20:51] converted
[1:20:52] Hallelujah we won't make it to Heaven

[1:21:42] something Hallelujah he was a man who
[1:21:45] wanted to serve God but he couldn't why

[1:21:54] understand you can overcome you just
[1:21:56] have to
[1:22:00] surrender I'mma pass on something to you
[1:22:03] that my mom told me when I was young and
[1:22:06] like some of you guys she would say to
[1:22:08] me son when you talk to God don't talk
[1:22:12] to him like he we out in space somewhere

[1:22:21] conversation with god tell God God or
[1:22:25] ask God hallelujah what you want him to
[1:22:28] do for
[1:22:30] you
[1:22:33] Hallelujah but what we do and what we've
[1:22:37] done we've relied on good
[1:22:41] morals oh they had a meeting and I love
[1:22:44] I love oh we're going to have a meeting
[1:22:46] praise
[1:22:49] God and some of you came some of you

[1:22:55] in the good chocolate chip cookies them
[1:22:56] cookies was good now Hallelujah we thank
[1:22:59] God for that but you just being able to
[1:23:02] show your face ain't good
[1:23:05] enough you being able to sing a special
[1:23:09] ain't good enough you being able to pay
[1:23:11] your tithes ain't good enough Hallelujah
[1:23:15] and that's all that God required
[1:23:18] hallelujah hallelujah he have to let all
[1:23:21] the denominations in
[1:23:24] cuz we have people in denomination who
[1:23:27] charactery are more faithful than we
[1:23:38] are
[1:23:40] we are shapen in iniquity in sin did my
[1:23:45] mother conceive me Psalms 58 it says
[1:23:49] verse three it says the wicked are
[1:23:51] estranged from the womb they go astray
[1:23:54] as soon as they be born speaking
[1:23:59] lies oh my that's the nature of
[1:24:06] man speaking lies committing sin doing
[1:24:11] everything that is wrong that's the
[1:24:13] nature we're born
[1:24:16] with but thank God for Jesus
[1:24:20] Christ come on somebody I said thank God
[1:24:24] for Jesus
[1:24:28] Christ I said thank God for Jesus
[1:24:33] Christ cuz because of Jesus Hallelujah I
[1:24:36] don't have to be a product of sin
[1:24:40] Hallelujah I can be a product of Calvary
[1:24:43] hallelujah how Jesus came and took my
[1:24:46] place and washed away my sins and now I
[1:24:49] have the ability to live his life inside
[1:24:53] of me that's what we want we want to be
[1:24:56] so surrendered that Christ can live his
[1:24:59] will through
[1:25:03] you
[1:25:06] Hallelujah think about
[1:25:09] it acts chapter
[1:25:12] 2 when the day of Pentecost came and we
[1:25:15] know the story how how the fire fell and
[1:25:17] all that but then Peter came down and
[1:25:20] started talking to the unbelievers
[1:25:25] and by the time he was
[1:25:27] finished he said he said the same Jesus
[1:25:31] who you crucified he's Lord of
[1:25:33] all
[1:25:36] Hallelujah and then he
[1:25:40] said repent and be
[1:25:42] baptized every one of you for the
[1:25:44] missions of your sin
[1:25:47] Hallelujah and the answer that was the
[1:25:49] answer to to them asking the question
[1:25:52] what shall we do
[1:25:54] H and the reason why they asked the
[1:25:57] question what shall we do Hallelujah
[1:26:00] after Peter started talking about his
[1:26:02] conversion his nature
[1:26:05] change Hallelujah don't y'all realize
[1:26:08] Peter had a nature
[1:26:10] change Hallelujah he was a he was a
[1:26:14] cursing
[1:26:16] fighting cursing fighting denying the
[1:26:19] Lord
[1:26:20] Jesus disciple
[1:26:31] curing fight denying
[1:26:35] Jesus in
[1:26:39] church he did all this while he was
[1:26:42] walking with the
[1:26:43] Messiah but I want you to catch it
[1:26:46] morally he look like he was good he was
[1:26:48] Healing The Sick raising the dead even
[1:26:51] walking on water oh my
[1:26:55] you see the things he can do without a
[1:27:01] conversion oh
[1:27:04] my I don't know about you but I want to
[1:27:07] know
[1:27:08] Jesus I don't want to just be able to to
[1:27:11] to to slide by or Glide by with just
[1:27:14] good
[1:27:16] morals and Peter was gliding by you know
[1:27:18] he was Healing The Sick and raising the
[1:27:20] dead and and feeding 5,000 doing all she
[1:27:24] doing some Supernatural
[1:27:27] stuff

[1:27:37] Ghost the Holy Ghost is everything to
[1:27:44] us what good is your walking on water
[1:27:47] what good is your Healing The Sick and
[1:27:49] raising the dead Hallelujah if it can't
[1:27:51] get you to the other side
[1:28:00] Hallelujah let's look at Peter a little
[1:28:03] bit one
[1:28:06] day Jesus saw Peter and he began to talk
[1:28:10] to him and discerned his heart and told
[1:28:12] Peter come follow me Peter said okay
[1:28:14] left everything stop following Jesus
[1:28:16] right there he stepped into the
[1:28:19] supernatural stepped into the
[1:28:21] supernatural following God so where
[1:28:24] whether he was an unbeliever or not he
[1:28:26] couldn't change who God
[1:28:30] is hallelujah brother what are you
[1:28:32] saying whether you're converted or not
[1:28:35] if God want to do something Supernatural
[1:28:37] in this church he will do
[1:28:39] it Hallelujah he will do it whether
[1:28:42] there's a true conversion or not God
[1:28:45] will do it Hallelujah why because he
[1:28:47] will always show that he's
[1:28:50] God hallelujah he will always show that
[1:28:53] he's God
[1:28:54] now you know he's following the Lord and
[1:28:56] there's a lot of Miracles and different
[1:28:58] things taking place but let's just go to
[1:29:01] the scene where Jesus told Peter he said
[1:29:04] Peter you know I'mma die I'mma give up
[1:29:06] my life on three days I'mma raise up
[1:29:08] again now this man who didn't walk with
[1:29:10] the Lord and all these things he
[1:29:12] couldn't comprehend the
[1:29:14] resurrection so you know what he says
[1:29:17] Jesus said I'm going to give up my life
[1:29:19] and all these things and Peter said no
[1:29:21] master you shall not surely die at that
[1:29:23] moment Walking with God and all the
[1:29:25] things he saw he could still be anointed
[1:29:28] by a
[1:29:34] demon W you mean to tell
[1:29:38] me you can come to church listen to me

[1:30:16] space in his life he could be anointed
[1:30:18] by a demon and the demon could speak out
[1:30:20] of
[1:30:22] him oh my
[1:30:25] Lord is

[1:37:14] ah we won three
[1:37:20] times Jesus said you going to deny me
[1:37:24] I want you to see a nature
[1:37:27] change because he hadn't received the
[1:37:30] Holy Spirit no matter what came out of
[1:37:34] his
[1:37:35] mouth he always felt subject to the
[1:37:38] nature
[1:37:40] inside he had a pretty good confession
[1:37:43] Lord I'mma go with you everywhere Jesus
[1:37:46] said you going to deny me not me I'm a
[1:37:49] message belie I'm a Believer I grew up

[1:38:04] Peter said not
[1:38:07] me not
[1:38:10] me Healing The Sick raising the Dead
[1:38:13] Walking On Water now this is the sticky
[1:38:18] part because the third time he didn't
[1:38:21] just deny it
[1:38:23] he could give himself over to cussing
[1:38:25] everybody
[1:38:30] out that was a
[1:38:33] disciple that was a man walking with
[1:38:35] Jesus that was a man who sound a
[1:38:38] supernatural Hallelujah Time After Time
[1:38:41] After Time but with no conversion his
[1:38:43] flesh will still overpower everything
[1:38:52] else I want you to understand no matter
[1:38:55] how strong you think you are morally
[1:38:58] without the Holy Ghost you will always
[1:39:06] fail Peter not only does he deny it he
[1:39:10] goes way down inside he said I told you
[1:39:13] bunch
[1:39:19] of cuss like he ain't never cured before

[1:39:56] to hear a parent say about their
[1:40:00] child not my
[1:40:05] child you look at your little angel when

[1:40:52] to the
[1:40:54] are no it was who you was why because it
[1:40:58] was your
[1:41:00] nature and until you get a nature change
[1:41:04] there's no more desire for tobacco
[1:41:06] there's no more desire for alcohol and
[1:41:09] all the things that this flesh wants the
[1:41:12] Holy Ghost what does it do it pushes it
[1:41:14] down where it's supposed to
[1:41:18] be Hallelujah puts it in place the only
[1:41:22] thing you can do that is if there's
[1:41:24] something inside your spirit that can
[1:41:27] dominate your
[1:41:29] nature and the only thing that can do
[1:41:31] that is
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:34] Christ
[1:41:37] Hallelujah even when you preach messages
[1:41:39] like
[1:41:40] this people hear you but then they'll
[1:41:43] start examining themselves and
[1:41:45] say I ain't did nothing wrong I'm I'm
[1:41:47] pretty
[1:41:49] good
[1:41:51] Hallelujah okay

[1:42:05] centered really loved the
[1:42:07] Lord you know and one thing I want you
[1:42:10] to understand about our prophet he had
[1:42:13] to get the Holy
[1:42:15] Ghost he had to have a what nature
[1:42:19] change cuz he even said it on tape he
[1:42:22] loved the
[1:42:26] fight but you talk about God getting rid
[1:42:28] of evidence one day he some boys he was
[1:42:31] going some boys beat him up beat him up
[1:42:34] bad you know what he did he went back
[1:42:36] and got his
[1:42:37] gun that was his nature he went back and
[1:42:41] got his gun hid in the bushes and waited
[1:42:44] on everybody to come because he wasn't
[1:42:46] just going to shoot him in the
[1:42:49] foot he wasn't bluffing he was go shoot
[1:42:52] him in theot foot he was going to kill
[1:42:55] somebody that was his
[1:42:57] nature he loved to fight Hallelujah he

[1:43:04] me a little hot
[1:43:10] leprechaun oh my you know every every
[1:43:13] every time I hear a prophet talk about
[1:43:15] he got some Irish in him all I think
[1:43:17] about Conor
[1:43:20] McGregor oh my wow
[1:43:24] Irishman some of y'all might not know
[1:43:26] who that is but I think you
[1:43:28] do you just trying to give me that look
[1:43:30] like you don't know what's going on in
[1:43:32] the
[1:43:41] world it's all right we are in this
[1:43:45] world but we're not of this
[1:43:47] world Hallelujah but look he waited
[1:43:51] everybody all right
[1:43:53] he waited on the on the boys to come and
[1:43:56] he jumped out the bushes with the gun
[1:43:57] with the bullet in it he said the
[1:43:59] boys start streaming he said don't
[1:44:01] scream now you going to meet your
[1:44:04] maker and you know what he did he wasn't
[1:44:07] bluffing he pulled the
[1:44:11] trigger it was the
[1:44:15] nature of an Angry Young Man who got
[1:44:20] beat up who was ordained to be a prophet
[1:44:30] you know what we call message purist
[1:44:34] they don't believe brother Brenham had
[1:44:35] this
[1:44:38] side but he had this side before he got
[1:44:41] converted he was just like any other
[1:44:44] angry Hallelujah Reckless
[1:44:49] individual and it took God to shap and
[1:44:52] more hold him into the image of his
[1:44:56] mind Hallelujah because without the Holy
[1:44:59] Ghost he jump out the bushes with a gun
[1:45:02] Hallelujah pull the
[1:45:04] trigger but God jammed the
[1:45:07] gun just like he did Peter Hallelujah
[1:45:10] got rid of the evidence he put another
[1:45:12] one in there jammed the gun
[1:45:15] again and until all the boys got out of
[1:45:18] his sight he picked up the bullet put it
[1:45:20] back in there and the gun fired what was
[1:45:22] it it was God protecting his
[1:45:29] seed God is your
[1:45:33] protector we don't have to walk tipping
[1:45:35] toeing I don't know I don't know what
[1:45:37] kind of Christian I'mma Be I just don't
[1:45:39] want to fail I just don't want to upset
[1:45:42] God I'm just so scared to get my
[1:45:45] life God is the savior not
[1:45:48] you God is the deliverer not you he
[1:45:52] wants you to give your life to him it's
[1:45:54] his job Hallelujah to make you out to
[1:45:57] what he says you
[1:45:59] are
[1:46:02] Hallelujah but God changed his nature
[1:46:06] there are times when a prophet got so
[1:46:08] low so sad he wanted to commit
[1:46:15] suicide but God so rich in
[1:46:18] Mercy kept
[1:46:20] him through all his pain through all his
[1:46:23] ordeals all the things he went through
[1:46:25] Hallelujah to give him a nature to press
[1:46:29] on with him Hallelujah to where he could
[1:46:31] be preaching the gospel and a man who
[1:46:34] who won so many fights with his fist you
[1:46:36] know who was a boxer who was a hunter
[1:46:39] and all these things could stand on the
[1:46:41] pull pit and let somebody spit in his
[1:46:46] face and not do
[1:46:50] anything but feel sorry for the
[1:46:55] man think about
[1:46:58] it the only way he could do that is if
[1:47:00] it's nature was
[1:47:03] changed cuz we talk all we
[1:47:06] want we talk all we want about oh I got
[1:47:09] the Holy Ghost you know I just love you
[1:47:14] brother now let me put this on record I
[1:47:17] don't want nobody spitting in my
[1:47:21] face I believe that Paul was for the
[1:47:23] prophet and he did good with it that
[1:47:26] don't have to be duplicated by Brother
[1:47:28] digs I'm
[1:47:30] good
[1:47:36] Hallelujah but it happened to him just
[1:47:38] like it happened to David and David
[1:47:40] forgave the man and the prophet forgave
[1:47:41] the man also what was it it was the
[1:47:44] spirit of the Lord upon
[1:47:46] them amen but it had to be a nature
[1:47:49] change from somebody who would always
[1:47:52] fight his way out of it to now just
[1:47:54] standing there and letting God take
[1:47:57] over that's what we see that's what we
[1:48:02] saw but we see that in the
[1:48:05] prophet we saw what God did through the
[1:48:08] prophet and how his nature was changed
[1:48:11] but I want you to understand something
[1:48:13] because he was the prophet that doesn't
[1:48:16] mean his children were born with the
[1:48:18] Holy Ghost
[1:48:23] his children had to come the same
[1:48:26] way
[1:48:28] Hallelujah
[1:48:29] okay now we going to get into something
[1:48:32] I ain't going to be too much longer but
[1:48:33] I want you to be attentive and listen to
[1:48:35] this
[1:48:37] listen the prophet is f to talk about
[1:48:40] Billy Paul we know who that is
[1:48:43] right listen what he
[1:48:45] says and parents I believe when I read
[1:48:50] this we all share the same the same
[1:48:53] sentiment of value that the prophet is f
[1:48:55] to say about his son about our children
[1:48:58] listen he says when job was the oldest
[1:49:02] book in the Bible and when job an old
[1:49:04] man and just before the disaster
[1:49:06] happened in his home he got kind of
[1:49:09] worried and he had a bunch of children
[1:49:10] and they were wory going out mingling
[1:49:13] with the things of the world and and all
[1:49:17] of and all of we parents know what a
[1:49:20] feeling that is when your children your
[1:49:23] very heart young people you hear that
[1:49:27] when your parents are strict and they're
[1:49:29] trying to keep you away from everything
[1:49:31] it's not because they're trying to be
[1:49:32] mean it's because you are their
[1:49:36] heart they love you they don't want to
[1:49:39] see your life messed
[1:49:42] up so mothers and fathers they get into
[1:49:45] protective
[1:49:47] mode he says listen your very heart
[1:49:51] begins to mingle with the World Get Out
[1:49:54] Among the
[1:49:55] unbelievers I don't suppose Billy is
[1:49:58] present on this time I think he's out
[1:50:00] maybe talking to brother woods but in
[1:50:03] our city we don't have a Christian
[1:50:06] school and I know some of you are going
[1:50:08] some of you are homeschooled why that's
[1:50:11] because you are your parents
[1:50:14] heart they want to protect
[1:50:18] you listen what the prophet says we
[1:50:21] don't have a Christian School and
[1:50:23] there's a bunch of worldly children
[1:50:25] girls and boys too and when I thought of
[1:50:28] sending my boy to that
[1:50:30] school can I get an amen
[1:50:36] parents see what we're doing we're
[1:50:38] thinking about what you're going to meet
[1:50:39] when you get
[1:50:41] there all the different things you're
[1:50:43] going to have to go through when you get
[1:50:44] there we're not trying to keep you from
[1:50:46] socializing we're not keep trying to
[1:50:48] keep you from being ball players and
[1:50:50] track stars and all this stuff no we
[1:50:52] thinking about all the things you may
[1:50:54] have to mingle
[1:50:57] with listen he
[1:51:01] says when your children your very heart
[1:51:03] begin to mingle with the world Get Out
[1:51:06] Among the unbelievers Hallelujah he says
[1:51:08] but in our city we don't have a
[1:51:10] Christian School and there's a bunch of
[1:51:11] worldly children girls and boys and when
[1:51:13] I thought of sending my boy to that
[1:51:16] school knowing listen young people
[1:51:18] listen real good now I'm talking about
[1:51:20] the prophet's children
[1:51:24] Hallelujah he said knowing that
[1:51:27] everything that I drilled into him
[1:51:30] unless hallu what he's saying is I
[1:51:33] raised them up in a Christian home I
[1:51:35] raised them up going to church I raised
[1:51:37] them up talking about God and now he
[1:51:39] says knowing that everything that I
[1:51:42] drilled into him unless he be he becomes
[1:51:45] really
[1:51:48] converted now he's looking at his boy
[1:51:50] Billy Paul who's in church giving out
[1:51:53] the prayer card and he's saying my boy
[1:51:55] ain't
[1:51:58] converted but he was right there with
[1:52:00] the
[1:52:01] prophet white there pring under the
[1:52:04] prayer CS doing all those things and
[1:52:06] wasn't even
[1:52:09] converted
[1:52:12] my look it goes even deeper than that
[1:52:15] Billy Paul was on the other end of the
[1:52:17] prayer line God told Brother Bram wake
[1:52:20] Billy up so he could see the angel of
[1:52:22] the Lord because he's a part of your
[1:52:24] ministry but right here the prophet of
[1:52:25] God is saying he's not even
[1:52:32] converted he said unless he becomes
[1:52:35] really converted really come to Christ
[1:52:38] that is all of his nature would be
[1:52:41] changed he'd be swept out from under my
[1:52:46] hands even though being right there in
[1:52:48] the prayer line even though seeing the
[1:52:51] angel of the Lord and all these things
[1:52:54] even though being connected to the
[1:52:56] ministry he says unless he gets truly
[1:52:59] converted he will be swept out into the
[1:53:08] world really come to Christ that is all
[1:53:12] of his nature will be changed he be
[1:53:14] swept out from under my hands as soon as
[1:53:18] he got with that worldly bunch
[1:53:23] you are no match for the world without
[1:53:27] Christ inside of
[1:53:33] you
[1:53:35] Hallelujah we are no match for the Devil
[1:53:38] Without Christ inside of
[1:53:40] us you may think you strong enough to
[1:53:44] have a worldly boy friend without Christ
[1:53:46] you are not a
[1:53:51] match
[1:53:57] amen he said he be swept out under me as
[1:54:00] soon as he got with the worldly Bunch
[1:54:02] because the very nature in him no matter
[1:54:05] being a good boy that doesn't having a
[1:54:09] minister father a religious home he
[1:54:12] saying none of that
[1:54:15] matters unless he's truly
[1:54:19] converted unless he meets God
[1:54:23] but we don't approve of world somebody's
[1:54:25] house we don't approve of worldly things
[1:54:26] in our home we try to live by the grace
[1:54:29] of God like Christians are to the
[1:54:31] influence set before him I known if if I
[1:54:35] known if he be lost parents this is what
[1:54:38] we have to stand on he's talking about
[1:54:40] Billy and he says I know if he be
[1:54:44] lost he' certainly walk over a righteous
[1:54:47] home to be lost by parents if you living
[1:54:51] the way you supposed to it's up to God
[1:54:53] to save your
[1:54:55] children
[1:54:59] Hallelujah he said and I want him to
[1:55:02] have to walk over my life Hallelujah
[1:55:05] that's what he's saying he's saying I
[1:55:07] got the Holy Ghost amen I've been
[1:55:09] converted and for my child to go out in
[1:55:12] the world they got to disapprove or they
[1:55:14] got to not acknowledge my
[1:55:19] change they got to not acknowledge that
[1:55:22] I I am a real
[1:55:25] Christian that's where I want to
[1:55:28] be that's
[1:55:30] right I want to live so much like God
[1:55:34] that if my children decide to go to the
[1:55:36] world they have to walk over my
[1:55:40] life
[1:55:42] Hallelujah and I want him to walk over
[1:55:44] my life he have to walk over walk over
[1:55:46] the Bible he have to walk over the blood
[1:55:48] of Jesus Christ because I certainly by
[1:55:51] the grace of God presented in front of
[1:55:54] him hallelujah what are you saying
[1:55:57] parents we present the nature change
[1:56:00] unto our
[1:56:05] children but if his nature is in change
[1:56:09] he will go right on just the same and
[1:56:12] how I think of the day that Billy
[1:56:14] entered high school and how I thought oh
[1:56:16] my and knowing that he yet he had oh had
[1:56:19] been baptized certainly but never ever
[1:56:22] made a full
[1:56:28] surrender and if you ever heard Billy
[1:56:30] Paul's
[1:56:32] testimony he
[1:56:34] smoked he drank he went to bars did all
[1:56:39] that
[1:56:41] while he seen the angel of the Lord he
[1:56:44] saw Miracle after mirle traveled to
[1:56:47] Africa seeing healing after healing
[1:56:49] going with his daddy all over the world
[1:56:51] but with without a conversion he still
[1:56:54] was pulled to the
[1:56:57] bars oh my without a nature change
[1:57:01] Church couldn't save
[1:57:10] him and I say to you young
[1:57:14] people ask yourself do you really love
[1:57:18] God if you really love God you'll want
[1:57:20] to serve him
[1:57:24] if you really love God there will be
[1:57:25] something inside of you saying I want to
[1:57:28] get
[1:57:29] closer I want to get
[1:57:31] closer now Billy Paul got to that
[1:57:34] place but there was a time in his life
[1:57:38] where he didn't know
[1:57:39] God he was a
[1:57:43] chameleon come to church pass out tracks
[1:57:46] do all that stuff do everything his
[1:57:48] daddy would do and a lot of times you
[1:57:50] listen to the tapes he'd say where Billy
[1:57:52] Billy was outside talking to somebody
[1:57:54] while the service would be going on he
[1:57:56] wasn't even
[1:57:59] interested seeing all the things he
[1:58:02] saw
[1:58:03] parents I want you to never take it for
[1:58:07] granted just because your child is in
[1:58:09] church that they are where they're
[1:58:11] supposed to be
[1:58:14] spiritually but that was his boy Billy
[1:58:17] but he felt that way about all his
[1:58:21] children listen he says I think
[1:58:23] sometimes in going to school now I think
[1:58:26] seeing Becky and Sarah and Joseph that's
[1:58:29] all his
[1:58:30] children all of them had to be born
[1:58:33] again all of them had to have a nature
[1:58:36] change and look at how candid he spoke
[1:58:39] about his own children he didn't put
[1:58:41] them on a pedestal because he was a
[1:58:43] prophet you know what he said they need
[1:58:45] a nature
[1:58:47] change listen what he says he says Becky
[1:58:50] and Sarah and Joseph and these high
[1:58:52] schools and things where all this goes
[1:58:54] on at he says I think I'll take them and
[1:58:57] get them back in the mountains and raise
[1:58:59] them up there where the Indians live and
[1:59:03] then he has a thought he says now he
[1:59:04] want to take them up there with the
[1:59:06] Indians let them live with the Indians
[1:59:08] where the atmosphere was more pure in
[1:59:10] the mountains because he saw so much
[1:59:12] filth in
[1:59:13] school but then he comes back he says
[1:59:16] but here is what it is what's in the kid
[1:59:21] is going to come
[1:59:22] out he's talking about his own
[1:59:26] children he said I can take them up to
[1:59:28] the mountain let them live with the
[1:59:30] Indians but if they want to drink they
[1:59:32] going to drink if it's in them if they
[1:59:34] want to party they going to party if
[1:59:36] it's in them what he's saying is if my
[1:59:38] kids are not converted it don't matter
[1:59:40] where I take
[1:59:46] them he said what's in the kid is going
[1:59:48] to come out no matter where it is it's
[1:59:50] got to it's is going to come out if evil
[1:59:54] young people listen to this now he says
[1:59:56] if evil is in there it'll come out in
[2:00:00] the Indian
[2:00:02] camp Oh my he said if good is in there
[2:00:06] it'll come out in any Camp if you go to
[2:00:09] BCF and CBF and ABC and NBC no matter
[2:00:13] what camp you go to whatever is in you
[2:00:16] is going to come out
[2:00:22] he said it's what's in the kid that
[2:00:24] makes up the kid that's what's inside of
[2:00:26] you and what you are is what you'll
[2:00:29] probably be the rest of your
[2:00:32] life that's why we are not to play with
[2:00:36] God because you think about it I could
[2:00:39] be preaching like I'm preaching right
[2:00:41] now preaching hard and you could be
[2:00:42] looking down at your shoe not paying me
[2:00:44] no attention that could be you cutting
[2:00:47] God off for the rest of your life
[2:00:53] that's how important it
[2:00:57] is this could be a sealing moment for
[2:01:05] somebody he said you're on a changing
[2:01:09] spot but then he goes on he
[2:01:13] says you make yourself when you're young
[2:01:17] you set your
[2:01:18] Ambitions to what you want to do
[2:01:22] and what you're trying to achieve in
[2:01:24] life you think of it and as you think of
[2:01:27] course your mind is presented in your
[2:01:30] mind by an unknown something that
[2:01:33] dominates your mind and then when it
[2:01:35] becomes in your mind then you speak it
[2:01:38] Hallelujah that you're going to do it
[2:01:41] and then you and then your Ambitions
[2:01:45] drive you to it but what are you saying
[2:01:49] the things that dominate your mind
[2:01:51] usually will control
[2:01:55] you now I'm about to
[2:01:57] close you make yourself when you
[2:02:01] young and to all of us we have to ask
[2:02:03] ourself right now what dominates my
[2:02:07] mind what dominates
[2:02:10] me is it you may say Brother D I just
[2:02:13] can't wait till I get married when I
[2:02:16] meet that tall dark and
[2:02:20] handsome boy of a
[2:02:24] person if that dominates your
[2:02:27] mind this is what'll happen you'll get
[2:02:30] that man tall dark
[2:02:36] handsome and he'll become your
[2:02:38] replacement for
[2:02:41] God and then your whole life will
[2:02:44] revolve around
[2:02:46] him and then what God have to do is show
[2:02:49] you that he's always supposed to be
[2:02:51] first place not second
[2:02:56] place Hallelujah so you have to think
[2:02:59] about what's dominating your thoughts
[2:03:01] and what you want to be and what are you
[2:03:03] trying to
[2:03:04] achieve now right now in your Christian
[2:03:07] Journey you said brother Jesus I'm too
[2:03:10] young at the age of 12 Jesus was in the
[2:03:13] synagogue
[2:03:15] teaching at the age of 12 the prophet of
[2:03:18] God said the only thing that stopped me
[2:03:20] from receiving the Holy Spirit Spirit
[2:03:22] was an evil
[2:03:26] spirit that's what he
[2:03:28] said
[2:03:30] Hallelujah even in moments like
[2:03:33] these where God is being so direct and
[2:03:37] talking to us so direct why because he's
[2:03:40] trying to get somebody to climb up
[2:03:42] higher he's trying to get a young person
[2:03:44] maybe to acknowledge Him stop being
[2:03:47] religious and acknowledge God come into
[2:03:49] a personal relationship with God
[2:03:52] know him know his voice know his touch
[2:03:55] you're not too young for that Hallelujah
[2:03:58] you're not too young to feel the
[2:04:00] presence of God you're not too young to
[2:04:02] Hallelujah to be pricked in your heart
[2:04:05] to say Lord forgive me for living below
[2:04:08] the
[2:04:10] standard remember the Bible says when
[2:04:13] they heard these things about the gospel
[2:04:15] they were pricked in their heart and
[2:04:17] asked asked uh Peter what can they
[2:04:20] do he said repent be baptized you shall
[2:04:23] receive the gift of the Holy
[2:04:25] Ghost but that's where it
[2:04:28] starts starts with true
[2:04:32] repentance but if you feel like you all
[2:04:34] right you'll never enter into
[2:04:37] repentance if you feel like you've never
[2:04:39] done anything wrong because you've been
[2:04:41] in a good home and you've been raised
[2:04:43] right and you haven't been out in the
[2:04:44] world let me tell you something you
[2:04:46] still a sinner
[2:04:53] all of
[2:04:54] us hallelujah we could have been raised
[2:04:57] in the best homes had the best schools
[2:04:59] the best teaching all of that but until
[2:05:03] we
[2:05:04] repent we're nothing but a
[2:05:08] sinner
[2:05:11] amen so we all come musicians come we
[2:05:14] all have to come to the place young
[2:05:16] people what are you saying what am I
[2:05:17] saying I'm saying hallelujah come to a
[2:05:20] place in your life where you say to
[2:05:22] Jesus Lord I accept you as my
[2:05:26] savior I receive you as my Savior by
[2:05:29] faith and I want to serve you out of the
[2:05:32] abundance of my heart I want to give my
[2:05:36] life unto your
[2:05:39] will and until you get there you're just
[2:05:42] a good church
[2:05:46] member
[2:05:49] Hallelujah listen I tell the story a lot
[2:05:52] y'all play something soft I tell a story
[2:05:53] a lot I know a young
[2:05:56] girl who would when you have meeting she
[2:05:59] would come up and sing with the choir at
[2:06:01] this time she was 18 years old she get
[2:06:04] up and sing with the choir and they
[2:06:06] shake the place Bo the anointing come
[2:06:08] down and be so powerful we be in
[2:06:12] there having such a good time but there
[2:06:15] one time they church group came up and
[2:06:18] on her way up the same with the church
[2:06:21] she dropped dead right there in
[2:06:23] church in a meeting just like this she
[2:06:27] dropped dead right in
[2:06:29] church and y'all know this brother real
[2:06:32] good brother Jewel brother Jewel told
[2:06:35] everybody y'all sh be be
[2:06:37] quiet prayed for her and she got back up
[2:06:43] Hallelujah she got back up but she
[2:06:45] didn't go to her seat she finished the
[2:06:47] mission she went up and finished singing
[2:06:49] with the choir and she went back but you
[2:06:53] know
[2:06:54] what all those 18 years of being raised
[2:06:57] in
[2:06:58] church and coming to church and singing
[2:07:01] in the
[2:07:03] choir up until that
[2:07:05] moment she was never
[2:07:09] converted she never knew the
[2:07:12] Lord and that shook her in her boost
[2:07:14] that she could drop dead at any time
[2:07:16] playing
[2:07:18] church so she went back home nobody
[2:07:21] knows what really happened inside but
[2:07:23] she went back home on that Tuesday they
[2:07:25] had a testimony service about you know
[2:07:28] you ask the young people as they come
[2:07:29] back from Camp what did you learn from
[2:07:31] Camp where they asked her they asked the
[2:07:34] the young people what did you get out
[2:07:35] the meeting this weekend and other
[2:07:37] people telling testimonies when it got
[2:07:39] to her she
[2:07:41] smiled and she said I just thank the
[2:07:44] Lord for being here and she dropped dead
[2:07:47] in
[2:07:48] church but this time she didn't get back
[2:07:51] back
[2:07:53] up God gave her
[2:07:55] space to get truly
[2:08:00] converted even though she was raised in
[2:08:02] a good home she was faithful on the
[2:08:05] choir she'd go to the meetings and all
[2:08:08] these things she still wasn't converted
[2:08:11] she still didn't have a nature change
[2:08:14] why get to the point to where you meet
[2:08:16] death to get serious with
[2:08:19] God why not like the ible says the day
