knocked down pretty good from that go with stuff i guess so amen so we pray for him sister nancy and and sister vicky and each one i mean let's just go before the lord in prayer heavenly father we come before you lord jesus once again lord and we just want to say that we're thankful lord jesus to be able to come out in a midweek service lord jesus to worship you and to praise you and and to call you our god our father and to praise you for all that you are and everything that you mean to us lord and we just want to thank you for a good week so far lord everything lord walking with you it's just so wonderful father we just ask god that you just touched those needs that's been already spoken and prayed for we pray once again god that you give each one a special touch from you lord for we know that you're a very present help in time and trouble lord if we pray father that you'd help me lord just to get out of the way that you might speak to your people the things that you once said tonight father we thank you for your word and as we open up we ask god that you just give us the inspiration to speak father in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen amen turn your bibles if you will to the book of let's go to galatians the book of galatians chapter 2 and verse 20. i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me the life and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i'm thinking it's corinthians over in first corinthians 1 and verse 16 for i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight amen i want to speak this evening on reliance on reliance amen praise the lord amen we uh think of what the world says or what people says about christians sometimes of how that you know they might say of course they say a lot of things but one of the main things a lot of things they'll say sometimes is that you know it's the weak people that need god amen the weak people need god you know and uh so or people might say that you know weak people need god as a crutch as a crutch to help them out in their weakness and so forth well i happen to think that he's an awesome crutch david thought so when the giant needed to come down right amen and so shamgar he thought that god was pretty good and then he needed him we're living in a world and there's a lot of people that get the attitude and the idea that they don't need no help from nobody and you know uh and just go make it on their own right just go make it on their own and so we uh know that god has to bring us to a place to where he's needed amen how many reasons god is needed amen we need god we're needy people amen you're going to face a lot of things that you're going to find that you know you can't that you can't take care of you can't whoop we know that the layout see at church age they didn't think they needed god they have needed nothing amen and so when we talk about faith here we see that this faith is used for a purpose right it you know we know one place it says that without faith it is impossible to please god the very thing that people say they were weak about and so forth is the very thing that paul said that he lived by amen i like that you know and i'm just you know i i believe that uh we are we're going to learn learn more and more by the grace of god that we need him more and and that we have to rely on him more amen i mean we rely on god we rely on faith isn't that right faith is something that we rely on we believe when we can't hardly see how it could possibly be yet we believe anyway we we need faith we can't live without that faith and just to recap a little bit if that's okay we all know and i've been taught i've taught many times here that you live in and you live in two worlds or one or the other world should i say there's only two worlds that you can actually live in now i'm talking about a everyday living basis one of them of course is faith the other one is unbelief or doubt amen you're going to live by one or the other in every action in everything that you do and i do mean everything every decision that we make amen all right people don't like it but god is basically he gave us two roads he says here's a crossroad this one leads to hell this one leads to heaven which one do you want to take because i heard brother branham saying this week he says god don't send you to hell use yourself to hell because he made a way for you not to go if you chose to go down that road it's on you you chose to go down that way people just don't like that they don't have more of an option that's the only option to have one or the other and so is it in our lives our daily life we either live by faith or we live by doubt or unbelief that's where a lot of our frustrations our anger or or every all those type of things come in people people rely on something in their life now if people don't think they rely on stuff but what about all the drugs that they use and all the all of the stuff that they fall back to that and i was thinking about that this week how that we all fall back to something we fall we lean on something amen and paul here he's saying that the life that he's crucified with christ amen yet he said yet i live but what i do is i live the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god that's what he lived by amen and paul had a lot of obstacles in his life and he needed god in every one of those obstacles he really did amen how many realizes that you know and god is the object of worship we know that god wasn't god at one time but you know he had to make something to worship him amen when god created you and me he created us with a need he let us come into this world with a need excuse me but can i just go with my mind for a minute okay we have a need because he allowed the fall to come now the way i understand it if i'm not not incorrect that adam was supposed to speak his sons and his daughters into existence it wasn't supposed to be by a woman travailing and being in pain the way that she is is now isn't that right because of the fall that's how i got programmed in it and she's gonna bring forth life into the world through much pain but it was supposed to be the spoken word huh if we to come that way folks we wouldn't have had a need well lord was that true or not they were awful quiet no because we'd have been we'd have been perfect it would be the way that it was supposed to be and god would have never been able to doub what do you call it display his attributes of what god really is so really when i get to thinking about faith i'm thinking about reliance on god i think about it brings in worship huh it brings in praise to almighty god because you know how many know that god when you say god well god means an optic war i mean god is that object of worship he's worthy to be praised and if that's what he is then that's what we come to church for that's what we do on a daily basis is worship god amen and worship him for what for what he is for what he means to us for who he is for how he supplies amen praise be to god i learned a little bit this week a little bit more just a little bit because i believe that the one thing that probably we all need tonight is to exercise that faith a little more huh i know i do i i gotta exercise that faith more amen praise the lord amen praise be to god reliable what a friend we have in jesus amen what a friend how many knows that when we grow up as we grow up as children we rely on mom and dad i mean we totally rely on they become god to us amen remember the story of how that the little child who was thundering and lightning and everything said mom stay here you know and he said no you'll be oh god watch us over now i want god with skin on you know and so to become god support rely on them when we get to the age of uh you get maturity we get to where we're out on our own and holding our own and so forth not rely on them some more but all through our life it doesn't matter how old we are we're always relying on somebody amen what a better what a better person to rely on than god completely rely on him i like that how many likes a reliable friend a friend that you can lean on somebody that can help you when you need when you have a need somebody help you that's what god does he's a reliable friend praise be aren't you glad that he said he never your free or be friends in this world might leave you but christ will never leave you amen jesus will never leave you he'll never forsake he is a how does that song go amen he's a lot he's a reliable friend that's what jesus is amen i'm thankful for that praise the lord amen rely we rely on god in everything we realize amen that that's what the people what the people think is a crutch is actually the life source it's what we're supposed to rely on and it's the most powerful it makes even though you're weak yeah even paul said i'm weak amen all human beings oh let me just put it this way in in perhaps a comeback so to speak people who think that christians that need god you know that are weak no they're actually just wise they're smart they know they have a need those people that don't think they do they're blind to their own need they don't even realize they need it amen they don't realize how weak they are or how bad a shape they're in yeah but somebody that relies on god knows the condition that he's in he knows that he needs a different frame of mind he needs a different way of thinking it has to be god's thinking not his own thinking because his own thinking always gets him in trouble it's always the wrong way look at the world look at the direction it's going that's where your carnal mind will take you amen sorry brother tommy just comes to mind some of you texted that they've got rooms now in these schools where the kids can go off and act like dogs or cats go meowing and barking and carrying on yeah we're gonna promote them maybe they're a cat or a something maybe they're you know come on folks you know where they're gonna go next i only got one thing to say about these school shootings they want the answer don't they they don't know how they know how to stop it there's only one thing that i can say to them and that is that they're acting perfectly normal for what they're teaching them they're exactly they're doing exactly what they are being taught that they're animals they come from animals go out there and see if them animals don't devour each other that's exactly what they do if you're not of their tribe they're going to wipe you out go in the monkey world i don't care if you're a baby i don't care what you ask them them thinks them dominant they'll kill them little things if they're not from that tribe and you teach them to come from monkey but you did it you took god out now i have no respect for human life there's no after there's no reckoning you teach them there's no right and wrong huh they taught them that they're just acting upon it amen that's the truth folks you take god out and there you got it chaos amen but i'm glad i'm glad that whenever you have god whenever you have faith in god it's what you're supposed to live by on a daily basis you know i got to thinking i was just so full of joy this weekend speaking about brother bannon one time he would come up here to the pulpit and he said well no i don't really have a message huh i don't have a message maybe we'll just thought to a scripture somewhere and see what the lord will have i'm like what in the world i don't know about you but actually nervous this guy get a lot of i didn't have i have nightmares folks about coming up here and not having nothing i have nightmare i said they fixed they called me out and i i got no message oh it's a nightmare to me i dream about all kinds of things that's what i think it is you know and i thought well here brother man can kiki come up here and he cannot have a message and yet he can preach a great message so i have a question for you tonight why good answer for one thing i realized is that he is so full of it already huh he's so full of god already all he's got to do is open the bible he can go huh he can just take off anywhere and i'm like lord help me to be that way help me to be so full of god that i could come up here and not have anything and god still give me something he'd still say what he wants to say he'd still do what he wants to do in the service i believe we need more of that don't you more rely on faith in god man i understand and i do a lot of this and i really like what brother bam said about a lot of the messages that he gets he's driving down the road amen and he'll think of a pyramid or he'll think of a certain thing that he wants to talk about and perhaps some pyramid exemplifies but he's staying healed by a little pyramid as he's gonna throw down the rope on a piece of paper amen and then he have a paper pyramid and maybe he'll have uh just a little something else something else and it looks like greek writing probably when he gets up here to the pulpit all right what was the pyramid about what was this about and he just as god begins and that's what i do a lot i mean i try to keep god in my mind and just keep constantly living by faith and let god just show this and show that and amen and gel it down and discern the other and then and then just preach what god wanted to preach amen but i have never done what he did and i come up here with absolutely nothing that i know of amen might have seemed like it to y'all but i was supposed to have some amen oh yeah that's right sometimes we get up here and we never do don't ever do seem to get off the ground amen tonight a lot of times the hardest huh small crowd and not this much pool amen ain't got your amen corners or whatever folks that's when you find out whether somebody got something or not amen it takes a lot of prayer amen takes a lot of faith and paul's that's what he lives by amen let me just give you an example i like a little example and so forth oh my you know this week last saturday i guess it was and and i have wanted and needed some kind of a something with a bucket around on the farm and so my neighbor of course he passed away not so long ago and and and he's got a big farm a lot of equipment he got all there they were having a big sale there of different equipment and there was an old backhoe out there that they were digging a field line on one of his houses i guess and and right in the middle of digging that fuel line it just sat there for about two years it just sat in the field and growed up around it and it was uh oh maybe it's an old back forward backhoe and uh anyway i said well they don't that was it i wonder you don't know if that'll be at the sale and sure enough they drug that thing up there barely got it up there big bat flat tired almost you know the big tire were almost flat and when they went to try to crank it up it wouldn't crank and they had put a new battery in it and new solenoid everything and i had my eye on that backhoe i wanted that backhoe i said if it'll dig a little trench about 30 foot long that means it runs i need something that just runs i'm not worried about everything else amen you should have seen me driving out of there everybody looked through the smoke billow and i smoked everybody out leaving the place almost but anyway i prayed about it i said lord i'd sure like to have it but don't let me pay too much for it and let it be let it run if i do get it let it be usable lord if that's your will i try not to go over a certain price range talking to the lord right not over price range and so forth and i was but i really wanted it but anyway so we went to bed and on and so forth and uh you know it ended up i started at about 2 000 and it started about stopped at 24 so i paid 2400 for it that's not bad for backhoe amen it read it anyway i didn't know what to do for sure but i knew that somehow we could get it right and so after i bought i went home got all my tools got hydraulic fluid and got all everything every tool i thought i could might need to try to get that thing running when i got there some old man a wise old man he had he had they had it running because it was front of another piece of equipment they wanted to try to get back so they could get their equipment and he had it right i just praise the lord it runs but i brought my air compressor i was going to air him up and i heard up my mother tires and everything and sure enough it ran it backed up went forward just out of the other and amen and they hired it all up and drove it on home clicking the clock you talk about a click of the clock you ain't never heard of it my neighbor like the next day my neighbor says did you make it home i thought i'd never make it home i said yeah we made it i ran it i was getting that back patio already for everybody here next week but and trying to get that and running up now sure enough moved my gravel got my gravel moving it and uh right in the middle of all of that i was digging up some dirt and stuff and then that engine just quit it just quit and my heart did too i was like oh lord lord i was pretty confident it was you lying to tell me to go ahead and get this thing you know but now i'm not so sure anymore but lord it's got to be you know man i'm going to call joke you wouldn't have to pull this thing up and sell it for a job that's awfully expensive y'all but anyway so i was tired i was tired and riddled today or whatever i just i'm going home i'm going in i'm getting me a little nap i said something you're just gonna pick a nap i went in take a nap and rest a little while and i said well if it's blown up that's pretty much it but you know i said lord and i pulled the old dipstick out of the oil and it looked like it had diesel fuel in it and i'm like oh but that don't look good but anyway i said i guess that's it but and then we you know i says where's your faith you know did god tell you to get the thing or not you know but anyway and so afterwards i told my wife i'm going back out there to work on see what happens it says it couldn't have been i said it ain't the bold engine i said because if it was if the engine would have blowed with all that we ain't got no mosquitoes anymore around there i don't blow them all out with all that smoke and i thought that engineer would put it up that's kind of probably what it would have sounded like if it was the engine but it was running just turned and just stopped that's this wheel maybe it isn't the engine let me let him check the fuel line and i checked over there by the i think it was the uh what do you call that fuel injector or whatever took a line loose and and there's no fuel coming out i said should be fuel in there so i traced it back and there i go you know my ain't no diesel mechanic and i went trace it back to the gas tank and there was a t come out from underneath the gas tank and of course there's a big fuel filter over here i didn't bother with the main filter why i didn't i don't know i just now thought why didn't i go and check see if that thing's clogged i didn't i left that thing along went back here by the tank because i had a feeling something about the tank and when that thing little coupling coming i had to undo one line and and so that i could take a big wrench and maybe try to twist it off i don't know what i'm gonna rupture inside of there what i'm gonna do but i'm gonna twist this thing off turn it off sure enough and it brought that thing down and there was something that was about that long the size of a cigarette maybe a little bit thicker and sticking way up there and it was just duped with stuff i mean and i when i had put six gallons of fuel in it so whenever i unplug that thing you're gushing down i pushed my finger up in there and stopped it and had to do the cleaning with this hand while i was stabbing it and i'm like i wanted it you know flung it off and wiped on the grass there it is and the base back there can testify she heard somebody out there praise the lord donald said all the time he said i was in the house praying honey i'm praying now that lord just help me to have faith you're not so doubtful right have faith god god can do it he can help you figure this out sure enough put that back in and after a bit to recharge my body pop right back up again amen and i thought that's living by faith everything you do just have faith about it don't let it get you down just keep believing there's a purpose in it all amen if you've got to be junk it's got to be junk but never lose your faith in god amen don't let you can't and i was like really you know anything like that about a day's work of a work it's just not really worth twenty four hundred dollars but anyway so i was very thankful i said lord now it's purring referring for now so praise be to god and i thought look you know just help me in everything lord everything comes along because i thought man lord you know before i make a purchase before advice i like god to be my decisions don't you i need his guidance i need to be able to rely on almighty god remember but a man said he was up in those mountains and he was trying to get off the mountain and all that snow and he was a guide he thought he could find his way and he went in circles didn't he about twice or three times he come right back up to that dead deer and he says god help me i i'm no god right he thought he was but he realized he was not a god how many believe that in every one of our lives don't think that you guide your life let christ guide your life rely on him lord help me to rely on him in everything that paul said he didn't matter what it was he always relied on god he had faith in god that's how he lived he lived by faith the bible says if you're a just person if you're just remember the just shall live what by faith this is what martin luther i know maybe abc's tonight but martin luther whenever they're trying to say you've got to pay for your sins and you got to do this and you got to do that you got to do this and he says you know the bible says the judge shall live by faith he said that's it period no nothing don't give me all this other stuff let me live by faith and that's the way paul lives from day to day it didn't matter he didn't he says he had no certain dwelling place he'd been shipped back he had all kinds of this and all kinds of problems but no matter where he was no matter what he was going through he just kept his faith in god whether he was shipwrecked and paul was a good example of somebody that lived by faith shipwrecked thrice beaten with rods he said left for dead oh he had a terrible time but he realized if i'm going to live i'm going to live because i have confidence and it's up to him whether i live or die amen praise be to god you love him hallelujah aren't you glad that you have such a wonderful master to rely on to lean on amen i like that song leaning on jesus leaning on the everlas what a fellowship what a joy divine huh when problems come along like well like i mean you could get down and just oh you could just miss beyond that though what does brother uh jewel say though wally wally woos or something and yeah you know all dom and the blues and sad and everything else hey there's a plan that makes you sad am i right and folks i believe now more than ever we need to live daily by faith because of what the world and the way that the world is going we got to live by faith paul he lived he says the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god it creates your world how many believes that hebrews 11 it talks about faith we know they understand that worlds were created by by god amen by faith the worlds were created your world is created by faith amen amen praise be to god brother baby he says you know the most important thing the important thing one of the most important things that we need to master is to master if we expect to be fulfilled of god's desire in our life we have to master human ability amen we rely on our own selves so much amen we got to master that no ability i don't care whose it is will ever be usable in the sight of god god has to get your abilities quit relying on your abilities get rid of that and rely on him amen that's what brother bammy had to do when he was lost in the mountain he relied and prayed to god lord help me and god i'm miraculously open he says i you know i pray he prayed didn't he he prayed god lead me and then he just put one foot in front of another he says i'm going to just go i'll be god's going to believe me i mean that's how we got that's how we got to live just walk by faith god guide you god will lead you oh it's so good when he leads you isn't that good and guess what better man said he was heading straight into canada he was going the complete wrong way something could stop or whatever and he turned and looked and got opened through that whole snowstorm he opened up the fog and all that stuff and cleared away over by the tower there was a line that went down and you can grab that line and go all the way down to camp and got opened up so he could see that and he says he was going the wrong way your own ability you'll go the wrong way but let him guide you look over there go grab the hold of that lifeline and don't ever let go of that thing just hang on to that amen praise the lord and that's how i want to live you know i think about coming down you know as we get older we learn to rely on god more amen folks if if you don't rely on god when you get older all your aches and pains you you're gonna have plenty to complain about you know how you know how i can tell i'm getting older my wife mostly can tell and you being my church wife you can probably tell too because i talk about my aches and pains more we talk about the meditation medications that we got to take and all of this other thing and that's it that's what we talk about all the time is all of our problems and all the things we got to do to counteract that or the other we don't talk about a little bit of a hundred yard dash we're in or how good we feel or how great things are we're i'll talk about something you know about a family it's part of getting old i could talk about this here talk about my knee hurting right now or has all day here that's okay it's all just part of it but we live by faith praise be to god amen could be a lot worse isn't that right it'd be a lot worse folks one of the worst things i think that you can do is have to go to a nursing home huh be stuck in some room i guess you can go out to a back patio once a while and look at the little birds flying around but i'd really like to do a little more than that if it could god bless those folks help them bring that right be thankful faith faith you know it's just so it just it's awesome i mean he believes it you may because you're you're relying on that faith to legit to guide you you're relying on that's there's nothing more perfect to rely on just like david we know that he didn't amen he would never leave you he's a constant friend christ is a constant friend worldly friends might forsake you but christ will never forsake amen praise be to god i just love to be able to rely on him amen and to lean on him i like that i like the word not just rely but lean on him lean on him lord i need you for this lord help me to make the right choice here lord help me with this amen and i did a little work for sister sarah trying to get their porch railing up i'll tell you what before i go to a job i like to pray about that job by the time you provide more concrete you better pray a lot it'll pour out better it'll finish better every job you do when you pray about it first and put god in it keep god in the front front everything works out so much better amen put god in it first and it'll work out so much better amen and it might turn out you say well brother that doesn't always turn out so great it would have been a lot worse huh it'd have been a lot worse and if it gets really bad he'll help you out of it amen how many believes that that's right praise be to god amen i like that living by faith the faith of the son of god that's every constant day you know because sometimes we there's let me just say this i wonder sometimes if there's not too many sunday morning and wednesday night christians and the rest of time people don't think much about god don't pray but don't preach the bible much but come to church and do their religion or whatever you know what i thought about that this is what i can come come up with that if somebody truly is just a wednesday night a sunday morning christian they're not really a christian they're not really a christian because somebody knows a christian is sold out locks there he's 24 7 he's completely surrendered almighty god everybody else is just sad you know that's just that that's not that you're put on a make-believer perhaps amen then i thought about thought about brothers and sisters even even when we come down to the door of death people come down to the door of death and then all of a sudden they want to get close to god and they want a relationship with god they want fellowship with god huh i can come up with this i wrote this down that if if your relationship with god and faith in god wasn't very great all your life it's probably not going to be so great in death either huh for one thing you don't know when you're going to be taken and how quickly you're going to be taken so we want to be living we want to be living in the having the kind of relationship and fellowship with almighty god faith in him speaking with him having fellowship here with him and knowing that he's taken you and gotten you through so many troubles he's got you through so many trials he's delivered you so many times he's hold heal oh he's always been there for you there's nothing more great than asking god for something and and even how on the way to church i had asked god for something and i said lord you answered that prayer and i didn't even realize thank you jesus you actually answered my prayer i didn't realize it so i know i do you you're reminding me you know and just to know that god got to answer your prayers never fellowship that relationship that's what you want to have when you get down
