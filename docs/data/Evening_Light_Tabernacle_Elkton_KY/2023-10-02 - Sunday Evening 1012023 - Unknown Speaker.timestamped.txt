[10:43] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we

[10:48] chapter 2 and verse 11.
[10:51] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 11 and
[10:53] we'll read down through verse 22 and
[10:55] take our text by the help of the Lord
[10:58] it's been an honor and privilege to be
[11:00] here
[11:03] verse 11. Ephesians chapter 2.
[11:08] it says wherefore remember that ye being
[11:11] in times past Gentiles In the Flesh who
[11:13] are called uncircumcision by that which
[11:15] is called the circumcision is the flesh
[11:18] made by hands
[11:20] but at that time that at that time you
[11:23] were without Christ being anywhere
[11:25] aliens from
[11:27] Commonwealth of Israel Israel strangers
[11:31] from the Covenant of Promise having no
[11:32] hope and without God in the world
[11:35] Hallelujah but now
[11:39] in Christ Jesus you were sometimes were
[11:41] far off are made nigh by the blood of
[11:44] Christ
[11:45] for he is our peace who have broken down
[11:48] both one and that thought who hath made
[11:51] both one and hath broken down the middle
[11:54] wall a partition between us having
[11:56] abolished in his flesh the enmity even
[11:58] the law of Commandments contained in the
[11:59] ordinances for to make him himself Twain
[12:02] one new man
[12:04] so make making peace that he might
[12:07] reconcile both unto God
[12:09] one body by the cross having slain the
[12:12] enmity thereby through and through him
[12:14] we both have access by one Spirit under
[12:17] the father
[12:18] now therefore you're no more strangers
[12:20] and former foreigners but fellow
[12:23] citizens with the Saints and of the
[12:25] household of God
[12:27] and to build upon the foundation of the
[12:29] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being
[12:31] the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the
[12:34] building fitly formed fanned together
[12:36] growth unto the Holy Temple and Lord
[12:39] in whom you all sort of build it
[12:41] together for habitation of God through
[12:43] the spirit you may have your seats
[12:44] tonight just want to take a thought if I
[12:46] might uh from verse 14 there I want to
[12:48] talk on walls walls
[12:58] you know it's what is a wall
[13:00] something that holds you back
[13:03] you can't go through that wall right
[13:04] there there's something there's a berry
[13:06] I want to talk on walls to
[13:08] no
[13:09] and talk about what the Lord Jesus is
[13:12] doing for us and what he's already done
[13:14] for
[13:16] that's why he gave you the Holy Ghost
[13:19] that's why he gave so that you could
[13:21] have fellowship with him
[13:23] it doesn't matter what say it like this
[13:24] he says he says God Longs he said God
[13:27] Longs from fellowship he earns he wants
[13:30] people to speak with him
[13:34] he wants people to speak with him
[13:38] to talk with him
[13:40] now so many times we think we got to
[13:43] talk to God in such a manner I'm going
[13:45] to get right on your face here now you
[13:46] talk to God in such a highly manner you
[13:48] think God is so big but if you look in
[13:50] God in Simplicity God was so simple that
[13:53] he would come down and get in flesh so
[13:56] that he could understand what it's like
[13:58] to have a toothache he can understand
[14:00] what it's like to have a headache he can
[14:02] understand what it's like to have a
[14:04] complex he can understand what it's like
[14:06] to have somebody fighting against you he
[14:08] can understand what it's like to have
[14:10] Birds he can understand what it's like
[14:11] to have mental battles he can understand
[14:13] exactly where you're at tonight and he
[14:16] knows exactly what you have need of

[23:12] liar
[23:14] or whatever I do work for you and he
[23:17] lies to you does he do work again
[23:19] [Laughter]
[23:21] no you have somebody work on their car
[23:23] on your car and they say they're gonna
[23:24] fix it and you give them 500 and they
[23:27] don't fix it and they said they fixed it
[23:31] okay no big deal
[23:35] if we would do that in the natural now
[23:38] let's discern who it is that's building
[23:39] these walls for us you know what the
[23:41] devil wants to do he always wants to
[23:43] bust down your fellowship he doesn't
[23:45] want you to have Fellowship around the
[23:47] word of God he doesn't want you to have
[23:48] Fellowship without King Almighty because
[23:50] he knows when God's people home Glory
[23:52] get together with him things begin to
[23:55] change and they come out of those
[23:56] meetings and they look me right in the
[23:58] face
[24:00] shakes me because they've got a look of
[24:02] fire the same look of fire that Jesus
[24:04] had
[24:10] Satan has lied to you
[24:12] he's lied to you he's lied to you he's
[24:16] lied to you
[24:18] and you don't have to sit there and
[24:20] stink and take it
[24:26] I'll give you I'll give you an example
[24:27] the reason this is so passionate to me
[24:30] for like three or four years
[24:32] I felt like I'd done something wrong
[24:35] haven't you ever been there
[24:36] like feel like you just
[24:38] you love the Lord
[24:40] you come to church you want to do you
[24:43] want something but you just can't get
[24:46] there
[24:49] amen buddy
[24:53] not making fun of you I know because
[24:55] I've been there and I know I'm not the
[24:57] only one that's been there
[24:59] so many times we come to church and man
[25:00] we
[25:02] I need something so bad but I don't even
[25:04] know how to get what do I need to do
[25:07] can I show you
[25:14] take your hands off
[25:18] how'd Moses win a victory
[25:22] and when he couldn't lift him up when he
[25:25] cuts are in there there were brothers
[25:27] that came alongside and prayed for him
[25:28] Hallelujah her brothers that came
[25:31] alongside when he got weak oh Hallelujah
[25:33] but every time his hands were up there
[25:36] was victory in the camp
[25:39] Glory let it be a lesson to you you know
[25:42] how Jesus won the victory he didn't
[25:44] fight him when he gave his hands he
[25:45] stuck his hands up on the cross Saturday
[25:48] and he raised his hand and said father
[25:50] forgive them
[25:52] [Music]
[25:57] Hallelujah Satan's an absolute liar
[26:00] I want to read these listen he comes to
[26:03] church so he might be sitting right
[26:04] there I don't know I'm gonna put him
[26:06] over here on this empty one cause nobody
[26:07] wants to get back to him you're all
[26:09] right kids
[26:10] he's over here in the corner well you
[26:12] know what I'm about to say listen first
[26:15] of all you're bound stay right there and
[26:16] shut your mouth
[26:21] is that the word
[26:25] I know he wants to get in everybody's
[26:27] ear and try to Rob them of the
[26:28] fellowship that God wants to have for
[26:29] him but I'm here as a messenger as I'm
[26:31] not a messenger I'm here as a Son of God
[26:33] a soldier of the Cross and I'm here to
[26:35] exert my authority and my right over
[26:37] Satan and by the way Satan you lost it
[26:39] calvary you lose at the end of the book
[26:41] and you lost your battle with me because

[26:45] you couldn't hold me away he couldn't
[26:49] bring you down

[27:01] throw quotes at you well Glory how do

[27:10] word of God and he tries to place it
[27:12] over your life it'll make you feel
[27:13] guilty make you feel like you got no
[27:15] hope but I'm here to expose the LIE of
[27:17] Satan there's hope there's Faith there's
[27:20] Grace there's a power of the Holy Ghost

[46:06] Lord
[46:07] uh
[46:09] I like to have myself a fit in my
[46:11] recliner I start crying here I'd sit for
[46:13] three or four years thinking I've done
[46:16] something wrong get past it a little bit
[46:18] but it always seemed like it come back
[46:19] on me but right there God broke down
[46:22] that wall and he revealed what it was it
[46:24] was Satan trying to tempt me that I'd
[46:27] done something wrong and from that
[46:29] moment I looked at Satan I said If

[46:32] I don't care who it is I know what it's
[46:34] like to sit in that place where you got
[46:36] a wall right in front of you you feel
[46:37] like you can't break through but a lot
