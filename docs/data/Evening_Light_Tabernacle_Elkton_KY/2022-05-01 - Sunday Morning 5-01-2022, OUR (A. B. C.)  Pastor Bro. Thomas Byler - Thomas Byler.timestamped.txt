[48:33] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who

[48:48] that the youth is renewed like the
[48:50] eagles
[48:57] he made known his ways unto moses his
[48:59] acts unto the children of israel
[49:07] you will not always child neither will
[49:09] he keep his anger forever
[49:17] whereas the heavens is high above the
[49:19] earth so great is his mercy toward them
[49:22] that fear him
[49:31] like as the father pitteth his children
[49:33] so the lord pitieth them that fear him
[49:41] as for for man his days are as grass as
[49:44] a flower of the field so he flourisheth
[49:53] but the mercy of the lord is from
[49:55] everlasting everlasting upon them that
[49:58] fear him and his righteousness unto
[49:59] children's children

[50:31] bless the lord all my soul god bless you
[50:34] may be seated brother brian
[50:47] morning brothers and sisters
[50:50] i was a we were reading that psalm this
[50:52] morning
[50:54] that one thing you know
[50:57] what was it
[51:01] the 14th verse it says for you knoweth
[51:03] our refrain our frame
[51:05] and remember that we are dust you know
[51:08] no matter where you're at in your life
[51:10] old or young
[51:11] doesn't make a difference god knows who
[51:13] you are
[51:14] he knows what's going on in your life
[51:16] where you're at in your life what you're
[51:18] feeling in your body and he cares about
[51:21] it you know sometimes everything that
[51:23] goes on in our life whatever we're going
[51:26] through
[51:26] there's things there trying to cloud
[51:28] that out but as you read that song you
[51:30] know that whole hundred and third
[51:32] somewhere you know as human beings we're
[51:35] pretty blessed people to know that god
[51:36] actually has us in his mind and cares
[51:39] about us
[51:40] and then we were
[51:42] those that weren't here i don't it
[51:43] wasn't on
[51:45] on wednesday brother thomas was
[51:48] playing that uh thing about what's going
[51:50] on in in ukraine and i was thinking
[51:53] the brother was talking about
[51:56] and you would if you want to turn
[51:59] me to the third chapter of proverbs the
[52:01] brother was talking about how the whole
[52:03] world
[52:04] is trying to isolate the country of
[52:06] russia
[52:07] where they basically where they couldn't
[52:09] buy and sell
[52:11] and i was just thinking there was
[52:12] another point
[52:14] i don't know if he said it or not the
[52:16] most important thing they're
[52:17] doing
[52:19] is
[52:20] in an information way the only
[52:22] information that you're hearing
[52:24] is the other side you're not hearing
[52:27] they're totally shut down
[52:30] and
[52:31] don't get me wrong i'm not taking this
[52:32] out here but
[52:34] in america or in europe or any they're
[52:36] only showing one side you're only seeing
[52:39] one side of the information everyone is
[52:41] making i'm not saying it that you should
[52:44] have a different opinion but i'm saying
[52:46] they're both keeping them from buying
[52:48] and selling
[52:49] and they're isolating that country in a
[52:51] way that the only information that
[52:53] you're seeing on your tablets your
[52:56] phones your radios whatever is the
[52:59] information they want you to hear and
[53:01] they want you to see and whether it's
[53:04] good information don't get me wrong it
[53:05] could be the right it could be the right
[53:08] information or the right subject that
[53:10] you need to hear but they are so
[53:11] controlling the information that you're
[53:14] only hearing what they want you to hear
[53:16] or see what you want to see so it
[53:18] requires you to actually research more
[53:21] to know what's going on and i'm not
[53:23] taking aside don't
[53:24] but the thing i see the most is in the
[53:26] world that we're in they're trying to
[53:28] control
[53:29] what you think what you see where you
[53:32] can go
[53:33] who you can associate that's what we're
[53:35] coming to and
[53:37] no one knows how many years you have
[53:39] before they have total control over it
[53:41] but it's a it's a it's not a thing to be
[53:44] afraid of just like the brother was
[53:45] saying as brother thomas will tell you
[53:48] you know as christians it should make
[53:49] you want to go closer to christ not get
[53:52] further away from christ everything that
[53:55] happens to you as an individual should
[53:57] make you want to get closer to christ
[53:59] shouldn't make you want to get further
[54:01] away from christ if something in your
[54:04] life is wanting to make you get further
[54:06] away from christ then there's that
[54:08] whatever that is is not coming from the
[54:11] lord it's coming from your enemy and you
[54:14] have to and i was just thinking this
[54:16] morning
[54:17] you know
[54:19] it's what you
[54:20] eat every day is who you're going to be
[54:24] what you bring into your mind bring into
[54:26] your heart is going to be who you are
[54:28] and what you are and uh
[54:31] i'll just read out of this third
[54:33] proverbs here this morning
[54:35] i was sitting there all morning i was
[54:37] listening doing different things and
[54:39] i'll just go here to proverbs it kind of
[54:41] goes along
[54:42] with what we were reading in this 103rd
[54:45] psalm this morning
[54:47] but i was also thinking you know
[54:50] from another perspective
[54:52] you know us as christians
[54:55] the difference between you and the
[54:57] people out there in the world your
[54:59] minister
[55:00] the man that's feeding you the word of
[55:02] god
[55:03] he'll tell you something different than
[55:04] the world will tell you your ministry
[55:06] will tell you don't believe me
[55:09] because i tell you believe me because
[55:11] god's word and the message of the hour
[55:14] reflect back to the truth that you're
[55:17] hearing that's the difference between
[55:19] them out in the world they want you to
[55:21] believe what they tell you and they
[55:23] don't want you to question
[55:25] what they're telling you
[55:27] the a real man of god is going to tell
[55:29] you to get in the word of
[55:32] god and get in the message of the hour
[55:34] to prove what you're hearing you
[55:35] shouldn't be you shouldn't be afraid
[55:38] to read your bible and listen to the
[55:40] message of the hour
[55:42] so what your pastor's telling you what
[55:44] everyone's telling you you have to have
[55:46] an experience in the word of god that it
[55:48] reflects back to you what you're hearing
[55:51] is the truth if if you're not having
[55:53] those experiences
[55:55] when the chips fall
[55:57] you're going to be believing what
[55:58] someone tells you other than what you
[56:01] experienced for yourself and that's an
[56:03] important thing that you have those
[56:04] experiences
[56:06] yourself where you know in the word of
[56:08] god where you can go
[56:10] to have your comfort or to have an
[56:12] answer for someone you have to know
[56:15] self you have to study yourself you've
[56:18] got to prove yourself in the word of god
[56:20] you know i i i can't help who i am you
[56:23] know you don't spend all those
[56:25] all those years on active duty there's
[56:27] certain things that you learn being on
[56:29] active duties all those years is you
[56:32] just you just can't believe something
[56:34] you've got to prove something you know
[56:36] you have to prove what you believe in
[56:38] the word of god you have to walk in what
[56:40] god shows you and you have to believe
[56:42] what god shows you and as as you
[56:45] continue to add those things to you
[56:48] you'll become that
[56:50] statute of the perfect man that's behind
[56:52] me
[56:53] and i i've been talking here for
[56:55] probably five minutes and i hadn't even
[56:56] read the scripture but if you return
[56:59] with me to proverbs the third chapter
[57:02] you know and here i go man before we get
[57:04] started you know
[57:06] i used to be an intelligent analyst
[57:08] on active duty and the thing you do as
[57:11] an intelligent analyst
[57:13] is that you take raw information
[57:16] which would be and you can apply it here
[57:19] you take the message of the hour and the
[57:21] word of god
[57:22] that's that information you take all
[57:24] that information in
[57:26] and you have to it goes back to what i
[57:29] just said you have to prove
[57:31] what you're reading you have to search
[57:33] it out you have to reason not reason
[57:35] don't i didn't mean to say it that way
[57:38] but you have to let the word of god
[57:39] reflect back to you what you're
[57:41] believing what you're reading it should
[57:43] become so true to you that there are
[57:46] nothing else matters in your life other
[57:49] than what you're reading
[57:51] and god is showing you in this word but
[57:54] you have to read all whether it's out
[57:56] there in the world whether it's someone
[57:58] telling you this someone telling you
[57:59] that whatever that information is you've
[58:02] got to take it back to the word of god
[58:04] and you have to prove it you just can't
[58:06] believe something because you if it
[58:08] isn't proven you've got to take all that
[58:10] information you're seeing out there what
[58:12] people are telling you you have to prove
[58:14] it by the word of god if you're not
[58:16] doing that you can find yourself
[58:18] believing something that's not in the
[58:20] word of god in the message of the hour
[58:22] and then start here at the first verse
[58:24] and solomon says this everyone knows
[58:27] this chapter
[58:29] brother branham taught numerous messages
[58:31] out of this chapter in the third chapter
[58:33] of proverbs
[58:34] i've always said before that you could
[58:36] read a chapter a day and go back every
[58:38] month
[58:39] read a chapter a day in proverbs and
[58:42] solomon wrote this book
[58:44] probably four or five thousand years ago
[58:46] and the truths that are in this book are
[58:48] just as true today as it was when
[58:50] solomon wrote it
[58:52] we have more technology maybe than
[58:54] solomon had but the truths in this in
[58:57] the proverbs hasn't changed
[58:59] you can give people all the technology
[59:01] in the world and people will still be
[59:04] people there you will do the same things
[59:07] they will act the same way unless god
[59:09] gets in that heart and gets in that life
[59:12] and i'll just read my son for getting
[59:14] out the law but let thine heart keep my
[59:17] commandments
[59:18] for the length of days and long life
[59:20] peace shall they add to thee let not
[59:23] mercy and truth forsake thee by them
[59:25] about thy neck rock them upon the table
[59:27] of thine heart and
[59:29] go through what i was saying
[59:31] solomon is telling his children is
[59:33] telling us as believers
[59:36] that we have to take the word of god and
[59:38] bind it in our hearts we have to take it
[59:40] out of the mind and bring it down into
[59:42] the soul that you are into your very
[59:44] heart that it god is breathing and
[59:47] living inside you and he goes on to say
[59:50] so that thou shall find favor and good
[59:52] understanding in the sight of god amen
[59:54] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[59:57] and lean not on thy own understanding
[59:59] and that's an important thing not what
[1:00:01] you think you believe but what god
[1:00:04] actually says for us to believe that's
[1:00:07] the difference in it and he goes on in
[1:00:09] all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[1:00:12] shall direct our paths be not wise and
[1:00:15] thin years fear the lord and depart from
[1:00:17] evil
[1:00:18] it shall be held to thy navel and marrow
[1:00:21] to thy bones on the lord with thy
[1:00:23] substance and with thy first fruits and
[1:00:26] of all thine increases so so that would
[1:00:29] barnes be filled with plenty
[1:00:31] and i pressed the cell bust out with new
[1:00:33] wine and you could look at those
[1:00:35] scriptures right there no matter what
[1:00:37] whether you're
[1:00:38] laying on the side of the street with no
[1:00:40] money or whether god has given you
[1:00:41] millions of dollars shouldn't change who
[1:00:43] you are he goes on to say
[1:00:47] my son despise not the chastising of the
[1:00:50] lord neither be worry of his correction
[1:00:52] that's where the world is at this
[1:00:53] morning they won't take correction if
[1:00:55] you tell someone that he's wrong they'll
[1:00:58] want to fight with your tooth in there
[1:00:59] and believe what he wants to believe and
[1:01:02] he goes on from whom the lord loveth he
[1:01:04] correcteth even as a father a son in
[1:01:06] whom he delighted happy is the man that
[1:01:08] findeth wisdom and the man that geteth
[1:01:11] understanding for the merchandise of it
[1:01:14] is better than the merchandise of silver
[1:01:16] and the gain thereof and then find gold
[1:01:19] she is more precious than rubles and all
[1:01:21] the things that thou can desire are not
[1:01:24] to be compared onto her i was going to
[1:01:26] go into john the 15th chapter but
[1:01:30] you know like the brother was saying on
[1:01:32] on that thing on wednesday
[1:01:34] just like brother thomas has been
[1:01:36] talking about the last couple of weeks
[1:01:38] you know it's really important for us as
[1:01:41] believers
[1:01:43] to have an experience
[1:01:45] brother daniel when he came back and the
[1:01:46] sister coming back from the camp that's
[1:01:48] really important for you to have that
[1:01:50] hitching post to have that experience
[1:01:52] where you know that god has settled with
[1:01:54] your soul and in your life no matter
[1:01:57] what happens in this world you know
[1:01:59] you're tied to something more than your
[1:02:01] own ideas and your own opinion you're
[1:02:03] tied to jesus christ and him alone
[1:02:05] that's the only thing that matters no
[1:02:07] matter what you see going on in the
[1:02:08] world what our country wants to be what
[1:02:11] other countries do it don't make a
[1:02:12] difference anymore the only thing that
[1:02:14] matters is what christ does for us is

[1:33:38] so next weekend i don't know who got to
[1:33:40] see the film or whatever and not the
[1:33:42] film but a lot of us seen
[1:33:44] the ukrainian report or update
[1:33:47] uh that brother i'm trying to think his
[1:33:49] name now
[1:33:51] very coffee yes brother barry gave here
[1:33:54] wednesday amen and we just
[1:33:57] he gave a detailed report of how we can
[1:33:59] get money into some of the believers
[1:34:02] that
[1:34:02] are either stuck in their basement or
[1:34:04] whatever it might be and
[1:34:06] help some of those that have made it out
[1:34:08] you know and i don't mind
[1:34:10] helping the ones that made it out or the
[1:34:12] ones that are in but i kind of prefer to
[1:34:14] help the ones that are perhaps still
[1:34:15] stuck in there because i'm sure they
[1:34:17] probably need it more than anything but
[1:34:18] next weekend we want to take our
[1:34:21] annual first part of the year
[1:34:23] uh missionary offering would that be
[1:34:25] okay
[1:34:26] next weekend and then we're going to go
[1:34:28] in that direction with it this time to
[1:34:30] help our our ukrainian brothers and
[1:34:33] sisters would that be okay
[1:34:35] amen and so to continue to just pray for
[1:34:38] them
[1:34:39] amen i just tell you i know it's like
[1:34:41] brother brian said you know you only
[1:34:43] hear half the story
[1:34:44] and so but i do know that whatever it is
[1:34:47] it's a bad situation over there amen
[1:34:50] all the way around amen and i may say a
[1:34:53] little bit more something maybe i'll say
[1:34:54] it while i got it on my mind but you
[1:34:56] know everybody has perhaps a different
[1:34:58] thought of it and brother
[1:35:00] i mean different ones have a different
[1:35:02] idea of what perhaps prophecy or
[1:35:04] scripture or whatever it is
[1:35:06] that's being fulfilled because of it but
[1:35:08] to me
[1:35:09] this is just my five sense
[1:35:12] to me
[1:35:13] i know that everybody's ganging up on on
[1:35:15] russia i mean they're really being
[1:35:17] bringing hard on them you know
[1:35:19] and
[1:35:21] perhaps you know the united nations the
[1:35:23] whole thing to me
[1:35:24] that they have to be pretty
[1:35:27] ticked off they have to be
[1:35:29] pretty mad
[1:35:30] at somebody
[1:35:32] to blow them up with a nuke right
[1:35:35] and we know that
[1:35:36] uh
[1:35:37] we've got to nuke one of their nukes on
[1:35:39] with our name on it isn't that right but
[1:35:41] ibam said that they would they would
[1:35:43] blow us up the same way with rome will
[1:35:45] be blown up in one day
[1:35:47] so to me perhaps this is just something
[1:35:49] that's
[1:35:50] getting them in their mental
[1:35:53] state in that right in the mental state
[1:35:55] to be able to pull that lever or or or
[1:35:58] to send those missiles amen
[1:36:00] but i do know it's got to get into a bad
[1:36:02] shape you know before they do something
[1:36:04] like that and by god's grace we plan on
[1:36:06] being out of here right
[1:36:08] amen you know you get crazy thoughts
[1:36:10] going through your mind i mean it's got
[1:36:12] crazy thoughts going through your mind
[1:36:13] you know of perhaps a new coming perhaps
[1:36:16] a nuke coming and blowing one of our
[1:36:18] cities up and what that would do to you
[1:36:20] and i knowing the prophet said before
[1:36:22] one new bus right we'll be gone
[1:36:26] amen but that's just the crazy thoughts
[1:36:28] the devil tries to put in your head well
[1:36:29] maybe maybe what if one does come i
[1:36:32] still believe that we'll be gone before
[1:36:34] the judgment of
[1:36:36] uh the fire of the wrath of god comes
[1:36:38] down don't you
[1:36:40] but we do know no doubt it's
[1:36:42] everything's always it's always getting
[1:36:44] ready things are moving and all of the
[1:36:46] cogs are moving into their place you
[1:36:48] know because
[1:36:49] uh you know the world has rejected god
[1:36:51] isn't that right and when you reject
[1:36:54] mercy when you do reject grace there's
[1:36:56] only one thing left and that is to stand
[1:37:00] god's judgment if you do not accept his
[1:37:03] mercy you
[1:37:04] must not might
[1:37:08] you won't get out of it you won't have
[1:37:10] an option you will
[1:37:12] stand his judgment
[1:37:14] amen so i don't know about you but i
[1:37:16] sure am glad to be a part of the first
[1:37:18] aren't you
[1:37:19] god bless you this morning i know
[1:37:20] everybody's just kind of melancholy this
[1:37:22] morning so we're just going to try to
[1:37:24] feel the mind of the spirit this morning
[1:37:26] and see what he has for us there's a
[1:37:28] thought that kind of laid on my heart
[1:37:29] and i thought boy
[1:37:31] basically i thought yeah sure that's the
[1:37:33] way you want me to go
[1:37:34] you know and i'm like okay well i've
[1:37:36] spoken on this before but
[1:37:38] i just can't seem to get it out of my
[1:37:39] mind so i'll take it as from the lord
[1:37:41] that's what he wants us to speak on this
[1:37:43] morning would that be okay
[1:37:46] so god richly richly
[1:37:48] bless you
[1:37:50] amen
[1:37:54] stand with me now
[1:37:56] we'll go before the lord in prayer
[1:37:58] before we open the word
[1:37:59] kind heavenly father we do thank you
[1:38:01] lord jesus for this great opportunity
[1:38:04] lord to be able to assemble ourselves
[1:38:05] together again without having a
[1:38:07] government or somebody telling us you
[1:38:09] can't do that
[1:38:10] lord and just to have the freedom to
[1:38:12] come
[1:38:13] and to worship you and to give you
[1:38:15] thanks
[1:38:16] and praise for all that you do for us
[1:38:19] lord every day and what you mean to us
[1:38:22] lord
[1:38:23] father we ask god that as we open the
[1:38:25] word
[1:38:26] lord jesus that you will just speak from
[1:38:29] that word to each heart directly
[1:38:32] that we might go here closer to you than
[1:38:35] when we came in lord no matter how close
[1:38:37] we are we'll be just a little closer yet
[1:38:40] father forgive us of all of our
[1:38:41] transgressions
[1:38:43] all of our sins on all of our failures
[1:38:45] lord and help us to be better christians
[1:38:47] to serve you
[1:38:48] bless the reading of the word the
[1:38:50] meditation of our heart
[1:38:52] lord in that which we feel you've laid
[1:38:54] upon our heart to minister we ask your
[1:38:55] blessing in jesus name
[1:38:58] amen
[1:39:00] turn your bibles if you will and we'll
[1:39:02] go to the book of revelations we'll go
[1:39:04] right to the scripture
[1:39:06] that just come to my mind and stayed on
[1:39:08] my mind and wouldn't leave my mind and
[1:39:10] so we're just going
[1:39:11] see what the lord will have for us amen
[1:39:13] how many in the word of god is always
[1:39:15] good
[1:39:16] every portion of the word of god is
[1:39:18] always good
[1:39:20] no matter how many times you eat it
[1:39:24] amen
[1:39:25] it's good over and over
[1:39:27] and over
[1:39:29] and over and over and over
[1:39:32] when we've been there 10 000 years it'll
[1:39:34] still be good
[1:39:36] amen and i just want to say
[1:39:39] that this morning's message and of
[1:39:41] course we are trying to
[1:39:43] have and set our minds to an eternal
[1:39:47] mindset and that right
[1:39:50] i say that because
[1:39:52] the way that you are here when you leave
[1:39:54] if you was to drop dead before the end
[1:39:56] of the service
[1:39:58] that's how you would be
[1:40:00] that right
[1:40:01] and so however we leave here that's how
[1:40:04] we're going to be amen so it's important
[1:40:06] that our hearts are the way they're
[1:40:08] supposed to be
[1:40:09] that our minds are the way that they're
[1:40:12] supposed to be
[1:40:13] our mindset and the way that we think
[1:40:16] and the one portion of that mindset that
[1:40:18] i want to focus on a little bit this
[1:40:20] morning is thankfulness amen
[1:40:24] that we appreciate
[1:40:25] what god is and who he is
[1:40:28] this morning we want to look at once
[1:40:30] again like the old song says let's talk
[1:40:32] about jesus
[1:40:34] more and more and more that's what we're
[1:40:36] going to do again
[1:40:37] and i thought about going to making a
[1:40:39] whole series out of it i don't know if
[1:40:40] i'll speak maybe a little bit more yet
[1:40:42] but i just want to stay with just a
[1:40:44] fraction or just a portion of what we
[1:40:46] could get into
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:49] and what it is is in revelations now
[1:40:53] revelations um
[1:40:55] one
[1:40:56] will begin with
[1:40:58] and i'll show you what that first
[1:41:00] portion or that portion or the first
[1:41:02] portion will be
[1:41:03] amen that we feel to speak on this
[1:41:05] morning pray for brother danny for
[1:41:07] wednesday night we've asked him to speak
[1:41:09] wednesday night will y'all pray for him
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:13] okay revelations 1 and verse
[1:41:17] 7
[1:41:18] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[1:41:22] eye shall see him and they also which
[1:41:25] pierced him
[1:41:26] and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
[1:41:29] because of him
[1:41:31] even so
[1:41:33] amen
[1:41:34] i am alpha and omega the beginning in
[1:41:37] the ending saith the lord which is and
[1:41:39] which was and which is to come
[1:41:42] the almighty
[1:41:44] i john who also am your brother and
[1:41:46] companion in tribulation
[1:41:49] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[1:41:51] christ was on the isle that is called
[1:41:54] patmos for the word of god and for the
[1:41:56] testimony of jesus christ
[1:41:58] i was on this in the spirit on the
[1:42:00] lord's day and heard behind me a great
[1:42:02] voice
[1:42:03] as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and
[1:42:06] omega the first and the last
[1:42:10] down to verse 17
[1:42:13] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[1:42:16] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:42:19] saying
[1:42:20] unto me fear not i am the first and the
[1:42:24] last i am he that liveth and was dead
[1:42:26] and behold i am alive forevermore
[1:42:30] amen doesn't that go along with the song
[1:42:32] we sing there tarzan he's alive and well
[1:42:35] amen he's very much alive how many
[1:42:38] believes he's alive
[1:42:40] forevermore amen and have the keys of
[1:42:43] hell and of death may god had his
[1:42:46] blessings to reading in the word you can
[1:42:48] be seated this morning
[1:42:50] amen
[1:42:52] praise the lord
[1:42:55] amen so this morning i want to talk
[1:42:57] about
[1:42:58] and title this amen
[1:43:00] uh
[1:43:01] i want to title this our abc's our abc's
[1:43:07] amen
[1:43:10] i
[1:43:11] we're thinking that
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:14] alpha
[1:43:15] was in the hebrew
[1:43:17] uh the first letter of the alphabet and
[1:43:20] omega being the last but siri tells me
[1:43:22] that it's the greek in the greek
[1:43:24] language it's the first letter of the
[1:43:26] alphabet and the last
[1:43:29] amen so if that's correct that's what
[1:43:30] we'll go by amen
[1:43:32] but
[1:43:33] anyway so he is the alpha
[1:43:36] he's the omega amen
[1:43:39] and do you notice how
[1:43:41] this book of revelations means more to
[1:43:44] us
[1:43:44] i believe than in any other generation
[1:43:49] i mean the best a lot of our uh
[1:43:52] philosophers and scholars and and phd
[1:43:56] doctors of divinity a lot of them the
[1:43:58] best that they could come up with or
[1:44:00] some of the things they have said was
[1:44:01] that perhaps paul i mean john just ate
[1:44:05] the wrong thing or whatever and he had a
[1:44:07] nightmare
[1:44:08] now that's a terrible thing for anybody
[1:44:10] claiming christianity to say about the
[1:44:13] bible right because it's at all times
[1:44:15] it's a whole lot more than that
[1:44:18] that is an insult but anyway they didn't
[1:44:20] know people didn't know what it meant
[1:44:22] people didn't know what it can the
[1:44:24] symbols a lot of the symbols and
[1:44:26] everything meant but in this hour to me
[1:44:28] as i just began to think about that i
[1:44:30] begin to thinking about easter beginning
[1:44:33] notice he says he's the first letter of
[1:44:35] the alphabet and he's the last alpha of
[1:44:37] letter of the alphabet
[1:44:42] so what does that mean that means that
[1:44:45] you you've realized where the alphabet
[1:44:47] comes from
[1:44:48] right how does god come up with the
[1:44:50] alphabet
[1:44:52] how many knows god is the one that came
[1:44:54] up with numerology all of your numbers
[1:44:57] all knowledge belongs to him
[1:45:00] every bit of it
[1:45:02] and here it's different that he would
[1:45:04] say that i am the eighth and i am the z
[1:45:10] i am the beginning and i am the ending
[1:45:13] now you know that's the beginning of the
[1:45:15] alphabet the ending of the alphabet but
[1:45:17] also meaning that he is the beginning
[1:45:20] of the creation of god
[1:45:23] how many knows he was in the beginning
[1:45:25] of all things the bible says that
[1:45:27] without him was nothing made that was me
[1:45:32] oh my
[1:45:34] once again
[1:45:35] i just love to do it and that is to
[1:45:37] glorify god for who he is
[1:45:40] because we find out in this world that
[1:45:42] it's we're not as important as what we
[1:45:44] think
[1:45:46] and that right we find out that really
[1:45:48] he is the one that's important
[1:45:50] not us so much
[1:45:52] and we should be doing more about
[1:45:54] magnifying and glorifying him
[1:45:57] then we are worried about ourselves so
[1:45:59] much
[1:46:00] we'd actually be happier people if our
[1:46:03] mind was more on him
[1:46:06] and less on ourselves
[1:46:08] we should get amen from that
[1:46:11] because let's admit it we're all honest
[1:46:13] where's a whole lot of thought that goes
[1:46:15] into this guy
[1:46:17] a whole lot of thought goes on to taking
[1:46:19] care of this guy rather than thinking
[1:46:21] about god the way that we should
[1:46:24] praise be to god there's a whole lot to
[1:46:26] be said about god being first
[1:46:31] i am the first
[1:46:33] how many know that god wants to be
[1:46:36] first
[1:46:38] he is first
[1:46:41] i got to thinking about what we use the
[1:46:43] phrase alpha for a lot of times those of
[1:46:46] us who have a farm we know there's a
[1:46:48] alpha cow there's an alpha horse there's
[1:46:51] an alpha
[1:46:52] dog
[1:46:54] we call them alphas right they're first
[1:46:57] they're the head they're the boss
[1:47:02] praise the lord how many knows god i
[1:47:05] want you to know i don't care if you're
[1:47:08] putin i don't care if you're a king i
[1:47:10] don't care what you are
[1:47:12] god is alpha he's above all
[1:47:16] bible says he's above all and through
[1:47:18] all and in you
[1:47:20] all i love that song oh lord you're my
[1:47:24] all in all
[1:47:30] he is
[1:47:31] my everything
[1:47:34] how many know that we we need to work on
[1:47:36] some of this
[1:47:37] when i got to thinking about being first
[1:47:39] i know that there's a lot of us
[1:47:41] including myself that have come a long
[1:47:43] way because of the preaching of the word
[1:47:45] that we have heard how that we are to
[1:47:47] put god first
[1:47:52] but i also thought you know i believe we
[1:47:53] still have some searching to do
[1:47:56] every one of us still has some searching
[1:47:58] to do
[1:48:00] amen because there's still areas perhaps
[1:48:02] in our lives where he's still not first
[1:48:04] like he ought to be
[1:48:07] how much you know he was first he did
[1:48:09] something
[1:48:11] how did the first thing that he tells
[1:48:14] john
[1:48:16] you know in this book of revelation
[1:48:18] i am he
[1:48:20] which was dead
[1:48:22] let me go back a little bit
[1:48:24] notice i fell at his feet as dead
[1:48:29] john when he seen his vision he fell at
[1:48:31] his feet like he was dead and he put his
[1:48:33] right hand and he said don't fear
[1:48:37] i am the first
[1:48:39] and i'm the last i believe that means
[1:48:42] more to this church to to believers than
[1:48:45] any other time
[1:48:47] knowing that he is first
[1:48:50] and he's the last
[1:48:52] he was there he began everything
[1:48:56] oh my
[1:48:59] and he says to john i'm the first and
[1:49:01] the last he
[1:49:03] he's supposed to get comfort from this
[1:49:08] i am he that liveth i was dead but
[1:49:10] behold now i am alive forevermore amen
[1:49:13] and have the keys of hell and of death
[1:49:16] i thought about going through the whole
[1:49:18] alphabet
[1:49:19] like i said i don't i'm not going to
[1:49:20] this morning i could never do it but i'm
[1:49:22] just going to go with a b and c would
[1:49:24] that be okay
[1:49:26] let's just go with a b and c
[1:49:30] amen he is alpha
[1:49:32] the beginning
[1:49:33] he's the start
[1:49:40] see
[1:49:41] in the beginning
[1:49:42] was the word
[1:49:44] and the word
[1:49:46] was with god and the word
[1:49:48] was god
[1:49:49] how many knows he is
[1:49:51] the bee
[1:49:53] he is the beginning
[1:49:56] he is the beginning
[1:49:59] he
[1:49:59] he is the end
[1:50:02] he's every letter
[1:50:05] in the alphabet
[1:50:08] praise be to god
[1:50:10] oh when he becomes every fiber of your
[1:50:12] body
[1:50:14] how many knows about the man says he
[1:50:15] goes just the size of a thumbnail he
[1:50:17] starts with
[1:50:20] or a fingernail or something like that
[1:50:22] right
[1:50:23] am i close
[1:50:24] and then he got in there and then he
[1:50:26] spreads out
[1:50:28] we believe god wanted to spread out
[1:50:31] he wanted to spread out in every area of
[1:50:34] our life
[1:50:39] every area of our life
[1:50:42] every part of our being
[1:50:45] every fiber that we have every part of
[1:50:47] our mind he wants to go plumb into your
[1:50:49] spirit realm he wants to go plumb into
[1:50:52] your soul realm
[1:50:54] amen
[1:50:57] the same as with the beginning with god
[1:51:00] all things were made by him and without
[1:51:02] him was not anything made that was made
[1:51:07] we've heard the phrase don't start
[1:51:10] nothing and there won't be nothing
[1:51:15] huh
[1:51:16] well guess what if god wouldn't have
[1:51:18] started nothing it would have been
[1:51:20] nothing
[1:51:26] amen
[1:51:28] that means the creation everything it
[1:51:31] doesn't matter what it is
[1:51:34] everything
[1:51:36] he made everything without him there was
[1:51:38] not anything made that was made
[1:51:41] the bible says one place i create evil
[1:51:45] dog god talking i create evil
[1:51:51] oh i know some people religious we might
[1:51:54] kind of blow our mind god's saying i
[1:51:56] create that don't make i i ain't here to
[1:51:59] question god not now not ever
[1:52:06] it'd be like me building something in my
[1:52:08] shop i'm building something and it looks
[1:52:10] funky to you
[1:52:13] what the world have you made brother
[1:52:15] writer
[1:52:17] that looks stupid dumb and ignorant
[1:52:20] well guess what i don't care what you
[1:52:21] think some stupid and ignorant i'm gonna
[1:52:23] make what i would make
[1:52:29] and god says in hebrew romans that he
[1:52:31] says who are we to ask why has thou made
[1:52:33] me thus
[1:52:35] he's a master he made everything he can
[1:52:37] make whatever he wants to make
[1:52:39] he can do whatever he wants to do
[1:52:43] he's god
[1:52:45] how many bad he's got
[1:52:47] [Applause]
[1:52:49] glad he doesn't have us for his leader
[1:52:52] huh
[1:52:54] no we're just to create it
[1:52:57] we can't even we don't we're not even
[1:52:59] supposed to figure it all out
[1:53:02] praise the lord
[1:53:05] you love him
[1:53:06] it was nothing made but what he made
[1:53:09] amen
[1:53:11] and just think about this i like this
[1:53:12] because he said i am the beginning
[1:53:16] you and i perhaps don't know what it was
[1:53:18] like
[1:53:20] to watch enoch and uh and the different
[1:53:22] ones this lineage of cane to go out and
[1:53:25] uh and build cities and do musical
[1:53:28] instruments and they were makers of
[1:53:30] musical instruments weren't they
[1:53:34] we weren't there at the beginning is
[1:53:35] what i'm trying to say but we are here
[1:53:37] at the end i many knows every spirit
[1:53:40] every organization every denomination
[1:53:43] every homosexual every every evil thing
[1:53:46] everything started
[1:53:48] in genesis
[1:53:50] it was at the beginning right now it's
[1:53:52] the beginning book everything was in
[1:53:54] there
[1:53:55] where you and i didn't live in that but
[1:53:57] we're living not in the beginning of it
[1:54:00] or in the seed of it but we're living in
[1:54:02] the manifestation and in the full
[1:54:05] ripening of it all
[1:54:07] the full manifestation
[1:54:10] that's why you're seeing what you're
[1:54:11] seeing out there
[1:54:13] going so evil because it's coming to its
[1:54:16] full manifestation
[1:54:19] amen how many beliefs the bride will
[1:54:21] come to full of them full manifestations
[1:54:22] one of these days
[1:54:28] i was driving down the road yesterday
[1:54:30] now thinking about the lord and i was
[1:54:32] looking at my desires and the way that
[1:54:34] my desires run and and what i think
[1:54:37] about what i what my passion is and i
[1:54:39] look at my mistakes and i said oh i sure
[1:54:41] don't like that i hate every mistake
[1:54:43] i've ever made
[1:54:46] huh
[1:54:47] but i don't focus on that but i look at
[1:54:49] my desire and i look at what little
[1:54:51] things anymore maybe it's my age but i
[1:54:53] believe it's the holy ghost as you get
[1:54:55] older and then you begin to little
[1:54:57] things bother you a little bit more than
[1:54:58] what they used to
[1:55:03] oh yeah if you get a little older if
[1:55:05] people get the shakes they get them to
[1:55:06] be a nervous wreck sometime
[1:55:09] you know you have to be careful
[1:55:12] your mind i low
[1:55:15] you got to keep it in check not let
[1:55:18] things bother you so much take it to the
[1:55:20] lord in prayer but i was there and i was
[1:55:22] checking my things and so forth and i
[1:55:24] got the look and i got driving down the
[1:55:26] road look at the skies with god made
[1:55:28] that says you know i believe that i've
[1:55:30] got a theophany body waiting for me
[1:55:36] i believe there's another body waiting
[1:55:38] for me
[1:55:41] oh my my that gets you excited but it
[1:55:43] does me
[1:55:45] because if you ain't got no body to go
[1:55:46] into if you ain't got no theology body
[1:55:48] waiting for you
[1:55:50] when you get over to the other side
[1:55:51] first of all your desires are going to
[1:55:53] be downward
[1:55:55] huh if you've got a perfect body you'd
[1:55:58] thirst for perfection
[1:56:01] you have a desire for perfection for
[1:56:03] close to walk with god
[1:56:05] to be just yet that body is calling i've
[1:56:07] got to think that theophany is calling
[1:56:10] me
[1:56:12] i hope you have a theophany this morning
[1:56:14] that
[1:56:15] is calling you
[1:56:19] amen
[1:56:21] i got to worry about getting old i ain't
[1:56:23] got to worry about wrinkles i gotta
[1:56:24] worry about gray hair i got one over
[1:56:26] there they got no gray hair ain't got no
[1:56:28] wrinkles ain't got no feebleness
[1:56:31] hello
[1:56:32] if you're excited about that i don't
[1:56:34] know what i'm gonna do with you
[1:56:38] i think you've got that waiting over
[1:56:40] there
[1:56:42] oh my
[1:56:45] see
[1:56:46] what is that
[1:56:48] that is my end
[1:56:51] that is my end game my end
[1:56:55] goal
[1:56:56] and that right is to be in your
[1:56:58] theophany your new body
[1:57:02] no matter what you go through in life
[1:57:05] what's important is your beginning and
[1:57:07] what's important is your end
[1:57:11] god's telling him just as i was there at
[1:57:14] the beginning
[1:57:15] i'm going to be there at the end i am
[1:57:18] then i was the beginning and i am the
[1:57:20] end
[1:57:21] what joy that it gives me the mo this
[1:57:23] morning is to think that he is never
[1:57:26] going to leave you he'll never forsake
[1:57:28] you he's not going to finish not finish
[1:57:30] his job
[1:57:34] he's going to be there
[1:57:36] i am the beginning and i am the ending
[1:57:39] how many knows how many times the
[1:57:40] prophet of god told us you are living in
[1:57:43] the end time
[1:57:45] we're living in the end the end
[1:57:51] we're living in the end time not the
[1:57:52] beginning but in the end time
[1:57:55] that's what jesus says i am the end i'm
[1:57:58] the beginning and the end
[1:58:07] when you look at all that god is
[1:58:10] huh
[1:58:11] and all that god does for you
[1:58:14] huh
[1:58:15] how good he is to you
[1:58:17] i mean it's all about him it's how good
[1:58:20] god is to you
[1:58:23] across the whole spectrum in the
[1:58:25] spiritual world of redemption
[1:58:26] forgiveness of your sins
[1:58:28] huh
[1:58:30] the joy that he gives you the peace that
[1:58:32] he gives you
[1:58:34] the grace that he gives you all that he
[1:58:36] gives you
[1:58:40] the way that he blesses you if you've
[1:58:42] been blessed because i'm here to tell
[1:58:44] you that majority of people are over
[1:58:47] blessed
[1:58:48] and under thankful
[1:58:54] huh
[1:58:55] overly blessed under thankful
[1:59:00] and when you become unthankful you are
[1:59:02] not grateful if you don't praise god
[1:59:05] for what he is
[1:59:07] huh
[1:59:08] and for the blessings that he bestows
[1:59:11] you lose those blessings
[1:59:17] you lose those blessings and that's
[1:59:18] exactly what america has done they have
[1:59:22] forgotten their blessings
[1:59:24] they forgot how god brought them here
[1:59:27] they forgot plymouth rock
[1:59:30] they forgot what we wrote on our whole
[1:59:32] on our on our pills and god we trust one
[1:59:36] nation under god they forgot all that
[1:59:39] you want an example of people who forget
[1:59:42] who god is
[1:59:44] look at america
[1:59:46] brother brennan he talked about the
[1:59:47] greatest
[1:59:49] the nation outside of israel
[1:59:52] one of the greatest states i don't
[1:59:54] believe rome i don't believe any of them
[1:59:56] had anything on us
[1:59:59] greatest nations in the world
[2:00:02] founded upon christianity founded upon
[2:00:04] god belief in god and faith in god
[2:00:08] and then
[2:00:09] became unthankful for what they had
[2:00:14] you want to see a dry church you want to
[2:00:16] see a dead person that claims to be a
[2:00:19] christian let them become unthankful for
[2:00:21] what they have
[2:00:24] let them not glorify god the way that
[2:00:27] they should
[2:00:28] because that's what we're here to do
[2:00:30] that's what we come is to worship him as
[2:00:32] the puppet of god put it
[2:00:36] to make love with christ
[2:00:38] we come here to raise our hands and love
[2:00:40] him in the morning love him at noon love
[2:00:43] him and even
[2:00:44] love him all the time
[2:00:47] people don't love god the way they
[2:00:49] should they don't keep him first the way
[2:00:50] that he should
[2:00:54] and our mind said my mind said oh god
[2:00:56] don't never let me get this so don't let
[2:00:58] ever let this become common to me
[2:01:05] because if it does hear
[2:01:08] do you reckon it just might over there
[2:01:10] too
[2:01:16] one of these days you're just going to
[2:01:17] be so backslid and you're not going to
[2:01:19] appreciate god and you're going to be so
[2:01:21] gripey about
[2:01:23] this and the gripe be about that and
[2:01:25] then god's going to come and take you in
[2:01:26] the rapture
[2:01:31] i don't think it's going to happen that
[2:01:32] way do you
[2:01:34] no
[2:01:35] no i don't think so
[2:01:37] i think we're going to be at the height
[2:01:38] of worship
[2:01:41] i think we're going to be screaming a
[2:01:42] little on this side because of our
[2:01:44] goodies
[2:01:47] oh let me give you some advice if you're
[2:01:50] depressed if you ain't got no smile on
[2:01:52] your face you need more god
[2:01:56] you need to count your blessing you need
[2:01:58] to see you need to look at the alpha and
[2:02:00] omega you need to look at the one that's
[2:02:02] everything
[2:02:05] let it become your everything
[2:02:08] you won't be stagnated you won't be
[2:02:10] backslid you won't be all of that you'll
[2:02:12] realize you're not the important one
[2:02:14] here he's the important one
[2:02:18] you'll begin to give him praise and
[2:02:20] honor and glory your life will change
[2:02:25] i don't care if all you got is five one
[2:02:28] pennies
[2:02:29] all i got brother bothers five cents
[2:02:36] you start jumping up and down saying
[2:02:38] well praise be to god he gave me five
[2:02:40] cents
[2:02:47] because god loves to give to those who
[2:02:48] are appreciative of it
[2:02:51] but not those that complain about what
[2:02:52] they do have
[2:02:56] amen again i want to just recap look at
[2:02:59] america
[2:03:00] if you want to see what it looks like
[2:03:02] when somebody doesn't appreciate what
[2:03:03] they had
[2:03:06] it isn't long they don't even want what
[2:03:08] they have anymore
[2:03:12] and we human beings are so stupid
[2:03:16] that it isn't until we really get what
[2:03:19] we want it
[2:03:20] we thought we would get what we want we
[2:03:22] find out that's not at all what we want
[2:03:24] we're the epitome of misery
[2:03:27] and then we say oh i wish i would still
[2:03:29] have that
[2:03:31] it is until we get there that we get
[2:03:33] smart
[2:03:35] a lot of people folks are you with me
[2:03:37] there's a lot of people out there
[2:03:40] you want socialism you want all kind you
[2:03:42] want all of that when you get it you
[2:03:43] will wish you had the other
[2:03:47] i ain't gonna be that way
[2:03:49] i appreciate my freedom
[2:03:52] i really don't like when the government
[2:03:54] says you can't have church
[2:03:56] because of this that or the other i
[2:03:57] don't care if i want to die let me go
[2:03:59] die
[2:04:01] don't start telling me what i can and
[2:04:02] can't do
[2:04:04] huh
[2:04:05] be very careful there
[2:04:07] isn't that right
[2:04:09] because we know it's the devil isn't it
[2:04:11] something like you know just taking our
[2:04:13] masks off people out of it no no no
[2:04:15] don't let them take an ass off
[2:04:17] what is the big deal let's take the mask
[2:04:20] off
[2:04:22] no it's just the devil in that that's a
[2:04:24] you know brother bam talked about how
[2:04:26] there was nothing but the devil and
[2:04:28] martin luther in that movement
[2:04:30] that's what all this is not but the
[2:04:31] devil in that
[2:04:33] trying to tell you what you can and
[2:04:34] can't do
[2:04:36] yeah
[2:04:38] that's right
[2:04:40] you know what i love the freedom to be
[2:04:42] able to speak this
[2:04:45] out on the internet say what i want to
[2:04:46] say
[2:04:47] you want to say something different go
[2:04:50] ahead least we can say what we want to
[2:04:53] say
[2:04:56] and don't get me political here but i'm
[2:04:58] just going to say something anyway
[2:05:00] aren't they coming up with some kind of
[2:05:01] a dis disinformation mode now
[2:05:05] that if you if i understand maybe i'm
[2:05:06] wrong here but if you give out this
[2:05:08] information they want to shut you down
[2:05:10] now if you lie about something they're
[2:05:12] going to shut you down well the ones
[2:05:13] that are putting the board up need to be
[2:05:15] shut down
[2:05:18] they're the big biggest disinformation
[2:05:20] you know i'm 60 years old i'm not just
[2:05:22] too dumb anymore i know when somebody's
[2:05:24] lying to me
[2:05:26] and who's giving out the disinformation
[2:05:28] what if you want to
[2:05:29] investigate something you'll have to do
[2:05:31] your own self that's right
[2:05:34] it's a joke
[2:05:36] isn't that right
[2:05:38] but
[2:05:39] as always it's just those wheels right
[2:05:43] everything's got to come together
[2:05:46] that's right
[2:05:49] lose everything they want to take
[2:05:50] everything and probably will
[2:05:53] amen
[2:05:54] until even the foolish virgins if she
[2:05:56] doesn't come subject to this
[2:05:58] this thing that public god called word
[2:06:01] uh world council churches and all of all
[2:06:03] of that

[2:06:06] shot
[2:06:06] you'll have to go into caves and
[2:06:08] everything else you better find a big
[2:06:09] old hole to store a bunch of food up on
[2:06:12] because they're gonna come after you

[2:07:59] abc's
[2:08:05] how many there's two sets of abc's
[2:08:09] he says brother bam says listen let me
[2:08:11] say this again let me read you another
[2:08:13] quote so in america america let me tell
[2:08:15] you about the other abc's one of ism is
[2:08:18] always believe christ
[2:08:20] in america in the signs and wonders of
[2:08:23] god they take place
[2:08:25] he says what if
[2:08:27] what happened last night would have
[2:08:28] taken place talking about discernment
[2:08:30] your name is so-and-so you have such a
[2:08:33] such a problem this that or the other
[2:08:34] all the discernment that went going
[2:08:36] forth he says
[2:08:38] he says that last night he says in
[2:08:39] bombay if it happened in bombay
[2:08:42] india there would be a hundred thousand
[2:08:44] souls one to jesus christ
[2:08:47] but people walk in our meetings and they
[2:08:49] walk back out and say well what do you
[2:08:51] think about that just a polish suit
[2:08:53] there or
[2:08:54] some
[2:08:55] mental telepathy
[2:08:57] he says and that's the educated one
[2:09:00] place he says education
[2:09:02] has been the greatest curse that
[2:09:04] christianity has ever had
[2:09:11] education
[2:09:13] knowledge
[2:09:14] to know something
[2:09:16] listen
[2:09:17] you educate the people till they know
[2:09:19] more about god than god knows about it
[2:09:22] when i was reading this i thought about
[2:09:24] how that in our bible schools the story
[2:09:26] of the the lady that was healed and her
[2:09:28] boy come back and said you know in our
[2:09:30] bibles uh college they teach us that
[2:09:33] mark 16 from a certain scripture on it's
[2:09:35] not even inspired and i had to think
[2:09:38] what now this is the words that come to
[2:09:40] my mind what demon or d a dean
[2:09:43] demon or the you know the dean i guess
[2:09:46] the head of them all
[2:09:48] come up
[2:09:49] that they felt they had the authority to
[2:09:51] teach everybody now that's that's
[2:09:53] inspired from there on
[2:09:55] well when i read my bible brother john
[2:09:57] it doesn't say it's not inspired from
[2:09:59] here on somebody else had to put that in
[2:10:01] maybe they should put that into all the
[2:10:03] bibles from this verse that they said
[2:10:04] now the rest of this chapter is not
[2:10:06] inspired
[2:10:09] do you erect they get some kickback on
[2:10:11] that right
[2:10:12] well they should get some kick going
[2:10:13] back on it remember that one that was
[2:10:15] talking to a uh muhammad and he says all
[2:10:17] of the quran is inspired
[2:10:21] i mean please all the bible is inspired
[2:10:23] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[2:10:25] word shall never pass away they're as
[2:10:27] eternal as eternal can be
[2:10:30] but that's where education gets you a
[2:10:32] lot of times people get to be so smart
[2:10:35] and as soon as they get smart
[2:10:37] hello
[2:10:39] folks i don't mind you having an
[2:10:41] education but just don't brag to me
[2:10:42] about how you got an education and
[2:10:45] so many years of college and try to make
[2:10:47] me feel inferior because it's not going
[2:10:49] to work
[2:10:51] especially with the quote right
[2:10:54] get finished with telling me how about
[2:10:56] all your phd and i'll tell you well you
[2:10:57] know what the prophet god said that just
[2:10:59] means you're that further away from god
[2:11:04] i wouldn't do that unless i really felt
[2:11:06] led to
[2:11:08] but listen
[2:11:09] what's
[2:11:11] important listen here's what's important
[2:11:13] are you ready
[2:11:14] i've got two girls here and i'd rather
[2:11:16] those girls never even know their abcs
[2:11:20] and yet know jesus christ then have all
[2:11:23] the education the world could pile on
[2:11:25] them and not know jesus christ
[2:11:28] i'd rather they know christ
[2:11:32] how many that's what we need we need
[2:11:34] people
[2:11:35] not just to know the bible or the word
[2:11:38] but know the author
[2:11:41] how many believes he is the author
[2:11:44] [Music]
[2:11:46] and the finisher hebrews 12 says uh you
[2:11:50] know that he is the author and the
[2:11:52] finisher of our faith
[2:11:55] praise be to god
[2:11:57] i'm glad that he started working me
[2:12:01] it's easy is he the author
[2:12:04] of your experience
[2:12:07] it's more important
[2:12:09] that we know christ
[2:12:11] the bible says to know him is to know
[2:12:13] life
[2:12:14] if you have him you have life
[2:12:17] not if you have education or knowledge
[2:12:19] or mental no but to have him is life
[2:12:22] if you don't have him you don't have god
[2:12:25] you don't have life
[2:12:27] in him was life and the life was the
[2:12:29] light of men
[2:12:33] let's be their god he'd rather his
[2:12:35] children
[2:12:36] now we know we've got to have an
[2:12:37] education so forth he never knocked that
[2:12:38] but don't never let that get in the way
[2:12:41] of believing christ always believe
[2:12:44] christ
[2:12:47] always
[2:12:49] in every situation in every age
[2:12:54] amen
[2:12:55] how many knows the scribes the pharisees
[2:12:57] they were educated
[2:12:58] paul was educated he was a pharisee of
[2:13:01] the pharisees he sat under camellia
[2:13:04] and he thought he had it right and he
[2:13:06] couldn't have had it more wrong
[2:13:09] amen
[2:13:12] let me tell you something the reason the
[2:13:15] world is in the condition it is but it
[2:13:17] it's because they don't know their abcs
[2:13:22] sure they know the other abcs they know
[2:13:24] the abcs of education but they don't
[2:13:26] know
[2:13:27] abc is to always believe christ
[2:13:32] how about our churches in this time
[2:13:34] god could come do signs and wonders
[2:13:38] but they had a phd brother branham had
[2:13:40] hints and tapes and fetches and fetches
[2:13:42] and everything else and couldn't talk
[2:13:44] and
[2:13:46] amen or something like that they thought
[2:13:48] he saw it oh man
[2:13:50] like some cow bellowing is it
[2:13:53] oh
[2:13:55] man
[2:14:01] it's not about showmanship
[2:14:05] he says why don't you get an education
[2:14:07] some of them smart guys said to a
[2:14:08] prophet to god
[2:14:10] i never knew until here that uh he was
[2:14:12] preaching the lamb and the dove remember
[2:14:14] his message on the laminate dove he says
[2:14:15] the service before that somebody come up
[2:14:17] to him and he says you know what a
[2:14:19] legalistic message got all over him
[2:14:22] huh
[2:14:23] i didn't know brother ben faced those
[2:14:24] type of things in his hour but people
[2:14:26] had the audacity to think they were so
[2:14:28] much better than the prophet
[2:14:30] come up and say do you such a legalistic
[2:14:32] message you know and and so forth and
[2:14:34] balling the women out why don't you
[2:14:36] teach him how to receive gifts and so
[2:14:37] forth and that's when he says you know
[2:14:39] how can i teach them algebra if they
[2:14:41] won't even learn to clean up their life
[2:14:44] it don't do no much good if you're up
[2:14:45] here with makeup and short hair like
[2:14:47] paul preached against and wearing pants
[2:14:48] and everything else speaking in tongues
[2:14:50] they go nobody believe your testimony
[2:14:52] clean your life up first learn how to
[2:14:54] dress first
[2:14:56] learn how to walk right first then we'll
[2:14:59] teach you some algebra
[2:15:01] amen
[2:15:04] praise the lord
[2:15:07] so the next time listen to this
[2:15:09] legalistic message
[2:15:11] oh more he just tore me up he said the
[2:15:13] next day i preached the laminate of the
[2:15:15] real lord really blessed that little
[2:15:17] message and broke up message and people
[2:15:19] were and he came out wiping his eyes he
[2:15:21] says that sure was a good message
[2:15:23] but so simple
[2:15:27] can you believe that
[2:15:29] first you compliment him and then you
[2:15:31] smack him in the face
[2:15:33] that's really how to treat a guy in it
[2:15:36] yeah but so simple it was all right but
[2:15:39] so simple and he could preach in seven
[2:15:41] languages you know
[2:15:43] so my con
[2:15:45] kentucky talk was so simple to him and
[2:15:48] our best manners wouldn't touch him
[2:15:50] nowhere
[2:15:51] that's right and so that's about the way
[2:15:53] that i have to talk simple i believe the
[2:15:55] gospel is simple
[2:15:56] the bible is simple
[2:15:58] the bible says that it is so simple that
[2:16:00] a fool should not err therein
[2:16:05] i mean those god deals in simplicity
[2:16:08] the common people heard him gladly it
[2:16:12] was the educated the pharisees the smart
[2:16:14] that didn't edu that didn't receive it
[2:16:17] amen
[2:16:19] because paul said first chapter of
[2:16:21] corinthians says because the foolishness
[2:16:22] of god is wiser than men and the
[2:16:25] weakness of god is stronger than men god
[2:16:28] takes the weak things of the world to
[2:16:29] confound
[2:16:31] smart and the educated norm of that
[2:16:36] i believe just comes to my mind but the
[2:16:38] band says the more simple you can be the
[2:16:41] more god can use you
[2:16:44] and i don't mean dumb that means simple
[2:16:46] in god just stay right before him and
[2:16:49] say just whatever you say lord
[2:16:51] don't let me begin to have a thought
[2:16:53] that's contrary to you or let me stay
[2:16:55] simple with christ
[2:16:58] i don't have to be smart
[2:16:59] for you see your calling brethren how
[2:17:01] that many not many wise men after the
[2:17:03] flesh not many mighty not many a noble
[2:17:06] are called but god has chosen the
[2:17:08] foolish things of this world to confound
[2:17:10] wise
[2:17:11] that's right and that's exactly what was
[2:17:13] happening here
[2:17:16] i can't tell you
[2:17:18] the prophet of god was just a simple
[2:17:20] fellow he was just a simple kentucky
[2:17:22] hillbilly with a lot of a lot of cut up
[2:17:25] words
[2:17:26] and somehow god chose the last prophet
[2:17:28] that sent to the gentiles to have him
[2:17:30] come right out of kentucky and speak
[2:17:31] like that and then that man would come
[2:17:33] up and he would simply say you say you
[2:17:35] have a phl lld the more lld's the more
[2:17:37] dd's you have that means that's how much
[2:17:39] further away from god you are
[2:17:43] he put him in their place he wasn't
[2:17:44] afraid
[2:17:45] to put him in their place to tell them
[2:17:47] the truth
[2:17:49] amen
[2:17:52] because remember brother baum says i was
[2:17:53] treated better by which doctors and all
[2:17:56] of those crazy people in africa
[2:17:59] i was treated better by them than i was
[2:18:00] these american preachers
[2:18:03] huh
[2:18:06] oh my he says he has a lot more success
[2:18:08] over there because all we are here we
[2:18:11] claim that we're not heathen he said
[2:18:13] here but he says we're nothing but an
[2:18:15] educated heathen over here
[2:18:18] if you don't believe that go through
[2:18:20] dairy queen drive-thru
[2:18:22] or go to walmart you'll see that we got
[2:18:24] no drinks
[2:18:26] eerie
[2:18:28] things
[2:18:29] see how big we can open that ear up and
[2:18:31] make a bigger hole looks just like them
[2:18:34] hot in parts of the jungles of africa
[2:18:38] we look more like them all the time
[2:18:41] why because a heathen means an
[2:18:44] unbeliever
[2:18:45] how many believes they don't have the
[2:18:46] first part is and that's be believer
[2:18:49] aren't you glad you're a be a
[2:18:56] the anointed one
[2:18:58] a lot of people say they believe in
[2:18:59] christ but how many knows christ means
[2:19:02] anointed
[2:19:04] people's church services aren't anointed
[2:19:07] preachers are not anointed they don't
[2:19:09] believe in that anointing because
[2:19:12] that anointing would straighten things
[2:19:14] out
[2:19:18] the double doors go to flopping in the
[2:19:20] denominations if that preacher ever got
[2:19:22] truly anointed
[2:19:23] to preach the word of god not just some
[2:19:25] false anointing hello
[2:19:28] amen to always and forever just like
[2:19:31] daniel he had his abcs right
[2:19:35] don't matter good times no matter bad
[2:19:38] times don't matter when or what always
[2:19:40] believe christ
[2:19:41] in every situation you're in
[2:19:44] and let's remember this because this
[2:19:46] came to my mind as i was coming to
[2:19:47] church
[2:19:49] that before us every day
[2:19:51] there's always a choice
[2:19:54] the right and the wrong in everything
[2:19:56] you do there's a right and the wrong and
[2:19:59] you have to be prayerful try to make
[2:20:01] sure you make the right choice
[2:20:03] how many believes that
[2:20:05] making the right choice in choosing
[2:20:06] christ and keeping christ always before
[2:20:08] you that's not just a one-time thing
[2:20:10] that's an everyday affair
[2:20:13] everything that comes up before you
[2:20:16] everything that happens you have a right
[2:20:18] choice and you have a wrong choice
[2:20:20] it's always before us
[2:20:21] and if you made the right choice you'll
[2:20:23] be a happy person you make the wrong
[2:20:25] choice you'll have to repent
[2:20:27] and you'll feel
[2:20:28] bad amen
[2:20:32] but most of all when i see this just the
[2:20:34] simplicity of alpha and omega
[2:20:38] that's who he is
[2:20:41] i love it amen it means so i'm thankful
[2:20:44] for it
[2:20:45] and through all of eternity i'll be
[2:20:47] thankful for what that means
[2:20:50] he started it and in the middle of the
[2:20:52] book
[2:20:53] and that right
[2:20:54] he's the beginning of the creation of
[2:20:56] god he's the beginning of your testimony
[2:20:58] in your life he's the beginning of mine
[2:21:01] how many knows he's in my beginning
[2:21:04] it was him that chose me to live he's
[2:21:06] him that chose you to live
[2:21:10] everything that was created
[2:21:12] i mean those voice was created by him
[2:21:15] your lips your tongue it was created by
[2:21:17] him
[2:21:19] your heart was created by him your eyes
[2:21:21] were created i thank god for
[2:21:24] voice
[2:21:25] god for years blessed are they they're
[2:21:27] here right
[2:21:29] bless the day that see
[2:21:31] huh
[2:21:35] think about it there's a lot of folks
[2:21:37] that don't don't have no legs they don't
[2:21:39] have no eyes they're blind perhaps can't
[2:21:41] hear you are sitting eyes vocal cords
[2:21:44] feeling good how many believes you
[2:21:46] should use all of that to praise god
[2:21:49] to glorify god that's what we're here
[2:21:51] for to glorify god use everything that
[2:21:54] he has made without him there's nothing
[2:21:56] made that was made he made you he made
[2:21:59] me he gave us our vocal point he'd give
[2:22:01] your mind he gave you a heart so that he
[2:22:03] could dwell in there
[2:22:10] was it all about him and for him
[2:22:12] revelations 4 11 says it this way thou
[2:22:15] art worthy o lord
[2:22:17] to receive glory
[2:22:20] and honor
[2:22:22] see that's the problem people don't give
[2:22:24] god the honor and the glory that is due
[2:22:27] to him
[2:22:30] that's why they are in the condition
[2:22:31] they are
[2:22:33] christians are even
[2:22:35] huh
[2:22:38] you got to be careful you got to be
[2:22:39] careful
[2:22:41] about things become common to you
[2:22:44] your seat becoming common to you just
[2:22:46] sit there and oh it's just here no don't
[2:22:48] never if you get that way you go home
[2:22:50] this afternoon don't you let me go to
[2:22:51] church again and just feel like well i'm
[2:22:53] just doing what i always do
[2:22:56] huh
[2:22:58] let me tell you something comes to my
[2:23:00] mind is that okay church is about
[2:23:02] participation
[2:23:06] not spectator
[2:23:07] expectation if there's such a word
[2:23:11] we're not here to spectate we're here to
[2:23:12] participate in worshiping the lord
[2:23:16] lord i love you lord i love you lord i
[2:23:19] love you lord i love you
[2:23:21] you're a wonderful god thank you
[2:23:23] that you didn't start something and
[2:23:25] leave us hanging here at the end

[2:23:30] places but you're here with him now
[2:23:33] and i'm glad he's here aren't you glad
[2:23:36] god bless you we're going to bring it to
[2:23:37] close we have communion this morning
[2:23:39] amen
[2:23:40] i'm so grateful for what he did on
[2:23:42] calvary aren't you
[2:23:45] when we've been there 10 000 years
[2:23:50] bright shining as the sun
[2:23:55] out of love maybe god will allow us to
[2:23:58] go back
[2:23:59] and to see
[2:24:02] how it came
[2:24:04] when the sun began to shine
[2:24:07] huh
[2:24:09] and i don't know how many millions of
[2:24:11] years
[2:24:12] that thing's been shining
[2:24:14] but you talk about a torch brother sean
[2:24:17] you talk about a torch
[2:24:19] burning that hot
[2:24:21] and never burning out
[2:24:24] what's that thing made
[2:24:28] now i'm not here to tell for sure but as
[2:24:30] far as i know it's natural
[2:24:33] it's hard to believe anything natural
[2:24:34] could burn that hot for that many years
[2:24:38] huh and i think our summers are just as
[2:24:40] hot and so forth still the same
[2:24:44] amen
[2:24:48] amen i'm going to give my son's
[2:24:50] revelation of it if that's all right
[2:24:52] he thinks what's going to burn this
[2:24:53] world up is that thing going supernova
[2:24:56] elements everything it go
[2:24:58] when it burns out when it goes supernova
[2:25:00] just goes super hot it'll burn
[2:25:02] everything
[2:25:04] amen
[2:25:05] because we know that over there the sun
[2:25:06] won't be no more so it's going to go out
[2:25:07] sometime
[2:25:09] we won't have no need of the light
[2:25:11] for the lamb is the light
[2:25:15] and i got to thinking you know of all
[2:25:17] the time that that sun was up there when
[2:25:19] it's been gone for millions of years
[2:25:21] you'll still be
[2:25:23] brother joshua think about it you'll
[2:25:25] still be in millions of years
[2:25:27] after the sun is long gone

[2:28:34] lord that which also i delivered unto
[2:28:36] you
[2:28:37] that the lord jesus the same night in
[2:28:39] which he was betrayed took bread and
[2:28:41] when he had given thanks he break it
[2:28:43] and said take eat this is my body which
[2:28:45] is broken for you this too in
[2:28:47] remembrance of me
[2:28:49] after the same manner he also took to
[2:28:51] cup and when he had sup
[2:28:54] saying this cup is the new testament in
