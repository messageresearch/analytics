good to sing to the Lord amen praise the Lord God bless each one appreciate our Wednesday night folks amen making the effort to come out Amen to hear the word of the Lord amen we want to continue with our thought a little bit on an Open Door amen talking about the Lord amen and him knocking on our hearts door so let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus come before you father tonight once again grateful Lord Jesus from the bottom of my heart that we can come together like this to lay aside our work and our busyness all the hecticness that we face during the weeks during the week Lord and all the cares of life that we have to deal with and just to lay it aside and to come into your place Lord Jesus Lord to hear your voice speak to our hearts Lord and see what you would have to say to us father we just come because we love you Lord we appreciate all that you have done and all that you do for us every day Lord and we thank you for your leadership and your guidance that you give to us Lord and we thank you for the peace that you've given to our hearts the joy that you've given to us Lord and father most of all father we thank you Lord Jesus for knocking on our heart's door Lord Jesus and father we just pray God that you would just take the thoughts Lord Jesus that father I feel Lord You've led me Lord in a certain direction and certain portion of your word we ask God that you just have the preeminence in every aspect of the service and we've come here Lord so that we might go away Closer to You Lord having gathered Lord Jesus and learned more and committed ourselves more in a greater way to you Lord thank you for all the prayers that you've answered Lord and all the people that's been touched Lord Jesus and those that needed touched brother Austin and we ask God you just raise them up Lord Jesus in special way my wife Lord getting a touch of sinuses and so forth Lord we just pray God you touch her Lord now I ask God that you would just come down in a special way anoint me Lord Jesus to speak your word father what you would have to say to the people tonight we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen turn if you will to Revelations The Book of Revelations 3 Revelations 3 and uh we'll read verse 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this evening amen amen tonight service I do feel like amen uh is certainly a message that'll help us if you're really interested in drawing closer to the Lord amen how many is interested in drawing closer to the Lord and we're going to learn how just how to do that with the help of the Lord amen and so I want to maybe just start kind of where I've uh felt led to begin with amen because we know that first of all that Jesus is the door he is a door now brother Brandon preached I think five messages on uh I think I counted about five message on the door to the heart door to the heart and of course he would always go when he spoke of that he would talk about even Hitler he would talk about Hitler if Hitler would come to your door knocking and how how what a privilege that would have been amen now I'm sure that would be scary after you found out what he really was right I mean afterwards now maybe before when you still had respect for him you know you could maybe you know give him honor and so forth but certainly not after you find out what he was able capable of and what he's done amen you wouldn't want him at your door a so amen amen but uh I mean he also talked about Caesar and different ones you know that come to the door but we realize the one great door that we've been privileged amen uh to have and that is the door of Jesus Amen and over uh I believe it was way over in Genesis over in Genesis when uh Adam and Eve had eternal life and they forfeited that eternal life by disobeying what God Said and it says in verse uh chapter 3 and: 22 and the Lord said behold the man is come as one of us to know good and evil and now least he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from when he was taken so he drove out to man amen and he placed at the east of e Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life in other words to keep them from actually receiving eternal life so he basically closed the door the door become shut now how many knows this is the most tragic thing that we could have ever imagined because it was the fall of humanity right it was the fall of humanity was the separation of Adam and Eve and the fellowship that they had with Almighty God it was the end of a perfect life it was the end of speaking the word and uh you know that word being confirmed moving trees moving mountains and whatever you wanted to it was the end of that and it was beginning of toil it was beginning of sweating starting to have to work for everything that you do that we experience today isn't that right and I did a a a pretty long study about that but I I really want to go in a different direction before we run out of time tonight but I feel to just maybe pick this up because this is kind of what uh the direction that I kind of want to go with there at first amen and so amen amen how many loves the Lord tonight can we just take our time amen this time I have set this to only shut down every 15 minutes so hopefully we won't struggle with it quite as much amen now we're going to go way back here amen and of course we know that those those those cherubims uh you know that protected all four sides amen of the garden of Ed four different sides that they and brother bam talked about it representing the four uh the 12 tribes of the children of Israel is that right the 12 tribes there's four can't I don't have it here but there's four tribes on each each side that guarded the throne isn't that right where where the throne is where God is also it come down into the New Testament representing Matthew Mark Luke and John now I'm not going to go into great DET detail of this but Revelations chapter when he brother Brandon preached Revelations chapter 4 part three is where he explains all of these things everything from uh you know uh Dan and Ephraim and Reuben I believe it is and all of different the the heads of the tribes like Ruben and Dan and I think Dan was the face of a man and uh and and I can't remember just what all of them were but they all all represented the four powers of Revelations okay those four those four and also Matthew Mark and Luke represented those same things amen so Matthew Mark Luke and John became the four guards or cherubims so to speak that protected the way of life only with these it was not anymore keeping people out isn't that right but this Matthew Mark Luke and John amen uh pointed to one thing and they guarded the book of Acts how many knows because the book of Acts was the door or the Gateway back to God how many believe that acts 238 is the door to God repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promise is to you to your children to them that are far off this was the key that Peter had amen that God gave to Peter that whatever he locks his lock whatever he unlocks he gave him the keys to the kingdom and he was unlocking so to speak this door amen and Matthew Mark Luke and John brother Brandon when he was speaking is in Revelation chapter 4 part three where he spoke greatly and he was trying to go into many different scriptures but amen I thought of that same I was thinking of the same thing where Matthew he talked about going into all the world teaching them to observe all things whatever I have command Ed you amen is that right he says baptizing them in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost Luke also at the end of his chapter he says you know and then open he their understanding that they might understand the scripture thus it behold Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remissions of sins should be preached should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem so all of those guards all they pointed all pointed to that gate amen amen but the book of Acts actually shows exactly where that gate was amen and that was amen repentance amen and accepting of the Lord Jesus Christ so he says it this way he says now instead of the cherubims now I want you to I want you to I want to say something instead of those cherubims guarding this Throne they're out here seeking trying to run people amen trying to bring people through the gate back to the tree of life again that they might take this Jesus said I am the bread of life that come down from heaven Amen in other words in another place brother bam says he says we know that he would guard it the way we know that Jesus said that I am the way the truth and the life so it guarded it from becoming to Christ amen and receiving eternal life but here they're pointing to Jesus Christ and now not only are they trying to drive people in and drive the people to come and and we think of the scripture he says where he says go out into highways and H Hedges and compel them to come in amen so there we're compelling trying to get our best to get people to come in cuz how many knows there's another door that want to talk about how many knows that there's a door what we call the door when Opportunity Knocks when Opportunity Knocks amen sometimes it's best to take it amen and amen opportunity is a great door amen privilege is the door amen we're are privileged people how many how many times brother B said that we are privileged people as long as Jesus is sitting on that Mercy Seat we are a privileged people ain't that right to be able to come into that door one of those that one day that door will be shut there will be no more privilege there will be no more opportunity for people to come amen how many knows this opportunity that we have to come to Christ is only in this world and in this realm Catholics try to tell you that they have a Purgatory they can pray you out if you have 100 Grand 150 Grand well you know you might be able to help your ancestors [Music] out or we can sell you a bridge on the Sahara somewhere they're selling something a that right there somebody something and they're getting rich doing it too is that right oh my I don't want to go there but we know in the Dark Ages Luther me one of the thesis was man he says this thing about at during that time they were actually giv people uh you know if you paid the priest so much he would write a writing and let you have indulges isn't that right indulge in sin and you'll be pardoned you'll be forgiven wow he's really hungry for filthy lucer isn't he yeah but he gets the goal of the world but anyway so much for that but uh anyway so yeah so there's no there's no after this life is over this is the time that we're privileged we have a very the opportunity the door of opportunity and I thought you know just like anybody any one of us if we had a had a had a um maybe a company that would call us and offer us $50 an hour to do something pretty simple and easy and my you got a great retirement you got a 401k that in 20 years or 15 years you're going to have $10 million in the bank how many take it probably yeah yeah yeah yeah I would I would do that you're going to be able to retire in 10 years cuz surely you're smart enough to take 10 million turnning around and make another 10 or so is that right and just live off the interest or something right but anyway yeah you would you know and so there' be benefits that come along with that amen be with that privilege how many knows that it's a absolute uh a privilege to boy this glasses man take them away amen it's a it's a privilege and an honor to know the Lord Jesus Christ to serve him I'm glad to be serving him amen we're not worried about 10 million we're not worried about that worried about we're about the worried about the benefits that we're going to receive at the end of this life of having a new body amen why do I say new body oh we're there going to have joy unspeakable we're going to have peace we're going to have love of God it's going to be all great and hungry no all of those things you already possess the only thing you you ought to need tonight is a body change why because you're already redeemed brother benam said you already have the joy of the Lord we all have peace that pass this understanding already we all ought to already have the peace of God in our hearts we should all have the love of God in our hearts already not all over there amen when we come into Christ we receive the benefits of almighty God before I preach my sermon can I talk about those benefits for just a minute I thought about those benefit benefits that we get from God and and David he said it in Psalms 105 103 103 he says you know bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is with me within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all of his benefits how many knows it's just awesome to be inside of this door I'm glad to that Jesus is the door and that you don't try to clim CL up some other way but we come in the way that he said to come there's a lot of people trying to climb up some other way but there's only one way amen and we're in that by God's grace we can say hopefully everybody man woman and child is in that in Christ amen how many knows that when you were in Christ you have escaped the corruption that is in the world oh my I want to tell you so much all at once and I can't let me go on getting out all these benefits who forgive us all thine iniquities how many know that's one of the benefits when you come to God when you accept him you get your iniquities forgiven that's right all of your iniquity is gone sometimes we have a hard time forgiving ourselves or thinking that God will forgive us because perhaps of the all the Fai that we have but I'm here to tell you that God is rich in Mercy and he is more willing to forgive the times in what where we willing to forgive ourselves your servant of God that tells us to forgive each other 490 times a day amen our God is a very forgiving God come on open up the benefits a little bit and realize he's there to forgive you of all your iniquities hallelujah amen all right I'm going to bring this while I'm at it brother B makes a statement he says he said uh the power he says and the power that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power we are now in the power of the Resurrection see and if there wasn't a law to Faith to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them World out here and go live a private life on it amen you have the power in you to do it if you have one shadow of the power of God in you you got the power of God to do it because God is omnipotent you could speak a world into existence and go live on it amen now I said that because I and and I wrote down here that I might make some controversial statement here but you bear with me amen I'll get back on the thought here praise the Lord listen you know talking about creating a world and living on it I've got wrote down here we can't change the world that we live on but we can change the world that we live in how many believe that let me see here see let me finish the quote that's what power is in the church now but it is controlled by law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a La of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe if you can believe it whatever God will lead you your soul to believe it's yours wow so brother Bram says you know if there wasn't a law to amen the benefits that you have been given of faith we talk about how that all things are possible them they believe we believe in amen casting out cancer and whatever it might be a't that right anything's possible stopping the sun and the moon like like Joshua did am mean now brother B says here if there wasn't a lot of your faith you could create a world and go live on it and I've got wrote down here you know but God don't give you the faith to do that cuz I am happy with the fact that Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you can come how many believes he's creating that world Amen praise the Lord now the reason I brought this in was that when you come into Christ and you receive these benefits amen your whole world changes amen I think it was in Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think whenever they uh what was it I forget what it was but it was some movie called where he went into the future ain't that right he went into the future and they would try to change the future and then and that would change the present if and they come back from the future and try to change something isin that right and then that that would change the whole universe or the way that everything went be an alternate universe an alternate universe another another different course what about where in the world are you going with a big big old fch of old movies well I'm I think of when you come into Christ I think of when we come into Christ how did it change us your Universe it changes the world that you live on or not on but in how many know we all live in the world those Sinners out there those dope addicts they live in their own world brother bam said that Jesus lived in the world to himself amen and he had the faith he lived by the faith of God he lived by the love of God that's the world that Jesus lived in how many know the devil he lives in a different world Sinners live in a different world so to speak amen than what a Christian does and when you come into Christ wo I'm so glad that I did when I was young because I'm telling you what my universe and my world it ain't no telling what I would be no telling what you would be you might be a murderer ain't no telling what we would be Brother Brad because the world of this flesh and the world of the spirit are two different worlds amen or univers is as you might want to put it amen all right now let's go on with this thought that's right he forgives all of your iniquities Health all of your diseases praise the Lord I want to say that you might we we can both change our future we can change our past and we can change our present those are the the statements I really meant to make in first place took me a long time to get to it think about it isin't that something how many things you can change your past how in the world can you change your past and how can you change your future haven't we all said that the choices you make today will determine where you are in 5 years from now you are here because of choices you made in the past you're future will depend hey how many knows in the in this world every preacher preaches it that this is where you make your choice where you're going to spend eternity so you can change that future from Hell going Hellbound to heavenbound why it's all by the blood of Jesus Christ of course it's not by your own power but because that we're benefits we have access to the benefit of actually changing our future that's right and then the past how do you change your past well he forgives you all of your iniquities according to brother bam we are justified by faith and I can remember my past you can remember your past but brother brandham said that when God's eyes it's as though you've never done it in the first place you change it why by the blood of Jesus Christ he takes a ntion says it never happened in the first place W that's how we change it yeah aren't you glad that you can change your past you can erase your past brother bam said he says there's only one way to stop that recordered it's only one way to erase that amen and get the blood of dip it in the blood of Jesus Christ woo when I think of the benefits of coming into the door of Christ amen I praise God that I'm not out there brother Tommy and Tammy look at you where would you be if Tommy would have kept going down the road he was you wouldn't be sitting there together no my my my that's right but think about God come down God changes Futures God can change your [Applause] future that's what this door does what the benefit that is amen your iniquities are gone all your sins are gone you ain't got to worry about judgment how many knows this is white Throne judgment but you ain't got to worry you ain't got to fear why because you've already come to the Judgment you come to church amen you listen to the preacher step on your toes bring condemnation to you until you repent say God take this from me take that from me we send them on before to judgment I like that it's like having a reservation hey I got a reservation amen they say okay yeah you're on the book you're good to go room 221 hello or you get there and no we're full go to the next one no we're full go to the next one even brother B says you better have reservations you better have made pres preparation and reservations when you come to that door amen what wonderful benefits amen so let's create our world Amen how many believes you we can you can create your world by coming into Christ now notice if you're LED of the spirit then you don't come fulfill the lust of the flesh but if you live in the flesh now how many knows I'm going to get into this tonight see taste feel hear and smell conscience reason imagination and so forth is that right brother brandham called those inlets those inlets now what's an inlet it's like a door something that lets in amen how many knows that a door well that one don't swing both ways but a door can let in or a door can let out so it's not only an inlet but it's an outlet and I don't want to talk to you about those doors here but we'll we'll get into that here after a bit well actually let's just cover it I did this kind of covers the flesh if you live in the spirit you won't fulfill the less of the flesh now notice how many knows that c taste feel hear and smell that's the flesh even conscience memory reason and so forth even that can be evil very very evil this Paul said here he says the works of the flesh are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulation wrath Strife sedition heresies how many know that's where the carnal believer or the carnal man lives that's the world he lives on envyings murderers drunkenness reings and such like of the which I tell you before and I've told you in the past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit is love and joy and peace and longsuffering and gentleness and goodness and Faith how many's glad to live in that world to live in that realm that's one of the benefits of coming into Christ you're not fulfilling the lust of the flesh you're fulfilling the desires of the spirit praise be to God Amen Hallelujah and so what a wonderful wonderful privilege that we have brother Bram says you know we need to do all for Christ that we can now because you won't have an opportunity like this again this is the only time that we're going to get to go through what we go through this is the only time that when you're going through a hard time like job did the praise the Lord anyway how many believe that choice free moral agency is a door free agency is a door amen free moral agency is a door all right let's kind of get to my core thought we're going to start with brother Brandon preaching on the door to the heart and as you know he talked about the artist that that painted that picture of Christ ain't that right with no door knob and that picture had to go through the Hall of critics first all the critics looked at and say hey what no what what's this there's no knob on the door brother B makes a statement he says that's the way it is with the church God is painting a picture of a beautiful holy church but before it can ever be taken from the Earth to the Hall of Fame in the Palace of God it must first pass down the line of critics amen how many believe that blessed are you when men shall revile you and cast your name out as evil and see all kinds of manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake amen but Abraham says great men in this great big world has there's been many of them that has exist existed has knocked on doors and he's thinking of Caesar how when he would come down to a door of a peasant knocked on on the door when the peasant opened that door he could have seen who it was knocking he would have probably prostrated himself on the floor and said welcome Cesar just come into my house and honor me with you honor me with your coming into my humble abode and whatever you find in here whatever your heart desires take it it's yours amen so if a great man would come and do that come to your house I thought of my guns some nice guns I got you like the hunt oh I got some nice hunting guns I'd do it for Trump yeah I'd do it for Trump trump go ahead brother get whatever you want take whatever you want you honored me with coming to my house what can I do you'd welcome him ain't that right m but he said a lot of times you know but the greatest person that could ever come and knock on your heart's door is Jesus Christ amen now can I say something that's a yeah yeah say something amen when he comes and if he knocks on your door it's not just you coming to church are you just hearing the word of God in your ears I remember when I was a sinner and people tell me the scriptures is that it didn't mean anything to me at all but when Christ come and he begin to knock amen he begin to pull he begin to draw amen he was different I want to tell you something when the Holy Spirit comes and he touches your heart when he quickens something to you when you feel that pull respond on to it that's the greatest honor that you can have is the Holy Spirit to knock on your heart's door say Come Into My Heart Lord come into my heart come on Into My Heart Lord Jesus come in today come in to stay Come Into My Heart Lord Jesus how many said that that right brother Glenn Sherry come into my heart you welcome him in and and then he comes in there oh my let me see here then brother bam says then in the heart there is little doors like in your house if I come to your house to visit you and you welcome me and said brother B I give you this house and all that's within it he says but then you take me by the hand and you say you see this is your door I don't want you going in there and you see this place here I don't want you going in there this place don't you go in there then I then I'm just partially welcome that's the way it is usually with with people that receive the Lord Jesus he's partially welcome but he wants to come in and be welcome again he says let's examine some of these doors you say oh yes Jesus I will receive you as my savior but now and I just want to make this I want to make this statement before I read this that when Jesus comes into your house I want you to understand that Jesus is Snoopy and Jesus meddles you want it to get here's where we get closer to the Lord here okay are you ready Jesus medals he's Snoopy what I mean by snooping he likes to look around your house he like to see what kind of pictures you got on the wall he likes to go into your bathroom he likes to open the drawers he likes to go in your closet he likes to open them closet doors I don't care how small your door is he likes to go looking in that's right all right are you ready for the quote but now don't meddle don't meddle in my business huh I mean there's no area of your life that Jesus is not interested in there's no area of her life where it's well you just do your own thing there I'll leave you alone there I won't meddle in there no he's going to look he's going to inspect everything he wants to be welcome everywhere he don't want you to be saying oh don't you open my closet cuz I got some shorts hanging in there I got some memor clothes in there how many know Jesus cares about how you dress sure he does he cares about how you dress very much so that's the closet what is the bathroom brother berer how many wants to know what the bathroom is what what how does he go into my bathro what's he going to find my bathroom what's he going find my my drawers look at the mirror you got a mirror there cuz every time you get dressed and every time you get ready now you don't but the world does the church world when he opens up a denominational drawer he'll find every kind of makeup there is in there and he'll know that that mirror is used to paint them lips and whatever else it might be Hello I'm are we right tonight or aren't we and he don't like all that he don't want all that he says hey what is this doing in your drawer now I want to bring it in the five out one of the I'm I'm just going to touch on a couple tonight but the one of the brother bam called our SE t feel here and smell inlets is that right and one of them is conscience is that right brother bab says some people have such a ser conscience they don't even have a conscience how many knows you've got to open that door of your conscience he's sensitive the holy spirit is sensitive so sensitive that whenever brother bam would tell him he's here now don't go to the bathroom don't get up and walk around he don't like that it distracts him I don't understand that that's pretty sensitive be reverent be quiet be calm Snoopy I say because God Amen he's interested in the most detail of your life and he will go into your conscience a lot of times and he'll say well what about this wony what about that amen you judge yourself on what it is but if you want to I'm going to say this if you want a closer walk with God you're going to have to open more doors you're going to have to open them doors we say that you know when you're wanting healing or you want something from God and and then you got to go and you got to sweep the house or you got to amen uh get all the skeletons out of the closet so to speak ain't that right you want to make sure that there's nothing hid down in your life that's going to hinder your healing you got to open that door you got to open that closet and say God search me search me all the way to the back little corner of the closet and find out if there's anything that I need to make right and if there is I'll make it right cuz I'm convinced there's a lot of people cuz it's hard one of the hardest things to do is when the Holy Spirit tells you using your conscience using your uh memory going into the door of your memory and knowing that you did somebody wrong and you never want to make it right you don't want to apologize because you just don't have it in you to apologize I thought about this while I was studying this and I hope everybody hears that but a real good medicine for your soul a real good healing for your soul a real good Deliverance for your soul is for you to say I'm sorry or I'm wrong or I was wrong will you forgive me that's one of the best medicines there is amen cuz just as the devil can use your conscience if you w don't watch he'll try to use your memory and your conscience to convict you of things you've done wrong that you've made right and it'll still bother you and you've got to say devil I'm slamming this door shut cuz it's under the blood but at the same time you've got to say to the Lord this door is open Lord how many would say to my conscience is open Lord if I need conviction convict me Snoop down into my soul Snoop into every area of my life see if there's any wicked way in me anywhere if there is take it out I want you to be Snoopy I want you to meddle in my affairs God loves to meddle in your Affairs we don't like when preachers meddle in your Affairs huh well he does Jesus does and every one of us got to be open and don't be having no Pitchfork religion with this oh I know so and so and I know so and so you better check your own house how many know if you have a business that first thing in your business is the Lord Jesus Christ amen I don't care what you have I don't care what it is and if Christ ain't first something else is and he's knocking hey you're putting something else in front of me amen and if you do that's actually what you love more that's where your treasure is and it's an idol that's right no matter what it is brother Brandon he would go into your private life he would talk about your self life uh and things like that I chose to go kind of into the direction of our our inlets of our uh see taste feel hear and smell amen that's right praise the Lord don't meddle in my business or my Affairs but God's going to do it he even checks the drawers the closet no matter what it is your feelings is another door brother banam when he preached on the inlets and when he preached on these different things he preached on the greatest battle ever fought and he talked about that's your universe that's your world how many knows this that that's the world that we have now I wish I'd have it but I don't try to I'm going to have have to try to get it organized a little better but we know he brother bam said draw three circles one is the body second one is the spirit and on the inside it's the soul body see taste feel hear and smell conscience region imaginations infections and so forth and memory and then on the inside is your soul that's controlled by one thing or other Faith or doubt isin't that right now I say controlled by but later in brother Brand's Ministry and I just read it before we come out he says that soul in there has to be a seed germ of God that is where your anchor is because people can do everything in the spirit realm and so forth but he says that soul that seed has to be of God Amen and he talks about how that how that the the Holy Spirit has to come in and he has to be the guard of each one of those places everything has to be scoured out all of those things have to be scoured out is that right or should I say protected by the Holy Ghost cuz if it isn't protected by the Holy Ghost and if it isn't cuz it's like I said it's a Inlet it comes in and we have a feeling and we all got feelings man how how how we can in our memory we all love good feelings we love to feel good but I wrote down here how can you feel good when you have condemnation in your conscience if your conscience condemns you how can you really feel good it don't matter if you marry a boy or boy marries a girl and you think that they're going to be a lot happy if you're married if you're not happy before you're probably not going to be happy afterwards why because that peace and that happiness has got to be in here first amen if you're relying on that it's not going to fulfill it why do you think there's so many divorces my husband just don't make me happy my wife just don't make me happy I'm he just does hasn't you know been what I expected him to be this that or the other you aren't happy in the first place in in the first place how many's glad to feel good amen feeling bad is a horrible thing feeling bad is a I hate to feel bad the only way you'll feel good is by having the Holy Spirit In Your Heart amen praise the Lord how many's glad for that amen now listen so he says so you can come in but don't you dare open that door amen don't you go in this one you stand right there why you would feel very not feel very welcome that's the way it is with some church members just let him come in oh I want you to be my savior but he wants to be your lord Lord Lord is rulership Jesus says why do you call me Lord and don't do the things say the do the things that I say or I command how many believe that Jesus wants to be the Lord of all the kingdoms of your heart you know I can say this for the church here when I talk about past when I talk about forgiveness even brother Andrew Glover really brought it in right after the next service after I had preached on it y all re see that and and and brought it to where hey you know you've got to make sure that that past is Forgiven that you don't hold grudges of the past and so forth it because it'll affect you not them and all of that I hope that's the case here with all of us I believe it is I don't know anybody here that's got that we've given forgiven anybody of any other path ain't that right that's right so I want to say that I believe when God opens that door when he knocks on that door the door of your past a't that right hey is everything taken care of Amen I'm going to come back a little bit let's talk about conscience just a little bit it's so important that you have a tender conscience I'm gonna give you a little bun I was driving down the road again today going up had to hurry to Hopkinsville get a park I had my my my my thought I had my message and everything I had to get aart and and I said I I I was just getting it down through there and and I was thinking about this message of of the Lord touching your heart and speaking to you and I looked down at my speedometer and I was going about 70 or better and I say what look at there and I said well I'll bring it back down this is Wednesday I'm gonna bring it back down and I thought I'm going to tell the people that I'm a devil I'm going to tell you that yeah sure it was Wednesday and I want to be right with the Lord and I said well I maybe you all pray for me cuz I want to be on Thursday and Friday I want it to be every day this is what come to my heart brother Brandon was so surrendered to God until he he obeyed the speed limit how many he did amen I ain't going to get nobody to raise your hand but the Holy Spirit does convict you of every little thing amen Lord help us that's right because why he wants to be the Lord how many likes when he rules how many wants him to rule every aspect of your life why because if you rule it you're going to wreck it you ain't going to run it right it's not going to be blessed anyway so let God have control let God have control of every area of your life let him open up every door let him be snooping let him medle let whatever he wants Lord but you've got to have a sensitive conscience so he can talk to you because that's how he talks some people men yeah I'm a Christian with makeup and shorts on and everything else brother bam says you ain't got no more conscience more a snake has hips he was pretty hard about it he ain't got no conscience Bible says their conscience is seared with a hot iron amen well don't Am I Wrong Brother Brad or is as hot iron searing something would take the feeling out of it right it would take the feeling out of it so Lord help us tonight to have our conscience open to the holy spirit because it's important your seeing is important your understanding is important one of the greatest things one of the greatest one of the greatest things that I can think of is is is as far as when it comes to a door is your mind the door of your mind how many has heard the phrase you got to have a keep an open mind you got to keep your mind open to what God has cuz brother baham says he says it first comes down through the womb of your mind and then it goes down into your soul and you receive the word of God it comes down in there amen it becomes a revelation it becomes real brother bam says and the power of God comes down there and that's what gives you power it's not mind over matter but it's mind receiving it but now that door also has to be closed how many knows the birds can fly over your head but you shut that door amen how many would agree that there's a lot of sin when the Devil comes with temptation when the Devil comes with a thought that you shouldn't think slam the door on the devil say shut up devil get out of here slam the door no more stop it right there all night I've been trying to think about that girl that had that dance that went to that dance what is her name and she stopped back at the dance hall again Nelly Sanders trying to think of that Nelly that's that's right how many knows she just went by she stopped for a minute and she opened the door if she didn't just shut the door said no don't even try it she had never been on the Dance Floor brother Brandon wouldn't have to cast a bunch of wing bats out of her ain't that right flying everywhere and his brother man and jumping around in the bed all kinds of things carrying on I believe it was why open up the door young people remember that your minds is important I don't know I hope you you kids don't ever come to the place and I'll tell you this sometimes your mind tries to get the better of you you battle with your mind and your battle with your mind and I trust that you don't I'll tell you when you're your battle and your torment of your mind's going to come if you stay on the fence with things well do I want to serve God or don't I well I you know I failed I'll never be a Christian don't go there you're going to get confused you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God devil ain't got no right no I'm a Child of God stay right there because your mind can be a real people will blow their brains out because of their mind the torment of their mind they'll do it God help us we don't want to go there especially our young people stay close to God Amen Eve did it she opened it up didn't she she kept an open mind when she shouldn't have amen and she just allowed the devil to come in and place that there amen Lord help us the door of our thoughts amen like I said there's a lot of things that you want to slam the door shut on when it comes to the devil because it starts with the mind and it comes down into here just like with feelings if you have been hurt by somebody hello and you hold that you're going to have a grumpy face I don't trust people I don't like people can I say something even message people that claim to be Christians if they live in the flesh and are selfish are very ugly very ugly I'll say this they're worse than the sinner because the sinner you know what you're dealing with brother Braham says there's no bigger stumbling block in the world than a professor with without a confession you better have it but BR place I'm going to say this this is a little strong but it's the truth some people ought to just not claim to be Christians they'd be better off not claiming to be a Christian if they're living completely and all the time contrary to it even brother brandham said that get an experience get the Holy Ghost and if you are I believe if you are a Christian you'll go to the corn field you'll go in the wood you'll go somewhere and say God I got to have this I got to have what I profess I don't want to live a hypocritical life amen I want to be exactly what I say that I am praise the Lord memory precious memory how they linger I think about a young people they're growing up all of y'all you're growing up right here with us and when you're grown when you're married whether you stay here which I hope you will but if you go off you'll always remember the little church at evening light Tabernacle and the folks that you dealt with how they treated one another amen how many believes that it's important you know to have kind affections be kindly affectionate one towards another be kind one to another love one another prefer one another see how many he says that without there'll be there will be people who are without natural affections affection is one of those things of the spirit another Inlet it's also a outlet amen you have affection towards one another you love one another you're kind one another want to one another Amen brother brandom's World got tore up a little bit sometimes come home and his wife crying Ain that right the children fighting one another wife crying doing the dishes and everything else it's just too much what did he do he created his world cuz we are amateur creators and he begin to go over there and talk about aess he saw amen pretty soon she was happy again the kids were calm and everything else changed the whole atmosphere why because of his kindness because of his having affection all these things are good how many believes that there's a six sense that were given that six sth is the faith that brings the Holy Ghost brother Braham says every one of these Outlets every of these doors have to be controlled by the Holy Ghost so that we can have feeling one for another so we can have longsuffering for one another gentleness forgiving one another is't that right good feelings towards one another sit in Heavenly places not hellish yeah but Heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise the Lord amen God wants to talk to you God wants to talk to me how many wants a closer to walk with God wouldn't we say then Lord Jesus I'm opening every door you're welcome everywhere you're welcome in my kitchen you're welcome in my living room you're welcome in my business you're welcome in my private life brother B says private life you're welcome to sit with me when I entertain myself what's your entertainment how do you entertain yourself I don't care if I go in the tree to entertain myself whatever I do Lord let it be pleasing to you isn't that right amen the way that I dress Lord I want it to be pleasing to you amen God bless you let's stand musicians if you'll come amen I like that make Jesus welcome in every aspect of your life amen let's bow our heads I know it's been kind of scattered but I've had so many different things I wanted to say I just trying to follow the leading of the spirit but this is what I want to ask you is there something in your heart in your life that while I was speaking that the Lord touched you about I don't don't know brother brandham he could probably tell you exactly what you're thinking but the Lord also knows he knows exactly what you're thinking what your what you were coming across your mind is there an area of your life that you need to raise your hand say Lord take this door I open it to you take that door Lord walk on in take care of that I'll surrender to you I want you to be the Lord of every room in my house God bless those hands all over the building tonight Lord Jesus you still speak you still knock you knock by bringing those thoughts into the people's hearts bringing it into their lives whatever it is the areas where they could actually welcome you in and say God I want a closer walk with you I want to be pleasing to you Lord because I'm not coming to church because brother berer wants me to or my family wants me to I come to church because I love Jesus I love you and I love your word god and I ask God that you would take your word bring it down into my soul and help me father that I may be surrendered to you Lord Jesus so that I can live in the world of the spirit and not the flesh Lord something that you can bless someplace that you can make your Abode Lord and that you can be the Lord of of all the kingdoms of my heart I now surrender to you Lord by raising my hands and saying God I Surrender my house completely to you wherever it is whatever it is God that is not pleasing to you Lord God sensitize my spirit make me sensitive to it so that you can speak to my heart and I can know just what it is that you're saying to me Lord bless him now in the name of Jesus Christ and we ask God also while we're praying forgive us Lord Jesus where we do have failures I couldn't understand so many times how your Prophet would say Lord forgive us of our wrongs forgive us so many times he'd say forgive us Lord but I realize Lord that we do need forgiveness we need your grace in our life we need to to forgive our iniquities Lord Jesus sometimes we know to do better and don't Lord we ask you to forgive all of our iniquities put him in the sea of your forgetfulness Lord Jesus May choices that are made right now hands that are raised right now may it change their future may they not be the same and live in the same walk in the same world so to speak the same atmosphere that they did today Lord tomorrow may it be different God closer to you more sensitive to you Lord my hands are up Lord I only have one interest and that is to be closer to you Lord to be pleasing to you in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all oh Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart and Jesus I surrender all my Jesus I surrender all my Jesus I surrender all the kingdoms of my heart amen God bless you Church the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all oh Jesus be the Lord Lord of all the kingdoms Jesus I surrender all oh and Jesus I surren all Jesus I Sur all Jesus Son surrender all the kingdoms of my heart amen you love him with all of your heart tonight you enjoy the word tonight man brother Thomas was talking about speeding I remember my dad told me we he used to go to Jeffersonville to hear the prophet he said we'd Race we' drive 100
