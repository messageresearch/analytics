[17:25] good morning brothers and
[17:26] sisters if we just stand this
[17:30] morning ask brother Joe to open us in
[17:33] prayer this morning
[18:27] you
[18:29] open
[18:59] of
[19:55] brother
[19:59] and
[20:49] amen if we go in the scripture here in
[20:51] the Psalms Psalms
[20:53] 37 we're going to read from Psalms 37
[20:56] we're going to go start in verse verse
[20:58] one and go to verse
[21:03] 19 if we just think back like brother
[21:06] Joe said in that prayer if we just think
[21:08] back of where the Lord's brought us from
[21:11] and then that thought like that L little
[21:13] old lady
[21:14] said she said well I'm not what I want
[21:18] to be and I'm not what I ought to be but
[21:20] I sure ain't what I used to be and we
[21:23] can praise the Lord for that he's
[21:24] helping us every day Psalms 37
[21:30] fret fret not thyself because of
[21:33] evildoers neither be thou envious
[21:36] against the workers of
[21:43] iniquity trust in the Lord and do good
[21:46] so shalt thou dwell in the land and
[21:49] verily Thou shalt be
[21:56] fed commit thy way unto the the Lord
[21:59] trust also in him and he shall bring it
[22:01] to
[22:07] pass rest in the Lord and wait patiently
[22:10] for him fret not thyself because of hang
[22:14] on here fret not thyself because of him
[22:17] who prosper in his way because of the
[22:19] man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass
[22:29] for evildoers shall be cut off but those
[22:31] that wait upon the Lord they shall
[22:33] inherit the
[22:42] Earth but the meek shall inherit the
[22:45] earth and shall Delight themselves in
[22:47] the abundance of
[22:53] Peace the Lord shall laugh at him for he
[22:56] seeth that his day is coming
[23:08] their sword shall enter into their own
[23:10] heart and their bow shall be
[23:17] broken for the arms of the wicked shall
[23:19] be broken but the Lord upholdeth the
[23:26] righteous this one together they shall
[23:29] not be ashamed in the evil time and in
[23:32] the days of famine they shall be
[23:34] satisfied God bless you may be seated
[23:36] Brother
[23:40] Brad good morning brothers and sisters
[23:42] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[23:45] morning everybody should have rested
[23:47] well shouldn't had any trouble sleeping
[23:50] after yesterday so hope everybody
[23:52] enjoyed their yourself couple of quick
[23:54] announcements and then uh I'll I'll be
[23:56] out of the way here but um the
[23:58] decorations the flowers I just wanted to
[24:00] let everybody know if anybody want to
[24:02] take those with you take them uh they
[24:05] they they're I'm sure they're thirsty
[24:07] but any of the mums the flowers the
[24:10] pumpkins all those decorations that were
[24:12] left here um if you want them for your
[24:14] house your kids want the pumpkins you
[24:16] want the flowers the moms take them give
[24:18] them some water and they'll they'll keep
[24:20] on going till Frost so uh just want to
[24:22] get that out there and cuz we don't want
[24:24] to take them home so uh we' we've seen
[24:27] all the flowers we want to see for a
[24:28] while and uh so you enjoy them uh but on
[24:32] a more serious note we do want to come
[24:34] before the church and just kind of share
[24:36] something with you that's been on our
[24:37] heart this last week and uh speaking
[24:40] about the devastation in the in the
[24:42] mountains and in Tennessee North
[24:44] Carolina and different places uh did get
[24:46] to talk to brother Daryl the other day
[24:48] and just kind of uh he shared some
[24:51] thoughts with me of of the things that's
[24:53] going on I know you know we got John
[24:55] Michael there and some different ones
[24:56] that are that are there and I'm sure put
[24:58] forth effort so just a reminder today's
[25:01] offering will all go towards uh the
[25:04] relief effort there and uh talking to
[25:07] brother Bor I think what we're going to
[25:08] do is we're just going to combine the
[25:10] check uh combine all the funds that come
[25:13] in and make one check and take it to
[25:15] them um and the reason that is is
[25:18] because they they know what they need um
[25:21] and so they can distribute the money so
[25:23] our church will make a a a check to
[25:25] their church and the disaster relief
[25:27] effort
[25:29] and they can go and get what they need
[25:30] from where they need as they see the
[25:32] needs uh they are running I don't want
[25:35] to say running low on money but I think
[25:36] there is a definitely according to
[25:38] brother Daryl a financial need they have
[25:40] spent tens of thousands of dollars out
[25:42] of their Church um and to to try to
[25:45] support the efforts and so uh with that
[25:48] being said that's what the funds today
[25:50] will go for um the Lord laid it on my
[25:53] heart um you know I just you know the
[25:56] Lord places each of us in position and
[25:58] places your place of employment whatever
[26:00] your job is the contacts you know the
[26:03] network of people okay he places you
[26:05] there so uh he laid it on my heart and
[26:08] I'm going to I'm going to this Thursday
[26:10] I'm planning to take my truck and
[26:12] trailer and they need canned goods
[26:16] blankets um and the thing is they they
[26:18] don't want to deplete the local
[26:20] environment yes we can order and and
[26:23] send there uh and but they don't want to
[26:26] deplete the local environment for people
[26:28] that can get to the goods and make the
[26:31] shelves bare so we want to be able to
[26:33] I'm I'm going to put out to my network
[26:35] of people and the community that I know
[26:37] and and try to just say hey we're going
[26:39] to do a canned food drive blankets he
[26:42] said one of the big things they need is
[26:43] is empty plastic gas cans uh to try to
[26:47] get gas to generators and and pumps and
[26:51] and things like that so um if if one of
[26:54] those three things if if if you work at
[26:56] a place and you want to do a little can
[26:58] fish food drive um anybody that can help
[27:01] me pick up from little places uh Tuesday
[27:04] or Wednesday if they get their stuff
[27:05] together and want to pick it up we'll
[27:07] we'll also uh have a place here at the
[27:10] church Wednesday night I'll bring my
[27:11] truck and trailer uh if you want to take
[27:14] water canned good well let's brother
[27:17] Daryl said kind of back off the water at
[27:19] this point I think because they've got a
[27:20] couple of tractor and trailers that are
[27:22] bringing water okay so um and if we get
[27:25] enough canned goods that I can't pull it
[27:27] in my trailer I'm sure we can get a
[27:29] tractor and trailer to take it up there
[27:30] we got people that's got the ability and
[27:32] the capability so uh this is a time for
[27:35] us to see uh how we can help our
[27:38] brothers and sisters that are helping
[27:40] others in their Community um and and we
[27:43] just want to be be able to do that if we
[27:45] can and I believe I believe it's our
[27:47] responsibility you know many times we
[27:49] rely heavily we rely heavily on the
[27:51] government and disasters well I'm not
[27:55] being political here but out of the
[27:56] mouth of their own people they have no
[27:59] money to send to these people uh
[28:03] $750 can you imagine in the blink of an
[28:06] eye a a tidal wave washes away your
[28:08] entire life everything you have your car
[28:11] your home your possessions your
[28:14] everything is gone in the blink of an
[28:17] eye and the government says well we can
[28:19] give you
[28:21] $750 so um you know we just want to be
[28:25] able to to to help and make a difference
[28:27] where we can and I believe we got a
[28:29] strong group of people here and I
[28:31] believe we got a strong network of
[28:32] people that know people and can pull
[28:35] things off so if somebody wants to do
[28:37] monetary value I'll be glad to take that
[28:40] when I go uh if they want to make a
[28:42] check uh if you if you work at a
[28:45] business and they will let you set up a
[28:46] donation box for the next week we we'll
[28:48] go two weeks in a row three weeks
[28:50] however long they plan to go I asked
[28:51] brother Daryl how long do you plan to go
[28:53] he said I don't see a a stop in the
[28:55] effort right now so if we go this week
[28:58] and we need to go next week I'll we'll
[29:00] work it out we'll find people that can
[29:01] get the stuff there so um we'll make
[29:04] that push you know and and and they're
[29:07] doing such a good work and you know it
[29:09] it sounds they're they're just a you
[29:11] know 800 people or so in the church and
[29:13] they're making a an impact on the lives
[29:15] of the people in their area um as a
[29:18] Friday I believe they had uh visited at
[29:21] that point eight places that nobody had
[29:24] even been to yet that they could not get
[29:26] into they cut their way in they they
[29:28] move dirt and you know I've seen
[29:30] pictures you've seen pictures if you
[29:32] haven't go to the Word of Life flood
[29:35] relief uh Facebook page or or brother
[29:37] Michael Bailey um and just look at the
[29:40] videos look at the pictures and and it
[29:43] just it's an eye opener he said you just
[29:44] can't imagine you just can't imagine the
[29:47] devastation that that I'm seeing and and
[29:50] he just broke down you know and uh so
[29:53] you know pray for their pray for our
[29:55] brothers and sisters that are on the
[29:56] ground the boots on the ground that's
[29:58] making this effort because mentally they
[30:00] are going to
[30:02] be they're going to be suffering
[30:04] mentally their mental health and needs
[30:06] prayer because they're seeing things
[30:08] that human beings don't want to see
[30:11] don't need to see don't like to see and
[30:14] they're they're seeing these things
[30:15] experiencing these things and so they're
[30:17] going to need some help prayer
[30:19] prayerfully uh be prayerfully uh in your
[30:22] uh prayers but for them uh for the
[30:24] things they're saying and you know you
[30:26] think well you know I thought you in my
[30:29] mind I'm thinking Lord I can try to put
[30:30] this together and what if nobody gives
[30:32] anything and I thought you know Jesus
[30:35] fed 5,000 and more with a few fish and a
[30:39] couple pieces of bread and I and then it
[30:42] just kind of dawned on me hey little is
[30:44] much if God is in it so if I have to
[30:46] take one can of green beans I'm G to
[30:48] take one can of green beans and and God
[30:52] can do what he wants to do with it so um
[30:55] we'll just put all of our efforts
[30:56] together I know uh financially sometimes
[30:59] it hurts it's it's tough on everybody
[31:01] right now I know that um and but I asked
[31:04] brother darl about the money needs and
[31:05] the situation he said every little bit
[31:07] helps he said well had somebody come and
[31:09] hand him I think he said
[31:11] $44.75 and they said brother Daryl this
[31:13] is all I had my penny bank but I want
[31:15] you to have
[31:16] it
[31:18] so you know it's
[31:21] uh we can do a

[31:32] what kind of move and impact we can make
[31:34] from our little Community to help our

[1:04:02] Ians kind of different I guess this
[1:04:05] morning uh kind of different can be a
[1:04:09] little
[1:04:11] different SEC 1 Thessalonians 5
[1:04:18] and8 in
[1:04:20] everything give thanks for this is the
[1:04:23] will of God in Jesus Christ Christ
[1:04:26] concerning you amen may God add His
[1:04:29] blessings to the reading of the word you

[1:04:32] seated this morning have you got my
[1:04:35] title up there yet amen I want to speak
[1:04:38] on I want to speak on the attitude of
[1:04:42] gratitude amen the
[1:04:45] attitude of
[1:04:47] gratitude amen and while the scripture
[1:04:52] says in everything
[1:04:57] in
[1:04:58] everything a that
[1:05:00] right so there's a lot of
[1:05:04] stuff there's a lot of things there's a
[1:05:06] lot of aspects of our
[1:05:08] life
[1:05:10] amen and you know I've been kind of
[1:05:13] streaming and looking at every video and
[1:05:16] everything that I could am me on North
[1:05:19] Carolina Tennessee and all the
[1:05:22] devastation and uh that has happened
[1:05:25] there and how it almost looks
[1:05:28] apocalyptic
[1:05:30] amen amen just looks almost like the
[1:05:34] apocalypse amen and
[1:05:35] so uh been looking at it and just
[1:05:39] different things I know brother Joe had
[1:05:41] mentioned some things like caskets
[1:05:43] floating down the river and you know
[1:05:45] we've seen that and just different
[1:05:47] things that where houses of course are
[1:05:48] going in bridges are washed out homes
[1:05:51] are just collapsed and and all the
[1:05:54] things that's happened and I think
[1:05:56] they've called it it's pretty much well
[1:05:58] I've heard something about since 1910 or
[1:06:00] something that they haven't experienced
[1:06:02] something like that so we could call it
[1:06:03] a once in a century storm that right
[1:06:08] once in a century storm so that's uh you
[1:06:12] know that's a long
[1:06:14] time and
[1:06:16] so people lost a lot amen and their
[1:06:20] lives certainly changed in a moment's
[1:06:21] time as brother Brad was saying amen
[1:06:24] just in a very very quick amount of time
[1:06:28] and
[1:06:28] so this is basically where I kind of got
[1:06:31] my message amen because amen how many
[1:06:35] knows that a lot of times we neglect to
[1:06:38] appreciate until we don't
[1:06:40] have and when we you know just the
[1:06:43] simple things like a road you know and
[1:06:46] uh I think Grace was telling me that
[1:06:49] they had went up to Chimney Rock her and
[1:06:51] Mike I think for a date or something up
[1:06:53] to Chimney Rock so they've been there
[1:06:55] before and they know what it's like and
[1:06:57] there was one boy on there on YouTube
[1:06:59] where he was taking a video and he could
[1:07:01] only go so far and showed a police car
[1:07:04] that was all smashed up and the cars
[1:07:07] that were in the river that just looked
[1:07:08] like a pile of rubber and I mean rubble
[1:07:11] and uh he was basically having to walk
[1:07:13] there because you couldn't drive there
[1:07:15] because you know a lot of those places
[1:07:16] are completely cut off because the roads
[1:07:19] are just simply did there just a
[1:07:21] riverbed where there was a road there's
[1:07:22] nothing but like looks like the rest of
[1:07:24] the river right it's just going from
[1:07:27] over here to all the way over there and
[1:07:29] and the way in there's just just no way
[1:07:31] in anymore as far as uh he had to walk
[1:07:34] up through the woods he couldn't really
[1:07:35] even walk along the bank CU washed out
[1:07:38] so bad kind of go up over the Hillside
[1:07:40] and go around and order order in order
[1:07:42] to be able to even get there and you
[1:07:45] know and I I begin to think about all
[1:07:47] the little things amen that we take for
[1:07:50] granted ain't that right we just we just
[1:07:52] aren't appreciative of them like we
[1:07:54] should be so I thought about
[1:07:56] appreciation and I thought about how uh
[1:07:59] that God does want us to appreciate
[1:08:01] things amen and to be Greatful for
[1:08:04] things and to think and I came to this
[1:08:06] scripture amen of in everything give
[1:08:10] thanks amen but so I want to talk and
[1:08:14] I'm going to actually take this storm
[1:08:15] basically and we're going to type it a
[1:08:18] little bit spiritual amen of uh you know
[1:08:22] a a spirit on in on the spirit realm
[1:08:24] because we know know that over I believe
[1:08:27] it is in Isaiah 59 and verse 19 it says
[1:08:31] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:08:35] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:08:37] standard against it ain't that right
[1:08:40] amen and so there's a flood am mean and
[1:08:42] there another place uh you know that
[1:08:44] that Satan's just throwing a flood out
[1:08:46] there and he's trying to wash away every
[1:08:49] thing that is righteous and holy and
[1:08:52] good amen was everything away amen out
[1:08:57] of our lives so to speak amen any God
[1:09:00] that there's around we've seen it amen
[1:09:02] and taking it first of all taking prayer
[1:09:04] out of schools isn't that right taking
[1:09:06] the Bible out of schools and then Ten
[1:09:08] Commandments out of the cour houses and
[1:09:10] they went from there to there to there
[1:09:11] there amen and it's just like a flood
[1:09:13] anything and everything in any possible
[1:09:16] way that they possibly can amen that the
[1:09:18] devil is coming in but how many's glad
[1:09:20] that God does set up a standard amen he
[1:09:23] gives us something to come again it amen
[1:09:26] and to overcome it amen amen and so uh
[1:09:31] you know just before coming out here I
[1:09:33] had a little thought you know that uh
[1:09:36] that is that brother brandham said every
[1:09:38] 2,000 years something major happens and
[1:09:41] that right so he preached on an oncoming
[1:09:44] storm amen how many believes there's a
[1:09:47] storm
[1:09:48] coming amen it is a storm unlike you've
[1:09:51] ever seen amen it's a storm that you and
[1:09:53] I don't want to be no part of amen the
[1:09:56] Vengeance and the whine of the wrath of
[1:09:58] almighty God when it's poured out amen I
[1:10:01] had to think you know this Devastation
[1:10:03] as as brother Brad said brother Daryl
[1:10:06] says it's more than what you can imagine
[1:10:08] you know it's worse than what you can
[1:10:09] imagine and yet amen I have to say this
[1:10:12] morning that it's
[1:10:14] nothing it's nothing compared to the
[1:10:17] storm and the floods that's
[1:10:19] coming ain't that right you know because
[1:10:22] you can still see the hills and you can
[1:10:24] see the mountains and the trees and and
[1:10:26] there's still things left and perhaps
[1:10:28] they can restore but when this flood
[1:10:30] comes that's coming and this this you
[1:10:32] know brother bam said that there there
[1:10:35] the trees out there there won't even be
[1:10:37] any trees left because he said he just
[1:10:40] seen smoldering
[1:10:43] stumps amen when that when those atomic
[1:10:45] bombs go off it'll clean it all off
[1:10:48] completely amen and the trees will be
[1:10:50] gone only these stumps maybe you'll
[1:10:52] still still be on fire and that's all
[1:10:54] that'll be left no people no
[1:10:57] nothing so you know judgment how many
[1:11:00] knows we're living right at the edge of
[1:11:01] the judgments of almighty God Amen and
[1:11:05] uh you think about you think about
[1:11:07] America amen I was looking up and
[1:11:09] brother bam says BR God always sends an
[1:11:11] angel he sends a messenger like Martin
[1:11:14] Luther and and John Wesley to England
[1:11:16] isn't that right Luther was to Germany
[1:11:18] and England and John Wesley and them and
[1:11:20] he says and then after they're done with
[1:11:22] their message he sends a temporary
[1:11:23] judgment and he said look at what
[1:11:25] happened with Germany Ain that right
[1:11:27] look at the devastation and they let him
[1:11:29] get up a Hitler amen that almost got
[1:11:32] them all killed amen you talk about a
[1:11:35] temporary judgment even by the hands of
[1:11:37] Americans and mean dropping that uh
[1:11:40] those those firebombs over the cities
[1:11:43] and
[1:11:44] killing the number of civilians was just
[1:11:48] extraordinary when America went to
[1:11:50] killing civilians as a means to try to
[1:11:52] break down this regime cuz how many
[1:11:54] knows we did
[1:11:56] that's right amen and then also of
[1:11:58] course England you know they got their
[1:12:00] fair share of judgment temporary
[1:12:02] judgment and France and so forth amen
[1:12:04] and I was just listening to Benjamin
[1:12:06] Netanyahu where he was saying how that
[1:12:09] France and uh I call him macaroni I
[1:12:12] don't know macaron or something like
[1:12:14] that amen I don't have much respect for
[1:12:17] him anymore I call him macaroni or
[1:12:19] something because he's pretty much
[1:12:20] jellyfish because he's called for an
[1:12:23] embargo against Israel a a a a you know
[1:12:27] for weapons and so forth and of course
[1:12:30] Netanyahu he says boy that is AB he said
[1:12:32] you know we're going to fight this
[1:12:33] battle we're fighting it on seven
[1:12:36] fronts that's a lot of Nations coming up
[1:12:39] against Israel folks and now for a lot
[1:12:42] of the Western countries to be turning
[1:12:44] them against them it's coming close to
[1:12:46] the Fulfillment of the revelations
[1:12:48] isin't that right where they're all
[1:12:49] turning against them and so forth amen
[1:12:52] and so calling for arms embargo against
[1:12:54] is Israel and what a shame that is amen
[1:12:58] so we see that the storm's Brewing isn't
[1:13:00] it a lot of people thinking I one a
[1:13:02] commentator Amen on the war and he's
[1:13:04] keeping up the war he's over there and
[1:13:06] looking at the war and he says he says
[1:13:07] as far as he's concerned World War III
[1:13:10] has already started he F felt like it
[1:13:12] started with Ukraine is that right
[1:13:14] because it's really about the East
[1:13:15] against the west and they're using the
[1:13:17] Ukraine as a means to do it with and of
[1:13:20] course with Putin saying hey if you join
[1:13:22] in you're part of this war hello and so
[1:13:25] so he says even in World War II it
[1:13:26] started little but he was still part of
[1:13:28] World War II just the little things that
[1:13:31] happened and then then he just watched
[1:13:32] it escalate and you watch and you're
[1:13:34] looking at the escalation of it right
[1:13:36] now amen it's certainly alarming isn't
[1:13:38] it amen and so I got to thinking brother
[1:13:41] bam thinking it was supposed to be over
[1:13:43] by 77 here we are in 2024 we are way
[1:13:48] down the road something's going to break
[1:13:49] loose one of these
[1:13:51] days amen and I can't help but believe
[1:13:55] that if we aren't careful amen cuz this
[1:13:56] is the hour that we need to watch and
[1:13:59] pray and be ready for you don't know the
[1:14:00] day that the hour comes amen Jesus says
[1:14:03] you know that even as these people
[1:14:05] talking about their houses broken down
[1:14:07] and and so forth you know he says you
[1:14:09] know we've got a house that we got to
[1:14:10] watch out for it's this house right here
[1:14:13] amen and you better watch if you know
[1:14:15] what to what if you know what hour the
[1:14:17] thief is coming amen amen I don't know
[1:14:19] and I just illustrate it this way if you
[1:14:21] you know that a thief is coming it makes
[1:14:23] it much better if you don't when a thief
[1:14:25] is coming because you know I don't know
[1:14:27] about you but that would be an absolute
[1:14:29] nightmare Amen to wake up in your bed
[1:14:31] and to have a gun pointed right at your
[1:14:34] nose say all right come on get up here
[1:14:37] and let's go see what you got that I
[1:14:39] want out of your house you'd be a slave
[1:14:41] to do whatever he has to do ain't that
[1:14:43] right amen and it'd be a terrible
[1:14:46] Nightmare and that's the way it is when
[1:14:48] Christ comes and takes his church home
[1:14:50] hello amen and those that are left here
[1:14:53] and realize that they're in the
[1:14:54] tribulation period it's going to be very
[1:14:56] scary for
[1:14:58] you amen I wonder and you know I can't
[1:15:01] help but wonder how many message
[1:15:03] Believers are going to be left here for
[1:15:04] the tribulation period
[1:15:06] hello amen I'll tell you what you better
[1:15:09] go to search in your heart really hard
[1:15:11] and really good amen because I don't
[1:15:14] know about you but I don't plan on being
[1:15:16] here amen I don't want no part of
[1:15:18] tribulation I say Lord oh my you know
[1:15:22] let me talk about another another storm
[1:15:24] coming how many knows there's a storm
[1:15:25] coming called the judgment and the wrath
[1:15:27] of God not only that but the white
[1:15:30] Throne judgment is going to be a scary
[1:15:32] thing because even brother benam said
[1:15:33] you know Pierce me through through Hot
[1:15:35] Irons and not all kinds of all kinds of
[1:15:38] things he said do to my body do to me
[1:15:39] but don't let me be at that white Throne
[1:15:41] judgment because God will have judgment
[1:15:43] without Mercy amen and it's going to be
[1:15:45] a scary thing but how many's glad amen
[1:15:48] that God has made a way of Escape of
[1:15:51] that
[1:15:52] judgment that storm is coming coming and
[1:15:55] people will bow people will face that
[1:15:58] but you ain't got to be fearful you
[1:16:00] don't have to be afraid because you
[1:16:02] already have provided way that he has
[1:16:05] made to escape that judgment and oh God
[1:16:08] is's so good isn't he aren't you
[1:16:10] thankful today that God made a way of
[1:16:12] Escape amen I think it's time to
[1:16:14] appreciate what God has
[1:16:17] done and how man he makes a way praise
[1:16:20] be to God one of the first things I got
[1:16:22] to thinking about amen was that how that
[1:16:25] the roads are washed
[1:16:27] out amen how many where there used to be
[1:16:31] a road now there's not a road and he
[1:16:33] says man that young man said man we used
[1:16:34] to take a car and just be able to drive
[1:16:36] here and even the four-wheel four-wheel
[1:16:39] drive four-wheelers can get only so far
[1:16:41] they can't even get through there
[1:16:42] anymore amen how nice it would be to be
[1:16:45] able to just take your car and cruise
[1:16:47] right over to the city where you want to
[1:16:48] be how many knows and I got to thinking
[1:16:51] about how that there's a road that God
[1:16:53] has a road and brother bam said our
[1:16:56] forefathers paved the way they removed
[1:16:59] all the stumps they got removed the
[1:17:02] trees and made to pass even this path of
[1:17:04] 6880 probably at one time with nothing
[1:17:07] but a dirt road with a bunch of wagon
[1:17:09] wheels and and and wagons and so forth
[1:17:11] going back and forth you know and they
[1:17:12] had to clear this and clear that amen
[1:17:14] and I want you to understand that our
[1:17:16] father for Luther Wesley amen Pentecost
[1:17:19] the prophet of God came amen I want to
[1:17:21] say it might have been gravel yet in
[1:17:23] Luther's time but I want you to know
[1:17:24] that in this hour we've got a paved Road
[1:17:28] amen it is smooth it is clear it is
[1:17:30] without doubt amen a road that you can
[1:17:33] travel on without any fear or Scare
[1:17:35] Jesus Christ came and proved it and
[1:17:37] Vindicated the word of God you're living
[1:17:40] and walking on the path of a Vindicated
[1:17:43] word wo I don't know about you but I
[1:17:46] like that better than hobbling over
[1:17:48] rocks and saying well you got to be
[1:17:49] homies you got to be menite you got to
[1:17:51] do this you got to speak in tongues and
[1:17:53] I'm not sure about this I'm not on just
[1:17:55] fall over all kinds of rocks trying to
[1:17:57] get through there but you ain't got to
[1:17:59] be that way
[1:18:03] anymore amen aren't you glad for a
[1:18:05] smooth
[1:18:06] Road a clear
[1:18:09] Road amen all the doubts have been
[1:18:13] removed what's
[1:18:15] right which road should you
[1:18:18] take
[1:18:21] M
[1:18:23] amen praise the Lord
[1:18:25] think about that how many knows that God
[1:18:27] even the Pope's religion the Pope's
[1:18:30] Doctrine is you know amen all of these
[1:18:32] roads lead us to
[1:18:35] God all these different religions why do
[1:18:38] you think he has a has all of those
[1:18:40] western or these Eastern people and
[1:18:42] Muslims and different ones around him
[1:18:43] and all those priests around them they
[1:18:45] all join up with him they're going to
[1:18:47] find out one of these days the roads
[1:18:49] washed out Tommy amen when they get to
[1:18:52] the end they'll realize their religion
[1:18:54] and Road didn't get them nowhere they
[1:18:57] were on the wrong
[1:18:59] path amen and they'll find out when it's
[1:19:02] too
[1:19:04] late you'll find out it doesn't work cuz
[1:19:07] Jesus said I am the way I am the truth I
[1:19:11] am the life no man comes to the God Amen
[1:19:14] to the father but by me how many
[1:19:17] believes Jesus is the way amen it even
[1:19:20] it ain't this church it ain't what we
[1:19:22] amen you know it's not us as a colletive
[1:19:24] group group it's Jesus that's the
[1:19:28] way even brother bam said about the
[1:19:30] Tabernacle amen they're as bad as any of
[1:19:33] them
[1:19:35] wow but he said he pointed you to Jesus
[1:19:38] cuz that's the
[1:19:40] way amen are you glad for a way that is
[1:19:43] absolutely without
[1:19:46] question it's not the Amish Amish men
[1:19:48] night Pentecostal Baptist Presbyterian
[1:19:50] that's not the way Christ is the way
[1:19:53] Jesus is the
[1:19:56] way
[1:19:58] amen praise the
[1:20:01] Lord
[1:20:03] amen they found out
[1:20:05] that those
[1:20:07] places that they built their buildings
[1:20:10] at built the roads on didn't hold
[1:20:14] up buildings didn't hold
[1:20:17] up amen maybe close to a
[1:20:21] river North Carolina I can't help but
[1:20:24] maybe they didn't have very strict codes
[1:20:26] if you're like us in
[1:20:28] Kentucky amen I like I kind of like no
[1:20:30] codes as far as in the natural you know
[1:20:32] let me do my own wiring my own plumbing
[1:20:34] and you know let me grab my big old uh
[1:20:37] my shed with the with a what is it big
[1:20:40] old cedar posts down in the ground and
[1:20:42] if I just choose to make a house out of
[1:20:44] it I can make a house out of it praise
[1:20:46] God for a little bit of Liberty yet amen
[1:20:49] I thought Bo I'm right at the edge of a
[1:20:50] bluff brother Brad if anything I'm never
[1:20:52] going to flood out
[1:20:56] but I could slide off of there I
[1:20:59] guess amen but you know I got to
[1:21:02] thinking you know and and what what is
[1:21:05] it you know and I thought codes are good
[1:21:08] codes are
[1:21:10] good you know because why they try they
[1:21:13] have these codes especially in Florida
[1:21:16] amen I'll tell you what they got codes
[1:21:18] coming out your ears about right it's
[1:21:20] just about everything you want to
[1:21:22] replace a window you better have a
[1:21:23] permit you know and all kinds of stuff
[1:21:25] like that but you know they want to make
[1:21:27] sure that when you put your Rafters on
[1:21:29] that you got uh you know uh uh hurricane
[1:21:32] straps on them ain't that right put some
[1:21:34] hurricane straps amen because you don't
[1:21:36] want it like my my father-in-law amen
[1:21:38] when the hurricane come through he with
[1:21:40] you know the top plate and the roof was
[1:21:42] just kind of flopping up and
[1:21:44] down that gets a little scary about them
[1:21:46] don't it ain't that right you got a
[1:21:49] little loose amen but codes are to make
[1:21:52] sure that it can withstand what's
[1:21:55] coming wo aren't you glad that God
[1:21:58] builds things to his stand what's
[1:22:03] coming we receive a kingdom that cannot
[1:22:07] be shaken it cannot be
[1:22:10] moved
[1:22:13] amen amen so I want to talk about roads
[1:22:16] Bridges houses amen how even people's
[1:22:20] livelihoods their jobs perhaps got
[1:22:22] washed away and so forth
[1:22:26] but we have a building
[1:22:27] code how many believe we have a building
[1:22:29] code in the
[1:22:31] Bible Amen to build and you know a lot
[1:22:33] of times most of the times I get to
[1:22:36] thinking it's easiest probably down with
[1:22:38] those Hills on the side of the mountains
[1:22:40] so forth who's going to build a big
[1:22:42] Factory up the side of a hill you can't
[1:22:43] do it so down here in this Valley here
[1:22:45] this is a good place to build right the
[1:22:48] easy
[1:22:50] way that's what people like to do people
[1:22:52] like to build where it's easy
[1:22:55] easy I can dress how I want I can act
[1:22:58] what I can do what I want and everything
[1:23:00] else but I'm still a Christian yeah you
[1:23:02] go down that easy Road see what happens
[1:23:05] down the road when the flood comes amen
[1:23:09] and you know the funny part is the funny
[1:23:10] part is that these people no doubt will
[1:23:14] go to building that thing right back
[1:23:16] right up in the same place it
[1:23:22] was well now brother brother what are
[1:23:23] you going to say about about
[1:23:25] that well I'm going to say well guess
[1:23:27] what you do the same thing again and
[1:23:30] something else come through what's going
[1:23:31] to happen
[1:23:33] again
[1:23:35] yeah can't do the same thing expect
[1:23:38] different results I guess unless you
[1:23:39] pour
[1:23:41] concrete a bunch of concrete use a bunch
[1:23:44] of Steel so that guess what even after
[1:23:46] the flood goes over top through and
[1:23:48] under it'll still be standing you better
[1:23:49] build some kind of a
[1:23:51] building amen here's our
[1:23:55] code here's our building
[1:23:58] amen
[1:24:00] listen therefore whosoever heareth these
[1:24:03] sayings of mine and doth them I will
[1:24:05] liken them unto a wise man which built
[1:24:09] his house upon a
[1:24:11] rock
[1:24:13] woo Glory can you imagine

[1:31:15] here that's why it's still going
[1:31:19] on got long
[1:31:22] suffering why
[1:31:24] so that
[1:31:25] people people might appreciate the path
[1:31:31] and the way that he has
[1:31:32] made the road that he has
[1:31:36] paved so that we could get to God so
[1:31:40] that we could walk on his path and he
[1:31:43] yells
[1:31:43] screams preaches all the time not your
[1:31:47] way but my way come my way come by acts
[1:31:52] 238 to walk way is the way today buried
[1:31:56] in the precious name of Jesus Amen dig
[1:31:59] deep no way down amen and hit that Solid
[1:32:04] Rock the water way is the way today in
[1:32:07] the name of Jesus Christ that's where
[1:32:08] you get your anchor that's why you hit
[1:32:11] that Rock
[1:32:13] Amen oh my praise the Lord Proverbs says
[1:32:18] it that this way listen when I called
[1:32:22] you refused I stretched out my hand and
[1:32:25] no man
[1:32:26] regarded how many knows there's warning
[1:32:29] and then there's
[1:32:33] judgment there's warning there's an
[1:32:35] oncoming storm like that man in Florida
[1:32:38] that would not listen to the message hey
[1:32:40] there's a typhoon coming there's a storm
[1:32:43] coming get to shelter get to safety
[1:32:46] isn't that what the preachers ought to
[1:32:47] be screaming today amen get to safety
[1:32:50] there's a storm coming there's judgment
[1:32:53] coming God going to burn all that is
[1:32:55] evil all the Sinners are going to be
[1:32:57] burnt out of it but there's a refuge in
[1:33:01] the time of
[1:33:02] storm and that Refuge is Jesus Christ
[1:33:05] the Holy
[1:33:08] Spirit stretches out his hand come the
[1:33:11] neighbor went to him said no men your
[1:33:14] wife your children they at least let
[1:33:16] them come he said no I'm the man of the
[1:33:19] house and they'll obey
[1:33:20] me he got swept away they never did find
[1:33:23] him found his wife and children bit by
[1:33:25] moccasins and so forth up on the roof of
[1:33:27] a house
[1:33:29] dead
[1:33:31] amen
[1:33:32] my because he would not
[1:33:37] listen amen let me just say this while
[1:33:39] it comes to my mind how manyan know the
[1:33:42] Bible says that we are to fall upon the
[1:33:44] rock and let it crush us let it break us
[1:33:48] fall upon the rock let it break you cuz
[1:33:51] if you don't according to Revelations
[1:33:53] you're going to call amen you're
[1:33:55] eventually you're going to have be
[1:33:56] calling on the rocks and the hills to
[1:33:58] fall on you and to hide you from the
[1:34:01] face of the amen that one that sits on
[1:34:03] the throne because why because that rock
[1:34:06] that's hued out of a mountain is coming
[1:34:08] and those who have not fallen on the
[1:34:11] Rock he is going to grind them to powder
[1:34:14] does it
[1:34:16] say grind them to powder
[1:34:25] people don't want to see the mercy and
[1:34:27] kindness and the love and the
[1:34:29] sweetness and the forgiveness and the
[1:34:32] grace of God they don't want
[1:34:36] that so I wonder how they'll like it
[1:34:39] when fire proceeds out of his
[1:34:41] eyes when he comes an Angry
[1:34:48] God I called and I called I stretched
[1:34:52] out and I stretched out I pleaded I
[1:34:56] begged I did everything I could to get
[1:34:59] you
[1:34:59] in but you would
[1:35:02] not now you're going to have the fruit
[1:35:05] of your own ways
[1:35:08] amen I called you refus you I stretched
[1:35:12] out my hand no man regarded it you said
[1:35:15] it not all my counil would none of my
[1:35:19] reproof
[1:35:20] amen sometimes when you listen to the
[1:35:22] prophet of God it sounds sounds like
[1:35:24] mostly
[1:35:25] reproof but man them preachers come and
[1:35:27] says can't you get on something else
[1:35:29] besides the women's hair and and clothes
[1:35:31] and this that or the other can't you get
[1:35:32] on something else teach them deep things
[1:35:35] why because he was always telling them
[1:35:37] about these things why why did he do
[1:35:40] that because he knew that if they didn't
[1:35:43] have the Holy Ghost that desire would
[1:35:44] take over and that's the way they dress
[1:35:46] and if they would have the Holy Ghost
[1:35:47] they dress
[1:35:48] right
[1:35:50] amen they drew right they act right they
[1:35:53] wipe that stuff off of their face they
[1:35:56] look Godly instead of ungodly like
[1:35:58] something
[1:36:00] artificial always rebuking the churches
[1:36:03] preaching the indictment indicting all
[1:36:06] this generations of preachers for the
[1:36:08] second crucifixion of Jesus
[1:36:10] Christ do they listen did they listen
[1:36:13] did they listen to the indictment did
[1:36:16] they believe the indictment
[1:36:18] no or they to repent it said God forgive
[1:36:22] me
[1:36:24] you know brother Brad there's a lot of
[1:36:26] book a lot of those in the book of Acts
[1:36:27] when Peter was preaching them you with
[1:36:29] Wicked hands have taken and crucified
[1:36:31] him ain't that right and then it says
[1:36:34] they were pricked in their heart and
[1:36:35] said men what must we do the very ones
[1:36:37] that some of them that crucified him
[1:36:40] repented but this generation of
[1:36:42] Pentecostals and Baptist and Methodist
[1:36:44] am mean did they repent no even though
[1:36:47] Jesus would come down and vindicate that
[1:36:50] the prophet was preaching the truth
[1:36:51] there's nothing left even brother Braham
[1:36:53] said how can you preach anything but
[1:36:56] judgment when mercy has been
[1:37:00] spurned amen let me tell you something

[1:40:44] Mercy amen because there's a lot of
[1:40:47] people down there right now wishing boy

[1:40:51] brush my teeth I wish I had a closet to
[1:40:54] go in and get my clothes I wish I had
[1:40:57] shoes I would have had had a drink of
[1:40:59] water it'd be nice to have
[1:41:01] power it'd be nice to have a little bit
[1:41:04] of power around here maybe I could cut
[1:41:05] some of these trees down or or or do
[1:41:07] some sawing but there's no power there's
[1:41:09] nothing it's all swept
[1:41:11] away all they can say I remember I
[1:41:14] remember I had it so nice that was so
[1:41:16] comfortable it was so nice it was so
[1:41:18] beautiful coming out and watching that
[1:41:20] Lake and that River go behind me and
[1:41:21] this that in the other now now it's all
[1:41:25] gone
[1:41:29] amen and they probably think back and
[1:41:32] realize they didn't appreciate it maybe
[1:41:33] as much as what they should
[1:41:35] have amen it's about
[1:41:38] appreciation an attitude of gratitude
[1:41:40] appreciation it make me think about it
[1:41:43] everything that we have we ought to be
[1:41:46] appreciative of
[1:41:48] it everything in everything be thankful
[1:41:54] be thankful in
[1:41:56] everything and we know that it doesn't
[1:41:59] matter what kind of house you build
[1:42:01] doesn't matter if it's made you know of
[1:42:03] concrete I don't care if you go way down
[1:42:05] in the ground way deep build a bunker
[1:42:07] brother Bram says the percussion of
[1:42:09] those things will go 150 foot down and
[1:42:12] just a sheer impact of that thing that
[1:42:14] kill you down there like a rat so
[1:42:15] there's no building no shelter here for
[1:42:17] what's coming you've get built this
[1:42:20] right here our shelter is in the under
[1:42:23] his wings we have feathers we're under
[1:42:26] the feathers under the wings of the lord
[1:42:28] it's where our safety is amen you don't
[1:42:33] have to fear when destruction and those
[1:42:35] things come you don't have to be afraid
[1:42:38] why because you're built upon a Rock
[1:42:40] Amen Paul lived in such a place he lived
[1:42:44] in such a placees I have learned that in
[1:42:46] whatever state I am to be thankful or to
[1:42:49] be content thank you Lord why because he
[1:42:53] had built his house upon a Rock Amen how
[1:42:57] many believes great gratitude
[1:42:59] gratefulness goes a long way with God
[1:43:01] because in the first place one of the
[1:43:03] sins the big sin in heaven was is that
[1:43:06] the devil wasn't content the devil
[1:43:07] wasn't satisfied the devil didn't
[1:43:09] appreciate what he
[1:43:13] had
[1:43:15] amen and that's when we
[1:43:17] gripe that's when we complain it's when
[1:43:20] we don't appreciate what you already
[1:43:21] have
[1:43:23] amen praise the
[1:43:25] Lord all
[1:43:29] right worldwind an anguish cometh upon
[1:43:32] you then shall they call upon me amen
[1:43:39] they'll call upon me but I will not
[1:43:43] answer they'll seek me
[1:43:46] early but they shall not find me
[1:43:52] amen there's a road that leads to god
[1:43:55] let's talk about a bridge here we're
[1:43:57] going to go that was the last subject
[1:43:58] but we're going to jump over to that
[1:44:00] because it's kind of where I want to be
[1:44:03] Bridges were washed out is that right
[1:44:07] the entire bridge going gone come to the
[1:44:10] edge of there boy I'll tell you what I
[1:44:12] remember today we just drive right
[1:44:14] across here look at the water flowing
[1:44:16] now it's gone now we can't get
[1:44:18] across that represents Mercy being over
[1:44:23] cuz how many knows that as long as that
[1:44:26] blood that bridge of the blood is around
[1:44:29] the earth God won't destroy the Earth
[1:44:31] but one day that bridge is going to be
[1:44:36] gone then you can call all you want to
[1:44:39] amen because Jesus was that bridge that
[1:44:41] God built ain't that right Jesus was the
[1:44:44] bridge like Sydney Bridge brother brah
[1:44:46] talked about that man he that engineer
[1:44:48] every nut had to be tested every bolt
[1:44:51] everything had to be tested and Jesus
[1:44:52] was tempted and tested in every points
[1:44:55] like what you and I are yet without sin
[1:44:57] he was proven amen and he built a bridge
[1:45:00] so that men and God can be
[1:45:03] reunited amen I think it's time to
[1:45:06] appreciate the bridge that God has built
[1:45:08] for Humanity so we can back have
[1:45:11] fellowship with him
[1:45:14] again cuz that bridge will be taken away
[1:45:16] one of these days when he steps off The
[1:45:19] Mercy Seat and then no matter how much
[1:45:21] you want to try amen St at one side no
[1:45:24] help us we want to get across you'll
[1:45:26] call you'll seek but there won't be
[1:45:28] nothing
[1:45:29] there they'll call but I will not answer
[1:45:33] they'll seek me
[1:45:34] early but they won't find
[1:45:38] me why they didn't
[1:45:41] appreciate what they had how manyan
[1:45:44] believe we still have that you fall
[1:45:47] short as a Christian you still got the
[1:45:49] blood you get on your knees and say God
[1:45:50] forgive me amen how many's glad that
[1:45:54] that bridge is still there for
[1:45:56] us amen and they God tries his best for
[1:46:01] people to come across that bridge I Love
[1:46:04] the Way Jesus was tested he proved this
[1:46:06] bridge built it all the way
[1:46:09] across Jesus Built it all the way he
[1:46:12] went plumped down into hell death and
[1:46:15] the
[1:46:16] grave went into hell come back up went
[1:46:20] Plum up into heaven and anchored it up
[1:46:23] there a that right he anchored it on
[1:46:26] acts 238 Acts 2 he came back amen and
[1:46:29] said come on y'all the bridge will hold
[1:46:32] this bridge is built come unto me all ye
[1:46:35] who are weary and heavy laden I will
[1:46:37] give rest for your
