[29:15] just getting into the word here and in
[29:16] and into the message I want to read you
[29:18] this I want to speak tonight on
[29:20] Prosperity Prosperity that's a good
[29:23] thought on the first day of the year
[29:25] Prosperity now listen to what the
[29:27] prophet says he says now I'm sure that
[29:29] people doesn't come and stand up and jam
[29:31] in into the churches just to be seen he
[29:35] said you come because you love him he
[29:37] said and I am trusting that God will
[29:40] send you away tonight not empty he never
[29:43] sends anyone empty who comes to him and
[29:47] he will send you away with a full Heart
[29:50] Of Joy lightf footed and going down the
[29:53] street rejoicing and praising God As you
[29:56] move along he said now that can be done
[30:00] listen now that can be done if we take
[30:03] our right attitude towards him if we
[30:08] come to see him if we come and love him
[30:12] and we come to worship him then God is
[30:16] obligated to give us them things which
[30:20] we
[30:22] desire he didn't say the things that he
[30:24] desires or the things that your neighbor
[30:26] would like or the things your wife wants
[30:28] wants praise the Lord but he said the
[30:30] things that we desire you desire if you
[30:34] come with the right attitude if you come
[30:36] with with love and you come to worship
[30:38] him and you come to see him he's
[30:40] obligated to give the things which you
[30:42] desire he says and he will withhold no
[30:47] let's do zero no good
[30:50] thing from them that walk upright before
[30:53] him just remember that his promise if ye
[30:55] abide in me and my words abide in you
[30:57] and you ask what you will and it shall
[30:59] be given unto you what a promise
[31:03] unfailing
[31:04] promise so look if we stick with
[31:08] God if we stick with worship if we stick
[31:12] with love if we stick with giving of him
[31:14] all that we have we can stand on an an
[31:18] an unfailing promise that he's obligated
[31:21] to meet your not only your need but your
[31:24] every
[31:26] desire brother and sisters that's the
[31:28] infall infallibility of the word of God
[31:32] that's why the word of God is the
[31:35] truth that's why the word we can stand
[31:37] on the truth of the word of God you know
[31:39] there's a difference between true and
[31:41] truth I learned this week I can say a
[31:43] true statement it's 23 degrees outside
[31:47] that's a true statement but that doesn't
[31:48] make it truth because tomorrow it might
[31:50] be 46
[31:52] degrees but this doesn't
[31:55] waver this doesn't change
[31:58] this is the truth and it's the in
[32:00] infallible word of God he
[32:04] said if the people can ever get in a
[32:07] place that their faith is
[32:09] centered listen to this if their faith
[32:12] is
[32:13] centered not upon present
[32:17] situations oh we've had some present
[32:21] situations how many's ever been
[32:22] discouraged how many's ever been
[32:24] depressed how many's ever been let down
[32:27] how many's ever have been disgusted with
[32:29] the way life is going and you say I
[32:30] don't know about this present
[32:35] situation if you can stay
[32:39] centered Faithfully centered not upon
[32:42] the present situations but what on but
[32:44] what upon what God has said about it and
[32:47] if you can remember that no matter what
[32:50] comes or goes or how impossible it may
[32:53] seem sometimes life looks
[32:55] impossible things look challenging and
[32:58] how will we ever get through it but if
[32:59] you can just remember that no matter
[33:01] what comes and goes and how impossible
[33:03] it is yet God's word will take its place
[33:07] every time so you're telling me if my
[33:10] faith is
[33:11] centered on
[33:14] healing and the word of God says that by
[33:17] his stripes I am healed and I stay
[33:20] Faithfully centered in that word God is
[33:24] obligated to the for the word of God to
[33:26] take his place and say that's my child
[33:28] and he's healed
[33:32] today you see he says in the face of
[33:35] every difficult nothing nothing can take
[33:38] its place it has preeminence because
[33:40] there is none other than God himself in
[33:43] the spoken word and it has to come to
[33:47] pass you can't stop it I can't stop it
[33:51] the pope can't stop it if God said it
[33:55] it's got to come to pass and what we
[33:57] have to get to a place as Believers that
[34:00] we believe those things that we believe
[34:03] in the
[34:05] word all my days he says I have tried
[34:08] solemnly to keep the people on the word
[34:11] of
[34:13] God I tried solemnly to keep the people
[34:16] on the word of
[34:17] God he says and that was his promise to

[34:30] simple you mean prosperity in 2025 is
[34:34] that simple that if we just keep God
[34:37] first and we keep on the word of God and

[34:42] we're bound to be blessed we're bound to
[34:44] prosper we're bound to grow we're bound
[34:45] to have success we're bound to thrive

[34:51] the word says I'm not making this up but
[34:54] somebody has to believe this
[34:59] but the word he says the work of the
[35:02] Lord should grow he said but that the
[35:04] word that I must be sure that the word
[35:07] was first in
[35:10] everything and he said I tried to keep
[35:13] humble I don't mean to keep you standing
[35:14] but stay with me I tried to keep he said
[35:17] I Tred to keep myself humble keep down

[37:12] hearts because we are needy people
[37:14] tonight we love you Lord in Jesus name
[37:17] amen you can have your
[37:19] seats so naturally when I think of the
[37:23] word or I say the word Prosper what's
[37:25] the first thing that pops into your mind
[37:28] thank you brother Tommy somebody was
[37:30] paying attention money we automatically
[37:34] we think Prosper we think of money we
[37:37] think of wealth we think of riches we
[37:40] think of success in our businesses and
[37:42] and and that is all Prosperity but I
[37:45] want you to notice that there is so much
[37:47] more to that word than just money and
[37:49] wealth and riches listen to what the
[37:51] word says the thief cometh not but for
[37:54] to steal to kill and to destroy
[37:58] now to to what is he coming for what is
[38:00] this thief coming for when he comes he
[38:02] don't come and knock on the door and say
[38:03] hey I've got a package for you no he's a
[38:06] thief he's coming in in in hiding he's
[38:09] coming uh uh in seclusion of the night
[38:11] and he comes in and he looks at you and
[38:13] he says I'm going to take away all the
[38:15] things that God has given you so in 2025
[38:20] it's the devil's goal it's his mission
[38:22] to take away your happiness it's his
[38:26] mission to take away your love love your
[38:28] joy now listen your commitment to the
[38:32] word he's here to take away to to steal
[38:35] and grab away your prayer
[38:39] life how powerless would you be without
[38:42] a prayer life so he looks and he says
[38:45] I'm going to take their prayer life I'm
[38:47] going to take their concern for others
[38:49] their empathy their
[38:52] compassion I'm going to take away all
[38:55] these things that God has given them I
[38:57] might just take his health I might take
[39:00] his desire to serve
[39:03] others I might take his commitment or
[39:05] her commitment to the local body to the
[39:08] church you say well how could he do that
[39:10] he puts a desire in your heart to stay
[39:12] home instead of be at
[39:14] church he's taking you away from your
[39:16] commitment to the local body the word
[39:18] says forsake not the assembling of
[39:20] yourselves as the day grows near and
[39:22] what gets me is these churches that are
[39:24] that think they don't have to go to
[39:25] church I heard stories this week that
[39:27] blew my mind I'm thinking why do these
[39:29] people think they don't need to go to
[39:31] church why do they think it's okay to
[39:33] stay home and not listen to the
[39:35] preaching of the word the moving of the
[39:37] Holy Spirit through man the way God
[39:40] intended
[39:41] it somebody help me
[39:45] preach I find it
[39:51] foolish so why is Satan so consumed on
[39:55] taking these things from you
[39:59] John why is he so consumed and taking
[40:01] your prayer life your concern for others
[40:03] what is it that makes him so have such a
[40:05] desire that he says I got to have what
[40:07] they got and take it so they don't have
[40:10] it I tell you what it is it's because he
[40:13] knows that if he can take these things
[40:15] from you you will no longer be able to
[40:19] serve
[40:22] others if he could take these things
[40:25] from you you will lose your power
[40:28] if he could take these things from you
[40:30] you will no longer to be able to live a
[40:32] Christian
[40:33] Life if he takes these things from you
[40:37] you will no longer be an example to
[40:39] those who need
[40:40] him do you see where this is going if he
[40:43] takes these from you it changes your
[40:45] whole makeup you can no longer have your
[40:48] life on the display for the world to
[40:53] see so by taking these things out of
[40:55] your life what is he
[41:00] doing he comes to
[41:02] steal to kill and destroy so when he
[41:06] takes these what is he what is he doing
[41:08] ultimately what he's doing is he's
[41:09] taking you a child of God who God looks
[41:14] down on and God depends upon and he's
[41:17] taking you out of
[41:20] position it says look at this child of
[41:22] God now we move him over here
[41:29] is somebody hearing me this is what his
[41:32] goal is in 2025 so if you can't be Jesus
[41:36] to the lost and Dying World let me ask
[41:38] you who
[41:39] will if if if you can't be the light in
[41:42] a Land of chaos and darkness who
[41:46] will do you see how important this
[41:49] is if he can take these things from you
[41:52] and now you're out of your position what
[41:54] did the prophet say if you can have your
[41:56] faith
[41:58] centered oh we you didn't forget that
[42:00] quote did you you didn't forget what we
[42:03] started with did you but if you could
[42:05] keep your faith
[42:06] centered but now Satan says oh I'll take
[42:09] this child of God and I put him over
[42:10] here now his world is out of
[42:13] control now his world we've just tipped
[42:16] him on his axis and the world that he
[42:18] once knew that he loved and was so
[42:20] comfortable in and the world of all the
[42:22] blessings and the world of of God moving
[42:24] on the scene and answering his prayers
[42:26] and worship and and feeling loved and
[42:30] joy now he's in
[42:33] despair
[42:35] woo I've
[42:38] stolen what God has given him and
[42:41] because I've stolen what God has given
[42:44] him I've now killed his
[42:49] influence I've killed his influence I've
[42:52] killed his influence to a world who is
[42:55] thirsty he's no no longer this man or
[42:58] woman this child son and daughter of God
[43:00] is no longer thirsty or no longer
[43:04] salty they're no longer a Savor to the
[43:07] world who is seeking let me tell you
[43:09] there are people who are seeking God
[43:11] today they're trying to find
[43:17] answers who will be Jesus
[43:21] today we have a responsibility as
[43:24] Christians in our lives in this hour
[43:27] the word tells us go the going
[43:29] throughout the world preaching the
[43:31] gospel you say well I Don't Preach you
[43:33] live don't
[43:34] you if you're living if you're a
[43:36] Believer you better be preaching every
[43:38] footstep you take every word you speak
[43:40] every song you sing better be preaching
[43:42] to
[43:47] somebody so you see if
[43:49] Satan if Satan could take away the Life
[43:52] of Christ in your heart today if he
[43:55] could come in and he could take away The
[43:57] Life of Christ in your heart and the
[43:59] Holy Ghost was
[44:00] robbed from your
[44:03] spirit brothers and sisters it would
[44:06] destroy
[44:08] you do you realize that do you realize
[44:11] the severity of this
[44:13] scripture this is his
[44:15] mission it started in the heavens and in
[44:18] the garden and here we see it today he
[44:20] comes to kill to steal kill and destroy
[44:24] because if you lose your influence you
[44:26] lose Lo your credibility you lose your
[44:28] joy in the Lord you lose your happiness
[44:32] do you see how it just keeps compounding
[44:34] it's like a Snowball Effect and you
[44:37] would lose your joy you lose your
[44:38] compassion you lose your patience and I
[44:40] promise you will lose your
[44:46] temper because when that little Dove
[44:48] flies
[44:50] away there's a nature
[44:54] change child of God
[44:58] nature
[45:04] change but aren't you thankful tonight
[45:06] that the word never leaves us
[45:08] hanging you know I I told Brother David
[45:10] he I heard him call for me man I was
[45:12] going through notes I was praying back
[45:13] there and I heard him call for me I was
[45:15] going through notes and I was praying I
[45:17] was highlighting and marking and saying
[45:19] God help us step on the step on the
[45:21] scene tonight
[45:22] God and brother Brad would come out I
[45:25] said buddy I'm sorry I left you hanging
[45:28] he said that's okay but let me tell you
[45:29] God don't leave us hanging the word of
[45:32] God never leaves us
[45:36] hanging the word of God never leaves us
[45:38] in
[45:39] despair there's never a time in the
[45:42] Bible that that that you you don't have
[45:44] to feel
[45:46] hopeless there is no reason to have
[45:48] despair the word leaves us not in desert
[45:52] places now you know you may have to walk
[45:54] through some valleys you may find
[45:56] yourself in a
[45:58] desert but you know when you walk
[46:00] through that Valley the good thing about
[46:01] it it takes two mountains to make a
[46:04] valley I'm going to get on top of one of
[46:06] them mountains I'm not staying in that
[46:09] Valley forever but I'm going to find
[46:11] myself in a higher Place why because
[46:13] there's something on the inside that
[46:14] says I'm a child of God and I can't live
[46:17] down here and dwell down here in the
[46:19] bottoms I Prosper on top of the
[46:24] mountain the word never gives up on us
[46:28] the word has power do you realize how
[46:32] powerful the word is just that the
[46:34] spoken word deaf ears are open blind
[46:38] eyes can see at the speak of the word
[46:41] dead people are Ro Rose back to
[46:44] life at the spoken word sickness has to
[46:48] flee do you realize that at the spoken

[47:11] into the world into drugs and alcohol
[47:13] and things that they that you think they
[47:15] would never get out of it because it had
[47:17] such a death grip on them and they come
[47:19] back say I can't do it

[47:31] anymore that's a god of
[47:37] prosperity in the word of God I promise
[47:39] you will
[47:43] prosper if you don't believe
[47:46] me stop listening to
[47:50] yourself I said stop listening to
[47:52] yourself and start talking to
[47:55] yourself you say What's the difference
[47:56] difference well when you listen to
[47:57] yourself you hear all the negativity

[48:03] all your fears well I can't do this
[48:06] because or I I I doubt that this can
[48:10] happen I doubt that God can heal me I I
[48:14] I doubt that this can happen I I I have
[48:16] so much fear I don't
[48:21] believe some of you walked there before
[48:24] I've listened to myself way too many
[48:27] times and whenever I would listen to
[48:30] myself I found myself in the wowy Woos
[48:32] as brother juel would say poor pitiful
[48:35] me I can't make it I can't do it God
[48:39] said I can't do it God said my children

[48:43] or that or the other you you've been
[48:44] there you've heard those
[48:47] voices stop listening to
[48:50] those and start talking to yourself
[48:53] because your mind brothers and sisters
[48:55] will come up with all kind kinds of
[48:57] excuses not to be who God positioned you
[49:01] to
[49:06] be well if I could just sing like sister

[49:10] so I'd be so full of joy I'd sing all
[49:13] the
[49:15] time no you
[49:18] wouldn't because you ain't singing
[49:20] now but the Bible says if you'll make a
[49:23] Joyful Noise unto the Lord you don't
[49:25] have to sing like a canary but it says
[49:29] Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord do you
[49:32] see how you listen to these excuses and
[49:35] and you allow Satan to rob you of
[49:37] worship come on

[49:47] him prospering if I could have a
[49:49] business like that people would see how
[49:51] God has blessed me I'd have so much
[49:53] money to give I could give to this cause
[49:55] and this this missionary and this person
[49:58] and to the needy no you
[50:01] wouldn't you say man you're
[50:05] hard and he looked up and saw the rich
[50:08] man casting their gifts into the
[50:10] treasury and he saw a certain poor Widow
[50:13] casting in thither two
[50:17] mites a fraction of a penny two mites
[50:22] come on
[50:23] Church a fraction of a penny
[50:28] and well you say well that's listen to

[51:01] little bit of

[51:54] do yeah you're twisting the word to say

[58:04] [Applause]
[58:10] prospering abundant life teaches
[58:12] teachings that God is a good god who
[58:15] wants to bless people spiritually
[58:16] physically economically and it was
[58:19] championed by Oral Roberts in the United
[58:22] States after World War II that's where I
[58:24] heard it you ever heard of Oral Roberts
[58:28] yep Oral Roberts University he had he he
[58:31] he kind of coined this term Abundant
[58:33] Life that was the name of his of his
[58:34] ministry Abundant Life television
[58:37] Abundant Life Magazine Abundant Life
[58:39] prayer group Abundant Life
[58:42] building that was his
[58:45] brand why because he knew what God could
[58:50] do he had a healing campaign
[58:53] too he had a Ministry too and so he look
[58:56] and he coined this and he said this is
[58:58] an abundant life living the life of
[59:01] Christ so what is what is
[59:06] life I know this is
[59:10] Elementary what is
[59:12] life the Bible says that life is a gift
[59:17] from
[59:19] God that God is the author of life that
[59:22] God gives life that God determines the
[59:24] length of your life
[59:26] and it goes on to say that he can
[59:28] Restore Life to the dead let me ask you
[59:31] this what are you going to ask Lazareth
[59:33] on that day did you live a prosperous
[59:35] life you better believe it
[59:41] twice why because God was a God In
[59:44] Action God was a God in a move God was
[59:47] moving on the scene and said hey
[59:49] Lazareth come forth let me show you an
[59:52] abundant life there's more for you in
[59:54] this life
[59:56] the Bible says that in life is is a
[59:59] vital principle that causes things to
[1:00:01] move and grow and reproduce What did the
[1:00:04] word say to Adam and Eve What did the
[1:00:06] what did God say what did the word say
[1:00:07] to Adam and Eve be fruitful multiply
[1:00:11] replenish that's
[1:00:13] life that is life when you see those
[1:00:16] things growing around you the life is a
[1:00:19] period of time in the scriptures the
[1:00:22] spiritual life is a is a place that
[1:00:24] death there is no death to the believer
[1:00:26] that is a spiritual life that when we
[1:00:29] die we step from this Dimension into
[1:00:31] another dimension we never quit
[1:00:36] living you talk about
[1:00:38] prospering you talk about
[1:00:44] prospering that's
[1:00:48] life so the
[1:00:51] prosperity when we talk about
[1:00:54] Prosper Prosperity is the lifestyle of a
[1:00:57] Believer so if you live a life of
[1:01:00] prosperity you no doubt have been
[1:01:02] successful at
[1:01:04] something right when you look up the
[1:01:07] word Prosper the word Prosper means to
[1:01:10] become
[1:01:11] strong
[1:01:13] flourishing
[1:01:14] success or
[1:01:18] thriving so we know when we look at
[1:01:20] Prosperity people prosper in different
[1:01:22] ways we talked about money so
[1:01:24] financially people can prosper Prosper
[1:01:27] we got to have Financial stability you
[1:01:29] can prosper in your health you can
[1:01:31] prosper in relationships in your career
[1:01:33] in your personal growth in your
[1:01:35] community you can prosper in all these
[1:01:37] things so in 2025 you've got a big table
[1:01:40] spread before you so I ask you what are
[1:01:42] you going to prosper
[1:01:44] in because if you if you're looking at
[1:01:46] Financial it means you're going to have
[1:01:48] a significant income to meet the needs
[1:01:50] and financial goals that you have if you
[1:01:53] got health and prosperity and health
[1:01:55] you're going to maintain good physical
[1:01:57] and mental health if you're going to
[1:01:59] prosper in your relationships you're
[1:02:00] going to build good relationships and
[1:02:02] you're going to fulfill commitments you
[1:02:04] make to
[1:02:05] others if you got prosperity in your
[1:02:08] career you're going to give yourself to
[1:02:10] your personal life your professional
[1:02:12] life and career to see it
[1:02:16] grow but what more than any of these
[1:02:18] things do we
[1:02:21] need we need to prosper more in God
[1:02:26] so when I think about prosperity in
[1:02:29] 2025 we all want to do good we all want
[1:02:32] our homes go we all want money we we
[1:02:34] need those things
[1:02:36] right how many likes
[1:02:41] money how many of you is going to quit
[1:02:43] lying in
[1:02:46] 2025 let me ask you again how many of
[1:02:48] you like
[1:02:49] money
[1:02:51] sure God wants you to be blessed in
[1:02:53] those areas don't think he don't
[1:02:56] that's right let me ask you another
[1:02:58] question how many knows Abraham was
[1:03:00] rich nope you're wrong Abraham was very
[1:03:06] rich he said he was very rich in s
[1:03:09] cattle silver and gold so don't think
[1:03:11] that God don't care about your financial
[1:03:13] situation because he
[1:03:15] does but keep God
[1:03:21] first but what I want I want my life to
[1:03:24] prosper and the things of God I want my
[1:03:27] prayer life to
[1:03:29] prosper you see when I go and get down
[1:03:32] and I begin to pray before God I want to
[1:03:34] know that somebody's hearing me I don't
[1:03:37] want to go to pray to God and feel like
[1:03:39] I'm praying into a
[1:03:40] void but I want that relationship
[1:03:43] between me and God to begin to
[1:03:45] communicate and to begin to prosper to
[1:03:47] when I say my
[1:03:49] Lord I have a need I have a
[1:03:53] situation I have a desire
[1:03:56] and he say my son what is your
[1:03:58] desire this ain't no Genie in a
[1:04:01] Bottle now this is what we call a
[1:04:04] relationship this is what I want my
[1:04:06] prayer life to be a
[1:04:09] relationship I want to my My Worship to

[1:06:29] even believe that they're going to
[1:06:32] come when I witness and when I talk to
[1:06:35] people and when I live the life before

[1:07:08] uh some of you there through a you kind
[1:07:10] of oh was he fixing you try to throw up
[1:07:12] your hand for ask the
[1:07:14] question how many of you ladies like to
[1:07:16] be a more prosperous
[1:07:19] wife hey you ain't got to be embarrassed
[1:07:21] about that that's the way God set it up
[1:07:25] in the Garden of Eden there was Adam and
[1:07:27] Eve and a deep sleep fell upon Adam and
[1:07:31] he was both male and female he created
[1:07:33] he them both male and female and he
[1:07:36] pulled out of his side out of the
[1:07:39] rib a
[1:07:41] helpmate so there's no embarrassment in
[1:07:43] wanting to be a better prosperous
[1:07:49] wife a more prosperous
[1:07:52] father yeah
[1:07:55] man I I feel like I do a lot for my kids
[1:07:57] but I so feel like I fall short so many
[1:08:03] times a more prosperous
[1:08:06] mother sister
[1:08:09] brother you
[1:08:10] see we got to
[1:08:13] prosper so let me ask you
[1:08:17] this time stand
[1:08:21] still let me ask you this tonight what
[1:08:24] are you afraid of
[1:08:26] why are you afraid to prosper or what
[1:08:28] scares you about prospering in 2025
[1:08:30] because there is no reason to fear
[1:08:37] Prosperity if you're in the
[1:08:40] word you're going to prosper if you're
[1:08:43] in the word you're going to thrive if
[1:08:45] you're in the word you're going to get
[1:08:47] stronger if you're in the word you're
[1:08:49] going to
[1:08:51] flourish if you're in the word life is
[1:08:57] good because my Bible tells me he
[1:08:59] created on this day and it was good and
[1:09:03] he created on the second day and it was
[1:09:05] good and he created on the third day and
[1:09:07] it was good and he created on the fourth
[1:09:10] day and it was good and the fifth he was
[1:09:12] good and the sixth it was good but on
[1:09:14] the seventh he
[1:09:16] rested I can rest in the word knowing
[1:09:19] that God is good and prosperity is for
[1:09:23] us so sometimes we might just need a
[1:09:25] little push a little nudge a little
[1:09:27] motivation or maybe just a
[1:09:31] shove get out
[1:09:36] there turn to Deuteronomy real
[1:09:41] quick while you're turning to
[1:09:42] Deuteronomy 32 I'll share a little story
[1:09:45] with
[1:09:46] you so some of you know it some of you
[1:09:49] don't I got scolded for not letting
[1:09:50] everybody know so I started a little
[1:09:53] Consulting business and so I work with
[1:09:55] businessmen I work with companies and
[1:09:57] and corporations and and individuals and
[1:10:00] and and I go in and I talk to them about
[1:10:02] biblical Bible faith-based scripture
[1:10:05] teaching and and and teamwork and
[1:10:08] Leadership setting goals how to
[1:10:10] accomplish goals how to get rid of
[1:10:12] negativity how to build a positive
[1:10:14] environment in in the workplace and in
[1:10:16] the works space and so I started doing
[1:10:19] this and I got this these clients that
[1:10:20] I'm working for and and one of the
[1:10:23] questions one of the first things they
[1:10:24] always ask
[1:10:25] or or they always tell me as I fear I'm
[1:10:27] going to
[1:10:31] fail every seminar I've been to people
[1:10:34] you talk to what is your what's your
[1:10:35] number one fear I'm afraid we're going
[1:10:38] to
[1:10:39] fail but you
[1:10:43] see I got the
[1:10:45] word I've got the word and I begin to
[1:10:49] look at
[1:10:50] this I began to look at this situation
[1:10:52] when they when he when he told me that
[1:10:55] and I had to go speak the other night I
[1:10:57] was I was asked to go to their dinner
[1:10:58] and be a keynote speaker for their
[1:11:00] little Christmas event and so me and my
[1:11:03] wife was invited and we went and I
[1:11:04] thought I got to bring something
[1:11:06] biblical because that's my
[1:11:08] mission I got to bring something
[1:11:10] encouraging because that's my mission I
[1:11:13] got to bring something that'll help them
[1:11:15] because that's my
[1:11:16] mission I got to bring something that
[1:11:18] will that will lead them down the right
[1:11:20] path because that's my
[1:11:22] mission and so I thought well I'm going
[1:11:25] to I'm going to speak out of Deuteronomy
[1:11:28] 32 as an eagle stirreth their nest
[1:11:31] because they're afraid they're going to
[1:11:33] fail are you with me now let me tell you
[1:11:36] don't you take the word of God for
[1:11:39] granted don't you take the message of
[1:11:41] the hour for
[1:11:44] granted I said I want to tell you a
[1:11:47] story about the eagle I want to rehearse
[1:11:49] the story about the eagle to you and I
[1:11:52] said how many of you know the story
[1:12:01] nobody did you are you hearing
[1:12:04] me how many of you can recite the story
[1:12:07] of the
[1:12:08] eagle
[1:12:10] yeah why because you're
[1:12:13] centered in the word of God your life
[1:12:16] your business your home your career your
[1:12:19] family your
[1:12:22] children everything is centered around
[1:12:24] the word of God God and so I begin to
[1:12:27] tell him I said listen there's a story
[1:12:29] about an eagle and it tells it in
[1:12:30] Deuteronomy 32 and it begins to tell
[1:12:33] about it it says as the eagle stirreth
[1:12:35] up her nest it flutter over her young
[1:12:37] and spread her wings and taketh them and
[1:12:39] beareth them on her wings and I said let
[1:12:41] me tell you how this story goes I was
[1:12:44] glad they didn't know it I thought here
[1:12:45] I've got an
[1:12:47] opportunity and I said here this mama
[1:12:49] Eagle she goes out and she gathers the
[1:12:51] the thorns and the twigs and the
[1:12:53] branches and everything that and she
[1:12:55] makes her nest and she she begins to
[1:12:57] build her nest but then she begins to
[1:12:58] take the feathers off her belly the soft
[1:13:00] feathers and the rabbits fur and she
[1:13:02] lines The Nest expecting these young
[1:13:06] babies you know I love
[1:13:08] Eagles Tommy been teasing me sending me
[1:13:11] pictures of these two big eagles that's
[1:13:13] eating a carcass in this field I'm going
[1:13:16] to scotsville
[1:13:20] tomorrow and I tell them and and they're
[1:13:22] looking at me in amazement and awe and
[1:13:25] they're looking and I said but you know
[1:13:26] there comes a day even though that mama
[1:13:29] wants everybody to be
[1:13:33] comfortable I said yep that's the way it
[1:13:35] is in life that's the way it is in
[1:13:37] business we want Comfort we want to know
[1:13:40] that we're content we want to know that
[1:13:42] everything is good cozy and comfortable
[1:13:46] I said but there comes a day when that
[1:13:48] mama bird she gets in there and she
[1:13:50] begins to pluck out those feathers and
[1:13:53] she plucks out those those furs the
[1:13:55] rabbit's fur and I said you know what
[1:13:57] she's trying to do in order to get her
[1:13:59] babies to grow and realize who they are
[1:14:03] and what their potential
[1:14:05] is she has to make things
[1:14:09] uncomfortable if you're going to prosper
[1:14:12] in 2025 you might have to get a little
[1:14:15] uncomfortable and I told him I said
[1:14:17] listen and then she begins to look at
[1:14:18] him and those babies they like oh this
[1:14:20] is so
[1:14:21] terrible this hurts mama why do you do
[1:14:25] this and she begins to push them to the
[1:14:28] edge and they push to the edge to where
[1:14:30] they can't go no
[1:14:31] farther and they look into the
[1:14:40] chasm
[1:14:45] ah
[1:14:46] ah are you with
[1:14:49] me sometimes you have to have somebody
[1:14:51] to give you a little nudge sometimes you
[1:14:53] have to give have somebody to give you a
[1:14:54] little little push in life and so here
[1:14:57] these little Little Eagles are here and
[1:14:59] they're going down through here and
[1:15:01] they're trying to make a decision what
[1:15:03] are we going to do how can we have faith
[1:15:05] over this
[1:15:11] fear and Mama comes up and
[1:15:14] looks looks at them they look over and
[1:15:17] they're like I don't know and she
[1:15:25] oh can you imagine I I can just see them
[1:15:27] Wings just at getting it buddy can you
[1:15:29] imagine that feeling that heart racing

[1:16:59] people I'm here to tell you tonight you
[1:17:02] are God's
[1:17:07] people sometimes we just have to make a
[1:17:10] decision you know there's a difference
[1:17:12] between a decision and a
[1:17:15] choice have you ever thought about it
[1:17:19] there's a difference between a decision
[1:17:20] and a choice and when you make a
[1:17:21] decision you got your mind made up I'm
[1:17:24] de decided I'm going to do this I've
[1:17:27] decided that I'm going to take this road
[1:17:29] and that's the road I'm going to take
[1:17:30] and I've started out on this road and
[1:17:32] I'm
[1:17:34] determined but a choice is
[1:17:37] different a choice is different when you
[1:17:39] make a choice you're picking or
[1:17:41] choosing you're trying to make a a
[1:17:43] choice of what you're going to do many
[1:17:44] times we we do it out of
[1:17:46] convenience or we do it out of
[1:17:49] comfort oh I'm going to choose to go
[1:17:51] this way because it looks easier
[1:17:55] well you're not the ex you're not the
[1:17:57] only one lot did it
[1:18:01] too lot did it
[1:18:04] too and Abraham said lot which way do
[1:18:06] you want to
[1:18:08] go you
[1:18:12] decide look over
[1:18:15] there look at those
[1:18:18] pastures look at that grass man we we
[1:18:21] raise Cattle Man we talking about
[1:18:23] surviving and thriving woo things look
[1:18:26] good over
[1:18:28] there are you sure that's where you want
[1:18:30] to go I'm
[1:18:33] sure are you very sure that's where you
[1:18:35] want to
[1:18:36] go I'm going that way Uncle thank you
[1:18:40] buddy well uncle had a different
[1:18:43] Vision uncle said it don't matter how
[1:18:46] good it looks over there how bad it
[1:18:49] looks over here how poor it looks over
[1:18:52] here how desolate it is over here
[1:18:55] my god
[1:18:58] reigns I don't need that green grass to
[1:19:00] grow my
[1:19:01] cows I don't need water to give them
[1:19:04] something to drink because my God said
[1:19:06] he supplies all of my
[1:19:09] needs so we've inherited these
[1:19:14] things but keep the word first keep the
[1:19:19] word first because God is Mo and they
[1:19:22] was telling Moses here God was telling
[1:19:24] Moses remind the children of Israel how
[1:19:26] much I love them but tell them don't
[1:19:28] forget me because when they forget
[1:19:31] me hard times
[1:19:35] come when they forget me hard times
[1:19:39] come you know that's what happened with
[1:19:42] Israel I just heard this today a
[1:19:44] preacher was preaching on it he said you
[1:19:45] know what happened in Israel Israel was
[1:19:47] over there God give them the land God
[1:19:49] give them the land modern day Israel
[1:19:51] they were thriving they were they were
[1:19:53] producing they were produc they were
[1:19:55] doing good well then the neighbors saw
[1:19:57] how good they were doing they want to
[1:19:59] come in and take it
[1:20:02] over so they come in the
[1:20:05] Palestinians come in took it over why
[1:20:08] did they take it over because the people
[1:20:09] started turning from God so they come in
[1:20:11] and took it over in 1948 they become a
[1:20:14] sovereign Nation again because they were
[1:20:17] doing what God wanted them to do and God
[1:20:19] said I will bless those who bless and I
[1:20:22] will curse those who curse
[1:20:25] so as long as we stay with the word of
[1:20:27] God as long as we are thriving in the
[1:20:30] word of God we can't lose that's one of
[1:20:34] my new mots and brother berer quoted me
[1:20:36] I felt
[1:20:39] privileged as Believers we can't
[1:20:44] lose so brothers and sisters it's time
[1:20:46] to quit watering our
[1:20:48] weeds and planting our
[1:20:51] seeds now let me ask you has anybody
[1:20:53] ever went out into your your garden and
[1:20:55] say man I'm going to go ah here and
[1:20:56] plant me some
[1:20:57] weeds they look so good when they come
[1:21:00] up I'm going I'm going to go out there
[1:21:01] I'm going to plant me some weeds no you
[1:21:03] don't have to plant that junk it just
[1:21:05] comes
[1:21:06] up you can beat at it you can burn it
[1:21:10] you can poison it it's coming
[1:21:14] back but if you'll plant
[1:21:17] seeds if you'll plant seeds of
[1:21:20] fruitfulness and you take care of those
[1:21:23] roots you know it's it's it's not the
[1:21:25] plant that produces the fruit it's the
[1:21:28] roots that produce the fruit so as we as
[1:21:31] Christians as our Roots grow and Our
[1:21:34] Roots get deeper and stronger and our
[1:21:36] roots go down Into the Depths and suck
[1:21:38] the nutrients that God has for us as we
[1:21:42] dig into the
[1:21:44] soil as we dig into the word of God we
[1:21:47] have no choice but to start producing
[1:21:49] fruits big ripe Christians big happy
[1:21:53] faces big joyful churches big worshiping
[1:21:58] crowds are you with me we can prosper in
[1:22:06] 2025 because the word tells me through
