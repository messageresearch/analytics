[0:00] All right. Given by his mercy, spiritual
[0:03] well-being. Blessed refers to a
[0:05] spiritual state of inner happiness, joy,
[0:11] and contentment that is not dependent
[0:14] upon material wealth or positive
[0:17] circumstances.
[0:20] Inner satisfaction in God. True
[0:23] spiritual blessing means being fully
[0:26] satisfied in God alone.
[0:29] Amen.
[0:31] I'm here to tell you, I'm going to tell
[0:33] you again. I'm here to tell you that if
[0:35] you haven't got God in your heart and
[0:37] you're not satisfied with your
[0:39] relationship with God, you won't be
[0:41] happy with your wife. You won't be happy
[0:43] with your husband. You won't be happy
[0:45] with your job. You won't be happy with
[0:47] your dog. You won't be happy with your
[0:48] cat. You just won't be happy. Why?
[0:50] Because you haven't got that inner
[0:52] happiness.
[0:54] Amen. The proud pastor, he's just not
[0:56] good enough. The preacher ain't good
[0:58] enough. The church ain't good enough.
[0:59] The deacon ain't good enough. Trustees
[1:01] ain't good enough.
[1:03] Hello. Just total no satisfaction. But
[1:07] brother preach, he says, "Man, you find
[1:09] such a discontent. People everywhere are
[1:12] not satisfied."
[1:14] I'm here to tell you, if you have a car
[1:16] and you have the Amen and you have a car
[1:18] and you you know you don't know nothing
[1:21] about the mechanics, you don't even know
[1:23] you're supposed to put gas in it, you're
[1:24] going to have problems down the road. It
[1:28] helps to know something about what it
[1:29] is. And how many know is that people
[1:31] don't know what you are made for? We
[1:34] were not made to be empty. Our heart was
[1:36] made to be filled. You and I, we need
[1:39] satisfaction. Everybody needs
[1:41] satisfaction. Amen. But praise be to
[1:43] God. We understand. Amen. That if your
[1:46] car don't start, get out there, pop the
[1:48] hood. Amen. Wiggle that positive wire a
[1:50] little bit. Make sure that it's
[1:51] connected good. Amen. Make it was
[1:53] loosened. Tighten that thing up. And
[1:55] boom, here we go.
[1:57] That's where with your life, if it ain't
[1:58] turning the way that it to if you ain't
[2:01] got joy unspeakable. I like that song.
[2:03] Brother David said, "Well, I found his
[2:05] grace is all complete. It supplies my
[2:08] every need. It is joy unspeakable and
[2:10] full of glory. Full of glory.
[2:15] Amen. How many blows? It flows." Amen.
[2:17] It just flows.
[2:21] Amen. God wants you to have joy
[2:24] unspeakable and full of glory. Amen.
[2:28] David, he got so so much of God. Amen.
[2:31] He says, "My cup is full and it's
[2:34] running over." How many believe that
[2:35] with what you got, with what I got, our
[2:38] cups ought to be full this morning. It
[2:40] ought to be running over a little bit.
[2:44] That's right. If it ain't, it ain't
[2:46] God's fault. He's got us plenty to
[2:49] drink. He's got us plenty to eat.
[2:52] If you ain't eating and you ain't
[2:54] drinking the way you ought to, you that
[2:57] spiritual deprived person, that hungry
[2:59] person, not getting nothing out of the
[3:02] service, why don't you repent? Why don't
[3:04] you fix that problem? Get right to where
[3:06] you come to church. Amen. You pull from
[3:08] the gift of God. You go out a better
[3:10] person to what you come in.
[3:13] We sing that song, count your blessings.
[3:16] Name them one by one.
[3:19] Hey, count your blessings. I'm here to
[3:21] tell you that when you start counting
[3:23] your blessings,
[3:25] you will give God glory and praise and
[3:27] thanks. You won't have time to complain.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; You won't have time to You'll be too
[3:33] busy counting some more blessing.
