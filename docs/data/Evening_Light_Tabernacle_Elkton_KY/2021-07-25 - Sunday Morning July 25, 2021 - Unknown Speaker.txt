spirit and in truth in jesus name amen and amen amen sunday schools they all can be dismissed for sunday school brothers even if you'll come up for the bible reading at this time morning brothers and sisters i ask you to open our bibles to first peter first peter 2. we'll read verses 1 through 12. last one together first peter 2. wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies in all evil speakings if so be you have tasted that the lord is gracious ye also are lively stones or built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer a spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner be you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of the darkness into his marvelous light dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstained from the fleshly lust which war against the soul last winner together having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evil doers that may ye be your good works which shall shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation brother brian you can all be seated you know when i was a lot younger than what i am right now that's one of the chapters in the bible that i memorized that along with several other chapters you know well there's a lot of truth just the one thing that it talks about you can turn to romans the 11th chapter this morning you know that stone everyone in their own life has to face that stone you know either you're going to fall on it and humble yourselves or you're going to go on the other side one day and that very stone that very presence will have to destroy you have choice and every every man woman has a choice and he kind of goes back to what brother thomas was talking about on wednesday night you know everyone has a choice you know you can choose god doesn't force you to believe he encourages you to believe but he doesn't force you to believe everything he does is through love and guidance leading you prodding with you to get you in a place where you'll accept him he doesn't force anyone into anything that's a choice we all have to make but i was uh thinking i'll jump over here this morning you know i'll just read this you all know where i'm about to read from you know how many messages have we if some of you are just been in them been in been christians for a year or two some have been christians for 50 60 years 30 years you've all heard this scripture here but as the years start unfolding themselves you see it coming to manifestation you know it used to be it would take a year for something to happen or maybe 10 years for something happen now we're dealing with hours and days it's you know like brother branham said in the countdown message you know you go from the just the invention of the wheel and the saddle then you go to the invention of cars and airplanes and rockets and as the as the ages move on they accelerate faster and faster and faster we're at that point now with what we thought would be normal yesterday the next day is not normal anymore but i'll just read this you all i don't have to have you turn there you'll know what i'm reading but i was thinking how many messages have i heard of we all heard where ministers of the gospel go to the third chapter of revelations and talk about that last church age and and i'll just read the scripture i was thinking you can see this scripture being fulfilled this morning and everything that's going on out there in the world and i'll just read what has to say and he's talking to the church and saying i know thy works without neither cold nor hot i wouldn't that were cold or hard so god's telling them that he would prefer them to be totally cold or totally hot so then because thou art lukewarm neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because i'll say as i am rich increased with goods and i have need of nothing notice thou not but thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked and if you return with me to the 11th chapter of romans this morning you know i think the gentile church in itself is taken for granted you know if you look at the children of israel's history as and you read the old testament you see their history you see their ups their downs you can see the same thing in the church this morning the gentile churches got into a place just like the israelis in their day before they fell the temple was destroyed that they thought that that would never happen that it would never happen that god would always provide for him and it's the same thing with the gentile church this morning they're moving into judgment and they have no clue that god is moving them into judgment because they didn't accept the word for the hour and their eyes are blinded their hearts are hardened and it's a rare it's a precious thing to know that god is dealing with your heart and your life this morning and i'll just read here and i was i was trying to find some things and it goes back to what brother thomas was talking about on wednesday if if you're dealing with people next to you what does being a christian mean to you how how do you interact with people i know i never said anything wednesday night but how do you interact with people how does being a christian make you feel in your heart how to and from that heart experience that you have how do you deal with your fellow man whether it's on the job or the guy you meet in walmart or woman how do you how do you interact with them and how do you explain who you are and what you are to them you know and the two things i was thinking about the two virtues that a christian really has to have not while putting patience aside because that's really important you need a lot of patience with people because you can't make people be better you can't make them be worse you can't make them be better you have to have a lot of patience for people that doesn't mean that you make excuses for their bad behavior but you just have to be patient with people and i was thinking the one virtue that a christian really has to have in this day and age is empathy you have to have empathy for people i know i'm using a big english word there but basically you have to be able to put yourself in someone else's shoes and and feel for them even though they're wrong you have to understand them you can't be so much judgmental you just have to keep working with them so god until god finally speaks to them and they move into a relationship and i was thinking this morning i carry this in my notebook it's in that healing thoughts book it's what brother adam said about thoughts and i was thinking a christian is possessed by not bad thoughts good thoughts and a way to know what's possessing you when you develop when you reach a situation whatever it is you're dealing with a friend or someone at work what is that inside your heart or inside your mind whatev wherever you're coming from what's the first thing you think of is it a positive thought or is it a negative thought now it doesn't mean that people aren't accountable for their actions but what kind of thoughts possess you when you're dealing with any given situation and i'll just read this is this is out of spiritual adoption and this is the preamble in that book of all those situations it says in order to stay with god stay gentle and god is a gentle spirit god is gentle in order to stay with god stay with love god is love stay meek you know meek does mean in this sense means that you put everything before the lord before you make that decision in anything that's going on don't ever be self-sufficient i got to raise my hand there i'm just one of those fellers that likes to be self-sufficient but when it comes to my christianity it comes to my experience in christ i can't i can't do it myself i can't be self-sufficient in that because i always rely upon him and this is really hard for this agent never never use your own mind everything we use we have to use the word of god and i was thinking goes back to wednesday what do we have in this age as christians that gives us the ability to be victorious and it's simply the word of god you know that's what you you have an absolute which is the word of god for the hour that we live in and that should give you comfort it should give you peace in your mind and that's what a lot of you were talking about wednesday is that you have peace through christ and he goes on to say don't ever be self-sufficient always rely upon him never use your own mind take his thoughts let his thoughts be your thoughts so again you can only get his thoughts what did brother adam say his thoughts are expressed in the word of god the bible that i have opened before me and the message that was revealed those are the thoughts of god those are the thoughts that we should have i don't have my you know a lot of people say this you know i don't have a personal thought in it it's only what the word of god has to say about it his thoughts let his thoughts be your thoughts take them into your carnal mind repeat them over and over and brother madam is given whatever your state is right now this morning before the living god he's giving you even in a in a carnal mind he's telling you if you can't if you're still so carnal if you'll just keep reading god's word and putting the word of god before you in a daily way sooner or later your spirit your soul and body will come into possession of those very thoughts and you the only way that can happen is that you put yourself in that state and he goes on to say here repeat them over and over say oh god take all my doubt away let my thoughts be your thoughts and he goes on to say just cast away the thoughts of sickness and this you know this book dealt with you know physical sickness but in the age that we live in it i mean physical sickness is one thing but the mental sickness out there in the world today is unbelievable where people don't know the absolute simple truth i mean in a physical sense they don't have no truth in in the physical reality that we're living they make subdivision you know i'm using big words sorry about that but they believe you know when a man can be a woman a woman can be a man or you can be in between those two states you know that's that's madness that's you know it goes on to say here so let take take all my doubt away and let my thoughts be your thoughts just cast away the thoughts of sickness take god's healing thoughts let them become your thoughts think on these things and and it goes back to philippians i'm not going to turn there in philippians but it goes back to the fourth chapter of those are the thoughts that we need to have thoughts of kindness thoughts of health thoughts of treating your brothers and sisters better than you would treat yourself in the age that we live and always putting other people before yourself that's not a that's not a human nature human nature wants to consolidate everything and control everything the christian nature wants to be open and help people and uh if we go to uh i'll get started and i'm i won't be able to get stopped here this morning but i was thinking in this 11th chapter i'm not going to read it i'll just tell you as i before i go sit down this 11th chapter paul is talking about the pharisees the sadducees and the children of israel in his day and he's telling the gentiles that god blinded them and grafted our branch in for our sake and that not to think of yourself greater than you should because if the wild branch is grafted into the good tree and he goes on to finish the chapter i'd be here all day reading the whole chapter telling the christians that they could be as simply pulled out of that tree as easily as they were grafted in and you don't have you don't have any pride in it any belief other than what god has done i'll just finish with these last couple of verses here it starts at it starts at about the 26 so all israel shall be saved as the writtens they shall come out of zion a deliverer that shall turn away the ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins and that time is upon the face of the earth right now god is eventually going to turn away from the gentile church and move to the to the jews again that time is just it's on hand it's here it's i can't tell you if it's going to be tomorrow or 10 years from now but you can see the signs that we live in that it's it's soon to be churning up there are enemies for your sake as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake and he goes on to say for the gifts and calling and of god are without repentance for as ye in times past have not believed god yet through now obeying mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now believe that through your mercy they might also obtain mercy for god has concluded them all on their belief that he might have mercy upon them and he goes on this for all the depths and riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments his ways past finding for who hath known the mind of the lord and who hath been his counselor for what first given to him shall be recounts on to him again for for of him and through him and to him are all things to him be ever glory forever and like i said as a christian it's you know all i can say is that we have a hope in the age that we live in and it's an eternal hope we just need to hold on to brother

glad today amen there's a sign in the office that says this is the day that the lord has created amen he did create this day amen and let me tell you something i mean why do we complain brother byler amen if he created it then everything's laid out everything's laid out perfect amen and it's for his glory for his purpose for his will amen amen and i believe he already searched it out amen yesterday he already searched out today amen and that what he did for them in the old testament before they even pitched their tents the lord says i've already went through the mountains the valleys that i've already searched it out before you even pitched your tents amen amen so before you even got on the road this morning the lord already had it amen planned out and no matter what the circumstances was amen i believe all things was going to work for the good amen you're glad to be here it's good to be here again amen and i appreciate brother byler opening the door for us to come and and of course we give you uh regards from the church in sharpsville indiana brother dewey moss and and uh of course uh uh we're just thankful for the traveling mercies that god's had his hands on us and kept us through the traffic and it was pretty rough coming down uh over here uh we we've been here many many times in this area but just i think yesterday was the first time we've had a rough time trying to get here hey man so maybe the lord's got some in store right amen something they expect amen so well just to share this song and i appreciate the song leader amen and singing some of those hymns and you know i i go to a lot of churches and sometimes i don't hear those songs anymore and you know there a lot of them sing just beautiful songs i'm not putting any songs down you know but it's just when you really hear you know things like things that was in the old hymns and you're just like wow you know that brings back you know some of those songs are the ones you meditated on you know and where just the presence of the lord came down and just really touched your heart or something like that or amen but he's he's really good amen if you know this song you can sing it with me i'm not the best singer i just do the best amen and and i just do it for the lord amen look i didn't come to entertain you amen but i i just want to sing for the lord and let him touch your heart amen oh glorious victory amen that day he set me free right amen who i am amen you know who you are this morning amen oh glorious victory that day he set me free and made my heart his very throne amen my life is no longer mine i'm the prisoner of love divine and now i live to praise his name who i am lord who i am i am a part of my savior a part of his word amen it's a revelation it's predestination [Applause] [Music] on calvary he [Music] [Music] this is god's great mystery of love expressed to me that christ and i might be i can see now who i am [Applause] a part of my savior a

part of his word glory amen it's a revelation it's predestination amen you believe that hallelujah glory to god praise his name hallelujah glory uh maybe just share a little testimonies amen you love him praise the lord maybe this dropped us down a little bit so i'm not breathing in the mic amen uh just maybe a few prayer requests also just remember a little group that i go to a lot way down in montezuma indiana there's a lot of amish communities in that area and of course i don't know if anybody knows brother levi fisher he came out of the amish community and he has i believe accepted this message way back in 2012 and he's passed away passed away last year he was about 61 years old he had a heat stroke and couldn't just couldn't recover and uh but uh uh his sons now are uh or his son the oldest son samuels pastoring the there's about about 70 in their little uh group there and that's including uh young and old and and also some of the ones just from the outside you know just coming there and uh just a a wonderful bunch a man that loves the lord very hungry standing on this this the message of the word you know standing on it strongly amen and and just fighting the good night amen and uh i was just there two sundays ago and i noticed that two families was not there and i started asking and they said they went to ohio the northern part of ohio and there was about 10 families in a little group there of amish also that had invited brother samuel to come and just to kind of you know encourage them uh of course when uh that i think the next day uh brother samuel would talk to me and he said everything went real well and they just kind of encouraged the people there and they said now they're they're not completely cut off just yet but they said that they're they're just hungry and they believe that there's just more to this through the bible that they're holding amen and what they're being taught and what they believe and they said we just we believe there's more and and so you know so here they had opened the church up there's about family attend family when i'm saying 10 families of amish you know that's about 100 people you know but anyway so you know that's a pretty big group though you know and and uh so just remember uh them in prayer because brother samuel told me that it won't be long where they would also be cut off also they would be excommunicated and you know so but and lisa you know they're really searching for something amen look this this world might excommunicate you amen but we've got a god with open arms you know and says i'll be your friend and then i'll be your father i'll be amen i'll be your savior i'll be your healer amen glory i'll be your provider amen amen glory to god and that's that's the hope that we're giving them amen and and and when they when they heard a little bit of what brother samuel had bought and they just fell in love with it they said we want you to know brother samuel you are welcome to come back amen because like i said they're just seeking they're searching they're amen but i don't know how long it will take but just pray for them amen and also not too long ago there was another group that was there in bloomington and they've already been excommunicated and brother samuel went there also tried to encourage them and trying to point them out to close you know message churches and things like that but uh we have one also not too far from where i live in peru there's a little group there but of course they're already sort of established in a little church that they found and the brother there the pastor he's not fully into the message or that you would say but he has received some materials and he says i like it amen and i you know he said there's something about it amen so now you got that little group there i'm telling you god is doing something amen glory look when you're when maybe you don't see something happening in your town just think of the next town amen or the next city or the next state somewhere amen but i believe god is working he's still in the saving business i believe he's still drawing amen he did say amen everyone that the father has given me amen will come to me amen of course that's only the half part of that verse amen and i believe that's to the bride amen but the other half is to those that's been given the responsibility for the bride has what a responsibility to point to christ and then he says but anyone that does come to me i wouldn't know was cast out amen i know in ephesians where uh they're in thessalonians where he said i have chosen unto you salvation you cannot show me a scripture where god chose anybody to be lost there's not one his desire was no one was to perish he gave amen he gave that open door to every human race there is out there amen look the bride will be in the city and there's going to be those outside the city amen you got the 144 that's what gonna be servants to the bride amen glory but look brother byler this is what i've been running into amen and i'm not taking about i'm not talking about denominational you know systems out there i'm talking about this message realm amen i've run through people look let me tell you something in the scriptures i can i believe that the scribes and the pharisees have every right to be religious you want to know why because they had the whole truth they had the whole word they just didn't act on it the way they were supposed to amen they had a different attitude they lost their compassion amen they got to the place where a spirit fell on them then it was like whatever they could just gain in their pocket you know they didn't care about those that you know were having a hard time or they got to the place say man that this is what i'm running into that i'm bride so i believe that i deserve everything the blessing only comes to the bride amen that's not the inheritance is yeah i believe the bride gets the inheritance don't get me wrong amen but look i i i have had to talk to some people i'm like look as soon as you revolve yourself in that revelation that your bride which is good i said then before you know it you're just like the pharisees or the scribes i said i have every right brother byler to be religious this morning because i got the full truth amen but i want to act right hey man i want to look at the very ones that i believe that are sinners and say hey you know what don't you know you got the opportunity to not just to feel like you know you know i believe i i'm bright so you know all of this is mine and that's true we're going to receive it amen but share a little bit amen glory amen tell them there's no one out there that god ever desired to be lost amen the only reason they're lost is because they chose to be lost they chose that amen god didn't choose that amen but yeah he had everything prepared he created hell because he knew amen by the foreknowledge of god he already knew amen glory that who am i to judge who am i to point fingers amen glory regardless of the the whatever that woman or that man or whatever life they're living i i can't look at them and say hey you deserve everything that's coming to you that's a wrong attitude amen look uh there's a side of jonah let me tell you something jonah was a man of god i'm sorry i haven't got to my scriptures but i believe i believe the holy spirit's talking to us amen he's not just talking to you he's talking to me amen look we're talking about maybe an attitude change here look rapture's around the corner amen i believe brother branham said when he said if there's just what a scratch of a hot you know an aux just a little small scratch he said that could kick you out i i think i'd like to seek my own salvation with fear and trembling lord i want to make sure that i'm really going to make it in amen but look i you know i want to win a soul regardless if they're in the city or outside the city amen i like what a brother said he said you know what if i'm not in a city but lord please at least let me outside the city let me be able to stand there and see how the bride and her glory walking into that gate you know amen yeah it's going to be sad for those that's going to be outside the city amen they'll have to go through the tribulation and all of that but look salvation was still for them amen hallelujah amen but i have come across with some people with such attitude and i'm telling you i was like my it just breaks my heart what about your neighbor what about your friend that you know that's not serving the lord but what about him are you so revolving your your revelation that you know you're gonna make it but what are you doing on trying to get him you know or her i believe that's our responsibility amen glory praise the lord you know i i i get the one of the things that hits me a lot is uh brother paul do you believe you're born with the seed you're not born with the seed i was like brother i have searched i have searched this message and i have never heard the phrase born with a seed or not born with a seed i i've never seen it i said what kind of doctrine is that i said i believe in divine election god chose before the foundation of the world amen look the eagle was born an eagle though he was in the chicken barn but once he heard oh that's me amen glory amen but i believe god's got it all laid out amen hallelujah let me uh read a scripture to you and maybe for just uh standing on the word you know i was mentioning uh jonah you know i believe jonah had to get an attitude change you know you know when he began to was called to go to nineveh jonah knew exactly what nineveh was amen now jonah you won't read nothing about you know the really cruel things about nineveh in the book of jonah but if you go in the book of naham now the prophet nahan will explain to you everything about nineveh amen and then you'll know that's why that's why jonah didn't want to go he even he even beseeched god begged him to say kill me now me he says kill me now because i do not want to go jonah had an attitude where you know what they deserve what they're getting they deserve that judgment that they're getting but god send them and because of his stubborn men yeah he was swallowed by a fish and amen was there three days and three nights and my but he went amen even on that boat jonah i don't think he knew he was doing a missionary work amen and there was there was those scribes and pharisees amen amen they were there and it he couldn't get them to turn but here's pagan people amen the bible says they they cried out to their each gods each of their own gods they had a different god each one of them those men in that boat start to cry out to them amen but there was jonah doing a ministry didn't even know it running from god he was running from god and god was still using him you want to run i'm still going to save people the whole boat was converted amen hallelujah that's god amen glory hallelujah but you know it's just sometimes we just get that way you know i've ran into some people that i tell you what when all this coronavirus was going on and and it was really it yeah it just seems like judgment i believe it was judgment hitting the this earth amen and you had those that i came across and my loves the lord but then they said well they deserve what they're getting i was like no amen i said they have just as every right they have every opportunity there is the salvation amen what you should have been doing is praying for them amen glory amen let me tell you something if we believe raptors right around the corner i tell you we need to check our attitudes we need to check our lives hey man we need to check our hearts amen glory i mean our brother was reading all those scriptures he was talking about the the pharisees and the way their attitudes were and amen i tell you what we're supposed to be different brother we're supposed to be different amen in your bibles if you stand in ephesians chapter one amen and i believe you only have one service today so uh i don't know how long am i supposed to preach brother byler until i'm done okay amen praise the lord now i'm the pastor have spoken amen glory to god amen ephesians chapter one there in verse starting in verse 11 through 14 says uh in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise amen listen now that we should be is that tomorrow or next week or is that today amen that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ amen you trust him this morning amen and i believe there's many back then back then amen had trusted the lord when they heard the word when they heard the gospel amen amen now verse 13 in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of the of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom all so after that you believed ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise amen now look tell yourself this amen the holy spirit of promise that cannot be broken amen that's god's word amen he can't go back on that amen the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest amen of our inheritance amen until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen glory to god may the lord have his blessing on the rest of the reading of the word amen and you may be seated amen now uh in whom also we have obtained is saying amen now here you know one vital uh feature of the mystery is believing is here because when we when you begin to look at sometimes the scriptures and you'll you'll see like sometimes you go back to like studying paul and here he is and sometimes he'll refer to jews and also he's referring to gentiles amen when you begin to read things here so one vital feature here of the mystery is is the believing jews and also believing gentiles have their what their share in this grand program of god there's going to be many you know let me tell you something i want i want you to to to to think about this you don't have to be bribed to make it in okay but if god has given you that revelation you see yourself as bride then well praise the lord glory to god amen hallelujah but there's those amen but look once you receive that that revelation then you hold a great responsibility amen you hold a really great responsibility why because now you need to be the example to the ones that needs to be outside the city sometimes we gotten slothful and lazy and i don't know we get caught up amen with so many things you know that's that's what's one of the devil's tactics amen glory so here there's a share into this program you know and here the apostle you know speaks of the mystery you know and in relation to jewish believers amen especially in verse 11 and 12 and also in relation to gentile believers in verse 13 and also 14. amen and as for the christian of jewish history or ancestry amen paul writes in him he writes here and he says now in him also we have what obtained an inheritance amen so their right to share is not based amen on their former national privileges it's not because they were jews it's not because well i'm a jew i'm i'm god's chosen i'm god's people because not all jews were born that way but that doesn't mean that there's those outside 144 that won't maybe make it because the whole thing is john 3 16 amen for god so loved the world and then now god says that bride's not the world amen but look god's got to fulfill scriptures the bride is not excluded when it comes to baptism when it comes to the calvary shredding and shedding of the blood being covered by the atonement amen she's not excluded amen we all came from adam and eve glory to god hallelujah let me tell you something that jesus himself that was sinless and because scriptures had to be fulfilled had to be baptized amen the the bride god does not allow the bride to just bypass anything uh you know no it doesn't happen that way let me tell you something i don't think god sweeps uh you know look he doesn't bless over sin either let me let me tell you this right now there's no plan b brothers and sisters it's all plant there's it's all plan a amen there's only one way amen and everybody's got to go through christ amen so here they are amen and it's not about their their their national uh privileges or anything like that not just because they can say well i'm a jew amen or anything like that you know but it was solely on their union with christ that's what it was amen you and i amen glory to god so here they are so the inheritance you know here looks forward amen to the time when they what and all true believers will be manifested to an amazed world glory as what the body of christ yeah there's part of this world it is going to hell amen and that's sad to say you know you there there should be no one here that claims to be a christian that that's easy for you to just say you know what there's people going to hell you know every time i say that it's oh my inside of me it's like i don't wish anybody to go hey man that's a that would be a horrible thing amen amen glory to god you know brother branham you know was you know how many hair has aches and pains and hey man especially when you're getting my age you know when i was young you know i had the elderly told me like better heart look when you reach our age you're going to wake up in the morning your bones popping this hurts and that hurt your knee won't move your elbow you know all of this has an ah you know but of course i've never experienced it i was in my prime amen no way you know i wake up just fine i sleep 10 hours you know and and wake up no problem but you know i'd have to say you know what you're right you're right but you know brother branham said that when we get that changed body he said you're gonna faint you're gonna feel what a slight sharp pain go through your body he says that's when you're getting that body change and uh i i've been battling sciatic nerves and i'm doing better praise the lord so when i was listening to that and i was like my i must be getting younger amen so now when i wake up and i'm all achy and oh there's pain i said oh it's rapture time brother biler i'm looking forward to this body change amen is this it is this the pain oh glory amen nobody likes pain amen but it's good to think positive look when you wake up with a migraine amen oh maybe this is it glory amen but if it's not we'll just deal with it the lord will take care of it amen and it'll be the next day amen amen but he's good amen so here you know here's the inheritance now and here's the body of christ the bride the bride of the lamb amen now from all eternity you know these jewish christians were they were marked they were marked out you know uh for this for this place of privilege by the you know the sovereign will of god and and here you know being pre-predestined you know according to the the purpose of him you know who works all things amen according to the council of his will amen glory and i'm glad that god's the one in control i'm glad it's not about you know the pastor you know running all the things you know or the deacon or the you know i mean they have their part amen glory but it's the spirit moving through each individual amen and they're projecting what god has called them to do amen to encourage this brother or that sister amen but it's the body of christ amen but we have gone to a place sometimes and we don't realize it we don't you know sometimes you're backslidden and you don't even know it that's i'm sorry if that if that hurts or if that's stepping on somebody's toe but look it steps on my toe amen because there's times that it's too late i didn't realize what i was doing i've been doing that sin last week then god rebukes me about it and i said man i was backsliding two weeks ago brother bye and i didn't even know it all right amen glory to god and you gotta you know i appreciate that there are still christians that's not callous to convictions because there's so many i mean they're callous to conviction they just keep doing what they're doing that they're doing and it's like no there's no worries no care no amen but i'm glad that god has still put that conviction in there that as soon as you feel it you run the pop of god and you say i'm sorry amen glory amen so here you know the purpose of this predestination was what was that they should be to the praise of his glory amen and if that's the predestination of god amen and when you see when i look at that sign in that office where it says this is the day that the lord has made amen and we should rejoice and be glad in it amen not that not that the benefits you know to benefit me or anything like that but it's a benefit god amen it's to lift him up it's to exalt him above everything you humble yourself amen in a proper way according to the scriptures then god will exalt you but let him do that don't never let the devil exalt you amen never never give him that place where he'll lift you up amen because it'll be for the wrong reasons amen he'll lift you up so you'll fall amen when god lifts you up amen when david said amen i'm in a maori clay amen he was in a clay pit amen glory and he cried out to god and the bible says that god took him by the right hand amen and lifted him up amen and set him on the rock didn't just found any kind of uh uh anywhere to place him on any any ground amen that he said it was on the rock amen because it says let all other ground be sinking sand amen but i'm the rock glory hallelujah you know in other words you know they are trophies of the grace of god exhibiting what amen what he can do with such what unlikely raw materials amen oh lord you know maybe i've been serving you like the brother says there's some of you serving god for two years maybe 10 years 50 years amen but let me be a fresh material in your hands and use me and shake me amen to help somebody glory to god amen hallelujah you know there's a story in the bible about the blind man he was born blind amen can you imagine this man now the bible says he wasn't a boy or a child he was a man that means he had who knows maybe he was in his late 20s or late 30s but he lived all those years could not experience what you're experiencing from the time you were born amen in your amazement of lights my mama papa and that's what you look like amen the dogs the cats the animals he didn't have that maybe there was a time he was able to pet one you know oh you must be a dog i don't know for all we knew it was a bear unless somebody told him he said son that's a dog you're patting you know he heard the birds says what's that noise out here uh son that's the birds and he never could really because he he's born blind can you imagine that amen and here the man jesus glory then he met jesus never met him before they were strangers he could not tell him he could not tell you what he looked like how tall he was his figure or anything like that even after his eyes was open man but here jesus amen spits on the ground reaches for and it makes mud out of it puts it on his eyes what was jesus doing because jesus knew even all the way from the very beginning he knew the very origin the very material that a human was made out of the bible says adam was what made out of the dust of the ground amen and when god amen jesus say man god in flesh standing there was going to what create eyeballs what did he do went back to the dust of the ground the very origin the very material he knew to grab and put it on his eyes and he says now go wash and when he washed he had eyeballs you can see now oh glory to god let me tell you something god is still what using the very origin the very raw material i meant you and i we are what the word being made flesh amen glory still uses the original amen glory material amen to spread his gospel amen glory to god look and when you're when you call on the elders amen and god moves upon that and honors it amen faith he's got to honor it and when those men lay hands on you amen god's using what the very original material amen glory to god hallelujah god is good amen maybe we'll come back to him again hallelujah praise god you know the apostle speaks of himself and other believing jews as as we who first trusted in christ that's what he said you know who first trusted in christ amen you know he is thinking of what the godly remnant of jews amen who responded to the gospel amen in the early days of christianity amen the good news was what first preached amen to the jews amen and most of the nation of israel flatly rejected it that's right amen glory to god you know he had a he god had a bride once the jews and he had to put her divorcement amen then he went to the gentiles and said i'll find me another bride glory to god oh aren't you don't you feel special i was engrafted amen brother brandon was talking there in the 70 weeks of daniel where god purposely this is god you're talking you're looking at amen think about it god purposely blinded the jews so you could see amen it was a no accident that they blinded god purposely blinded them so you and i could see glory to god how mindful your god is because he saw you and he says i want them amen i want you brother byler i want you sister i want you brother glory hallelujah you know when i heard that i cried i went i was driving i was driving i can't remember if i had to pull over or not but i know i don't know if i even got it to work i got to where i was going but i i was bawling so hard i was just i was so excited within myself to know that the god i'm serving purposely purposely amen did that for me amen and when you begin to look at you know god from the very beginning amen he already knew you amen glory you know when he was talking to jeremiah and he says i already knew you before you even farm in your mother's womb amen can you imagine that there was in the very thought of god brother byler where he probably at one time walked and put his arms around you fellowship with you and you didn't even know it that was all going on what in his mind oh my glory i mean that might be looking way back then but still his mind is eternal he saw exactly amen and you weren't even born yet in his mind he was already fellowshipping with you amen he already comforted you amen hallelujah when he said i've searched it all out amen that was before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah oh i knew exactly what day you were sick oh i could feel the pain man hallelujah i know what you was going through of course you know he you know when he was god he didn't know the you know the holy spirit don't suffer that's why he needed that flesh amen he wanted to experience it but he had to experience it amen glory to god and he carried it to the cross amen and it was a finished work amen glory hallelujah amen glory now here you know the godly remnant believed on the lord jesus say man you know paul was one of them amen amen so here paul you know now in verse 13 paul switches from believers who had been born jews to those who had been born gentiles amen and he indicates that this by by changing form to we to you amen because in verse 11 and 12 he kept saying we we amen now he's like what now he's put the jews to the side and he's saying you you you amen now those who who have been born you know have been saved amen from paganism you know have a share in the mystery of god's will as well as what converted jews amen and so the apostle here you know what traces the steps you know by by by which the ephesians say man and other gentiles have been brought into union with christ you know he goes all the way those that have heard this gospel and that you know they heard the gospel they believed in christ they were sealed they were sealed with the holy spirit of promise first they heard the word of truth amen the gospel of their salvation and basically this refers to the good news of salvation through faith in the lord jesus amen but in a wider sense amen it includes all all the teachings of christ amen and the apostles hallelujah and having heard this message amen they made a commitment amen i hope we're making a commitment today of themselves to christ amen by a what a deceptive they meant to to act on their faith amen if you truly believed and act on it amen as the scripture says you know we don't only it's not only by sight but and all of those things but it's by faith amen but there's a scripture where it says you know we must do the walk we don't just talk only but we walk the talk amen well if you can talk it i hope we can walk it amen glory and here they are amen and salvation is found and what him alone only christ hallelujah and as soon as they believed they were what sealed with the holy spirit of promise amen glory and here you know this means that every true believer amen receives the spirit of god amen as a sign that he belongs to god amen you belong to him amen glory and that he will be what kept he will be kept safe by god until the time amen he receives his glorified body amen i'll be honest with you i'm not in my goal they say by revelation i'm in it already i'm glad that you have a revelation of the glorified body but amen i believe in heavenly places amen glory to god but let me tell you something i know what the glorified body is look there's a difference between the glorified body and the theophany because in your glorified body amen you can eat you can drink you can enjoy the very things that god amen has created you for look this earth is what you're going to inherit too it'll be all cleaned up and pure all right amen again amen you'll never have to worry about some t some sister touching you and having any kind of glance you know you'll never lust again everything will be pure amen glory oh what a day that'll be hallelujah what an inheritance amen to look forward to amen glory and here you know just as in legal matters a seal indicates what ownership and security so it does also in the divine fair affairs of god amen what affairs you have as an individual between you and god god has a seal on that and that seal amen it doesn't matter what demon what devil comes that way they'll see that seal and they say he belongs to somebody already oh they'll try to sneak in there amen amen they try amen glory look the indwelling spirit brings us as god's property amen glory you belong to him our seal is called the holy spirit amen of promise amen first he is the holy spirit this is what he is in himself then he is spirit of promise amen even the spirit himself he don't even keep that all to himself you know the bible says that he shared that divine power he says that that divine power he shared that with you can you imagine can you tell me what devil out there could stop the very divine power of god none and if he shared that remember now we're heirs amen we're co-heirs we're heirs amen and he shared he said he shared that power with you might and and sometimes the devil comes our way and we just act like a bunch of losers when the bible says we're winners and the devil's running saying i'm a winner and they're losers and we make him feel like he is winner and we act like a bunch of losers when our bible says he shared that that power that it even says that very divine nature not only the power but the very divine nature of god has been placed within you my then you wonder why when brother adam says amen that when the weakest christian falls on his knees and praise amen the devil's tremble amen glory to god hallelujah glory praise god amen look he was promised by the father father amen in the book of joel chapter 2 there in acts chapter 1 also in john 16 amen and in addition amen he is what he is the guarantee amen that all god's promise amen to the believers will be fulfilled every promise you will find in this book has to be fulfilled and if it's not fulfilled here while you're on earth amen he promised amen that the very overcomers of each church age amen would receive a reward and can you imagine that the first church age amen their reward they'll receive that the second church age has a reward too but if they overcome they get their reward plus the first church age reward because they're not only fighting amen what the first church age went through the second church age now is fighting what came upon them and what was upon the first amen so can you imagine this laodicean church look i'm not laodicean church age amen but i'm the overcomer that's in the laosian church age i'm the overcomer that's receiving what the first church age reward the second church age reward the third the fourth the fifth the sixth amen glory do you know what your reward is amen for the laodiceans reward to those that overcomes in the laodicean you'll sit with him in the throne glory amen but you know what else benefits you get all the rest amen and one of those that says that you'll what feasts on the hidden manna amen glory what you might not receive here amen you're going to get it over there amen and you think preachers today amen that one day they're going to run out to preach up i don't think so amen the lord is eternal hey man there's always going to be some manna amen and if he's promising manna on the other side then he's got to keep his promise from manna on this side amen glory amen and here in chapter 14 you know again paul changes you know his his pronouns amen he he merges amen the we amen of of verse 11 and 12 with with the you verse 13 through the form of our in verse 14. amen so here you can see paul didn't have an attitude didn't he paul knew the bride i guarantee paul knew he was part of the bride but when he saw the other jews that might have not been bribed but he knew they would be in the city amen and how he could share this gospel and say look we're sharing amen this inheritance amen there's going to be something apart amen that you're going to receive from god but he didn't have the attitude of just i'm bright only i'm bright only when he talked about these four knowledge that did predestinate all of these and all that he wasn't just didn't want them to like it was just bright he wanted to know that everybody that would actually receive the good news of salvation had an opportunity i don't think paul was walking with an attitude amen amen glory to god i believe his desire within his heart maybe at one time yes he lived life where he was killing the christians he was trying to put an end to it a man glory but god got a hold of him amen if god can use a man like that amen my what about my friend what about my other families i mean it's not serving god amen what about my neighbor my co-worker i'd like to look at them and you know what you're going to make it too but i don't know that but if i receive a revelation that oh i i know i'm making it in look if you have a revelation you're going to make it in you're holding a great responsibility to at least share that with that person amen glory i don't you know you have an opportunity to don't you know god loves you you know god didn't choose you to be lost he said i chose unto you salvation you're only lost because you you you choose that way amen you know we've heard it many many many times with grandson you know uh committing adultery he's not sin drinking smoking lying cheating all of this stealing murder he said that ain't you know like that's not sin that's just attribute to sin he said they only do that because they don't believe because they they're choosing that amen amen to look we're living in a world that's so confused that a man wakes up you know and he don't even know if he's a woman or a man he's so confused i don't know if i'm a man today i think i'm a woman amen i was listening to a person give a report where she was from and i can't remember what state it was and they said this happened where we live a ymca amen that a man a man thought he was a woman that day went into the the woman's locker room and took all his clothes off amen to use the locker he was going to go swimming or whatever it was and all those children was in there in that locker room amen and all the other women so one woman got walked out there went to the counter and said i want to make a complaint there's a man in our locker room because he felt like he was a woman that day and you know what the clerk told her she said there's nothing i can do because it's legal it's legal there's nothing we can do it's his right and then they said a woman wanted to go swimming at a some kind of swimming place and he she thought she was a man so she put on her swimming trunks and no t-shirt and all those little kids was there and when they made a complaint they said nothing we can do it's her right it's legal brothers and sisters this is the world you're living in it's confused very confused amen glory i'm glad that god has placed a seal amen this belongs to me this is my property amen satan don't touch her amen glory hallelujah look as soon as we are saved the holy spirit amen begins to what reveal to us some of the riches that are ours in christ amen not in this world but in christ amen glory he gives what he gives us a foretaste amen of the coming glory glory to god amen but how can we be sure amen that we will get the full inheritance someday how are you sure today amen of that because why the holy spirit himself amen is the earnest amen or guarantee amen as the seal amen he guarantees that we ourselves will be kept safely amen for the inheritance hallelujah glory to god as the earnest he guarantees amen hallelujah the inheritance we will we amen will be kept amen safely hallelujah you know sometimes we go through some trials and some tests and it just doesn't seem like that that's what's really going on but don't let the devil lie to you don't never let him you know use those trials that you're going through look god allows those things for a purpose but he'll turn around and as god is allowing it amen but he wants to deceive you the devil wants to deceive you like god don't love you that's why you're going through and here god's only what trying to deepen your roots into the ground so you know when the strong storm comes you're not you know being tossed here and there amen god just you know encouraging you more making you more stronger that way you can handle the next trial amen amen glory so here you know i didn't even give you a title to this sermon but if we're to title it we'll take the title out of that verse there in first peter chapter one amen in verse four amen where it says to un-inheritance incorruptible amen to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled amen and that fadeth not away amen there's your title amen for this sermon to an inheritance uncorrupt incorruptible undefiled and that faith not awake reserved amen look if there's something that god has reserved for you and he's got to get you there god can say hey i've got something for you byler i'll give it to you next month that means that whole 30 days he's got to keep you safe he's got a he's responsible of you amen his responsibility amen look he can't fail he's got oh there's going to be valleys and hills he's going to take you through and this way in that way but he'll get you there because he promised it's reserved amen hallelujah in verse 5 it says who are kept remember here we're talking about where he keeps you safe and verse 5 says who are kept kept by what by the power of the pastor by the deacon the song leader mom and dad is that how your bible reads amen what's it saying amen by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed amen in the last times amen can i take this off is it okay amen glory hallelujah amen glory now look verse 4 and 5 describes what this future aspect of salvation you know when we are born again we have what we have the certain hope of an inheritance in heaven amen as soon as you realize you've been born again amen you begin to realize i belong to god i have an inheritance it's being preserved that means i'll get i'll get there amen by the help of god amen the inheritance includes what all that the believers will enjoy in heaven amen for eternity amen glory to god and all that will be what his through christ amen look at what david said in psalm 16 and verse 5 he said the lord the lord is the portion of mine inheritance amen just this verse right here brother byler the lord could just stop now and not give me nothing but just give me himself glory i i you know if i never receive nothing else from this world hey that's good enough for me because i know who my portion is amen oh world you can keep your whatever you can keep that amen you know i don't want anybody getting me wrong i know you need a job pay the bills amen but god will even supply that hey man don't try to pursue certain things that would draw you away from amen the presence of god amen so here it says now the lord is my is the portion of mine inheritance and he says end of my cup and he says thou maintain us my lot so who who was david putting the responsibility on not himself not on his own people amen he was putting the responsibility on god amen he says the lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup and he says thou maintain us my lot amen that means he gave god all liberty amen all control amen hallelujah and here he says in verse 6 the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places amen yeah he says he says yeah i have i have goodly heritage amen glory to god as for his personal life amen christ's chosen portion and cup is the lord they know all his wealth amen all his wealth and enjoyment rest in god amen amen let me tell you something if you could look at david's life amen i'm sure he could walk into one room in his castle amen or whatever estate he was in and it was a big room probably just full of gold jewelry money you know and he could walk in one room and probably all the things that was collected from here and there from all the great battles and amen he could step on his front porch you know above his estate and he could see a bar off and now exactly you know he could see why all of this is mine he could look down and see his people you can see his horseman's his chariots his my everything that he but he says my wealth amen that's not where his joy was lying amen he didn't stood there like oh my goodness i'm so happy look at everything i've got amen look at my chariots look at my horsemen look at my horses look at the fields hey man look at all the people i rule that one that's not where he put his enjoyment he said he said all my wealth amen and enjoyment rest in god amen it is the lord who guards amen the boundaries of his inheritance amen glory to god you know as he thinks you know of how wisely amen and wonderfully the father has planned every detail amen glory to god of his life he compares it amen to a pleasant estate amen glory now i'm not saying david wasn't happy amen but when you read the book of ma right he was either running from something or he was like he was miserable but even though he was experiencing all of those things amen you can you imagine have you ever read psalms 22 where it first starts out my god my god why thou has forsaken me and that's all a type of christ what christ was going through very beautifully and here what's david doing sharing the same agony that he's going through the same thing amen oh my but when you begin to come down amen to the very middle of that chapter amen and you begin to see david's about to step into something even though he was going through all of that amen in the middle toward the end amen what was he stepping into verse 23 chapter 23 my lord is my shepherd i shall not want amen glory though he had all of those things amen that's not what he was really wanting amen but he knew within himself amen that his portion was the lord so now he had it within himself there was nothing else he wanted david was not pursuing to add more lands amen i never read that in the scripture where david was pursuing to to add more to his collection amen all he wanted was more of christ amen glory to god that's what he wanted more amen of his true inheritance was god amen how many of us is pursuing those kind of things amen amen one more of what god has for us amen about what this world can give look the the lord's gonna use what's out here to so you can survive because he said i'll give you everything you need of he's responsible amen he's responsible of his estate and that's you he's going to make sure that you have everything you need of physically or spiritually amen but when you begin to pursue once then that's all on you amen and sometimes god just sits back and watches you make a fool of yourself oh he'll be back around all he'll learn oh that son of mine you know oh he might be stubborn now but i'll make sure i'll make a way he'll realize amen glory god is good i tell you amen and look if we are living in fellowship with god

is what incorruptible that's what it says and undefiled amen and it says unfading and look incorruptible means that it can never corrode crack or decay amen incorruptible it means that it can never corrode crack or decay what's that really saying it's saying that it's death proof amen your inheritance amen that's that's right here in the scriptures that says amen that it's incorruptible amen hallelujah undefiled and unfading incorruptible it means amen it will never corrode crack or decay it means it's death proof amen glory to god hallelujah but it also says undefiled which means that the inheritance itself is in what perfect condition perfect condition amen that's your inheritance amen it is undefiled what's that that means there's no tarnish or stains it can never what damage purity amen there's nothing like this in the world amen you know some of you are at the age that's probably told your maybe your grandchild or your son hey son one day if the lord tarries i'm i'm might not be here amen and here's your son and he's probably uh 12. you know but you're telling your 12 year old son someday and i want you you show him your 2021 jeep or truck or whatever it is this will be yours you're going to inherit this but by the time you're gone he's in his 50s or 60s amen and he's going to go back to that once used to be brand new truck or whatever it is and it's all cankered with rust and and everything and it's like oh well i inherited it amen i'm glad we don't have to go to god that way amen it's always afresh it's always new amen it will never be stained up amen glory hallelujah amen it'll never tarnish it'll always be pure just as if it was just created minutes ago hallelujah it'll be in perfect condition amen but what's that saying no tarnish no stains can never dim its purity that means it's sin proof it is sin proof amen glory to god how many is glad for justification amen just as you've never done it amen hallelujah then it also says that does not fade away that's what it says it'll never fade away this inheritance amen means that it can never suffer amen variations in value amen or glory or beauty there's nothing amen that will never happen to it that will it will just change you know the value will always be the same amen glory amen glory to god hallelujah now let me tell you something you're very valuable amen and how god thought of you amen before the world ever be begun is is still the same never changes amen if you were his son and daughter amen before the world was ever formed amen and today you're still a son and a daughter of god amen glory and your value never changes amen god saw the conditions of our lives amen can you imagine him there's jesus walking up calvary and then god just stops it and says no i changed my mind i changed your mind you know i i you know i saw i saw them all my was awful he did this and she did that and all my broke my heart oh my and he just stopped calvary no aren't you glad he didn't do that amen glory to god hallelujah that's calvary is what was keeping us in purity calvary is what was going to keep us sin proof amen and death proof amen glory to god then it talks about that it'll never fade away amen the value never loses what's that mean it's time proof oh my every day every week every month you'll look into the mirror maybe a new wrinkle comes amen but look you can look into the very words of god amen and you know something is not changing my flesh might be changing it might be getting weaker each day amen more pain every day hallelujah but i know there's something about me that's time proof amen glory it's eternal it's for eternity that's my inheritance amen glory look don't ever look at this flesh and let it discourage you that's not the real you amen see yourself as god sees you amen glory hallelujah amen and here you know sometimes earthly you know the earthly inheritance are are you know uncertain even at best you know sometimes the value of your house goes up goes down they never know from from day to day from week to week you know one day you get your house appraised and it's probably worth a hundred thousand and one day something's going on and and you get it appraised and it's only worth fifty thousand like they can't make their mind up amen it's just that's just the way this world is amen some there's a will that would be made and an inheritance is falling to you know and then there's one that was never included into the will and then they get a lawyer and they want to fight and that belongs to me too you know i'm glad that don't go on with our lords you know you know it's just it's just never uns certain amen but look at verse five there verse peter chapter one there in verse five where it says who are kept by the power of what of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last times amen and not only in this in there and this inheritance you know is guarded for christians but they are kept they are kept or guarded for it not only that god guards and keeps the inheritance but there's a people that he does guard and keep for that inheritance amen glory put your name there amen hallelujah in this life an heir may die amen before an inheritance is even divided those things happen amen and glory but i believe the same grace that preserves amen the heavenly inheritance preserves us amen as heirs amen to joy to enjoy all of those things amen regardless if god's letting you enjoy it now he's going to let you enjoy it there amen i believe the believer in christ is securely amen is eternally secure amen but i believe now look there is a human side you know but there is a human as well as a divine side to eternal security amen you know we are kept by the power of god you know what that is that is the divine side nobody can tamper with that amen you can you can rest on that amen glory amen but it also says but it is through faith amen see that is the human side you've got to trust also you've got to have faith amen glory to god but here look you know now this doesn't mean that a person is saved only as long as he exercises faith no i believe in exercising faith but just because you exercise faith don't mean i don't really mean a whole lot but i also know god honors faith amen but when there is true faith there will be continuance amen it doesn't stop amen look as long as you have true faith for god you will always then continue to serve him amen there's also responsibility that's been put on us amen and it's not by works that's not what i'm talking about amen we don't make it in by word amen you've got to believe you've got to have faith you've got to trust amen glory to god it's all in him amen glory but saving faith always has what the quality of what permanence amen the child of god is guarded by the power of god for salvation ready to be what revealed amen in the last times amen glory to god and i like the part where there in verse 6 now where it says wherein ye greatly rejoice ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness he says heaviness through manifold temptations oh my so there's gonna be temptations there's going to be trials amen you know there's a scripture in isaiah where it says that no weapon form no weapon that is formed shall prosper amen i mean he's i mean he's hanging on to that promise amen but let me let me show you something in that scripture amen we don't have to turn to it and it says no weapon that is formed now what it says there's no weapon that is for so that means the scripture's not saying that weapons are not formed that means weapons are formed and they do exist and look the devil knows how to form weapons and look and they don't have to be a gun they don't have to be a knife amen they don't have to be a weapon that what you would think amen you think god created those cell phones tablets computers tvs whatever else look they're weapons they're the very things that the satan amen had injected in people's minds and all of a sudden here it is look there's a good side there's a good sight good and evil but the devil knows how to form weapons and sometimes the weapons that he will place in your hands will be such a simple thing and it's not to destroy your neighbor or your whoever it is he'll place it in your hands so you can destroy yourself yeah and he's been doing that hey man look what he did in the first church ages and make those people fall he didn't do that in the second church age he formed something else amen when they come all the way amen even through the dark ages the philadelphia man my god how they suffered my and then here comes laodicean he had to do something different amen yep he had to do something completely different and you know what he did he formed a weapon to where he could sit back and say i'll just watch them destroy themselves i'll let technology get so further you know and mine they're going to go after that and i'll just watch them kill time and get so caught up and amen a different type of tactic oh they'll get so lazy and they'll hey man remember the what was it is a german the one that hit his shoe on the curse of it or is that how do you say his name kush yeah remember the prediction he hey man the things that he said i can't quote it but if you look it up and read it you're gonna like whoa that's that's where i'm truly living in amen he talked about communism amen socialism and he said he will feed what he will feed socialism like slowly in there or something like that he said he said you will also become like like just ripe fruits that would fall in our hands things like that you know like i said i you know you go look it up go home amen and then it's mentioned there how how the government is breaking down the different things all the way to now all the way to what biden's doing amen all right it's going home time and then i mean he's wanting this inheritance i want this inheritance say man look and it's all him it's all god amen i want him amen glory to god look when we go into that city amen and stuff but it's not the moon's not going to be giving your light and the sun's not going to get in your life but there's going to be one up there on that pyramid on the very top amen that's christ in it he's going to be the light amen hallelujah glory praise god so here it's talking about manifold temptations amen because of this hope of of the the redemption of the body and the glorious inheritance believers can what greatly rejoice even in the midst of trials amen the christians to whom peter was writing were what they were suffering they were suffering persecutions because of what the testimony they had for christ amen and it's the same thing we suffer from amen people don't want nothing to do with you there's some would like to pull a gun and just shoot you they don't even know you and hate every bone in your body amen peter reminds them of one amen of the one of the delightful amen paradox of christianity joy in the midst of sorrow amen he says on the one hand they can rejoice amen amen in the prospect of what kept inheritance for a capped people amen hallelujah and on the other hand they can find joy amen in the knowledge that the various trials amen are only what for a little why whereas the glory will be what forever amen for our light amen second corinthians chapter 4 verse 17 says for our light this is paul speaking here can you look at paul's life and what he went through in the trials he was going through the suffering he was going through and then he says it like this for our life affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory he called what he was going through has anybody here going through what paul went through no would you like to no hey man but if i ever have to i want to stand up like paul and say light affliction amen and say it like he did for our light affliction which is but for a moment but worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal way of glory amen whatever circumstances you go through amen there is nothing that the devil or god would allow the devil to put on you amen that's going to be greater than what you're going to enjoy over there amen glory and after reading the terrible afflictions which you know apostle paul actually endured amen it may seem hard to for us to even understand how he could even say or speak of them as light afflictions mine let me tell you something in one sense they were not at all light amen they were bitter and cruel that the more he suffered amen the more amen the grace of god hallelujah was made available for others amen and we should think the same way glory to god the more people who were saved the more thanksgiving ascended to god amen hallelujah i mean many would like to win the soul of your neighbor your co-worker your friends your family amen just to know that more thanksgiving is going to ascend to god regardless where they're at in the city amen hallelujah and the more thanksgiving ascended to god the more god was glorified amen hallelujah let's glorify him amen look the afflictions viewed by themselves might be ever so heavy amen but when compared amen with the eternal weight of glory that lies ahead then yes you can say it's light if that's all you're looking to is the very inheritance that you're receiving then whatever's going on here you can say it's light it's only for a while dispute shall pass amen glory to god hallelujah also the light affliction is but what for a moment whereas glory is what eternal i hallelujah what i'm going to enjoy over there brothers and sisters it's for eternity what i suffer down here with it's just for a moment hallelujah glory to god you know and in second corinthians chapter 4 verse 18 it says while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things amen which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen to be able to see the first we're talking about in here in this verse this verse the very first thing that's talking about is what is sight it's your natural sight amen but paul brings something else in here that has to do what the insight there's an insight amen glory to god and as we go back to that blind man amen that jesus healed he didn't just you know after he could really see naturally he didn't pursue to search out the world because now he could see naturally he could see amen this is a man that was born blind but he didn't run there and here to go pursue because he wanted to walk know the whole world you know what he never even left this town but something within him there was faith amen and then all of a sudden it was the insight that was really you know because here you know what his neighbors wasn't even sure is this the man was this the man that was laid out they couldn't even recognize him or then how is it that now he could see when they could just praise god and said wow this man is healed praise the lord nope that was the neighbors amen but then when the mom and dad was questioned what did they say oh yeah this is our sound yes we know we cared for him you know from birth till now we're the ones that laid him out there and said him you know and yeah we can't deny this is our son but about him receiving his sight you know what they said he's of age ask him when they could have just like we don't know but we thank the lord praise god there was a day he was blind and now he can see no he's a beach ask him amen but look this blind man that could see now naturally and he didn't run here and he says i want to go to the next town i want to see what it looks like i want to go to the ocean i want to see what it looks like he didn't spend his time pursuing trying to do the research because now he could physically see but something inside of him it was the inside that was one that you know and then the more they route him up first they were calling the man jesus prophet that's what he was calling him right he had an insight that he could see him as a prophet amen and the more they rowed him amen the more they just bugged him and bugged him even to the time they said why don't you just give god praise because he's the one that really you know opened your eyes not that man i mean if you know the story you know what i'm talking about amen but then all of a sudden the more the man was riled the more the inside the more the faith see was working it was the inside from prophet then he went to what son of god all right now that's faith there from prophet amen to just probably a natural man when he was blind he knew somebody spoke to him he knew a man stepped up and spoke to him and put something in his eye and told him to go wash then when he opened his eyes he probably looked back to see who was and even if jesus was still standing there he would have never knew who it was amen but his faith because where there's true faith there is confession and at first he confessed by his insight that he was a prophet and the more he the more he was working brother bob amen then he began to the inside began to confess that he was the son of god and when they had enough of him because you know now he begin to get bold amen so here who are you to tell us these things we have the word we have moses yeah who are you where you were just just now beginning a scene and you can tell us these things and talk to us like that yeah let me tell you his insight was it was growing amen he wasn't worried about the rest of the world and what he could see out there but he knew amen he knew he said there was a time i was blind and i can't now i can see that's all i can tell you that was his testimony and it was constantly that every time they asked it i told you over and over again amen and he he began to tell him he said you're asking me all this like as if you're trying to learn something so are you trying to be his disciples are you trying to be a disciple a disciple means a learner well they didn't like that i mean they blamed him for being a disciple a follower of jesus and they say don't you know that man is a criminal he's evil he's breaking the law which he did it on the sabbath day but all he knows something supernatural happened and he wasn't trying to figure it out up here he wasn't trying to figure it out with his natural eyes he didn't go running to some school somewhere or some philosopher or some whatever that had thd or whatever it is i want to understand this no there was an insight growing there was just something bubbling from a prophet from a regular man to a prophet amen to thou son of god then when he was finally kicked out and jesus heard of this what did jesus do the bible says jesus just went to go for it when he was kicked out that that man amen look something happened to him you would have thought he would have been going around and says uh i heard of a man the pharisees they called him jesus they all of this all where is this man where's you know there's no scriptures where he looks for him but when he got kicked out the bible says jesus went and looked for him amen let me tell you something you belong to him amen he's going to go after you amen glory but when jesus you know he didn't introduce to him jesus didn't say i was the one that did all this hello you know i'm introducing my how are you doing i'm jesus you know and i i spat on the ground and did this the first thing he said he says do you believe in the son of god he didn't even say do you believe i am right when he approached him he didn't say do you believe i am the son of god he just asked a man because as god already knew there was an insight in him that was growing he professed that he was what a prophet to a son of god then he go and says do you believe in the son of god and he says i don't even know who he is and all that and he says i am him then he could say i am him he made sure that the man could make a confession but he confessed right didn't he he says i don't know who he is where is he amen and when jesus said i am he my glory you know sometimes god has a way of revealing himself amen but you know when jesus did that the man was not far away from the pharisees when you read the end of the the scripture the chapter that they were both standing in the midst of the pharisees and the scribes they heard their conversation they heard jesus standing there asking him do you believe in the son of god and then jesus there tells him i'm the son of god so you know what they did they went up to jesus and said are you saying we're blind amen it says are you saying that we're blind amen and you know what jesus he was giving them an opportunity jesus said if you can confess that you are blind then you have hope but because you say you can see amen because that was their attitude they they knew it all they see it all i am this i'm that amen we're the ones that holds the the scrolls and you know they they've reached a place of no compassion for the people look they were not presenting gospel they were presenting law and then they had their thumbs on the uh you know on the people the do's and the don'ts and the and you know a lot of their laws brother was oral laws amen you know some of the laws that actually end up over there was because of oral laws because of way back in the past where they had word laws and because grandpappy had it like this word role and then when the next generation come they kind of twisted it amen next generation come it's a little bit different and then finally it comes to that day and all it all became oral law they wasn't even word law anymore that's happening today or a law amen and we need to go back to original word law amen glory to god but that's what they said you know are you saying we're blind amen because they thought they were really somebody amen i like that when jesus said you know well if you confess that you are blind then you have hope amen but he said because you say you can see amen glory but here's a man that was could not even see for all those years and now he can but he didn't pursue the natural sight amen look brothers and sisters i can see today amen even though i still got to use this amen but i can see one day this will not be here anymore praise the lord amen but i'm glad that i had an insight there's a spark there amen glory to god hallelujah like the eagle and the chicken barn amen when he heard that cry amen that's me glory that's where i belong hallelujah glory amen you know just to close in verse seven now it says that the trial of your faith there in uh first peter chapter 1 verse 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold amen amen that perisheth through he says though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor amen in glory at the appearing of jesus christ true faith amen is indestructible i believe that amen if you have true faith amen glory to god there's nothing the devil could ever interfere with that amen hallelujah look the believer may undergo severe tests and trials amen but instead of destroying his faith they become what food amen the faith to feed on glory to god look at job there amen job says you know though he slayed me yet will i trust in him amen but he says but i will maintain my own ways before him job probably you know here sustained amen heavier losses amen in one day than any other man amen in history but he could stand there and say yet amen though he slay me oh glory to god yet amen will i trust in him glory to god look at the three hebrew children what were they what were they tested by real fire amen glory to god and they were victorious amen and there was a fourth man to keep him company in there amen and what a company to have they had someone there that was likened to what son of god hallelujah amen glory to god what an inheritance amen verse 8 it says whom having not seen ye loved in whom though now ye ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory amen hallelujah you know peter now discusses what the present enjoyment of our salvation christ taken by faith amen how many is enjoying our salvation amen and i know there was a time a man you know david wasn't lost or anything like that but he lost the joy of the salvation and he said lord restore there is something about that salvation amen why because it was part of that inheritance let me enjoy that amen hallelujah you know there was a i was is it okay to read quote close it out amen you know i've i've preached before i'm not saying that's the way it is here but i have like brother you did really full you didn't fully preach the message i said what do you mean because well you didn't even read one quote amen but you know hallelujah amen let me just share something with you here in the in the in the revelations the chapter 5 1961 brother branham says if you've got an inheritance here in this world friend he says it's a corruptable inheritance amen but we receive an inheritance that fadeth not away he says the prodigal son went away amen and left his inheritance and he took part he took part of it with him when he returned back his inheritance was defiled by the ground somebody's natural inheritance but when he talks about us but he says but if you've run away from yours it's not so amen with the kingdom of god we receive an incorruptible inheritance amen hallelujah but we have an incorruptible inheritance that is salvation redemption and go back to the garden even again think of it lord who wouldn't want to go back like adam and eve amen and live back there amen he says our food provided each day that's because god was responsible for adam and eve's protection provision and even entertainment whatever it is that entertain them god was responsible for that you know how the world got their provision and entertainment and security and all of that from kane go all the way back to genesis it was his sons amen hallelujah they're the ones and but the thing is the very things that cain and his sons brought to the world and to them it was good enough and that's why they could say we don't need you no more lord look cain was kicked out kicked out even he knew that was going to be a hard thing for him why because he enjoyed the ground you know what his curse was that the ground would not yield no seed is that what his curse was what did he enjoy the most the ground that's why he offered the fruits of the ground to onto his sacrifice that's what he loved to do and when god took it away and he said if you plant another seed into that ground it will not grow it will not yield [Music] hey man that was his curse and he said he said now that's a hard thing that was something he enjoyed amen glory to god so they don't don't think of it strange when there's something you're enjoying out there and you're getting away from the presence of god and god just like snatches it away from you it says you belong to me straighten up if that's hindering you then i'm taking it away amen so don't don't think of it you know but that's the very thing cain did enjoy god says this is what i'll do but look cain was given an opportunity too amen he was only lost because he chose that way but there he is he did survive then he had sons amen and then they brought in the cattle that's their provision amen they're you know their food and then he had a son that was that knew how to make tents and all of that and now they had a a roof over their heads and then when it came to their security he had another son that was good in the uh making things out of brass and iron and now they have boards spears and whatever it is and whatever else he made forks spoons plates and but that was what that was the negative thing outside of the positive it wasn't god's idea amen hallelujah but look we're going to go back rebrand talks about who wouldn't want to go back to that life where god walked with you in the cool of the day and fellowship with you amen hallelujah glory you know there's a scripture in the bible where he was talking about i pray for them but i don't pray for the world amen now the world was not people it was cosmos i pray for them i'm praying for the people jesus i'm praying for them for the people i'm not praying for the world that's the negative side amen that's outside the ideas of god god had an idea that cain's idea was outside of the ideas of god and it was negative amen glory look one day we will not need a job amen i won't have to come home from working hard and i need a bed to rest on amen glory hallelujah i'll never have to take a tylenol ibuprofen aleve or aspirin or whatever it is i'll never have to give another shot to my body for insulin or anything because i've got diabetes or whatever it is you every anybody's god amen it's it's it's man's but it was never meant to be i'm being restored amen as you read in the book of joel being restored amen glory and you know what else joel says when it talks about then there's a scripture in there and it says then i will heal their land but because that word says then that means above that something has to be done and then i will heal there oh so that means there's a responsibility that we got to do and you know what he says he says until the ministers and the priests fall on their face and pray cry out amen then he says then i'll heal their land oh how many ministers today or priests amen and you're saying well i'm not a priest ah that's not what says there in the book of peter you're what the priesthood amen hallelujah we hold a responsibility of the priesthood amen then i'll heal their land well we got we got to get busy brother but how many of us has actually gotten away from those personal devotions amen with god amen that you go in your prayer closet and just really fall on your face and say papa god would you help them help these group here in that group there lord help help my my father my mother my brother my sister really just cry out to god and amen oh when we can come back to that let me tell you something you'll see god just gonna see people walking to these doors you would have never thought whatever came back amen god's gonna take away pride amen and they'll be able to just walk in here wrong run to these altars amen i believe the spirit's still gonna be poured out amen oh glory amen we better start working out brother byler we got to get ready amen glory but i believe there is a restoring amen but here he's saying now think of it lord who wouldn't want to go back like adam and eve and amen and live back there our food provided each day a heavenly father always along the trail talking to us amen see that great light walking before us amen he says the lion and the wolf feeding together bullock eating the straw and lying eating with him but when now they eat one another amen or the lion eats the bulldog and wolf eats the ball up whatever he can eat amen but them days it won't be that way amen the great beautiful birds flying amen there'll be no sorrow there'll never be a marked amen i mean a maker that we a marker amen that we pass over our hopes amen down along the trail there we'll see our children and loved ones amen hallelujah oh god what a day amen what a day no matter what we we receive here on earth it's all going to fade away but that won't fade away amen amen he mentions that scripture in ephesians 1 11 amen in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of of him whom worketh all things after the council amen of his own will he says brother neville forgive me for taking this time that word inheritance he says oh he says it's got to oh he said he was getting excited he says i know he says it's my kinsman brother amen he says i hope i'm not crazy he says i don't think i am but oh my a what an inheritance we have obtained an inheritance somebody has to leave you something god before the foundation of the world left you something amen he says a name a name written on the book that when the lamb would be slain be recognized with it amen hallelujah oh wow glory amen and he was talking about their 1960 the adoption series amen number three amen he says inheritance by what predestination he says i inherited something what inheritance where he says there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance why you say jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon says jesus never left me an inheritance jesus never left you in inheritance he only came down and paid for the inheritance amen brought you to your inheritance all glory to god he says but your name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world god gave you your inheritance amen glory to god god by his foreknowledge seen amen in the adoption again exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved he sent jesus to save those that he had already chosen amen didn't paul say five verses behind this that he chose us in him before there even was a world amen that's
