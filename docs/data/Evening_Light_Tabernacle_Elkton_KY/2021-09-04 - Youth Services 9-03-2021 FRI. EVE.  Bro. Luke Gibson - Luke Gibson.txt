we are able to squeeze this in this year because that's kind of what we're doing i know the covet's going around and and so there's a lot of people leery of it but we haven't had a lot of it around here so i know it is different places so we do ask everybody to be careful if you feel sick at all uh that you would not come amen because we certainly don't want to spread anything and we do appreciate those who are taking precautions just to watch it a little bit but our ultimate faith is in the lord jesus christ somebody believes that but we're looking forward to a good time in the lord amen and i believe after uh you know i know it's always kind of a time of winding down for us here at the church especially and those who are getting everything together all of us sometimes you have so much on your mind that you really need to just stop and say lord i'm just shutting in with you now and laying down all the cares and the worries about whether this is done or whether that's done amen because the ultimate thing that we're looking for is for the lord jesus christ to come unto amen just let his presence be felt amen amen how many wants to just make jesus welcome amen just make jesus welcome amen and to speak to our hearts through his minister amen brother luke gibson he's our minister this weekend we certainly appreciate him coming up amen and those who came with them and

you'd help us to set aside all the cares and all the all the anxieties father that anybody might have lord and just to be able to bask in your presence and say lord jesus come now father and speak to us lord and father we pray for the services coming up most of all father this is the highlight it's god to be able to hear your word lord jesus everything else is temporal but father we know it when we hear your word it is eternal lord it's the only thing of value and we ask god that you'd help us lord to ask in your presence and lord that the minister father would be welcomed lord jesus thus gift would be welcomed and pulled on father and that lord it would bring down your presence lord jesus until perhaps we would even see a pillar of fire lord jesus we come with great expectation lord knowing god that we don't just come to get together not just get together and visit each other and different things but we calm god to have you to change us lord go from here after this weekend we'll lord not be the same as what we were before we came lord we'll be a little bit more like you will see the reflection of christ a little more in our lives lord others will be able to see a greater

house of the lord it's just good to be a christian tonight always good to be in the service of the lord and you know believe this or not i've been going to church since i've been eight days year old i've been going to church even when i don't remember going to church my mommy had me and one week later they said i was in church i was in a pentecostal old-fashioned tent meeting took me out to the service and i used to be have to be made to go to church i'm glad my parents made me go to church but i sure love it when god gave me the holy ghost and i wanted to go to church amen i am certainly happy to be here tonight in the service of the lord and just want to take a moment say thank you to your pastor for first of all for having this meeting been willing to have a meeting like this at times like we're living in and then giving us the privilege of the invite to be able to be here to fellowship around the word of the lord i've been doing my best for the last 23 years in south carolina to shorten the generational gap i believe the young people face battles that i don't face maybe as a 51 year old man or someone else faces a 70 year old man but i do believe that the gospel message to the young and the old is exactly the same message so i won't change that i have seven children two of my children are with me tonight zechariah and abigail and then my wife is with me also and then my oldest grandson is with me as well i got five grandkids now been 15 years i think since i've been here 14 or 15 years none of my children were married but now they've given me five grandkids and i got another one on the way and if i knew them grandkids were going to be so much fun i would have had them first i tell everybody i love seeing my grandkids come they live next door to me i love seeing them come over to the house but i sure love seeing when they leave amen so but tonight god don't have no grandchildren the prophet of god said all he has the sons and daughters and the only way that we can get into him is we have to be borned into him by the holy ghost so we still believe in old-fashioned holy ghost message amen we certainly um do appreciate the lord tonight i was born for this kind of an atmosphere singing don't bother me music don't bother me somebody's screaming amen don't bother me i don't even get nervous when people shout i i like to see people enjoy what they have i mean we go the ball games people scream like crazy and then we come to church and people get quiet as a church mouse i got a boy back there when he was a kid we were at that six flags i believe it's called six flags over georgia and i did i never have liked them stupid roller coaster i think that's all temptation tempting god you know that stuff but i he told me so daddy come ride with not just kidding when i say that you know but i had he told me daddy come ride with me i said no oh come on daddy ride so i decided i'd get on there with him and they they make it go real slow going up it's kind of just anticipation when you get the top he told me to lift my hands up and i lift my hands i'm going to drop down the other side son you talk about screaming my stomach went down in my belly when we get off that ride i said now look son if you can scream like that on a ride that don't take you nowhere when you get to the house of god on sunday you better have your hands up you better be worshiping god amen for gospel that's taken us somewhere amen brother danny williams how many has ever heard of brother danny williams you know brother daniel he told me when i was 21 years old had his first set of kids that were twins he told me something that stuck with me my whole life and i want to say this tonight that all seven of my children are serving the lord been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that's to me i'm a blessed man for that but what brother danny told me was he said brother call me in his office one day down in louisiana i was 21 years old i'll never forget these words it was like a knife into my heart and he said these words he said don't you dare go around the world and try to win the world and lose your own family and man that has stuck with me and i have done everything i can to not be a legalist but i've tried to make my children realize how wonderful it is to serve christ my my children has never ever in 20 almost 29 years the oldest are have never had to ask mom and daddy are we going to church that wasn't a question around my house when it was church time we went to church amen so it's good to be in church tonight amen now i want you to turn with me if you would as you're standing i want to just make a confession i'm going to do my best to preach in the simplest and most practical terms i can because they said i'm preaching to young people and young people you're going to love me for this i'm going to try to also preach short i'm going to try to preach short messages but i want to get right to the point i don't want to drag it out i want to just get my thought i have struggled i prayed i've asked god or which way would you like me to go and just i just want to obey him if i could and just talk to you from my heart what god has laid on it so luke chapter 22 i want to read verse 31 and verse 32. i didn't know do y'all put scripture okay all right um luke 22 beginning with verse 31 and we'll read 31 and 32. now i'm going to take my jacket off and i don't mean i'm preaching a long time i don't have a what but i see a clock back there and that's a good thing it's like you you've heard the story of the old pentecostal boy talk the catholic kid and they're going to church with him so if you come to me i'll go to mass with you you ever heard that and so the little pentecostal boy went to the catholic church and the priest you know he did something like this and the old pentecost boy said what's that he'd tell him and then he dipped his finger in the water and did something else said what's that then he rubbed some beans he said what's that head keep asking about everything going on so finally the catholic boy went to the pentecost aboard the church and the preacher got to preach him he'd pick up his watch and look at set it back down and he'd preach along her pick up his watch and look and set it back down and preach along pick up his watch set it back down find a cat boy had an upset what does that mean when he picks up his watch he said absolutely nothing i don't want that to be your experience tonight luke 22 beginning with verse 31 and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat i love this but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when not if but when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren can we pray tonight father we thank you for your word lord i thank you for the privilege to stand here at the sacred desk again and lord to speak to the young audience tonight that has made efforts to come into your presence we thank you for brother william and the songs that he sung and led us tonight in worship and brought us into your presence now father we pray that you take these next few moments oh god speak to every heart lord we want to go out of this place closer to you and what we were when we came in we desire lord for the flashlight of your presence to shine upon every heart and lord if there be some way in us that's not like you or not pleasing to you we pray o god that your power of transformation would come lord only you can change us we can do things to make ourselves better but lord only you have the power and the ability to change our lives we pray you do that tonight speak to every heart on this opening service we'll give you praise for all things in the name of the lord jesus christ and everybody says you young people shake somebody's hand a couple of hands one or two and just tell them that say god bless you problems that's the greatest thing you say somebody's god bless you and then you may be seated god bless you brother god bless you brother william our scene tonight opens with what is known as the upper room jesus had just broke bread with his disciples in what we would call the last supper really it's known as the last supper but it's really to us the first communion it was here that jesus had girded himself with a towel knelt down in the most humbling like a what the prophet would call in the sense of a foot washing flunky humility is what he displayed in that room that night and he washed the disciples feet it was here the disciples had this final moment of solitude just them and the lord jesus i think in my heart what a blessing that must have been to have maybe we would have been like peter and shocked just to think that jesus would kneel down there and attempt to wash his feet when we would think no no no let us wash your feet but jesus said that the son of man came not to be served but to serve the property god made a comment that was never a man that ever lived like jesus matter of fact he said that eternal life was not living for yourself but it was living for others jesus was the greatest example of a man who fully gave his life for each one of us tonight i remember one day jesus was you know he always somehow made the religious crowd angry the bible says that he was a a friend of sinners the religious people were uncomfortable with him but it seemed like sinners felt this comfortable to surround him because jesus wasn't a condemning person he was a man that had compassion on them that were lost one day they were so upset with him the bible said they took up stones to stone and he said for what good work that you stole me they said thou being a man maketh thyself god but they were wrong jesus was not a man making himself god he was god who made himself a man and he was the greatest display of what god would want to be if he were to become a man and he did in the person of the lord jesus christ after that setting then all of a sudden jesus stops and he looks to peter but this time he doesn't call him peter he says simon simon behold satan has desired to help you that he may sift you as wheat now you know when jesus called peter originally he was simon bart jonah but do you know in matthew chapter 16 when jesus asked the disciples it finally came to place that his ministry was such displayed that he turned the disciples said hey who do men say i the son of man am they said well some say you're this and john the baptist elias jeremiah's on the prophets but then he stopped saying but who do you say i am and it was then that simon spoke out and said thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus stopped and said simon barjona blessed are you flesh and blood hath not give you this but my father which is in heaven have to give you this look jesus was a flesh man so he himself didn't even give simon that revelation he attributed the revelation that simon had that came from the father then he stopped and he said but i said unto thee thou art peter he didn't call him simon he called him peter and do you know that for the rest of his ministry with peter jesus never called him simon only would refer to him as peter but this night in that supper room he doesn't turn to him and say peter peter he says simon simon satan have desired to help you that he may sift you as weak now remember it was this simon that said you're the christ the son of the living god it was also this simon that said lord don't just watch my hands and feet watch me all the way through then jesus stopped and said look behold look behold simon simon satan had desired to help you listen to that brother that ought to tell you something i'm going to tell you something right the closer you get to god the more the enemy's going to come after you i hear people say well the devil don't never bother me that's because you don't never bother him you go to you make up your mind and i i'm going to pray more i'm going to listen to tapes more i'm going to go to church more you watch all hell turn loose on you the devil will come after you with everything he's got because every time there's you make a step and get closer to god satan's going to do his best to try to drive you away from that presence but listen to this he says satan have desired to have you listen to that satan not to kill you but to have you that he may sift you as wheat now watch this because at the end of the word wheat is where you see that little colon which means the thought isn't done here comes a really big word that jesus uses and he said but i have prayed for thee listen to that satan want you but i have prayed for you he desires to sit to his weak but i i'm gonna get to that simon in a minute but he said but i have prayed for thee but in spite the fact that the devil may have to be after tonight i have prayed for you in spite that the satan desires to sift you i have prayed for you for the fact that the devil would like to take you back in the world jesus said i have prayed for you and brother in the times the trials and testings of life when the battles are raging in your young heart you want to remember one thing there's somebody on your side and of god before you who can be against you but i'd rather have jesus praying for me than anybody i know because tonight he is at the right hand of the father the bible said he's ever living to make intercession upon the confessor of the saints there's somebody on our side hallelujah that's already got the keys of death hell in the grave i like what oh brother howard carroll said one time poor old devil don't even have the keys to his own house jesus has got those keys can you say praise the lord but i want to remember this simon simon i have prayed for you that your faith failed not now look at this when he refers to him assignment it's obvious that jesus has referred to the man before he had a revelation think about that he's talking to the man and what it is of satan like brother baptist says i'm going to say it to you young people tonight when you get there back to the holy ghost and god sealed you in the kingdom the devil can't unsave what god has saved the devil can't even unseal what god has sealed when god sealed you with the holy spirit you're sealed for all time and all of eternity but he can come after your flesh your flesh isn't converted your flesh ain't saved that's why you've got to confident the holy spirit and you take your body and throw it shut to the word of god brethren said satan's got one punch coming at every one of us tonight but when you get the holy ghost that's the keeping power that's the staying power that what keeps you anchored to christ so he says to simon satan has desired to have you that he may sip to his wheat and i'm going to finish that thought in a minute but stay here but no no no and when you are converted strengthen not if you are but when you are converted strengthened by brethren i'd like to take for just a few minutes tonight by the help of god while i have your undivided attention i'd like to speak on this being sifted in satan's eden being sifted satan seen it's amazing to me that when i look at the scripture all of the illustrations and the things that god could use to show this traumatizing experience this trial this test that you remember when you become a christian even if you got saved tonight and you go home and you boys had a dog and you got saved and you go home night the dog's gonna bark at you differently everything turns on you when you get saved like a boy told me one time say look i serve god if i could get rid of my friends i said oh no you deserve god they'll get rid of you you ain't got to get rid of nothing you just surrender god and it all take care of itself like people say oh if i could just do right i'd come and get saved if i could clean my life up and all come just like you are he's got enough power to change you lift you out of my set your feet on a rock change your life for the power of the holy spirit you ain't got to do nothing he'll do it all it will just surrender to him but think about it wheat he desires to sift you as wheat now wheat while it's growing endures a lot of storms out there in the field it endures a lot of fervent heat coming from the sun yes it does while it's growing and maturing it endures winds and weather and all kinds of different things the wheat has to go through over and over but only one time listen to me closely in that wheat's life is sifted there comes a time that that wheat will go through a lot of things but then there will come a time that that we will face what it feels like the greatest test the greatest trial and it wonders within itself how am i going to make it it's like the prophet we talked about job the statement he used was job was a renowned man then he said satan had desired to sift him and try him then brother batman said that all christians believers they're tried every son that cometh to god must be tried and chasing every son of god like job we face our storms hey we got different trials no question different temptation different cold times and hot times and a lot of winds and our ups and our downs and our pressures and we go through a lot of different things in our christian experience but every one of us will have to come a time that we face the sifter listen close because you're living now in satan's eden how many y'all's ever heard that message right you're not in god's eden you're in satan's eden satan in the beginning came down into god's eden and the prophet said beat adam to his wife they were fortified behind the walls of the word and the prophet said lucifer climbed under the walls of the word and vicariously through the serpent beat adam to his wife am i right then adam took her to himself and in her womb was two seeds adams and the serpent right and god's eden plunged the entire human race in the death and we fell because of adam's decision now for six thousand years satan has been making his own eden and the property god actually says satan has had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats to be god now we are living in satan's eden and let me tell you what happened when the serpent got to eve her womb was still open so adam was able to get his seed in there before that wound closed up now we're in satan's eden let me give you some consolation night god came down satan's heathen and he's beat satan to this bride and you know what he did he pregnanted you in this hour but brother bothered when he pregnanted us young people he doesn't leave your womb open for satan to get to you when he pregnant you he closes the womb up and seals you in there by the holy ghost so that satan can't never get to you glory to god when a man's born to god the bible said he does not commit sin that means he can't even disbelieve no more because that soul is sealing it with christ yeah there's going to come a lot of battles yes there's going to come a lot of trial yes there's going to come a lot of testing but i'm here tonight to tell you there's an anchor down that soul that sometime when you feel like you can't make it another day there's a tie post down there that'll hold you to christ thank god for the holy ghost and i've seen over the last few years some are not making it i'm not here to paint a bad picture but i just want to tell you friends close friends of mine preachers are dropping off like flies maybe oh how can i say it maybe we depend on our gift our ability to sing our ability to preach i ain't saved because i preach but i thank god i ain't going to heaven because the way i preach if i would i wouldn't get very far i'm going to heaven because somebody paid a price for me i'm going to heaven because somebody called me always somebody justified me somebody sanctified me somebody baptized me with the holy ghost and i'll tell you something else in the mind of god he's already glorified me but you realize without this conversion this tie post if you're depending on anything else to hold you you're not going to make it and i'm not here to tell you but i've seen people come down to that hour existing where they come down facing the greatest battle if that tide post ain't there drags them away they get over in that realm of reasoning and they start freezing oh brother look i can be more plainer they reason this message out they're trying to figure things out hey god didn't call me to figure this out god told me to believe this message god called you to believe this man i don't want to tell with that crowd you know maybe tomorrow night god willing i'm gonna preach a message on the web not not the internet but the web satan's web like a spider but there's so many caught up in that thing don't get ahead of myself but brother satan's got guns aimed at every one of you young people before i get in my whole subject i'm going to tell you somebody's prayed for you somebody's interceding for you somebody's watching over you it ain't luke gibson it ain't brother byler it ain't brother branham though i i have great respect for my prophet there's somebody greater than all of us watching over you and his name's jesus praise be to god some ain't making it but there is some that is allowing the pressure of the sifter to work on them and i see what you prayed a while ago some of the immaturities taken out of us i see some here's a word some of the green is starting to be faked out of us the sincerity and the sacredness and the attributes of the holy spirit and some of us are allowing ourselves to go through that scepter and just submit to the pressure of god and submit to the trial and all of a sudden you're starting to see some greenness go out listen now and some gold must come in some some golden ripe harvest wheat brother can't you hear the night by the ears of the holy ghost the combine out there coming he's coming to take this wheat home into the garner and in this meeting when it's done all i know is i want to be one step closer like enoch to the coming of the lord jesus when he comes i want to go with him now the scepter going through the scepter everybody tonight i want you young people be with me now the scepter say sifter the scepter going to the scepter is very hard let me give you a couple of things that's going to happen number one when you go through the scepter the pressure is going to get heavy it's going to get healthy it's not going to be like when you first got saved man you was the most happiest thing you there was you didn't think god he was unsaved you didn't see nobody's fault you served god a while you start maturing the pressure's coming on and satan's goal is what jesus said to make your faith fail the devil wanted peter's watch peter's faith to fail but jesus didn't say peter's faith would fail he said simon simon brother i don't care what the devil done he couldn't have never got peter you went after simon he'll go after your flesh because he can't touch your soul are y'all listen to me it's in this sister the wheat oh glory it's been so pressured that when god's gone it comes out like bread god allows this to take you as a wheat and when he's done he'll make himself a loaf of bread and he'll take your life and make you a blessing to others [Music] he'll use your life as a testimony to tell somebody like we're surrounded night by great calories i looked back to the old temp see them great calories i said if abraham could have faith for 25 years surely i could have faith for some little kidney stone the devil attacked me with if that man could be 25 years surely i can believe 25 hours that's right i think about what shadrach meshach and abednego daniel all them old saints back there brother they weren't no different brother butler if you was back there your life could have possibly been one of the characters of the bible they wasn't like superheroes they were men and women would like passing just like we are but they had a faith in their heart they surrendered to god amen and he took their life and pinned it in there as examples to us if god would be with them god will be with us if god can take them through god can take us through if they can have faith we can have faith if they can walk in the lion's den and shut his mouth we can walk in the lines again if they can take shadrach meshach and abednego some in the fiery furnace and not even come out with a smell of smoke on him don't you think he's still jesus christ the safe yesterday today and forever [Music] sure he is it'd be good for them he can do it for us yes the pressure is going to get heavy on you during the sifting time listen now in those times some of you been there so you know what i'm talking about it's going to be hard to pray yes sir everything jesus says to peter he could have said to him he didn't say peter i'm standing with you i'm standing by you i'll be right there standing for you no he said i'll be praying for you because when you're going through the sifter the pressure mount so much seems like from above below left right everywhere just seem like everywhere you turn you find yourself on your face it's so you're so much pressure sometimes you can't already feel like you can even pray you feel like you need god more than ever but you can't find him it seemed like at times that you even uttered words but it didn't go beyond the ceiling until one prophet said the heavens become like brass matter of fact i'll say what brother man said god literally lays silent on you what's happening when you're going through that septic and you feel you can't get a prayer through don't you ever forget sitting at the right hand of the father if somebody get a prayer through for you and that's why i said peter i'll be praying for you what an encouragement number three let me give this to you now hurry the third thing is not only more pressure hard to pray but the process of sifting listen to me hurts don't ever let nobody tell you it don't hurt it hurts no one has ever faced the scepter but has to admit this hurts i talked to a man last night from south africa brother what he told me where his life is at i thought my god this man stood beside me traveled with me now as left as wife living with another woman walked away from the message you can't tell me that don't hurt there's times you face things that simply hurt i wonder tonight could i borrow that microphone if we could pull no don't turn it on just leave it off if you would it's just an illustration if we'd call the wheat and we'd ask that wheat just before it sifted we'd say that we come we testify tell us what it's like the first thing that little wheat would say oh they cut me down out of the field say i used to think i could stand tall now i'm flat on my back as if god is taking me down and i'm nothing they take me through this process they literally have beat me they beat me beyond recognition then i'm battered so that the shaft would just scatter away what they what they put me through i'm here scattered there and yonder i'm just tore to pieces and i'm shaking and i'm put through a grinder and then i put through a shift and all i can say is from beginning to end this all hurt me in a way and i never dreamed that serving god could hurt me and i would venture to say tonight some of you has not been there yet but i would like to say there are some here that can tell you i laid on my pillow until i feel my pillow with tears at night with what god has permitted me to go through the pressure got so heavy that i thought being dead would be better than being alive what's god doing to me he's allowing me to be sifted god uses that sifter oh my so that we are not only being blessed by god but that we become the blessing to others young man young lady tonight we'll tell you why god allows it number one listen to me i'm gonna read some things brother said but i gotta hurry he does it because he wants to shake your flesh he wants to shake your flesh when god permits you to go through the scepter that's what he did he was shaking peter's flesh simon got over there christ was crucified you know it come down to where it looked like the message has finally died nobody's got the victory they thought it was done this man who we thought would be the prophet the messiah he's dead he's gone look at this peter didn't go to fishing simon what did peter when jesus called him he gave him revelation peter is identified with the revelation of jesus's ministry simon is identified as the fisherman and when he got down to it and he was shook jesus told him before the cup grows you'll deny me three times thrice before the crows now you say what you want to i always thought about old john the baptist brother god have mercy got down in that prison only thing i know the prophet said was his eagle eye got filmed over and they come ask him you know are you him and then this they fight jesus messiah and then finally he got to his disciples said come here guys i'm down in this prison i know i introduced him i know i said he's the lamb of god but i want you to go down there and ask him are you him are you really him that what happened he got discouraged the prophet said now brother if it can happen to a prophet with a spiritual life surely it can happen to us watch this them two men ran down there he said he had a crowd he acknowledged those two men how can i help you said we're disciples of john he told us can you imagine that cro where disciples are done he told us to ask are you him or shall we look for another jesus said go back and tell john the blind see the depth here the dumb wraith the gospel is preached to the poor brothers and guys turned around took off running as fast as they can go got the top the hill just said hey wait a second let me tell you crowd something because he knew what they was thinking and he stopped and said and them two boys turned around and heard jesus say jesus they heard jesus say something like this and there ain't been one born among women greater than john the baptist but i can imagine he got down to the prison god and there john said come here guys tell me what did he say what did he say he said tell you that the dead's being raised the blind is seeing the depths here and the gospels happen and the poor having the gospel pray to them john said oh my oh my you can just tell the depression the happiness on hey but wait john there's one more thing he said what did he say he said to all that crowd there ain't a born man born among women greater than john the baptist or i can see that old beak beat itself said hey take me to the chopping box i'm ready to go now amen god come down there sent to me and jesus encouraged john the baptist in his discouragement and his doubting he still made a way for him the bible said when we disbelieve god abides faithful the sifter wants to shake our flesh let me tell you why watch bubbam said we don't need so much of dips in the spirit or spiritual waking we need a revival let's watch us let's revive what we got not spiritual awakening sometimes that's cause mixed multitudes but we need a revival that'll sift down that'll shake down and we'll cut all the things out like standing there by the seashore i was talking some brethren over in puerto rico a few weeks ago that when they seen the great sea and the great storm the waves were higher than this tabernacle and you know what it hasn't got one more drop of water in it and when it's perfectly calm but what does that churning and that jump and what does it mean it throws all the trash out upon the bank what the church listen close what the church needs is a revival that'll shake from all of its worldliness and all the things of the world and bring us back to purity and the wholeness of god in our hearts as believers and he says humanity why does god shake us down i'll tell you why he shakes us down so that you come the place you realize i can't make it without him i'm not living this on my own it's the power of christ that rest upon me brother the day you young people come to place you realize it's not you doing it but it's christ in you doing it when a boy told me they said but look i can't live for god i said you can't but he can you surrender your life to him let him come in christ will live the christian life through you you believe that same man now you say why why why would this why would this be the case why would simon be accepted now you remember these guys are men just like us what shocks me about seven verses prior to that uh jesus telling simon that he would be sifted like wheat do you know six verses prior to that seven verse prior that verse 24 the bible said there was strife among the disciples you know what they were fussing about who would be the greatest you imagine that who would be the greatest in the kingdom i'll tell you what them boys needed they needed a revival of humility we're here to compare ourselves with each other we're here to compare ourselves to one person and that's christ look we don't justify ourselves because we think we're doing better than the next guy come on now listen to me no we're here to be mow the image of god when we start thinking highly of ourselves oh how sometimes it takes us years to understand that that's when god when we start thinking too high of ourselves god will allow that center to come just to show us that we are weak we are frail and that we're how insignificant we are in this big program of god god allows us to be sifted so that we're not exalted above measure i told our people in our church when you meet them denominational folk on your job don't put your nose up because you think you got more revelation than they got let me tell you something there go you but for the grace of god you wouldn't even see this mess if it wasn't for grace you young girls god bless you that you obey the word and have long hair you don't have to paint yourself up but when you go to school and you see that young lady dressing and looking at don't put your nose a patter just pray and say god one day that would have been me but you turned me around i wouldn't maybe some of you not wasn't raised in a home or a mom and see some of y'all are maybe never been there because you had a mom and dad that wouldn't let you do it it don't mean you didn't have the desire to do it it's that they kept that desire in place until god got a hold of you you can't tell me brother they can't tell me i wouldn't want to tell you i was raised in a preacher's home but i wouldn't tell you the stuff i was outdoing my cousin i wouldn't tell my children that after i didn't want to tell my daddy and i had no mama act like god talking to her all the time that frustrated the fire to me she gets you to confess and stuff making you think god done told her you know god didn't tell her yeah we had a friend come over one time his name was larry and we don't warn larry about mama mama's a spiritual woman but god ain't talking to her all the time don't you believe that stuff so david and i my brother we went out of the room larry was in there with mama mama got to talking to him we come back and larry's bawling like a baby that boy don't know nothing about god he don't know anything about the way we know had no clue about his crime we come and said what in the world you crying for your mama made me think god knew i was or she knew i got told her that i was smoking marijuana said my god man did you tell her yeah i told her everything i said son god did larry god didn't tell her nothing she tricked you into thinking god was talking to her but thank god for good parents but you know what having good parents and men raised in a christian home that don't automatically make us not have the desire for the things in the world brother bib said i could take billy paul joe take it out into it and that nature come out of them so here's what we got to remember that's god sent us put pressure shake our flesh that we don't ever think or have the attitude oh i stand because of who i am we don't stand nothing because of who we are we stand because him we're gonna make it by the grace of god we're saved by the grace of god we're going to live for god tomorrow because of his grace let me go a step further you're going to go into rapture because the grace of god the bible says when that heads don't come it comes with shoutings crying works works no faith fed no grace grace undead i'm saved by the grace of god you believe that same man god called him twice by his fleshly name simon to show him that his flesh would fail listen i said a minute ago he said are you him no i don't know nothing about him second time my speech betrayeth you you know how these young people these people go out the world and they were trying to act like the world and every time they open their mouth some little message term comes out by speech betrayaphy i can listen to preachers out here in radio land on television and tell you what tape they're listening to what book to read now because their speech betrays them act like they don't want our message but they sure like digging into it don't they they pull out what they want they know this is some good wheat this is some full seven course meal this is some bread that's been wheat that's been tried and tested and proven and vindicated god uses this scepter to show that we're nothing the power of his grace listen to this you'll never be stronger in god until you realize how weak you are i know that goes against the grain psychology and all that but remember there's perfect strength and perfect weakness simon was weak until he denied the lord listen this is powerful he denied the lord all of a sudden can you imagine when the cop crewed oh my he knew then what jesus said was true now watch simon went and picked up his fish and that went back to doing he's doing but did you know on resurrection morning mark the 16th chapter about seven verse jesus met two women he said go tell my disciples come on finish it don't tell my disciples and peter called him by that new name again you know can you imagine when they got back and the disciples come around said hey we've seen the lord we've seen the lord and something what did he say he said tell all of y'all and express to you peter he called your name and said tell you he's risen and he'll meet you down another godly glory like god something happened and peter you know what happened that revelation was still anchored down in his soul that's what satan could not touch glory to cut hey your flesh might fail but there's something down your soul is a tied post holding you to christ come on church when everything feel like it's shaking as a tide post down that soul that's what my man called your absolute it holds you to christ yes sir shakes your flesh shakes your flesh paul went through it i gotta i gotta go but he said this prayed i pray three god did let me god deliver me god take this thorn away no why you gonna leave it so he wouldn't be exalted above measure each one of you not got a trial in your flesh some of us got such a strong trial you don't even want to tell nobody there's men so old brother they laid on their dying beth 90 years old and fought the same trial all of their life they say what's the greatest time in your life right now why god's fixing delivering me from this trial that i've always had and set me free hey it didn't change that they were son of god they had their battles their battles hey when you're sealed in they ain't no battle that soul remembers when you're still in there the struggle's over in that soul that's what he said it's over down in there your struggle's in this flesh it ain't boring again the motions of sin are still in your flesh come on listen to him you ever notice a young person when you get called on god you don't go pick up new sins you don't go pick up new habits you go back to what you kind of used to do because those motions are still in your flesh the sin factory in the soul has been shut down there ain't no more sin being produced because you can't sin but the sins are still in the body because it's not converted brother one these mornings on that resurrection morning and that glorious morning god's gonna give us a body that's commendary with the light we already got we're gonna get a body that matches our soul man my soul is already in the glory of fight condition and it's gonna give me a blood the battle's gonna be over but until then he's going to shake my flesh so that i know it's not me that's doing it it's christ that's doing it oh praise the lord let me hurry hurry i got to hurry i got to go i know i said i got to be short i don't have a watch and if i was picking up don't pay no attention and i'm not gonna say i'm closing a hundred times if i do you holler pharaoh let my people go let me tell you what god does i gotta hurry seriously not only shakes our flesh listen to this young people god puts you through the scepter so that he can separate you from filth so he can separate you from everything that's not like christ the scepter is a filtering process don't get no further let me get to this the scepter is a strainer the scepter filters out the wheat that things from the wheat that are not even seen by the human eye over the middle east the women during the harvest time the harvest time was always during the breezing part of the year they would lay out on large sheets and they'd lay the weed on the sheets and then they would take something like a stiff broom and they would beat the wheat and as they beat the wheat they were breaking up the shaft and the stems and the leaves and everything off of the wheat and after this beating was over in the harvest time on the wednesday windy desert four women would get it on each side of the sheet listen to this and after they beat the wheat the four women would grab the corners and when the wind blows they throw the do like this to the sheet and blow the weed up and all the shaft and the thing that had no fruit on it would be blown away and the wheat would drop right back down in its place you know why it had fruit on it had weight to it when the wind blew the shaft was driven away and listen this and the wheat was put back back where it belongs you understand why we just don't need to have church we need to have the wind of god blow through here we need to have every service we need the holy ghost among us i don't mean man of facts or something i don't mean like you shout tonight tomorrow night you think you have to make yourself shout again i'm not talking about that i'm not just letting the holy ghost have his way [Music] i've seen enough of that stuff pentecost they shout when the music is going when it's done they quit shouting forget that nonsense brother i want to see a response to the word this i said wednesday night at my church that we don't have drums wish i didn't just don't have nobody know how to play them right that guy they told me i played him right i set him up and he started playing saying i'll get off of him you know how to play him right i want somebody just beat him but drums and piano you know what this is this ain't our music this is accompanying our music the music's in your heart where you sing and make melody to the lord this is all just accompaniment it ain't replacement come on now brother william don't get up here like a robot and get you to do no you enter into his gates with thanksgiving you come in here to the courts with praise there's something in your heart responding it'll bring the presence of the holy spirit he is that one about what god will do he'll drive everything that's not supposed to be part it'll drive the word we'll put you through a filter and drive away everything that's not like christ and put you back in your place oh with a god then the wheat hangs in there even in the shifting you know what happens these extreme measures some of the time that god takes gets us more pure like like i'm speaking may go the shad with me she's abednego put in the firefight and the bible said imagine this they were bound when were put in they were bound they said turn the heat up seven times hotter finally they said the servant came over and he looked in and said oh king did we not cast three men in the fire but there's four men and he didn't just say there's four men he said there's four men loose in the fire what's that tell me that god don't put us in the fire to bind us he puts in the fire to lose stuff to free us from everything that binds us and the prophet said they came out there without even smelling smoke on their clothes oh that god he wants to free us and whom the son has set free all that god is free indeed let me i almost said i'm on clothes you preach at home in long gory's church you say that you're in trouble i was preaching there a few months ago i said i'm gonna close everyone the musicians gotta come up said what were y'all doing brother homie said we're closing you just said you're closing i train them when the preacher said you're closing they get up on the platform it's done you're done he meant that i had to quit i preach at homers i don't say that it's not even in my notes i've trained myself not to say i'm closing amen listen to this strengthens your faith i'm done i'm almost done it strengthens your faith let me tell you why i know that because jesus says when you go through this peter and when thou art converted but you remember brother said he was already justified he even thought they were sanctified so this sifting that say that satan would put simon through would only push peter's faith on up to pentecost so we can get bored again so we can get converted now look i'm not an auto mechanic i got a boy one of my boys is a he works for the ford motor company i don't know nothing about cars you know how much i know about cars when i was 70 years old i'm gonna tell y'all sunday when i was about 16 seven years old i was full-time preaching preached all up in kentucky you know down through georgia south carolina florida british all over the place sixteen seven years old and i had no ltd you know you wouldn't really call degrees until you drove a big car and i had a big car and that car started knocking on me and i pulled into waldorf florida sam davis pulled into his place i said sam my car's about on its last leg what's wrong with it i said the engine's knocking he said hold on son that's kind of preacher's eyes around hold on son and he went down and got me some oil olive oil a couple bottles of olive oil i thought what in the world's he doing he raised that hood up brother he raised that hook took about three bottles of olive oil and poured into my oil so that car is gonna be all right it's healed in jesus name hey you think i'm kidding i got in that car and just trusted god went down the road the knock and stuff and i drove that car until i couldn't drive it no more hey he's still the same that's about as much as i know about engines i just know enough that he can heal an engine he can heal my body hey man if he can heal an engine he can he can he'll cancer if he can heal an engine he can do anything that's the god we serve he's a mighty big god tonight finally watch what happens now really i said that but i don't know nothing so some of you guys are mechanic i hope i'm saying this right but i looked it up this is what they say an automatic transmission they have what they call a torque converter anybody hear a mechanic nobody praise god you won't know if i'm telling the truth then i've got to do this is right i'm telling you that's right now that torque converter has got three functions but one of the main purposes of it is to convert power listen the converter transfers the power from the engine to the transmission input shaft plus it multiplies the engine torque output now you may not that may not mean nothing but listen to me closely the transmission has no power within itself but the main drive does the motor is where the horsepower is and there's so much power in the motor to the input of the transmission if you hook the transmission to the power of the motor blood the pieces but then there's the torque converter and what that converter is takes the power of the engine that motor and transmits it in a way that doesn't blow the transmission up but builds it up where it can push it down the road listen to this but without the converter it's impossible to transfer the main power the source to the transmission that converter says i can handle taking the power from the motor put it into the treadmill in such a way so they can give it more power than it's ever dreamed of you say what's that mean that means this that god cannot hook you up in your condition right now directly to him and blow you to pieces but when he brings that converter in then that conversion comes and he takes his power puts it into you and it pushes you down the road amen instead of you holding that power it puts it out of you and does something for christ thank god for conversion thank god for the holy ghost you say power yes in acts chapter one when the disciples got together after jesus resurrection they said well you at this time he said hey wait wait it's not giving you no the time of the season with the father putting his own power that's his own authority but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you he said go do some wait until you being new with power from on high you look up that word power you know what it means it's the word dunamis it's where we get the word dynamite but when god gives you the holy ghost you might be just like little david but god put a stick of dynamite in you lord of god when he lights you up you blow the devil's kingdom to pieces it don't blow you up it builds you up in christ it makes you strong in christ but it gives you power over the devil hey gives you power over the world i say like brother brown gives you power to live right gives you power to walk right get your pot gives you sisters power to dress right gives you boys power to live right do right talk right confess right that's what this converter does you love him saying man sometimes you know there's a song there's a guy by the name of that well they call him fn lehman but his name was frederick lehman 1917 lehman wrote a song i only had two stanzas two verses but back in those days the song was considered you know that was considered william was considered incomplete if they had three stanzas they wouldn't copyright unless i had three verses to it no lehman wrote a verse two verses told his family he wrote a verse but they even got so full of spirit of god 1970s they didn't his family thought he was crazy all they do is sing and worship and talk about god when they go out on the streets he'd be telling by about christ it got so bad that his own wife committed him to a mental institution he spent the last eight or ten years of his life and 8 by 10 sale and you would have thought that if anything could have took god away from him that would have done it but i'd like to tell you this quickly oh paul spent most of his life in a prison my brother i like my office i like air conditioning i told myself i could have never been the prophet to the age because he wouldn't have found me in no cave he'd had to come to the holiday and express amen fired me come on let's be honest i'm just not made that way i am going in the woods at night time i ain't doing it i don't care what you think i don't go hunting i don't hunt i ain't walking out at four o'clock in the morning that's stupid don't know what's hanging around ain't doing that god took me hunting one time bought me a a rifle my boy's got it now leopold scoped about 2 000 some dollars for all this outfit told me he's gonna take me hunting i said all right i'll go with you and i went out and bought boots and clothes and all this camouflage and this big orange vest and he got out there and told me the horse the deer were color blind i said well named grandma wearing all this stuff for them you can't see he put me up in some tree stand sort of a nice it was a nice deal he didn't know but i in my sight my coveralls i took the spoken word book it's about time the sun come up i was reading there was deer coming underneath me but i never saw them you come up a little later on they say man did you not see him i said man i'm sorry brother i got too involved in this book he said man you ain't never gonna make a hunter i said no this ain't for me i said this is a waste of time i said i could be in my office you kill the deer you go get the jerky you bring it back to me and i'll just you pay ties on the deer and i'll just study the word of god family thought he was crazy lost his mind all of a sudden he died in the years that he spent in that eight by ten cell they thought he was gone nobody come and visit him the nurse that looked after him finally when he died called one of his granddaughters and said look i know you didn't come to see your grandfather no you don't care but he's got a little box here a belongings at his left and we'd like somebody to family to have it she said okay i'll come and she went in there and it took her in that little 8-10 cell and brother bother they pulled his car back when they pulled his cop back their inscribed was the third verse to that song became copyrighted it's in your song book right there and that verse reads something like this could we with ink the ocean field and where the skies a parchment made where every stock on earth acquired and every man ascribed by trade to write the love of god above would drain the oceans dry nor could the scroll contain the whole those stretched from sky to sky oh the love of god how rich and pure how measurous and strong it shall forevermore endure the saints and angels song brother when they thought he was broke down there was a tie post in that soul brother said satan got his mind but he couldn't touch his soul see sometimes god breaks us down and it's through the scepter that god strengthens our faith let me close on this one tonight as our musicians are coming when you go to the sifter i wasn't kidding i'm closing musicians come please be like homer's church now you know what you're going to find out in those times listen to me young people i'll put you through the center you're going to find out who your friends are you know as well as i do nobody knew peter like jesus he spoke to peter three times peter finally said lord i'll go with you both to prison to death he said peter the shall crow not grow this day before thou hast thrice denied me thou knowest me jesus knew simon would betray him or deny him he said i'll go fishing i'll forget it all but jesus says but i like it but i have prayed for thee the bible says that we were in our sins and trespasses away from god couldn't make it and ephesians 2 verse 5 says 4 says but god who's rich in mercy brother when you say that little word but it means everything's changing like in revelation 10 when the mighty angel come down 700 and they said write it not see i'll do it not it was sealed up verse 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound it means a changing but i prayed for thee let me tell you something when you go through the sifter you have a friend who sticks closer to you than a brother and his name is jesus you know what friend is a friend is someone who stands by you when he or she has every right not to god has every right to turn away from us he doesn't but if you would just get a song ready i want to i want to tell this and then i want us to pray have you ever heard anybody come to you and say hey i i woke up this morning ate a oh handful of wheat i just shipped it and ate it went out there and feeling this got the wheaton i just ate a handful of wheat this morning nobody nobody's done that until that wheat was put through a shredding process and all of a sudden nobody wants wheat raw but everybody loves a loaf of bread what's the point god put you through the process put you through the fiery trial but when he brings you out you don't bring out a weed he brings out somebody he's molded into his image listen to me i'm tell you something what you are right now a lot of people want it when god gets done with you they don't want a whole loaf of bread that you got got a little girl came to our church mom and daddy was separated divorced home was broke up she had a little grandpa came to church she came she said in the service come in look look her wild water black you know she was cut into that kind of stuff and god got a hold of her god done something that little girl changed her life she lived with her mother and she went home and her mother all playing out in the world it's a great piano player played out in the world separated from her husband she saw something in that little girl she decided she's going to come down see what's going on so she come down and we had a brother in the church took her home him and his wife and they showed her so much love she says today the only reason i ever returned that church was because the man and woman who took me home didn't judge me my condition but showed love to me she came back she gave her heart to god she was so radically changed that her husband saw the change and said my god god can turn you around i like to go down and see what's happening he come down he got saved i remarried them god restored their home she's my piano player he's my bass player all because one little young person was willing to surrender their life to god hey went through the test had to face the trials had to go through what the world says but when god was done pulled her out of that little oven and there was a loaf of bread was able to feed her mama feed her daddy hey when god's done with you you'll not only receive god's blessed hey you'll become a blessing to somebody else that's what it's all about god putting us through the scepter what is this bread of life i'll tell you what it is i won't go any further it's this message young person don't you ever let the devil tell you god didn't vindicate this message you take this word you put it in your heart amen he's getting the bride ready jesus is coming amen i said jesus is coming and it will be in your generation we're there let's buy our heads tonight if we could father i thank you let me deliver my heart tonight i don't know what some of these have faced lord when this meeting's done i don't know what someone's going to face out there but i do know the enemy's real and i know we're living in satan's eden but don't father i pray tonight that you would sow and graft this word in their heart that when that hour comes that sifting come their life they'll come back to this i got somebody praying for me i got a friend that sticks closer to me than a brother when everything else fails jesus never fails father i pray for every young person tonight as we start these meetings out may the word of god just so sink in their hearts oh god lord may they get so close to you father lord may they just wrap themselves up and commit their wills to your will be willing enough tonight to say lord i don't know what i have to go through i don't know what i have to face but i know one thing lord with you i can make it i surrender my life i surrender my will to you lord i know that you'll work everything out for my good you'd never allow me to face anything that you wouldn't believe that i could make it through it have your way in every life may the holy spirit have its way in every young man's life every young girl's life oh god maybe we never sit in the seat of the scornful but may we pray for one another may we believe god for one another may we encourage one another when we see our friend and our loved ones and our lord our close companions going through things maybe not step on them maybe not look over them but maybe we pray with them oh god strengthen them lord this is the our great battles may we put ourselves back to back lord not fight one another but fight the enemy may you bless every person now father every single one in the audience tonight lord have your way in their life we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ and the whole church says would you stand with me just a moment would you just lift your hands up to the lord as our brother comes to just lead us tonight and worship pray may god bless you heal unto me according to thy word yes my soul responds [Music] to [Music] let there be a performance of all the thou has spoken for nothing is impossible with god oh [Music] according to thy word my soul responds to thee let there be a performance of all the thou has spoken for now is impossible with god let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart it was a tiny simple sable all beaten and mourned hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty so i know if i'll give him control he'll be born in me so let your word be born in the danger of my heart lord let it live in me let it soar and live inside this house [Music] [Applause] my [Music] unlikely a place for his word to unfold but if i'll just heal this vessel and let him have his way from glorion to glory you'll change me day by day so let your word be born in [Music] inside this house [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] every day let your word be worn in the [Music] [Laughter] manger hey man hallelujah something to feel good hey man it feels right when you're worshiping the lord amen how many enjoyed that message amen young people get ready for the worse amen because it's gonna be out there you're living in the worst age ever how do you get ready by getting your soul anchored with jesus how he believes that he'll take you through it don't matter what it is praise the lord god bless you tonight amen we're going to have brother brad come up here amen and explain a few of the details and what we're going to uh how things are going to go okay so just hang on there for a minute man certainly a good message tonight and just to draw us all closer to the lord so we're definitely living in different times and uh some things that we've had having to do you know i told my dad today some of the precautions we were going to have to take and in order to have these meetings you know and it wasn't too long ago they were shutting down churches and hindering services and we don't want that again and but i told my dad today i never dreamed i would be taking temperatures at the house of god you know as people come in so just bear with us it's just some technicality you know things that we have to do we feel like just to do our part um you know we left the house i had faith that i was going to make it just fine but i put my seat belt on just to make sure you know just little things that we're doing so uh you seen the temperatures and the hand washing we ask that you observe that um as we come into the buildings um and also um when we go into the fellowship hall uh we'll have a route it won't be like it's been in the past where it's just kind of a free free for all and eating everybody sit down we ask that you get your food as you're going through the front door wash your hands get your food and go out the back door the fellowship hall uh young people if you don't mind come to the pavilion up here to eat your meal and fellowship there's some tables in the fellowship hall we're going to limit those if we can to us older folks and so it's kind of spread out so the lord's blessed us with wonderful weather for this time of year and just really cool nights so move your way up there if you don't mind and we'll be cleaning the sanctuary um after services so we have a cleaning crew we'll be coming in washing down the pews disinfecting trying to do our part uh so we asked if you need to practice music or anything like that we would ask that you'd use the piano in the back sunday school room um and just let one of the deacons know that you um need to come in and use that piano but once once we leave out of the sanctuary tonight we just ask please don't come back into the sanctuary uh after we've cleaned it until we're ready for the next service so uh with all that being said have a good time don't let covet be on your mind so much but let's just follow some of the simple guidelines i know brother luke had everybody shake hands i'm telling you don't shake hands so you know we just want to try to we want to do our part i know the county right below us has 3 800 kids that are not in school uh because of code related illnesses or people in their home so that's just on the other side of the state line here so it's it's here it's serious we don't fear it but we want to do our part so god bless you and have a good time brother bother our head we're going to
