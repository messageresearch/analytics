[42:18] will touch his body and also uh brother
[42:21] Tommy put on our brother's page T today
[42:24] that we'd remember brother Andrew
[42:26] Spencer he down in his back and he's
[42:28] heard his side somehow or the other so
[42:30] he asked that we'd remember him tonight
[42:32] in prayer and also we I had turned in a
[42:35] prayer request about my oldest brother
[42:38] Daryl and uh the cancer the spot on his
[42:41] nose turned out to be cancerous so he
[42:44] desires your prayers and I I've got to
[42:47] see I think it's either this coming week
[42:49] or the end of the month that he has to
[42:51] go for the surgery so just remember him
[42:53] in in your prayers if you have need on
[42:55] your heart you might let it be known
[42:57] with uplifted hands amen and we're going
[42:59] to ask brother John Wade if he'd pray
[43:01] over the offering in these needs tonight
[43:56] ch for
[44:34] amen and there was one request I didn't
[44:36] think I would forget because I didn't
[44:38] write it I didn't write it down but as
[44:40] many of you have noticed my grandson
[44:42] hasn't been to church lately and he's
[44:44] kind of got away from talking to us
[44:46] again and so we just desire that you'd
[44:49] remember Mark that the Lord would just
[44:50] speak to his heart again and I don't
[44:52] really know what all is going on with
[44:54] him he hasn't had much to say I talked
[44:56] to him the other day day and he just
[44:58] said he was going to start calling and
[45:00] stuff but he's not so he's going he's in
[45:03] a real battle so just continue to
[45:05] remember him in prayer and I know that
[45:06] God's done something for him and and uh
[45:09] just remember him in your prayers if you
[45:11] don't care and my son Micah and the
[45:14] Lord's working on him and every time he
[45:16] calls me about something I tell him I
[45:18] say well let me just tell you the best
[45:20] thing to
[45:21] do
[45:23] pray and he started praying and I he
[45:27] told me the other day I'm going to tell
[45:29] this on him and he said boy dad
[45:33] sometimes it don't work like you think
[45:34] it would I said no son God doesn't
[45:38] answer it when you want it done he
[45:40] answers it when it's time and he seen
[45:43] God move and he's seen his hand and uh
[45:46] you know he's hardhead like his dad so
[45:50] God's just going to have to do a little
[45:51] extra work like he did me sometimes he
[45:55] you know some kids you can tell them you
[45:58] know parents and they do it other kids
[46:00] you know it's a constant reminder that's
[46:03] kind of the way I am and unfortunately
[46:05] he he got that for me so just continue
[46:08] to pray for him and you know I we s
[46:10] brother Josh sings that song our family
[46:13] is sealed I believe that tonight I
[46:15] believe God's going to give us our
[46:17] children I don't know what they got to
[46:19] go through when they go through a
[46:22] trial I just say Lord if that's what you
[46:26] got to do
[46:28] let it go because you know what if
[46:32] they're the richest people in the world
[46:33] and they don't have God they're
[46:35] nothing but if there are the poorest
[46:37] people in the world and they have Jesus
[46:39] they're the richest people in the world
[46:41] they have everything you don't get
[46:43] anything better than eternal
[46:45] life and so I just believe that for my
[46:47] children and this song Come On My Heart
[46:50] tonight when we all get to heaven that's
[46:53] what we're looking for you know we look
[46:55] at our parents some of them are G on and

[47:04] remember brother John because I've known
[47:06] brother John since he was as big as
[47:08] Jonathan I remember him when he was that
[47:11] small and you know and I think what is
[47:14] it going to be when we get over there
[47:16] don't you want to be there amen there's
[47:18] just something in my heart and I said
[47:19] Lord just draw us all closer together

[54:11] we will we're try not to keep you along
[54:12] tonight and and uh you just pull and
[54:16] I'll preach and when you're done pulling
[54:18] I'm done preaching so that's the way
[54:19] that works and we'll just uh do it at
[54:21] that so I was thinking about this and
[54:24] this is a little subject I want to look
[54:25] at tonight and a topic that I've been
[54:26] wanting to preach on for last little bit
[54:29] few months maybe and and um just didn't
[54:32] never really fit in or feel like it was
[54:34] the right time and and I just tell you
[54:36] just a little confession this uh on
[54:39] myself uh you know I I do pretty much a
[54:42] regimented schedule and have for the
[54:45] last little bit and so mornings I get up
[54:48] at usually a set time a certain time I
[54:50] do I pray I read and I I study I do this
[54:53] I do that and I'm all regimented up
[54:55] until a certain time and then it's kind
[54:56] of free day well you know yesterday I I
[55:00] I got up and I just thought to myself
[55:03] I'm not doing this
[55:05] today I'm I'm just not doing this today
[55:08] I'm I'm not I'm not exercising I'm not
[55:10] reading I'm not I'm not going to study
[55:12] I'm not going to I'm not going to listen
[55:14] to my motivation I'm not I'm not doing
[55:16] none of that I'm just not going to do it
[55:18] so I just literally sat and was just
[55:20] slothful and lazy all day
[55:24] yesterday has any of y'all ever ever
[55:26] done
[55:28] that so as the day goes on I begin to
[55:33] you know I'm thinking about the service
[55:34] today I know I got to preach and I'm
[55:35] thinking about what I what I want to
[55:37] preach on and and so I'm just going
[55:39] through the day and the more the day
[55:41] goes the more I'm getting angry with
[55:43] myself I'm getting down on myself why
[55:45] why did I do that this is not this is
[55:47] not the way I operate what What mo you
[55:49] know why did I do that and I'm going on
[55:51] and said we go to bed and I tell Joy I
[55:53] said you know what I'm just discouraged
[55:55] I'm I'm just just upset with myself I
[55:58] said because I was just wasted the
[56:00] entire day being slothful and lazy and I
[56:03] didn't accomplish a single
[56:07] thing and I thought to myself and I'm
[56:10] I'm thinking why I said now I've got to
[56:12] work harder I've got to work double time
[56:14] because I've got to make up for where my
[56:16] laziness
[56:17] was and so as I'm sitting there and I'm
[56:19] thinking about that so we go to sleep
[56:21] and I wake up this morning and I'm back
[56:23] on
[56:25] track going want and to do this and I do
[56:27] that and I get ready I go get ready to
[56:29] do my my little exercise and jog I get
[56:31] my motivational and I listen to
[56:33] different speakers and one I listen to
[56:35] is Jim ran I think some of you probably
[56:37] have heard of him listen to him and the
[56:39] first thing he says is if you're living
[56:42] a life of
[56:46] laziness and and you've lost your way
[56:49] you need to focus and get yourself back
[56:53] into the vision
[56:56] and I thought thank you
[56:58] Lord and then as I began to think about
[57:01] that I began to think about the story
[57:02] and and the illustrations I want to use
[57:04] tonight and I thought you know what
[57:06] sometimes we just have to go through
[57:08] things really we don't maybe know why we
[57:09] don't know why we do some of the things
[57:11] we do but it all falls into place songs
[57:14] that were sang things that were said
[57:16] things tonight that have been said and
[57:18] done uh even down to the very fact of
[57:20] the group of people that's here you say
[57:22] well we're small in numbers well how
[57:24] many believes we can be Mighty and Power
[57:26] power amen so you know when we look at
[57:30] this and I begin to think I begin to
[57:31] think on the character of Joseph and
[57:35] I've been wanting to preach on this a
[57:36] while so I began to study and look and
[57:37] see what the what the prophet said about
[57:39] him and just want to read this to you
[57:41] before we get into the word he says real
[57:43] quickly I got to get to another
[57:44] character he said I see one before me
[57:46] now his name is Joseph he was an elected
[57:50] son he was a perfect type of Christ he
[57:54] was born a prophet he was a prophet and
[57:57] now he could see visions and he he was
[58:01] yet a little boy and he saw a vision of
[58:03] himself sitting on a throne and his
[58:06] brothers bowing to him see but watch he
[58:11] become he felt like he was a a great
[58:15] guy he said but what did God have to do
[58:18] he done the same thing that he did to
[58:20] the rest of
[58:21] them he said because Moses was a
[58:24] deliverer Paul was a deliverer Joseph
[58:26] now a deliverer he saved his people from
[58:29] the famine but what did God have to do
[58:31] to him he put him in
[58:34] prison he said he put him straight right
[58:37] in the
[58:44] prison yes sir he said remember he was
[58:47] sold by his Brethren to the Egyptians
[58:49] they slded him to piiper and now Piper
[58:52] gave him a little bit of Liberty and the
[58:53] first thing you know it was taken from
[58:55] him
[58:58] he said and there he sat in the prison
[59:00] crying and crying and God had stripped
[59:03] it he said but now notice all the time
[59:06] all the time I believe he was in that
[59:10] prison he could remember that the vision
[59:13] said he was going to sit on a
[59:16] throne you see we may go up and we may
[59:19] go down and we may wonder why we wonder
[59:21] why we're at where we're at today but
[59:23] the vision says we're be at a married
[59:27] the vision said when he was in the
[59:29] prison that he was going to be sitting
[59:30] on a throne and the vision says that his
[59:33] brothers are going to bow down to him
[59:35] because he says he knew his gift came
[59:38] from God and he knew that was it and it
[59:42] had to come to
[59:45] pass woo that's
[59:49] rich Genesis CH 37 if if you want to
[59:52] turn there let's let's read let's stand
[59:54] if we could once again and and as we
[59:56] read you know we the prophet said we we
[59:58] stand for the Pledge of Allegiance in
[1:00:00] our national anthem we ought to stand
[1:00:01] when we read the word of the
[1:00:05] Lord Genesis chapter
[1:00:09] 37 and Jacob dwelt in the land wherein
[1:00:12] his father was a stranger in the land of
[1:00:14] Canaan and these are the generations of
[1:00:17] Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was
[1:00:20] feeding the flock with his Brethren and
[1:00:22] the lad was with the sons of bilha the
[1:00:24] sons of Zila
[1:00:26] and his father's wives and Joseph
[1:00:28] brought unto his father their evil
[1:00:31] report so when we think about this here
[1:00:33] here we got a 17-year-old coming back
[1:00:35] and bringing a report of wrongdoing okay
[1:00:39] this is kind of the life where Joseph is
[1:00:40] at and where he's living at this point
[1:00:42] in his life 17 years old remember now
[1:00:45] and now Israel loved Joseph more than
[1:00:47] all of his children because he was the
[1:00:50] son of his old age and he made him a
[1:00:53] coat of many colors
[1:00:57] what is what is what is what's going on
[1:00:58] here what is happening here we got we
[1:01:01] got a young
[1:01:02] 17-year-old who's bringing the the the
[1:01:05] the the evil report that his brothers
[1:01:07] have done who is the most favored the
[1:01:09] most loved the most most treasured
[1:01:12] person that his dad has and his Dad
[1:01:15] gives him this coat of many colors and
[1:01:17] it says and when his Brethren saw their
[1:01:19] father loved him more than all his
[1:01:21] Brethren they hated
[1:01:24] him and and they could not speak
[1:01:27] peaceably unto him now watch and Joseph
[1:01:30] dreamed a dream and he told his Brethren
[1:01:34] and they hated him yet the more I love
[1:01:39] this
[1:01:41] story God is moving and they are
[1:01:45] hating God is moving in the midst in
[1:01:48] their very presence and they're hating
[1:01:50] what's
[1:01:51] happening and he said unto them here I
[1:01:54] pray you this dream which I have dreamed
[1:01:57] for behold we were binding sheep in the
[1:01:59] field and lo my sheath arose and also
[1:02:03] stood upright and behold your sheath
[1:02:05] stood around about and made obsin to my
[1:02:09] sheath so what that word means when we
[1:02:12] look at that absence it means the
[1:02:14] movement of the body made in a token of
[1:02:16] respect or
[1:02:18] submission okay so he now he's having to
[1:02:21] bow down and and approach him as as an
[1:02:24] altar and he's acknowled in his
[1:02:26] superiority he's acknowledging and
[1:02:28] paying homage to Joseph is what these
[1:02:31] sheep are doing well that didn't go over
[1:02:33] too well and it says his brothers said
[1:02:36] unto him shalt thou indeed Reign Over us
[1:02:39] remember these are older brothers he's
[1:02:41] 17 the the second to the youngest of
[1:02:44] these 12 and Reuben is no telling how
[1:02:46] old he was at this
[1:02:49] time and so now you're going to tell us
[1:02:52] you're going to Reign Over Us ye shall
[1:02:54] indeed have dominion over us and they
[1:02:57] hated him yet the more for his dreams
[1:03:01] and for his
[1:03:03] word so what what's going on here this
[1:03:06] is God's chosen hated hated hated
[1:03:11] hated and you wonder when you say you're
[1:03:14] God's chosen why you get the
[1:03:15] repercussions you
[1:03:17] get when you dress the way you dress you
[1:03:20] wonder why you get the repercussions you
[1:03:22] get when you pray the way you pray when
[1:03:25] you sing the way you sing you wonder
[1:03:28] why and he told to his father and his
[1:03:32] Brethren and he rebuked him and said
[1:03:35] what is this dream that thou Hast
[1:03:37] dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy
[1:03:39] Brethren indeed come to bow down
[1:03:41] ourselves to the to the Earth and his
[1:03:45] Brethren watch now envied
[1:03:48] him and his father observed the saying
[1:03:51] and his Brethren went to feed their
[1:03:53] flock father's flock and Sheck them they
[1:03:56] envied him so we got hate we've got envy
[1:03:59] that leads to malice and
[1:04:01] strife
[1:04:03] destruction all in the house of
[1:04:06] God yeah these are the 12 tribes of
[1:04:09] Israel that's these are the guys we're
[1:04:11] talking
[1:04:12] about and Israel said unto Joseph do not
[1:04:16] thy Brethren feed the flock in shech
[1:04:18] them come and I will send thee unto them
[1:04:21] now there's no doubt in my mind that
[1:04:23] Israel had to known that this there
[1:04:25] could have been a problem with
[1:04:28] this this this this could be some bad
[1:04:30] blood Between Brothers here and he's
[1:04:33] sending him out to go out there and meet
[1:04:35] these guys but watch what Joseph said
[1:04:38] Joseph looks at this situation he says
[1:04:40] here I am here am I in other words
[1:04:44] Joseph here is saying I'm ready I know
[1:04:48] who I am I know what I am called for I
[1:04:51] know where I
[1:04:53] stand isn't ambition a wonderful thing
[1:04:58] let's pray Heavenly Father we just come
[1:05:00] before you tonight with grateful Hearts
[1:05:02] thankful for this opportunity just to
[1:05:04] come and speak the word and share the
[1:05:06] word and hear the word father and Lord
[1:05:08] knowing that as we speak we hear and as
[1:05:10] we speak we receive and Lord we just ask
[1:05:13] that you would speak to us mightily
[1:05:15] tonight that we may receive all you'd
[1:05:16] have in store for us we love you Lord
[1:05:19] and help us to grow through the ministry
[1:05:20] of the word tonight we love you with all
[1:05:22] of our hearts and pray for those who
[1:05:23] couldn't be here in Jesus name name amen
[1:05:26] amen you can have your
[1:05:28] seats so tonight I want to speak if I
[1:05:30] could for just a little bit a little
[1:05:32] thought and keeping the vision alive you
[1:05:35] know brother Ben spoke last week he
[1:05:37] spoke on the voice and so tonight we'll
[1:05:39] take a look at the vision and keeping
[1:05:41] the vision alive because down Through
[1:05:44] the Ages Christians have been called
[1:05:46] upon to overcome challenges Christians
[1:05:49] have been called to overcome challenge
[1:05:52] after Challenge and persecution and
[1:05:54] Through the Dark Ages and tri Tri after
[1:05:56] trial and to be honest if you're sitting
[1:05:59] here tonight and you claim to be a
[1:06:00] believer you will have
[1:06:02] challenges challenges with an S it don't
[1:06:06] end after one it don't end when you're
[1:06:08] saved it don't end after you're healed
[1:06:11] it begins to continue and continue and
[1:06:13] it rotates and the challenges come back
[1:06:15] around and come around so let me ask you
[1:06:18] tonight are you up to the
[1:06:21] challenge are we as Christians as
[1:06:23] Believers in the message of the hour and
[1:06:25] the hour we're living in are we up to
[1:06:27] the challenge and is the vision still
[1:06:30] alive you see I love the ambition that
[1:06:33] young Joseph has here in his life
[1:06:36] because he was able to recognize that
[1:06:38] the hour that he was living in and and
[1:06:41] that that the God had a purpose in his
[1:06:43] life and he God had this purpose in his
[1:06:46] life and that it was God's Gift in his
[1:06:49] life that was manifested in his life and
[1:06:51] that was the driving force behind his
[1:06:54] confidence
[1:06:56] you know as Believers I believe we ought
[1:06:57] to be confident we ought to be confident
[1:07:00] in the word we ought to be confident and
[1:07:03] versed in the Bible we ought to be
[1:07:06] confident and versed in the message we
[1:07:08] ought to be confident and and and
[1:07:10] reassured in the healing power of God
[1:07:14] Almighty confident knowing that God will
[1:07:18] provide and God makes a
[1:07:24] way Joseph was
[1:07:26] confident maybe Joseph was just a little
[1:07:29] downright arrogant before his
[1:07:33] brothers think about this no but he knew
[1:07:37] why could he be like that how could he
[1:07:39] be so confident and arrogant before his
[1:07:41] brothers because he knew that no matter
[1:07:43] what happened in his life it wouldn't
[1:07:46] change a single thing that God had
[1:07:48] revealed to him or that God had
[1:07:51] predestinated for him in his
[1:07:54] life you see brothers and sisters it was
[1:07:56] God who gave him that
[1:07:59] dream it was God who gave him the vision
[1:08:03] of who he was and what he was to do so
[1:08:06] Daddy couldn't change that Mama couldn't
[1:08:09] change that Brothers could hate him they
[1:08:11] could envy him they could they could try
[1:08:13] to kill him they could have Strife
[1:08:15] against him they could make his life
[1:08:17] miserable but that doesn't change one
[1:08:20] thing about what God told him he would
[1:08:22] be and what he would
[1:08:24] do that's the confidence and that
[1:08:26] confidence laid in the fact that God
[1:08:28] doesn't change his mind so if that was
[1:08:32] good for Joseph brothers and sisters God
[1:08:34] don't change his mind about us God
[1:08:37] doesn't change his mind about me either
[1:08:40] he doesn't change his mind if God called
[1:08:42] you he's not going to forget
[1:08:44] you why is it that people believe so
[1:08:46] many times they come to church they get
[1:08:48] they get a calling of God in their life
[1:08:51] and God calls them they give their their
[1:08:53] heart to the Lord and the next thing you
[1:08:54] know they turn and they go the wrong way
[1:08:56] and they're like Where's God
[1:09:00] now God don't forget you God don't save
[1:09:04] you to lose
[1:09:06] you God doesn't heal you so that the
[1:09:09] devil can take
[1:09:10] you so why do the Christians confess
[1:09:18] that well diabetes took
[1:09:23] him well you know cancer guy
[1:09:28] heart attack it took
[1:09:31] him that's not the way it
[1:09:34] works that's not the way it works cancer
[1:09:37] has never taken one single believer in
[1:09:41] the existence of
[1:09:44] mankind did you hear what I said cuz you
[1:09:46] didn't answer like you did I said cancer
[1:09:50] diabetes high blood pressure heart
[1:09:53] troubles it has not taken one single
[1:09:55] believer in the existence of
[1:09:58] mankind only God can give and
[1:10:02] take it's not the cancer it's not the
[1:10:04] devil only God can allow things to
[1:10:07] happen and God protects us the devil
[1:10:11] can't
[1:10:13] harm so let me tell you tonight and
[1:10:16] understand this tonight that the
[1:10:19] devil he may scratch and he may claw and
[1:10:23] he may dig and he may bite and he may he
[1:10:26] may try to to poke and he may fight and
[1:10:28] he may use threats and he may put fear
[1:10:30] and anxiety to try to scare you to death
[1:10:33] and have you shaken in your
[1:10:35] shoes but I challenge you tonight keep
[1:10:39] the vision keep the vision of who God
[1:10:42] says you are you are an overcomer
[1:10:45] tonight these are the words that's been
[1:10:47] given to the Believers that you are more
[1:10:49] than able to defeat Satan any time any
[1:10:53] place anywhere
[1:10:55] if you'll stand upon the word of
[1:10:59] God you're more than a conqueror through
[1:11:05] Christ you want to see the
[1:11:07] vision yeah you want just listen to what
[1:11:10] Revelations 1911 says and I
[1:11:14] saw is that a
[1:11:17] vision and I saw and I saw the heaven
[1:11:21] open and behold the White Horse and he
[1:11:23] that set up on him was called faithful
[1:11:26] and true and in righteousness doth judge
[1:11:29] he make
[1:11:31] war his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[1:11:35] his head were as many crowns and he had
[1:11:37] the name written that no man knew but
[1:11:39] himself and he was clothed with the
[1:11:41] vesture dipped in Blood and his name is
[1:11:43] called the word of
[1:11:46] God now where do where do you fit into
[1:11:50] this and the armies which were in heaven
[1:11:53] followed upon him upon white horses and
[1:11:56] clothed in fine linen and white a and
[1:11:59] clean and out of the mouth goeth a sharp
[1:12:01] sword and with it he should Smite the
[1:12:04] Nations and he shall rule them with a
[1:12:07] rod of iron and the fierceness and the
[1:12:09] wrath of almighty God and he that on and
[1:12:13] and and he hath on his vesture and his
[1:12:17] thigh the name written king of kings and
[1:12:20] Lord of
[1:12:22] lords we're in the vision
[1:12:25] keep the vision alive brothers and
[1:12:28] sisters in this hour we're living in we
[1:12:31] have to believe that we are that vision
[1:12:34] and the prophet said it this way he said
[1:12:36] I hope if he calls here this morning the
[1:12:39] ministers get on
[1:12:41] fire we need ministers on fire preaching
[1:12:44] the word of God harder than they've ever
[1:12:46] preached why because we're in the end
[1:12:49] time we need Believers here Desiring to
[1:12:52] hear the word and feasting upon the word
[1:12:55] of God and saying God make me and mow me
[1:12:58] because the hour is
[1:13:01] late he says keep the vision he says the
[1:13:05] ministers look at the vision we're dying

[1:14:44] our mind he says and according to the
[1:14:47] word of God that in these last days he's
[1:14:50] going to have a church he's going to
[1:14:52] have a people and these are the things
[1:14:55] that he promised he's going to do them
[1:14:57] he said he would and we're living in
[1:15:00] that time we're here 1963 we're here
[1:15:04] this is 2025 brothers and sisters we're
[1:15:09] here he's trying to get us to be real
[1:15:13] prisoners
[1:15:14] now
[1:15:17] oh oh I don't know if we like
[1:15:20] that but he said he's trying to get us
[1:15:22] be real prisoners now lock in with him
[1:15:27] brothers and sisters it's not a time to
[1:15:29] be Shackled to the things of this world
[1:15:31] it's not a time to be Shackled to the
[1:15:34] lust of the flesh it's not a time to be
[1:15:37] Shackled to all these things that are
[1:15:39] taking place fastpaced around us but it
[1:15:42] is a time to be a prisoner to the love
[1:15:45] of Jesus Christ and know that Jesus
[1:15:47] loves you and you're a prisoner of the
[1:15:50] word of God
[1:15:56] we look here at this Vision Joseph had
[1:15:58] of himself I'm going to try to slow it
[1:16:00] down a little bit and you stay with
[1:16:02] me we're going to look at Joseph here at
[1:16:05] the vision he had of himself and what
[1:16:07] did Joseph see in the morning when he
[1:16:09] woke up and looked into a mirror what
[1:16:11] kind of person did Joseph
[1:16:14] see now let's change the way we say that
[1:16:18] what kind of person do you see when you
[1:16:19] wake up in the morning and look into the
[1:16:22] mirror
[1:16:25] oh that's
[1:16:29] quiet did Joseph just see an
[1:16:32] insignificant Shepherd
[1:16:34] boy do you just see an insignificant
[1:16:39] churchgoer did Joseph look into the
[1:16:41] mirror and say I'm just going to go out
[1:16:42] here and take care of the sheep today or
[1:16:44] did he look into the mirror and think of
[1:16:46] himself as a leader that God would use
[1:16:49] to save the entire world from famine
[1:16:56] that's a
[1:16:58] vision that's a vision when he got up
[1:17:00] and he looked into the mirror so when
[1:17:01] you look into the mirror you say God use
[1:17:04] me to be a
[1:17:05] witness God use me to be a voice God use
[1:17:09] me to be an
[1:17:11] example God use me to help the world
[1:17:14] make
[1:17:16] [Music]

[1:17:21] with his 11 brothers and brothers and
[1:17:24] sisters this story starts right out of
[1:17:25] the gate with this 17-year-old boy

[1:23:29] the building we've all had a dream but
[1:23:31] you know what sometimes dreams are best
[1:23:33] left unsaid or
[1:23:36] Untold this may have been a good
[1:23:38] situation because Joseph then goes to
[1:23:41] his brothers and he begins to tell this
[1:23:42] dream let me tell you Brothers what's
[1:23:44] going to happen I you're going to come
[1:23:46] before me and you're going to bow down
[1:23:48] I'm going to stand in the center and
[1:23:50] you're going to bow down before me and
[1:23:53] you're going to serve me
[1:23:55] you're going to reverence
[1:23:57] me you and
[1:24:00] Dad the Sun the moon the
[1:24:03] stars all of you are going to reverence

[1:24:17] there in the field how what's what's
[1:24:18] about to happen can you imagine the fury
[1:24:20] that must have been bowling in these
[1:24:22] grown men's Minds as this boy is telling
[1:24:25] them you're going to serve me
[1:24:29] Brothers yeah you're going to serve
[1:24:31] you're going to bow down before me
[1:24:35] wonder how many times they thumped him
[1:24:37] on the back of the
[1:24:40] head trying to get his
[1:24:43] attention so they couldn't stand him
[1:24:47] because he's doing
[1:24:48] everything right they couldn't take no
[1:24:51] more of coat boy telling them what that
[1:24:54] he's going to rule over him and he's
[1:24:55] getting all this special treatment from
[1:24:57] his daddy
[1:25:00] well well well jealousy now that's a
[1:25:04] terrible
[1:25:05] thing jealousy is a terrible thing
[1:25:08] listen to what the prophet said about
[1:25:09] this situation he said Joseph separated
[1:25:12] from his Brethren Without a
[1:25:14] Cause what was the matter with them he
[1:25:18] said Joseph wasn't willing to be
[1:25:20] separated it wasn't his will to separate
[1:25:23] but they separated him themselves from
[1:25:26] him this bright shiny dollar he's
[1:25:29] comparing Joseph to a silver
[1:25:31] dollar this bright shiny silver dollar
[1:25:35] and their penni's worth couldn't stand
[1:25:40] him we're talking about the children of
[1:25:44] Israel and their pennies worth couldn't
[1:25:47] stand him he says they know who they was
[1:25:51] they know they were Patriarchs they know
[1:25:54] that Jacob was their father they know
[1:25:56] that to be true but when Joseph was born
[1:25:59] he couldn't help it because he was
[1:26:01] spiritual he couldn't help it that he
[1:26:03] saw Visions he couldn't help it that he
[1:26:06] interpreted dreams and they were
[1:26:08] perfectly right and his patriarch
[1:26:11] Brothers moved with
[1:26:13] envy and sold him to the
[1:26:19] Egyptians they separated themselves from
[1:26:21] him because they were pennies
[1:26:25] we throw pennies
[1:26:29] away think about this they were pennies
[1:26:33] he was of a different
[1:26:36] quality
[1:26:38] oh come on bride he was of a different
[1:26:43] quality so is the real believer today
[1:26:46] they're of a different quality they'll
[1:26:48] separate
[1:26:50] themselves come on they'll separate
[1:26:53] themselves they don't understand it
[1:26:55] Copper from Silver but we find out they
[1:26:58] moved with envy and sold him why they do
[1:27:01] the same thing today because of
[1:27:06] jealousy they didn't want to break down
[1:27:09] because it was the quality that was in
[1:27:11] them not the quality that was in him and
[1:27:13] because of it they were jealous because
[1:27:16] they were pennies and he was a
[1:27:20] dollar jealousy
[1:27:25] how bad is jealousy when it gets to
[1:27:26] moving
[1:27:28] through the
[1:27:30] church that's why you have to keep such
[1:27:32] a such a tight tight grip and not allow
[1:27:35] jealousy to move amongst the people and
[1:27:37] not let jealousy move in your own
[1:27:44] Hearts they're so fed up with
[1:27:48] Joseph jealousy envy that they were they
[1:27:51] plan to kill him
[1:27:56] Reuben the half brother begins to plead
[1:27:59] with the rest of the brothers spare his
[1:28:01] life we don't want his blood on our
[1:28:05] hands and they're sitting there having
[1:28:07] this conversation and
[1:28:09] Israel then sends Joseph out to the
[1:28:12] field where these brothers are
[1:28:14] conspiring to kill
[1:28:16] him and then he gets to walking out
[1:28:18] there and here they saywell look who's
[1:28:21] coming here comes the dreamer
[1:28:27] how many's ever heard that look who's
[1:28:28] coming here comes the
[1:28:30] Christian here comes the believer here
[1:28:33] comes the Holy
[1:28:36] Rollers all he does is sing songs all he
[1:28:39] does is quote scripture all he does is
[1:28:42] talk about a
[1:28:45] message here comes the
[1:28:48] dreamer and when they seen the
[1:28:50] opportunity They seized it and they
[1:28:52] grabbed a hold of Joseph and they
[1:28:54] stripped off the coat off of him the
[1:28:56] coat of
[1:28:57] multicolors the coat that they hated and
[1:29:00] envied so much and they threw him down
[1:29:02] into a pit so deep that you couldn't
[1:29:05] even see the daylight at the top of it
[1:29:08] and now Joseph is down in the pit these
[1:29:11] people mean
[1:29:13] business all want to kill him but
[1:29:19] one and in their mind they're saying
[1:29:22] nobody will bow to you now
[1:29:25] dreamer but let me ask
[1:29:28] you I don't know about you but if about
[1:29:31] right about this time if I was in his
[1:29:33] shoes I might would be having just a
[1:29:35] little bit of Doubt creep into my
[1:29:38] mind about that dream I
[1:29:42] had are you with me you see sometimes we
[1:29:46] go through struggles and we go through
[1:29:47] hardships and we go through hard
[1:29:49] times and we find ourselves in the pit
[1:29:52] of despair in the pit of distress
[1:29:54] destruction and the world is closing in
[1:29:56] to where you can't even see
[1:30:00] daylight that's when you got to keep the
[1:30:03] vision the prophet said the whole time
[1:30:06] he was in the pit what did he say he
[1:30:08] said I could still see the vision of who
[1:30:10] I
[1:30:11] am and that these people are going to
[1:30:14] bow down to
[1:30:16] me so we can't allow doubt to come into
[1:30:19] our
[1:30:19] mind as they begin to look and they they
[1:30:22] take and they rip this coat
[1:30:25] and with hatred they put the the the
[1:30:27] Lamb's blood or the goat's blood upon it
[1:30:30] and take it back to his father and
[1:30:32] deliver it to his father and and they
[1:30:34] tell a
[1:30:35] lie you see how one thing leads to
[1:30:38] another and another and another Envy
[1:30:39] jealousy hatred Strife lies deceit
[1:30:45] destruction and they take it back and
[1:30:47] they say father we heard an animal and
[1:30:50] we heard Joseph crying in the wilderness
[1:30:53] and before we can get there that he was
[1:30:55] already gone and this is all that's left
[1:30:57] he's
[1:31:00] dead all the while Joseph sold into
[1:31:04] slavery listen to what Genesis 39 says
[1:31:08] Joseph was brought down into Egypt and
[1:31:10] potier an officer of pharaoh captain of
[1:31:13] the Guard the Egyptian bought him out of
[1:31:16] the hands of the Israelites the
[1:31:18] midianites same thing and he had brought
[1:31:20] him down thither and the Lord was with
[1:31:23] Joseph
[1:31:25] let me say that again and the Lord was
[1:31:28] with
[1:31:30] Joseph envied
[1:31:32] hated because of what the Lord was doing
[1:31:35] but now here he is being delivered and
[1:31:37] the Lord was with him and he was a
[1:31:40] prosperous Man In The House of the
[1:31:42] master of the Egyptians and the master
[1:31:47] saw watch this the master saw that the
[1:31:51] Lord was with him
[1:31:53] and that the Lord made all that he did
[1:31:56] to prosper in his
[1:32:00] hand you mean to tell me his brothers
[1:32:03] look at what God was doing in his life
[1:32:06] and they hated him and now we've got a a
[1:32:09] master an owner of the slave Joseph
[1:32:12] Piper and he looks at him and he says
[1:32:15] look at what God's doing in your life
[1:32:17] all you touch
[1:32:20] prospers what's wrong with people around
[1:32:22] the church
[1:32:26] I'm going to get myself in
[1:32:28] trouble and Joseph found Grace in his
[1:32:31] sight and he served him and he made him
[1:32:33] overseer of his house and he all that he
[1:32:35] had he put into his hand and it came to
[1:32:38] pass from that time that he made him an
[1:32:40] Overseer in the house and over all that
[1:32:42] he had and the Lord blessed the
[1:32:44] Egyptians house for Joseph's
[1:32:47] sake yeah what would have happened if
[1:32:49] they would just kept him around their
[1:32:52] own house
[1:32:54] but
[1:32:55] no they wasn't happy with that they
[1:32:57] didn't like the way God's program was
[1:32:59] playing out they wanted to do it their
[1:33:02] way create their own pattern their own
[1:33:05] way of
[1:33:06] success but now here's Piper an old
[1:33:10] Egyptian who is re reaping the benefits
[1:33:14] of God through Joseph in his own
[1:33:19] house and he left all that he had into
[1:33:22] the hands of Joseph and he knew and he
[1:33:24] knew and he knew not all he had and he
[1:33:27] saved the bread which he did eat and
[1:33:29] Joseph was a goodly person and well
[1:33:32] favored you see you didn't get much
[1:33:34] higher than Piper Piper was right he was
[1:33:37] like the right hand at that time he was
[1:33:40] the one building up the military he was
[1:33:41] the protector of the Pharaoh and now
[1:33:44] Joseph is setting here God guiding his
[1:33:47] life what is God doing God's training
[1:33:51] him God trains us the things we go
[1:33:54] through is our boot camp it's our
[1:33:57] training it's God getting us ready to be
[1:34:00] able to
[1:34:02] believe and to be able to grasp what's
[1:34:05] going to happen in the end times and now
[1:34:07] here is Joseph he's learning how to
[1:34:10] speak Egyptian he's learning the customs
[1:34:13] of the Egyptians he's learning the
[1:34:15] hieroglyphics he's learning how to write
[1:34:17] in Egyptian so now he's bilingual you
[1:34:21] know this all comes into play at the end
[1:34:23] when his brothers come and they try to
[1:34:24] conspire again a little story and they
[1:34:26] think he can't understand
[1:34:28] them he hears every word they
[1:34:31] say and so here he is he's being trained
[1:34:35] and and pfer looks at this situation and
[1:34:38] pfer looks at this and says this is not
[1:34:39] ordinary
[1:34:41] Prosperity brothers and sisters the
[1:34:43] Bride of Jesus Christ prospers different
[1:34:45] than other people
[1:34:48] prosper and if you're not experiencing
[1:34:50] that open your eyes
[1:34:54] the bride is taken care
[1:34:57] of and here now Joseph here potterer
[1:35:00] look at this he says there is something
[1:35:01] out of the ordinary with the way this
[1:35:03] guy operates there is something greater
[1:35:06] that is driving him there is something
[1:35:09] greater that motivates him and there's
[1:35:11] something greater that pushes him to do
[1:35:13] what he's doing and brothers and sisters
[1:35:15] I want it to be set of me I want it to
[1:35:17] be said of you that when my feet Hit the
[1:35:20] Floor there's something different that
[1:35:22] motivates that guy
[1:35:24] there's something that different that
[1:35:25] pushes that
[1:35:29] guy he don't act like everybody else you
[1:35:31] don't act like everybody else can you
[1:35:34] imagine what it would be like if
[1:35:35] everybody said that that that group over
[1:35:37] there is never
[1:35:40] negative you ever had a negative day
[1:35:45] sir
[1:35:49] yeah sometimes it like to be a fly on
[1:35:51] the wall
[1:35:57] what if that group was never negative
[1:36:00] what what if that group of people over
[1:36:02] there didn't have nothing but
[1:36:03] encouraging words to say what if that
[1:36:06] group over there always had nothing but
[1:36:08] a but a but a a a Christian song on
[1:36:11] their
[1:36:14] tongue I
[1:36:16] seen I seen on
[1:36:20] the I don't know where I've seen it but
[1:36:23] I've seen where somebody put this
[1:36:25] illustration out and saidwhat if we
[1:36:27] spend as much time reading our Bibles as
[1:36:28] we do looking at
[1:36:30] Facebook man that struck a Accord with
[1:36:34] me because I I don't I'm guilty I just
[1:36:38] tell you I I'm
[1:36:39] guilty I can get
[1:36:42] consumed I'm making a confession to you
[1:36:46] I can get consumed sitting there looking
[1:36:48] at that thing because one thing leads to
[1:36:51] another and then once they see what
[1:36:52] you're searching and what you're
[1:36:53] researching everything they show is
[1:36:56] exactly what you're looking for man I've
[1:36:58] learned 50 million diets this
[1:37:02] week fasting water vinegar
[1:37:09] lemon well some of you
[1:37:12] Angels need to let me know y'all look at
[1:37:14] Facebook
[1:37:20] too but he doesn't act like everybody
[1:37:23] else in Jo and Piper looks at this and
[1:37:25] he he looks and notices Joseph and he
[1:37:28] puts him in charge of everything now I
[1:37:30] want you to notice that look looking at
[1:37:33] this Joseph has been up he's been down
[1:37:37] he's been up he's been down he's up
[1:37:43] again praise the Lord God is good life
[1:37:46] is good I'm prospering look at Piper he
[1:37:49] loves me and then it came to pass his
[1:37:51] master's Wife cast her eyes on
[1:37:55] him
[1:38:00] well oh
[1:38:03] devil what does she say lie with
[1:38:07] me
[1:38:09] Temptation Temptation begins to set in
[1:38:12] man we're hitting it all tonight hate
[1:38:14] Envy jealousy
[1:38:17] temptation all of this is happening in
[1:38:20] the life of Joseph and it happens in the
[1:38:23] lives of all
[1:38:25] believers it's a cycle that we have to
[1:38:27] go through we we're down we're up I'm
[1:38:29] not saying we're we're
[1:38:31] bipolar but I'm saying we go through ups
[1:38:34] and downs and mountains and
[1:38:36] valleys but I want to live on the
[1:38:38] mountain more than I do in the valley
[1:38:41] and as one preacher said I don't want to
[1:38:43] live on the mount uh just good enough I
[1:38:46] want to live on the mount more than
[1:38:49] enough and so here he is this is
[1:38:52] constantly going up and down and she
[1:38:54] says lie with
[1:38:56] me after all he's gone through you think
[1:38:59] he's finally arrived and things are
[1:39:00] going to balance out in his life but
[1:39:02] here comes more
[1:39:04] trouble trouble is coming around and
[1:39:07] Joseph this well-built handsome dark
[1:39:10] complected young
[1:39:14] man has caught the eyes of Piper's wife
[1:39:20] and now Piper's wife saysi want it all
[1:39:25] I want all that God's done for
[1:39:28] you all the
[1:39:30] blessings I'm going to steal it all of
[1:39:33] your joy I'm going to take it your your
[1:39:37] prosperous life I'm going to destroy you
[1:39:39] know that's what the devil does kill
[1:39:40] steal and destroy and so here she is
[1:39:42] she's looked at this and and she's
[1:39:44] looked at this and she says now I want
[1:39:45] you to lie with me go to bed with me and
[1:39:48] Joseph tells her no no no now watch what
[1:39:52] Joseph says he says I can't do this to
[1:39:55] the master who owns the
[1:39:58] house such respect at this time but more
[1:40:02] importantly what he says next is what
[1:40:04] gets me he says I can't sin like this
[1:40:08] against
[1:40:11] God in the hour of probably his greatest
[1:40:15] Temptation Piper's wife was no doubt a
[1:40:18] beautiful woman most Egyptian women were
[1:40:21] they had all the beauty secrets all the
[1:40:23] the lotions the creams the saves and
[1:40:26] they were well doctored you might
[1:40:29] say well
[1:40:31] manicured and now she has throwed
[1:40:33] herself at
[1:40:34] him and he's in this time of
[1:40:37] Temptation and he says I can't do this
[1:40:40] to my
[1:40:41] God what do we do when we're faced with
[1:40:45] temptation we have to have the attitude
[1:40:47] that Joseph did and say I can't do this
[1:40:50] to my God I love him too much you see
[1:40:54] Joseph wasn't worried about the popular
[1:40:56] part of the world he wasn't worried
[1:40:59] about what the world thought he wasn't
[1:41:01] worried about about his what his friends
[1:41:03] would say Oh you mean you turned her
[1:41:06] down she's beautiful he didn't care he
[1:41:10] didn't care what everybody else thought
[1:41:12] he only cared about what his God
[1:41:16] thought you see brothers and sisters his
[1:41:19] only concern was pleasing God if we
[1:41:23] lived every day with our only concern
[1:41:25] God how can I please you
[1:41:28] today God how can I please you today
[1:41:30] what can I do to make to make to make
[1:41:33] you uh uh first in my life because you
[1:41:36] know that's what matters he wanted to
[1:41:37] keep God first no matter what and when I
[1:41:41] looked up at the brother brandom says it
[1:41:43] this way he says brothers and sisters if
[1:41:45] you'll put God first in everything you
[1:41:47] do you're bound to come out all
[1:41:49] right put God first Seek You first the
[1:41:53] kingdom of God have you ever witnessed
[1:41:56] that to be the truth put God
[1:41:59] first he keeps
[1:42:03] on pay your tie
[1:42:10] first people think why you preach on
[1:42:13] ties I don't get none of it I mean I
[1:42:15] don't I it don't come to me so I can
[1:42:17] preach on it sometimes it's hard for
[1:42:19] pastors to preach on it but it ain't
[1:42:21] hard for me to preach on it
[1:42:27] why do you preach on ties because it
[1:42:28] ain't your money
[1:42:33] anyway we made it through rough times
[1:42:36] because my wife paid
[1:42:38] ties I tell you that's the truth When We
[1:42:40] Were Young getting started I thought man
[1:42:42] I ain't giving no more money I got to
[1:42:43] have this money she said no we pay our
[1:42:47] ties I said but we can't afford to pay
[1:42:49] ties' she said you can't afford not to
[1:42:51] pay TI
[1:42:59] I I told my boys I try to teach them pay
[1:43:02] your ties first I said because here's
[1:43:04] what happens I said let me tell you from
[1:43:06] experience this is what happens now let
[1:43:08] this be a lesson to you young people
[1:43:09] okay if you start making money pay you
[1:43:11] ties if you make $10 pay a dollar okay
[1:43:15] make a 100 pay 10 you see how that
[1:43:17] works you pay it
[1:43:21] first because you say well well I need
[1:43:24] all of my paycheck this week cuz I know
[1:43:26] how it is when you're young and you get
[1:43:27] these little paychecks coming in you get

[1:43:31] bucks 150
[1:43:33] bucks you need that $150 don't you you
[1:43:36] like to have
[1:43:40] $150 sure you would but what happens is
[1:43:43] you say well I need it this week and I
[1:43:45] need next week because I need to go buy
[1:43:47] my my sweetheart a a birthday
[1:43:51] present I I'll catch up on my ties

[1:43:59] for some heartache and I'm not talking
[1:44:01] about that little
[1:44:03] boy pay your ties
[1:44:08] first because you you take and you take
[1:44:11] and you take and next thing you know you
[1:44:12] owe $5 $600 in
[1:44:15] ties and then you realize how in the
[1:44:18] world am I ever going to get5 or $600 of
[1:44:20] tithing
[1:44:24] you make a dollar pay 10 cents you make
[1:44:27] 10,000 you pay a th000 100,000 10,000
[1:44:29] you see how that
[1:44:32] works y'all done got me off my
[1:44:40] script keep God first pay your ties
[1:44:43] first pay everything pay first PR pay
[1:44:46] God pay first pray first at the morning
[1:44:49] pray all through the day give God the
[1:44:51] first place in everything you'll be a
[1:44:56] witness how many can testify and say
[1:44:58] that's the truth I'm a witness that's
[1:45:01] the
[1:45:04] truth I'm G to have to find a place like
[1:45:06] brother juwel said to parachute out this
[1:45:10] helicopter I'm halfway through y'all
[1:45:13] this this y'all just pulling it you're
[1:45:15] pulling it
[1:45:16] out so one day he walks into this house
[1:45:19] and she grabs the coat and demands him
[1:45:21] come to bed with me and he turns and run
[1:45:25] and she's left holding what the coat
[1:45:29] what's up with this guy in his coats can
[1:45:30] he stay in his
[1:45:32] clothes one time he loses a c he's in a
[1:45:35] pit next time he loses a c he's in her
[1:45:39] fantasies I'd rather be in the
[1:45:43] pit this man needs to learn to keep his
[1:45:45] coat
[1:45:47] on life is coming at him hard he's on
[1:45:51] the run and he begins to he leaves his
[1:45:53] coat behind and pfer hears this and she
[1:45:56] cries out she cries out and says listen
[1:45:59] this little slave boy of yours he tried
[1:46:01] to come in and and take me to bed he
[1:46:03] tried to seduce me into sleeping with
[1:46:05] him and I've got his coat to prove
[1:46:08] it and Piper hears this and he throws
[1:46:11] Joseph
[1:46:13] where you know I I I really have a
[1:46:17] respect for
[1:46:20] Piper because if somebody
[1:46:25] mistreats my
[1:46:27] wife they're probably not going to
[1:46:29] prison they're probably going to the
[1:46:32] Grave let's just be
[1:46:34] honest if you're trying to pull on
[1:46:37] y'all's wife what she said he tried to
[1:46:40] pull but I have a respect for potier
[1:46:43] because apparently potier knowed what
[1:46:44] kind of woman he was married
[1:46:47] to you let that sink
[1:46:51] in if she was a trusty woman if she was
[1:46:55] a faithful wife if she was somebody that
[1:46:58] could be trusted he would have done away
[1:47:00] with Joseph
[1:47:02] immediately but he knew what she was
[1:47:04] what he was married to and he knew what
[1:47:07] kind of loyalty Joseph had and so he had
[1:47:10] no choice he had to do something so he
[1:47:12] he puts him back into the prison now we
[1:47:14] would look at this and we might say this
[1:47:16] ain't
[1:47:18] fair this is not fair let me tell you
[1:47:21] life is not fair
[1:47:26] sometimes God delivers us out of hard
[1:47:28] situ situations and sometimes God takes
[1:47:30] us through hard
[1:47:32] situations but either way we get to the
[1:47:34] other side Joseph will be blessed for
[1:47:37] obeying God you think well he shouldn't
[1:47:39] be punished but he will be
[1:47:42] blessed in the hard times is when we
[1:47:45] grow it's in The Valleys when we grow
[1:47:48] it's under stress that when we get
[1:47:50] stronger you know muscles muscles don't
[1:47:53] get bigger muscles don't get harder if
[1:47:56] you don't put them under
[1:47:59] stress you say man I wish I look like uh
[1:48:02] what's his name
[1:48:04] Coleman what's Ron
[1:48:07] Coleman and you very lifting that
[1:48:11] Fort that's only lifting you
[1:48:15] doing I just seen a clip where Ron
[1:48:19] Coleman dead uh squatted 800 lbs three
[1:48:25] times that's why his legs look like this
[1:48:29] one of
[1:48:31] them why is because he puts his body
[1:48:34] under stress and he puts his body under
[1:48:36] the pressure and he begins to grow and
[1:48:38] so when we are growing we're under
[1:48:40] pressure we're under stress but God sees
[1:48:43] us through in those times and here is
[1:48:45] Joseph Joseph is in this prison for
[1:48:48] something he didn't do but what's he do
[1:48:51] he keeps the vision
[1:48:53] he's keeping his vision all the while
[1:48:56] all the time and he remembers what God
[1:48:58] is showing him he wasn't down there
[1:49:01] crying well this ain't
[1:49:03] fair I gave my heart to God and look
[1:49:06] where I'm at now he wasn't down there
[1:49:09] crying he was just down there being a
[1:49:11] leader he was down there having the kind
[1:49:13] of faith that Believers have to have
[1:49:15] knowing that God will get you through
[1:49:18] anything
[1:49:26] brothers and
[1:49:29] sisters I've got so much more we're
[1:49:31] going to have to just find a spot
[1:49:34] here but brothers and sisters God never
[1:49:37] forgets
[1:49:40] us do you realize that we're not going
[1:49:43] to get to we're not going to get to his
[1:49:44] brothers coming we're not going to get
[1:49:46] to to what happened uh when they come in
[1:49:48] front of him we're not going to get to
[1:49:49] any of that we're not going to get to
[1:49:50] what happened with Jesus we're not going
[1:49:52] to get to to what happened with Paul we
[1:49:54] got so many illustrations that we can
[1:49:56] take this to but one thing I want you to
[1:49:59] know is God never forgets us no matter
[1:50:01] where we're at no matter what condition
[1:50:03] you're
[1:50:05] in think about this if you back
[1:50:09] slide God don't forget
[1:50:12] you you may turn your back you may walk
[1:50:15] out on God you may think you're never
[1:50:17] going to be back and you're never going
[1:50:18] to go to church and you'll never do
[1:50:20] nothing for God he hadn't forgot you
[1:50:27] when you
[1:50:30] fall he picks you back up you say what
[1:50:33] if I fall
[1:50:35] again he picks you right back up well I
[1:50:39] keep tripping I can't quit tripping I
[1:50:41] just trip over
[1:50:43] everything he just keeps picking you up
[1:50:46] do you see how the favor of a loving God
[1:50:50] is Joseph kept his perspective Joseph
[1:50:53] kept his vision Joseph knew that God
[1:50:55] delivered him once he could do it
[1:50:58] again misery is something we can't
[1:51:01] Harbor and I'm going to close with this
[1:51:03] thought misery is a state of
[1:51:07] suffering you know the old saying misery
[1:51:10] loves company why is
[1:51:15] that they want somebody to cry with them
[1:51:19] they want somebody to to lay on their
[1:51:21] shoulder they want somebody that feel
[1:51:22] the same suffering and the same
[1:51:24] discomfort that they're going
[1:51:26] through Joseph wasn't in that P in that
[1:51:29] prison he wasn't in that pit full of
[1:51:34] misery I could hear him down there in
[1:51:36] that prison I'm one of them who are you
[1:51:38] I'm one of them one of who I'm one of
[1:51:45] them I'm going
[1:51:48] through well you breaking out of
[1:51:51] here I'm I'm going
[1:51:54] through I'll pay the price yeah you're
[1:51:57] going to pay a price when they catch you
[1:51:58] you better not try to run let me tell
[1:52:00] you brother don't try to run I'm not
[1:52:02] running from nobody I'm going through
[1:52:03] with God because God sees me through the
[1:52:06] hard
[1:52:11] times when you're desperate for God
[1:52:14] things change in your
[1:52:17] life Joseph is more or less running the
[1:52:20] prison
[1:52:21] now in pifer's
[1:52:24] house these two high ranking officials
[1:52:27] are
[1:52:30] imprisoned you got the cup Bearer and
[1:52:32] the
[1:52:36] baker they both done something that
[1:52:39] Pharaoh evidently didn't
[1:52:41] like because now they find themselves
[1:52:44] down in the
[1:52:45] prison and they're down there in the
[1:52:47] prison and they're trying to figure out
[1:52:48] how are we going to get out of this
[1:52:49] situation how are we going to get out of
[1:52:50] this what's going to change and so they
[1:52:52] go to sleep one night and they have a
[1:52:53] dream and lo and behold who's
[1:52:57] there let me tell you boys this is what
[1:53:01] I was born for come over here tell me
[1:53:04] all about
[1:53:06] it and they begin to tell the dream to
[1:53:09] Joseph and Joseph begins to to listen to
[1:53:11] the dream and and he begins to go back
[1:53:13] there and and he tells the he tells the
[1:53:15] cup Bearer your dream means in three
[1:53:17] days you're going to be restored back to
[1:53:19] your position with

[1:53:30] me yeah yeah I got you I got you
[1:53:34] bro I remember you put in I put in a
[1:53:37] good word for you well the baker he

[1:54:31] cup Bearer and here is the is the is the
[1:54:33] butler or the Baker and they come there
[1:54:36] and he brings the the cup to to
[1:54:39] pharaoh and he's looking at pharaoh and
[1:54:41] he's so happy to be back where he's at
[1:54:43] and he's got all the opportunity in the
[1:54:45] world to tell Pharaoh hey do you know
[1:54:47] how I knew I would be back here and he
[1:54:50] looks at pharaoh and hands him the cup
[1:54:53] and he forget
[1:54:58] Joseph no doubt Joseph was listening
[1:55:01] from the prison happy birthday
[1:55:04] Pharaoh oh thank God I'm going to get
[1:55:07] out of here I'm going to get out thank
[1:55:08] God this trial is
[1:55:10] over and he
[1:55:13] forgot
[1:55:15] Joseph two more
[1:55:20] years two more
[1:55:23] years God leaves him notice I said God
[1:55:27] leaves
[1:55:28] him in the
[1:55:35] prison but God has a way of bringing
[1:55:38] things
[1:55:41] around Pharaoh has a
[1:55:44] dream I don't know what the answer is to
[1:55:47] my dream I need help somebody please
[1:55:49] somebody with wisdom somebody who can
[1:55:51] interpret dreams can somebody please
[1:55:53] help
[1:55:54] me and that cut by cut bear says you
[1:55:57] know what I remember a
[1:56:01] guy there's a Hebrew fell he was down
[1:56:05] there in the prison with me his name was
[1:56:08] was was Jim Jo Joe
[1:56:13] Joseph if you Pharaoh if you will bring
[1:56:16] Joseph up here if you'll bring him up
[1:56:19] here he will listen to your dreams and
[1:56:21] he can tell you exactly what they mean
[1:56:23] he was perfect he knew I was going to be
[1:56:26] restored he knew you were going to hang
[1:56:28] the butler he knew all these things as
[1:56:30] soon as we told
[1:56:32] him so sometimes it may look like that
[1:56:38] God has forgotten
[1:56:40] you you know there's a song says I don't
[1:56:44] even know if you know my
[1:56:47] name can you imagine Joseph may have sat
[1:56:49] down there in that prison and say Lord I
[1:56:51] don't even know if you know my
[1:56:53] name have you ever been
[1:56:57] there God don't forget he brings him
[1:57:00] right back around into the very presence
[1:57:02] of pharaoh and Pharaoh tells him the
[1:57:05] dream and Joseph said your dream means
[1:57:09] this let's stand we'll close right there
[1:57:25] Prophet said in his
[1:57:27] prison he constantly remembered he was
[1:57:30] born for a
[1:57:32] purpose it may seem Grim it may seem
[1:57:35] dark it may seem like you're never going
[1:57:37] to get to the place that you want to be
[1:57:39] I've been working for 30s something
[1:57:41] years to try to get to the place I want
[1:57:42] to
[1:57:45] be some of you probably been working
[1:57:48] longer than
[1:57:50] that just keep working just keep trying
[1:57:54] just keep pushing just keep doing but he
[1:57:57] said in this in this prison he
[1:57:58] constantly remembered he was born for a
[1:58:01] purpose he was born for a purpose and he
[1:58:03] was going to sit by a
[1:58:07] king although the rest of them was going
[1:58:09] to Bow a knee to him his vision told him
[1:58:12] so but before his vision could
[1:58:14] completely be fulfilled he had to become
[1:58:16] a
[1:58:17] prisoner and he had to become a ruler
[1:58:21] and he had to come from the prison house
[1:58:23] and he had to become a prisoner of the
[1:58:25] word of God that he could only say what
[1:58:29] God put in his mouth then God moved
[1:58:34] through
[1:58:35] him how many would say
[1:58:38] God I want to become a prisoner of your
[1:58:41] word I want to become a prisoner of your
[1:58:43] love I want to become a prisoner of your
[1:58:46] passion and what you would have in store
[1:58:47] for us Heavenly Father you see the hands
[1:58:50] raised amongst the building the night

[1:59:18] life that you're there with us through

[1:59:22] find himself up and then he would find
