[37:33] for us now jesus name
[37:35] amen and amen
[37:37] praise the lord tonight i just want to
[37:38] have a bible study would that be okay
[37:41] kind of a bible study amen and i
[37:43] mentioned wednesday or sunday i believe
[37:45] it was
[37:46] amen as we spoke
[37:47] amen uh
[37:49] perhaps speaking
[37:53] on the amen
[37:57] and so if you will let's turn to the
[38:00] book of revelations if you will and i do
[38:02] want to do quite a i actually i want to
[38:04] do quite a bit of reading i mean out of
[38:06] the bible i don't even think i have one
[38:08] quote yeah i got one here
[38:11] but other than that it's all just
[38:12] scriptures
[38:14] amen and so
[38:16] we'll go to the 17th chapter of
[38:19] revelations and i really want to cover
[38:21] 14 15 16 17 18 18 and maybe
[38:27] it's up to you if you want to cover a
[38:28] little on 19 or not if you want to go
[38:32] that long but anyway i want to cover
[38:34] some of those and there's certain things
[38:36] i want to pull out of there and we want
[38:37] to just learn something here with the
[38:39] help of the lord
[38:40] and so revelations i believe it's 17 i
[38:43] want to go to
[38:46] revelation 17 and there came one
[38:50] of the seven angels which had the seven
[38:52] miles
[38:55] and talked with me saying unto me come
[38:57] hither
[38:58] and i will show you show unto thee the
[39:01] judgment of the great
[39:03] that setteth upon many waters amen
[39:07] whom with whom the kings of the earth
[39:09] have committed fornication the
[39:11] inhabitants of the earth have been made
[39:13] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[39:16] amen may god bless his word you can be
[39:18] seated
[39:19] amen i want to go back to the third
[39:22] chapter because we know that this is the
[39:24] same woman jezebel found in the 20th
[39:27] verse of the second chapter
[39:29] notwithstanding i have a few things
[39:31] against he because thou sufferest that
[39:33] woman jezebel which calleth herself a
[39:35] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[39:38] servants to commit fornication amen so
[39:42] we see her already there
[39:44] causing
[39:45] his servants to commit fornication over
[39:48] in verse
[39:49] 2 of 17
[39:52] he says that uh with whom the kings of
[39:54] the earth have committed fornication and
[39:56] the inhabitants of the earth have been
[39:58] made drunk with the wine
[40:00] of her fornication now we know the
[40:03] prophet of god taught us that wine
[40:05] represents stimulation don't he i always
[40:07] wondered what would that what that could
[40:10] be you know
[40:11] and uh i suppose you know i suppose that
[40:14] there is a certain stimulation that
[40:16] comes with fornication
[40:18] all right
[40:19] to if you're evil and you got a bad
[40:22] spirit on you to actually cheat on your
[40:24] spouse or this side or the other and and
[40:26] there's perhaps some thrill that they
[40:28] get out of that hello something that
[40:30] goes along with that you know some kind
[40:32] of a simulation that people get you know
[40:34] and it's the same way spiritually it
[40:36] seems that certain people get certain
[40:38] stimulation out of actually uh you know
[40:41] defying god or coming against god amen
[40:45] and so
[40:46] but it has to be something that's very
[40:48] alluring to the world to the world
[40:50] let me say this this is just
[40:52] me
[40:53] but when we look at the book of
[40:54] revelations we find out one thing about
[40:56] the book of revelations that you really
[40:59] don't find near as much over in the new
[41:02] testament okay and that is plain talk
[41:07] right
[41:08] i mean it gets really specific right it
[41:10] talks about uh the filthiness of her
[41:13] fornication and so forth and and all of
[41:15] these things the abominations and
[41:17] everything he gets real and calls her a
[41:21] calls her little churches harlots and
[41:23] things like that
[41:24] getting real strong you know because you
[41:26] know brother bam said that the church
[41:28] goes up in the third chapter of
[41:29] revelation come back in the 19th
[41:32] so you know a lot of this here how many
[41:33] knows a lot of this is in the
[41:35] tribulation period of course after the
[41:37] blood is lifted
[41:39] is that right the blood is lifted
[41:41] already gone from the earth when god
[41:43] looks at sin
[41:44] in that right it look he calls it for
[41:46] what he is and he gets real plain in the
[41:50] book of revelations about what it is and
[41:52] we know the battle let me say this first
[41:54] of all that the battle and these
[41:56] language that he uses the mother of
[41:58] harlots and so forth
[42:00] you know he's not talking about the
[42:02] sinner
[42:04] as a matter of fact he don't talk all
[42:06] that much about the just unbeliever
[42:08] but he talks more about the make
[42:10] believer or what you call the antichrist
[42:13] or that which
[42:14] is so close that if it was possible it
[42:17] would deceive the very elected
[42:19] he deals with a church when he talks
[42:21] about a woman a woman who represents a
[42:23] church and she is the mother of holland
[42:26] she's the mother of churches
[42:28] amen tonight with the help of the law we
[42:31] also want to look at at what the prophet
[42:33] of god said and it was pretty startling
[42:34] because when the man gets real plain he
[42:36] says you can't have an education in
[42:38] anymore you know because it's of the
[42:40] devil
[42:42] you know a lot of time you send your
[42:43] kids to school unless they are really
[42:45] you know even nowadays you got to be
[42:47] very very careful amen you know because
[42:50] he said they'll come out twofold more a
[42:52] child of hell than what they went in
[42:54] and uh colleges of course we know
[42:56] they're nothing but this the absolute
[42:58] corruption
[42:59] all right
[43:00] and and everything that's being taught
[43:02] there and so he says education what did
[43:04] he say
[43:06] he says civilization and education and
[43:08] so forth and uh science and progress
[43:11] what he said is all of
[43:13] [Music]
[43:14] the devil
[43:17] now
[43:18] talk about civilization civilization as
[43:20] a whole everything all of this
[43:21] civilization this whole civilization
[43:24] first of all is of the devil
[43:27] amen
[43:29] and so we see here that
[43:31] it can satan everything here is going to
[43:33] ultimately talking about uh the mark of
[43:36] the beast and so forth and that squeeze
[43:38] that we talked about sunday how that
[43:40] it'll come to where people will lose
[43:42] things and i just read a quote today
[43:44] even better bam says he says you know
[43:46] there's going to come a day when they're
[43:47] going to put a
[43:49] sign on our door closed
[43:51] amen that's what he said about his own
[43:53] he believed that they would come
[43:55] and you know and it's right at that time
[43:58] you know we know that right at that time
[44:00] it's when the bride's gonna leave
[44:02] amen
[44:03] right during that screech during that
[44:05] time amen i believe that god is going to
[44:07] come and take us home
[44:08] praise the lord because god always takes
[44:10] care of his people don't he how many is
[44:12] glad for that
[44:13] and again we see that this is not a not
[44:15] not so much a uh you know dealing with
[44:18] sinners and so forth but it's dealing
[44:20] with with churches it's dealing with uh
[44:23] the mark of the beasts and so forth
[44:25] the mark of the antichrist dealing with
[44:27] the antichrist somebody something that
[44:30] looks like christ or churches in general
[44:33] isn't that right and i just put down
[44:35] here that you know sign civilization
[44:38] everything even even your money i want
[44:40] to say even your money
[44:41] is controlled
[44:43] by the devil
[44:46] all right now i don't want to say that
[44:48] it's of the devil because you know i
[44:50] wouldn't want anything in my pocket that
[44:51] was straight up off the devil now the
[44:53] love of money is the root of all evil
[44:55] how many knows that
[44:57] but it's controlled by the devil amen
[44:59] and if uh you know so people get the
[45:01] love in that and and so forth and um i
[45:05] want to do more reading but listen when
[45:07] you think about it you know it's going
[45:08] to come
[45:09] right down to it's going to come right
[45:11] down to that to where
[45:14] uh you know you won't be able to buy or
[45:15] sell unless you are taking the mark of
[45:17] the beast now i read a quote today
[45:19] brother adam's talking about the market
[45:21] beast he says the mark of the beast is
[45:22] going on right now
[45:24] it's happening right now he says the
[45:26] mark of the beast let me tell you what
[45:27] it is he says is to reject the baptism
[45:31] of the holy ghost
[45:32] [Music]
[45:34] tonight we talk about the
[45:38] judgment of the holy
[45:40] part with that thing
[45:44] you can't be associated with it you
[45:46] can't think like it thinks
[45:48] because i read a quote today he says you
[45:50] know it's not a tattoo on your forehead
[45:53] no it's knowledge it has to do with what
[45:55] you have knowledge of or believe or what
[45:58] you partake of he called it a deed
[46:01] either partaking of it and and you know
[46:03] whether it's sponsoring or be a part of
[46:05] it or to believe what it believes
[46:09] it's really something brothers and
[46:10] sisters
[46:11] if somebody comes and he somebody
[46:13] gossips to you and they tell you
[46:14] something about somebody and you believe
[46:17] that i'm here to tell you right now you
[46:19] will take a spirit that comes with that
[46:24] or you can choose to police say no i
[46:26] don't really believe that you know
[46:28] you know well i'll tell you what you
[46:30] keep the right attitude let's just pray
[46:31] for that person
[46:33] but if you
[46:34] leave an evil report
[46:36] well this comes just as i'm thinking
[46:38] here brother bram says even if you
[46:40] listen to gossip the holy ghost will go
[46:43] just for listening to gospel
[46:45] but what i'm trying to say the point
[46:47] that i'm making is same way with false
[46:49] doctrine because remember the three
[46:50] unclean frogs right the three unclean
[46:53] frogs they were a trinity doctrine
[46:56] and you get a you get a real trinity
[46:59] person
[47:01] that has that spirit of trinitarian on
[47:04] them and you try to tell them there's no
[47:05] three gods
[47:07] i'll tell you what they can get very
[47:09] angry
[47:12] they call you names call you antichrist
[47:14] and everything else and they get a real
[47:16] added there's a spirit that comes with
[47:18] that thing
[47:20] amen everything's just here so you know
[47:22] father son holy ghost and so forth hello
[47:27] it's a trinity false doctrine
[47:30] amen
[47:31] all right let's teach a little shall we
[47:35] so we see here
[47:37] let me put this down i've got to plumb
[47:38] up around my neck here
[47:41] all right
[47:44] all right first of all let's go to
[47:46] chapter 14
[47:51] we want to start our top
[47:57] all right and that's that
[47:59] if you can do the search on brother
[48:00] branham he makes preference when he
[48:02] reads his scripture he makes reference
[48:04] to billy graham oral roberts
[48:06] and then the last of cage age messenger
[48:08] there's a third messenger he talks about
[48:10] that
[48:12] and you know the thing that we speak
[48:14] about here we we find so much of this
[48:16] all right well let me just leave that
[48:18] alone and i saw another angel fly in the
[48:20] midst of heaven
[48:22] having the everlasting gospel to preach
[48:25] to them that dwell upon the earth
[48:27] and to every nation notice billy graham
[48:29] and different ones went to every nation
[48:31] right preaching the gospel every nation
[48:34] and kindred and tongue and people sing
[48:36] with a loud voice fear god
[48:38] and give glory to him
[48:40] for the hour of his judgment is come
[48:45] isaiah i believe it was
[48:46] i don't think i got it mark but isaiah
[48:51] let me let me just pick this up a little
[48:54] bit like i said if we could
[48:57] take a lot of time on these things but
[49:03] talking about now notice
[49:05] here he says the hour of
[49:09] his judgment is come how many believes
[49:11] that's where we're at
[49:13] we're coming right at the hour of this
[49:15] judgment i believe it just comes to mind
[49:18] how that brother banner if you remember
[49:20] he the spirit told him to pick up a rock
[49:23] and throw it up in the air right
[49:25] he talks about judgment he's going after
[49:27] it went up and came back down he said it
[49:30] created a whirlwind
[49:32] and it went north somewhere you know and
[49:35] a day or two later he says alaska like
[49:37] to have some
[49:39] and all up and down he says you know and
[49:41] from what i gathered it was like the
[49:43] beginning of judgment
[49:45] just i went after look all over the
[49:47] earth look at the tsunamis a couple
[49:48] years ago 500 000 wiped out just one
[49:51] after the other after the other
[49:53] you know
[49:54] but it's the hour i believe it's the
[49:56] hour of judgment amen not you know not
[49:59] the tribulation period but god's
[50:00] judgment and word now notice and worship
[50:03] him that made heaven and earth and sea
[50:06] and the mountains and waters
[50:08] now what i went to isaiah for for just a
[50:10] minute
[50:12] because
[50:13] jesus repeated this scripture
[50:15] but he didn't read all of it when he
[50:17] says the acceptable year of the lord and
[50:20] that's where he stopped it didn't go on
[50:22] the spirit of the lord
[50:24] god is upon me because the lord hath
[50:26] anointed me to preach good tidings to
[50:28] the meek he has sent me to bind the
[50:30] brokenhearted to proclaim limiting the
[50:32] captives and the opening of the prison
[50:35] to them that are bound and to proclaim
[50:37] the acceptable year and right there
[50:39] jesus stopped
[50:41] and then he says but the bible says in
[50:43] that same one and the day of vengeance
[50:45] of our god
[50:47] wow
[50:48] see there's another message coming
[50:49] there's another part of that it has to
[50:51] be fulfilled the day of vengeance of our
[50:53] god
[50:55] how many believes that's upon the world
[50:58] and the tribulation will be the day of
[51:00] the vengeance of almighty god
[51:04] okay let's go on
[51:06] so he says that's right and he stops
[51:08] there all right that was pretty much
[51:09] that first angel's message and there
[51:11] followed another angel saying babylon is
[51:14] fallen is fallen that great city because
[51:17] she made all nations drink of the wine
[51:19] of the wrath of her fornication
[51:22] amen
[51:24] and the third angel followed not only
[51:26] does the third angel follow them saying
[51:28] with a loud voice if any man worship the
[51:31] beast and his image and receive his mark
[51:34] in his forehead or in his hand
[51:36] the same shall drink of the wine of the
[51:38] wrath of god which is poured out without
[51:41] mixture into the cup of his indignation
[51:44] and he shall be tormented with fire and
[51:46] brimstone in the presence of the holy
[51:49] angels and in the presence of the lamb
[51:52] and the smoke of their torment ascended
[51:54] up forever and ever and they have no
[51:56] rest day nor night who worship the beast
[51:59] and his image
[52:03] boy if brother banham didn't clear that
[52:04] up he says that the beast of course we
[52:07] know is rome
[52:08] the image of the beast is
[52:10] the world council of churches
[52:13] all right
[52:13] or any denomination that rejects the
[52:16] word of god
[52:18] remember to reject one word of god but i
[52:20] heard him say he says your soul is
[52:22] hanging it's dangling over hell
[52:25] by one word
[52:27] you just break that one word it's all it
[52:29] takes
[52:30] because jesus said man shall not live by
[52:31] bread alone but by every word that
[52:34] proceedeth out of the mouth of god what
[52:35] about all these people that are throwing
[52:37] a lot of it out
[52:39] go on
[52:41] god is not going to have a bride up
[52:43] there that disagrees with his word
[52:47] i mean
[52:48] that's not going to be an argument with
[52:50] us
[52:51] now what he says is true
[52:55] [Music]
[52:56] amen
[52:57] the wife can say no you're wrong
[53:00] but not with god because he always says
[53:02] the right and perfect thing
[53:04] amen
[53:05] hallelujah
[53:07] and here now notice so all those that
[53:09] receive his mark is going to be
[53:11] tormented so here's the patience of the
[53:13] saints and here are they that keep the
[53:15] commandments of god and the faith of
[53:17] jesus christ
[53:21] amen
[53:22] now let's go on down and just keep
[53:26] reading here and i heard a voice from
[53:28] heaven saying unto me right blessed are
[53:31] the dead to die in the lord from
[53:32] henceforth yea saith the spirit that
[53:34] they may rest from all their labors and
[53:36] the book and their works do follow them
[53:39] and i beheld
[53:41] a white cloud
[53:43] and upon the cloud one sat like unto the
[53:46] son of man
[53:48] having on his head a golden crown
[53:52] amen
[53:55] one set like unto the son of man having
[53:57] a golden crown and his in his hand
[54:01] a sharp sickle
[54:03] and another angel came out of the
[54:05] temples cried with a loud voice saying
[54:08] the ambulance out on thrust in thy
[54:10] sickle and reap for the time is come for
[54:14] thee to reap
[54:16] amen
[54:17] for the harvest of the earth is right
[54:21] how many believes that we're at harvest
[54:24] time
[54:26] we are at harvest time and god is going
[54:28] to reap one of these days all that he
[54:31] has bought and purchased and everything
[54:33] that he has sowed
[54:35] god is going to reap
[54:37] to himself
[54:40] all of his children of all the ages
[54:42] that's laying there under the altar
[54:45] how many know the prophet brother madam
[54:47] right now he's over there where he saw
[54:48] the vision of all those that he was
[54:50] shaking his hand
[54:51] never had going on before he's over
[54:53] there with that crowd but he's not with
[54:55] the crowd of irenaeus or martin or
[54:57] columba or paul he's not with that crowd
[55:01] isn't that the truth
[55:03] amen each one each age is gathered with
[55:06] their messenger
[55:09] amen like he says will paul have to
[55:11] answer yes he will
[55:12] you know they're over there they're
[55:14] gathered and they're waiting and
[55:16] and god is god is waiting to reap
[55:20] the benefits of what he did all that
[55:22] he's done
[55:24] i call it the finale i thought i call it
[55:26] almost the greatest event that's ever
[55:28] taken place in the in history
[55:32] because everything that god did from
[55:34] from the first star that he made the
[55:35] first thought that he ever had was to be
[55:38] with you and i how many believes that
[55:40] that was his heart's desires to be with
[55:42] his children
[55:44] and those who he has redeemed
[55:46] through the foolishness of preaching
[55:48] that believe his word
[55:53] how many knows church is powerful the
[55:55] word of god is powerful it just depends
[55:57] on if you receive it or not
[55:59] it all depends on how you're getting
[56:01] this
[56:03] amen praise be to god
[56:05] same way with the message of the hour it
[56:07] just depends on how you get it or not if
[56:09] you get it or not then it does you any
[56:11] good but god am in all of the ages see
[56:14] them all the way
[56:17] by the time
[56:18] surely we can sing like brother uh
[56:22] my mind
[56:24] jewel can't even think of jewel's name
[56:25] that's pretty bad
[56:28] won't it be a time
[56:34] oh yeah
[56:37] it's gonna be a time how many he's gonna
[56:39] be a time
[56:41] you know you gotta forgive me i get a
[56:43] little happy but you know it's just a
[56:44] little that foretaste a little bit a
[56:46] little bit of
[56:47] you know down payment we got the earnest
[56:50] how many believes you're sitting there
[56:51] with the earnest of the resurrection
[56:54] you already got the quarter you've
[56:55] already got part of it i'm looking
[56:58] forward to it
[57:00] you're looking forward to it
[57:03] and the one thing i didn't mention it
[57:04] just came to my mind so we'll pop back a
[57:06] little bit and go backwards
[57:09] because what we're doing is we're really
[57:11] looking at
[57:14] a christian
[57:16] looks at
[57:17] not the things that we see isn't that
[57:19] right
[57:21] but the things that we cannot see
[57:25] amen
[57:31] like paul said
[57:35] first second corinthians 2
[57:38] and
[57:46] ii corinthians
[57:50] 2 and verse 18 while we look not
[57:54] at things which are seen
[57:56] but at the things which are not seen
[57:58] for the things which are seen
[58:00] brother bran and remember he got into
[58:02] this dispute with somebody one time and
[58:04] he says you know i won't believe
[58:06] anything that i can't see he's
[58:09] and you know if i can't see it it ain't
[58:11] real
[58:12] and brother bam says i prove to you that
[58:14] anything you can see is not real
[58:17] it's only the things that you can't see
[58:19] that are
[58:20] real and in other words for the word
[58:23] real would to be would be temporal
[58:27] because guess what
[58:28] i'm live here i'm going jesus but it's
[58:30] not real
[58:32] because in time i'd be dead in the grave
[58:34] gone hello
[58:37] and so forth it passes away
[58:41] it's temporal paul calls it
[58:44] but the love that i got that eternal
[58:46] life and the soul that you can't see
[58:48] that thomas that's on the ins that's
[58:50] real
[58:54] and see folks i'm here to tell you
[58:56] tonight if you don't get nothing out of
[58:57] the message tonight other than this
[58:59] remember this that
[59:00] we put too much emphasis on the things
[59:03] that we see
[59:05] not enough emphasis on the things that
[59:07] we can't see that are really real
[59:11] such as love
[59:13] the holy ghost
[59:15] and
[59:16] we have to remember to keep our eyes
[59:19] on god and the things that are eternal
[59:22] because these things are all everything
[59:25] is temporal we know that this is all
[59:27] getting shut down this is all going to
[59:29] be done one day this is going to be over
[59:32] with coming to church being here
[59:34] let me believe it's all going to be done
[59:36] it's going to be over with
[59:37] what then where are you going to be then
[59:40] amen
[59:42] that's why i love i love the lord
[59:44] because he promised us eternal life
[59:47] amen that temporal life but i want to
[59:49] just put that in there remember tonight
[59:51] that that's what we're looking at we're
[59:53] looking at eternal things and things
[59:55] that last forever and we're good looking
[59:57] at
[59:58] what i call the climax
[1:00:00] of satan
[1:00:02] and his kingdom i mean he has a climax
[1:00:05] we're coming that climax or as we're we
[1:00:08] called it here the reap for the harvest
[1:00:10] of the earth is
[1:00:12] ripe right so uh you know let me just
[1:00:16] say this this is my thought on it this
[1:00:18] is not what the prophet taught i don't
[1:00:20] even know what he taught that that
[1:00:21] certain certain scripture
[1:00:23] because i love to be able to go while
[1:00:24] brother ben said this about that
[1:00:26] scripture in revelations and that's
[1:00:28] that's what it is but if you didn't
[1:00:29] mention it guess what
[1:00:31] just have to and so to me he said that
[1:00:33] angel go and reap what you have go reap
[1:00:36] and i read this word it said it this way
[1:00:38] thrust in thy sickle and reap for the
[1:00:40] time is come for thee to reap
[1:00:43] it is time for you to reap
[1:00:46] the son of man on a cloud it's his time
[1:00:48] to read
[1:00:49] but verse 16 says and he had sat on the
[1:00:52] cloud thrust in his sickle and the earth
[1:00:54] was reaped
[1:00:55] and the earth was reap and in the
[1:00:58] conjunction
[1:00:59] another angel came out of the temple
[1:01:01] which is in heaven he also had a sharp
[1:01:04] cycle now here's another one now here's
[1:01:06] one group talking about perhaps
[1:01:08] the wheat and the tears
[1:01:10] and the angel came out from the altar
[1:01:12] which had power over fire and cried with
[1:01:15] a loud voice unto him that had the sharp
[1:01:17] sickle saying
[1:01:18] thrust in the icicle and gather the
[1:01:20] clusters of the vine
[1:01:24] of the earth remember brother ben
[1:01:26] preached on two vines
[1:01:28] i mean there's two vines
[1:01:30] there's a false vine there's a true vine
[1:01:34] and here the bible says that this vines
[1:01:36] these vines have come to fruition
[1:01:44] now how many know
[1:01:47] the good vine is coming to fruition
[1:01:51] my question is is that you
[1:01:54] is that me
[1:01:56] are we coming to fruition are we coming
[1:01:57] to being right
[1:02:00] just like a fruit you don't want to take
[1:02:02] it you don't want to pluck it until it's
[1:02:03] right

[1:05:19] the earth and gathered the vine of the
[1:05:22] earth and cast it into
[1:05:24] hello
[1:05:26] didn't talk about the other people
[1:05:27] getting cast into anything up here
[1:05:30] but here it talks about cast them into a
[1:05:32] great wine press
[1:05:34] of the wrath of god now we know that
[1:05:36] ain't bright
[1:05:38] huh that's got to be that false vine
[1:05:42] anybody
[1:05:44] that doesn't have the baptism of the
[1:05:46] holy ghost in their soul
[1:05:48] so
[1:05:49] all those that have taken the mark of
[1:05:51] the beast
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:57] all right and the wine press was
[1:06:00] trotting without the city and blood came
[1:06:03] out of the wine press even unto the
[1:06:05] horse's bridles
[1:06:09] let me tell you that's some deep blood
[1:06:11] in it
[1:06:13] by the space of a thousand six hundred
[1:06:16] furlongs
[1:06:17] my my my
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:24] now we want to skip over to
[1:06:28] let me see here
[1:06:31] chapter 16 chapter 16 and verse 1. and i
[1:06:34] heard a great voice out of the temple
[1:06:36] saying to the seven angels
[1:06:38] if you there's so many sevens in here
[1:06:41] seven angels seven miles three woes and
[1:06:43] so forth
[1:06:46] seven angels go your ways and pour out
[1:06:48] the vials of the wrath of god upon the
[1:06:51] earth
[1:06:52] and the first went and poured out his
[1:06:53] vial upon the earth and there fell a
[1:06:55] noiseman griezor
[1:06:59] upon the men
[1:07:00] amen which had the mark of the beast
[1:07:03] amen
[1:07:04] you think covets bad
[1:07:05] you wait until they get their sword it's
[1:07:07] going to be a whole different story
[1:07:10] upon them which worship his image
[1:07:12] and the second poured out his vial upon
[1:07:14] the sea and it became as blood of a dead
[1:07:16] man and every living soul died in the
[1:07:19] sea
[1:07:20] and the third angel poured out his vial
[1:07:22] upon the rivers and upon the one uh
[1:07:24] the waters and they became blood let me
[1:07:26] tell you something how many please even
[1:07:28] the prophet god said in the tribulation
[1:07:29] period moses and elijah they'll do what
[1:07:31] they used to do call flies turn the
[1:07:34] water into blood and all these things
[1:07:36] huh
[1:07:37] elijah will call for to stop the rain
[1:07:40] there won't be no harvest for anybody
[1:07:47] it is absolutely inconceivable how bad
[1:07:50] the tribulation period will be
[1:07:53] you can't imagine it being that bad
[1:07:58] and i heard an angel of the wilder say
[1:08:00] the angels of the waters say our
[1:08:02] righteous lord which art
[1:08:05] i like that which was
[1:08:07] and which shall be i like that he's
[1:08:09] everything
[1:08:10] he's the fastest he's the future he's
[1:08:12] the present because thou has
[1:08:15] judged thus
[1:08:17] wow remember it's god's judgment upon
[1:08:20] the horde
[1:08:21] for they have shed the blood now notice
[1:08:23] who jesus they have shut the blood of
[1:08:25] saints and of prophets and thou has
[1:08:28] given them blood to drink for
[1:08:31] they
[1:08:32] are worthy
[1:08:34] and i heard another
[1:08:36] out of the altar say even so lord god
[1:08:39] almighty true and righteous
[1:08:41] are thy judgments how many believes that
[1:08:44] when he serves judgment upon the world
[1:08:47] it'll be just
[1:08:50] because brother josh was singing oh love
[1:08:52] of god how rich and pure how measureless
[1:08:54] and strong it shall for it could we
[1:08:56] within the ocean field were
[1:09:00] something of parchment made where every
[1:09:02] on earth aquila and every man ascribed
[1:09:04] by trade another word a writer by trade
[1:09:07] to write the love of god with drain the
[1:09:09] ocean dry god has had so much mercy
[1:09:14] so much mercy i was thinking today you
[1:09:17] know if god would just pour out some
[1:09:18] wrath if he just pour on some rest once
[1:09:22] in a while everybody probably respect
[1:09:24] him a little more
[1:09:26] and even the prophet said you know god
[1:09:29] sends wars and any time there's wars
[1:09:31] second world war everybody comes to
[1:09:32] church you know everybody is good
[1:09:35] but whenever he said whenever
[1:09:36] everybody's prospering doing good church
[1:09:38] is empty out
[1:09:40] that's about how it is when man has it
[1:09:42] easy because we're prone we're prone to
[1:09:45] you know do do things the last thing or
[1:09:47] be pushed into it aren't we
[1:09:50] amen that's thus comes to saying if it
[1:09:52] wasn't for the last minute i wouldn't
[1:09:54] get done
[1:09:56] we kind of wait for the last minute we
[1:09:58] wait until we're pressured into things
[1:10:00] before we do it
[1:10:01] let me tell you something don't live
[1:10:02] like that don't be like that
[1:10:04] not until you're pressured into it no do
[1:10:06] it out of your heart
[1:10:08] through god now
[1:10:12] yeah sure he could
[1:10:14] i i am convinced
[1:10:16] maybe this is me but i'm convinced that
[1:10:18] god could get everybody to repent or try
[1:10:21] to or think about it you know
[1:10:24] yeah he could
[1:10:25] but he doesn't want to force him to he
[1:10:27] doesn't want people like that living
[1:10:29] with him huh
[1:10:33] just like marrying a wife you wouldn't
[1:10:34] want a wife that you forced to marry
[1:10:37] to marry or be with you
[1:10:39] amen at least i wouldn't
[1:10:41] if you forced her to do it and you
[1:10:43] punished her and beat her and all of
[1:10:45] that other stuff i'd hate to sleep
[1:10:47] beside her
[1:10:49] ain't no telling what my
[1:10:53] amen is saying with the lord he wants
[1:10:55] people that love do it out of your heart
[1:10:57] because you love it not because of fear
[1:10:59] not because of punishment or because of
[1:11:01] hard times don't don't wait to
[1:11:04] you know serve the lord desperately just
[1:11:05] because of desperation don't wait for
[1:11:07] desperate do it now
[1:11:09] are you with me
[1:11:11] praise the lord so we find here in one
[1:11:13] place as we go through here we'll find
[1:11:14] it here you find once again that they
[1:11:17] shed the blood you can't do
[1:11:20] you can't shed the blood of a righteous
[1:11:21] man you can't even give a cup of cold
[1:11:24] water to one of god's children but we
[1:11:25] receive a reward you can't say a word
[1:11:28] against them
[1:11:29] you say a word against each other
[1:11:33] say bad things about a preacher
[1:11:36] on that day of judgment he'll say you
[1:11:38] are guilty of murder
[1:11:40] 500 times because that's how many times
[1:11:43] you killed the influence of a preacher
[1:11:46] you're a murderer
[1:11:49] just because you said a little something
[1:11:52] yeah that's how serious
[1:11:53] wash the lips
[1:11:56] how many believes it
[1:11:58] the bible says you're going to give a
[1:11:59] word for every idol word you said
[1:12:01] we give an account for every word you
[1:12:04] say
[1:12:05] i've said it before let me say it again
[1:12:06] ain't nobody getting away with nothing
[1:12:09] nobody gets away with anything it's all
[1:12:12] recorded
[1:12:14] amen
[1:12:15] aren't you glad to go to judgment
[1:12:18] we're in judgment right now
[1:12:22] we're in purgatory right now
[1:12:26] that's what the prophet said
[1:12:27] that's right purge getting purged lord
[1:12:29] take that we come to church and that the
[1:12:32] judgment paul peter said begins at the
[1:12:34] house of god we preach a word and you
[1:12:37] judge yourself and say god i'm guilty
[1:12:40] lord forgive me see there's still mercy
[1:12:42] with judgment here
[1:12:44] you can be given you can be put it on
[1:12:46] the blood and be gone
[1:12:48] but we need mercy's lifted there's no
[1:12:50] more
[1:12:51] mercy with judgment
[1:12:53] the bible says he's going to have
[1:12:54] judgment without mercy
[1:12:57] amen
[1:12:58] on that white throne judgment there will
[1:13:00] be people that are giving life eternal
[1:13:02] let many knows that
[1:13:05] you know why because you did this and
[1:13:07] you did that they'll be judged according
[1:13:09] to these all right you did so and so the
[1:13:12] prophet god said there'll be a lot of
[1:13:13] people giving life and and so forth
[1:13:15] because of the good deeds that they did
[1:13:17] to his children
[1:13:20] huh
[1:13:21] that'd be the sheep it says on the right
[1:13:23] and there'd be goats on the left be
[1:13:24] separated
[1:13:25] but they're gonna be look look i know
[1:13:27] you did this but i'm gonna forgive you
[1:13:29] no there ain't gonna be none of that
[1:13:30] over there
[1:13:32] you know
[1:13:35] otherwise there would be mercy with
[1:13:36] judgment he says he's funny in that
[1:13:38] judgment day there's no mercy there's
[1:13:39] only what you did or didn't do and he
[1:13:41] judges you accordingly
[1:13:44] and we don't want to be there
[1:13:47] don't ask me why but look up the quote
[1:13:49] where brother brown says i don't want to
[1:13:50] be at that white throne judgment pierce
[1:13:51] me through with hot wires and all kinds
[1:13:54] of different things he said do do this
[1:13:55] but don't let me be at that white zone
[1:13:57] judgment
[1:13:59] oh it's going to be a terrible day
[1:14:02] amen
[1:14:03] see folks our politicians and all these
[1:14:06] people are doing whatever they're doing
[1:14:08] they just don't realize hey they're
[1:14:10] going to have to give account
[1:14:12] they're going to receive judgment for
[1:14:14] everything they do
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:20] all right but let's thank the lord for
[1:14:22] his grace and say lord
[1:14:27] if there's still something in your heart
[1:14:29] well i'll tell you what there ain't no
[1:14:30] way brother byler knew that but yet he
[1:14:32] touched that on my life right there
[1:14:35] you should say thank you lord
[1:14:37] you know because you're you're dealing
[1:14:39] with me on that spot and you want that
[1:14:40] gone because you have any sins if you
[1:14:43] have any sins like that you are
[1:14:45] you know you're gonna have to be judged
[1:14:46] with a
[1:14:49] amen because he's coming with for us
[1:14:51] pride that he's without spot without
[1:14:53] wrinkle
[1:14:55] amen search my heart of god see if there
[1:14:57] be any wicked way in me
[1:14:59] this is the hour of getting purged
[1:15:01] cleansed and so forth
[1:15:04] amen
[1:15:06] all right so now we're going to jump
[1:15:07] over to 17th chapter
[1:15:10] 17th chapter
[1:15:21] and there came one of the seven angels
[1:15:23] which had seven vials
[1:15:25] and talked with me saying on me
[1:15:28] i guess we this is the one we read
[1:15:29] earlier isn't it come here and i will
[1:15:31] show you the judgment of the great
[1:15:32] that sitteth upon many waters
[1:15:34] with whom the kings of the earth have
[1:15:36] committed fornication and the
[1:15:37] inhabitants of the earth have been made
[1:15:38] drunk
[1:15:39] with the wine of her fornication so he
[1:15:41] carried me away in the spirit in the
[1:15:43] wilderness and i saw a woman set upon a
[1:15:46] scarlet colored beast
[1:15:48] full of names of blasphemy
[1:15:52] having seven heads and ten horns
[1:15:55] and the woman kick was was a raid in
[1:15:57] purple
[1:15:58] and scarlet couple cup color and decked
[1:16:01] with gold and precious stones and pearls
[1:16:04] having in her golden cup in her hand
[1:16:07] oh my
[1:16:08] full of the abominations
[1:16:11] and the filthiness of her fornication
[1:16:15] i don't know about you but that's just
[1:16:17] about every word that you could possibly
[1:16:19] come up with to describe
[1:16:23] a
[1:16:24] dirty
[1:16:26] filth
[1:16:28] and a
[1:16:30] that's what he sees her as
[1:16:34] but that's the truth that's what she is
[1:16:37] and upon her forehead was the name
[1:16:39] written mystery babylon the great
[1:16:42] the mother of harlots and abominations
[1:16:46] of the earth
[1:16:48] amen
[1:16:51] and i saw the woman
[1:16:53] drunken with the blood of the saints and
[1:16:56] the blood of the martyrs of jesus
[1:16:58] and when i saw her i wonder with great
[1:17:00] admiration
[1:17:02] no doubt but outwardly perhaps she
[1:17:04] looked good
[1:17:06] all splendor in all glory
[1:17:09] but what's in her backyard
[1:17:12] a bunch of crosses a bunch of
[1:17:16] whole
[1:17:17] 68 million christians slaughtered
[1:17:21] in the most inhumane way
[1:17:24] think about this if that beast ever gets
[1:17:27] that power again
[1:17:29] that ultimate power
[1:17:32] that priest could tell the policeman
[1:17:34] arrest him and he would arrest him
[1:17:37] take him to jail i'll deal with him
[1:17:39] tomorrow that priest will be his judge
[1:17:41] and they'll decide what to do with him
[1:17:44] isn't that right
[1:17:46] churches going so forth they had the
[1:17:48] power they had more power than the cops
[1:17:50] or the local authority did
[1:17:52] amen we all know that it all goes back
[1:17:54] to roma right everything he goes back to
[1:17:56] rome think about this the catholic
[1:17:59] church is the only one that has ever
[1:18:00] survived the whole length of time
[1:18:03] huh
[1:18:05] rome fell greece different places fell
[1:18:08] all kinds of places fell but they
[1:18:10] endured that antichrist and it says
[1:18:12] it'll go
[1:18:13] you know another one will take its place
[1:18:15] and so forth and the last will take his
[1:18:16] place and go all the way into produce
[1:18:19] it's prophesied they would last but it's
[1:18:20] the antichrist
[1:18:24] all right
[1:18:26] i want to make sure i get to get down
[1:18:28] tonight and notice here
[1:18:31] i wonder with great admiration amen and
[1:18:35] of course now i'm not going to get into
[1:18:37] his seven hills it was sat on uh verse

[1:19:02] to some of this and go to 18.
[1:19:04] and after this
[1:19:10] i saw another angel come down from
[1:19:12] heaven having great power
[1:19:14] and the earth was lightened with his
[1:19:16] glory
[1:19:18] amen brother bannon makes reference to
[1:19:20] the message of the hour on this
[1:19:22] and he truly was how many knows he was
[1:19:24] absolutely lightened with his glory
[1:19:27] and he cried mightily with a strong
[1:19:29] voice

[1:19:38] voice of many waters

[1:28:12] for she has said in her heart i see the
[1:28:15] queen and i'll never see a sorrow

[1:28:47] that condom communism is working
[1:28:50] straight straight in the hands of
[1:28:52] almighty god now the quote said they're
[1:28:53] nothing but a hedonistic ungodly
[1:28:57] barbaric world or a nation that god has
[1:29:01] in her hands he says
[1:29:02] i'll tell you there's only one percent
[1:29:04] of russia that is communism the rest
[1:29:07] retards
[1:29:08] christianity but it's that one percent
[1:29:11] that rules
[1:29:12] right
[1:29:13] he says if it wasn't god's will if they
[1:29:15] weren't in the hands of god to do this
[1:29:18] he says those people would have
[1:29:19] overthrown russia a long time ago
[1:29:22] how many knows that all of all of these
[1:29:24] other countries you know uh over the
[1:29:25] middle east man if the people rise up
[1:29:27] just a little bit that whoever's

[1:29:38] say but it's not the will of god to do
[1:29:39] it
[1:29:41] because he says they're in the hands of
[1:29:43] almighty god to destroy rome
[1:29:47] he says i this as i say this is god's
[1:29:49] prophet a russian empire will drop an
[1:29:52] atomic bomb of some sort on the vatican
[1:29:55] city and destroy it in one hour

[1:30:00] bible said that god took them cruel
[1:30:02] hearted men and put them in his hands
[1:30:06] and there were instruments in his hands
[1:30:08] to fulfill his
[1:30:10] will
[1:30:12] and to bring back to her exactly what
[1:30:14] she had coming to her

[1:30:22] judges her the kings of the earth and
[1:30:25] that have who have committed fornication
[1:30:27] and live deliciously with her shall
[1:30:29] bewail her and lament her when they
[1:30:31] shall see the smoke of her burning
[1:30:33] standing afar for fear of torment saying
[1:30:35] alas alas the great city babylon that
[1:30:38] mighty city for in one hour is thy
[1:30:41] judgment come
[1:30:42] and the merchants of the earth shall

[1:31:17] sheep horses chariots slaves souls of
[1:31:19] men the fruits that die so
[1:31:22] less than after are departed from thee i
[1:31:25] want to say this to everybody that has
[1:31:26] their heart and their minds on money and
[1:31:29] the lusts of money you remember if you
[1:31:31] lust after those things those things

[1:31:51] which were dainty and goodly are
[1:31:53] departed from thee and thou shalt find
[1:31:55] them no more at all the merchants
[1:31:57] and the merchants of these things which
[1:32:00] were made rich by her shall stand off
[1:32:02] for fear of her torment weeping and
[1:32:04] wailing
[1:32:05] and saying alas alas a great city that
[1:32:07] was clothed in fine linen purple and

[1:34:26] to end and ultimately it points back to
[1:34:28] this guy right this people right here

[1:34:33] over her
[1:34:35] thy heavens and you holy apostles and
[1:34:38] prophets for god hath avenged
[1:34:42] on her

[1:35:54] multiple times
[1:35:58] amen
[1:36:03] but rejoice
[1:36:05] rejoice over her
[1:36:07] because god has venged you
[1:36:10] with him and the mighty angel took up a
[1:36:13] stone like a millstone and cast it into
[1:36:15] the sea saying
[1:36:18] thus with violence shall that great city
[1:36:20] babylon be thrown down and shall be no

[1:36:33] craftsman
[1:36:35] and whatsoever craft tb
[1:36:38] shall be found any more in thee the
[1:36:40] sound of a millstone shall not be heard
[1:36:42] anymore at all in thee the light of a
[1:36:44] candle shall not even shine
[1:36:48] at all
[1:36:49] all the way down to a little candle and
[1:36:52] the voice of the bridegroom
[1:36:54] and the voice of the bride shall be
[1:36:55] heard no more at all in thee for thy
[1:36:57] merchants were the great men of the
[1:37:00] earth
[1:37:02] for by thy sorceries
[1:37:04] we're all nations
[1:37:06] deceived
