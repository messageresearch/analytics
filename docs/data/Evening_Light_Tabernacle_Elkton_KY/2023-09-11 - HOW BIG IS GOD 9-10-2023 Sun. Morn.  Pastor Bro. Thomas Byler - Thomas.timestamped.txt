[40:42] came into your heart and you know we've
[40:45] got a lot to be thankful for this
[40:46] morning and you know and
[40:49] we all go through troubles and trials
[40:51] and tests and you know I think of the
[40:53] different ones that are sick this
[40:54] morning sister Sherry battles constantly
[40:56] and sister Erica brother Donnie's
[40:59] daughter and sister Vicki Tidwell the
[41:01] different ones that but the jewel you
[41:03] know they're just in a constant battle
[41:04] but they're Ron and I thought Lord
[41:06] you know and then we take the little
[41:09] things for granted and the other day
[41:12] brother Josh come by and I was outside
[41:14] he tuned to Horn at me and
[41:17] and I I know he was waving but I
[41:19] couldn't see
[41:20] but I weighed and then just a few
[41:23] minutes later
[41:25] I got the message
[41:27] the enemy tried to get my brother
[41:31] but guess what
[41:33] there was somebody in there bigger than
[41:35] him bigger than me
[41:38] and the Bible says the angels in Camp
[41:41] around them that love the Lord I know
[41:44] that ain't exactly the way it is that's
[41:46] just my version because that's the best
[41:47] I can remember but I thought you know
[41:50] life is so precious
[41:54] and then I got to thinking I thought but
[41:55] God if you're with us it doesn't matter
[42:00] and you know brother Josh could just as
[42:03] easily this morning be shouting on the
[42:05] streets of Glory
[42:08] but you know what God wasn't done with
[42:09] him this morning
[42:11] and we're thankful for that this morning
[42:13] and you know when I pray in the morning
[42:15] and you know any of us that go out on
[42:18] the road I always ask the Lord to watch
[42:20] over us
[42:22] but I thank you brother John and I thank
[42:24] you brother Josh and brother Jeff
[42:27] they're in the log Woods that's that's
[42:29] dangerous I mean these crazy people are
[42:31] dangerous anyways
[42:33] but I thought Lord you know how many
[42:35] mornings I prayed would you watch over
[42:38] them because what they do is really
[42:40] dangerous
[42:41] you know and of course all of us we do
[42:43] things it's dangerous but I'm glad that
[42:46] God cares for us and this morning

[43:25] kept things from being worse God is good

[55:09] I'm gonna confess something this morning
[55:12] I'm not going to hold back anymore and
[55:14] I'll tell you the reason why
[55:17] I went to Arkansas last week to my
[55:19] daughters and
[55:21] and me and my son-in-law we went to
[55:23] Razorback football game
[55:25] and I watched them people there
[55:28] from the little bittiest that could
[55:31] barely learn how to talk
[55:33] you know what they taught them kids how
[55:35] to do
[55:37] to call the Hogs has anybody ever heard
[55:40] that how dumb that is
[55:42] there's 40 000 people there doing that
[55:45] and I was one of them
[55:47] and I thought Lord here we are
[55:50] a hog
[55:54] I've got to laugh and I kept on calling
[55:57] everybody was doing the same thing and I
[55:58] thought but you know what I thought we'd
[56:01] come to church
[56:02] and some of us can't even raise our hand
[56:04] and praise the King of King the Lord of
[56:07] lords for giving us the victory this
[56:09] morning
[56:09] and it began to prick my heart and I
[56:11] said Lord help me not to be reserved no
[56:13] more
[56:14] never again
[56:17] I said Lord you help me
[56:20] if we can get that happy over
[56:23] and they did win thank the Lord I'd
[56:25] always hate going and paying whenever
[56:27] they lose but but I thought Lord help us
[56:29] not not to hold back
[56:32] not to hold back no more
[56:34] the world's not ashamed why should we be
[56:37] ashamed we got the greatest thing in the
[56:39] world
[56:40] and you know in the world if you had the
[56:42] greatest thing
[56:44] and you know years ago
[56:46] this was nothing but what it isn't now
[56:49] every little bitty kid and every old
[56:50] person in the world has got one of these
[56:52] dumb things and years ago when I was a
[56:54] kid
[56:56] we shared a phone line and I know you
[56:58] kids probably think you're crazy but we
[57:00] did
[57:01] because everybody didn't have it you
[57:03] remember that sister Hannah in Arkansas
[57:04] everybody shared the same phone line out
[57:06] there where they lived at
[57:09] but now
[57:10] that's the greatest thing but the
[57:12] greatest thing is what God's done in our
[57:13] heart lives this morning I said Lord
[57:15] help me never again

[1:13:40] okay God bless you brother Joshua
[1:13:42] last year I just wonder
[1:13:45] um read a little scripture before I
[1:13:47] started if that was okay and
[1:13:50] um
[1:13:51] this is Leah's favorite chapter and
[1:13:53] oftentimes when I go to read the Bible
[1:13:55] she'll ask if we can read this and I'll
[1:13:56] be like again again but now it's kind of
[1:13:59] my favorite chapter two and all right
[1:14:01] Psalm 91 it says because
[1:14:05] Lord which is my refuge even the most
[1:14:08] high that I have for he shall give his
[1:14:10] angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[1:14:12] all thy ways
[1:14:14] that's just really close to my heart now
[1:14:17] um so on Thursday evening I was bringing
[1:14:20] in my last load for the day and
[1:14:23] um at one of the Mills right here on the
[1:14:26] road
[1:14:27] it's about five minutes from our house
[1:14:29] and they don't have a loader yet they
[1:14:30] use a bobcat to unload
[1:14:33] so I unloaded the bottom bunks and the
[1:14:36] top one was just eight Footers and they
[1:14:39] can slide if they get crooked between
[1:14:40] the standards and come off the trailer
[1:14:43] so I had done about three poles and I
[1:14:46] was getting
[1:14:48] my third one
[1:14:50] and one of the logs under my Forks
[1:14:53] turned sideways I didn't know it yet so
[1:14:55] when I raised up my
[1:14:57] um forks I just seen the log coming
[1:15:00] all right towards my window
[1:15:02] uh so I had like a split second and I
[1:15:05] just kind of pulled back on the left
[1:15:07] joist window and
[1:15:10] um I don't know maybe a 500 pound log or
[1:15:13] so
[1:15:14] and uh come right through the window and
[1:15:17] landed right in my lap and it kept
[1:15:20] coming towards me and then when the
[1:15:23] when the other half fell off the trailer
[1:15:25] then it bounced up and hit the ceiling
[1:15:28] of the bobcat and
[1:15:31] so I was kind of in shock I didn't know
[1:15:33] what happened but
[1:15:34] I seen a lot of blood and my pants were
[1:15:36] ripped and I was in a lot of pain so I
[1:15:39] threw up the bar and tried to get out of
[1:15:42] the cab and
[1:15:44] um
[1:15:48] huh I try to
[1:15:50] put pressure on my right leg and uh so I
[1:15:54] was just laying on my back there and I
[1:15:56] just
[1:15:57] um called out to the Lord and I just
[1:15:59] said Lord yes I will get your help right
[1:16:01] now I really need you and I just prayed
[1:16:03] out just please don't let my leg be
[1:16:05] broken
[1:16:07] and
[1:16:08] and uh
[1:16:10] um
[1:16:14] out there praying for us because I know
[1:16:16] she was at home
[1:16:18] so
[1:16:19] she got about
[1:16:21] five minutes and
[1:16:24] um one
[1:16:25] The Meta Knight boys came out and helped
[1:16:26] me to the back of the trailer and if I
[1:16:29] was sitting on the back of the trailer I
[1:16:31] didn't my I mean my right leg was in a
[1:16:33] lot of pain
[1:16:34] and I could feel there was some glass in
[1:16:36] there and stuff but I was still praying
[1:16:38] like Lord don't let my leg be broken and
[1:16:41] um yeah so Aaliyah came and she took me
[1:16:44] to the hospital and
[1:16:46] um they got me right in I don't think
[1:16:48] the wheelchair even stops he texted
[1:16:49] everybody we're coming in so we got
[1:16:52] right in and
[1:16:54] they sent me right into X-rays and gave
[1:16:56] me some morphine and stuff and um and uh
[1:16:59] so they got me riding the x-rays and got
[1:17:02] me into the bed and all x-rays came back
[1:17:05] negative there was no broke brakes no
[1:17:06] fractures just anything crazy I love the
[1:17:09] big bruise I didn't even have to get any
[1:17:11] stitches or anything like that they just
[1:17:13] took uh two pieces of glass out of my
[1:17:16] leg and that was about
[1:17:18] a bit and they bandaged me up and
[1:17:20] cleaned it up and sent me home and so
[1:17:23] just a really big bruise on my right leg
[1:17:25] but I can imagine that you know like the
[1:17:28] doctor was saying
[1:17:29] pretty much every
[1:17:31] uh situation other than the one you're
[1:17:33] in is worse when something like that
[1:17:35] happens you know if it could come
[1:17:36] towards your chest or could have come
[1:17:38] towards your face or something like that
[1:17:39] but I was just super thankful that
[1:17:42] um
[1:17:42] the Lord was there with me and yeah I
[1:17:45] wanted to read one more scripture
[1:17:47] um brother Byler preached on us
[1:17:49] and um well it just went Hallelujah God
[1:17:54] is still on the throne isn't he
[1:17:56] hey
[1:17:58] amen watch an operation
[1:18:00] children amen
[1:18:02] amen we're blessed people aren't we it's
[1:18:07] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[1:18:08] morning and amen of the lord I can't
[1:18:10] think of any other announcements I know
[1:18:12] that hey man it's just have some busy
[1:18:15] schedule here not real busy but Amen to
[1:18:18] schedule for September amen a couple
[1:18:21] weeks we'll have brother John Michael's
[1:18:23] uh wedding amen and sister Emma so we'll
[1:18:26] be going down there amen and things like
[1:18:29] that but anyway so if you would stand
[1:18:30] with me this morning we'll just get into
[1:18:32] the word of God
[1:18:33] and see what the Lord was this morning
[1:18:36] amen we uh
[1:18:39] want to speak on something I mean maybe
[1:18:41] just a little bit different or look at
[1:18:43] it a little bit different with the help
[1:18:44] of the Lord this morning
[1:18:46] amen and I want to have title this
[1:18:50] how big is God
[1:18:52] how big is God Amen
[1:18:55] praise the Lord
[1:18:57] so
[1:18:58] yeah and we know there's a song that I
[1:19:02] remember hearing by a couple of sisters
[1:19:04] I think when we was before I was married
[1:19:06] even uh some sisters came from Israel
[1:19:10] and they sang a song that was called how
[1:19:12] big is God I believe it was called God
[1:19:14] that anyway but amen and he they were
[1:19:17] singing it says he's higher than the
[1:19:18] mountain taller than the trees deeper
[1:19:21] than the ocean wider than the Seas he
[1:19:24] says that's how big God is amen and of
[1:19:27] course it harmonized and everything it
[1:19:28] was a real good song Amen and so we
[1:19:31] wanted to look at it when we know that
[1:19:32] Jesus said I come from God and I go back
[1:19:36] to God Amen so whatever God was amen and
[1:19:40] however God was before he come into the
[1:19:42] flesh amen he went back to be in that
[1:19:44] same God Amen and so we'll read some
[1:19:46] scriptures on it amen and to see what
[1:19:49] the Lord will have this morning and amen
[1:19:51] I'm I'm praying about and thinking about
[1:19:53] maybe uh at the end of the service maybe
[1:19:56] like maybe have like a
[1:19:58] a prayer line amen if the Lord wants it
[1:20:02] amen I just feel kind of going that
[1:20:04] direction amen and I pray God will come

[1:20:19] the Lord will have for us and I think
[1:20:21] we'll go uh back to the book of
[1:20:23] Ephesians if you will
[1:20:25] Ephesians will start here
[1:20:29] and look at Ephesians 3

[1:23:34] amen we're talking about this eternal
[1:23:37] world not this earworld but he's talking
[1:23:39] about Amen to another kind of world God
[1:23:41] bless you may God add His blessings to
[1:23:43] the reading in the word you can be
[1:23:45] seated this morning praise the Lord
[1:23:48] hallelujah
[1:23:52] how big is God Amen Hallelujah I'll tell
[1:23:57] you what when I begin to think about
[1:23:58] this I mean it reminds me of what
[1:24:00] brother Branham talked about when he was
[1:24:02] talking about the eagle the great mother
[1:24:04] Eagle when she's up there in the cleft
[1:24:06] of the rock raising her little youngins
[1:24:09] and then they almost get to the age to
[1:24:11] where they're getting ready to fly and
[1:24:14] he kind of demonstrated how that he
[1:24:16] would uh have that great Mama Eagle
[1:24:18] would come and he would just uh flutter
[1:24:20] us like I think he was Isaiah there it
[1:24:22] says that you know flutter over her
[1:24:23] young and so forth and she flaps those
[1:24:25] great wings and gets all the loose
[1:24:28] feathers out and lets them look at her
[1:24:30] and admire her and to see how great the
[1:24:33] the mama Eagle is amen that's what we
[1:24:37] want to do this morning amen amen I
[1:24:39] believe that it'll help our faith this
[1:24:41] is to increase our faith I mean beliefs
[1:24:43] that faith comes by
[1:24:46] hearing what the word of God that's
[1:24:49] right so as we hear the word of God it
[1:24:52] should amen it should uh you know I
[1:24:55] don't know what level of Faith each and
[1:24:56] every one of us come in here with but by
[1:24:58] the end of the service it should be
[1:24:59] built up it should be greater the more
[1:25:02] that we talk about God the more that we
[1:25:04] talk about his greatness amen amen and
[1:25:07] we make the statement he says we serve a
[1:25:09] great big God
[1:25:11] I mean you serve a great big God and we
[1:25:15] want to just with the help of the Lord
[1:25:17] for what's the and look at how great and
[1:25:20] how big God really is now one thing I've
[1:25:24] learned and I've looked it up and then
[1:25:26] but a man goes to saying what talking
[1:25:27] about when you try to figure God out he
[1:25:30] says don't ever try to figure God out
[1:25:32] you can look at that up if you want to
[1:25:34] he says because you can't figure God out
[1:25:37] amen he says you have to just believe
[1:25:39] God take him at his word and that uh you
[1:25:43] contact God Amen and so you can't never
[1:25:46] figure it out because I stop
[1:25:49] Finance Minds
[1:25:53] amen aren't able
[1:25:55] to comprehend he is haven't you heard
[1:25:58] never the phrase that he is incompetent
[1:26:01] and so you know there's a lot of things
[1:26:03] like we know that Jesus Christ ascended
[1:26:05] up on high and amen and he went above uh
[1:26:08] up into the heavens and so forth and I
[1:26:09] want to read that scripture but you know
[1:26:11] on his body and how that it was changed
[1:26:13] and how he could walk through walls and
[1:26:15] amen and then he Ascend it but then when
[1:26:18] G Paul saw him he saw him as
[1:26:21] a pill or a fire isn't that right then
[1:26:24] you beg the question sometimes well
[1:26:25] where is the physical body of the Lord
[1:26:28] Jesus Christ
[1:26:29] amen and so we know it's somewhere isn't
[1:26:32] that right and we know that the spirit
[1:26:34] of Christ is Spirit purifier is now in
[1:26:37] his church isn't that right that he's
[1:26:39] here this morning Christ is not just
[1:26:42] should I say he's not just somewhere
[1:26:44] else
[1:26:45] but he's also here in every real genuine
[1:26:49] believer
[1:26:51] amen he is with us I'll be with you even
[1:26:55] in you the end of the world
[1:26:57] so don't we know that God lives in the
[1:27:00] human heart
[1:27:01] amen praise the Lord another scripture
[1:27:03] in uh Ephesians and chapter 4 and verse
[1:27:07] 8. now notice wherefore he saith he
[1:27:11] saith
[1:27:13] when he ascended up on high he let
[1:27:16] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:27:20] men now that he ascended what is this
[1:27:22] what is it but he also descended first
[1:27:25] into the lower parts of the Earth
[1:27:27] he that descended is also the same is uh
[1:27:31] the same also that ascended far above
[1:27:36] the heavens amen now how many knows we
[1:27:40] know that
[1:27:42] yeah there's you know Paul talked about
[1:27:45] the seventh heaven and third and fourth
[1:27:46] heaven and so forth amen so we there's a
[1:27:48] lot we don't understand about what do
[1:27:50] you mean by different different Heavens
[1:27:51] well we know that the prophet of God
[1:27:53] taught us that uh there's seven
[1:27:55] different dimensions these verse three
[1:27:56] is light matter in space I believe it is
[1:27:59] right and that's the world that you live
[1:28:01] in life matter or time matter in space
[1:28:05] amen now thinking about that going down
[1:28:07] the road you know and I was thinking
[1:28:09] about here we're going through space and
[1:28:11] it's just a matter of time before I
[1:28:13] drive wherever I get to I just have to
[1:28:15] wait now I've got to go through that
[1:28:17] time and space and matter and so forth
[1:28:19] that's the world that you and I are
[1:28:21] living in then he said the fourth
[1:28:22] dimension of course amen is radio and
[1:28:25] television and so forth and he even said
[1:28:27] you know that cancer was a fourth
[1:28:29] dimensional disease isn't that right and
[1:28:31] then the fifth imagine we know how many
[1:28:33] knows where the fifth what The Fifth
[1:28:34] Dimension is
[1:28:38] regions of the Lost isn't that right he
[1:28:41] said The Fifth Dimension is the region
[1:28:42] of the laws where you know they can't
[1:28:44] come back here and they can't go to
[1:28:46] heaven so forth amen it's a dimension of
[1:28:48] the regions of the lost and then he said
[1:28:50] the sixth Dimension is what
[1:28:53] come on class
[1:28:56] it's where where the Brandon went
[1:28:58] transported he's one of the Believers
[1:29:00] where the Saints are now right that's
[1:29:02] sixth Dimension and then the seven now
[1:29:04] notice brother bam says he was in that
[1:29:06] Dimension and he says now I want to see
[1:29:08] him
[1:29:10] so wherever Christ was he was you know
[1:29:13] because we say when you die you go to
[1:29:14] heaven so that sixth Dimension that's
[1:29:16] Heaven that's the presence in the
[1:29:18] presence of God Amen but it's still
[1:29:21] another Heaven higher there's still
[1:29:23] another place higher than that amen
[1:29:25] because they said he's even higher than
[1:29:27] this
[1:29:29] so he's way out there folks amen and you
[1:29:33] can't go that nobody can go there
[1:29:35] amen there's a lot of things we don't
[1:29:37] understand just like the devil you know
[1:29:39] in the revelations you know that it
[1:29:41] talks about the devil is going to be
[1:29:43] cast out of Heaven he's going to come
[1:29:44] down to you and and you know we know the
[1:29:46] devil's right here there's a lot of
[1:29:48] things we don't know exactly isn't that
[1:29:49] right we know there's certain devil
[1:29:51] around but does he have a righteous as
[1:29:53] in a court of law he has a right to go
[1:29:55] to the attorney because he's the
[1:29:57] prosecuting attorney or the defense
[1:29:59] attorney and so forth he has the right
[1:30:01] to go there and have no before they
[1:30:03] throw in the Dawn and accuse you
[1:30:05] remember one day he's gonna be thrown
[1:30:08] out he won't go on that'll be over with
[1:30:10] amen there's so much when you realize we
[1:30:13] realized we really don't know our scope
[1:30:16] our minds can't comprehend it even
[1:30:18] brother Ben remember when he went over
[1:30:19] there he says there's no words I can't
[1:30:21] really count the ABCs really don't
[1:30:24] express to you how great that sixth
[1:30:27] Dimension is or the reasons to say I
[1:30:30] can't really tell it's Sublime
[1:30:33] Perfection isn't really the word
[1:30:39] it's not good enough it's it's greater
[1:30:42] than what you can imagine all he did
[1:30:44] when he did could come back he says just
[1:30:46] whatever you do don't miss it
[1:30:50] amen I like what the Bible says you know
[1:30:52] the most important thing in the world is
[1:30:54] your relationship with Jesus Christ and
[1:30:56] you really can't say that enough because
[1:30:58] everything you did this week it's all
[1:31:00] vanity it really don't matter beans what
[1:31:03] you're doing right now is the most
[1:31:04] important thing that we've done all week
[1:31:08] whenever we come together and we worship
[1:31:11] God in the spirit of the new truth ain't
[1:31:13] nothing more important when we come and
[1:31:15] we feed on the word that God ain't
[1:31:18] nothing more important
[1:31:20] than the feet on the word of God
[1:31:22] can they tell it to me again oh my
[1:31:24] you've heard it all before I don't care
[1:31:26] I want to hear it again
[1:31:30] oh it's getting so bored I don't have
[1:31:33] any new things to say this on the other
[1:31:34] I'm gonna tell you right now then tell
[1:31:36] me again about Grace one more time
[1:31:38] because when I've been there ten
[1:31:39] thousand years and then I'll still want
[1:31:41] you to tell me I'm saying to me the song
[1:31:44] of Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound
[1:31:46] it'll never get old to me
[1:31:51] all right
[1:31:53] praise be to God
[1:31:55] amen
[1:31:57] done notice you went into the heavens of
[1:32:00] heavens above all Heavens he went into
[1:32:02] the highest Heaven that there is
[1:32:06] that's where he is way up there
[1:32:08] somewhere
[1:32:09] if you notice over Revelations 1
[1:32:12] amen
[1:32:13] he says you know
[1:32:15] uh in verse 8 he says I am the alpha I
[1:32:19] am the
[1:32:21] Omega
[1:32:22] how many knows you can find that in
[1:32:24] Isaiah where he calls him the first and
[1:32:26] the last here he finds again he's again
[1:32:28] he's the first he's the last he's the
[1:32:32] beginning and he's the ending
[1:32:36] saith the Lord which is which was and
[1:32:39] which is to come
[1:32:43] be Almighty
[1:32:46] God before there was even an atom in the
[1:32:50] air before there was anything there was
[1:32:54] nothing but God everywhere
[1:32:56] [Applause]
[1:32:58] and he filled all space and
[1:33:03] all times
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:06] try to pack that in your little brain
[1:33:08] will you
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:12] that's how big he is
[1:33:14] he I am he which was which is which is
[1:33:19] to come he fills all space
[1:33:29] out there and to infinity and beyond so
[1:33:32] that big
[1:33:40] he's out there
[1:33:50] all space
[1:33:53] that's big you're gonna realize he's
[1:33:56] much bigger than any of your little
[1:33:57] problems
[1:33:59] foreign
[1:34:10] the Bible says he is all and he is in
[1:34:13] all
[1:34:17] these are all in all he's all and easy
[1:34:19] now
[1:34:21] and he's in his church and you and I
[1:34:24] amen
[1:34:26] see some people think well if he's up
[1:34:28] there in his body he can't be down here
[1:34:29] don't don't talk
[1:34:31] talk to me about God limiting God don't
[1:34:33] try to put God in a box
[1:34:37] huh amen
[1:34:41] oh my
[1:34:43] now
[1:34:45] but begin to read uh scripture and I had
[1:34:48] to go back and look at where it was the
[1:34:49] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:34:51] gave to him I thought maybe that was in
[1:34:54] Genesis or not Genesis but if Ephesians
[1:34:57] but I found it in Revelations 1 the
[1:34:58] first chapter the revelation of Jesus
[1:35:00] Christ which God gave to him
[1:35:02] amen now he says oh I love that don't
[1:35:06] you Revelation what is revelation it's
[1:35:08] something he said the revelation of
[1:35:11] Jesus Christ that's what the Bible is
[1:35:14] the Bible is revealed Jesus Christ
[1:35:18] now Omar he says
[1:35:21] I get back there and I get to get
[1:35:24] religious right away or feeling that way
[1:35:26] see Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers
[1:35:31] Deuteronomy Joshua all of them even the
[1:35:35] Army job Ruth all of them is a
[1:35:38] revelation of Jesus Christ that he and
[1:35:41] him might dwell that covers
[1:35:44] all space and all time
[1:35:47] amen
[1:35:49] and all that
[1:35:52] eternity holds is Jesus Christ
[1:35:57] amen and all these little things here is
[1:36:01] just seeds for that great remeeding day
[1:36:05] when the human race will be introduced
[1:36:07] to the resurrection to Jesus Christ so
[1:36:11] we're sitting here this morning and
[1:36:13] these are just little things these are
[1:36:15] seeds that's taking us to meet him in
[1:36:20] person how many is that for that
[1:36:22] but he fills all space all that eternity
[1:36:24] holds he said he covers it all all of
[1:36:27] them revive this entire Bible it's the
[1:36:30] Revelation showing us who God is what he
[1:36:32] is
[1:36:33] oh
[1:36:35] that is full of love that he's full look
[1:36:37] compassion
[1:36:40] amen
[1:36:42] mom
[1:36:45] my my thought I would say that's quite a
[1:36:48] big God wouldn't you
[1:36:52] he's a big God
[1:36:57] Isaiah
[1:36:59] 40 God puts it this way
[1:37:03] have you not know
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:10] we're hearing it this morning right
[1:37:12] from the beginning
[1:37:14] Hallelujah have you not understood from
[1:37:17] the foundations of the Earth
[1:37:19] that it is he that setth upon the circle
[1:37:23] of the Earth
[1:37:26] and all the inhabitants thereof are as
[1:37:30] grasshopper
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:34] oh my how many of those God is out there
[1:37:37] looking down
[1:37:40] oh my when you think about it
[1:37:44] now listen that's true
[1:37:47] that just out the heavens as a curtain
[1:37:50] and spread at them out
[1:37:53] as they tend
[1:37:56] they can't my he spread up the whole
[1:38:00] thing
[1:38:01] and it's just a tent to him my goodness
[1:38:04] I don't know about you but I like a
[1:38:05] house don't you brother Brad
[1:38:06] just a little tent enough to get you bad
[1:38:09] in this out of the other just a tent
[1:38:11] for God to dwell in
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:20] how big is god well let's just see what
[1:38:22] the Bible says
[1:38:24] 66-1 he says thus saith the Lord
[1:38:28] the heaven is my throne
[1:38:31] Earth is my footstool
[1:38:37] and he feels all of Heaven he puts his
[1:38:40] feet on the Earth
[1:38:42] that's what the footstool is
[1:38:44] that's how God is
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:49] wow the Earth Is His footstool then
[1:38:51] brother Bannon when he preached uh what
[1:38:53] was it
[1:38:55] statue of a perfect man I believe he
[1:38:57] talked about he says he took that
[1:38:59] scripture and he also took the
[1:39:02] scriptures where but a body has now
[1:39:04] perverted
[1:39:06] the place of my dwelling but a body has
[1:39:08] thou prepared me and of course he ties
[1:39:10] that to us to you and I that it's in you
[1:39:14] deny that he dwells
[1:39:18] amen
[1:39:20] but we think well that's all there is no
[1:39:22] he feels all time and space he's he's a
[1:39:25] great big God folks build fun to me how
[1:39:28] many knows he
[1:39:29] he even said that the Solomon I believe
[1:39:31] it was Stephen that was preaching to uh
[1:39:33] the Pharisees and so forth when he was
[1:39:35] preaching about Salem wanted to build
[1:39:37] him a house but God said twice what
[1:39:39] house are you gonna build me things that
[1:39:41] I created Heavens the fourth Heavens is
[1:39:43] my uh my
[1:39:46] Heaven since my Throne Earth is my foot
[1:39:48] Paul and David I'm going to build your
[1:39:51] house he says what are you gonna build
[1:39:53] me what's going to fit me in it
[1:39:58] friends
[1:39:59] what am I gonna fit in that well I hear
[1:40:02] that's what I hear
[1:40:03] but how's he going to build me when
[1:40:04] Heavens is my throne and Earth is my
[1:40:06] footstool
[1:40:10] amen
[1:40:11] Hallelujah
[1:40:13] we have a great big God
[1:40:16] amen
[1:40:19] and how many of those let me let me just
[1:40:21] let me finish this and then we'll go to
[1:40:23] the next part
[1:40:29] I think about it I mean this God didn't
[1:40:32] want to dwell alone
[1:40:43] so right answer not you me
[1:40:46] he wanted to live with you and me
[1:40:50] and he does
[1:40:52] come on
[1:40:54] is he living with you or not is it the
[1:40:58] place that he's happy the place that
[1:40:59] he's resting is in your heart
[1:41:02] praise the place of my arrest why do we
[1:41:04] really find that season something no
[1:41:06] it's in Christ
[1:41:08] amen
[1:41:09] oh we're a privileged people folks
[1:41:14] amen let me just say this while it comes
[1:41:16] to mind
[1:41:17] God is such a great great God
[1:41:22] that he can make himself so little
[1:41:25] that if you and I
[1:41:28] aren't careful and most of humanity this
[1:41:32] goes right over the top of him
[1:41:34] he hides himself from the wall
[1:41:37] rise in the prudent
[1:41:41] you know isn't it something how that
[1:41:43] some of us maybe have an IQ of smart
[1:41:45] whippersnapper
[1:41:50] you are one smart they're smart people
[1:41:52] I'd hate to have to have somebody take
[1:41:54] you
[1:41:55] know
[1:41:57] test my IQ amen
[1:42:02] amen like
[1:42:05] what word can you add two letters to and
[1:42:08] make it shorter
[1:42:13] anyway we won't go there ER it's stored
[1:42:16] short
[1:42:17] short add two letters to a short in the
[1:42:20] ER
[1:42:21] he got shorter that it's a simple one
[1:42:25] but it's kind of an IQ test see if you
[1:42:28] can catch that or not
[1:42:30] I don't know about you but I'd probably
[1:42:32] missing a million miles off
[1:42:34] and about my accused but if when you
[1:42:36] think about the intelligence think about
[1:42:37] how many knows now because they've got
[1:42:40] it omniscient
[1:42:43] omniscient
[1:42:45] what is that all-knowing all knowledge
[1:42:50] he is oh my you you can't there is no
[1:42:54] skill
[1:42:56] for his to test his IQ
[1:43:00] for each little finite Minds have a
[1:43:02] hundred hundred wow no think about God
[1:43:04] and how smart he is
[1:43:07] that's why

[1:45:23] place of my rest
[1:45:27] for all those things have mine handmade
[1:45:32] and all those things have been saith the
[1:45:34] Lord but isn't it something I'll just go
[1:45:37] off the subject for a little but the
[1:45:38] this man will I look wow
[1:45:43] all these things I'm not looking to that
[1:45:45] this is what I'm looking at
[1:45:47] but to this man will I look even to him
[1:45:49] that is of a poor and of a contrite
[1:45:51] spirit and trembleth at my word
[1:45:55] how many beliefs we ought to have a real
[1:45:57] respect for God's word if you want to
[1:46:01] catch God's attention have respect
[1:46:04] tremble at his word
[1:46:08] God said it God said it oh I don't want
[1:46:11] to go across that Lord help me to
[1:46:12] believe it let me accept it Lord I'm
[1:46:15] traveling God don't let me ever not
[1:46:17] believe it huh trembleth at my word
[1:46:22] back to Isaiah 40 he says
[1:46:28] and we'll begin with verse 15 behold the
[1:46:32] nations are as a drop of a bucket and
[1:46:35] are counted as a small dust of the
[1:46:37] balance behold he taketh up the owls as
[1:46:40] a very little thing verse 17 All Nations
[1:46:43] before him are as nothing
[1:46:46] wow they are counted unto him less than
[1:46:51] nothing and vanity
[1:46:54] oh think about the great Empire of Romer
[1:46:58] Greece or uh uh Nebuchadnezzar and that
[1:47:02] great Empire and or America how
[1:47:04] superpowering Russia
[1:47:07] oh Russia huh
[1:47:10] isn't that somehow Russia can't even
[1:47:12] take if he's a little Nation beside it
[1:47:14] that didn't even have a military army
[1:47:18] don't shoot at me but that's the truth
[1:47:21] how many knows they've been trying to
[1:47:22] defeat him for all these years and we
[1:47:24] had a dad to borrow the weapons hey can
[1:47:26] y'all give us some more weapons we're
[1:47:27] fighting Russia why you'd have thought
[1:47:30] Russ should take somebody down in no
[1:47:31] time
[1:47:33] but how many knows what they do have
[1:47:36] which is nuclear
[1:47:38] there's still nothing to be messed with
[1:47:39] but as far as their domestic Army is not
[1:47:42] the whole lot from what I've seen
[1:47:44] but they're nothing America all this
[1:47:47] greatness all of this he said Bob says
[1:47:49] they just they don't amount to a hill of
[1:47:51] beans that's why he says you know we are
[1:47:53] the value
[1:47:55] what is the most valuable thing
[1:47:57] is Christ anything outside of Christ we
[1:48:00] feel about it the way that God feels
[1:48:02] about it if the Nations it don't mean
[1:48:04] much to God there's only one thing that
[1:48:06] amounts to anything and that's Christ
[1:48:09] even Jesus said without me you can't do
[1:48:13] nothing
[1:48:14] you're nothing without Christ
[1:48:17] [Music]
[1:48:19] ain't nobody not
[1:48:21] nothing without Christ
[1:48:23] and he says they're even less than
[1:48:26] nothing
[1:48:27] less than nothing how in the world I
[1:48:29] don't know how to explain it other than
[1:48:30] you know if you didn't have any bills
[1:48:32] and nobody nobody had anything and you
[1:48:35] might not have a thing you might be
[1:48:37] nothing but it's less than that because
[1:48:38] you owe all kinds of that
[1:48:40] you're deep in that you're less than
[1:48:43] nothing
[1:48:44] I ordered that I could not pay people's
[1:48:46] gonna have to pay for their sin they're
[1:48:49] gonna have to pay for their own belief
[1:48:50] people will take me taking the judgment
[1:48:52] and have to give account for it
[1:48:55] even Jesus said about Judas he doesn't
[1:48:57] have been better if he would have never
[1:48:58] been born
[1:49:00] I'll come here to tell you you don't
[1:49:02] know God it'd have been better for you
[1:49:03] never would have been born
[1:49:06] less than nothing
[1:49:10] because all Christians realize that the
[1:49:12] world is good all of our world the
[1:49:13] things it don't mean nothing it is not
[1:49:16] thing
[1:49:18] it is our relationship with God's
[1:49:21] Liberties right
[1:49:23] because the nations in the world it's
[1:49:25] just a small thing to God
[1:49:27] it ain't no big deal
[1:49:31] this little life that we live for 60 70
[1:49:34] years it ain't nothing
[1:49:36] the only thing that means anything is
[1:49:38] when he gives you eternal life
[1:49:41] when he fills you with the Holy Ghost
[1:49:43] and you know you're a son and daughter
[1:49:44] of God
[1:49:46] oh my let me tell you something friends
[1:49:48] we ought to we got to realize that we as
[1:49:50] Christians we who are living in the Asia
[1:49:52] we're living in we have so much all the
[1:49:55] Christians down to the Dark Ages they
[1:49:56] didn't they didn't have they didn't have
[1:49:58] the things that you and I did
[1:50:02] not for their release
[1:50:05] team we still can't worship God we still
[1:50:07] can't give God the glory and honor
[1:50:09] that's due to his name
[1:50:13] folks
[1:50:14] folks it's time
[1:50:18] it's time to come here to tell you we
[1:50:20] just get back and a little silly for God
[1:50:22] Amen you just have to forgive me
[1:50:25] but I don't mind asking stupid for God
[1:50:28] he's the only one that's worth
[1:50:30] distracting stupid boy what some people
[1:50:33] call stupid God calls glorious
[1:50:38] and screaming and shouting and praising
[1:50:40] God
[1:50:41] he is great the Bible says that he is
[1:50:43] great and he is to be greatly praised
[1:50:46] [Music]

[1:52:17] I'm glad that I don't have to satisfy
[1:52:19] I'm satisfied with just to cut it below
[1:52:21] a little something like oh why because I
[1:52:24] have him and I'm content

[1:53:00] oh what a picture as the True Vine here
[1:53:03] we are the branches and he is divine
[1:53:06] just as Divine moves so does the
[1:53:08] Branch's roof is that right
[1:53:11] how beautiful then
[1:53:13] of his great body oh his great bleeding
[1:53:16] arms and dropping tears and his bleeding
[1:53:20] sides his Strike Back
[1:53:23] a hanging over the Earth like this
[1:53:28] between God the Father And The Mortals
[1:53:32] of this Earth
[1:53:34] did you get the picture I'm getting he's
[1:53:36] hanging over the Earth
[1:53:38] bleeding thighs
[1:53:42] remember the vision brother said
[1:53:44] that blood that is covered the Earth
[1:53:47] keep keeping the bumper keeping from
[1:53:49] coming to the father every time you make
[1:53:51] mistakes you'd be guilty worthy of death
[1:53:53] but it comes and works as a buffer here
[1:53:55] he paints a picture of his body hanging
[1:53:58] over the Earth there
[1:53:59] amen like between God and so forth the
[1:54:02] pleading and loving them
[1:54:05] as his body comes into motion and power
[1:54:08] is given into the church just as he says
[1:54:11] if I move my hands this way his literal
[1:54:14] body moves go here preach the gospel
[1:54:17] you'll see that church move right
[1:54:19] straight because why my shadow has to
[1:54:22] move with my hands
[1:54:24] how many believe that's what we like to
[1:54:25] see in a church amen we don't want to
[1:54:27] see the CH start moving up brother Byler
[1:54:30] we don't want to see you are moving we
[1:54:32] want to see them moving of the Holy
[1:54:34] Ghost
[1:54:35] he just moves his hand and the body
[1:54:38] follows wherever that shadow is we're
[1:54:40] like the shadow I mean whatever God says
[1:54:42] do folks I'm here to tell you my Prime
[1:54:46] my brain and my head is so attached to
[1:54:48] my head
[1:54:49] we think it says I'm from my body to do
[1:54:52] my body does it perfectly
[1:54:55] why we agree with God like that I'm
[1:54:57] telling you about we be a different
[1:54:58] people every move that he says to make
[1:55:00] make it my body obeys it perfectly
[1:55:04] move up arms move cross arms
[1:55:09] lift your leg up put it down
[1:55:13] when God gets a chance like that folks
[1:55:16] we'll be ready to leave this place
[1:55:30] amen
[1:55:32] Hallelujah
[1:55:33] [Music]
[1:55:34] that's right oh my just think of that
[1:55:36] his body moving going you into all the
[1:55:38] world demonstrate the power
[1:55:41] no matter about our Theology and
[1:55:43] teachings and so forth we bitterly fail
[1:55:45] because we go by theology instead of the
[1:55:48] anointing of the spirit isn't that right
[1:55:50] but now the hand of God is moving
[1:55:53] signs and what wonders are appearing
[1:55:57] is that exactly right he moved Malachi
[1:56:00] for on the scene of his hand going all
[1:56:03] over the wall
[1:56:08] hey man how many middle Seas had seen
[1:56:11] the move of God In Our Generation
[1:56:13] through Malachi 4.
[1:56:16] it's crazy isn't it how can people be so
[1:56:19] blind
[1:56:21] not believe God in what he does
[1:56:24] amen

[1:56:58] the devil

[1:57:02] no comparison to God
[1:57:05] all right
[1:57:06] God always wins when he does something
[1:57:10] the devil always loses
[1:57:13] he can't create nothing he has to be
[1:57:16] manipulate pervert whatever he does God

[1:58:15] dwelling place for him he'd made my lips
[1:58:18] to praise him he made my mind to think

[1:59:23] where does it go from that then he says
[1:59:25] he goes back to gases
[1:59:27] and then from there

[2:07:06] in man and in beast and in the dust of
[2:07:09] the land became life throughout all the

[2:28:10] I said closing but I really want to I
[2:28:13] want to talk about
[2:28:14] the touch of Jesus when he was here
[2:28:16] because most of the time if you talk
[2:28:18] about touching or touch
[2:28:21] every time Jesus did anything he was
[2:28:23] always almost always talk about and he
[2:28:25] touched them
[2:28:27] he touched him
[2:28:28] he just touched him
[2:28:31] in Matthew 8 and verse 1 and when there
[2:28:33] came down from the mountain great
[2:28:34] multitudes followed him and behold
[2:28:38] there came a leper and worshiped him
[2:28:40] saying Lord if thou will thou can'tst
[2:28:42] make me clean
[2:28:44] wow
[2:28:46] I think another didn't one is as if thou
[2:28:48] Wilt make me cold or whatever this guy's
[2:28:51] saying you know if thou will thou can't
[2:28:53] make me clean in other words I know that
[2:28:55] you can if you want to
[2:28:57] am I reading this right
[2:29:00] if thou wilt thou can'tst make me clean
[2:29:03] and Jesus put forth his hand and touched
[2:29:06] him saying I will
[2:29:09] be thou clean and immediately his
[2:29:13] leprosy was cleansed
[2:29:16] over in chapter verse 14 of the same
[2:29:18] chapter and when Jesus came was come
[2:29:21] into Peter's house he saw his wife's
[2:29:23] mother laid sick of a fever and he
[2:29:26] touched her
[2:29:28] and the fever left and she arose and
[2:29:31] ministered unto them
[2:29:33] when even was come they brought unto him
[2:29:35] many that were possessed with devils and
[2:29:40] he cast them cast out the spirits with
[2:29:42] his word and healed
[2:29:45] all that were sick
[2:29:49] how many remembers we have one instance
[2:29:52] where the woman which had a blood issue
[2:29:56] went through the Press through the crowd
[2:29:58] and touched the Hem of His Garment
[2:30:01] and was made whole
[2:30:02] remember it's either Jesus touching you
[2:30:06] that heals you
[2:30:07] are you touching Jesus
[2:30:10] oh touching Jesus is all that really
[2:30:14] matters
[2:30:15] oh he touched me oh he touched me and oh
[2:30:21] the joy that floods my soul see he
[2:30:24] touches you or you touch him here's a
[2:30:27] here's a case and I didn't really
[2:30:28] realize it but another place he says and
[2:30:31] when they were gone over they came into
[2:30:33] the land of the God can necessaret and
[2:30:36] when the men of that place had knowledge
[2:30:39] of him they sent out all and into all
[2:30:43] the country round about and brought unto
[2:30:46] him all that were diseased
[2:30:49] and besought him that they might only
[2:30:53] touch
[2:30:55] the Hem of His Garment
[2:30:57] and as many as touched were made
[2:31:00] perfectly
[2:31:01] whole
[2:31:03] amen how many believes it's important
[2:31:07] to be touched by the master
[2:31:10] I mean they'll come this morning think
[2:31:12] about it
