[2:23] heavenly father
[2:25] lord as we once again meet in this
[2:27] midweek service father
[2:28] lord thankful once again to be able to
[2:30] lay aside all of our work and all the
[2:32] cares of life and lord and to be able to

[2:35] in your house coming together lord

[2:44] father we just want to thank you for all
[2:45] of your blessings upon us lord we can't
[2:47] even begin to mention them all
[2:50] or they even think of them all father
[2:51] but we just want you to know that we
[2:52] appreciate each and every one of them
[2:54] lord
[2:55] father we ask god that you just bless
[2:57] meditation of our heart
[2:58] father what you feel what we feel you
[3:00] flee upon our hearts to minister tonight
[3:03] may you have your way into service
[3:05] tonight in jesus name
[3:07] amen and amen amen
[3:11] turn your bibles if you will the psalms
[3:14] the book of psalms
[3:27] i was just meditating on the lord this
[3:29] week and just seeing what the lord
[3:31] perhaps
[3:33] would have for tonight and this thought
[3:36] came on my heart
[3:38] and i got to thinking about
[3:42] how blessed we are to be christians amen
[3:46] just to be a christian how blessed that
[3:48] is
[3:49] i believe i just thought of it back
[3:51] there as saint john three
[3:54] or first first or second john i think
[3:56] it's the third chapter
[3:57] somewhere in there first verse it talks
[4:00] about behold what manner of love
[4:02] the father has bestowed upon us that we
[4:04] should be called the sons of god
[4:07] in other words i like that behold it
[4:09] said look at
[4:11] just think about what a blessing it is
[4:14] to be able to be called
[4:15] the son of god and he believes that's
[4:17] such an honor
[4:19] there's no greater privilege that god
[4:20] could privilege us with
[4:22] and that is to be one of his children
[4:25] and i got to thinking about the benefits
[4:27] the benefits what goes with it
[4:30] what goes with being a christian what
[4:32] goes with being a child of god
[4:34] what goes with being saved and i thought
[4:36] about this
[4:37] scripture here and this is a psalm a
[4:40] scripture brother ram as i begin to
[4:42] study
[4:43] i found that brother branham used his
[4:44] scripture many many times
[4:46] as his theme scripture
[4:50] amen for preaching several different
[4:52] kinds of messages
[4:54] and i could see why uh and we'll get to
[4:57] that
[4:57] in just a little bit because it talks
[4:59] about uh
[5:01] who forgives all like iniquities and
[5:03] heal of all life diseases and so i think
[5:05] it was based because of his healing
[5:07] services that he had so in psalms 103
[5:10] let's read
[5:12] bless the lord
[5:15] o my soul i guess i didn't tell you the
[5:19] scripture
[5:20] psalms 103 all right
[5:25] bless the lord o my soul and all that
[5:28] is within me bless his holy name
[5:33] bless the lord o my soul
[5:38] and forget to get not all his benefits
[5:43] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[5:46] leadeth healeth
[5:47] all thy diseases that's where brother
[5:50] branham
[5:51] usually stop and i'd like to read a
[5:53] couple more scriptures
[5:55] who redeemeth the life from destruction
[5:59] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[6:02] and tender mercies
[6:04] who satisfieth thy mouth with good
[6:06] things
[6:07] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[6:09] eagles may god that is blessing
[6:12] i mean a couple statements of what he
[6:13] made about being a christian
[6:15] he says so we're just living in that day
[6:17] and happy
[6:18] to be a christian amen how many is happy
[6:21] to be a christian
[6:23] you know that's one thing i want to say
[6:24] and that you know uh
[6:26] i truly believe that being a christian i
[6:28] i was looking it up because different
[6:30] places program talked about
[6:31] it he did not
[6:34] believe that a crown
[6:38] never right not a christian there's an
[6:41] aura about a christian
[6:43] amen of joy and of peace
[6:46] amen amen and so he says happy to be a
[6:50] christian oh my
[6:51] what could i do if i believe he says
[6:54] i believe that i would go wild
[6:58] if i wasn't a christian looking at the
[7:01] thing
[7:02] i don't see how people can stand it
[7:05] i just don't understand how a man can
[7:09] walk on earth today
[7:10] without being a christian
[7:14] amen praise the lord how many is glad
[7:18] to be a christian amen it's the greatest
[7:21] privilege that you have is to be a
[7:23] christian
[7:24] amen and tonight we want to forgot to
[7:27] talk about forget not
[7:29] all of his benefits don't forget
[7:33] all the things that comes with being a
[7:35] christian
[7:36] amen and so i wish anybody
[7:39] would give me a reason some reason why
[7:42] not to serve christ
[7:44] amen give me a sensible reason
[7:47] amen this is the day that we all
[7:51] ought to be happy and ready the great
[7:54] homecoming time is at hand
[7:59] amen
[8:04] but is wrote on
[8:07] every this is the same quote is wrote on
[8:10] every nation
[8:13] every wall everywhere every democracy
[8:18] every kingdom everything else is falling
[8:22] now our weight in the balance and found
[8:25] when
[8:26] wanting amen all right
[8:29] he says kings have failed dictators have
[8:32] failed
[8:33] democracies failed churches have failed
[8:36] human beings has failed everything
[8:40] has failed you say churches yes sir
[8:44] amen so if you're the christian in the
[8:48] midst of all that
[8:49] you ought to be thankful amen praise the
[8:51] lord so are we going to be on the air
[8:53] tonight micah
[8:55] yeah okay so god bless each and every
[8:57] one watching
[8:59] and tuning in tonight may god be with
[9:00] you amen bless you and i trust that
[9:02] it'll be good for you too amen and that
[9:04] you'll get something out of it and you
[9:06] may have to move the camera around a
[9:08] little bit micah tonight because i'm
[9:09] gonna be moving around
[9:10] here a little bit so praise the lord
[9:12] amen we're glad for
[9:13] being able to be on air i know it's a
[9:16] little skip
[9:17] skip skippy but uh hopefully he'll be
[9:20] able to make sense of it i know it's a
[9:22] little dirky out there but
[9:23] i guess our internet is just not quite
[9:25] fast enough so we'll just continue to
[9:27] work on and see what we can do
[9:29] again brother bam says you know so i'm
[9:32] so glad
[9:33] that we have a shelter the name of the
[9:35] lord is
[9:36] a mighty power the righteous run
[9:39] into it and they're safe no matter how
[9:43] many bombs or how many anything else
[9:45] we're safe there i'm just glad for
[9:49] feeling like
[9:50] you're safe amen
[9:55] so the world and the center not having
[9:57] this shelter or this safety place
[10:00] it's a shaking time he says i again i
[10:03] believe if i was
[10:04] in the christian i'd go crazy
[10:07] of thinking of what might happen anytime
[10:11] he cares for you 1960 he says oh let me
[10:14] persuade you
[10:15] in christ's name you precious people
[10:17] here put
[10:18] all your hopes on him
[10:22] for he's the only foundation there's
[10:25] coming or shaking
[10:26] democracy shook to pieces kingdoms
[10:30] issues
[10:32] to pieces of all things
[10:36] but we receive a kingdom that cannot
[10:39] be moved steadfast
[10:43] unmovable always abounding in the mercy
[10:46] of god
[10:47] oh i love that i'm so glad to be a
[10:51] christian
[10:52] i don't know what i do
[10:56] if uh i would do if i wasn't a christian
[10:59] i'd probably be a suicide case
[11:02] if i wasn't a christian against statue
[11:05] of a perfect man 62 oh isn't it
[11:07] wonderful to serve the lord
[11:11] i don't know what i would do if i was in
[11:13] the christian
[11:15] it's just so good to be a christian
[11:19] how many believes that it's just so good
[11:24] to be a christian i just feel like
[11:27] jumping up and down and screaming to the
[11:30] top of my voice
[11:32] to be a christian think of it all
[11:35] anchored away in christ
[11:40] amen i'd be glad for that tonight
[11:43] praise the lord how many knows that we
[11:45] were born come into this world
[11:48] with a lot of parts missing
[11:51] not only with a lot of missing parts
[11:55] that we come into this
[11:56] world but we come up with a lot of
[11:58] things that
[11:59] that we were all messed up i mean our
[12:02] feelings
[12:03] weren't right our mind wasn't right our
[12:07] thinking wasn't right
[12:09] our heart wasn't right our soul wasn't
[12:11] right
[12:12] our talk wasn't right our talk wasn't
[12:16] right
[12:16] there was nothing right about us when we
[12:18] was came into this world
[12:20] we needed a lot of fixing that right
[12:24] and we needed a lot of the parts we
[12:26] needed we needed the things
[12:28] that actually makes you what you're
[12:30] supposed to be
[12:33] and that brings fulfillment in your life
[12:37] and i truly believe that when you become
[12:39] a christian
[12:40] whether it's the ladies or whether it's
[12:42] the men
[12:44] all right before you were natural bruce
[12:46] beast the man was and
[12:48] before perhaps the ladies were at jez
[12:50] bells
[12:51] huh without christ
[12:54] but whenever the holy spirit comes and
[12:56] when he feels you and gives you what you
[12:58] have need of
[13:01] amen it'll make a lady out of you it'll
[13:03] make you what god made you to be
[13:06] and the same way with a man whenever god
[13:08] comes down and he fills that part
[13:10] that was empty and he gives you that
[13:13] missing part of the holy ghost in your
[13:14] heart
[13:15] amen it makes you not a brute beast but
[13:17] it makes you a gentleman
[13:20] how many believes that tonight amen
[13:23] that's just some of the benefits tonight
[13:25] we want to go through some of the things
[13:26] that we probably know
[13:28] that come with being a christian brother
[13:30] ben i'm talking about
[13:32] benefits of the policy you know a
[13:34] policyholder he was talking about a
[13:36] policyholder how that that policy holds
[13:38] benefits he says the bible said forget
[13:40] not all the benefits
[13:42] of this policy now while you've got this
[13:45] assurance amen
[13:48] blessed assurance amen i mean that's one
[13:52] of the benefits of being a christian is
[13:54] you got
[13:55] assurance to where before you had no
[13:58] insurance
[14:00] your future was bleak your eternal
[14:02] destination was
[14:04] horrible a nightmare
[14:08] nothing but judgment and hell waiting
[14:10] for you
[14:12] all right so one of the
[14:15] beautiful benefits of being a christian
[14:17] and being saved is that you've got
[14:19] assurance you've got to benefit too
[14:23] david cried and forget not
[14:26] all his benefits folks i'm telling you
[14:29] if you begin to think that man a
[14:31] christian life is a little hard
[14:33] you just remember what it would be like
[14:35] without christ
[14:37] how hard it would be without him isn't
[14:40] that right what life would be
[14:42] without christ it'll make you begin to
[14:45] appreciate
[14:47] amen all the things that come with being
[14:49] a christian
[14:52] all right all right so he says now
[14:56] notice
[14:57] he says what are they david
[15:00] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[15:05] isn't that right and forgiveth all of
[15:07] thy diseases and so forth
[15:09] no wonder david cried forget not all of
[15:11] his benefits why you know
[15:13] after you come into the kingdom of god
[15:15] there's a lot of benefits brother baby
[15:17] says that go
[15:18] with it when god calls you knocks at
[15:21] your heart's door separates you from the
[15:23] things of the world
[15:25] amen when he calls you out he calls you
[15:27] into his kingdom
[15:29] i mean those are when you get born again
[15:31] you get called
[15:33] into a kingdom it's not america
[15:36] not england the kingdom of england not
[15:38] any other kingdom but it's the kingdom
[15:40] of god and then he says listen as we
[15:44] begin to go here now
[15:45] he's like a great big variety store
[15:49] he says you walk into a variety store
[15:51] down at the arcade somewhere
[15:53] you walk in and hear something over here
[15:55] look at it it's yours look over there
[15:57] here's something else oh i just love
[15:59] this big variety store don't you
[16:03] amen and we all get into it one way we
[16:06] get into this variety store
[16:08] into the benefits of calvary is by one
[16:11] spirit
[16:11] are we all baptized into one body
[16:15] amen into this variety sword now he says
[16:19] now lotus
[16:20] and this is the variety store right here
[16:22] and every blessing talking about the
[16:24] bible
[16:24] and every blessing and every promise in
[16:27] here
[16:28] that was given to mankind is for every
[16:30] person that's baptized into this variety
[16:33] story
[16:34] just write walk right up and possess
[16:36] yours it's yours
[16:38] something up here really high perhaps
[16:40] something that i have to climb high to
[16:42] get
[16:43] maybe it's out of my reach he says but i
[16:46] get a ladder to get it
[16:48] i want to see what it's all about don't
[16:50] you
[16:52] amen so brother ram goes to talking
[16:54] about having a variety story it's like a
[16:56] great big store
[16:58] it's got these shelves upon shelves upon
[17:01] shelves
[17:02] it has got some things that are perhaps
[17:04] just a little too hard for you to reach
[17:07] all right so what we're going to do
[17:09] tonight one of y'all some of y'all was
[17:11] wondering what i was carrying around
[17:13] here
[17:13] it's a box we're going to do a little
[17:15] bit of a skit
[17:16] be we all want to do a skit tonight all
[17:19] right we're going to do a little skit
[17:22] all right of the variety store
[17:31] now watch out bull in the china cabinet
[17:33] here
[17:34] all right okay can somebody
[17:38] tell me in this variety store trying to
[17:41] get up high enough to get this stuff
[17:43] what this ladder represents somebody
[17:45] tell me
[17:50] what does this represent
[17:57] raise your hand
[18:02] well it is but it's not what i'm looking
[18:04] for
[18:09] all right how many know sometimes it
[18:12] takes
[18:13] faith huh you gotta climb with faith
[18:17] right it takes faith you gotta climb in
[18:20] faith
[18:20] lord help me climb with faith that's
[18:24] right so you gotta climb in faith
[18:25] to try to get this now so what we got
[18:28] here
[18:30] i was gonna have to do a little bit
[18:31] something more but
[18:33] but says it's up there perhaps just a
[18:35] little out of your reach and
[18:36] at first i was gonna get this little
[18:38] bitty short ladder and bring it
[18:40] now it was a new one but i said man i
[18:42] could just reach that
[18:43] that really does defeats the purpose of
[18:45] being able to reach it you know he's
[18:47] most i can but maybe somebody could but
[18:50] up here it is
[18:51] all right now so he says you know you
[18:55] don't know for sure
[18:56] so let's look at god's variety story
[18:58] tonight shall we
[19:00] amen all right lord
[19:03] i'm getting on my knees and i'm praying
[19:04] now this ladder here
[19:06] it has been bent and shook around
[19:09] thought about having somebody come up
[19:11] here and
[19:12] hold this thing who wants to come hold
[19:15] this
[19:16] aaron you gonna come hold it for me
[19:20] all right so this ladder's a little weak
[19:23] right i mean it's been bent over and
[19:25] running over by truck
[19:27] all right now what does what does he
[19:29] represent
[19:32] on this weak ladder yeah i'm trying to
[19:34] get up here
[19:35] i don't really trust this ladder i need
[19:37] a little help right
[19:40] huh no it represents him
[19:44] you know sometimes it helps to have
[19:45] somebody pray for you right
[19:47] pray with me brother i need faith to
[19:49] reach up there you know maybe you need
[19:51] your hands laid on
[19:52] and that right and you could come up to
[19:55] the pastor to have it late but brother
[19:56] man said if you had perfect faith you
[19:57] wouldn't have to come up
[19:58] but it's not quite perfect you need a
[20:00] little help so you need a little prayer
[20:02] so he represents me needing little
[20:04] prayers all right
[20:05] so you're gonna pray for me right so i
[20:06] don't fall pray for me i don't fall
[20:09] you know not just anybody can come up
[20:11] here you know
[20:13] and guess what it takes a little
[20:14] climbing right
[20:16] i might have to pray a little bit more
[20:18] you may have to pray a little harder
[20:20] to get your blessing
[20:23] amen i thought about maybe preaching on
[20:25] that message called why
[20:27] why is the daughter of my people not
[20:28] healed remember a long time ago i
[20:30] preached that i
[20:31] i kind of do a rotation
[20:35] preaching huh brother baby said he came
[20:38] to give us
[20:39] the sermon to take care of our problems
[20:44] is that right so why do we still have
[20:45] them but anyway let's not go there
[20:47] but anyway so we got to have faith to
[20:50] come up here
[20:50] come up high enough now right and look
[20:54] wow let's see what we got here this
[20:57] whole bunch of stuff
[20:58] boxes in here here's another here's one
[21:01] wow
[21:02] check this out oh my it says the gift of
[21:06] god
[21:07] here's the gift of god what's the gift
[21:09] of god
[21:12] the wages of sin is death but
[21:16] the gift of god is eternal life all
[21:19] right so how many know that whenever you
[21:21] first
[21:22] amen first thing you go by faith will
[21:24] fade by faith right
[21:25] thank you for now that'll be good we're
[21:27] saved by grace through faith
[21:30] so we climb that lad
[21:33] amen and the first thing that comes in
[21:36] the box is an
[21:37] eternal life
[21:42] that should make us all run around this
[21:44] building
[21:46] if i truly appear i think i don't know
[21:49] brother brad when we get over there i
[21:51] wonder if we won't say man
[21:53] when he got to talk about each other
[21:55] this is eternal life
[21:56] we're gonna say this is eternal life but
[21:58] the man says there's no
[22:00] vocabulary right there's not
[22:03] right words to express to say
[22:06] how beautiful it really is
[22:10] beyond sublime beyond
[22:13] perfection that's what it's going to be
[22:17] it's when god gives you an eye eternal
[22:20] life that's the gift of god
[22:24] all right so he gives us the gift of
[22:27] eternal life praise be to god
[22:30] hallelujah all right look what's in
[22:33] there
[22:35] what did david say david says you know
[22:38] he forgives
[22:40] all of our trans iniquities
[22:44] and even brother brahm says those
[22:45] iniquities is things that you know
[22:48] that you shouldn't do and you do them
[22:50] anyway
[22:51] god forgives you for them
[22:55] how many would not be here uh
[22:58] if god wouldn't forgive you for the
[23:00] stuff that you do
[23:02] that you know you shouldn't
[23:05] come on you're pretty holy you're pretty
[23:08] righteous
[23:09] if you don't do things that you know you
[23:10] want to do and you never have should i
[23:12] say
[23:13] am i right that's pretty good but anyway
[23:16] oh no sometimes we do things we just you
[23:18] know we don't
[23:19] but by god's grace he forgives us of our
[23:22] iniquities because if he wouldn't
[23:24] we'd all be lost but he forgives us so
[23:28] that's the first thing
[23:30] great things and god's great thing is
[23:32] that you know we were born and sin
[23:34] shaped neck we've been coming at his
[23:36] word speaking lies
[23:39] and he forgives us of all of that one of
[23:42] the greatest things the greatest
[23:45] treasures is the forgiveness of almighty
[23:48] god
[23:50] and let's not just say when we got born
[23:52] again or whatever but our daily mistakes
[23:55] the mistakes you made today
[23:58] you can get forgiveness for i truly
[24:00] believe it
[24:01] [Music]
[24:03] oh sometimes we don't want to forgive
[24:05] ourselves we don't think god will
[24:06] forgive us
[24:07] but you would be amazed at how forgiving
[24:10] god is if you're willing to repent
[24:16] is that the truth every wrong thought
[24:20] that you have
[24:22] huh just the wrong thought it may not be
[24:24] something big but
[24:25] a wrong thought is sin that right
[24:29] praise the lord david said that's one of
[24:31] the benefits
[24:32] amen is forgiveness
[24:35] and heal of all thy diseases psalms 103
[24:41] hallelujah how many of those
[24:45] we'd be laying in bed somewhere with the
[24:47] coronavirus
[24:48] burning up we could be you know right
[24:52] and then we'd have to put you out in
[24:54] that graveyard out there
[24:55] because you died from it that's what
[24:57] could happen is that right
[25:00] or any other disease cancer
[25:04] all these diseases the bible says and
[25:06] that's why brother bannon on those two
[25:07] he says you know forgives you all your
[25:09] sins
[25:10] and heals all your disease all healing
[25:13] comes from god and brother
[25:15] even goes to talking about in your body
[25:17] that's healing in your body
[25:20] how many beliefs you have healing in
[25:21] your body and that is god in there that
[25:24] gave that to you so that you could feel
[25:26] good
[25:28] but he feels good oh yeah how many

[26:41] kingdom of god is all about
[26:43] here again we're looking at the kingdom
[26:44] of god amen it's a great variety story
[26:47] says listen
[26:48] the kingdom of god is not meat and drink
[26:52] but it's righteousness peace
[26:56] and joy in the holy ghost
[27:00] hallelujah honey believes that's what

[27:08] your maker
[27:13] number one he says it's about
[27:15] righteousness
[27:16] i mean you can't have righteousness
[27:18] outside of forgiveness
[27:20] without grace amen we have access
[27:24] unto god we're justified amen paul said
[27:28] by faith we are justified in that
[27:31] of entrance of access into disgrace
[27:35] amen and we have become what the very
[27:37] righteousness
[27:39] of god how many believes that if you are
[27:41] truly forgiven of all your sins you
[27:43] are as righteous as god is righteous

[27:54] righteous
[27:55] because how many knows that's got to be

[29:28] it's just so good to have peace in my
[29:31] heart
[29:34] it is just so good to have the joy of
[29:37] the lord
[29:38] in my heart because you know how many
[29:40] people would love to have a little joy
[29:45] people don't got no joy anymore
[29:49] people are not happy
[29:52] and people won't be happy until the joy
[29:55] of the lord
[29:56] comes into your hearts
[30:00] that's what the kingdom of god is all
[30:02] about it's about righteousness
[30:05] it's about peace and it's about joy
[30:10] come on people think about it climb that
[30:13] ladder

[30:18] happy enough to shout
[30:20] in my garage or in my own my lawn mower
[30:23] or driving down the road or
[30:25] i just haven't got that happiness
[30:28] people lose their joy even as christians
[30:31] maybe you've lost your jaw and you think
[30:33] you'll never get it back
[30:37] i don't know how to get my joy back i
[30:39] don't know how i'm gonna get it
[30:40] start climbing the ladder a little bit
[30:45] start climbing start praying it's there
[30:49] huh the devil took it from you will take
[30:51] it back said it's fine
[30:54] huh that's right go climb a little
[30:57] higher
[30:59] get up there take a little more faith
[31:03] climb that ladder of faith like
[31:06] david said he knew what it was like to
[31:08] have a frown on his face
[31:11] they would do what it's all like to get
[31:13] depressed
[31:15] but what they say lord restore unto me
[31:18] the joy of my salvation
[31:22] buddy i'll tell you what we talk about
[31:24] david we talk about dancing before the
[31:27] ark and stripping his clothes off and
[31:29] just having him a dance and jubilee
[31:31] in front of only ezreal but we don't
[31:34] talk about him
[31:36] sitting in his closet down in his
[31:38] basement in the darkest part of his
[31:40] basement
[31:41] ashamed to show his face because what he
[31:44] did with bathsheba
[31:46] huh he was in despair
[31:50] he knew what it was like to be in the
[31:52] depth of hell
[31:54] huh yes he died he didn't know what it
[31:58] was like to be there back down there
[32:00] because he would wrote about
[32:01] he says though i make my bed in hell
[32:04] thou art there
[32:05] you're still going to be with me you're
[32:08] going to help me out
[32:08] isn't that right that's why he could
[32:12] say that he says he delivereth your soul
[32:16] amen i don't pull the tab out but he
[32:20] talks about he saves you
[32:21] he saves your very life and he gives you
[32:24] joy
[32:25] and he gives you satisfaction he gives
[32:27] you food that you can be satisfied with
[32:31] amen praise the lord
[32:34] that's right so we got that's right
[32:35] eternal life
[32:37] amen eternal life righteousness peace
[32:40] and joy in the holy ghost
[32:45] praise the lord so let's look again
[32:49] we're talking about joy amen
[32:52] the world doesn't have any joy well what
[32:54] else is in here
[32:56] what else do we got let's look here
[33:04] wow what's in this box what's in here
[33:08] what's this one called
[33:11] oh oh wow this box
[33:16] says everything
[33:20] everything everything
[33:23] i want that yeah i want everything
[33:26] how about you you want everything what's
[33:29] in
[33:29] everything box
[33:34] i got everything here that's right
[33:38] let's look at this now oh my look
[33:43] inside here in that box
[33:46] there's a checkbook ah
[33:51] there's a checkbook and inside
[33:55] whose name you reckon down there
[33:59] thomas byler uh if that's on there it's
[34:03] gonna be
[34:04] limited
[34:07] i'm sure it probably is with you too
[34:09] maybe not quite as but
[34:11] i'm sure it's limited but with the lord
[34:13] jesus christ yeah
[34:15] ominous he'll bankrupt heaven
[34:19] and it's pretty rich before he'll let
[34:23] one of his
[34:24] checks bounce all right
[34:27] now let's go find out saint john
[34:31] 13-14 let's find out here
[34:35] actually yeah john
[34:40] 13-14 very familiar scripture like i
[34:43] said some of these are going to be
[34:44] familiar with us
[34:45] but it says in john 13 and 14 amen
[34:49] our checkbook it comes from this
[34:51] scripture
[34:53] how many knows that no matter what you
[34:54] preach it's got to be scripturally
[34:56] based no matter what brother branham
[34:59] said it has to be scriptural
[35:04] all right so it says verse 12 he do also
[35:07] and
[35:07] greater works than thee shall he do
[35:10] because i go to my father
[35:13] and whatsoever you shall ask
[35:16] in my name
[35:21] that will i do i will make it
[35:25] good huh
[35:28] so in this box we got a checkbook with
[35:32] jesus name
[35:33] sign on it and guess what you whatever
[35:35] you have need of
[35:37] you can go and get
[35:42] what did the bible say one place i hope
[35:44] i couldn't even halfway quote it right
[35:45] but
[35:45] whatsoever things you desire when you
[35:49] pray
[35:49] if you believe you will i can have what
[35:52] you have asked
[35:54] know what the bible says that's right if
[35:56] you'll believe it amen and
[35:58] with you nothing shall be impossible
[36:09] really is that really so
[36:14] you know all i can tell you is i'm gonna
[36:16] have to climb that ladder
[36:19] because that's kind of hard to believe
[36:20] sometimes for any of us
[36:24] we hear it with our ear yeah that's what
[36:25] the preacher says but do you really
[36:27] apply it to your life
[36:30] do you truly believe that whatever you
[36:32] ask
[36:34] god honored i know it puts doubt in
[36:38] there don't but it shouldn't
[36:41] let me tell you what i
[36:45] believe brother bam says as we go
[36:48] remember it's not a surprise to him
[36:49] and he's going to supply his children's
[36:52] as we go on
[36:54] when you have need of something i
[36:55] believe it'll be there
[36:58] amen praise the lord all right let's
[37:02] go to another one over here there's
[37:04] another one that gives us another
[37:06] place to get some more out of this box
[37:08] is in uh
[37:09] first corinthians 3 21.
[37:12] first corinthians
[37:20] 3.
[37:25] 21 all right now notice he says
[37:28] therefore
[37:29] let no man glory in men
[37:32] all for all things
[37:35] are yours notice
[37:38] it was the everything box right
[37:41] everything box
[37:43] all right for all things are
[37:46] yours whether paul or apollos
[37:50] or sivas or the world
[37:54] y'all stay seated will you if you
[37:56] possibly can the whole world's yours my
[37:58] friend
[38:00] that's god's bible that's god's that's
[38:02] god's promise
[38:04] right there or the world
[38:07] how many believes this world is yours
[38:10] [Music]
[38:12] let me can i give you another scripture
[38:14] the meek shall
[38:15] inherit the earth all right it don't get
[38:19] any better than that
[38:20] the meek shall inherit the earth
[38:24] praise be to god or life
[38:29] how many likes to be alive oh my
[38:33] let me just spit a little something in
[38:35] there
[38:36] sinning every time a person sins and
[38:39] gets away from god
[38:41] whether he's uh just coming out of
[38:43] teenage or going into teenage and every
[38:45] time they sin
[38:46] amen it shrinks their inner man up
[38:49] all right and they keep seeing them they
[38:51] keep getting away from god and you get
[38:53] more drier and better you get deader on
[38:57] the inside
[38:58] until you look like a cow that's been
[39:00] dead for two months laying out there in
[39:02] the field
[39:03] you're covered over with nothing but
[39:05] skin and bones
[39:07] dead as dead can be and that's what most
[39:10] people in the world
[39:12] look like sin would
[39:15] zap the life right out of you
[39:19] amen but what is ours life
[39:23] is ours our death
[39:28] amen do y'all remember how brother
[39:31] bannon
[39:32] explained how that we own death
[39:36] huh he said don't fear death death
[39:42] is nothing but a horse and buggy
[39:45] he said that it obeys us it serves
[39:50] us it's my servant now we own it
[39:54] amen because when jesus rose remember he
[39:57] had the keys
[39:58] of hell and of death and of the grave he
[40:02] had the keys of olive
[40:03] he owns he has the power over all of
[40:05] them and he gave those keys back to the
[40:06] church
[40:08] so death belongs to us also even death
[40:12] is our vehicle our means of getting from
[40:16] here
[40:17] to there amen it's our buggy
[40:21] to heaven not hell but to heaven
[40:24] that's what he explained that even death
[40:27] belongs to us
[40:28] are things present or
[40:32] things to come all right paul
[40:35] you're pouring it on a little heavier
[40:38] but he knew what he's talking about
[40:41] amen all are
[40:44] yours i know we got an amen on that
[40:48] right
[40:49] that's right all things everything
[40:53] is yours and ye
[40:56] are christ's and christ is god's
[41:00] praise be to the lord
[41:03] all right everything
[41:06] this is also called the inheritance box
[41:10] you inherit everything that right
[41:13] let's look at that one yeah let's look
[41:16] at one more scripture out of this box
[41:19] in uh romans 8
[41:23] 16 and 17.
[41:26] romans 8 16 and 17. how many believes
[41:30] that
[41:31] in christ we become an heir
[41:34] in other words we inherit something amen
[41:38] now we know that the whole world the
[41:40] whole
[41:42] earth belongs to christ i mean he
[41:45] paid for it with his own blood on
[41:47] calgary
[41:49] but you and i become what he calls joint
[41:52] heirs
[41:53] we're partners how many believe we're
[41:54] partnering with christ
[41:56] we're joint heirs according to romans
[42:00] 8 16 and 17.
[42:06] romans 8 16 and 17. all right
[42:09] now notice he says here verse 14 let's
[42:13] go back up a little bit
[42:14] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[42:16] god they are the sons of god
[42:19] praise the lord how many believes only
[42:22] those that have the holy ghost
[42:24] are truly inheritance only those who
[42:26] have the holy ghost
[42:27] have a right to that checkbook for you
[42:30] have not received the spirit of bondage
[42:31] again to fear but
[42:32] you have received the spirit of adoption
[42:34] whereby we cry
[42:35] abba father the spirit itself
[42:38] bear witness with our spirit that we are
[42:41] the children of god
[42:42] and if you're a child then you're an
[42:45] heir an heir of god a joint heir
[42:49] with christ hallelujah
[42:53] if he resurrected i'll get the resurrect
[42:56] too
[42:57] many believes that we're joint heirs
[42:59] with christ
[43:01] and if so be that we suffer with him we
[43:03] shall also be glorified

[46:40] isn't that the truth yeah we're a whole
[46:42] lot more than a sparrow
[46:44] sometimes we act like now god isn't even
[46:47] looking at us
[46:50] how many believes that jesus is always
[46:52] looking down on you
[46:54] he watches you he's got his eye on you
[46:59] he cares about every detail about you
[47:03] amen so notice
[47:10] let's read on are you not much more than
[47:13] they
[47:13] which of you by taking thought can add
[47:16] one
[47:17] bit to his statue all right
[47:21] i'm gonna tell you something funny about
[47:23] myself tonight
[47:26] uh when i was younger
[47:29] i wanted to be big i wanted to be like
[47:31] john michael or john laster right there
[47:33] i want to be tall you know
[47:36] so i do stretches stretch
[47:40] stretch this time mommy didn't realize
[47:43] you can't make yourself bigger
[47:45] huh is that right that's right
[47:48] you thought you think you can add one
[47:52] inch to it no that's all up to god he
[47:54] knew exactly the height he would be
[47:57] huh and even the bible says who
[48:00] who by taking thought can add one cupid
[48:04] to his stature
[48:05] who can be a little bigger amen
[48:08] now notice so he says and why
[48:12] take ye thought for raymond
[48:16] consider the lilies of the field how
[48:19] they grow
[48:20] they toil not and neither do they spin
[48:23] and yet i said to you that solomon in
[48:25] all of his glory was not arrayed
[48:28] like one of these now i don't know but
[48:30] i'm here to tell you solomon was arrayed
[48:32] pretty nice
[48:34] but he says you know these are raid by
[48:37] almighty god
[48:39] wherefore if god so clothed the grass of
[48:41] the field which the days and tomorrow is
[48:43] cast into the oven
[48:44] shall he not much more
[48:48] clothe you oh ye
[48:52] of little faith
[48:58] this box jesus says everybody
[49:03] huh right now we're having
[49:06] racial wars what they call i guess for
[49:09] what
[49:10] equality huh
[49:13] do you want more stuff they want stuff
[49:17] like you got stuff
[49:18] huh equality
[49:22] think about it they're worried about
[49:25] their natural sustenance huh
[49:31] but that's not what jesus said he said
[49:33] don't be thinking about all that
[49:36] what you're gonna wear or what you're
[49:39] gonna eat
[49:41] huh oh ye
[49:44] of little faith
[49:47] that's the truth we have a world that
[49:49] has very little faith
[49:51] therefore take no thought saying what
[49:52] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[49:54] wherewithal shall we be clothed
[49:57] for after these things to all the
[49:58] gentiles seek
[50:00] that's exactly what the whole world
[50:03] seeks after
[50:04] it's just food what did paul say the
[50:07] kingdom of god is not food and
[50:10] ramen food and raiment that's not what
[50:13] it's all about
[50:15] but it's about righteousness peace
[50:19] and joy in the holy ghost
[50:22] the whole world needs a whole lot of
[50:23] that don't it quit worrying about your
[50:25] food and you drink
[50:26] and everything else and think about that
[50:29] your heavenly father i like that
[50:32] knoweth that ye have need of these
[50:34] things
[50:35] but seek ye first the kingdom of god
[50:38] and his righteousness
[50:43] and all these things shall be added
[50:47] unto you don't worry
[50:50] god will take care of you don't worry
[50:55] brother bam says look at the little
[50:59] robin
[50:59] he raises up of a morning the first
[51:01] thing what did he do
[51:03] he throws his little face up towards
[51:05] heavens and goes to sing in
[51:07] to the top of his voice how many love
[51:11] springtime when the birds come back
[51:13] and they're out there just singing away
[51:16] singing away
[51:18] and i'll tell you what we don't even

[51:52] asked her to she's a wonderful woman
[51:54] not to put her down that by no means but
[51:57] listen
[51:58] so listen so he says in the morning

[53:17] the problem with this a lot of times is
[53:19] we think that we ought to have it better

[54:41] any hope and that right

[54:44] if we believe that jesus died and rose
[54:46] again even so them also
[54:48] which sleep in jesus will god bring with
[54:50] him
