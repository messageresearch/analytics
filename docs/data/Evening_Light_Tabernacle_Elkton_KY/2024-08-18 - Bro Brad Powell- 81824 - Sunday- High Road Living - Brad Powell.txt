[Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] good morning brothers and sisters if we'll just stand this morning maybe uh brother Joe will open us in prayer pray this morning here that take amen the children can be dismissed for Sunday school if we'll go in the Psalms to Psalms 9 Psalms 9 I will praise thee Oh Lord with my whole heart I will show forth all my thy marvelous works when mine enemies are turned back they shall fall and perish at thy presence thou has rebuked the Heathen thou has destroyed the wicked thou has put out their name forever and ever but the Lord shall endure forever he hath prepared his throne for judgment the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble sing praises to the Lord which dwelleth in Zion declare among the people his doings have mercy upon me oh Lord consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death the Heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made in the net which they hid is their own foot taken the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget God Arise oh Lord let not men Prevail let the Heathen be judged in thy sight put them in fear oh Lord that the nations may know themselves to be put but men Sila God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters sorry that last thing we read that they would know that they're just men there's nothing special about him humility is a hard thing for the world we live in right now there ain't a lot of humility out there if you would turn with me to uh Ephesians the third chapter you know that one quote this morning that was up there on the board coming out of why Christ Peak talking about the church and you know if you really get a revelation of who you are in Jesus Christ this morning knowing that you are the Living Church you're the Church of God you're the temple temple of God the presence of God abides in your heart and life you can really reach out and grab that Revelation and know who you are in Jesus Christ this morning there there's nothing to worry about the battle's already over you are going to be there on that day and be successful in any of your endeavors you know and I was thinking of the brother from from France from Wednesday do you think he's embarrassed to be a message believer after that what he preached to us through the Lord on Wednesday night you know for a fact that he's not afraid of the message of the hour or the word of God you know that and I was thinking a lot a lot of times we it's not that what fear has nothing to do with I was just thinking of what Paul had to say when when you're dealing with people from denominations and other Christians out there they say you're following a man you believe a false way and all this that shouldn't that shouldn't affect you at all if you've had that Revelation but then when you what you really what I know is I always tell them well you're following a man too you're following the man Jesus Christ and you're following the man Paul because when we read the scriptures it's the revelation of Jesus Christ himself in the gospels and as Paul and the apostles taught it to us in the you know in the end of the Gospel in the Epistles so I'm just going to read what Paul had to say so but they're following a man's teaching also for this is what Paul had to say for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles so he's identifying who he is right there in the scriptures he's our messenger he's that prophetic Messenger to the first church to to set in order how the church is to be established and you'll deal with people out there in the world and and when you talk about the teachings of Paul what do they do to you well I believe Jesus or I believe what the gospels say well you can't be that way it's all the word of God or it's not and Paul goes on to say here if you've heard of the dispensation of grace of God which is given to me your word I'm getting bad in pronunciations as I get older how that by Revelation he may known unto me the Mysteries as I write a four in few words so he's letting the people know through this word that God gave him a re Revelation that he was going to bring in a gentile church he was going to bring in a gentile bride and he goes on to say here whereby when we read we may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not main know Unto the Sons of man and as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit so this goes back to what Jesus said said in the gospel he told the the Believers he told the Pharisees that he was going to send Apostles and Prophets and preachers to bring the people into repentance and he and Paul's identifying who he is right here and the Gentiles should be fellow hers of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel like I said I can't go wrong just reading what God's word has to say and then we go to the seventh verse and it says here where whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power so Paul it you know was this Messenger to this first age no different than brother Bram was the messenger to the last age this word that we follow the revealed word of the hour and what we're following in the Bible is all God's word and he goes on to say unto me who am less than the least of all the saints is Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ so he's saying who he's he's identifying who he is and what he is and to make all men see which is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent now onto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God God so Paul right here in these 21 verses is laying down exactly what he is and who he is in the word of God it doesn't make him anything more than a man just makes him the messenger that God is using to the Gentile church just like brother bram's the messenger to us in the last age of the Gentile church and he goes on to say in whom we have boldness and ask access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribul ations for you which is your glory for this cause I bow my knees unto the father our Lord Jesus Christ and he goes on to say here of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named and that's who we are this morning goes back to that quote this morning really that Revelation nothing will stand before you if you really get the Revelation who Jesus Christ is who and who the word of God speaks to our heart this morning that's what the Christian is is you're the Church of God the world sees Christ through you this morning I mean all the power that it all abides in the word of God and in the presence of Jesus Christ and if that presence in you there's nothing that couldn't stand before you that does it mean everything we do is successful no but we just try harder and harder you know I was reading what brother brandham uh earlier in the week in a quote he said he said if I preach to a 100,000 people or um the numers right I'm paraphrasing but let's say he preached to a thousand people Divine Healing and those thousand people died he would still preach Divine Healing the next day and believe the word of God so it's not the evidence of what you see but it's the word of God above all things and he go I lost my place here therefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulation for you which is your glory for this cause I bow my knees onto the father of our Lord Jesus Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is name that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might by a spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith and it goes what I'm saying here this morning everything is by faith in Jesus Christ this morning it goes that one scripture we're reading the first uh you know John 1:1 in the beginning you know in the beginning and it all begins in the beginning in Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that you be being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints which is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ and which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God and know unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you ask or think according to the power that worketh in him unto him be glory in the church by Jesus Christ throughout all ages of the world without Amen Let me just I don't have a lot more to say I know I say that a lot but I was uh also reading something this morning and the world we live is such a fragile place this morning and it's really important for us as Christians this morning to hold on to the word of God and that presence we have in our hearts and lives that comes through salvation because everything we see today it could be gone tomorrow and the only thing that'll be there the next day when everything is gone is your relationship with Jesus Christ and I I was just thinking of the world that we live in especially in America people that have never traveled outside this country it strikes me that they think they can make a better way but everything they're trying this morning doesn't make a better way it just brings more suffering more just brings more problems than it changes anything but I was also thinking for us this morning I I read the other thing that I heard this morning I'm going to sit down here is that you have to have confidence in your relationship with you have to have confidence in your pastor you have to have confidence in your salvation and you have to have confidence in the word of God you have to have all those things this morning to be successful and the whole purpose of your your enemy is going to do everything he can to spoil that relationship that you have this morning he's doing everything he can to make you see something's wrong here something's wrong there this ain't right here this ain't right here that's his whole purpose out there is to get you off the mark and as the what I'm trying to say is you have to I know for myself you have to struggle each day to just stay on the path this morning God is looking for Christians this morning I believe no matter what the world says what the world does they're going to follow the truth of the hour they're not going to be swayed either way I don't know I was having I don't know not a flashback or anything I was thinking the people in the in our um country they're they're wanting the government to get give them everything and take care of everything and I was just thinking this morning well you know I've been to countries in the world that have tried that type of lifestyle and it's not a pretty sight after it happens so I was just thinking this morning it's better just to trust the Lord and whatever happens is going to happen but for you as the believer this morning you've already one there's nothing to worry about Brother David of the Lord this morning amen I I was thinking as brother Brian was speaking and you know the world is falling apart this morning and we see it more day by day but thought the only real peace that I have this morning is in you Lord let's stand and sing that little chorus if we could this morning amen oh the only real peace that I have dear Lord is it in [Music] you oh the only real

you want to turn in your Bibles I I'm going to try to a little lesson going this morning and and uh I'm going to preach on uh one of my favorite subjects to preach on today and that's Jesus that's one of my favorite subjects because I've just always found when you call on him he comes now turn with me if you would in the Book of Matthew we're going to read chapter out of chapter five Matthew Chapter 5 while you're turning there put these over here there may have some songs after service that we'll try to sing but Matthew Chapter 5 and speaking on Jesus and and I want to speak if we were to title this High Road living High Road living Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 13 ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have have lost its Savor wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under the foot of man ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we're just grateful Lord to be in your house once again today Lord and just to be able to share the word and and what you've laid on our heart just to lift your name up Lord Lord there's no name greater there's no name higher there's no name that carries more Authority and power and demonstration than the name of Jesus and Lord Jesus you know that as a man I'm just a man and I stand here just as a man but if you'll come this morning and speak through my lips Lord anoint the anoint my lips anoint my thoughts anoint my efforts Lord Jesus and anoint the hearts of your believers who set here today hungry hungry for the word of God you can do miraculous things in our lives so Lord we just Commit This service into your hands and give you all the honor and glory for the things that will be done and said today in Jesus name amen you can have your seats brother Brown said I've I've often said this he said you be salty and the Earth will be thirsty he said you're the salt of the earth such a presence here today you're the salt you and the Earth will be thirsty you're the salt of the earth you just get salty and the Earth will get thirsty he said you live in such a way in the neighborhood and the people around you and the people you know and they'll say there's a real Christian I tell you that he said if there ever was a Christian there she is or there he is am salty Carson would you bring up The Message Bible version of that scripture for me it's a little different he had to search for it but this is The Message Bible when I say that it's not the the Bible written by anybody in the message it's a translation of the Bible but as I looked at it and I got to thinking about it and I want you you to look at the way it reads in this time it says let me tell you why you are here he says you're here to be salt seasoning that brings out the god flavors of this Earth if you lose your saltiness how will people taste godliness he says you've lost your usefulness and you'll end up in the garbage hold right there for now anybody that knows me knows that I love salt I salt salt I keep a little thing of Salt by my in my kitchen in the morning I grab a pinch of salt put it in my mouth when I go to bed yeah I love salt it's Savory when I go to bed at night I grab a pinch of salt and put it in my mouth go to to bed with it in my mouth sleeping you say man your blood pressure must be out the roof checked it the other day 120 over 72 I'll take that every day because it's not the salt that raises up now I'm not a doctor nor do I play one on TV but table salt is different than natural salt and the Bible the word here is talking about the salt if the salt has lost its savor so what is it the difference is table salt has had all of the mineral all of the god flavors pulled out of it it's different than natural salt it's got iodine added into it but you take the natural salt Celtic Sea salt has 92 minerals and elements in it that is Savory for the body and that is what we're talking about here is adding God's flavors when you're salty with the savoring salt of God you then begin to put out life you begin to put out love you put out joy you put out peace you put out longsuffering you put out forgiveness for your brothers and sisters and forgiveness for The Sinner you'll begin to draw people because they flavor they see the flavor in your life and they see something different about you pull up the rest of the scripture Carson he here's another way to put it you're here to be a light bringing out the god Colors Of The World God is not a secret to be kept watch's this what's it say next we're going public with this so many times we pull into our little shelves we pull into our little worlds and we say oh my goodness I'm a Christian but look at everybody else I believe the message but look at all these other people we're going public with this we're going public with this and he says as as as public as a city on a hill if I make you lightbearers you don't think I'm going to hide you under a bucket do you if God has done something in your life and he is so proud and so so honored by the life that you're living because you're living the life of a Christian you think he's going to hide you no we hide ourselves we get afraid we get full of fear we get full of anxiety we don't put ourselves out there but the word says in this translation we're going public we're taking this message public we're taking the word of God public I'm going to put you on a Hilltop I'm going to put you on a lightstand shine keep open High house be generous with your lives by opening up to others you'll prompt people to open up with God the generous Father in heaven so brothers and sisters often times we think man we're marked we're branded that little that little church out there on Taylor's Road or whatever it is Taylor's Chapel Hill they're branded they're marked they're marked in the community but but I want to ask you what is it that the people's eyes have on us that we're different okay we may be different we are but there's no shame in being different there's no shame in being different but let me ask you what are we known for you see today's message it it may Shake us up a little bit and that's okay we can stand to be shook a little bit but I want you to know is what God want you to be I want to be what God wants me to be and God Jesus said to be the salt and the light be the salt and be the light because salt makes things better with flavor and the light makes things brighter with colors the salt and the light so any of you that may be familiar with John Maxwell and his writings I I I I'll tell you I was blessed this week he has a new book and I'm not here to sell books but he has a new book Jesus the high road leader this book ain't out on shelves yet this book is not in Amazon yet I've got a copy of this book I was in a conference last week for three days with John Maxwell 90 books on Christian leadership 11 best sellers this will be number 12 you watch and see you there'll be tens of thousands of services preached in the next year two years on Jesus the high road leader you remember the the prayer of J Bez Brook W Bruce Wilkinson how many messages was preached on the prayer of JZ this will overtake that and I'm not doing that to lift him up or put anything but I got a copy of this book and and I began to look at it and I began to read it because it was you could only buy it there I thought I got to have it can't nobody else read it I'm going to read it so I got it on my way home and I began to read at the airports and on the and on the uh airplanes and in this book he talks about and he describes three paths that we can walk in life he says there's a a low road and in that low road people on this road are selfishly motivated they they they take more than they give and as a result instead of making the world better and brighter they make the world worse worse and darker how many times have we seen people walking the low road in life they want they want they want they want they take they take they take they take we see it in church you see it in your families you see it you see it everywhere in politics in the culture Won Won Won take take take can't give nothing that's the low road and he says there is a Middle Road and on this Middle Road he said people on this road focus on fairness and they often keep score you know you you got scorekeepers right sometimes we keep score you know brother so and so done this and I tell you I remember when and and he you that's keeping score that's keeping score and I I tell you today that we can't keep score because none of us are going to win if we keep score don't be a scorekeeper but these people keep scor for and and they maintain their status quo there's there's nothing that gets better and there's nothing that gets brighter and this is the people I think has to be we have to be aware of and be careful of because in Le oosa in leosa age that we're living in we can see it right there because God said you're neither hot you're neither cold you're lukewarm and I'm going to spew you out of my mouth so let me read this little translation to you and this is God speaking about Le out of see you and he says I know you inside and out that can be scary I know you inside and out and I find little to my liking the Church of Le oosa you're not cold you're not hot far better for it to be either cold or hot you're stale you're stagnant you make me want to vomit that's harsh words coming from our God you make me want to vomit you brag I'm rich I've got it made I need nothing from anyone but obviously You're Pitiful You're Pitiful you're blind you're a beggar you're threadbear and you're homeless now they may have the finest of riches and think they don't need nothing here in this world but they're homeless in the Kingdom of God in the in the Kingdom of Heaven they find themselves homeless let me tell you I'm not worried about this home down here I'm worried about my heavenly home that's where I want to be so God help me not to be stale God help me not to be stagnant God help me to be on fire with all that's within me Jesus wants us all to follow him wholeheartedly on this high road so what is this High Road the high road it's people on this road they follow Jesus they follow Jesus's example they give more than they take I'm I'm I'm check something here they give more than they take they serve others out of love you know it's one thing to serve somebody out of obligation is completely different to serve somebody out of love that neighbor that that kicked your dog last week needs his mailbox put back up and you do it out of love not out of obligation you getting somewhere they turn the other cheek instead of making a fence they reflect the behavior that Jesus had and because they do these things they make the world a better brighter place that's the high road leader brothers and sisters that's the life that Jesus lived that's the life he lived before people and who were the people that followed Jesus they were common ordinary people that wanted to follow him not the popular not the dignitary not the religious leaders not those who were rich not the higher ups let me take it a step further where Jesus walked the poor followed where Jesus walked the sick followed where Jesus walked the lame followed the drunkard followed the Harlot followed the addict followed that's where Jesus walked and he walked a high road and we would be ashamed to walk on that road many times if these people followed us if we walked down the road and a prostitute was following us and a drug addict was behind her and there was a drunkard following along give me he here give me give me we would be ashamed we would run get out of here get away from me don't look at me so Pi you know you would after today I hope we don't but if these people were following you why were they following him why did the maniac of gadera follow him this Maniac was living up in the cemeteries this man was a beast suicidal cutting himself that's what that's what it that's what it is he's suicidal he's a cutter and he's cutting him himself he's a beast he was known to be howling and crying this guy was was unbearable and he follows Jesus you know the word uh scholars believe and they think they they type the G the maniac and when I I read this in in another documentary somewhere but they type him and they say he's the first Apostle of the Gentiles think about that that could be you or me that could be us with depressive thoughts there's people that have had Suicidal Thoughts there are people that get deranged but this man here has now become the first Apostle of the Gentiles and now he's following Jesus teaching Jesus took it back to his neighborhood and said let me tell you about a man that walks on the high road yeah let me tell you about a man who walks on the high road so are you walking on the high road this morning are you walking on the King's Highway it's a Highway to Heaven yep none can walk up there but the pure in heart it's a Highway to Heaven I'm walking up the King's Highway are we walking up the high road if not just start walking start while I'm talking Walking Up The King's Highway there's joy in knowing with him I'm going I'm walking up the King's Highway walk up that highway but so many times we want people to walk our way oh if they would live the way I live bless God I'm in the message we don't even give them a chance to come to God well some of you believe that we don't even give them a chance we don't give them a chance to to walk in the presence of Jesus we don't give them a chance we don't even make it able for them to see deliverance we don't even Del make it uh make it able for them to have hope we don't even make it able for them to see salvation because they don't walk The Way We Walk did you always Walk This Way raise your hand if you did I I need to shake it no we didn't always walk this way but God's way is the only way let me ask you this the truth truth is if I were to ask a hundred people around this message a message question tell me something you if I were to ask what what do you think about this in the message how many different answers would I get wo we got some Honest Hearts yeah we can't even message churches can't even get along hang up over little isms hang up over this little quote this little quote that little quote this little personality that little personality but one thing let me ask you this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever yes is Jesus still a Healer yes is Jesus still a deliverer yes is Jesus still a savior yes it's unanimous Jesus is Jesus yes oh yeah think about it but we try to scale the fish before we catch the fish you can't do that you can't go out there and start start digging at people's lives and trying to tear them apart and you ain't even got a hook in their mouth what do you think they're going to do you try to reach down there and grab a grab a fish or stab him with a knife in the water where's he going he's gone like lightning you're never going to see him again why because you didn't even set the hook in his mouth listen to the the listen to what this Prophet says God will place in the church the place that he sees you after he's adopted you you mean you have to come to him first you have to be a part of the family first well boy that's a that's an eye opener ain't it you got to be part of God's economy before he can use you you got to be part of the program before he trusts you yeah that's what he's saying you got to be adopted into his family first he'll call you out someday in a little prayer meeting be salty be salty he'll call you out one day in a little prayer meeting and then he'll place a robe on you and say now son I've sent you to preach the gospel he didn't say now you're going to preach the gospel living a sinner's life or you're going to preach the gospel doing this or doing that he didn't come to you and say that no but he first said come unto me yeah love come unto me I am a savior come unto me but what we try to do instead of saying come unto God come unto the love of God we say come to serpent seed come to the Seven Seals Oho boy you hear this handkerchief drop come to the church ages but I I thought you was a Christian what what are you talking about oh I'm a Christian but come you need to come hear this this is the greatest thing and am I denying it no am I playing it down no it is turn with me to John 13 you see Jesus valued all people just hold your place there in in in John 13 Jesus valued all people but let me ask you this are you doing what Jesus did I've preached on it before that bracelet that used to go around and it's what would Jesus do right wwjd what would Jesus do and everybody had to wear it everybody had it it was everybody had it well Maxwell being a little bit more clever than the thought he said instead of what would Jesus do why don't we change it and say do what Jesus did so he gave out bracelets to all 33500 people that was in the auditorium the other night do what Jesus did you see Jesus gave more than he received do you Jesus didn't keep score it's a good thing Jesus didn't keep score because Peter was a scorekeeper SK Peter was a SC a scorekeeper how'd that work out for him it didn't work out too good for Peter because Jesus come to him and he told him Peter before morning the before the crows in the morning you're going to deny me three times Peter Never Never My Lord would I deny you do you know this guy never seen him I thought I saw you with him at the market the other day wasn't me must have been My Doppelganger are you sure you wasn't with those other other 11 10 11 guys out there walking around [Music] nope oh my Lord what what have I done what have I done I have failed I have lost I have miserably failed the Lord and now here they're going to hang him on a cross and now here I am I've lost in the game of life I'm going to go back to fishing that's what he did do you realize that he walked away from everything he saw Jesus in the life of Jesus and in the ministry of Jesus he turns around and walks back to the fishing hole thank God for Jesus he says I I I'm a loser I've kept score in life and I'm a loser but Jesus says no you're not a loser you're a rock Peter and he goes to the Sea and he finds Jesus and says pet he finds Peter and Jesus says Peter come on can't Lord I've turned my ways I've failed Peter come on up on this rock oh come on Church Upon on this rock upon your upon your unbelief upon your denying upon your lying Upon Your Cheating upon your stealing I'm going to build my church Jesus knew what it was to be human Jesus was right for the right reasons Jesus lived an authentic life Jesus placed others first Jesus brought people together Jesus loved people how do I know that I'm truly following Jesus how do you know ask the question right how do I fully know that I'm following Jesus John 1331 therefore when he was gone out Jesus said now is this is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him if God be glorified in him shall God also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him little children yet a little while I Am with You ye shall seek me and as I said unto the Jews whether I go you cannot come so now I say un to you are you with me now I say unto you a new commandment this is something they hadn't heard yet now I say unto you a new commandment that ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this say that with me by this one more time by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you follow the message uh uhuh uh uh uh no if you teach serpent seed nope nope nope nope nope ah that's not what it said oh oh why are y'all so quiet come on Church you'll know that you're my disciples if ye have loved one to another love you mean all it takes is love let me show you how Jesus loved this when he says this brothers and sisters it's just after they had the last supper and Jesus is finishing washing up the disciples feet now we look at this as an act of humility but let's put oursel in that scene for just a moment Jesus is sitting there and he's he gets a basin and pours it gets ready to pour it out to wash the disciples feet come on Peter and he he he kneels down and he's he's washing the disciples feet Lord bless you Peter you're you're just a great follower come come here come here Mark come here Matthew and he's washing their feet one by one come here come here John come on Judas come on come oh we forget about him you mean Jesus come come on Judas after he knew that he would betray him read before it he washed come come here Judas you're just playing your part to serve the entire world a savior who and Jesus now washing the disciples feet and he knows after he tells them love one another as I have loved you that by this they will know you are my disciples you're my followers you teach my word you teach my message you teach my life that's what a disciple is right and at all of this time he knows that the cross is awaiting his arrival he knows that there is a hungry cross ready to take his lives his life and these are the words of wisdom that he gives out love one another he's fixing to die the most horrible brutal cruel death any man has ever seen in the entire world then now or ever you can't compare it there is no no torture no no uh uh uh no matter of of torture or event that could be even compared to what Jesus went through or ever will be but he gives this wisdom to his disciples love people cherish people value people so you mean we're not supposed to draw lines between people we're not supposed to to debate over this scripture or debate over this quote or build walls between this church church and that church and this group and that group or this man and that centner or this Christian and and and the woman at the store clerk the woman at Walmart you say I'm going to need a quote for this where you're going I got to have a quote well you're in luck cuz I happen to have one I want you to listen to this and listen close I'm going to try to get through it this quote here is what got me so so emotionally wound up this morning I'm so grateful tonight to the Lord Jesus for what he's let me do for his people I love people God knows that and he goes on to talk about how he can't be with everybody because he's studying the message he's studying the word he's trying to get a message ready for the people and he can't be out there like he wants to be and he says some people he's talking about they kind of criticize him he said but people don't understand it they don't know until we cross that River but love real true love I love people he says when I was a little boy raised up in a in in a home not too good a family and nobody seemed to care for me and in my own family many of my brothers they would drink they smoke they they did things that I didn't do I was the black sheep of the family but I found out someday that somebody really loved me he said somebody let me know that Jesus loved me you see we don't know what people are going through you don't know the hardships you don't know the trials the struggles the pain all sometimes we see is a smile in face a successful businessman but you don't know the loss maybe of a loved one a child a wife a husband you don't know the split that went on in the church you don't know the things the preacher that mistreated them the Deacon the song leader say it whatever you want you don't know what's going on in their lives but he said let me tell you Jesus loved me and I thought to myself s you mean the very highest of all high the ve the god of Heaven Loves Me This is the prophet talking do you see what a revelation of Love began to work in his life as a young person he said the first time I ever prayed I couldn't pray he said you know what my first prayer was he said I was a hunter and I lived back in the woods and I said I'm gonna write my prayer out on a piece of paper and Tack it on a tree in the woods and then and then I'd know he'd come down that path sometime and he would read it and forgive me wow he said I I wrote it out on a piece of paper and I got to thinking wow they told me he was a man and if he's a man then he will understand as a man aren't you thankful that God looks at our lives and says I understand what you're going through I understand the challenges you're facing I understand the hardships and the pain and the hurts that you've been through I understand and he said so I went out to the shed and it was real wet and I got a sack and I knelt down I can only imagine a feed sack and he said I knelt down and I heard people say God talk to me he said well I said now how must that how must I do that how how must I hold my hands what do I do how do I do it I didn't know how to do it well I seen a picture one time like this with somebody praying with their hands like this and I got my hands like this and this is where it got me I said Dear Sir Mr Jesus Mr Jesus Mr Jesus I wish to speak to you for a minute I wish to speak to you for a minute would you come up here for a minute I want to speak to you for a minute I don't hear you where are you at where are you at I want to speak to you maybe I didn't hold my hands right he said maybe I should have crossed my fingers maybe I should have crossed my fingers so I crossed my hands and I said Mr Jesus if I don't cross my hands right or whatever I'm doing wrong will you forgive me he said because I don't mean to do it in the wrong way but if you come here for just a minute I want to talk to you a little bit you talk about a love he said now that's how much I know about God right there when I loved him he said you know I've been so mean I won't even he won't even talk to me and I guess I'm lost for good then and I started crying and I said well sir I'm going to confess my sins any he said I'm no good and I said you are all good you are all good but when I was dying there in that hospital I told you I would talk it over with you and this is all I can do and he said about that time a little light circled it came across he said a and a cross Came Upon the wall and he said my sins left when love had been projected and Sovereign Grace took its place when love had been projected and Sovereign Grace took its place he said it's answered it's really love and that's all you have to do love the Lord with all my heart with all my mind with all my strength and and it'll work with any human by this shall all man know that you are my disciples if you'll love one another you see Jesus valued all people in life John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved do you have that Carson let's listen to it in the message version this is how much God loved the world he gave his son his one and only son and this is why so that no one need be destroyed how guilty are we at times of destroying people look at their life look at the way they live look at look at the way they talk look at the way they walk look at the way they they do this and they do that and we begin to destroy and we cut and we tear and we pull let's don't be that person by believing in him anyone can have a whole and Lasting life I like this part God didn't go to all the trouble of sending his son merely to point out an an accusing finger and telling the world how bad it was but he came to help to put the world right again so when John here is saying that Jesus loved the world he was making it clear that God loves and values people so God was always pulling for the underdog God is always pulling on the Outsider he's trying to get the person that nobody else wants he's looking for the one that's overlooked and he's looking for the ones that he could see the potential in and the people around him had very little to offer think about it Jesus saw fishermen As Leaders when he saw zakus he saw a giver everyone else saw a taker yeah let's think about this for a minute here's zakus one of the head tax collectors in all the region of Jericho this person is not very well liked but the Bible says he was a rich man as a tax collector he was scorned by his countrymen for a couple of reasons one of them was he was known for cheating the taxpayers well I than you [Music] oh 10 12% 10 went to Rome two went to Zach so he's known to be a cheater and number two he was known to work for Rome if Rome was ruling over you do you really like people that is working and helping and pushing and allowing Rome to gain more over you no so his fellow men the Jews they didn't like him because he was a collaborator with the enemy a traitor to his own people this is zakus but zakus wanted to see the Lord as he passed through the town I could have any of you Sunday school kids come up here and tell me the story zakus a wee little man and he climbs up into that sycamore tree and he's up there in that sycamore tree just wanting to get a glimpse of the star wanting to get a glimpse of of of of the man of the hour that's the way I was at the Maxwell conference we had a service I Us in there we had I was at a conference for leadership and training and so forth and he's speaking and other people are speaking well on the third night after we've been in we've been uh two days of conference for uh 10 11 hours a day we started at 6:00 in the morning and go to 600 or 7 8:00 at night well on the third day everybody's tired I'm thinking man I'm exhausted and John Maxwell says we're going to have a faith service tonight we're going to have a worship ship service tonight we're going to I'm going to preach tonight all right now we're getting somewhere so me being the early person I am it starts at 7 I'm 6:30 I'm 6 6:30 yeah 6:20 I'm standing there at the door and I I notice all these people are like it's just loud and I'm like so I'm standing at the door well as it gets closer to seven about 10 till I start feeling claustrophobic like my goodness 5 to 7 I'm I I'm no longer this far from the door I've been pushed up to the door these people want to see John Maxwell preach they want to hear him preach they want to get in there and find out what he's got to say zakus was up in that tree if I could just watch Jesus this star walk by something might change my life they open the doors then people about knocked me down I said I have heard I told my wife I told my mind and myself I said I have heard the greatest message ever preached on the on the face of the Earth and I've never had nobody knock me down to get in to sit to hear it thank you brother 4,000 people fighting for the front row I I I just kind of walked in I getting ready to sit down no no no no you can't sit there Tak okay sorry so I move on back ah no no no this this table's taken is reserved okay sure like anybody I wanted to front row I want to hear what Maxwell had to say I get finally get a seat and I'm sitting down this big guy about 7 foot5 big guy says hey buddy can you scoot your chair down I want to set my chair here yep no problem Lord bless you and Maxwell begins to preach the most simple but Dynamic message I think I've ever heard on Jesus the high road leader out of 4,000 people he made an altar call I thought this could get interesting 350 to 400 people lined up to give their heart to the Lord I told my wife wife I said you know what I I struggle with that and you're going to know where I'm going with this I struggle with that did they just come up and give a confession and get the free Bible he gave them in the book and are they going to go out and do whatever they do from here on out or was there really a true confession and a change to take place and then I come to the reality that's not my business something spoke to their heart at least to move them in front of a crowd of 3,000 4,000 people to come down and say I want Jesus it's not up to me just know that they've got the seals the the the revelation of the of the church agent that's not up to me to decide God will place it in there but here's zakus up in this tree and he's looking down there and he's he's wanting a glimpse of this and he's walking there and he's thinking nobody knows I'm up here nobody knows I'm here and Jesus looks up zakus get down here get down here me you know me yeah I know who you are I know you're a cheater I know you're a scoundrel I know you work for the other side I know you're a liar I know you're an enemy to your people I know all these things and here's zachus he's Overjoyed but the crowd is grumbling how could Jesus pick this guy how could Jesus pick this guy the worst that we know who's cheated everyone here how could he call him out because Jesus saw the potential Jesus didn't see a taker he saw a giver what did zakus do when he started following he said Lord I'm rich and I've been you I I I've got more than I need so I'm going to give away half of all that I've got and Lord I hadn't always been the most honest person and for anybody that I've cheated I'm gonna give them F four times as much back they saw a taker God saw a giver see Jesus Through The Eyes Of Love he looked and he could see that Lazarus was a living man not a dead man Through The Eyes Of Love he can look at a Samaritan woman and know you've got value and Jesus as he come down there and he had began to have this conversation with the Samaritan woman who'd come to get water from the well all by herself this is this is an extraordinary scene the the time to get water to fill the pictures is a big time deal for the women over there it's when all the women get together and they they have their Little Hen party as we might call it man they talk about what's what they cooking for dinner I got this new recipe you ought to see this new pattern I'm I'm making a dress out of oh so and so's dating this one and this one's dating that one and I think they're going to get married yeah yeah come on ladies help me but no here she is all by herself all by herself despised despised and rejected and here is God who by Jewish culture should have no part whatsoever with this woman the Samaritans were hated and here as Jesus begins to sit down and talk to her a woman who during iCal times she was scrutinized she was ostracized she was marked as being immoral an unmarried woman living openly with the sixth in a series of men and here she says talking to my Lord privately what would we think that hits home don't it what would we think and here she is talking and and Jesus begins to to teach and Jesus begins to talk to her and Jesus tells us that God loves us in spite of our bankrupt lives did you hear what I said in spite of your bankrupt life when you got no friends you got no family you got no love you got no joy you got no peace you've got nothing and Jesus says I love your bank bankrupt life because you've got so much to offer what does this say for us what does this say for us as Believers it says that God loves you more than you could ever love yourself and how many of you love yourself I'm the only honest one thank you brother John appreciate that sure we do we love ourselves because in our own eyes we have value and God loves us more than what we could value oursel but the better question to ask today is how do you value other people what what what do you do with to The Sinner what do you do to the non-religious how do you value people you don't even know how do you put value on people that you don't know the answer is because God values them you should value them listen this leaving therefore leaving behind I want everything to be based upon the word of God and as you realize tonight what a responsibility it is to be a Christian minister who stands before an audience when each soul is valued at the value of 10,000 worlds now you've heard that all your life but let that sink in The Sinner the drug addict the alcoholic The Prostitute you mean their soul is worth 10,000 worlds so he says as a minister I approach any subject and because it's a vital thing for today but let me ask you if that's for the minister what about your ministry what about you as you go out into the workplace what about you what about when you're ministering at Walmart when you're ministering at the school when you're ministering at work when you're ministering wherever you're at when you're just walking down the street think about how many people you come in contact with in a week and a day sometimes tens sometimes 50s sometimes hundreds maybe even thousands in a in a week's time that you come in contact with and it's you to be a minister of the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost and dying world that's you you're the minister it's not up just to me and brother Bor and brother Donnie and brother Ron and brother Andrew brother Joe all these different ones you are the minister we want to get to a place that we're being a light shake the salt turn on the light John 7 there's records of a woman that's caught in adultery Jesus is passing by the temple and and and teaching and the people in the temple courts and here comes the teachers and the Pharisees that bring this woman up and they tell Jesus said we've caught this woman in the very Act of adultery they make a mockery of her and stand her up before the whole crowd it says teacher this woman was caught in the very Act of adultery and the law of Moses commanded us to Stone such a woman what do you say the Trap is set yeah that's all this was was a trap let's see if we can get him to confess the the wrong way he'll have he'll have the government against him either that or he'll have the church against him either that or he'll he'll belittle the law of Moses the Trap is set what do you say in this case of adultery you see in the case of adultery it's stoning if Jesus recommends stoning and the one or recommended the woman be released he's breaking the law of Moses making it nonchalant the law of doesn't matter and and if he recommends stoning the woman he's breaking the Roman law bringing the Wrath of the government down on him but did the Jewish leaders really care about the law or what would or what wouldn't happen no they didn't care they just wanted to know what what would happen to this adulterous woman in the eyes of Jesus so instead of stepping into this legalistic snare that they had set before him Jesus silently Stoops down and he begins to trace in the sand and Jesus begins to scribes things in the sand and when he finally stands up he says let any one of you without sin cast the first stone and one by one the devalues let's call them that the devalues start dropping their Stones bending down again Jesus begins to write and this poor young lady stands there no doubt with tears of Shame tears of defeat tears of of a life that she probably wish she didn't have to live you know nobody wants to live that life sometimes it's out of necessity it's to feed themselves it's to put a roof over their head to have shelter and I'm not justifying not making it right but I'm telling you the truth nobody wants to live that kind of life and here she stands through tears of of of Anguish and Jesus is describing I am forgiveness I am peace I am hope you are loved fear is a liar behold I make all things new you see while the Pharisees was writing her off Jesus was writing her in how each one of us could have had our lives written off by the lives we were living by the lives that we lived the the the horrible things we've done in our past but Jesus didn't write us out he didn't put a big X on our life he said the Lamb's Book of Life your name is written and it cannot be erased Jesus cared about her most pressing need about the pain in her life and he looked at her and he says woman where are those accusers woman and when we hear that we think man he was fussing at her he was fussing at her he's demeaning to her he's belittling her woman but when he said that when he said woman he wasn't devaluing her he was adding value to her name when he said woman it's the very same word that he used towards his mother when Jesus and the and the disciples and and his mother Mary were at the wedding they run out of wine didn't they and she come to him and she said Jesus I know you've never done anything before anybody but I know how special you are I know what you're capable of Jesus I know that you can turn a bad situation of mockery and shame yeah because if they run out of wine they G to be ridiculed I know you can fix this situation Jesus and Jesus looked at her and he said what woman woman and when we look at this we would immediately think man he's rude to his mother he he's impolite how many of you would knock your kids teeth out if they looked at your wife and said woman what do you think you're doing sister Becky said ain't nobody going to do it for me I'll do it myself so we naturally think that that is derogatory that's impolite and it's rude but that's not the case it was an idiom you know what an idiom is an idiom is when you take a word and you say it but it may the opposite like if I said look out heads up what does that mean duck in this very word when we look at the native part of it we look at the word in the scripture Jesus is is saying woman it's not rude but what he is actually saying when he addresses the woman called in adultery and he says woman what he is saying is ma'am ma'am you don't have have no accusers ma'am you don't have nothing to hang your head about ma'am I have forgiven you for all that you've done wrong ma'am you're one of mine go and sin no more one by one all the accusers had left their Stones you see brothers and sister sisters how I perceive others will determine how I behave towards others and how I behave towards others will determine how they see me let that sink in take notes if you're taking notes write that one down I was at this conference and this gentleman that I come in contact with and become friends with and we were standing there and course it's thousands of people and we're standing there and we're we're just kind of he said you know Brad he said have you ever looked at somebody and you had a preconceived notion about how they were before you talk to them and then when you talk to them you find out they're nothing like you thought they would be I said yeah that's good I'm gonna write that one down because that's what we do and that's what happens we can look at somebody we look at the way they're dressed we look at the way their their their their hair is their makeup is their their garments are and we think man I know what kind of Critter this is and then you might talk to them and they may just be as kind and friendly but they just never met Jesus and we're worried about getting them in the message I just want them to get to Jesus the rest will take care of itself there's a story maybe some of you heard it I heard it for the first time and it stood out to me I thought it's good I'm going to use this you know John Maxwell said it ain't plagiarism he said you use whatever I got it ain't plagiarism use whatever I got he said because as you're using it I'm writing more content he said I don't need it anymore anyway I've done used it he said what you do is you go up there and you say John Maxwell said this this this he said' then the next time you go up there you say a man once said this this and this' he said the third time you use it you say well you know I was thinking some of you got it but a man fell into a pit and couldn't get himself out how many's ever heard this you've heard this story Tommy everybody's heard it raise your hand if you ever if everybody's heard it I'm done a man fell into a pit and couldn't get himself out and a subjective person person came along and he looked down in the pit and he said I feel for you down there and an objective man came along and he said it's logical that someone would fall down there he said a Christian

everybody sure yep one more time sure yep Jesus did when they disagreed with him go ahead he said sure we go to another church that disagrees with you I'm not the only pebble on the beach there's just other Godly men everywhere I just hope I'm one of them we don't hear this quote a whole lot do we huh he said I was called in on something the other day this group in Arizona called my attention and they were talking I'm going to paraphrase some of this he basically they were talking about uh that that brother Brandon was was hard on the assemblies and this that and the other and the Assemblies of God and he said you know he said that we can't get we can't get your people to come to our church because you're so hard on the Assemblies of God he said no he said they're welcome to go to the church they're welcome to go to your church and he said and they put he said but you put pressure on them to join he said you don't have to join them you don't have to join them he said but put your kids in Sunday school somewhere and you go to church don't sit at home go go fishing and hunting and things like that on Sunday you say well I'm not a legalist well you'd better be in that manner for a while he said dishonoring the resurrection of Christ you go to church somewhere and he said I went to a certain church and uh that I know that there's only one thing of them that I ever said that they ever said that I believed they said they believed Jesus was the son of God that's the only thing they ever said that he believed yeah he said I I went there and he said and maybe you say that this church maybe the next church will be something like the Baptist they say yeah I believe you have to have an experience I can go to church with them on that that's what he said he said yeah he said then they then they believe Jesus is the son of God and that you have to have an experience all right he said now I can eat three or four slices of bread with them see they believe he said like the other day this same person called up want to know this that and the other this Minister down there and he said well brother brandom he said you're against Assemblies of God and and and what if Assembly of God preacher picks up this tape and he said I want to tell you I never said I was against the Assemblies of God he wasn't against any of these no he said listen to this he said actually I never was a against the Assemblies of God any uh man or any other man why is that when your on headquarters admit that I have sent to you three4 of a million of the children that I've begotten to Christ did you hear what I said three4 of a million of the children that I have begotten to Christ I've sent to the Assemblies of God he didn't say tucon Tabernacle he didn't say evening light Happy Valley Word of Life full gospel I've he he he has brought in a three4 of a million souls to Christ that fellowship at the Assemblies of God he said look I have sent to the assemblies by their count

to a church home how many's ever heard me say that well sure he said would I be a hypocrite to send my own children to death far be it from me no sir if you can't go there if you can't come here at the Tabernacle get some church somewhere listen now and maybe there's a soul that's in there that ought to be saved maybe there's a soul in the grocery store that needs to be saved I'm working on this in my life because I have sat and looked at people and and I felt like somebody nudged me in a direction and say hey do you know Jesus but did I ever say it no why it's the greatest thing I've ever known so why is it so hard to reach out why is it so hard if I could come to the realization that it is so important to take the word that God has given us the gifts that God has given us the message of Salvation and just ask do you know Jesus what's the worst they can say no get out of my face you crazy guy okay it ain't the first time I've been called crazy won't be the last long as they don't throw fist cuz then I have to be working on that turn the other cheek stuff and I don't really I don't know if I'm there but he says there's such a Christian woman and a Christian couple he said I
