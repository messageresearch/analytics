[11:44] word of prayer tonight brother willie
[12:03] amen uh i
[12:07] about three weeks ago maybe even a month
[12:10] this course i woke up singing this song
[12:14] and
[12:14] i still don't know where i ever heard it
[12:16] at and of course
[12:18] me being stubborn like i do and thinking
[12:21] i could remember instead of writing it
[12:22] down
[12:24] i didn't and it two or three different
[12:26] times and janet told me of the morning
[12:27] nights was telling her about it
[12:29] while we were eating breakfast before
[12:30] she went to work and i did and
[12:32] she said why don't you just write it
[12:33] down and try to find it
[12:36] so i didn't come up very simple and it's
[12:39] called more than ever before and
[12:41] sister donna's got the words and i think
[12:43] a couple of the words are a little
[12:44] different than what we
[12:46] go ahead and put that up sister donna
[12:49] and this
[12:50] i still don't know but it just began to
[12:54] be in my heart and i just wake up
[12:57] singing this
[12:58] i didn't know if i was singing the right
[12:59] words to it or not
[13:01] [Music]
[13:03] and it just began to just keep on
[13:07] and on and on and on and on
[13:11] i don't know how many times i've
[13:12] listened to it i've sung it
[13:14] since i've got the words and it says
[13:18] more than ever before lord i love you
[13:22] more than ever before lord i need you
[13:26] and more than ever before i want to tell
[13:29] you dear lord

[13:38] i said lord i love you
[13:42] i thank you for your goodness i don't
[13:44] know about you but
[13:45] if there's one thing that excites me of
[13:47] the morning
[13:49] is when a song
[13:53] burns in my heart something from the
[13:55] lord burns in my heart soon as i wake up
[13:58] i know i may not have the best day but i
[14:01] know
[14:03] there's just something that just it just
[14:05] stirs my heart to know
[14:07] that he speaks to me as soon as i wake
[14:09] up
[14:10] because he wants me to talk to him it
[14:13] may not mean nothing to you but it means
[14:15] the world to me

[14:18] could tonight oh

[39:54] and perhaps releasing of that pressure
[39:57] amen but the main thing i want to dwell
[40:00] on for a little while
[40:01] is going to be and i guess
[40:04] where my thought originated from
[40:07] the way i started on this thought with
[40:10] the quote that i remember but i've been
[40:11] making and how that he said that jesus
[40:14] was never
[40:15] in a hurry amen
[40:19] he was never in a hurry
[40:22] so i began to think about that jesus was
[40:24] never in a hurry
[40:25] so i began to look up a few quotes and
[40:29] the different things that he said about
[40:30] that
[40:32] and so brother bannon makes a statement
[40:36] he says we're the only one
[40:39] in a hurry he says god is never
[40:43] in a hurry he let the hebrew children
[40:48] walk into the fiery furnace before he
[40:50] done anything about
[40:52] it amen i believe
[40:55] um there is a plaque probably some of
[40:58] you all might have it in your kitchen
[41:01] i don't know but i've seen it before he
[41:03] says you know if it wasn't for the last
[41:05] minute i wouldn't get nothing done
[41:08] now right how many is kind of like that
[41:10] you know we always
[41:11] wait for the last minute and then we
[41:14] just have to hurry and rush
[41:17] and so you know and the one thing i want
[41:20] to talk about is talks about redeeming
[41:21] or bringing back to time
[41:23] taking back time and i think every one
[41:25] of us probably
[41:27] are very familiar with the statement we
[41:29] probably make it a lot of times and
[41:31] that is this one thing that we don't
[41:33] have
[41:34] a lot of times we don't have it and that
[41:37] is
[41:37] i don't have time right i just got i
[41:40] don't have any time
[41:41] how many is that way in your life you
[41:43] just you're out of time you know i i
[41:45] don't have time for that
[41:47] i don't have time for this you know your
[41:48] time is all taken up
[41:51] you know and so it's a very
[41:54] busy very very busy time that we're
[41:57] living in
[41:58] and so we want to talk about the
[42:00] consequences the results
[42:02] of not having time and that
[42:05] and being in a hurry we know
[42:08] [Music]
[42:09] that time has seems to have
[42:14] sped up i guess if sped up it's a word
[42:17] uh it's it has speeded up or sped up
[42:20] amen and so uh you know because you used
[42:23] to and i will never forget especially
[42:25] where i come from
[42:26] you know because we take a day and we
[42:28] load up a box wag in the corn and
[42:31] we'd harness the horses and what our day
[42:33] would pretty much consist
[42:35] of is going about a mile with a load of
[42:37] corn
[42:38] maybe a few bags of wheat and different
[42:40] things going down the feed mill and have
[42:42] that all
[42:42] shelled you know because we had they'd
[42:44] have to shell that corn for us because
[42:46] it was on the cob because that's the way
[42:48] we did it we
[42:49] didn't have a way to shell it and the
[42:50] whole day consisted of us
[42:52] just going and getting a load of grain
[42:55] for the animals you know
[42:57] and other things a lot of things you'd
[42:59] do and it would take the whole day you
[43:01] know and so
[43:02] uh you know because they were not in a
[43:05] hurry we used to not be in a hurry
[43:07] amen and brother brahm says a lot about
[43:11] this
[43:12] he talks about you know we used to visit
[43:13] the neighbor and
[43:15] and help somebody out but we don't have
[43:17] time for that anymore
[43:19] people don't take that time anymore and
[43:21] they're right so
[43:23] uh you know and we realized that it's
[43:25] just time is a precious thing
[43:28] but let me talk about this for just a
[43:29] few minutes god is never in a hurry
[43:32] and we think about several different
[43:34] things that god is not
[43:36] even at this present time i thought
[43:38] about
[43:39] noah before we talked to praise about
[43:42] the present time let's talk about noah
[43:43] back way back in the day
[43:45] you know how that after he uh called
[43:47] noah how that
[43:49] he was not in a hurry about destroying
[43:52] the world
[43:54] how many knows that after he made the
[43:56] announcement of
[43:57] noah to build that ark you know it took
[44:00] him a hundred
[44:01] and twenty years how many knows i mean a
[44:04] lot of people maybe if they lived a
[44:06] hundred years it'd still live out their
[44:07] life and never see it
[44:10] you know and so i guess maybe in that
[44:12] hour they may have lived
[44:14] longer than that if i'm not wrong
[44:17] it was i'm thinking that it was perhaps
[44:20] after the flood if i'm not wrong
[44:22] uh that the life spans begin to dwindle
[44:26] a lot you know
[44:27] before that we realized methuselah and a
[44:29] lot of those up to
[44:30] noah enoch and those they live many
[44:33] hundred years so
[44:35] but anyway so we see how god was really
[44:38] not in a hurry he took his time
[44:40] and so we look even in our day and i was
[44:42] thinking today
[44:44] aiming out there as i was just thinking
[44:46] on the lord i thought you know lord here
[44:47] here we are expecting the coming of the
[44:50] lord and it's already
[44:51] since the departing of the prophet of
[44:53] god it's been around 55 years
[44:56] that's a long time you know because how
[44:58] many know that brother branham expected
[45:00] at any time and
[45:01] you read souls in prison now and he was
[45:04] talking about it could possibly be that
[45:06] we're in that time era
[45:08] where there is no more mercy anymore
[45:11] he even looked at it that way could it
[45:13] possibly be
[45:14] and it you know it scared the people to
[45:16] death i mean the altars were full
[45:19] right because they thought well i don't
[45:20] want to miss it and i want to be right
[45:22] you know if this is the time
[45:23] you know where he's actually preaching
[45:25] to the total lost
[45:27] and so it was that close but it ran a
[45:28] man in the moses imagine you look at it
[45:30] news
[45:31] talking about how close the coming of
[45:32] the lord is here we are
[45:34] 55 years later you know and i was just i
[45:36] guess three years old
[45:38] two three about three years old whenever
[45:40] brother band passed away so i'm glad
[45:42] that the lord didn't come before or
[45:44] or perhaps as a baby i went on to heaven
[45:46] but you know
[45:47] you know i still uh you know we got to
[45:49] live and we got to
[45:51] experience the salvation of the lord and
[45:53] and you look at the thousands and the
[45:55] millions that's come in through
[45:57] africa and all the different places and
[45:59] the things that's been done
[46:00] since then and then i begin to wonder
[46:02] well you know uh
[46:04] it was 120 years for noah before the
[46:07] whole world
[46:08] was destroyed and we know that this is
[46:10] even more
[46:11] cataclysmic than his time was because
[46:14] it's not just going to bring water upon
[46:17] the earth but it's going to
[46:18] bring volcanoes and eruptions and it's
[46:20] going to change the whole surface of the
[46:22] earth
[46:23] it's going to bring in the millennium
[46:24] we're not just changing a little bit
[46:26] here
[46:26] it's a complete renovation of the earth
[46:30] so you know i thought well i don't know
[46:32] just how long it will go how many of
[46:33] them says you know it might be ten years
[46:35] might be five years might be a hundred
[46:37] years he says
[46:38] nobody knows you don't know
[46:41] we don't know just how long it'll be but
[46:43] you do we can't see the signs of the
[46:45] times and
[46:46] emma and i were thinking today of how
[46:48] that when you look at the signs of the
[46:49] times and where we're at and
[46:51] and i thought of our own government you
[46:53] know the way they're operating
[46:55] it's almost like watching a completely
[46:57] drunk man trying to walk down the street
[46:59] and keep his people keep saying enough
[47:01] you know have y'all ever seen a real
[47:04] drunk person you know
[47:05] and just all of a sudden better they
[47:06] have to fall over into the bush
[47:10] and that's what our our government is
[47:13] acting like right now and that right
[47:14] they're
[47:15] staggering trying to stay up you know
[47:17] trying to stay on two feet
[47:18] you know just staggering around like a
[47:20] drunk person
[47:22] the whole system why because it's fixing
[47:24] the fall
[47:26] isn't the right so you know we know the
[47:28] fall is coming but that's where the
[47:30] world is the world is like that and it's
[47:32] a terrible place
[47:34] but okay so let's go on so we think
[47:36] about that think about knowing how that
[47:37] he took that long he was in no hurry he
[47:40] was no worry for the three hebrew
[47:41] children
[47:42] a lot of times i believe it was in
[47:44] brother branham's message
[47:48] called be certain of god where brother
[47:50] braham says you know sometimes
[47:52] we pray for things and we undercover
[47:54] every closet and we
[47:55] get all the skeletons out of our club we
[47:57] try to make everything right that we
[47:59] know of to make right
[48:00] we want god to answer a prayer and it
[48:02] just seems like god doesn't answer and
[48:05] you don't answer and you don't
[48:06] ask you know what i said go back and
[48:08] listen to the tape you know
[48:09] and he says you know it's he talks about
[48:12] how to
[48:12] you know he just goes on so long and and
[48:15] we wonder well is god going to
[48:17] god even there or whatever and better
[48:18] bam says you know god is just testing
[48:20] your faith
[48:23] he's just testing your faith god's that
[48:25] way don't get enough let me just say
[48:26] this
[48:27] don't get in a hurry with god or you're
[48:30] going to be disappointed
[48:34] many things he says about getting in too
[48:36] much of a hurry how did the people
[48:38] get too much of a hurry they missed
[48:39] theirs they mis
[48:43] they're healing they miss all kinds of
[48:44] things we get to get too much of a rush
[48:48] they get in too much of a hurry and i
[48:50] believe that's where the world is that's
[48:52] where
[48:52] i believe a lot of christians are and i
[48:54] hope those listening to the tape tonight
[48:56] in this evening like that
[48:58] but hear this that that's probably where
[49:00] we're at and i hope this message
[49:02] will get to every one of us amen and
[49:04] because i want to talk about
[49:06] being in too much of a rush and the
[49:07] consequences of it
[49:09] amen and so we got to redeem the time we
[49:12] got to bring back some of the time
[49:15] amen that causes us not to be what we're
[49:18] supposed to be
[49:19] and that's where the devil wants us to
[49:21] be where we're not supposed to be or
[49:22] shouldn't
[49:24] be because we don't have time for the
[49:27] right thing and that's why i read that
[49:28] about
[49:29] amen jesus even say you know they came
[49:32] again
[49:33] and he said jesus you came for that he
[49:35] says but don't
[49:36] labor so much for the good fish and the
[49:38] good steaks and the ribeye don't labor
[49:40] so much for that
[49:42] but labor for god isn't that right labor
[49:45] for the meat that does not
[49:47] perish labor for the meat
[49:50] that spend time for the things that
[49:53] are eternal because sooner or later the
[49:56] one thing that
[49:57] is for sure for you and me and for
[49:59] everybody it means that as
[50:01] time is coming when our time is going to
[50:05] end
[50:05] just as it has all generations before us
[50:10] and the only thing that's going to
[50:12] matter is how you lived your life for
[50:14] the lord
[50:14] only what's done for christ will last
[50:18] but we can get so busy and so fast
[50:21] and even better bam talking about
[50:23] preaching and i have learned in the
[50:24] pulpit that
[50:25] you know i used to try to preach 50 000
[50:28] miles an hour but i read
[50:30] you know and even better brandon i read
[50:32] today he says you know i was listening
[50:34] to myself on tape and he says you know i
[50:36] was in such a rush i hurried
[50:37] and it wasn't so much i didn't like what
[50:39] i was saying but it was the way that i
[50:40] was saying it
[50:42] and sometimes you have to just slow down
[50:45] slow yourself down calm down
[50:49] amen and let the holy spirit have his
[50:52] way because god's not in a hurry
[50:55] amen he wasn't in a hurry for daniel
[50:58] he wasn't in a hurry for three hebrew
[51:00] children amen
[51:02] and many times for abraham he wasn't
[51:04] even in a hurry
[51:05] it was 25 years after he made him the
[51:08] promise that it actually come to pass
[51:10] it was a very long time many people many
[51:14] people come to the altar hello
[51:16] and if it didn't happen by the next
[51:17] morning or the next day they then lost
[51:19] their faith and that's why they lost
[51:21] their faith is because
[51:22] they didn't have in the first place they
[51:24] thought it would expect immediately it
[51:26] would happen now god can do it
[51:27] immediately i'm gonna know that
[51:29] but also sometimes it takes time just
[51:31] like the two women brother ben i mean
[51:32] talking about
[51:33] hurrying and don't be in such a rush he
[51:35] talks about the two women
[51:36] if you remember that were prayed for and
[51:38] pronounced a blessing upon
[51:40] is that right um
[51:44] brother ben says sometimes when a
[51:45] blessing is pronounced
[51:47] it's pronounced upon you he says it has
[51:50] to happen
[51:51] but we're the one in a hurry and that's
[51:53] why i picked that up amen and
[51:55] that blessing was pronounced upon those
[51:57] two sisters and
[51:58] you know it was several weeks later i
[51:59] could have been mine but it was several
[52:01] weeks later
[52:02] and forgive me for not being sure here
[52:04] but i'm thinking they came back to
[52:06] brother venom
[52:07] and wondered about it and they said just
[52:09] keep your faith just keep believing is
[52:11] that right
[52:11] so they went back and they just kept
[52:13] believing and sure enough one morning
[52:16] the one sister sitting in her kitchen or
[52:18] being in her kitchen began to feel this
[52:20] strange feeling coming over isn't that
[52:21] right
[52:22] and uh stomach problem amen that hurt
[52:25] and everything began to go away
[52:26] and then it was completely left and she
[52:29] went and she made her some coffee made
[52:30] her some eggs made some toast began to
[52:32] eat it
[52:33] and she was perfect to find it by the
[52:34] time she got down to her neighbor
[52:36] and then she was looking for that thing
[52:38] i was on her throat in the sheets and
[52:39] they're right she couldn't find it it
[52:40] was all gone
[52:42] because that angel came by but it took
[52:44] time for it to happen
[52:46] how many believes that if you really
[52:48] believe it with all of your heart just
[52:49] give it time
[52:51] gotta get around to it he's not in a
[52:53] hurry he's in eternity
[52:56] amen and you and i are looking for the
[52:59] time
[53:00] amen when we'll be in the place that our
[53:02] loved ones are at because we know but
[53:04] says there's no yesterday there's no
[53:06] tomorrow
[53:07] isn't that right there's no past the
[53:09] future you're just in the present
[53:11] you're not in time at all that's what
[53:14] we're looking for
[53:16] all right so let's look at a couple of
[53:18] results
[53:19] i mean of not having time
[53:23] and getting in a hurry
[53:26] all right now brother bam says scenes
[53:30] change and we notice that people
[53:33] change all right
[53:36] now how many knows that uh if you aren't
[53:39] careful if you are at your best
[53:43] that you know of that you've been as a
[53:46] christian
[53:47] okay you're friendly to everybody you
[53:51] love everybody
[53:53] amen because people aren't even friendly
[53:55] anymore you know right
[53:56] people don't have time to be friendly
[53:59] people don't smile
[54:00] people don't have joy anymore why
[54:03] suburban says people change
[54:06] amen so whatever god gives you something
[54:09] or brings you to a place
[54:10] i mean it's the devil's place to change
[54:13] you from what you ought to be
[54:17] it's a good thing for every one of us to
[54:19] ask ourselves tonight
[54:21] are you what you used to be or have you
[54:24] gotten worse
[54:25] now if you've gotten better that's
[54:27] that's just great but if you got
[54:29] worse then it's you've gone the wrong
[54:31] way you've changed like brother brown
[54:33] says that you have
[54:35] people change and it's god so that the
[54:38] people
[54:38] are not even friendly like they used to
[54:41] be
[54:44] amen
[54:47] i don't know whether you notice it or
[54:49] not here or not
[54:51] but we sure notice it back in the south
[54:53] and in the east
[54:54] people are changing year by
[54:58] year then he says the very next
[55:01] statement he says
[55:02] they're in too much they're too much of
[55:05] a hurry
[55:08] too much of a hurry
[55:13] people ain't got a time to look at the
[55:15] other car going down the road see who it
[55:17] was or think about waving not
[55:18] today got time for that gotta hurry up
[55:20] to where we're going right
[55:22] people don't wave they're not friendly
[55:24] at the store passing people how many
[55:26] knows
[55:27] you know it's gotten to where i probably
[55:29] a lot of times don't do it i just walk
[55:30] right on
[55:32] but people don't like eye contact
[55:33] anymore they're not they're not friendly
[55:34] they just you know
[55:37] it's sad in it they've changed
[55:41] now notice he says they are just got to
[55:44] hurry
[55:44] up and get this done and that done he
[55:48] says it's change oh they're in a hurry
[55:51] where are they going and then he says if
[55:53] you'll notice that most women today
[55:58] most of the women today was has washing
[56:00] machines and electric ironers and
[56:03] push-button dishwashers
[56:05] and everything like that and yet they
[56:07] got less
[56:08] time to pray than they've ever had
[56:14] all right let me ask everybody out there
[56:16] a question
[56:18] how many how much time did you take this
[56:21] week
[56:22] how many chapters in the bible did you
[56:25] read
[56:28] ask yourself that if you didn't
[56:31] it's because you didn't take time to do
[56:34] it maybe you thought you didn't have
[56:36] time
[56:38] amen that's what how many knows it's
[56:41] easy
[56:41] to get away from do you think the
[56:44] important things
[56:46] how many because it's important so he
[56:48] says last time the prayer that they ever
[56:50] did susan wesley had 17
[56:53] children packing the water
[56:56] from us bringing washing on her hands
[56:59] and yet she could find
[57:00] two or three hours a day to pray with
[57:03] her children and out there came with
[57:05] john and a charles
[57:06] wesley that right she had time
[57:10] to raise him right how many knows that
[57:12] we don't the women anymore don't have
[57:14] time
[57:14] to raise their children they got to go
[57:16] off and work
[57:17] because they're under so much stress
[57:20] they're under so much pressure
[57:22] there's so much to be done it's so hard
[57:24] to keep up with everything
[57:26] it's very hard for a man that doesn't
[57:29] have a very good paying job
[57:30] to make a house payment a car payment
[57:32] the insurance or not at all
[57:34] and to keep it all up it's pretty hard
[57:37] isn't that right and so as brother brahm
[57:40] says
[57:41] most of them are out there in the
[57:42] workforces and so forth amen and not
[57:45] taken
[57:45] at home taking the children all right so
[57:48] he says
[57:49] and he uses her for an example that she
[57:51] what she still
[57:53] redeemed some time
[57:57] like i said and even brother batman says
[57:59] you know the horse and muggy days people
[58:00] had a lot more time back there than
[58:02] today
[58:03] look at the brother bam says people are
[58:05] are racing down the streets at
[58:07] breakneck next
[58:11] speeds anymore chris you know you
[58:14] the only kind that's down in the streets
[58:17] down there is the quicken the dead
[58:23] if you aren't quick you're another word
[58:26] it's dangerous
[58:31] it's dangerous to be safe
[58:34] not that you shouldn't you should and
[58:37] that right but he was just giving an
[58:39] illustration
[58:40] of the pace that people are running full
[58:43] speed amen
[58:47] all right people are running at full
[58:49] speed they don't have time
[58:52] anymore for god
[58:55] to slow down to rest
[58:59] and one of the things that made me think
[59:01] of this is that you know god made us
[59:04] to rest a little not to be
[59:08] under too much pressure not to be
[59:11] too stressed we weren't made to be that
[59:14] way
[59:15] he even in the old testament you know
[59:17] they were supposed to drop
[59:18] all of their work don't do nothing on
[59:20] the sabbath now right rest
[59:23] get some rest how many knows it really
[59:25] does you good to get some rest
[59:30] even and brother ma'am says sometimes in
[59:32] his own life he said you know that
[59:33] he would take off for what sometimes
[59:35] he'd say a month or two
[59:37] six weeks he would go squirrel hunting
[59:39] and just get away and he would just
[59:40] rest not have a bunch of meetings just
[59:43] rest
[59:44] is that right even he would get away in
[59:47] wrestling he says the scripture
[59:48] the scripture for it is what he even
[59:51] jesus said let us go aside into the
[59:53] mountain for a while
[59:54] in other words let's go rest for a while
[59:57] amen
[59:58] because people don't rest because people
[1:00:00] don't take a break
[1:00:02] and release the stress it brings them
[1:00:05] into a neurotic condition
[1:00:07] it makes people nervous i mean those
[1:00:10] pressure
[1:00:11] makes you nervous stress makes you
[1:00:14] nervous
[1:00:15] responsibility makes you nervous
[1:00:18] why it puts a load on you and people are
[1:00:21] getting completely strikes out
[1:00:24] until brother bam he makes the statement
[1:00:26] he says that we're living
[1:00:27] in a neurotic age
[1:00:31] a neurotic age that we're living in
[1:00:33] nervous
[1:00:34] tension everybody's racing here and
[1:00:38] going there and yet
[1:00:39] going nowhere it's just that kind of age
[1:00:44] amen he says and i know this church is
[1:00:48] plagued with it
[1:00:49] everybody's plagued with it the
[1:00:51] tabernacle's pl
[1:00:53] with the whole world he says it's a day
[1:00:57] of
[1:00:57] pressure stress then says everything's
[1:01:01] hurry hurry hurry hurry
[1:01:03] hurry up
[1:01:06] amen that's right
[1:01:10] that's everything and in that rushing
[1:01:12] brother bam says
[1:01:14] it's the time we're living he says
[1:01:18] and in that rushing and speeding it
[1:01:21] gets you to a nervous tension amen
[1:01:25] amen when you are rushed when you have
[1:01:27] to hurry like brother man says jesus
[1:01:29] never was god ain't no worry when you
[1:01:31] get
[1:01:32] in too much of a hurry it causes you to
[1:01:34] be stressed out
[1:01:38] when you get stressed out brother bam
[1:01:40] says that you get nervous
[1:01:42] and you'll be under pressure and a wife
[1:01:45] will say something a little contrary and
[1:01:48] boy you'll fly off
[1:01:49] he says it'll bring temper. how many
[1:01:53] know that when you're stressed out
[1:01:54] that's when it's easy to get impatient
[1:01:59] i'm still learning it amen that
[1:02:02] whenever something happens and so forth
[1:02:04] i'm trying to make a goal
[1:02:06] it's so easy to get stressed out in a
[1:02:08] temporary
[1:02:09] and you got to look at it you got to
[1:02:10] think of it in a different way
[1:02:13] you got to be patient
[1:02:16] but people fly off husbands say
[1:02:19] something and boy i'll tell you what
[1:02:20] there he goes
[1:02:21] amen wife oh i'm so nervous see
[1:02:25] what's the matter all of this together
[1:02:28] but abram says
[1:02:29] detention building up
[1:02:34] all right it builds tension up then the
[1:02:37] results of it
[1:02:38] is doing something wrong and acting
[1:02:42] out of place
[1:02:47] how many believes it that when you don't
[1:02:49] have time to pray
[1:02:52] and all people brother bob says you know
[1:02:54] people get
[1:02:56] so stressed out and even the
[1:02:57] psychiatrists are stressed out
[1:03:00] until they have to have psychiatrists
[1:03:01] for them
[1:03:03] and people get stressed out and they'll
[1:03:05] go to the beer joints and try to drink
[1:03:07] it off and this makes it worse people
[1:03:08] will do drugs and everything else
[1:03:10] to try to release some of this stress
[1:03:13] because they don't have time
[1:03:17] because why they've got their schedules
[1:03:19] so full
[1:03:20] they don't have any time
[1:03:25] they ain't got time to release the
[1:03:26] pressure in the way that they're
[1:03:27] supposed to release it
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:33] the results is that people act out of
[1:03:36] place
[1:03:38] they snap at each other and that right
[1:03:40] you get snappy
[1:03:41] you get short
[1:03:45] you get nervous stressed how many knows
[1:03:48] that's not how jesus needs you to be
[1:03:51] jesus don't need you stressed out he
[1:03:54] don't eat new snappy and short and
[1:03:57] temporary that's not how god wants you
[1:03:59] to be
[1:03:59] he wants you to be in peace and calm
[1:04:06] that's how i want you to be
[1:04:10] that's how christians live live in peace
[1:04:14] let the peace of god rule in your heart
[1:04:19] amen but no the devil's got the world
[1:04:23] so busy
[1:04:27] until they don't have no time there
[1:04:29] stresses them out
[1:04:30] too much responsibility and listen to
[1:04:33] what he says
[1:04:35] that's right people acting out of place
[1:04:39] now it'll make the poor act that way
[1:04:43] huh you know and it's usually let me say
[1:04:46] this and i truly believe that
[1:04:48] a lot of the stress and a lot of the
[1:04:50] problems comes from poor people is
[1:04:52] because they don't have anything they
[1:04:53] want stuff and
[1:04:55] man they are some of the fightness folks
[1:04:58] yeah there's some of the unhappiest
[1:05:00] people in the world as poor people
[1:05:02] because they don't have anything but
[1:05:04] listen so it'll make them act that way
[1:05:07] it'll make poor people act that way and
[1:05:09] it'll make the middle class
[1:05:11] act that way amen
[1:05:14] and you know you can
[1:05:17] just thank the lord that you don't have
[1:05:20] too much stress because
[1:05:22] i don't believe any human being was
[1:05:24] meant to take too much stress
[1:05:27] brother keith was telling me a story one
[1:05:29] time of a husband that just
[1:05:31] really was mean to her
[1:05:34] his wife a tree half naked whooper and
[1:05:38] everything else in the cold
[1:05:40] huh just treated her
[1:05:43] terribly
[1:05:48] and one day the cops had to show up at
[1:05:50] the house
[1:05:51] because the man had an ax buried in his
[1:05:53] head
[1:05:56] she killed him she couldn't take it no
[1:05:58] more
[1:05:59] right pressure stress human beings can
[1:06:03] only take so much
[1:06:07] amen we weren't meant to be under that
[1:06:10] kind of stress
[1:06:12] amen not under too much pressure now how
[1:06:14] many knows brother bam says god loves to
[1:06:16] put us under pressure
[1:06:17] but i'll tell you what whenever you
[1:06:19] learn how to
[1:06:20] use that how to set your wings in the
[1:06:23] wind of the trials that come your way
[1:06:26] you can have a smile in the midst of
[1:06:28] your trials
[1:06:30] but listen brother brown directly con
[1:06:32] connects
[1:06:33] the hurry hurry no time type of
[1:06:37] thing and it says that this is the
[1:06:39] results that it gets these people get
[1:06:41] snappy people
[1:06:42] can snap at each other they fuss they
[1:06:44] fight
[1:06:45] because they're nervous they're stressed
[1:06:47] out that's not the way that a christian
[1:06:49] home is supposed to be
[1:06:51] that right that's right amen
[1:06:55] let me just say this it comes to my mind
[1:06:57] is it all right
[1:07:01] we haven't learned anything as a husband
[1:07:03] and a wife
[1:07:05] if we haven't learned that if your
[1:07:06] husband is upset
[1:07:09] it's not going to make it any better for
[1:07:11] you to get upset
[1:07:14] or if your wife is upset
[1:07:17] it isn't going to do any good for you to
[1:07:19] get upset
[1:07:24] one can i have a witness that's right
[1:07:28] what happens it just clashes it just
[1:07:31] boils up
[1:07:32] you know sure you both make up because
[1:07:35] you know that's why there's so many
[1:07:36] divorces you know
[1:07:38] and that's what i would want to ask
[1:07:40] every young person that ever gets mad
[1:07:41] hey you realize you're going to clash
[1:07:43] sooner or later
[1:07:45] you're going to have your fights you're
[1:07:47] going to want to divorce her
[1:07:49] she's going to want to divorce you i
[1:07:52] really hate you
[1:07:52] you might get to that place most likely
[1:07:54] your marriage sooner or later get to
[1:07:55] that place
[1:07:57] but you got to ask yourself if you're
[1:07:59] really
[1:08:00] a christian hello if you really love god
[1:08:04] what are you going to do then because
[1:08:07] that's when you got to stick together
[1:08:09] that's when you gotta as the husband
[1:08:12] say i'm sorry honey that i got so mad
[1:08:15] i'm sorry
[1:08:16] i got upset or as a wife i'm sorry
[1:08:19] you gotta make up because i'd love to
[1:08:22] tell you hey marriage and all of that is
[1:08:23] so
[1:08:24] hunky-dory that you never have to face
[1:08:26] any of that
[1:08:27] but that be lying to you amen
[1:08:32] amen and the sooner that everybody
[1:08:35] learns that hey
[1:08:36] if the other one is upset and stressed
[1:08:38] you need to do what the prophet did when
[1:08:40] his wife was stressed out
[1:08:42] under so much pressure amen and the kids
[1:08:44] were screaming and everything else you
[1:08:46] know and she didn't have food cooked
[1:08:47] isn't that right the house was all dirty
[1:08:50] now what would have to down if brother
[1:08:51] bannon went in there and said do you
[1:08:53] mean you haven't had supper for me and
[1:08:54] this out of the other
[1:08:56] huh but no he had dealt with it in the
[1:08:59] right way
[1:09:00] it changes your whole life like i said
[1:09:04] it was just a thought that comes to my
[1:09:05] mind i hope that'll help somebody
[1:09:06] somewhere along the way
[1:09:09] all right so he says look
[1:09:12] it'll make the middle class that way
[1:09:15] it'll make
[1:09:16] the rich act that way when tension
[1:09:19] builds up when there's no time when
[1:09:21] you're hurrying too much
[1:09:22] it'll make the wrong people like that
[1:09:24] rat and it'll make the pretty good act
[1:09:26] that way
[1:09:27] praise pizza god i'm glad he's didn't
[1:09:29] mention the good people
[1:09:31] aren't you now it ain't gonna make the
[1:09:34] good people that way is it
[1:09:37] let me see and it'll make the good
[1:09:41] act that way
[1:09:46] too much pressure not enough time
[1:09:49] haven't been praying like you should
[1:09:51] haven't been under the sweetness of the
[1:09:54] holy spirit enough
[1:09:56] i don't care how good you are it's gonna
[1:09:58] make you act that way
[1:10:00] if you don't got time if you let tension
[1:10:02] build up that way
[1:10:04] it's going to make you act out of the
[1:10:06] way
[1:10:07] in the way that you shouldn't act amen
[1:10:11] it'll make the good act that way because
[1:10:13] it's
[1:10:14] tension it's steam
[1:10:17] built up he says it's got to blow out
[1:10:20] somewhere see if you don't

[1:12:50] on a hunting trip and i had an old
[1:12:52] indian guy
[1:12:53] and i hunt real fast he says and that
[1:12:56] stuff that's just in me
[1:12:57] and one of them pressure builders you
[1:12:59] know and i was hunting with the indian
[1:13:00] and i dumped off my horse and i was up
[1:13:02] for uh there was some elk up there in
[1:13:05] the mountain i started around the bend
[1:13:06] and the old indian was about 10 years
[1:13:08] older than me
[1:13:09] he was just a puff and coming up behind
[1:13:11] me he says come on chief
[1:13:12] come on i said he's just too fast too
[1:13:15] fast
[1:13:16] i thought well i said come on and i
[1:13:19] started and he said too fast
[1:13:21] i slowed down to the next gear too fast
[1:13:25] and i got down to a walk too fast
[1:13:29] hey man i wonder if we don't need to do
[1:13:31] that a little bit tonight
[1:13:33] too fast too fast
[1:13:36] amen slow down slow down
[1:13:40] slow down because i'm telling you right
[1:13:42] now we want to leave this place we want
[1:13:44] to get out of time completely
[1:13:46] we need to be slowing down and get our
[1:13:48] time
[1:13:49] redeem it get it back whatever it is
[1:13:52] taking all your time now i'm going to
[1:13:54] say this to everybody in church
[1:13:55] is this slight rebuke i don't mean it to
[1:13:57] any individual at all this goes for all
[1:13:59] of
[1:14:00] us but anymore it's to where we don't
[1:14:02] even hardly have time to get up on a
[1:14:04] sunday morning
[1:14:06] and to get to church in time
[1:14:09] right people come in half hour after the
[1:14:11] service started
[1:14:12] we moved it up to 10 30 10 30 in the
[1:14:14] morning uh folks
[1:14:16] you know because brother brahm said what
[1:14:17] he said we should be here about 30
[1:14:18] minutes early
[1:14:20] to what release some of the struts that
[1:14:22] we've been dealing with
[1:14:23] amen to pray to get down there quiet
[1:14:26] with the lord brother brahm says you
[1:14:27] know
[1:14:28] he don't even he goes to the office in
[1:14:30] the afternoon and he don't want nobody
[1:14:31] coming in there and
[1:14:32] serving him at all until service time
[1:14:34] why because he said the minister has to
[1:14:37] have that time away in that quiet time
[1:14:39] with the lord
[1:14:40] if he's going to come out here under the
[1:14:42] atmosphere of the holy
[1:14:44] ghost and do any good i believe that's
[1:14:47] the same way with the congregation if we
[1:14:49] come all stressed out
[1:14:50] not prayed up we're probably going to
[1:14:52] sit there not getting half of us what as
[1:14:53] much we would
[1:14:54] if we come early get up a little early
[1:14:58] amen and come a little early and try to
[1:15:00] see if we can't
[1:15:01] amen let the lord know how many of us
[1:15:03] appreciate god's what he's been doing in
[1:15:04] his services but he can do even more
[1:15:06] if you get that time bring that time
[1:15:08] back say this is my time
[1:15:10] amen too fast he says
[1:15:15] come on too fast on down to the oh just
[1:15:18] a walk
[1:15:18] oh i said chief the hell is up there
[1:15:21] and he said him staying there and
[1:15:27] praise the lord it'd be high
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:35] he's dying he's taking his last breath
[1:15:37] he called for jesus twice and
[1:15:40] he still didn't come he didn't come
[1:15:42] there
[1:15:43] doctors finally gave up the ghost
[1:15:47] huh and jesus still didn't come
[1:15:52] so slow huh it wasn't even at the
[1:15:56] funeral
[1:15:58] hey most folks would be mad
[1:16:01] you didn't even come to the funeral
[1:16:05] no but no
[1:16:08] jesus knew what he was doing he was in a
[1:16:10] hurry to get there
[1:16:14] amen as brother branham one place put to
[1:16:16] put it as god's no hurry
[1:16:18] he even let jesus die on the cross and
[1:16:20] go to hell
[1:16:22] but guess what god lifted him up out of
[1:16:24] the hill and took him on to the ramparts
[1:16:25] everything turned out all right same way
[1:16:28] with lazarus come back
[1:16:30] he was three days late or four days late
[1:16:32] it was the fourth day
[1:16:35] begin to death corruption begin to set
[1:16:38] in and he comes and visits
[1:16:39] mary and martha can you imagine but
[1:16:41] stephen
[1:16:43] if your loved one died and he was your
[1:16:45] friend your best friend and then you
[1:16:48] have here comes that master that he
[1:16:49] wouldn't come and he comes and looks you
[1:16:51] in the eye
[1:16:52] you have to see him now you have to face
[1:16:53] mary mary faces jesus
[1:16:56] and as brother brown said if it had been
[1:16:57] a pentecostal she'd probably give him a
[1:16:59] piece of her mind
[1:17:00] all that stress and pressure would have
[1:17:02] caused it to blow but jesus brother
[1:17:04] brown said
[1:17:05] no mary wasn't like that she was nice
[1:17:08] she says we know that if you'd have been
[1:17:10] here he would have not died
[1:17:13] and even now whatever you ask we know
[1:17:15] god will give it and they're right
[1:17:17] she was respectful and god had done it
[1:17:19] jesus had done it for a very special
[1:17:21] very special reason you know right he
[1:17:24] didn't do it out of meanness no he
[1:17:26] did it for our purpose because he knew
[1:17:28] the glory of god would show
[1:17:30] and man four days late he would go to
[1:17:32] the tomb and say lazarus come forth
[1:17:35] he made up for all the late is that
[1:17:38] right
[1:17:38] there he was lazarus he's well again
[1:17:42] oh my what a time what a service what a
[1:17:45] revival
[1:17:46] to see something like that but he wasn't
[1:17:49] in a hurry

[1:21:14] you have to be desperate about it you
[1:21:16] have to really need god
[1:21:18] jesus said blessed are they which do
[1:21:20] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:21:22] for they shall be filled
[1:21:24] but as long as you're satisfied with the
[1:21:26] things of the world how can god ever
[1:21:28] speak to you
[1:21:29] and you say well god never spoke to me
[1:21:32] why he wants to
[1:21:37] are you with me tonight you say god

[1:21:47] amen i believe god spoke to me what was
[1:21:50] it monday night
[1:21:52] actually it would have been tuesday
[1:21:53] morning about three o'clock in the
[1:21:55] morning
[1:21:56] is when he laid this on my heart i woke
[1:21:58] up at three o'clock
[1:22:00] and this began to go through my mind
[1:22:03] about jesus never been in a hurry
[1:22:05] about the sabbath about needing rest
[1:22:08] about
[1:22:09] all the stress and so forth and begin to
[1:22:11] just begin to pour out
[1:22:12] i thought here it is three o'clock in
[1:22:15] the morning
[1:22:16] amen and god spoke to me
[1:22:20] laid this message on my heart
[1:22:23] his ass asses why has god not spoke to
[1:22:27] you
[1:22:28] he says you're too filled up with the
[1:22:30] things of the world
[1:22:31] that's what's the matter with us today
[1:22:33] we put all of our time
[1:22:35] on the things of the world and the
[1:22:38] pleasures of the world
[1:22:39] and give no time to god
[1:22:43] how many please that's where our problem
[1:22:44] is if god ain't speaking to you if you
[1:22:46] don't hear that still small voice
[1:22:48] amen god's speaking to you something i
[1:22:50] don't know what it is just whatever it
[1:22:51] might be
[1:22:52] amen then it's because
[1:22:55] you really don't have time to listen
[1:23:01] signs are appearing jesus is coming
[1:23:04] great wonders are being done
[1:23:08] amen i'm going to say what just comes to
[1:23:10] mind i really like what brother
[1:23:13] daniel said and i've read it myself to
[1:23:15] where brother brown says that
[1:23:16] discernment
[1:23:18] that went forth he says those things he
[1:23:21] said those things
[1:23:22] should give us rapturing faith how many
[1:23:25] believes that
[1:23:27] signs wonders and these great uh you
[1:23:29] know the prophet being on the scene
[1:23:31] desert
[1:23:31] and so forth it is absolutely should
[1:23:34] give us
[1:23:34] rapturing faith amen much could be said
[1:23:38] now notice great wonders are being done
[1:23:40] every milestone is pointing towards this
[1:23:42] soon coming
[1:23:43] and it'll happen in a moment how are you
[1:23:46] standing this morning
[1:23:47] as we take inventory we should if we
[1:23:50] should uh be spoke
[1:23:52] to this morning and the lord jesus
[1:23:54] should descend from the heavens
[1:23:56] this morning with a shout should say

[1:24:06] as an individual
[1:24:07] to join with those who are raised from
[1:24:10] the dead

[1:24:22] be ready and we must do it now it is no
[1:24:26] time to wait we must redeem the time
[1:24:31] and be ready

[1:24:55] bride home
[1:24:57] they'll be doing all of those things the
[1:24:58] things that you see now
[1:25:00] so just be ready at any time honey
