[27:13] Oh, God bless you. Let's pray.
[27:17] Our kind heavenly father, Lord God, what
[27:19] a privilege we have this morning, Lord
[27:22] God, to first of all to come into your
[27:25] presence, Lord Jesus, by the blood of
[27:26] the Lord Jesus Christ. What a privilege
[27:28] we have as children, Lord God, that we
[27:31] would find ourselves in need, Lord God.
[27:33] We have a refuge. We have a place to
[27:35] come, Lord God, and and present our
[27:37] needs, present our petitions
[27:40] and our troubles, Lord God. And we know
[27:42] you care, Lord God. And what a privilege
[27:44] it is to this morning, Lord God, to have
[27:46] health, Lord God, to have strength, Lord
[27:48] Jesus, and to come in the house of the
[27:51] Lord, Lord God, to praise you, to hear
[27:53] your word, Lord God, to glorify your
[27:55] name, Lord God, and and to show the
[27:58] devil, like that woman said, "Why you go
[28:01] up to church if you don't know how to
[28:03] read?" She said, "But I just want to go
[28:06] over there and show the devil what side
[28:07] I'm in, Lord God." So this morning, Lord
[28:09] God, we want to show the devil what I
[28:12] wear in Lord God. And I know there's
[28:15] many petitions, many requests here
[28:17] written on this pulpit, Lord God. You
[28:20] know, my personal ones, Lord God, but
[28:22] they're minor, Lord Jesus, to what I
[28:24] heard her this morning of this sister
[28:26] Margie, Lord God, that she's struggling
[28:28] with her health, Lord Jesus, and that
[28:30] float on her body and stuff, Lord God,
[28:32] that she I'm pretty sure she's calling
[28:34] upon your name. I ask you Lord God that
[28:36] you help her Lord God and this other
[28:39] family Lord Jesus that there have put a
[28:41] request Lord God upon their addiction
[28:44] and things like that that the devil can
[28:46] drive a human into it Lord God I ask you
[28:49] Lord Jesus that somehow Lord God you
[28:51] open an avenue Lord God that they can
[28:53] look up to you Father that they can know
[28:55] there is hope in your word Lord Jesus
[28:59] there's deliverance Lord Jesus and
[29:00] there's power to be obtained Lord God
[29:03] may you help that family Lord Jesus
[29:05] Jesus, may they feel that pull to look
[29:08] to you, Father. And this morning,
[29:09] whatever is being read, whatever is
[29:12] being seen. I ask you, Lord God, that
[29:14] you anoint the the Sunday school
[29:16] teacher, the the musicians, Lord God,
[29:19] and when that comes to the preaching of
[29:21] the word, Lord God, that we might be
[29:23] attentive, Lord Jesus, to hear what you
[29:26] have for us this morning, Lord God. May
[29:28] you release the pressure of any person
[29:30] that is on this building, Lord God, that
[29:32] they just forget about their life's
[29:34] travel, Lord Jesus, and they just enjoy
[29:36] in your presence, Lord God, that they
[29:38] can raise their hands. They can praise
[29:40] you, Lord God,
[29:42] knowing that you're a good father. I
[29:45] pray that you be on the rest of the
[29:48] service, Father, and this service and
[29:50] the service in the afternoon, Lord God.
[29:52] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[29:54] pray, Father. Amen.
[29:59] Amen. Let's stand this morning. Brother
[30:00] Austin, go ahead. Bible reading.
[30:10] Uh we're going to read from Psalms 103.
[30:13] And while you're turning there, I'm
[30:14] going to give a little testimony. Uh
[30:16] it'll piggy back off the uh testimony I
[30:19] gave the other night. One of the needs
[30:21] that I wrote on that piece of paper was
[30:23] that uh God would heal my knees because
[30:26] I'm 30 years old and I can't even keep
[30:27] up with John on the basketball court.
[30:29] You know, I'm like, man, I should be
[30:30] able to do whatever I want at 30. Um,
[30:33] but even riding a bike or it even got to
[30:36] the point where I'd sit like uh
[30:38] criss-cross applesauce on the floor,
[30:40] bend my right knee up, and that's the
[30:41] knee I had ACL surgery on a few years
[30:43] ago, and it would just like pop out of
[30:46] place. I couldn't feel the pain whenever
[30:48] it was whenever I was sitting. you know,
[30:50] with my knee bent, but whenever I go to
[30:51] straighten it out, it was like
[30:52] excruciating pain until I can get it to
[30:54] pop back into place. But anyway, me and
[30:57] Serenity went camping uh the end of May
[31:00] for our anniversary. And I was riding
[31:03] I was riding bikes with her and the
[31:05] girls and she's like, "How's your knees
[31:08] feeling?" And I'm like, "I didn't even
[31:10] like I didn't even think about it. There
[31:11] was no pain whatsoever." Um, and then
[31:14] since then I've sat in the floor, you
[31:15] know, with my knee bent up and it hasn't
[31:18] popped out and caused me zero pain. So,
[31:20] I just want to thank the Lord for that.
[31:22] [Applause]
[31:30] Uh, so Psalms 103, bless the Lord, oh my
[31:33] soul, and all that is within me, bless
[31:35] his holy name.
[31:41] who forgiveth all thine iniquities and
[31:44] health all thy diseases.
[31:53] Who satisfies thy mouth with good
[31:55] things, show so shalt thy youth be
[31:58] renewed like the eagles.
[32:05] He made known his ways unto Moses, his
[32:08] acts unto the children of Israel.
[32:16] He will not always chide, neither will
[32:18] he keep his anger forever.
[32:27] For as the heaven is high above the
[32:29] earth, so great is his mercy toward them
[32:31] that fear him.
[32:40] Like as a father pityth his children, so
[32:43] the Lord pityth them that fear him.
[32:50] As for man, his days are as grass as a
[32:54] flower of the field, so he flourish.
[33:03] But the mercy of the Lord is from
[33:05] everlasting to everlasting upon them
[33:07] that fear him, and his righteousness
[33:09] unto children's children.
[33:17] The Lord hath prepared his throne in the
[33:19] heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over
[33:22] all.
[33:32] Bless ye the Lord, all ye his host, ye
[33:34] ministers of his that do his pleasure.
[33:37] Bless the Lord, all his earth.
[33:42] Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[33:52] Amen.
[33:56] I thought about doing something, but I'm
[33:57] not going to. We'll just turn it over to
[33:59] brother David. Amen. How many's looking
[34:01] to worship the Lord? Amen.

[34:05] of our heart. Songs that are sung. Songs

[41:54] love you this morning. And Amen. You
[41:56] know, I
[41:59] I'm going to give the devil a black eye
[42:00] this morning. I stood back there
[42:03] Wednesday night after brother Brad
[42:04] preached and I'd hurt my elbow and I put
[42:07] a gash in it about that wide and about
[42:10] that deep and it bled and and it hit the
[42:13] funny bone and I told brother Brad I
[42:15] said I don't know where they got funny
[42:16] bone at because there's nothing funny
[42:18] about it. I was in so much pain I
[42:20] couldn't even do this.
[42:22] My granddaughter helped me Wednesday at
[42:24] work and we come to church and I stood
[42:27] back there and the devil said, 'Oh, you
[42:29] if you just believe, you'll get healed.
[42:31] And I said, 'I know I'll get healed. And
[42:34] I want to come up here and I thought,
[42:35] Lord, I'm going to go up there and I'm
[42:36] going to do what the Bible says. The
[42:38] believers will lay their hands on the
[42:40] sick and they're not going to rec. No,
[42:42] they shall recover. So this morning, so
[42:47] Thursday, I go to the chiropractor from
[42:48] my back and he gets a hold of this hand
[42:50] and he's doing this and I told him, I
[42:53] said, "Dr. Brad, you couldn't have done
[42:55] that yesterday without me crying." He
[42:57] said, "Why?" And I told him what I did.
[42:59] He said, "Really?" I said, "But you know
[43:01] who took care of me?" I said, "I went to
[43:03] Dr. Jesus and he took care of it all."
[43:09] Amen. Amen. My hope is built on nothing
[43:13] less than Jesus blood and righteousness.
[43:15] On Christ the solid rock I stand this
[43:18] morning. That's where we stand this
[43:20] morning. Well, my hope is built on.
[43:24] Nothing less than Jesus blood and
[43:30] righteousness.
[43:31] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but
[43:36] I holy lean on Jesus name.
[43:42] Well, on Christ the solid
[43:46] rock I stand, all other ground is
[43:51] sinking sand.
[43:54] Oh, all other ground is sinking sand.
[44:01] When darkness seems
[44:07] rest on his unchanging
[44:10] grace in
[44:13] I am my
[44:16] anchor holds within the
[44:22] on Christ the solid
[44:25] rock I stand all other ground is
[44:30] sinking. ing sand.
[44:34] All other ground is sinking sand.
[44:40] His oath is covered
[44:43] that his blood support me in the flood.
[44:50] All around my soul his way. He that is
[44:56] all my hope and stay.
[45:00] Oh Christ the solid
[45:04] rock I stand. All other ground is
[45:09] sinking sand.

[1:04:30] be at the lake.
[1:04:32] You could be at a ball field. You could
[1:04:33] be on a golf course. You could be at a
[1:04:36] restaurant. But you chose to be here.
[1:04:39] Amen.
[1:04:41] I mean, my goodness, you could have
[1:04:42] stayed home,
[1:04:44] but you chose
[1:04:46] to stay here. You made a choice this
[1:04:48] morning. You something something pulled
[1:04:50] you,
[1:04:52] Sister Adriana. Something pulled you,
[1:04:57] there's an inside to that, but she knows
[1:04:59] what I'm talking about. There's
[1:05:00] something pulling, Brother Tommy.
[1:05:02] Something pulls us to be here.
[1:05:04] We don't want to be at a ballpark on a
[1:05:06] Sunday morning.
[1:05:07] We want to be right here. Something's
[1:05:09] pulling at us. Something's speaking to
[1:05:10] us. Something's pulling us. And it's not
[1:05:13] by chance that we're sitting here this
[1:05:15] morning. But I do want you to know this.
[1:05:17] Every chance you've got to be here,
[1:05:19] there's an opportunity for you.
[1:05:22] There's an opportunity for you in the
[1:05:23] house of God. Because if you're here,
[1:05:25] it's not by chance. God is speaking. So
[1:05:28] pull up a chair this morning.
[1:05:30] See what God's got to say to you. Pull
[1:05:32] up a chair and have a personal
[1:05:34] interview. That's the good thing about
[1:05:35] God is you can just pull up in here and
[1:05:37] you can sit down and have a personal one
[1:05:39] onone interview
[1:05:41] with God this morning
[1:05:44] with the greatest author, songwriter,
[1:05:47] poet, architect.
[1:05:52] And and whatever question you may have
[1:05:54] on your mind this morning, he's got the
[1:05:57] answer.
[1:05:58] I didn't say it' be the answer you want,
[1:06:00] right?
[1:06:01] You may not get it today.
[1:06:02] That's right. But he's got the answer.
[1:06:06] You say, "You sure say that a lot. You
[1:06:08] sure you repeat that a lot. Do you
[1:06:10] really do you really mean that? That
[1:06:12] he's that good? I mean it with all my
[1:06:15] heart." And every day it gets sweeter
[1:06:18] and sweeter and sweeter as a day goes
[1:06:21] by. As I dig into the word, I see more
[1:06:23] and more of what God is doing for me.
[1:06:25] How he's speaking to me in my family, my
[1:06:28] home, your life.
[1:06:30] I see things happening here. And brother
[1:06:31] Ber, we talking about it. the things
[1:06:33] that God is doing. He's moving on the
[1:06:35] scene for his people in this hour.
[1:06:38] So, yes, I believe it with all my heart.
[1:06:42] How many believes that this morning?
[1:06:45] So, I'm happy you chose to be here this
[1:06:47] morning. And and it's exciting. I'm
[1:06:50] excited.
[1:06:51] So, why don't you just, you know, take
[1:06:54] this time, look at your neighbor, and
[1:06:56] say, "I'm excited to be here, and I'm
[1:06:57] glad you're here.
[1:07:03] Well, that that was pretty good.
[1:07:09] Now, you ought to do it with a smile.
[1:07:13] You know, when you smile, I I I I I kind
[1:07:16] of wrote this out or I I wrote it out,
[1:07:18] got it off the internet. You know, when
[1:07:19] you smile, something changes about you.
[1:07:22] When you smile, you focus on uh uh
[1:07:26] details in in your life. When you smile,
[1:07:29] your brain releases feel-good chemicals.
[1:07:33] When you smile, you have endorphins
[1:07:35] released.
[1:07:37] When you smile, your stress levels go
[1:07:39] down.
[1:07:40] When you smile, your blood pressure goes
[1:07:42] down.
[1:07:44] Now, look at somebody and smile at them
[1:07:46] and say, "I'm glad to have you here."
[1:07:51] Yeah. Now, that's better. That's better.
[1:07:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:57] God is certainly good to us. So,
[1:08:00] I want to go on into our part two of our
[1:08:03] series and we we're going to try not to
[1:08:05] hold you too long since we got two
[1:08:07] services and we'll just break it up. And
[1:08:09] I told Joyce, I said, I think maybe I
[1:08:11] might just see if we can just have one
[1:08:12] big long twohour service and eat dinner
[1:08:14] and go home. But then I thought, no,
[1:08:16] we're just going to break it up. So, uh
[1:08:18] break it up. Give me a little little
[1:08:20] time to to recuperate there. So, uh,
[1:08:23] we're going to continue on our thought,
[1:08:24] uh, this morning on down through the
[1:08:26] ages. This will be part two. And the
[1:08:28] subtitle would be the big reveal. The
[1:08:31] big reveal. So, and if you would turn in
[1:08:34] your book, uh, your Bible to the book of
[1:08:36] Revelation, chapter 1. Good to see
[1:08:38] everybody out this morning.
[1:08:42] While you're standing, we're going to
[1:08:44] read the word. And, you know, you little
[1:08:46] things we find out in the message here.
[1:08:48] And and I know there's times that you
[1:08:50] you can't stand physically or this that
[1:08:52] or the other, but you know, the the
[1:08:54] prophet told us the little things. You
[1:08:56] know, we always wonder why do we stand?
[1:08:57] Well, he says, well, we stand to read
[1:08:59] his word from the uh and the reason we
[1:09:01] stand is because uh what it is is we're
[1:09:06] representing
[1:09:08] God. We're acknowledging who God is. And
[1:09:12] because in the beginning, the word was
[1:09:13] God. The word was with God. The word was
[1:09:16] God. and the word was made flesh and
[1:09:17] dwelt amongst us. And listen to what he
[1:09:19] says here. He says, "Therefore, when we
[1:09:20] read his printed self,
[1:09:25] that puts it in perspective. When we
[1:09:27] read his printed self here on the pages,
[1:09:30] on the word, we stand." And he said, you
[1:09:32] know, and it made sense when he said it
[1:09:35] to me this way. We stand for the pledge
[1:09:37] of allegiance to the flag.
[1:09:39] We stand for when the flag passes by and
[1:09:42] honor the flag for our nation. then how
[1:09:45] much more should we stand when we read
[1:09:47] the word of God?
[1:09:49] And so when thinking about that, I
[1:09:51] thought, you know, sometimes people they
[1:09:53] don't want to praise, they don't want to
[1:09:54] stand, they don't want to, you know,
[1:09:56] they're they're to this to that or
[1:09:57] whatever. But let me tell you what if I
[1:09:59] were to sit here and I said, let's all
[1:10:01] stand for the pledge of allegiance.
[1:10:04] You wouldn't be caught sitting in your
[1:10:06] seat.
[1:10:10] So, we're going to take this time and we
[1:10:12] honor and re with reverence we read the
[1:10:15] word of God. So, in Revelations chapter
[1:10:17] 1, we'll we'll start right there and
[1:10:19] pick up kind of where we did last time.
[1:10:22] The revelation of Jesus Christ, which
[1:10:24] God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:10:26] servant things which must shortly come
[1:10:28] to pass. And he sent and signified it by
[1:10:31] his angel unto his servant John, who
[1:10:36] bare record of what? The word of God,
[1:10:40] and of the testimony of Jesus Christ,
[1:10:43] and of all things that he saw. Now
[1:10:46] watch. Blessed is he that readeth, and
[1:10:50] hear the words of this what? Prophecy.
[1:10:54] and keep those things which are written
[1:10:57] therein, for the time is at hand. Let's
[1:11:00] just take a moment to speak to the
[1:11:02] author of the word this morning and
[1:11:03] pray. Heavenly Father, we come before
[1:11:05] you with grateful hearts, thankful,
[1:11:06] Lord, for all that you've done for us.
[1:11:09] Thankful for the opportunity to come and
[1:11:10] and hear once again from you and as you
[1:11:13] break the bread of life, Lord Jesus. And
[1:11:15] we take it with such sincerity and
[1:11:17] humbleness this morning, Lord. And we
[1:11:19] just ask that you would just come and
[1:11:21] minister to our heart's needs and show
[1:11:23] us who we are in this hour and what what
[1:11:25] your plans are for us in this hour. And
[1:11:27] we as we take and we break open this
[1:11:29] little book in in the Bible, Lord, that
[1:11:31] that seems to comp be so complex and
[1:11:34] confound those who who've studied it
[1:11:36] out, but in simplicity, you've brought
[1:11:38] it to us in a way that we can understand
[1:11:40] it and see who we are. We thank you for
[1:11:42] that. So, break the bread of life we ask
[1:11:44] now in your precious name. In the name
[1:11:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You can
[1:11:49] be seated this morning.
[1:11:56] So,
[1:11:58] getting into this Revelations chapter 1
[1:12:04] and and if you don't have your church
[1:12:05] age book, that's fine. We're going to
[1:12:07] we're going to we're just we're just
[1:12:08] breaking into the first three or four
[1:12:10] pages right now. And so, like brother
[1:12:12] Ber said, we could go for uh many years
[1:12:15] if if we chose to. uh and was led to on
[1:12:18] this little book here. But brother
[1:12:20] Tommy's got books on the way for for
[1:12:22] those who need a book, you just get with
[1:12:24] him and he will set you one aside. So uh
[1:12:27] in the weeks to come or at future future
[1:12:29] services uh whenever they may be if the
[1:12:31] Lord leads, we'll break into those other
[1:12:33] chapters in the book. So but looking at
[1:12:36] this and reading this first few
[1:12:37] chapters, these first three verses in
[1:12:39] this first chapter, it's obvious as we
[1:12:42] look at this that this is not a history
[1:12:44] book. The book of Revelation is not a
[1:12:47] history book. It's not a story of past
[1:12:49] tense, but it is a story that that it's
[1:12:54] a book that is going to lay out the
[1:12:55] entire plan for God in a future group
[1:12:59] that in the last days right before the
[1:13:01] rapture takes place. It's going to take
[1:13:04] and it's going to take and it's going to
[1:13:05] bless the bride of Jesus Christ. That is
[1:13:08] who this book is for. It's for the
[1:13:09] blessings of Jesus Christ. That's what
[1:13:11] it says. Blessed is he that readth.
[1:13:13] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John did not
[1:13:15] read this book. Moses, Noah, all those
[1:13:18] guys did not read this book. But this is
[1:13:19] a book for the last day group of people
[1:13:22] that will hear the word of God. And so
[1:13:25] God is laying out his plan for this
[1:13:27] future group. And that the the words
[1:13:31] would then be prophecy.
[1:13:34] The book is a book of prophecy.
[1:13:37] So we have to keep that in our minds as
[1:13:39] we look at that. And as the prophet
[1:13:41] begins to introduce this most mysterious
[1:13:43] book to the to the group in this last
[1:13:46] age to the church or he later said I no
[1:13:48] longer call you church I call you bride.
[1:13:50] He began to introduce this book this
[1:13:53] book of revelations and this book as we
[1:13:55] said last time has confounded it has
[1:13:58] perplexed it has confused man after man
[1:14:01] after man because they cannot figure out
[1:14:04] what this book is trying to say. And so
[1:14:07] down through the ages, it's been twisted
[1:14:09] and misrepresented. But he then brings
[1:14:12] it out as the messenger in the last
[1:14:14] church age
[1:14:16] to a group of people who will then hear
[1:14:18] the word and hear the message for the
[1:14:21] hour that they are living in.
[1:14:23] Not a day of Calvary. That message was
[1:14:25] for us too. But this is the hour that
[1:14:28] we're living in.
[1:14:30] And so he brings it out in such a way
[1:14:32] that it is in God in simplicity.
[1:14:36] Yeah.
[1:14:36] And as I begin to look at this and I
[1:14:38] begin to think about all the messages
[1:14:40] that were preached over time down
[1:14:42] through time that the prophet preached,
[1:14:45] all of those messages begin to
[1:14:47] intertwine and line up right here.
[1:14:52] Are you with me?
[1:14:54] And so I begin to look at this and it
[1:14:55] makes it come down in such a way that we
[1:14:58] can see it.
[1:15:00] Yeah.
[1:15:01] Sister and I was talking the other day
[1:15:03] and she said, "Isn't it amazing? It
[1:15:06] amazes me." She said, "How that we can
[1:15:09] see this
[1:15:12] and others cannot see it.
[1:15:16] They can't comprehend it. They can't
[1:15:17] grasp a hold of it. But what is it?" We
[1:15:20] can see it. We can see it so easily.
[1:15:23] Why? Because it's God's playbook that
[1:15:25] you are in.
[1:15:28] It's easy to see when your name is in
[1:15:30] the book.
[1:15:32] It's easy to see when you look at it and
[1:15:34] you know that you believe it and there's
[1:15:36] nothing that there is to question about.
[1:15:38] There's no question.
[1:15:40] You hear it, you see it, you take it in,
[1:15:43] you believe it.
[1:15:45] You don't make yourself believe it.
[1:15:49] And you can try and try and try to force
[1:15:54] feed it to some people.
[1:15:58] and they can't see it.
[1:16:00] They can't take it in. You ever tried to
[1:16:02] feed a baby green peas that don't want
[1:16:04] green peas? You fix to get spit on.
[1:16:06] [Music]
[1:16:08] And the word, the word is such such
[1:16:11] simplicity and it's good for them and
[1:16:13] it's nutritious and if they could just
[1:16:15] take it in, they could see. But it's not
[1:16:17] for them. They cannot digest it.
[1:16:23] And he begins to tell us in this book
[1:16:25] here, he talks about the scribe, John.
[1:16:28] He says the the scribe, not the author.
[1:16:32] And it's important that we realize that
[1:16:34] and know that he says it's the scribe,
[1:16:36] not the author, the St. John divine. He
[1:16:38] said historians uh believe that he lived
[1:16:41] out most of his life in Ephesus. But
[1:16:43] when this was written, it was given to
[1:16:45] him on the aisle of Patmas. Now, where
[1:16:47] do where do where do people get confused
[1:16:49] and confounded about on this? It's
[1:16:52] sometimes it's because in the place that
[1:16:53] they see the story and the life that
[1:16:56] John had to live. John was placed in
[1:16:59] exile on the aisle of Patmas. He was
[1:17:02] placed out there and pushed out there
[1:17:04] because he preached the word. He lived
[1:17:06] the life of Christ. He began to tell
[1:17:09] people what Christ was going to do. He
[1:17:11] began to tell people with authority what
[1:17:13] Christ did in the day. So they didn't
[1:17:15] like it and they pushed him out on this
[1:17:16] exile. So the theologians want to say,
[1:17:18] man, this is all about John.
[1:17:21] This book is not about John.
[1:17:24] John did have an experience in
[1:17:26] Revelations and he was instructed, write
[1:17:28] down what I tell you and take it to the
[1:17:31] seven churches in Asia.
[1:17:36] But it's not about the life of John.
[1:17:40] It's the revelation of Jesus Christ. He
[1:17:43] says, "And the future church ages."
[1:17:50] You look at these church ages on this on
[1:17:52] this on this wall here.
[1:17:55] You know, all that was after Jesus.
[1:18:01] Did you ever think about it? We think
[1:18:04] when we look at this and we think this
[1:18:06] is the life of Jesus Christ. We have to
[1:18:08] have this, this, and this, and this. And
[1:18:10] we do. Don't misunderstand me, but all
[1:18:14] of this happened after Jesus had left
[1:18:17] the scene.
[1:18:19] This is after he's gone to prepare a
[1:18:21] place.
[1:18:23] Oh, thank God. He's preparing a place.
[1:18:26] He's gone to prepare a place. And this
[1:18:29] is this right here is the steps for the
[1:18:31] believer in this day.
[1:18:35] This is not Noah.
[1:18:38] This is not Moses.
[1:18:41] This is you.
[1:18:43] This is I.
[1:18:48] This book is termed the revelation of
[1:18:50] St. John. He says, "But that's
[1:18:51] incorrect. The revelation of Jesus
[1:18:54] Christ is given to John for Christians
[1:18:56] of the ages.
[1:18:58] Ephesus,
[1:19:00] Smyrna, Pergamus, Thitara, Sardius,
[1:19:03] Philadelphia, Leota.
[1:19:06] That's what this book of Revelations was
[1:19:08] for. It wasn't to tell us it was going
[1:19:10] to come a flood.
[1:19:14] It was to tell us he's coming for a
[1:19:16] bride.
[1:19:23] You say, "Man, I wish I could have been
[1:19:25] in Noah's day."
[1:19:27] This is the greatest day we're talking
[1:19:30] about.
[1:19:32] When he splits the sky back open and he
[1:19:34] comes down and he says, "Come away. Come
[1:19:36] away, my love. That is the greatest day
[1:19:40] that you'll ever see in the in in the
[1:19:41] outpour of history of humankind is when
[1:19:44] he says come away.
[1:19:47] And I want you to realize that as as the
[1:19:50] prophet's talking, he says this is the
[1:19:52] only book in the entire Bible that was
[1:19:57] written by Jesus himself.
[1:20:04] 66 books over 40 years span. 1600 years,
[1:20:09] 40 different authors, 1600 year span.
[1:20:12] And this is when Jesus speaks. The rest
[1:20:15] of it is accounts of his life. The rest
[1:20:17] of it is account of history. Yeah, we
[1:20:20] can look at the Bible. We can say there
[1:20:21] is a ton of history in this book.
[1:20:25] But there's also a road map.
[1:20:27] There's also a modernday GPS in it built
[1:20:30] in this book right here.
[1:20:32] And it tells you where you're going or
[1:20:34] where you're not going. It tells you how
[1:20:36] you're going to get there and if you're
[1:20:38] not going to get there.
[1:20:43] You see, we've been we we we see this
[1:20:45] and and we think all through the Bible.
[1:20:47] We hear all of these great stories in
[1:20:49] action. And man, we love them. We preach
[1:20:52] them. We get inspired by them. We hear
[1:20:54] all these great stories of in the Bible.
[1:20:56] We hear about the creation in the
[1:20:58] beginning. And we hear about how God has
[1:21:00] come and he he moved onto the scene and
[1:21:01] he placed this and he placed that. And
[1:21:03] the prophet says he done this and he
[1:21:05] done that and he put this tree over here
[1:21:07] and that tree over there. And he says it
[1:21:09] just amazing when he says and he blew
[1:21:11] the stars out of the palm of his hand.
[1:21:20] And you love to hear those stories and
[1:21:24] they inspire us. And we see the fall in
[1:21:27] the garden. We see redemption. We see
[1:21:29] the redemption of mankind take place
[1:21:31] down through history. And all these
[1:21:34] begin to tie into our lives. We see the
[1:21:36] calling out of God's people out of
[1:21:38] Egypt. Come out of her.
[1:21:41] Do you see how it just keeps funneling
[1:21:43] down? Come out of her.
[1:21:46] When people were bound and and and
[1:21:48] constricted by denominational systems,
[1:21:51] denominational systems of man,
[1:21:54] do it this way, do it that way. Let me
[1:21:56] tell you, denominational systems of man
[1:21:58] will not get you in a rapture.
[1:22:02] You can clean it up all you want. You
[1:22:04] can look as holy as you want.
[1:22:09] Don't do this because
[1:22:12] Don't wear this because wear this
[1:22:15] because let me tell you, I've seen a
[1:22:17] group of young ladies,
[1:22:19] this ain't in my notes, so somebody's
[1:22:21] somebody's pulling on us.
[1:22:24] They were dressed to the tea according
[1:22:26] to their system.
[1:22:29] Their transportation was correct
[1:22:31] according to their system.
[1:22:36] Yeah, boy. They looked apart. Holy,
[1:22:39] holy, holy.
[1:22:41] But they were passing a cigarette around
[1:22:43] to each other at a dollar general store
[1:22:48] at an open.
[1:22:50] No shame, no regret,
[1:22:53] but the system looked good.
[1:22:58] their man-made system looked good.
[1:23:03] I'm not talking about a man-made system.
[1:23:05] I'm talking about a life lived for Jesus
[1:23:08] Christ. A life that says, "I don't do
[1:23:10] that because I love him too much. I
[1:23:12] don't want to hurt him. I don't want to
[1:23:14] embarrass him. I don't want to shame
[1:23:15] him." I looked at those girls, I
[1:23:17] thought, "What a shame it is. What an
[1:23:19] embarrassment you are to your community.
[1:23:28] And we see these stories of David and
[1:23:32] Daniel and the three Hebrew children.
[1:23:34] There's Samson
[1:23:36] who builds who's built up and lifted up.
[1:23:39] And we see Shamgar and Ruth and Esther.
[1:23:42] And I love to preach those. But when
[1:23:44] Jesus comes on the scene,
[1:23:48] there's Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[1:23:50] And what do they do? They begin to get
[1:23:52] out their pencil and they write.
[1:23:55] Oh, look at what Jesus did. Look at
[1:23:58] Jesus. Look what he's done.
[1:24:01] Here we are. We saw a leper coming down
[1:24:03] the road. And as he approached Jesus, we
[1:24:06] were all afraid. But then Jesus stepped
[1:24:08] onto the scene.
[1:24:11] Come.
[1:24:14] There was a paralytic man
[1:24:18] that was let down through the roof.
[1:24:21] hadn't walked since he was a child from
[1:24:23] his childhood.
[1:24:25] Come
[1:24:29] blinded eyes were open,
[1:24:32] deaf ears unplugged, dead, raised. There
[1:24:36] was a little girl laying there, laying
[1:24:38] there in in the bedroom, dead as could
[1:24:40] be.
[1:24:42] And he says, "Everybody just step out of
[1:24:44] the room and give me just a minute."
[1:24:49] He's in the house.
[1:24:52] He's in the house.
[1:24:54] What was it? It was God moving on the
[1:24:56] scene in the hour where he was called to
[1:24:59] be.
[1:25:01] But now things have changed.
[1:25:05] You say, "Is he not still on the scene?"
[1:25:07] Absolutely. He's still on the scene.
[1:25:09] He's on the scene today greater today
[1:25:11] than he ever was
[1:25:14] in his earthly ministry. More things
[1:25:16] have happened in this hour
[1:25:18] than would ever happen in the earthly
[1:25:20] ministry of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:27] But he's come
[1:25:31] and he's delivered
[1:25:34] and now he's gone for a season.
[1:25:38] He finished out his earthly ministry.
[1:25:45] And we look at this and the prophet says
[1:25:47] it this way. He says it is the last book
[1:25:50] of the Bible
[1:25:52] yet it tells the beginning.
[1:25:56] He's not talking about the garden.
[1:25:59] He's not talking about the Garden of
[1:26:01] Eden. He's not talking about that. He's
[1:26:03] not talking about that beginning. He's
[1:26:05] talking about the beginning
[1:26:08] of the gentile bride.
[1:26:14] Y'all awful quiet.
[1:26:16] Did y'all read ahead?
[1:26:21] It's the end of the dispensation of the
[1:26:23] gospels, but it's the beginning of the
[1:26:26] gentile bride's dispensation.
[1:26:30] Who you are.
[1:26:33] You need a scripture, don't you? John
[1:26:34] 14:3
[1:26:36] says it this way. Let not your heart be
[1:26:38] troubled. Ye believe in God, believe
[1:26:39] also in me. In my father's house are
[1:26:41] many mansions. If it were not so, I
[1:26:44] would have told you. I go to prepare a
[1:26:46] place for you.
[1:26:54] I go to prepare a place for you. And if
[1:26:56] I go and prepare a place for you, then I
[1:26:58] will come again and receive you unto
[1:27:00] myself, that where I am, there you may
[1:27:03] be also.
[1:27:05] And he goes on and Thomas begins to ask
[1:27:08] him and question and well how do we know
[1:27:10] Lord? How will we know? How will we know
[1:27:12] this? How will we know that? How will we
[1:27:14] know when the time has come? And Jesus
[1:27:16] looks at him and he says how do you know
[1:27:19] what? How do we know which way to turn,
[1:27:22] Lord?
[1:27:24] To what other way would you turn?
[1:27:29] Have I been before you this long?
[1:27:32] And let me stress you now that you
[1:27:34] should know that I am the way.
[1:27:37] I am the truth and I am the life.
[1:27:42] Brothers and sisters, this book of
[1:27:43] Revelation is Jesus revealing himself to
[1:27:45] the world.
[1:27:48] When you look at the word of of
[1:27:50] revelation, when you look at that word,
[1:27:52] it means apocalypse, which means
[1:27:53] unveiling.
[1:27:56] So now Jesus is unveiling himself to his
[1:27:58] people.
[1:28:00] He's unveiling himself to you and I. You
[1:28:02] say, "Well, I I can't see him. He's not
[1:28:04] here. I wasn't there when he was on the
[1:28:06] so shores of Galilee. I wasn't there
[1:28:08] when he was." But he's here.
[1:28:11] He's here and he's revealing himself on
[1:28:13] the inside. And he's sharing himself
[1:28:16] with you today. He's in this unveiling
[1:28:19] process and he's letting the world know
[1:28:22] that there's more to the story than a
[1:28:25] hill called Calvary.
[1:28:27] You remember I told you that some
[1:28:29] denominations will say the Baptist, the
[1:28:31] Methodists, the press, they want to stop
[1:28:33] right there at Calvary
[1:28:35] and they put him on a hill called
[1:28:37] Calvary, get all their sins removed and
[1:28:39] go on living whichever way they want.
[1:28:43] That's not all of them.
[1:28:45] It's not all of them,
[1:28:48] but it's a lot.
[1:28:51] I witnessed it. You witnessed it.
[1:28:53] Somewhere there has to be a change to
[1:28:55] take place.
[1:28:57] It's more than just an experience on a
[1:28:59] cross, but it's a change on the inside
[1:29:02] that won't let me do those things
[1:29:04] anymore.
[1:29:11] And he's telling us as he begins to peel
[1:29:13] the layers back,
[1:29:15] this is not the end of my story.
[1:29:21] We got him off in a far away pl place.
[1:29:24] Jesus in a far far far away land.
[1:29:28] It's not the end of my story.
[1:29:30] My story don't end there. My story is
[1:29:33] just beginning.
[1:29:36] The greater work that I'm going to do is
[1:29:37] when I go down and I go find myself a
[1:29:39] gentile bride in this wicked evil age.
[1:29:43] Somebody that will love me greater than
[1:29:45] my Jewish people.
[1:29:46] Come on, church.
[1:29:48] They're the ones that put him on the
[1:29:50] cross.
[1:29:51] They're the ones that crucified him.
[1:29:53] They're the ones that call crucify him.
[1:29:55] Give us Barabus.
[1:30:01] But he says, I love this Gentile group
[1:30:05] of people so much
[1:30:08] because they don't know all the ins and
[1:30:10] outs. They don't know all the doctrines
[1:30:12] of Judaism.
[1:30:14] They don't know how to speak Hebrew.
[1:30:16] They don't know all the customs. But one
[1:30:18] thing I know is they they know me.
[1:30:21] When I reveal myself to them, they know
[1:30:25] me in a way greater than any other has
[1:30:28] ever known me.
[1:30:30] [Applause]
[1:30:34] So, you are the story this morning.
[1:30:38] Like I said, you're not sitting here
[1:30:39] because of happen stance.
[1:30:42] It's not by chance that you're sitting
[1:30:44] here, but you're sitting here this
[1:30:46] morning because there's a part of the
[1:30:48] story that has your name in it.
[1:31:01] Jesus says, "I want to share myself with
[1:31:03] you.
[1:31:07] I want to give you something like you've
[1:31:08] never had before."
[1:31:12] Did you ever feel any better than the
[1:31:14] day that Jesus came into your heart?
[1:31:17] No. Why was that? because he gave a
[1:31:19] portion of himself to you.
[1:31:23] He began to pour himself into you and he
[1:31:26] wrote your name in the love letter.
[1:31:29] Can't you see this morning that the
[1:31:30] letter that God wrote is a love letter
[1:31:33] addressed to you?
[1:31:34] Amen.
[1:31:40] Think of it this way. On the cross, he
[1:31:43] saved you.
[1:31:45] On the cross, he saved you. He healed
[1:31:46] you. He delivered you. He set you free.
[1:31:50] That's what he was doing right there. He
[1:31:52] was a God in action. He was he was
[1:31:54] putting himself on the cross and said,
[1:31:56] "I'm going to do this for the entire
[1:31:57] world." But on the day of Pentecost, he
[1:32:00] said, "Now I've saved you. Now I'm going
[1:32:03] to fill you.
[1:32:05] Now I'm going to let you do the greater
[1:32:06] work. Now I'm going to put you in place.
[1:32:09] Now I'm going to make you the bride. And
[1:32:11] now today in the book of Revelations,
[1:32:13] what's he doing? He's preparing you."
[1:32:17] Can you see that he's preparing? He's
[1:32:19] preparing the bride in this hour.
[1:32:22] He's giving you word upon word.
[1:32:25] Line upon line, jot upon jot,
[1:32:29] and he's sharing himself over and over
[1:32:31] and over. The mystery of God revealed,
[1:32:35] the seven church ages, the seals,
[1:32:41] the statue of a perfect man. C O D.
[1:32:46] That's conduct, order, and doctrine. In
[1:32:47] case you don't know, that's cood. And he
[1:32:51] is, what is he doing? He's preparing you
[1:32:53] as a bride adorned for her husband.
[1:32:56] We look at this bride adorned for her
[1:32:58] husband. We see it in in Revelations
[1:33:00] chapter 21. It talks about a new
[1:33:02] Jerusalem. It's talking about a city.
[1:33:05] It's talking about a new Jerusalem. And
[1:33:07] she's described as what? As a bride
[1:33:10] prepared for her husband.
[1:33:13] this city. What is what's taking place
[1:33:16] here? This is this image is depicting
[1:33:18] this city that is meticulously
[1:33:20] prepared that is beautifully dressed has
[1:33:24] been taken care of
[1:33:28] and getting ready
[1:33:30] for a special group of people.
[1:33:37] So, you mean to tell me that God is away
[1:33:40] working on a city?
[1:33:44] He's working on a city as he's working
[1:33:46] on a vessel.
[1:33:50] There's going to be a group of people.
[1:33:52] There's going to be a vessel that's
[1:33:53] going to step into that city.
[1:33:55] And they're going to be in such union
[1:33:58] and such a connection is going to take
[1:34:00] place. Why? Because just like he's
[1:34:01] meticulously and beautifully working on
[1:34:04] that city, he's meticulously and
[1:34:06] beautifully working on each and every
[1:34:08] one of us. And he's chipping away our
[1:34:10] faults, he's chipping away our failures.
[1:34:13] He's calling you to a new life.
[1:34:19] We see here in this book of Revelations,
[1:34:22] this bride, I want you to notice what
[1:34:24] happens here. We'll go over a few of the
[1:34:26] customs in Jewish Jewish brides or
[1:34:28] weddings. This bride here, this bride
[1:34:32] here, she goes and she bathes herself in
[1:34:35] running water
[1:34:37] once she's been been betrothed.
[1:34:41] She goes and she bathes herself in a
[1:34:43] stream of living running water. You say,
[1:34:46] "Why does she do that?" It's not because
[1:34:48] she's dirty. It's not because she's
[1:34:50] polluted. But she's doing it as a simple
[1:34:53] and as a token
[1:34:55] that the streams of living water flow
[1:34:58] through me.
[1:35:00] I've lived a life pure.
[1:35:03] I've lived a life faithful. I've lived a
[1:35:05] life trustworthy.
[1:35:07] She's letting her future husband know,
[1:35:13] "Yeah, I'm faithful."
[1:35:16] So, here now we see this bride of Christ
[1:35:19] and in anticipation,
[1:35:22] an anticipation of the glory that's been
[1:35:24] bestowed upon him by Christ Almighty.
[1:35:27] And we see them sitting here and they
[1:35:29] begin to look and and and we living in
[1:35:31] our lives have to find ourselves in the
[1:35:35] stream of living waters
[1:35:37] where there is no pollution where there
[1:35:40] is no corruption.
[1:35:42] Where is that? How do I find it? I'll
[1:35:45] tell you.
[1:35:47] It's right here. Find it.
[1:35:50] And you find yourself under those
[1:35:52] streams of living water where you can
[1:35:54] look up and say, "God, I have prepared
[1:35:56] myself. I've kept myself. I've lived as
[1:35:59] holy as I know to live.
[1:36:02] I've turned away from the things of the
[1:36:04] world. I don't have any eyes for nobody
[1:36:06] but you."
[1:36:07] [Applause]
[1:36:15] You see, we look at this here and this
[1:36:17] bride is adorned for her husband.
[1:36:20] It's symbolizing that relationship
[1:36:22] between God and his people, the church,
[1:36:25] the bride.
[1:36:27] We look at ancient Jewish culture here
[1:36:30] and we look at some of these wedding
[1:36:32] culture uh customary procedures.
[1:36:36] First thing would happen,
[1:36:39] the groom's father would go and choose a
[1:36:41] bride for his son.
[1:36:47] You know, me and Brother Joe got accused
[1:36:49] of that.
[1:36:53] We got accused of matchmaking.
[1:36:58] You say, "Well, did you?"
[1:37:01] Not really, but
[1:37:03] it was a match made somewhere. in
[1:37:05] heaven.
[1:37:08] But the the groom's
[1:37:10] father goes out and he begins to choose
[1:37:13] a bride for his son.
[1:37:17] Either he does it or he sends out a
[1:37:18] messenger. Aren't you thankful for a
[1:37:20] messenger?
[1:37:22] Sends out this messenger to go out and
[1:37:24] search and find somebody that would be
[1:37:26] worthy for his son to have or somebody
[1:37:29] that would be worthy to to wed his son.
[1:37:31] And so this bride's father uh she begins
[1:37:33] to go and the bride's father then agrees
[1:37:36] to this marriage. Now watch what the
[1:37:38] next step is.
[1:37:40] They have to come to terms on payment.
[1:37:46] Let me tell you, weddings don't come
[1:37:48] cheap.
[1:37:56] Your wedding didn't come cheap either.
[1:38:00] They have to come to terms on a price
[1:38:02] and it's called it's it's called the
[1:38:03] bride price.
[1:38:06] You see, there was a price paid for you
[1:38:08] to become a bride.
[1:38:10] There was a price paid for you on
[1:38:12] Calvary. There was a price paid that
[1:38:15] when the blood was shed that says you're
[1:38:17] healed, you're delivered. You're free.
[1:38:24] That price was paid. It was called the
[1:38:26] bride price. And it was the Lord Jesus
[1:38:28] Christ that paid that price for you and
[1:38:31] for me.
[1:38:33] Weddings don't come cheap.
[1:38:36] You can't put a price tag on that
[1:38:39] wedding.
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:43] A city prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:38:46] her husband. You cannot put a price on
[1:38:49] that city. You can't put a price on that
[1:38:51] house. You can't put a price on that
[1:38:54] union. Yeah,
[1:38:55] it's priceless.
[1:38:59] And he said, I want you to watch what he
[1:39:01] says. Abraham, watch this now, was
[1:39:03] determined that he did not want his son
[1:39:06] to marry an unbeliever.
[1:39:14] We might have to preach here for a
[1:39:16] minute
[1:39:17] because the next thing he says, he said
[1:39:19] that would be a good decision for
[1:39:20] Christians today. Amen.
[1:39:23] Can you imagine the the the how the home
[1:39:25] would be torn
[1:39:28] this way and that way? One wants to
[1:39:30] serve God and one wants to serve mammon.
[1:39:34] One is in love with the Lord and one
[1:39:36] loves the devil.
[1:39:41] And so now he he says that would be a
[1:39:43] good decision for Christians today who
[1:39:45] are sons and daughters of Abraham who
[1:39:47] make the same decision about their
[1:39:50] children.
[1:39:52] So did I arrange a marriage? No. But did
[1:39:56] I pray for the right one?
[1:39:59] Yes.
[1:40:01] Did I pray for the right one? And God
[1:40:04] after 20 years you pray for your
[1:40:06] children.
[1:40:09] God after 20 years of me and Brother Joe
[1:40:12] never being in contact
[1:40:14] brings him up here.
[1:40:17] Now, some of you, if you watched the
[1:40:19] wedding or the sermon, I don't know if
[1:40:20] you heard it, but I gave a little bit
[1:40:21] about this speech, but it it's what God
[1:40:23] has done. And this ain't in my notes, so
[1:40:26] this is free for you.
[1:40:29] We begin to pray. Won come to us. They
[1:40:30] said, "Mom and dad, I just want what
[1:40:32] y'all got.
[1:40:34] I want somebody that'll sit on the back
[1:40:36] porch with me. I want somebody that'll
[1:40:38] love the Lord with me. I want somebody
[1:40:39] that'll drink coffee with me in the
[1:40:41] mornings.
[1:40:44] Well, I'll tell you what, they love
[1:40:45] coffee.
[1:40:49] I'm thankful they love the Lord more
[1:40:51] than coffee.
[1:40:58] And we begin to pray.
[1:41:00] His mother and I, we begin to pray. We
[1:41:02] can say, "God, send him. Send somebody
[1:41:05] his way. Send him his soulmate. Send him
[1:41:08] somebody that he can love
[1:41:09] unconditionally. And they will love him
[1:41:11] unconditionally.
[1:41:14] How long y'all been married now?
[1:41:17] You still love each other
[1:41:18] unconditionally?
[1:41:23] I'll ask you again in 10 years.
[1:41:30] But after 20 years, God sends somebody
[1:41:33] up here and says, "Hey,
[1:41:35] it's been 20 years since we've seen each
[1:41:37] other, hasn't it?" Yeah, it has.
[1:41:40] Right at 20 years, they were just pups.
[1:41:53] I said, "How old's your oldest?"
[1:41:58] He told me, "She dating anybody?"
[1:42:02] "No,
[1:42:04] waiting for the right one." I said,
[1:42:05] "What about him?"
[1:42:12] He said, "Who's that?" "Your boy." Yep.
[1:42:18] He said, "Come here."
[1:42:22] He said, "Come here." He said, "What's
[1:42:23] his name?" I said, "Weston."
[1:42:26] He said, "What do you think about this
[1:42:27] this picture?
[1:42:32] This is this is matches matchmaking at
[1:42:34] its finest right here." He said, "She's
[1:42:37] pretty."
[1:42:42] He said, "You want to get married?"
[1:42:47] Both of us about choked on that one. I
[1:42:49] said, "Hold up here. They ain't even met
[1:42:51] yet.
[1:42:56] and he said someday.
[1:43:02] So time goes on and we begin to they not
[1:43:05] we they
[1:43:07] or Weston begins to plan out how can we
[1:43:10] go down there. It just so happened God
[1:43:13] had some meetings in place.
[1:43:16] All visitors are welcome.
[1:43:20] Why am I going down this road? I don't
[1:43:21] know.
[1:43:24] But God has a plan.
[1:43:27] God has an action.
[1:43:33] We go down there for church and for him
[1:43:37] to meet this girl.
[1:43:43] Bless her heart. I felt so sorry for
[1:43:44] her. We pulled up in the driveway and
[1:43:47] sat in the living room and she just had
[1:43:49] knee surgery. She's as out of it as
[1:43:53] who can imagine.
[1:43:55] She walks through the room. Hey, and
[1:43:58] gone.
[1:43:59] I said, "This ain't working out.
[1:44:02] This ain't going as planned."
[1:44:06] But God has a plan.
[1:44:10] So, long story short, things happen over
[1:44:12] the next few days and and and this
[1:44:15] happens and that happens. And Adriana's
[1:44:16] an instigator, if you can believe that.
[1:44:23] And she instigates
[1:44:25] and things begin to click and words
[1:44:27] begin to exchange and time goes on and I
[1:44:30] I promise I didn't have y'all in my
[1:44:32] sermon. I And time goes on and words
[1:44:34] exchange.
[1:44:40] Let's put that on the side for a minute.
[1:44:45] When the husband sends out for this
[1:44:46] bride,
[1:44:48] he brings her back.
[1:44:52] The fathers then get together and they
[1:44:54] all begin to talk. The fathers and the
[1:44:56] mothers and and they begin to talk and
[1:44:58] they see how this is going to work. And
[1:45:00] then the then he pays the price.
[1:45:03] He pays the price for this beautiful
[1:45:06] young lady. There was no money exchanged
[1:45:09] in this deal. Okay.
[1:45:13] But this is Jewish customs.
[1:45:16] They pay he pays the price and then they
[1:45:18] do what they call is a cuba
[1:45:21] and then what it is it is a marriage
[1:45:23] contract and it's a an agreement
[1:45:26] signifying that they agree to marry and
[1:45:28] they've written it in a covenant.
[1:45:31] Are you with me? There's been a price
[1:45:34] paid. There's been a covenant made. And
[1:45:36] that covenant says, "I will never leave
[1:45:38] you. I will never forsake you.
[1:45:42] I'll be with you, even in you, to the
[1:45:44] end of the world. There was a covenant
[1:45:46] made when the price was paid, brothers
[1:45:48] and sisters.
[1:45:51] And so, here they come. Now, they're
[1:45:52] betrothed.
[1:45:55] They're betrothed. And unlike today's
[1:45:57] ceremonies where you can just, I don't
[1:45:59] want this one, and kick her to the side.
[1:46:00] I don't want him. I I'm going to go my
[1:46:02] separate way. I like this guy, but
[1:46:03] that's not the way it worked. No.
[1:46:06] Only only the groom's father
[1:46:10] could find the marriage unworthy
[1:46:14] based upon what he found out on her.
[1:46:22] Are you with me?
[1:46:24] Do you see why it's so important that we
[1:46:26] live so close?
[1:46:30] Last sermon I said 164th of an inch.
[1:46:35] Those
[1:46:37] who wasn't here, you don't know what I'm
[1:46:39] talking about.
[1:46:41] 164th of an inch. Joy said, she asked me
[1:46:44] later, she said, "Honey, it's going to
[1:46:46] be hard for us to make it."
[1:46:48] When you said 164th, she said, "We got
[1:46:51] to, you know, we got to live tightened
[1:46:54] up."
[1:46:58] Are you with me, church?
[1:47:00] There's no room for error. Yeah,
[1:47:03] but a covenant's been made
[1:47:05] and that covenant was made there. So now
[1:47:08] they're sitting here together.
[1:47:10] They drank the wine. They signed the
[1:47:12] contract. The groom returns to his
[1:47:14] father's house. And watch what he does
[1:47:16] now. He goes to building.
[1:47:22] He goes to his father's house and he
[1:47:24] builds an addition onto his father's
[1:47:25] house. Why? Because he's going to bring
[1:47:27] this little bride home.
[1:47:30] In my father's house are many mansions.
[1:47:34] And so he begins to build and he begins
[1:47:36] and he builds and he's put getting this
[1:47:38] place prepared for this bride to come
[1:47:40] down to. And as he's building, this may
[1:47:43] take six months. It may take it nine
[1:47:47] months. It may take a year. It may take
[1:47:48] two years.
[1:47:50] But he's building.
[1:47:54] Let me tell you, you ain't going to get
[1:47:55] there in one day.
[1:47:58] That's why we have to have grace for one
[1:48:00] another.
[1:48:02] That's why we have to be able to be
[1:48:04] longsuffering with one another.
[1:48:07] That's why it's thank you. Be thankful
[1:48:08] you've got a long-suffering pastor.
[1:48:13] Come on, church.
[1:48:15] Put your angel wings up. Amen.
[1:48:18] Because if he called us out every time
[1:48:20] he knew something,
[1:48:23] there wouldn't be a
[1:48:26] may not be nothing but pews in here.
[1:48:31] But the longsuffering of God,
[1:48:35] it's patient. It's kind. It's meek. It's
[1:48:39] gentle.
[1:48:42] But he also won't tolerate rebellion.
[1:48:52] What is iniquity? Knowing to do better,
[1:48:54] knowing to do right and doing wrong.
[1:49:02] So now he's built up this house.
[1:49:05] He's building up a building up a cone,
[1:49:07] building up a kingdom, building up a a
[1:49:09] place where there's going to be a
[1:49:10] heavenly union take place.
[1:49:14] Ain't it amazing how the spirit and the
[1:49:15] bride say come.
[1:49:18] Come, Lord. Spirit and the bride, they
[1:49:20] both say the same thing. Come, come. I'm
[1:49:22] ready. I'm coming. I'm coming to get
[1:49:24] you, my love.
[1:49:29] So now this bride
[1:49:33] is sitting here and she's waiting
[1:49:35] expectantly for this bridegroom to come
[1:49:38] onto the scene.
[1:49:40] How many's waiting expectantly?
[1:49:43] You know, if you go through every day
[1:49:45] and you ain't expecting,
[1:49:48] you probably ain't going to get nothing.
[1:49:52] If you go to work and and you say,
[1:49:54] "Well, I don't expect to get paid this
[1:49:55] week."
[1:49:58] You probably ain't going to get paid. If
[1:50:00] you tell your boss that, "I don't expect
[1:50:02] you to pay me." You just cut your
[1:50:04] throat.
[1:50:10] Poor Carson. He's going to get to be
[1:50:12] picked on now.
[1:50:15] He works for us and does stuff around
[1:50:17] and I tell him, "I give you I give you
[1:50:19] this much for this and this much for
[1:50:20] that." Well, if I if I wait one day or
[1:50:24] something, he said, "When do you think
[1:50:25] you're going to be able to get me my
[1:50:26] money?
[1:50:29] You get your money. You get your money."
[1:50:34] Well, I worked for it. Yes, you did.
[1:50:37] You'll get your money. Does anybody like
[1:50:40] to work not get paid? Now, I don't see
[1:50:42] any hands here.
[1:50:44] But you expect it when you go when you
[1:50:47] go to the job on on day one, you expect
[1:50:49] to get paid. Come the end of the week on
[1:50:52] Friday, you expect a paycheck. When I go
[1:50:54] through living through my life and I've
[1:50:56] got problems in my life, I expect God to
[1:50:58] deliver because I expect him to move on
[1:51:01] the scene. I expect him to answer my
[1:51:03] prayers. I expect him to move in my
[1:51:05] children. I expect him to move on the
[1:51:07] job.
[1:51:09] I expect him to pay my bills.
[1:51:12] I can't pay him.
[1:51:15] That's exactly right.
[1:51:16] I expect him to with expectations. He
[1:51:20] delivers on the scene over and over and
[1:51:22] over.
[1:51:24] And she here here she is. She's
[1:51:26] expecting. But what the thing is, she
[1:51:28] don't know when he's going to arrive.
[1:51:32] Nobody knows the day, the hour, the
[1:51:34] time.
[1:51:37] But you know what she did during this
[1:51:40] whole time of expectation when she's
[1:51:42] wondering when's it going to come?
[1:51:43] When's he going to come? She's living
[1:51:45] the life.
[1:51:48] She's still getting ready. She's
[1:51:50] preparing herself. She's got a wedding
[1:51:52] garment that she's been working on.
[1:51:55] She's going to present herself before a
[1:51:57] whole entire world as the bride of the
[1:52:00] bridegroom.
[1:52:02] No matter if he comes today,
[1:52:04] tomorrow, two years, 10 years.
[1:52:10] Somebody asked me one day said, "Well,
[1:52:13] don't you find it hard to just live the
[1:52:15] way that you ought to live like a
[1:52:17] Christian? Don't you find it hard not
[1:52:18] knowing when he's coming?" No. I I don't
[1:52:20] know if he's coming tomorrow, tonight. I
[1:52:21] just want to be ready. So, I'm going to
[1:52:23] live every day as if he's coming
[1:52:25] tomorrow.
[1:52:36] while he's gone off
[1:52:39] and he's building a house.
[1:52:42] He's gone off now and he's building a
[1:52:44] house and he's getting things prepared.
[1:52:48] She's saving herself.
[1:52:51] This is part of the agreement. This is
[1:52:54] part of the price has been paid. You
[1:52:55] won't be out running around. You won't
[1:52:58] be out looking for other men. You won't
[1:53:00] be out looking for a better way. There
[1:53:03] is no better way.
[1:53:05] If you if you're sitting here and you
[1:53:06] think, man, there has to be a better way
[1:53:08] because this person that I know, they go
[1:53:10] to church and they can do this and they
[1:53:12] can do that. That's not a better way.
[1:53:17] How can they do this? How can How come
[1:53:19] they can do this and I can't?
[1:53:22] They're not following the way, the
[1:53:23] truth, the life.
[1:53:26] You see, when it boils down to it, it's
[1:53:28] honing down.
[1:53:31] We all want to go.
[1:53:34] We all want to make it.
[1:53:36] And I'm not saying you won't make it,
[1:53:40] but are you going to go in a rapture?
[1:53:42] There's the question.
[1:53:45] And I hope I'm not talking to anybody in
[1:53:48] this building.
[1:53:49] But I hope you're living so close
[1:53:52] that there's no question. But if you're
[1:53:55] dibbled, diddly and dallying and
[1:53:56] dabbling around in things of the world,
[1:54:00] don't be heartbroken
[1:54:05] when you have to answer.
[1:54:11] You say, "Well, that's hard. How can you
[1:54:13] say that?" Because it's true.
[1:54:16] That goes for me.
[1:54:19] my house,
[1:54:21] brother Ber,
[1:54:22] his house.
[1:54:25] If we dillydally and dabble around in
[1:54:27] the things of the world, you can expect
[1:54:29] worldly things to happen.
[1:54:32] I heard one place while I was just
[1:54:33] listening the other day, the prophet was
[1:54:34] go there was a prayer line and he said
[1:54:36] some some young girl come up through the
[1:54:38] prayer line and she was in dire need.
[1:54:40] Her mother said, "Please, if I bring
[1:54:41] her, can you see her?" He said, "Put her
[1:54:43] in the prayer line.
[1:54:45] Bring her up through the prayer line."
[1:54:47] And he said as they stood there before
[1:54:49] God as his witness, he stood there and
[1:54:51] he said he could see through both of
[1:54:53] them and said, "How can you come ask
[1:54:55] such a request with the lifestyle you're
[1:54:58] living
[1:55:12] Why don't we first bow our heads and get
[1:55:14] right
[1:55:16] before God.
[1:55:18] Exactly.
[1:55:19] You see how the see how the
[1:55:21] circumstances change? A lot of times we
[1:55:23] want to ask, we want this, we want that,
[1:55:25] we want God to move and God, why is why
[1:55:27] is this happening in my family? Why is
[1:55:28] my kids doing this? Why is why is my
[1:55:30] family torn? Why is this? Why is my job
[1:55:33] falling apart? Why can't I do this?
[1:55:36] What kind of life are you living?
[1:55:38] Oh, you say, "Are you putting fear on
[1:55:40] us?" I'm not putting fear on you.
[1:55:42] That's just the way it is.
[1:55:43] But you know too much.
[1:55:58] Let me ask you this.
[1:56:02] How many would agree here we've been
[1:56:03] bought with a great price?
[1:56:09] And because of that great price, I'm
[1:56:12] everything that God wants me to be.
[1:56:16] So why would I look around and let my
[1:56:19] eyes wander to other things outside of
[1:56:21] Christ?
[1:56:29] This ain't in my notes,
[1:56:32] but you take a you take a person who is
[1:56:35] so bent
[1:56:37] and so determined that I'm going to do
[1:56:40] this and I'm going to do that and I'm
[1:56:41] going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm
[1:56:43] going to just just say I'm going to work
[1:56:45] out till I look like a bodybuilder.
[1:56:50] Why? I'm not saying don't be healthy.
[1:56:54] What are you trying to catch?
[1:56:57] Don't get me wrong, we got people here
[1:56:59] that work out, look like bodybuilders.
[1:57:01] I'm not talking about you working out
[1:57:04] and look like a bodybuilder.
[1:57:08] But the the where the problem comes in
[1:57:11] is where when the motives and the
[1:57:12] objections,
[1:57:17] you say, "I want to look a certain way
[1:57:19] because this person looks a certain
[1:57:20] way." When women begin to turn their
[1:57:22] eyes to the women of the world and want
[1:57:24] to look like the things of the world,
[1:57:27] are you with me?
[1:57:29] You say, "Well, it would make my husband
[1:57:31] it would it would please my husband."
[1:57:32] Well, your husband probably needs to
[1:57:33] quit looking at the things of the world.
[1:57:42] You young people, you'll figure this out
[1:57:44] as you get a little older.
[1:57:49] You get married someday and you'll get
[1:57:52] married someday and
[1:57:55] that that beauty queen,
[1:57:58] she's just as beauty beautiful as she
[1:58:00] ever was,
[1:58:03] but she's bore you a couple of children.
[1:58:07] She's got scars.
[1:58:10] She don't look like she did when she was
[1:58:12] 20.
[1:58:15] Anybody
[1:58:18] hearing what I'm saying? Some of you men
[1:58:20] are awful quiet.
[1:58:24] Maybe I should be.
[1:58:31] But what is that?
[1:58:34] That's the scars.
[1:58:37] That's the That's That's the the the
[1:58:39] putting forth of an effort.
[1:58:43] That is a union that took place. Those
[1:58:45] are battle scars. Those are wounds.
[1:58:47] Those are those are things that made my
[1:58:49] young men, my young boys what they are
[1:58:51] today.
[1:58:53] The reason their mother and I gave them.
[1:58:56] I don't have to look for other things
[1:58:58] out there in the world.
[1:59:00] You don't have to look for other things
[1:59:01] out in the world. Beauty is just in the
[1:59:03] eye of the beholder.
[1:59:05] My wife's as beautiful today as she was
[1:59:07] the day I met her.
[1:59:09] [Applause]
[1:59:15] So, here's Christ. Now, I want you to
[1:59:17] watch this.
[1:59:19] Here's here's Christ. What's he doing?
[1:59:21] He's beginning to share his most
[1:59:23] intimate secrets.
[1:59:27] And we're a part of that story.
[1:59:30] You're a part of the most intimate
[1:59:32] secrets. And he begins to to reveal what
[1:59:34] the life that he expects out of his
[1:59:36] bride. how she'll be faithful, how
[1:59:38] she'll be true, how she'll be she'll
[1:59:40] stand right up on the revelation of the
[1:59:42] word.
[1:59:52] Listen,
[1:59:55] if revelation is beyond you, look up and
[1:59:57] seek God for it.
[2:00:01] I want the revelation of the word.
[2:00:05] If it's beyond you, look up and seek God
[2:00:07] for it. That's the only way you're ever
[2:00:10] going to get it. A revelation has to
[2:00:11] come from God. It never comes from
[2:00:13] human.
[2:00:15] But it's spiritual indument.
[2:00:19] You can even memorize scripture and
[2:00:21] though that's wonderful, that won't do
[2:00:24] it.
[2:00:27] It has to be a revelation from God. It
[2:00:29] has to say stay in the word that no
[2:00:31] man's can say that Jesus is the Christ
[2:00:34] except by the Holy Ghost. You have to
[2:00:36] receive the Holy Ghost and then and only
[2:00:39] then
[2:00:41] can the spirit give you revelation that
[2:00:44] Jesus Christ is the Christ, God, the
[2:00:48] anointed one.
[2:00:56] Listen to this. Now we're into quotes in
[2:00:59] the in the church age.
[2:01:02] We need to call on God for revelation
[2:01:04] more than anything else in the world.
[2:01:07] [Applause]
[2:01:09] H
[2:01:11] we've accepted the Bible. We have
[2:01:13] accepted the great truths. But still it
[2:01:14] is not real to most people
[2:01:20] because the revelation by spirit is not
[2:01:22] there. The word has not been quickened.
[2:01:25] Do you see how important it is that we
[2:01:27] have a quickening by the by the
[2:01:29] anointing of the Holy Spirit? That when
[2:01:30] you look into the word and you read the
[2:01:32] word, God brings life into that word and
[2:01:34] then you can take that life of that word
[2:01:36] and put it down inside and you begin to
[2:01:38] live the quickened life filled with the
[2:01:40] Holy Ghost.
[2:01:44] Watch what he says. He says Jesus became
[2:01:47] sin for us.
[2:01:49] The bride price was paid. He became sin
[2:01:52] for us. He says it's not that he became
[2:01:54] sinful. He didn't go out and do the
[2:01:57] sinful things of the world to say, "Oh,
[2:01:59] I can be like them."
[2:02:01] He wasn't trying to be like you. He was
[2:02:03] trying to save you.
[2:02:06] And so, he became sin that that we might
[2:02:09] have a union with him that we might
[2:02:11] become the righteousness of God.
[2:02:17] He says, "This unveiling,
[2:02:20] this unveiling
[2:02:22] talking about in the book of Revelations
[2:02:24] is perfectly described as an example of
[2:02:26] a sculpture unveiling his work of a
[2:02:29] statuary,
[2:02:31] exposing it to the onlooker."
[2:02:35] So, you see, the problem is
[2:02:38] God begins to unveil what he's got going
[2:02:41] on. And so the problem is is people they
[2:02:45] don't they don't want to look through
[2:02:46] the through the eyes of the sculptor and
[2:02:49] see what's going on. They look through
[2:02:51] the eyes of CNN,
[2:02:54] Fox News,
[2:03:00] Tik Tok,
[2:03:04] man. You Tik Tok had every city in the
[2:03:06] in the in the United States of America
[2:03:08] blowing up in a fireworks show.
[2:03:12] Did y'all Did Didn't I pop up on y'alls?
[2:03:15] I know y'all got Tik Tok. Don't act so
[2:03:22] Some of you do. I know you do. You send
[2:03:24] me Tik Toks.
[2:03:29] Na na na boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo
[2:03:30] boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo
[2:03:30] boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo
[2:03:30] boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo
[2:03:30] boo boooo I got you.
[2:03:35] But they begin to turn their eyes to
[2:03:37] these things. They begin to turn their
[2:03:39] eyes into the into the things of the
[2:03:40] world to CNN, Fox News, and and all
[2:03:43] these different uh the Roman Empire, and
[2:03:45] they begin to look at politicians,
[2:03:48] and they begin to begin to look, and
[2:03:50] they turn to these outlets to see what's
[2:03:51] going to happen next.
[2:03:56] I know what's going to happen next.
[2:03:59] I'm just waiting for it to happen.
[2:04:02] The only thing that is left to happen is
[2:04:04] what?
[2:04:06] Thank you,
[2:04:11] And all these events are beginning to
[2:04:12] take place.
[2:04:15] Well, the stock market is going to do
[2:04:16] good because Trump just signed a big
[2:04:18] beautiful bill.
[2:04:24] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:27] It's all right.
[2:04:29] I'm gonna I'm gonna enjoy it while I'm
[2:04:31] here.
[2:04:32] No taxes on tips.
[2:04:35] Yes, sir. Bring it on.
[2:04:39] You going to get more money per child?
[2:04:43] Well, mine's moving out, so
[2:04:49] where were you at, Biden, when I needed
[2:04:50] you?
[2:04:53] But they begin to turn to these things,
[2:04:55] these big beautiful bills and these big
[2:04:56] beautiful deals and everything's going
[2:04:58] to get straightened out and everything's
[2:05:00] looking good. Israel and Iran, they're
[2:05:02] now friends. No, they're not. They never
[2:05:03] will be. It's not going to happen.
[2:05:08] Why? How do you know that? How can you
[2:05:10] say that with such authority?
[2:05:12] I've read the back of the book.
[2:05:15] I've read the back of the book.
[2:05:20] If you say, "Well, it could happen. It
[2:05:22] may happen. Maybe it will. Maybe it
[2:05:23] won't." Then you're saying this ain't
[2:05:24] true.
[2:05:27] Oh, it may deceive some. It may look it
[2:05:29] may look as though,
[2:05:33] but that's just the way Satan works.
[2:05:34] That things look as though.
[2:05:37] So, brothers and sisters, what the big
[2:05:39] reveal is is God peeling back the cover.
[2:05:44] God begins to pull back the cover and he
[2:05:47] begins to tell you who you are and you
[2:05:49] who you are and you who you are and he
[2:05:53] begins to say, "This is mine. This is my
[2:05:55] bride." And he begins to Can you imagine
[2:05:57] if if you got a big picture and it's a
[2:05:59] big portrait and it's the most beautiful
[2:06:00] thing and you got a big blanket over it
[2:06:02] and then you throw that drape off and
[2:06:04] that blanket of that blanket and that
[2:06:05] picture's exposed,
[2:06:09] how proud you are.
[2:06:12] He's revealing exactly who he is.
[2:06:17] Listen to this.
[2:06:19] It's a love letter.
[2:06:22] And he says he's uncovering and
[2:06:24] revealing what was previously hidden
[2:06:30] revelation
[2:06:33] unveiling
[2:06:34] what was hidden. And he said he's
[2:06:36] uncovering it. He's he's he's revealing
[2:06:38] what was hidden. It's the true
[2:06:40] revelation of the person of Christ. Not
[2:06:43] only that, but is the revelation of his
[2:06:46] future works and his own coming to the
[2:06:50] seven church ages. And he says this
[2:06:53] Bible is a love letter.
[2:06:59] A lot of times people just read and they
[2:07:01] read and they read and they read.
[2:07:06] But it's more than just words on a
[2:07:09] paper.
[2:07:11] It's a love letter that is addressed to
[2:07:14] you. It's a love letter that you have to
[2:07:16] get in there and you have to read and
[2:07:17] you have to get in there and you get it.
[2:07:18] You don't have to have an education.
[2:07:21] Just read the letter. You know, words of
[2:07:24] love.
[2:07:29] These two over here started talking and
[2:07:32] I'm sure these two were probably very
[2:07:34] similar. Who else is a new married
[2:07:35] couple? Josh and Leah. They've been
[2:07:37] married a few years. Austin surrendered.
[2:07:39] They've been married a few years. Well,
[2:07:40] their wives ain't with them, so I don't
[2:07:42] know where the
[2:07:44] Just kidding. Just kidding. They're
[2:07:45] happily married.
[2:07:48] But at some point in that relationship,
[2:07:52] there was probably letters written.
[2:07:56] Am I right?
[2:07:59] Oh,
[2:08:01] they they they 10 shades of red over
[2:08:04] there.
[2:08:07] And I read and I I so I looked up on
[2:08:09] Google. I said, "What wh what what what
[2:08:11] is a love letter? How do you write a
[2:08:12] love letter?
[2:08:17] You write a love letter to express your
[2:08:19] feelings. You know, when you first start
[2:08:22] courting, you you just kind of get to
[2:08:23] know one another. You're talking and you
[2:08:25] don't you don't share every detail. You
[2:08:26] got got to get to know that person a
[2:08:28] little bit. Look at these two over here
[2:08:29] now.
[2:08:31] They grinning like possum.
[2:08:34] You got to kind of get to know one
[2:08:36] another. So you you test the waters and
[2:08:39] what do you think about what do you well
[2:08:40] this that but then eventually the
[2:08:42] letters begin to write and you write
[2:08:45] that and you're expressing your feelings
[2:08:47] and you begin to share specific details.
[2:08:49] Then
[2:08:51] you begin to share memories.
[2:08:54] You begin to share your emotions.
[2:08:57] You begin to share everything in this
[2:08:59] letter that is special.
[2:09:02] You begin to tell them what you admire
[2:09:03] about them.
[2:09:06] Here's some ideas and examples to
[2:09:08] inspire you.
[2:09:11] My dearest
[2:09:13] to the man who holds my heart,
[2:09:17] my love, my sweetheart.
[2:09:22] I never knew that I truly needed until
[2:09:24] the day I met you.
[2:09:28] Isn't that the truth?
[2:09:30] I never knew what I truly needed until
[2:09:33] the day I met him.
[2:09:37] You're my best friend.
[2:09:40] You're my partner.
[2:09:42] You're my everything.
[2:09:47] My love for you has no bounds
[2:09:50] and it grows every day.
[2:09:53] Do you see him pinning this to you? Is
[2:09:56] your heart fluttering?
[2:10:02] You make life more fun.
[2:10:07] Isn't that the truth,
[2:10:10] man? Well, you talking about a life
[2:10:11] without Christ, that's a miserable life.
[2:10:15] A life without Christ is full of misery.
[2:10:17] It's full of torment. It's full of
[2:10:19] pressure,
[2:10:21] stress
[2:10:23] that you can't get away from. But when
[2:10:26] he's on the scene, life's a little more
[2:10:27] fun.
[2:10:29] He makes life fun.
[2:10:31] You say, "Why are you so happy?" He
[2:10:33] makes it fun.
[2:10:40] I'm grateful to have you as my lover, my
[2:10:42] confident,
[2:10:45] and and my forever.
[2:10:49] Huh?
[2:10:54] Do you remember the first time we met?
[2:10:58] Think about this.
[2:11:01] I love the way you make me laugh.
[2:11:08] Oh, I like this one, Tommy. You like
[2:11:10] this one. The way you look at me sets me
[2:11:13] on fire deep down in my core.
[2:11:16] Tommy says, "Let's get it going. Let's
[2:11:18] fire it up."
[2:11:21] God moving in the scene. He's writing a
[2:11:23] love letter.
[2:11:27] I'm so excited to spend the rest of our
[2:11:29] lives making memories together.
[2:11:33] I want to spend every day showing you
[2:11:35] how much you truly mean to me.
[2:11:39] Can you write this? Can Can you write
[2:11:41] these words to your Lord and Savior this
[2:11:43] morning?
[2:11:48] It's a reciprocating love.
[2:11:51] With all my heart and soul, I love you
[2:11:53] more than words can say. Forever yours
[2:11:56] always and forever. Your love.
[2:12:04] You love him this morning.
[2:12:14] To reveal.
[2:12:17] It's a narrative. It's a structure.
[2:12:20] And it says to reveal is to take the
[2:12:23] story
[2:12:25] where it was once secret and previously
[2:12:27] unknown,
[2:12:29] disclosed to everybody, hidden to the
[2:12:31] audience,
[2:12:34] but now it's open for all to see.
[2:12:39] Let's stand to our feet.
[2:12:42] I've got more there, but I'm just going
[2:12:43] to stop. I feel like we've come to a
[2:12:45] good stopping point.
[2:12:47] You love the Lord.
[2:12:51] You see the importance of the revealed
[2:12:53] word of the hour?
[2:12:56] Because the more that Jesus, the more
[2:12:58] that God reveals, the closer we get to
[2:13:01] him. The closer we get to him, the
[2:13:03] sooner time is at hand.
[2:13:08] God's certainly been good to us.
[2:13:13] We'll finish up this afternoon and look
[2:13:15] at a different side of the story as
[2:13:17] well.
[2:13:20] Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly
[2:13:22] Father,
[2:13:26] we thank you, Lord, for this day, this
[2:13:28] beautiful day you've given us and for
[2:13:30] this time of fellowship with you and
[2:13:33] being in your presence, Lord, and just
[2:13:35] feeling the the warmth and and the love
[2:13:38] that you have for your people here
[2:13:40] today, Lord Jesus. And we just trust
[2:13:42] that something was said and something
[2:13:44] would would be inspiring to us, Lord, to
[2:13:48] encourage us that
[2:13:50] we're not a forgotten people. We're not
[2:13:52] a we're not a cast away. We're not cast
[2:13:54] aside. We're not indifferent because
[2:13:56] because of we just want to prove oursel
[2:13:59] indifferent, but we we are who we are
[2:14:02] because of the love we have for you. And
[2:14:04] you love us and you adore us and you
[2:14:06] appreciate us. And by the revealing of
[2:14:09] the word, you have shown the bride who
[2:14:11] she is. And we can see in this hour that
[2:14:14] it the work didn't stop at Calvary. The
[2:14:17] work didn't stop at the day of
[2:14:19] Pentecost.
[2:14:21] The work didn't just stop on the aisle
[2:14:22] of Patmas. But it's a continuation of
[2:14:25] the word living out through your people
[2:14:31] through down through the church ages as
[2:14:33] you prepare for a gentile bride.
[2:14:36] Lord, we just want to tell you how much
[2:14:38] we love you.
[2:14:40] We appreciate you. Thankful for calling
[2:14:43] us, Lord.
[2:14:45] A called and chosen group, a a people
[2:14:52] that you thought so much of that you
[2:14:54] went to Calvary.
[2:14:58] Thank you, Lord, for the blood that was
[2:15:00] shed. Thank you for our healing. Thank
[2:15:01] you for our deliverance. Thank you for
[2:15:03] the price being paid.
[2:15:07] And if there's somebody here this
[2:15:09] morning
[2:15:10] who says, "Lord,
[2:15:13] I've been in a place that
[2:15:17] I know there was a price paid for me,
[2:15:20] but I haven't returned the love the way
[2:15:22] I should have."
[2:15:24] And you just want to raise your hand
[2:15:26] this morning to him.
[2:15:29] If he's tugging at your heart
[2:15:32] and you just want to slip your hand up
[2:15:34] to him this morning and say, "Lord,
[2:15:37] I just want to let you know I do love
[2:15:40] you. I need your help." God bless you.
[2:15:43] Bless those hands. Bless that hand.
[2:15:46] There's something on the inside that's
[2:15:48] tugging at my heart, Lord. I know I'm
[2:15:51] one of yours. I know I've been chosen.
[2:15:53] I've been I've been placed in a position
[2:15:55] in a place for a purpose. I'm here this
[2:15:58] morning for a purpose and you've spoken
[2:16:01] to my heart. And Lord, I just want to
[2:16:02] tell you I love you.
[2:16:05] Help me, Lord, and go with me, Lord.
[2:16:09] Draw me near to you, Lord.
[2:16:12] Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:16] Thank you, Lord Jesus.

[2:16:47] more than I did.

[2:17:37] Jes.
[2:17:39] Oh, I gave him all of my heart.
[2:17:44] And I thought I couldn't love him more.
[2:17:49] than I did right from the start.
[2:17:54] But when I look back over the mountains
[2:17:59] and the valleys where I've been,
[2:18:03] then it makes me know I love him so much
[2:18:09] more than I did then. Oh, I keep falling
[2:18:14] in love with him over and over and over
[2:18:19] and over again. Oh, I keep falling in
[2:18:24] love with him over and over and over and
[2:18:29] over again. Oh, he gets sweeter and
[2:18:34] sweeter as the days go by.
[2:18:38] Oh, what a love between my Lord and I. I
[2:18:42] keep falling in love with him over and
[2:18:46] over and over and over again. Well,
[2:18:51] there's a hand that I hold on to through
[2:18:56] each valley and each trial.
[2:19:01] And there's a shoulder I can lean upon
[2:19:06] when I face another mile.
[2:19:10] And there's a love that I can depend on.
[2:19:15] Oh, it's fresh and new each day.
[2:19:20] And with love, my heart is overflowing.
[2:19:24] And this is wise.
[2:19:27] Oh, I keep falling in love with him over
[2:19:32] and over and over and over again. Oh, I
[2:19:38] keep falling in love with him over and
[2:19:42] over and over and over again. Oh, he
[2:19:47] gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go
[2:19:51] by.
[2:19:52] Oh, the love between my Lord and I. I
[2:19:57] keep falling in love with him over and
[2:20:00] over and over and over again.

[2:26:13] brother. Father, I've got one more
[2:26:17] brother that's a Christian, Lord, that
[2:26:19] you helped us to lead to the Lord. But
[2:26:22] Mooney here, he's gotten sidetracked,
[2:26:23] Lord. The devil's taken him on the side
[2:26:25] for a while.
[2:26:27] Lord, he's followed the wrong spirit for
[2:26:28] a while and he wants to have the right
[2:26:30] spirit, Lord Jesus. He wants to have the
[2:26:32] right attitude, Lord Jesus. And we ask
[2:26:35] God as he comes to you that you'll be
[2:26:37] merciful to him, Lord Jesus, this
[2:26:38] morning, Lord, forgive him of his sins,
[2:26:40] Lord Jesus, as he has confessed them,
[2:26:42] Father, Lord, to you, Lord Jesus. And he
[2:26:45] wants to be right, God. He wants his
[2:26:47] spirit to be right and his thoughts and
[2:26:49] his motives to be right, Lord Jesus. We
[2:26:52] ask God for mercy, Lord, just now for
[2:26:54] him, God. And heal him, Lord Jesus, of
[2:26:56] this anxiety and fear and so forth that
[2:26:59] has gripped him, Lord Jesus. We ask,
[2:27:01] God, that you'll be graceful and
[2:27:03] merciful on him now in the name of Jesus
[2:27:05] Christ.
[2:27:07] Amen and amen.
[2:27:11] Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord.

[2:27:37] David. Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we
[2:27:40] come before you again, Lord. Sister
[2:27:42] Becky, Lord, she's got aches and pains,
[2:27:45] Lord, just to do her everyday work. And
[2:27:47] she believed, God, that if you can touch
[2:27:49] David on Wednesday, you can touch her
[2:27:51] just now, Lord. So we lay our hands upon
[2:27:53] her, Lord, according to your word. And
[2:27:56] we ask for your mercy and your grace to
[2:27:58] come down, Lord Jesus, and grant her her
[2:28:00] heart's desire, Father, that those pains
[2:28:02] would be gone. And that she would be
[2:28:04] limber and that she would feel young
[2:28:06] again, Lord Jesus. We believe, God, her
[2:28:08] God-given right is to be healthy, good,
[2:28:11] good health, Lord Jesus, and prosper. So
[2:28:13] we ask Lord in Jesus' name that you
[2:28:16] would touch her just now. In Jesus name.
[2:28:20] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus.
[2:28:22] That's right.
[2:28:23] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless
[2:28:27] you.
[2:28:30] [Music]
[2:28:33] Right. Amen. All right. Let's lay our
[2:28:35] hands on her. Father, we come Lord with
[2:28:38] our sister Jana this morning. God,
[2:28:40] that's just needing a touch from you,
[2:28:42] Lord. Father, we just ask God that she
[2:28:45] wondered these days, God, in a special
[2:28:47] way. You'll send that angel, Lord,
[2:28:49] coming down her way, Lord Jesus, that
[2:28:51] she'll feel that change happen, Lord,
[2:28:52] and she'll know that she's been touched
[2:28:54] by the master, Lord. We believe it, Lord
[2:28:57] Jesus, cuz you're the same yesterday,
[2:28:59] today, and forever, Father. And we ask,
[2:29:01] God, that you would touch her body,
[2:29:03] Lord, and heal it completely, Lord
[2:29:04] Jesus. And that she'd be in perfect
[2:29:06] health, Lord. Because that's what the
[2:29:08] stripes with the cat of ninetails, the
[2:29:11] stripes that was put on your back, Lord.
[2:29:13] The blood and the ribs that showed,
[2:29:15] Father, you was wounded, Lord, for our
[2:29:18] transgression, bruised for our iniquity,
[2:29:20] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[2:29:22] you. And by the stripes that was put on
[2:29:25] your back, Chana was healed. And we
[2:29:28] claim it now, Father, and we rebuke the
[2:29:30] enemy that would try to put it on her in
[2:29:32] Jesus' name. We cast the devil out.
[2:29:35] Amen. And amen. Amen. Say, "Thank you,
[2:29:38] Jesus." Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:29:42] Yes, brother. My son
[2:29:50] has stomach trouble that has been
[2:29:52] bothering him for the last week or so.
[2:29:54] Amen. He's been losing sleep. Lord
[2:29:56] Jesus, we come before you, Father, this
[2:29:59] morning, Lord Jesus, with my son and
[2:30:02] with your son. Lord Jesus, we ask God
[2:30:04] that you'll touch him, Lord Jesus, his
[2:30:06] stomach trouble that's been bothering
[2:30:08] him, been giving him trouble, Lord
[2:30:09] Jesus, and cause him not to be able to
[2:30:11] sleep, Father, once again, Lord, those
[2:30:14] stripes that was put on your back, Lord,
[2:30:16] when those Romans took that Catan tail,
[2:30:18] Lord, and they beat you and they striped
[2:30:20] you, Lord Jesus. Your wounds were for
[2:30:23] our healing. And we accept it, Lord
[2:30:26] Jesus. We accept the benefit of it for
[2:30:28] Micah this morning. May God you touch
[2:30:30] him in a special way. Lord Jesus, we
[2:30:33] accept your healing for him right now in
[2:30:35] the name of Jesus Christ. Enemy you have
[2:30:38] to leave that wants to bring torment and
[2:30:40] pain to my my son Micah in Jesus name.
[2:30:44] Amen and amen. Praise the Lord. Thank
[2:30:46] you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:30:50] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:30:54] Amen and amen. Praise the Lord. Somebody
[2:30:56] say praise the Lord. God is good. Amen.
[2:31:04] Amen.
[2:31:06] Ain't God good? Amen.
[2:31:09] Why ain't God good?
[2:31:13] Give us so many blessings undeserved.
[2:31:20] That's what we are.
[2:31:23] We ought to thank him.
[2:31:27] I've been praising
[2:31:30] little more today
[2:31:33] and all I am tomorrow.
[2:31:38] Ain't God good?
[2:31:42] Give us so many blessings undeserved.
[2:31:49] That's what we are.
[2:31:52] We ought to thank him,
[2:31:56] love, and praise
[2:31:59] him a little more today
[2:32:02] and a whole lot. You're dismissed if you
[2:32:04] want to go. Okay.
[2:32:06] Amen. God, good.
[2:32:11] Give us so many blessings on this earth.
[2:32:18] That's what we are.
