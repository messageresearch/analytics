[29:46] We'll just stand this morning.
[29:52] Maybe brother John Wade will open us in
[29:54] prayer this morning.
[31:21] Amen. The children can be dismissed for
[31:23] Sunday school. And if you'll go with me
[31:24] in the Psalms, we're going to continue
[31:26] in Psalms here. And we're going to go to
[31:28] Psalms 32.
[31:38] Psalms 32.
[31:42] Blessed is he whose transgression is
[31:44] forgiven, whose sin is covered.
[31:54] When I kept silence, my bones waxed old
[31:56] through my roaring all the day long.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; I acknowledge my sin unto thee. Mine
[32:10] iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will
[32:12] confess my transgression unto the Lord,
[32:15] and thou forgavest the iniquity of my
[32:17] sin. Sa
[32:30] Thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt
[32:33] preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt
[32:35] compass me about with songs of
[32:37] deliverance. say,
[32:47] "Be he not as the horse, or as the mule,
[32:49] which have no understanding, whose mouth
[32:52] must be held in with bit and bridal,
[32:54] lest they come near unto thee."
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Be glad in the Lord. This one together.
[33:06] Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye
[33:09] righteous, and shout for joy, all ye
[33:12] that are upright in heart. God bless.
[33:14] You may be seated, Brother Brian.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Morning, brothers and sisters.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; I was just going to read
[33:34] if you want before
[33:36] get like a rocket and take off here. If
[33:39] you turn to uh first 2 Corinthians the
[33:42] 7th chapter, but I was going to reread
[33:44] that 8th verse here this morning. I will
[33:48] instruct thee and teach thee in the way
[33:50] which thou shalt go and I'll guide thee
[33:53] with mine. And I was just thinking this
[33:55] morning, isn't that really precious to
[33:57] us as Christian believers this morning
[34:00] that God's got you in the palm of your
[34:02] hands? And if you'll just yield all that
[34:04] you are, everything that you are, both
[34:07] you know, body, spo, soul, and spirit to
[34:10] the heavenly father, the Lord, he'll
[34:12] he'll keep you in the palm of his hands
[34:14] and guide you in this wicked age that we
[34:16] live in. But uh I was going to read
[34:20] something before I get into that
[34:21] chapter. I
[34:23] I told you I have already taken care of
[34:25] all the major expenses for the upcoming
[34:28] year. Uh, it was a little bit more than
[34:31] I told you the last time. I was wrong.
[34:34] The insurance for the last year wasn't
[34:37] 39. It was 4,200. And you all know from
[34:40] your own policies that it's gone up
[34:42] again this year. So, the church's policy
[34:45] was around $4,700.
[34:47] And I went ahead and prepaid for 1,800
[34:51] gallons of propane. So, you know, just
[34:55] in the past few weeks, it's been several
[34:57] thousand dollars I've put out, but the
[35:00] church will be all right. When I make
[35:02] the deposit this coming week, we'll
[35:04] we'll still be at about $10,000
[35:07] in the general fund, and I I have about
[35:10] $1,400 in the building funds. So, the
[35:13] Lord has blessed us as we move forward.
[35:17] But um
[35:19] you know I was think I was sitting there
[35:21] uh it could be a dangerous thing and
[35:22] this one thought come to me that we're
[35:26] living in the age where everyone thinks
[35:28] it's just okay. And I'm really to be
[35:31] honest with you it's not just okay. You
[35:34] can't just be okay. You got to know that
[35:36] you know that God has touched your heart
[35:39] and that he's changed you. Because if
[35:41] you go along just believing everything
[35:43] is okay, then you'll wake up one day
[35:46] realizing that you're lost. But I was
[35:49] going to read a little bit out of the uh
[35:53] 12th chapter of of Matthew this morning.
[35:57] Um, and this is what Jesus had to say.
[36:00] Uh, I'm going to read from about the
[36:02] 39th verse. If I read too much, I'll
[36:05] apologize before I get started. But he
[36:08] answered and said, this is the 39th
[36:10] verse of the 12th chapter, but I'm going
[36:11] to be going to 2 Corinthians also. But
[36:15] he answered and said unto them, an evil
[36:17] and adulterous generation seeketh after
[36:20] a sign, and there shall no sign be given
[36:22] to it, but the sign of the prophet
[36:24] Jonas. And we're at that right now. For
[36:28] Jonas was three days and three nights in
[36:30] the whale's belly. So the son of man
[36:32] shall be three days and three nights in
[36:34] the heart of the earth. but really
[36:36] struck me. The men of Nineveh shall rise
[36:39] in judgment with this generation and
[36:42] shall condemn it because it repented at
[36:44] the preaching of Jonas. Behold, a
[36:47] greater than Jonas is here. And when you
[36:48] if you go back to Jonah, you realize
[36:51] that the Ninevites, I mean, they put
[36:53] sackcloth on everything. Their animals,
[36:55] their children, their wives, you know,
[36:57] the husbands, the leaders, the king
[36:59] himself, they all put sackcloth and they
[37:02] humbled themselves before our living
[37:04] God. And and you look at this age that
[37:06] we live in this morning. You think they
[37:08] would be able to would they humble
[37:10] themselves that way this morning? And I
[37:12] it would be a hard thing to see them do
[37:15] that. They're so they're running to
[37:17] destruction so fast. They're not even
[37:19] questioning the path that they're on
[37:21] anymore. And he goes on to say, "The
[37:25] queen of the south shall rise up in
[37:27] judgment with this generation and shall
[37:29] condemn it. for she shall come. She came
[37:31] from the uttermost parts of the earth to
[37:34] hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold,
[37:36] a greater than Solomon is here. And and
[37:39] she was willing to travel great
[37:41] distances in her day and time, which was
[37:44] a hard thing, you know, going by camel
[37:46] and by horse. You know, most people
[37:48] won't even leave their driveway to go
[37:51] hear the word of God in the age that we
[37:53] live in this morning. And they'll be
[37:54] held accountable. We'll all be held
[37:56] accountable for it. And he goes on to
[37:58] say, and this is what I was really
[38:00] thinking about this morning before I go
[38:03] into Corinthians. And Jesus taught the
[38:06] people that that's why I say it's not
[38:09] just okay. If you wind up playing with
[38:11] Christianity and playing with church,
[38:14] you're going to wake up one day and
[38:16] you're going to be possessed by spirits
[38:18] that you really don't want to possess
[38:20] you. Well, this is what Jesus had to
[38:22] say. When the unclean spirit goes out of
[38:25] When the unclean spirit has gone out of
[38:28] a man, he walketh through dry places
[38:30] seeking rest and finding nothing. None.
[38:34] And some of us were like that. But we
[38:36] embrace the cross and the salvation of
[38:39] Jesus Christ. So we had that shield. We
[38:41] had that edge. So when they were looking
[38:43] for a way back in, there was no way back
[38:45] in. But if you're playing with church
[38:47] and playing with God, then you won't
[38:50] have that hedge. You won't have that
[38:52] protection if they're looking to come
[38:54] back in. And then he goes on to say,
[38:56] when the unclean spirit is gone out of
[38:59] man, he walketh through the dry places,
[39:01] seek and rest, and find it not. Then he
[39:04] saith, I will return in unto the my
[39:07] house whence I came out. And when he has
[39:10] come, he findeth it empty, swept, and
[39:12] garnished. So if you play with church,
[39:15] you know, you reach that first pillar
[39:17] there. you you accept Christ, but you
[39:20] don't move into Christ. You you you got
[39:23] a clean dwelling. You got a clean place,
[39:25] but it's not being possessed by the Holy
[39:27] Spirit and the presence of Jesus Christ.
[39:30] It's open for other things to come into
[39:32] that clean place. And he goes, then he
[39:35] goeth and taketh himself. And this is
[39:37] what I was thinking about. It's not just
[39:40] the first date. You wind out being seven
[39:42] times worse than you were before. and
[39:45] then goeth he and taketh himself seven
[39:47] other spirits more wicked than himself,
[39:49] and they enter in and dwell therefore,
[39:51] and the last state of the man is worse
[39:53] than the first. Even so shall it be unto
[39:56] this wicked generation.
[39:59] And I was just thinking that's where
[40:01] we're at this morning. The world is, you
[40:05] know, brother Brandham said all those
[40:06] spirits were released in the river of
[40:08] Euphrates. You know, you just think
[40:11] before the the same spirits that were
[40:13] before the flood, the same spirits that
[40:16] were after the flood, you know, those
[40:18] same spirits are here and they
[40:20] continually have one objective and one
[40:22] goal is to ruin your life and ruin your
[40:25] experience in Jesus Christ this morning.
[40:28] And it's our obligation as Christians
[40:29] and as believers not to leave anything
[40:32] open in our hearts and lives that you
[40:35] fully have to have the armor of Jesus
[40:37] Christ on you where there isn't any
[40:38] openings that they can sneak in and make
[40:41] your life worse today than it was
[40:43] yesterday. And I'll just finish a few of
[40:45] these verses here as I go.
[40:51] You know, he also talks in that chapter
[40:53] about, you know, who's his mother, who's
[40:55] his father, who's his son, you know,
[40:57] brother and sister. And he simply said,
[41:00] "All that have given up everything and
[41:02] follow me." Um, Corinthians the 7th, 2
[41:06] Corinthians the 7th chapter. I was
[41:09] wanting to read this before I get
[41:11] started because I'll get in a hurry and
[41:14] without reading it, but I I just been
[41:17] thinking about the circumstances the
[41:19] last week
[41:21] and that's why I said it's not just
[41:24] okay.
[41:26] You know, I was thinking about 911. You
[41:28] know, everyone went back to church for a
[41:31] few weeks and when did what happened
[41:33] after a few weeks? They went right back
[41:35] to who they really are and what they
[41:37] are. the and that's what I'm trying to
[41:39] it's not just okay. You can't have an
[41:41] okay spirit on you this morning. You
[41:43] actually have to have the actual spirit
[41:45] of Jesus Christ. If you don't have that
[41:48] spirit and you got that just it's just
[41:50] okay. You know, it'll be all right.
[41:52] Everything's all right. If you got that
[41:54] kind of spirit, it's not going to be all
[41:55] right. And I'll uh just read this. This
[41:59] is this morning's devotional.
[42:02] Um and this is what brother Brandham had
[42:04] to say. You know
[42:09] the lion of the tribe of Judah, rise up
[42:12] and roar. Thou art roaring in this last
[42:14] day. And he's talking about the time
[42:16] we're in right now. Your eyes are
[42:18] narrowed and you're looking down. You're
[42:20] seeing the sin of the so-called
[42:22] Christian nation and world. And the
[42:24] perspective here is to think that, you
[42:27] know, this was 60 plus years ago. So
[42:31] just think of where we're at this
[42:32] morning. It's even worse than than it
[42:35] was for him.
[42:37] Seeing that the sin of this nation when
[42:39] it's been bought with precious blood,
[42:41] you're seeing how the denominations are
[42:43] waiting over your word and seeing how
[42:45] the false prophets are lying. God truths
[42:48] they're denying and I could say to
[42:50] ourselves this morning,
[42:53] I think I'm reading the wrong one. I'm
[42:55] think but I'll just finish reading. I
[42:58] have multiple papers in my Bible. I'm
[43:00] reading the wrong one. the royal line of
[43:03] Judah. Let your prophets cry out. When
[43:05] God speaks, who can keep from
[43:07] prophesying? If the word of God comes
[43:10] out of the Bible, moving up through the
[43:12] prophet, how can we hold his peace? And
[43:16] that's where we're at this morning. If
[43:18] he would blow to pieces, oh God, let
[43:20] your prophet roar. Let roll out of your
[43:22] message, God. Let every creature of your
[43:24] kingdom take heed. May they stop. May
[43:27] the women stop and examine themselves.
[43:29] You know, and I as a man, I got we
[43:32] wouldn't be in the condition of the
[43:33] world it is. You know, a lot of people
[43:35] like putting it on everything else, but
[43:37] if men have been who they needed to be
[43:39] the last hundred years, the world
[43:41] wouldn't be like it is this morning. May
[43:44] they stop, May the women stop and
[43:46] examine themselves. May the men stop and
[43:49] examine themselves. May every preacher
[43:51] that listens to this tape stop and
[43:54] examine. And goes, this kind of goes to
[43:56] what I was thinking this morning. It's
[43:58] not just okay. If you got a just okay
[44:00] spirit on you, it's not okay. You have
[44:02] to have the right spirit. For the lo
[44:05] lion of the tribe of Judah ra the true
[44:07] word coming to the prophet. Speak, cry
[44:10] out, repent, and turn back
[44:13] before it's too late. You know, and
[44:16] that's what I was thinking when I was
[44:17] reading in Matthew this morning. We
[44:19] don't want to be be ever in the state of
[44:21] that person where the seven spirits came
[44:23] back and made our end state worse than
[44:25] our beginning state. But I'll just read
[44:28] and sit down out of Corinthians 2
[44:30] Corinthians the 7th chapter.
[44:34] I'll probably read about 11 verses. This
[44:37] is what Paul, brother Paul had to say.
[44:40] You know what brother Paul had to say
[44:43] 2,000 years ago is just important today
[44:46] as it was 2,000 years ago. Having
[44:48] therefore these promises, dearly
[44:50] beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
[44:53] all filthiness of the flesh and the
[44:55] spirit, perfecting holiness and the fear
[44:58] of God. Just remember when we read this,
[45:00] whatever you're holding on to in your
[45:02] life, if you can't bring it through
[45:04] these scriptures, then you don't need it
[45:07] this morning. Receive us. We have
[45:10] wronged no man. We have corrupted no
[45:13] man. We have defrauded no man. I I speak
[45:16] not this to condemn you, for I have said
[45:19] before that you are in our hearts to die
[45:22] and to live with you. Great is my
[45:24] boldness of my speech toward you. Great
[45:26] is my gloring of you. I am filled with
[45:29] comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all
[45:31] your tribulations. For when you were
[45:34] come, forgive some of my pronunciation,
[45:37] into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest,
[45:40] but we were troubled on every side
[45:42] without without our fighting
[45:45] fightings with in our fears.
[45:48] Nevertheless, God that comforth those
[45:50] that are cast down comfort us by the
[45:52] coming of Titus, not by his coming only,
[45:55] but by the consolation wherewith
[45:59] he was comforted in you. when we we were
[46:01] told the earnest of your desire, your
[46:03] mourning, your fe fervent mind toward me
[46:06] so that I rejoice the more for though I
[46:09] made you sorry with a letter he's
[46:11] talking about writing letters and he had
[46:14] to be honest with the people bringing
[46:16] them to repentance I do not repent
[46:18] though I did repent for I am perceived
[46:21] that the same epistle had made you
[46:23] sorrow through it you were for a season
[46:26] now I rejoice not that you were made
[46:28] sorrow but you sorrow to repentance. And
[46:31] that's what I was saying earlier.
[46:33] Everything we read in the word of God in
[46:35] the message of Yahweh should be doing
[46:37] what Paul's saying here should be
[46:39] bringing you to repentance and receiving
[46:41] the true spirit this morning. And I lost
[46:44] my place. Now I rejoice not that you
[46:46] were made sorry, but you sorrowful to
[46:48] repentance. For you were made sorry for
[46:51] a godly manner that you might receive
[46:53] damage by us and nothing. And I'll stop
[46:56] at these last two verses this morning.
[46:59] For the godly s sorrow workketh
[47:02] repentance to salvation, not to be
[47:04] repented of, but the sorrow of the world
[47:07] workketh death. So what he's basically
[47:09] saying, true biblical sorrow
[47:13] of the of what we do in our lives
[47:18] will bring you to repentance. God will
[47:20] give you that spirit in your heart. If
[47:22] you stay quiet enough in your spirit and
[47:25] in your life, God will show you the
[47:27] parts of your life that we need to
[47:29] change or I need to change. It's so
[47:31] important that you listen to that still
[47:34] quiet voice as it's trying to lead you
[47:36] in the day and age. you know that
[47:38] there's been a lot of circumstances in
[47:40] the last week and I was just thinking of
[47:42] what brother Brandham said 60 year the
[47:45] one I was going to read where he was
[47:47] talking six in 1965 he was talking about
[47:51] 60 he was talking about how the message
[47:54] has not denominated after 20 years in
[47:57] that in that quote but we're 80 years
[47:59] past what he said in 1965
[48:02] so I'm thinking no it won't denominize
[48:05] it won't come into anything other than
[48:08] the true word of God. And God is looking
[48:11] for individuals this morning. I can only
[48:14] speak for he wants to put his spirit in.
[48:16] He wants to give you the victory in the
[48:19] age that we live this morning. And the
[48:20] only way you can get there is by truly
[48:23] yielding to Jesus Christ this morning.
[48:25] Brother David
[48:31] &gt;&gt; of the Lord this morning.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. enjoyed that this morning. And
[48:38] it's just good to be a Christian, isn't
[48:40] it? It's good to be in the house of the
[48:43] Lord this morning. And just looking
[48:45] forward to what God has for us by the
[48:47] way of his word this morning. And my
[48:49] just just excited for his goodness and
[48:52] mercy. And let's stand this morning if
[48:55] we could. And you know, I was thinking
[48:57] as brother Troy read that I like that
[49:00] seventh verse says, "Thou art
[49:03] my hiding place.
[49:05] Thou shalt preserve me from trouble.
[49:08] Thou shalt compass me about with song of
[49:12] deliverance. Say, love. I'm so glad that
[49:15] he's our hiding place this morning.
[49:17] Aren't you? Amen. And Amen. My hope is
[49:20] in the Lord this morning. Amen. Not in
[49:23] this world, not in Donald Trump,
[49:27] not in Putin, but my hope is in the Lord
[49:29] this morning from this day forth. Amen.
[49:32] Let's sing it with all of our heart. Oh
[49:34] my hope
[49:38] is in the Lord
[49:42] from this time on
[49:46] and ever more.
[49:49] Oh my hope
[49:53] is in the Lord
[49:57] forever more.
[50:04] I stand in all within the presence of
[50:09] the Lord.
[50:12] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[50:16] lies.
[50:19] For whom the raging of the seas
[50:23] subside.
[50:26] The living sacrifice,
[50:30] the only
[50:32] of life. Oh my hope.
[50:37] Visit the Lord.
[50:41] This time on

[1:00:59] morning. And you know, not only is he
[1:01:02] did he save us, but he's a healer this
[1:01:04] morning. He was wounded for our
[1:01:07] transgression. and he was bruised for
[1:01:08] his iniquity, our iniquities, but by his
[1:01:11] stripes we are healed this morning. And
[1:01:14] Amen. Brother Daniel and brother Michael

[1:01:22] brother Daniel.

[1:01:26] We have some prayer requests this
[1:01:27] morning. We want to take to the Lord in
[1:01:29] prayer and want to give thanks to the
[1:01:32] Lord. Brother Brad's feeling better and
[1:01:35] Brother Thomas is feeling better and and
[1:01:37] uh Brother John text me just a few
[1:01:40] minutes ago. Brother John Ler, he said
[1:01:42] he's doing better this morning. They're
[1:01:44] they're not here this morning. We want
[1:01:46] to continue to remember brother John in
[1:01:48] prayer this morning that God will just
[1:01:50] be with them. And brother Thomas said
[1:01:52] brother Caleb is still very sick this
[1:01:54] morning. So we want to remember brother
[1:01:55] Caleb Ber this morning and our shut in
[1:01:58] sister Parish and sister Peggy. And I
[1:02:00] talked to brother David Smith, her son,
[1:02:03] the other day and he said she was doing
[1:02:05] good. Said she still relies on oxygen a
[1:02:08] lot. So we want to continue to pray that
[1:02:11] the Lord will just help Sister Peggy and
[1:02:13] also Sister Janette and Sister Sherry
[1:02:15] and continue to heal Brother Glenn. Just
[1:02:17] pray that God will help them. And also
[1:02:19] Sister Aaliyah and Hi May are not
[1:02:21] feeling well this morning. We want to
[1:02:23] remember them in prayer that God would
[1:02:25] just
[1:02:27] would just touch their bodies this
[1:02:28] morning. And uh also, Brother Brad give
[1:02:32] a request in the back for a na a man by
[1:02:35] the name of Roy that has cancer. and uh
[1:02:39] brother uh Weston
[1:02:42] had met him and told him about brother
[1:02:45] Brad and them about their business and
[1:02:47] they talked to them and his wife began
[1:02:49] to tell uh Sister Joyce about their
[1:02:53] condition and they begin to witness what
[1:02:55] God has done
[1:02:57] and amen our God's a healer this
[1:03:00] morning. So, we're going to ask brother
[1:03:01] Brad if he'll come and take these needs
[1:03:04] to the Lord. And if you have need on
[1:03:05] your heart, you just let it be known by
[1:03:07] the uplifted hand. Come ahead, brother
[1:03:09] Brad.
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:15] With you. If you've got just a second.
[1:03:17] The Lord, you know, the Lord puts people
[1:03:19] in our lives at certain times and
[1:03:21] certain places and sometimes we don't
[1:03:22] know, we don't understand what for what,
[1:03:25] but we're we each have a purpose and
[1:03:28] God's got a plan and a mission for our
[1:03:30] lives. And that lady began to pour out
[1:03:32] her heart to Joah. Just kind of cornered
[1:03:34] her and and began to pour out uh the the
[1:03:38] need in her husband's life. Found out
[1:03:39] this week he had stage four prostate
[1:03:42] cancer. And so um Jo began to witness to
[1:03:46] her a little bit. She came out and they
[1:03:48] were at our greenhouse and and Joah
[1:03:50] said, "You we want to pray for you." And
[1:03:53] so I said, "What are we praying for?"
[1:03:55] And because I wasn't in there and she
[1:03:57] began to tell us and and just pouring
[1:03:59] out, you know, the devastating news and
[1:04:02] uh I said, 'Well, Joyce, did you tell
[1:04:03] her about Sister Donna? She said, 'N no,
[1:04:05] but I will. She began to tell her about
[1:04:08] Sister Donna. And I said, did you tell
[1:04:11] her about Brother Ron? She said, "No,
[1:04:12] but I will." So, we began to tell him
[1:04:15] about Brother Ron. I said that they gave
[1:04:16] him four months to live. He's been for
[1:04:18] five, five years now. brain cancer, lung
[1:04:21] cancer, bone cancer, well, you name it,
[1:04:23] it was all over. And she said, "What
[1:04:26] kind of church do y'all go to?"
[1:04:29] I said, "Well, I can tell you more." And
[1:04:32] uh so we begin to witness and just just
[1:04:34] prayed for them. And she said, "We we we
[1:04:37] used to go to we go to
[1:04:38] non-denominational church," she said.
[1:04:39] She said, "We I used to be a Baptist and
[1:04:42] we we went to church. That's all we ever
[1:04:43] did. Went to church. But we begin to
[1:04:45] pray. the anointing fell and and we laid
[1:04:48] hands on him and I thought she was going
[1:04:50] to run all over that field and scream
[1:04:52] and dancing. I mean, she was fixing to
[1:04:54] cut loose and but they they need a touch
[1:04:57] from God. And you know, the Bible tells
[1:04:59] us in in the book of Acts chapter 19, it
[1:05:02] said
[1:05:04] special miracles were done through Paul.
[1:05:08] How many's had a special miracle?
[1:05:10] Come on, church. We believe. Look at the
[1:05:13] hands all over the building. Special
[1:05:14] miracles. So if they took handkerchiefs
[1:05:17] from Paul who had special miracles done
[1:05:20] and they can lay those handkerchiefs on
[1:05:21] the people and those people would be
[1:05:23] made well. What makes us any different?
[1:05:26] Special miracles will be wrought by the
[1:05:28] people that God has working through. So
[1:05:31] we're going to we're going to pray over
[1:05:32] this handkerchief the needs of the
[1:05:34] people this morning and and we're just
[1:05:36] going to believe that special miracles
[1:05:38] will happen. How many believes that this
[1:05:41] morning? Hands all over the building.
[1:05:43] Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we
[1:05:45] come before you this morning, Lord, with
[1:05:47] grateful hearts, thankful we see and
[1:05:49] have heard testimonies, and we see the
[1:05:52] goodness and the good things that you do
[1:05:53] in our lives, Lord, and the miracles
[1:05:55] that's happened in this very church, the
[1:05:57] churches that we associate with,
[1:06:00] brothers and sisters of like precious
[1:06:02] faith. When we bind our faith together
[1:06:04] and we believe, we put the devil on the
[1:06:06] run. We put the devil on the run and we
[1:06:09] we we cast him aside. We get him out of
[1:06:12] our lives, Lord. We look at the
[1:06:14] testimonies, Sister Donna, Brother Ron,
[1:06:16] Sister Elena, Buts, and we could just go
[1:06:18] on and on and on of the things that
[1:06:20] you've done. So, we bring these needs
[1:06:22] before you. We We didn't know these
[1:06:24] people that we come in contact with, but
[1:06:27] she said before she left, she said,
[1:06:29] "This is the only this is the reason we
[1:06:31] came to see you. It wasn't about a
[1:06:33] business or a flower." She said, "This
[1:06:35] is the reason you prayed for us. You've
[1:06:38] encouraged us." And Lord, we just want
[1:06:40] the words of encouragement to go to
[1:06:41] them. We we lay our hands upon this
[1:06:44] handkerchief. We pray and we bind our
[1:06:46] faith as a congregation for this special
[1:06:49] need that special miracles will happen.
[1:06:52] You know the needs of the people here,
[1:06:53] Sister Aaliyah, Sister Hie, Little Hie.
[1:06:56] Lord, that the devil's trying to hold
[1:06:58] them down and and Lord, we just ask that
[1:07:00] you would move on the scene for Brother
[1:07:02] John, Sister Peggy, different ones,
[1:07:04] Sister Margie, the different ones,
[1:07:06] Sister Janette, and we could just keep
[1:07:07] going on. Lord, we're a needy people,
[1:07:10] Lord, but you're a great big God. You're
[1:07:13] a great big God that heals and delivers
[1:07:16] and sets the captives free this morning,
[1:07:18] Lord. So, we we bind our faith. We put
[1:07:21] Satan on the run. We rebuke him in the
[1:07:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ask
[1:07:25] that these special miracles would happen
[1:07:27] in these lives. We ask that you be in
[1:07:30] the remainder of the service. Bless this
[1:07:32] offering, Lord, and bless those that can
[1:07:34] give and those who cannot. Lord, we love
[1:07:36] you with all of our hearts and give you
[1:07:37] honor, praise, and glory for the
[1:07:40] testimonies that will come through this
[1:07:42] prayer, through these fa through through
[1:07:44] the binding of our faith. We give you
[1:07:46] the the glory before it we receive it,
[1:07:48] Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; For our
[1:07:58] transgressions.
[1:08:00] Oh yes.
[1:08:03] Oh, he was bruised
[1:08:05] for our iniquity.
[1:08:14] Oh, and surely
[1:08:17] he bore
[1:08:19] our sorrows
[1:08:25] and by
[1:08:28] his stripes we
[1:08:32] I like this verse. Oh, he has healed my
[1:08:37] sick soul,
[1:08:39] made me every
[1:08:43] widow,
[1:08:45] and he'll
[1:08:48] do the same
[1:08:50] for you. Oh yes.
[1:08:55] Oh, he's the same yesterday
[1:09:01] and today and for
[1:09:06] this Jesus
[1:09:10] of Calary.
[1:09:13] He was wounded once again this morning.
[1:09:16] Oh, and he was wounded
[1:09:21] for our
[1:09:23] transgression.
[1:09:28] Oh, he was praised for our uniquely.
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:36] Yes.
[1:09:39] Oh, and surely
[1:09:42] evil
[1:09:45] are sorrow
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:50] and by
[1:09:53] his stripes we
[1:09:56] are healed.
[1:09:59] Amen. You love him this morning. Amen.
[1:10:02] And I' I'd just like to give a little
[1:10:04] testimony if I could before we have
[1:10:07] brother Steve and them come sing this
[1:10:09] morning. And few weeks ago, we were
[1:10:11] playing volleyball out here. And of
[1:10:13] course, you know, I still think I'm
[1:10:14] young and my body keeps telling me I'm
[1:10:18] I'm I'm tired. And I spun around to try
[1:10:22] to hit the ball. And when I did, my leg
[1:10:25] just popped.
[1:10:27] And it got hard as a rock and I soaked
[1:10:30] it and everything. And about 3 days
[1:10:32] later, my whole foot turned black, blue,
[1:10:36] purple, and my toes. And and Janet told
[1:10:39] me, she said, "You know,
[1:10:41] you suffering with diabetes, all those
[1:10:43] things are dangerous for you." And she
[1:10:47] said, "You keep telling me you're going
[1:10:49] to quit.
[1:10:50] It's hard to retire."
[1:10:53] But, you know, and I just trusted the
[1:10:55] Lord and and you know, and I thought,
[1:10:59] God, you're a healer today.
[1:11:01] And I may not can play ever again in my
[1:11:05] life, but I want to thank him for
[1:11:07] touching my body this morning. And and
[1:11:09] there not been any problems. My toes
[1:11:11] have clean. They're not black, blue, and
[1:11:13] purple anymore. My foot's fine. And I
[1:11:15] just want to thank the Lord for watching
[1:11:17] over me. And, you know, God is good. And
[1:11:20] come ahead, Brother Steve, this morning.
[1:11:22] And amen. He's He's an awesome God. And
[1:11:26] you know, I I just I just love him this
[1:11:29] morning. And we appreciate him this
[1:11:30] morning, don't we? Amen.
[1:11:33] Amen. We've asked Brother Steve and
[1:11:35] Sister Becky to sing. And
[1:11:53] You didn't tell me
[1:12:17] [Music]
[1:12:51] What the
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:12] How many times
[1:13:17] must I prove how much I love you?

[1:13:35] How many times
[1:13:40] must I resue you from trouble for you to
[1:13:46] know just how much I love you.
[1:13:57] Didn't I wake you up this morning?
[1:14:02] [Music]
[1:14:04] in your right mind
[1:14:08] when you walked into a problem.
[1:14:14] And I still cry in a time
[1:14:19] when you got along life's journey.
[1:14:25] My angel carried you so you would know
[1:14:32] just how much I love you.
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; How many days
[1:14:47] must I be a fence all around you?
[1:14:54] How many nights
[1:14:58] must I wipe your tears
[1:15:02] away?
[1:15:05] How many storms
[1:15:09] must I bring you safely
[1:15:13] through for you to know just how much I
[1:15:20] love you.
[1:15:26] When I wake you up this morning,
[1:15:32] when you come to your right,
[1:15:37] when you walk into a problem,
[1:15:43] I step right in on time
[1:15:48] when you got weak. A long last journey
[1:15:54] my angel carried you so you would know
[1:16:00] just how much I love you.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Did I put food on your table
[1:16:15] and I showed up when your bills were
[1:16:18] due?
[1:16:21] Where the pain is in your body
[1:16:26] and Christ
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:31] when you were lost in sorrow.
[1:16:37] I died to set you free. So you would
[1:16:43] know just how much I love you.
[1:16:53] When I put food on your table,
[1:16:58] show up. And the pills were due.
[1:17:03] When the pain was striking your body,
[1:17:09] I said he bound to you.
[1:17:14] When you were lost in sin and sorrow,
[1:17:19] I died to set you free.
[1:17:24] You would know just how much I love you.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; So you would know.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; So you would know how much.
[1:17:46] So you would know.
[1:17:51] So you would know how much
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; So you would know just how much I
[1:18:04] love
[1:18:06] you.
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:21] [Applause]
[1:18:26] You know,
[1:18:27] that's an awesome song.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; That's one of my favorite songs.
[1:18:34] And you know, in the age we live in,
[1:18:37] there's not many wake up in their right
[1:18:38] mind anymore.
[1:18:41] but most of all
[1:18:43] that God chose you this morning.
[1:18:47] Brother Brandham said we should be the
[1:18:48] happiest people in the world this
[1:18:50] morning for all he's done for us this
[1:18:52] morning. I'm grateful. Aren't you this
[1:18:54] morning? Let's stand and let's just give
[1:18:56] the Lord a hand of praise this morning
[1:18:58] for his goodness and mercy. Amen. Thank
[1:19:01] you, Lord. Amen.
[1:19:04] Amen. We're going to ask Brother Tom to
[1:19:06] come this morning and Amen. We're going
[1:19:08] to sing that little chorus as Brother
[1:19:09] Thomas comes this morning. Thank you.
[1:19:12] Thank you, Lord, for saving me this
[1:19:14] morning. Well, thank you. Thank you,
[1:19:17] Lord, for saving me. Oh, yes.
[1:19:22] Oh, thank you. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:19:26] saving me.
[1:19:30] Once I was lost, now I'm found. Now my
[1:19:35] soul is heaven bound. Oh, thank you.
[1:19:38] Thank you, Lord, for saving me. Once
[1:19:42] again,
[1:19:43] oh, I say thank you. Thank you, Lord,
[1:19:47] for saving me. God bless you, Lord.
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:19:59] Once I was lost, I'm found. Now my soul
[1:20:04] is heaven bound. Thank you. Thank you,
[1:20:08] Lord, saving me.
[1:20:13] Oh, and I'm so glad
[1:20:17] that Jesus set me free.
[1:20:21] I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. Oh,
[1:20:28] I'm so glad that Jesus set me free.
[1:20:34] Singing glory hallelujah.
[1:20:38] Jesus set me free.
[1:20:41] Oh s had me bound.
[1:20:45] But Jesus set me free. Oh
[1:20:50] me bound.
[1:20:52] My Jesus set me free. Oh. Sing me bound.
[1:20:59] My Jesus set me free. Singing glory,
[1:21:04] hallelujah.
[1:21:06] Jesus set me free.
[1:21:09] I'm on my way to heaven.
[1:21:13] Shouting victory.
[1:21:16] I'm on my way to heaven.
[1:21:20] Shouting victory.
[1:21:23] I'm on my way. Heaven.
[1:21:27] Shouting victory.
[1:21:30] Sing and cry. Hallelujah.
[1:21:34] Jesus set me free.
[1:21:38] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:21:42] Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:21:48] Amen. I guess that's it. Thank you,
[1:21:50] musicians.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; I was thinking that. I was wondering if
[1:21:54] we had that last week and I just
[1:21:55] couldn't do it. All right, let's do have
[1:21:56] birthdays and anniversary. Thank you for
[1:21:58] reminding me, Brother Joe. Amen. You can
[1:22:00] be seated. All those that have a
[1:22:01] birthday in this month, if you want to
[1:22:03] come up. Amen. We'll sing for you.
[1:22:08] Amen.
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:17] A happy Oh, a happy birthday to you. A
[1:22:24] happy birthday to you. May you feel
[1:22:29] Jesus very near every day of the year. A
[1:22:34] happy birthday to you. A happy birthday
[1:22:40] to you and the best one you've ever
[1:22:46] had.
[1:22:48] Happy birthday, y'all. Amen. God bless
[1:22:50] you.
[1:22:55] Amen. How about anniversaries?
[1:22:58] Anybody get married in this month,
[1:23:00] September?
[1:23:37] There we go. That sounds better.
[1:23:41] A happy anniversary
[1:23:44] to you. A happy anniversary
[1:23:47] to you. May you feel all Jesus near
[1:23:53] every day of the year. A happy
[1:23:57] anniversary
[1:23:58] to you. A happy anniversary
[1:24:02] to you and the best one you've ever
[1:24:08] had.
[1:24:10] Happy anniversary. Yeah. Praise the
[1:24:12] Lord.
[1:24:14] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:24:18] Amen. And God is good, isn't he?
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand this morning. Amen. We
[1:24:24] want to remember Charlie Kirk and their
[1:24:27] family this morning. Amen. We uh
[1:24:31] know enough about him that that uh he
[1:24:34] went right in the face of the devil.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, he faced the devil down. So much
[1:24:41] so that he'd have to wear a bulletproof
[1:24:43] vest. Ain't that right? Yeah. Because of
[1:24:46] the threats. Ain't that right? So he
[1:24:48] wasn't afraid to get right out there and
[1:24:51] try to help them young people.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Try to tell them the truth.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So I have a lot of
[1:24:56] respect for the man. Amen. And you're
[1:24:59] certainly living in Bible days. Yeah.
[1:25:00] Isn't that right? Where evil tries to
[1:25:03] destroy good.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. And so from what I
[1:25:07] understand, the man was living with a a
[1:25:10] trans partner.
[1:25:12] So that tells you much a whole lot about
[1:25:14] the trans person. Is that right? are
[1:25:17] homosexual.
[1:25:19] If they'll do that, folks, if a man will
[1:25:21] live with a man or something like it,
[1:25:23] they'll do just about anything. I'll say
[1:25:26] this from the pulpit. They have no
[1:25:27] morality. You got no morality. Zero. I
[1:25:32] wouldn't trust you more than nothing.
[1:25:35] That's right. And it's sad.
[1:25:39] But we do pray for the man that did it.
[1:25:40] We pray that God will bring conviction
[1:25:42] on him. Ain't that right? We pray for
[1:25:44] him. We pray that God will save his
[1:25:45] soul. That's right. Perhaps you'll see
[1:25:47] that this man was willing to give his
[1:25:49] life for what he believed.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; When you do that, you've got something
[1:25:53] worthwhile
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; because I highly doubt he's got
[1:25:56] something worth giving his life for.
[1:25:58] Amen. So, we pray for him. We pray God
[1:26:00] save his soul. Is that right?
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Have mercy on him. Amen. But what he did
[1:26:06] was terrible. And so we want to just
[1:26:09] think about in a modern age in our own
[1:26:11] country where a Christian because he's a
[1:26:13] Christian and stands for Christ they
[1:26:15] took his life. Amen. So they if killed
[1:26:19] him martyed him because of that because
[1:26:21] of that. Amen. Because of his stands
[1:26:23] against these type of lifestyles and
[1:26:26] simply just telling the truth.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Nowadays telling the truth
[1:26:33] can get you killed. Ain't that right?
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; But that's okay. We're going to tell the
[1:26:37] truth anyway. I I don't care who hears
[1:26:39] it. I don't care if you like it or not.
[1:26:40] It's the truth and we're going to stand
[1:26:42] for it.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. We don't We don't give one
[1:26:45] bit one little care whether you don't
[1:26:47] like it.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; It's still the truth. It's always going
[1:26:49] to be the truth.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And it ain't going to change. We ain't
[1:26:52] going to change for people's opinion.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; We don't change for nobody. Amen. We
[1:26:59] stand with the Lord if it costs our
[1:27:00] lives.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; We would much rather die. Hello. than to
[1:27:05] give in to such scum and such such
[1:27:08] falseeness.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And such perversion. Ain't that
[1:27:13] right?
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. No way we would ever want
[1:27:16] to uh taint our souls with such things.
[1:27:20] Amen. It shows where the world is. So,
[1:27:23] let's have a moment of silence to
[1:27:25] remember
[1:27:26] Charlie Kirk.
[1:27:40] Lord Jesus, this morning we also
[1:27:42] remember his wife, his children, his
[1:27:44] family, Lord, that
[1:27:47] have to separate from him and suffer the
[1:27:50] loss and feel that emptiness and have to
[1:27:52] go through that, Lord. And we do pray
[1:27:54] for comfort for them, Lord, that they
[1:27:57] could believe that Charlie's over in
[1:27:59] heaven, knowing he's given his life for
[1:28:01] the gospel and for the cause of Christ.
[1:28:04] And we just pray for them in a special
[1:28:05] way that you'll bring comfort to that
[1:28:07] family now in Jesus name. Amen. And
[1:28:10] amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, good morning everybody.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Morning.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so we want to try to
[1:28:19] preach the message that we were going to
[1:28:21] Wednesday, but we just doesn't fill up
[1:28:23] the strength yet Wednesday. And we
[1:28:25] certainly hate to have cancelled, but
[1:28:26] after I cancelceled, I says, "Boy, I'm
[1:28:28] glad I did. I'm just going to rest."
[1:28:31] Amen. Because anyway, I uh I mean, how
[1:28:35] many know this is some pretty pretty
[1:28:36] strong stuff. Remember Caleb? I know
[1:28:38] he's had a got a bad way to go of it.
[1:28:40] And I know John, I think, got it maybe,
[1:28:42] you know, pretty bad, too. So, Amen. And
[1:28:45] so I don't know if any I don't know a
[1:28:48] lot of men are getting it. I do know
[1:28:49] that. But we just pray that God will
[1:28:51] give them strength. Give Caleb strength
[1:28:53] and John bring them back up. Amen. It's
[1:28:56] good to be in the house of the Lord. And
[1:28:57] so I've had plenty of time to study.
[1:29:00] Amen. And so kind of a new subject for
[1:29:03] me really. So Amen. We want to just see
[1:29:06] what the Lord will have for us this
[1:29:07] morning. I'd like to have a board
[1:29:09] meeting if I could, but Irvin, if you
[1:29:11] have to leave right after church, uh,
[1:29:13] unless you have to, let me know. But if
[1:29:15] you don't, Amen. I need the board. I'd
[1:29:17] like to talk to the board this this
[1:29:18] morning after service if you will. And
[1:29:21] also, we're not going to have communion
[1:29:22] this morning. Amen.
[1:29:24] Amen. Let's bow our heads, go before the
[1:29:26] Lord in prayer. Father, we come before
[1:29:27] you, Lord. We want to thank you, Lord,
[1:29:29] for being able to gather together, Lord,
[1:29:31] once again in your precious name,
[1:29:33] Father. Lord, and as we try to deliver
[1:29:36] what we feel you've laid upon our heart
[1:29:38] to speak, we Lord ask, God, that you
[1:29:40] just get me out of the way, Lord, and
[1:29:41] use your gift. Let the people operate
[1:29:43] the gift, God. Lord Jesus, and feed the
[1:29:46] sheep this morning, spiritual food. And
[1:29:49] Lord, truly help us to go from here
[1:29:51] closer to you, Father, than when we come
[1:29:54] in those doors, Lord Jesus. For we
[1:29:56] always want to leave better and not
[1:29:57] worse, Lord. And Father, we ask God
[1:29:59] you'll bless the reading of the word,
[1:30:01] meditation of our heart now, and bless
[1:30:02] those that are not feeling well. We
[1:30:04] believe that by your stripes they are
[1:30:06] healed. Thank you Lord for feeling
[1:30:08] better oursel Lord and brother different
[1:30:10] ones that have come out gotten over
[1:30:12] this. Thank you for health. Father we
[1:30:14] praise you for it. We ask these
[1:30:16] blessings in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:30:20] All right. So let's turn our Bibles if
[1:30:22] you will to 2 Corinthians 4. 2
[1:30:26] Corinthians the 4th chapter.
[1:30:28] Amen.
[1:30:30] Amen. And do you um
[1:30:34] uh let me see. We'll put that title up
[1:30:36] in a minute.
[1:30:38] 2 Corinthians 4
[1:30:48] verse 16. For which cause we faint not,
[1:30:52] but through our though our outward man
[1:30:55] perish, yet the inward man is renewed
[1:30:58] day by day. for our light affliction
[1:31:01] which is but for a moment workketh for
[1:31:03] us a far more exceeding and eternal
[1:31:06] weight of glory. While we look not at
[1:31:10] things which are seen, but at the things
[1:31:12] which are not seen. For the things which
[1:31:14] are seen are temporal, but the things
[1:31:17] which are not seen are eternal. Amen.
[1:31:20] May God bless the reading of the word.
[1:31:22] You can be seated this morning. My title
[1:31:24] this morning is going to be reality
[1:31:28] check.
[1:31:29] reality check. Amen. I think we're all
[1:31:33] familiar with the phrase, isn't that
[1:31:34] right? Amen. Reality check. Sometimes we
[1:31:38] need a reality check. And we want to
[1:31:40] talk about that for a little bit. Amen.
[1:31:42] Amen. Brother Brad, get my phone, would
[1:31:45] you? Amen. I did have something there
[1:31:47] that I wanted to bring out. I didn't
[1:31:49] think I had anything on there, but now
[1:31:50] that I'm starting on this, I do have
[1:31:53] something I want to try to pull up.
[1:31:54] basically the definition of reality.
[1:31:58] Amen. What Siri says about what the re
[1:32:02] what uh the definition of reality is.
[1:32:05] Amen. And it says it this way. Um it
[1:32:09] says the world or the state of things as
[1:32:13] they actually exist.
[1:32:15] Amen. as opposed to an idealistic
[1:32:20] an ide idealistic or notional idea of
[1:32:24] them. A thing that is actually
[1:32:26] experienced. I like that. A thing that
[1:32:29] is actually experienced or seen. Is that
[1:32:33] right? Amen. Especially when this uh
[1:32:38] Okay. And then the next one is a thing
[1:32:40] that exists in fact. In other words, the
[1:32:43] truth. Is that right? some facts. Amen.
[1:32:47] Something that's real. Amen. Having
[1:32:50] previously only existed in one's mind.
[1:32:59] The quality of being liike or resembling
[1:33:03] an original. Amen. So something that's
[1:33:07] real. I just want to say something
[1:33:09] that's real. Amen. Because if we're
[1:33:12] living in a world where there's very
[1:33:14] very many things, it's not real.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll start with saying this.
[1:33:20] Brother Bram said, "Even us looking at
[1:33:22] each other." He says, "You look at each
[1:33:24] other and see Troy, I see you." What did
[1:33:27] Brother Bram say? No, you never seen
[1:33:28] Troy.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. We think we see
[1:33:32] each other. It looks real to me.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; But yet, Brother Bram said, "No, you've
[1:33:37] never really seen each other. The only
[1:33:40] thing that you see is the house that
[1:33:42] you're living in.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Why? Because how many know this here
[1:33:45] house here it's made out of dust. In
[1:33:48] other words, if you went out there and
[1:33:49] really dry right now and you grab a
[1:33:51] handful of dust and the Bible says we
[1:33:53] come from dust and we go back to dust.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; You come from dirt and you go back to
[1:33:58] dirt. You know, so and and I think it
[1:34:01] was Peter one place says our life is our
[1:34:04] even our very life is like a vapor which
[1:34:06] appears for a while. It's like a mist,
[1:34:09] right? A vapor is like a mist. It's
[1:34:12] comes for a while and then it's gone.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Not real.
[1:34:18] Not real. And and Paul here explaining
[1:34:21] it. Brother Brandon when he preached
[1:34:23] this message of what I that I'm that I I
[1:34:26] pulled some quotes out of called the uh
[1:34:28] the unfailing reality of the living God.
[1:34:32] The re unfailing realities of the living
[1:34:34] God. Amen.
[1:34:38] And so
[1:34:40] we want to start amen with first a
[1:34:44] prayer or a little as he was approaching
[1:34:47] scripture one place he says it this way.
[1:34:50] Amen.
[1:34:52] Something that's real and something
[1:34:54] that's not real. Now we want to approach
[1:34:56] this my friends sainely reverently and
[1:35:00] scripturally.
[1:35:01] It must come from the scriptures. And if
[1:35:04] it's not in the scriptures and the
[1:35:06] meaning is not carried, can we say this
[1:35:09] morning on absolutely biblical and
[1:35:13] scripturally, then it's wrong.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; It's just some makeup. It's mystical.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; It's not real.
[1:35:26] So even if a church service isn't
[1:35:28] carried out according to the scripture,
[1:35:30] it's a myth.
[1:35:33] Not real.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Wow. How many believe it has to be
[1:35:37] according to the scriptures?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Has to be according to the
[1:35:42] scriptures or it's just a myth. It's not
[1:35:45] reality.
[1:35:50] Oh my.
[1:35:53] The whole world is living outside of
[1:35:57] reality.
[1:36:00] They need a reality check.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; How many believes the world needs a
[1:36:06] reality check? Sometimes we need a
[1:36:08] reality check.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:17] Amen.
[1:36:20] Mystical, but it's not real. He said
[1:36:24] it's not real. Even a service is not
[1:36:26] real.
[1:36:28] And I'll just go ahead and take my time.
[1:36:30] Is that okay? We'll just go down this
[1:36:33] road a little bit because brother Bram
[1:36:34] said that the church world is doing God
[1:36:37] a service without it being his will.
[1:36:43] When you're doing something outside of
[1:36:45] the will of God, hello. Then you're just
[1:36:48] doing some dream. You're having some
[1:36:50] dream, doing something mystical. It's
[1:36:51] not really real.
[1:36:53] And I'll go ahead and go right really,
[1:36:55] really deep here.
[1:36:58] Because even on that day, because it
[1:37:00] goes real deep, we'll get there. But
[1:37:02] even on that day, many will come to me
[1:37:03] and say, "Haven't we cast out devils?
[1:37:05] Haven't we spoken tongues? Haven't we
[1:37:07] all these things?" Well, I never knew
[1:37:08] you.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; How many know you were? They were living
[1:37:12] in a fantasy world.
[1:37:15] They were not living in reality. They
[1:37:17] weren't deceived. Amen.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; How many believes that that day on that
[1:37:24] day there's going to be a real reality
[1:37:26] check on the day of judgment? Folks, you
[1:37:28] can deceive yourself and everything else
[1:37:31] you want over here, but there's a
[1:37:32] reality check coming for the whole
[1:37:34] world.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Everybody's going to have a reality
[1:37:38] check. Oh, there is no God. There is no
[1:37:41] hell. You're in for some real a real
[1:37:44] crude awakening.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:49] And I'll just go ahead and say this that
[1:37:51] if you're religion and you believe this
[1:37:53] message in your mind, you're still
[1:37:55] living in a mystical world.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; It has to be more than just some
[1:37:59] psychology. It has to be more than just
[1:38:02] in your mind. It has to be a reality.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] Brother Brandham, he used the scripture
[1:38:16] of the woman at the well when he
[1:38:17] preached his unfailing realities because
[1:38:20] his woman was thirsting, right? Isn't
[1:38:21] that right? Drawing water. I'll give you
[1:38:24] water, you never thirst again. Water
[1:38:27] you're drinking now, you're going to get
[1:38:28] thirsty again. It's never going to
[1:38:29] satisfy you. Isn't that right? How many
[1:38:32] believe a lot of people live in that
[1:38:34] world of drinking water that never
[1:38:36] satisfied?
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; What did he say over in Isaiah 56
[1:38:41] somewhere over there? Oh ho, everyone
[1:38:43] that thirsts and everybody that hungers
[1:38:44] and so forth, come. I'll give you drink.
[1:38:47] I'll give you food. I'll give you food
[1:38:49] and drink. Amen. That you come not to
[1:38:51] buy. You don't have to buy. Just come
[1:38:52] and get. Ain't that right?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; And uh you'll be satisfied. And this
[1:38:57] woman, she had she needed to be
[1:38:58] satisfied. And so he used that one. And
[1:39:00] then he makes a statement. We're just
[1:39:02] going to start here. In the days when g
[1:39:04] of Jesus of Nazareth when he was here on
[1:39:06] earth walking in flesh, he found the
[1:39:09] people in his day seeking a religion
[1:39:12] that would bring them deliverance. They
[1:39:13] wanted a religion that would deliver
[1:39:15] them from all of their evils and their
[1:39:17] enemies. And Christianity met every
[1:39:20] challenge that they asked for.
[1:39:26] Christianity met every thing that they
[1:39:30] needed and everything that they asked
[1:39:32] for. It challenged everyone of their
[1:39:36] needs.
[1:39:38] I was going to read this here at the
[1:39:39] end, but I'm going to bring it in here
[1:39:40] because it's a pretty good time to bring
[1:39:42] it in. It challenged everyone of their
[1:39:44] need, but they would not receive it.
[1:39:51] Listen.
[1:39:54] He says uh God, he's omnipotent. He's
[1:39:58] all power. That's the kind of God that
[1:40:01] we serve. It's not some pagan idol. It
[1:40:05] is a living resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:40:08] Christ.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, which is the spirit of
[1:40:11] the Lord Jesus that covers the whole
[1:40:13] earth that he that he would be
[1:40:15] everywhere, knows all things. He's got
[1:40:18] all wisdom and power. What a wonderful
[1:40:21] God. He says, "And and to know that not
[1:40:24] it's not just some makeup.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; It's just not somebody's theology, but
[1:40:31] he lives in us,
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; chose himself, proves himself alive. Oh,
[1:40:36] we ought to be here. We should not be or
[1:40:40] should we not be the most happiest
[1:40:42] people in the world?"
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our hearts should be racing
[1:40:46] swiftly traveling around the world and
[1:40:49] seeing different nations and their gods
[1:40:50] and their idols and so forth and all the
[1:40:53] philosophies and to know all of their
[1:40:55] foolishness.
[1:40:57] Amen. There's not one of them. Their
[1:40:59] founders are dead and in the grave and
[1:41:01] gone. The only one that can prove their
[1:41:03] leader is alive and remain is this
[1:41:06] gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:09] Amen. Listen. But when our God, our
[1:41:12] Jesus comes on the scene and does the
[1:41:14] same things that he did when he was here
[1:41:16] before, that proves that he lives. He's
[1:41:19] not dead. How many know that
[1:41:20] Christianity is the only real religion?
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Everything else is a myth.
[1:41:29] I hope everybody out there hears that
[1:41:31] there's no other correct religion out of
[1:41:34] Jesus Christ, the son of the living God.
[1:41:37] None. They're every last one of them
[1:41:40] dead. They're everyone a myth.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; And people love a myth. People love to
[1:41:48] live in unreality, if there's such a
[1:41:51] word.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; People love to live there. And it's sad,
[1:41:58] but people love to live in something
[1:42:01] that's actually a phony
[1:42:03] than the real thing.
[1:42:10] Oh my.
[1:42:12] So he says they didn't want it then.
[1:42:14] They didn't want and it's about the same
[1:42:16] today. Back to our quote. We find people
[1:42:19] like it was then seeking a religion
[1:42:21] that'll do something for them that'll
[1:42:24] bring some reality to them.
[1:42:28] Amen.
[1:42:32] And true Christianity meets every one of
[1:42:35] those challenges.
[1:42:37] How many glad for that this morning? But
[1:42:40] they don't receive it. There's a lot of
[1:42:42] different reasons, but we'll touch a
[1:42:44] couple. They just don't want it. It's
[1:42:46] the nature of the people. Now, I'm not
[1:42:48] speaking to the bornag again church. I'm
[1:42:50] speaking to the nation and the country
[1:42:52] as a whole. They just don't seem to want
[1:42:55] it. Because see, if you really want
[1:42:57] anything, you can't rest till you get
[1:42:59] it.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; How many glad that you want something
[1:43:06] real?
[1:43:07] [Applause]
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; I want the real McCoy, Brother Urban,
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; how many wants the real McCoy?
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; As we put it, I want the real thing.
[1:43:22] Don't sell me no substitute because the
[1:43:24] devil, man, he offers people all kinds
[1:43:27] of substitutes.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Substitute joy,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; substitute peace,
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; substitute salvation,
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; substitute religions.
[1:43:42] As a matter of fact, all whose names are
[1:43:45] not written in the Lamb's book of life
[1:43:48] shall wander after the beast.
[1:43:52] That's right. The whole world
[1:43:54] wanders after the beast, after the
[1:43:56] deceiver. And I'll tell you why. Why do
[1:43:59] people not want the real thing?
[1:44:03] Why do why do they not want to have have
[1:44:06] reality?
[1:44:14] You can go to people and tell them that
[1:44:16] Jesus Christ came in this hour and did
[1:44:18] exactly what he did when he was here
[1:44:20] walking on the face of the earth. He
[1:44:22] discerned the thoughts and intents of
[1:44:24] the heart. He healed the sick, raised
[1:44:26] the dead, and he did it in his body. And
[1:44:28] they don't want to hear it. They want
[1:44:29] their church.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; They want their religion.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to this.
[1:44:43] But today, people are trying to give
[1:44:45] people something that they really need
[1:44:47] and they don't want to accept it. They
[1:44:49] just don't want it. And the attitude of
[1:44:52] the people hasn't changed. And yet, that
[1:44:55] is exactly what the world needs today.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; How many knows that Christ has provided
[1:45:01] everybody with exact I like that exactly
[1:45:06] what they have need of.
[1:45:10] Aren't you glad for that?
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; We don't have to wonder whether the
[1:45:14] Baptist or the Methodists or the Menite
[1:45:17] or the Amish or any of those. We don't
[1:45:19] have to wonder about whether they're
[1:45:21] right or not.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; We don't wonder. Hey, maybe I ought to
[1:45:24] belong to that one. Maybe I No, you
[1:45:26] ain't got to wonder that cuz Christ came
[1:45:28] and proved himself
[1:45:31] and took us back to the word. There's no
[1:45:33] doubt in our minds and how happy we
[1:45:36] ought to be
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; to have the resurrected Christ. Not just
[1:45:40] in brother Bham, but in our amongst us
[1:45:42] this morning.
[1:45:48] Exactly what the world needs is the
[1:45:50] religion of Jesus Christ. Deliverance
[1:45:53] from the things that they're fearing and
[1:45:55] dreading and have need to be delivered
[1:45:57] of.
[1:45:59] Oh my, it's just like it was back then.
[1:46:01] the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the
[1:46:03] Herodians, and all these different sex
[1:46:05] of religions that they had. Amen.
[1:46:08] So he comes down here,
[1:46:11] he says, "But when he comes in his power
[1:46:14] of his resurrection to make people live
[1:46:17] and act and behave themselves and change
[1:46:20] their attitudes,
[1:46:22] change their ways, change their living.
[1:46:25] They don't want nothing to do with
[1:46:27] that."
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:46:31] Do you want to live the way they want to
[1:46:32] live?
[1:46:34] Thinking man's filtered. Brother Bam
[1:46:36] says there's so many different churches
[1:46:38] out there. You can go out there and you
[1:46:41] can have just about whatever you have a
[1:46:42] taste for. The devil will provide you
[1:46:46] for it.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; And people have a taste for stagnation.
[1:46:50] They don't like a church that's alive.
[1:46:52] They like somebody that's quiet. They
[1:46:54] don't want to have your the neighbors
[1:46:55] and everybody around them screaming and
[1:46:56] hollering, "Woo! Praise be to God." They
[1:46:59] might be under pressure to need to do a
[1:47:01] little debt themselves.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; They don't want to be rebuked for being
[1:47:07] cold and lukewarm and and all of this.
[1:47:09] No, they like their lukewarm living.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; They like to live the way they want to
[1:47:17] live and still claim God and still be
[1:47:19] religious.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; That's their taste.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram describes it very
[1:47:28] well. He was a prophet. He would, right?
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; That's why I like to read it.
[1:47:34] They want to live the way they want to
[1:47:35] live. They want to continue right on
[1:47:36] living the way they have always lived,
[1:47:39] but yet very religious. Go to church, be
[1:47:42] a member thereof. Amen. They can go to
[1:47:44] Sunday morning, whatever time it is, and
[1:47:46] about 15 minutes sermon from the pastor.
[1:47:48] They walk away from there kind of
[1:47:50] halfway feeling satisfied that they've
[1:47:52] done their religion for the week. God
[1:47:54] help us. How many I hope nobody's like
[1:47:56] that here this morning. We didn't just
[1:47:58] come here about 15 minutes. Amen. That
[1:48:00] through our religion. We come here to
[1:48:02] worship the Lord. We come here to praise
[1:48:04] God. We come here to tell the truth.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We come here to get washed. We get
[1:48:12] come here to have our sins forgiven. We
[1:48:14] come here to walk away with the baptism
[1:48:16] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not a longer lover of stagnation.
[1:48:24] When there's no hallelujah, there's no
[1:48:25] praise. Amen. and the preacher can't
[1:48:27] preach, I get a little worried.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; No, we like that fresh water bubbling
[1:48:35] up.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many likes that fresh water?
[1:48:40] That spring of water.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; People are living in the glare of
[1:48:44] another age. Brother Bam says, "Oh,
[1:48:46] those churches, they're living in
[1:48:47] Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and some day
[1:48:50] going by they're living in a mirage.
[1:48:53] Amen. It looks like though there's water
[1:48:55] on the road up ahead from the heat. Hey,
[1:48:57] there's water up there. Be careful. But
[1:48:59] you never get there. There's never no
[1:49:00] water. Amen. It's a myth. It's a mirage.
[1:49:04] That's where they're living. They're
[1:49:05] living in a mirage. The glare of another
[1:49:08] age, not the real thing.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; They like that. feel kind of like they
[1:49:22] did their religion but still go out
[1:49:23] there dirty.
[1:49:25] Still go out there with the same desire
[1:49:27] that they had.
[1:49:29] Oh, it's in this message. You ought to
[1:49:30] go listen to it. Brother Bam says, "Man,
[1:49:32] if God, if the your nature hasn't been
[1:49:34] changed and you still got the same
[1:49:35] desires, amen, that you had before, I
[1:49:38] wonder what you got." But I don't
[1:49:40] believe it was the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:41] Ghost.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; No. When the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:47] becomes, it changes your nature. That's
[1:49:49] right.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; And many people will be deceived. But
[1:49:51] Bam said there's going to be millions
[1:49:53] and billions of mimics of Christianity.
[1:49:56] They're not going to be the real thing.
[1:49:59] They're going to be phony. They're going
[1:50:00] to be fake Christians.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Mimics
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; acting like somebody else. He says, "God
[1:50:09] speed today that we are what we are. Act
[1:50:11] like who you are. Not trying to
[1:50:12] impersonate somebody else. Be real.
[1:50:17] be yourself.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Everybody trying to act like somebody
[1:50:24] else
[1:50:26] impersonating and everything else mimics
[1:50:30] a lot of phony out there. A lot of
[1:50:32] things, a lot of people that claim to be
[1:50:33] Christians aren't really Christians.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. As I was studying, I say, "You
[1:50:40] better watch your neighbor who you sit
[1:50:42] by." Amen. Because if they aren't
[1:50:44] genuinely really born again, be careful.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. They're not going to think
[1:50:50] right. They're not going to talk right.
[1:50:51] They're not going to lead you right.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Birds of a feather flock together. If
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; you can't get along with one another,
[1:51:04] there's somebody got the wrong spirit.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Message people ought to love
[1:51:09] message people. Amen. We ought to be
[1:51:12] filled with the Holy Ghost. We can get
[1:51:13] along.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; We can say we're sorry.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; We can apologize. We got enough of the
[1:51:25] Holy Ghost in us to tell us when we're
[1:51:26] wrong.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; We got enough of the Holy Ghost about us
[1:51:32] to repent if we need to repent.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Get right. Don't keep going down the
[1:51:36] same road.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank be to God.
[1:51:43] Amen.
[1:51:46] That's what he said. Just enough to make
[1:51:49] them feel kind of halfway satisfied that
[1:51:52] they've done their religion for their
[1:51:54] week. That settles it. Go back and do
[1:51:56] anything they want to the rest of the
[1:51:58] week.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:07] But like back in the Old Testament,
[1:52:11] right?
[1:52:12] go do their religion, sacrifice their
[1:52:14] lambs,
[1:52:16] s make their sacrifices, but still go
[1:52:18] out the door the same nature that they
[1:52:21] had before.
[1:52:23] Do you realize this morning that God in
[1:52:25] the Old Testament, he was kind of a myth
[1:52:27] to people, the father above us, he was
[1:52:29] out there somewhere and nobody really
[1:52:31] understood who God is or what he was or
[1:52:34] what he was like.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; What is this God like?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Do you wonder what it was really like?
[1:52:41] Amen. He come down on a mountain and
[1:52:44] Amen. and fire and smoke and earthquake
[1:52:47] and scared him to death. He said, "Don't
[1:52:48] let God speak. Let Moses speak." And
[1:52:51] ever since that time, God has always
[1:52:53] used prophets. He's always used the
[1:52:56] instrumentality of man.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; How many believes he does this morning?
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; God just changes his mask.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it was just a mystical
[1:53:09] something. But when Jesus Christ came,
[1:53:12] what happened?
[1:53:14] I'll tell you what happened,
[1:53:18] when this mystical God,
[1:53:22] this thoughts of people's imaginations
[1:53:24] of what God was like, express himself
[1:53:28] come down.
[1:53:31] Amen. When the beginning was the word,
[1:53:32] the word was with God, the word was God.
[1:53:35] But when the word became flesh,
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; now it's a different story.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; That word becoming flesh.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 1 and3 says, "He who being the
[1:53:49] brightness of his glory and the
[1:53:51] expressed image of his person."
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; How many believe that Jesus Christ was
[1:53:56] the express image of God?
[1:54:01] The way that he lived, the way that he
[1:54:02] loved, the mercy that he had, and the
[1:54:04] grace that he had, it expressed God. You
[1:54:07] could see God.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; But Peter and all of them were still
[1:54:15] living in a myth.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; They were still living in a dream world.
[1:54:19] E, even though they were sanctified,
[1:54:21] even though they were justified, hello.
[1:54:25] They just hadn't got filled yet.
[1:54:29] They weren't converted yet.
[1:54:32] Amen. How many believe that? Because
[1:54:35] even Jesus said, "When you're converted,
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; young people, you can't just get
[1:54:41] reformed. You have to get converted."
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; A conversion.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:49] So that's why Peter, if you think about
[1:54:52] it, said the same things that he said.
[1:54:54] He'd always open up his mouth and
[1:54:56] without the Holy Ghost speaking, you're
[1:54:58] bound to say the wrong thing.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; He'd always be saying the wrong thing.
[1:55:03] But there Christ was there. God was
[1:55:06] a reality.
[1:55:08] When the dead were raised, it was a
[1:55:09] reality. When the lepers were cleansed,
[1:55:12] it was a reality.
[1:55:14] It was real.
[1:55:17] Amen.
[1:55:19] Let me just go backwards a little bit.
[1:55:21] How many knows? And uh I'll pick this
[1:55:23] back up again. Let's go way, way, way
[1:55:26] back. Amen. Back to Eve. Eve and Adam.
[1:55:31] They lived, could speak to trees, speak
[1:55:35] to nature. It would do it.
[1:55:38] Never had a feebleness. They never had
[1:55:40] to deal with sugar, blood pressure, old
[1:55:42] age, or feebleness.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my. No feebleness. Perfect strife.
[1:55:48] Yeah.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Felt perfectly good all the time, right?
[1:55:55] We don't feel like that. The days are
[1:55:57] shorter and less of feeling that energy.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I like that
[1:56:02] energy.
[1:56:07] Some of us are smiling because we know,
[1:56:09] Amen. As you get older, there's less of
[1:56:11] it.
[1:56:13] You appreciate it more. You young
[1:56:15] people, you enjoy being young.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Jump. Holler. Yeah.
[1:56:21] Yeah. One of these days you're going to
[1:56:23] be going.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Old age really stinks, don't it?
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Ain't no fun.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; All of those 18 years, 20 years of that
[1:56:42] vibrance and that energy. Don't worry,
[1:56:45] you'll pay for it.
[1:56:49] You have about 20 years old
[1:56:52] or however long you get to be sagging
[1:56:54] around at the old age. Hello.
[1:56:57] So enjoy it while you can.
[1:57:00] But they had reality. Isn't that right?
[1:57:02] They had reality had life. And what did
[1:57:04] the devil do? He brought in a fake
[1:57:06] reality.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; And Eve believed it.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many know the devil said,
[1:57:13] "Thou shalt not surely die." But when
[1:57:15] she began to get wrinkles and she got
[1:57:17] old and she was immortal, she that was a
[1:57:20] reality check for her. Reality check was
[1:57:24] God's word is true. How many believes
[1:57:27] that the world needs a reality check
[1:57:30] that this Bible is the truth.
[1:57:33] [Applause]
[1:57:36] This is reality. Everything is not
[1:57:40] reality.
[1:57:41] It's a dream. It's a myth. It's fake.
[1:57:45] It's not real.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Even Paul said the things that we seen
[1:57:49] Amen. Amen. are are temporal.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; They're not real. Only the things that
[1:57:54] you don't see are real.
[1:58:02] Amen.
[1:58:06] Brother Brandon was preaching up in
[1:58:08] Canada and that soldier that was healed
[1:58:11] the night before couldn't walk and
[1:58:13] different things and he was healed. The
[1:58:16] next day, Brother Brandon was walking
[1:58:17] down the street and there was a salesman
[1:58:18] there, TV salesman. You all remember the
[1:58:20] story and he got to talking to this TV
[1:58:23] salesman and some cowboy dude and you
[1:58:26] know and he got to talking to him and
[1:58:28] and he said, "Let me sell you one of
[1:58:30] these TVs." and so forth. No, I'm just
[1:58:33] passing through. Brother Bram says, "I'm
[1:58:36] just here for the meetings." "Oh, you
[1:58:38] ain't with that Brandon Bunch, are you?"
[1:58:40] "Yeah, I'm with that Brandon Bunch." He
[1:58:42] says, "Well," he says, "Didn't you ever
[1:58:44] see it?" He says, "What do you think
[1:58:45] about that discernment and all of that?"
[1:58:47] He says, "I think it's all mental
[1:58:48] psychology."
[1:58:50] Called him a hypocrite or something like
[1:58:52] that or real bad names and so forth.
[1:58:57] Amen. Kept talking. Kept talking.
[1:59:00] And come to find out he realized brother
[1:59:02] Brandon was a preacher. I just called
[1:59:04] you a hypocrite or something what it was
[1:59:06] mythal the tele telepathy or whatever.
[1:59:08] And he says right to your face. He said
[1:59:09] well I'd rather hear you tell tell it to
[1:59:11] my face than anywhere else.
[1:59:13] And then later on he brother Bam said I
[1:59:15] said yeah a fellow said to me not long
[1:59:17] ago he said brother Bham he said
[1:59:19] anything that's not scientifically
[1:59:21] proven is not real.
[1:59:24] Now, I said, I'll just contradict that,
[1:59:26] brother, and say that anything that is
[1:59:28] scientifically proven isn't real.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, it's not eternal.
[1:59:36] There'll come a day when it will cease
[1:59:38] to exist. It'll be gone. It's not real.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, that sounds don't sound
[1:59:47] intelligent." I said, "I know it don't
[1:59:49] sound intelligent, but it's correct
[1:59:51] intelligence.
[1:59:52] Amen.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; It's correct intelligence.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; You think you're alive,
[2:00:02] just let some time go by. We'll put you
[2:00:04] in a box and bury you. That's how alive
[2:00:06] you are.
[2:00:09] How many knows that even this life here
[2:00:11] is death?
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Remember that woman in the hotel? Oh,
[2:00:15] this is life. She said, no, it's not.
[2:00:17] It's death.
[2:00:20] Bible says we were we were in we who
[2:00:23] were dead in sins and trespasses. He
[2:00:26] that hath the son hath life. He that
[2:00:28] hath not the son had not life. In other
[2:00:31] words, you're dead.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; You're not really alive.
[2:00:38] What do you think these Hollywood stars
[2:00:41] and all their money and all their beauty
[2:00:43] and they made it as a star, but they'll
[2:00:45] disfigure their face and look like a
[2:00:48] pumpkin of some kind blowing their lips
[2:00:50] up and their cheeks up and look freaky
[2:00:53] as all get out. Yeah, that's right. I
[2:00:55] hope you're listening.
[2:00:57] Why? Because you're not satisfied with
[2:00:59] how you look. How did you get to be a
[2:01:01] movie star in the first place? It wasn't
[2:01:03] with the new look you got.
[2:01:09] Why? It's because there's something
[2:01:11] empty in here.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; They're dead.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Why do you think people are not happy
[2:01:18] with their one wife or their one
[2:01:20] husband? Because they're dead. They're
[2:01:22] empty.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Felio love isn't real either.
[2:01:28] Felio love, brother Bam says, will turn
[2:01:30] to hate. And hate turns to murder. How
[2:01:33] many of them will murder your wife?
[2:01:35] murder their husbands.
[2:01:38] Hello. But agape love is real.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Agape love won't divorce his wife and go
[2:01:46] love won't divorce your husband because
[2:01:48] you're living higher than Felio.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; How many believe that's what we need? We
[2:01:52] need the real love of God.
[2:01:57] It's real.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:01] So, we see here that anything you see
[2:02:05] isn't real. It's only the things that we
[2:02:09] don't say
[2:02:12] that's real.
[2:02:16] Amen.
[2:02:19] All right.
[2:02:25] So, he says that don't sound but it's
[2:02:27] correct intelligence. The real things of
[2:02:29] life cannot be scientifically proven. He
[2:02:32] said, "If it isn't scientifically
[2:02:34] proven, I can't accept it." I said, "Are
[2:02:36] you a married man?" He said, "Yes, sir."
[2:02:38] "You love your wife?" "Yes."
[2:02:39] "Scientifically, tell me what love is.
[2:02:41] What part of you? Pull it out here and
[2:02:43] analyze it."
[2:02:47] Hello. Got him already.
[2:02:50] Just one question. One question. Come
[2:02:54] on. Scientifically proved love to me.
[2:02:56] Ain't no way.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Prove scientifically you got a mind. Got
[2:03:05] to take your word for it.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go a little bit faster
[2:03:10] here.
[2:03:12] And I said, "Have you got any mind?" He
[2:03:13] said, "Certainly." I said,
[2:03:14] "Scientifically, show me what your mind
[2:03:16] is." Can't be done. Certainly. He says,
[2:03:20] "But listen, but what's real? Love is
[2:03:24] real.
[2:03:26] Joy is real.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; You might not be able to see it see it,
[2:03:32] but we can sure see the effects of it.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; When we get a little happy, you can see,
[2:03:36] hey, boy, that person's happy. That
[2:03:38] person has some joy.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Long suffering, peace is real.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Goodness, gentleness, patience, all
[2:03:51] those are God and they're the real
[2:03:53] thing.
[2:03:55] Amen. The scientific things are
[2:03:57] perishable, come from the earth. Amen.
[2:04:00] But the unscientific things are the real
[2:04:02] things that come from heaven. God, the
[2:04:06] Holy Spirit.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; How many believe the Holy Spirit? It's
[2:04:12] real.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; How many's got it?
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. and blew it off again. No, that's
[2:04:24] the old one. All right.
[2:04:27] All right.
[2:04:29] Hallelujah.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Angels all around us campus around us.
[2:04:35] How many believes that?
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:40] I love the way brother Dwayne Lawson
[2:04:42] preached on angels and bring quotes out
[2:04:44] where brother Bam says of sister all of
[2:04:46] a sudden just something comes over and
[2:04:49] oh my you know and he says it was angels
[2:04:52] wings
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; rubbing up against them giving you that
[2:04:56] extra inspiration.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe we got angels
[2:05:03] around us influencing us
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; trying to wave us on?
[2:05:10] Amen. Supernatural.
[2:05:14] They are the everlasting things. Amen.
[2:05:17] Believe on the Lord. Don't just try to
[2:05:19] scientifically
[2:05:20] Amen. Prove it. Amen.
[2:05:23] Praise the Lord. Every essential thing
[2:05:25] about us is unseen. How many believes
[2:05:29] that? Every essential thing.
[2:05:34] what people won't go through to have
[2:05:37] joy.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; People will marry a husband, a wife,
[2:05:48] thinking, "Oh, I'm going to be happy
[2:05:49] with a husband and wife. I'm going to be
[2:05:50] happy with marriage." Until reality sets
[2:05:52] in.
[2:05:54] Hello.
[2:05:56] And it's maybe not as cozy as what you
[2:05:58] thought it was. And you need realize you
[2:06:00] need something more than a mate.
[2:06:02] You need something that satisfies you
[2:06:05] already.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Then God will add that to you and it'll
[2:06:09] be the next best thing to what you got.
[2:06:11] But don't rely on those things for
[2:06:13] happiness and joy.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; No, there's only one true happiness,
[2:06:18] only one real joy,
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; and that is the baptism of the Holy
[2:06:22] Ghost in your heart.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; And in your soul. Outside of that, it's
[2:06:27] all a substitute. People will do drugs
[2:06:30] and doing drugs out there for try to
[2:06:32] have a little good feeling to feel good.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; I ain't got to do no drugs. I ain't got
[2:06:42] to drink no beer
[2:06:44] and I feel good.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Guess what? I won't wake up with a
[2:06:48] hangover. They will. And they'll wake up
[2:06:51] empty and they'll have to go back then
[2:06:53] the next day and try to do the same
[2:06:55] thing. and drug upon drug and never
[2:06:57] satisfied. Amen. Until blisters and
[2:06:59] boils and everything, amen, their skin
[2:07:01] falls off them and they rot in their
[2:07:03] flesh trying to find joy
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; when God and Christianity has already
[2:07:08] provided it for them.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; But they want a substitute rather than
[2:07:12] the real thing.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:20] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:25] You love him.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; So we go back to our story. Jesus Christ
[2:07:31] when he was here.
[2:07:33] We He was the expressed image of God.
[2:07:38] He was God in flesh.
[2:07:41] He was reality.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; In flesh.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; That's what we want this morning.
[2:07:53] I could have titled it that reality in
[2:07:56] flesh
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; because the word
[2:08:03] is reality
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; and the word was made flesh come down in
[2:08:08] flesh. Is that right?
[2:08:16] You all remember the little story
[2:08:20] about the little boy that was scared of
[2:08:22] lightning and his mom and family was a
[2:08:26] Christian family.
[2:08:28] She says, "Junior, go upstairs. Go to
[2:08:30] bed. You have nothing to be scared
[2:08:32] about. You ain't got nothing to be
[2:08:33] scared about.
[2:08:36] Don't The lightning won't hurt you.
[2:08:38] Thunders won't hurt you." He was kind of
[2:08:40] whimpering and whining and so forth. And
[2:08:42] he got up there into bed.
[2:08:46] Amen. Junior snubbed a few times
[2:08:50] after she said, "Don't be scared. God is
[2:08:52] with you. He'll protect us." Junior
[2:08:54] snubbed a few times. He says, "Mama, I
[2:08:56] believe that, too." But when that
[2:08:58] lightning's flashing so close to the
[2:09:00] window, I like the feel that God has got
[2:09:03] some skin on it.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. How about us? When the lightning's
[2:09:09] flashing, when the sea is roaring, when
[2:09:11] the evil is in the land, I want God with
[2:09:14] some skin on.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; I want God or is a reality.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; It's a big saying.
[2:09:32] It's a great saying, almost hard to be
[2:09:35] understood, but for the disciples to
[2:09:38] walk with Jesus, to have him right there
[2:09:41] doing miracles, signs and wonders,
[2:09:43] speaking to him.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; But how many believes that you and I
[2:09:48] have something better than that?
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Better than that. Yes.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to the grave of Lazarus
[2:10:01] and rose him from the dead,
[2:10:04] everybody was in awe.
[2:10:07] Wow.
[2:10:09] Nobody could do these things unless he
[2:10:11] was of God.
[2:10:13] They were in awe.
[2:10:15] Wow.
[2:10:17] when they couldn't cast out
[2:10:21] that epilepticy out of a child. Ain't
[2:10:23] that right? And Jesus had to come along
[2:10:24] and say, "Oh, ye of little faith." He
[2:10:27] cast that devil out. Everybody was in
[2:10:34] when he said, "I do nothing but what my
[2:10:36] father shows me first. Show us the
[2:10:39] father and it'll satisfy us." They
[2:10:41] wanted to see this father. They wanted
[2:10:43] to experience the father.
[2:10:45] How many knows the life of God, the
[2:10:48] power of God was still void in those
[2:10:52] disciples?
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Not that they didn't have authority to
[2:10:54] go cast out devils because Jesus gave
[2:10:56] them that authority. He gave them the
[2:10:58] faith to do it. But their nature wasn't
[2:11:00] changed.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me their nature was changed.
[2:11:04] Peter lied like the devil.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:11:08] Got mad fixing to cut a man's head off.
[2:11:11] Not his ear.
[2:11:17] Oh boy.
[2:11:19] Here's here here here here's a good one
[2:11:20] for us. You know, you would think that
[2:11:24] if Jesus had anything to do with
[2:11:26] protecting that man
[2:11:29] that his ear wouldn't have got cut off,
[2:11:33] huh? Well, Jesus was there and he didn't
[2:11:36] let Peter cut his head off.
[2:11:38] And you know, sometimes things happen in
[2:11:40] our lives. We think, well, if God was
[2:11:42] going to do something, he wouldn't, you
[2:11:44] know, just allow this to happen. But
[2:11:48] sometimes he does.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Now, this is off the subject, but just
[2:11:54] remember that when things aren't quite
[2:11:56] the way you think they are, just trust
[2:11:58] God.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; He's got it in his control. He knows
[2:12:01] what he's doing.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; He grabbed that ear up there, and we had
[2:12:04] an instant
[2:12:06] reattachment of the ear. Isn't that
[2:12:08] right?
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:13] But God was still not I want to say
[2:12:16] this. God was still not a reality to
[2:12:18] Peter.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Peace was still not a reality to him.
[2:12:24] The real comfort that comes with
[2:12:26] justification and sanctification and the
[2:12:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost, it was still
[2:12:31] not a reality.
[2:12:35] No. Because if it would have been, Jesus
[2:12:39] wouldn't have had to go to the cross.
[2:12:42] There would have been no need of the day
[2:12:44] of Pentecost, the second chapter of
[2:12:46] Acts. Isn't that right? Because they
[2:12:48] would have had what they had need of.
[2:12:51] But they had a need.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. They had a need, and that was
[2:12:56] reality.
[2:13:02] the reality of God,
[2:13:07] of what he is,
[2:13:10] of who he is.
[2:13:15] Amen.
[2:13:17] Praise be to God.
[2:13:21] Because they could never understand
[2:13:23] when he said, "My peace give I unto you.
[2:13:25] Not as the world giveth, give I unto
[2:13:27] you." Amen. My joy I give to you that
[2:13:31] your joy may be full. He comes to give
[2:13:32] his fullness of joy.
[2:13:37] How many believes it wasn't until the
[2:13:38] day of Pentecost
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; when they were in that upper room?
[2:13:43] God was a myth. Jesus was a myth. They
[2:13:47] didn't really know who he was. And
[2:13:49] remember this. Remember Paul said, "From
[2:13:52] now on, we don't know Jesus after the
[2:13:55] flesh."
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Is that what Paul said? In other words,
[2:13:58] we don't need we don't know him after
[2:14:00] the flesh.
[2:14:02] But we know him where? In here. We know
[2:14:06] him by spiritual revelation.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; How does this thing How does God become
[2:14:13] real to you when he reveals himself
[2:14:16] personally to you? See, it ain't just
[2:14:19] good enough for Jesus to be filled with
[2:14:21] God. No. But I need to be filled with
[2:14:24] God. You needed to be filled with God.
[2:14:26] It isn't just enough that your mom has
[2:14:29] the Holy Ghost that they know God. No,
[2:14:32] you want to know God. I want to know him
[2:14:34] myself.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; I don't need God in my dad and my mom.
[2:14:38] That's fine. But I need God in here. I
[2:14:41] want a personal reality of God in my
[2:14:44] life.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it won't do you no good. Your
[2:14:48] mom's experience, my experience, your
[2:14:50] pastor's experience isn't going to do
[2:14:52] you any good. No, you got to have a
[2:14:55] personal revelation
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; for him not to be some historical god,
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; some god of history, some myth.
[2:15:17] I can tell you how God delivered me,
[2:15:21] how he forgave me, but that doesn't do
[2:15:24] you any good.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:15:30] The angel of the Lord was with the
[2:15:31] prophet. God was with the prophet.
[2:15:34] That's all fine. Yeah. But we need God
[2:15:37] here. We need the angel of the Lord
[2:15:38] here.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; I need him here with me. I want God in
[2:15:44] my skin. Do you want God in your skin?
[2:15:48] Everything else is false. Everything
[2:15:50] else is a failure. Everything else is
[2:15:54] a lie.
[2:15:56] You won't make it. Many of them will get
[2:15:59] it on their flesh. They'll get happy.
[2:16:01] They'll get on on their flesh. They'll
[2:16:03] get it in their spirit and speak in
[2:16:05] tongues, but it don't change their
[2:16:07] nature. Why do you think Jesus says,
[2:16:09] "You've got to be born again. You've got
[2:16:12] to be changed in your soul.
[2:16:15] Many will come to me in that day and
[2:16:16] say, "Haven't one day the other thing."
[2:16:18] You were living in a mess. You're still
[2:16:20] living your own life doing your own
[2:16:22] thing.
[2:16:27] Hello.
[2:16:28] Very few that'll ever live in that full
[2:16:31] reality.
[2:16:43] Praise be to God. We want God with skin
[2:16:46] on.
[2:16:48] Didn't Brother Bram say out there in
[2:16:49] them deserts, the word is becoming
[2:16:51] flesh. The flesh is becoming word.
[2:16:53] They're becoming one. How many believe
[2:16:55] we're becoming one with Christ?
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. God is coming down in a
[2:16:59] greater way.
[2:17:04] Oh, I want to say people lived in the
[2:17:06] times of Brother Brandham saw his
[2:17:07] meetings.
[2:17:09] Look at where they are today. Still got
[2:17:11] a plane waiting up to come back. Their
[2:17:14] children, they're just listening to
[2:17:15] tapes and everything else. And their
[2:17:17] children going wayward. Amen. Wearing
[2:17:20] clothes. They ought from holiness. I'm
[2:17:23] here to tell you that we better get
[2:17:24] closer to the God. Amen. Than what we
[2:17:26] were when brother Brandham was here. We
[2:17:28] don't know brother Brandham according to
[2:17:30] the flesh anymore. He's gone. We better
[2:17:32] get to the one that he was pointing us
[2:17:34] to. He pointed us to Christ. Let's get
[2:17:37] to Christ.
[2:17:40] Where am I going to send you through the
[2:17:41] brand tabernacle to no? I sent you to
[2:17:44] Christ.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; If you want to know where you going to
[2:17:46] be, where you're going to meet to be in
[2:17:48] the rapture,
[2:17:50] you're going to have to be in Christ.
[2:17:52] And Christ has to be in you. How many
[2:17:54] want to say, "God, I want more of the
[2:17:56] reality of joy.
[2:17:59] I want the reality of peace that pass
[2:18:01] understanding. I want that to be real to
[2:18:04] me.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; You can have it to be real to you.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; The cycle of revival and death has never
[2:18:16] failed. All you have to do is recall
[2:18:18] this last move of God in the spirit.
[2:18:19] When men and women dressed like
[2:18:20] Christians, went to church, prayed all
[2:18:22] night, took to the street corners, and
[2:18:24] weren't ashamed of the manifestation of
[2:18:25] the spirit. They left their old dead
[2:18:27] churches and worshiped in homes or in
[2:18:30] store buildings. They had reality.
[2:18:37] Don't talk to me about services going
[2:18:39] by. Amen. How preachers could preach.
[2:18:41] Amen. And such an anointing come until
[2:18:43] people would repent. Amen. That's not
[2:18:45] just some historical God. I believe that
[2:18:47] we have ought to have it here this
[2:18:49] morning.
[2:18:51] [Applause]
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; We want God to be real this morning.
[2:19:05] Amen.
[2:19:08] No man knows the things of God saved the
[2:19:11] spirit and he to whom the spirit of God
[2:19:14] reveals them. We need to call on God for
[2:19:17] revelation more than anything else in
[2:19:18] the world. We have accepted the Bible.
[2:19:22] I'm putting here. We have accepted the
[2:19:24] message. We know the message. We
[2:19:25] understand the message. We read the
[2:19:27] message. We have accepted the great
[2:19:29] truth of it. But it's still not real to
[2:19:32] most people.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; What good does it do to you if it's not
[2:19:39] real?
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; You're still living in a mystical world
[2:19:46] of your imagination.
[2:19:51] But when God comes down,
[2:19:54] how many believes the Holy Ghost is
[2:19:56] real?
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; When you repent and confess your sins,
[2:20:00] Amen. And the Holy Spirit comes down in
[2:20:02] there, there's something that takes
[2:20:04] place.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; There's a supernatural power that's more
[2:20:08] real than you sitting here.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; How many know that's really the only
[2:20:13] real things? Hallelujah. Think about it.
[2:20:16] Everything that's really real is the
[2:20:18] things we can't see right now. The
[2:20:20] baptism of the Holy Spirit giving him
[2:20:22] more of you. See God come down in a
[2:20:24] greater way. Oh, wish to God that I open
[2:20:27] up the eyes of Amen. Our eyes to be able
[2:20:29] to see the Holy Spirit coming down
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; in every heart that wants him right now.
[2:20:34] Every young person that wants to
[2:20:36] experience God in a real way.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. in a reality.
[2:20:47] Praise be to God.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's real. Real joy.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; If you want joy, real joy, wonderful
[2:21:03] joy, let Jesus come into your heart.
[2:21:09] Oh, I read a quote this morning.
[2:21:14] Oh my. Where brother Abraham said this
[2:21:16] here that Christ is coming. It is real.
[2:21:19] Nobody has ever been able to come and
[2:21:21] disprove what Jesus is doing. Many have
[2:21:24] tried it. But he says this thing is this
[2:21:26] is real. This is the real manifestation
[2:21:29] of Jesus Christ in our generation in our
[2:21:32] day.
[2:21:33] And it ought to what? Do what? What it
[2:21:35] ought to do to us? He said make us the
[2:21:37] happiest people on the face of the
[2:21:39] earth. that you're following something
[2:21:41] real, not something fake.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Every time you go to the grocery store
[2:21:55] and you give them a $100 bill, what do
[2:21:59] they do?
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; They check it for reality.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Authenticity.
[2:22:06] Isn't that right? They'll either rub
[2:22:08] that little old marker on it or they'll
[2:22:10] put it up to something. Let's see if
[2:22:12] this is real.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. How many believe that's
[2:22:18] the way ought we do when we come to
[2:22:20] church. Amen. To present ourselves
[2:22:21] before God. Amen. Let's see if we're
[2:22:24] really real or not. Put us in front of
[2:22:26] that mirror. Amen. See if we see our
[2:22:28] reflection in that Bible. Amen. When the
[2:22:30] preacher preaches, Amen. s talk about
[2:22:32] joy unspeakable and full of glory. You
[2:22:35] talk about peace that passes
[2:22:36] understanding. That's right, brother
[2:22:38] Father. I'm looking in the mirror.
[2:22:39] That's me.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Not just some day going by.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Some historical god.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:04] Can you imagine Samson
[2:23:07] picking a fight with the Philistines?
[2:23:10] You know he picked a fight, right? He
[2:23:12] was looking for a fight.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Looking for some way to justly
[2:23:18] kill half of them. And he finally got
[2:23:21] his way. Can you imagine if he stood in
[2:23:23] front of them thousand Philistines says,
[2:23:25] "I'm going to whoop every last one of
[2:23:27] y'all.
[2:23:29] I'mma whoop all of you.
[2:23:33] You're right.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; He says, "Bring it.
[2:23:39] Bring it." And they come at him. And it
[2:23:42] said he slew them heaps upon heaps.
[2:23:45] Heaps upon heaps. They had to crawl over
[2:23:46] top of the dead ones to get to him.
[2:23:48] Amen. Then there'd be another pile and
[2:23:50] then another pile and another pile. How
[2:23:52] many believe them hard-headed
[2:23:55] Philistines had reality check?
[2:23:58] Goliath had a hard reality check that
[2:24:02] the power of God is greater than his
[2:24:05] psychology and his biceps. The power in
[2:24:08] the name of God is greater.
[2:24:11] Woo! How many believe this morning
[2:24:12] cancer, Amen, is going to get a reality
[2:24:15] check. Amen. You ain't got no right
[2:24:17] here. Depression, you ain't got no right
[2:24:20] here. You're getting a reality check
[2:24:22] this morning. Get on out of here. You're
[2:24:25] not going to bring me down. You're not
[2:24:27] going to depress me. You're not going to
[2:24:29] bring my joint out.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; You're not You're not going to quieten
[2:24:34] this church up.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much CO you bring
[2:24:38] around. I don't care what you have.
[2:24:41] Boom. Then we by his stripes we are
[2:24:44] healed.
[2:24:46] You just make me a child a little more
[2:24:49] because of his healing power.
[2:24:54] How many believe you ought to do that?
[2:24:55] you get healed from something, you ought
[2:24:57] to give God a little bit of glory.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; You ought to give him a little praise.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than just in your
[2:25:05] mind.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you have it just in your
[2:25:10] mind. You go over and over and over
[2:25:11] until it drops down into your heart and
[2:25:14] then it becomes a reality.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Now I know what you're talking about.
[2:25:19] Paul said, "Nobody can talk speaking by
[2:25:22] the Holy Ghost calls Jesus the Christ."
[2:25:24] And nobody can call Jesus the Christ but
[2:25:27] by the Holy Ghost. In other words, you
[2:25:30] don't even know him.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; You do not know him until you have him
[2:25:35] in here. Then you know him.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; You know him mentally. And that's not
[2:25:40] good enough.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; That's the way Peter and them knew him.
[2:25:42] They knew him mentally and and knew his
[2:25:44] actions. But after the day of Pentecost,
[2:25:47] then they really knew what God was like.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand how he believes
[2:25:53] that
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Steven when he was being stoned, they
[2:25:57] were killing him. He had so much of God
[2:26:00] in him. He knew so much about what it
[2:26:02] was like to be Jesus like to be God.
[2:26:06] I hope this is not too heavy. And I
[2:26:08] believe it's right. You know what it's
[2:26:10] like to be God.
[2:26:12] You know what it's like to be God.
[2:26:16] Why? Because where is he?
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; Living his life out through you. So, you
[2:26:22] know, it's not hard to forgive people
[2:26:24] that sin against you. It's not hard to
[2:26:27] forgive cuz why? You refuse to hold a
[2:26:32] grudge. You refuse to be unforgiven.
[2:26:36] Oh, bitterness.
[2:26:38] Jesus said on the cross, "Forgive them,
[2:26:40] father, for they don't know what they
[2:26:42] do." Steven, when he was being stoned,
[2:26:44] he said the same thing. Don't lay this
[2:26:46] to their charge. Hello.
[2:26:55] I'll go ahead and make the statement.
[2:26:57] Most people that are doing you wrong are
[2:26:59] spiritually blind to what they're doing.
[2:27:02] They're so caught up in that spirit that
[2:27:04] they'll use a quote to justify
[2:27:06] themselves.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Now, that's blind, folks. They don't
[2:27:10] know what they're doing.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:27:17] Hallelujah.
[2:27:20] Amen.
[2:27:22] Hallelujah. How about them witches that
[2:27:24] had that table up there. Amen.
[2:27:26] Challenging the prophet. Amen. If he had
[2:27:29] the power to bring it down, he used his
[2:27:31] name, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost name,
[2:27:32] and everything else. But when he'd come
[2:27:34] down and like take them legs off, they
[2:27:36] had a reality check.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; How many believe that this world is
[2:27:43] going to have a reality check? When the
[2:27:46] fire falls, the tribulation, amen,
[2:27:48] they'll go to the rocks and the hills.
[2:27:49] Amen. Say, "Hide us from the face." To
[2:27:52] him that said, "Oh, they're going to
[2:27:53] know God's coming."
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much they try to fool
[2:27:57] themselves. They're going to know they
[2:27:59] got it coming.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; On the day of judgment, in the days of
[2:28:04] Noah, they had a reality check. Ah, you
[2:28:07] crazy man with your boat up on top of a
[2:28:09] hill. Crazy. But when the thunder struck
[2:28:11] and when the water comes up over their
[2:28:13] curbs, comes up into their houses, they
[2:28:17] had a reality check in their mind. This
[2:28:19] guy was right.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many churches, how many
[2:28:26] preachers, how many people out there
[2:28:28] that seen the acts of the Jesus Christ
[2:28:30] through the prophet in this hour knew
[2:28:32] the tapes were right.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're in for a reality check
[2:28:37] when they're left in the tribulation
[2:28:39] period. When they come over there,
[2:28:41] they're going to be having a reality
[2:28:42] check.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Every soul,
[2:28:52] every knee
[2:28:55] is going to have a reality check.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Shall bow,
[2:28:59] every mouth shall confess that Jesus
[2:29:03] Christ is Lord. I believe that
[2:29:07] everybody's going to have a reality
[2:29:08] check.
[2:29:10] Oh my, I want mine this morning. How
[2:29:14] many is with me? Say, God, I want a
[2:29:15] reality check. Don't you let me live in
[2:29:18] some fantasy
[2:29:21] of just trying to go to church to make
[2:29:22] myself feel better. God, it's got to be
[2:29:25] your literal life on Monday, Tuesday,
[2:29:27] Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[2:29:29] God help us. God help me. I want to be
[2:29:32] real.
[2:29:36] Amen.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; I know y'all are with me on that. I
[2:29:42] Amen.
[2:29:44] Amen. Look up that song if you will. My
[2:29:46] God is real. He's real in my soul.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; For he has washed and he's made me
[2:29:51] whole. Amen.
[2:29:54] Praise the Lord. False gods, false
[2:29:56] salvation, myths, dreams. My my the
[2:30:00] whole world is full
[2:30:05] of the phony of the substitutes.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; And if there's anything I could do this
[2:30:12] morning, anything I could say and to
[2:30:15] myself is search your heart.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Search your soul.
[2:30:21] See what your desires are.
[2:30:25] See where your passion is, where your
[2:30:28] treasure is, what you love
[2:30:31] more than anything else.
[2:30:34] Find out if your nature has been
[2:30:36] changed. See if your spirit is more
[2:30:40] powerful than your flesh. Hello.
[2:30:44] See where you're at with God. Don't fool
[2:30:47] yourself.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Don't be fooled.
[2:30:51] Don't be satisfied with some substitute
[2:30:54] that do the devil would offer
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; because it's full of it.
[2:30:59] Amen.
[2:31:02] Praise the Lord.
[2:31:10] Amen.
[2:31:15] In closing, I want to repeat just a
[2:31:18] little bit something. Young people
[2:31:19] especially, pray for revelation.
[2:31:25] Pray for revelation.
[2:31:27] That revelation Jesus said to Peter, he
[2:31:31] says, "Who what has revealed this to
[2:31:33] you? My father in heaven has revealed
[2:31:35] this to you." He says, "And upon this
[2:31:38] rock, I'll build my church and the gates
[2:31:40] of hell shall not prevail against it."
[2:31:47] Pray for God to personally reveal
[2:31:50] himself
[2:31:51] to you. Fill you with the Holy Spirit so
[2:31:55] that you can know the joy.
[2:31:57] Your mom and dad will help you through
[2:31:59] your trials and everything you go
[2:32:00] through. But when you become an adult,
[2:32:02] guess what? You may not have your mom
[2:32:04] and dad. You have to learn to fight your
[2:32:06] battles.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; You have to learn to think the right
[2:32:10] thoughts.
[2:32:12] when you're going through trials, when
[2:32:13] you're going through things, when you're
[2:32:15] going through temptation, how to resist.
[2:32:17] Hello. How to dedicate yourself to God
[2:32:20] on a daily basis to have a personal
[2:32:22] prayer life every day, a
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; personal walk with God.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; Because remember, it's not a church
[2:32:28] thing. It's a individual thing
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; with every individual.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:40] his saving power, his forgiveness power,
[2:32:43] his filling power, his delivering power.
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; I'll How many in here
[2:32:53] have went come to places? I know Irvin's
[2:32:56] have with Troy. Troy has, Brother Joe,
[2:32:58] Hannah, just a lot of us. I have many
[2:33:02] times come up to places to where you
[2:33:04] really did all you can. you. Anything
[2:33:06] you possibly can do, you'll do, but it
[2:33:09] just doesn't seem to change.
[2:33:14] It's just a wall.
[2:33:17] Don't know how you're going to get
[2:33:18] through it.
[2:33:20] Hello. Not enough to drive you crazy,
[2:33:27] but praise be to God. What does it do?
[2:33:30] It drives you not crazy, but to your
[2:33:32] knees.
[2:33:34] And you know what it's like to not be
[2:33:36] able to get over it, under it, or around
[2:33:38] it.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; And then what do you do?
[2:33:42] I want to just say just relax.
[2:33:45] Just relax.
[2:33:47] Don't bite all your fingernails off.
[2:33:50] Commit it to God. But Bram says that's
[2:33:53] he got come to that place. Many place.
[2:33:55] Commit it to God and watch God take you
[2:33:59] through.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; How many's been there? If you've been
[2:34:02] there, give God a hand. Say, "Thank you,
[2:34:04] Lord. You took me through."
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; We didn't have to dig a hole for you.
[2:34:16] You made it through.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; And if you do, if we do have to dig a
[2:34:22] hole for you or for me, praise God
[2:34:25] anyway.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I've got a better house.
[2:34:29] I'm in a better place. You ain't got
[2:34:30] nothing to fear, church, when you're in
[2:34:33] God's hands.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; I mean, he's glad for that.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; Never fear. Don't fear. I just had a
[2:34:39] quote on that. Brother Bam says, "No
[2:34:41] matter how many atomic bombs, no matter
[2:34:42] what's going or coming," he says,
[2:34:44] "you're in his hands. You don't have to
[2:34:46] worry about nothing. We are in his
[2:34:48] control. He is at the wheel." He said,
[2:34:51] "God is at the wheel." How many believes
[2:34:53] God is at the wheel of your life?
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; He's at the wheel of my life.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:00] And it's real.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that reality. The
[2:35:04] reality of Jesus Christ.
[2:35:09] Not Jacob Emmen, Men of Simon, Martin
[2:35:11] Luther, John Wesley, Pentecost or Isuza
[2:35:14] Street. Hello.
[2:35:17] But this message, it lives on. Amen. How
[2:35:21] many believes that
[2:35:23] the message didn't die with Brother
[2:35:26] Brandham?
[2:35:28] Brother Bham's message is not an age
[2:35:30] gone by. Don't never let a preacher come
[2:35:32] up here and say, "Well, now that was in
[2:35:33] Brother Brandham's day, Brother Bram's
[2:35:35] age." And I'm going to tell you why I
[2:35:38] say that just now as it's coming.
[2:35:42] And I'll tell you why that is. It's
[2:35:43] because Brother Brandham said, "These
[2:35:45] tapes will live on."
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; And that how many believe that this
[2:35:50] message don't die. It's not some This is
[2:35:52] our age. There's no other message. And
[2:35:54] this message lives on. these tapes will
[2:35:57] live on.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe, how many believe
[2:36:01] it's going to take us to a
[2:36:02] transformation?
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the world's on fire, don't
[2:36:07] you want God's bosom to be your pillow?
[2:36:09] When the world is just falling apart and
[2:36:11] it's getting where it is at, I want to
[2:36:13] have it to be a reality in my life. One
[2:36:16] of these days, we'll be changed in the
[2:36:18] moment, in the twinkling of an eye. How
[2:36:20] many looking for the rapture to be a
[2:36:22] reality?
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Not just a myth, but it'll
[2:36:27] be a reality to us one of these days.
[2:36:29] Musicians, come on up if you will
[2:36:36] stand with me. I want to ask a couple
[2:36:39] questions.
[2:36:41] You be honest, eyes closed.
[2:36:49] Is there any this morning that just
[2:36:51] really maybe you're just pretty far away
[2:36:53] from God?
[2:36:55] Young people, old people, don't matter.
[2:36:58] And God's just not really real to you.
[2:37:01] You'd like to raise your hand, say, "I
[2:37:03] want God to be real to me.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. God bless
[2:37:08] you. God bless you." Hands all over.
[2:37:13] Jesus sees your hand.
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm believing as your pastor that
[2:37:17] God is going to deal with your heart.
[2:37:20] You just watch. You just watch this
[2:37:23] coming week. you that's got your hand
[2:37:24] up, I believe God's going to answer that
[2:37:26] prayer because Christianity has what you
[2:37:29] have need of. Christ has what you have
[2:37:32] need of and you need Christ to be a
[2:37:34] greater reality in your life. He wants
[2:37:37] to be a greater reality than a lot of
[2:37:39] times we allow him to be.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:37:44] How about those who do know God, but you
[2:37:46] want to know him in a greater reality.
[2:37:49] God, I want a greater reality.
[2:37:52] Lord, in a deeper walk with you, Lord, a
[2:37:54] closer walk, Father.
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; So, we ask God, as we all raise our
[2:37:59] hands to you this morning, we pray in
[2:38:00] the name of Jesus Christ, that Lord,
[2:38:03] you'll reveal yourself in a greater way,
[2:38:05] Lord, to our hearts and to our lives,
[2:38:08] Lord. And help us to realize that all
[2:38:10] these natural things, God, they're not
[2:38:13] real. The only real thing is you. It's
[2:38:16] your spirit. It's you living in our
[2:38:19] life, Lord. The life that I now live, I
[2:38:22] live by the faith of the son of God.
[2:38:24] God, that's the reality that we desire
[2:38:27] this morning in our lives. That we could
[2:38:29] say like Paul, father, the life I now
[2:38:32] live, it's not my life, but it's his
[2:38:34] life. Help me not to spend so much time.
[2:38:37] Help me not to focus so much on the
[2:38:40] things that aren't real. Help me to
[2:38:43] focus more on my prayer life and my
[2:38:46] dedication to you, Lord, and saying,
[2:38:48] "God, I want you to be more real in my
[2:38:50] life." Just as Peter as he had that Holy
[2:38:53] Ghost when he came to the impotent man,
[2:38:56] amen, on the way to the temple and said,
[2:38:58] "Silver and gold, we have none, but in
[2:39:00] the name of Jesus, such as we have, we
[2:39:02] give to you. Rise up and walk, oh Lord,
[2:39:05] let the church have that, Father.
[2:39:08] Oh, burn, burn, Holy Spirit, burn in me.
[2:39:11] You set my soul on fire. Fill me with
[2:39:14] the Holy Ghost and God's full desire.
[2:39:16] Make me like the Christ of old, healing
[2:39:19] and raising the dead.
[2:39:21] Oh, give me the power that Jesus had
[2:39:24] through the blood that was shed. Father,
[2:39:27] this morning that's our heart's cry.
[2:39:29] Lord, help us be original. Help us all
[2:39:32] to be real. Lord, we don't, none of us
[2:39:35] want to put on, be a fake or a mimic. We
[2:39:40] want to be the genuine article, Lord. We
[2:39:43] raise our hands in surrenderance to you,
[2:39:45] Lord, and ask, God, that in the coming
[2:39:47] days, Lord, you'll make yourself more
[2:39:50] real to us than what we've ever known.
[2:39:53] And Lord, we don't know just how you'll
[2:39:55] do it, but we'll be aware and we'll be
[2:39:57] ready and we'll be waiting for you to
[2:40:00] give that answer to those cries this
[2:40:02] morning in Jesus name. Did everybody say
[2:40:06] it?
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give the Lord a hand and say,
[2:40:08] "Thank you, Jesus, for talking to us,
[2:40:10] Lord. Thank you, Lord, for coming, Lord,
[2:40:13] and help us and inspiring us, Lord.
[2:40:15] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord."
[2:40:18] Amen. Have you got that song up? I may
[2:40:20] try to help sing that just a little bit
[2:40:22] as before we turn.
[2:40:26] Well, my God is real.
[2:40:32] He's really in my soul.
[2:40:36] My God is real for he has washed me.
[2:40:46] His love for me
[2:40:51] is like your God.
[2:40:56] My God is real for I can feel him in my
[2:41:02] soul.
[2:41:06] You are something
[2:41:11] not know
[2:41:14] [Music]
[2:41:28] [Music]
[2:41:33] that God is real for I can feel.

[2:41:47] He's real in my soul.
[2:41:52] My God is real. For he has washed and

[2:42:10] My God is real. For I can feel him in my
[2:42:16] soul
[2:42:18] and some folk may die.
[2:42:23] Some folk may score.
[2:42:28] All can go on
[2:42:31] and leave me alone.
[2:42:36] But as for me,
[2:42:41] I'll take God's part.
[2:42:45] And God is real. For I can feel him in
[2:42:50] my heart.
[2:42:54] My God is real. Oh yes,
[2:42:58] he's real in my heart.
[2:43:03] My God is real for he has and he's made
[2:43:08] me whole.
[2:43:12] His love for me
[2:43:16] is like gold.
[2:43:20] My God is real for I can't feel him in
[2:43:26] my heart.
[2:43:29] And I cannot tell
[2:43:34] just how you felt
[2:43:38] when Jesus took
[2:43:41] your sins
[2:43:44] away.
[2:43:47] But since that day,
[2:43:51] oh, since that hour,
[2:43:55] God has been real. For I can feel his
[2:44:00] holy power.
[2:44:04] Oh, my God is real.
[2:44:08] He's real in my soul.
[2:44:12] My God is real. for he has washed and he
[2:44:18] made daily me oh
[2:44:21] his love for me.
[2:44:26] It's like we're gone.
[2:44:31] God is real for I can feel you in my
[2:44:36] soul.
[2:44:38] Amen. Is he real to you this morning?
[2:44:41] Amen. Did you enjoy the word this
[2:44:43] morning? My, what an awesome message
[2:44:46] this morning. And Amen. Aren't you just
