always come back in our minds and so forth amen and so we're glad to have brother Luke amen praise the Lord God bless each and every one of you this evening amen um I'm going to read a script and then maybe say a few words amen I pretty much amen just studied for about an hour and a half so amen takes hour and a half study for about a 15 minute sermon right amen so God bless you I know I did think about it yesterday the Lord kind of fell laid on my heart what to speak on Amen and so we've been just trying to get a few scriptures together see what the Lord will have for us amen we tried not to eat so we wouldn't be sluggish up here so amen I don't know how you feel but I feel pretty good so praise the Lord amen God bless you let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we know that father we can't do anything in ourselves Lord Jesus but with with you all things are possible we ask God that you would just bless the reading of the word meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to minister tonight Lord Jesus father and bring this morning Lord and we just thank you Lord Jesus for the continu continuity of your word Lord Jesus and your spirit and we ask God that you just come in a special way again Lord and just give us Liberty to minister your word and help us Lord to get out of the way now in Jesus name amen and amen if you will turn your Bibles to the Book of Psalms 46 Psalms 46 this is the scripture that came to me amen and and so this is where we're going to start off at I like to start off where the spirit started off amen usually all right that way amen so praise the Lord y'all pray for my voice I don't know what in the world's going on it just seems like wants to be a Amish horse a Bogger you know when it bogs or whatever you go backwards and so it just doesn't want to amen sound like it should amen so I gota have to try a little harder just to speak for some reason amen God is our refuge and strength a very present help in time of trouble may God add His blessings reading the word you can be seated amen first I was going to preach and call is never alone amen but we'll title it very present very present amen a it has to do with the presence of God presence of God first of all amen I thought about it I just would like for everybody to be praying for me here amen the last few days I have had a heavy heart amen I don't have have it that often but sometimes I'll have this weight amen this burden on my heart amen and I've just had that in the last few days and so um and it is something that I had prayed and of course the Lord answered it and so you know you just you have to be careful what you ask for amen but it's of the Lord amen and brother Levi Yoder amen up there in uh Wilm might Ohio right there in the heart of my hometown I've always wanted to see a church amen start there even when my cousins started to come out of their Amish and so forth I said I even said something about we'll just have a meeting or a you know have a service let's just have a service and your extra building out there or something but he and so forth and so didn't never work out really but I know that Levi is coming out Levi and I think about a week and a half ago last Wednesday Levi called me and said his brother the one that this church is that they've built amen I went up there that one time to help hang the windows if you'll remember and um so he called me on Wednesday and said that his brother Ben and Emma I believe her name was amen that they had both gotten baptized here in the last couple of weeks and I know that his wife was not really kind of going along with going out and and so forth but H you know she got baptized so we'll just see amen and so it's a good thing to see God moving amen and they want to have dedicational services in two weeks which is right in the middle of March um and so that's not this coming Sunday but the following Sunday so I'm going to go up there amen and I have been really wanting you know to speak amen not just maybe to them but also to the Indiana church but uh he first asked you know he said he wasn't sure just how he was going to do it yet but he called me the other day and said that he want to me to actually take a whole service it'll be the last service of the weekend which is good because I can get the good feel of feel of everything amen that'll be Sunday afternoon on at 2 o'clock and then he asked me to conduct a conduct a u foot Wasing service also a communion service we want to have afterwards so just pray for me amen It's A peculiar situation amen and so amen U I certainly have a burden on my heart for them for that area and I want God to just have his perfect way amen I want God to speak what he wants to the way and prayer amen and so if you'll remember me in prayer I for some reason I have a strange burden about it it's kind of unusual but I still do have a strange burden about it amen and so I'm just seeking the perfect will of God Amen in that so that we can be a blessing I certainly like to see be a real Message Church come up from there amen rise up from there amen so that people in that area which is the heart of what I call cathol Catholicism amen amen because they believe it like pretty much like Catholics believe whatever the church says is above the word of God whatever the priest say is above the word of God it's pretty much how they believe amen and so they have a very strong amen it's a very strong thing and so amen there's just a lot there that I'm not going to get into but um we just pray that God would raise up a real genuine wine message church amen praise the lord we should like to see it so just pray for us on that area amen I can't think of anything else so I want to just begin amen here amen with thinking about this word very present help in time of trouble amen the presence of God Amen and I listen to the message called the presence of God unrecognized brother bam talked much about uh you know how that God will come and he'll send prophets he'll send scribes he'll send Jesus Christ to the Pharisees and they didn't recognize God among them a amen amen and so tonight with the help of the lord we want to just talk about that a little bit because if you can recognize that God's presence is with you how many glad that God is with you amen he is with you now the next scripture I want to go to is in Matthew 28 Matthew 28 amen and verse 19 it's a very familiar scripture go ye therefore for and teach All Nations sorry for getting ahead of you amen go therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and whatsoever I have command commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world Amen now I can't help but believe forgive me for interpreting this but he was speaking to the disciples but yet he was talking about I'll be with you amen he must have been talking to the church body he's going to talk to people that are going to be all the way down here at the end of the world and he has given us a promise that he would be with you amen be with you and I got to thinking about how that when God is with you and you know that God called Abraham when God called Abraham I read search a lot of these quotes here back there talking about walking alone with God how that God had called Abraham to leave his Kindred leave leave his mom dad brother sister leave all of them amen he wasn't supposed to take his nephew he wasn't take supposed to take his dad and all that along but he did and he always set trouble as long as he didn't do what God Said do because God calls a man when God calls a man he calls you to walk alone with him amen it it's you and God not you and everybody else found another quote where but bam said you know he said the Holy Spirit even told him he saids you're walking with too many people this one's got that opinion and this denomination wants you to go to do this that and don't walk with you walk with me and listen to me amen how many believes that you got to listen you got to walk with God Amen and I'm so grateful that today we have the presence of God With Us amen even in US it reminds me of the song that talks all my life you have been faithful all my life you have been oh so good how many believes he's been good amen he has promised that he would never leave you he would never forsake us that's true I'll be with you amen how many knows that God Lord Jesus Christ he's always been with you he may not I've always been with in you but God is always been with you praise the Lord let's look at an Old Testament scripture William amen praise the Lord found in uh I guess we'll go to Isaiah 49 there's several scriptures in Isaiah there that I found that I really like liked Isaiah 49 is what we'll go to First amen H forget the not Isaiah 49:15 and 16 all right 13 on down sing oh heavens and be joyful o Earth and bring forth Break Forth into singing oh Mountains for the Lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted how many know many are the afflictions of the righteous but but God delivers them out of them all but Zion said the Lord has forsaken me and my lord lord has forgotten me amen let me tell you something I don't care how many times or how much sometimes you might think that you're Al like the Lord ain't with you if you're God's child he's always with you he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you listen to what he says can a woman forget her suckling child that she she hath not uh that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget but yet will I not forget thee amen behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands when I read that I thought you know God has gotten you you know you might think of a tattoo but I don't think brother Brad that Engraving is a that too engraving is when you go into the wood and you engrave it ain't that right he's carved he's got the scar perhaps of your name in his hand amen praise the Lord mother might forget it but he'll never forget you he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you he's always present he's always there amen you don't have to walk alone how many is glad not to have to walk alone no God promised that he would walk with us amen Isaiah 43 go back a few pages if you will amen there it is Isaiah 43 And1 but now thus sayith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed theee o Israel for fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine how many believes that that applies to you amen God knew you before the foundation of the world Amen he knows you amen when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee amen when th th walth through the fire th shalt not be burnt and neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel so he's promised that Rivers though you go through deep Rivers it's not going to consume you it's not going to overtake you amen though you go through flames of fire the fire of Trials and so forth it won't consume you how many believes that you have one that has got a hold of you amen aren't you glad that sin wants to say no I'll take him backsliding I'll take him amen besetting said I'll take him but Mercy said no I mean know Mercy said no no it ain't gonna take you why because you are in his hands you're in his hands how many believe you in the hands of almighty god let's look first before we talk a little bit more about that I want to go and look at another scripture amen that that I truly believe applies to us and it's in Jeremiah Jeremiah the first chapter and verse five he says before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations how many believe that before you was ever even formed in the womb God knew you amen and he ordained you he elected you he chose you amen praise the Lord oh my when you think about how that you know we think well God will never leave me never forsake me his presence will always be there with me but I thought you know on the other hand what's more important is that you were with him amen you were with him before the foundation of the world before anything was you were in his thought not just with him but you were a part of him before the first star us was ever made you were part of him amen let me say well for one thing for one thing he had you in his mind he had you in thought form he was he thought of you you were part of that thinking if you was ever part of that thinking how many know you can't no more pass away than though he can pass away and the other way that you're a part of him is by the Spirit by the holy spirit that you got in your heart that is part of God how many believes that's part of God Amen it's part of him s amen so it doesn't apply him never forsaking us never leaving us this is the amazing part all my life he has been faithful all my life he has been so good right from the start when I was born they did not think I was going to make it they had to give me seven different blood transfusions try to keep me going amen so you think about that how many knows God had something in his mind amen how many believes that even when you were out in the world even when you were a sinner I that God still watched over you he was still he had somebody watching over you cuz Jesus said I won't lose a one amen those wrecks that you had no things that happened to you I remember though uh walking behind the CLI Packer when we was plowing with horses and so forth after we disc it or whatever then we' have this uh this m this this we call it a culli packer I don't know what in the world you call it in English but anyway it's got these little sharp blades you know it goes it's shaped like that wheel bunch of Wheels that's shaped that's got a sharp edge on on the on it and I was walking behind the hes my brother was driving my feet caught you know in between the horses the CLI Packer and it caught and that thing ran right up I was about eight years old maybe nine I don't something like that that thing heavy many wheels ran right over on top of my back I don't know how he backed that thing back off of me withy but he backed it back off of me I was glad to breathe cuz I couldn't breathe while that thing was on top of me amen what God watching over you how many thankful for God watching over you all your life he watched over you brother I think of brother Glenn and know how old he is and how the things that he's done military and the fighting and everything else youell know and then yet God at this time brings him right into him and fills him with the Holy Ghost I'm many glad to be in God's hands I'm glad to be in the the hand of almighty God he said he'd never leave you he'd never forsake us amen I love that don't you am me a couple more scriptures I think in uh uh in Isaiah that I want to go to 130 now well I want to read this here last don't let me forget to read that but it was it was the perfect expression that David expressed of what I'm trying to say tonight amen but I want to go over to St John let's go over to St John for a minute St John 10 it's another wonderful promise of God for us St John 10 verse 27 it says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand amen My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is the pl of my father's hand from the love of God shall tribulation shall distress amen shall shall there's nothing is going to be able to separate you or pluck any nothing going to pluck you out of his hand think about it he says I don't know why he would have done it I guess but you know I guess the the grip if you don't have fingers you can't hold nothing but the very grip of God you perhaps it's expressing that you're held by the very grip of almighty God thank you Lorden thank you for holding me nothing can separate you because sometimes you and I you and I and ourselves would perhaps give up but there's something in you I me know he don't he won't let you go amen it reminds me of what what Paul said I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ I'm a prisoner to the word once you uh you know you did things you smoked you drank you did things you didn't really want to do you wanted peace in your heart but you were always miserable and man no matter how much you tried to overcome you can't never overcome it and you just a slave to something a habit maybe whatever it might be a slave to it I me know we were a Slave to the devil at one [Music] time we were slave to sorrow we were slave to sin but now you and I are a slave so to speak to Joy to peace to happiness amen the fruit of the spirit love I'm glad I'm glad I can't get away from it we can't get away from if you're really a prisoner of Christ you can't get away from it it holds you it won't let you go amen soon as you do something that you shouldn't do you're so miserable you can't stand it God forgive me Lord let me have that Joy that's not you that's Christ holding on to you you're a prisoner it's is it wonderful to be a prisoner to happiness and joy and peace to have a peace of mind peace peace wonderful peace coming down from the father above in fathomless Billows of love how many appreciates the Peace of almighty God Amen the road gets lonely sometimes sometimes you may have to walk by yourself amen never know sometimes all men fight forsake you how many know that even Jesus had everybody to forsake Him but how many knows Jesus wasn't alone the father was with him amen that's right he wasn't alone he didn't have to walk alone amen why he had the father with him he had the spirit with him am man think about Daniel when he went into the lions then how many joined him how many others prayed and got into that capital punishment and were there with none just him all by himself but he wasn't alone amen God was there with him amen Moses he wasn't alone on the back side of the desert felt like a complete failure but after his meeting with the burning bush he wasn't alone anymore amen so let me just say this if you don't get anything else if it's you and if you have God in your heart you have the majority and you can take on Nations there's nothing too big for you to take on as long as he's with you nothing too big I don't care what it is Moses he didn't have a whole bunch he just had his wife and a baby is that right went down there hey where you going Moses I'm going down to Egypt take over amen praise the Lord what about you Blood Washed by the G blood of Jesus Christ me you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you ought to tell the devil hey devil I'm coming here I'm taking over you took this from me I'm coming to take it back you make a slip out of slave out of my son my daughter whatever you I'm coming to take it back am you took my joy away from me I'm coming to take it back fact we shouldn't have to fear anything as long as God is with you amen this is this also expresses Faith amen it expresses Faith no matter what your situation is fear will come doubt will come if you have unbelief there but if you you know that whatever your situation is and you say God I know that you got this in control huh and you call him on the scene he is a very present help aren't you glad to have somebody on board on board that you can talk to that you can have fellowship with if you have a need he is right there you ain't got to wait till Sunday to get prayed for right you ain't got to call the preacher up or this that no you call him up you just talk to God right there right then how many's glad to have a relationship like that with almighty God Amen praise the Lord word amen that's why I thought we'd go along with brother Brad's message this morning about his hand amen the hand of God what he does how he heals you what he does David he may have seemed alone he didn't have a bunch of bodyguards to go out there to fight Goliath with him did he no bodyguards no armor carriers carry my sword carry my shield and everything else like perhaps Goliath did but he came out there when he didn't need it I can you I can just about imagine different Brothers of the David said hey you want us to go with you we'll be by your side we'll help you I they didn't care if they get their heads cut off they maybe volunteered to help he says no I got this God's got this isin't that right I'm going in the name of the Lord I've got my sling you don't have to help me carry this I got my smooth stones in my bag and I'm going in the name of the Lord I know who's with me how many believes in this generation all of this mck mire that's out there it might seem and it is overwhelming to somebody that ain't a part of God they get consumed in a minute but if you're a part of God and if you have are in the palm of his hands you're not going to lose amen you'll overcome this lukewarm Le out of the age that we're living in amen by God's grace you haven't got to worry because why you're in the hands of God praise the Lord he said that no man can pluck them out of out of my father's hand amen praise the Lord I'm so glad not I thought about that I thought you know God is a very present help in time of trouble and I just chose the words very present because it's not always in time of trouble that he's there sure he's there in time of trouble but how many believes that we need to have those peaceful times with him amen come to The Garden Alone amen where the do is still on the roses and so forth and have fellowship with almighty God amen have that wonderful relationship amen with walking and talking and communing with the Lord on a daily basis how many needs more of that Lord I want to talk to you and have fellowship with you on a daily B every day I want a fellowship with you amen not just call on you when I'm in trouble he already promised that he delivers out of all of those places don't be afraid of the mountain don't be afraid of the river don't be afraid of the fire and all of that I've got you how many believe that don't worry about this age don't worry about the Rapture whether or not you're going to make it believe that you're G to make it amen rest in him to Sure knowing that you're in his hands tomorrow morning I don't care what you face ain't no tell them what some of us will Face Tomorrow a't that right but said a lot of times that Mondays watch them Mondays that's when it's gets the roughest amen but whatever you face just call call him on the scene amen amen I like St John 14 because if you're walking with him talking with him then he says whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do amen verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater than the shall he do because I go unto my father amen how many knows that Jesus prayed that we would bring forth much fruit sometimes we don't have the things that we should have it's because we don't dare ask amen Bible says you ask not because you believe not he's right there to supply your need when you ask ask it and don't doubt that you'll get it how many believes you'll get it how many beli that when you ask him going down the road praying or wherever it is whatever he hears you ask anything in my name amen and I will do it I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you how many is that for the comfort that kind of comfort I want to conclude with Psalms amen and this is one of the last scriptures I ran across amen as I was looking for this amen all right let me see if I got it down here all right let me I got to figure out which one I wrote down here Psalms 139 yep I got the wrong one one Psalms 139 right here it is David expresses pretty much what I'm trying to express tonight in this Psalm he says oh Lord thou has searched me and known me th knowest my downs sittings and my uprisings how many know he know all about you thou understandest my thoughts my thought a far off he knows what you're GNA think tomorrow next week the week after that he knows all about it he knows your thoughts a far off thou compassest my path and my lying down h in other words the path that you walk and you're laying down he surrounds you how many these the angels of the Lord are camped round about them that fear him that's why I said earlier we may not have thought that you ever had an angel until you got saved but yeah you had an angel watching over you and motorcycle wreck and that crazy stuff that we did we had died many times brother John amen many of us can testify man I should have died in that I should have died no but God was watching over you th compassest my path and my lying down amen th Thou Art acquainted with all my ways that's right your ways yeah don't surprise God now he knows all about your ways amen for there is not a word in my tongue but lo oh Lord thou knowest it all together amen aren't you glad that a God that you serve a God that knows you like that that thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me amen thank you Lord how me believe he's laid his hand on you now oh my then Paul tries to express he says such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain to it in other words I can't imagine it God you knew me before I was ever born you know me you watched over me in my life you watched over me you forgave me I know that you delivered me from Goliath from the bear you're GNA take me all the way it's almost too high for me I just can't hard attain to it Paul I mean David says I can't hardly attain to it that God knows all these things amen such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain to it un it whether shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence amen a man running from the presence of God Amen what the prophet of God say if you're one of God's children you might as well quit running amen God's Gonna Get You amen amen everybody that's saved say God got me God God got me and I'm glad how many glad God got me am man you can't flee from his pres you can't run far enough they can put you over in the ocean and like they did Jonah you'll have a fish ready amen you ain't going nowhere why do you think he saved brother Brandon when he put a gun to his head when he put his hand on the wire he knew what he would think thinking he knew God knew always knew what he would be doing amen when I think about God knowing my thoughts and what I will think I try to think well Lord Jesus I love you you're awesome I love you God you're just so great I don't know if he saw me doing that but I I want that to be a part of it don't you I want to make sure I'm so thankful Lord that you have kept me I'm so thankful God that you have watched over me all my life praise God I love you Lord you knew I was going to say that before the foundation of the world Amen aren't you glad for him for watching over you where will I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there and here's the shocking part and if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there amen now our figure of speech is well you made your bed now sleep in it in other words it's the fruit of our own ways you got yourself into trouble now look no just it's your fault look at where you got yourself into it you made the bed sleep in it isn't that what David did David made him a bed in hell oh yeah when he went with B Sheba and all of this chaos that pursued and followed afterwards it was well hell yeah it was very hard very bad he says though he made his bed in hell God still didn't forsake Him aren't you glad when you mess up and you do things wrong and man how did I ever get myself in is God is there thank you Jesus why because he'll never leave you nor forsake you amen we might grieve him away but you might grieve him away but he won't go very far he'll be right there on the tree limb waiting for you to repent and get right back in there but he'll never forsake you because if he ever forsakes you boy you are in a whole lot of trouble it's going to be a bad day when he forsakes you amen well we know he won't forsake his children he simply won't do it but those make Believers ain't that right that get a dip in it you know they may have a touch of God but amen listen if I Ascend into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea amen even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me thank you Lord Jesus no matter where you go amen how many believes that those saints that were in God's hands down Through the Ages fed to Lions bur burnt it to steak amen think of the millions of people and Christians even that are drowned in the depths of the sea amen went down in those ships and all of that how many know God knows where every one of them is my mother-in-law was cremated she wasn't there she was cremated you know how they'll take a cremation and they'll take the ashes that's left and spread them out over water or over a mountain or wherever you want be scattered amen I don't like the idea of cremation brother John I don't like to look at the body down there yet and I like to think that hey God's not going to have a too big a problem amen with my body laying down there bringing it up but it don't matter where your B is it doesn't matter how far you are brother brandom said the gases of your body the atoms the molecules he's the one that put it together in the first place it won't be a problem for him to bring it back together come to a resurrection how many looking for a resurrection amen you ain't got to worry about the rest of the journey how many believes God help me not to worry Lord help me to trust you more amen that no matter because I'm telling you it's a thing of Faith to believe and to recognize the presence of God is with you at all times you are living by faith amen and anything is possible for you because you're living by faith you're living by the presence of God knowing that he promised that he'd never leave you that he would never forsake you that he is a very present help he's very present at all times we're fixing the clothes go back home maybe sing a couple songs yet but go back home and you can feel just as good at your house in your kitchen making your bloy sandwich or whatever you're doing go do tonight as you do you sitting right there how many believe that we don't leave it we don't leave the presence of God here God doesn't stay here can I say a little something stinging Hypocrites Hypocrites leave God at church all right we did our business at at church now I'm GNA go out and cheat and steal and lie and do my business huh no Hypocrites do that they leave God at church but not Christians Christians take him wherever they go wherever you are just call on my name amen and he'll answer God bless you musicians if you'll come I thought David did a wonderful job of just amen expressing it amen Psalms 139 if you want to read the rest of that chapter but David says some more interesting things in it it's very good stand with me tonight let's have a word of prayer first Lord Jesus as we bow our heads to the dust from where we have been made Lord Jesus but you have lifted us up Lord and filled us with your spirit you filled this dust Lord Jesus with your spirit Lord Jesus and We Want to Thank You Lord that you have promised that you would never leave us nor forsake us now as you said to Joshua as I was with Moses so will I be with you and you have given us that same promise that you gave to Joshua that as you was with your prophets and as you was with brother brandham so you would be with us we believe that promise God that you'd never leave us nor forsake us Lord whatever we would ask in your name there you would do and no matter where we would go or what we do Lord though we would get in trouble we wouldn't have to fear anything because you promised that you would be there Lord I ask tonight God in our heart's desire is that Lord help us to recognize that no matter what we face whether it's good bad good times bad times whether it's rivers or fires or trials help us to realize God you're there all we have to do is call on you and I ask God that you'd make each one father tonight stronger in faith in their situations not to fear not to let things bother them like they do so sometimes but to put our trust in you knowing you know all about us Lord Jesus you know every
