========================================
[Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right [Music] thank you [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] stand with me if you will um children are dismissed to Sunday school um we're going to turn to Psalms 57 but uh before we do I'm just going to ask Brother David to open up the surface of fire David corset commitment and um Psalms 57 I will start with yeah verse one of course be merciful unto me o God be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in me yea in the shadow of thy Wings well I'm will I make my refuge and until these calamities be overpassed he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up Salah God shall send forth his Mercy in his truth okay be thou exalted o God above the heavens let thy glory be above all the Earth my heart is fixed oh God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise right now I will praise thee O Lord among the people I will sing unto thee among the Nations this last one together be thou exalted o God above the heavens let thy glory be above all the Earth Amen brother Brian brothers and sisters you know that Psalm was just read you know what the enemy decides to use his evil against you God turns it against him so isn't that a comforting thought whatever your enemies out there are trying to devise against you God will use their own snare the snare they're trying to use against you be the snare that God will destroy them with if you return with me to uh John the eighth chapter foreign there we go you know I was just thinking there this morning you know you can compare yourself you prepare yourself all your life for a day or whatever you're going to do you can prepare for it but if God ain't in it it doesn't mean anything whatever you think you might say or what you're not going to say it doesn't mean anything unless God I was in it so everything that we do as Christians is individuals serving the lord it depends on one thing and one thing only the spirit of Jesus Christ abiding in our hearts and lives and I was reading here in the eighth chapter of John but I was sitting there thinking you know there's three levels we're at uh right now you're either living below your privileges this morning when you came here you're living at your privileges or you're so embraced the purposes that God gives you that you're living above those privileges right now and only you can tell where you're at whether you're living alone or you're living above them but you don't have to be that way I mean God has made a way for you all this morning to live in the Privileges he's provided for you through Jesus Christ this morning and to even reach out in faith and try to live above those privileges that God has for us but uh this is I was reading this this morning reading a lot of like this morning you know he has series of messages he preaches and I was re you know I've been in my office he's got several messages on investments I was listening to but the thing that struck me about prophetically how he was speaking you know in our day and he was freaking um and I was I just wrote my own note about it and he was telling the people your vices will kill you whatever your vices are this morning if you don't get the victory over them this morning they'll be the thing that destroys you on that day and uh everyone has their own their own weaknesses that they have to struggle with every day but if you don't get a control of them and you don't let Jesus Christ minister to you to remove them from you they'll be the very thing that destroys you and just like I was saying earlier about having snares you don't want those snares that the enemy sets before you to be the thing that you get trapped in but I was I was just listening to what he had to say this morning and you know this is I mean I'm 63 years old and so he's preaching this message almost 60 years ago and he was talking about drunk driving and I'm listening to him you know I wasn't 20 years old in 1959 but if you told a grown man in 1959 that if he got caught Punk driving that he needed to be in prison for 10 years I'm sure a 20 year old in 1959 or 1960 would have thought that was a horrible thing that he shouldn't be accountable for his bad behavior and then I was listening you know that's prophetic where where we're at today if you get caught drunk driving you're not going to be driving anymore if you accidentally kill somebody while you're drunk driving then you're going to jail for a long time and he was speaking this back in 1959 and 1960 and I was he was also talking about a lot of times let me let me just read before I just spend the whole time talking here let me read what I was reading this morning and he in his eighth chapter of John there's a lot of different areas in this eighth chapter but I'm going to start about the 21st verse of the eighth chapter of John you know no it doesn't mean anything unless you project God's word and he goes on to say here then say Jesus again unto them I go my way and you shall seek me and shall die in your sins whether I go you cannot come and then he's talking about the Pharisees and Sadducees it's no different today for people today and he says then said the Jews will kill himself because he says whether I go you cannot come and he said unto them ye are from beneath and I am from about year of this world and I am not of this world I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for you believe not that I am he and you shall die in your sins it hasn't changed today it's that scripture means the same thing today as we did two thousand years ago you either embrace the truth of the out and the word of God or the same judgment will be upon you he goes on to say then say they unto him who art thou and Jesus saith unto them even the same I said unto you from the beginning so they just couldn't hear his words um you can say well they weren't predestinated to hear it or whatever it is they just want receiving the seed as he was given it and he goes on many many things I have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and I speak to the to the world those things which I have heard of him they understood not that he spake of them of the father then Jesus said unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that I am he or that I do nothing of myself but as the father hath taught me I speak these things and he that hath sent me is with me and the father has has not left me alone for I do always those things that please him and I know that's where you all want to be this morning everything you do you want to do to please him and he spake these words many believe on him then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my words then ye are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and that's where we're at this morning you if the truth is in your heart turning abiding in you it's made you free this morning doesn't mean that you don't have struggles no it doesn't mean that but you have the earnest of the believing in what God has provided for us this morning and I was just I'll just sit down as if I was listening to those uh to those messages and he was talking about natural business but he really was talking in a spiritual sense and uh I know I don't mean to be funny but you know a lot of times you think you can make a quick Buck or a quick dollar but I just rubbed my it's not as good as it seems you know when someone's trying you sell you something you always got to think in yourself it's not as good as it seems to be on the outside and what he means by that is any good businessman if he's got a perspective or he has an investment or maybe a new business that he's going to open up he'll do a business plan and that business plan and he'll do the research that's required to whether that business will be successful whether that investment will be successful but as Christians you're no different and it's not a business plan but for you to be successful you have to apply the principal that God in his word gave to us to be successful you know like brother Brian said your ABCs you always believe Christ you have to have those principles and that investment will come back to you and then he and he was basically saying there's only one way about it there's only way that you'll be successful in anything you do is if you put the word of God before you and you walk in it but the I'll finish with this thought I don't have a lot to say this morning and I meant not to say that you know everyone when they get to when they grow wherever you're from you'll have acronyms I don't know if that's too big of a word that you find yourself you try not to reuse those things every day in your life but sometimes you can only be what you are but what I thought was funny about what Rhonda Brown was saying and it really speaks to the the day that we're in right now later whatever it is that we would be man of God doesn't steal other sheep and I was just thinking about that you know you don't try to cross our people to your need or to your cause you just present the gospel and you let Jesus Christ pray we're about to change in people's heart and lives you know it's I know it's the world that we live in it's growing churches making they want a thousand people in their Church you know but brother Randall we said I'd rather have three that believe the word of God than have a thousand they don't you know your church reflects basically everything about a church is reflected not on it the pastor of I don't know where I'm going it's not really the pastors the ministry for the church but if you don't have people believing the word of God where Jesus Christ is abiding in the heart and lives of those people that if it's like the pastor's trying to hurt cats basically it's just having a whole bunch of cats there with no purpose they're all gone oh it's in Jesus Jesus Christ everything online correctly Brother David foreign Lord with all your heart this morning amen let's stand if we could this morning and I mean it's just good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen let's sing that little course on 582 I've got something that the world can't give and the world

our time this morning would that be okay hey amen and so amen maybe even have an altar call at the end we'll see what the Lord does Amen because we just want to really see something we wouldn't we want to possess amen more than what we possess no matter what state that you are in your Christian walk amen um where is that found anyway in uh the scriptures having a let me see I believe it's Galatians I don't like this read that but I'm not sure if I can find it right quick Philippians not Galatians amen if you will stand with me we'll just get into the word of God this morning and we'll start amen would that be okay amen but uh um I just I was I'm going to read this but I think I will it just comes to my mind amen but so grateful Lord Jesus that because of calvary we can have a Clear Channel open before your guard you said ask anything in my name and that I'll Do Lord Jesus and you many times said whatever you will ask in my name I'll do it father and Lord this morning we're so glad when we do ask something that you are there to hear his father Lord know your words yours you have said that if a child asks for a bread will he give him a stone or a serpent or something like that but no you'll give him to give us just what we have need of Lord we thank you for being such a great God like you are an awesome savior a wonderful husband a great lover just just a wonderful God just we just can't worship you enough so many times we come asking so much and we just don't tell you how much we appreciate you and how great you are and how we want to glorify your name and and and reflect you greater in our lives Lord Jesus and we thank you God for the sermon brother Danny preached Thursday night on being the light of the world God and that's what we want to be we just want to be a greater light to you Lord let our light shine before for men that gay may see our good works and glorify God in heaven Lord now Lord we ask God that you'll bless the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you laid upon our heart and come into exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask us think in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen in Philippians if you want to go to Philippians the third chapter 10. we'll begin with uh verse 7 chapter 3 the Philippians Philippians 3 and begin with verse seven but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ yet doubtless I have I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ my lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but down that I may win Christ and be found in him having not my own righteousness which is in the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead I want you to understand what Paul is talking about he's talking about attaining to something isn't that right amen possessing something getting to something receiving something making a goal getting somewhere isn't that right amen if by any means I'm not attaining to the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained amen either were already perfect amen I didn't even realize that what word was in there I see why the Holy Spirit went in there because I'm gonna talk about that for quite a bit already even though I were not yet already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I also am apprehended in Christ Brethren I count myself not as has to having apprehended but there's one thing I do forgetting of things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I pressed towards to mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded amen and if there be any other things otherwise might have got will reveal even this to you the way I read that is if all those that desire Perfection you need to have this mindset how many believes you got to have a mindset for perfection amen amen so that's one one just one of the things that I really desire and want to have amen and that is to come to that Perfection that Jesus told and wanted and desired of us to have how many believes that Jesus wants us to be perfect amen perfect in Christ and there's a big difference of course we've got to realize amen that in the flesh you'll make mistakes but in the spirit you can walk I believe that a man can walk perfectly with God amen Joshua chapter 1. Joshua chapter 1. I hope you have a tab because I don't have him in my new Bible I'm going to see if they sell those little tabs that I can stick on there and make my make me a set of tabs I gotta have them tapped I'm spoiled amen now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord wait a minute now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I give them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread that have I given unto you even as I said unto Moses amen may God add His blessings to reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen we all know that this was a type amen of uh and a new testament promise amen amen and that new testament is the promise of the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost is a Promised Land amen I believe it was in Acts 2 38 he talks about it you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for he says for the promise is to you to your children to them that are far off amen even as many as the Lord Our God shall cause so the New Testament promised of course and we talk about this a lot and I believe that it's essential that we do talk about because we really don't emphasize we don't really grasp I don't think sometimes as I were thinking you know that the importance and the greatness of the Holy the indwelling Holy Spirit In God's people in you and in me amen when you don't realize how important that is how great that is amen and I wanted to say you know even even Christ when he was speaking of it and then he talks about how that you know uh this morning as we talk about possessing the land and amen to battle and you have to fight and you know to get these possessions Amen to get the possession that God has promised you Amen brother says brother Footprints means possession ministering better don't be afraid to put Footprints where God has told you to go it's possession he told Joshua everywhere The Souls of your feet said it's yours amen we don't back up we take what God said that it's the truth no matter what the opposition is how great it seems well how difficult it seems if God said so it's yours amen praise be to God listen when he gave it to Joshua he said never said he said I'll take all he bites and the Palestine and all in our out and so forth and give it to your Joshua had to fight for every inch of ground amen but God was with him and every inch of ground you'll cover brother you've got to make Footprints you fight for every way every go all the way through you'll fight for it but take the severe the spirit The Sword and the spirit brother and move right on praise be to God how many believes that I don't care I believe that this message this morning is for somebody perhaps it's just starting in the Lord it could be for something that hadn't even started in the low but it can be for a person that's been going like me for I don't know how many years so many I forget how many years I've been serving the lord now but it it one thing I know is that I'm forgetting to pass it I'm still trying to make go come on amen praise be to God another thing I thought about thinking about realized what God has given us the hope that we have not only the hope that we have but the god that we have the promises that we have everything that is yours amen I listened to the message possessing the Gate of the enemy after trial and better man was talking about and he's talking about how that you know uh you know and owner wasn't that one it was um uh possessing all things I mean listen to the other one also but it was in possessing all things they talked about how that and then you might be a powerful you might be poor you may not have nothing but the Bible says that all things are yours amen whether things present or whether things in the future whether it's Paul or whether it's cephas or if it's Apollos amen whether things present future amen all things are yours everything I mean as you both know you the meat shall inherit the earth amen my and I thought people you know people think they're rich people think they're a billionaire they're rich and I thought you know I with a whole lot it's worth more than a billion dollars to me to have peace of mind Amen to have peace with God it's worth more than the billion dollars it meant millions of dollars all of that it don't never compare to have peace in your heart to be able to sleep at night and to know where you come from and oh where are you going I didn't pay a million billions of dollars remember brother Bob talked about the evil queen one time he says and you know she would have guessed that she would give her okay think how much you could have five more minutes of life huh maybe she was an evil queen maybe she needed five more get things right with God that's the most horrible thing that ever can happen to a human being is to leave this world without God amen it forfeit their whole Kingdom so this morning I want you to know amen it takes a giving all like brother Brian was talking about you know if you really want to get something from God you got to give it to you all until you make room for him you've got to make moon for him gotta make no room for him amen all the time he's taken up [Music] huh we're too busy with everything else that's why we ain't spiritual like we ought to be they'll probably ain't got joy like we ain't got that's what we ain't gonna shout there ain't no shouting no more ain't no prayer because we're too busy with other things amen it is time let me tell you something it's time to have a possession not just a confession there's a big difference between a confession and a possession [Music] oh my God let me show you what I got wrote down here you know Jesus says amen try to get ready he never said get ready he said be ready [Music] [Applause] you know how many people are gonna miss it because you're getting ready means you ain't ready [Applause] that means you're waiting amen that's how we want to be

good just oh my just thinking about it foreign talked about you know we're just tapping the surface of this when you study you realize hey you were just tapping the surface of it you know what comes to my mind with Thomas Byler my mind I get to thinking about how so you know the only way that you're ever going to get more is is to take more time in it because I get so busy with everything else huh and so Holy Spirit tells me you know you got to be less busy oh can I just preach the simple gospel we need to be more like Walmart we need to roll back some things it's time to roll back some of the things that you're doing and make more time for God it's rollback time amen roll back the things in the world and bring on the things that this man that's right oh my I'm so glad that the same power of the Holy Ghost is still here this morning that he was in any of the previous Services any of the previous Messengers that God has sent [Music] huh God is still just to smell the holy spirit is just as real but you got to want to possess you got to go in there comes a time I mean as it comes a time like it did there with Joshua now look the past pass but Joshua When God says go forward you go forward it's time now the time is coming time less set for the top for the bra I do it's come for me it's come for you that it's time to go in and to possess the land everything that God has brought to you you need to possess it it don't need to be on tapes and books it needs to be in your heart it needs to be in your life [Applause] that's where it needs to be do you know what the biggest stumbling block is to the world or anybody in your neighborhood what is it the prophet of God said if somebody has a profession but it doesn't have a possession they're going to stumble people like you ain't never seen can I say something else go ahead brother Byler that's what I would like to hear together somebody said that right think about it the imperfection at the imperfection in your

that rich imperfection in your life is a stumbling block to your neighbor to your worker to your boss those around you amen that's why I want to strive for perfection I'm a preacher that believes in pressing Powers perfection no matter how many failures you have I don't care how many failures you ever I have you get up and you strive for perfect because when you give up you can't get into getting

Holy Ghost you ain't got to wish anymore oh I waste my sins for forgiven that I had the baptism and all this let me tell you whenever God forgives you of your sins and you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost she's smart you got joy in your heart that means god accepted your sacrifice and he washed your sins away and he filled you with the Holy Ghost you ain't gonna wish for the Holy Ghost no more [Music] [Applause] that's what I want to do I want to process the land not wish I had it yeah amen Jesus brother bam says Jesus what did he do when he fought the devil he fought him with the simple word of God he didn't do great science and wonders and spring lightning bolts down and have speaking in tongues and everything else and oh this no he just told him the word brother bam says and

it's your possession he died for it I'm gonna take a break no no one more good thing that I found out about this whole thing whenever the prophet had preached on possessing the enemy's gate he went to the word of God and he went to a promise of God and God told Abraham your seed Shout possess the gates of its enemies you are ordained to take it from the devil you are [Applause] I don't know but you can't help it God puts it in there he ordains you to take the devil's gates from it well it's nothing but hope and joy think about this life is depressing and sorrow and sadness but this is Hope and joy amen I see shall listen get possessed the Gate of their enemy you believe that Hallelujah amen amen hadn't preached like that month I need more of this possession don't you think need more of that possession I want more but more Jesus more and more and more and I get more and I get more and I get more help me please I give more you gotta get more hey God has blessed most of us with good businesses good finances most of us hello but you know I think it's time to cut back a little bit make sure your business doesn't take away time from God you're smart enough to get rich on business this isn't everything else it's time to be smart enough to make sure that your spirit is ready to meet the Lord in 2023 and if that means cutting back a little cut back we got time to pay for the service time climb to pray for the man of God cause I'll tell you right now the problem to God tell when the man of God back there praying the way he ought to pray and then expecting of God and you are out here expecting from God when he comes forth and he speaks it's DNA speaking speaking to the church quick this lollygagging as you might say no more Wows you Ozzy wooing huh oh praise the Lord you love the Lord this morning [Applause] notice this no more wazzy wooing he told Joshua every place that the soul of your feet treads that I have given you well let me tell you I think one of the greatest things that we can possess of course is the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you abide in me and I in you you shall what ask what you will I believe this morning that you and I in 2023 we can walk like Enoch walked how did he walk the Bible says that he had this testimony before I left that he please God please God that's what we want we want to be pleasing him we want to walk back in our God Jesus says Be You perfect Paul said you know I fail at Birth and for you until Christ deformed in you is that right how many wants more of God listen to this even Paul says he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and pastors and teachers for the imperfecting himself for the perfecting of the Saints I believe now you oh my how many knows did you just need a closer walk you need to be perfectly in Christ that's why I believe this morning that it'll probably touch each and every last one of us and maybe because we can all go a little deeper in Christ that we need to give more of ourselves more surrendered to class than what we are every aspect of our life to be surrendered to God because that's what it takes to be surrendered to be pleasing to the Lord It's a complete surrender to God oh my God I have given you Footprints meant Victory and it's the same thing tonight if you're paralyzed and you can't wiggle a finger see God I want to wiggle a finger that's right you promised me I could do it and I'll lay there and wiggles till I I do wiggle it oh my don't be a person that gives up huh let me tell you I most of my life I don't say this in the carnival way but I always like to lift a little weights I always like to do a little weights and so forth and as I get older my right arm I can lift so much weight up this one just won't go this hurts I don't know what it is in there I don't even want to clean anything but something in my shell of my arm so I thought well I could just quit can you imagine what it'd be like and what I'd be sure you know if you didn't have any kind of physical exercise at all you'd be oh my I've been there right after last August after that sickness that went through and all of that you know I was in the middle probably of 700 points on my on my sugar and so forth and I got out of the house and in all of that craziness I just felt like I got to do so I got and I just ran I just went and took off run I gotta run I gotta do something if that's something how the doctor says now do you get plenty of exercise something told me how you need exercise I felt like I was gonna die if I don't do something but listen you know yeah and you either you either give it up but or you say look I'll do everything I can with what I can if I gotta go lower down I go lower down I'll do what I do but I'm not giving up I'm not stopping tell you something that's weird you are spirited no I don't care if you're sick I don't care what your ailment is huh so I can't move your arm on me he said just wiggle the finger after why you'll be amen you'll be running after a while that's the way it is you're spiritually where you're not where you want to be keep taking another step make another step forward just wanna say I want to go further with God amen because our goal my heart's desire as a pastor is the same as that of Paul I travail in birth I trivial until Christ is fully formed in every one of us we're not evening like Tabernacle we're not bickering little babies anymore fussing and fighting and fussing about Let It Beady issues and this that or the other brother bam says you're still in kindergarten when you're fussing you're fussing you're still in the kindergarten we're beyond that and I'm glad of it amen we're ready for deeper things come on hey hey man listen for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that's my goal today how about yours I'm going to come to the Statue of the fullness of Christ so people can see Christ in me no matter where I am no matter what I'm doing hey man no matter where where I am no matter what you're doing people can see the reflection of Christ and you know amen that's our goal that's what you can have I simply be leaving it amen foreign he told Joshua there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with you can I just say what comes to mind as I was with the prophet of God brother Madam so I will be with you how many believes that same God that came down and Vindicated himself and proved himself it's the same God that's here this morning I'm going to thirst for more of the power of God Amen the Bible's too even Jesus says it works did I do shall you do also until we are so in Christ that we don't do our own work but we work his works I mean with me let's do his work do what he do and the world won't see him no more but you will see him because he will be manifesting himself to you and to me that's the greatest thing that a man can possess to know that God is with you and in you amen oh my praise be to God that fullness that would come to the fullness of Christ now I want to skip down just a little bit and I want to read this here now notice and today the Church of the Living God has the privilege of standing and seeing the Conquering resurrected Jesus Christ I want to Lord willing I wanted to preach this sermon now for the last couple weeks it's been ruined in my heart but there's another one that I want to preach on that was our responsibility and how did the prophet said and he I he would tell the people of did you see him here now what will you do with Jesus called the Christ and all the things that he showed and how that you and I ought to be telling others of what Christ has done all these different aspects of what Christ does and R.A has done through Brother Band Ministry is doing in our lives hello and uh oh my we ought to be telling that we ought to be shouting it from the house tops amen and telling them you know where Christ is that he came and showed himself proved himself now notice how he says he's standing here the resurrected Jesus Christ the son of the Living God standing present living in his church doing the same things that he did he may says then we possess the Gate of every enemy he says and if you've got an enemy this morning then brother there's only if you are a Seed of Abraham hearing this there's not enough devils in hell that can keep that gate before you it'll open notice how he says there will be no man be able to stand before you he'll probably saying you know if you're a seed of Abram you heard this message amen I want to tell you they a devil in hell that could keep you from the promise of God there's nothing that can keep you if you believe with all of your heart aren't you glad I don't care what it is you walk up there to that promising and say I claim this from but this is mine the Bible says the shall possess the gates of the enemy that's what I'm happy about when I read that I'm so happy I just got to tell you again aren't you glad that that's the promise of God it's not really you doing it brother bottle didn't just come up with this message the Holy Spirit spoke to his heart he is the one that's doing it promise that his seed would process the Gate of the enemy that's what we're going to do that's what we do because he said in his word can't fail I wish I had wings I'd fly right over everybody I sure would think about it you will possess the gates of the enemy he'll see to it that you do amen praise be to God aren't you glad he didn't have the kind of good work is also able to perform it in the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to heal all sickness in the Church of the Living God lays the power to overcome all temptation in the

for I'll be with you even in you amen oh can I just go slow I was listening to brother but I'm telling the story of the fisherman who remember to see fisherman and a little boy that went to his mom and went to Sunday school teacher went to the preacher said can I see God none of them could see God and he met his old fisherman when after rain and so forth they were in the boat oaring and so forth he dramatized it you know and tears were flowing down the old man's eyes and the young boy says can you answer me a question did not my mom and my daddy my my pastor couldn't tell me he says can a man see God and that old man touched him on his shoulder and says my son all I had seen for the last 40 years is God amen I took me a little run out of the driveway this morning just to get my energy up and so forth ran out there him into the peak of my driveway now that's you know I've got a big Bluff going down over and I decided to just go down to the edge of that bluff there was a little level places right there I went down to dancing Bluff and just enjoyed it you know before I even went down down there I went up there and leaned against the tree and I said God this is like touching you

hell's gonna be it's ain't gonna have a lick of Life they ain't gonna have a treat I have nothing that God created no son no word no nothing it's gonna be a horrible place for people amen how many of these you can see God everywhere I'm glad to see him aren't you glad to see him in your life let me just say something that comes to mind I believe amen as somebody said to me this week he says brother I want you to know amen that I passed the test and I thought you know that's exactly right this let this be a year brothers and sisters that we passed the tests that God sends our way the trials that he'd go on sometimes he eats anonymous hello but God help us somebody's with me let's count to test that God sends our way let's be victorious let's not be defeated don't have a wishbone huh what was it that I wrote down here overcome don't be overcome remember being overcome and having a wishbone is kind of like Israel after ache in sin right after eight consent they had a mighty Victory I mean they took dereko and not even a scratch not a Band-Aid nobody got hurt nobody got killed not even a scratch and then he says after Aiken took that wedge and he wasn't supposed to and then 36 men lost their lives they presumed they went up to Eli I believe it was AI or something like that they went up there to fight against them and just a small group and they only send a small bunch and guess what they came back with 36 men dead let me tell you something that's sad that's sorrow that's not victory no that's what is in that's boy that's a terrible place to be it's a living defeat amen and they had to get that thing cleaned out and scouted out oh my you better get rid of that thing that that hurts you that thing that overcomes you better get rid of that thing huh because guess what God didn't listen very merciful the Aiken his wife his family his children and all that belongs to me all that stone they killed them all get rid of that evil ammonia can we say May that Lord give us victory over any evil in our life anything that's wrong get rid of it Hallelujah another thing this is kind of for the young people Brother Band went and seen a stadium remember he went into a certain stadium and it had a saying over the top he says it's not the size of the dog in the fight but it's the size of the fighting the dog folks I'm here to tell you young people it isn't your size young men it isn't whether you're a real tall dark and handsome you might be a scruffy looking little fella huh but a bam said that David was a ruddy looking little fella Sam's in the Ruddy little it ain't what she looks like it's probably what's in here young ladies it's not whether you are the most beauty queen that's not what it's all about but it's what's on the inside that counts what makes a difference having a standard and loving the Lord that's worth more than any beauty loving the Lord for a young man it's more than handsomeness and beauty isn't that right it's not portion to what you look like or what you are it's or or these things don't have a complex Hallelujah you love the Lord oh I'm so happy for that amen Glory now notice this aren't you happy this morning he got to talk about it Christ conquered it all let me just say this I don't guess I got my paper today yeah I did I already read it but talking about having to fight how many believes that deer fight even as brother Phil was here when he spoke about he says you know the main fight that you have is where your battle is right here so when you gotta fight for every inch you don't have to fight some demonized some bad Spirit you gotta fight this self this is where you gotta fat this is where you gotta battle if you can go overcome that thing and you can whip yourself and I do realize that till your dying day you're gonna have a battle because that thing will always want to resurrect and all I always want to come back but you can get it so whipped under the Holy Ghost until the desires of synagogue any preaches that tells you different is lying huh it'll come back on you if you let it sure if you're drawn away with your own lusts the Bible says to induce and so forth in the Lord it brings forth sin but if you can oh God help us in the property God say you man can't live in such a way until God the Devils don't know what to do with him that just comes to me how many wants to be there Lord give me that that's my possession I'm gonna live in such a way to devil devil to do with me because I'm here as a witness the devil has every tricking folks when for all these things that the devil was trying at me I said boy I'll tell you what has the devil got any more in his book yeah I've been there laughs and it wasn't me that was Victorious but it was him [Applause] and it was Christ amen because I'm a Seed of Abraham are you a Seed of Abraham really are you a Seed of Abraham there you go oh that's very little more perseverance [Applause] oh can I just read something that comes to mind like gold buddy Robinson he testimony Lord give me the saxophone uh backbone of us all give me a testimony and so forth he says that's the way to do it brother get some spunk about you get some spunk about you stand up and claim your god-given privileges [Music] god promise you healing it's yours if you're too weak to and a jellyfish should take it you'll die amen but you got to stand up and say that's right I'll stand for it Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord it's back to my quote aren't you happy this morning to know that we can stand now more than conquer more than a conqueror oh the there's nothing to I mean those sometimes we say we gotta fight and sometimes we don't say just let the Lord fight your battle for you let me tell you sir your battle is in getting yourself surrendered to God if you can get through that battle and surrender yourself to God God will take care of the rest of it then he fights your battles you can burn you can go back then you can have yourself a dance to Jubilee well what God is dealing with your devil that's trying to destroy you know full got more convinced that anybody wants to come and hurt you he wants to destroy you he says all I can say is you've got to deal with God [Applause] you want to get to me you got to go through him be my guest whoa oh yeah I'm gonna say something that comes to mind might hurt a little bit if you don't want to obey your pastor I'll turn you over to Christ for your correction we'll see how that goes let me tell you something my spanking from the Lord spanks me it's hard it's rough folks I got spankings from the Lord years ago I still remember today I'm like whoa that hurts my heart but I needed it thank you Lord huh oh yeah we need correction amen go in and possess it it's yours you ain't got to Terry you ain't gotta wait there for you right now nothing to fight about the fight's over the whistles blow the flags Rose triumphant how many [Applause] how many has marked how many drink happened how many see how many still with the Holy Ghost then the victory is yours the flag is raised the battle's over [Music] it's already won he battled it he won it he Gethsemane he suffered on County PK device and he gave you the victory if you could just believe it and accept it he had to fight it thank you amen don't get me started Hallelujah you love him nothing to fight about that's right the flag's Rose and in the midst of every sin Pile in the midst of every sick room there's an old ruggage cross planted by the blood of Jesus grave pile that we just buried sister Johnny's and every funeral and everybody popped as he all right across that will rise again will live eternally he'll come back and receive us unto himself you can have victory Hallelujah every sick room the old record Christ planted by the blood of Jesus Christ is conqueror only thing we have to do is believe look and live I'll be with you amen praise be to God I will prove people coming to last and say well well that was no I'll be with you even in you that right and the Very things that he did here on Earth I'll be in you doing the very same things then you'll know and then you'll see me amen the seat of Abraham they'll see me praise the Lord Hallelujah don't you just love it possessing the gates of our enemies come like Jesus Christ I had a thought that I'm going to say that you have to be careful about your attitude Towers so be careful yesterday I was just doing things on the farm and so forth and doing this that or the other and staying busy doing whatever and think about the Lord and the thought came to me that if I'm going to do something I would want to do it I would ask a question what would brother Branham do what would brother Branham do what would better Brandon do well you know we have to say what would Jesus do right I thought well that's that's strange isn't it you know if if he wasn't careful might offend somebody well because we're supposed to see what Jesus would do but I went back and I thought you know Paul said follow me and then another place he says the things that you have seen in me the thing too he told Timothy Paul said but you see me after Jesus Paul said follow me do as I do I believe it'd be all right well I want to ask about doing this situation I believe he'll be all right don't you that's right because we know where he was with God amen if I have a goal and I've had the mission number one is to be like Christ and also if you'll notice he said brother random was our leader and you look to him and you realize that God was so powerful so much in him until he could speak to a couple on the front pew I promise you he could have spoke them out of existence I promise you and it'll be remember you know we always waiting for the third pull this is some of the goals I'm going to close with the third poem said you went to third pool again talking about speaking things into existence we may have to speak food into existence whatever that all means hello but speaking the word but that's not I believe it's not just for them I believe it's supposed to be here now he said he's proved himself to be here now because I'm here to tell you wherever Christ is all things are possible at all times you ain't got to wait till later it may manifest Peter like he said but even him out hunting how much he didn't have to have food he wasn't starving but God knows that he desire to have some squirrels and he says you speak where you want those squirrels to come and he picked trees and dead trees and places that that a squirrel he knewed squirrels very well like we know deer hunting and you know what trees he go on he says I want him to come up here go over there and sit there I want the other one to come up over here he'll go over that's it amen about five of them I believe it was and he spoke all of those and all of a sudden there they were he said he spoke them into existence and shot him and ate him if he can speak things into existence he could have spoke of out of existence if God told him and gave him the permission but I may notice God had matured the prophet to the place that he could trust him and instead of examine him instead of saying you'll drop dead and have another ananias and Sapphira but remember says he to come back in the church he says I forgive you for that and he said the right thing he had the right attitude how many would say Lord help me in every situation help me to say the rights word how many to do the right thing let me be like the prophet amen because he was like Christ amen they have that kind of power takes like surrendered life how many believes that currency created life to God Hallelujah I want more of Jesus more and more and more I want more of Jesus so I'll give him more of me how many is with me this morning amen praise be to God you love the Lord isn't he wonderful to come and talk to us like that have to get a little hard just wake us up make us realize hey you're not where you need to be you haven't detained yet you haven't gotten there yet but we are going to get there that's what we're here this morning to come to better ourselves say God I want to possess it this morning I want to be there I want to be ready [Music] the only way I can do that is to surrender myself let me tell you something and I I don't want to go along but just a couple more minutes I ain't even a regular time the greatest hindrance and stumbling block to people around us is it a Pharisee is that right they went to church they had the long clothes they had the looks but inside they were what Jesus says you're inside full of dead men's bones your ravening wolves your wolves are sheep's clothes [Music] another scripture just comes to me and I'll just repeat it but first second Peter first chapter he says you know add Faith statue of a perfect man and I take my time man I'm just going to skip over all of this if I don't stop but I wanted to speak on this remember the satch of a perfect man is following the first second Peter the first chapter add to your faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and God leads our lives are like that pyramid how many believes God is building and he's building and building and a building and a building and the building in the building until I believe when we come up into that perfect love until man-made doesn't matter if they come in here and shoot me in the head it don't matter if they kill me I'll still pray for them God forgive them for they don't know what they did have perfect love for those who do you wrong whatever the Capstone be in love and then you're ready for speaking squirrels into existence or what whatever but our lives brothers and sisters Even in our Tabernacle you saved our lives are like a pyramid God is building upon building up in the Most Holy Faith until we've come to the full stature of the perfect man that's what God how many believe that's what God is looking for how many believes that's what God is coming for that's what I'm interested in what is God coming for that's my responsibility by the unction of the holy spirit is to bring to you what it's going to take to have you there amen I don't know who that's going to be but whoever's going to be there's going to be some of us making I trust it'll be all of us but God ordained it come to the full stature of Christ and Christ is ruling
