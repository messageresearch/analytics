let's sing that little course of amazing graces for the bread comes tonight amen oh it's a mate sing grace [Music] [Applause] but now [Music] it was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] through many dangers [Music] jerseys [Music] and great will lead me home amen good to be in the house of the lord tonight i think that'll be all for the music we're going to uh it'll be a little different tonight and while you're while you're standing if you want to be turning into your bibles and to the book of ezekiel certainly appreciate your everyone's effort to come out tonight and i know there's there's many out in sickness that sound like the devil's certainly on a rampage uh and uh wednesday nights are always seem to be a little different it's no different for the preacher it's it seems to be a little different for the for the audience sometimes the preacher he's he still has to put in the same amount of time and energy and effort and and prayer to get to get to something together uh the way the lord would see so but we appreciate your effort to come out if you've worked outside you probably felt like you've been sitting on the surface of the sun today so you're tired and and we're going to try not to hold you too long tonight maybe just to just take our time for just a little bit and slow things down a little bit tonight i've enjoyed the wednesday night services bro the baller has been been bringing to us kind of slowing down and kind of giving a chance to to communicate back and forth and and we're just going to try to continue uh it seemed like that's kind of the thought that's going forward and we just want to kind of continue that thought and continuity with what he's been bringing and and with what the lords do for us so ezekiel 37 and we'll look there if you've got your scofield bible it's page 881 i always like the the scofield bible just because uh if i can't find the scripture i can look at carson's and he's already got it and i'm gonna look and see what page he's on so uh i tell you what sometimes i the kids make me make me feel uh that they can get there quicker than i can what i'm trying to say they they can flip through the scriptures so very familiar scripture here ezekiel 37 the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and causing me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry and we look at what the definition of dry we think in our mind we know it's it's simple we know the elementary word of dry and it's easy and it is just what it says it says it's free from liquid especially water and the analogy they give is dry as they bone they were very dry and he said unto me son of man look at how he addressed him son of man he's saying son of adam the descendant of adam son of man can these bones live and i answered oh lord god thou knowest and again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and i say unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold and i will cause what breath to enter into you and what ye shall live so if i could hold your attention tonight for about 45 minutes as you're seated may the lord add his blessings to the reading of the word i'd like to speak to you on the subject of ye shall live ye shall live and i was found this quote and brother branham was talking and he was talking to about a brother cobble i think it was and he said he was talking about a very beautiful picture and then he says oh it's a sad one in a way the condition of our hearts our hearts condition of the world how we are becoming dry towards the lord brothers and sisters there's a desensitizing of our godly spiritual selves happening in the world today when you look at in the world right is wrong and wrong is right man is woman woman is man or they're both and technology is feeding this to us faster than our minds can process that we're being fooled that we're being tricked by the devil and that the devil is constantly pushing and drowning us in these thoughts of deception and desensitizing us as christians we know right from wrong but yet as we listen and watch the news and the technology man what is right what is wrong and he says if you notice you i go out into the deserts many times i walk into the desert of california and arizona and through them places and every weed that you find's got a sticker on it he says because it's dry a dry climate it just develops stickers everything out there's got a sticker he said but you take and change that same variety of weed and put it up into the country where there's a lot of rain and a lot of swamp and he said it's just as soft as it can be he said it's just as soft as it can be the water makes the difference the water makes the difference and you take a people or a church that's just so dry they never have prayer meetings they become stickers they're just finding fault and sticking at one another uh oh but all we need is a good rain to soften us up a little bit he said don't you think so he said i like to live at the spout i like to live at the spout where there's plenty of rain falling and i can just keep getting softened up you know that's the best place to live is where the rain's falling see if the church is all dry there's no spirit in it it's got little stickers and what it needs is a good old-fashioned holy ghost rain to soften up the church one of the strangest but most famous passages in the bible we find here in ezekiel 37 and this ezekiel 37 has inspired numerous sunday school lessons it's inspired songs and sermons you know the song ezekiel connected them dry bones ezekiel connected them dry bones ezekiel in the valley of the dry bones now hear ye the word of the lord it's inspired by the scripture you know how it goes it's bones connect the bone this bone comes to this bone and this bone comes back to this bone and this is all taking place and on and on and on them dry bones the prophet ezekiel is led into this valley filled with damn dry bones and as ezekiel is looking out across the pews i i mean looking out across the valley if something gets sticky if the preacher let me tell you a little secret about preachers if they're saying something is sticky to you they've already stuffed themselves plenty of times with it so he's looking out across the valley of them dry bones he sees an army he sees an army that once flourished in battle for the lord he sees an army that was once vibrant and full of energy and spirit for the lord he sees an army that was once mighty and unified in the lord an army brothers and sisters that was capable of conquering every enemy that stood in its way this was a mighty people of god this mighty people of god and army brothers and sisters has now been turned into a pile of bony rubble a pile of bony rubble these bones that are now piled on top of each other's bones that have been bleached white by the baking of the sun the bones that echo the hollow sounds of death as they fall upon one another you know there's a certain sound that bones have it don't matter what kind of bone it is cow bone dog bone whatever if you've ever picked up one that's been dried and you drop it it's ear piercing hollow sound of death and these bones are now in this valley death is in this valley of the people that served god these were god's people did you ever think about that this was god's chosen people this was the vision of israel where they lay as bones are you with me tonight brother sisters what we need is an outpouring of the holy ghost like we have never had before we need god to open up the floodgates of heaven and let it rain down upon his people we can't afford to be dry in this time we can't afford to be sensitized in this time we're living in we need an outpouring of the holy ghost from here to there and i want to challenge you tonight if i don't challenge you i'm not doing my job so i'm going to challenge you tonight as i challenge myself and ask am i really as full of the holy ghost as i could be or as i should be am i really is full of the holy ghost do i take christ as serious as i should am i softened up enough in my flesh and in my spirit that i can be uh under the full capacity of what god wants me to be you see because many times i think we deceive ourselves into believing we're fully in god's will because we go to church we pay our tithes we pay our offerings we support missions we do all these things we do all these things but that's just being obedient that's just being obedient to what god has told us to do that has nothing to do with submitting yourselves to god's will on a daily basis and carrying out his works now say with me i'm not beating you too bad i'm not telling you you're not a christian i'm not saying that you're backslidden i'm not saying that you're not serving god i'm not saying any of those things at all but these bones that were in this valley were the servants of god we are the bride of jesus christ they were god's chosen we're god's chosen are you with me they knew all the ordinances of god we know we know the ordinance of god and still they find themselves dry in a defeated state of mind and used as an illustration of death so are we fully surrendered and alive tonight or do we find ourselves dry and stale not in myself but in him are we still you know i still read my bible i still pray i hope you're doing those things i come to church 52 times every a a week a year 52 times on sundays 52 times on wednesdays i hope you do if not maybe that's some of the problem oh maybe it's a lack of commitment maybe it's a lack of commitment that we found you know brother bowler he he was on this last week and he says what does it mean to be a christian and i thought about what everybody said myself included we talked about how god does stuff for us as individuals didn't we everybody that answered god does this for me god does that for me god watches it keeps me secure god keeps me safe god provides let me ask you what does a christian do what is a christian supposed to do in return you know the relationship with god is a reciprocating relationship you give and he gives you you know it goes back and forth both ways so what are we doing for god and you look and you think well we pray we study what's the next thing we should be fellowship fellowship coming together around the word of god coming together with brothers and sisters of light precious faith and spirit and truth and worshiping around the word of god we draw strength in numbers friends if this house was full you can't imagine what could happen it only takes two or three but what if we had the whole house was filled with licks of fire what if the whole house here was filled with people who were sincere and committed and dedicated to getting down and in front of god and saying god however you want to use me wherever you want me to go whatever you want me to say i'll do it what would happen in this church today fellowship what's the next thing we should do share i think i read somewhere it says go into all the world and preach the gospel share the word of god so if we're doing all of this if we're doing all this our life should be overflowing with god we should be so full of joy that it's uncontained joy i looked it up being a christian is having joy being a christian and joy go hand in hand and i'm going to show it to you through definitions you watch this these are uh synonyms they mean the same thing as joy joy means delight so as a christian did you delight in coming to the house of god tonight because every time the doors is open you'll be there and be ready to go you'll delight and come into the house of god are you in jubilation tonight are you in jubilation because of your freedom because of what god done for you on calvary you ought to be in jubilation because you are a free person triumph these words are all the same as joy try enough are you triumphant tonight because you've overcome through christ jesus rejoicing happiness gladness and here was one that i thought oh my goodness how have we not seen this before the same thing that means joy rapture rapture and then you thought rapture how does rapture mean joy well i looked up what rapture meant and it means a feeling of intense pleasure or joy what a feeling it will be when we rapture out this earth you're talking about a joyous time that's why david said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation we've got to have joy because joy gives us life joy that gets us alive you can live this the opposite you know i found out in life it's the choices you make you can choose to be joyous or you can choose to be miserable that's your choice but i get so disgusted when i see people who are miserable in their own skin they're miserable because of what somebody else said they're miserable because of what somebody else did they're in despair somebody done them wrong song they're constantly in a trial they're constantly in a tribulation maybe they're just in a dry condition tonight brothers and sisters nobody likes a dry person nobody likes the negative nelly and i studied and this was this you know it's funny how i think i think internet knows your knows your thoughts sometimes because as i was studying about negativity and positivity and we know the prophet said that every everything positive there's a negative everything negative there's a positive and as i was looking at that negative nelly nobody likes negative nearly this pops up and it says you may have seen it says hate has four letters so does love enemies has seven letters so does friends lying has five letters so does truth isn't that amazing negative has eight letters so does positive under has five so does above cry has three so does joy anger has five guess what so does happy right has five wrong has five hurt has four he'll has four the negatives and the what are you going to be are you going to be that christian everybody turns to and relies on are you going to be the christian that goes out and gets those that are lost are you going to be the christian that people can look and say that's a solid person right there are you going to be the one that says he ain't a christian look how miserable he is look how discouraged he is if that's the life of christ i don't want no part of it dryness is misery nobody likes dryness about november december january you crank the heat up in your house the atmosphere around you gets dry you touch something sparks fly off and the only thing you want to do is find you a thorn bush so that you can rub your back up and down until it bleeds because you're so itchy and dry and miserable dryness nobody likes dryness do you like dryness from your waiter when you go out and eat you sit down with your family and you're sitting down for an evening meal and you're just ex excited to have a little bit of time and you just want to enjoy the meal and the waiter comes up what do you want no i don't have pepsi you got coke what do you want you want to happen or not dryness you know we were dairy queen the other night boy i tell you customer service is terrible i work in customer service if i don't perform customer service i lose my accounts i've got the business that i've got for my boss because i provide customer service to these places we order he hands us one blizzard turned around hands us another one he knows four of us hands us another one another one and then just looks at us and joe i said well thank you he never said a word i wanted to throw that blizzard back at him i'll be honest i don't like drive nobody likes drive why can't you smile why can't you be joyous how many of you ladies like it when your husband comes home from work with a dry attitude and you say how was your day fine what'd you do nothing what would you like me to fix your supper i don't care how many likes that i don't see a lot of hands up dryness we don't like dry and these are some some examples i put in there that are the natural so what do you think god thinks about us in the spiritual when the preacher's up there preaching he's preaching his heart out and he's committed and dedicated and prayed and studied and then you're sitting out there like a knot on a log and you got your arms crossed and you're looking and you're counting the glitter on the ceiling what does god think about that what does god think about it when the word goes forth you can't muster up enough energy to say amen that's right brother steve you're not hurting me no no you're not hurting me you're not hurting brother you're hurting yourself you're hurting your relationship with god what about our worship why does worship keep coming up why does praise keep coming up because the bible says that everything that has breath we know it why don't we do it [Applause] i said oh i tell you what it's a good thing we don't ask the musicians what they see sister becky said that's right and i'm glad i sat there so that my eyes are in front and not behind me i get so frustrated why don't you praise the lord just sing like you're singing in the shower we got to have a little bit of emotion a little bit of emotion i don't know what time i started brother but this is not going near as fast as i thought it was we got to have a little bit of emotion in our life we have emotion with everything else and i'm as guilty as anybody we were at a ballgame basketball game and you hear the ball game story all the time and i think do i really act like that yeah i did my friend says he's the press announcer and he's sitting over talking to me before the game he said well i'm gonna go over here he said i can't step by you you get too wild i thought well i'll show him i got my chairs in that bench in the stadium i sat there and i watched the game i didn't say a word i watched the game and the referee made a bad call i'm watching the game and then he made a bad call against my son i said what are you talking about [Laughter] what is it it's the emotion that comes out god demands and requires emotion in his people brother brown said anything that is alive has emotion and anything that doesn't is dead he said excuse the expression but i think we ought to bury some of our emotionless religion because it's dead [Music] he said when that baby's born there's three elements that come he said it's water and if there's no water it's a dry birth and a baby's not normal second thing is blood and the next thing is life he said if that baby's born and he's still born and he doesn't cry if there's no emotion to him he's a dead born baby he said but and that's what's matter with the churches today that's 1962. 1962. and that's what's a matter with the churches today they have no emotion what's wrong with our pentecostals he said we're bringing forth dead born babies that's right he said what do you do with the baby if he's still born like that he said you take him by the heels you raise him up and you give him a little prostate posterior protoplasmic stimulation as hard as you can and he said that's what the church needs tonight a good old-fashioned gospel spanking with the power of the holy ghost we need more preachers to stand in the pulpit and tell you where the robber meets the road because we want to see you make it we want to see you get there we want to see you get there with joy and happiness and love not miserable christians so what are you doing with your life tonight are you filled with that holy ghost and is god living through you are you afraid to let go are you holding yourself back and just say i just can't do it brother and sister i want so much of god in me i want to be so filled with the holy spirit that every word that comes out of this mouth is his every thought that goes through this mind is his every dream that i dream is of his every movement that i make is his that's where i want to be whether preaching singing testifying witnessing whatever it is i want to be alive in christ and like i said as a minister of the gospel i want you alive in christ for the balor wants you alive in christ we want you to have that experience too many times i believe people sell themselves short on all the joys of living a fully surrendered life they sell themselves short on letting god lead them and guide them you know i i never want to be that christian that never gets involved in the movement of god you know if god says sing i want to sing if god says dance i want to dance and if god says speak in tongues i want to speak in tongues so let me ask you what happened to those things because my bible tells me that god never changes so where are they at it might be that we get so clammed up and so tight and so dry that we would be afraid of somebody spoke in tongues somebody might interpret and tell us what we need [Music] [Applause] well this might be my last time [Applause] god wants more from us than to just be spectators now let me ask you this one where's our converts where's the con the new converts in this church um well we might go to midnight where are the people that we've witnessed the gospel to man it's quiet as a church mouse like i said when i point at you there's three pointing back i'm guilty i'm guilty well brother what if i ask somebody to come and they get offended because we talk about the message we can make all the excuses we want excuses are a dime a dozen but you know what they get you nothing because i'm here to tell you in a dying a lost and dying world we're too spiritually dry to ask somebody to come to church we're too dry and dead on ourselves to look at somebody and say let me tell you what god has done do you have a home church and if you don't would you like to come with us how many times have you said that in the last year don't answer please you know 99 out of 100 they may look at you cross-eyed but what about that one that was just needed somebody to care enough to ask what about that one person that you think there's no way in the green earth of god that that person will ever be a christian but they didn't have a church they don't have no family they don't know anybody in the community and they just need somebody to say would you like to come to church with me you know you can tell them about christ all you want why don't you bring them with you invite them over to your house for dinner [Music] and let me tell you the message won't scare them off you know why because there's nothing in the message to be scared about if you know the message you can take them through the message you can take them through the bible and they can plainly see that it all lines up brother byler i was thanking maybe we need to get us some business cards evening light tabernacle pastor thomas pyler phone number and address some of you looking at me like i'm crazy business william business we're at church you know what uh the first recorded words out of jesus mouth was in the bible at age 12 you'll find in luke chapter 2 verse 49 and he said unto me unto them why do you seek me do you not know that i'm about my father's business brothers and sisters i've told you before i get embarrassed sometimes and i get ashamed when i'm some of my denominational preachers and friends they make me ashamed i shouldn't feel that way i shouldn't have to feel that way that tells me i'm not doing something i should be doing that i'm maybe not as close to god and as in tune with god as i think i am i'm gonna share this story with you i don't think i have here we were we had our ball team we was up in louisville or lexington i can't remember but we stopped at a cracker barrel and we stopped at a cracker barrel to eat dinner and the kids were all at one table and they were they were all having a big time and it was me and coach crawford he's my friend my baptist pastor friend and another guy's another coach sitting at the table there and a young lady comes up to us and pleasant smile just having to look like the best day of her life and that takes our drink order what would you like to drink so we tell her and you know when you're good friends with people you can tell sometimes when things are not right or they're uncomfortable well i can see daryl he kind of started rocking in his chair there's a certain thing he does he kind of just bounces back and forth i thought what's troubling him so we go on we go and she comes back out she comes out to take our order and we give her our order and when daryl really gets really nervous he starts kind of chewing right here in the car wherever sitting in the dugout you know when base is loaded two hours two through two strikes full you know he's he's like this right here he started doing that i thought the world is bothering him time goes on she comes back out she sets up our food around our table and she said is there anything else i can do for y'all and just smiles and he kicked back and he smiled at her and he's got a certain smile i'm going to tell you why he's a real man of god and he looks at her and he says ma'am we don't need nothing else this looks wonderful but we're fixing to pray for our food he said is there anything that's troubling you or on your heart that you would like for us to pray for you for you could have knocked me over with feather right there in the middle of cracker barrel she wells up with tears she said you know i moved here with my boyfriend she said we thought this was going to work she said it ain't worked out she said now i'm trying to save enough money to go to go home and i'm working two jobs and she said i'm just having a hard hard time she said will you just pray that i find my way back home brother and sister that is being in tune with god that is being so committed to the spirit of god that he sensed that on he sent something wasn't right on her something was bothering her something was troubling her her smiles couldn't hide it her pleasure couldn't hide it but he was in tune with a channel with god that god said ask her for prayer you see sometimes we have to get out of our comfort zone there we were joined hands with this young lady in the middle you know god's going to put you out there where everybody sees it you're not going to do it back in the corner okay he's not going to say come over here we're going to hide and pray no sir right there in the middle of cracker barrel we all join hands and we pray and she's crying people looking at us like we're crazier than bedbugs but you know what i didn't care it didn't matter at that point what did i care i didn't know those people they made they didn't mean nothing to me as far as what i felt how they felt about me didn't matter to me what mattered was that poor girl who was crying out in her heart for somebody to help me and he was in a channel to do it you know i've had people tell me they say it's easy for you you're a preacher god called you to be a preacher and it's easy for you you're comfortable in front of the people and they say i i can't get up there in front of people like you do there's no way i could testify in front of everybody there's no way i get so nervous i can't sing specials there's no way i could do that i tried it one time i've had somebody i tried it one time my voice cracked i was so nervous i couldn't get in tune with the piano it was a disaster i could never witness to anybody because i don't know what to say i get so nervous i just get so nervous that's why we need that outpouring that's why we need that outpouring let me tell you a day in the life of a preacher it's not easy it's not easy brother byler texts me on friday i said how does the 28th look can you take the service on the 28th i'm going to be honest with you because i believe honesty makes us grow i try to think of every excuse i could possibly think of to not take this service let's see i've got to i've got work i've got audits i got to do for work uh westin's just getting home i'm not gonna be here saturday so i'm not gonna be able to study uh what else can i tell him what else can i come up with what else can i do and this is what's going through my mind and while all this is going through my mind my stomach is quivering my nerves are beginning to flutter on me it's not easy and my nerves begin to quiver on me and i text him back the 28th is okay and i'm thinking in my mind how am i ever going to study for the service i've got to be gone wednesday to a meeting lord give me something today give me something now i need something i can put on paper oh what do you want me to tell the people well you know what sometimes if we would just get out of the way sometimes if we would just get in the channel that god is in we'll find out things are just where he wants them to be boss called yesterday he said brad no need you coming up here wednesday oh really yeah he said uh my son's not gonna be here we can't have the meeting there's no need in you coming just wait and come thursday you know what i did all day but let me tell you what i did on sunday coming to church i told joyce i said i can't preach wednesday i don't have time i'm going to tell brother butler he's going to do something different he's going to push me back a week you know what i did i got out of the car and i come right in here into this office from the outside he was nowhere to be found his truck was here i knew he was here nowhere to be found i was going to tell him you don't have to push me back i waited a few minutes nothing i come out here and sat down and it was just like something spoke and said why are you running why are you running joel said where did you get your service changed i said no i never even asked like i had something to do with it i never even asked getting in the channel letting god move in such a way that we're right where he wants us to be you know i'm going to tell you one of the most aggravating things i ever hear and it gets me every time i hear it i'll get the moma soap box tonight but people go to special meetings people go to camps and they come back and they say boy i wish we could have service like that why don't we why don't we their singers are no more talented than some we've got their preachers are not more no better than brother byler a lot of them is better than me but they're no better than brother byler we can have those kind of services but what are we doing to get into the service what are we doing to get into that channel with god we need the breath of god to breathe down across us and give us the life we need so that we can go forward with god you want to have good services choose to have a good service [Applause] the message i had on my mind was expectations but i saved it for another day this is just before the forerunner of it expectations you get in life what you expect you know weston just went to that camp three weeks that boy never stayed away from home for three hours hardly he's a homebody and that's okay he gets up there day one not good day two not so good he's ready to come home he's miserable yeah i wish this was over we're talking two days out of a 21 and i said son i said that camp is going to be what you make it so make it what you want it to be day five man he's got some friends now he even found a conservative buddy praise the lord day 21 we go back to get him we can't leave because he's got to tell everybody bye he turned the atmosphere into what he needed it to be for his joy let's look at our scripture for a few minutes and then we're going to get out of here i'm going to start at verse 2 there and cause me to pass about then round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live now we look here in ezekiel and this is time when the babylonians have completely laid waste to israel they have taken their people captive they've taken daniel they've taken the three hebrew children and they've laid ruined to the city of israel and destroyed their temple so restoration in ezekiel's eyes seems impossible at this time because they are under the foot of the most powerful empire to rule at this time in the world living in a city that they can see no possible renewal israel now these dry bones a dead nation full of absolutely no sign of life or recovery it's going to take a miracle this is going to take a miracle and god says ezekiel can these bones live brothers and sisters he wasn't asking for ezekiel's advice he didn't even want ezekiel's opinion but he was trying to make ezekiel think he was trying to get him to think what what do you mean can these bones live well how can i tie what where's god come over this how can he i'm not answering this question god i'm not answering because thou knowest you're the omnipotent god you're the all-knowing you know the answer before you ask the question so i'm not answering and he says prophesy he tells ezekiel preach preach you want to talk about an uncomfortable place to be in you think about ezekiel in this position he's sitting up on the pinnacle of a hill looking into a valley full of thousands and thousands of bones and he's supposed to preach i can't help but think that in my mind he had to have turned around and see who was watching this event preach to these bones and say unto them ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord unto the bones behold i will cause breath breath to enter into you and ye shall live we look at the word for breath there and it's the same word of breath that god used in the beginning in genesis 2 when he's creating adam and he's saying there and in genesis 2 god for man out of what dust dust is pretty dry dust is pretty dry you can't grow nothing in dust you can throw some seeds down in dust it's just going to lay there there's no life in dust and god created adam and man out of the dust of the earth and formed him there and i'm going to take you to what happened that day and i know it to be the truth you know how come i know because brother brown said i saw he said i see adam standing like a tree it's one of my all-time favorite quotes i saw adam standing like a tree god had made them he was dead as he could be dust and he said his toes were like the roots sticking into the ground and god breathed god breathed the breath of life into it and he jumped he said adam jumped that was the first thing he did he had an emotion you mean when god breathed the life into him he was emotional somebody but bruh stephen set him down he's jumping around because god has breathed life into him brother brown said he came to himself it was god's living breath to come into him and he came into himself and he said he became a living soul and he began to move on and move on and move on brothers and sisters adam came alive the spirit of god moved into him he became emotional he jumped and he was moving because he was about god's business so ezekiel he begins to preach ezekiel's preaching and he says there was a noise and every hole is shaking and bone came to bone the toe come to the foot the foot to the ankle the ankle to the leg the fingers to the hands the hands to the wrists the rest of the arms to the torso these bones are coming together and flesh and sinew are beginning to form in these dry bones the very marrow of these bones that were so hollow and full of death that had no life in them now the stem cells are in there the marrow contains the stem cells where life lives deep down inside these bones they begin to grow and they come together and the flesh comes over and it covered them and the bible says but there was no breath breath there was no breath in them can you imagine ezekiel standing there he said and he said unto me preach god's telling amen i like what i'm saying preach [Music] preach preaches equal preaching to the wind preach son of man reminding him again you descendant of adam you remember what i did for adam don't you you remember when he stood there with his toes in the ground like roots and i come out of the dust of the earth and i breathe upon him you remember what happened son of man preached to the wind sometimes brothers and sisters we need to be brought back to our remembrance you say i can't be a witness remember when you're as a sinner you say i can't sing remember when you were blessed by a song you say i i can't testify remember when he was encouraged by testimony i can't praise the lord i just can't i can't do it too many people around just remember that blood shed on calvary let me tell you something i need you to sing i need you to testify i need you to witness you know why because i draw strength from that i draw strength when i hear somebody testify the good things that god's done from them for them i begin to think man if god can do that for them what could he do for me when i hear a song and i see people so dedicated into the song and they get into it they they get a little emotional and i think man what a blessing that i went right through that this week i need that song [Applause] amen preach unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live you know what ezekiel did he said i preached i preached wind from the north wind from the south went from the east from the west come and move upon these people that they may have life i preached and as he commanded me and breath came into them and they lived and they stood on their feet like an exceeding great army those bones that were in the pews they got up those bones they couldn't sing they began to sing a new song those bones they couldn't witness they began to tell everybody what god had done for them those bones and couldn't give a testimony begin to tell how god healed their body those bones that were dead now were alive but that's not the end of the story the succeeding great army they're on the move for god and ezekiel is standing there and he's listening he's in amazement i can imagine he's in amazement wow what my god has done what my god has done and he said unto him son of man these bones are the whole house of israel now god had done a miraculous work in their life hadn't he he brought them back he put blood back in their bones he put vessels back in he gave them breath and they're living now but what was those bones doing listen it said this is the whole house of israel and they say these once bones that are now a mighty army they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost see they're no different than what we can be god does mighty works for us we get excited we get we get up on the on the cloud we're up on the mountain everything's going good and we feel like everything's going good but something happens and if we're not careful we say lord our bones are dry we said in the pews our bones are dry our hope is lost god couldn't settle for that god couldn't settle that he says ezekiel you tell them that the living don't dwell in the graves with the dead that i have breathed the breath of life upon them and i'm going to open the grave and i'm going to cause them to come out and i'm going to give them the land that is theirs the land of israel how god moves verse 14 and i shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and i shall place you in your own land then you shall know that i the lord have spoken and performed it saith the lord brothers sisters we need to find a place of surrender you know i googled fully fully surrendered to god i googled it sometimes google has more common sense than we do you know what it says question what does it mean to be fully surrendered to god and this is the answer word for word to surrender in spirituality and religions means that a believer completely gives up his own will and subjects his thoughts his ideas his deeds to the will and teaching of a higher power and in contrast with submission surrender is the willful acceptance and yielding to a dominating force and their will let me tell you you do anything for god it's going to take you out of your comfort zone you testify for god it's going to take you out of your comfort zone you're saying for god you're going to be nervous your voice is going to quiver but you know how you overcome that you exercise the gift you exercise gift if you don't exercise you don't use it you're going to lose it you exercise again it don't mean it's going to get easier the next time you're still going to get nervous let me tell you i paced that floor till i about where the carpet out tonight as i was studying today it makes my body so cold and i can't hardly stand it i touch the joist on her neck and she said yeah it's cold in his house saying that i said no it ain't cold in this house i'm nervous it don't get any easier but we must fully surrender to god get into a place that god can lead us and guide us and move us and take us where he wants us to do to go and say things he wants us to say can i share one thought one experience with you one testimony i've never shared this in my life with anybody maybe my wife i was preaching one time several years ago and i don't know i know what it was but i didn't at the time but i could feel on my shoulder a pressure and it was just like somebody had their arm laid across my shoulder and was pushing me and i would go this way and when he would turn i would go this way and i could keep feeling this pressure while i was preaching it was weird and you know i hardly ever deviate from my notes and i like my notes in front of me so i never go out into the crowd hardly and here i went no notes and began to preach and i could feel this pressure i kept feeling this pressure on my arm the service was over and in my opinion it wasn't nothing fantastic and i got done i thought man i felt so in tune that had to have been the hand of god leading me over here and leading me over over this way and taking me down into the people that had to be the hand of god and you know what happened satan said you're crazy he said you're crazy he said it wasn't the hand of god it's all in your imagination you just think it was and you know what i did i started to doubt i started to question well maybe it wasn't nothing maybe i just really felt good and it was just free tonight i don't know i thought i felt something i closed i went to the back closed up my bible put my notes up like i always do put my coat on walked outside walked up to where the people were standing and this little brother i'm going to call his name but he walked up to me and tears were streaming i'm talking excessively down his face and his lip was quivering in such a way i thought i said are you okay he said brother brad he said i don't know if you know it and i don't know if anybody else saw it he said but as you was walking through that crowd there was a ball of fire up on your shoulder he said i haven't seen that since the days of pentecost i don't know if it was more for him or more for me did i see the pillar of fire i didn't see it did i feel something i felt it and then i doubted because i let satan get in my mind but god sent him to me to confirm that god was on the move you love the lord tonight let's stand to our feet and i don't tell you that i said it's the first time i've ever told that story and i don't tell it for no other reason than this the glory of god because i'm nothing i don't consider myself a good preacher at all i just try my best to pray and consecrate myself before god and deliver what he'd have me to deliver and i just let him let him do the rest let's just bow our heads if we could heavenly father we thank you lord for this wonderful day for you taking the time to come and visit us tonight lord lord we thank you for your people that's made sacrifice to come out and to hear the word of god that was preached tonight and lord i trust with all my heart that if something was said to encourage and something to inspire to lead us in into a way that we could find such a fellowship with you such a glory divine such a a falling of the holy spirit in our lives as individuals lord that we would not only read our bible not only pray do those things that are obedient to you father but that we could also find fellowship with believers of light precious face that we could share the gospel as it's been shared to us lord if if i'd never heard about this where would i be today if nobody had ever taken the time to to invite me or my parents didn't take time to send me to church as a young boy you know that's becoming a thing of the past to take kids to church in the world and as each generation goes by lord we know that it gets harder and harder and people get further and further and further away and lord is that we know that the only light in this last day will be the light that we shine and reflect you upon the people lord so lord it's my desire and it's my heart's prayer tonight that we get so close to you father so in tune with you father that we can feel you lead us and guide us and that as we speak the thoughts come into our mind and we speak the very thoughts of god that we could be witnesses that we could be a living testimony that we can sing the praises and we can get over the the embarrassment or we can get over the the shyness or or the nervousness and be able to submit ourselves and to to do what you would have us to do so that we could be a blessing to the others around us as ezekiel looked out across that valley he seen nothing but death he was afraid to even answer you father but lord when you ask him can these bones live you knew the answer lord and no matter how dry we may get no matter how stale we may get up on the word and upon the movement of the spirit lord we know that if you'll just pour out your self if you'll open those floodgates of heaven and let your holy ghost rain down upon us father that we can get right back in tune with you we thank you for that lord we give you honor and praise and glory for tonight lord jesus and lord we ask that you would grant safe travels to the believers that's come out and plus those that couldn't be here no doubt their desire was to be father and circumstances made it impossible father so lord bless them we love you we appreciate you in christ's name amen can we sing jesus jesus jesus there's something about that name i just feel like if we could take just
