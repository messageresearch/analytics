[Music] [Music] morning brothers and sisters if we'll just stand this morning maybe brother John Wade will open us in prayer this morning e amen the children can be dismissed for Sunday School and if we'll go we're actually going to go in Ecclesiastes this morning Ecclesiastes 3 we're going to read uh 1 through 14 I believe here it's a familiar scripture Ecclesiastes 3 to everything there is a season a time to every purpose under the heaven time to kill and a time to heal time to break down and a time to build up time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing time to Rend and a time to sew time to keep silent and a time to speak what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he labor Heath made everything beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no men can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor it is the gift of God I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor any anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters just imagine if the whole world would just believe those simple 14 verses it would be a lot different place here this morning if you would turn with me to U uh Malachi the thir chapter you know I was thinking this morning with all the events of the last 72 hours not to be funny here but you know you're evolutionist and your person that believes in an old Earth you know it's awesome you can see what Mother Nature can do in a few short hours you know how he can change it can change the whole landscape but I was also thinking I was listening to that message this morning uh birth pains and brother brandham was really hitting this really hard two examples he was given in that message if at the end of it is the last 30 or 40 minutes of it that when he was preaching that message he was telling the people that God was trying to bring the church not the building but the people the church back to the original word back to where God had established his church to be in the original form but at the same time What struck me was saying that God now he doesn't have to bring make people do it if if people choose to disobey the word of God and not heed the word of God their very imaginations that possess rest their minds and their hearts every day of their life will make them be the opposite of what a Christian will be and I was just thinking he was saying how there's two things going on either that we're becoming the perfected Church of God through Jesus Christ and the world is getting in a position to be destroyed it's just one or the other you're going one way or the other and he was explaining that he was and in that message I was kind of funny was you know how long ago that was over 60 years ago and he was talking about the condition in California and condition in the country in 1960 and I don't even like talking about it anymore about the condition in 20124 going into October the condition of the world this morning so if you have any type of spiritual sense you know that we're coming to the end of this age and the and brother brownon was telling the people people in that message you're going to make a decision you're going to make a choice you either get back to the original or you're going to be consumed in what the world is consumed of this morning and it's a real hard thought to realize I know for I'm you know I'm 65 years old I know myself if you let your mind get idle and you don't keep it rooted in the word of God it'll take you places that you don't want to go this morning that's the only thing that'll keep you from be keep you in the straight path PA and in the straight way is the original word of God and the message of the hour and you'll find yourself whatever you dwell on the most you'll find your body and your spirit and everything about you wanting to conform to that the more you feed whatever that is the more you're going to become this morning and we don't want that to be the negative we want it to be the positive this morning I hope what I said makes sense if you would if we'd go to uh ma I was reading in Malachi this morning Al and God was talking to the priests and I'm I'm going to jump into Hebrews uh but starting in Malachi 3 excuse me Malachi 2 about I gave you the wrong Malachi 2 about the 4th verse and you shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you that my Covenant might be with Levi sayeth the Lord of host my Covenant was with him of life and peace and I gave it to the to them to him for the fear where he feared me and was afraid before my name the law of Truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in his lips he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn many away from their iniquities I when I read the scripture I try to apply it to myself in the day that we live in this morning for the priest lip should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the the messenger of the Lord of host and it's no different for the ministry for the hour that we live in their sole purpose is to eat and receive the word of God so they can give it to you this morning and he goes on this I lost my place for the priest lip should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts but ye have departed out of the way and you have caused many to stumble at the law and you have corrupted the Covenant of Levi sayeth the Lord host it's no different for us this morning the churches of the world have done the same thing that the priests did be in this day and age they've corrupted the word of God this morning and I'll just read therefore also I made you contemptible base before all people is according you have not kept my ways but have been partial in the law have you not all one father have not one God created us why do you deal treacherously and again we can see in our own day and age right now he goes out deal treacherously with every man against his brother by pering the Covenant of our fathers and you can say the same thing this morning with the New Testament they do the same thing this morning and Judah ha dealt treacherously and is an Abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem for J Judah has profaned the Holiness of the Lord which he loved and hath married her daughters of a strange God and the Lord will cut off this man that doeth this the master and the scholar out of the Tabernacles of Jacob and him that offereth not offerings unto the Lord of host and I was going to jump to Hebrews here this morning the eth chapter if I can find it here this morning but I was really thinking about what brother brandham had to say about in that message birth pains this morning how it's really important for us this morning to realize you're either and all the ministers that come through lately or are really hitting that you're either going to go one way or the other you're either going to get closer to Christ this morning or today or you're going to get further away and brother Brandon was talking about that was talking to the people at the end of that message and some of the quotes that were up there this morning are the same you're either going to get closer or you're going to get further apart it's it's it's a dividing time there people are going to know who you are and what you are you you can't walk the fence anymore it's a providing time they'll know in your lives the way you talk the way you act and react to any given situation what you are and who you are this morning and um I I was about to say something but I won't say it I say it a lot but I was just thinking and The Ghost and this eth chapter in Hebrews kind of deals with what God was dealing with the priest also and if I read this whole chapter you'll have to forgive me this morning uh it really speaks also of the day and age that we live in this morning now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such a high priest was set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty that is in heaven a minister of the sanctuary of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched not man so God built this Tabernacle not man for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifice wherefore it is necessity this man have somewhat also to offer we know what he offered he offered his very life and he goes on to say for we have and if for if we here were on the earth he should not be a priest saying that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve us an example and a shadow of heavenly things so they're talking about the Old Testament times and Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according in to the pattern showed thee in the mount and I'm thinking this morning it's no different for us this morning when you build a Church of God you have to build it by God's pattern this morning and we have that pattern this morning in the word of the hour that we all believe God gave us a pattern he gave us a cooker cutter for what we're supposed to follow this morning and he goes on to say but now he have obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator a better Covenant which was established upon a better promise for it was first a covenant have been faultless should be no place have been sought for the second for finding fault within he saith behold it the days come sayith the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah and that's where we're at this morning not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the in the day when I took them by the hand and led them by the land of e out of the land of Egypt because they continue not in my Covenant nor regarded them sayeth the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayeth the Lord and this is where we're at this morning and I hope everyone is at this place this morning I will put my laws into their mind and I will write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man for to his neighbor or every man to his neighbor saying no the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest that's where we're at this morning and for I will be merciful to the unrighteousness let me reread that correctly I will be merciful to the to their unrighteousness and their sins and our iniquities will I remember no more and that he saith a New Covenant he had made the first old now which is decayed and W old is ready to vanish away and that's where we're at this morning here we're under that New Covenant and I was just thinking of the circumstances you know you think of not too far away from here there's millions of people suffering this morning you know so my hope is for them that God will touch their lives and it won't be too long when you when I saw the stuff that I saw this morning or the last couple of days and I realize we are human beings you know sometimes you we think of more of ourselves than we really are life is a fragile thing this morning and we hold on to it by a prayer and a hope that we'll be there on that day and I would just hope that God will bless those people over there that they'll have a speedy recovery from this situation this morning and we have empathy and concern for them brother Josh and we just have one announcement this morning before we start singing Sister Joyce asked that we would just a reminder for the Fall Festival next Saturday 10 or October 5th uh ski shoot starts at 10:30 a.m. and lunch will be served at 12:30 followed by games for everyone

convey something that I feel I've had on my heart amen there uh yesterday I was just um kind of thinking and and what the Lord wanted me to speak on and there's about two weeks I guess I've had this on my heart amen and so I think we'll just try to preach it this morning amen and so amen I trust it'll be a blessing to you it's a couple of my favorite favorite stories amen of brother brandom's and then uh that I want to that I want to speak on and um so if you will stand with me let's just go before the Lord in prayer kind Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord Jesus to have this moment this

together Lord and to worship you we want to thank you for that Lord sometimes we take that for granted realizing Lord Jesus that may be coming to an end one of these days and we just want to thank thank you Father for being able to take a day out of the week Sunday to get together and and to worship you in spirit and in truth to close down our jobs our work and get away from all of that Lord and to pray before we come and ask you to come in a special way and receive our thanks and gratitude for all that you are and what you mean to us to gather together and then to sing songs father from

Lord and we ask God that you'll come and do the ministering this morning Father for we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen so I don't really know uh just right off hand I guess but I would call this one of the uh an appreciation and a gratitude for who God is in our life type of message amen amen and so I mean there's lots of different types of messages that do do different things but this is certainly amen something that'll bring honor and glory to his name and something that we worship him for amen and I've spoken on this many a times but I feel led to speak on it again amen and so um amen because we know that in times like these you need a savior amen amen how many believes that in time of likees these you need an anchor amen in times like these we need Jesus more than ever before as brother Brian was saying when you look around it's just uh hardly hardly words words uh how do you really uh express it in words the disappointment and the uh of of the conditions of the world how do you describe that amen other than Total Insanity isn't that right am amen so we're going to try to express it in a little bit here uh if we can in by the grace of God Amen so if you will let's start amen let's just start somewhere here amen maybe we'll go with uh Hebrews I guess Hebrews 12 maybe Hebrews 12 amen I don't know about you but I sure enjoy having our Wednesdays and our Sundays to come together and wor the Lord don't you is it nice just to come and sit one among another and amen and feel that sweet presence of the spirit amen and amen and just to have this moment this time that we have with God Amen I certainly enjoy it amen and so I just pray that the message this morning will be a blessing we do want to remember before I read now amen that sister Marjorie has been diagnosed with cancer this little pain that was in her stomach and could not get rid of it could not get rid of it amen and so finally did he a test and found out that it was cancerous and of course as you have been updated we know that they had to do a CAT scan to see whether amen it had spread to other places because if it had spread to other places amen they could not have had an operation they would not have had operation but they would had to go to radiation and other kinds of treatments and she had told me yesterday that she just don't know if she would have went that route so our sister was under great anticipation Amen to find out to hear the news basically that would have been between life and death for her amen so when they came back and said after the CAT scan that it was not spread everywhere but the doctor said that he thought he could go into there and perhaps cut it all out so amen that is a much much much better story amen so amen we'll pray that tomorrow at 2 o'cl I think it is they're going to open her up and try to get that out of there amen and also or gallbladder I believe it is amen they're going to do that also while they're in there and so we're hoping that she'll have a better quality of life when she comes out of there amen and enjoy the rest of her days amen and get rid of that so we just REM want to remember her in prayer amen beginning today and also especially way tomorrow that the Physicians would just amen be led by the Holy Spirit by God amen amen to do and to get it all with the grace of by the grace of God all right Hebrews Hebrews um the 12th chapter Hebrews 12 and also chapter 6 we'll read chapter 12 first let's just go down to verse 25 seeing that ye refu see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall we not Escape not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also the heavens and this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things that are shaken as of those things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain therefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved amen or shaken ain't that right how many is glad to be tapped into this that Kingdom amen let us have Grace whereby we may God serve God acceptably with reverence in Godly fear amen turn a few Pages back to chapter six of Hebrews if you will 6 and 18 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us which hope we has that have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast which enters into that within the ve Veil may God add His blessings to the reading of the word amen tonight this morning I want to title this Fearless Fearless confidence Fearless confidence amen and really we're speaking on an anchor amen we're really speaking on an anchor because we realize that we're living in very very troubled and shaking times amen and I think what lays ahead amen what lays ahead of us amen is going to be shaking it's going to be a very shaky time ain't that right amen but we're thankful that we've tapped into something that does not shake it does not move it's steadfast unmovable amen praise the Lord amen I like that don't you something that unmovable something that's solid that doesn't shift with times that doesn't shift like the kingdoms of the world do how many knows that we're living in the time that everything that can be shaken will be shaken and not only does it say that but it says that anything that can be shaken is going to be removed amen the moving of those things that can be shaken shaken amen how many knows that in our lives many times we get shaken things Shake us up S rattle us a that right but you know I want to take Paul for just a few minutes if I could amen Paul said in Acts 20 I believe it was Acts 20 in verse 22 he says Now Behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing that the things that shall befall me there say that the holy spirit because he would lot of time people would prophesy in the churches and so forth and tell him of these things save that the Holy Spirit Witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me wow imagine having the Holy Spirit speak through people and prophesy that afflictions and trials and how bad things is coming upon you if anything would shake you it would shake you wouldn't it amen but what does Paul say he says but none of those things move [Laughter] me w why I'll tell you why because how many knows God I mean brother Paul had an experience when he was going to persecute the Christians on the road to Damascus he had a real experience an experience with God this will be a little bit tar to young people this morning amen because we know that if you're ever going to have an anchor you've got to have an anchor anchor on this ocean of life that we're floating down on this sea of life or on this River of Life so to speak you got to have an anchor you got to have something solid something unmovable you can't rely on your mom and dad you can't rely on Thomas berer you can't rely on a church or even like that but you can't rely on preachers you've got to have something deeper than that and Paul had that he had something that he was anchored to and what was that it was where Jesus asked the disciples who do the son of say who do you say the son of man am and Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said now you didn't learn this from Seminary you didn't get this from a preacher but my Father which is in heaven revealed this to you what was it a revelation now from what I understand brother Bram said the rock wasn't Jesus The Rock wasn't the Catholic Church hello The Rock wasn't Peter The Rock upon which the church is built is the revelation of Jesus Christ that is The Rock when God personally reveals something to you just like he did Moses isn't that right oh Moses didn't have a revelation and slew the Egyptian and so forth no no more are you going to persecute my people and so forth and it didn't go nowhere that was in his flesh but it was a different story on the back side of the desert when God called him up there and had a talk with him wo folks I'm here to tell you how many knows I'll tell you what if God ever talks to you if you ever hear his voice my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow every person has to have that if they're ever going to get out of this backsliding this floating this moving this everchanging world that we live in amen we understand the pope is making some new laws taking some of God's laws out and putting his own laws in amen one of these days you know he said he he made a rule that but if it's a sin to be poor a sin to be poor what's he want to do kill all the poor people too huh he killed all the Christians and he's going to pick out who he wants all those are against the climate and everything else it sounded to me like he was pushing the green New Deal hello to transgress against the climate and all of these other things you know a a and think about it how many knows if you've seen that video of it all the Muslims and all all the world they had a great big gathering together they had a great big screen up there with the Pope up there and all of that hello and I thought you know it ain't no wonder that all of those people will join in with the Pope they're deceived already so it isn't going to matter that much more cuz if you ain't following Jesus you're deceived amen but we're living in that kind of a world we're living in a you can't have confidence in the United States and our constitution how many knows it's crumbled not is crumbling but it has already completely crumbled amen that's right so there's no confidence we can't have confidence or set your anchor on the country that we live in we know that all kingdoms of all the world have all Fallen ain't that right Nebuchadnezzar the head of God the great country it fell the next one after that Greece fell Rome fell hello all of those fall and the only one that has survived would be the Roman Catholic church for the last 2,000 years and you can't have no confidence in them they're going to change something and make a difference it's always shifting but it's the Antichrist hello oh my think about it listen how many knows that it won't is that a big deal for the Pentecostal to apst and all of them to join the pope even when brother Brandon was here he was telling trying to tell him to stay away from that and he's saying you know it' be nice if we kind of fellowship with them ain't that right that's what the denomination churches were saying but says but we hear the Holy Spirit saying get away from that thing amen woo that's right so even then they were kind of leaning that way it ain't no wonder if they join it but for you and I amen want no part of that we want something that doesn't change and the Bible says that there's one thing that's immutable amen and that is that God cannot lie amen the Pope's word they'll change they'll fall they'll fail but Jesus said amen the words that I speak to you he says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away I don't care what pope tries to change or what man tries to change it his word will forever be true it'll never change that's why my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness amen our anchor is in the word of God sure [Applause] steadfast I might as well say what comes to my brain right now if you can be shaken you will be shaken and anything that can be shaken the Bible says it signifies the removing of those things that can be shaken amen amen how many knows Russia shaken North Korea shaken America shaken Israel shaken amen think about it remember the other week and I'll just bring this back it come to my mind so I might as well speak it remember I talked the other Wednesday about he says you know pretty much this already been fulfilled with this woman about being a vice president like the prophet of God said amen and destroying the country amen and the next thing is for a fire to fall do you not know that Putin man there he is threatening NATO to obliterate NATO he hates NATO NATO hates him and I was listening to him he says you know if America goes in there and gives a Ukraine uh Rockets to send us and then we get blowed by it we're fixing to blow you up it's an act of aggression by America for supporting them because if you are before he ever started he warned Every Nation don't you take partake of this huh do they care so what I'm trying to say is look at where we're at look at uh uh uh uh uh net Yahoo and listen to his speech to the UN blasting them he says you know they have absolutely condemned us more than they have all other countries put together and all somebody has to say something a little about we're Killian civilians and it don't take no time and the majority of the UN votes against them he says this and un he says it's nothing but an an anetic swamp he really told them exactly what they were he blasted them the kingdom come that's right yes sir so you can't have no confidence in that they actually un I'll tell you this right now the UN sides with terrorists what does that make the UN terrorists they are terrorists sorry but you side with a terrorist you're a terrorist you curse Israel you'll be cursed netan was pretty right about that wasn't you there's a blessing and a curse in front of you I was waiting for him to say he that blesses Israel will be blessed he that curses Israel will find themselves get blowed up like the leader of the terrorist group did ain't that right and not only that think about it it's not maybe we're talking about Nations coming against them that they that they're fighting a seven War front right now now seven different enemies that they having to fight amen this thing's getting come to a boil so to speak it's getting ripe amen why because heaven and earth amen all these kingdoms we're living during the time we're living at the time when all of these kingdoms are going to get ground to powder by the rock that is sh out of the mountains that rock that you're anchor to that rock that I'm anchored to amen that none of these things oh my can't move you amen praise the Lord you love him young people listen to me like I said earlier thank God if you have Godly Parents I've got written in my notes teenagers nowadays they pretty much don't have a chance those kids out there in the schools and all that their parents they just think about themselves they don't take their kids to to uh Church hardly think of how they do they don't live right before them they're selfish they're not godly how are them kids ever going to turn out right that's why it's barely a chance so if you have Godly Parents you're sitting in church you're in a good spot why because you have a chance Amen Let me see who's the oldest here how old are you 16 17 18 1920 I was four years older than you when I got one this an came and grabbed me amen 40 20 years old 20 years old that was about 40 years something ago a little over 40 years ago so think about it don't you want something that holds you for your whole life no matter what comes no matter what goes give you joy unspeakable happiness and joy your financial status you ain't got to worry about the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you but what does it take it takes amen something down on the inside of your heart saying I want that anchor I want to get Anchored In Christ I want God to bring in anger I thought about it this way it's almost like Christ came and he hooked into my heart and no matter how much I pull amen that Anchor Holds that's right that anchor it holds that's right that's worthy of a holler that's worthy of a praise Amen to be able to testify amen you've seen highs and you've seen Lo you've went through so to speak hell and high waters amen but yet that anchor it holds you it will not let you go Glory Hallelujah and that's what I come to do I don't know about what you came to do but I came to praise the Lord and I don't mean just a little well praise the Lord I mean praise be to God I've got an anchor that holds Glory you can have that anchor how how do you get it by acts 238 repent of all your sins amen give God a wheel of your life let him do the driving repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and the ankle will come it'll grip you and it I'll never let you go I gave God the steering wheel when I was 20 and there's been a many of time that I grabbed that steering wheel and said oh let's go this way let's go this way if you're a Christian you've done the same that's right your flesh pulls you this way and the flesh pulls you that way your flesh messes up this way and that way and amen you want to go this way but what guess what I'm glad amen that he's at the wheel minute he pushes me over and said let go of this will I got this Hallelujah he puts your put back in your place and he does the driving let God drive your car let God drive this machine of yours you'll find out that it's an awesome ride when he's driving amen you can't put confidence in this flesh you can't put confidence and riches this flesh will take you the wrong way but let him get the wheel let him drive it you're counting on being young strong huh healthy yeah don't count on it so much it's not an anchor it's not sure you're head it for a fall Called Death weakness many trips to the hospital until it's your last one hello there's no don't have no confidence in youth don't have no confidence in health all of that vanishes and that right it perishes amen so you better go further than your flesh better go further than your natural things better go further than finances you better get a hold of something that is a whole lot deeper than that something down that anchors within the veil amen why you and I son and daughter God we have fled for Refuge to get a hold of anchor that all times all trying times nothing will move you oh God help us brother Brandon love brother arm leville he says you know one thing about him he's always the same you don't find him up and down and in and out he was Solid Rock he was like a rock and he wouldn't move God help everyone of us sometimes we are up we're down help us not to be that way but be the same God gives you stability all of those teenage thoughts questions doubts fears all can go by the wayside amen if a heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards God Amen aren't you glad that you can have confidence it gives you a confidence God gives you a confidence this anchor gives you a confidence not an unsur amen you're not tossed about praise the Lord okay you love him that's right brother bam says now there's so many people that doesn't have seem to have any kind of purpose in life especially in the day that we're now living people just think that all they have to do is keep up with somebody else with the Fashions of the world with the enchant enticements of the world that has been given he says like if you go to school and some girl wears something they're dressed and you think you got to do that someon women on television this that or the other just trying to keep up with something brother saying you know there's more to life than that to keep up with the Fashions to keep up with this that or the other let me say this those things may be all right right but they're higher Ambitions in the human life than those things a Christian should set their affections on higher Ambitions what is your ambition this morning amen my ambition is to see Jesus in person my ambition is to take a body change my ambition is to be so much like Christ your people amen don't see Thomas berer anymore they see Jesus Christ that's my ambition High ambition amen my that's right such I think that it would pay us all to sit down and wonder why we are here in the first place and never who was kind enough to bring us here we ought to consider and ask him what he would have us to do how many believes that's a good question who s us here what are we here for he says another place I I'm going to say this real quick see you were pre-planned by God nothing happens with Chance by God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that just think you at one time was in your father the gene of your father you didn't know him at that time neither did you know him he know you but see through the beding ground of the womb of your mother holy whatlock holy wet loock then you become a person expressed in the image here amen so what he says God knew and he actually orchestrated way back Generations your father's father father amen these two would come together amen this Union would take place this marriage would come down to you Mom and Dad they would for some strange reason fall in love because God saw you coming how many believes that you were here you are here pre-planned God and God has a purpose for you God has a purpose for every one of us and it's important that we find what that purpose is oh when we were worshiping in the harmony of the spirit this morning and singing those songs amen I thought this is what we were built for this is what we were made for it feels so good to do what God made you to do to find what the purpose of God is in your life what a great place to live W that's right he made me to holler for him baseball fiends football fiends rip their shirt off yeah yeah yeah they were made for that perhaps you and I were made to Worship the Lord we were made to serve God we were made to give honor and glory to him I believe it's time to worship like you never worshiped him before praise him like you never praised him before thank him like you never thanked him before amen they worshiped him and gave him thanks I'm thankful this morning aren't you that's what we're here to do be thankful for that anchor amen praise the Lord amen two stories listen to this brother Bram called about talked about a what he called like the stream of life you take a stream of life he says there's plenty of Driftwood hanging up in every trash pile and yet the boat comes along and it's made out of the same stuff but you know that notice the wood is made and shaped out by the master who has built the boat amen and not only has it been shaped out but it's Guided by a master it's been pushed by a power let me stop cuz way too fast first of all how many knows every one of us is on the stream of life that's right we're on the stream of Life a River of Life maybe say as you might say in other place you know it's like you might be on that Great River or that great water of the Niagara Falls hello amen but you know what's down at the end down at the end the stream there's a fall there's a Falls amen what did Brother Bram said what a horrible thing it is for a soul drifting on the sea of life no pilot to guide him not no anchor just floating loose with the tide to hear that judgment is coming that death is coming the fall is coming amen like I said earlier get diagnosed with something one of these times a lot of time we get out of it sister Margery we pray she gets out of it brother Bram says a lot of times death will come and corner you that right you're waiting for that doctor to tell you if you're going to live or die it's got you cornered but gu brother R say but you'll Escape you'll get out of it praise the Lord that's what we're believing for ain't that right but he said one of these days one of these days it'll corner you and you won't get out all of these things of the world isn't going to meet mean me mean a whole lot amen you might do a lot of things that you think you can get by with but you come down to the door of death I guarantee you you'll be making confession that you would have never made outside of the door death the reason you never made them is because you just didn't have enough in you but when you realize you're ped for the fall you realize hey this doesn't look so bad after all let me make this right how many believ we ought to have that kind of conscience say Lord I want to be right with you now not wait till I get to there because we want to have the confidence amen not fear Fearless confidence like FF Bosworth when he come there brother Brandon ask him what is your greatest time what great Revival was it what healing took place he said brother brand the greatest time of my life is right now amen this is where I'm going home this is what I've longed for it was Fearless confidence amen why because he was anchored when you're really anchored you could have Fearless confidence brother Brandon when he went into that field amen and a big bull rose up my he was looking for his gun in his flesh he was fearing perhaps a little bit scared I'm going to man I'm not going to die what's going to happen but he prayed Lord if this is how you would have me to go and what happened that Holy Spirit love two things a revelation is a rock faith is is a revelation the other thing that's a rock and that anchors you is love there is no fear in love amen he said that love come down over him and he said I wasn't scared one bit anymore no fear perfect confidence amen and God just spoke through him ain't that right amen and he told that bull G to go back isn't that the kind of life that we desire to have God help me to live the kind of life that I can speak to those giant fears that come in My Life Unexpected that rise up and be able to say God I do not fear I've Got Confidence that you will take care of this big ball you will take care of this Beast you will take care of this animal it's under your power give me that Fearless confidence and it's because of the love of God that he sheded brought in our hearts that's why Paul he could preach that amen none of the things but these things do none of these things move me amen oh my Lord help us when he came to death he says oh death where is your your sting great Fearless speaking oh gra where is your Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord amen even when Paul faced death it didn't matter he had no fear many others amen but let's go back to life let's come back to life now but even in death you can have Fearless confidence Lord help each one in here to have that if you call get called before the Rapture let us have Fearless confidence God and it become and it comes because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts that woman that ran into the fire for her baby she was Fearless amen don't matter how much of the skin was peeling off from the heat she's going to have her baby because of the love of God Amen three Hebrew children three Hebrew children that right they love God and they didn't care if they were going to get thrown in the fire they they love God brother Bram said whenever he said when he cares do you care and then that statement he says you got to care first because he's already cared now he's waiting for you to care and when you care he says then he'll care if those those three Hebrew children cared enough to make a statement for God don't know if you will but we're not going to Bow anyway say God said oh let me go through the fire I don't care about what fired it I'm coming to rescue my boys when you love God like that when you get in situations like that amen if you love God the way that you said you remember this God is coming on to see he's got to love you because you love him that's why I said Paul said in Romans eight what shall separate it from the love God tribulation distress and all these things no he said nothing why because you're anchored in the love of God but if it's just because your mom and daddy go to church that's not kind going to cut it just because they have a relationship and understand the prophet of God and who God is and have a relationship with Jesus Christ not good enough for you you got to have your own personal relationship with Jesus if God hasn't revealed that to you you pray for Revelation more than anything else in the world that God will come down and do something for you amen why do you think a lot of times we repeat ourselves and our testimony of what God did for us amen because that's when that took place that anchoring took place that anchoring we don't know where we don't know how but somewhere somehow when God does something for you you always remember that time amen I love that song I can take you to the time and I can take you to the place where the Lord Saved Me by his Wonderful Grace [Applause] amen I can hear myself way over 10,000 Years brother Brad down in the wood somewhere amen it was amazing grace How Sweet the Sound I'll hear brother Brandon way amen he'll be singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved the wret like me I once was lost I was drifting on the sea of life I was getting hung up in every trash pile every sin pile every kind of message he was in amen but I'm here to tell you God took that trash pile and he grabbed that great big old log and he put me out of the trash pile and he begin to work on me and he begin to cut me here and cut me there and mold me into a ship he can drive he can push he can power he Powers us he molds us he shapes us that's what he's doing today that's what he's doing this morning to us he's shaping you for a Rapture he's shaping me for a Rapture amen God has control of this boat I'm the boat brother Brad but who's the motor he's the motor he's the power he's the power we might be the Cadillac but he's the spark he's the power in that car and I'm here to tell you you ain't buy but a p ofu if you ain't got the power if you ain't got the spark isn't that the truth all know the story of Henry and the boss and amen went to his boss and his boss said you wasn't down there with them bunch of nuts was you ah sure was praise God for the nuts what do you mean praise God for the nuts because if it wasn't for the nuts the whole thing would fall apart how many knows that's exactly ly right when you and I leave when the nuts leave amen this place is going to fall apart you're the only thing we're the only thing that is holding this thing together we're the only thing that is holding Russia from pushing the button you want to know what holds it you do you being here is what keeps them from blowing us up that's why I said whether Harris gets in or not you better have your eyes ready you better be ready could already be fulfilled man we could see our loved ones at any time it isn't always just the way we think I'm glad that I think that way Brother John because so many people oh it's got to be this way and this way and this way or it ain't it you're going to miss it sherish the world because brother Bram says it ain't going to be like you thought amen I like that praise the Lord that wood is shaped out by the master who has built the boat Oh Brother Brad you're made a certain way is that right your personality your character certain way brother Tommy you're shaped over the top I guess kind of a shape we got that Saturday over the top I mean just yeah you know then you got brother John here have you seen him over the top not really he's just an ordinary guy visits with you after calm right calm and quiet that's right brother John a certain way brother tro a certain way Brother lyrics certain way we're all built a certain way we got to be careful we got to be careful that because of that difference we don't dislike each other well I just don't like that person I just don't you be careful amen God built that person that way amen I've many times known that brother Bram said the Pastor is built a certain way for that group I wish I had a PhD and an lld maybe or a college degree like some folks I feel bad at eighth grade education preacher preaching to people who's got college degrees and you know uh uh nursing degrees and brother Brad's get be very smart intelligent and I feel humbled you know but yet guess what God built me a certain way ain't that [Applause] right sorry I can't go back to eth grade and pick it up oh my can I make a personal confession all right I'm going open myself up here I decided I I decided one day I was going to get me a GD GD you know I'm going to give me a GD right wow did that ever go bad oh my I was page one or two I say nope I'm done I don't even know what this is what in the world am I ever going to do with all this other oh my Lord help us all right that was personal so anyway you love the Lord but I know one thing if I can just yield myself to the Lord let him operate amen nothing Well wrong with having an education but that doesn't do anything for you for in the spirit realm amen only as we yield ourselves to for God to use us and to power us are we worth anything praise the Lord so listen to this let me make another Point here I really like then I want to go Amen to another one but listen so he says here that's right who has built the boat not only is it shaped out but it's Guided by the master how manyan know all of these kingdoms they can't never run them can they they always fall look at America didn't our forefathers say if it was ever run by anybody but Christians it wouldn't work well here we are it it ain't going to work why because they want to if the Supreme Court Justices say a certain thing they want to get rid of them justices that shows how obsurd they are how far it's gone amen they can't run it but listen to what it says it's guided Guided by a master and if theya countries like nebuchad Lazar how many knows he was the head of gold he had prospered above everybody he was the greatest but you know why he couldn't run it he didn't have the Holy Ghost and what happened Pride came in Pride came in he says all the things have I done God says no no no no no no no no no you wouldn't be there didn't evenes Jesus say to pilate he says if wasn't for my father giving you the power you'd have no power he put him in his place you'd have no power you wouldn't have at anything if God didn't give it to you amen but Pride come in and there it went how many know say Christian or anybody let Pride come in pride comes before a downfall that's exactly right and how many knows I mean listen young people you God never never meant for you to run your own life no sir sir the world all of these people me had all of these armies like Rome almost taking over the whole world so powerful but yet they fell they couldn't run it let me tell you that that's the way with this world right here that's the way it is with this Kingdom right here God never meant for you to run it listen to what he says God wants to mold us and to make us what he wants us to be but how can he do it how can God do it when we won't even hold still for him to do it we want to be our own Master Hitler wanted to be his own Master how did that work out didn't work out didn't it we want to be our own Master we want to our own way of thinking how many believes that you've got to die to your carnal thinking I'm going to say this as a Christian as a mature Christian if you aren't careful and you allow a little bitterness or a little something come into your heart you'll begin to think thoughts that you shouldn't even be thinking and those thoughts will torment you and they'll make you miserable if they let me let me give you an experienced veteran idea and that is that if you do that get on your knees quick get on your knees say God I don't know why I'm tormented I don't know why I feel this way but I shouldn't be this way I shouldn't feel that way take it from me Lord let God come back into your mind amen and many times those things come because of Gossip hello that's why it's poison assets poison Assets in the church when people gossip because that's that's the Slava oh my that's the poison acids that come from hell I call it the devil spit the devil's Slava is what a gossip is I don't want that stuff in my mouth amen thank god brother Brad I ain't heard nothing of that mess in this church for quite a some time let's give the Lord a hand say thank you Jesus we don't want on that poison mess it hurts the people oh man let me go ahead and preach just as a mom and a dad that don't live for God Amen it's hard for them children amen a mom and a dad fighting it's not good for them children when Church fusses and ston amen it hurts the kids it hurts their confidence and they go out into the world because of carnality in the church but when you've got peace you've got joy got people clapping you got people happy you got the holy ghost in the church not driven far brother say those things oh man why am I on this again all right Lord huh it'll drive the holy ghost from the Tabernacle it'll hurt your pastor and all these things that's right it'll drive him from the church I here to tell you it'll drive him from your heart think the right thoughts say the right things amen keep him from you praise be to God oh I like that don't you Guided by the master guided what would we do without the guide on the sea of Life can you imagine a ship wanting to cross the ocean but didn't know how to to be guided by the Stars knew nothing about the Stars had no Compass had no way where do you reckon they'd end up I dare say dead dead because they'd go out in circles and that that's a great big ocean they'd probably run out of food out of the grace of God some waves throwing them up against the the land would be the only Grace they would have is luck hello I'm glad that that we ain't got to oh boy here we go I'm glad that we aren't just lucky why because our schools and everybody says hey we just come here by chance we're just lucky to be here no we're not here by luck we're here by divine order I stand Here by divine order amen you sit in your seat go ahead and sit a little hard and say I sit here by divine order I'm here because God brought me here and I know the purpose that God has brought me here for amen and that is to be a reflection of him in my community a blessing to you my brother and my sister amen amen The Anchor Holds though the ship is battered The Anchor Holds though the sails get torn amen praise the Lord The Anchor Holds in spite of the storm doesn't matter how much a storm it is The Anchor Holds amen but people don't even stand still long enough for him to mold you and to make you amen I like people that are solid don't you that are like a rock and I was going to preach this message this morning and we were running about five minutes late I told my wife I don't think I'm gonna make prayer meeting I don't think I'm gonna make prayer meeting brother Steve them are probably GNA pray without me I really hate that I hate being five minutes late I like to be on time don't you like for people to be on time you know be reliable amen be solid be unmovable not wishy-washy so just that little thing might me think you know amen yeah I was thinking amen you love the Lord amen One More Story can I st tell you the story brother brandham of course you know this one he came by a harbor one time flying in a plane coming down low great big old ship there was on the ocean had to be let down and know what a storm it was on the sea how many believes it's going to be some storm in front of us brother Troy we don't know how bad it'll get but it's going to be a storm the devil has put out a wave a wave wave of sin brother bam called it watch that wave of sin come now try to consume you amen trying to knock you up into a trash pile that right praise the Lord now I'm GNA come back because a thought comes back from the other scripture trying to throw you off this Great Wave that's coming listen if this certain little craft that's been made different and been crafted out by the Master's Hand if it would ever stick into some of the weeds along those shallow Waters he says there's a power behind it and a little boat that that Master can turn on and push it out into deep Waters again amen how many has ever been maybe pushed up into that PR B but aren't you glad for the grace of God Amen that gives you the power to get on your knees and push you back out of that wave get you unstuck the holy spirit amen is in the unsticking business he's in the forgiving business amen praise the Lord hallelujah that's right waves coming in oh she was tossing and I seen that ship rocking back forth some waves that would go in it some go under and everything over it and I said wonder what that is and the fellow sitting said it's got a sea anchor on it therefore said that ship cannot sink he said he said it can go through the water Waters but it can't sink because it's anchored I said oh praise be to God somebody say it with me oh praise be to God that's right oh praise be to God we got an anchor say it with me we got an anchor some waves can go over some can go under but regardless it's anchored and it isn't the ship doing the holding Lor it wasn't you no if anything you let go I let go but it don't let go W how many glad for that doesn't that do something for you to know that God's got a hold of you he has begun a good work in you and he will perform it we can have Fearless confidence of the future because he is in the ship because we're anchored to him amen I like that it isn't the ship holding it's the anchor doing the holding it isn't what I am or what I will be it's what he is amen and what he did for me it's not what I can do it's what he's done my faith isn't Anchored In what the coming meetings will be or my faith doesn't rest in the ability that I have or upon the church that I join or the people that I associate with my faith anchors and rest entirely on the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ amen when an eagle makes its nest it takes it away from all of the things of the world and goes way up into the Rocks way up high and it finds a Clift in that rock and it goes into that Cliff of that Rock Amen and it builds its nest and it brings its young up there amen for safety and for a security how many's glad for the Cliff of Jesus Christ our anchor holes we're safe in the cleft of Jesus Christ we're trusting in what God has done in the Clift my anchor oh Hallelujah in the cleft of the Rock Amen and coverthe there with his hand Amen brother Joshua sang that song and that I pretty much started out with that song and I wrote I like that song Amen and covers me there with his hand and covers me there in this Leia Church age with his hand Mercy said no I'm not going to let you go I'm not GNA let you slip away amen a quick last thought and that is our anchor is in our genetics our anchor is in our genetics now I'm talking about spiritual genetics what did Brother Braham said if you ever have life if you have eternal life you had to be a seed Gene of God a seed Gene of God if you aren't a seed Gene you never will be there you won't have to desire to want who's soever Will you won't want that's why if you're a young person amen you've got to desire your heart I want to be a Christian I want to serve God with all of my heart you thank God for that that little seed Jean in there is calling out that woman at the well she had a seed on the inside amen and it was the anchor but abam says if you don't have that c g there's no chance for you but if you are a SE Gene of God you're coming why because the anchor says amen I will lose none of mine Paul said God knows them that are his and he won't lose one all right but you've got to be a part of the family of God you got to be a Blood of his blood flesh of his flesh life of his life genetics amen take my genetics take my dad genetics I never had to join the berer family you never had to join your family why you was born in it somebody come and say brother B you're not a b I'll slap you well not really but so to speak yes I am you're a liar if you don't think you're a liar let's go down here and have our genetics tested huh Ain that right that's always how they find out if some baby is the Daddy's baby or not right A lot of times there's big disappointments sad to say Amen but the Tad exp PR of who you are your desire brother abam even said it just depends amen all we're all made out of the stuff amen but it depends on when your Ambitions run depends on where your genetics are and if those genetics are there you can't help being who you are you're going to manifest that a lot of people come up and say brother Bor you look like your dad or your uncle or did that or the other why because it's part of the family amen aren't you glad to be a part of the family of God God Amen praise God God is good isn't he so my this this morning I'm just rejoicing night and day as I walk this narrow way for he abides how many's glad to be anchored in the age when everything's shaken I could read you Jude there and we won't get too much into it but it talks about how did the Angels left their estate ain't that right and the people that God brought out of Egypt ain't that right destroyed them afterwards that believe not amen they're like Raging Waves of the sea they're like clouds Without Rain amen driven With the Wind huh aren't you glad that you're oh I want to there's one aspect of this amen when it comes some moving am me when the Devil comes at us and all of the world comes at it we don't move but at the slightest little push the lightest little tug that the holy spirit amen moves you move with it ain't that right how many beli we don't we do believe in being moved but be moved by the holy spirit amen but not like they were tossed wandering about ain't that right like the stars here today there tomorrow believe this today believe that tomorrow amen I don't know but I would I'd be a it'd be crazy wouldn't it to be a Catholic then all of a sudden the pope changes something changes something makes it something different you know the bad part Brother Brad about even talk to a Catholic is well the the Bible ain't the absolute the church is the absolute is that what the argument they had with brother brandham right no the church can change things where they want to you can't do much cuz why how many knows we have an absolute have and Earth will pass away but my word will never perish whatever I say will not come back right amen you add one oh boy here's a good one just comes to me you go ahead and try to add one word Pope add one word you done taking your name out of the book because that's exactly what they do change it and add to and take away You're take and how about all those followers amen that's right all those that follow him are guilty of the same sin the Bible says the whole world wandered after the Beast ain't that right isn't this strange how here when the Pope says something like that we stand again on I got to get a camera up here so can everybody seeing that everybody's in agreement here but those churches and those people and those Muslims and all of them do you hear anything from them no they sit right there with him amen I'm thankful that we have an unchangeable immovable God that we're anchored to God bless you couple songs let's stand if you will so this morning was just a worship service I do feel this if there would be somebody that doesn't have that anchor you want that anchor this is what I thought I said don't stand there don't walk I give you permission to run to the altar this one time you can run say yeah yeah I got to hurry up man I gotta get I got to get anchored cuz that fall is right ahead quickly Bible says come quickly Escape hither quickly hurry up how many believes we better hurry people better worry hurry because it's going to to be over with here soon we don't know just when but it could be anytime so if you ain't anchored get anchored amen with our heads bowed eyes closed let the Holy Spirit go down into your heart ask yourself if you're really Anchored In Christ if Christ has really revealed himself to you and you know who you are that you're a child of God you're a son you're a daughter of God you're a Christian but if you're not really sure raise your hand and say I want to be sure I want to know that I know that I know that I know that I'm one of his God bless that hand God bless you Lord Jesus we ask God that those hands that are up right now Lord that you'll give them unwavering Fearless confidence that they're all right with you that all their sins are under the blood and that they're Anchored In Christ Lord this morning these hands that go up we ask God in Jesus name name let them have an experience like they've never had Lord give them that confidence Lord Jesus anchor them and when the storms come when the winds blow it doesn't move them we think of the prophet of God when somebody would drop dead perhaps in the audience he said just stay calm just be still don't get All Shook Up don't get all out just be calm the holy spirit is here may that be our lives when something happens happens drastic happens we don't have to get all tore up but we can just have that confidence in Christ that he has brought us safe thus far he'll lead us home I pray for every person under the sound of my voice every sheep God that you have put under me Lord Jesus and given me I pray that you would give them that anchor Lord and let not one of them be lost Lord When Storms Come their way when doubts come into our teenagers Minds when they see hypocrisy when they see faults and failures in the pastor deacons trustees Mom Dad neighbors other Christians may they not look to that but they may look to you and say God I want that anchor in my heart so much that I don't rely on what other people or don't do or do but Lord I want to have a personal relationship with you father we ask God in Jesus name that you would Grant each one father this walk so that in if their time would tar Lord that it would hold them even as it has me and others here for so many years that that anchor has proven itself that it holds because you you have shown us that we are one of your children we ask in Jesus name amen and amen the anchor hold though the ship is batter the Anor
