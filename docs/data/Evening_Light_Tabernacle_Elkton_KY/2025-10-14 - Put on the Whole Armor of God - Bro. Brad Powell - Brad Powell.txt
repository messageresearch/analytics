TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And I got to thinking about that and I thought, you know what? We as Christians, we are in a spiritual warfare tonight. We live every day we get up out of the bed and our feet hit the floor. We are in a war. We are in a battle. And I don't know about you, but I don't always want to be on the defense. When you're in the defense, you're always taking blows. You're always taking blows when you're on the defense. You say, "Well, a boxer puts up his guard and he's guarding himself." We got the shield of We got the shield of faith. We got righteousness. We got truth. We got prayer. We got all of those weapons. We've got the word of God. But what good does it do you to have the word of God if you never swing your sword? and we sit back and we defend against everything. Oh, the devil's hitting my my finances. Oh, the devil, he's he's hitting my children. The devil's hitting my home, my marriage. The devil's hitting me over here. I I've lost my zeal. You're putting up your guard and you're taking lick after lick after lick. You ever seen a boxer, they put them in the ropes and they just wear them out? Some of us let the devil throw us in the ropes and just wear us out. Why? Quit living as a department of defense and find yourself as a department of war and fight your battles. Pull out the sword. Lord, &gt;&gt; we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities. You see, the life of the believer is against spiritual enemies. And we don't have to back down from these enemies. Think about it. Listen what the word says. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord in the power of his might. put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, against principalities, against powers and rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Therefore take unto you the whole armor, the whole armor, truth, righteousness, peace, salvation. This is the armor, the word of God. And when you've done all to withstand in the evil day, having done all to stand, stand therefore. You know, when you you look at the military and you look at the the military uh attire of the day that this is being described, you're putting on the whole armor, you got your helmet, you got your shield, you got your sword, you got all this armor on the front, but you know where you're not covered up in the back. You see, God doesn't plan on his children fleeing from the scene of the battle. You may get down. You may get knocked down. You may feel like you're depressed and defeated and you've been been overtaken by the enemy, but you never turn your back. You're too exposed standing face to face and say, "God, help me fight this battle. I stand on the word of God, so help me fight this battle.
