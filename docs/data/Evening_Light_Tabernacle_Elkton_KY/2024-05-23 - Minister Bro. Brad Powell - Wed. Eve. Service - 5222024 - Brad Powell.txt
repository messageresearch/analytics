Lord Jesus we ask God that you bestow a special blessing upon the minister Brother Brad tonight as he brings the word tonight Lord may it be just the right word for the right hour just what we have need of and we just know that you work that way Lord and we just ask God you'll receive our worship and our praise to you tonight in Jesus name amen and amen you can be seated for a second amen I'm going to do something just a little different amen I've had a pretty good rest amen and so amen hadn't preached for a little bit and today I was just had a little thought so can I just preach to you for just a couple minutes amen my thought was on Amen and surrendering amen that's what my thought was on the power of surrender and so forth amen we know that to surrender is to submit it's to yield and the international basically symbol of surrender is amen how many knows what it is right I don't care if you're I don't care if you're North Korea I don't care where you are you put your hands up that means you surrender you yield amen praise the Lord and we're thankful for that because it also means that uh whatever battle you're fighting it means that you have yielded Amen to the opposition or to another party and you've become by surrendering you become a prisoner amen how many believe that by surrendering you come become a prisoner amen and sometimes that's not easy to do people don't want to surrender to Christ people would rather die and go to hell than to surrender They'll Never Surrender they'll never yield amen but God's people will yield amen they'll surrender and you become a prisoner and when you are a prisoner amen that whoever you're a prisoner to owns you they own you both uh Body Soul and Spirit ain't that right they want to kill you they can kill you if they want to make a slave out of you make you work make you do this whatever it is you become subject to the will of the one that you surrender to amen is anybody listening to to me tonight how many please that that's exactly what the Christian does when we yield to Christ amen now he has the power to do whatever he wants with you and through you and work through you amen just had a little little mini sermon here but just a little bit of a exhortation amen but we be become a prisoner you also become a slave amen am mean you become a servant that's what servant means sometimes is amen you become a slave amen we're know that we're love slaves to Christ isn't that how many believes that we're love slaves to Christ praise the Lord amen a prisoner to him tend I like the fact that you become subject to the will of the one that you're prisoner to amen now God can fulfill his will through you when you are a prisoner to him amen listen to this he says about uh about Paul Paul called himself a prisoner in uh Ephesians 3 for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ to you Gentiles amen listen to what he says amen he says God is looking see the love of God had been so tremendous a re Revelation to Paul that he could not get away from it that's the true experience of every True Believer who meets God you come in contact with something that's so great that you become a prisoner to everything else you get away from everything else and imprison yourself to this one thing I had mentioned that is that if you do become a prisoner and you do yield you do surrender Onin this it has to be your choice it has to be your choice to do so amen praise the Lord I'm just glad that you mean God helped you to make that right choice to become a prisoner because it has to be upon the basis of free moral agency of something that you want and desire and in any battle you have to choose hey this is I I want to surrender to this so he says now notice he says God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything else you cannot be connected with anything but Christ even your father your mother your brother sister you can't love anything else more than you love Christ you prisoner to it a it right even your father your brother husband wife he says he listen you're only and and you're only connected to Christ and him only then God can use you until then he can't amen Moses was an elected deliverer and finally God had elected his elected subject a prisoner to him Hallelujah he could only move is the word of God moved in him who shall I say sent me I am how will I do it I'll be with you how many believes that when you become a prisoner to Christ amen you just only do what the word tells you to do you follow it amen and how many's glad to be a prisoner because I'll tell you this how many knows another thing is is that uh Jesus says you can only you know nobody lives to himself no man dies to himself you're going to be a servant to somebody remember the guy with the sign in California with sign on his back he says on the front it was I'm a fool for Christ and on the back it said and who's fool are you you're going to serve you're going to serve somebody how many knows that you're not a God God don't serve nobody a't that right no and we're not Gods we're subjects we're servants and he says no man can serve two masters you're going to serve one or you going to serve the other you going to be a slave or a prisoner or to one or the other and how many knows anybody that's ever served the devil realizes he's a tough Taskmaster he'll make things look good he'll make it things oh my things great but he'll leave you empty and dry amen and spit your bones out so to speak amen and not care for you and just destroy you but praise be to God when you have become a prisoner to Christ then guess what he's responsible for clothing you he's responsible for feeding you he takes care of you he knows the fall of a sparrow he knows the number of your hair he fights all your battles for you he gives you Joy he gives you peace I don't know about you but I like being a prisoner to Christ Give the Lord a hand say thank you Lord Jesus God bless you tonight amen every one of you Amen Brother David bless you love the Lord you know I was thinking as sister Becky was playing that song I have decided to follow Jesus have you ever heard where that came from the story behind that course I looked it up because I'm the world's worst to getting things wrong to make sure that I hadn't remembered something and got my songs messed up 150 years ago some people decided to serve the Lord Jesus and in their tribe I'll just make it short and simple they begin to witness about God and the chief got mad and this man was saying I will no turning back and so they took bows and arrows and they said we're going to shoot your kids they shot his boys he said I have decided to follow Jesus there's no turning back they said we're going to shoot your wife he said no though none go with me but still I'll follow they shot his wife he said I have decided to follow Jesus I said Lord help us to follow you tonight no matter what the cost but aren't you thankful for his grace and mercy and his love in our life and amen I just I just appreciate the Lord tonight and and that that little course came on

praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God Amen you certainly certainly sound like you're ready to worship and and defitely praising God tonight and and your hands of surrender as brother Bor said and that just goes right along with our thought tonight so uh we uh want to get right into the word if we could and and uh want to just share a little quote with you before we get into the scriptures tonight and uh just just listen to what the prophet's saying he's preaching in in 1959 here and in the in the message blind bardus and he says we tonight could hold on to God's representative like that now just just take that statement in in mind and think about that if you could tell the holy Spirit tonight as sure as you are the immortal spirit of God you give me a promise in the Bible of my healing and I'm going to hold on to it till I see something happen he said there would be Miracles taking place he says there would be Miracles taking place the lame would be jumping and running and doctors all over Los Angeles would be surprised tomorrow to see their patience healed and well he we could just hold on uh take a hold of God's agent God's agent today is the Holy Spirit and hold on to it he said and whenever you come in contact and you feel the Holy Spirit on you then hold on to it and say I'll not leave you stay with it like Jacob did when he wrestled with the angel I'm going to hold on till you bless me and give me the things that I'm Desiring think about that think about that direct statement I'm going to hold on to you until you bless me and give me the things that I'm Desiring he said wouldn't it be wonderful a Revival to break out he said all up and down the coast here people right here tonight those that are listening on the air if they would take that attitude towards the Holy Spirit tonight now a lot of times we try to approach the Holy Spirit I feel like a and we're asking and and and we're calm and and we're we're uh more like at the feet of the of of the table you know what I'm saying we're kind of like can you please pass the bread or can you can you please pass the potatoes but he says if we could just take the attitude of this to the Holy Spirit and say I'm going to stay with you until I find out the thing that I want to know yes wow that's a that's a quite a direct statement and I believe so many times as Believers we have promise after promise we we know God's A Healer we know God a deliverer we know he's a savior we know he's he's all these things and all the attributes that God is we know these things but we fail to Simply attain it because we simply fail to hold on to it oh God I know you're a Healer I'm sick and then we let it go oh God I I I I know I need deliverance from this problem or this habit or this this this affliction I know you're the I know you're the person to do it but then we let it go that's right so I want to speak to you tonight on wrestling for your promises turn with me in the Book of Genesis if you would and we're going to try not to hold you too long tonight so uh brother Bor gave quite an exhortation and and it kind of got me fired up I think he's fired up he's had a little break and he's he's ready to go I just thought about handing him my notes and say go but uh we we certainly appreciate the Holy Spirit Genesis 25: 20 and 26 through 26 and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to wife the daughter of bethuel the Syrian the sister to Laban the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived now watch now and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels the one shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first one came out red all over like a hairy garment and they called his name Esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob now we know the word the name Jacob the prophet tells us over and over in many of his messages means Sur planter and what that means is somebody or something is taking the place of another through Force Through scheming through deceit through strategy or some of the like like that so here we've got Jacob here the surlan now go with me to Genesis 32 24-30 and Jacob was left alone sometimes that's a place we need to get to Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the Hallow of his thigh and the Hallow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hasth thou power with God and with men and Hast prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou doest ask after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place pel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved you can have your seats may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the words tonight so I I want you to notice here and I want you to look and and notice here that that God asked Jacob in verse 27 what is your name now was this because because God uh didn't didn't know who Jacob was is this because he didn't know who he was wrestling with or he was confused or had forgotten where he was at in time and and he's just got a hold to this guy and he's thinking man what am I doing here who is this no he didn't ask him that for that reason he asked him what his name was because he wanted he wanted Jacob to describe and openly admit who he was and so Jacob by looking at God in the face to face and say my name is Jacob he was telling God exactly who he was I'm a deceiver I'm a liar I'm a surlan he's recognizing who he is in the face of God and brothers and sisters we a lot of times need to get to a place where we look at God and we tell God exactly who we are I'm a fa you know many times we hear we're bride we're bride we're bride and we love to hear we're bride right amen but there's a job for the bride to do there's a job for the bride do there is an attitude that the bride has to have and that is an attitude of submission to God it's an attitude that that I'm weak and he is strong it's that kind of an attitude so God is having Jacob describe who he was and we listen to the prophet describe him and and it kind of sets us back to think that the prophet of the hour would describe a man as this but listen to what he says he says let me explain this example to you he said we want to keep the keep it in the scriptures while we're on these two spirits he said Esau was far better man in every way that you wanted to take than Jacob was he said now Jacob he said God forgive me for my remarks so he's fixing up he's fixing to put the rubber on the road right here God forgive me for my remarks he says he was a little sneaker he said I want you to notice how he was he was a little tattletail he was a big liar he said if I'm saying something wrong wrong God forgive me but he lied and he is a cheat and there never was one hardly like him he said he took them speckled sticks you know the story you you you know the Bible he said he took those speckled sticks and he put them in the water and he callused the the pregnated cattle and the Sheep to bring forth speckled sheep speckled cows so that he could take them into his own instead of giving them to his father-in-law he said he did that he said he even impersonated his brother by putting on his brother's coat over some over some wool and and went before his blind prophet father and lied and said I'm Esau he said why he was a little Shyer he really was he said you think in your mind that he was a great man of God and I don't want to say something bad about him you see he said but I'm just trying to point out a little little things that he did just look how sneaky he was a liar sure he was he was terrible woo poor Jacob poor Jacob brothers and sisters that that's what the prophet had to say say about Jacob in the Bible we're talking about Jacob who come from a Royal bloodline Abraham was his grandfather he has come from a Royal bloodline he'd been around the message his entire life he knew the message frontwards and backwards he knew all the lineages he knew all the tablets he knew everything that it could be and here he stands in the Prophet says this man is a liar he was terrible so if he says that about him what does he say about you and I oh do we want to hear this ah we cringe he said except a man be born again he gives us that except a man be born again he said why must he be born again he's dead with with the flesh he's in he's a hybrid he's got to be born again because he was born in sin he was in Eve sin shaped in iniquity coming in the world speaking lies he's a liar to begin with he's talking about us before a conversion the Bible says he is it don't matter how holy his parents was or anything about it he's a liar to begin with the only way we can tell the truth is to say what truth is through his own lips the only way the truth can come anything contrary to that word he's a liar he says now that's pretty flat but that's what God Said let every man's word be a lie and mine be true he said see he's got to be born again he's got to have every word the only way he can be born again is that life of God in him to produce that life it takes the life of God on the inside of us it takes a a face-to-face conversation with god and letting God have control of Our Lives before God can work through us and in us and be able to call ourselves bride of Jesus Christ we're going to spend some time on Jacob tonight and Jacob's life was not not an easy life we might say and but a lot of the problems he went through he brought up on himself I don't know about you but I've brought some problems upon myself and so Jacob has brought some problems upon himself but this very started at the very beginning when he was conceived uh by Rebecca after she became the wife of Isaac and so right there we see in the very womb we see this wrestling match begin to take on and Rebecca's now having a rough time this pregnancy has not been what what we would call the perfect pregnancy because the No Doubt from what the scriptures say her stomach was in a rumble there was a war going on a fight inside of her and Rebecca goes before God and she says I want to know the reason that there's a struggle going on inside of me what is going on and God speaks back to her and says you are having twins and they're struggling for dominance over one another and in time these two nations with very different personalities one of them is going to be stronger than the other and the older is going to serve the younger what does this put through her mind now what does she begin to think what does she begin to think when all this this is going on and and God just told her that your your second born is going to be the the ruler and the leader over your first born brothers and sisters I want you to notice even at the moment of birth when Jacob reached out and he grabbed a hold of Esau's foot he grabbed a hold of him as to during the delivery as to say you're not you might get a hold of me you might be first you might be the first but I'm going to grab a hold of you and I will let you know I'm on your tail right there from the very beginning he grabbed a hold of that that heel he grabbed a hold of a lifestyle from birth he grabbed a hold of a lifestyle of lies and mischief and deceit and cunning trickery and Jacob's personality of a deceiver and a conniving mind was developing as he drew his very first breath a newborn child and he's given the name Jacob now Esau we look at Esau poor Esau and Man Poor Esau born full of red hair must have looked like an animal that's what the Bible says right when he was born said he had look like he had a fur coat on poor thing they even nicknamed him red did you know that they called him Edom which means red so they nicknamed him like we would hey red so here is Esau now and and and things are starting out in a kind of a bad way for these but these twins they grow up now and these opposite personalities begin to pronounce themselves and the competition between one and the other begins to get greater and greater and greater the competition to gain the respect the competition to gain the love and the Adoration of their parents is is now growing all the time in them one wants the all the love and respect from this parent one wants all the love from this parent and here is Esau now Esau's living up to uh he's he's living up in a nature type he's a hunter he he he's a hunter and he's a man of the field and he loves camping and sleeping under the stars and fishing and hunting and outdoor activities and Isaac loved Esau because he was a man's man he was an excellent shot with a bow Isaac loved it when he would go hunting cuz he would bring home all the good venison to him and he would have great meals because Esau would provide with his bow the hunter but now here's Jacob on the flip side now here's Jacob the opposite of of Esau a homebody he wants to stay inside the tent he wants to stay out of the sun he wants to hang around Rebecca's skirt tail mama's boy he learned how to cook and how to clean the tent he won the heart of his Mama because she just spoiled him little mama's boy and so here is Jacob now always going there he's trying to stay inside Esau's out hunting Jacob's at home cooking stew think about it he's stewing on ways he can cheat his brother and he's stewing on these things how can I get my brother how can I get better than him how can I gain more more more than he's got and so Jacob's mind was constantly trying to figure out how can I cheat somebody and manipulate them and manipulate them to where I can have them do exactly what I want them to do you see sooner or later it was almost inevitable that these two brothers with different personalities are going to clash and they're going to clash in a manner that's going to bring division to the family and the parents no doubt begin to show obvious preferential treatment read the Bible as parents we shouldn't do that as parents it causes Division and we see it in the Bible here that Isaac loved Esau more and Rebecca loved uh Jacob more and they began to put their lines between the two and it started be causing a division and here Jacob is now we look here and we see what is happening here he begins to wrestle in his head and he begins to sneak around and connect KN and he says I've got to figure out a way to steal my brother's Birthright I got to figure out a way how I can become the one who owns that Birthright and it all started out with a pot of stew think about how simple this is it all started out with a pot of stew it started out when Jacob was at home and he's making stew and he's cooking and he knows that Esau's soon going to return from his hunting trip and so Esau comes in and Esau sits down there and he says Jacob feed me please feed me I'm hungry can't you see I'm famished I I'm going to die I'm I'm about to faint and Jacob says oh are you hungry are you hungry you look a little famished you look like you might be on your last last leg are you feeling okay no I'm not feeling okay I told you I'm I'm hungry I'm going to die please feed me something how much does that Birthright mean to you come on Jacob can you imagine this conversation come on Jacob give me something to eat I I I will but how much does that Birthright mean to you that's right but it don't mean nothing to me if I'm dead well sell it to me for this bowl of pottage for this bowl of Stew think about this and so Esau gives up his birth right and sells out his birth right because he feels he's at the point of death and what profit is it going to be for him so he gives it up and now Jacob says swear to me swear to me swear to me that this is mine from now on it's yours you can have it just feed me so Jacob gives Esau bread and pottage of lindal and he ate he drank and he rosed up and after he got his belly full it said Esau despised his Birthright can you think about that what was this Birthright what was the importance of this Birthright this Birthright that was sold for a bowl of Stew this Birthright was his natural privilege to the firstborn son to become the head of the family to have all of the responsibility of the family to have the authority in the family to be the head of the family to be the most powerful sibling in the family and to own all of the family property this person would be responsible for his younger Sons the widows the unmarried daughters all of the kids the grandkids that would still be around after Isaac died not only that but he would this person would be entitled to a blessing from God now back in those days a blessing of God God would deal with the head of the family above and so the blessings went down into the head of the family the oldest the firstborn those with the B the birthright so now Esau has given this up do you think maybe Esau thought man Jacob was only joking with me maybe he thought Jacob was only joking with me but Jacob wouldn't surely force me to to keep this into the bargain he knows I'm the oldest he knows I'm the birthright he knows I'm going to get the blessing but boy was he wrong his name alone santer the deceiver the conniver he got him he got him had him right where he wanted he had planned this out all along and he knew he was going to steal Esau's right to the authority of the family and take it for himself you think about it and you think poor Esau he really it it don't look like he cared it don't look like he cared because all he wanted was his stomach full all he wanted was that's all that mattered was right at that moment that's what happened he couldn't wait and and and see what would happen he had to take care of it right now how careless and foolish was Esau think about it how careless and foolish was he to sell out the blessings of God but people do it every day believers do it every day they sell out the blessings of God for the things of this world there's people sitting at home tonight watching television they're not streaming this service they're watching tevision where's their Birthright how much do they care they're happy Esau was happy with a full belly but boy didn't life get rough didn't life get rough because now Jacob has this Birthright but this wrestling match with Esau wasn't over because now Rebecca helps him to fool Isaac into stealing from Esau once again and and being a little mama's boy paying off for Jacob being a little mama's boy is paying off and and Esau is being blindsided by his conniving lying brother and mother you say man you preaching hard on them Patriarchs hey they live they put their pants on just like we do that's how we learn that's how we don't make the same mistakes Genesis chapter 27 the story is told how Jacob being disguised by Rebecca to fool her blind husband places animal skins on his arms and on his neck and and causes Isaac to pass the blessing of the firstborn onto Jacob instead of Esau so now Jacob has the birth right and the blessing of his father the two most important things that a firstborn could have you see how you see what it meant when he come out of that womb and he grabbed a hold he grabbed a hold of a lifestyle he grabbed a hold of a way of living and a way of life that he would grab a hold of whatever he needed to get him wherever he wanted to be and there's people around the world doing that they set Church aside to grab a hold of the things of this world so it appears he's got the birth right he's got the blessing so now it appears that he's in control of his life I mean he's got it all he's got all that you could ask for he's got power he's got Authority he's got land he's got Prestige and brothers and sisters we have to be careful that we don't fool ourselves to think that possessions mean that we are living where we need to live hey I see a lot of politicians like to eat ice cream you know what I'm talking about has made millions and millions and millions and has gained lands and lands and properties and properties and I'm not just picking on Uncle Joe but it's it's politicians it's church members yep it's pastors it's evangelist we got to get to the flip side of this thing before we get going too deep here but don't fool ourselves so now we get to a place that Esau says I have had enough of Jacob and it says under his breath he saysi hate Jacob in my heart I hate him he's lied to me he's deceived me I'm his brother he has taken two things that are absolutely mine I will slay my brother now you see how this division is taking us down two roads Rebecca finds find out and she goes to Jacob and says Jacob you got to run for your life you got to run for your life after all the deceiving and the manipulating that you've done you're not a fighter you can lie you can Swindle you can cheat but you can't survive your brother Esau he is a dead shot with a bow and arrow he hunts he can shoot a squirrel at a 100 yards he won't miss you you got to run so Jacob leaves the scene and Esau goes on the hunt after him you see I told you that you would pay a price for taking precedence of one child over the other now Rebecca stands here with no children no children of her own her husband is now soon to be dead and she stands here all alone causing the division of her sons all because she wanted what she thought was best for one what we sow we shall also reap so here's Rebecca now she's beginning to look and she's beginning to see that the seeds that she sowed are not going to be a good outcome for her children if things don't change no doubt she can look and say what have I done what have I put my children through what am I doing why did I do all this now they're gone and one's going to kill the other or the other's going to kill this one they've stolen from each other they've lied to each other they hate each other and this wrestling match is beginning between Jacob and Esau it's escalated into a fight to death listen now this goes on for 20 years 20 years this division is taking place between Jacob and Esau though they go their separate ways now Jacob can you imagine Jacob always looking over his shoulder now that don't sound like a born again Holy Ghost filled Christian to me if I got to walk my daily walk wondering if somebody's about to kill me shoot me in the back cut my throat I'm not living exactly where I need to live and so here's Jacob for 20 years for 20 years this is going on and for 20 years Esau and Jacob watch this they are prospering think about this this is two two people that's that's Waring at one another God's people living lives that you can't imagine one with a murderous Spirit one with a deceiving Ling spirit and they're prospering let me tell you this you see Satan he don't care that you prosper Satan don't care that you prosper he don't care that you make money he don't care that you're in church he don't care that you sing in the choir he don't care that your kids go to Sunday school he don't care about any of that no he don't care as long as there's division as long as there's wrath as long as there's hatred as long as that's the life you're living as long as long as the as long as they was living below their promises and their god-given privileges he don't care you see that's why I say it's not enough just to be saved that's where people stop they get saved and they stop right there and they may Prosper they may go to church their kids may sing all these things happen but are they getting all the promises that God has offered them because what good is it to be saved don't take this the wrong way we all need to be saved if you're not saved let's get to the altar but what good is it to be to to be a child and never an heir of anything that's right and so here for 20 years revenge is ruling the heart of Esau for 20 years fear and dread ruled the life of Jacob and he's Forever on the run from a brother who vowed to kill him what good did stealing the birthright do him at this point what good does it do to own the birthright and you can't even go out to celebrate it you're living a life hiding and struggling just to stay alive until the day when Jacob's heart begin to change Jacob's heart begin to change and he thought to himself you know I've been wrong you know it's something about when you're a child God you may run for a long time you may tell a lot of lies you may deceive a lot of people you may you may do some horrendous things in your life but when God begins to speak to the heart and Pricks the heart of that child of God and he began to prick the heart of Jacob and Jacob said I'm wrong I've done my family wrong I've done my brother wrong I've done all these people wrong I've stolen I'm a liive before God I need to make peace but he didn't know how and he's afraid if he goes to try to see Esau that to make things right that Esau is going to cut his throat and so he sends out people to fill it out he sends out his servants to fill it out and see what's going on and as they go and they come back and The Messengers return to him and they say we saw you brother Esau and he's coming to meet you oh that's nice with 400 of his men oh Lord Oh Lord what can I do and he begins to get distressed and Afraid and and he he begins to think what can I do so he says take half of my flocks and half of my family and go this way take the other half of my flocks and my family and go this way surely of goodness his people can't catch us all and while we're doing that I'm going to set aside 200 she goats 20 he goats 200 's 20 Rams 30 camels with coats 40 kind that's cows 10 Bulls 20 she asses and Foos and when he comes and he sees all this I'm going to say my Lord this is yours I I've been saving this for you whose is this Jacob it's yours Esau that's what I've been doing I've been Mak I've been I've been I've been planting all this stuff I've been been having these these animals and and reproducing and it's all I was doing it all for you now Esau's Revenge he knew he was still coming to kill him and he's divided now the two directions a a and and he sends him and he sends these people away and now here he stands alone and the Bible says he stood there alone you see when your life is on the line you begin to look at things a little different you know you're really sometimes young people they don't think about God until some tragic accident happens then all of a sudden God is the first and foremost and now Jacob stands here and he's looking at this and he says I'm all alone what am I going to do and the Bible tells us that he begins to cry out he begins to pray and he begins to cry out but I'm going to tell you this is where his real wrestling match started because now here he is it's not a fight with Esau now that's on the that's on the back burner now this is a this is a fight between himself and almighty God because you see Jacob realized something has got to change in me something has got to change in me I can't stand myself the way I am anymore sometimes we got to get to a place it would say I can't stand myself no matter how good things are I can't stand myself you say who are you talking to if I'm not talking to you I'm talking to myself because when Brad Powell gets in the way I can't stand myself and he's looking at this and he says I'm tired of living a life on the run I'm tired of living a life and on the run and and I want God to be in my life I want the blessings of God the way I should be getting the blessings of God Jacob needed Deliverance Jacob needed deliverance and the Bible tells us that he's alone and he's he's emptying out and he's he's crying and he and he's right there in prayer and all of a sudden a man approaches him and this man not only approaches him it doesn't say he said anything it just says that all of a sudden they become entangled in a wrestling match and so now this man that Jacob is wrestling with this was not Esau it wasn't himself who was this man that grabbed a hold of Jacob it was none other than God Almighty now God has a h of Jacob and they're fighting one after another hour after hour after hour hands locked together can you imagine we've all done it we've all played Uncle right Mercy uncle whatever you call it I was pretty good at it when my kids were about 12 but I I don't try it anymore these arthritic fingers can't handle it but can you imagine being locked together with all of your strength battling back and forward and and God is looking at him and no doubt God begins to push the pressure down on Jacob can you imagine as he begins to push the pressure down on Jacob and say get this out of your life get the doubt out of your life get the reception out of your life get the world out of your life and now Jacob is pinned down from this position and he's looking up into the eyes of God Almighty and now Jacob is looking up and he begins to think okay I'll get that out of my life and he begins to press and he begins to press and he begins to press and he said but I want to be blessed I want you to bless me I want the blessings of healing I want the blessings of Deliverance I want the blessings of love and the blessings of joy and the blessings of my family I want all these blessings but get hatred out of your life and this battle's going back and forth and back and forth for hours and hours you see Jacob in order for him to get deliverance from lying and cheating deceiving conniving he had to get to a place where God could deal with him one onone hand in hand brothers and sisters we need to get to a place where we can get where God can get with us and deal with us one onone hand in hand if we want the blessings of God we have to be willing to submit to God I don't know where people get the idea that you can have blessings just by calling yourself a Christian there's sacrifices that's made you see that's the way God still deals with us today we're here in a Congregation of what 50 people I don't know and we're here in this congregation but the spirit of God begins to deal with us individually one to one each one of you know that God is speaking to you in a different way and I can tell I can look the pastor can look and see who God is dealing with and he's dealing with each one of us in a different way and a different time now he's speaking across the whole congregation but your need your grasp that you grabbed the heel that you grabbed a hold of are you with me the heel that you grabbed a hold of is different than the heel I grabbed a hold of now I could tell every one of you and confess what bothers me and you could confess to me what bothers you but those confessions will do nobody any good it's only when we come face to face and confess to God that's when we get somewhere with God that's that's when God can been to pour out Deliverance onto your life that's how Jacob got Deliverance it wasn't when he was with the group of people it wasn't when he was with the family but it was when he separated himself and said God I need you so there's a wrestling match taking place right now in our hearts in your heart my heart there's no doubt something that you've got in your mind right now that God is dealing with you with he's dealing with you about that and so right now the Holy Ghost is locked in on us aren't you thankful he cares that much to visit us I tell you I was back there in the study and I had no idea how this was going to go this wasn't what I had intended to preach up until about four hours ago but I was sitting back there and it just felt different I was sitting back there I sat in a different place and all of a sudden I was praying and I could feel that anointing the spirit Holy Spirit coming out and the peace that that come upon me and I thought Lord I don't know what you're doing tonight but this is going to be a special kind of night because Deliverance is in the building surrender is in the building freedom is in the building we don't have to wrestle ourselves anymore just get before God and let God do the work you see Jacob's heart wasn't easy to change there was a struggle there within and without this wrestling match wasn't about pinning somebody down to the ground for the count of three no this was more of a spiritual an emotional wrestling match and Jacob finds himself right there and he's he's getting ready to get right there before God and he's still got all these pain and hurt and fear and doubts and trouble so let me ask you tonight what are you wrestling and how long are you going to wrestle it and let it keep you away from the promises of God Jacob finally is getting into a place in this wrestling match and God is putting the pressure on him but Jacob refuses to give up I like that about him we heard a lot of negative about him let me tell you I could tell you a lot of negative about me you could tell me a l of negative about you I'm not worried about that what I'm worried about is are you willing from this day forward to grab a hold of God and say God take a hold of my hand when I can't walk help me walk when I don't know what to do Lead Me Lord when I don't know which direction to turn bless me Lord when my kids are sick bless them with healing lord they're in this struggle and God is is is putting it all on him and he's trying to get him to surrender to his own will and God touches him in the hollow of his thigh oh do anybody ever had hip pain back pain sciatic how about that so now God has got his attention God has put his thumb right in the hollow of his thigh and dislocated his hip joint why did he do that why did God do that was was it so that he could win so that he could him so that he could make him a for the rest of his life no but he' done that so that he would have to walk a little different he done that so that he would realize I I I no longer walk as a sneaky snake I no longer walk as a caniver but now I walk in truth now now I walk in love now I walk in forgiveness now I walk in the trust of the Holy Ghost he's walking a little different he ain't as powerful as he once was I can imagine him quoting some prophetic scripture when I'm weak then I'm strong because it ain't me it's God long about Daybreak comes in and God says let me go for the day breth and he says I'll not let you go do you ever wanted something so bad you'd do about anything for it how about a blessing from God I'm not going to let you go unless you bless me unless you bless me with all that I have need of because I need Victory I will wrestle you God Almighty until I become Victorious through your blessings hold on to it but how many of us have held on and wrestled with the same old problems you got things in your life you just can't overcome well I guess I'm the only one brother B and you battle day in and day out and and you got this same problem how long you going to wrestle with that until you let God have the victory how long are you going to look over your shoulder and wonder when that old Satan that old Devil's going to come back after you how long are you going to hold on to it Jacob wasn't worried about the rising of the sun he didn't care how long this match lasted can you imagine 8 to 10 hours in a grappling match let's put this in perspective I'd like to see these two guys right here go for 30 seconds they'd be out of breath sweating snorting spitting snotting but Jacob refused to give up on the blessings of God and he held on and he held on and he kept holding on and he held on until this wrestling match was over and the Lord had won you say the Lord won Jacob won who won well the Lord won and Jacob won because Jacob yielded to the Lord I don't care how you slice it they both winners how was Jacob and winter his whole identity had changed he's a new man he's a new new heart a new vision he's a new creation in Christ and he looks down here and his name which was Jacob as he looked God in face to face and had to tell him my name is Jacob I am a deceiver and he said not any more that's right you are a deceiver anymore you've asked for blessing you've asked for everything that you ever wanted and now I'm going to bless you and I will now call your name Israel because you have come face to face with God I love to come face to face with God I love it when God just Woos me right into his presence and pulls me right up there and the Holy Ghost anointing comes over us and we can tuck ourselves right up into the bosom of God and look at him face to face and say oh my Lord and Jacob looks at this place and he calls it panel he names this place the place of panel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved do you notice he didn't worry anymore about Esau it didn't matter anymore because he had come in contact with God no matter what happened his life was preserved he'd come face to face with God and now he knows what it means to live in the very presence of God his whole identity changed stand with me tonight I told you I wasn't going to keep you long listen to what the prophet says he said after Jacob wrestled all night instead of trying to war away that man Jacob held on to him he said I wish we had about a half an hour on that how that wrestling Prince how he was able to hold on until he got what he was after he held on until it took all night but he stayed there he wanted to be absolutely convinced and he stayed until God changed his walking he was convinced he says that's the trouble with us today we don't stay long enough till we get our walking convinced we don't walk like Christians we just stay long enough with him just stay long enough with him do we have the determination it takes do we have the determination that it takes for us to stay with him a little longer until he makes us walk different talk different live different act different believe different be different yeah because that's what the prophet said Jacob did yeah he said the things that we don't the think that we don't stay long enough we don't hold on he said Jacob held on he said let me loose I got to go how many of you have held on and prayed to God long enough that he says hey I got to go not too many hands went up there was it but how many times we I wish wish we could get lost in a place to where time don't matter to where the next appointment don't matter to where the next job matter to where the next ball game don't matter and we just get lost in God and he says he he had him there where he could talk different live different act different believe different be different he said he held on he said I'm not going to let you go until I'm thoroughly convinced he said and when you take a promise of God and hold on to that don't let him loose when you have a need when you have a a a a sickness in your life don't turn him loose don't settle for oh well I'm a Christian I'm saved say God bless me with healing and I'm going to hold on to that and if this sickness takes me to the Grave I'm going to hold on being healed he said and when you're convinced you want to know how you're convinced when you're convinced he said then you're concerned for others you see it didn't matter to Jacob anymore he let Esau have everything he he had it didn't matter money didn't matter popularity didn't matter matter cattle didn't matter homes don't matter cars don't matter but when you got something from God and you got a h of it then you're concerned for others he said there's something about it that makes you concerned let's just bow our heads tonight and pray Heavenly Father we just come before you tonight with this little illustration that we've brought before the people and Lord as you know I was wanting Go a different direction but I just felt your your pull and to go this way and to share this entire story and Lord I just trust this illustration was a blessing to the people no doubt Lord you

tonight tonight but it's a it's a humble group that hungers for you Lord we're here with a purpose we're here not to let the person beside us see us or to visit or to see what the next person's wearing as a prophet would tell us but we're here from for a visitation from you tonight Lord get us in a place to where time don't matter where we can just worship and praise and talk and pray with you Lord and pull us up close to your bosom and get us into a place place where we can just grab a hold of you because Lord I know that in my life I need my hand in your hand because Lord as the song
