27 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock here oh

of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord Brother TR children can be dismissed for Sunday school and you may be seated [Music] was a really good Psalm that we read this morning I like there in in five some of them always is you know stand out different to you at different times I guess but F stood out to me this morning quite a bit and uh if you've been walking in this Christian way anytime at all it says for in a time no there there'll always come trouble it says but in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock it's really good and we know trouble will come but we know that if we can hide in his Pavilion we'll be just all right if we'll go here let me try to see here all right just a little thought in the day and age that we live and uh the pressure that's on us in this age and just uh the different things the distractions that we have amongst us in our lives I guess uh I'm trying to look here first Peter if you want to go with me to First Peter just a one verse there and I got a couple different little verses marked down here but first Peter 5 and 7 I think it is here you casting all your care upon him for he careth for you this is the one I actually wanted to get to here is eight be sober be diligent because your adversary the devil is as a roaring lying lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour and that's the where we're kind of living in today's age uh I was thinking kind of on distractions and the press the pressure of the age that we live in the pressure different stuff that come up in our lives jobs and and uh the different distractions kind of that we have we all have to have a job and things but uh um everybody has different jobs I guess but for our job sometimes at the market Tammy knows and different ones know mom probably especially but just the different bombardment of different things uh of situations that come up and it's not sometimes one thing but it's multiple things at one time and creates such a pressure that sometimes you know you make a decision out of haste and and you may make the wrong decision sometimes sometimes you may make the right decisions but it's just a constant pressure and peppering of different things that might come up in a daily uh daily walk that uh extreme pressure and uh uh let's see here I'll go to the some of the one of the things was uh I have a quotee here it's just about brother Brenham saying about pressure but when we come under pressure then sometimes we can make like I said the wrong decisions are the devil tries to get us under that pressure and this is from letting off the pressure brother Brenham speaking letting not the pressure he said but there is a pressure on the people today and that pressure has no limitation or any denominational lines it has no age line it has no respect to persons it's not it's on The Young and the old good and the bad it's on everybody it's pressure he said we're living in an neotic age a nervous tension everybody is racing here and going there and going nowhere he said to that kind of an age and I know this church would be plagued with it as everywhere is plagued by it Tabernacle is flagged with it everywhere the whole world it's a day of pressure it's hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait Drive 90 miles an hour and then get home to for supper and wait two hours till it gets ready that's right he said it's a time of that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension the wife says something a little contrary and you want to fly off temper husband say something you want to Pat your foot and tell him to uh correct and get in the room well now husband I don't want no words with you go out there and wife oh I'm so nervous see why what's the matter he says all this together this T building up then the result of it is doing doing something wrong and acting out of place that's right now it'll make the the poor act that way it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way and it'll make the good act that way because it's tension it's steam built up got to blow it off somewhere see and don't know the blow uh you blow the boiler up he said we find it builds up as the day goes you talk to your boss if you're working and so on and so on if you speak to the kitty come here and uh the kitties do it said Mama there there you are he said it builds up and he said you feel like you're going to head is going to come off I know I'm with he said every day so I know what it means it builds up and then uh further down in the message he said I thought that it is letting off the steam everybody is just becoming a neurotic age everything is built up haven't got no time and that builds up to a place that it breaks up things and causes people to have hard feelings when they snap off they say things you don't mean to say um he said now everybody is guilty of it I'm guilty of it you're all guilty of it we all we all do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise so there's there's an excessive preure built up today I believe before I go any further I might say this I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing I believe the devil and we know the coming of the Lord is at hand and the Bible said in the last days that the devil would be going about like a roaring line and if he could get you under pressure hurrying running over something you'll make a decision that you wouldn't make if you'd sit down and think it over and that's totally the day that we live in we should have more time than we ever had because we have more conveniences than we ever had we have supposedly I guess easier uh than we ever had but everybody's under constant pressure and uh and it's a distraction that pressure is a distraction of the devil to try to get you in a situation where you would wouldn't make that decision on a normal day basis or if you kind of thinking it over like brother Brenham said or if you're in your right mind but it being under constant pressure you make it quickly and you might make the wrong decision it's a distraction of the devil and we're living in that day of constant pressure uh one of the thoughts that with being distractions and stuff you know uh preacher a while back said you know he had had uh this and you you've probably been in your car too seeing a bird in the in the road or something to that nature bird or a a squirrel chasing something or a bird looking for for his meal and under when he's distracted and busy focusing on his meal he might not see the car that's approaching and and going to kill him flat so uh that's one one distraction that's the example of distraction there's other distractions you know the devil sets traps for you uh you know with uh they they said back in the old days when they used to hunt or things like that that if they just took a a can and uh cut a little hole on the top put something shiny down in there the would go uh go in there for that something shiny and he'd make a fist and he couldn't get it out and he'd be trapped there so it's just different distractions and stuff i' had seen this little video of a it was a it was an animal video of uh a Viper that was on this this cliff and its tail looked exactly like a a spider it had the scales were over grown on the tail of it and it looked like spider legs and the end of the tail was a blunt end of the tail like a like a belly of a spider and it would sit there and it would run there those scales back and forth and the birds would look at it and it was so camouflaged and such a such a trap for the birds that the bird would come and pick pick try to get that spider and the bird would maybe not get it the first time and fly away and the bird would come back and get it again but we know the end of the story it wasn't the bird that got the spider it was the Viper that got the bird so it's just ways of the devil uh going about like a roaring lion trying to uh to stumble up God's children basically I had a couple more scriptures here let me see uh let's see the second one one of them that I kind of thought pertained to this was Ephesians Ephesians 6 Ephesians 6 and it's in verse I think it starts in verse 10 this is just Paul speaking about putting on the full armor of God finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole Armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for he says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand of the evil in the evil day and having done all to stand he says stand therefore having your loins G about you with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there into with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen uh Philippians if you go with me to Philippians three I believe it is I got these marked off but when when you get up here then then it's a little different than having it all put together in your mind it kind of scatters up but Philippians here let's see Philippians 3 starting in verse 12 it's just uh this is Paul speaking of keeping Focus basically not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of je of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen and then if we'll go to Corinthians First Corinthians we'll do uh verse it's uh chapter 15 starting in verse 51 and this is what we're trying to attain to I believe and this is the stage the the stage is being set with all the pressure and all the the the tricks and The Traps of the devil this is what we're attaining to or trying to attain to uh First Corinthians it's uh 15 starting in verse 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in the moment in twinkling of an eye at the last last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this Incorruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality we're heading up to to a Rapture and we sure don't want to be distracted and there's many more things that we're distracted by uh some of this it's traps of the devil and it's the pressure of the age we're we're distracted by devices and all these different things that we have uh in our life that's supposed to make our life easy but a lot of times just becomes a distraction for us but if we just stick with God's word and be keeping in his word uh brother Tom thank you brother amen amen I'm just trusting the Lord will speak to our hearts this morning amen had a strange dream last night amen we uh I usually I dream a lot but last night was a little different didn't sleep too well afterwards but man I dreamt that I seen the whole of the United States blowed up and seen the nuke like nuclear just in explosion and and I know we all know what brother bam said in the last Vision after uh a woman had come into power one of the last thing to come into power was a woman coming into power and amen after that you know he said he's seen in his last V part of that Vision he says as far as his eye could see he didn't say the whole United States but he said as far as his eye could see he's nothing but Boulders and burnt over amen amen and so we know how many knows there's fires coming amen I believe it's time to get ready amen time to be ready to leave this world Amen because God is certainly going to burn this sinful world Amen and those who have rejected his mercy and his grace this morning amen so we're going to uh you ready for that slideshow brother our son and brother John if you'll come up I'm give you to Mike and amen we've supported these people before it's some couple of missionaries in Pakistan amen and we haven't done no missionary work here for a while and so amen we're going to look at this and pray about it and see if we want to take up a offering next Sunday maybe for missionary we know brother Braham says you can't never go wrong doing missionary work ain't that right and so we always want to do that and so brother John amen he's been in contact with him and and like he said he's going to he'll tell you about it but we've supported him before amen but so bless you brother John amen good morning I'm sure you all agree we don't give enough to to foreign missions and um I'm I'm sure they agree this is going to be a good opportunity uh for us to pray and support them financially and and uh if you'll uh go ahead put the first slide up uh the country is Pakistan and um you'll see that they they need our help the brothers brothers are message believers and Christians over there um for what they're doing and um I believe the window of opportunity is closing I believe we won't have much time to to uh really do much for the Lord if we're going to do something for the Lord we we need to move pretty quick so and um this this brother here um this just show this slide shows some of the things that's happened in the country recently if you want to go back one brother Micah go back one um Pakistan suffered some really bad floods and uh they said I think the um a third of the country was underwater uh of the whole country and it's it's a big country and um there is a 90% it's it's a Muslim country 90% is of its Muslim and there there's like 1.3% Christians in the country so you know you can imagine the opposition that small group of Believers is going to get um in that country and Muslims and Christians they don't don't get along with one another and the Christians kind of stick to their own areas and their own their own groups and stuff but um this this slide shows some of the uh how it affected the country uh it shows how many how many um I guess my glasses ain't all that good I can't read it that good but how many people were displaced hous he destroyed and stuff in the in the country and and injured and and and a lot of message Believers lost their homes in that country also too and um what what this if you'll go to the next slide please that's this is the brother that we sent him money to we sent money to him before as Pastor B said we've helped him before not a whole lot of money but this is Pastor Akram in Pakistan he's a message

this morning that we've got the good news that's been Vindicated by God to be the truth for he said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen he's kept every promise of his word to us and we can rest assured we can hang our souls on what he has told us he will keep it he will keep that promise God can't make a promise to you that he's not able to keep this morning so what a privilege it is that we're gathered here not but under the revealed word of the hour amen the very word that'll Quicken our bodies what what a privilege it is this morning may the Lord richly bless you if you have your Bibles turn with us over to the book of second Corinthians 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 10 we counted an honor to be be here with you once again all always enjoy coming this way this great memories here and sure brother by lives to come with trust something he said to help you in your eyes or maybe small in someone else's eyes it's important in God's eyes and no matter what you're facing this morning we serve a God who can do something about it amen don't you tell me he can't do it I've seen him open blinded eyes I've seen the lame walk I've seen him raise the dead there's nothing that our God cannot do this morning amen and even save a sinner free someone from pornography amen glory there's nothing that our God can't do I want to read now from 2 Corinthians chapter 6 starting at verse 10 the Bible says this as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet possessing all things amen let's just bow our heads and hold your Bibles we'll read a little bit from Genesis 22 after we're seated but I want to speak to you this morning for just a little bit on professing what we are possessing Heavenly Father we love you Lord we thank you for all that you've done for us father I pray this morning that you would just take this simple thought Lord It's really the only kind I know how to preach rise within him to receive that which they have need of Lord father as they've said it's a Troublesome time a a wearisome time but yet God it's a rejoicing time because we see you said when these things begin to come to pass for us to lift up our heads our Redemption is draw nigh so Lord we pray that you'd move Among Us this morning those that are sick and Afflicted may be weary those unable to be here dear God may your spirit just just move upon them may the Healer pass by Lord and take every symptom every every every pain whatever it would be Lord just remove it from them that before the service is over lord the testimonies will be coming in that the Healer passed by Lord we wouldn't ask you these things if we didn't have faith that you was able to do it so we commit this congregation ourself into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride says God bless you you may be seated now turn with me over to Genesis 22 want to read there just for a couple of scriptures Genesis 22:15 nice pullit brother B the Bible says this and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn sayith the Lord for because thou H has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and multiply and I will multiply thy seed as a seed shall possess the gates of his enemy and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed why because thou Hast obeyed my voice amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word now we understand by these scriptures in verse 17 and 18 that Abraham is the father of the faithful and we are heirs to his promise through Christ now Abraham was just an ordinary man at one time he was actually an idol worshipper so what does that tell us about God it tells us that we serve a God who has transforming power now the word transforming it means the ability to bring about a dramatic change and we serve a god this morning who has the ability to bring about a dramatic change amen he can transform a drunk into a preacher I can say Amen to that he can transform a streee hearted into a lady he can transform a bit of water and make it sweet he can transform a sinate to a saint he can transform a world that is dark and void and without form and transform it into a Garden of Eden by the transforming power of the almighty God Amen the prophet said that's the transforming power of God that he can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it God's transforming power Jesus one day said if if these rocks hold their peace if the PE if these hold their peace the rocks will cry out and you think how can rocks cry out all right thank God no vocal cords and yet Jesus said if these hold their peace the rocks will cry out how could he make such a statement like that but you've got to remember the rocks and when you have the power to create you can make your creation do hallelujah what you wanted to do amen and God by his transforming power is going to take his old frail bodies of ours one day and it's going to transform them into young men and women Again by the transforming power of the almighty God am and you young people sit and say well that ain't fair to us we're young what are we ever going to experience I'll tell you what you experience God's going to take your young body and take you from youth to Eternal youth by the transforming power of the almighty God Amen that's the God we serve this morning now we understand by the Bible that Abraham wasn't looking for God and neither was you but God came looking for Abraham and as Abraham SE we could say the same thing amen when Adam was lost Adam the first son when he was lost who come looking for Adam God did then who comes looking for every son and daughter of God God does Amen we never sought God but it was always God seeking us out now God sought out Abraham because by his fance he knew that Abraham would believe him when he spoke so God sought out Abraham because he knew that he would believe him and God SS you out because he knew you would believe him when he spoke amen but said God has purposed and hid it from The Eyes Of The Prudent and wise and revealed it to predestinated babes who are predestinated to receive it you didn't stagger into this message we didn't stagger into this message but before the foundation Of The World God predestinated us for such a time as this this moment this time this hour this day Hallelujah that we would stand here and prove he's the same yesterday today and forever oh my then God help us this morning to be like Abraham that we never doubt God when he speaks to us God said because thou has obeyed my voice that I myself have sworn because there's none greater to swear by for God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear but none greater he swore by himself thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies not maybe not hope so not could be but shall now shall in the Bible is used to indicate a commandment or an obligation th seed shall it is a commandment amen you know like let there be light God said let there be light there was a commandment come on do we have light yes why God said so and that same God said that said let there be light said thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy and that same God said repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise into you and to your children even as far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call it is a commandment amen not could be not hoped so if you do this I'll do this says the Lord amen hallelujah are you with me this morning amen said I like this and Abraham was air to All by the promise so he could lay claim to everything that was in the land and the land itself Abraham had be given the promise now we understand he was the poorest man in all the country because he lived out there in the desert and lived in peace with God and lot was rich and lived in the city and became the governor of the city and he set in the gate he was a judge and he judged the city and he had all the riches and things but Abraham was in the desert perhaps the poorest man in the land yet he claim to possess it all he said I like that said tonight said we may not be rich in the world's Goods but we possess all things the church itself possesses all things say that with me the church itself possesses all things are you the church is the church here is the church here this morning we possess all [Applause] things amen oh my the prophet said I say this my friend to every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ that every person in here was healed when Jesus died at Calvary it's your possession not could be not hope so not maybe some day well one day I'll get it you've got it now oh my I like Indian stuff I I got this about four and a half per Native American something like that and I just I like feathers and I just like that stuff I was down in New Mexico and brother uel SAR took me down to the Indian market he was looking around and all this stuff and so it wasn't long after that that I went up into Connecticut to preach and I went into a brother's house who had married a a girl from the southwest and when I went into her house in the in the in the forer there on the wall was a was a a bow with arrows crossed like this and had uh deer skin and Beads and Feathers hanging off of it I thought man that's really that would look so good in my study I might have covered a little bit I'm not sure but I looked at that and I thought well I can't afford that I I'm just an evangelist so about a two years or so after that after seeing that B I was back down at brother Emanuel salar there in New Mexico and I uh brother man said your brother the last time you here said we really enjoyed you and I said I appreciate that brother it's kind words I thank you for that he said well after you left he said I was back at the Indie Market he said I saw something that reminded me of you and I bought it for you said I've had it ever since said I'd like to give it to you would you like to have it and I said yeah so he goes to the closet pulls it out guess what it was it was a bow with cross arrows dear it was the exact same piece and there I was up in Connecticut wishing I had it but in real I wish I had peace I wish I had power come to tell you you already own it amen we're already possessors of it this morning hallelujah amen then I say it's time it's time that we profess what it is that we possess amen amen think about that every person in here was healed when Jesus died at Calvary it's your possession and I say it's time we profess what it is we possess now everyone who's a Christian in this building this morning raise your hand that's good we praise the Lord amen now that wasn't me that's actually a quote brother said I ask you to raise your hands who was Christians and your hands went up everywhere he said you who you talking to you you have a legal right to everything that Jesus died for he died his death there at at the cross he gave his life that you might have legal rights to every Redemptive blessing he died for it's yours you're just afraid to possess you're afraid to claim it but I say let's not be afraid to possess what it is we profess and profess what it is that we possess amen oh my if we c a revelation of what God wants to do for us we wouldn't see fill our cup we would see fill my truck Lord amen hallelujah amen it's a legal right in an age when everybody wants the rights let me tell you we've got rights too god-given rights amen amen the prophet said one day the Gentile Kings declared war and they took law Abraham's nephew and took one of lost wife and his children all the rest of them and they left the country and in Genesis 14 14th verse when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive and brother B said I like that his brother his brother said look what lot had done to him and yet there was some kind of tithe that bind that in Abraham's eyes he was still a brother oh what a lesson we could learn from that we're not always going to agree on everything but we're brothers you know during World War II the Germans overrun the American unit they had to retreat you know anybody's been in the military you know we have a code of honor among the servers that we leave no one behind it's abandoned Brotherhood we leave no one on the battlefield but this battle was so raging that the the sergeant said we must leave the wounded we'll come back and get them later if we don't pull back everything's lost and he turned and it was this young boy and he had a like a fire ladder had this guy up on his shoulders the guy had been shot through the hips and he was bleeding everywhere there's so much blood you couldn't tell who was wounded and who wasn't and he's trying to carry this man off the battlefield and the sergeant said Son drop that man you we've got to retreat with will get him later and he turned back around and the boy was still trying to carry him under his weight and he told him the second time he said Son drop that man we'll get him we we've got to move back we'll come back and get him and it turned around the third time and the boy was still trying to carry this man off the battlefield and he said as your non-commission officer I order you drop that man he's too heavy and the boy yelled back sge He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother Hallelujah he man he was trying to get his brother off the battlefield amen we've all been wounded somewhere somehow but we're [Applause] brothers amen anybody ever read the autobiography of jono they said it took an Apache to catch an Apache and they they got the White Mountain the paches brought them into the military gave them ranks gave them rifles and they tracked down jono and his Warriors and they brought them in and when they put Jano on a train the White Mountain of patches they place him under arrest stripped them of the rank put them on the same train sent them all down to Florida while they was on the train one of the White Mountain the patches looked at up to jono's Warriors he said you was right not to trust the white eye said everything he told us was a lie and he said I'll hate you as long as there's breath in my body I'll hate you so why didn't you leave us alone we were serving the Creator the way he created us this is our land our way of life why didn't you leave us alone I'll hate you as long as there's breath in my body I'll hate you one of Dono Warriors just looking at him and Dono spoke up and said do not hate him there's too few of us left to hate one another if you're not little bride it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen Abraham heard that his brother was in trouble was taking captive we might bump around a little bit in the backyard but we stand shoulder the shoulder in the front amen and when he heard he was taking captive he went and got him Abraham's men they they weren't Farmers they weren't Warriors 318 men 318 Farmers with pitchforks and rases went down after these kings that held lot and his family now what think about that's on almost Insanity that's almost suicide why would 318 Farmers being led by Abraham go up against a bunch of kings and their armies and you know if they Kings they've got an army they've got Shields and Spears and horses and helmets and a well equipped Army what made Abraham so sure he can win this battle he look so he looked like the underdog who would have Vegas bed on the kings are Abraham and why would he go up why would he take why would he do that because Abra glory to God Abraham had a revelation that God had given him the land and land and all that was in it Bel on to him amen and he acted on his belief that what God Said was true he acted on the word of God hallelujah he went up against those kings believing what God said about it amen God could tell Abraham he knew he was an air to all the land because he knew Abraham would believe him amen it's time we act on what we say we believe well I believe the message the devil believes the message come on you got it's more than that somebody how do we know Noah believed God's message when he said it's going to rain how do we know Noah believed that the boat is the evidence how will we know that you believe the message when you act on what the prophet said amen amen he was a possessor of the Gate of his enemies why because God said so he wasn't relying on 318 Farmers with pitchforks he wasn't trust he wasn't trusting in their ability he wasn't trusting in their military training they didn't have anything but he was trusting in The God Who made the promise and I'm not here this morning I'm not trusting in my ability I'm not but I'm trusting in The God Who made the promise to me amen he said I'll never leave you he said I'd never forsake you Abraham when I his nephew he went after what belonged to him because he was a possessor of all that was in the land yeah Abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his yet he had to fight to possess it there you are the believer today yet we're AES to all things we're HS to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises you have to fight for every in of it even though it's yours we have to fight like for every inch of it then I say this is the day we need to declare war that's God's way that's the way he's got it set up the prop said it's always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own you have to fight to possess it and that's what we have to do then if that's what they have to do then God give us strength to fight to possess what we already own then let the fight start how if we if we've got the fight then let the fight start are professing what it is we possessing you got to remember the ABCs ABC is to accept believe and confess before you can ever receive any blessing even though it's yours you must first accept it yeah that's right you see if I said I've got a $100 bill in my pocket now I don't but if I did if I had a $100 bill pocket I said whoever wants it come up here and get it it's yours I can say that all day if you all just set there I'll keep $100 bill but if somebody believes me it will get up it's yours but first you've got to accept it believe it and then confess it what does it do to confess it the prophet said your body will obey your confession I wonder sometimes that we have such a hard time in life because we're always talking negative everything's negative Wy Wy me come on somebody this is going to happen and that's going to happen and I've got the worst luck in the world you're just speaking the devil's language it's time you say what God Said Amen Hallelujah let the fight start by professing what it is that we possess what the word says is ours amen hallelujah amen Abraham returned from the slaughter of the Kings he went he slaughtered him and the king of Solomon told him he said take the SPs and Abraham said I'll not take from Fred the sulat he didn't fight the war to make a lot of money right and the real true battles are not made with selfish motives but we're living in such a time that selfishness controls everything we are living in a selfish age brother said it'll come to pass that self-love will take the place of the true love of God and that's how really it's true for us if you don't believe it you you can't make this stuff up a woman down in Texas married herself had a cake had a preacher had a bridal party just didn't have a groom married herself because she said I can find nobody that loves me as much as I love me in 2013 a word was picked to represent the entire world every year I think it's Oxford dictionary or something picks one word for the west and one word for the East that Bo describes what the people are thinking what's in their lives and I think it was 2013 they chose one word to represent the entire world you know what it was selfie selfie amen like the little brother was talking there this morning that's why they cut around you 90 M hour and then turn off in front of you because they think they're more important than you are well preach I think y believe will amen but they're not fault for selfish motives true battles are not fought for selfish motives men fight War for principles and when Abraham went to get lot he didn't go out there because he knew he could whoop the Kings and take all that they possessed he went after for the principle of saving his brother and any Minister that's sent out under the inspiration of the king of heaven will not go for money neither will he go to make big churches or inspired denominations he'll go for one principle that's to bring back that Fallen brother and I say this morning I've come to this service with this principle to war against the devil not to get a name not for popularity I'm not interested in that but to get my Fallen brother the one that Satan has tied down and say loose him Satan and let him [Applause] go you see Satan don't care he don't care if you see your prison house he don't care if you see your prison door matter of fact he wants you to see your prison door but what he don't want you to see is that that door is open he'll tell you there's no way out and I'm trying to tell you the doors open when Jesus died at Calvary every every gate in Hell came open amen he said he said he said I could go free amen Solomon said there's a Time For Peace and there's a time for war amen there's nothing wrong with fighting if you're fighting for the right principle well that's a quote said I was reading at Tombstone the other day the museum saw the picture of Dono so many of you think Dono was a renegade but to me he was a genuine American he was only fighting for that which was right that God had given him a land and a nation and a place to live said I don't blame him I don't blame him and those white soldiers come in there by force over take over the land killing them out like a bunch of flies and that was the original picture of gono's medical headquarters or his hospital it was two or three blankets over a piece of miske and then wounded American Indians fighting for the God given rights that J with a baby of his own on his ships standing there looking about his own Warriors bleeding and dying with no penicillum or none of them no way to help him genuine god-given American then you call him a renegade I call him a gentleman fighting for something that God had give him a land and a nation and a place to live we're not Waring for a selfish motive but Satan took something that belongs to us and I said let's go get it back amen it's time for the seat of Abraham to rise up and get back declare war on all hell and its demons well the devil's been after me all week I say it's time we go after [Applause] him you need to tell him This Means War you need to let the Dev know you can't have my increase you can't have my family you can't have my health This Means War brother B said the American Indian lost this land because they were divided among themselves and that's always Satan's tactic is to divide and conquer but I say do not let him divide us we are one you've seen what they tried to do they tried to divide us over race they've tried to divide us over vaccinations come on somebody you know it's the truth try to divide us over politics huh try to divide us over doctrines but I say we're one amen just because I may not see something you don't see don't mean I won't see it tomorrow just pray for [Applause] me amen it's always if he can keep you divided as long as you're divided there's no Unity amen but I say see let's unite ourselves together on what brother darl what are we going to unite on on the Promises of the word not my idea not your idea but what the word says amen we are the seat of a through the promise that God swore to Abraham that thy seat shall possess the Gate of his enemy he said brother B I need healing the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't going get it easy I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health but you got a right to go to Satan and say give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord let me tell you something the devil well knows that the name of Jesus binds him there's power in the name of Jesus Amen give it back Satan you took my child got to mixed up with the wrong boy took my boy mixed him up with the wrong girl but I claimed them that's right I claimed my children I claimed my brother I claimed my sister took them from God's house you coax them out there but I'm coming after them I'm claiming them you know what going to work because I'm an heir I'm an heir of all things it's given to me I'm an heir and a joint Heir with Jesus Christ you know what that means there's a difference between an air and being a join a oh yeah you see an air would be like this say our daddy dies and we go for the reading of the wheel and daddy gives brother Bower the Farm Brother B Just Smiles he got the F get brother Brad the Cadillac with the spinning hubcaps daddy gave me a goat am I in air I'm an air but there something bad wrong with me and Daddy I even have to get permission for brother B to feed my goat but you see that's different between an air and a joint air a joint air shares in The Inheritance together that what you say what are you saying I'm simply saying this that whatever God gave Jesus that's what he gave [Applause] you Hallelujah the same Holy Ghost he got up the river it's the same Holy Ghost brother bam God that brother father God that's your mama God that's your daddy God there's not one Holy Ghost for a prophet and one Holy Ghost come on somebody there's one Holy Ghost and God gave it to all of us hallelujah we're Joy there as we share in The Inheritance together I can claim everything that God promised me I can claim my health I can claim my victory I can claim a Revival I can claim it I'm a possessor of it amen I heard a story the other day I thought it was so good that

2 Genesis 22617 he said thy seed shall possess the Gate of his iny he said now see the natural Seed of Abraham was Isaac so through Isaac the seed of Isaac we find out that they did possess the Gate of their enemies the natural seat of Abra it's recorded right here in the Bible that they did possess the gate other enemy exactly like God said why because God said so and the natural always tops the spiritual and said God's given every sick person in here Divine Healing every one of you Jesus was wounded for our transgressions with the stps we were healed it's yours but you'll fight to possess for every inch of it is your possession everywhere The Souls of your feet travel God told Joshua I've giving you Footprints it means possession he said let's move in tonight amen let's go in

of charlet airport the other day flying somewhere to preach we had to sit on the runway out there before we took off about 20 minutes because it was raining so hard and we took off out there that plane was shaking and a rattling and a rolling and a dropping and all through them clouds I thought oh my God but in a few minutes we popped through the clouds and when we did guess what amen the Sun was shining the Sun was shining and always was shining you just have to don't see well well brother looks don't we don't look with the eyes of our head we see with the eyes of our heart amen we look to the Unseen it's the Unseen things that are real B say you have a meeting like this this morning we have a meeting and the Holy Ghost falling and the people screaming shouting praising the Lord someone come and say pray for me brother bam and I lay hands on him and pray for him I said now go and believe now here's what it is see it's easy to feel the power of God to see when you believe but then when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess think that brother see we've got to get that we've got to take it it's ours but we fight for every inch can we possess what we profess and profess what we possess amen amen every inch of the ground Joshua walked on was his amen he had a promise from God he said I give it to you whether there giants it don't matter atheists Giants infidels co- formal churches what difference does it make God gave the promise let's take it it's ours it belongs it's our possession let's go get it don't be afraid don't well I don't know if it'll never work with that kind of attitude it'll never that's hybrid Faith hybrid Faith produces confusion amen don't do that if God said it believe it he gave you the promise cuz he knew you would believe him believe him let's take the land it's ours de Clare War Satan go get back what he stoed from you amen the Hebrew children look at them in the natural they possessed the Gate of the fiery furnace they couldn't even burn them now the king got so mad at them that the Bible said he heated up the I'm not going too long with that he heated up the furnace said he was so mad he almost went well he did go he went insane because he had his own men thr these guys in the fire and the fire killed his men he was so mad at these Hebrew boys he killed his own men trying to kill them and let me say Satan will destroy his own kingdom trying to stop this bride but he will never stop this bride [Applause] never but here's the great thing they possessed the went in there believing what God had told their father Abraham that they would possess the Gate of the enemy but here's the great thing about it you see God never took the fire out of the furnace he never did I'm sorry I didn't know you didn't know that he said how could you say that because you see if he was done mad enough to heat it up seven times harder than it ever been heated and he looked in there and seen it was out what do you think he would have done it but when he looked in there it was still burning yeah but what God did God didn't take the fire out of the furnace oh God he took the heat out of the [Applause] fire hallelujah amen I couldn't even burn him Daniel possessed the enemy's Gates the Li's mouth they couldn't even open their mouth to eat him now these lies they ate humans before and when they saw that Daniel was in that den and no way out it was a Happy Meal yum gums here he comes where you going to go now they said a line can roar I don't know if you know this or not but a lion's roar can be heard five miles away wow that's probably from here almost to Elon I guess ain't it five miles a line's Roar is between H4 decimals is a roar of a line the human ear is physically damaged at 120 decimal so a line's Roar is almost loud enough to give you hearing loss can be heard five miles away and when that line saw Daniel with no way to go he just gave out one of them good Five Mile Roars but what happened he didn't realized that the man standing there possessed the Gate of the enemy that when he tried to give a f mile Roar all came out was meow meow he shut the Li's mouth amen let me tell you he shut the Devil's Mouth amen Samson one time had a bunch of people had him fenced in and the prophet God said those Gates weighed eight tons a piece I believe it was now the prophet said that Samson was a mama's boy a shrimp that's what he said now I worked in surgery for years and I actually done surgery on people who come in who picked up a wheelbarrow of bricks working construction and they pick up a wheelbarrow of bricks and they rip this muscle loose from the bone they have to come in and they take a big 1050 staple open it up take that put back the bone Wham hit it put it back to the Bone let it heal up just for picking up Bricks now here's a mama's boy who picked up two gates that weighed 8 tons a piece it should have ripped every muscle that boy had out of his body but it didn't and he ripped up those Gates packed them I forget how many miles it was up on a hill and Sh him down and he looked at him said hey you want your Gates come up here and get them how could he do that How could a mama's boy make such a statement how could he lift up those Gates like that he had a promise from God that thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy and all these fine Warriors in the faith they all died but I'm thinking of another seed this morning one called Jesus Christ The Royal Sea he took all the gates of the enemy took the gates of sickness he took that that could not exist in his presence neither could anything else exist in his presence a funeral possession could not EX stand in his presence what did he do Joshua died Moses died all the rest of them died bu this Royal seed death could not stand where life was Hallelujah he raised that woman's boy from the dead he gave tyrus's daughter back to him he raised Lazarus from the dead even his sister said Lord he stinks his nose has done Cav in but he stood there and said Lazar come for amen Oh Glory to God he broke the seals of everything his precious Soul descended into hell where I ought to went but on that third day s took the gates of the city on his back had nothing to do with this he took the Gate of Hell the Gate of the grave and everything else he didn't pack it up on the mountain but he destroyed it he possessed the Gate of the enemy the atmosphere that was filled with Devil's power above that Angels or nothing else could come down there could be no intercession because the blood of goats would not would not take away sin but his own blood took away our sins and he ascended up on high leg captivity captive gave gifts and the men now everyone of Abraham's seed is there anybody here like that everyone of Abraham's seed that's willing to pay the price and be repent of their sins be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and be filled with the Holy Ghost and stand the test shall be an overcomer in this hour he possessed every gate the Gate of sickness the Gate of death the Gate of Hell the Gate of Temptation the Gate of the Grave he possessed every gate and freely gives it to us and makes us more than conquerors through him that loved us and gave himself for us This Means War we need to start professing what it is we possess you need to tell Satan this morning hey you're under my feet every devil is under our feet amen well brother darl that's really good but you know I'm just the least of the least of the I'm just that skin on the little toe right there right there where it rocks to the foot that little crease that that's me right there that's the part of the body I am well that may be absolutely true I'm not doubting that but even that's who you are even if that's who you are every devil is still under your feet [Applause] amen hallelujah he's under my feet amen hallelujah shamard he could say I'm the Seed of Abraham shamard could think that way being the natural seed what all we be tonight what all we be this morning as the Royal Seed of Abraham amen the Royal Seed of Abraham the church is the Royal promised seed and if the natural seed could take that much courage what off the Royal seed do with the presence of the Holy Ghost just anointing around us showing himself has he not shown himself Among Us [Music] friends yes I was in a meeting a few years ago at the byc camp brother James Tidwell was up there had a cancer in his ear been there for three years scab over and bleed scab over and Bleed Just he said he was

went to the doctor he cut a host of Big he could read the Constitution through it I got a terrible scar right there today but you see that's the difference between God and man man can cut out of cancer leave a scar God can take a cancer Le most SC Hallelujah I was in Cottonwood Arizona woman sitting there had a tumor on her chest it was a ooz and tumor was putting sa on it and that night in the service we just started testifying some of the things about like we're doing right now that we've seen the Lord do she started praising the Lord just thanking him for healing this one thanking him for doing that never even come up for for prayer she goes home takes her blouse off to put ointment on this place that was on her chest and it was gone it disappeared during the service I was in Pennsylvania sister named Betty sister Betty had Goma and she came up for prayer and the saints of God prayed for her she used to go Monday for an eye specialist to see about the glycom her eyes were so citu she had to have sunglasses on to be in the church because the lights are in her eyes she came up for prayer the same prayed for her she goes to the doctor on Monday the doctor examines her eyes he said whoever sits you here needs their eyes examined there ain't nothing wrong with the eyes don't you tell me he can't do it we've seen him do it he showed himself Among Us amen I was sharing it at Brother Rich CS in Oregon there's a man sitting there with cataracts on his eyes he said God if you can do that for sister Betty's eyes you could touch my eyes and the cataracts fell off of his eyes there's nothing that our God cannot do my daughter was blinded from an accident they said she' never see again but God provided a lamb for her eyes and one day against every doctor the M CT skin her eyes came open and today CC's better than me don't you tell me he can't do it showing himself alive showing himself Among Us making himself the same yesterday today and forever and saying take courage take courage you're the bride of Christ we may not rich in good world's Goods but we possess all things amen amen possessor of the Earth the believer has a title abstract Deed by Jesus Christ that he shall be possessor of the entire universe the meek shall inherit the earth he said well God promised Abraham that's good brother Daryl we've promised you too you're the seat of Abraham if you're in Christ you're the seat of Abraham and every promise to Abraham is into you do you love him this morning do you believe him this morning oh my don't be afraid to possess what belongs to you shamard was just a farmer and every year they'd come in and slap him around leave him with just enough crops you know what he was doing he was feeding his enemy and I'm convinced many times with our negative talk and our negative attitude and the way we live we don't pray like we should don't read like we should just come to church and wonder how long it's going to [Applause] be oh friend there's more than that there's more than that amen just leave him enough he's feeding his enemy just enough to feed his many and I'm convinced that many times with our negative talking there all we're doing is feeding our enemy and one day it's the Harvest Time here they come just like they come every time here they come but this time what they failed to realize there's another seed had come to maturity there's another seed it's time you realize who you are you see Amnesia if you don't know who you are Amnesia feeds fear anybody that's worked in the nurs home with Alzheimer's patients you know they're scared sometimes they're very violent you know why because they don't know nothing they don't know who they don't know who they are and everything so they fight it's like a self-defense mechanism and then finally the Alzheimer kicks into the point that they even forget how to fear some times they just become cuddly babies you know is that my telling brother you see how long as you don't know who you are then you're scared to death to do anything but knowing who you are brother B said Jesus had perfect Faith because he knew who he was in the word and when you know who you are you don't have to back up to [Applause] nobody when you got the blood work you got the DNA you can stand and say I'm part of Native American they say you don't look it don't care if I look it or not got nothing to do it's what the blood says that's what the blood says oh hallelujah it's what the blood says amen the blood says we're Victorious amen he that de samard said it ain't right this is my
