that's right and this song dad loved to sing this song and i thought we would sing it together this morning jesus signed my pardon this song always meant a lot to me and meant a lot to my dad and our family and and i was thinking of him this morning and the life that he lived in front of us and just to just miss him a whole lot but you know if i could see him this morning i wouldn't want him to come back i didn't have to go through with maybe what he had to go through again so we'll just look forward to joining them this morning jesus signed my pardon this morning amen well i was in sin prison a stand-alone so dark and cold and like a lost sheep wandering from god's eternal foe then the doors rang open and jesus spoke to me i have signed your pardon well you may now go free oh jesus signed my pardon oh this i surely know well he took my place at calvary now i won't have to go and all my life i give to him he gave it all for me when he signed my pardon there at calvary and when

my pardon well this i surely know he took my place on calvary now i won't have to go all my life i give to him he gave it all for me and when he signed my pardon there at calvary well life is now

want to be careful and i do appreciate those who made that sacrifice to be careful and try to make sure that amen that we are especially those who are vulnerable amen our elderly and different ones that we try not to get anybody infected and i thank the lord here amen that he has a really we've had a very low count by god's grace maybe just one or one or two one i guess so amen i know brother stephen i guess was diagnosed with it but um anyway so we thank the lord for his protecting hand upon us so god is good amen well let's just give the lord a hand say thank you lord jesus amen thank you lord amen certainly thank the lord for good health if i think any of us that are a little bit older realize that being healthy is a very very valuable thing in this world amen amen and have good health so god bless you this morning amen i can't think of any other announcements other than we do want to have a baptismal this morning we're thankful that katie wade has felt in her heart amen i guess she's way back up there so that she really must be baptized in the name of the lord and she's about that age amen that it's nice to see the lord tugging on her on our on their hearts amen when they get about that age they do and so praise the lord so we'll have a baptism after a little bit amen let's just bow our heads go before the lord in prayer kind heavenly father we come before you lord once again lord so grateful to serve a wonderful great god like you lord and lord hearing your prophet speak yesterday and how did he said it was just a such a privilege and such an honor to be able to get up in front of people and to share how he feels about you lord and i believe that's what we're doing this morning we're just sharing with people how we feel about you and how that we just love to talk about you and to open up your word and and to glorify your name lord jesus it's just so great lord we don't we don't know how to express even as he said we don't know how to express in english words to thank you enough and to give you praise enough lord for what you mean to us lord so lord jesus we just open up our hearts to you and say thank you lord jesus for all that you do for us every day all day lord we realize without you we could do nothing and without you we would have nothing lord and lord we just thank you god we know that you made all things created everything that was made lord including our breath father and we thank you for that lord and we thank you for the assurance lord jesus that one of these days lord if time would tarry god if any of us would go by the way of the grave when we lord take that last breath we also have an assurance of joy father knowing god that you've prepared a place over there for us god that we don't have to fear death we don't have to worry about what's over there for we already have been shown what is over there lord and we know there's a wonderful land just beyond the river god and we look forward lord jesus god when you're going to clean this world up father and we're going to come back lord jesus upon this earth lord to dwell where there is righteousness and holiness where there's now one evil thing upon the face of the earth lord and we have assembled ourselves together this morning to prepare for that time and for that place and we ask god that you just bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart lord and father as we speak on you father we ask god that you'd be the speaker say what you want said lord keep us from saying anything we shouldn't father and come down in a special way and anoint each one with your presence father and may we be able to go from this place this morning being able to say did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way for we ask these blessings in jesus name amen and amen turn if you turn your bibles if you will and i want to just i was just just praying what the lord wanted me to speak on and this thought came to my mind and that was uh flashing red light signs flashing red light signs and i think all of you all know the message brother brandon preached on the flashing red light sign of his coming in them right so brother branham back then he looked at it amen and seen that it was a flashing light saying he's about ready to come amen and certainly how many knows that as the days and as the years roll on amen that it's just makes it so much more true and it just brings us so much more closer to that time the great time that lays ahead who's looking for that time amen so god bless you let's turn our bibles to the book of matthew matthew the 24th chapter and verse 32 a very familiar scripture for us now learn the parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth his leaves you know that summer is nice so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all the things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so also the coming of the son of man be two shall be in a field the one shall be taken and the other one left two women shall be grinding at the meal the one shall be taken and the other one left watch therefore for no for ye know not what our the lord doth come amen god bless the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen i want to talk a little with the help of the lord about the days of noah amen and now over in saint luke all right saint luke and i might just pick this up again saint luke bearing record of what jesus said he put it this way because he added he added just a little something there in luke 17. and i do have several scriptures to read this morning so y'all bear with me if you would luke 17 and verse 26 luke said he says and as it was in the days of noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man all right and then he says they married the given in marriage until noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all and notice here he adds this in he says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did he they drank they bought this old planet to marry i mean they built it but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed i'm going to read another one in luke 21st chapter verse 25 luke 21 it talks about the signs how that there's going to be signs and then i truly believe that there's ever a time and never a people that should be watching these signs it should be us don't you think because jesus said watch watch watch watch in that right be careful watch there'll be signs there'll be all kinds of things that tell you kind of what hour that you're living in where you're at amen and towards the end of the service hopefully i want to kind of talk to you a little bit about just something that was kind of quickened to me here even in the last few days of another sign one of the signs that i think is certainly a real sign to us that we're close amen and i'll i'll get to that here in a little bit but here in chapter 21 verse 25 it says and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of the heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory now notice he says that they'll see him coming in a cloud with power and great glory i'm not a prophet so i'm not here to interpret the word but if you notice how many knows that he did come in the cloud he made that arizona cloud he became in the cloud and he certainly did come with great power amen and great glory because notice here it says then after that after he comes with the power and that great glory and when you and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh how many believe the cloud has come and so forth amen the great power god has come in great power he says then do what then lift up your heads man for your redemption draweth night brother ben you know he made a statement about always being preaching on the resurrection the resurrection the resurrection i always meant a lot to him you know and i don't think you can much separate the resurrection from the coming of the lord because it's at that time the resurrection takes place i mean how many knows right at the time that the resurrection place is when our lord returns amen sure amen because he'll come and the dead and christ shall rise first the trump shall sound amen and we'll meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord so to me it doesn't matter and i seem to talk about this a lot and and preach on it a lot about the coming of the lord but i do believe that it is our when we certainly need to keep our heads looking in the right direction how many believes it's easy to get caught up nowadays amen to get to get your get your eyes focused on other things get your head to where it's not looking up because it says when you begin to see these signs when you begin to see all these distress between the nations amen that's one of the signs and that when you see the nation's distress and when have we ever had such a distress between the nations even amongst our allies and so forth amen there's a lot of stress a lot of friction that goes on a lot of stress between the nature we see this distress that's upon the earth distress upon the nations upon the people now we could probably sit here and we could probably go with about 50 different finds all right we could probably talk about a lot of different ones we won't cover uh you know you know a lot of them but we'll cover just what we feel led of the lord this morning to talk about amen and i want to talk a little bit about the days of noah but uh i truly believe that for you i don't know about you but i truly believe it is a time that we look up and that we watch the signs around us of what's going on amen and as you and i know we realize that our lives are changing because the times are changing and amen and there's probably things that will never go back to normal amen it'll never go back to the way that it was amen there's a lot of things that won't go back you know because we're going on down and aiming it's coming and it's winding up amen so let me just say this not just maybe perhaps make a quick statement and that is that the one of the signs amen of humanity one of their signs is that we as human beings people without the holy ghost how many knows they're really natural they're just brute beasts amen and so you know humanity brother bam he makes a statement he talks about how that uh man he says god don't destroy man man destroys himself how many knows that he actually destroys himself god don't have to do it man does that all by himself listen he says brother baby says and may i stop here just a minute to say i believe that the people are in preparation for the last great destruction this this world that it has ever known i believe we're at the end amen you can speak to people you can put billy graham in every city in the united states they'd drink wispy and smoke cigarettes and laughed at you and everything else just the same he says they are in the spirit of the last days amen now let me just stop there let me finish let me finish the quote and god cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit of destruction all right because we know that before when when god you know when god does destroy this place when god finally does his throne when the destruction actually comes we all know that it is going to be completely unimaginable horrific terrible is that right even the california earthquake i believe brother brown says that when that goes down people will die like rats amen we're talking and not so much to perhaps all the sinners and the homosexuals we know they got it coming but what about all of those little children huh what about all the babies what about all the children that'll go along with it amen it'll be something that that's something that you can't imagine it'll be catastrophic it'll be universal it'll be world over when it actually comes and we are seeing that it's getting in ambition how many believe that people are getting into the spirit to where they're fit for destruction in other words they're getting fit for destruction brother brahma said said they were getting in the spirit of destruction amen they're getting ready for destruction they're reaching that place they're coming to that place to where god finally will say that's enough that's it amen and we also already know how many knows that we've had we've had a lot of uh uh close calls of uh the whole world going up into uh a nuclear war and it was i'm not sure if it was russia or america i think it was america one time that we put up a test missile and russia was on the highest of alert because it was going up and they thought it was coming their way but just before they retaliated they said that it veered off into a different direction but they were not ready they didn't realize what we was going to do and they said it was came real close you know many times he come real close and didn't brother ben say you know all it'll take is one man pulling that lever or whatever just one drunk or you know or somebody to come and tweet this out or the other so basically brother band says that god is the one that keeps those accidents from happening he's the one that holds it back that right he's the one in control of it because no doubt china no doubt russia no doubt we have countries that would just love to pull the trigger on us you know right but they realize that the prophet said that if they send it this way it's coming that way now how many knows that this they have enough power to have enough nukes now i don't know how many times over but it's many times over to completely annihilate and kill everybody upon the face of the earth many times over i mean they don't just have one they have thousands of those missiles from what i understand amen and you they might think you know well we'll get them we'll stop out in arizona where all those silos all we'll drop one right in there and stop no we've got to be submarines and we can sneak right up to that border and send it they've got the same they got submarines you know so you know it's it's just waiting for that time brother talked about how that man always destroys himself the first bite that he ever took off the tree of knowledge amen it got us into this place that we are now it brought death upon all of humanity when eve took of the bite of that knowledge isn't that right every single time that they take a bite off of knowledge he says they invented the gun powder then they killed a lot of people and then they invented the machine gun they killed a lot of people they invented the automobile they took another knowledge and it he says kills more people than all the wars put together and that right every time that people rely on take a bite out of that knowledge it automatically destroys man and then he says now they've got nuclear weapons they've got power amen they have adam bomb and so forth i wonder what they'll do with that amen i believe that man as a whole like i said he is self-destructive amen you let man just it all it only goes to show that man was not meant to lead himself how many believe that how many needs of leadership of the holy ghost in your life amen now i want to read noah the days of noah we want to go back here now and pick up a few thoughts here with the help of the lord all right so i never finished that quote he says you know he says and god cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit of destruction god never did destroy anything man always destroys himself amen he always destroys himself all right brings it to a place to where you know and if you remember brother bam says you know they'll still send those missiles up there one day and it'll be a mixture of nuclear power and a holy fire god's own power and it'll clean this thing up isn't that right over in janus if you will genesis 6 let's read the instant of the days of noah because jesus said like it was there that's what it's going to be like here amen before the lord returns so genesis six and verse one and it came to pass when men began to multiply upon the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and it took them wives of all that they chose the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be 120. wow wow that's quite something in it that just comes to me right now you know we don't know the day or the hour but they knew the day in the hour they said it's going to be 120 years huh he gave him a time he says i'm going to give you 120 years all right so he says shall be 120 years and there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and god saw the wickedness of man that it was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart all right i'm going to stop there because he says he's going to destroy a man and so forth and go back to the first verse one thing that brother bam said when he preached his message of flashing red light excuse me he said the first first sign the first thing he said that shows you that something's fixed will take place it's the multiplication of people and he goes to talking about look he was back then he said look at how people have multiplied and places that used to be pawns and creeks and so forth in our cities and subdivisions and all that men begin to multiply upon the earth and but i'll tell you what how many knows that you all you gotta do is go on a little trip and you'll realize how how how absolutely full the highways are getting how many knows if you don't have patience you are in a lot of trouble if you're going on a trip you better have patience because you're gonna you know but you used to take you so many hours now you better figure two three hours more because you're gonna get in traffic jams amen and so it's just multiply people upon people when you get a lot of people together and then most of the time you get sin to multiply also but he talked about the multiplication of people people and the population growing and certainly we have an all-time high of population everywhere that's why again i say that when uh you know brother bam talking about a handful perhaps making the rapture maybe a couple dozen we don't know just how many but it'll just be a few few there be that find it he said there'll be just a few so the vast majority 95 percent if that if he was to say five percent would go i mean that'd be a lot of people amen and you look at 95 percent of the people all going to be destroyed kind of hard to imagine isn't it amen and you know the thing of it is the thing of it is just like it was in the days of noah is exactly what i'm doing this morning doing the very same thing that noah did before the flood came and that is to warn the people i mean it means it's happening just like it did back then and they don't think it's not going to happen to me that's why you're a real genuine christian full of the holy ghost you do think it's not gonna happen to me because i'm not gonna let it happen to me because i want to serve the lord with all of my heart i'm gonna do whatever it takes to be ready that's what a christian thinks but another slothful type of person they think that it isn't going to happen they live on the slothful life amen and just a lukewarm life isn't that right and guess what they don't know it and they don't really realize it until it comes upon them naturally believe as you do also that these things are coming upon us the time is drawing i the time has come the time is coming it is drawing really close every single year that goes by that generation that jesus promised would not pass gets older amen gets closer every time amen but if you'll notice here then he says the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair brother bam says you ain't never seen so many pretty women as you have nowadays amen if they do it you can take an ugly woman and you can grab me a big old paint bucket and hey man you can begin to paint on her face and when they get done she looks like a you know a star that's absolutely the truth that can paint you up that's why brother baby says they got max factor they got all of that amen they can sure make them look good but you wash that stuff off and you're going to wake up and you're going to be scared i didn't know it looked like that hey the devil and but you know even that even that we realize that butterbaum says just naturally speaking there truly is a lot more prettier women than what there was back then pearl o'brien in comparison he says you take any normal high school girl and then she's a lot prettier than she is and we're living in an age when the sons of god notice brethren since the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were pretty and how didn't how many knows but abram says that a pretty woman amen is a bigger trap than all the bootleg joints that there is it's a bigger snare amen if the devil uses them it is his number one tool to get the sons of god to fall amen and god help us man god never but about says that god never did forgive him for oh my lord help us but that's the age we're living in isn't that right that the devil is using that in such a great magnitude amen he has yes man i'll tell you what you can't go to walmart you can't go anywhere anymore hardly without having to face it amen i'll tell you what this stuff that they have on the internet and everything all of that that should never be legal never be legal why it only destroys good people that's what it does amen but that's another thing the beauty of women brother bam says is the sign amen of the end times and then marriage the other thing he said another sign was marriage and divorce people are marrying and given in marriage he said they're taken unto themselves wives they're not even getting married to them having children behind them everything else amen so debates divorce rate he says look at the divorce rate amen and people amen uh you know not being faithful to their wives and so forth he had to have a great increase in that and that also shows that we're living close to the end honey believes god has to absolutely all these things have to be recompensed all of these things have to be paid for amen you can't sin and get by you can't do wrong and not expect to have to pay for it and that's what the world is doing praise the lord i was thinking back there and how that brother bab says that when even when the prophet comes on the scene it is a jaw a sign that judgment is about to happen when god sends a prophet know this that judgment is fixing to happen he says it's always so sad that god will send a prophet and just but just the elected catch it i thought how sad that is that you think about just a small group of all of humanity amen that actually catch amen god speaking through that the rest of them don't even know it they don't even believe it they go on into chaos amen hearing a prophet knowing that god sent us a prophet it tells you that i am the son of god i am the daughter of god i know who i am i know where i come from and i know where i'm going and that is so good to know because all those that don't catch the prophet amen that they don't catch that sign everybody doesn't they all begin to think that they come from monkeys i don't know about you but i would really not be too happy amen living in a world where you think you come from a monkey is your forefather huh i don't know about you but they're acting like a bunch of monkeys how many knows that i read the other day where brown i'll forget exactly what he said but something to the extent that one day when they took prayer out of school amen it was a big victory for the devil and that ain't nothing but the truth would they take bible to take with all of these things out of school amen it was a victory with some devil coming in coming in coming in coming in how many believe that everything that you're seeing is a swamp amen it's the swamp of the devil coming in like a flood it's coming in like a flood and i'll tell you what there ain't no political there ain't no trump there ain't nobody never gonna stop it no no they're just small little players in this scene because god sets up who he wants to and he brings down who he wants to amen god said he's in control of all that praise be to god it isn't going to stop this flood it isn't going to stop this wave that's coming in i'm just so grateful you ought to be the happiest person in the earth to know that you're not part of that flood but you're part of the standard that god raises up against it praise be to god another sign of the end time according to revelation 3 in around 20 says and they will be blind and naked and wretched and not know it amen brother bam says after discernment and so forth he says you know people will absolutely call it mental empathy amen people that are christians pentecostals and people who have had 2 000 years of experience of what they should know what the lord is and there it comes right in front of them and then they see it with their eyes they hear it with their ears and then they absolutely reject it he says there's no wonder damnation is in front of us no wonder doom is in front of us because people are so blind amen the blindness of people amen is a sign of the time they shall be blind huh the blindness of the people there's another big sign so blind but baby says dear willfully blind let me think just think about it what if brother branham was up here amen we know that god honors his prayers that's one thing we gotta all admit that's what i want brother bran and praying for me because god honors his prayers amen and when he'd be here now and preaching to us same message amen think of think of the kind of people we would be perhaps huh if any of us is lukewarm and we see the signs we see the discernments we see people getting healed and so forth how many would say i wouldn't be the person that i am don't have to raise your hand because i'm fixing to tell you something think about it well i'd be different than you ain't then you ain't what you ought to be because i don't have to see it again i already heard it i believe it anyway i know it's true i believe god just as much this morning i believe that if brother paul was here if god was doing it through his prophet i believe that message just as much i'd be out there i'd be saying amen preach it brother let him preach it i believe it that ain't nothing but the truth huh amen but that's what i'm saying amen it ought to be just as real to every last one of us that god amen has spoken in this generation praise the lord it's still the same i don't have to i god already came and he already showed the sign praise the lord how many knows he was assigned like as it was in the days of lot and then we've had the same sign of this generation oh but it says like like like with solomon he says man what if everybody what if everybody would accept the gift that god has sent to this generation you would have a millennium you would have a golden age like they did with solomon what a golden age what a golden age you would be but when people reject it there's nothing left but damnation and that's what the church world did that's why we're in a condition that we're in it's because the church world hello the moon packed out the sun like they put him out that's why the conditions are they are in amen but it was meant to be he was supposed to be god knew it would be that way because man they can see things with their eyes huh they can hear with their ears and they still say no my church don't teach that my church don't teach that you willfully blind yourself i don't want to hear it no more all that preachers on the back road but the man began to say you know that angel came to me and he says don't drink or smoke oh there they go he said he couldn't even finish his testimony like paul did i was struck down on the road to damascus and here i am to say like paul that god did something for me god told me not to do this out of the other forever work for see y'all you don't want to hear about the work huh but you want to give god you want god to give you entrance when you get over there huh i don't think that's going to happen no willfully talked were turned away and then at the end of it all prophet of god didn't barely have a place to go just like jesus didn't barely have a place to go they crucified him or the end of jesus ministry was terrible according to man even all of his disciples scattered and left him hid themselves left they took him up and killed him and them disciples were absolutely in agony thinking their whole thing had fallen apart but they hadn't caught the vision amen and he says destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it back up [Laughter] who raised god up who raised jesus up god right and jesus said if i remember right my scripture says he don't say my father raised me up he says in the eye we'll raise it up made himself god because he was nonetheless amen and i will raise it up again but the blindness let me bring you that up the blindness of people shows the hour that we're living and people will be absolutely blind and what else goes along with this blindness what causes people what causes you what causes me to become lukewarm and blind it's the lukewarmness that you get people get lukewarm not hot for god and i'll tell you the second you don't have your prayer life like you ought to your eyes begin to dim up they begin to fog over and you begin to think your bank account's more important than churches huh people get dollar signs in the front of their eyes and all they see is dollar signs dollars changing changing is all people see anymore instead of the rapture coming of the lord amen so many folks are building hopes down here planning ahead they forgot what jesus said amen and i'll tell you what this is what i thought about you know what we need to be doing what am i doing what can you tell me what i'm doing acting crazy like bodybuilder always does you're working down here you're working every day you got to make a living but you better keep your head up you better keep looking up better lift up your heads yeah you gotta plant your potatoes now you gotta do the work but you better keep your eyes up there oh my because we realize catholics are going to pay off that debt huh they can pay it off then who's going to have control huh it will take a beast it will take somebody that don't mind burning you at the sick chopping your head off killing you in any way that they think about it'll take that kind of a devil to keep these beasts under control and remember that's what america's 13th chapter is exercised all the power of the first beast amen that's right it'll take that because this is how terrible this world is getting shall we go on a little further here janice again so it says here god saw the wickedness of man that it was constantly evil isn't that bad what it is all people think about they don't never really think about their their god that made it they don't think about holiness or right everything's always evil i always got their minds on evil things constantly evil constantly wicked we can look at the multiplication and the constant wickedness in the world and i'm here to tell you god is long suffering how many knows in the days of noah he let them people get so bad he let solomon saddam and gamora get so bad that if you as a man that was not a homosexual they would come after you and they try to make you a homosexual i mean as a homosexual agenda is very they're very much uh into promoting their colors i don't know you teachers might know but uh teaching some kind of an alternative lifestyle in school is that what that's all about if it is it ain't nothing but the lowest bunch of mess you ever saw in your life alternative they can teach theirs but we can't teach the bible and righteousness and holiness that'll make good people out of people huh i i you know now just this is a little political but i read a quote where brother brown says now they're trying to pass in congress to where you can't shout sing in church you can't shout they want to outlaw it in congress that you can't shout in church and i thought well that ain't so much different than our people telling hey you can't sing in church if i'm good enough to go to church i'm good enough to see it come on come on folks can i get a little amen it's all right amen they won't let him go to church but not sing amen you know the very next step is don't go to church now they pushed that pretty hard but they got a lot of pushback on that huh people gonna go to church even though the one church is gonna have to be fine 20 000 for going to church hey i don't mind going to jail for going to church amen i don't now y'all know who i stand i don't believe in i believe in the middle of the road huh i've tried to practice the middle of the road with all of this i think we should be careful that's common sense isn't that right but still amen to tell us we can't sing i'm like wow but i just like i've seen that i said i didn't know brother brown had actually said that but yes he's they said they want to outlaw this screaming and shouting and singing and stuff you know they don't want none of that around why because they're lukewarm but they don't want to have any of that amen how many knows when they get over yesterday well they're not gonna but anyway if they didn't get overhanded it'd be an awful terrible uncomfortable place praise the lord let me go on so now noticing god saw the wickedness of man that it was great upon the earth and that every imagination of his thought and his of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on earth and it grieved him at his heart amen and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creepy thing the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them how many knows god has feelings i heard about what i'm saying the other day in foreign fields some of those people would run through their the guards and everything and just dive through him and and try to get to the altar and try to get paid for and he says you know and you can't have that i hope you can't have that because if you've got chaos the holy spirit is not in chaos how many knows the devil dwells in chaos his brother says god is sensitive you have to have things done decently and in order god is sensitive he had some feelings and he was repentant at his heart god was like why did i even make man amen let me just make a statement man without the holy ghost left to himself always goes to the worst of evil amen just like hitler i might make a statement that without the holy ghost if you wasted under the right conditions you would probably be a hitler too you'd say you'd never do that don't underestimate the power of the evil that is in the heart when the holy spirit isn't there to control you to guide you to lead you amen i'm thankful for the holy spirit leadership i thank god for his leadership amen now before i go to my ending thought i want to go to a couple more scriptures would that be all right let's go to ii timothy if you would how many believes that even in today's world there's a great falling away even amongst message people there is a falling away brother banham in his time the holy spirit quickened to him one time and showed him the reason why there was people that was going out and claiming they had blood coming out of their hands and there was healing in it and oils and these different gimmicks you know and the holy spirit took in the second tim or first timothy i'm sorry first timothy 4 he says now the spirit ex speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron brother bam says they'll leave all right the faith and give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils and that people would not endure sound doctrine anymore but they would heap to themselves teachers having itching ears isn't that right so we're living in our brothers and sisters that whenever you're on the right path whenever you're doing what god wants you to do remember any spirit because it was a very same spirit that seduced eve amen seduced her and that same spirit seduces people to shake them from their own steadfastness from their what brother brandon called a rugged everyday simple humble christian life how many believe is that what we need in every one of our lives you need to have a life that is simple that's humble that is a christian daily life amen people are not happy with stone doctrine in other words i heard that doctrine before and they get it gets old to people and they have itching ears and people want to hear something different they want something new and it gives the devil an opportunity to come in there amen and to seduce them and then to entice them to go in a different direction how many believes you got to watch that you got to watch spirits that seduce the people amen to you know they're just they're not satisfied with the old-time religion the old-time doctrines and they wanted something new and they ended up taking doctrines of devils just like in brother banham time let me tell you it was those things that they had but says you know those are not scriptural and anything that isn't scriptural scares me it ain't right it'll not come out right you're out on a limb and people that fall for that stuff amen are going to end up out there on the limb somewhere seduced by evil spirits to get you to fall from your own steadfastness amen praise be to god people are and there's notice let me go to another one real quick the other thing is in ii timothy ii timothy 3 i want you to know that it says that in the last days perilous times shall come for people will be lovers of their own selves amen people are going to be very selfish in this last hour oh my how many knows everyone wants their rights everybody wants equal rights god never did give the man and the woman equal rights huh brother braham says the biggest fake they ever made was then they let woman vote i don't know how you women feel about that but he never agreed with it i don't know why but you know this is how it is and another thing the bible says and he shall be equal with you no and he shall rule overly how many believes that a husband is the ruler of a woman of a wife how many seen the twins the two girls with two heads oh i have seen that there's a there's a good one girl one body has two heads yeah that's got to be a terrible way to live isn't that right that's the same way with the marriage or anything else that has two heads i want to go this way now i want to go that way somebody's got to decide which way we're going god didn't created them equal they were equal before the fall but brotherhood says afterwards she's not even allowed in the pulpit he's not to speak the word of god she's to be in silence follow her husband how many times easier she deceived than a man a thousand times easier deceived than the man i don't know this just comes to mind but you can convince a woman you must be able to convince a woman easier than the man huh women are easily convinced a lot of times that's a real downfall for young girls hello a little some boy come in there smarter than she is and hey he can talk to her a little bit lead her astray real quick amen that's why she needs a daddy hey man to get a stick and chase a boy off say get out of here son i'm watching over my girl huh that's right that's why that's why it's it's not god didn't make it that way and when you try to make it that way you have what chaos amen but people are selfish they're not willing to forfeit their rights amen same way with a pastor he has to be in submission he has to be subject to the word of god if he is and he ain't fit to be here everybody's supposed to be under authority that somebody the head of the woman is a man at the head of the man is christ amen and i'll tell you what if you don't want if you want chaos in this church let me come un-subject to christ teach my own thing it won't be long i'll be saying brother bran is a false prophet we need to go a different way that's exactly right they don't take the leadership of god they want to take their own leadership why because they have lifted themselves up to a place to where they thought that they knew more about it than a vindicated proven prophet of god they thought of themselves too highly amen no you're not above the prophet there ain't no pastor or anybody above a prophet amen i ain't got a right to my own thinking i want to think his thoughts i mean believes that we're a prisoner to christ this world needs a whole lot more realizing that we need to get rid of our rights forfeit our rights amen praise the lord perilous times will come when people love themselves more than anything else covetous boasters proud blasphemers and disobedient to parents how many knows most of our problems today is because of our disobedience to parents their parents didn't give them a weapon they didn't correct them that's why they are like they are today you want chaos in your house don't correct your children junior i told you to quit that huh i'd like to smack you for talking to junior like that you know why because if you as any kind of a teacher you'd have to say junior junior he'd know to look he'd go go do it quick he knows look you never had to raise your voice but you think by screaming it'll get it done no a good rod makes you be able to talk quiet just to look and all right just look he knows that look that's how it ought to be amen i should play a tape to you sometime with what brother bam said a kentucky mammy find her daughter out wrong way come back get his barrel slap and beat her up until she can't get out of bed for two weeks yep yep they counted me down visit them neighbors i heard a screaming somebody got killed over there huh what is it the county people that come out and check things like that out find the daughters got marks all over her and all tore up huh that daughter go to the door mama says go answer that door daughter people's coming to check it out you better tell him to get out of here she opens the door everybody all right we're fine here please leave our property now but nowadays we got them in under the bed with their phone calling hey mama just beat me up now right they give i'm gonna get the mama and daddy go to jail i'd go to jail one time that's right next time me and my little boys or whoever would have a little visit there would be no more phone calls after that huh that's right but anyway that's what the prophet said he says do you bring discipline if you don't teach each other the bible says beat the child with a rod spare the rod and spoil the child if thou beat him he won't quite die [Applause] he won't die oh my these kids are lifting someone's got their head down right anyway i didn't mean to go down that road but what have we got here that's right you think mom and daddy when you get older when you have a kids of your own you're going to go to your mom and dad you're going to say mommy and daddy thank you for correcting me i know now what you was doing you're trying to save my life you're trying to save my soul amen bible says something about when you correct him he says you save their soul we had a five gallon bucket two five gallon bucket paint sticks taped together that's what we had and we had on there the soul saver we wrote on there the soul saver i had in the church the morning so praise the lord the soul savior you know because you're not taught to do right folks the cha it's terrible the child doesn't know when you're going to go off when you're not he don't know what you're going to do you might clobber him over the head one time and just by half kill him and the next time you don't do nothing he don't know what to expect hey i might be able to get away with it this time he didn't hit me last time but if it's consistent he knows exactly where he is and he's happy he can run and jump and scream and not quite jump on the couch so much because he knows that's off limits right you know just where the barriers are and it makes for happier children we'd be in a happier world if they'd have kept the rod in church i mean in school if they had kept the bible in school if the preachers would have stayed in their place and listened to the prophet of god and listened to god this world would be in a good place we'd be practically in a millennium brother woody if everybody would hurt the prophet of god and done what god told them to do the good thing about the prophet god is he could preach like i and then he say all right that's part of the service of sober now let's see the lord come down and vindicate the truth amen and they always would come amen praise be to god how many believes we're following a vindicated word of god what time i'll be saying that delayed all right let me go a little further now notice disobedient to parents so that's one of the signs of the end they're not obedient anymore they're unholy oh my very good word to follow isn't it very good word no i'm and non-holy unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce boy that's a good word for them nowadays and they're just plain fears despisers of those that are good how many knows we're living our political system we're living in a time now that they're calling wrong right and they're calling right wrong that's exactly what we're at everything that's good everything that's right they're calling wrong and everything that's wrong is a calling right traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away selfishness lovers of their selves we're living in a very selfish age how many knows to the riots that goes on that is governed by selfishness selfishness going to a man's pawn shop and not just take everything he has but kill him before leaving that's selfish offer what people can get for what they can get we want our rights we want this we want that i want this i want that it's all selfish and it leads to destruction my last thing that i want to talk about that is violence violence in genesis because we're how many of those uh i was just thinking about we've seen violence on a much greater scale than what we have seen but you take libya muhammad qaddafi that they ran out and killed uh syria you take uh just about any of those eastern countries we know on the east is in a great distress has been in great distress with much much violence violence has really been increased but we're seeing it not just there and i i remember and you don't mean to get political i would just say trump was talking about the iranians and those who were raising up you know against the government and we're behind you and we disagree with your government and so forth and it was right about at that time that this happened over here so what could you say you know they have their rioters they have their violent people and then all of a sudden he rose up right here and we're seeing it right here at home now notice so down in uh verse chapter six hold on my bible's wearing out i need a new one i've warned quite a few out i'm still looking for a bible that won't fall apart on me but they just all fall apart i wish i had one to say because you know how it is you get to you know where pitch pay you can go right there is what i was looking for and you get a new one if it's written any different you have to kind of start over but chapter 6 of genesis but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord can somebody say amen there's a group of people that found grace in the eyes of the lord in the midst of god fixing to destroy it there was a group that found grace in the eyes of god verse 11 the earth also was corrupt before garad how many brother brahm says if a man goes into politics a clean man he'll come out corrupt the whole world is corrupt he says i don't don't matter if you're a republican or democrat it hasn't got no no one is as bad as the other it's all corruption before god and the earth was filled with what violence violence you know we used to have some violence we used to have these things but it's gotten the word almost ongoing all the time now and you have to wonder how much worse it'll get and it's predicted by that preacher that we showed up here administer that at the end of this year that it could get twice as bad according to him and you can see how that violence violence has been increased and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt and all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth remember what brother bam says the people are getting in that spirit for the destruction because god isn't going to destroy it god is so full of mercy and so long-suffering isn't that right that he lets it go to where it's just ready to explode you know right just ready to like brother brahm says it's a putrify's ore and one of these days it's just gonna bust this is gonna get worse and worse and worse infection until it'll just blow and god has to do something amen i think all of us know that if time tarried when the devil comes down himself after the bride leaves he says woe to the inhabitants then woe to the inhabitants of the earth in the tribulation period when the holy spirit comes up that accuser is brought down and the pope will not just be the pope and the antichrist false prophet but he will become the beast amen i truly believe that'll be the time that you go say a prayer for somebody without somebody's permission you'll be shot on the spot by the man's head you'll be hunted down like dogs people will have to go into the mountains and the caves and hide in that right and everything else and run for their lives and you will have to if you claim to be a christian if you want to have any chance of making heaven and now you'll have to seal your testimony with your blood amen you might come up as a foolish virgin somewhere or something amen but that's what it'll be like but violence shall be increased and i thought lord that's so true isn't it look at the violence that has increased people can no murder each other just murder each other you know it's one thing if you want to talk about racist somebody else killing you but when you go killing your own people well he ain't got nothing left there's no morality left amen the only place there is any kind of safety any kind of place of refuge is in jesus christ that's why he says there is no hope left for this world outside the coming of the lord that's why i always like to preach about the coming of the lord it come anytime it's in season don't you believe it's time any time now for the lord to come amen the dead in christ shall rise but that little story of that little woman that little girl remember out west they had that dance and so forth the boy told her i want to marry you you've got my kind of character i'll be back in a year now all that year she was getting ready for him to come that's you and me we're getting our wedding dress ready how are we getting ready by lining up with the word by listening to the tapes by reading your bible and say well look there i'm not quite lined up lord help me to line up help me line up getting ready getting everything right so that whenever you come down those double doors so to speak amen that white dress is just perfect your hair is just right isn't that right long flowy train just a beautiful word she'll be a word bride how many wanted to be that lord that's what i'm here for this morning getting ready and we're thankful i wonder one other thing was i'm not sure i think he was in the angelus temple brother branham was trying to coax people to come to the altar almost and he was really preaching for a revival and and then we keep the people come out of the balconies and so forth they were streaming he says he says the greatest joy of my life is to see this right here that is people coming to the lord and giving their lives so that's the greatest joy the prophet had was to see people give their lives to the lord jesus christ that's what he lived for amen so we have great joy this morning and knowing that god is placed in little katie's heart amen to give her heart give her life to the lord jesus christ and we've been told and we're going to say it every time we have a baptism that one of these days the last one is going to come in the last one that's going to come in then the rapture will take place folks i don't know about you but i'm look not looking for more chaos i'm looking for the coming of the lord i'm looking for before next weekend i'm hoping the lord will come and take us home to be with you are you with me from week to week from day to day hour to hour brother bram says check up keep checked up be ready for when he comes amen jesus said be ready for you know not the day or the hour but we see just with the another sign of violence and the violence they increase not just in the other world but in a green tree in the best place to live the best economy in the world for them to be that violent supposed to sign at the time if they'll do that in under good conditions a lot of people do under bad amen so praise the lord which is looking for his coming let's stand this morning we'll change the order to us amen that's just our heads just say i'd like to have a closer walk with the lord i need a closer walk with the lord i want to follow that word in a closer way than what i have god bless your hands god bless you lord jesus we see our hands father all up we all want a closer walk with you and we thank you lord jesus for the heavenly freedom lord to be able to still assemble ourselves to open up your word and to express ourselves about the awesomeness god and our great father that cares for us and it loves us so much lord and we just ask god that you give every heart and every hand father a closer walk with you lord help us not to get our eyes off of you father we know we got to do our daily things but lord keep everybody here this morning father keep their eyes on you keep their eyes looking up father watching for your great return lord and now as we change the order to service we ask god that you'll bless katie father we ask lord did you baptize her with your holy spirit as we baptize her with water and as father this water represents the death of her self dying and forfeiting her rights to you we ask god that she'd come forth as paul said in newness of life living for you for we ask these blessings in jesus name amen and amen hallelujah god bless you if those would help to get things situated here
