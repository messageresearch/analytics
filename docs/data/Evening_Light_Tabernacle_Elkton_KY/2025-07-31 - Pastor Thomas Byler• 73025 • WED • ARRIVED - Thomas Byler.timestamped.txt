[25:52] hearts, thirsty tonight, Lord. You saw
[25:54] the hands all over the building. Lord,
[25:55] that have a need. Not only do they have
[25:58] a need, but they come with expectation
[26:00] that that need will be met. That need
[26:02] can't be met by anything out in the
[26:04] world. Father, we know that. But Lord,

[26:10] need we have in our lives, Lord. So we

[26:34] message to speak tonight, Lord. And we
[26:36] ask that you would just the Holy Ghost
[26:38] fall and the anointing fall upon his
[26:40] lips and upon our ears, Lord. When we
[26:43] don't want the word to fall on deaf
[26:44] ears, but we want it to fall on ears
[26:46] that are receptive and hungering, Lord.
[26:48] And Lord, as the word goes forth, may
[26:50] that word fall deep down into our hearts
[26:52] and souls tonight, Lord. Just draw us
[26:54] close to you to prepare us in this last
[26:57] day, Lord. Because we see the times are
[26:59] perilous, Lord. We see the times are at
[27:01] hand. And we were just talking before
[27:03] the service, Lord, and what a late late
[27:05] hour it is. And we see things happening
[27:08] faster and faster and and moving further
[27:10] and further down the road. And Lord, we
[27:12] just want to have our our vessels
[27:14] prepared, Lord, our homes swept and
[27:17] cleaned and ready to take a rapture,
[27:19] Lord. So speak to us tonight, Lord, and
[27:22] pour out your heart. And we just trust
[27:23] that everything that be said, our
[27:25] worship, our songs, our praise, and
[27:28] everything that we do would be receptive
[27:30] to you, Lord. and that that you would
[27:31] just bring uh that you would find glory
[27:33] in it and and that you would be lifted

[39:10] would wish we'd pray that she'd get her
[39:13] feeling and her hands and her her feet
[39:16] were not swollen like they had been. And

[39:44] Chinese. I don't know. But I I know she
[39:47] likes about anything. So, but we just
[39:50] thank the Lord for healing her and all
[39:52] he's done for. And I she's just a
[39:54] miracle. I testify about her and her and
[39:57] Sister Donna, what the Lord's done for
[39:58] them. And I believe he can bring her the
[40:00] rest of the way. Don't you? And and I

[46:20] In that city where there cometh no
[46:24] light.
[46:27] Oh, I imagine over there. And when free
[46:32] from toil and care, I am going where the
[46:36] lamb is alive.
[46:40] Amen. How many's looking forward to
[46:42] going? Amen. God bless you this evening.
[46:45] It's good to be in the house of the
[46:46] Lord. Amen. Trust everybody's having a
[46:49] good week so far. Amen. We are certainly
[46:52] looking around the corner. Amen. For
[46:54] some of that good 80s weather. Amen. So,
[46:57] praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen.
[46:59] Good to see everybody out. Thank you,
[47:00] musicians. Amen. That'll be all. Amen.
[47:04] We're going to announce this coming
[47:06] Sunday will be our carry in Sunday.
[47:09] Brother Joe Adams will be with us Sunday
[47:11] and also next Wednesday evening. Amen.
[47:14] So, he's going to preach three services.
[47:16] So, we're looking forward to that. Amen.
[47:19] Y'all better ready be ready for your
[47:20] scream and shout. Amen.
[47:23] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. God is
[47:25] good, isn't he?
[47:27] Amen. So, I just have a little thought
[47:31] tonight with the help of the Lord. Oh,
[47:33] and brother Brad will be ministering the
[47:35] following Sunday after that. Amen. So,
[47:38] amen. Already going into August. I was
[47:41] looking at the calendar about four and a
[47:43] half weeks before September. That's
[47:45] unbelievable, isn't it? Amen. Things are
[47:47] fixed to turn around the other way.
[47:49] We're going to lose a lot of daylight.
[47:51] Amen. And so forth. But Amen. Amen.
[47:55] Praise the Lord. Quite the times that
[47:57] we're living in, isn't it?
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[48:02] we come before you, Father, tonight once
[48:04] again desiring, Lord Jesus, that Father,
[48:06] you'll have your complete way, Father,
[48:09] in the service, Lord. We welcome you in
[48:11] a special way, Lord. And we have been
[48:13] taught by your prophet that wherever you
[48:15] are invited, you always come, Lord
[48:17] Jesus. And so, Father, tonight we ask
[48:19] that you would look at every heart.
[48:21] Father, you know what's beneath every
[48:23] heart and the need of every heart and
[48:25] you know how to speak to every heart,
[48:27] Father. And we would ask, God, that you
[48:28] would minister to every need, Lord, this
[48:30] evening. Bless those that are streaming,
[48:32] Father. We do thank you, Lord, for the a
[48:34] good report, Father, on Sister Parish,
[48:37] Lord. And we just ask God that you'd
[48:39] just be with that and do that with each
[48:40] and everyone, Lord, has that same need,
[48:43] Father. And bless the reading of the
[48:45] word, the meditation of our heart. Now,
[48:46] we ask in Jesus name. Amen. Turn your
[48:49] Bibles if you will. We'll just get right
[48:50] into the word. Amen. I told my wife, I
[48:54] said, "We'll just make it short
[48:55] tonight." Amen. So, she didn't say,
[48:59] "Don't make promises you can't keep."
[49:01] But
[49:02] Amen. Philippians, if you will,
[49:05] Philippians,
[49:09] and this is kind of a new message for
[49:11] me, actually. This is, you know, and so
[49:15] we'll just see what the Lord will have.
[49:18] Amen. And I just like the Amen. If the
[49:21] Lord lays something on our hearts, just
[49:23] kind of let him if he puts it there, he
[49:25] knows what to do with it, right?
[49:28] &gt;&gt; He knows what to do with it. But this is
[49:30] a scripture that come to my mind.
[49:32] Philippians 3
[49:39] verse 7. But what things were gained to
[49:41] me I counted loss for Christ. Yay
[49:44] doubtless and I count all things but
[49:46] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[49:48] of Jesus Christ my Lord for whom I have
[49:52] suffered the loss of all things and do
[49:53] count them but dung that I may win
[49:55] Christ and be found of him not having my
[49:58] own righteousness which is of the law
[50:00] but with that which is through the faith
[50:03] of Christ the righteousness which is of
[50:06] God by faith that I may know him and the
[50:09] power of his resurrection and the
[50:10] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[50:13] conformable
[50:14] unto his death. Amen.
[50:19] And if by any means I might untain unto
[50:22] the resurrection of the dead. I want you
[50:24] to kind of pick up that word, stick it
[50:27] in your mind every time that Paul
[50:30] mentions it because I will give you my
[50:31] title off of this word here in a minute.
[50:34] And that's that word in verse 11. If by
[50:38] any means I might attain.
[50:41] Attain. All right. Unto the resurrection
[50:44] of the dead. Not as though I had already
[50:47] attained.
[50:49] Either were already perfect, but I
[50:51] follow after. If that I may apprehend,
[50:54] there's another good word that'll go
[50:56] with it. That apprehend that for which I
[51:00] am apprehended in Christ Jesus.
[51:03] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[51:06] apprehended.
[51:08] But this one thing I do, forgetting
[51:10] those things which are behind, and
[51:11] reaching forth unto things which are
[51:13] before, for I pressed towards the mark
[51:15] for the prize of the high calling of God
[51:18] in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as
[51:20] many as be perfect, be thus minded. And
[51:23] if there be anything that ye be
[51:25] otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
[51:27] this unto you.
[51:30] Nevertheless, and notice this, whereto,
[51:33] we have already attained.
[51:36] Amen. Whereto, we have already attained.
[51:39] In other words, the things that you have
[51:41] already attained to. Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; How many believe there's things that we
[51:45] have attained and there's those things
[51:48] that we're trying to attain.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; There's things that we're trying to
[51:52] apprehend and there's many things that
[51:54] we have already apprehended.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:58] Amen.
[51:59] So it says there
[52:02] where we have already attained let us
[52:03] walk by the same rule. Let us mind the
[52:06] same thing. May God add his blessings to
[52:07] the reading of the word. You can be
[52:09] seated tonight. Amen. So do you have
[52:12] that title?
[52:14] Very different title. Very different.
[52:17] Called arrived
[52:19] arrived.
[52:21] Amen.
[52:23] Amen. That's the word that come to my
[52:25] mind. Amen. And then I begin to work off
[52:28] of that. Amen. And begin to think, you
[52:30] know, and just let the Holy Spirit uh,
[52:33] you know, quicken some things. Amen. And
[52:36] it was amazing where it went. Amen.
[52:40] Uh, so Paul's saying here that I don't
[52:44] claim that I've gotten there, right?
[52:48] There's some things that we have
[52:49] attained to. There's some things that we
[52:51] have we've possessed that we get. Now,
[52:54] notice the word possession. Amen. when
[52:56] uh uh when when you arrive someplace,
[53:00] you've gotten to the place that you were
[53:02] trying to get to. Amen. You're in
[53:05] possession of something now. Maybe you
[53:07] had a goal, right? And you work hard
[53:10] towards that goal and you finally get to
[53:13] that goal.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you get there, there's
[53:18] great joy because you have arrived.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; You've gotten what you were trying to
[53:23] attain. You've gotten there.
[53:26] Amen.
[53:33] I thought before I come out here, I
[53:36] thought that brother Brandham had said
[53:37] something about that in his vision of
[53:41] where he went beyond the curtain of time
[53:44] and he seen all the people there, right?
[53:46] And he described what it was like
[53:49] and it was so beautiful. It was so
[53:51] perfect.
[53:54] And he makes a statement. Oh, when I
[53:57] thought to come back, it made me sad.
[54:01] Will I have to go back again?
[54:04] Why? Because he had gotten there.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to go back.
[54:09] How many believes we're looking to go to
[54:10] that place?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Man, that's what we're striving for.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even Paul said it in the
[54:16] resurrection that I by any means I might
[54:18] I might attain unto the resurrection of
[54:21] the dead.
[54:23] Amen. Will I have to go back to what I
[54:27] was afraid of being? See, then when we
[54:31] come to the resurrected body, then we
[54:34] will eat and drink. They didn't eat or
[54:36] drink. They had no need of eating or
[54:38] drinking. They uh they wasn't going
[54:40] nowhere. And they wasn't tired. It was
[54:43] just there's no word that I could use.
[54:47] It was perfect that would make it. It's
[54:49] beyond what you call perfect.
[54:53] They had just arrived.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; They had gotten there.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] Amen. What a place. Isn't that nice?
[55:05] What a place to be is to get where
[55:08] you're trying to go.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; You know, they said, I guess, brother
[55:14] Glenn and Sherry, they went on a road
[55:15] trip, right? Alaska.
[55:18] They're enjoying the last y'all made it
[55:20] back. Good to see you back. Glad you had
[55:22] a hope you had a good trip.
[55:24] But there and I was sitting back there.
[55:26] It's kind of like them, you know,
[55:28] because I think it was brother Glenn
[55:31] says that Sherry has a bucket list, you
[55:33] know, and she wants to go places and see
[55:35] places and stuff, you know, and they've
[55:38] kind of got a goal. I know I have a
[55:39] vision of we're going to go to we want
[55:41] to see Alaska,
[55:43] you know, and I can just kind of
[55:44] imagine. I don't know about them. Ain't
[55:46] no telling. I don't know if it's a fancy
[55:48] restaurant with big lobsters is the
[55:50] imagination of their desire or what
[55:52] they're really looking for, you know?
[55:54] But for me, I'd like to find one of the
[55:55] highest peaks. Wouldn't you get way up
[55:58] there somewhere and to be able to just
[56:00] see the vast beautiful land and man
[56:03] having to travel? I don't know if they
[56:04] flew. I guess hopefully they flew.
[56:07] Surely they didn't drive all that way.
[56:10] Glenn would tell us that you know what
[56:12] he says about she's going to kill me.
[56:16] But anyway, they flew up there and so
[56:19] they go to the vast parts. Amen. And
[56:22] they they they go to the airport, they
[56:24] go to Nashville, they go to they fly and
[56:26] they come and they do all of that and
[56:28] all of the work that goes into trying to
[56:30] get there and finally be there and I can
[56:34] just kind of imagine perhaps you're
[56:36] there and you know you put out a little
[56:39] man I'm finally am I glad we finally got
[56:43] here.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; You know, isn't this awesome? This is
[56:46] really nice, you know, and hopefully is
[56:48] as good as what they dream.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:52] And that's kind of what we want to speak
[56:54] on that place of arrival.
[56:57] Amen.
[57:00] There's quite a it's it's it's it's
[57:02] quite something. It's like
[57:05] Amen. It's kind of like the trips that
[57:08] we used to take to Florida. Many we
[57:10] don't take near as many anymore. Amen.
[57:12] But we used to go and you know there'd
[57:15] be these mile markers, right? These mile
[57:18] posts, what we call mile posts as you're
[57:20] traveling.
[57:23] Let me go back a little bit. First of
[57:25] all, how many's ever really been on
[57:28] expectation of going somewhere so much
[57:31] so that that night before leaving you
[57:32] couldn't hardly sleep.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's so much
[57:37] expectation that man I can't go man you
[57:42] I'm looking forward to the time I can't
[57:44] wait till morning I can't wait till we
[57:46] go
[57:48] and you know that's the way it is in the
[57:50] Bible there's uh when the fullness of
[57:53] time comes you know it was time for the
[57:55] kingdom of god to be preached there's a
[57:57] time for everything
[58:00] &gt;&gt; and we anticipate even the moment of
[58:02] that time and you're finally he says oh
[58:04] man the The time has finally come.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:13] And so just before you can even go, the
[58:15] time has come. And I believe we're
[58:17] living in that hour, don't you?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; That the time has come.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] That it's about time to leave this
[58:25] place.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; So next morning you get up. I don't know
[58:30] what it might be. Might be me and Joe
[58:32] going to Texas on a hunt. Man, I can't
[58:33] hardly sleep. I can't wait. Hey, we're
[58:35] going to Wyoming on a bird. I don't
[58:36] know. You know, uh, you know, used to be
[58:39] exciting and doing different things and
[58:40] but you head to Florida maybe and and as
[58:43] you start out, of course, your first
[58:46] line uh mile marker is going to be what?
[58:49] Nashville. Oh, man. You know, it's an
[58:51] hour to Nashville. All right, we step
[58:54] number one. Next one's Chattanooga,
[58:57] right? All right. Three hours. Oh, three
[59:00] hours to Chattanooga, you know, and next
[59:03] one after that finally. Oh, we got that.
[59:05] But boy, oh boy. Oh, boy. It's kind of a
[59:07] drag. We still got a long way to go,
[59:10] right, Brother Troy?
[59:13] Atlanta. All right, we Atlanta's the
[59:15] next one. Oh, finally we get down there.
[59:17] It's about I don't know 80 miles between
[59:20] is Chattanooga 80 something or is it
[59:22] maybe a little more than that? But
[59:24] anyway, you get to Atlanta. The next
[59:26] one's what? M
[59:29] waiting for that 475 bypass. And once
[59:31] you get on the other side of that 475
[59:33] bypass, just where you come around that
[59:36] curve over there, that's always to me
[59:37] been the halfway mark. I don't think
[59:39] it's quite halfway, but it's pretty
[59:41] close.
[59:42] You come around there and say, "All
[59:44] right, we meet back up with 75. Next
[59:46] one, Valdasta, Florida." All right,
[59:48] that's the next one is after making
[59:50] Valdusta. You know, you go to through
[59:52] Tiffan and all these other little towns
[59:54] and but you're looking for Valdasta cuz
[59:57] it's down there.
[59:59] And finally you get to Valdusta.
[1:00:02] And then you go past the Valdusta just a
[1:00:05] little bit just looking for that
[1:00:06] Florida. Welcome to Florida sign.
[1:00:10] I finally get to the Florida Florida
[1:00:12] sign. Oh, we're the we're at the
[1:00:14] landmark here now. We're in Florida.
[1:00:17] Amen. We ain't got to worry about them
[1:00:19] Georgia troopers anymore. They're
[1:00:21] everywhere.
[1:00:26] All right. Come to Florida next one.
[1:00:28] Next thing you see is a big old sign
[1:00:31] says 203 miles to Tampa. Oh,
[1:00:37] 200, man. Honey, can you drive for a
[1:00:40] little while? Right about that time. See
[1:00:44] if you can drive. Get a little siesta
[1:00:45] and wake up about where just 20 mile.
[1:00:48] Wake up about 20 miles from Oh, yeah.
[1:00:50] That's all right. We got it made now.
[1:00:52] Ain't that right?
[1:00:55] And so after of course you get to Tampa
[1:00:57] it's just about an hour maybe or so back
[1:00:59] to you're going to go. Amen. And when
[1:01:01] you get that you get out of the truck
[1:01:03] and man I am glad we have finally
[1:01:07] arrived. Amen. You kids know how it is.
[1:01:11] Are we there yet? Are we there yet? No,
[1:01:14] we're not there yet.
[1:01:17] Amen. That's what Paul was saying. We
[1:01:19] haven't gotten there. But guess what? We
[1:01:21] ain't looking back. Amen. We're pressing
[1:01:23] for the mark of the prize of the high
[1:01:25] calling. Amen. We've had gl we've had
[1:01:29] our marks of Paul and Arinius and Martin
[1:01:32] and Pentecost. We've had the m marker of
[1:01:35] Malachi 4. But Bam said, you know, you
[1:01:38] know, a couple years ago Malachi 4
[1:01:40] wasn't fulfilled, but he said now it's
[1:01:42] fulfilled.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; I mean, know he said that. That's right.
[1:01:45] Malachi being fulfilled. Amen. He the
[1:01:48] word is restored. Give us some mile
[1:01:50] markers telling us where we are.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. A little bit closer and we will
[1:01:55] look for 50 years for that woman in
[1:01:58] purple. Hello. Amen. We waited for 50 60
[1:02:02] years. I don't know just how long it's
[1:02:03] been. Amen. For that man to come out of
[1:02:06] Rome. And we know he said one he said
[1:02:08] once that woman comes in there and does
[1:02:10] what she does. He said the next thing he
[1:02:12] saw was the world America burned up.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? nothing but volcanic
[1:02:20] or or ashes everywhere. And here we are
[1:02:24] giving I mean giving Putin an ultimatum
[1:02:27] of about five days and he said, "Hey,
[1:02:29] you're going to cause World War II."
[1:02:31] Talking like that.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Now, how many knows we are going to have
[1:02:35] to tick him off pretty good cuz for him
[1:02:38] to push the button, he's going to have
[1:02:39] to not like us well at all.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; So, as long as Trump and Putin are on
[1:02:44] the phone being buddies, maybe nothing
[1:02:46] will happen.
[1:02:48] But if they're mad at each other and
[1:02:50] they don't like each other, we don't
[1:02:52] never know. Ain't that right? How many
[1:02:54] believes that we could go at any time?
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; The rapture could happen at any time. We
[1:03:00] are passing these landmarks. We're
[1:03:03] almost home, people. It's time to get
[1:03:06] excited. We're coming down the home
[1:03:08] stretch. It ain't going to be very long
[1:03:11] anymore. And there's going to be a body
[1:03:14] change. And I'm not just worried about
[1:03:16] the world blowing up. There's a bride.
[1:03:18] There's a church. There's a people in
[1:03:20] this church right here. Amen. That is
[1:03:22] manifesting. Amen. That they're getting
[1:03:25] ready. A bride is getting ready to
[1:03:27] leave. We're coming into his image.
[1:03:29] Amen. We've got the dynamics of the
[1:03:31] power of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And not
[1:03:34] just the mechanics.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A church that's getting
[1:03:40] ready.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many believes that?
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And we're looking forward to
[1:03:46] it. And I like it. I like that song. I
[1:03:50] don't know if Brother David can maybe
[1:03:52] sing that, but I'm here to tell you,
[1:03:54] Amen. When we get over yonder,
[1:03:58] this is what Brother Bam says about it.
[1:04:00] When they finally get there, he says,
[1:04:02] "No, listen friends.
[1:04:06] I think I'm in my right mind. I know it
[1:04:09] sounds strange, but if I've ever been
[1:04:11] able and never tried to explain to the
[1:04:13] people of things, he says it's beyond
[1:04:15] explaining. He says, you'd only confuse
[1:04:18] the people's mind if you would try to.
[1:04:20] It's a lot. It would be alarming. But
[1:04:22] notice this. I say this, don't be
[1:04:23] afraid. That is just a scarecrow trying
[1:04:27] to keep you away from something. My,
[1:04:29] it's so glorious. It's beyond anything
[1:04:31] that you could think of. No wonder the
[1:04:34] Bible says, "Eye has not seen, ear has
[1:04:36] not heard, nor has it entered into the
[1:04:38] heart of man." Amen. The things that God
[1:04:41] has prepared for them that love him. Oh,
[1:04:44] just to look past the curtain of time.
[1:04:48] Amen. Another place he says, "Whatever
[1:04:49] you do, friends, don't miss it. You
[1:04:52] can't afford to miss it." How many knows
[1:04:56] when we get over I like that song. When
[1:04:58] I get over there, when I finally get to
[1:05:00] that place, when I finally arrive, I'm
[1:05:02] going to let the glory roll. When the
[1:05:04] roll is called in glory, I'm going to
[1:05:06] have the time of my life. When the time
[1:05:08] of my life is over, I'm going to get
[1:05:11] carried away when I get carried away.
[1:05:14] [Applause]
[1:05:16] Woo! How many believe that's what we
[1:05:18] are? Amen. We're under expectation.
[1:05:20] We're looking forward to it. And when we
[1:05:22] get over there, get out of my way. I'm
[1:05:25] going to run and scream and shout and
[1:05:26] praise God. I'm going to get carried
[1:05:29] away.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; But we got to get carried away a little
[1:05:33] bit.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz how many believes we have already,
[1:05:38] praise the Lord, come and we already
[1:05:40] have in our possession.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; We have come to the place that we
[1:05:45] possess the down payment of heaven.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many remembers what brother
[1:05:54] Bam said about earnest money? Amen. How
[1:05:58] many believes we've got the earnest?
[1:06:02] I'm going to jump around here a little
[1:06:04] bit, but I might as well go here while
[1:06:06] I'm at it because I want to take you
[1:06:07] through a little
[1:06:10] little cycle.
[1:06:14] Let me just do that.
[1:06:25] Paul said that we are saved by hope.
[1:06:31] But hope that is seen
[1:06:34] is not hope.
[1:06:38] For what a man seeth, why does he get
[1:06:41] hope for it? In other words, once you
[1:06:44] possess something, once you arrive, once
[1:06:47] you have something, you ain't got to
[1:06:49] hope for it anymore.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; There's people perhaps, "Oh, I'd like to
[1:06:54] get saved. I'm trying to get saved. I'm
[1:06:56] trying to get more. I want to be born
[1:06:58] again." Amen. And they're fighting and
[1:07:00] they're struggling and everything else.
[1:07:02] That's not any fun.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] Oh, I just don't know if I'm worthy. I
[1:07:09] just don't know this, that, or the
[1:07:10] other. Amen.
[1:07:15] And I had to ask myself the question
[1:07:17] here. I don't know if anybody anybody
[1:07:20] but wants to have joy.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; How many wants to have joyable?
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; How many believe we can have joy
[1:07:28] unspeakable?
[1:07:30] And I like the second half as I wrote it
[1:07:32] down. It's not just joy unspeakable, but
[1:07:35] it's full of glory.
[1:07:38] [Applause]
[1:07:40] It's full of glory
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; when you think about it.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because if you've got God, man,
[1:07:48] you've got all of God on the inside. You
[1:07:51] got glory, the glory that created the
[1:07:54] heavens and the earth.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; But it might be a struggle. It might be
[1:07:59] a journey of
[1:08:02] of uh justification, sanctification, and
[1:08:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:08:10] That's right.
[1:08:12] You might want uh no doubt, but people
[1:08:15] want peace. Peace that passes
[1:08:16] understanding.
[1:08:18] The very peace of God. But there's a way
[1:08:20] to get that. There's a way to come to
[1:08:23] the place where you can say, "I have
[1:08:26] arrived. I have got it."
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is little little of the
[1:08:33] series like Benjamin Franklin said, "I
[1:08:35] got it. I got it." Well, what do you
[1:08:37] got? Tonight, we want to look at what we
[1:08:40] got.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. What you possess, not what you
[1:08:45] want. We're going to talk about wishbone
[1:08:47] and backbone.
[1:08:48] Not the stuff that you wish you had.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; There's a whole If you don't have
[1:08:53] something, all you can do is wish for
[1:08:55] it.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; You still got to have wishbone, but you
[1:08:58] got to have faith to get that and get
[1:09:00] rid of the wishbone and be claim it,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; to accept it, to receive it. Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You still got to hope for things
[1:09:08] that you don't have.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; All right. So, a little walk there
[1:09:23] stages we come through.
[1:09:28] Amen.
[1:09:38] I think as brother Bram said that Job
[1:09:40] when he uh when he finally got the
[1:09:43] revelation and God revealed himself to
[1:09:46] him, he said, "I know.
[1:09:49] I know my redeemer liveth."
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; He may have had questions before. He may
[1:09:55] have had confusion before. But when he
[1:09:58] got the revelation, I know my redeemer
[1:10:00] liveth. That's why brother Abraham says
[1:10:02] it's time people know that they're
[1:10:05] saved.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might struggle. You might s.
[1:10:08] But you've got to do one thing. One
[1:10:10] thing you got to do. Amen. Is to repent
[1:10:12] of your sins.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Repent and get baptized in the name of
[1:10:16] Jesus Christ. Ask him to forgive you of
[1:10:19] your sins. If you want to be forgiven,
[1:10:21] if you don't want to have condemnation
[1:10:23] in your heart, if you want to be free,
[1:10:26] you got to come the right way. And God
[1:10:28] has a way. You got to come that way. You
[1:10:30] got to go through that death of
[1:10:32] yourself,
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; man. And when you finally do,
[1:10:40] this just comes fresh. I believe Brother
[1:10:41] Brandham said, you know, uh, Abraham
[1:10:44] after he had the the battle, Amen, with
[1:10:47] the enemy and brought his brother back
[1:10:49] after he had gotten your after you got
[1:10:51] yourself whipped.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Hello. After you whipped yourself, after
[1:10:56] you had that battle with yourself, Amen.
[1:10:58] You've overcome that battle. Amen. Then
[1:11:00] you're ready for fellowship with
[1:11:02] Almighty God.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; You got to have that battle.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; When you finally come to the end of that
[1:11:08] battle.
[1:11:10] Amen.
[1:11:12] Then what does God do?
[1:11:15] God gives you something.
[1:11:18] Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; What is that something? It's that
[1:11:22] something that God told Joshua. Remember
[1:11:25] he says, "Now get up and go in and
[1:11:29] possess the land."
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; How many believes that it's time to
[1:11:34] arrive?
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; It's time to possess.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; It's time to have it.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Not wish you had it or try to have it.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; You got to go through those stages, but
[1:11:46] it's time to possess it. Amen. I thought
[1:11:49] of that scripture where Jesus said, "Be
[1:11:51] ready." How many believe it's time to be
[1:11:55] ready? In other words, you have come to
[1:11:57] the place. You have arrived at the place
[1:12:01] to where you truly believe if Jesus
[1:12:03] comes before morning, you're ready.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; You have arrived.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a process sometimes.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] See, brother Bam says when he was
[1:12:25] preaching about the message of the hour
[1:12:27] at invisible union, I believe it was. He
[1:12:29] says we don't just come together to talk
[1:12:31] about the message. We are to come
[1:12:33] together to get in the message. And we
[1:12:36] can say not just get in the message, but
[1:12:38] we got to get the message in us.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; He says it's not time to just sympathize
[1:12:42] and say, "Yeah, I believe it right.
[1:12:44] Yeah, I believe it right." It's got to
[1:12:46] be more than that. You've got to possess
[1:12:48] it.
[1:12:52] You got to get to the plate first. It's
[1:12:54] in me. I am the message.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; The message is in me. Perfect faith is
[1:13:00] in me. Perfect love is in me.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like that. He said it's
[1:13:10] like another place he explained it. He
[1:13:13] says the message, you know, it's like a
[1:13:14] young man seeing a young girl. She may
[1:13:17] be beautiful as ever. She maybe be
[1:13:19] Christian, you know, but guess what? If
[1:13:22] he don't say, "Hey, will you be mine?"
[1:13:25] She ain't never going to do him any
[1:13:26] good.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Never know him commitment. Hello. But
[1:13:30] you got to you got to say, "Hey, will
[1:13:32] you marry me?"
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Commit yourself. Become part of
[1:13:38] it. That's the way it is. This is it's
[1:13:40] beautiful. Let's make it part of us.
[1:13:43] Say, "It's mine. We are one.
[1:13:49] Amen.
[1:13:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:54] All right.
[1:13:56] How many knows that prophecy is
[1:13:57] something that's foretelling the future?
[1:14:00] Prophecy foretells the future. And we've
[1:14:03] already covered a lot of that. How that
[1:14:05] you know it tells the future, but there
[1:14:07] comes a time when that prophecy is
[1:14:09] fulfilled.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:16] And then it's not prophecy anymore.
[1:14:21] And we always wait for thousands of
[1:14:23] years just as a prophecy of there'll be
[1:14:26] a day that'll be neither dark nor light,
[1:14:29] but it'll be a dismal day.
[1:14:32] Little confusing when you got 1900
[1:14:35] different churches, thousands of
[1:14:36] different faiths,
[1:14:39] bunch of different churches from the
[1:14:40] same Bible.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Hello. like a bunch of different message
[1:14:45] churches out of the message.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Aren't we all supposed to be message
[1:14:49] believers?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "In every revival,
[1:14:56] there's twins."
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; There's the carnal believer that
[1:14:59] persecutes the the real Christian
[1:15:02] believer, always against him. There's
[1:15:04] always twins in every revival.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen.
[1:15:12] But there's a truth somewhere.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; That's where I want to be. I want to be
[1:15:15] in the right path. Amen. Okay.
[1:15:20] Praise the Lord. So there you are. God,
[1:15:23] forgive me.
[1:15:26] Lord, forgive me. Fill me. I want to
[1:15:29] possess the land. I don't want to just
[1:15:31] look across Jordan.
[1:15:34] How many knows? It was a journey for
[1:15:36] Israel.
[1:15:38] Two weeks journey took him 40 years.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Took him 40 years to go about two
[1:15:50] weeks journey.
[1:15:58] Some folks struggle half their lifetime
[1:16:01] trying to surrender themselves and get
[1:16:02] the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Don't knock Israel so much.
[1:16:07] How long have you been struggling along
[1:16:09] going around mountains?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Time to surrender to God.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Time to be surrendered to God.
[1:16:19] Time to be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead to that promised land. I
[1:16:24] want that promise. It's mine. Go in and
[1:16:26] possess it. What is the promise? The
[1:16:29] promise is to you, to your children, to
[1:16:32] them that are far off, that if you'll
[1:16:34] repent, Amen, you shall receive the gift
[1:16:36] of the Holy Ghost. Cuz it's the promise.
[1:16:40] It is our promised land to you, to your
[1:16:43] children, to them that are far off, even
[1:16:46] as many as the Lord our God shall call.
[1:16:50] I remember I remember struggling. I
[1:16:52] remember looking for what's truth. I
[1:16:54] remember desiring the Holy Ghost. I
[1:16:56] remember thirsting after God. I remember
[1:16:58] wanting to be knowing that I'm forgiven
[1:17:00] of my sins.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Hello. But I'm here to tell you, Amen.
[1:17:06] When John,
[1:17:09] my goodness,
[1:17:11] Stephen, can't even remember my father's
[1:17:14] name, so to speak. John Stemon. Amen.
[1:17:17] When we got baptized into that Philipp
[1:17:21] when I come up out of there, hello. I
[1:17:24] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. It
[1:17:27] was a load lifted. I thought I might
[1:17:29] just float on away. I know the feeling.
[1:17:32] And it ain't just a feeling, but I'm
[1:17:34] here to tell you when all the load of
[1:17:36] your sins and the burdens of your sins
[1:17:38] are gone, you're going to know it. A
[1:17:40] baby can't be born and not know it.
[1:17:44] And I'm here to tell you, you begin to
[1:17:46] woo. Yeah, I have arrived. I don't want
[1:17:51] it anymore. I've got it, Daddy. I've got
[1:17:54] it.
[1:17:56] Why? When you get to the place that you
[1:17:58] want to go, you have to wish for it.
[1:18:00] Amen.
[1:18:04] I got it.
[1:18:07] I still got it. I still got it. 40 years
[1:18:12] later.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Come to that place, Brother Brad.
[1:18:23] That's good.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; I have arrived
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; to the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; And I got something to be excited about.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Man, I miss my fan. Got to have my fan.
[1:18:41] It's under the house where me and Caleb
[1:18:43] was crawling like rats.
[1:18:49] Amen. Got it. Praise be to God.
[1:18:54] How many knows what all comes with that?
[1:19:00] Let me explain what comes with that.
[1:19:08] Brother Brandon preached that the Holy
[1:19:11] Ghost is a token.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; This is where the Holy Spirit took me.
[1:19:18] That it's a token. And when you get the
[1:19:20] Holy Ghost,
[1:19:22] that is a sign that the price has been t
[1:19:26] paid.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Token is a prize. A sign that the price
[1:19:31] has been paid. He says a railroad
[1:19:33] company, a bus company, a lot of times
[1:19:35] they don't take money. You come on there
[1:19:38] and say, "Here's a $100. Let me on."
[1:19:41] Nope. Give me the ticket.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Got to have a ticket.
[1:19:46] They'll shut that door on you. You got
[1:19:48] to have a ticket. How many believes if
[1:19:50] we're going to escape Putin's nuke, you
[1:19:53] better have a ticket.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; You better have the ticket in your hand.
[1:19:59] You better have the token in your hand.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:10] Oh, many things he said and I'll just go
[1:20:11] over it quick out of memory. Brother
[1:20:14] Benham says that if he gives you the
[1:20:15] Holy Ghost, that means that God has
[1:20:18] accepted your faith. He has accepted
[1:20:21] your sacrifice. In other words, you have
[1:20:24] died the way you're supposed to die to
[1:20:26] yourself. And you have believed the way
[1:20:27] that you are supposed to believe because
[1:20:29] we're not to be supposed to have to
[1:20:31] carry and wait anymore. The second that
[1:20:34] you believe, the second that you really
[1:20:36] accept it, God is obligated to you.
[1:20:43] Boy, if somebody ain't got the Holy
[1:20:45] Ghost where you ought to have, you ought
[1:20:46] to write that down on your little
[1:20:47] tablet. God actually accepts your faith.
[1:20:51] Amen. He will give it to you right then.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; You are in possession.
[1:21:03] You have arrived at the place. You are
[1:21:04] there now.
[1:21:07] And it means the price has been paid. He
[1:21:09] has accepted your money. He has accepted
[1:21:11] the offering that you have given and
[1:21:13] that is faith in the in the blood of
[1:21:16] Jesus Christ.
[1:21:20] Amen.
[1:21:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:25] Brother Bam goes to talking about it
[1:21:28] used to be that they had to have the
[1:21:30] blood that token in the Old Testament.
[1:21:34] They had to put the blood of a lamb on
[1:21:37] the post of the door of the house. So
[1:21:40] everybody can see it. It's got to be on
[1:21:43] the post and on the lantern.
[1:21:46] So every onlooker can tell that you have
[1:21:48] been you are under the toe. And how many
[1:21:50] believes your workers, your boss, the
[1:21:52] people around you ought to be able to
[1:21:54] tell that's a Christian.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; He's got the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] We ought to be a witness.
[1:22:06] We'll get into that in a minute.
[1:22:09] Amen. Joe was telling me of how he
[1:22:12] witnessing to folks and telling them,
[1:22:14] "Hey, are you ready if the Lord comes,
[1:22:17] you know, are you ready at 2:30 or what?
[1:22:19] Are you ready for the Lord coming
[1:22:22] this week? We've had a sheetrock
[1:22:24] finisher finish your our sheetrock Caleb
[1:22:26] sheetrock." And I was impressed upon
[1:22:29] him, felt felt my heart to go tell him,
[1:22:32] talk to him and invite him to come to
[1:22:33] church.
[1:22:35] And uh
[1:22:38] Juan's his name. I like the guy. He's
[1:22:40] just you know some people just lively
[1:22:43] and you know just something about him
[1:22:47] and he was just about to be done today
[1:22:50] and I went over there and I says, "Hey,
[1:22:51] you go to church?"
[1:22:54] He said, "No, we we used to. Me and my
[1:22:56] wife used to." I says, "Well, you ought
[1:22:57] to because we're at the end of the
[1:22:59] world."
[1:23:02] you ought to cuz we're at the end of the
[1:23:04] world. That's what I told him. He says,
[1:23:07] "Yes, yes, yes. If we see," and he's at
[1:23:09] the New York, the massacre, he knows. He
[1:23:12] said, "Here's why." He knows. Ain't that
[1:23:14] right? So, I gave him the church
[1:23:16] address. We may see him. He said he
[1:23:18] might just come by. Amen.
[1:23:21] We got to be bold. How many believes
[1:23:22] that?
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. In witnessing, I need to be more
[1:23:26] bolder than I am. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:31] So let's look at this token. And they
[1:23:33] had to put it on the house. It was his
[1:23:35] requirement. He says, "And that was
[1:23:37] their protection against death." Ain't
[1:23:40] that right? Amen. And as we see the
[1:23:43] great end times of the earth, warning us
[1:23:45] the time is at hand. How many believes
[1:23:48] the time is at hand?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; We're here. We have arrived at the end.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says we should love one another
[1:23:56] more than we ever did in our lives. We
[1:23:59] should love and have such a hunger to go
[1:24:02] to church.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wrote in here and I hope it
[1:24:07] don't full hurt nobody because I tell
[1:24:09] you what, our elderly and different
[1:24:11] people that are adolescent that can't
[1:24:13] come to church, it's all fine to stream.
[1:24:15] But people that just stream, well, I
[1:24:17] don't go to church. I I stream.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Be careful. I felt to say that you don't
[1:24:23] stream yourself into hell.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Hello. Maybe you need a little more than
[1:24:29] just streaming.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; If you can, you need to be in the house
[1:24:32] of God. You need to have so much of the
[1:24:34] love of God.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; That you're not just comfortable
[1:24:37] drinking your tea in your rocking chair.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Hello. Or your soda or whatever it is
[1:24:43] when you could be up and about.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're sick or can you can't do
[1:24:50] it, I'm glad for all our streamers.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; My brother Mo, I don't know if he's
[1:24:55] listening, but he had told me the other
[1:24:57] day he streams the service here. He
[1:24:59] really enjoys it. So, if he's listening,
[1:25:03] appreciate him listening. Amen.
[1:25:05] Led him to the Lord way many years ago.
[1:25:08] Here we go.
[1:25:10] That's right. There should be such a
[1:25:13] hunger to get to church. There should be
[1:25:15] such a hunger for us to get with one
[1:25:17] another. How many believe we ought to
[1:25:19] love one another? We ought to be for one
[1:25:22] another because I made it to tell you
[1:25:24] just before I come out. I said, "Lord
[1:25:26] Jesus, get on my knees. Lord, I'm going
[1:25:28] to stand before your purchased of your
[1:25:30] blood. Keep me from saying anything I
[1:25:32] shouldn't say. And Lord, help me to feed
[1:25:34] your sheep." Amen. We got to have a
[1:25:37] respect and a love one for another. And
[1:25:39] that's what he's saying in the times and
[1:25:41] so forth that we're the age that we're
[1:25:43] living in. Amen.
[1:25:46] Praise the Lord. We see the end times.
[1:25:49] Brother Bam talks about he can't hardly
[1:25:51] wait to go see his wife. She got healed.
[1:25:53] Amen. That's the way the church ought to
[1:25:55] be. Just seeing the power of God, what
[1:25:58] it's done for us. We should be counting
[1:26:01] the moments getting together in love
[1:26:04] that we can that we can fly away someday
[1:26:08] to meet Jesus.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; How many's looking for that? That's
[1:26:11] right. One of days we're going to fly
[1:26:12] away. Amen. And meet Jesus. Praise the
[1:26:16] Lord. Because that's what we're looking
[1:26:17] to do.
[1:26:19] Amen. You know, Israel on their journey,
[1:26:23] they had a lot of scary times. Ain't
[1:26:25] that right? Scary times.
[1:26:30] For example, when they were down at the
[1:26:31] Red Sea trapped and the enemy was
[1:26:34] coming, they could hear him coming, see
[1:26:36] the dust, I guess, and they begin to
[1:26:39] complain and murmur. But what did God
[1:26:41] do? He opened up the Red Sea
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; and he began to walk across. Amen. And
[1:26:47] while they were walking across, there
[1:26:48] was probably a lot of spooky thoughts,
[1:26:53] a lot of fear, perhaps.
[1:26:56] Amen. I thought that's like kind of like
[1:26:58] maybe uh like what what a person may be
[1:27:01] with my wife or whoever. Perhaps you're
[1:27:03] sick. Perhaps there's cancer and while
[1:27:05] you're waiting on the Lord to come heal
[1:27:07] you, you believe you're healed. Hello.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, when you get
[1:27:12] to that other side, Amen. and the enemy
[1:27:15] gets washed away. I'm here to tell you
[1:27:17] when you get results back and they tell
[1:27:20] you it's not on the limp notes anymore.
[1:27:22] It's not on the lengthen. We said we
[1:27:24] have arrived. God has done something for
[1:27:27] us. We are here. We're seeing the power
[1:27:30] of God.
[1:27:32] We're seeing him move
[1:27:37] to the place you can rejoice on the
[1:27:39] other bank. Woo!
[1:27:43] You can be happy.
[1:27:45] Oh, there's so many different
[1:27:46] illustrations. It's like a football
[1:27:48] team. It's like a basketball team that's
[1:27:51] struggling sweat.
[1:27:53] And I'll be honest with you, I've never
[1:27:55] liked basketball a whole lot. Never been
[1:27:57] much of a basketball man.
[1:28:01] Cuz for the most part, they're even
[1:28:03] teams and they play all the way to the
[1:28:05] end. They're always pretty much close
[1:28:07] tied.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; At least the ones I've watched watched
[1:28:10] years ago. I guess they got what? Three
[1:28:13] quarters, four quarters.
[1:28:16] Well, the just throw the first three
[1:28:18] away.
[1:28:19] Don't mean nothing.
[1:28:22] Same way with football. Whenever they're
[1:28:25] just one touchdown away, it don't matter
[1:28:27] if they're in overtime or how long
[1:28:28] they've been playing and there's just
[1:28:30] two minutes and they're on the 30 yard
[1:28:33] or 40 yardd line. Hello. And they've got
[1:28:36] two minutes or comes down to 30 seconds.
[1:28:38] Those 30 seconds are more important to
[1:28:40] you than everything else. And that's the
[1:28:43] way it is with you and I. We've had all
[1:28:45] the church agents. We've had all of
[1:28:47] that. But this is the important time.
[1:28:50] This is time to be ready. This is where
[1:28:52] it matters the most.
[1:29:00] This is crunch time.
[1:29:10] This is where people are at the edge of
[1:29:13] their seat. Hello.
[1:29:16] Counting down. Maybe it's down to the
[1:29:18] last play.
[1:29:22] They're at 10 yard line.
[1:29:25] It's fourth down
[1:29:27] or even probably fourth.
[1:29:31] Why? Because they didn't make it on the
[1:29:33] three downs. So, they're going to try it
[1:29:36] with the fourth,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; whether it's a field goal, most likely
[1:29:40] it'll be a field goal. But if they don't
[1:29:43] and they go back, everybody's watching.
[1:29:46] And when that quarterback throws that
[1:29:48] ball, when that wide receiver, when he
[1:29:51] tips it, hello, he he tips it and he
[1:29:55] still just jumps over and catches it and
[1:29:58] knows it. Can you imagine the crowd?
[1:30:02] They ripped their shirt, go crazy. Why?
[1:30:05] Cuz they had beaten. They've come to the
[1:30:08] place of victory. And that's where you
[1:30:11] and I ought to be tonight. Amen. Don't
[1:30:13] talk to me about victory. I know what
[1:30:15] victory is. I am victorious. You are
[1:30:18] victorious. We enjoy the thrill of
[1:30:22] victory.
[1:30:26] That's where you and I ought to be.
[1:30:28] victorious cuz he's coming for not
[1:30:30] defeated people. He's coming for people
[1:30:33] have overcome. To him that overcometh,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; will I grant to sit with me in my
[1:30:40] throne?
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes we you need to
[1:30:56] possess that? What did Paul say? Amen.
[1:31:01] Oh death, where is your sting? Oh grave,
[1:31:04] where is your victory? But I thank my
[1:31:07] Lord Jesus Christ who has given me.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; I now possess the victory over death. I
[1:31:13] don't fear death. Oh chopping block, let
[1:31:15] me stick my head in there cuz you have
[1:31:17] no victory over me.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; That's where you and I ought to live.
[1:31:23] Sin, you have no victory over me.
[1:31:25] Temptation, you ain't got no victory
[1:31:27] over me.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; I think Jesus has given me the victory
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] Praise God. How many believe you ought
[1:31:58] to be the happiest people?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; We should be the happiest people on the
[1:32:01] face of the earth cuz you possess the
[1:32:04] token. You got the ticket. The train is
[1:32:07] coming around. It's in the block and
[1:32:10] we're fixing to get on it. And you ain't
[1:32:12] got to worry. You ain't got to fret. You
[1:32:15] ain't got to worry about the future of
[1:32:17] this world because you've got the ticket
[1:32:19] in your hand.
[1:32:22] Why? Because you love the Lord God with
[1:32:24] all of your heart. You love him on a
[1:32:27] Monday. You love him on a Tuesday. You
[1:32:28] love him on a Wednesday. You love him on
[1:32:30] a Thursday. You love him on a Friday.
[1:32:32] And you love him on a Saturday. You love
[1:32:34] him 24/7. And you give him your all and
[1:32:36] say, "God, help me. Let me be like Paul.
[1:32:40] I have suffered the loss of everything
[1:32:42] that I might win Christ." Let me tell
[1:32:44] you something. You put everything else
[1:32:46] as loss so that you can serve Christ.
[1:32:50] that I may know him in the power of his
[1:32:53] resurrection.
[1:32:56] Amen.
[1:32:58] Couple more things on the token. I love
[1:33:00] this token.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; It means you've been accepted. Praise
[1:33:04] the Lord. A lot of people might not like
[1:33:06] you. They might not accept you in their
[1:33:08] circles.
[1:33:12] The bank might not accept your
[1:33:13] application for a loan for the house
[1:33:15] that you wanted. We never know. This may
[1:33:19] not be the job you don't get that you
[1:33:21] wanted, but I'm here to tell you that if
[1:33:23] you want eternal life and you come the
[1:33:25] way that you're supposed to come, when
[1:33:27] God gives you the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:29] Ghost, he forgives you of your sins.
[1:33:31] That means you have been accepted in the
[1:33:33] beloved. You have been accepted by
[1:33:36] Almighty God. You have not been
[1:33:37] rejected. Not only that, but God has
[1:33:40] sealed you. That means he has put you in
[1:33:42] the car. Amen. And he has closed the
[1:33:44] door. And Amen. You are going to make it
[1:33:47] to your eternal destination.
[1:33:50] You're protected. You're sealed. Amen.
[1:33:54] If you have arrived, then you are
[1:33:57] sealed. You are sealed in.
[1:34:03] In whom also after ye have believed, you
[1:34:06] were sealed with that Holy Spirit of
[1:34:08] promise, which is the earnest of our
[1:34:11] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:34:13] purchased possession until the praise of
[1:34:16] his glory. Remember, you've got the
[1:34:18] earnest. Brother Bam says that's like
[1:34:19] the down payment.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; You got the down payment on it. Amen.
[1:34:24] Until the redemption of the purchased
[1:34:27] possession. In other words, when God
[1:34:29] says, "Now I'm coming to redeem what I
[1:34:32] bought." How many believe God's going to
[1:34:34] do that? All the saints and the graves,
[1:34:37] Ivan, all those that are filled with the
[1:34:38] Holy Ghost. Amen. All of our loved ones
[1:34:41] that have been filled with the Holy
[1:34:42] Ghost, God will come and he'll say,
[1:34:44] "There's my possession. I have bought
[1:34:46] them on Calvary all the way from Abel
[1:34:48] all the way through all of them. He's
[1:34:51] going to come and redeem us at that
[1:34:52] time." What a time that's going to be.
[1:34:56] How many believe? Oh, I'm going to have
[1:34:57] the time of my life. I'm having the time
[1:34:59] of my life now. I can't imagine what
[1:35:01] I'll do when I got my new body.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to jump from here all the way
[1:35:07] up there to the balcony, folks. We're
[1:35:09] going to leap over wall. We're going to
[1:35:11] leap and jump.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Man, if you can have
[1:35:17] joy shouting like that here, what's it
[1:35:20] going to be like over there?"
[1:35:22] What do you think it's going to be like
[1:35:23] if this is just a down payment and we
[1:35:25] can enjoy the down payment this much?
[1:35:27] Hallelujah.
[1:35:29] What is that earnest? Or it's like a
[1:35:31] quarter. Amen. If you're starving to
[1:35:33] death, somebody gives you a quarter and
[1:35:34] you know that's the purchasing power.
[1:35:37] All I can tell you is give me another
[1:35:39] one cuz I want to buy that good baloney
[1:35:40] to put on the bread.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; How many likes a good baloney sandwich?
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; One don't.
[1:35:51] You didn't have too much of it, did you?
[1:35:53] Said now you don't like it anymore.
[1:35:59] I am weak,
[1:36:02] but thou art strong. Cuz I just got to
[1:36:04] cook me a hot dog once in a while,
[1:36:06] folks. And put it on there and put some
[1:36:07] ketchup, mustard. I'm an American,
[1:36:09] folks, and I like my hot dogs.
[1:36:14] And my bologoney. I do don't do
[1:36:16] bologoney much, but I do something.
[1:36:19] Amen.
[1:36:21] Amen. I'm going to rejoice about
[1:36:23] something else. I told you a few weeks
[1:36:25] ago about these pains in my gut. Had me
[1:36:27] very concerned. Very concerned. What in
[1:36:30] the world? You're not supposed to have
[1:36:32] that. Won't go away. But here now, since
[1:36:34] I've told you, I've had a few spells
[1:36:36] here and there, but I'm here to tell
[1:36:37] you. Amen. When you're when you're going
[1:36:40] through that, it isn't just all the joys
[1:36:41] you have in faith. God, I believe you're
[1:36:43] my healer. But when it ain't there
[1:36:45] anymore and you're feeling good, you
[1:36:47] rejoice. Say, "Hallelujah.
[1:36:50] I'm thankful to feel good.
[1:36:53] Woo!
[1:36:55] I've arrived. It is not there anymore.
[1:36:57] It's not bothering me anymore."
[1:37:04] That's reason to rejoice.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; When you get in possession of it, when
[1:37:08] you arrive at the place that you're
[1:37:09] looking for. Amen. Sometimes the
[1:37:11] journey's a little rough, but when you
[1:37:12] get there, you can have a good time.
[1:37:15] Amen. People will go try to go to that
[1:37:16] perfect place, that perfect vacation
[1:37:19] spot. We're finally on the beach. I'm
[1:37:21] finally on this rest. I'm finally doing
[1:37:22] Oh, I'm finally got that place. You
[1:37:24] ought to be happy then,
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; cuz that's what we're going to do when
[1:37:28] we get over there. All this rustle and
[1:37:30] pussle and all this here that we have to
[1:37:31] do with
[1:37:35] hand in hand, church, we're all going to
[1:37:38] go hand in hand. Evening light
[1:37:40] tabernacle. Paul will come up with his
[1:37:42] people every all those who come up. I
[1:37:45] wonder if our pastor won't come up with
[1:37:46] his group and we'll go in together.
[1:37:49] How's that sound?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Hand in hand. Enjoy.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; The splendor of youth,
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; heaven. And we're going to have a good
[1:37:59] time.
[1:38:02] Amen. I'm about to hurt myself.
[1:38:07] My lower back. I'm still mortal. I can't
[1:38:11] wait to be immortal.
[1:38:14] Well, I can wait. But
[1:38:18] people are always saying, "Man, I can't
[1:38:19] wait to get to heaven when they get a
[1:38:21] little sickness." Oh, man. I got to go
[1:38:23] to the doctor.
[1:38:25] I got to go take you scared to death.
[1:38:27] Well, I thought you was wanting to go to
[1:38:29] heaven.
[1:38:33] I'm sorry, but right now to go there,
[1:38:36] unless the rapture, you know where you
[1:38:38] which way you got to go. So, be careful.
[1:38:40] Amen. I want to go but at the appointed
[1:38:43] time.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; How does that sound?
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Isn't that truth though?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; We do that. People do it. I I know we
[1:38:54] all tend to do that. Oh, I just wish I
[1:38:56] could go home. I can't wait to go. Be
[1:38:59] careful what you say with your mouth.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "Sure, we want to go home."
[1:39:10] when the Lord gets ready. Okay, where we
[1:39:13] at? Praise the Lord.
[1:39:19] So, you can be just as happy with the
[1:39:22] quarter as you could with the loaf of
[1:39:24] bread. Just as happy. And how many
[1:39:28] believes that
[1:39:31] he said if you another type now last
[1:39:33] type and we'll let you go. Last types
[1:39:36] said if you went out in the ocean and
[1:39:38] you got a spoonful of water, put it in
[1:39:40] your mouth and swallowed it and it's
[1:39:42] just a little spoonful. Ain't that
[1:39:44] right?
[1:39:45] Every chemical of that ocean is in that
[1:39:49] spoonful.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how many believe that when you
[1:39:54] get the Holy Ghost, when you get the
[1:39:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost, every
[1:39:59] chemical of heaven is in you. That's why
[1:40:03] we're gathered together in heavenly
