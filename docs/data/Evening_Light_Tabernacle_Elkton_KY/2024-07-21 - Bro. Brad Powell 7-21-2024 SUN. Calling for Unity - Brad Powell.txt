========================================

from cover to cover tells us how what will happen and what our faith should be maybe I can't live it doesn't make it the truth if they would have simply just stayed with the truth read it and believed it where would we be 20 centuries later I don't think we'd be in the position we're at this morning but I was thinking in uh the 14th chapter of John this uh I'll just read a few scriptures here and these scriptures here I I read the I I mean my Bible's all T apart I I read this gospel a lot but this is let your hearts not be troubled believe you in God and believe also in me so Jesus is telling you to believe in him no matter what happens out there in the world what's going on in your heart or life this morning just simply believe him because he's God this morning and in my in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would not have told you I go to prepare a place for you fact right there if you've got the faith of Jesus Christ abiding in you this morning that promise is settled with you this morning you're not going to doubt no matter what your circumstances are you're not going to doubt that scripture this morning you're going to apply it every day to your life you're going to go and apply it you're just not going to disbelieve and he goes on to say and if I go prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you onto myself that where I am that you may be also and whether I go go you know that the way excuse me I'm I'm not reading that and whether I go you know and the way you know so and this whole time walking the Earth Jesus showed them the way he gave them the word on what they should believe and even his disciples in the end wavered in the end and he just simply told him to believe and that's all we have to do is believe and whether I go you know the way you know and then you we all know what Thomas said Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest how can we know the way and Jesus said to him I am the truth and I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh to the father but by me and that scripture right there is divided the whole world this morning because you can't get there any other way than through Jesus Christ this morning you can fight I mean they can fight you over it they can kill you over it they might not choose to believe that but that's what tears the world apart that's simple scripture right there you can't bring any other religion through the word of God and get it through that scripture it's not going to happen this morning if you know me you should have known my father also from hence forth you know him and have seen him and I'm I'm going to stop my I could I'd wind up reading this whole chapter this morning but you know and then we know what Peter said and then Jesus said when you've seen the father you've when you've seen me you've seen the father but if you would turn with me to um uh Cor I don't lose this page out of my Bible turn with me to Corinthians the uh 15th chapter this morning I shouldn't say that you know like the brother was saying you know when you you can study all night you can you can do everything but if God's not in it it's not going to prosper you just got to you know the hardest thing I ever learned is that you you got to be willing just to let go sometimes and that's the hardest thing to do but th this is the this is the quote from this morning on the July 21st it goes back to acts the 27th chapter and it talks about uh this it talks about the journey Paul made to get to Rome and I'll just read the the it comes I'm not going to go to acts but after a long absence Paul Paul stood forth and Miss to them and said s you should have hearkened on me so Paul told him not to set sail that he that there was going to be trouble if they did they didn't believe him so there goes back to Faith they didn't have enough faith in Paul to believe what he had to say have not loose from CRE and to have gained this harm and lost but I now exhalt you to be of good chair for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night an angel of God whom whose I am and whom whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou might thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God has given thee all them that sell with thee wherefore sir be of good share I for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told to me and I was thinking with all the storm and everything that's going on Paul gave him this word this he told them the truth and I was just thinking that when they even Shipwrecked or before they Shipwrecked the sailors were trying to get off the boat so I mean no matter what there's those that are going to believe and those that aren't going to believe and this is what brother brandham had to say I'm not going to read this this whole page here but it goes back to what was on the board today that was on the projector today this morning about faith says faith is just positive as your eyesight or my feelings to know this desk is there so simply faith is just believing God's word it's positive and everything that it does you don't have to be Ed at frankly it'll be good if you're just a little more simple about it than than what you really are that's right it's just something that you know it's going to be that's all why they couldn't nothing move it out of your way you know it's going to happen nothing can take that can take it out if the doctor stands there and says you're going to die the next hour and you knew that you were going going to get well you was going to get you might as well tell you to cover all over the cancer and left the eaten through you wouldn't scare you one bit no sir now that's faith and I'm not going to read the whole thing but that's what I'm simply saying this morning no matter what the circumstances are no matter what the situations are this morning if you have real Bible Faith you're just going to believe it because it's God's word and he settled it with you this morning and I'm I was just going to read out of the Corinthians the U 15th chapter here I'll try not to read it I'm not going to read this whole chapter it's 58 verses I might jump around in it but this is where Paul's talking about certain things in this chapter he says moreover Brethren I declare on this is the 15th chapter of First Corinthians moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received and wherein stand by which you also are saved if you keep in memory what I have preached unto you unless you have believed in vain it's no different for us this morning the same thing applies to us we have the whole truth as is revealed for the age that we live in we have to do the same thing in our age that Paul's disciples had to do in his age for I have delivered unto you first of all which I also received how Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of sephus and the 12 and after he was seen of about 500 Brethren at once whom the greater part remain onto this present but some have fallen asleep and then he goes on explaining all these things and I'm jumping down to about the 12th verse here and it says now if Christ preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you there be no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen and if Christ not be risen then you're preaching Vain and your faith is also vain my thought being here it's not vain everything that you believe is going to come up is going toen happened and it goes on to say y we have found false witness in God because you have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so be that dead not rise if the dead not rise then Christ then is not Christ raised and if Christ not be raised your faith is in vain and are you yet in your sins so basically everything that we believe is based on this one simple principle did he or did he not rise on that day is he risen or isn't he risen and every Christian here this morning or every Christian for the last 20 centuries has to have that Revelation deep in their heart this morning has it been made real to you that Jesus Christ has saved you and filled you with his presence this morning you know I know I say that a lot but as I see the world the way it is this morning it's the one simple truth that the world needs this morning is a living savior a living God has risen this morning morning he is more than able to abide in your heart and life this morning and we just simply have to believe in and take faith above I'm I'm losing my train of thought here but the one thing the simplest thing I could say this morning is Faith's not going to fail you on that day if you honestly believe that God has done something for you don't be afraid to tell other people that God's done don't be able to be afraid to live what God's done for you don't be afraid to do the things that God leads you to do this morning I the other thing I was thinking about this morning we we have more than able the promises that are for us this morning are more than able any promises in this Bible I firmly believe that God is more than able to provide it for us this morning and I it goes to say what brother Brandon was saying what no matter what the circumstances I'll finish with the simple thought no matter what your circumstances are this morning here this morning or what my circumstances are I know that God is more than Able by the Revelation that he's given me by the word of God that's in my heart that he's more than able to meet those needs this morning and I don't question it anymore I just simply believe it and that's what I think that's the one thing about this age that we live in this morning you got to get past the you got to get past all your insecurities all your issues all your problems and just simply walk out in faith and believe it if that's basically where we're at this morning you just simply got to believe that you believe and not so so easily be shaken Brother David this morning I was thinking of that little chorus that brother John le Fontaine used to sing the word is working mightily in me no matter what the circumstance what I feel or see the word is working mightily in me you believe that this morning amen let's stand this morning and it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and pray you come hungry this morning brother Thomas is gone brother Brad's going to be ministering for us here in just a little while and amen we're just looking for an awesome time in the Lord this morning and amen let's sing that

in here just a minute I'm going to tell you we're going to try to do a little bit of uh teaching more this morning so did y'all bring a snack it won't be too bad thank you musicians appreciate it you know brother brandom I was reading there and I was I was reading about teaching and he said you know Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous he said you know it's a kind of walking on thin ice we call it by the time I was reading this brother berer text me and said we won't be there today I thought oh Lord Pastor is not going to be here and I'm going to try to teach he said but he said we just may feel that way maybe at this point in time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what I think to a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing he said but teaching goes beyond that he says teaching goes beyond that especially to the church and he says now preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places the man positionally in what he is I want to know what I am who I am and he says teaching places a positionally and what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until we positionally we know what we are so we're going to take our time this morning and and do a little teaching if we might and I don't think we'll be long at all you know I I'm not longwinded but if the holy spirit moves we'll just keep moving okay so you keep pulling I keep keep teaching preaching what however it goes so um turn in your bibles if you would to Genesis 2 and we're also going to read in Revelations 19 read from 2 places brother Bor also let me know brother John was needing prayer this morning are you feeling better he's feeling better we're going to continue to hold him up in prayer the devil's just trying to put a licking on his ticker and and uh we're just not going to accept it you know we're going to just pray that it's pulse and blood pressure and circulatory system God made it all you know it's miles and miles and miles of arteries and veins and miles of it that runs through our bodies and if a man can make if God can make a man's body with thousands of miles of arteries and n and nerves and vessels he can sure fix one little valve or one little tick I mean he we know he's better than that so we're just going to keep believing for for brother John's healing there um as we look in Genesis chapter 2 and and we'll read at verse 21 I want to just read to you something that the prophet said he said let the Holy Spirit he said let the Holy Spirit Lord bring these people to a full surrender to God that the great father of the Lord Jesus Christ sanctify them soul body and spirit and place them into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ for the marriage of the Lamb is at hand and his bride hath made herself ready oh Lord may this be the night of preparation for tomorrow may be the the day we meet him and you know I thought if if we could live every day with this very thought in mind every time we wake up when we go to bed if we could live with this very thought in mind that tomorrow may be the day that we meet him we would all probably live a little more consecrated we would live a little more dedicated we would live a little more sure of what we believe in in the way we live so Genesis chapter 2 verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and I I I read that first time it hit me and since I I've read this a thousand times but it said he closed up the flesh instead thereof I thought that way nothing from the outside could get to the inside did you think about that we can't allow the outside stuff to imp penetrate and and dwell within us we need to be closed up with God Almighty full of the Holy Spirit and let the other stuff stay on the outside and he said and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man and Adam I thought it was it striking says this is bone of my bone this is Flesh of My Flesh this is this is important to me this is something special to me this is not just something that God has placed here but now this is mine God took it from me and made me somebody think about that therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave we know what that means to hold on to not let go to to hold it precious and tight unto his wife that they shall be made what one flesh all right turn with me to Revelations chapter 19 and verse five and the voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it was the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of mighty Mighty thunderings now I want you to hold on to that Mighty thunderings saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife might be ready his wife thinks she may love him his wife looks at other men ah well it got you attention didn't it no it says his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she would be a raid and fine linen think about this fine Ren linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints now brother brandham told us and he tells it makes it very clear that the Garment that she's wearing is nothing more than the Holy Ghost she's wearing a garment covered in the Holy Ghost that's the life she's living that's how she hath made herself ready and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are true saints of God no falsehood there that's just plain black and white English right there thank you King James let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we just want to tell you this morning how much we love you we appreciate you we thank you Lord for the word you've given us and for the direction you've given us and we trust this morning Lord that you would speak to our hearts you know we're a room full of Christians here and we love you Lord but so many times we find ourselves falling short each one of us we have our battles we have our challenges and Lord we need words of encouragement words that that that push us beyond what we are our limitations are here on the earth so that we know that we're a Heavenly being and we're waiting for for a for a Heavenly bridegroom to come catch a bride away and Lord as we prepare ourselves we ask that you would speak to us give us the words of wisdom and and the words that we need to make sure that we have made ourselves ready and Lord we just want to tell you we love you we lift brother John up to your throne to the throne of of Mercy this morning to the throne of healing we just ask that you would be the great physician that you're the Creator the maker of the body and so we know that you're more than the Healer also Lord we just commit him to you now Commit This Day and the service into your hands in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated this morning I want to speak to you this morning on calling for Unity calling for Unity now you know uh we seen last week after president Trump and the failed assassination on former president Trump what did both parties start doing they start started calling for Unity and these parties said we got to S down we got to tone down we got to pull everybody together we got to find ourselves getting together and and put away some of this hardship put away some of this name calling well you know for them no doubt that's going to be a short-lived a short-lived experiment we might say because in politics that's exactly what they have they have fighting they have bickering they have mudslinging all the ETC you know throw it out there they're going to they're going to put something on somebody else but brothers and sisters there's another calling for Unity that is taking place that calling of unity that's taking place between the bridegroom and his bride and the word tells us blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these things are are sayings are the true sayings of God and in this calling of unity there won't be any murmuring there won't be any complaining there won't be any fighting there won't be any bickering there won't be none of that so the Bible tells us let us be glad and rejoice let us be glad and rejoice this morning and to give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb Has Come For she hath made herself ready so there is a you know the prophet talked about a deep calling to the Deep Well I want to tell you this morning there's a Heavenly bridegroom calling down to a Heavenly bride and she's he's telling her get yourself ready don't fall short get yourself ready I'm I'm coming back now I looked at the word half you know we look at the English language and a lot of words mean different things and I thought I knew what it meant but I had to look it up just to make sure the bride his wife hath made herself ready it says half is an old-fashioned third person singular form of the verb have have so brothers and sisters think about that the bride she hath made herself ready what is that saying to us it says that this bride she's living the life she's got what it takes she's got the word she's got she's ready to go she's not looking around walking around this life in confusion or worried or wondering or trying to figure out who she is she knows who she is she has identified herself with as the Bride of Jesus Christ the one who the bridegroom is coming back for are you with me so let us be glad and rejoice listen to this Unity I'm laying a foundation here Unity Unity is being together or at one with someone or something it's the opposite of being divided pretty simple right but what we find where we find ourselves right now as Christian Christians as bride there is a divide between here and here between the Heaven and the Earth there is a gap there but by Jesus Christ and the stripes and the blood that was shed on Calvary and before the foundation of the world you were on his mind and because of that that Gap has now been bridged and there is a unification taking place between the bridegroom and the bride because she knows who she is I can hear him do you hear him this morning Unity this is a word it says that's for togetherness or Oneness it says when the north won the Civil War it assured the unity of the United States sports teams wear uniforms to show Unity their fans wear their colors for the same reason even if it's red and got a cardinal on it we know where you stand bless your heart the military they wear uniforms to show their what in a unit and those guys are in a unit they look alike they March alike they're in Step they're in tune they think alike they sleep alike they eat alike they do everything alike why because they are in in a unit and they become one people get to bickering that's not unified bickering disorganization there's no Unity you know sometimes in a group it's hard to get people unified somebody's always got a better idea somebody's got a different way of doing it I think it don't work that way with God if you're going to be unified you better get your own stinking thinking out of the way if you're going to be unified with God you better make sure you're doing it the way he wants to do it and live the life he wants to live Unity listen to this an un undivided or unbroken completeness or totality with nothing wanted you want to talk about a unified experience with God we live in such a place we can live in such a place with God that we're so close we're so tied to him that there's no unbroken and there is such a complete he looks down he says you know what I love you so much you're going to want for nothing Unity my favorite one the quality of being fused into one you know a welder can take two pieces of Steel that you can't you can't break you can't bend you can't dent and he can take it he can put enough energy with a welding rod between two pieces of Steel that he can fuse those together and you cannot pull it apart why because there's something that's happened and that's the way it is with a marriage or it should be that way in a marriage brother Brown tells us he says when a Christian first saved his face is he's he's turned towards Christ but then he's got something to do on his for himself that's where it gets sticky that's where it gets hard you say he says see you think the next thing he has to sanctify himself from all unclean habits he has to lay aside every weight he has to get all the things out of his life why because because it's the bride making herself ready she's got to make herself ready and he begins to tell the story and we're going to go into this story in detail so stay with me it's one of the greatest in the message as far as I'm concerned and he tells a story about the the little girl out in the west and he said we're going to go out there and rehearse this for a little while and he said there was this armor and Swift Packing Company and he said the armor and Swift Packing Company he said they come out there and they would buy cattle and they would buy ranches he he said they were so wealthy they were they were worth lots of money buying up all small ranches and had millions and millions and millions of Acres out there they even had uh Herford cattle and he said they had enough they had enough money and enough Acres that they had their own railroad system to move cattle from one pasture to another pasture so might we say he owned the cattle on a thousand hills this man the armor Swift Packing Company owned the cattle on a thousand hills and he says they had this big Ranch and and and one day out there and the foreman out there the superintendant had four or five daughters now these four or five daughters out there they all they all hungry to get married you know how it is when you get a certain age you start looking you start wanting you start having a desire for companionship and so they were looking for to get married and he said there they was but the the big armor son was going to visit the ranch so the son of the the armor and Swift Packing Company was going to visit the ranch and he said he was a young single man and all of the girls were sure that they were going to grab this boy up they were sure sounds kind of like the church world they're sure that they're going to grab him up they're sure that they've got Christ the message world they're sure hm and they was getting ready getting ready for him to come they was making everything ready now he's talking about these four or five girls they was making ready too think about this you know just well I'm just going to say it you find out that your son's girlfriend's coming over you'll see him sweep floors like you've never swept in his life I don't know how I know that but but here they were they were getting ready getting ready to meet him they got all doled up they were going out there he was going to visit this Ranch and they got all doled up and dressed up and and they was wanting to get out there and catch his attention and that's what the church world's doing they're trying to catch the attention stay humble bride stay humble and he said they got got out there and they was going out to meet him they put on this frontier days and he said they had their little dresses on with fringes and 44s on their side and they were shooting and hooping and hollering and and they had their little hats on they were going to be real westerners because one of them was going to get this boy one of them wanted the son of the man that owned the cattle on a thousand hills but there was a little cousin there was a little cousin a little a little C cousin girl that had been orphaned because her parents her mom and her dad had both died and there was this little orphan girl and the prophet said that she was almost a slave to all there was out there now let me tell you we can relate to that because there was a time that we were alienated and found ourselves as slaves to the things of this world you were a slave to the devil and all his tactics and I hope none of you still are but here she was a slave to all that there was and she she had to do all of the Dirty Work she did it all she did the washing of the dishes no doubt she did she did sweeping of the floors she done all the laundry all the stinking Dirty Laundry of those three or four or five other girls her job she had no clothes the prophet said she had to take hand me downs and so when a Time come for this young man to arrive they all got in their Buck boards they all set away to go down to the station because they wanted to receive him isn't that the way it is everybody wants to receive him everybody says I want him and they think they're doing what they should do to catch his attention he said they were shooting guns they were hooping and hollering they were the horses were nicker and they were racing and they were running around and and they finally got him brought him out to the ranch and they at night they had a big shindig now listen a big shindig they were having entertainment when church becomes entertainment we've missed the mark when our personal lives become entertainment to God God I hope you like this let me show you what I can do that's Entertainment God is not pleased with entertainment brothers and sisters God does not want our entertainment he wants our relationship he wants a life with you he wants a love affair with you and he said here was this little girl she had all this rough work to do she didn't go to the party let me tell you she wasn't invited to the party she wasn't welcomed at the party nor would she have been comfortable at the [Music] party if you find yourselves in places that make you uncomfortable and you question while you're there you better leave well some of you believe believe that because it is easy to find yourself in questionable situations even though you're not doing anything wrong the company the entertainment the rally the hooping the hollering the riding the buckboards the shooting is that really where you should be so all at once this young man this boy the the night was uh was soon to be over three days they did this partying hey this was a big shind dig they put it on right they had a three-day Revival three days of meetings and he said the supper was over and they they had all had their dances each one of these girls all prettied up can you just imagine watching them flicking eyes at him you're so handsome you got the prettiest eyes look at those muscles what you think about me that's what she did oh boy I'm in trouble but here come this boy they'd all puttied up these girls and here's the little cousin stop it here's the little cousin sitting over in the mess hall he said after supper was over and she's sitting over there and she says I better go throw the dishw waterer out and so she got up she walks outside with the dish pan to throw the dishw water out and she looks up and leaned up against the Corral hello and she the prophet says she began to look and she took that little dish pan that she had and she covered herself up because of the ragged clothes she had on and she began to to back herself up and and he's sitting there and he's looking at her and he says hello you know sometimes for us it's when we're at our lowest time in our life sometimes it's when we're at our filthiest and were full of rags and wretched and ugly before the world and sometimes when you got your head hung so low that you look up and you hear Hello aren't you thankful that you heard hello hello it's you I'm thinking of hello and she was so ashamed here was the son of the owner of the ranch and here she was with this dish pan and she begins to back away and he said says Don't Be Afraid don't be afraid of me you know it's easy when you're not when you're not quite right and you're dirty and you're filthy and you're wretched it's it's a little easy to be afraid of An Almighty God but he says don't be afraid I don't be afraid I want to tell you something and he says I want to tell you I came out here for one purpose I came out out here for one purpose he says I come out here to find a wife let me tell you do you realize that God before the foundation of the world for eons of time he had one purpose in mind and that purpose was to find the Bride of Jesus Christ he went to the ends of the Earth he scoured the world over knowing I got a bride that's going to be ready in that bride age she's going to make herself ready I've come here for one purpose to find a wife and listen what he says I've been looking everywhere now keep in mind for three days women were throwing themselves at him they were begging him to come begging him to come eat supper begging him to come into the house of God for three days they were working on him over and over but he says I didn't want to marry any of the girls back there in that City because what I was wanting I want to find a real wife he said of course all that I've seen I've been noticing you around here of all that I've seen I've been noticing you around here can you imagine as God sits on the throne and he looks down and he looks down over the Earth and there's millions and millions and millions of people and he says after all I've seen I notice you [Music] I noticed you and I found out you're a cousin is that right she said yes sir that's right he said I want to ask you something can you imagine I want to ask you something will you marry me I just threw the dish waterer out I just threw the filth and the M out I just now got my my dishes clean and now you want to make the first question you're going to ask me is will you marry me what a proposal that God don't care how dirty how filthy how wretched your life was if you'll just clean up he wants to marry you thank you Lord will you marry me the prophet said she didn't know what to do she was so beset she didn't know how to answer the man he said I can just imagine listen to what he says I can imagine how she felt don't you when the sinner a good for nothing a good for nothing and Christ said I want you for mine how could you ever come to somebody like me how could you ever say I'll give you a home in heaven how could you ever say I'll save you such a wretch as me how could it ever be but he did it but he did it she said sir I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to make a wife for a man like you brothers and sisters we are not worthy to be the wife of Jesus Christ because of the things we used to do she says the things I've done nothing about them I'm poor he says but you are my choice you are my choice brothers and sisters he saw something in that little girl that was different something about her she walked different she talked different she looked different she dressed different than everybody else in the town she stood out amongst the pack not because she was dominant not because she was the prettiest not because she was the wealthiest but because she had character and God is coming back for a bride with character even though brothers and sisters think about it even though in her condition she had not reached her full potential the potential was there none of us have reached our full potential but God knows the potential is there and he says I Choose You God knew we wasn't worthy do you think it surprised him when I was dipping skull you enter reject whatever You' had problems with yeah alcohol pornography whatever it was you had problems with do you think he didn't know that do you I wasn't worthy but there's nothing I could do you know I could I couldn't get rid of that skull on my own Tommy I couldn't do it I tried I threw that stuff out of the window so many times just to drive five miles down the road and spend $5 to get another can yeah I couldn't do it on my own but he chose me he chose me it wasn't what I could do it was what he could do it was him working through me not me working on him it's him that pulls it's him that calls she said I I I I I don't I I can't can you imagine her stammering and quivering and shaking all over as she walks back and tries to avoid the situation I can't do this and he says don't look at your clothes can you imagine don't look at your clothes don't look at the condition that you're in I look at what you are give me my hand that's God in our lives he don't care how much money you got he don't care what you look like he don't care what your bad habits are he looks at what you are and what you will be he knows who you are it's you that's got to realize it it's you that has to get to the potential don't look at your clothes he said will you marry me and an agreement was made one year from this day I'll return and watch what what he said you be ready have the wedding garment on he didn't say I'm coming back in a year and if you still love me he didn't say I'm coming back in a year and if if if you're still washing dishes that ain't what he said he said be ready what is wrong with the church that we can't get in our minds to be ready be ready have your wedding garment on EXA he says I will return and marry you right here on these grounds just do what God tells us to do I'll return for you he says I'll take you to Chicago you will live in a castle over there you will live in a castle all this dishwashing will be over all the things that are hindering you here all the Toral all the the trials all the Temptations all that's going to be over we're going to a castle not a castle made of stone but streets made of gold and Pearl and Sardis and topaz and onx and alabaster that's our God he owns a cattle on a thousand hills be ready be ready all the years she worked slaving and saving her money 75 cents a day she didn't go out and buy snicker bars she wasn't going to the Ball Game she wasn't going to the rodeo I maybe you went to the rodeo last week you did praise the Lord I that's fine that just will come out but she was saving her money to buy a wedding gown she wanted to be ready because in her mind it was a Sign Sealed Delivered deal he told me one year 365 days from now he's coming back I've got to get my dress I got to get my veil I got to get my life just right because I want him to be happy when he sees me I want him to want to take into open arms when he sees me I can't be living any way that I want I got to be living the way he wants and I'm getting my wedding gown I'm buying my wedding gown I got to make everything ready that was her thoughts ready ready ready and her cousins they laughed at her they laughed at her because she was making herself ready she was reading her Bible what are you doing what are you doing I'm I'm getting ready why aren't you eating you hadn't eaten in three days what are you doing I'm fasting I'm reading my Bible I'm fasting I'm praying what is different about you I'm in love I'm getting myself ready because he's coming back in one year I'm getting myself ready I don't want to be doing the things of the world and she this her cousin looked at her said you silly little thing he wasn't coming back for you he didn't mean that he would never marry a girl like you you know sometimes just be honest that's the way we feel how could God have anything to do with me why would he marry somebody like me why would he take me in why would he love me when I'm so unlovable well me and Tommy are unlovable but why why would he love me and saids so it come late in the evening and they begin to Mock and make fun of her again and she stood right there in the door waiting there was no detering her she stood right in the door waiting they began to mock her he's not coming you know he's not coming he told me he'd be here in one year and I got an hour left I got an hour left so I'm going to keep pressing I'm going to keep waiting I'm going to keep being ready because there's potential there on 45 minutes left I'm going to keep waiting I'm going to keep pressing I'm going to be ready because there's potential there 30 minutes I'm going to keep waiting are you with me I'm going to keep pressing I'm going to keep I'm going to keep on doing what I'm doing I'm going to keep getting myself ready because there's potential and he said it come down to 10 minutes left on she didn't turn away and walk away from all that she had known why are people turning away from the message of the hour they're not ready they're not ready they're not going to be in that bride I didn't say it he said it 10 minutes left as she sitting there keep pressing keep being ready they laugh to the very last minute they laughed and mocked and called her everything but in a distance A Sound of Thunder could be heard I can imagine them four or five sisters said we better get inside a rain's are coming oh let me tell you there's a rain a coming but it wasn't Thunder it wasn't lightning it was the sound of horses coming to sweep her away and she stood there in the door and he said the the wheels and the sand started turning under the wheels of them horses and under the wheels of that carriage and about that time he pulled up there and that little bride that had made herself ready she jumped off that porch she jump jumped off that portion through a rose trellis and threw herself into the arms of The Man Who Loved Her there's going to be a day that comes when we're going to throw ourselves off the porch we're going to throw ourselves through the trellis of life and into the arms of the greatest lover that the world has ever [Music] [Applause] known there's a Heavenly Union taking place in this hour but we got to be ready we got to be ready we can't be put on we can't be gimmicks you know there's a lot of gimmicks out there there's a lot of gimmicks out there that want to act like they're the real deal but they don't have the Garment the Holy Ghost is not working through them it's not moving in their lives it's not moving in their homes it's not moving in their churches we can't be a gimmick we can't have any put on but we got to be genuinely filled with the Holy Ghost our garments without spot or wrinkle but listen the problem is this the problem is everybody want this Cinderella story that I've been telling you about everybody wants to be Cinderella but they're living like Cruella Deville you young people called it Cruella [Music] Cruella oh I've seen 101 they live in any way they want to they live in the life of whatever they want to do go wherever they want to go say whatever they want to say and they're still entertaining God hey I'm not talking about denominations I'm talking about around us we got to be careful churches around the message have got to be careful that their focus and their first love is Jesus Jesus Christ and not an entertainment I'm not here to fix the message I'm just here to fix me but I have to make sure I've got myself ready the prophet said we know that there's going to be a bride there's going to be a wedding supper up served in the skies that's sure to be as God is because it's his word so we know it's happening we know it's coming and he says we right now the Bride of Jesus Christ we've got all the materials on Earth right now to make ourselves ready notice he said she made herself ready I got the table I got the Bible what else do I need to make me ready what else do you need to make you ready I've got the table and I've got the Bible but do I put in the time he saidou see it's up to you you've got to do something you've got to overcome you've got to be the Overcomer that inherits all things he said you see because God can't push you through a little pipe and pull you out through the other side and say blessed is you that overcame because he's the one that done the pushing in that case but you got to be the one that makes decisions for yourself we've got to decide for ourselves I don't want to live the stinking life that I'm living and the doing the things that I'm doing that God does not approve of you got to make that decision we can't just say God take away everything well wouldn't that be easy everybody in the world would be the Bride of Jesus Christ there wouldn't be an addict there wouldn't be an alcoholic there wouldn't be a whoremonger but sometimes it takes some commitment on our part for God to come in and say here I'm going to help you but you're going to push you're going to push yourself through you're going to pull through this situation Abraham was promised a child and to maintain the promise for 25 years through the ups and the downs and The Valleys of Life do you realize that the children of Israel they were given a promise that they would have a promised land and they that everything they had but they fought and they fought and they fought to get that land Divine Healing the prophet said Divine Healing God has the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it it's easy to come up to be prayed for but do you accept it are you willing to take the exception that God I'm going to take what's mine mine mine you see God has Amazing Grace the prophet said and he can give you that Amazing Grace but you're going to fight for it you're going to fight for it now marriage he says in one sense is a type he says the Earthly marriage here is a type of the Heavenly marriage and let's go over it for you few moments he says to rehearse first thing that takes place in a natural marriage is this okay all right I'm gonna preach it anyway so might as well like it the first thing he says it takes place as in a natural marriage is a decision has to be made the young lady has to make a DE decision do I want this man do I want this man and he said and then that man has to say do I want this woman do I want this young woman he says there has to be a decision made she must be the only woman in the world that you love and he must be the only man in the world that you love and if it's not you've made a wrong wrong decision you see the problem lies in when people want to love God but they love something else too you see I love God on Sunday but on Monday that don't work a marriage whether it be here your home my home God Heaven to Earth to us a marriage has to be a full total commitment so during this time of courtship these deep conversations begin to take place these deep conversations take place to know that if this person is somebody you can tolerate why marry somebody you don't even like I never understood why a woman young woman would chase a man that is chasing Every Woman around town can somebody explain that to me who wants that filth who wants that disease yeah let's just put the rubber on the road who wants that no good Christian man wants that or woman wants that but there's deep conversations begin to take place and a a great poet said ultimately the bond of all companionship whether it in marriage or friendship is conversation you see sometimes we we get into a into a situation where we don't even converse with God how does he know if he likes you have you ever talked to him whoa pin drop you see if we're going to get into a proper love affair with Christ we have to talk we have to be able to share ourselves with him we have to have an active prayer life we have to have an active prayer life that is more than just a dinner table prayer oh God we we good at that God bless this food cuz I'm hungry but what about the times when we need to get along with God and find ourselves in a secret chamber where we can have a real love heartfelt conversation with god where you sit down and you share what happened to you today where you sit down and you ask for guidance for tomorrow you say well I I just get overwhelmed with time get up earlier you know people do in life what they want to do if you want to talk to God you can get up and pray if you don't you can sleep in that's your choice we done talk we done hit decisions that's your choice you can do what you want to do but communication is the key we need private conversations with God you know what I've noticed when my boys take the cell phone and they talking to somebody and they walk right on past us and go outside and sit on the back porch they ain't talking to their friend at school no no no for hours hours they talk well you did it too what are you looking at me like that four man I didn't know what a bedtime was when we were talking 2 3 4:00 in the morning I guess I better go sleep I got to get up in an hour why because it was a secret chamber it was a private time we were sharing our thoughts and our love and our intents with each other and that's what God wants from us he wants some passion in our lives you know what the number one cause of divorce is lack of communication you want to be divorced from God don't talk to him you want your marriage on the Rocks Don't Talk To Her don't communicate with each other and tell me if your lives don't start don't y'all be looking at each other we're not playing that game but don't talk don't communicate with each other don't share your daily experiences don't share your love and your thoughts with your spouse and see if you don't find yourselves growing apart and you think well we're just going through a a lull we're going through a spell and we all do but just see if it don't just get bigger and bigger if you don't put the put the put the end on it if you don't put the hammer down on it and say hey I need to talk to you have a little spat and don't make it right see what happens some of you's done that it ain't a fun road divorce number one cause lack of communication we don't talk so if we don't talk to God how are we ever going to know what God's wantan to do in our lives how are we ever going to know how much he loves us if we don't talk to him you know I don't go to to God and talk to him and say God give me this give me that give me that I just want him to know how I feel Lord I had a rough day today things went didn't go the way I thought they were this happened or that happened and you know what I find I don't have to ask but I start getting a feeling of peace I start getting a feeling of love and I start getting a feeling of compassion that he really cares he listens to me I don't have to pray some big Catholic CA Catholicism prayer a hell Mary or this I just say God this is what happened to me today help me Lord but the lack of communication there was a woman who went and met with an attorney and she told the attorney she said I want to divorce my husband and the guy the attorney says okay well let's start with a few questions and like what she asked well do you have any grounds yes we have about five acres out in the country she said no no no no he said no no no no I'm talking about do you have a grudge no we don't have one of those we got a nice wide carport and a storage shed well let me ask you in a different way do you have any complaints about him like what what does he beat you up oh no I'm up at least a half an hour before he is every day can you imagine that attorney well what about your role here he says do you ever wake up grouchy oh no when he's in a bad mood I let him sleep exasperated he finally asked why exactly do you want to get a divorce and she says well that guy just can't communicate did you get it she's the one that's not communicating it's an open line of communication that has to take place an open line of communication between you and God let's get back to our engagement here first thing you do he says are you going to serve the world or are you going to serve Christ you have to make your mind up what are you going to do are we going to serve God or are we going to serve the world what are we going to do he says because after that decision is made here comes the engagement now we're getting engaged now we're getting somewhere now we've got through the question do you like me or do you don't are you going to live for me or are you not am I the guy for you or am I not and God says am I your God or am I not and this goes on and he says but now you're at the engagement this is where right before the union can be made see we're not unified yet we're not unified yet we're still here and here and he says right here we're before the union could be made and he says but there has to be an engagement a pledge an engagement A Love [Music] Affair promises have to be made listen to these promises promises have to be made sweetheart if you'll marry me I promise I'll be loyal and true I will look upon no other woman I I'll look upon no other man and as a duty as a wife we'll have children I'll do my duty as a mother as a I'll be a housekeeper all these promises has to be made or should be in a correct wedding the commitment is made before the union are you with me you got to be ready before he comes back the commitment of is made he says when you come to Christ will you receive me into your kingdom I promise this is way we do God if you'll just accept me I promise I promise I'll love you I'll be true to you I'll serve you day and night if it's too bad we forget that he said I'll serve you day and night I'll fast I'll pray I'll be loyal I'll bring my tithings into the storehouse I don't know what it is with tithing but this is the third service and this has been my mind I was listening to somebody the other day and they made a great statement they said the person they were talking to a person about tying they said you don't even tell me about tying I give my 10% and he said well I tell you what you got you got an understanding of how tithing Works what you don't have is an understanding that all you have is God's it's not the 10% that's his just like everything else it's what you do above and Beyond what are you doing for others how are we serving others God gives us so so much every one of us sitting here is blessed beyond measure yeah let's give the Lord a hand we've been blessed we are worshiping we're serving God in a paid off building a probably a million doll building but what are we doing where is our missions where is our goal where is our vision how are we serving how are we helping what are we doing with the other 90 now we're getting in your back pocket he says I'll pray many times a day I'll do anything I'll pledge all of my love to you and he says that's exactly what you should do but that promise has to come from your heart he says look and I tell you the prophet can bring some stories in there that makes you wonder where in the world did he come up with this i' ha to been the woman he's talk The person he's talking about here he says if you ain't got any teeth you use false teeth he said but those false teeth are a substitution for the teeth you once had those teeth aren't connected to you yeah you take them out he said if you had an arm amputated you put on a false arm he said but that arm is actually not connected with you it's just stuck on you and he said when we take our pledge to Christ if we don't come part of him like a woman ought to be part of that man and a man part of that woman then we're artificial Christians yeah false teeth and a prosthetic limb an artificial Christians you'll never think about a prosthetic limb the same again will you an artificial Christian because you're not fully unified with him you're going through the motions you're acting you're putting on but yet you're not fully fused with him he says that's the way the churches are we're taking a name taking a name the Christian church and pretending to be the bride but it's artificial it's not connected in any way with Christ we're like an artificial tooth an artificial arm an artificial eye it's something that's artificial if we're just putting it on well you can't put on Christianity you got to be connected with it if a woman is not connected with a man in tress then it isn't her husband she must take a vow to live with him and she's Tak or she's taken a vow to live with him and she took a wrong vow she pledged to love him she said she loved him and she didn't do it that man's deceived now we see this in the natural all the time oh I love you I love you I want there's nobody else I want to live with I I want to live the rest of my life with you you're my darling you're my sweetheart it goes both ways men and women next thing you know she's with some other guy at the five five star or he's over here with some other woman at work come on church it was a false vow it wasn't a true love to begin with and we see it in the church world as well it's a false vow they I love you Lord I want to do everything for you come bless me Lord and they're watching filth in the house going to places they shouldn't go raising their kids out of church don't go to church somebody somebody help me this morning it's the truth Church my wife said how long are you going to preach on that until it gets fixed every time we go home how long you going to preach on coming to church until they start coming how long you going to preach on people not raising their kids right until they start raising them right why because it matters tomorrow you say well it ain't hurting nothing today it matters tomorrow when he comes back are we ready are your children ready he says but one thing you won't do you you may deceive your husband you may deceive your wife you may have give him a false vow you won't deceive Christ he knows if it's a heartfelt give my heart to you Lord that's how he know that's how he can look at you when you make a mistake and that's how he can look at you when you make a mistake and he can look and say I know you truly love me I know that you're in love with me so this little flaw that you had I forgive you I wipe it clean I can wipe the Slate clean you know it's hard for marriages to do that you let a man cheat on a woman she can't trust him is this the truth it takes years and years and years if ever for her to trust him again why why is that because we don't know Christ he knows he can't be deceived we can be deceived and to be deceived and lied to hurts as humans and we don't forget he says when the church has a ceremony and makes a promises she takes the bridegroom's name she's no longer the Church of the world she's the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ he says a great Universal Apostolic Christian Church she becomes part of Christ when she does that watch what happens when she does that and she gets rid of her old name her old Creeds her own doct do Doctrine and dogmas her own way of thinking he says what happens then is Christ injects into her his own Spirit I'm no longer Brad pal you're no longer John lter no longer Joe pit no longer Tommy Richmond but your misss Jesus Christ why because you've emptied yourself out you've dedicated your heart and you said Lord pour into me all that you are and that's what happens to the church he says the two are no longer Twain it's no longer the woman and the church but the two now have come together they are one they're Christ in you like my wife her name was lter but she's no longer lter in 1996 yeah she became pal and she's been pal ever since I found it a odid thing when I done some business with some Hispanics here a while back they don't change their names in Mexico I don't know if it's ever Spanish Nation or what but in Mexico they don't change their name they keep their name and just add to it or don't even add the husband's name and I thought wow is that a is that a Catholic thing what is that I'm trying to figure it out I don't know but I thought as I read this message message I don't want my own name I want his name to cover me because when his name covers me when his name covers you you have a new Authority about you you have a new way of living you has a new life that comes forth it's no longer my life no longer my desires no longer my wants but I want what he wants I want to see Souls saved I want to so see young people come to Christ I want to see the returning of Jesus Jesus God Almighty when you come to Christ you're no more of the world then you care not for the things of the world it's dead to you you become a different person you become a different personality and I like that you're a new creation you know when we got married in 96 I don't know who this is for but it's a lot of marriage going on in this service marriage for those that's been married those that's thinking marriage those that's too young to be married but marriage is important you know when when we got married we come together and we became one and you know what happened we begin to compliment each other now I don't mean I didn't say now honey I you you you you cook good cuz she didn't she cooked frozen pizza eight nights a week but when I I'm in trouble but when I say we complimented each other we would talk things out and things that I would say I'm so angry about this I want to do this I want to do that I want to I want to I want Reve she would say that's not the right thing man it's quiet do you people talk to each other when we had oh some some of you oh Lord when we have to make financial decisions I don't just go write checks Boogie wogie no I say honey what do you think we ought to do about this that's right you mean you asked your wife's opinion I I had I had somebody tell me it was a car salesman one time I was going to go buy a car and and I was talking to him and and uh I said I need to go talk to my wife he said you got to talk to your wife before you can write a check if I want to live tomorrow I will it's a communication it's a complimenting of each other when you become one things change your habits change change your thinking changes when you become one with Christ he has to become everything to you she became everything to me oh I loved her for the time we spent dating and courting and engagement but there was something different when she come to my house we walked into a new house together we no longer went back to our parents' house when we had had a squabble she didn't run to Mama's house that's right no we're big boys now big girls you work it out I don't know if she remembers this but I remember this she said oh Lord we had a little squabble we ain't been married six months you know how it is you going to fight fuss throw nah we didn't throw but she said I'm going to Mama's and she I'm going to Mama and she started grabbing stuff out I said you might as well take the whole dresser cuz don't come back if you're going over there this is our house we got to work out our problems mama don't need to know nothing some of you may not agree with that but let me tell you you get too many heads in a house you got problems you got sister Susie telling Sister Sister Sally how she needs to be talking to her husband you got problems you better keep your problems in your own house between you and her and figure out how to compliment one another and work together because that's what happens think about the church you and Christ become one you can't go sharing your trouble with the devil well I can't overcome Satan I can't overcome this I thought God would give me the strength but I just can't overcome it well you can't well come here let me tell you what you need you need to just do it more and more and more you see that's the way it works why would people take marriage counseling from people that have marriage problems why do people take dating advice from people who's never been married we're going to be here all day we just keeps coming but at a point in your time in your life Jesus has to become everything to you and there's a song that I just been singing and singing and I love it but it says some have made Jesus a game that they play and others a song that they sing but since I've met Jesus I'm happy to say that he has become everything to me when I wake up each morning he's right by my side at night he's my last thought in mind M for he's joy for each moment he's hope that Faith brings to me he's become everything oh he's everything that I need the first and the last the beginning the end to me he's become everything we might ought to try to sing at sometime but he's become everything he has to be first in your life so let me ask your husbands think before you answer answer I'm queuing you let me ask you now listen again think before you answer who comes first in your marriage is it you or your wife oh Lord I hope they say the right thing she comes first is that proper headship brother Steve is that right she comes first she comes before hunting she comes before fishing she comes before golfing or ball games her needs come before your needs I just tell on myself she knows I'll just tell on myself I wanted to go golfing this week Thursday was men's night I wanted to go golfing but you know she wasn't feeling well we had planned to do something together it got washed out she wasn't feeling well I said I'm not going to go golfing well you ought to go she said no I'll just stay here with you now honestly I want to go golfing but her needs were more important than my needs and I'm not lifting myself I'm Not tooting my own horn but I'm just saying sometimes we have to stop in process what is more important in a marriage what is more important is church more important than Sports is church more important than Social Hour is church more important than a family reunion now have we all failed sure we have but it's got to be a desire it's got to be a desire on the inside because that Spirit of unity that's taking place is changing amongst the people it's changing amongst the message it's changing in the secular world it's changing all around us I was talking to a a coworker of mine the other day about Worship in the church and we were talking he's a very educated brother he's a he's a he's a pharmacist and you know anybody that's been to school seven to eight years they they know a thing or two brother Josh because they've seen a thing or two and he's a pharmacist and we're we're talking and I said you know music has changed so much in the last few years and and I said people are graduating even around the message people are graduating away from the the hym books they're they're starting to to kind of get away from the hym books and I've been trying to figure this out but as you begin to watch and you begin to look and listen today's Music is More Christ centered it's more worship it's more praise it's more Victory with Christ in the center of it and and he agreed with me and he began to explain it to me this way now he he was a song leader he was in the UPC movement so he's been around a song or two and he said he and he explained it to me this way and it made so much sense he said listen he said years ago the music and the songs were horizontal they were about you they were about you think about it think about some of them old songs when we all get to heaven what a day that will be we can keep going on it's all centered about you it's horizontal you're not go you're just going on one level here he said but if you look and you listen to the songs today you'll find those songs are vertical they're connecting a people with God and God has now become the center of worship he's become the center of attention because there's a pool taking place and it's now you're connecting straight up and down with God and think about those songs that we sing now the new worship hymns the new songs that are sweeping it's about you and God and a relationship and a bride and a bridegroom and a return the church world didn't know a thing about a Rapture that's all they sing about why because it's a spirit of unity that's sweeping across the age here I'm G to find a place to stop this little girl just in the face of all of it he said upon the basis of his word that he would be back for her they got to laughing they put their hands around one another and danced around her can you imagine can you imagine the ridicu ridicule this young lady went through and she sing there and and they laughed and they said you poor silly kid and the prophet said she stood there without a blush in her you talk about knowing who you are you talk about believing in what you believe in you talk about living what you learn learned to live she stood there without a blush in her and she was holding her flowers standing there with her wedding garment all fixed up even though it was a struggle he said the bride had made herself ready and she kept holding her flowers and waiting they said I told you you was wrong he ain't coming I got five more minutes he'll be here you see we got to get such determination in our lives that no matter what happens hell or high water he's coming no matter what it takes for me to get myself ready no matter what I got to kick out of my house no matter what I got to change in my home no matter what I got to do in my daily living he's coming and I'm going to be ready they laughed and she said oh it's just about time and the old talk clock ticked five minutes and they heard the horses galloping and the sand rolling under the wheels and the old Buckboard stopped she jumped from between them out the door she went jumped into the carriage and flew into his arms now here's the other part of the story I didn't tell earlier she flew into the arms of her love and said I love you and you know what he said he said it's all over now honey it's all over now honey and left her little old cousin sitting there can you imagine the dumbfounded look on their face can you imagine the dumbfounded look on people's face when we just all turn up missing he said and she went to a new home you see I'm longing for that new home I'm longing for a new home I'm longing for a new body a new body that don't ache a new body that don't hurt a new body that don't age some of you are but I want to be ready my garment on filled with the Holy Ghost so I pray this morning anything it's in my life that's hindering me from being ready for God God take it out that ought to be each one of our desires
