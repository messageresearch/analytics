Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; All &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; right. Ooh. [music] [music] Ooh. Ooh. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And if [singing] you're not walking, start while I'm talking. [singing] Walking up the king's highway. For there's joy in knowing with him I'm going. [singing] I'm walking up the king's highway. Let's just stand. There's [music] a highway to [singing] heaven and none can [singing] walk [music] up there but the pure and hard with a highway [singing] to heaven. [music] We're walking up [singing] the king's highway. Well, my [singing] way gets brighter, my load gets lighter. [singing] I'm walking up the kings [music] highway. There's joy joy in knowing with [singing] him I'm going. We're walking up the king's highway. Well, it's a high way to heaven [music] and none can walk up [singing] there. But the pure in heart, it's a highway to heaven. We're walking up [music and singing] the king's highway. Christ walks beside me. Oh, and Christ walks beside [music] me. Hallelujah. His love to guide me. We're [music and singing] walking up the king's highway. [music] And [singing] there's joy in knowing with him. I'm going. We're walking [music] up the king's highway. Well, it's a highway to heaven [music] and none can walk [singing] up there. Oh, but the [music] pure in heart. It's a high way to heaven. [singing] We're walking [music] up the king's [singing] high way. Hallelujah. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning. Thank you, Lord, for the highway to heaven. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and thankful for everybody out on this crisp sunny Sunday morning. Amen. [music] I tell you, I was thinking about uh thinking about this song here, and I thought, what a time of season we're in here when, [music] you know, Mary and Joseph, they was walking down a highway that they walked that highway so that we could have a highway. And Jesus was born there and then he walked a highway. He walked a highway to Calvary. &gt;&gt; You thankful for that King's highway this morning? Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord. We do have a couple of uh of announcements real quick if you just don't mind stay standing with us. But good to have the Hallbaggers back and I know they've been on the road and traveling and cruising and different different areas and so different places. Good to have them back. But we do want to give the Lord praise. We do want to give him thanks for what he's done for us and what he's done for the bride and and our friends and families and different ones. But if you don't know the uh McCagan uh their her babies were born two nights ago, I think it was Polly and Palmer. And you know, eight weeks ago, the doctors said they needed to abort one &gt;&gt; so that one could survive. Well, we didn't agree to that. We didn't agree to what the doctor said. We we went we took it to a second opinion. &gt;&gt; Polly was born one pound 7 oz. 1B 7 oz and Palmer was 1B5 ounces and they're both doing good. McCagan's doing good. Give the Lord praise. [applause] Hallelujah. They're very thankful this morning. And [applause] you know, the doctor said that uh uh that they needed to abort Polly because she was too small, weren't going to make it. Well, uh, you know, she's she's no longer on a respirator or I guess uh uh intubated no more. She's breathing on her own and and Palmer's not far behind. So, that just goes to show that uh when God takes control, when he puts the breath of life in, Satan can't snuff it out. So, we just want to thank the Lord for that. Also, uh we do want to remember or or give some praise report first for brother Ben Norro. I was talking to him last night and he just got back and had some tremendous meetings overseas. I think 20 20 people was give their heart to the Lord and over 20 baptized and in his meetings. But you know that didn't uh that didn't settle too well with Satan. And this morning he he woke up in in severe pain and had an acute appendicitis. So he's in surgery today. So uh good thing he's back in the States. I I if I got to be cut on, I would prefer to be cut on in my home country. So, Brother Joe, would you start making your way up here? We do have some, uh, the other needs we want to take before the Lord. And so, uh, we want to remember Brother Steve's cousin, uh, Mike Langley fighting cancer this morning. And, and, um, I think his his mom had just recently passed away with cancer and now he's he's fighting cancer. So, he's got a lot, uh, on his mind, a lot on his plate physically,, spiritually, mentally. So, remember him in prayer. Also, we got a note we want to I guess from Sister Adriana. We want to remember uh Mansky. Uh she's got to go for some tests, I guess, on Tuesday. She sees a specialist and she's asking for a clean bill of health. Also, pray for her son. Uh he's been really sick and in a lot of pain. Needs a touch from the Lord as well as her mom. Her mom's uh has surgery on January the 5th to remove what the doctors believe is cancer. And so, uh, we're just going to believe that the doctors go in there and they do their surgery, you know, and we just pray that the doctor's hands are led by the Lord, they get all the cancer and remove it all and that it hasn't spread anywhere. So, that's what we'll believe, right? &gt;&gt; We're believers, so we're going to believe on these things. So, Brother Joe, if you would just take these knees before the Lord in prayer. The Lord knows each heart here this morning. I don't know what none of y'all have need of. Maybe my wife and then I don't know. [music] So whatever you have need of, the same God that can take care of two little babies, he can answer your request. So, we all just this morning, we'd never know when it's our last service, &gt;&gt; you know, and I come expecting, and I know y'all did, too. You didn't just show up, you know, just to be here to to show people you come to church, you know, [music] and so the Lord knows all about it. So, everybody just everybody just [music] pray this morning. You know, it didn't just me, but everybody just prayed. Pray for one another. And you know what you have need of? Just believe the Lord will give you the desire of your heart. Lord, we come before you this morning, Lord Jesus. Lord, there's no way I can remember all the stuff that Brother Brad just mentioned, but Lord, just thinking about them little babies. He was reading it and Lord and I think they were born last night cuz at 2:00 Lord they was calling to tell Hannah Lord and I just watched the situation Lord knowing that she had to stay in a hospital several days and Lord the route that you made it go Lord they didn't even think the one Lord they didn't think it would make it but that was the one that had to fight the hardest and the first one that's doing the test. So Lord, we know Lord that you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever. And Lord, all of us this morning, we're needy. Lord, Lord, we know where you brought us from. You know what you helped us to overcome. Lord, we know what you're doing in our lives now, Lord, in our homes and our marriages, Lord, our businesses. But Lord, this morning as me and Hannah was talking hours ago, Lord, we just want to be more like you, Lord, because we know we're if we were to have to stand before you, Lord Jesus, Lord, we we don't want to be ashamed and say, Lord, we're sorry and had to make up excuses for why we didn't do better in certain situations in our lives, Lord. No doubt some sitting here this morning, Lord has went backwards instead of going forward. Lord, no doubt got still got bad habits in their life, a stumbling block to their kids, Lord Jesus. Lord, we've been there so we know what it's like and it's not a good condition to be in. Lord, we just ask this morning, Lord Jesus, that you would come, Lord, in a special way. Lord, we we sense, Lord, that as soon as we have to walk up here, it's different standing up here than it is sitting out there. But Lord, we know our pastor, Lord, the struggles and the Lord to keep pressing on him and his family. Lord, I know when he comes out, Lord, he studied, has thoughts. But Lord, we ask you'd use his lips, Lord Jesus, that we could leave here, Lord, knowing that we're headed where we're supposed to go. Lord, we ask you be to rest this service and the singing. Lord, let everybody give worship and praise. Lord, sometime we don't understand why some can't, Lord. Lord, they have no hallelujah, no amens. Lord, we know, Lord, in reality, it means something is not right. They're dead, Lord Jesus. Cuz Lord, you said everything has breath. Let it give praise. So Lord, I ask that you would be with every one, Lord. whatever's got them bound and they can't seem to get over it day after day and year after year that they would finally break loose and get rid of that demon, that devil that caused them not to be able to, Lord, to enter in and give you praise, Lord. [music] Lord, and we just want to tell you that we love you this morning, Lord. We're thankful that we could come, Lord Jesus, because Lord, we could have been somewhere else, Lord, if it hadn't been for your mercy and grace. Lord, I love you this morning. in your precious name the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Good morning. &gt;&gt; Let's turn in our Bibles to Psalms. Psalms 19. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork. There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard. &gt;&gt; Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoicth as a strong man to run a race. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. Moreover, by them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward. &gt;&gt; Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. This one together.

And we pray, Father, that you'll take every spirit in here under the control of the Holy Spirit, so that you can have the liberty, Lord Jesus, to say what you once said, Father, and perform and do just what you want done this morning. We ask God that every hindering spirit would be Lord, brought under control and subdued, so to speak, Father, so that each and everyone would have liberty, Lord, to be able to receive your word this morning. Lord, if there's needing need of healing this morning, that people would be healed. Amen. If people need the filling of the Holy Spirit, people could be filled with the Holy Ghost. If anyone is not saved this morning, that they would accept you as their personal savior. And as we endeavor, Lord Jesus, to speak, Father, what we feel like you've laid us upon our hearts, Lord, and Father, guided our hearts in a certain direction. And just, Lord, trying to be sensitive, Lord Jesus, to what you want, not what I want, but what you want, Father. And Father, we just ask for your direction now, Lord, and your blessing upon the service in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. Let's turn our Bibles, if you will, to Second Peter. Second Peter three. And I want to start with just basically a verse. Amen. That came to my heart, came to my mind that I want to try to build off of. Amen. Chapter 3, verse 10, I mean nine. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as men count slackness, but is longsuffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, into the which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. the earth also and all and the and the works that are therein shall be burnt up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness. And everybody said, &gt;&gt; "Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire, notice how it says the the heavens there." Amen. Shall be on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise, look for a new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that you be be found of him. And notice these three things. Be found of him in peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. peace without spot, all your sins forgiven, &gt;&gt; right with God. And third, blameless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows if you're spotless, then you're also blameless. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. My title this morning is going to be the love and grace of God. Amen. Amen. Reminded me of that song, I saw love, mercy, grace. Amen. I envisioned his beauty. I looked upon his face and I saw love, mercy, and grace. Amen. Praise the Lord. So this morning, we want to talk about that. Just begin to think about how that there in Peter and how that we've been talking Wednesday, Wednesday evening, we talked about u Amen. How that the angels which kept not their first estate, how that they had a choice. Ain't that right? In heaven, whenever the angels chose to take sides with the enemy, isn't that right, with the devil, they had to make a choice. And they made the choice. Whenever that rumor was going around and whenever that gossip was going around, God's church, God's people, God's angels, you know, God just, you know, he gets all the credit, God gets all the glory, y'all. &gt;&gt; Y'all don't get enough glory. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, listen, that's what they were saying. and and we deserve some of this is what they were trying is the rumor that was going around. &gt;&gt; That was the seed that the devil was sewing. &gt;&gt; You know, everybody bows and everybody praises him and all of you know and we're great angels, mighty angels. &gt;&gt; We got great power. We should have some of that. You know, Dayton had the same idea, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Nathan and Car had that same idea that they wanted to be a somebody. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And you know, God had a great division happen in heaven. First division ever happened was in heaven. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And we talked about this and I don't really hadn't anticipated to go down here, but I'm just going to follow the spirit. Is that okay? But they got to talking and and and God whenever Dayan when when Dayan had been this and and God had had a previous experience in heaven of this division that happened. My God wasn't too pleased with Dayan and Corora, was he? &gt;&gt; No. No. Because Moses is not He didn't make himself a prophet. He didn't make himself anything. Just like our prophet, he didn't make himself anything. He didn't try to be something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And others were jealous just like Jesus when he was here. Jesus was who he was. And he was humble about it. &gt;&gt; He didn't have a fancy house and great big feast he could put together like you know that Pharisee did. Isn't that right? But he was what he was by the grace of God, what God had made him. But the Pharisees also, they were also jealous because they they had an ambition. They had pride in their hearts. &gt;&gt; And God didn't like it too well with Dayan. And I mean, I you can only imagine how displeased God was with Dayan and Kora. How that Moses had to say, "Everybody that's on their side, stay there. But everybody, I'm giving you a chance to come over on my side. You get a chance. Give him mercy. &gt;&gt; So, and I don't know. I don't just maybe stop there. I you know but let me just say this that for some reason I'm trying to feel the direction that the Holy Spirit is taking my heart because I seem to be pulled maybe not so much not so much here for just this congregation but maybe somebody listening I don't know just why God is pulling me this way but I'm going to just go the way the Holy Spirit leads me to go. Is that okay? So when we talk about the the the mercy of grace, grace that's shown the love of God. How many knows that no doubt I don't know I don't know exactly what happened in heaven. I don't know if those angels were given the opportunity cuz you know God is a God of grace. God is a God of mercy. And so he he threw Moses to through Moses said, "Hey, y'all make your decision if you want to stay with Dayton or if you want to come over here. &gt;&gt; But get away from them guys' tents. &gt;&gt; Get away from them guys." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's what Moses said. You don't want to be a part of it, but come over. And they all did. The ones that did. And then you know God Mo God God spoke through Moses and said God's going to do something if the earth open up his mouth and swallow him up. then you'll know that it was God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And God hated that thing so bad because of his experience in heaven. That's why I say I don't know whether those angels up there if they were given a chance perhaps uh you know you know you're going to have to decide whether you're going to listen to that gossip that goes through the church. &gt;&gt; You have to make your choice because if you side with it, you'll become part of it. you partake of that sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. But no doubt, you know, but they had their choice. They made their choice. They weren't born. And and you know, I never knew this. The sure don't preach it that those angels back there, the angels of heaven were put on free moral agency. Isn't that a great mystery? Isn't that a truth that we have not known? Through the prophet of God, they had a choice that they could make. True. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we read in Jude there where uh you know they're under chains of darkness &gt;&gt; in prison held there until the day of judgment. And all they can think about perhaps is they had their choice. They had their time. &gt;&gt; And I guess my heart is that everybody hearing or listening, Amen. and streaming. No doubt, but there's something in your heart or you wouldn't stream there. So many people, they don't care about streaming. They don't hear care about hearing anything about the word of God when it's the only only absolute thing in this world that there is. &gt;&gt; There is no other absolute. Why would people not want to hear it? &gt;&gt; So those that are perhaps streaming, listening, or hearing me this morning, Amen. There's a purpose. There's a reason that you do. And I'm here to tell you both here and out there, amen, that God is a merciful God. &gt;&gt; God is a God of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. That song says, "I saw love, mercy, and grace when I think about God." Amen. When I think about what he's done for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I think of the grace that he has and the love that he has. Amen. Just like the Bible says, for God so loved the world, the whole world. God loved the whole world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life. &gt;&gt; We read this morning where he says, you know, God is longsuffering towards us work, not willing that any should perish, but that all might come to repentance. &gt;&gt; I want to say this. Wish the whole world could hear me this morning. You have to you are forced as a human being. You are forced to make a decision. You have to make a choice. &gt;&gt; You don't have a choice in the matter. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't say, "Well, I'm just not going to make a choice." You just did make a choice. &gt;&gt; You chose to ignore a solemn warning that is given to you that you have to with God. You either have to accept his mercy and his grace and his love &gt;&gt; or you have to accept the judgment of God. &gt;&gt; You have to do one or the other. You must make a choice of which one you're going to receive, what you're going to accept. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can turn your face. You can turn it off. You can not listening. But one day you're going to meet God face to face. And you are going to have to give a reason and an account of what you choice that you made. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can ignore it now, but you'll pay then. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many know sooner or later you're going to have to face the fact? That's why we preached on then and now. Amen. How many believe now is the day of salvation? Don't wait till then. We've had all the then and the now. We had so many warnings, so many illustrations of what people made the wrong choice, did the wrong thing, did not accept the grace of God in the past. &gt;&gt; And now, where [screaming] are they at? Where are their souls at? &gt;&gt; We don't look at our flesh. We don't look at our age. We don't look at our gray hair, brother. We don't care about getting old. We care about where this soul is going to be &gt;&gt; in 10 years, 20 years from now. Where are we going to be at? &gt;&gt; How many That's what we're here for, to care about our soul. &gt;&gt; And when we think about the love of God and what he did by coming to the earth, died on a cross. How many know he died for us? He hung on a cross completely naked. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was not ashamed to do that for you and I. Why should we be ashamed of him? [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. [applause] We've been speaking here and you know we understand that what you do with Christ today tells you what you would have done with Jesus on the shores of Galilee. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is a this is a major doctrine in the Bible. This is major thing in the Bible that irritated so to speak Jesus to the core cuz the Pharisees kept saying that they were Abraham the children of Abraham the seed of Abraham says I know that but here you seek to kill me and Abraham wrote of me how can you say that you Abraham's seed when you don't believe what he said &gt;&gt; he got real straight with him you're of your father the devil that's who your daddy Yes. Why? Because you can't receive the manifested word for your hour. &gt;&gt; That's what we say today is if you can't receive Jesus of today, lie to me and tell me 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; Cuz you don't. You would have been there. You would have rejected him. You would have crucified him. &gt;&gt; How can you say that, brother Bible? Brother Ber, I'll tell you the scripture. Jesus said, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the separ of the righteous and say, whoa, well, if we'd have been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of our prophets." That's what you say. Wherefore, you're witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Amen. You serpents, you generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of hell? Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes, and some of them ye shall kill and crucify. Some of them they shall scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city. Why? When they could not receive the word for their age, he says, "Don't bother." Amen. You act like you're varnishing all you love those prophets that of their tomb, but he says, "You're the one that put them in there." [sighs] [gasps] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Why? They had a choice they had to make at the time. Amen. How many know it's King Agria? Amen. King of Grippa. He come down to the place. Amen. Brother Brandham even preached a message called He was to pass his way. I mean know when Jesus passes by your way, you're on the spot. When the rich young ruler come up to Jesus and he wanted eternal life, he come to Jesus and then he wanted eternal life. He was on the spot. That was his time. When that gripper Paul tried his best to persuade him, you believe the prophets and he told them the whole story of how Jesus was to come and how he was supposed to die, how he did, how he rose again, how I saw the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. See folks, a lot of people will believe this Jesus. Oh yeah, I believe this Jesus. But they will deny that he went back to the pillar of fire that he come out of. &gt;&gt; They'll deny that Jesus. &gt;&gt; Nope. Don't want nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; You just denied Christ and you don't real. &gt;&gt; That's what that was. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this morning, my heart's desired. What I want to talk about is that Paul said, he says, you know, eye has not seen, ear has not heard the things that are prepared for them that love him. How many believe that he loved us and we need to be loving him? I love him. I love him because he first loved me. [applause] Amen. You can't say that you love him and deny him. If you've got God on the inside, there's something [screaming] about you. There's something in there will not let you deny Christ. No man speaking by the Holy Ghost can call Jesus a cursed and so forth. And no, not by the Holy Ghost. You're not talking. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother B preached a message called He Cares. Do you care? See folks, we're living in the dispensation. Let me We're living in the hour. We're living in the dispensation of the capstone. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Mike, if you can zoom in, if I can remember how this is done here. Right here. The capstone. What is that? Love. The capstone is love. We had Luther, we had Wesley, we had all these different ones, but we're in the age of love. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; We're talking about the love and the grace of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that he already loved us. He loved the world. He loved the rich young ruler. But it's something about it. The question is this morning, how much do we love him? &gt;&gt; Now, isn't that a good question? Doesn't that doesn't that touch your heart? &gt;&gt; How much do you love him? And I don't know about you, brother Brad, but there's something in my heart that tells me I want to love him more. [applause] That's &gt;&gt; right. All of you. I want to love him more. [screaming] &gt;&gt; He deserves more of my love. I can give you all kinds of scriptures that tells you whether you love him or not and how much you love him. I may get time to. I don't know. Amen. But that's my heart's desire this morning is he cares. He cared. What about us? What about the world? Do they care? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Brandon, he preached a message called He Cares, Do You Care? And he talked about the Hebrew children. They loved God. And even though they were going to get burnt, they weren't ashamed. They were going to get burnt [screaming] if God don't deliver them. He said, "We don't know if he will, but he's more than able." &gt;&gt; But there's one thing our commandments are, the word says for us not to bow down to idols and so forth, and we're not bowing. He said they cared and because they cared, God cared. In other words, how many believes it's our time [screaming] to love? He loved. Now it's our time to love back. &gt;&gt; But people have a hard time loving back. I know. Um let me just read you a prayer line. Brother Brandham said in thy life in kindness, Chattanooga, Tennessee in 58. And he had a healing service and he he prayed for people and so forth. And he told everybody, all of you that you know feels like God has touched you and has healed you. He you feel like there's something been wrong with you. If you couldn't move your hand, move it. That's right. In Christ's name, move it. Put your faith to the test. You know, if you can move it, raise up and come here. If you can't hear and you hear now, raise up and come here. If headache and it's gone, raise up and come here. If you're sick in your stomach, sick and it's gone, come here. Come up here and testify. Now, I'm going to make it a long story short. Listen. He says, "Somebody else that couldn't hear. You raise up and so forth. Come up. Don't be afraid. Are you afraid to put Christ to the test? What's wrong with you? If you're healed, raise your hand. Raise yourself up. Come up here. Let's testify to the glory of God. Let's give John God a chance to verify. That's right. Come on. See you coming. All right. Come on up. Different ones came up. He says, "Are you just bluffing? Was you just kidding Christ?" Christ has kept his word now. Did I stand here and uh how did I stand here in that challenge night after night if he didn't keep his word? Look at here. They're ready to testify. Here they are. They come up. Some deaf, dumb, blind. I don't know. Trouble is. Whatever your trouble is, come on. Give God a chance. Testify. Raise up. Don't be afraid. Don't be ashamed. Amen. You're ashamed. Uh you ashamed to testify. Come on. And while you're coming to give testimony of your uh of your rising, you people that raised your hands a while ago that you wanted to repent, you want to make your life right, come here and stand here just a minute. I want to pray for you. come right on up here and this way. You that raised your hands a while ago. You know, uh, and and you know that you want to come and thank God for taking that temper away from you, taking the world away from you, and you're not, you know, you're going to dress different, you're going to act different, you're going to live different. Come on up, be sincere, stand up, and come here to the altar. &gt;&gt; Now, something happened. Now I want you to people to look here. I want you ministers. Can you see what tears the heart of a preacher? Can you see what tear tears the Holy Spirit? When people will raise their hands that they'll do that. They want to repent and then will sit there and won't move. &gt;&gt; All those people that raise their hands, they want to repent. They want to react. But he said, "Now that you you that did that now come up here." But they wouldn't do it. Let brother Bab says, "What's left but judgment? You'll cry someday when I'm gone. You'll remember that I speak in the name of Christ. You'll long to hear the things that you hear and you will never hear them. Come on now. I invite you to Christ." He says, "Was you ashamed? You are you ashamed? You raise your hand. Then you wouldn't make a good Christian to begin with." That's awful rude, brother. But it's time to take the gloves off and tell the truth. Christ is here. He's raised from the dead. He's present. Amen. Come on now. That's right. Raise up. If mama says sit down, say, "Mama, you go with me." &gt;&gt; If husband says, "You can't go there or I'll leave you." Goodbye. &gt;&gt; Come on, you're going. Why? How many knows that we can't be ashamed of the gospel of Christ? We're not ashamed to suffer the reproach of Christ. Don't be ashamed [applause] to say that you know him. Count the cross. Take up your cross and follow him. &gt;&gt; Imagine in [screaming] the Bible people were ashamed. The love of God come down and his parents their son was healed. Amen. Remember uh Jesus healed him of his you know blindness. &gt;&gt; The Pharisees come to him and they said how did he get his healing? &gt;&gt; How did he get his healing? And them poor parents, &gt;&gt; them poor parents, they were ashamed &gt;&gt; to testify that it was Jesus &gt;&gt; because the Bible says that if they had that it was Jesus, they' have got cast out &gt;&gt; of the synagogue. Isn't that right? So they say, "Well, he's of age. Ask him." &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can you imagine on the day of judgment Jesus come by and heal your very son? Ain't that right? And then you are ashamed to testify it was Christ that did it. &gt;&gt; No, that'll be played back. &gt;&gt; This is where you just because you're afraid to get kicked out of church, you won't stand for the truth that's presented for you before you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like brother Bam says, if I taught that in our church, I'd get cast out. Well, you got to cast get cast out somewhere. Do you want to get cast out here or do you want to get cast out there? [applause] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth? &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus says, "Whosoever will confess me before him, before men, him will I confess before my father which is in heaven, but whosoever will deny me, him will I also deny before my father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; That's right. He might come up saying, "We've cast out this. We've done that or the other, but somewhere along the line, you didn't obey. You didn't love him the way you were supposed to." Amen. Said, "Heaven haven't we all these works." And Jesus say, "I never knew you." &gt;&gt; Woo! What a powerful, horrible thing to have to hear from God on that day. &gt;&gt; I never knew you. Depart from me, you workers of iniquity. I never had an intimate relationship with you. They believe this, as brother Bam says, we're like in a three- room house. Amen. We come to Christ. We're justified. Amen. We come into the living room. Amen. And we fellowship with him. But it's time for the bedroom. It's time for an intimate relationship with Almighty God to where you can get in your prayer [screaming] closet and you can talk to the Lord. But Abraham says every preacher ought to have it before he comes out here. He ought to have that time, that sweet time with the Lord, talking and fellowshipping with Almighty God. is we're not in the we're we don't have that out here. Amen. We're not in the outer courts. We're not in the holies of in the holies anymore. You and I are in the holies of holies. We enter into his rest. [applause] That's where you and I [screaming] are to be. &gt;&gt; Evening light tabernacle. It's time to be ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time to be ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't mean to be hard, &gt;&gt; but maybe we need to be hard. &gt;&gt; Maybe I need to be harder. &gt;&gt; I'll know what I know one thing. If you're a child of God, you'll be able to handle it. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, let me go a little further. You're going to love it &gt;&gt; because you know that Jesus said, "As many as I love, I rebuke, I chasen. be zealous therefore [screaming] and repent. [applause and cheering] Why? Because we want to be without spot, without wrinkle. We want to be blameless. We want to have the peace of God in our hearts. How many is with me? Amen. This Christmas season. Amen. This is the season to have the peace of God, &gt;&gt; ruling and railing in your heart, &gt;&gt; to be without spot. &gt;&gt; Amen. to love him with all your heart, &gt;&gt; all your mind, all your soul, all your strength. When I think about that, this is our time. Preachers have preached it, right? This is your time. &gt;&gt; This is our time. This is all of humanity's time. Everybody that's hears, let him hear what the spirit say to the churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is our time to make our choice. And we are a very privileged people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young men, even me back in 1965 when brother Brandham preached the seagulls after that there was people that thought that mercy was over. &gt;&gt; No more mercy. Can you imagine the preacher telling you now it's over? You'd say, "My, I went in, right?" Different ones thinking that mercy was over with. Even brother Brandham made it sound like that almost. Could it be? Could it? We're preaching to the total loss. Souls in prison now is scary, but amen. Should preachers quit preaching, go off the field, they ask him. He said, 'N no, it's not time to quit yet. We're not done yet. Keep preaching the gospel. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? I'm glad. Why? Because I'd have been out, but I'm not. So, I'm thankful for the grace of God. The mercy of God is still available. Oh, it'll stop one of these days. It'll be cut off when he rises from that mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. What do you think, Brother Bram said? He says, "If you're listening to this tape right now and you need to repent and get right with God, push stop." Amen. One time we can say, "Not push play, but push stop." Young people, if you're not right with God, push stop. &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm not leaving this church service until I'm right with God. Until I know I've got the peace of God in [screaming] my heart, until I know he's forgiven me." Stop everything until that happens. Then push play. then listen to the rest. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; If it was that urgent back then, can you imagine where we are now? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I read that scripture there because guess what? We are absolutely, brother Bam says it's it's the coming of the Lord is passed due. Didn't he say that &gt;&gt; it's passed due? [screaming] There's only one thing hindering the rapture, and that's the readiness of the bride. &gt;&gt; Think about it, y'all. God, help me not to be the hindrance. &gt;&gt; Don't help me to hold Don't let me hold it back. &gt;&gt; How many is left with me? God, don't let me hold it back. I want to be ready. &gt;&gt; I told my wife on the way to church here, he I said, you know, well, I don't know if I said told her just this way, but this is the way I thought it. I'm not expecting a tomorrow. I don't expect tomorrow to happen. No, I expect God to come here today before the day is done. Amen. I live I want to live my life like he's coming today. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I told my wife, I said, "But we have to plan like he's not coming for 50 years." Imagine that. Not expecting a tomorrow, but yet you got to keep on living your life. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You said, "Is that what Brother Brand taught?" &gt;&gt; That's what he taught. &gt;&gt; That's right. Why? Because you can't quit. You can't stop. I think brother Tommy put it on on on the group talking about if the Lord if let let's say we seen some of our loved ones and we say we got about 30 days left. &gt;&gt; We got about 30 days left. What would you change? &gt;&gt; What would you change? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I would hope that you can say nothing. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Does that make sense to you? &gt;&gt; Sure. Nothing. Why? Because you're doing just what you're supposed to be doing. You're living the way you're supposed to be living. If not, then you need to repent. Then you need to make a change. If you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing, &gt;&gt; try to get others in. Try to get as many in as possible, living for the Lord, reflecting Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, if you're building a church, keep building a church. If you know he's coming tomorrow, keep on doing whatever it is God's called you to do. How many wants to be in that place? I want to be in the place God has called me to be. Stand there. Don't deviate. Don't fluctuate. Amen. Amen. Chris Kathy even come talk about Amen be stable unmovable because why he apparently crows around and so many people leaving and Amen falling back and and going here and there unstable. Don't be that way. &gt;&gt; No. If there's ever a time to stand, it's a now. If there ever a time to be solid in Christ, it's now. If there's ever a time to be without spot, it's now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? because we know that this world is coming to an end &gt;&gt; and we're going to leave this place by God's grace &gt;&gt; and with his help and we need a greater love of God &gt;&gt; in our hearts. Lord Jesus, I want a greater love. &gt;&gt; There's no eye has seen nor ear heard the things that God has prepared for them. This is one place where he says them that love him. &gt;&gt; How many loves him? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many wants to be pleasing to him? &gt;&gt; I think I'm going to just bring a couple of those scriptures in how that you can know that you're pleasing to him and how that you love him. Amen. Because that's what we want to be. We want to be like Enoch. He had this testimony that he did what? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; That he pleased God. Amen. In John. Come on now. supposed to put this John 2. Hereby know we that we know him if we keep his commandments. Now, how many know is that we're not saved by keeping his commandments by the works of the law? That doesn't save you. We're saved by grace through faith. That not of yourselves. It's the gift of God. We're saved. And we do these things. Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." There's a lot of people, Amish and all these different ones, they think that if they dress a certain way, they drive a horse and buggy. Like brother Joe said this morning, I sure glad I didn't have to drive a buggy this morning. &gt;&gt; If I suffer and I don't have an air conditioner and I don't have electricity and I really I'm not conformed to the world in the way that the world does. Hello. I mean their whole religion is almost on based on that. What about the transforming of your mind? &gt;&gt; Hello. However, what it what it is, brothers and sisters, is to think about this. We do it out of love, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we don't want to hurt him. Brother Bram many times made the statement and he give us the illustration of how that whenever he leaves to go to another country, he'll get up and with his wife and his children and they'll pray together and she'll he'll tell her that she loves him. I mean [laughter] that he loves her and she'll tell him that she loves him and she don't come up to him say now Mr. Brandon, you I'm telling you, you better be faithful and don't you have no mother wives up other than me. While I'm gone, honey, you better not have no other. No, but says you don't have to do all that. He said, because the love that he has for her, he wouldn't want to hurt her for nothing. How many feels that way? That's what we want. God, we don't want to hurt you for nothing. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I believe in evening light tabernacle saints being led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Sure, I'm your leader in in in his perspective of guiding and so forth, but brother Bram clearly said in the in the church ages and so forth that the church is meant to be led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because if you're just led by me, you'll just try to do it because Thomas said not to. &gt;&gt; Huh? We could say that about our children. Godspeed today that they don't do it just because we tell them they can't. &gt;&gt; They'll come and they'll say, "I don't do it because I don't want to do it." How many thankful for a desire not to do it? &gt;&gt; I thank God for his grace this morning. [applause] &gt;&gt; I thank him for his grace. How many thankful for his grace? &gt;&gt; I thank him for his love. &gt;&gt; And I thank him for his grace. Now notice here and he says he that saith I know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him. In whosoever keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected. Amen. And hereby know we that we are in him. Amen. When your heart's desire is to please God and do what he says, John says, "That's how we know that we know him." &gt;&gt; You have all kinds of churches and different people that'll uh live a certain way during the week and then come to church and go out and get drunk and everything else. Come and raise your hands. I love him. I bunch of liars. How many believes that if we truly love him, we'll want to do what God says. &gt;&gt; How many is with me? Lord, help me to do everything that he tells me to do. &gt;&gt; Lord, convict me of those little things. &gt;&gt; It's time to get the little things right. How many believe it? &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh my. Aren't you glad for the grace of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. His great, his mercy, his longsuffering. Think about it. 12 years that he gave the days of Noah for them to get right with God. Here he says, "We are living in the long suffering of almighty God." The prophet way back in 65 passed away. Amen. And now look how long it's been since he's went off the scene. &gt;&gt; And God Oh, he he thought he wouldn't go. Remember I read Sunday he says scientists say that within 10 years the whole world is going to be annihilated. scientist. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram thought for sure we'd be gone and done and over with and that we'd be walking. How many is looking forward to walking in the millennium? &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm looking forward to He thought we would have be if I should in the millennium ready by 1977. &gt;&gt; Caleb wasn't even born then. Huh? &gt;&gt; That's right. Didn't get married till 83. Didn't get saved till around 80 or something like that. Praise the Lord. How many glad for his longsuffering? God is longsuffering. &gt;&gt; Let's talk about his grace. In closing, [applause] how many do we have in here that's perfect? You do everything right. Never make a mistake. Huh? Now, let me ask you this. What if God wouldn't have mercy and grace for you? &gt;&gt; How many of us still be here? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But I thank God for his grace. For his mercy. &gt;&gt; I thank God that before you go to bed, you can do like brother Bam said, Billy Paul, confess all your sins, get everything right. You don't know whether you're going to wake up in the morning or not. &gt;&gt; How many glad that we can come and say, "God, I'm not." But I know your grace covers it and I'm striving for that perfection. How many striving for that perfection? Amen. I I don't know. I guess I could say it. Maybe shouldn't doubt it. Don't. But sometimes preachers come up here and says, "You'll never be perfect." Make it sound like why even try? Hello. But what is the five-fold ministry for? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's for striving for that perfecting of the saints. Somebody ain't preaching right. [applause] Why? because we're trying to bring people to perfection to that place. &gt;&gt; All right. I've read it. I don't have the quote with me, but I've read it where brother Brandham said what perfection was. He says it's when you are daily living for him and you make a mistake. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; You do something wrong and you quickly confess it. He said you're still perfect in the sight of God. [applause] Amen. That's what he said. I take his word for it. &gt;&gt; How many glad because man, if you uh if you made a mistake and did something wrong and say, "Well, now I got to get rebaptized. I ain't a child of God." And no, no, don't do that. Just get right, repent, say, "God, forgive me." And get right back up. He says, "You're in the eyes of God, you're perfect." Why? Because you're walking in the blood. You're under the blood. [applause] That's the grace of God. How many know, oh, if I could tell the world, if I could tell our government, if I could tell Russia, if I could tell China, if I could tell the world this morning, you are living by the grace of God. It is the grace of God that you're not burnt up already. &gt;&gt; You're living living in the mercy of Almighty God. You're living in the longsuffering, the goodness of God. There's how many knows for 2,000 years that blood has been over the earth, hasn't it? He said the only thing that keeps God in the wrath of God, amen, to destroy this world is that blood covering. That's the mercy of God. That's the grace of God. Amen. And that's what the world is living under. And they don't even realize it, but you and I realize it. And we thank God for it. Say, "Thank you, Lord, for your grace for me. Let that blood wash me white." Even brother Brandham's patience got short when he was up in Ohio in that restaurant and seen all of those people dancing and everything else and and a policeman playing a slot machine that was even illegal. He says, "God, why don't you just destroy this thing?" God says, "Come over here behind this door. I got to talk to you a little bit." &gt;&gt; He come over there and he showed him all of his faults. Every time that his faults would come up there, Amen. Amen. There was a there would be like a bumper. It would hit that and it would go on a book. It would go on a book. Amen. He had a whole big book full of sins. Ain't that right? Amen. And Jesus grabs hands that Amen. he wrote on that book, pardoned. &gt;&gt; Pardoned. He says, "I pardoned you, but you want to be condemning everybody else." Hallelujah. How many knows I want to say to the world, there's a pardon for you. [applause and cheering] Everybody, the whole world, there's a pardon for everybody. Whosoever will, let him come. &gt;&gt; Let him come. [screaming] Come while you can &gt;&gt; or you will later regret it and say, "Boy, I wished I would have." Just like all those that are in the regions of the lost. &gt;&gt; They wished they would have. Elvis wishes he would have. The rich man wishes he would have. But wishing doesn't do you any good anymore over there. [sighs] [gasps] &gt;&gt; Amen. This fits this generation. As many as I love, Revelations 3 19 somewhere in there. He says, "As many as I love, I rebuke, I chasen. Besell us, therefore, and repent." Proverbs 1:23 says, "Turn you at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you. I will make known my words unto you." I thought of the message of the hour. How many believes that this message will produce a bride? We've already got the words that we need to get out of here. God has given us his words. I have made known my words unto you. &gt;&gt; You're not in dark ages anymore. No, you're in perfect light. &gt;&gt; Back to Paul's what he said. Back what the Bible says. Turn at my reproof. But because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand. No man regarded. But you have said it not all my counsel and would not of my reproof. reproof. I also will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your fear cometh. Why? They mocked him. But guess what? God gets the last mock. &gt;&gt; Amen. God gets the last laugh. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not mocked. What a man sws that will he also reap. &gt;&gt; When your calamity comes, I will mock you when your fear cometh. When your fear cometh as desolation, your destruction cometh asth a whirlwind, distress and anguish cometh upon you. Oh my, how many knows? You can almost imagine the condition and the anguish and the horror that this world is about to face. We serve a loving God. That God is love. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'll tell you what, there's another side to God. And he don't want to do it, but he has to to be just. Our justice system is absolutely no good. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Buy their way out. When's the last time? Well, I won't bring political people, but you know some names that ought to be in jail. You do something like that, you're going to jail. &gt;&gt; I haven't seen any of our politicians go to jail and they deserve to. Trump probably did to be honest with you. &gt;&gt; Hello. But how I said that to say this that he is a just judge. &gt;&gt; He will bring justice. He is a just God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You mock him, you'll get what you got coming. &gt;&gt; You refuse him, you'll get it. Amen. Oh my. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer. I wonder, God forbid anybody under the sound of my voice will ever come to the place to where you'll remember that you heard that. I'll call, but God won't let answer. &gt;&gt; How many knows God is calling now? &gt;&gt; We heard him just a few minutes. Come unto me all ye who are weary and be ready. Come, come, come. Christ is calling. Come. &gt;&gt; Sure, he's calling now. The spirit and the bride say, "Come." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then they shall call on me and I will not answer. They'll seek me early but I shall not. They shall not find me. They hated knowledge. Truth presented right to people and they turn it away. There's just about nothing worse that you can do when you know something's the truth than turn it away. And did not choose to fear of the Lord. They would none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way. This is what you wanted. This is what you chose. Now eat it. And they will be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fool shall destroy them. But whoso hallelujah. Have we got any whoos? Whosoever hearkenth unto me shall not shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from all evil. &gt;&gt; How many glad that you heard his voice? &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. [applause] Thank you, Lord, that we heard your voice. Thank you, Jesus. I got to quit, but I'm going to say this in closing. Paul last chapter of Acts when he was preaching some believed the things that were spoken and some believed not and when they agreed not amongst themselves they departed couldn't come to an agreement after that Paul spoke a word well spake the Holy Ghost saying well spake the Holy Ghost by Isaiah's the prophet unto your fathers saying go unto this people and say hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed least they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart. Do you want to know what happens when somebody sees when somebody understands with their heart and should be converted &gt;&gt; and I would heal them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed are your eyes for they see. Blessed are your ears. [screaming] You're a blessed person this morning. We're a blessed people. The grace of almighty God that let's put something down in your heart to be able to believe. You can't make people believe. It takes the grace of God to open their eyes. [screaming] [applause] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord for your grace. Thank you Lord for your love. Oh this is the greatest treasure that we have is to come together on Sunday morning. Amen. with believers of like faith. Amen. And saturate ourselves in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Believing the word of God. Welcome him down into our hearts saying, "Lord, I want to love you more. &gt;&gt; I want to love him more. Don't you?" &gt;&gt; He gets sweeter, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the day go by. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love him more and more and more. I want more of Jesus than I ever had before. &gt;&gt; I want more of Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want more. I want so much. Brother Brad, stand up with me. Amen. I want so much. One day we're going to hug. Embrace Christ. We're going to give him a hug. How many believe that? We're going to see him face to face. Amen. That's what we want to do. Embrace him. Say, "God, we want to we want to hold you. We want to hug you. We want to love you more &gt;&gt; and we're looking forward to the time &gt;&gt; when we can. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. How many loves what Christ did for us on Calvary? &gt;&gt; How he came to the earth this Christmas season, became a man and reconciled us. How many's reconciled? &gt;&gt; There you go. I like to see them young hands up. you're reconciled &gt;&gt; to God. &gt;&gt; Keep that love of God in your heart. &gt;&gt; Don't never let the devil put a little hatred or bitterness in there. &gt;&gt; Just keep the love of God. It's the most important thing that you and I have is the love of God. Brother Bam says all of your religious demonstrations, all of that. Don't don't even worry about all that. He says, "You've got to have that perfect love in your heart." Paul said, "If I move mountains and all these things, if I have not charity, I'm nothing." Paul realized the importance that God's people Amen. that they have the love of God in their hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Stand with me this morning. We'll just go into the communion. Remembering the Lord what he did? This do in remembrance of me. How many believes it's important to do it. &gt;&gt; If you don't do it, there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Need to be able to be at a place where you can do it. If not, get right with God so that you can turn your Bibles if with me if you will and read. We'll read the scriptures. We read a scripture here in 1 Corinthians I believe 11.
