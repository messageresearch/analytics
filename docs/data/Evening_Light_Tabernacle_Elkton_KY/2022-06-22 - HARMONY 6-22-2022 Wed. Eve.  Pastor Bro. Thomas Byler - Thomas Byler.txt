amen and so they're all doing good as far as i know everything seems to be going pretty good up there amen and trust everybody didn't burn up today so praise the lord certainly was hot man said god bless you good to see y'all amen i just seen a few cars out there i said boy there's hardly going to be anybody tonight but there's more than hearing in the car so amen praise the lord god is good isn't he amen but josh whenever uh you call me out get up there close to my eyes brother bother comes you know yeah i get the message i didn't better better do it i couldn't hear him call me and so i'm a little hard here i guess you know but anyway so they were out there singing several times and he had to come come out to the door back hey i'm ready for you out here i'm like all right i'm coming amen praise the lord god is good stand with me amen let's go before the lord in prayer amen and just commit to service to god lord jesus we're grateful lord to be able on this hot day lord to be able to assemble ourselves together lord lord and to worship you to come to worship you in spirit and the truth father to magnify your name to glorify you and to thank you lord for all that you are mean to us on a daily basis father lord we just desire god that you say lord take me father and use me father as an instrument as a microphone to speak to your people to our hearts tonight father and may each one of us go lord having gotten something from you lord jesus and being refreshed in the presence of god lord we just invite you to come in a special way we thank you for each one that has made the effort lord to come out on a wednesday night like this lord to honor you and i pray god that you will honor them also lord father we ask now lord that you just passed the reading of the word the meditation of our heart in jesus name amen and amen let's just get right into the word if you will amen we'll go to um saint john 5 saint john 5th chapter we'll begin and we'll read about 19 verses it's a little bit lengthy but we'll just read the story to try to get a basis for our thought tonight after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem and there was at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk blind halt wither waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain sea certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years if you'll notice as a prophet but he already had it 38 years so he wasn't real likely to die of it right when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now for a long time in that case he said unto him will thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while he steps down before me i imagine the man was frustrated don't you yes just about to get your healing and then somebody isn't kind enough to let you get healed they want it bad themselves right so they step into it amen jesus says unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them he answers them that he made me whole he that made me whole the same is he that said to me take up my bed and walk then ask the him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that was healed was not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place afterwards jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more at least the worst thing come upon thee the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day but jesus answered them my father worketh neither to and i were therefore the jews sought more to kill him because he had not only broken sabbath but said that god was his father making himself equal with god then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the sun can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise amen may god has blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen i want to start with making the statement that even though the pharisees and the scribes are the pharisees even though they were god's ordained children and the church that was ordained in the way that it was supposed to be they couldn't have missed it further than what they did amen because here somebody that was completely healed and made whole here they want to kill the man they want to kill a man that has the power to heal people you know and so it had to be an utter blindness isn't that right they were utterly blind to pharisees words uh i want to say pathetically blind because uh i mean we know that in the end they're the ones that said away with him away with him crucify him crucify him and all the things that they did they bore false witness against him they did everything in the book so lord help them amen it goes to show you that just because people are religious doesn't mean that they're in tune with god amen praise the lord so we want to speak tonight and i don't know we already posted on the internet i guess i i want to speak on harmony this morning as i was just praying about what the lord would want me to speak and so forth this thought came to my mind and my heart and it wouldn't leave so that's what i studied on but the help of the lord and that is harmony but i want to call it rapturing harmony rapturing harmony amen because i believe it is time for us to be rapture ready don't you time to leave this world amen if i was to ask anybody in the church tonight and i have maybe a couple of little things maybe uh you know that i might try to get you to participate in and that is what is your goal in life what is your goal in life amen make the rapture anything else be ready for the rapture to be like jesus to be more like christ amen but the number one thing would be for the rapture am i right we know there's not a hope left in this world that's the only way out of here that's the only escape amen and in order to make that rapture that's what we want to be doing is to get ready to be ready for the rapture amen you're not gonna make it you're not gonna go in the rapture if you're not ready for the rapture so i believe what we're talking about tonight with the help of the lord is certainly something that will make us ready for the rapture and it's also something else that you can pray for that you can ask for amen and receive it because there's things that you can pray for amen that you will not receive how many knows that many things bible says you ask and miss because you ask it upon your own lusts and so forth but i like what saint john 5 and 14 i believe it is says uh let me see 5 14. he says and this is the confidence that we have in him you know because we could talk about all the places and the things and that he said ask what you will and all these other places he says whatsoever you ask in my name i'll do it but here it says that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us i may let you gotta pray right amen i'm just going to give you a little bit underlying something here i think i've experienced this to where i've known of people to pray for something and pray for something until i've heard back again uh of other people that have said you know this person prayed so hard i don't know why it ever didn't happen i mean we're talking about godly people praying okay that i personally know and in my heart in my mind it says in my heart i said i bet you anything he wasn't according to the will of god because you can't pray i don't care how safely you can't pray against the will of god amen and get your you can't get it amen because the bible says we get it only when you pray according to the will of god amen now another thought was on this on by praying is that when you pray amen and you ask the wrong way amen you might be like balaam and the animal may have to talk to you oh my it's true you go the wrong way you ask for the wrong thing you're going to get your foot crushed things are going to go bad for you it's not going to go good but it's going to go bad but when you ask according to his will god's going to answer that and that's what we're going to talk about tonight because what we're wanting to desire is to be in harmony with almighty god my my mind when i think about harmony oh my i just i love harmony i mean he loves harmony a harmony in a family how nice it is and disharmony you know a division how horrible it is but harmony when everything's working together amen it's just like taking a any kind of a tool or a any kind of a machine that has all kinds of gears and everything and i think brother branham explained it a little bit when he talked about the dynamics and mechanics of a cadillac now should can be in such perfect shape and the motor can be absolutely uh you know gold plated now it can be a you know a 16 cylinder or whatever just perfect everything perfect the gas tank filled everything just right isn't it amazing you can look at any kind of a machine and just be amazed at how it works and you know why i guess i've never really seen it but i guess in these factories where they make cars and things uh you know where those uh uh what is it called these machines robots or whatever you know i can only imagine how you would be flabbergasted i would be flabbergasted at how damn things can do it and everything i mean you know every every road or every turn everything that makes it go right in the right place and just the right distance and do just the right it's just wow you know right but how many knows it's a terrible thing when one of them get out alive and that's the same way with you and me brother sister so as long as we are in harmony with god it is amazing how smooth and how nice it can run but when you get out of harmony with god i'm here to tell you i believe that brethren said that you know whenever jesus leaves trouble sets in you begin to get away from god and just watch trouble come let that sink in get away from god trouble we'll sit in amen it did for david david was in harmony he was in such harmony with god until he could chase a lion down and kill it get his sheep back he could take a a bear and kill the bear because he took whatever shape he could go back and rejoice into a dance around the tree and praise be to god god is with me i can do all things with god he knew he could all he's invincible with god amen and then the giant in that right the giant the goliath how did god was with him god was with david david was nothing but a little cupbearer a little food bringer isn't that right for his dad sending him down there taking give my my children my boys some videos he went there and he seen the middle he brought the middles and so forth and the brothers yeah said you are little rascal you just come down here because you want to see the battle you want to see some blood flying and stuff didn't you no you want to see some fighting going on crazy stuff yeah yeah that's what you came no but he did see the giant he did see the giant and he was in such harmony with god let me tell you something the difference between a christian that can get something done with god and a christian that can't is when god makes it real because none of them people come volunteering out of those foxholes none of his brothers volunteered to go face this guy and david was the ruddiest of them all but when he had it in his heart and he seen him define the armies of living god he remembered the bear this guy don't look as vicious as that lion live with his great big teeth huh no he may be big he may be tall but i know this guy can come down and he got an inspiration now inspired by god i can take him down he ain't too big god's much bigger than he is oh boy the scenario of what we have of how that he said and he says i'll take him you know because he made this big boast one of y'all come match me if we die if if you kill me we'll be your servants if we kill him you'll be our servants well i wish you didn't have more kings like that don't you huh let putin and whoever's in go at it you know just let them go out there and get their best man or whatever just be between two men instead of whole armies huh probably be a whole lot better off ukrainians a lot of people lost their lives folks think about it i think russia's at 34 000 men lost or something like that that's a lot of lives lost for a little puny devilish feud that's all it is it's a devil that gets jealous or wants land or once more and it's not satisfied and you know that's all that is there's a bunch of devils operating in in indonesians now back to my thought let's get back off of putin and then will you ah lord but think about david the harmony that he had and he had to go and he he challenged him and saul and everybody the doubt that went through people's mind about this guy but i like it you know you know the good part about it is he could look in saul's face and say saul i'll take that guy and i will bring him down i guarantee you cause i'll tell you about a bear let me tell you about this bear that came in the line i can kill them because god is with me and somehow he convinced saul to let him go and of course all put all of his big armor on and everything shields and swords and everything else and he got hidden behind it all he says get this stuff all off i mean i haven't tried this shielding this sword just let me have this little sling i've proven that isn't that right and he went out there and of course he killed goliath he brought him down and became very famous he was such harmony with god that god directed that stone oh my how many likes to be directed by god when god directs you to a job he or directs you to this or that or the other amen just today just today i always pray lord what do you want me to do today and he told me what to do and it was you know and now i did huh you know just every day ask god what god wants you to do how many with me you know so that god will lead you and guide you in everything that you do that's how we're supposed to be walk by faith walk by faith in god what oh harmony when i think about harmony i think about armies i think about armies that you can look and how they're boy there when they're marching boom stepping in harmony why do you come to to be unified when you think about harmony you think about unity think about oneness everybody do it in harmony and that's what if that's what wins battles you've got great walls not everybody you know it's it's the trouble is and defeat comes from disarray defeat comes from disarray that's the way it is with your life you want to really get away from god and get everything all up get upset and and man you don't know what's up what sounds the devil's right on there and he's going to get you he's going to give you a lot of trouble but when you're in your prayer you pray every morning pray at noon pray at night you're tuned with god the devil won't be able to get in there are you with me and you get a church you get a group of people like this right here and the only way that we'll ever have is a really old-fashioned holy ghost beating is when everybody gets in the same mind gets of one accord of one mind how many believes that it takes that unity takes that harmony if you don't have that harmony and it takes god to bring that harmony amen praise be to god and that's what we desire in that harmony it's unity to where god can come and work whenever god is up here working and he's working there something's gonna happen but when the god is here and he's not there it's gonna be a quiet service or if it's back over there or something can we turn this around a little bit let's turn it around on the preacher you come to church and you're just expecting something oh man you're just expecting a fireball you're expecting god to speak to your heart and the guy so backsliddy can't even preach huh it's not inspired it's just come from his mental stuff huh you might not get back and you go out the door boy i didn't get what i expected because how many knows that's got to be right this is god it takes both amen when you say jesus christ died the same sinners what does the congregation say [Music] amen it just takes a unification amen when you say god came to sometimes his sons and daughters he comes to mold us and shape us into his image that's better think about it it takes both takes harmony to bring the holy spirit because your holy spirit is not going to go in this array just like you get a bunch of fuss in a fight to the church brother ben says holy spirit leave you ain't going to have no kind of revival whatsoever when people are fussing to murmur because i'll tell you this right now that's out of the will of god when you fuss and you remember that is out of the will of god so what i said to say what to say on that was the prayer thing this is our heart's desire our prayer is to be more like christ how many believe that and if you believe in predestination and foreknowledge of god god knowing all things predestinating all things according to romans the 8th chapter it says in verse 28 he says for we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god aren't you glad for that that's harmony promising that god's going to make it come out good for them that love god to them that who are called according to how you want to do it no his purpose for whom he did for no i he also did predestinate oh my god knew everything he knew i was going to end before it ever started he know what's going to happen in the millennium he knows the battle of gog and magog that's going to go on after the millennium he knows when the new city is going to come down from heaven as adorned as a bride and to a husband in revelation he knows everything glory i hope you're part of it so he foreign for something and i like this and then it's our prayer this is our prayer is that we are predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son now there's a lot of people that i wouldn't mind being like brother branham is one of them paul's another many different ones david they're a different one but that number the chief one that i want to be like is jesus [Music] let me tell you something if you aren't desiring to be closer to jesus and more like jesus then you ain't got enough of jesus is what you need to have in your heart right now because i guarantee you when you get a little bit of the holy ghost you want more holios when you get to be a little more like christ you want more like christ it is you know i was thinking on the way to church it says anything that you have any victory that you have or are going to have is something that has to be placed in your heart to have isn't that right god has to put it in there otherwise you'll never get victory you'll never overcome be able to never be a son of god unless god put something there to be for you desire to be like christ and i'll tell you this if you are a son of god god automatically predestinated he put a desire in your heart to be like christ amen to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first monk born among many brethren praise be to god amen church age book page um well i got the wrong page let's go to the right page first if i can find it here it is all right this is the about the only quote i have i guess but this is where i went to after the lord showed me about harmony and i began to think and i came to mind of this quote that the prophet god said he makes this statement notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father praise be to god oh my i'm here to tell you we wouldn't have so many flops we wouldn't have so many disappointments if we would pray about everything we did more because he did nothing jesus didn't knew nothing even brother brennan remember one place brother bam talk about how he needs to have more faith and just believe and i'm always waiting for him to do something but if you'll look at his ministry and the rest of his life you'll find that he went back to just doing what the father showed him huh yeah you got to have faith to move out and all that but then in the core of it all your heart desires whatever god wants me to do that's what i want to do because you'll find yourself missing a lot of times outside of that amen oh my the harmony and notice how that in my bible reading tonight if you'll notice there was many it says all those porches were full of impotent people people who are in dire need in bad shape and he walked by all of them and went to that one man and healed him and left huh logically speaking sometimes we don't understand why that would be amen but jesus just didn't do his own thing he did what the father showed him amen and people wonder well where was the father up in heaven where's the father at no amen peter and them says where's the father you keep talking about the father show us the father and it'll be it'll suffice us and jesus says have i been this long with you and you still don't know you still don't understand let me tell you the children out there still don't understand about jesus and the father he says we are one amen when when thomas fell down in front of him he says my lord and my god amen jesus had to tell him i and my father are one if you have seen me you have seen the father because the fullness of the body the godhead the bible says dwelled in him all that god was he poured into christ he was god was right there and the father was the spirit that was in him amen and it was in him and that spirit would show him everything he would show him the way the same way how many believes it's the same way with you and i god the holy spirit leading us and guiding us now i don't know about you but i want to be more and more sensitive to that spirit speaking to me on a daily basis i always like to put in my prayer in the morning and lord fellowship with me today speak with me today fellowship with me because god desires fellowship don't he he loves fellowship and then lord help my thick head and my busy schedule not to be so much that i can't hear you when i use amen because when he talks folks i'm here to tell you there's nothing like it amen so you'll notice the father the harmony between the father and the son he never did anything until the father showed him now this is next statement he makes like this not truly believe that it's true and i just not thought of it but i had a scripture of how that look jesus loved harmony jesus loves harmony um i guess either can i pause because another thought came in my mind that is the whole universe how many knows the whole universe the stars the moon if the moon come too close it would mess everything up if it went a little bit too fast it would mess everything up if it went behind a little bit it would mess things up if these are slowed down a little bit it would mess things up everything stays right where the word put it i would love to tell every atheist out there if you don't believe in god why don't you just look around and if you can't see god and know that there's a god that makes it everything you they know when haley's gone it's gonna come back they know how many times to come they can tell you all that stuff but they can't believe it god what is wrong with you huh and then you try to tell me you're smart not so much if you think that's by chance you know well anyway i'll keep my words that's not very smart praise the lord you love him but the universe everything is perfect perfect harmony and i'm here to tell you god's people are in harmony with him if you're going into rapture you're going to be in harmony with god you believe that jesus when he talked about harmony and oneness it was in saint john 17 if you want to read the whole chapter is about it but he talks about leaving the world and and so forth and as thou has sent me i sent them and so forth but in verse 26 20 says i pray not for these alone but also for them which thou shalt believe on me through their word that they may be one as thou art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us so that the world may believe that thou hast sent me amen how many believes he wants us to be one and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one oh my how i could preach tonight about how that we as children of god need to be one together brothers and sisters folks don't take that word too lightly we should take each other as brothers and sisters more than your blood more than your blood are we brothers and sisters because if you have brothers and sisters so it's not going to make it they're not going to be there in that family with you but up there we are going to be an eternal family sons and daughters of god we are one we have the same goals the same ambitions the same god the same one faith one lord one baptism one in god one god and father above all who is above all and through all i like that and he's the one that con is in each and every one of us for one by one spirit are we all baptized into one body and we are members in particular amen how many believe that amen it takes everything brother bam one place he talked about a watch and how that the old clock swatches that you had to wind up pretty spot if they had a glass on the back of it bert it'd be pretty cool to see one little one little spin spin spinning and going back and forth and the other one going this way and that one's going that way and the little wheel starts to turn it and all that other can you imagine if a bug got in there a little piece of wire got in there it would stop huh that's the way it is in your life you let one bug get in your life you like a little bit of disharmony get into your life and your relationship and fellowship with god is shut off you let a little sun come in little sin come in are you with me get away from god just a little bit and see how quick that stops it all has to be perfect amen praise the lord that they may be one as we are and and you know this just comes to me as i read this but what's he talking about he says you know i have let me read it again and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them what is his glory this law is that they may be one even as we are one amen i in them thou in me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me amen father i will that they also which thou has given me be with me where i am saint john 14 1 behold i go and prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also i'm just looking forward one of these days we're going to be with jesus yes jesus is in here now and we are with jesus in the spiritual form but i truly believe with all my heart that one of these days he's going to come in the skies and we're going to see him face to face and we're going to have a body change because the bible says we're going to have body like unto his own glorious body that's his desire his desire is that they're going to be with me how many wants to be with him amen so that's what he said be with me where i am that they may behold my glory folks we talk about a christ that died on calvary we talk about a bloody massacre i mean it was calvary was a bloody massacre unjust unrighteous and judged him wrong and he was he didn't deserve that but then killed him anyway y'all know the story of the bloody cobblestone streets and the blood on his back until he looked like a bloody rag that was our king of kings it was glorious in that he wiped away our sins but what's it going to be when he comes in his splendor when he comes and the clouds are all around and all the hosts of heaven and all the angels are around what's gonna be like folks that is what you live for that's what you breathe every breath you breathe should be for that amen everything else is a distraction waste of time amen because that's the only thing that's going to last that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loved me before the foundation of the world how many believe that god loved you before the foundation of the world all whose names were not written in the land book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world will wander after the beast god loved you before the foundation of the world that's why he loved you first we love him because he first loved us amen harmony praise the lord jesus never did anything until he was first showed by the father this harmony this harmony is now to exist whew i like that don't you i don't care they said this back in the 60s brothers on they said it in the 70s he preached it in the 80s they preached it in the 90s they preached in the year 2000 here 2000 the teens it's hard to believe we don't went through the teams ain't it we're in the 20s now 22 my gracious pretty soon they'll be 2030 if we aren't careful huh unbelievable it seemed like two days ago that we were all shook up about whether our computers were going to shut out shut down in the year 2000 now freezers and many people probably bought generators and all this other the other huh here we are the babies that were born thin are now 22 years old my oh my no wonder i feel old all right disharmony is now i like that now how many would say yes amen this harmony has to exist now 2022 disharmony has to exist now it's time for this harmony to exist that we have the same harmony as jesus did with the spirit predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son how many believes that between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life and she receives it you know many churches out there you can read predestination or something that this bible says i don't believe that we don't believe that you stand a good chance at not being there you reject his word you don't receive his word i don't think that you're on the same plane yeah you better quit dating huh because the person that dates this right here you have to be one that's what dating is all about isn't it right to find out if you're one if you're on the same mind frame that's what god is doing god is choosing a pride out of every church i come from the amish mennonite he's choosing a bride amen and he wants her to be and think the way that he thinks how many believes that this harmonies exist between the groom and bride shows his word oh my and she never doubts it how many believes that this message amen the one thing we believe is that we believe this from giver to killer so to speak and we believe the cover but it i don't know why they took it off they're always taking something away where's my words the holy bible put it back on there right harmony with me it said the whole used to say the holy bible that's what it is it's the holy bible it's god's word heaven also passed away but this will never pass a word pass away one of the things i did when i was first born again was say i'm going to believe all of it did you know that before i was saved at first i didn't even want to read the bible i said i ain't even reading the bible because i won't be close to god but there's so much mass confusion in it you know i don't know about all that huh you got a question about me now don't you yeah boy oh boy brother bottle or you're our pastor and you thought you didn't want to have the bible that's right but it wasn't a few days few weeks later something said to me believe it take that bible believe it believe all of it that's what i did i picked it up and i said i'm gonna believe this and i'm gonna believe every bit of it long before i came in a message believe every bit of it amen wasn't really saved yet but i was dedicating myself to the lord and some because i had a short perhaps a justification experience i go around i test people with this bible and i read in saint john there it says yeah uh he that is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin for he's born of god now i knew that we're supposed to rot and low down sinners not that people do you believe that do you believe that i didn't care if i didn't understand it i just wanted to know if people believe it don't tell me that's wrong because if i can't trust that what can i trust what can i believe no i don't really understand it and i didn't understand until i come into the message i tested sam golden i tested john steven when they was witnessing daryl at the saw shop i went there and i said what do you think about this scripture right here sam goldman i'll never forget it he says that's right that's nothing but the truth each seed of god cannot disbelieve a son of god cannot disbelieve this word by this word you can't deny yourself and i said whoa this is the first guy to pass the test yeah and then they begin to test me a little bit did you know the bible says in malachi 4 behold i'll send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord he'll turn the hearts of children back to the fathers it does well yeah well tell me more i don't believe i don't not believe it because it's the bible so i'm believing it that's right god sent prophet to god amen took a picture with this did miracles one miracle upon miracles about miracles whoa what yeah and he pointed us right back to what paul said right nothing but the word of god no more signing your name on a church book if you want to be a part of church you get baptized into the body of christ by those indwelling holy spirit by one spirit are we all baptized into one body that's how you get in the body that's what paul's thought that's what a man huh i had to go to that church i just want to go to that church where are you all at they told me where we're at i i don't mean to be old and repetitive but y'all want to hear it one more time where's y'all's church at right down this road over to the left and then back in the back of that is a little house right back there and it left brother john seaman with all of his family danny seaman just little kids sharon just little kids you know all dressed right proper and everything all right they left and i went back there and i looked for that house i looked and i didn't find it nowhere i couldn't find it for nothing and for two weeks i said here i thought i had found something and it's gone i got you couldn't believe how i was searching the streets i was looking i kept uh they got to come out to get some more groceries at troyers again sometime they'll come out of the bushes sometimes sure enough they did hey where y'all go i couldn't find that place i've missed these last two weeks i ain't been there because i never found your place and they described it a little better a little better if and i'm sure if somebody didn't take me back there but they described it a whole lot better when i got back there sure enough there's a little dirt lane that goes between big two big orange trees almost right it's like you're going in the back i don't know back way back in i mean it was him back in there but sure enough i found it i went back there oh my i can't even can i didn't mean to get on this here but maybe it'll help somebody but i went back there and we began to have service and we'd sit down in the living room and talk about the word and talk about the word and man we got so caught up in the spirit all of a sudden i just oh phrase meeting i almost got the shout and i'm telling you what there was an atmosphere there like you wouldn't believe they showed me the baptism and how that you're supposed to get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ nobody ever got baptized in titles of father son holy ghost only in the name of jesus christ showed me the right word he says and i says well i ain't never been baptized will y'all baptize me god see yeah we'll take you down to the philippine creek and baptize it a couple days later we went down to the philippine creek brother joe i think he showed me the dock or whatever down in there amen he went down there and i got baptized now i'm here to tell you i don't know what i was if i was saved before or not but i knew afterwards i was when i come up out of that water and that water is a slow flowing creek was back then anyway slow flowing i come up on the creek and the creek bench dried off a little bit and sat on the bank over there and i looked down there and there's a whole lot of bubbles just cruelly heading out to the ocean and man you talk about a feeling in my heart talk about feeling in my heart i thought that i was just going to be able to feathers here and just flop i was just ready to fly away i was ah so light so peaceful and watching those sins going out into the sea of god's forgetfulness and i know it wasn't the water but it was the blood taking carrying my sins and to see if god's forgetfulness amen and i'm here to tell you it never gets old i was 20 years old when i got saved 20 years old 60 years old now and he gets sweeter as the day go by i want to be more like him every day i failed him many times failing flop and everything but by god's grace i thank him for his forgiveness don't you giving you another chance all the time merciful god because he started to work and he's going to finish it amen praise be to god and ever since then you know and i'm telling my story maybe i'll just tell a little more is that all right i was on fire for god and i'd take it on people's express and go up to ohio and witness demonia and baptized money in the middle of the winter sometime in november it was freezing cold and david and baptized david that baptized moses they all got baptized and moses and david and moses and moani seem to have gotten the baptism of the holy ghost and got on fire and everything else and and and and mose one time and i was sleeping there at their house and me and moses went to bed ups and moaning and we we we was reading the scriptures he says what ask whatever you will and believe and and moses was definitely amateur and he didn't know that you don't just ask for anything but we was laying there he says well if we truly believe that let's believe that that light that that lamp right there will light before we go to bed we blew it out that light's gonna light all right i'll bleed with you if you believe it i'll leave it believe it but let's leave here believe it oh my the light lit before we went to sleep i don't care god works in a mysterious way that's good enough for me praise the lord huh hey you never know god works that way it was 9 30 tonight you never get company that late you know but we did that night somebody want to talk to moe's and they come up and lift that light but anyway and then from there you know witnessing the different people just always witness and that's why i feel so bad about myself when i think about all the people that i don't witness to that i come in contact with because that was my number one enthusiasm when i first served the lord was witness to people you know do you know god sent a prophet do you know that god sent malachi 4. jesus christ came and proved himself just as alive as when he was walking the shores of galilee did the very same things for 30 some odd years world over jesus did not brother madam jesus did being a witness to people and then i think about sometimes i just get caught up in other things so much and don't do that as much i'll tell you what i believe that if i'd done my job this church should probably have a lot more people in it what about you it would do our job because really that's what we're here for god threw us to be a light to the world how many knows we are the light of the world as the father has sent me jesus said so sent i them the works that i do shall you do also if we have the life of jesus in us then we're going to do what jesus done how many believes that praise be to god and then one day the way that i become a preacher didn't really expect it didn't see it coming but my pastor asked me to preach if i'd preach i preach never thought about that i really thought about preaching i was just witnessing you know just having my bible under my arm wherever i went telling people and talking to people god gifted me god's always gifted i don't know john hershberger is here but some of them of going into the scriptures and being able to explain things and make it a little simpler i've always been gifted with being able to do that and so but i never thought about being preached or whatever and and then when he asked me to preach i preached i would caught up in the pulpit brother danny i got up in the pulpit and that first time i preached i was on faith or something you know and it just really flowed it really went good i just really really went good but the next time i didn't really get out of the way and it wasn't so good i did a little bit of flip-flopping before i got up on my feet and amen and i'll tell you this even i'll say this even in the old church you know that i was not as good as preachers i could have been hello amen i am not today but by god's grace i pray the lord will help me amen how many any preacher you always say lord i could be better i could do better amen but one thing's for sure i have to stay in harmony with god how about you if you want to get anything from god you got to stay in harmony with him all right it's just ten after eight that clock hasn't quit or anything right all right we're good can we go ten more minutes let's go a little bit longer and talk about harmony but i like this because he says that this harmony is to exist between a groom and the bride amen the harmony of what in other words however jesus was it's what we're supposed to be amen whatever kind of relationship that he had is the relationship you and i are going to have to have before we leave this place page 171 of the church age book brother ben put it this way i think brother uh brad touched on it here uh on his last sermon talking about a seed that's planted that seed's going to bring forth whatever is planted amen and this message seed listen whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride church will come to the headstone and she will be a superchurch a super race because how many knows that's what jesus was jesus was superman jesus was super man he could walk on the water he could bring people back from being four days dead that's superman just speak the word they come back praise be to god peter was in such harmony with jesus that even he could walk on the water until he got a little bit distracted huh folks i have the other half of this message and the other half of this message is about when you come out of harmony with god i mean it was when david got out of harmony with god you talk about trouble sitting in i want to just make a statement i hope he ever hears it here and out there you get out of the will of god and you're in for some major chaos you're in for major trouble i'm talking about the will of god it's very important that you find the will of god because if you ain't in that will you ain't part of the program god ain't gonna bless it because all jesus did was whatever the will of the father was i'm just gonna say this um maybe i could do it verse 20 let me see if i have it five no no i don't have it i've got it wrote down here yeah john john 4 34. it is 4 30 4. we'll start with verse 30 1. in the meantime while his disciples prayed him saying master eat and he said unto them i have meat tea that you know not of therefore said the disciples one to another had any man brought him ought to eat remember when he went to fetch me when they come back said jesus said unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me praise be to god can we just revel in that thought for just a minute everybody who likes food likes a good rib eye potatoes baked beans anytime you get hungry all the time you want to eat you want to eat oh boy we like to eat too much huh jesus says when it comes to hunger when it comes to wanting something needing something to eat my father's doing my father's will is my mean that's what satisfies me you get that it will only a real believer his real meat what makes him happy what satisfies him is to do the father's will then you feel full and you feel satisfied if you do the father's will and that's the holy spirit in you his will praise be to god i love him better every day i love him better every day folks there's a lot of people that have to sing that different i don't love him as much today i don't love him i don't feel like singing so much today huh isn't that terrible how many wants to love him more i love him better every day my meat is to do the father's will let me finish the quote there is super church a super race you're going to have to be super if you're going to overcome this age because i'm here to tell you the devil is throwing everything out there that he's got every instrument every trick that he's got you want to know why the politicians i mind goodness if you would look at the politics of this country in this world you wouldn't want no part of it but yet people are gung-ho about these things they're gung-ho about the left they're gung-ho about transsexuality and oh they're gung-ho oh they they pushing it they hate the right they're passionate about it why because there's a spirit behind it it's an evil spirit behind it that's driving this world amen oh my i don't want to get political but it's sad isn't it you can have no confidence in your government when they can't balance their own checkbook and they're 30 trillion dollars in debt and they want to tell you how you ought to do i don't think so you know they lose you lose your con your confidence in them just because of that alone and then everything else and how many knows it's run by the devil jesus offered him all the kingdoms of the world if he'll just bow down before him oh my can you imagine i don't even want to try to imagine if jesus would have took it i don't know what it had been like if he took in the offer yeah i'll be the king of the world i'll i'll rule everything let me tell you something i feel under the anointing of the holy spirit there wasn't even a slight chance that was going to happen there wasn't even a slight chance the thought of the whole thing is even irrelevant and stupid to think of what it would have been like because he would have never taken it never ever would he have to he's god because he would have been under the domain of the devil that ain't gonna happen amen get thee behind me satan what was it the prophet said he got singed he got zapped by a uh uh nuclear megaton bomb or a or so many wires he got fried he got his feather singed that day get thee behind me satan thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god amen and him only shalt thou worship because if he fell down on the devil he'd been worshiping the devil there's only one that he worshipped amen super church surprise how many knows that you've got to folks i'm telling you if you're christian and you are a victorious i'm saying if you're a victorious christian today you are super i was thinking on the way to church i believe the prophet made the statement he says what would it be like if everybody would submit themselves to god and everybody would be a christian what a wonderful world it would be and we were all one because i was looking looking under the unity and harmony and so forth he says if we were all under harmony and unity of god what it would be like then on the way to church i wonder why it isn't why is it that it's so evil out there there's only one answer because the seed of the wicked one way outnumbers god's people huh how many knows it way out numbers i believe when brother branham talked about he says you know it's like a great big bunch of darkness and then just once in a while you'll see a white light quite light white light there's a christian there's a once in a while once in a while in that darkness there's a white light everything else is darkness that's about what this world is now notice in closing as she nears him she'll be a super race super people as she nears him they in the bride they will be so much like him until they will be in his very image i hope everybody here i know you did i hope everybody there heard that that if you're a part of the bride of christ you're going to be in the image of god you're going to be in that predestinated image of god form as we get closer oh my as we feel the pressure of laodicea the pressure of this age it presses the people so much until they crayon themselves everywhere they put earrings and nose rings and everything else but the bride it pushes you into christ how many believes that the pressure pushes the bride closer and closer to god if that's not working in your life you need to have a good altar call alter somewhere and say god i'm not getting closer to you like i should just what comes to my mind you will be more careful about your conduct your attitude every day not just when you come to church or get around friends but when you're in business all your business associates no matter who you're dealing with you'll want them to see the reflection of christ it's a whole i don't know it's okay i'll say what the spirit says it's a whole lot better to lose a little money and have people to think of you as a christian than it is for you to get the better deal and them to hate you not think of you as a christian like i said that just comes amen there in the bride will be so much like him that they will be in his very image this is in order to be united with him amen they will be one philippians i believe it is let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus lord let my mind be your mind lord that i don't want my own i want yours lord how many is with me tonight lord i want to thank your thoughts i want the holy spirit to think the thoughts that i'm supposed to think i want the holy spirit to guide me because if i am guided by this my mind and my heart by the spirit i will be pleasing to the father god bless you let's stand tonight you'll be in a place to where when you do ask god something he will honor it how many wants to be there when you ask god we'll give it to you because you don't ask a miss i truly believe if you're in harmony with god the way that you should be he will lead you on what to ask and in the way to ask it because i believe it was paul that said that the spirit makes intercessions with our prayers he is the one that basically prays for us and asks for us with our heads bowed tonight how many needs a closer walk with him how many wants to be in his very image lord jesus you see these hands that went up quickly because god that's all we care about we don't care anybody anything in this world we only care about one thing and that is that we're pleasing to you our meat our satisfaction is in doing your will lord and lord in our hearts desire his father to be in such harmony with you like like jesus was in the spirit with the spirit god that we would do nothing but what you show us first and everything you tell us we believe and accept and receive and we know that even death can't touch us because lord we acknowledge and have come into you lord jesus and have eternal life you said that even though he were dead yet shall he live and he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die when we take that last breath we know that we don't go into an unconscious state and state there but father we come right over into your presence and we stay alive because we never die according to your word lord draw every hand that is up right now closer to you lord and those that are not here but streaming i pray god that you would do the same for them god that you would bring them to a closer walk with you and that their character their mind their heart their soul ambition goal would be that of jesus christ father for we are absolutely without doubt in our hearts and minds planning to see you one of these days face to face and god the day is late the hour growth light evening shadows have fallen it's time for you to come we want to be ready lord we ask god that you'd help each one now not just to come to this wednesday night service and go out the same but folk saying god that is truly what i want lord it's my heart's desires to be in your image lord to think the way that you do to be led by the spirit the way that you were led and everything that we do every day god help us to pray and say lord lead me in this guide me in this i need you lord and then to watch you and how we can worship and praise you when we see you in our lives leading us guiding us directing us blessing us nothing can stand on our way lord whenever you're there but lord help us never to get in out of harmony lord with you father we want nothing to do with that we ask your blessing upon each one on jesus christ's name amen and amen musicians
