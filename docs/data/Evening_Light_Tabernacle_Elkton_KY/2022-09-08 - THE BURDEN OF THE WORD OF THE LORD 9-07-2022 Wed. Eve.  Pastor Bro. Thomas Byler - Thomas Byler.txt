tonight on our midweek services certainly enjoyed amen last weekend praise the lord and so i feel like i have something that'll probably maybe maybe just be a uh kind of go along with that thought amen and so amen just trust that the lord have his way tonight amen we do want to just remember sister johnis i know she really needs to touch the lord amen she really does amen and so if he wants her to have some more time here we pray that that time would be quality and it would be good amen and so the lord can raise her up or he can take her home but we certainly for our sakes we'd like to have her around a little longer amen amen but amen so god bless you amen let's bow our hands lord jesus we just come before you this morning the lord jesus to be able to assemble ourselves together father lord knowing that you are in our midst because you promised that you would be lord we thank you father again lord you promised never to leave us nor to forsake us even to the end of the world lord we have arrived we've come here father we're right here at the end now lord and we just desire god that you'll take tonight's service lord and as we come with hearts of expectation lord we ask god that you would just come and speak to us father minister to us help us lord to be able to go from these doors better and not worse for we know your prophet said we'll go one way or the other lord so we ask god that you just take the lord and let your holy spirit come into the word of god and minister to our hearts father tonight we ask it in jesus name amen and amen if you will turn to his eagle ezekiel i'm sorry it's not ezekiel it's zachariah amen zachariah that is one of my scriptures that i have and zechariah wasn't even marked in my tabs so i had a real hard time finding it there's zechariah okay yeah just before malachi amen zechariah the 12th chapter just one scripture there one verse it says the burden of the word of israel saith the lord which stretches forth the heavens and layeth the foundations of the earth that formeth the spirit of man within him and then we want to go over to luke the book of luke the 12th chapter luke 12. and we'll begin with verse 41 then peter says unto him lord speakest thou this parable unto us or even to all and the lord said who then is that faithful and wise servant steward whom his lord hath shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season blessed is that servant whose whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat them to men servants maidservants and to eat and to drink and to be drunken the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him asunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers and that servant which knew his lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes now here's my point for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men shall have committed much of him they will ask the more amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word amen my title is the burden of the word of the lord amen the burden of the word of the lord amen and i was just thinking and how that uh you know we love to enjoy the peace of god that passes understanding amen the joy that is unspeakable and full of glory amen uh we love that jesus came and he says and you know that come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest amen for my burden is easy and my uh my yoke is easy i believe he said and my burden is light amen so tonight we want to talk about burden with the help of the lord for just a little talk about burden amen of course uh burden is a weight amen something that perhaps weighs you down or uh i i think of it as a responsibility amen that has been given amen and man of course you know on the on many many different ways we can look at burden and in the aspect of life itself amen you know you're born in sin shaped with iniquity come into this world speaking lies and we know that life itself from the beginning to the end is a burden amen it's hard never was geared just to be easy and it's a burden it's a responsibility amen and it's never easy but you know there's so many different things and amen and it's and then there's the burden of sin amen the burden of condemnation amen the burden of guilt all these things weigh you down and it reminds me a little of pilgrim's progress remember the big backpack and this heavy weight that he had and he carried it everywhere and man his purpose was to get rid of that weight get rid of that burden you know and it wasn't until he met christ that he could take that load off and he made him be free praise god how many knows that's the way it is with every person that comes into this world amen you've got to wait on you you know and that's why people go crazy that's why there's just it's just so much weight amen just to wait many times just a weight of having to try to keep up with things and paying your rent if you know uh paying your car payment but the insurance all of this weight on top of amen having something in here that people are trying to satisfy with everything that they do they try to lift that weight a little bit we know that drinking and all of that drugs that people do they're just trying to get rid of the weight they're trying to get rid of the burden that's on them because it's a heavy weight it's a heavy burden people put their gun to their head and pull the trigger because they want they want to get rid of the weight they taught it can't do it anymore it's a heavy burden just comes that song you know we were shackled with a heavy burden neath the load of guilt and shame and so forth but then the hand of jesus touched me now i am no longer the same praise god how many knows that when you got a load when you're carrying a lot it's hard to be happy it's hard to have joy it's hard to be free that's why you find so many people amen that they do not have the joy they do not have peace they have a frown and not a smile because they don't know the peace that passes under they don't know this amen but we find also that a christian christians after you get the holy ghost after you have the joy after that burden is gone then there's another burden that we have huh you're not done with burden you're not done with being heavy you're not done with all of that now it goes into a different aspect because i want you to know that just because you're completely free just because you completely have the joy of god and the peace of god in your heart you're still not free from responsibility amen amen because one just one little thing that you know jesus said you the first bible says that he is the light of all jesus is the light of the world but then jesus says you now you're going to be the light of the world you're going to be a christian he called you to be the light of the world praise be to god that's the responsibility amen you become a steward you become a servant to the lord how many knows i don't care who you are who you serve if you are a servant you're you're a slave to somebody you're somebody's slave and we know that you and i have been bought huh we went up to that auction block so to speak isn't that right and we got sold you got to get sold you're going to get sold you're going to you're going to be somebody's slave you're going to be somebody's servant let me know jesus said you can't you know you're going to serve one master or the other you have a master that you're going to serve and that becomes a weight amen it becomes a burden or a weight that we feel i was looking at this weight i was looking at this burden and looking at these things and brother baby says you should be in the meetings and feel people wait and and see how what a burden is for a minister amen because he's responsible whether that is a successful meeting or whether it's not a successful meeting and he talked about those that were giving out prayer cards and even his lois his sister-in-law i guess he called it was and he talked about how that she was doing things and trying to keep up and she had to take two days off he said just lay in the bed because the weight of it because the burden of it he said billy paul giving out prayer cards and this one once said maybe he'll try to pay your money for it he'll try anyway and he's got to keep it all straight no this ain't right he you know and yeah you get the prayer card but you don't well that one may be in a wheelchair and this one doesn't have anything available all of the responsibility all that weighs on them and they brother man says man it's it's something else gotta have a break from it amen but the burden so we see here and we think about it we think about the burden of the word of the lord how many knows how the bible says that to whom much is forgiven there's our weight already there's our burden to them much will be required how many believes message believers are going to be required a lot of you and i required a lot of of what we do with what has been given us and according to the scripture that we have read it's very important because even jesus says you know he gave one a certain talent give another certain talent give another certain talent what did you do with it any one of us knows that you've been a christian in a while amen you look back at your christian life and you look at what you did with your christian life what did you do what did you accomplish one place brother bam says how many souls have you brought to christ i mean he says if you haven't brought an event he says then you're guilty you're guilty of being unprofitable because the purpose is lost souls amen amen all right let's look at this for a little bit but says you know would you like to know what i think the greatest need of the church is today where i think the lacking is he says is there's no travail the people are not broke up enough he says there's no burden no burden seemingly he says you give me someone that's just so tore up about lost souls that they cry and they're wanting a revival so bad till they can't hardly eat and so forth amen if you'll read the history of the world religious history you'll find out it's always taking that kind of a spirit to bring a revival you know i just thought about travail how many knows that the travail of soul when zion is in travail she brought forth i don't care if you're working it takes travel of working to get something done amen and if you want something from god it takes travail it takes travail travailing a burden a desire to have you won't get nowhere if you ain't got no desire to get somewhere that's what he says that's the problem people have no burden anymore they're just laxatical oh brother brandon best describes it let me go on now look he says if this church if i'd say this morning in this little group of people here god would say now look william brown i'm going to make you answer for that group of people what you tell them now do you want them all to shout i say sure i want them all to shout amen do you want them all to speak in tongues yeah i want every one of them to do you want to them to answer the spirit yes i want every one of you to dance in the spirit all right well that's very good but what would you rather have them do but i says i'd rather have a church that had such a burden such a burden on their hearts for prayer that they just stayed at the altar and would be there day and night wouldn't it be something if we just have to tell the deacons look there's people praying here and and we're already at 9 30 and they're gonna keep on praying huh we're just gonna leave the doors open and everybody goes home that wants to and let them lock it up maybe they'd stay all night can you imagine we've never seen something like that have we but they used to do it they used to could pray all night amen a burden on their heart for prayer day and night and everything else and in their house was constantly in prayer and humble and trying to get people to come to god amen how many of you that's a it's like a fire that's in there in your soul once you once the once the word comes into here it becomes the burden how do you know you don't lose your joy you don't lose your peace but there's something different there's another party that's a burden that's heavy [Applause] what is that this kind of come to me as i was sitting there listening to brother luke and i was thinking you know we should feel like jesus felt because how many knows god give us these feelings and there to be in the right place how did jesus feel amen how many knows that jesus was god himself there's nobody had peace like he did he says my peace i give unto you so he had peace to give he had the very peace of god he had the very joy of god but yet he had the burden of the whole world upon him [Applause] and it was a heavy burden a burden that you and i don't have to bear [Music] he had done he knew he had to go to that cross and every man's sin every everybody was on him he wasn't just pastoring a church he was pastoring the whole world he was responsible for everybody and it wasn't easy no even though he had peace in his heart and so forth yet the bible says that he is despised and rejected of men he was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief how many knows that's a christian now remember if the life of god is in you that's the things you'll experience amen acquainted with grace it reminds me of wherever bam says you know he says man i tell you what i have been cut deep many times deep many times sure keeping cut knee brother man says man sometimes you have no idea what goes with this type of ministry why in the world would somebody desire to be a prophet you have any idea the weight that he carried responsibility that he had now it just comes to me now but acquainted with grief and sorrows brother bannon he loved people he tried to get everybody he with the ministry that he had he says i've won two thousand so two million souls he says and i should have won many more with the ministry that god gave see ministry is mean to minister to to give out with what he had given him he should have won a lot more because why that discernment and christ coming down and man he should add more and he's one at one point in his life as you know he came to where he was disappointed in people he loved people so much he cared so much because that's what a christian does they care how many knows it hurts to care because that care will be trampled on it'll be thrown back in your face and everything else that care will amen and he cared and he got discouraged well if that's how they're going to be i'm just going to the mountain and so forth and he had to regain that love and he had to come to a realization the one thing that he came to a realization is that not everybody's predestinated to receive it he came to place look i can't i can't go crazy because people won't come i can't i can't do that i have to just realize that all of that is in god's hand my responsibility is just to preach the gospel and at the end when he didn't have but a couple of open doors to go to it didn't make any difference he stayed with the word of god amen my so he knew he knew what the pain was he knew what a burden was the burden of a christian life the burden of the word of the lord responsibility that comes with it amen so christ it says that he was acquainted with grief we hid our faces as it were from him he was despised and we esteemed them not surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did assume him stricken smitten of god and afflicted he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed praise the lord it says verse seven he was oppressed he was afflicted yet opened need out his mouth how many knows he came to his own and his own received him not no matter how many times he rejected him he kept loving him so much he was trying his best to get him saved he was trying to try his best until he was outside of jerusalem and the bible says he wept didn't he he wept your jerusalem jerusalem how i would have hovered you at the end of the brew but you would not huh paul had such a burden he had that same life of christ until he says i wish myself a curse for my brother's sake huh he had so much of a love for him how many times he would stand out there on the temple doors and on the entryways of places wherever he could and he would back it with his hands he'd tell them israelites and so forth that he preached and we tried to get him convinced of who jesus was huh he had the burden of bringing the gospel to the gentiles didn't he amen through much pain through much suffering paul said it this way in first second corinthians four and seven he says we are in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power made of god and not of us i like that how many knows that the excellency of power it's not what you can do but it's what god can do to you that's what's so excellent that's what's so great [Music] oh paul said we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed now notice this as christians we're always bearing about the dying of the lord jesus people will spit you in your face basically so to speak they'll persecute you they'll do everything that they did to jesus amen see here we in laodicea here in the age we're living we got it real nice because how many of those there in those dark ages they knew what it was like to bear their cross they knew what it's like to get killed like christ died huh they knew what it was like to be persecuted to be hunted down to to be forsaken to be cast down they experienced all of those things we experienced it on a minor scale so to speak it amen comes to mind but sometimes we get discouraged i believe sometimes we get discouraged when it comes to witnessing amen remember brother baby says you know in desperation he says after what christ has done now he manifested himself it should throw every believer into desperation amen that the coming of the lord is at hand praise the lord let's go to another scripture hmm another scripture in well i don't believe i wrote it down here it is no it was it would have been ezekiel yeah ezekiel 9. ezekiel 9. now remember what brother ben talked about he says he would love for his church to shout speaking tongues dance in the spirit but what was the greatest thing that he wanted the people to have a burden a burden from the lord for the loss amen let's start with verse three and the glory of god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with the with linen which had the writer's ink horn by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations have done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye petty slay utterly old and young both maids and little children women come not near unto any but come not on nine to any man upon whom is the mark and begin in church and begin in at my sanctuary woo how many knows if there's anybody that's heard it it's the churches huh the people that call themselves christians when the wrath of god is poured out amen that's who he's coming first amen then they began at the ancient men which were up before the house now notice going back again put a mark now y'all remember what brother brandon preached on the evidence of the holy ghost he says if there any evidence that i know if that would be a evidence of the holy ghost according to the scripture it's those that have the holy ghost they get mark it's those that sigh and cry for the abominations that's done in the city now let me ask you why do you think that it i don't know about you but it hurts me every time they do something immoral like legalizing uh a gays marriage i mean that was a disappointment like oh it hurts you why because it's an abomination that's done it's like oh my goodness where are we going then from there to now it's you know telling them and having this um what what did they even call it something about your the way that you talk and and a woman's be so supposed to be called the one that is child bearing person or something right instead of a woman or a wife and it's just one thing after the other and you're like my god help us so in other words tonight how many knows and that we should ask ourselves how much how much does that affect us even the sins and everything that's done everything is done wrong should affect you say god don't let this be don't let that bad every time somebody's backslidder gets away from god oh god don't let it backslide the burden of the word of the lord the burden of that holy spirit in there amen it's a burden that we need to have amen now i mean this brother bam says i say this now reverently walking on brittle threads i believe that that day is about finished them that's in is in the doors are closing together you don't have that burden no more amen billy graham's meetings across the country all roberts and all the rest of us we've cried we've prayed everything else but you see the doors are closing let him that's filthy be i'm quoting now let him that's righteous be righteous still holy that's holy still and i believe the doors of the gentiles is closing together the day the time to season is just about over if it was back then can you imagine how close it is now you see wouldn't it be nice if we had 20 people come and we could get 20 people coming to church huh maybe have half of those get baptized my gracious if you had 10 baptism of the weekend that'd be a record wouldn't it one day used to do hundreds and hundreds of people when the revival was on amen somebody said brother tommy invited a whole bunch of people and he got one person to come one person okay huh isn't that about how it is people you know it it it's hard it's hard when when you try and want to but the problem is people don't want it anymore brother bram says one place a pawn has just about been sane dry you really don't find a lot of people that really care [Music] they don't care about their souls they don't care about when you bring them to truth they just want to go their way to tarshish so to speak their own way my that's the hour that we're living in and we as christians we have to really be careful that even though it's in that shape and you know maybe some people don't want it but we should still be trying to get people in still be a witness i mean you shall be witness of me amen cried and prayed you see the doors are closing on down of the gentiles about the day the seas is just about over just few more to come in the reason that you can't have that kind of meeting like that he said there's no travail is so people they just don't have their burden you don't find it no more what's the matter the spirit of god is withdrawn now how many of those you can't you can't work something up no it has to be god that comes down it has to be god that does it a revival and a sweeping revival it is something that god does i remember when pinecraft had their revival brother john he was down there with us when we seen a lot of people are we seeing the brother john steam when we seen that church grow we've seen uh you know all kinds of different ones coming in and so forth just a little revival and people coming to god and so forth it's hard to find even that anymore but listen to what he says the spirit is almost withdrawn jesus predicted this he said uh because the love of many their love would fail because iniquity would abound the love of many shall fail amen see they grow cold love is dying away people don't care anymore folks people don't care they don't care about god they don't care about church they don't care about their neighbor there's not enough care in the world there's not enough love in the world it's dying away the number one thing is that that love for god that's the first thing because i guarantee you if you have the love of god in your heart you will not want to be a hermit no if you have the love of god in your heart you want to try you want to try to give what you have to other people it should hurt us when we go to walmart we see everybody all tattooed up the way that they're dressed they don't have to be that way they can have what you have if they'll just receive it how many believes that if they'll just accept it amen it's because love is dying away it's just the form listen they got into just the form beat the piano up and down real hard and hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise the lord see like that and he says yet it's just the form huh don't fool yourself just don't fool yourself see oh my now he said i'm not just talking about the tabernacle i'm talking about what i find around the united states it's just become a form just kind of acting like what we used to have a bunch of actors people just acting amen but brother ben says oh brother sister god have mercy on us then he says at the end god have mercy on us oh my listen but it says we are responsible god has put us here on earth for a reason and that reason that he put us here for we're responsible for to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do amen how many believes you hear how many beliefs you have a purpose sure we've all got a purpose let me say this we've all been given a talent i don't care what it is but god has given you a talent he didn't just call you to save you he came and he gave you something to do he gave you a talent you have to find what that talent is what is it that god wants you to do and he says you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do if you went to work for a man and he give you a job on a ranch or something another you can't just sit out in the barns and wonder what to do you must go ask him what he wants you to do and then do it if you're really working for a man what find out what your duties are and if our life on earth here then we should go to the one who put us here lord what would you have me to do amen praise be to god oh my i'm gonna let me finish this and i'll go on what must i do why am i here if it's to be a housewife a dishwasher whatever god wants you to do then you do the very best that you know how to do it hey man put that in your hard drive remember that if you don't remember anything else remember find out what god wants you to do it then do the best job that can be done on it amen i'm sure we could have an altar call on that lord help me to do a better job at what i do all right that's right trouble of it is each one wants to do the next man's job huh he says we all want to pack the ball amen we got we we got the linemen those great big 300 pound guys huh jumping over when the guy hikes the ball and he grabs it before the quarterback gets it does i want to run at this time huh can you imagine i don't care how fat he is he ain't going to get nowhere well heavy he is why because you're all gonna get him better man how many brothers had a lot of that problems impersonating trying to be a prophet don't try to be that don't try to be something you're not find out what god wants you to do it doesn't matter what it is oh he goes on down be the best i mean no it's just a housewife she's got one of the gravest responsibilities there is she's got the burden of raising them children of teaching them children the way of the lord that's her job by the time she says he says she's only really got about a 20-25 window your window there and when them kids are grown and get what they're gone your job's done so do the best job that you can fathers how many knows as a father it's a burden amen marriage brother he talks about here you know how did it's a great responsibility amen let me read a couple more quotes that all right now because that we have a responsibility then we've got to answer to god for some day whoa huh how many believes that we'll answer for what we did with that talent every man that come on the face of the earth has to answer to god for that responsibility and too many of us stewardship a stewardship we have to answer for this responsibility is a stewardship that's been committed to us by god i don't care what it is like i said a few minutes ago a housewife be a genuine housewife if it's to be a farmer be a genuine farmer whatever it is that god has put you here for you've got a stewardship to that and you've got the answer to god for it because it takes all these things to do it jonah he says he was called and here we find an example of all of us every one of us we're always respon we're always re running from responsibility because i mean a responsibility is a way it's it's a weight it's a burden people don't even like to hear that you've got to decide whether you want to go to heaven or hell they don't want to do that they don't want to hear that because now they're responsible for it because the bible says once you know it hey if you don't know it there'll only be a few stripes giving you for doing it wrong but if you know it don't do it you'll get a lot of stripes my think about the people that walk away from the message of the hour they know that it was right everybody that heard it all of those preachers and everybody brother of them it clearly talks about all of the ministers that know that it's the truth christ comes down and vindicates it but they shirk their responsibility to go another way folks i'm here to tell you whether you're a father and you don't want to beat that child you don't want to whoop that child that child might be like billy paul was and and sister branham said give him a weapon he was bad he was like well can't we forgive him this time or something huh y'all remember that he was upset because he wouldn't or whatever but we got to have the responsibility of correcting and so forth i know i've come up here many times folks i didn't want to be up here i knew what needed to be said huh i knew what needed to happen man i tried every way possibly but sometimes you just gotta come out and say it because it's your responsibility amen and i know what it's like to go back there it's on my chest now i've said what i was supposed to say i preached what i was supposed to preach let the chips fall where they may huh i can rest easy but i'll be tore up all night amen until i do what i'm supposed to do amen you talk about pain huh pastor let me tell you a little bit about something i don't know but i'm sure every one of you has had friends that were good friends perhaps they turned their back on you and stabbed you in the back hurt real bad huh this that or the other and you know the pain of that you cared about a person and they just don't care back huh and being a pastor i don't care who it is if they come to the lord come to church here i'm responsible for every one of them huh you care for people you love people and people come and go all the time i don't know if this is out here but i hope everybody here that comes to this church hears this tonight i love it when i can grow old with you that's my kind of friendship that's come my kind of sheep a minute because it's rough it's it's not easy you know especially if people leave with an attitude or not the right reason hello that is even harder all right but the thing of it is jesus says come unto me oh you were weary and heavy my yoke is easy and my burden light his yoke is easy remember it's light if you if you if you would not have the right spirit it would not be easy to forgive people but what makes it easy is when you have the holy ghost to love people it doesn't matter what they do to you amen our mind is with you with me but if you don't have it's hard amen now notice here we find an example people run from they don't want that responsibility he says we're we're prone to run from it can we say this generation ran from it the preachers ran from it the church just ran from it we're prone to run from responsibility in the burden of being a christian and be in the light of the world amen but you got to face it he says sometimes he takes the very height off of you huh it's very high sometimes off of you but you got to do it anyway we've got so many things that we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face and everybody has got a certain responsibility everything is a responsibility but a man says and it's so easy when responsibilities face us the shirt from them amen a responsibility listen and we find that marriage is a responsibility in all manners amen how many knows that not very many marriages make it today's world it is pathetic it's terrible how many marriages don't make it that's right why because living together being together and and getting upset with each other getting to the place where maybe you dislike each other you know brother bam says that natural filial love will turn to hate uh people that once love each other because of hardship because of the load sometimes they even kill each other turns to hate how many knows that's why you need christ in your marriage without christ in your marriage you stand a very slim chance because people are so spoiled and everybody wants to have their way i'll tell you what it don't never work if it's just one-sided you have to give both sides have to give amen it's a great responsibility it's a it it's a big burden they taking on that they don't think about whenever you know but sometimes when they get married a preacher has to perhaps be thorough about their obligations and so forth the obligations that they're taking on amen but let me finish with this and being brought into the presence of god and see god made a promise and god is obligated to that promise and when he brings that promise to pass then people are afraid to face up the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour we find that everywhere how many believes that never before many places but it says man when we see christ and what he did it ought to set our souls on fire and keep it on fire how many please and keep it on fire don't let it dwindle down don't let that little light that you've got shining in your life don't let it dwindle down keep pruning get all that old smut and all of that black stuff out of your life and let your light shine amen but people oh and this is what hurt brother brown so much to see the people could see what it is christ to know that it's the truth and then they will come up and be responsible he says many preachers many people come to say well we believe it's the truth he says but if we believe that and teach that they'll kick us out he says well he says you're if you if you don't come in he said you'll be kicked out up there so you got to choose you got to choose which side or where you want to be kicked out of because you're going to be kicked out somewhere people are afraid to say no i believe the prophet of god i believe what god i'm not ashamed how many is more i am not ashamed of what god has done in this generation i'm not afraid to testify that it's more than just brother of adam it's jesus christ amen oh shouted from the housetops amen it's the truth a responsibility to uh to confess the truth oh my remember jesus said i come not to bring peace but a sword huh to bring a bird and the father will be against uh father-in-law daughter-in-law against so forth a lot of times it's within the family it's a burden it ain't easy [Music] how many knows he didn't come to make it easy he come to bring you into a battle for the truth and for what's right amen but he says so many people are taking their denomination denominational ships the tarshish going the easy way you know not the way like jonah jonah he wasn't the same man maybe maybe he had a life of luxury but then one god one day god called him says jonah i want you to go same as brother branham remember he heard the voice and so forth but one day god said for him to go and then because of his mother-in-law and all of that the pressure he was getting from his family he didn't go and boy it cost him didn't it and boy you talk about pain and suffering that he went through because he didn't go lost his wife lost his child he prayed for many people they were all healed but when it comes to healing his wife healing his baby no god took him home but what a comfort what a comfort it must have been for brother brennaman as hope came back remember that she says oh everything you preached about is so beautiful it's so beautiful i don't know about you but not just him but that comforts me because i know there's a land waiting for us amen when this debauchery of our land is this is all over with we're done praying and and and hurting because of the evil that's done everywhere we've got a place that we got to go that we can go that's a beautiful place oh it was so nice different times he saw his wife you know different places and sharon rose and so forth amen but back to jonah no jonah he had it maybe nice but then they'd come away on him i bet he was kind of stressful don't you reckon when he was in that boat and they were all throwing everything overboard all the extra food all the extra everything the light and the load and it still wouldn't quit still wasn't the ned they said there's somebody in here that's wicked somebody's bad and the lot fell on jonah huh imagine it was kind of a stressful time it was a burden the burden of the word of the lord to jonah to have to go down there as prophet god said he was a hebrew and those gentiles and theirs are going to say what are you doing down here he was very negative thought he never thought they'd never repent [Music] finally after the fish he was in the fish's belly it was no easy thing just like our lives a lot of times are not easy how many knows a christian walk isn't meant to be easy blessed are those that weep now for they shall laugh blessed are those that are hungry now because they shall be filled jesus even said the christian life isn't a flowery bed of ease it's not all you know peace and joy so to speak in the outside but thank god there's peace and joy on the inside right amen it's okay that the outside is not peace and joy but i want to make sure the inside is so that you can be like paul who was what to be the next k ephesus he said man i was the pharisee of the pharisees he was respected regarded looked up to when he came they all stood to the side and here comes paul this is paul coming until he was the off scouring of the earth paul said you know we're the odds kind we're like sheep to the slaughter and oh my look at the life that jesus allowed him and put him through he says you're going to suffer many things and the life that he had but he yet he is the one that encouraged us we may be cast down but we're never forsaken amen all these things so my thought is lord help us having the holy ghost living the life of christ to feel about things the way that jesus would feel about it to think about things the way that jesus would think about him amen and even though we have the peace and the joy there's still a burden for our neighbors huh we could it'd be easy just never not say nothing huh but like brother brown says you know you warn a man hey you're going to go over a cliff he's your boat is not going to be able to make it in the tribulation it's not going to go in the rapture what you believe is not going to go in the rapture you're heading for a fall they say why shut up i'm be fine i've mind your own business but ibm says you might say well now just forget him he says but no we're going to run down the bank you say listen you've got to listen to me huh that's what's billy braham's attitude that's what he's trying to tell us you know have how many bc compassion the only reason the only reason that this world is keeping on going you know why because we're still here but the long suffering of christ not willing to perish he's just keeping on give him a little more chance come give me a little more chance give him another chance amen because that's the way god feels about it he doesn't want to see the day that every man woman and child is going to be destroyed huh you know because he says you know if you don't have that mark on you it doesn't matter whether you're a child whether you're a priest i don't care if you're a preacher up here you got that mark how many knows you're going in the tribulation period the rapture is coming for those whom the holy spirit has marked amen and the holy spirit marks those as i might say tonight that feel about it the way that jesus felt about it god bless you let's stand musicians if you'll come with our head spout tonight how many would say you know i believe that i should have more of a burden for the lost in what i do i shouldn't be so careful about the things of the world but i should care more about these souls that are out there that if they don't come into christ they're going to be lost god bless those hands my hand is up lord jesus i ask god that you would help me to have a greater care even as you did with jerusalem even though they rejected you every time called you up yells you up and everything else but yet you love them even as paul after they persecuted him and rejected him he still would give their life would trade his eternal life if they could just be saved lord jesus we want to have that kind of compassion we want to have that kind of love in our hearts lord jesus tonight father we ask god that you'd help to be just what you want us to be lord to feel the way that you would feel about it to live and to think the way that you would do lord live your life out through us lord let your holy spirit continue to rule and reign in our lives lord jesus we ask it in jesus name amen and amen god bless you [Music]
