Lord thou has been favorable unto thy land thou is brought back the Captivity of Jacob thou has taken away all thy Wrath thou has turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger will thou be angry with us forever what thou draw out thine anger to all generations tell us by Mercy O Lord and Grant honor grant us thy salvation here surely his salvation is nigh to them that fear him that the glory May dwell in our land truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven and all this together 13 first righteousness shall go before him and he shall fed us in the way of his steps you can all be seated this morning and if you would turn to Romans the sixth chapter but I was going to this is I read out of this sometimes but this was the uh this is uh it's not a product it's just a devotional book for GIS during World War II but I thought this one was pretty good and it really it's no different for the these young men in 1940 1941 1942 than it is for us this morning and this is a pretty good one to come the scripture that this uh Presbyterian Minister uses is you don't I'll just read the verse it comes out of Matthew the fifth chapter and verses uh 13. Jesus says here you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost his savior wherewith shall ye be salted so basically Jesus is telling us as Christians this morning you have to have that experience you have to have Christ in your heart in life so that you're salty so people see something in you that they want uh doesn't mean that are we perfect every day of Our Lives not but you need to stay with the Lord and be salty so people see something in you that they want to want to become and this is what this man and this is what 80 years but this is what this man wrote and it's pretty funny Batman and airplanes are good men on mules it says opening statement there which is more important which is more needed for the years we've been working on airplanes and he's talking in his day and age where the airplane was a great invention of his day and age where they were using airplanes to kill thousands and hundreds of thousands of people and praying very little attention to men we made a mistake we would have been wiser to have worked with men and have neglected the planes then we would have had good men on mules instead of bad men in planes wouldn't that have been better and it speaks to our generation too you know now we have nuclear weapons not airplanes on Rockets Generations ago new englanders named can't pronounce this there warned us that we were heading to hell because we're making improved means of unimproved ends basically you were saying our technology we're not using it to better ourselves but we're using it to kill ourselves and we're making the tools for which we do whatever we wanted to do without realizing that the tools would be every bit as effective for evil as for good and you can think of the day and age we're living this morning I mean the the technology that you have at your hands this morning you know it's like good and evil it's your choice how you use that technology but nowadays it's being used more for evil than it is being used for good and the same chemistry the same Machinery the same cleverness the same equipment can help Chief either Heaven or Hell and the other day a soldier barely wounded remarked we'd be better off we'd learn less about chemistry and more about Christ and he goes on that impresses me as an as an intelligent and sound and I'm just adding to this a pretty true statement for his day and age but just think of today's day and age where people can kill each other thousands of miles away from each other better to have good men on mules and bad man in Plants think it over we used to talk about it when I was flying for the Navy in 1918 and 1919 and you got to realize what this man's thinking you know the airplanes they fought uh flew in in 1918 were just fabric covered pieces of wood with engines made of metal on them so you'd think of a hundred years what a difference it makes an important governor and he said if you wouldn't would have known now if you'd have realized how important it is to govern yourselves according and doing and after the war there needing not to be another War and it's kind of prophetic in 1960 or 1970 and he goes on to be God be with you so yeah that's pretty important it's not the technology that's bad it's the hearts of the men that use the technology that are evil and it's their their cleverness you know brother Branham said that in if it hadn't been for the flood you know God God would have the men would have destroyed themselves with without the flood you know they would have stolen just like us if if God doesn't keep his hand on his people mankind will destroy themselves in one day because they just can't help himself but uh going to the sixth chapter here of Romans I was saying that the things that were on the on the thing this morning you know it's just simply Believe In Christ like brother Brown said the ABC says the world gets crazier the world goes off into the deep end you just got to fulfill that simple promise always believe Christ no matter what happens what the world is telling you what is trying to force you to do if it can't go through God's filter it can't go through God's word then we don't need to be doing I'll just read this chapter I I had a some stuff wrote down but I'll just read what Paul you know this is Paul in Romans he's dealing with a Roman Church he's dealt with the Corinthian Church but I'll read everyone I mean you know your Baptist the nominations you know they as a child they make you learn this chapter but I'll just read what it has to say what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound and that's heresy right there you know you don't use your grace for disgrace you use your grace to be just a better man or woman and he goes God forbid how shall we that our dead sin live any longer therein so when you know to do good you need to do good he's saying here no you're not that as many of us are baptized and to Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life so every man and woman here this morning that's been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ when you came out of that water you took the name of Jesus Christ and you have to fulfill the promises that Jesus Christ has for us in the day that we live in this morning for we have been planted together in the likeness of his death which also in the likeness of his resurrection it goes back to that chapter I read I don't know if it was last week of the last second Corinthians the fifth chapter knowing this that our old man has crucified him that our body of sin might be destroyed henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin so all of us stand there this morning is the view except that Jesus Christ who's your lord and savior then you stand here this morning reconciled to the Living God this morning that's a comforting thought and if you haven't been I would just encourage you to do that for he that is dead is freed from them now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death have no more dominion over him for he that he died he died on to sin once but he be that liveth liveth unto God and that's where we're at this morning likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord and it goes back to what I was reading here this morning I hope I don't lose my place is that's what we need more of men that just simply take God I'm not saying you need to ride mules or anything but no matter what the technology is no matter what's going on in the world you're simply doing as God leads you in in this age that we're living this morning it's not in the great thing sometimes you know God might only choose us to do one thing one thing and God has one purpose for you whatever that purpose is it's our whole desire to find what God would have us to do for the age that we live in and I miss my spot but I'll try not to reread everything over again let not sin therefore reign in your model bodies that you should obey in it the lust thereof neither yields ye your members as instruments to unrighteousness on the sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members is instruments of the righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace and that's a comforting thought this morning you're free this morning and and I know you can I can't say that to myself enough you're free you don't have to be under any bondage this morning any spiritual bombs any other kind of bondage you're free in Christ this morning but then shall we sin because we are not under the law but on the grace God forbid no you're not that to whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or obedience arthritis and that's what this Presbyterian preacher was talking about here in this devotional this morning it's not that it's not that things are bad technology or the things you use every day to be successful or bad it's which side of using it you go to do you go to the evil side or do you go to the good side but God be thankful you are Servants of you are excuse me I'm not going to misread this by God be things that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed the heart that form the heart from the form of Doctrine which delivered you being then made free from sin you become the Servants of righteousness I speak after the manner of man because of the infirmity of your flesh for we are giving her yielded your members serviced Uncle to excuse me serviced uncleanness and iniquity onto iniquity even so yield your member Servants of righteousness unto Holiness you got to forgive me because I read longer for some reason my eyes want to fade out sometimes but when you were the Servants of sin you were free from righteousness what fruit have you then in those things where if you are now ashamed for the end of those things is death so your desire should not be to go back to the things you once did your desire to be should be to totally just leave those behind and you shouldn't even be looking back to them anymore does that mean that your enemy uh isn't going to try to have you point back to where you came from now of course he's there every day trying to condemn you and have him you go back to where you come from but Paul is telling us you just got to leave that stuff behind and he goes on to say uh I lost my place but what fruit have you then in those things where if you are now ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and become the servants to God you have your fruits onto Holiness in the end everlasting life so it's the better it's the better choice to make the god Choice the Christ choice is the better choice to make and then everyone should know this for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life for Jesus Christ Our Lord you know I was reading there was uh there was a a quote I was reading of brother Brown and was talking what was mentioned up here this morning it's it's pretty simple I I started saying that like brother Brown always taught us to always believe Christ I mean you can't say that enough you can't say it to your children enough you can't say it to your spouse enough always believed well no matter what the situation if God can't be glorified in it we shouldn't be doing it it's pretty simple if you use those principles you'll be successful in the day that we live in Brother David let's stand this morning amen as brother Brian was speaking and the song or the song Come on my heart thank God I'm free this morning amen are you happy to be free this morning amen well

amen God bless you good to be back thank you musicians amen it's good to be announced the Lord and to see everybody out our visitors amen God bless you amen I trust the Lord will give you something that you can take home today amen praise the lord we had a good trip up north amen the church up there of course I just really wanted to get the feel of what it was all about and so forth and it's certainly the church that's in its infancy amen people that are trusting that the Lord will do something and so amen we'll just have to it may live by faith I mean going by faith amen and there's no telling what might happen but it's certainly good in a good location and I trust God will use it amen got to sleep in the Amish Amish home a couple nights amen no power or running water and so forth and amen but Levi treated us real good and we had a good time with him and fellowship with him and so forth and amen we was praying that the Lord will just help us to be a light somewhere and I think that morning somebody from Canada called him some from some Amish community guy Community looked kind of like brother Tommy had a big beard and so forth and I guess his wife had left him and and his nine children on account of him being put in the band there in a very strict Army community and they kind of pitted them his family against him and so he was just praying and so forth and and Levi had been given people books of the Supernatural and so while we were on the phone and and then I says you know would you like for Levi they send you uh books of the supernatural you know brother Brandon and so forth and he said yeah send it to me so amen the Lord just seemed open up ways like that amen spoke to another lady a man from England but anyway and so the Lord just helped us to be a witness amen amen there certainly would like to do a whole lot more than what we have but amen we'll just wait on the Lord God bless you this morning it's good to see you amen it's good to be back amen and just amen just look at every one of y'all's faces and amen to have a church like we do and have a god like we do and to have a prophet like we did amen a message like we do Amen to know that amen We Don't Preach what uh I think as I think uh my my first second no my first double first cousin amen that I've been witnessing to he says well I sure talk to a lot of people amen and they have a lot of different versions and different thoughts on the Bible and so forth and I had done Ransom before I said you know you know and that's why we needed a prophet you know because when I have a version everybody has a version but hey man we need to have that Prophet amen that Jesus Christ I mean and I and I told him before he says Jesus Christ he would say now if I've told the truth if Jesus Christ don't come now and do what he did when he was here on the earth you don't have to believe it is that right and Jesus Christ would come he discern the thoughts and Tents of the heart and Jesus and that woman at the world said now we know when the Messiah comes he'll tell us these things she even that Harlot knew that the Messiah was going to do and and Jesus come and did that thousands upon thousands of times and people still don't recognize that it wasn't just a man boy and Brandon but it was Jesus it was the Messiah isn't that right coming and showing us the way a man and knowing that everything that Prophet said always lined up with the word because if an angel came from heaven and tells us you something different than that word let him be a curse amen but anyway I thought well I then told you once but anyway that you know we don't you're gonna have a lot of different opinions but whose opinion are you gonna take or interpretation isn't that right and the Bible says the Lord surely will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets to his servants the prophets amen and if God could you Jesus Christ could come and use brother branham's a vision and so forth and tell people what the name was what's wrong with him were they from and so forth and even going back to show you what the Eve's color of her eyes and the air was hello if he could show you that he can truly tell you the truth of the word isn't that right and so we believe it we believe it because it lines up with the word it may be not be according to your thought or mine but it lines up with the word and so amen I just pray that someday he'll open up his eyes amen and and help him to see because we know that he does take the revelation of the spirit to really Quicken amen what it's all about God bless you let's just bow our heads in prayer Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and we're thankful Lord Jesus to have you to have your Eternal Word and father What You Did In Our Generation Lord Jesus when there's thousands upon thousands of churches and all these different ideas and things that you came down and you showed yourself alive resurrected just like you did Amen to the disciples and so forth after you come back and you showed yourself alive again Lord you've done that to our generation Lord Jesus and I know God that it'll meet this generation in the Judgment for you did not just do it for a show but you did it to prove to the world that you are alive and well and that there is a way there's a truth and a life and that way and true in life is you Lord we ask God that you'll bless the service this morning Father we ask Lord Jesus be with me help me Lord just convey to the people that which I feel you've laid upon my heart to speak in Jesus name amen open your Bibles this morning amen I want to go to who we're going to read scriptures and then I want to touch on something else before I get into my message and that will probably take just a little bit of time so um let me see here how about Hebrews 6 I believe it is the book of Hebrews amen Hebrews 6 1-3 there fore leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and the faith Towers god of the doctrine of baptism and of the laying hand of hands and the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment this will we do if God permit amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated this morning amen I want to talk about I want to call this progression progression amen I like that going on to Perfection praise the Lord now I wanna I wanna I want uh I want to cover something with the church here this morning before I get into the main part of the service a man I know uh you know that I know that I just is with the help of the Lord amen so if you will turn to your Bibles of Genesis I'm going to talk to you a little bit about amen what happened in the Garden of Eden would that be okay amen let's talk about what happened in the Garden of Eden for just a minute amen we want to have a clear understanding Amy and I I didn't even realize that that had the wording like it did but I mean we want to go to Genesis 2. Genesis 2. and verse 16. it says and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest free freely eat but if the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt die now how many knows this tree I don't know about you but how many knows that I don't know about Apple Tree because we know that the world believes that what happened in the garden is that uh an apple was picked off the tree isn't that right or an apricot or something like that last time I checked a tree doesn't have the knowledge of Good and Evil it doesn't know good in evil but this tree knew good and evil in the garden is that right now we know that after he said that you know God made a helpmate for him and so forth uh you know a second time and so forth but if you go to chapter three now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said notice how he repeated what God Said all right and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the true but it's a fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden now notice this tree that's in the midst of the garden it's the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil all right there's a tree there but at the fruit of the tree all right Thou shalt not eat of it neither shall ye touch it least ye die and the serpent said unto the Woman Thou shalt not surely die have you ever heard the phrase you know of getting fed a lie fit a line that's what the devil was doing to Eve he was feeding her something isn't that right he was feeding or something he was feeding her a lie all right and the serpent said unto the woman shall not surely die for God and does know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods now get these next words knowing Good and Evil let me ask you how many more trees were in the garden that knew the difference there's only two trees that I know of in the garden that knew good and evil one of them was God God knows Good and Evil and the other one was this serpent isn't that right this serpent knew good and evil there's your tree and she ate of that she ate his because that's what we're doing here we're feasting on the word right and so she ate that she ate of the tree and what did it bring death amen all right that's right now notice so he says that's right that you'll be as Gods knowing good and evil now let me read what the brother Benham says about it and serpent see this is out of the church church age book not to get the real meaning of what we are about to go into one must caution you and keep ever in mind that religion spiritual matters if you like are composed of two parts that inner wine and are as opposite as black and white religion and spirit and the spiritual world are made of those two trees which are in have their roots in Eden both the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the midst of the garden amen and no doubt had their very branches intertwined with each other now if you look at that natural it's going to look and sound like a natural tree their branches are intertwined but I'll show you that that's not at all but it is amen thus now notice brother Brown because Us in the Ephesian church is that same Paradox the church is made up of good and bad the two Vines huh the two Vines make the church they are the wheat and the terrorists growing up side by side the one is true and the other one is false now notice the shall arise false Christ false prophets is also a great signs so intimate that if it were possible they'll deceive the very elected so it's going to be intertwined branches so way back there in the early church very short time after Pentecost the false Vine got to intertwine itself amen around the True Vine and we find these Deeds of the Nickelodeon's and that spirit is going to be found finding the true lion until it is destroyed by God why have you got it now in the Garden of Eden there were two trees standing in the midst of it Juana was a tree of life and the other was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil man must live by the Tree of Life what was that tree of life Thou shalt not eat of it and neither shall not touch it at least she died that was the Tree of Life amen I shall not surely die that was the tree of death standing side by side intertwined just as you would going into your neighborhood robbing shoulders or intermingling with whatever amen two people perhaps every Believers non-believers all going to the same church intertwining intermingling talking to each other they're having fellowship with one another ain't no telling how I'm long and how many times Eve's path crossed with the serpent and how many times he talked to her before he finally convinced her you know that it was a good it was good if you open up your eyes in other words if you'll believe what I tell you because the second that she opened up what did the prophet say the ma the womb of her mind and took that in she committed spiritual fornication and the next time it was a natural fornication that she did with but first it was a spiritual fornication or an adultery so to speak amen and she opened up the womb in her mind and she ate the fruit she believed what he said and it brought death just ask be that believeth on me shall never die isn't that right all right let me go on now notice all right man was to live by the tree of life but he was not to touch the other tree or he would die but man did partake of the other tree didn't leave exactly and when he did death entered in by him through sin and he became separated from God now that tree back there in the Garden of Eden that tree was the source of Life the tree of that tree which now notice now that tree back there in the garden that tree which was the source of life was Jesus in John chapter 6 through 8 Jesus sets himself forth as the source of of eternal life I just I thought about that scripture and then and I was just studying something else and I came right across it so let me just read it to you Jesus says Jesus said in Saint John 6 he says verily merrily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life how many isn't it something other because of what she believed it brought that because of what you believe from the Tree of Life it brings life amen I am the bread of life your fathers that eat man in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread I mean it was Jesus himself nothing else only the person of Jesus Christ he said it's the source of art he is the Tree of Life amen If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever how many is eating from the Tree of Life this morning that's what we come to church for is to pick a little bit more fruit eat a little bit more of the Tree of Life amen and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give forth the life of the world now notice he says that's right he says he here calls himself the bread of life he spoke of giving himself and so forth that if a man Aid he would never die he proclaimed that he knew Abraham before Abraham I was is that right he prophesied that he would give himself as the Living Waters and if a man drink he would never thirst again but live eternal The Great I Am he is the bread of life The Well of Life The Eternal one the tree of life he was back there in Eden in the midst of the garden even as he will be in the midst of the paradise of God amen some have the idea that the true treats in the garden are just two more tree like the rest this is not so for time the Baptist cried that the actors laid to the root of all the trees which we're not talking about natural trees but of Christian principles now this is the record that God has given us of eternal life in this life is in his son amen Saint John 5 4 4 he says and he will not come to me that you might have to life that's the record God's record States plainly and clearly that life eternal life is in the Sun and no other place first John 5 12 he didn't have the son Half-Life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life amen praise the Lord so since the record cannot change or be taken or added there too then the records stand that his life that is the life is in the sons and this is so the tree in the garden has to be Jesus all right if the tree of life is a person then the tree of the knowledge of good of evil is a person also it's a person not a tree amen I'm really glad to have that Revelation I may notice that three major doctrines that somebody wanted brother Branham to compromise with the serpency the godhead and water baptism amen that's his major Doctrine and anything contrary to the truth of the word and Revelation is false Doctrine it's false it's wrong if it's your idea if it's mine it's wrong amen how many those you don't want to hear my idea I don't want to hear your idea I don't care about your idea what you believe or what Revelation you have I want what God's word says amen because man I'll tell you even as a young Christian I mean I was speaking to Levi a lot of times young Christians still get Revelations oh I got a revelation I got a revelation find out you will find out that a lot of those Revelations are wrong I did I did the same thing the other thing that I thought that I believed that I thought was right it was absolutely wrong oh I don't know if brother bam said he takes a revelation to for the serpency tonight I know he did say that it takes a revelation for the godhead but I'm thinking he may have said that it wasn't for the serpent seed even if you didn't understand the serpent seed all you got to do is believe the prophet because we're taught that if you don't understand it just believe what he said amen praise the Lord because I don't want people out there thinking that we believe that it's still a tree and an apple it's not it's absolutely a person amen that was that good tree of Good and Evil very obvious how many of these quite obvious if you just listen to what it's really saying because the Bible is spoken in such a way that it's hit from the eyes of the wise of prudent as a matter of fact this mystery wasn't even revealed hardly until this hour everybody thought and it was an apple but that's on a Perdition amen he was exposed in our generation in our day I mean ozen showed where he comes from and what the terminology the terminology of the tree is good for food and it's to make one wise in other words you'll be smart you'll know good and evil that was the good good food that it was supposed to be and that's what she wanted amen all right let me finish this episode we'll get our message now notice all right all right so if the tree of life is a person then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was a person we know that it was a serpent is that right he's the only other one guy in there that knew Good and Evil he's the one that gave Eve the fruit and in other words he says this you're going to be smart you're going to be wise you're going to know and good and evil all you got to do is take it all you got to do is open up your mind and receive believe what I tell you and apparently she did she was fooled she was deceived all right now notice so he says it can't be otherwise the evil person is a person also it can't be otherwise that's the righteous one and the wicked one stood side by side in the midst of the Garden of Eden it's quite something in it you thought well you know wow God made a Garden of Eden then right in the middle of it he had a he had a person all right called the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil that if the eight of it they would die now how many knows that we understand why God did that why would God do such a thing amen it was God's plan God knew what Eve would do even in heaven Satan had a choice of whether he wanted to stay with God or go over and get a third of the angels on his side and that right here but he had the power of choice and God put that power of choice in Eden and he knew that it would fall that we would come into this condition isn't that right and that he would bring the second Adam that he would bring that second tree and he would give us the Tree of Life mother bam says that tree that tree is in front of everybody today everybody you have to choose whether you're going to believe what Jesus said are you going to take of the mixed tree that's why he says churches are good but they're all so bad it's a mixed tree people want to do what they want think what they want but they still want to call themselves Christians amen and that's the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil amen praise the Lord now here we go he says they're side by side in the midst of the garden Ezekiel 8 13 says Thou Satan has been in Eden The Garden of God now we know that Satan is a spirit and according to the Prophet The Devil's Spirit entered into the serpent and this evening amen here is where we receive the true revelation of the serpent seed here is what really happened in the Garden of Eden and the people said and the people said amen that's what really happened and that's why Saint John 3 12 I believe Jesus not as Cain who was of that Wicked one Cain was of the wicked one that certainly wasn't Adam no it was from that serpent that's where serpent seat came in Amen in most denominational churches won't accept that most people won't accept that but it's the truth nonetheless amen all right let me go can we get into my message now amen I just wanna to clear that up and I want every man woman boy and girl in here to understand the serpent seat I want you to understand what happened in the Garden of Eden and if you don't you pray God give me the Revelation amen all right now back to our thought over here in First Corinthians because I was thinking you know if there's one thing that we have a desire one thing my desire as a pastor as a preacher and that is amen as I Minister as we preach and man we want to say something we want to do something that will benefit and that will edify you amen I want to know where you are at this morning we want to know where we're at it's important that you know where you're at with your growth in God amen because we want to take you a little further with the help of God how many believes that God wants us to go further than what we are oh my praise be to God and I believe that's why he said in in Corinthians there uh you know he says chapter 6 hold on known I'm sorry I keep thinking it's in Corinthians it's not Corinthians it's in Hebrews where he talks about leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ let us go on action Hallelujah not laying again the foundation of repentance so it talks about going on to perfection praise the Lord amen how many has a thirst in the longing for Perfection Jesus at one place be ye therefore perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect and I got to thinking about and praying about what am I going to preach without thinking you know there's one thing that I believe that no matter how long we've been Christians and you don't have to look out very far whether you look at me or I look at you you find that there's still too much of our self in there the Shelf things that need to be pruned off of us we're still not seeing every fault that you find around the message or there's every fault that you see amen it is still an imperfection and you and I are scratch you're thirsty and hungering for perfection come into what I mean by that is coming into the full stature of Christ amen have less of ourselves and more of him we want to see God in a greater way in our lives we don't want to be in the same place that we were yesterday because the movie's on brother the move is on how many of these whenever that Pillar of Fire over the Old Testament moves they had better break camp they better break cap and follow that lighter they're gonna be left in the Darkness and that's the way it is in our day folks when I got into thinking of how that uh you know I was up there amongst the Amish the very heart the very Heart of Darkness the very heart of tradition of man that has veiled to people and keeping them from the word having an effect huh see I come from the Amish of the Amish to how strictest of the Amish amen and my my double first cousin he broke away about a year or two ago perhaps in over a year so he kept wearing the Amish clothes kept wearing the army clothes still at everything but now I go back up and he's got English clothes on he's got these clothes guys dick decent haircut David I said you look good I like the way you dress I said you finally broke free from the Amish tradition why because you know others are believing the message but they're still no like drinking no they're not just the strong Amish as you can be and why is such an indoctrination until it takes time sometimes to break away from it to get away from it I don't know if anybody's out there listening to me but people aim it I don't understand why people amen that put that all down why would you want to go back and dress Amish again you know some people say well it's holy or clean let me tell you something goes close to Jesus said you enlarge the borders of the garments and so forth Amen to make yourself fall it don't do anything for you and Jesus even condemned it it ain't about that to me it would represent slavery that well I had to wear those clothes I better do what they do and say and so forth or it was it's a representation of change folks when I can put a shirt on I can put a tie on I can say I ain't gotta I ain't gotta be like that anymore I won't be put in the band putting a spine we went into a restaurant down there you know come to find out this Levi order uh just Levi Yoder and his wife I didn't know him from Adam but they come and visit him and she said you know your mom and my dad or somebody else like that were first cousins we're related after in Lima we went to Lima Church can I take my time we went to the church in Lima with uh Levi and his wife and so forth and and I had known that that church was there for a while and I expected a bunch of old folks I expected the preacher come up here and just kind of call him and give perhaps a mess and on the message or this side of the other and just kind of you know kind of dead it's kind of what I was expecting we started at 6 30 the church started at 6 30 and we finally got out at 9 20. we almost had a three-hour service on a Wednesday night preacher jumped so hi-hat the donkeys had nothing to hit the ceiling just like that I shouldn't go I couldn't have jumped that high if I tried the people were about 15 people wasn't very many it's a man Jesse Smith is his name brother Jesse amen he has a wife and about eight children and and there's a few others there about 15 people and when they worshiped it was just oh my it was the top of worship when he had me to come up and say a few words I said you know y'all may be a small group but you got big worship when he got up there he said brother Bob he says to let everybody tells us that but we just love the Lord and I could tell by the man and by the way that he was preaching and so forth amen he was happy he was free you could just tell there was an innocence that man was real and he obeyed God and he was no he was just on fire and of course he had the the video up there and the screens and he was teaching on music and worship and he was going to go down I think the next Day 2017 people that got baptized down himself uh Ohio I thought he was going to go be ministering down to them and he was going to bring him how that how did you know God wants you to worship him on the loud symbols and all this that or the other and he went through every different types of music and all of that and downs forward not only preaching but under inspiration and it was good I was like my Lord I'm sure glad he didn't ask me to preach this is a whole lot better than I could ever done it really did good it was good didn't seem no three hours hey man but anyway I kind of lost my thought and tell on the other story but I wanted had wanted to go to that church up in there and it was guess what it was only 44 miles away well not all that far amen so it was it was good and I told I told him I said boy if you had a vehicle this is where you ought to come where you get fed good where there's worship there's established church somebody that knows the message and understand it's been in a long time not a not a novice praise the Lord but I got to thinking you know I got to thinking when I when I saw that and I see people different ones coming out and then you've got the arms you got the Mennonite you got the uh higher Amish I thought the higher Amisha because every time you come out you can teach more of the word of God how many knows that you can actually believe more every time you come out I didn't know it but they don't even really encourage you to read this book amongst Amish too much do you know that isn't that exactly what the pope Did in the Dark Ages he didn't want them to have the books and so forth Just go with what your priest said isn't that sad but the higher you go the more Liberty they have and I thought my you know I drive a mule I drop bought that Yamaha mule that little side by side and when I hit 45 miles an hour brother Tommy amen that engine stalls out on me and I said I've got to have a restrictor there's got to be a restrictor up in here somewhere right and I thought that's about how it is in religions there in these cages and they're restricted and they can't go further they can't get higher they can't climb higher they can't grow anymore think about you and me think about we can climb how we can go higher you can go further than what you was yesterday you could climb higher than what you have been that's what I want to do forever you are climb a little higher go a little deeper in God and then until we get pulling out of it in this world till the body change comes amen praise the Lord Hallelujah you love him God is good isn't he now notice better man talks about when we come together what do we come together for he says we come together to find our bad places don't we to find out where we can change where we can be pruned a little and I was I want more of Jesus more and more and more if you want more of Jesus then you're gonna have to give him a little more of you prune this off prune that off like Jesus says you know every tree that brings forth fruit he prunes and it might bring forth much fruit God loves to have progress in his church God wants progress in you he wants progressing me to progress how much people die like butter Ivan I've watched Joey Hendrickson Joe Hendrickson and different ones that to me they were ready to die they were ready to go they didn't want to really Ivan didn't really want to go he wanted to have that family he had a wife he had grandchildren that he wanted you know what then he says I'm just one I'm gonna go over to be with Jesus and he died like a man he died ready well I could tell he was ready if I could go like that just knowing that you're ready I mean I believe that you and I can get to the place you don't have to wait to the Rapture to come to Perfection to come to majority or to come to the place that you amen where you should be the prophet made the statement he says you're not ready to live until you're ready to die so you're ready to go guess what now you're really ready to serve God why because you've whipped yourself out thank you amen aren't you glad Luther it's all a progression Luther he only was defeat he was just uh you know the countdown he says you know Luther was the horse and buggy age listen about the H Wesley come along and it was the car age sanctification a little bit higher than Luther was and along he says comes in he called him a a uh cross-eyed I believe a cross-eyed black man amen in Azusa Street amen and guess what they had them it was the age of the Wright brothers it was the age of the airplane he says the natural types of there's a God reason he says he types of spiritual and they took to the skies they've been took to the heavenlas and so forth and he began to speak in a Heavenly language unknown tongues and so forth but even that even they had a restrictor this says you know if you don't speak in tongues we don't believe you got it and you got to speak in tongues if you got the Holy Ghost you know at the end of brother bannon's Ministry that the Pentecostals even put him out because she didn't believe that the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues with the evidence of the Holy Ghost because he had watch Witch Doctor speaking on long tongues right make an ink pen raid right in the unknown tongue bring tables up off the chairs and everything and drink blood out of the human skull a bunch of witches yes that they know just because you speak an unknown time that don't mean you got it how many people you and I sorry Hallelujah aren't you glad to be in a higher age in a different age praise the Lord all right let me read you a couple quotes is that okay now remember they couldn't stay still that when the pillar of fire moved out they come out like Isuzu Street here in California that represented the other airplane days and so forth God showed by the airplanes that his church was Rising he shows by the Natural Things what's happening in the spiritual they always follow brother now friends may I say this that it has come to the age of astronauts we've moved out of the airplane age we've gotten more power the astronaut HH has come we've come into a spiritual astronaut going above it's a same Holy Spirit only more power isn't that what we all desire God give me more of the Holy Ghost give me more of the spirit help me to climb higher don't let me be where I was yesterday or last we don't let me go backwards oh my I had a quote here we're either going backwards are we going forwards hey man aren't you glad that you can go forward climb higher all the way up into the astronaut h glory to God Hallelujah more the spirit lifting higher going higher believing more to be more like Christ not God of mobile not the horse and buggy not even the airplane but I screw Ed way out there in the heavenlies folks I'm telling you what we got to get to where the storms don't bother us anymore the trials don't bother us anymore we're not affected by all of those things why because we're in Heavenly places soar through them how many believes it legal age in the Bible we realize that over in the Bible alakai 4 We're promised in the last days God Prof Ile the chief dreams Alpha blind he's gone in the last day to be able to get a bride that was a ministry that's so exactly amen like a wife his wife husband and wife become one how many believe that how many believe that before we leave here according to the prophet he says you know those are gonna that his children are going to be trained to be in this very image in order to be United with him I'm telling you a Rapture is going to happen one of these days people is going to be translated from this Dimension to the other if you have that seed on the inside of you you believe that you're going to be one of those that's translated because there's I hate to have to say this but I truly feel under the inspiration to say it that there's going to be way more people than what we think that's going to be disappointed I even asked myself would you be disappointed huh do you ever ask yourself will I be disappointed will I be left amen you know what I do I buy God's grace and by the faith of almighty God when I realize God you started a work in me you have kept me safe that's fine I am trusting completely and you I'm Yours Lord amen and I want to be in His image I don't want to stay in the safe place that I was 40 years ago 20 years ago I'm the move on amen go higher than what we have deeper than what we have amen praise the Lord brother Brandon preached a message called Turning northward he says now we've been on this mountain of organization 40 years let's move upwards let's move on out of here ministers my ministering brother out there don't you think that we've been on this mountain long enough and that was about 40 years Prophet was preaching don't you think we fussed and fought and carried on and stood over our organizational boundaries long enough let's get off this mountain and move on to the promised land let's start going up and possess the land God told him go and possess the land he says all the old Fighters are going now put your sword back in the Seas don't fight listen man don't you make the same mistake your fathers did are you be here 40 more years see whether Christian men's organization and so forth if you haven't organized it you'll stick right here another 40 years but it's time that God is calling his church to move up amen come up praise the Lord that's whenever you've got to eat that eagle food when you was born again he's asking you hurt from your theophany and that theophany is what I hear is calling me how many believe you got to see off me brother bam says get this in your mind now I'm going to close and that's him not me we're up you always wanted to be imperfections you Christians there is a Perfection and that Perfection is not in this life but every man and woman there that is a Christian every person that's in this here building that's a Christian is now already glorified in the presence of God remember Roman says whom he has Justified and he has Sanctified we've Sanctified he's also glorified now let me explain what that means and you've got another body you won't have some other time you have right now right now there's another body waiting for you if this one should perish how many know that if this Earthly Tabernacle if this house Paul said is dissolved we have one already waiting we have one already made I may know there's another Thomas farmer out there somewhere and because that I crave Perfection here shows there's a party waiting for me out there if you're always evil and thinking evil then there is nobody there's nothing but hell waiting for you depends on what you are what are you amen what are you on the inside praise the Lord oh we thirst for it don't we praise the Lord yes we do we thirst more and more and more let's look at that couple scriptures that talk about progress and elevation would that be okay foreign Ephesians 4. well-known scripture for us verse 11 and he gave some Apostles some prophets and some of it Angela some pastors and teachers for the imperfecting of the Saints no for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man I can ask a person in here that spinned a Christian the longest now I would say what is your desire what is what do you long for I'm sure they would say that I would be more perfectly in Christ are you with me how many would say I want to be more perfectly in Christ I want to see less of myself I want others to see less of myself amen we want to see more of him we want to come to we want to come to unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen that we henceforth be no more children amen how many wants to know what a child is what is a child um First Corinthians 3 1 3 1 says and I'd rather could not speak unto you as spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ huh even as unto babes in Christ I don't know about you but it's time to not be the baby anymore time to be a full son and daughter of God amen I believe this church here are you I'm I'll be careful about what I say but I believe that most of us are in a in a college degree we're up in the college so to speak ready to graduate we're ready to get our final degree maybe another year left or so I mean it will be where we want where we need to be amen because I know what some of us weren't through I know the trials I know the character that some of us has but in every Church there's always people in every different grade we're not all in the same place no it's kind of like a house that's being built we're in the final stages brother Tommy we're putting down the baseboard we're trimming out the windows we're laying the carpet well no we can say the carpet's already late because you don't want to lay the uh the baseboard before the carpet sound if you can help it it'll make it easier for Tommy that's for sure amen so put the carpet down now as soon as that trim goes on we're ready to have the seats we're ready to have it God is almost finished with this Pride she's coming into his airberry image God is working on how many knows God is working on you day by day sermon by sermon God is working on you getting out all the roots of bitterness filling us with his fear giving us perfect fade giving us perfect love amen I believe it don't you God is getting people ready we're way oh my we're not bound by tradition we're not bound by those barriers anymore but I thought about this before I go on we do have a restrictor we have a restrictor faith has a restrictor oh that don't sound right does it all things are possible them to believe what are you talking about brother bam said if you could have faith you could create a world and go live on it but another place he says but you can't have faith for that because it's not according to the word of God so yeah we have restrictions so according to according to prophet of God or I'd be making me a world and living on it if there was no restrictions on us because if you ask contracts in the word of God remember that's just your hope or wish but if you stand you are in faith it'll be according to the word of God amen this how we know that he hears us James said I believe it was if we ask according to his will amen because God's Gonna Give You Faith to believe something that's a contrary to his well he won't give it to you that'll be your own mind that goes on in there so in that way we would have a restrictor for you everybody understand you love the Lord this morning God is good isn't he I'm glad Lord do some more trim work check me down have me ready that's hard to say I don't like to say that because if you tell God to put trim work on you and trim you down he's just liable to do it and it's not always Pleasant Amen brother Joe that's what he's not always pleasant but I don't care how much it hurts I don't care what God has to do you just have me ready that's right I just wanna I just want to be ready Holy Spirit God Almighty get us ready bring every thought every idea of my mind captive to the word of God God this morning Hallelujah oh my God I like that do not this is the astronaut age oh my let's talk about that for a few more minutes would that be okay foreign page maybe huh I don't want to I'm not gonna pass it up now he's able to achieve for himself a bride he's going to uh in the last days be able to get a bride that with a ministry that's just exactly like his like him man and his wife becomes one now remember that thought as I go over here Ministry what does it do the astronauts see things that the planes and everything else is out of date they don't see I mean it was the Pentecostal splitterbahn he would have to be careful about using the word predestination and foreknowledge they didn't really like the word predestination they just couldn't see that they didn't they just couldn't hardly grasp that they couldn't see it hardly even the prophet would have to say I've got to be careful in in saying that but it's the word of God it's all in the Bible oh my now notice it was beyond the clouds Beyond Creeks Beyond doubt out into outer space out of all unbelief outer space where they don't hear the chatter saying well you can't do it nobody will cooperate you can't do this you can't do that it doesn't even notice it he's an astronaut he's beyond the clouds it's too stormy we can't make it isn't exactly what those unbelievers said amen I forget the name of it but there was a little boy playing something uh playing something doing something he wasn't supposed to do or a boy and he got put in jail for it and his friend come in there and and he says hey did dad put you in jail for that the boy says really well I am the brother Baptist that's the way with miracles signs and wonders people say there ain't no days of Miracles already happened sorry too late to tell me it can't be done too late I mean I don't do it I mean these God does do it oh I may believe this time to climb into the all things are possible whatsoever things you ask in my name I will do it but the Bible says he says yes you know when you're planted in Christ amen it's like a tree that's all you gotta do is water and he makes a statement he says just more you water it amen you can go into deeper death you can go into higher Heights and keep going and going and going and going and going to climb higher in Christ this morning than what you are how many places coming with you can be closer to God than what you was this last week problem is sometimes we just stay at a certain plateau we're happy be with our plateau where we're at Liberty don't you be don't you be keep building the fire in the same place the next night you build a fire let it be on down the road amen because the pile of Pillar of Fire is moving on the holy spirit is moving I mean we got to follow that Spiller of Fire you believe him Hallelujah oh yeah foreign that's right we don't hear the chatter chatter this that and the other amen praise the Lord he says it's called The Eagle age in the Bible he says and we find it over in Malachi 4. I mean it knows Malachi 4 start at the Eagle age called The Eagle age over in Revelations to fourth chapter he says to one was the face of a lion the face of a man face of an ox and the last one was a king eagle do you feel do you feel that flying eagle spirit in your height you don't have to be down by worries and care ERS and thoughts that you shouldn't have and everything you ain't got to be

interpret they could prophesy and things would happen it would happen in that right it would happen but we know that at the end what they did but here comes somebody along that didn't just have prophecy in tongues and so forth but he could look right into another dimension he could look right into the mind of God and he could tell people that when they were younger a dog chased them and that's why they're so scared and why they're nervous huh he could tell them where they're from what their name is and so forth and he could look into it Plum over into another dimension it was so much higher amen and he talked about he says the Holy Ghost made the way for the Holy Ghost himself if there's one thing that the prophet of God taught us he says it's the life that you live by their
