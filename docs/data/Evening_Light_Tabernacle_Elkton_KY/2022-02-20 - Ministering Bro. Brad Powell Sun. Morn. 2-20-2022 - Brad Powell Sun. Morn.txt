========================================

you you you you so uh foreign oh so foreign foreign foreign um [Music] foreign uh [Music] thank you foreign foreign is is uh three by the lord the right [Music] well forever [Music] [Music] or spreading himself like a green day tree the salvation of the righteousness um you know why a lot of times we let our human emotions take over way the true prices are going there's no guarantee with the propane b come back september they'll probably have to come just this winter and cause the fans that will not shut the world for the church i was thinking this morning in my office and um [Music] on the bottom you know there's four chapters from the bible or a hashtag that he had you read and then we had a one of the one of the chapters was back in genesis where jacob is putting the blessing upon joseph's children and then the blessings he's gonna put on the child for israel and then the other one was in christ the 13th chapter but as i was reading through i uh i jumped up to the uh to the 17th chapter uh and uh i was reading the 16th chapter by the night you know basically when the chips are down and everything is against you that's when you really find out who you are now the difference between a man and humble and righteous that he'll see himself with who he really is vain and but when everything's going against you that's when you really find out who you are and what you're actually made of and the first you can make a difference whether you're a person where you really find out who you are and what your source of strength is and what you're going to run to to be safe on that day and uh and i was thinking of this chapter here in the 16th chapter of the second chronicles now became israel and he had great victory in the chapter of prior over the ethiopians and his father had a great victory over the northern tribes you know he seen his father recovery god gave him a victory over the ethiopian [Music] against is grandma to intent that he might let none go out or come in the age of kingdom two so the king of liberal again is exercising trying to subdue jesus and goes on to say and atha brought out the silver belt out of the church of the house of the lord and got the king sauce and said ahead of the kingdom of syria that's why by yourself israel this man just came here he went to the lord but when the king of israel was about to come out and he forgot all that and he suspected himself he ran to someone else's protection instead of god sometimes we can be the same way but we always pray before we make when things are really bad in your life whether it's violence whatever before you make a decision that might affect you and your family from years to come and now he goes on and goes on here it says there's a link between me and me and that was between my father that i was like silver so far he left off brother brown on by his fourth season and age of the king took all of jesus card away the stones around him and attempted their own word of the building he built there with even and at that time random the seer came as the kingdom of judah and set up and this is where it gave correction here um because i was relying on the king of syria i'm not relying on the kingdom of the lord thy god therefore is the host the kingdom of syria escaped out of thine hands we're not the ethiopians and the libyans of you with very many insurance and horsemen yes because rely on the lord he delivered them into thine hands for the eyes of the lord on to approach throughout the world he showed himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is perfect here it goes [Music] he made a big mistake but we have good examples too if you just turn to mark three that was one of the chapters in that devotional this morning and you know sometimes we forget that jesus was a man you know he was i'm not saying he was like me or like you but he still was a man he had the same emotions that we had he had you know the same feelings that we had and uh if you turn her on the third i'm chapter to start about uh about the 20th verse in here he he said he said dracula 12 and then as we get to the end of the chapter he he's talking to these people here and i'll start without the point at first and the multiple come together again so they just not so as much deep breath when his friends heard of it they went out the way and hold of him but they said he didn't tired so his very friends his very family didn't believe him and he goes on to say good and the scribes first came down from jerusalem and said he had a book and by the prince of devil's he out of heaven and he called on for them on the end and he said after them in parables i wasn't safe and passed out of satan there was a kingdom be divided against yourself that kingdom cannot stand and if i have you know that's you know if you think of it in your own family and you're all alive in your own city your own country when people don't live in unity and feed together there's no way they can stand and those are you know it applies to everything with you you're either at heat with people or you're at war and when you're at war with people when you can't get along with people then that's when you start having problems [Music] [Music] very last thing through all things shall we be given up friends of men and bless the words to wherever they shall bless him but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost have never forgiven us but he's eternal domination and then i was going to jump over here i don't want to say that a lot i'm going to say that's what i always said but i was going to jump over here to the you know wherever we are whatever we become it's all based on our relationship you know you have to totally convince himself and i was going to read intimidation before uh where paul tossed timothy and said you know i have probably tried to faith and i have finished my course and that's the way it should be for us you know on our on whatever graduation day it is whether it's the bachelor will be going to greater that's what we want to be able to say just like paul said that we thought and and as i see the world i'm going to talk about it anymore you can't make love with it anymore you you know you can come every day or every week and you just get worse and the only thing that you'll have is your very foundation of who you are as a christian and as a man or a woman that's your foundation who you are in christ so the world might get worse things might get it doesn't make a difference if you're in pride you know you can't worry about it you have to listen to things but the only thing i would say is i want to be able to have that testimony on that day that you know just my fault that i finished the cost and i just i can think for today that we're in we all have to be faithful in where god hey man you love him with all your heart this morning amen let's stand if we could this morning and sing that little course i will say but i'm glad this

hey man i am and his brother brian talked about the condition of the world and i just always try to remember what brother brenham said one more sign and a friend of mine had put on there what all ukraine meant and how they were and all different kind of things and one of the things i mentioned was they mentioned was oil and i always remember brother branham said you watch russia when they go after that oil and i thought lord help us to be ready to go when the time comes and lord help our children that don't know you lord help them to understand that one of these days it's all going to be over and i tell my son sometimes and i know he gets tired of hearing me but i say it's not going to get any better i said because it's time to go home this is not our home they say where i belong this morning and amen and i i think about that song that brother sean sang the other morning and that just really blessed my heart but lord there's a longing in our hearts this morning to go home we've got a lot of loved ones that's passed on and you know the world has no hope when they see someone they love die but i'm so glad we have a hope this morning you know and we've been praying for brother mark white and he passed away a couple days ago and remember the family in prayer and that god would just comfort him and he'd been doing really good and then he just had two real bad days and he left this world so just remember the family in prayer that ought to just be with them this morning and and also brother glenn like i said they're gone and remember brother thomas this morning and also uh sister

lord this morning how many is victorious this morning well if you're not i hope you will be by the end of service we'll ask you again then that'll be all for the music um i want to look at a couple of thoughts this morning and if you want to be turning in your bible we'll look at a quick little verse there in zechariah zechariah 4 and 6 and it really has nothing to do with the direction i'm going with my with my stories today and my thoughts but it it's what i think should be the believer's motto i guess we would say you know i don't know if you've noticed but over the past uh i guess month and a half about a month and a half ago we we had some pretty hard preaching going on in church and uh it uh it got a little bit rough and some of us went home with bruised egos and hurt toes and and scorched hind ends and call it what you want i told joelis one day and i told brother byler i told her this i said uh i told josh i said we're he's either gonna preach us to where we need to be or we're gonna preach us away from church because he was getting hard and and but you know what you know you ask why do preachers preach so hard why why do you hound us why do you why do you do that why do you get in our in our business because we love you if if if you're not being chastised by god listen to me you need to question your experience because you know that you know as well as i do that we have to have that guideline put down before that we can be able to to know what righteousness is you look at the life of david and i was looking in pilgrim's progress there and and john but bunyan that wrote that book he said a man does not know the nature of his law cannot nature of the law cannot know the nature of sin and when you look at david the life of david do you know that david broke every one of the ten commandments with one act david broke every one of the ten commandments he sinned with bathsheba he broke everyone he coveted his neighbor's wife he lived a lie he stole her he committed adultery he murdered her husband he dishonored his parents thus he broke the remaining four commandments and referenced a relationship with god yeah and we wonder why we have to have law why we have to have preachers preach hard why we have to have somebody to come in and tell us where we're wrong can you imagine if nathan had come to him and said told him the story about the one who stole the sheep and so forth if he'd come to him when he told him he said it's you lord it's you david what if he'd come to him and said but god's a good god god's a gracious god there's been other people done the same things you've done can you imagine what how the turn of events could have changed but it wasn't that it was when he told him and let him recognize that the law is what he had broken and then david could cry out lord i want righteousness i've done wrong i see myself in the word and i know i'm wrong forgive me and what did the prophet tell him you're forgiven but it could have went completely a different way you love the lord this morning let's read in zechariah and and that little thought come to me as i was studying and been reading some books and and different things and just thinking about sin and law and grace and mercy and man how all this has to tie together and i spoke a little bit of it last time but we look here in zechariah chapter 4 verse 6. then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts let's pray heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've given us we thank you for all that you do for us for your love and your grace and your mercy that you show us continually on a daily basis lord but lord more than anything we thank you for salvation we thank you for forgiving us where we failed you lord jesus and we just asked or that you'd be in the service today in a special way we just ask that you be with those who couldn't be here but blessed brother byler as they'll be traveling we just asked your hand of mercy upon them lord jesus that your guardian angels would would be with them and bring them home safely we just asked that everything would be said and done today would be to bring honor and glory to you in jesus name we pray amen you can have your seats and uh looking at this little scripture my thought this morning and where i'm going i've got a pretty lengthy scripture reading to go with it but i thought you know what i i want to i want to know a scripture that i can place and embed into the head into the mind of the people this morning that would help them to recognize and realize the whole thought in the whole topic and i thought this is the believer's motto this has to be the believer's motto not by my not by power but by my spirit saith the lord when you look here in the book of zechariah you look at this little thought and you look at the word might and when you look at the word might there it's often translated as an army or a force or ability or an efficiency and it's associated with a human resource so god here is looking at that and it can also mean a financial means can be connected with it such as wealth so it's it's by their might and the term power it means a purposeful force firm resolution dynamic strength okay but what what what the the prophet is being told here that it's not by might it's not by power it's not by might it's not by anything that you can do because what has happened here in the book of zechariah is you've got the prophet here you've got zechariah and hagai on the scene at the same time and and hey god there he's pushing to for a rebuilding of the temple and zechariah he is he's looking to minister to those that are sinning and are away from god and he's trying to get him to turn from their sinful ways to get back to the word of god and live life a godly life and in his vision he sees a lamp stand and this lamp stand is a huge lamp stand bigger than what you could imagine and it's got olive trees planted beside it so it's continually being filled with the oil what does the all signify the spirit so here in this scripture right here when you see what this what this is saying it applies to us today because it's only saying that by the spirit of the lord can we do any kind of work only by the spirit of the lord can we do any kind of worship it's only by that spirit that they could accomplish rebuilding the temple and that they could accomplish getting people back to god and i thought that's got to be the believer's motto today not by might not by power but it's by your spirit lord that we do anything we do in life i want to speak to you this morning as i've gathered my notes together i've got i've got notes everywhere this morning so pray for me but i want to speak to you on the warrior within the warriors within think about that thought there brother brown was talking about them the children of israel in the wilderness and we're going to try to take our time this morning so bear with me the children of wilder the children of israel in the wilderness he said here they are in the wilderness on this journey and how they were saying this is no place of pomegranates this is no place to have grapes and figs you brought us out of egypt and we had pretty good home down there and here you brought us here to die in the wilderness without water without food or without anything and you brought us here and he said all of the evidence was against them he said here you have led us up to the side this little low river and now there's the springs in this little oasis just barely enough water for us to drink with and he says oh my listen now isn't that just the way the complainer does when he gets sick god is good as long as everything is good but when things start to go bad what is your perspective of god then that's what happens with these people they're complaining did you not bring us out into the wilderness from egypt and now you brought us into the wilderness to die and he said here we are we haven't got nothing to eat we haven't got no pomegranates and the only thing we're getting is just a little manna that's rained down at night time and you tell us that when the men come back it's going to be all in vain he said we've left our countries and we can't go back can you see these people it's an amazing scene he said our children are going to have to be raised in this kind of condition and the cities are all fancy over there and they run races of chariots around the wall tops we don't have nothing but just a few old pruning hooks and swords and things in our hands and look at that great army over there that opposition they're so big one of them could whip a dozen of us and he says listen to this isn't that the way the devil pictures it isn't that the way the devil pictures it that the devil will come and bring stuff up in your life and he'll blow up obstacles in front of your path he'll make mountains out of molehills things that we know god is more than able to conquer but satan blows it up in such a way and fashions it that we feel like we're unconquerable and that's what he's done to these people joshua he said i can see him standing there i love it when the prophet tells these stories i could see him standing there and caleb alone in his face all brightened up his face is all brightened up and says glory to god he's looking and sees the same thing the chariots running up on top of this wall talk and he's brightened up and just went and said glory to god we can take it anyhow listen to the story taking place here he says how are you going to take it he said it ain't how i'm going to take it it ain't my business to figure it out that's god and he said let me tell you he said god said it belongs to us so it's mine god said so repeat that with me it's mine god said so do you believe that this morning because we have to have the same mindset and the same thought of joshua and caleb as they look at these walls they don't look at them as in defeat follow me in numbers 13 as we read through this i'll skip down through some but follow along if you're taking notes and the lord spake to moses it said send thou men into the land of canaan which i give and which i give did you hear that which i give unto the children of israel skip on down to verse 17. so what is happening between 1 and 17 as moses has gathered up all the men of the tribes the twelve tribes of the children of israel brought them all together and said here's your commission and moses sends them out to the spy the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain and see the land see the land to see what it is see the people that dwell there see if they're strong see if they're weak see if there's few see there's many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad whether cities whether it's tents or in strongholds and what the land is whether it be fat or lean or whether there be wood they're in or not and whether you be of good courage and bring the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes now this next statement blows our little in our little in finite minds we can't imagine and we can't fathom the next statement what happens here in the bible they came into the brook of ishkov this is verse 23 and they cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they buried between two upon a staff and they brought the pomegranates and the figs so you mean the very things that they were complaining they didn't have we don't have any grapes we don't have any pomegranates we don't have any figs there's nothing in this land we're drying up we only get a little manna and god says go over here and shout it out tell me what you see over here and they have to come back with two men on a pole with a cluster one cluster of grapes can you imagine the size of the cluster of grapes that takes two men to pack if they don't make a believer out of you you ain't a believer [Music] there's no believing in you because let me tell you if two men come in here packing one cluster of graves i'm going to bow down to somebody god's going to know what i think and they returned verse 25 from searching the land after 40 days and when they came to moses and aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel and to the wilderness of tehran to uh kadesh and brought backward unto them all into the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land look at here and they told him and said we come into the land where you sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless follow with me now you'll see where we're going later nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anec there the amalekites dwell in the south the hittites of the and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites they dwell in the mountains and the canaanites they dwell by the sea by the coast of jordan oh my goodness enemies all around them enemies all around them and everything that they've stated up to this point you know what they you know how they assess the situation with their eyes they were looking through their natural eyes and said yeah there is grapes over there there is good things there but look at the giants look at look at those from anac descendants over there look at these people look at the enemies all around us and caleb steal the people before moses and said let us go up there once and possess it we're more well than able to overcome it and yet they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of israel saying the land which we have gone and searched is a land that eateth up at its inhabitants and all the people we saw in are of great stature and there we saw giants the son of anach which come from the giants and we were in our own site as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight what an amazing story here we have of people a group of people that god called onto the scene and said i want you 12 to go over here you gather them up and i want you to go and i want you to look and tell me what you see and you've got these people that go over there and they're looking at the same landscape they're looking at the same city they're looking at the same enemies they're looking at the same uh fruits the same everything that's over there but yet there's two different outcomes there's two different ways that they're looking through this this story of joshua and caleb give us the keys and it gives us the strategies and the insight to learn how we can be on and how we can be courageous up in the in the lord and we face impossible situations in our life because to the natural eye brothers and sisters there was giants in that land there are giants in your land there's giants in the land this morning and they're not going anywhere and if you think you're going to live in a fairy tale where everything is good you're wrong because these giants are there and you may be facing some of these descendants of anac this morning and as you're sitting here and you may be facing and wondering how am i going to defeat this giant of a situation that i'm going through how am i going to climb over this wall that i can't get around how am i ever going to be victorious this morning because it looks like i can't win you ever felt that way no matter what i do i can't win thomas payne in 1776 said these are the times when they try men's souls you have to be able to look further than our own understanding when we examine our life in this way because in ourselves it don't go too good when our backs are pressed against the wall and you can feel satan his steamy breath down your neck you're not going to do nothing well you might think you will but you're not going to do nothing you need more than yourself you need more than what you have to give and when you're sitting there and and you look at it it's true today it's just the same it takes for us what does it take for us to become strong and courageous it takes god it takes for us when things are when we're scared to death to be able to stand there and fight john wayne said courage is being scared to death and saddling up anyway i thought that sounds pretty good it's looking at your enemies in life and saying i'm scared you you are so big you are such a giant in my life but i'm gonna go anyway i'm not going to sit here and let you continue to beat me and defeat me and put me down i'm going to go anyway why because we are chosen for this mission and i'm going to look at some men and women today that were chosen for the mission so here god is getting ready to take these israelites into the promised land and the pillar of fire has rested the cloud and rested and god is preparing to send them over into the promised land and give them what is theirs and here you have these two men joshua and caleb and they're going to go over there on this 40-day reconnaissance mission you might say they're going to go over there and they're going to scout it out with these other 10 men the difference is those other 10 men said we'll go over and see what's in that city joshua and caleb said we're going to go see what gods give us do you see the difference in the perspective we're going to go see what god give us because god has promised me this land god has promised us this and we've been told this since we were just little bitty boys we may be the youngest in this group of 12 men but i tell you god said it and i believe it two believed it ten doubted before they ever left the camp so if you think you're gonna come to church you get a blessing from god and you don't believe it you're going home empty if you think going to the next church camp or the next youth banquet you're going to go get something for god but you don't believe god it can really do something you're going to go home empty you have to believe before you go and here they come and they come back these these men come back with this bad report and they tell what they seen over there but yet they showed them the fruit of the land but they never accepted it as their own they never took ownership when they come back with that big cut a bunch that bunch of of grapes dragging between them they said oh look what they grow over there look what they do and joshua cole is saying we'll be full tonight we fix the need of the goodness because them's ours then people's working for us over there they're growing our grapes they're growing our pomegranates they're growing our eggs that's our city it's all in your perspective and so here they come and they tell them i said we went where you sent us kind of uh sarcastically moses we went where you sent us they got grapes they got milk they got honey they got goodness but their cities are fortified there's no getting into there and we saw the descendants of anac they're ten foot tall you realize that's where goliath came from they're huge here we are at our little 5-2 stature little israelite man they double us in size they're huge they've got to five cities i think it's amazing that they give the first thing they tell us how wonderful it was they tell how wonderful it was but still you see the trend here it flows with milk and honey and it's it's full of fruit nevertheless but how many of you've ever added nevertheless in your life god is able to do whatever whatever he's promised me nevertheless if i had a little more time if i had a little more money if i had a little more prayer life if i had a little more resources if i had a little more help if i had a little more back from the pastor i could do all these things through christ who strengthened me but nobody believes me nobody tells me how good i did when i preached i'm just kidding thank you thank you i thank you all for your compliments i really do they mean a lot every preacher appreciates them they may tell you they don't it don't matter but they appreciate it but you see what i'm saying these 12 men had been all slaves in egypt but 10 of them are defeated mentally they never got over what happened they never got over what happened that was their attitude of the ten these ten men ate the same manna they drank the same water they walked across the same red sea followed the same pillar of fire [Music] think about this these people had seen it all and they were looking through their own eyes of understanding but you see god don't ask you to understand everything he asked you to believe everything that's the difference they tried to understand what they were seeing that's why the prophet said when there's something that goes on or you read something or somebody says something in his ministry and he said if you don't understand it what did he say just put it up on the shelf and leave it alone we don't have to understand everything let me tell you i will never understand everything you will never understand because we we just play a small portion in the mind of god of what he reveals to us and then there's caleb caleb stands there this believer and he quieted the people before moses they said let us go up there at once we are well able to take it because caleb knew the words of influence and he knew his words could influence the people so he basically said shut up you doubters you murmurers you planers shut up because i have a good report we are well able to overcome that is the profession of the believer [Music] but you know joshua and caleb were probably the two youngest there and they've got these elders whoa whoa whoa boys you know i i really i really appreciate your experience i really appreciated the trip we took over there i like your ambition and all but you know we got a little bit more experience than what you've got and you know we're able to look over there and we're able to see that we can't go up against those people this land that we've gone through and sent these spies did you not see that it devours its inhabitants it devours its inhabitants you had to see that joshua well you had to notice that game you had to you had to see that that all the people are of great stature and they're giants it's impossible it's impossible boys because they're so much bigger than us they're stronger they're muscular they're warriors they swing swords and have spears but i want to remind you this morning as i thought about that thought i thought you know what that was true as they're looking over there there's a lot of truth to them and no doubt they had to see it the same as they did but the only thing they were looking through different eyes because you know this morning i want you to know that god still turns death into life god still opens blinded eyes god still opens the deaf ear god still makes the lame walk and he still parts the red sea but let me ask you how many of you are willing to put your foot in front of the other and walk across that red sea there's the difference there is the difference you have to be able to put one foot in front of the other because the bible says so a man thinks in his heart so is he so if i think i'm gonna walk over there and possess that you hear that that says possession because god told them everywhere that your feet hit everywhere the soles of your feet hit is yours and how you react to a situation significantly changes it are you an overcomer this morning be a prayer warrior this morning be a devil slayer this morning be an overcomer be victorious in the word of god today and this is not something that just happens overnight you you kind of learn this you had to learn that no matter what you go through god is bigger that god is bigger and you got to be what you can be for god be all you can be i don't know whose motto that is but be all you can be i can remember when i was younger and people come up and say brother brad pray for me and i'll be like okay and i would but was i sincere in it and i say it's learned because now i learn when people come up to you and say brother and so sister so-and-so will you pray for me they're not just saying that because they're going up and asking everybody they're saying that because they've got confidence in you they're saying that because they believe that you have a connection between you and god that god will hear your prayers and then i begin to realize that and i thought when somebody tells me that it's my duty i am duty bound and commissioned of god to go on my knees and pray for that people with diligency be a prayer warrior a devil slayer the prophet said 10 of them 10 of them said oh we can't take it they're like grasshoppers we're like grasshoppers but not that fellow no sir he said we're more than able to take it and listen what he says it depends on what you're looking at if you're looking at your crippled hand it'll just stay that way he said if you're looking at that tumor it'll just run that way he said it'll just stay the same but look away from that look at the promise of god it depends on what you're looking at because christians look at the unseen god told them way down in egypt he said i give you the land but here's where we jump in here i'll give you the land but the prophet said he didn't tell you i'd go sweep it all out garnish the houses hang up the curtains and just let you move in see that's the way it is a lot of times we want god to do something instantaneous for us we want god to give us right in the moment we don't want to work for it we don't want to go down and pray for it we don't want to seek and be diligently and get before god and say god you promised me this what do i have to do what is my part of this it's like brother danny talked about the guy on the boat the boat the rescue came to him twice but he was looking for god to do something big and here's exactly what they were doing they wanted it all right then but then that's when he said everywhere that your souls of your foot lands that's possession he said just keep fighting the devil says the days of miracles are passed you're lying tell the devil you are lying tell him we fail to tell satan what he needs to hear satan when he comes to you you tell him out loud satan you're a bluff satan you are a liar satan go back to the pits of hell where you belong because i am a child of god and god said it's mine you remember so they are these guys were these ten they see themselves as insignificant they see their enemies and they see that their enemies think they're insignificant look at how the negative report affected the whole congregation you want to get a church going in a good direction everything going good people being saved people giving their hearts people doing things for god and people's happy and the brother and sister just love everybody and the church is going good just get one person to start murmuring it says the congregation heard this and the congregation lifted up their voices and cried and the people wept that night they had a little pity party they had a little pity party we're doomed we'll just go back to egypt we're doomed but joshua and caleb they wouldn't quit they heard this they heard him crying and joshua and caleb said i've heard enough of this brother me too and they rent their clothes why was that they were signifying don't you people know who you are this is serious business we rent our clothes and listen to us we can take the enemy [Music] and he told them this is our land it's ours god said he would delight for us to have it it's god's delight for us to have it and the protection of them of their soldiers it's gone it's ours all we got to do is go take it please let's go take it let's gather up let's gather up and then we have a happy ending right no he said the congregation want to take up stones and stone them god's man and the congregation wants to take up stones and stone them brother and sister that congregation had more faith in the enemy in fear they had more faith in the enemy than the faith in the god they should be trusting did you hear what i said more faith in the enemy which is fear than in the god they should have been trusting and the people said if only we would have died in the wilderness if only we would have died in the wilderness can't you hear those whiny voices i got a problem with people who claim to be believers and are whiny so i ain't got no time for whiners and here they are whining we should just go back to age and god sent us out here and he's gonna kill us all our children look at our children whiny big babies let me ask you this do you know what god promised to us is hold on to your seats he promised you one thing salvation and people wonder why believers nominal christians fall away day after day after day by the hundreds by the thousands because we tell them that god is a god of love god is a god of grace god is a god of abundance god is a god of blessings and he is he's every one of those but it doesn't say he's going to have you're going to have it all the time and people lead people to christ trying to tell him that if you come to god he's going to be great life is grand our businesses are blessed our homes are blessed we're happy all the time and me and my wife never had a spat wake up wake up but god said i'll give you salvation that's what has to hold us that's what has to hold us as believers is that we look and we say no matter what comes our way no matter if i'm drinking soda water and crackers no matter what comes my way i'm still going to serve god because he died for me on that cross brother and sisters god wanted all of the children of israel to go in that day it was his desire for every one of them to go in and we see it all through the bible john 3 16 says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that what whosoever could believeth in him should not perish no doubt he told those children of israel it's yours if you just believe you shall not perish but do you know what happened to them everyone over the age of 20. that [Applause] joshua and caleb started the new children of israel because everybody over the age of 20 died they wandered for years and years and years because of rebellion because of unbelief for 40 years they wandered for years until all 20 year olds and above had perished all because of a little giant notice i said a little giant because it's all in our perspective of what we see i want to read next out of judges chapter six and as we go into judges i want to look at a thought here in the book of judges i'll tell you where he's going to look at men and women i've got one of the most revered women in the bible i'm fixing to tell you about the book of judges takes place after joshua's death so there was no leader amongst the children of israel so god begins to put a judge in place 12 different judges one of the women that you know of and you've heard the name is deborah so she was one of the prophetess and one of the judges in the in the for the like for the tribe of israel but the children of israel could not keep their position and that's why god had to give them judges they would get themselves up and they would do good and they would be good they would serve god for a while and then the next thing you know they would give over into the ways of the land they would give over to the gods that was around and they couldn't find himself so god would send a judge and he would clean up the mess over and over the book of judges is a brutal book when you read the book of judges you get ready for a horror scene people are getting their thumbs cut off people's being impaled blood's being shed and everybody wants to believe god's just a god of love let me tell you god is a warrior you look all through the bible from the beginning to the end god is a warrior even in the book as he comes back in the book of revelation on a wide horse with a sword from his mouth what is that he's a warrior god will always take care of business but here over in the book of judges i'll tell you this little story about this woman i like you don't hear many stories in the bible about women but i just want you to know god has women too that are warriors so the children of israel deborah tells the children of israel the warriors of the children of israel you've got to go out and you've got to fight these canaanites and you've got to go out there and you've got to slay them so they go after they go out to slay the two of the canaanites and as they go out there to slay them though the war takes place and everybody dies and the children of israel are victorious but there was one general that got away sister i think was his name and he got away and you know what he did he tried to weasel his way in to the camp of the children of israel and he comes in and he weasels his way in to jail's tent and jl was a tent maker she knew how to construct the tent she knew how to take them down when they moved it was her job to dismantle these tents reapply and put them back up she wove the coverings out of goat hair so she was a strong handed woman with her hands and this man comes in to her home which is not acceptable because she was the only one there and this man comes in and he gets in there and he says i'm gonna hide here and jl knows all the men are out to war and she's all alone she knows who this guy is but she refuses to accept any dishonor upon her home this was a woman who if this man had wanted he could have taken her he could have raped her he could have murdered her he could have tortured her [Music] and not to mention it was an abomination for him to be into her house and he says i need water and i want you to think of the wittiness of this young lady instead here have some milk what does milk do to your babies that's exactly right and here she feeds this milk to this man almost showing favoritism to him and so here he drinks of this milk and he thinks everything's good and he just kind of lays himself to sleep being a servant of god she says i've got to act on this i've got to act so that i can save my countrymen so that i could save my dignity so that i can save my name amongst the people of the children of israel and she sneaks over to this man with a stint a tent stake everybody familiar with this story a tent stake they're about this long and she takes this two-pound sledgehammer while he's sleeping and puts it right to his temple and it says she staked him to the ground tell me god don't mean business she staked him to the ground and when the children of israel came back when all the soldiers come back she called to him bear rat come here look let me show you what i got let me show you what you let go and let me show you what god did in my house let me tell you ladies something you don't let men rule and roost as far as telling you this or that you can't do this or you can't do that because when god tells you to do something you can take charge in your house under the anointing of the holy ghost judges chapter six now we're gonna have to hurry chapter 6 verse 11. and there came an angel of the lord and said under the oak which was in ophra it pertained unto the to josh that abby's absolutely right sorry and his son gideon thrashed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee what's it say thou mighty man of valor and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us then why all of this be following us remember we're in the book of judges things were not going good and god has to call somebody up on the scene to straighten out the people and he says if you where's all the miracles which our father told us of did not the lord bring us up out of egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thou might that thou shalt save israel and whose might that thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i'm the least in my father's house and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shall smite the midians as one man brother and sisters here we find gideon hiding in fear we find gideon hiding in fear not knowing what tomorrow holds not knowing that he could be dominated by the midianites at any time we don't know what the future holds in our lives you don't know what tomorrow that you'll be going through you don't know what it looks like you know we just went through a year filled with turmoil and we've talked about it before and and unemployment's now up and people won't work and you need people to work and people won't work you don't have stuff on the shelves groceries this is what's going on gas prices are out the roof ain't going to keep climbing i heard brother brian telling the financial report i had to fill my gas tank up that's not fun my propane tank i thought man i better fill this thing up but maybe i've done the right thing because it could be five dollars a gallon tomorrow because russia is crazy we might be at war right now for all we know we're in church we don't know when it's going to happen it's going to happen so we could be at war right now not knowing what tomorrow holds so this year has been a very trying year and it's just february we all thought we were going to have a better year cobin was gone no it's still rampant we thought things are going to get good no inflation just keeps going up and here the nation of israel was in a similar circumstance israel was reaping the seeds of disobedient and rebellion you know if you disobey and you rebel against god probably not good things are going to happen because it's going to catch up to you it will find you your sins will find you and here is a nation that was suffering terribly under the oppression of the midianites they were hungry they were poverty-stricken it was pain just to go out and see them and and the lord called them to free them and we're so stubborn sometimes that we can't accept our freedom and the lord allowed this chastisement to go on for seven years these raiding parties of the midianites would come in and come in and take over the grain that was being harvested by the children of israel they couldn't even thresh their wheat you don't have your thresh wheat you take a basket you throw it up in the air as high as you can the wind blows away the shaft and the seed falls to the ground when they throw their seed up hey there they are so that's why we find gideon down in the pit and he's he didn't have he didn't have no wind down in that pit but he's hiding he's hiding down in there and he's down there throwing us up and he's tiptoeing looking around making sure no midianites you know sometimes we tiptoe we tiptoe around satan but we really don't have to because we've been given authority by the word of god but we find ourselves many times just like gideon there threshing our weed in the pits of our sorrow hiding in our poverty and we find ourselves down there and then the angel lord comes to him and says let me tell you something get in let me tell you about the life your life i can't imagine gideon's surprise when the angel of the lord come to him and makes a statement you know but the prophet brother branham said that the angel of the lord was none other than the lord so he's having a personal interview with god almighty he said it was l capital l o r d and he's having this personal interview with him and he says gideon yes lord my mighty man of fowler and gideon he probably said lord did you see me in that pit i'm scared lord i'm afraid i'm hiding from the people that i know can take me and he says get in don't look through your mind listen to what i say about you you mighty man of valor you man of great courage you man who can face danger especially in battle that's what valor means listen to this bravery courageous fearless braveness backbone spine heroism manliness boldness gallantry you see it's all in the eyes of the beholder get in you are a warrior get inside i'm a farmer i'm a farmer can't you see me down here threshing this wheat gideon you're a warrior i i know lord i know about the children of israel i know the promises of abraham isaac and jacob i know the story of joseph i know he rose up to be second only to pharaoh i know all those things i know the red sea was parted i know you fed us in the wilderness i know all those things but i'm just insignificant gideon was well versed in the word of god and he telling god what he knows about god and i can't imagine god must chuckle in under his breath and you think you're a farmer get in gird up yourself because i say you're not a farmer but you're a mighty man of valor how can i save israel god my clan is the weakest in the nasa you know manassas was the tribe of the children of israel the land was given to them it was as the land was distributed out right there in the book of judges there was a little portion of land given to manassas group they were the littlest the most insignificant group amongst the children of israel he wasn't lying to god he told god the truth we are from the youngest the littlest the little itty bitty spot on the map you can't even see is god and i'm the littlest of the little a mighty man of valor you know many would say that gideon was a coward for being in that well i say no i think he had a right to be afraid at that day at that point at that very minute in his life he had no choice but to be afraid because he was thinking with limited capacity at that time at that time he didn't know who he was all he knew is if i make the mistake the many nights are going to come through here and wipe out my food they're going to wipe out my family they'll take my wife they'll take my children and that's the way we get sometimes in our lives we fail to realize and see ourselves for what god sees us as and we fall into that trap of thinking i'm just the littlest teeniest tiniest little stuck on the map and satan's going to come in here and just take me over but god says you mighty man of valor you know there was a passage in the new testament and it tells how we all react to life's obstacles let's bring it down to when jesus was walking in sandals here jesus was on the scene and he's preaching to this crowd of people about 5 000 men that said which so we can establish it maybe it was 10 or 15 000 people total when you count women and children maybe more than that historians really don't know and as he's preaching these children his disciples come up to him and says lord the evening is approaching we need to send these people away we need to send these people away because it's getting late and they need to go buy themselves some food they're getting hungry lord you're wearing the people out he wasn't preaching one of those evangelistic meetings he was given out substance he was giving out substance and jesus looked at the disciples and said there's no need for them to go away but but lord they have to have something to eat well jesus says well then go give them something to eat can you imagine them looking around be right back lord but lord we got five loaves and two fishes jesus says feed the people feed the people but but but lord let me show you what we got in here we got but what's in there five loaves and two fishes and jesus says give me that give me that basket there's your fish there's you a fish there's you a fish there's your fish and she a fish are you hungry are she a fish does you a fish pass that down they need some fish and he goes through the whole crowd and he gets fish after fish and bread after bread after bread and fish after fish and fish and why to prove to the people to prove to them that god thinks that nothing is impossible and he not only did that feat once he did it twice read your bible it didn't happen just once twice and he distributes out these fish over and over and over what is he doing he's trying to get the people's attention and say don't worry about what you see or your circumstance because i'm in control you know the prophet tells a story and he said he was in a prayer line and you've heard it over and over and i didn't realize for a long time that it happened in a prayer line but he said they left me in the prayer line too long and it pulled him down it pulled him down to a place that he almost got sickness and and pain set up on him and distress set up on him and he was just sitting there and he said they let they just let me in there too long and he said that the the man come to him and said preacher branham he said yes sir did you keep your religion during the time of your sickness no my religion kept me you can't do it in yourself the prophet couldn't do it in himself the the children of israel couldn't do it in their self gideon couldn't do it in himself moses couldn't do it in himself joshua caleb none of those people jl they couldn't do it in themselves but what was it it was god moving on the scene and we need god to move into the scene in our lives on a day-to-day basis the lord turned to get in and said i'm sending you out you go out in strength go out in the strength you have and i'll take care of the rest of it god basically told him gideon i am enough sometimes we got to realize that god is enough that when you're staring down the eyes of that giant that wall we talked about that you didn't do you know you can't get around the sickness that's upon you that you can't get through you have to just look and say god you're enough why am i threatened why am i holding on to this why am i why am i not allowing myself to get through this because god i know you're enough we just simply need to show up and let god do the rest when you go to the doctor and they say there's no way say i'm here and god's with me i'm here and god will do the rest the lord told gideon that what strength he had was sufficient did you see that in the bible read it closer when you go home god told him what strength you have brother jeff what strength you have it's sufficient what strength you have brother john it's sufficient what strength you've got brother tommy it's sufficient because all that we are is what he is in us you remember that prophecy i was telling you about the lamp stand with the gut with the oil in it the holy ghost all that we are is what we have in the holy ghost god is enough you know billy graham brother brown talked a lot about billy graham and he's throughout the message crusaded around the country around the world and his invitation him does anybody know what it is sister becky you know what it is just as i am just as i am god don't ask you to be nothing that you're not you come just as you are and he does the rest just as i am brothers and sisters there's a warrior within this morning and i hope you've been able to look and see with the thoughts that i've had and the inspiration of the holy ghost that god has quickened it to your ear and dropped it down into your that that warrior within is within you god is calling a people you say well last week last month we were getting so beat up so bad in church but it's because god wants you to realize how important he was so that he can make you what he wants you to be that's the way god revolves around in the believers sometimes he has to tear us down to build us up and thank god we're in a build-up stage but recognize today that you are a warrior that there is victory on the horizon that our security is here that overcoming power is here and that we are all that we can be if we're willing to trust to follow and obey if the musicians would come let's stand our feet this morning so i challenge you this morning you know i always try to put out a challenge to you i challenge you this week to find that warrior within when satan comes knocking on your door and he's going to come knocking yes find that warrior within be a gideon be a joshua be a caliph be a jl slay the demons before you and be victorious in god let's pray heavenly father we're thankful this morning lord jesus for your word we're thankful for uh characters that we can look at in the bible that was recorded down through history and through time men and women that were just like us no doubt was weak in themselves their eyesight was dimmed in their selves they couldn't see uh the goodness of what you had given them but the the pain and sorrow and suffering that they were in but god you moved on the scene in their life and you made warriors out of warriors you made warriors out of people who were scared you made warriors out of cowards and lord we ask today that you make warriors out of us believe believers because lord we love you with all of our heart lord we know the most important thing that we can receive from you is our salvation and lord as long as we've got that salvation we're happy in that lord jesus and the enemy knows the enemy knows and the enemy comes out to destroy us because the bible tells us he said heal steal and destroy he wants us to steal our happiness he wants to destroy our homes he wants to destroy our marriages he wants to destroy the good things that god has done for us but as we look at him let us not look at him through eyes of magnification let's don't look at him as a child of anac but let's look at him as a little puny little spot because we are more than able we're more than conquerors we're more than sufficient and we thank you for that lord we thank you for what you do for us lord make us what you would have us to be we love you lord with all of our heart jesus name amen can we get this song up sister donna just as i am let's try to sing that if we could just
