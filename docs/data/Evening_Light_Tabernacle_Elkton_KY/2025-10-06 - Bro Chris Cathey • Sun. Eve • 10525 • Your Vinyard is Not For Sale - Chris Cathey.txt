And you answer my please. Teach me not to rely on what others do, but to wait in prayer for an answer from you. They that wait upon the Lord, they shall renew their strength.

Oh, they that wait upon the Lord, they shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. And they shall run and not be weery. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. [Music] So, I just wanted to tell a little bit of my testimony. Um, as you know, me and Caleb were just blessed with um, our miracle and we are very excited and we just thank you all for all your prayers. Um, a little bit I just wanted to say a little bit about the testimony. I can't say everything because there's just too much God has done for us honestly during this time. Um, but I did find a quote from brother Brandham and in one of her his sermons he said, "Faith is substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things I do not see." See what I mean? Here in my pocket, I think there's an old barlo knife I've carried for years now. I do not see that knife. I do not feel that knife. I do not taste that knife. I do not smell that knife, but I know that knife is in there. How do you know? Because I believe it's in there. Now, if it is not in there, faith will put it in there. if it's not there. And that's exactly what God did for Caleb and I. We may have not been able to see things, but we had faith and believe God would do it and he did. And we've been um it's been about a year now and we had kept believing and I had some problems and um just in my body that needed to be healed and they would cause complications, but I wasn't going to let that get in the way of my promise. And during the time of waiting, we had been given so many confirmations just from all kinds of just different things. People have talked to us and um sent scriptures to me and didn't even know we were praying for a child at the time. And they uh they were just wonderful. And we also had meetings in May and um we all had been up at the altar when um brother Timothy Puit, he just comes out and says, "I believe we're in an atmosphere that a mama can ask for a daughter, ask for a son." and it'll happen. And that can mean anything to anybody, but I just know that God was telling me and he was just telling me to keep leaving and it would happen. I had felt led to go ahead and start building a nursery over time and little by little, we just bought little things here and there and I just kept claiming our miracle. And in those same meetings, Brother Andrew Spencer prayed for us as well through the prayer line. And later on, I I believe it was brother Tommy that sent Caleb a message and said, um, "Send me the test once you get the positive report and mention Andrew Spencer's wife said that the the Lord moved on her while Caleb and I were being prayed for and said that he had expectation of powerhouse testimony." Well, I'm here today saying that God did it and and he is the same yesterday, today, and forever because he did give us this miracle. And um after the meetings and just throughout the year, my faith was constantly being tested. There had been times the devil would try to come in and just with lies and spirits of doubt and fear. But even then, I knew that with God all things were possible when we believe. And so we we continued to believe. And um another thing just randomly out of it came to me around like 11:30 one night and I kept hearing a scripture over and over and I had been trying to just fall asleep and it just was not happening and I was like well what is this and it was out of Thessalonians 3:10 and it it said night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith. And of course during this time I was, you know, dealing with the the spirit of fear and just just different things the devil wanted to torment me with. And I just I knew I wanted to be the best Christian I could be before I became a mother. And I just heard it heard the scripture and I was like, "Oh, I think that's God reminding me to just stay in his word." And he wants to fellowship with us day and night. And I just needed to keep reading his word, keep praying. And I know that as long as I kept believing that it would happen and I didn't want to be lacking in anything to receive the promise and I just wanted all the faith that I could just as a mother but not just as a mother but as a believer as well. And then about four weeks ago or so, Sister Donna texted me and she sent me a message. she got uh she was up there in the Virginia meetings and she had just texted me saying that she she believed that the Lord was going to bless us with little ones and um she stood up for us in prayer and I guess Austin uh Westerman as well did that too and um and then of course just a little bit after that it was um like two I think it was two weeks after that we took a test that I had I had been taking over and over. Nothing came back positive. It was just all negative and it was making me worry about different things I had going on. And um and then all of a sudden the first one came back positive. And exactly a week from then um that's when h that the test came back positive and that's when we knew that our miracle had come and that that's what God we seen that God did it and he had healed me from everything that that I had asked of him. [Applause] So, I just wanted to say that our testimony shows that you can ask absolutely anything. And as long as you stay with the word, have faith and believe and fight through all the devil's lies, God will make it happen. If he can do it for me and Caleb, then he can do it all the more for anyone who needs any healing or an answered prayer. [Applause] I just wanted to sing this song just saying how awesome God is. [Music] You call the sun to rise. You lay it down to rest. You hold this heart of mine. You hold my every breath. Such an awesome God. So mighty, so holy, so wonderful, such an awesome God, so selfless, so generous, so faithful. You are [Music] seated in majesty, reigning in holyness. The table is set for me. For you are the living breast. Such an awesome God so mighty, so holy, so wonderful, such an awesome God. So selfless, so generous, so faithful you are. And nothing comes close to the Lord Almighty. Nothing as sweet as his love and mercy. Nothing comes close to the Lord. Almighty, nothing as sweet as his love and mercy. [Music] Jesus, the son of God, hung on a cross to die. But not even death itself could hold you down. For you rose to life. Such an awesome God so mighty. So holy, so wonderful, such an awesome God, so selfless, so generous, so faithful. You are such an awesome God. So mighty, so holy, so wonderful, such an awesome God, so mighty, so holy, so wonderful, such an awesome God. So selfless, so generous, so faithful.

Let's stand this evening as we prepare to turn service to brother Chris and let's just sing My God is awesome. He can move the mountains. My God is awome. He can move the mountains.

I hope everybody's awake. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope everybody's ready for the word. &gt;&gt; You know, I tell you that's the main course meal is the word. You know, I'm thankful for the word. And you may be seated for a minute. I think my boys and my wife have a song they usually sing together. And uh I'll just have them come up if you don't mind. Uh just sing a song on their heart.

You and me are going up. &gt;&gt; I tell you, he said, "This earthly tabernacle dissolved. We have one awaiting." I was preaching my father-in-law's sermon or his last I guess sermon. It's he passed away a few weeks ago and I preached his last uh victory sermon and you know he asked me to preach almost 20 years ago at his at his church my father-in-law and when I came into the message and I never thought I would preach his last victory message and um I just thought about how we all as we get older we're all going to cross that line. You know, there's a time and a place that we're po pointed to to to pass away or move forward. But aren't you glad that we have a promise &gt;&gt; that he said that this old tabernacle those we have one awaiting. That's the that's the one I'm searching for. That should be the one you're searching for. No more aches and pains, &gt;&gt; no more taxes. It's going to be a glorious day. I tell you, brother Brand went behind the curtain of time. Aren't you thankful for a prophet that could go behind the curtain of time and and tell you not to miss it for anything. &gt;&gt; Not to miss this for anything. I, brother Ber, I don't want to miss it. I I I want to make heaven my home. I really do. May God bless you tonight. God bless you, Rachel. That song I'm only in this message. There's just a chorus. I don't know if you know it, but as we transition the service, thank you for having us. Thank you. Thank you, brother Ber. I'm only in this message by grace. It's only by grace that I'm in this place. I But I'm thankful anyway. I am only in this message by grace. [Music] It's only this message by grace. It's only by grace that I'm in this place. I don't know why my God chose me, but I'm thankful. Anyway, I am holy in this message. Oh, sing it tonight. Oh, if you're thankful tonight, let's worship him. I'm only this message by grace. It's only by grace that I'm in this place. I don't know why my God chose me, but I'm thankful anyway. I am only in this message by grace. Oh father, we love you tonight, God. We didn't choose you. Father, you chose us from the foundation of the world, God, that grace came through our door. Father, we're thankful tonight to know you, Lord, to know the truth, to know the word, but God, to be living epistles read of all men tonight. God, I ask you would just energize the word. May it come across and may it just become not just letters on a page, but may it become reality in our life. May it may it give us gaze to serve you through the week, God. May it just not be another just church service, but God, may we may we get something from it, Lord. Speak to us in your way tonight. This grace, Father, we love you. We give you all the praise, the glory. We're not here to please men. Father, we're here to please you, Lord. May you speak, Father, in a mighty way tonight. We love you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you tonight. God bless you musicians. And God bless you, brother Ber. We're just so honored to be here. I I was telling the boys, I was like, "Man, y'all were knee high to a grasshopper last time we came. Now you're really tall." So, but I'm I'm so thankful. I I I'm just thankful that over 20some years ago, I I surrendered my life to Jesus Christ. And most of all, I I came in contact with the word of message of the hour. And my life hadn't been the same. The book hadn't been the same. It's opened up. You know, you wouldn't know what happened in the garden. You wouldn't know about the water, you know, through the water baptism. I know brother Bram says in one place that you don't need revelation for water baptism. But I'm thankful that we know it's in his name. And I'm thankful that we don't have to baptize in, you know, all these names and father, son, hol, you know, all these father, son, holy ghost. And I'm thankful that we have the truth. &gt;&gt; We live in a day that it's it's a confused world. But I'm here to tell you, I we got the truth. It should set you free tonight. &gt;&gt; You should be the happiest people tonight that you got the truth. Let's just turn to him. Uh turn to First Kings 21. A little different thought tonight. First Kings 21. I give you a minute to get there. First Kings 21. May God bless you. I just pray God will just open our eyes and and give us Brother Bram says, "Play for revelation more than anything." And that's what I pray for every day. So first kings 21 verse one this is talking about na nabal's vineyard and it says it came to pass after these things that Nabal the Jezraelite and the vineyard which was in Jezrael hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria and Ahab spake unto Naob saying give me thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house. And he goes on to say he says u verse verse uh right here for near unto my house we're still in verse two and it says and I will give thee for a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee I will give thee the worth of it in money and so and naob nab said unto Ahab the Lord forbid it to me that I should give my inheritance of my fathers unto thee. And Ahab came into his house heavy and dis displeased because of the word which Nahab and Jezerite Jezerite had spoken of for him to him. For he had said, I will not give thee thy inheritance of my fathers. And he had laid down upon his bed and turned his face and would not eat bread. And but Jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him, why is that spirit so sad and thou eatest no bread? And he said unto her, because I have spoken to Dhab the Jezraelite, and said unto him, give me thy vineyard for money, or else or if it pleased thee, I will give thee another vineyard. And he answered, I will not give thee thy my vineyard. May God bless, may God add his blessings to his word. I just want to speak a few minutes. I just wrote this down. Uh just this might sound like an odd topic, but I just thought about Nahhab and his and his vineyard. And you know, I just want to speak on a topic that your vineyard is not for sale. &gt;&gt; That we live in a day and hour that that we live in a day and hour that here we are in this late hour. No one thought we would be this far along. No one thought we would we would even get here. But there's still someone out there. He's waiting to come in. It could be in this church. It could be wherever. But I thought about Nahhab. What he said in this I I thought it was outstanding. But the prophet of God, he would go to say, he said, "Now, so Jezebel, when she when she comes over here, little husband, one day, she's got kind of upset because that man wouldn't break the tradition of God." He said, "And the laws of God," he said, he says that the laws of God to to let him have this place because the law said, he said, "Because the law said that he should keep his heritage and it be handed down to Nabal." The prophet of God says, "But then when he when we find out that he wouldn't do it, Ahab began to pine and running and fell across the bed and that little little Jezebel the little butterfly came and got him up and laid up up up in his upper in her lap and he said, "Now dear, what's wrong with you?" And the prophet of God said, "Oh, Nabal wouldn't let me have his vineyard." She said, "Oh, don't worry. I'll get it for you. Who's the ruler of this kingdom anyhow?" &gt;&gt; That's right. And I believe that's the way we're living today. That that that we had the message of the hour. He had the word open before us. You have a great vineyard today. You had the word of God revealed in your hour that the world wants to tell you, "Come on over here. There's better pleasure." Uh the the the devil wants to tell you, "Hey, leave the message of the hour. Go over here." But there's nothing better than this vineyard. There's nothing better than the vineyard that God has laid before us, me and you, today. He's gave you the best vineyard. He's gave you the best of the word of the hour. He's He might You might not say, "My bank account shows it tonight." But I'm here to tell you, your heavenly account shows it tonight. You have a better vineyard. You have the best vineyard you could have. And I It's just It's just kind of funny, brother, the way brother brings it out. He says, "See that she puts me like in the mind of denominational barriers. See, I'll get it for you." He said, "You just let me have it that my way and I'll get it." and she stomped her little foot and ran out there and she got some more guys and what kind of backsliders went over there to set up a a false uh accuse against Nabal and he had he had him stoned. And you see how the devil, he knows the truth. He knows what you were believing. Young people, he knows that this is the absolute truth. He knows that the message of the hour is has exposed him from Genesis to Revelation. It tells the beginning and it tells the end and it tells the devil where he's going. &gt;&gt; And the devil is after every family. He's after your vineyard. He's after your home. He's after everything he can get out. He is it's he's he's at work. He says he's at he's the accuser of thy brother. He said day and night. If you read the scripture, it says the devil is after us day and night. He's working every single day going to God back and forth. Hey, did you know Isaac did this? Did you know they did this? And God says, "Hey, I paid the price. My blood shed on Calvary. I paid the price." The devil says, "Hey, do you know they made a mistake?" Well, guess what? They asked for forgiveness. I paid the price. It is a paid work at Calvary for every sin that you'll commit tomorrow and then you committed in your past. It's a The cross is a three-dimensional cross. It's for your past. It's for your tomorrow. And it's for your present. It's a cross that presses all sin, everything that you've committed. Young people, if you made a sin, make it right and move on. &gt;&gt; Don't live in that. The devil wants to make you live in a state of fear and anxiety. I've never seen so much anxiety between the young people and the the uh I want to I want to cut myself. I don't know why I'm saying it. I want to do this. I want there. I want because anxiety is in the land. They want to keep you the devil wants to keep you busy. say, "Hey, there's a better. Hey, this is church is better. This boy I date is better. But I'm here to tell you, you've got the best vineyard." You have the revelation of the hour. &gt;&gt; You have the revelation of the hour today. He said, "But remember, when such sin is that goes on among the people, God's always got somebody that'll stand out and tell them about it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen." Yes, sir. He had a a a Tishbite named by the name of Elijah. Aren't you glad that we had a prophet of our day and he would stand and preach the word. He would bring the word. He didn't have a whole lot of money, but he didn't care about the money. He cared about souls. And that's where you should be. Every one of us should be going, I want to get another soul into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; We should all, no matter who you are, preacher or not, we should all be striving in the same direction. But it seems like a lot of us will have our vineyard set up and we'll plow all day and we'll believe the message of the hour and then someone come up to you in the message. Well, didn't they say this and didn't he say that or take the prophet's word out of contents or hey, well, we don't really need to go to church. No. When brother Rabbit says when them doors are open, you Christian cannot miss a church service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you why. I I believe people are hearing some other different things and this and that and I'm here to tell you the Bible says as the days are approaching &gt;&gt; more so we should be coming to the house of God. &gt;&gt; I tell you why we should be protecting our vineyard. I'm here to tell you to tell you saints that we should protect our vineyard, our home. What God has gave you what God your business everything you got give it back to God. &gt;&gt; Protect your home front. Amen. &gt;&gt; But too many times we don't have backbones that stand up and stand up for our families and say, "Hey, I that's my family. &gt;&gt; For me in my house, we're going to serve God. If everybody leaves this message of the hour, we're going to stand strong, boys. And we're the only ones standing, brother Ber. We're me and you are going to be the only ones standing." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what we got to do. We got to believe it with everything that's within us. It can't be a head knowledge anymore. It's got to be revelation. It's got to go from the head down to the heart. And it's got to be something you live. &gt;&gt; It's got to be a daily walk. Not just, "Well, Brother Chris, the young people, well, I I kind of understand it." No. Let God say, "God, I pray you open up my eyes. &gt;&gt; Open up my eyes." It's like all the when they saw all the all the chariots and he said, "Hey, open up his eyes." I tell you maybe maybe one of you say tonight say Lord I want to see the truth. I want to have more revelation than I had ever in any day. I want to oh you open my eyes more every day. I ask God every day Lord as I read your word be let it become real to me. &gt;&gt; Let it become real to me. It's like my wife she can write me a letter or write me a card. I can read in between it and understand what she's trying to say. She write a paragraph and you can read in between the lines. That's what God has wrote this word of God for us that we can read in between. It's a love letter to the bride tonight to say, "Hey, wake up. It's time to keep marching on. It's time to press on. It's not a time to sleep. It's not a time to just sit back and relax. It's a time to go all the way. &gt;&gt; Give it your all." &gt;&gt; I like what Jezel, he said there, right here. I thought this was interesting. It says in verse one of 2 First Kings 21, it said, "It came to pass after these things that Nabal and the Jezerite had a vineyard." I thought this is very interesting. It might be simple, but I thought it was good. Which was in Jezarel. And I looked that word Jezarel up. And I thought if I could find it here, it says that Jezel, the meaning of Jezrael, it says God sws or God will sow. It's a from the Hebrew word the root zera meaning zora meaning the to sew or plant the meaning of of God. It's it's it's talking about sewing uh it's a place it's a place of sewing. And I'm here to tell you young people old people alike middle age we got to do something. You got to work to do. We got to sew for the kingdom of God. It ain't just sit back and oh read one scripture or do this. But you are God's hands. You are God's mouth. You're God's feet tonight and you got to do something. And that if that's giving your tithes, just helping the church, whatever it is, send in a letter to somebody. Say, "Hey, I haven't seen you in a while at church. I just want to encourage you. &gt;&gt; Sending some flowers." I tell you, brother said, "When they're in the ditch, pick them up. Don't talk about them." &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's a lot of people in this message will come against this person. Come. I'm like, "You don't listen to your tapes. &gt;&gt; You don't read your Bible. I mean, it just it's outstanding. And it shows some of the ignorance in some of the people because they really don't listen. They they push play, but they don't obey. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm just it's not in my notes. That was free. But they don't they just they push play and they don't obey. But I'm here to tell you, God wants you to push play and obey. Read your every day. Get get before God and know him in an intimate way. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he restored what happened in the garden. He wants you to walk with him alone. &gt;&gt; Our God is a jealous God and he wants everything you've got. He wants you to give. He gave his whole entire life for me and you tonight. &gt;&gt; So why can't we give our life back to him and say, "Lord, what I got, I bring to you." It's kind of like Cain and Abel in the Bible. He here and Abel is and I'm going to dramatize a little bit for you. But here Cain and Abel, he had Cain and Here's Abel. Abel had a better sacrifice. Abel brought, you know, sorry, Abel had a better sacrifice than Cain. He worked all brother says he worked all year tilling the land. And he said he brought his sacrifice. He he said, "God, here it is." But you know why? Abel brought the first the first of his of this. He was a sheep herder. He was here he is. He brings the first of it. He brings it to God. And here brings this little lamb. And he says, "God, this is all I got." You know, God, don't you don't need to get c you don't need to clean up. You just need to bring everything to God before God and say, "God, here I am. &gt;&gt; Here I am. Here's my first offerings. Here's everything of me. I made up. I I I need God. I come in this world speaking lies." And you can just say, "God, here I am tonight. Here I am tonight." He even said in one place he said he said I like what he said. He said he brought the first offerings of this little lamb and he goes to brother talks about it and I'm paraphrasing for time but he says he brings them and he said I could see him take this this vine and uh he takes this vine and he's dragging this little lamb and he said it's fallen and here it is trying to make the sacrifice and he says he gets it up to a rock and he said he gets it up to the rock and he says he finds a sharp rock and he starts to beat his neck and he said it started to beat his neck and blood started coming out and he said that that white that that wool started filling with blood and he said that's the same thing with Jesus Christ done for us. He he he took an innocent lamb that was not guilty a perfect lamb went in our place for me and you. He gave every one of us inheritance. &gt;&gt; We didn't deserve it. We didn't we were just born into it. Aren't you thankful today that when God called you, you recognize who you were? Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's still people in the message that does it. They walk around and they're all down and out and they don't recognize who they are because they don't realize what God has done for them. &gt;&gt; What God has really done for you. He's gave you a wonderful vineyard to live in. He didn't give you a life that you could be miserable, down and out, anxiety. I'm here that ain't nothing but the devil. &gt;&gt; That's the devil trying to get you in his vineyard. But I'm here to tell you, God's vineyard is nothing but pure joy. Oh, oh, it gives you it gives you all the fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful of that today? &gt;&gt; So, I'm here to tell you today, protect your vineyard. If we leave here today and I'll ever see you again, I'm here to tell you to protect it with all you got. &gt;&gt; Believe this message with all you got. Protect your homeront. Yeah, &gt;&gt; as I like what this said. Verse uh verse two. I thought it was interesting. If you pull that up, it says, "And Ahab spoke unto Nahab. Naab saying, give me thy vineyard." I thought this was really interesting, brother Ber. He said, "That I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house." I thought, "Wow, it's convenient. &gt;&gt; Give me your vineyard. It's right next door. We need to stop settling for conveniency. We live in a convenient society where, hey, we got to have it right now. It's my way or the highway. Amazon, please order it now, boys. I mean, they'll be like, "Order like, I needed I needed it last night." I'm telling you, I work in the construction industry and you'll you'll you they'll buy something from you and they'll say, "Well, Chris, are you going to do it tomorrow?" "No, we just ordered your job. We just paid the deposit." But everybody wants it right now, right then. And that's how they want it. That's how it's become. Our our societyy's become that way. But I like how he said, "Give me thy vineyard because it's close to my house." And you know what's so funny how the devil will work? Young kids, he'll work. He'll even say this. He say, "Well, you know what?" He said, "I'll give you something better. I'll give you a better vineyard." It says in verse two, then that if he had a better vineyard to give you, I want you to understand this tonight. If he had a better message of the hour, if he had a better vineyard to give you, he would give it to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't it like the devil to work up at somebody and go, "Hey, by the way, if you'll give me your vineyard, I'll give you a better vineyard." He didn't have a better vineyard to give them. &gt;&gt; There's not a better vineyard. There's not a better message of the hour. There's one message that Jesus Christ took a picture with and is hanging up there. I went and saw it. I'm telling you, he took a picture with Jesus Christ. There's not a better vineyard. You're living in the best vineyard you can live in. &gt;&gt; Don't go looking for other vineyards to live in. &gt;&gt; He said, "Because it's near to my house, I'll give you a better vineyard." And it seemed good to thee, I will give thee, and it's so funny. Isn't it funny that he'll want you to sell out to the world? &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, I'll give you the worth of it in money, kids. The devil will come to you in so many forms and say, "Sell out to this. Sell out to this music. Sell out to this nonsense." But I'm here to tell you, sell out to Jesus Christ. Sell out with all you got to Jesus Christ. Verse uh ch uh verse two, I thought it was good. He says that we're at the same thing as I'll give that better vineyard and the worth of money. So he wanted to give them a reimbursement. He wanted to give him something better. He said, "Hey, I got something better, but there's nothing better outside the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I'm just that way. You can call me crazy. This message of the hour is my life. This message in the Bible is my life. I have found nothing better. I found the best vineyard and then God blessed me with a wonderful family, a wife that loves the Lord. And the boys, I tell you, I'm living in my best vineyard. &gt;&gt; And I want to protect it with all I got. And I'm here to encourage you. Fathers, dads, grandfathers, grandmothers, if you have to raise your children, your grandchildren, protect them with all you got. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The devil's coming after every home in this hour. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I like Mark Mark 8:6. It says, "For what shall it profit a man if he should gain this whole world and lose his own soul?" &gt;&gt; Man, that's so true that you know what you could you could do this. I was telling you you can go to this church and go to that. Why why move away if you don't have a church? I don't care how much money it is. &gt;&gt; You find a good home church like brother Bam says and you stay in it. find a home church and he says even support it. &gt;&gt; I'm paraphrasing tonight. That was free. But I'm just here to tell you, brother Ber didn't tell me to tell you that. I'm just here to tell you that's where we should be. We should be a lot further along than we are. &gt;&gt; We should be a lot further along in this message in the Bible than we are. But I tell you what, we live prophet God talks about how we live below our privileges. He's called you sons and daughters of the king. And I like what he said. Daddy said when Rebecca would ask him to sit up in his lap, he would go, "Daddy, show me your muscles and he said, I felt like the smallest, oldest man, whatever he said, however he said it." He said, "But I sure loved it when he asked you asked me that." And that's Imagine what our father does. I was thinking about this tonight. Imagine what we get in God's lap and say, "Lord, I want you to hear me." And he goes, "I'm here. I've been waiting for you to talk to me all day. I've been waiting on you. That's our God today. He cares. He's your daddy today. We got the best daddy. We got the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords. That's your daddy today. You just got to knock on the door. You just got to knock on the door and say, "Lord, I haven't talked to you in a while. I just want to go in the cool of my home, walk around the the backyard or wherever it is, get in a secret place and just say, "Lord, I just want to talk to you." &gt;&gt; That's what God wants. He wants your fellowship. &gt;&gt; But I like his response. His response Ahab said in verse three, it said, "Ahab said to Ahab, I hope this is okay." He said, "The Lord forbid it to me I should give thy inheritance to fathers unto thee." And that's how we should be in this hour that you're not I don't care if my dad comes against me. I don't care who comes against me. We are going to press on with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I got the best vineyard I can ever look for. I'm done looking. I don't need to look anymore, brother Ber. &gt;&gt; This is the best. I'm living in heavenly places. You You should be living in heavenly places. But I tell you, it's time to put a smile on your face and realize what God has handed you in this day. He's gave you the best vineyard you could live in. &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it. Not Not only the bride will just be on the outside of the city. We will be on the inside of the city. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's what I'm That's where I want to be. I want to be on the inside of the city and I could just one day get down and kneel at my father and say, "Lord, you know, when he when we're at the marriage supper, think about it." And he comes by. The he'll come by and wipe our eyes. And he says he'll he'll just he'll wipe your tears and he'll say, "Hey, it's over. It's finished. I believe that's where we're at, young people. I believe we're here. I'm not here to scare you, but I'm here to tell you we are here. We have arrived. &gt;&gt; If you haven't got in the vineyard, I encourage you tonight. I provoke you tonight to get in the vineyard." &gt;&gt; To let God be, let the Holy Ghost be the controller of your life. Let him to be your control tower. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's like you're getting in the plane and you you you think about you walk in a plane sometime we fly we've flown so much in the last 12 15 years preaching. I always thought it's so funny. I'll get in the plane and I'll get in the back and we'll sit down and Rachel's like what are you looking at? I'm like I'm looking through the door and I hate when the stewardist you're going to laugh but I hate when the stewardist is just like hey how you doing? I'm like can you move? I want to see who's driving this plane. I want to see who it is. is I want to see if they got I want to see if they got experience. I want to see if it's a 2-year-old about to fly somewhere. I want to know. But aren't you glad your father is controlling? He's the control tower tonight and he has all your solutions. He has your healing. He has everything you need tonight. Just get to the father. &gt;&gt; But you get in this plane and we look up there and she go, "What are you looking at?" I just want to see who's flying the plane. Is it a robot? Who is it? Is it Is it AI? whatever we got today. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, you got more than AI today. You got a discerner of the heart of the spirit. You got a I tell you, you got a father that's worth uh worth a million million trillion worlds. &gt;&gt; Like he says, one world one one soul is worth a million worlds. I'm thankful for that. And he said, Nab, I like what his response was. He protected his vineyard. He said that I should give thy inheritance of thy fathers to thee. So he said, "Hey, I'm not giving you my vineyard. I know what I got. You need to realize what you got, young people, and protect it with all you got. Not for some boy, not for some alcoholic, not for somebody social media friend." Because we get on social media and they become your best friend. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; They become your virtual friend because they can't have the nerve to talk to you in public. They'll just be like, "Hey, how you doing? I saw you at the meeting. Why didn't you talk to me at the meeting?" because it becomes a virtue. It's easier to do. That's how the devil does. He's very sly. He wants to take everything you got. &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying it, but that's just that's just just there. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, he said, he said, "What are you scared about?" He said, "No wonder." He said, "Fear not. I am he that was dead and alive and again, and I'm alive forever more, and I have the keys of death, hell. Don't worry about nothing. That's what the prophet of God says. He said, "Don't worry about nothing." I think it would be doing some good to just write that down. Don't worry about nothing. That's hard to do. I promise I do it. I'm like, "Wow, don't worry about nothing. Even death can't even hurt you." Notice it's beautiful. Probably God says, he goes on to say, he said, "Let's go." Right. Right. But right quick now the abstract title abstract title the debt is settled. Everything against you against it has been struck off. Glory. He said I may act silly but I feel good. I say amen to that. He said no. See oh an abstract deed. Did you realize what that means? Did you realize what that means, brother? He said there's nothing that can take it away from you. Amen. I'm the holder. Amen. You're the holder. Aren't you glad that that by his grace that you're the holder of the abstract title deed? &gt;&gt; He said, "What deed?" He said, "I have now uh cast it on on my beneficiary of his death, burial, and resurrection." He said, "He became me that I might become him." &gt;&gt; He said, "He became a sinner that I might become a son." Amen. I hold the abstract title deed. He said, "For these signs shall follow them that believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "See, that's the the abstract deed." The prophet of God goes on to say, he said, "One day this buyer," he said he noticed a fine young man with his chest down, his head up. You didn't have to whip him. He he was on alert. He said every time he he was he was done, he he said, "You don't have to hit him." He said, "And that save buyer said, I want to buy him." And the owner said, "He's not for sale." He said, "What makes him so up uh up and add it?" He said, "Is he a boss over the rest of them?" He said, "No, sir." He said, "No, he's just a slave." &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you feed them better than you do the rest of them?" "No." He said, "He eats out of the gallery." He eats out of the galley with the rest of them. He said, "Then what makes him so much different?" So up his moral seems to be high. his moral. Well, he see she, the prophet of God says, "What makes him so different from others?" They're asking the question. He said, "I don't know myself." He said, "Till I find out recently that his father is a king of the tribe." &gt;&gt; He said, "And though he's an alien in another land, he knows his daddy's a king." &gt;&gt; He said he acts like it. He conducts himself like a king's son. He said, "What ought a Christian to do then? We're pilgrims and strangers, but our father is the king." &gt;&gt; Not a king, but the king. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, what we ought we act like when we live in this present world, not like this world, not not to be drove around and sign a ticket. Well, come to church and we'll try our best to do this and we'll go to the next prayer meeting. Brother, sister, we should conduct ourselves like sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh," he said, "you're a family. What are you? You raise your child in a certain environment." Listen to this. It's got 98% better chance to go the right way than it has to bring them up in the wrong way. I tell you, I love that quote. I've always loved that quote. It says, "If you bring them up in the right way, you have 98% better chance." I'll take my chances tonight. I'll take my chances tonight. I'm thankful for that. He said, "Bring up a child as the scripture says, and the way it should go and they when they get old, don't depart." And I'm here to tell you, you might have a weward son. You might have a weward daughter. Great. I'm here to tell you, claim your house. &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance tonight. The Bible, God says, "Hey, Rahab hung, look, she had the scarlet cord out and she claimed her whole entire house." &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's time to hang the scarlet cord out of there and start telling the devil who you are, who your father is. I don't care how far your son's got, how far your grandchildren's got. You claim them tonight. &gt;&gt; They're your inheritance. I'll tell you another place that that you might be the only reason they get in tonight. So, I'm here to tell you to claim your vineyard to protect it with all you got because you might be the only mother, the only father that a son gets in tonight because you've claimed your vineyard. You stayed the you you fought a good fight. We got to keep fighting this fight of faith. It's not an easy walk. I'm here to tell you when you put the brother pastor, when you put the uniform on, it's just like the military. I was telling you the GI bill. I didn't sign it. I tell my brother right here that served in the military, I I'll be honest. I'm just being very vulnerable. I didn't sign up for a war. I signed up for education because I needed to pay for it. But when I when the time came, I said, "Well, here we go. We got to go train for it. We got to get ready." And there was some preparation that we had to go do. We had to go somewhere. We were watching. We had to go here, go to Fort Bliss, Texas. And they had the preparation to get us ready. You know, we're making oursel ready right now. You come in this house of God. You're making you're clothing yourself every single day. Every time you read the word, every time you pray, you are clothing yourself. &gt;&gt; You're making yourself ready. The bride is making herself ready for this coming. &gt;&gt; You're not just sitting here wasting up air. It's a time to get off your seat and say, you know what? I'm going to do something for God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to do something. And I'm not just going to sit here and say, "Well, I'll ask people all the time, how long you been in the message?" Well, I've been in brother Chris, I've been in the message 50 years. And they ain't happy at all. I'm like, brother, you I'm tell you what, you hadn't found Jesus. &gt;&gt; You haven't seen the revelation and what God's done for me. And they'll say, "Well, I just grown up in the message and I've been around." The problem is you don't need to grow up in the message. You don't need to be around the message. Brother said, "The message needs to be inside of you. The message has to be you and you and the God alone where you walk in the truth and say, "God, this is my vineyard. I don't I won't sell it. I don't care if he says there's more money." I had my parents come at a young age and say, "Hey, if you'll leave that message, I'll give you everything I got." She'll tell you &gt;&gt; if you leave what not the craziness you believe. I said, "Dad, you can leave me alone." I said, "I don't want your money. I don't want anything you got." I said, "Because I found the best thing that's ever changed my life." There ain't no other message in the world. And I'm here to tell you young kids, you protect your vineyard tonight. &gt;&gt; You protect it like Nabal. That's Romans 12. They turn if they'll turn to Romans 12 1-2. Romans 12 1-2. It says, "I beseech you be therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed, listen young people, be not conformed to this world, but ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may reprove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of God." The prophet of God says and he goes on to say he says a true predestinated believers will stay with the word because they are part of the word. &gt;&gt; Let me read it one more time. He said a true predestinated believers will stay with the word because they're part of the word. &gt;&gt; I tell you if you're still here today and you're still standing is because you're part of the word. &gt;&gt; The word people leave they leave left and right. They leave a vineyard. I can't believe it, brother Berler. People leave these vineyards and I'm like, how do you leave? Because they never was in the vineyard. &gt;&gt; They they never was in the word. The word never became flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And revelation to them. As Martin Luther, he I was looking at what Martha Luton said. Martin Luther, he says that uh he says he taught Christians to have a responsibility to protect their homes and property. He said he's seeing it as part of their duty to God in society. This protection should be balanced. He said with a commitment to serve others and resist un unjust authority and necessary always striving to act in accordance with God's will. John Wesley, I like what he said. He said, "Do you believe?" He said, "Do you believe that God's commands you not to be conformed to the world? Do you believe it and dare you to obey it?" He said, "Dare you now separate yourselves from this world? Never again be controlled by it and never again be waffled by it here and there and by its fashions. I tell you I turn to John 15 tonight. I was thinking about John how we are the I'll turn it real quick. John 15 how we are the true vine. God has called you to be the true vine. Hey verse 15 verse one. John 15 verse1 he says I am the true vine and my father is the husband. Every branch in me that beareth not the fruit, we're talking about a vineyard. He says, every every branch that not beareth beareth not fruit, he taketh it away, and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth beareth fruit, he purgeth purgth it, and that may bring forth more fruit. And now that the clean through the word which has spoken to you abide in me and in you and as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except abide abide in the vine. No more ye except to be abiding abide in me. I am the vine you are what? The branches. He that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit. For without me you can do nothing. So I'm here to tell you you are the branches. God needs somebody, a living, walking uh being tonight to be connected to the trunk. &gt;&gt; He needs me and he needs our hands. He needs your feet. He needs your mouth. And I'm here to tell you, he's called you out today for a reason. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say verse seven, it says that if you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. He said, 'Herein my father glorified that you bear much fruit shall be my disciples. As the father had loved me, so he I loved him continue in thy love. For if you keep me keep my commandments, you shall abide in love in my love. Even if I have accepted my father's commandments and abide in his love. Verse 11, it says, "These things that I have spoken to you that your joy might remain in you, that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full." &gt;&gt; I tell you, be doing some good tonight and say, "Lord, fill me with some joy. &gt;&gt; I might my tank is low. I'm tired of just walking around, Brother Chris. I want what you I want the fire of God to fill my vessel tonight. I want him to fill everything that's within me. I want to Maybe it's a mother that's wore out tonight that says, "Hey, I'm just tired. I'm just barely getting through. I'm tired of doing this. I'm tired of washing dishes. I'm tired of do cleaning the clothes. But I'm here to God is telling you tonight, hey, keep pressing forward. Keep striving with all you got. God is here to refill you tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, we're doing some good. I want another refilling. &gt;&gt; We can't exhaust God's refillings. Aren't you thankful tonight? &gt;&gt; It's like going to I got tell you going to the gas station. You got to keep filling up. Rachel get on to me all the time. Honey, it says two miles to empty. Baby, I wouldn't wait. I wouldn't wait. I'm just being honest. She'll shake her head. I'm just being truthful. She'll say, "Brother Ber, I there's a gas station up the road." And finally, I pass it. I'm like, "I thought there was." And then you get to praying. You know, we can't live like that with God's grace. &gt;&gt; We got to be filled up and say, "God, refill me every time I come in these doors. Every time I come on a Wednesday night, it might feel like it might be the only might be five people in here, but God, I come to get refilled. I come to get a touch from God. &gt;&gt; Stop worrying about the people to your left and the people to your right or oh, is Susan going to show up? Don't worry about Susan. Just worry about you and your house. Worry about your vineyard. Make sure they get in the car, boys. We going to church. As long as you live in this house, we going to church. &gt;&gt; As my brother said earlier, they said, I always said that saying, my brother Wade said it. He said, they said, I told one someone one time, one pastor, I said, man, my kids got a drug problem. They said, what? I said, yeah, they've been drugged church to church to church. &gt;&gt; Their whole life. They've been drugged to church. &gt;&gt; That's all they know is church. But I'm here to tell you you, it's more than just knowing church. It's knowing the maker. It's knowing the author tonight. It's knowing who you where you stand tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh my, I'm thankful tonight. I'm so thankful. But verse uh 13, it said, "Greater love, no greater love than no man than this, that he'd lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants. For the servantth knoweth not what the what his lord doeth, but I called you friends. For all things that I have heard of my father, I have made known unto you. Verse 16, it says, "You have not chosen me." Aren't you thankful? &gt;&gt; But I have chosen you. I have ordained you that you should go and bring for uh forth fruit that your fruit should be remained. What whatsoever you shall ask in your father's name, he may give it to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; These things I commanded to you that you love one another &gt;&gt; not hate one another. &gt;&gt; Love one another. You know, another thing I see in a lot of churches, oh well, they're they need prayer. Pray for them. They did this. They did that. You know what? I quit worrying about the person to your right, to your left. You know what? Quit worrying about where they're living. Just, hey, if they're in the pew, let God do the let let God give the increase. Don't matter how they look, whatever they if they come in the house of God, let them come in. But you know what? We going God's going to come down and let the God do the changing. &gt;&gt; The word goes forth. It'll do the changing. &gt;&gt; And you know what? That's what hold them. &gt;&gt; That's what'll change a life. &gt;&gt; That's what holds my marriage together. That's what holds my kids together is this word of God. The word of the the the God that's held me 21 years in this message is all Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "These things I command you that you love one for another. If you hate, if the world hate you, listen to this. The world world have hate you, ye that hated me before it hated you." Young people, the world will come against you, the world will say you this. They'll tell you that. They'll like Nahhab's land. They'll tell you this is better. This is better over here. But I'm here to tell you, get anchored in Jesus Christ. And I tell you what, if I could go back, like brother Brandham says, if I could go back and give my life 20 years before or 20 years old, I would have gave it to him. &gt;&gt; You're at a great age, say, Lord, I surrender everything to him. &gt;&gt; Verse 19, he says, "If you were of the world, the world would love his own. But because you are not of the world, this is you. But I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you." Young people, the world hates you. &gt;&gt; The devil hates you. He wants to come after you. But I'm here to tell you to protect your vineyard tonight. I thought about the three Hebrew children. I thought about how they wanted to uh kneel down at this golden image and and and worship Baal. And here's the three ch the three Hebrew children. And I like how brother Brandon paraphrases. He gets up to the fiery furnace. They had it seven times harder. And he says, it says in the Bible that the guards were p dying as they were throwing them in. &gt;&gt; It was so hot that when he got him to the furnace, this is another one that that didn't matter. He wasn't going to give up. He matter if he stoned him like like uh like Jezebel. Jezebel took his Nab's life to get his vineyard. He will take everything you got. He will come after your home. He will come after everything. So, I'm here to tell you to get in the word of God. Let it cover your home. Let it cover your life. But them three Hebrew children, they wouldn't bow down. You know the story. And they would wouldn't bow down and they get in the fiery furnace and there was a fourth man in the furnace. &gt;&gt; And I like what brother Ram says. He said the angels would come up to God and say, "You know what?" He would say, "Woodworm." And and he said they would come up. He said, "Hey, I could I can I can blow it out with water. I can blow that out with water." He said, "You know what? This job's for me." &gt;&gt; He said, "He came down. and he said he grabbed that thunderbolt of lightning and come through and here he comes and he he's always on time. &gt;&gt; We serve a God that's always on time, young people that you might go through the darkest time in your life. You might go through the hardest trial in your life. You might come from a split up home like I did. But I'm here to tell you, don't let the devil tell you you can't have a home that's not put together. Right. &gt;&gt; 19 years later, we're married and I'm here to tell you almost 19 years and we still have a home that loves God, that praises God, that come from a broke up home. And I made a commitment to God. I said, "If you give me a one woman filled with the Holy Ghost, Lord, I will serve you the rest of my life." And he did. He gave me a wonderful home that loves the Lord. But I'm here to tell you, protect your homeront. Protect your church. protect what God has given you in this house. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, he said, "What did Christ redeem us for?" He said, "What he did redeem us for?" He said, "Did you ever think what he redeemed us for?" He said, "Why didn't he just make the atonement and say now here there's here?" He said, "There's no need to giving them these powers." He said, "There's no need to making them sons this man a son of God. There's no need in doing that." The prophet of God says, "I'll just ask him to believe this and write in his name in the book of heaven and that will settle it." But he gave us this redeemed blessings that we might operate the work of God by the energy of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I never forget we were in Israel a couple years with the boys. I think it was a couple years ago and we were walking around Israel and and we went to uh we went there and we saw the uh what all the books and where they got killed and what was that called? I forgot the name of it but the Holocaust Museum. That's right. And we were there and I walked we were walking through there and I got to the last room and there was a books everywhere and and it was all the names that got killed in the Holocaust for and you see all these books and names and I started to weep and I started to think. I said, "You know what? But from the foundation of the world, my name was written in one of the books." I said, "From the foundation of the world, my name was written down. I just had to accept it." And I'm thankful tonight. We got to redeem. God has given you such great vineyard tonight. You might think, "Hey, I can have a better vineyard. I can have a better job." You know, the devil wants to say you can always have something better. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, there's nothing better than the message of the hour. There's nothing better than the book that's been revealed to us from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; I love it. I love it with all my heart. Another another place he says the prophet of God says he says he says someone will want want you to go here and and lead you at prayer meeting and then he's got a different idea from what really the Bible says, but he believes it this way anyhow. and he he'll start an influence and draw others away from it. He said the thing to do is is to protect this message. That's what the prophet of God said. He said the thing to do is to protect this message the way it's going straight right with it and knock everything away from it if we're ever going to cross the goal line. I love that. I underlined it. The thing to do is to protect this message. I'm here to tell you, I'm here to protect it with everything that's within me. Aren't you thankful tonight? &gt;&gt; I thought about Joshua 24 verse 14 through 15. It says, "Now therefore, fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and truth. Put away the gods which your fathers have served on the other side of the flood in Egypt and serve ye the Lord." Verse 15, this is it should be you. It says, "If it seem evil unto the unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers serve that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the Amorites and those and whose land you dwell. But as for me in my house, &gt;&gt; but for me in my house we will serve the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. Another place brother Ram goes on to say he said we may go through a lot of troubles and trials. I say amen. He said just remember there's someone who knows the lights the way and makes it real. &gt;&gt; He said I don't know what bring what what's behind the curtain but I know one thing. I'm pressing towards the mark of the high calling every day trying to live for the great event. every day trying to live for the great event that will take place, young people, that'll take place someday when I shall see him face to face and tell the story saved by his grace. That's the day I live for. That's the day you want to live for. &gt;&gt; It says leaving those things behind which are I want to press on, keep going on. That's like brother Bram talks about when he gets behind the curtain of time. He gets back and has to go back in that his body and he didn't want to and he didn't want to go back in that past house and they said keep pressing. Millions said keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on. I preached the same thing Paul preached. We're preaching the same thing the the Paul preached tonight. We are we are believing when we're all resting on that tonight. I would rather rest on that tonight, young people, than anything any denomination brings, any man-made ideas. I would rather rest on the word of God. &gt;&gt; If it says you can have the Holy Ghost, you can have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Too many kids in this day are well, I will go through prayer lines and and BYC and they'll come up and say, "Brother, I want the Holy Ghost." I said, "Well, God wants to give it to you more than the oceans through a pipe." The prophet of God talks about how how you how a fish does a fish have to ask sparingly for water. Just keep drinking. I'm here to tell you tonight, just keep drinking God's blessings and say, God, don't let the devil tell you you got the Holy Ghost one time and then you don't have it. &gt;&gt; You get the Holy Ghost and it you're se it says you're sealed until the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say he's an Indian giver. Our God, when he gives you the Holy Ghost, you are sealed. That doesn't mean you're going to fall. It doesn't mean you're going to fall and slip up. But I'm here to tell you, it'll make you get on your knees and say, "God, I'm forgive me." Or it'll make you go make it right to somebody. &gt;&gt; That's our holy that's the Holy Ghost that guides you in everything. He guides you. So young people, I'm here to tell you tonight to find get into Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Find your vineyard. The influence of another. He said, "When you're playing a ball game, when you're playing a ball game, as the magicians come," he says, "And when you're playing a ball game, as it's football season," I thought, "Wow." He said, "The thing you want to do is not everybody trying to take the ball away from the man that's got it." &gt;&gt; I thought, "Brother Ber," I thought, "Ain't that the truth? Isn't that the day we live in that we we got the ball or the pastor's got the ball and we're trying to rip it from his hands? We should be praying for him. &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest. We should be praying for the man of God that's protected this house, that's trying to build something here, &gt;&gt; not trying to rip the ball from each other. But I'm here to tell you, Prophet God said the thing we want to do is not everybody try to rip the ball away from the man that's got it. It It's trying to guard that man, protect him, let him get through. We're trying to make a goal. You see, &gt;&gt; I thought that was pretty good. He said, Robert God says, "But could you imagine a team so untrained so to find one man, their own man with the ball running down to the goal field, the field goal, and instead of trying to knock the enemy away from him, the opposing team to let one with their own man that's got to take the ball off with that with it, every man trying to take the ball out of his hand, why? You're bound to lose." &gt;&gt; I love it. Because that's how we live. We we live in a time that I want the ball. I want this. I want No. Just say, "God, fill me with the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Say, "God, you be my guard to guide tower. Pray for the man behind behind the scenes." &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "But could you imagine a team so untrained today? We had the same thing. When you see God come on the scene, he's going to bless a certain thing. Let's keep all the enemies away from it. &gt;&gt; Let us let us uh let let us use our influence as tackles, not runners. Tackles that protects the runner. Let us pack the ball through because there is no opposition. He said all you have to do is just to keep running and we should be the tackles. I tell you tonight, I want to be a tackle tonight. Everybody can't have a quarterback. That's what I'm here to tell you. You got the lineman. I guess you probably know football here, but I'm here to tell you, you got a quarterback and you got to protect them. And because if you don't protect them, they are going to get tackled. And I'm here to tell you to protect your vineyard tonight. If you believe the message of the hour and you everything that's within you, you protect it with all you got. &gt;&gt; May they play something softly tonight. &gt;&gt; May we just May we just think on that tonight? I hope that was okay. But May we protect this message with like he said may we protect it with all we got. If I could find that one more time what he said. He said this thing to do is to protect this message. [Music] I believe we're living in an hour that you should be protecting this message. They're trying to tear it out of this saying this way saying that way. I'm here to tell you if it doesn't line back up the Bible as Galatians 1:8 says, "If even an angel preaches another message, let him be accursed." You make sure everything lines back up through God's filter. Make sure everything lines up through his word. &gt;&gt; Make sure you protect your home. Make sure you protect your house. &gt;&gt; Apply the token to your family tonight. Apply it to your family, your grandchildren, your lost one tonight. Stop letting the devil beat you around and say, "Well, I can't have them." No, you can have your inheritance tonight. It was given to you. You It was freely given to you tonight. May that encourage you tonight. All heads bowed. Maybe look, just say, "Brother Chris, [Music] all these two services, they went by so quick." But maybe there's one person here tonight say, "Lord, fill me with the Holy Ghost. I've been away from my vineyard. I want to come back to you, Lord. I really want a real real experience." Oh, God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Oh, just be real, God. No one looking around. Say, God, I want a real real deep experience with you. Oh, you see these hands. Oh God, if it's just for one soul in this church, it was worth it all. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. God, refill us, Lord. Maybe someone say, "I'm tired. I've been weary. I'm worn out. God, will you stop by my house tonight and say, "Lord, would you refill me? Would you refill me? Lord, I'm burned out. I'm tired. I'm weary. May he just come right now in your juniper tree and fill you." So, God, I I really need my joy. I need everything back tonight. God bless you tonight. God bless you. [Music] However the Lord leads tonight, come forward. We can pray with you. If you have a need, whatever you have tonight, just as he sing a song, we invite you tonight. However the Lord leads as he sings tonight your presence fill us with your power. &gt;&gt; Oh let Lord let God do a leading tonight. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to live the way. I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give [Music] until there's just just no more to give. I want to love to love &gt;&gt; till there's just no more love.

Let's bow our heads. Father, Lord Jesus, we as we come to the close of a service again today, Lord, it's been so good to sing your songs, the hymns of I surrender all, Lord Jesus, and these different ones to hear your word going forth, Father, and encouraging us to press on. Press on. Keep pressing on. Amen. Fight the battle. fight the good fight of faith, Lord. And certainly we are doing that, Lord. And we just thank you for this date that you have given us. Thank you for every soul, Lord Jesus, that's in here, Father. Thank you for every brother, every sister, Lord. We need one another. We love one another, God. And we pray that you would bind us that much closer together, Father, as we see the day approaching, Lord Jesus. Go with us to our different places tonight and our jobs tomorrow, Lord. We ask God that your presence would be just with us wherever we are and that we would come back at the appointed time again in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Take the name of Jesus with you. Amen. Take the name of Jesus with you, child of sorrow and of woe. [Music] And it will joy and comfort give you. Take it then where you go. Oh precious name.
