========================================

All right. Given by his mercy, spiritual well-being. Blessed refers to a spiritual state of inner happiness, joy, and contentment that is not dependent upon material wealth or positive circumstances. Inner satisfaction in God. True spiritual blessing means being fully satisfied in God alone. Amen. I'm here to tell you, I'm going to tell you again. I'm here to tell you that if you haven't got God in your heart and you're not satisfied with your relationship with God, you won't be happy with your wife. You won't be happy with your husband. You won't be happy with your job. You won't be happy with your dog. You won't be happy with your cat. You just won't be happy. Why? Because you haven't got that inner happiness. Amen. The proud pastor, he's just not good enough. The preacher ain't good enough. The church ain't good enough. The deacon ain't good enough. Trustees ain't good enough. Hello. Just total no satisfaction. But brother preach, he says, "Man, you find such a discontent. People everywhere are not satisfied." I'm here to tell you, if you have a car and you have the Amen and you have a car and you you know you don't know nothing about the mechanics, you don't even know you're supposed to put gas in it, you're going to have problems down the road. It helps to know something about what it is. And how many know is that people don't know what you are made for? We were not made to be empty. Our heart was made to be filled. You and I, we need satisfaction. Everybody needs satisfaction. Amen. But praise be to God. We understand. Amen. That if your car don't start, get out there, pop the hood. Amen. Wiggle that positive wire a little bit. Make sure that it's connected good. Amen. Make it was loosened. Tighten that thing up. And boom, here we go. That's where with your life, if it ain't turning the way that it to if you ain't got joy unspeakable. I like that song. Brother David said, "Well, I found his grace is all complete. It supplies my every need. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory. Full of glory. Amen. How many blows? It flows." Amen. It just flows. Amen. God wants you to have joy unspeakable and full of glory. Amen. David, he got so so much of God. Amen. He says, "My cup is full and it's running over." How many believe that with what you got, with what I got, our cups ought to be full this morning. It ought to be running over a little bit. That's right. If it ain't, it ain't God's fault. He's got us plenty to drink. He's got us plenty to eat. If you ain't eating and you ain't drinking the way you ought to, you that spiritual deprived person, that hungry person, not getting nothing out of the service, why don't you repent? Why don't you fix that problem? Get right to where you come to church. Amen. You pull from the gift of God. You go out a better person to what you come in. We sing that song, count your blessings. Name them one by one. Hey, count your blessings. I'm here to tell you that when you start counting your blessings, you will give God glory and praise and thanks. You won't have time to complain. &gt;&gt; You won't have time to You'll be too busy counting some more blessing.
