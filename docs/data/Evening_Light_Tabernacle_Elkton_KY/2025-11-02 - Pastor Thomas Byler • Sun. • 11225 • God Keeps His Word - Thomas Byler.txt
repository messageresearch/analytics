Oh, [singing] it's [music] already come. For [singing] the battle is over. The victory is [music] won [singing] and it's already done. Amen. If you could just continue to play that softly. You may have your seats. Brother Danny, Brother Michael, John, Brother Paul, if you'd come for the offering this morning. Amen. We have a number of prayer requests. Amen. Brother David asked if we would remember a friend [music] of his, Josh, who's his friend, Matthew Pierce, took his life. So, just remember them [music] in this time for the family's grieving and said it hit him pretty hard. So, we also want to remember sister Janette. She asked, "Will you please remember me in prayer on Wednesday, I have to go to St. Thomas West for a night hard cath?" So, we want to remember her this coming Wednesday. And also, Sister Alicia's dad, Gary, is going to Louisville for a surgery this week. So, we want to remember him. Amen. I believe Brother Brad has some requests as well. Amen. We serve a big mighty God. And you know the prophet, we've been taught, the world's not taught this, but we've been taught that if we'll just believe, not even cancer can [music] stand in the way. How many believes that this morning? We have some these needs and some more. We want to remember uh Austin's girls and [music] and they're still it's been a week and they've just really been sick and and any of you has ever raised small children, you know, that's no fun and stressful and so just remember them. I think they they tested for for flu. So, uh, we definitely want you to [music] to remember them and hold them up. Brother Joe's not feeling well this morning. And the other need that we have is, uh, you know, many of us know, brother Nathan and sister Tracy Ball, their daughter McCagan Pascal. She's carrying, uh, twins. And the doctor's not giving her a report that that we agree with. And so, they've they've asked us to remember them in prayer. Brother Nathan, he texts [music] and called or texts and I talked to him the other day and and they're they're carrying identical twins and what's going on is one of the one of the twins is just not growing at the same rate. Well, the doctors at Vanderbilt who are supposed to be the best, they just encouraged her to abort one. [music] They don't want to do that. We're not going to do that. And so they want us to bind our faith and and bind our our spirits together and believe as she's going to be traveling to Cincinnati in the morning. They decided to go to a different doctor and just didn't want to accept that report. So they're going to Cincinnati and the doctors at Cincinnati are need to do some measurements [music] and take some uh uh readings and stuff to see if they can do I think it's called a infant transplant maybe. And uh it's it's a procedure I'm not familiar with, but it's a very delicate, very serious procedure. And she's got to meet certain requirements those babies do for them to be able to do that. So they need your prayers. And if if cancer won't stand in the way of our God, neither can this. So we're just going to bind our faith this morning. We're going to believe with each other. So how many has a need? While you're sitting there this morning with your neighbor, just just won't you just lay hands on your neighbor and as I pray, we're just all going to pray and believe for this [music] need and each need that was brought before the Lord, unspoken and spoken. So, let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning, Lord. Lord, we we we just bow our hearts humbly before you, Lord, knowing that you're the God of all, that you're a God of all creation, that you're the creator, you're the maker. Father, you you know our needs before we even know our needs. And you've heard the needs of the people. You heard the need of the family that's grieving this morning over the loss of a loved one who apparently just couldn't handle the pressures, Lord. And we know we're in a pressure a pressure cooker in this world we live in. But Father, we know that you're more than able to meet the needs, Lord. So, go to that grieving family this morning. and you heard the needs of our sisters and [music] uh sister Janette that has to go to the specialist in the morning and just needs a a sincere touch from you, Father. That you would present yourself as healer to her that you would just uh lead and guide the doctors to direct that all things could be [music] treatments would be to just give her comfort, Lord Jesus, and and help her in this time, Lord. Lord, we just ask, Father, that you would just meet each and every one of those needs, [music] Lord. the other ones that's been mentioned with with the the little uh sailor and haven and serenity not feeling well. And we just ask Lord that we're ready to to just kick the devil out and say enough's enough. And that's what we've been taught that when when there comes a certain point, God will allow Satan to do so much, but when it's enough, it's enough. And God steps in. So Lord, we're calling on you to step in on that this morning. And Lord, for the the babies that are being carried and [music] by McCagan, Lord, and such a such a important need, Lord Jesus, that you would just go and minister to that [music] uh body, Lord Jesus. And Lord, we we don't understand. We don't know. We don't know why things happen the way they do, but we know that you're in control and you have the answers, Lord. So, we trust and we believe and we bind our faith and we lay hands on one another because we all have needs. And so [music] with the with the with the lick of fire that we have bound together, Lord, it's just a blazing bonfire, Lord. And we call upon you and ask that you would move in that need in a very special way. That you would just lead and guide and direct the doctors and the surgeons that'll be uh overlooking this case and be trying to figure out how can we how can they save these babies? And Lord, we just ask Lord as we commit it into your hands that you will take control of the doctor's minds, their hands, and their thoughts [music] and show them. show them what will fix the situation, Father. And we'll give praise and we'll give thanks for the positive testimonies, Lord, that come out of this. We love you, Lord. We ask, Lord, that you would bless this offering now as the [music] people give and they give back to you at this time. That the offering would just be to bring glory to you and to further your kingdom. Father, we love you and give you praise and glory and thank you for all that you do in Jesus [music] name. Amen. It's already done. It's over. Battle [singing] is over. [music] Is one. [singing] It's already done. I'm already healed. Oh, I'm already [music and singing] healed. here and I'm [singing and music] already here. The battle is over. The victory [music] is [singing] won. It's already done. Amen. You are great. You do miracles so great. [clears throat] Amen. You deserve the glory and the honor. Lord, we lift our hands in worship as we praise your holy name.

Oh, for it reaches to the highest mountain [singing] and it flows to the lowest valley. The blood that gives me [singing] strength from day to day.

That's right. I don't know why I thought of that, but all right. Just have a seat a minute. Let's sing happy birthday to everybody that has a birthday in this month. Amen. had two birthdays and anniversaries. I usually forget [music] that. For some reason when I come out this morning, it popped in my head. Amen. I don't know what it is. All right. Praise the Lord. Amen. How many's happy this morning? &gt;&gt; First, I want to just uh thank everybody and say for the work that you did yesterday, bravo. Bravo. God bless you. Thank you for everything everybody did yesterday. [applause] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. It was very well. I was thinking, you know, uh boy, I sure am glad that God has put together in the body as according to first Corinthians there. Amen. Different administrations and helps and so forth and how that when everybody does their part, it just works so good together for good. Amen. And me and my wife, there's very little that we have to do. And so, we really appreciate that. Amen. So, God bless you. It's just great. Amen. Oh, that's a happy birthday to you. A happy birthday [singing] to you. May you feel Jesus, [music and singing] dear every day of the year. A happy birthday [singing] to you.

I know Brad and Joyce did. They got married on opening day, I think. Amen. I won't forget that. So, anyway, we're happy for them. Many years God has blessed them with. Amen. Praise the Lord. How many's glad for marriages? Amen. [music] That God keeps together and that God puts together. Amen. Amen. Brother Michael and Sister Daisy, a [music] happy anniversary to you. A happy [singing] anniversary to you. May you [music] feel Jesus near every day of the year. A happy anniversary [music and singing] to you. A happy anniversary to you and [singing] the best one you've ever had. Happy anniversary, y'all. [applause] Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Certainly is good to be in the house of the Lord and be led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just be seated for a minute. I want to make an announcement this morning. Amen. That after about 34 years of doing things a certain way. I've kind of had it on my heart. Amen. A little bit about making some changes in the way that we do things. Amen. And so I talked to the board about it and they're okay if they they're okay with it if I feel let to go this way. And so uh I want to just uh maybe talk to you about the changes we'd like to make. Amen. For one thing, I know that when we get here many times, Amen. if we're 30 minutes early, uh that's around 10:00 and then a lot of times before we ever get to the preaching, it could be almost an hour and a half later. Amen. So, Amen. And I know we can maybe narrow that down a little bit uh to where perhaps we'll have more time for the ministering of the word. Um so what I'd like to do is change our service uh Sunday school the way that we do our kids children's Sunday school. And uh hopefully if I don't make myself clear and somebody gets a question about this, don't be afraid to ask me after service. Okay? But uh if the parents of the children that have Sunday school, if you could be here by 10 after 10, 10 after 10 or maybe a little before that, 5 after 10. We're supposed to be here 30 minutes early, right? So I should say let's be here at 10:00 if we possibly can. And let's have our children's Sunday school class starts at 10 after 10 and dismiss at 25 after 10. Amen. That gives you five minutes for everybody to come in here and sit down. Amen. And begin for the worship service. Amen. And I would like for our pre-ervice music to start around 20 after. Amen. Right. I'd like to have that maybe start about 20 after as we usually do. Amen. When we don't have Sunday school or like on the on the first Sunday of the month, I believe it was. But uh so be dismissed. And then also by doing this, by having three Sunday school classes going out there or Yeah, there's three of them. Uh when we come in, Amen. we're going to have to cut out our previsiting noise, pre-ervice visiting. Okay? Because we don't want a lot of people out there talking and everything else like that. Amen. When their teachers are trying to teach something. Does that make sense? Amen. So, let's fellowship afterwards if we can. So, we'll come in here very quietly, very reverently. Amen. And uh uh that way it's just a real atmosphere. And like I told some of the board, I'd like for we want to create a real good atmosphere when we come up when we start service. I always like for the song leaders, of course, they're they can do as they feel led, but I like when I come up is to pick up on whatever song's being sent sung by Sister Becky or whatever and just enter into a real deep sincere worship right off the go get. Amen. And then uh maybe have a song or something or song or two or whatever it might be. Uh, now this this is one part that I haven't really uh got exactly clear in the way that we're going to do it yet, but I do know we have Bible reading. We have Bible reading. Uh, usually have Bible reading up here. And we'll and if the musicians are already up here, we don't want them to all go back down just for the Bible reading. So maybe we'll have to have Brother Troy or whoever does the Bible to have go back there and make sure that they know exactly where you're going to be at. so that we can put on the screen so that our musicians can actually either just look on there or bring their Bible up and read along with the scriptures. So, we won't cut that out, but I'd like to maybe cut out completely the adult Sunday school class. Okay? No, no adult Sunday school class. Amen. So, I talked to Brother Brian about this because this is something he's done for a very long time and he's done well and we appreciate all he has done. How many appreciates, Brother Brian? Amen. That's God bless you, brother Brian. We love Brother Brian. [applause] Amen. Brother B. Brother Brian's been a right-hand mind of mine. Amen. As far as Amen. Being a pillar of the church here, him and sisters are in that boat. And we really, really appreciate him. Amen. And I'll tell you what, I'll go to any battle any day with that soldier right there. Amen. He never He don't leave you nor does he forsake you. We appreciate him. Amen. But anyway, so I felt like maybe we might make these changes. Would that sound okay with everybody? and just so that our worship service comes up and then the you know all of our Sunday school is done by 25 after 10. Amen. For the little children, the younger kids and so forth. Um so anyway, let me see here. That's right. I can't think of anything else right now. So the the teachers of course be at your post and then have your children just come in and like like I said 10 after or so. Amen. Just go in there to the Sunday school and do that. Amen. Praise the Lord. And also so that's all for that. I want to also uh thank the church. Amen. I didn't go back brother John and look at your uh text but I think the total amount that we have paid for Amen. the rock back there on behind the fellowship hall was around 15,700 somewhere in there. Amen. And last week we had around 6,700. Amen. And we got all that we needed right to the penny of what we needed to pay the rock. So let's give the Lord a hand for providing for that. [applause] Amen. Amen. Uh I've got a number on the church. Amen. from Dwayne Dead Light Dead Dwayne Dead Wallard. This is a little tongue twister, but anyway, he give me a price on the roof. Now, brother Brad, I don't know if you've got prices, but sometime if you have prices, Amen. We'll bring that before the church. But right now, we're standing at $30,000 for a shingle roof to be put back. 37,000 for a just your lowgrade metal, you know, and he didn't really recommend that because of screws that like to back out. If you go with metal, it's best to go with the self-standing. Amen. The very good stuff, which A mean you'll never have to deal with a roofing again. Amen. And you can fix that, I guess, in just portions or or whatever if you needed to. But that is $57,000. So, I don't know. You know, we're I'm going to talk to the board about it. Amen. And we're going to see what they think about it. And then we'll I guess ask y'all, you know, or get some of y'all's input. Do we want to go with another? Because it's lasted around 25 thou 25,000. 25 years. Amen. We're not in heaven yet, but around 25 years, I guess it was, Brother Ryan. Right. Pretty close to it. Anyway, that these shingles have lasted. So, Amen. As a lot of us won't have to worry about putting another roof on if we go ahead with the cheaper one, have it throw it on. Amen. And let u you know, Woody's kids worry about it later on. But anyway, uh so I I kind of lean towards that. I kind of lean towards just doing a single again. But if y'all want a really expensive roof, I guess all of us are going to be paying for it. So, uh we'll just decide and we'll also just bring it before the board. Micah and Austin sitting back there, they have said that they would be a trustee. The board said they're all for it. Y'all like that idea? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I don't know if I'll wait till the first of the year. I guess I might wait till the next voting in January, which is just about two months away. I was just going to do it right away, but I'll just ask the Lord what he wants me to do on that because we could definitely use a couple more trustees. Amen. So, we appreciate them. Amen. Doing that. God bless you richly. Amen. For helping in that way. And that's all I can think of for now. Let's stand and go before the Lord in prayer. Amen. and pray. Certainly enjoyed the message Wednesday. He'll be taking this coming Wednesday again and then in the next week or so, brother Pedley will be with us and also brother. Yeah. Thank you, brother Andrew. Brother Andrew is going to be back on a Wednesday night here in a couple of weeks also. So, we're looking forward to that. Amen. Hopefully, you haven't been so busy now that you haven't had time to pray. Amen. Because how many knows that this is the most important part, amen, of our lives right here is the word of God. Amen. So, let's bow our heads before the master, Lord Jesus, as we come before you. Bowing our heads, Lord Jesus, in humble reverence and respect, Father, to you. And Lord Jesus, so standing in awe of you, Lord Jesus, desiring, Lord Jesus, that you'll continue to lead the church here, Father. Lead each one, Father, by your spirit, by your angel. We ask God that you just help us, Lord Jesus, to surrender to you now, Lord, this morning in a special way and help us to deliver what you feel. We feel God, you've laid upon our hearts to minister, Lord Jesus. Give us the ability that only you can give, Lord Jesus. Come and speak, Lord Jesus. You be the speaker this morning, Father. Be in the ears of the hearers, Lord Jesus. And we ask God that you just bless the port this portion of the service now as we commit it to you and the reading of the word in Jesus' name. And everybody said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Turn your Bibles if you will. Amen. And we think we will go to Isaiah. Let's go to Isaiah if we could. Amen. Amen. I really enjoyed the Lord laying that on my heart last week. the conflict between God and Satan. Amen. And I'm still just hardly can get away from it. And so I may end up Amen. speaking on it just a little bit again, tying it in with today a little bit. But Isaiah 55. Isaiah 55. My message this morning is going to be called God keeps his word. God keeps his word. Amen. His promises. I mean, he believes that God keeps his promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe he was said that. Amen. When he went to deliver Israel from Egypt, I remember my promise. I remember my covenant that I've made with you. Amen. I believe over another place in Malachi. Amen. In Malachi, he said something to the extent. He says, "They that feared the Lord spake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it in a book of remembrance." Amen. Was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name. And they shall be mine, sayaeth the Lord of hosts, in the day. Amen. When I make up my jewels, I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. Amen. Amen. I just now think of that song. Amen. When my savior calls, Amen. I will answer. When he calls for me, I will hear. Amen. How many believes that God's going to do that one of these days? He's going to remember. He ain't going to forget his promises. Amen. Amen. And so, we really appreciate the Lord. I do not know what I would do if it wasn't as brother Brandham even said be for being able to be a Christian. Amen. How blessed we are. Isaiah 55 and verse 7. Let's go with verse six. Seek ye the Lord while he may be found. Call upon him while he is near. Amen. Boy, don't the world need to hear that right about now? Because how many knows the time is coming when they'll call and I won't answer. They'll plead, they'll pray, but I won't hear. He'll laugh at their calamity because when he did call, they would not answer. When he reached out his hand, he would not hear. So my I don't know if there would be anybody out there listening to this or not. Amen. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abandonedly pardon. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, and neither are my ways your ways, sayeth the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow of heaven, and returneth not thither, but waterth the earth, and maketh it to bring forth, and bud that it may give seed to the sewer, and bread to, so shall my word be, that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing that I whereto I shall send it. Amen. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated. Amen. Jesus himself, I believe he said that heavens and earth shall pass away, but my word shall never pass away. If you'll listen to uh if you'll listen to that about six different messages brother Brandham preached on God keeps God keeps his word you'll find that brother Brandham really uh was was was being led of God to come against uh some emotional uh things and emotion and uh things like the people that were supposedly had blood in their hands and so forth and Amen. They'd lay their hands on the people and so forth and talked about that blood would heal the nations. There's things like that and and oil that would come forth from of them. And he was really blasting at saying that's not of God. Amen. And it's causing it's going to cause the church to be confused and it's going to cause them to tear it to be torn apart. And he says, you know, and the reason that people falling for it, he says, and he said, you preachers that are not preaching the gospel, if you won't feed them right food, amen, they're hungry people. He said they'll eat out of a garbage can or they'll eat garbage basically. Hello. So, he was speaking on that and he was saying he makes the statement. Amen. He made a statement and I didn't realize I might go there, but Amen. I'm going to go ahead and pull it up if I can. Amen. &gt;&gt; [clears throat and cough] &gt;&gt; He says, he makes a statement in it. He says, "Listen, brother." He says, "You're never saved by any sign. You're not saved by any sensation. You are saved when you meet God's conditions of his word." Amen. And nothing else, he said, "Are you saved by?" That's right. God's word has made a way. You're not saved because you feel like you're saved. I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved because a lot of times I don't feel that way. I'm saved because God gave a promise and I met God's promise and upon God's holy word, I can defeat Satan seven days in a week and as many nights because the word is God's word. Amen. So, how many believe this morning there's nothing as powerful? There's nothing that'll ever substitute amen your strength AND YOUR FAITH IN GOD'S WORD. AMEN. To overcome the enemy with than simply believing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Simply believing his word. Amen. Praise the Lord. So this morning, I want to begin to think about this and I really want to tie about three different message or thoughts together this morning if I can. Amen. So first of all, WE REALIZE THAT GOD KEEPS HIS WORD. AMEN. And God's thoughts, AMEN. AND OUR thoughts are so different. I BELIEVE PAUL EXPRESSED IT PRETTY GOOD IN ROMANS. I BELIEVE it was when he said that the carnal mind is emnity against Christ. It's not subject to God. Neither can be. In other words, Amen. Your your natural carnal thought. AMEN. IT'S GOING TO GO the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; SO, WE NEED GOD'S THOUGHTS. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT to try to share. AMEN. IS GOD'S THOUGHTS, NOT OUR THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I believe one place he said Israel erred BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW GOD'S WAYS. They didn't, you know, how many believes if you're ever going to understand somebody, it's important that you understand the way that he thinks, &gt;&gt; the way that God thinks. Otherwise, you're going to miss the mark. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. how how important how important it is this morning. Amen. To have the Holy Spirit. Amen. Brother Bam TALKED ABOUT IT'S SO NECESSARY to have the Holy Spirit. Amen. Because uh you know, and before I say that, remember this is talking about the mind of God. Now, how many believe that we should have the mind of God? Because Paul said we should have the mind of God. We should be able to think the way that God thinks. Amen. Amen. And the only way that we can really do that is by the new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. That by the BAPTISM OF THE HOLY Spirit in our hearts. &gt;&gt; It's the only way you're going to BE ABLE TO THINK THE WAY THAT GOD THINKS. And it's a higher thought, man. It's so much higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? When when you think that it's absolutely impossible, can't be done. Well, guess what? That might be what you think as A NATURAL MAN, BUT God said, "IF THOU CAN'T BELIEVE, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. NOTHING SHALL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO THEM THAT BELIEVE." &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SEES THAT THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER THOUGHT THERE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. There's many questions in this life. Many questions that there is. AND YOU KNOW, I have a I HAVE A QUESTION to kind of ask you all this morning. And I think you might have heard this phrase before. AMEN. BUT HOW do you get the correct answer to something? How do you get the correct answer to something? Amen. Pretty good. Anybody got the answer? Well, my answer is by asking the right question. &gt;&gt; By asking the right question. Because if you don't ask the right question, you won't get the right answer. Now, how many knows we're going to start here with Eve. God had told her that the day that you eat thereof, that day you shall die. And what did THE DEVIL SAY? YAY. GOD HAD SAID, but Amen. SHE WHAT? SHE QUESTIONED. BUT said she questioned whether God would keep his word. &gt;&gt; See, the devil gave her a different answer, didn't he? HE GAVE HER THE wrong answer. Give her the wrong ANSWER AND SHE NEEDED TO GO BACK TO THE RIGHT QUESTION. IF SHE'D HAVE STAYED WITH THE RIGHT QUESTION, AMEN. SHE'D HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT. BUT SHE BEGAN TO YOU KNOW SHE SHOULD HAVE SAID LOOK AND SHE EVEN MENTIONED IT. GOD HAS SAID HOW MANY KNOW THAT'S WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH. AMEN. THAT IS GOD HAS SAID THIS. WHAT DID GOD SAY? HE SAID THAT THOU SHALT SURELY DIE. THOU SHALT SURELY DIE IS THE CORRECT ANSWER. NOT YOU'RE NOT SURELY. GOD KNOWS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE HIM, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL. THOU SHALT NOT SURELY DIE. Gave her the wrong answer. You know, IT KIND OF REMINDED ME OF THE HOUR THAT YOU AND I ARE living in. The devil IS GIVING THEM BOTH THE WRONG QUESTION AND THE WRONG ANSWER. WHAT IS THE QUESTION OUT THERE NOWADAYS? NOWADAYS THE QUESTION IS can a man have a baby that's first of all it's a wrong question you know AND IT'S GOT A WRONG ANSWER can you imagine come on people I don't care if our politicians hear this this morning or not BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE UP THERE THAT'LL SAY WHY SURE absolutely light. And you know, it's the most deceiving, conniving question and answer I've ever heard. Amen. Because the only way THAT A MAN COULD, AND that's the way that they think because they've accepted the devil's answer, the only WAY THAT A SO TO SPEAK MAN COULD HAVE A baby is if a woman CHOOSES TO BE IDENTIFIED AS A MAN. &gt;&gt; She could have a baby, couldn't she? &gt;&gt; YEAH, SURE. BECAUSE SHE I SAID IDENTIFIES I DIDN'T SAY SHE WAS I SAID SHE IDENTIFIES AS A MAN. SO THEY GO UP THERE AND OUR POLITICIANS ASK THEM HEY CAN A MAN HAVE A BABY and they'll say yeah and I'm LIKE MIGRATION LET'S GO BACK TO THE RIGHT QUESTION. Let me TELL YOU WHAT THE RIGHT QUESTION IS. I LIKE THE QUESTION THEY'LL ASK HIM. HOW MANY GENDERS ARE THERE? [screaming] YEAH. TALK TO ME. GIVE ME THE RIGHT QUESTION AND WE'LL GET THE RIGHT QUESTION. WHY? BECAUSE LET EVERY MAN'S WORD BE [screaming] A LIE AND MIND THE TRUTH. AMEN. IN THE BEGINNING, HE MADE MALE AND HE MADE FEMALE. HE MADE MAN AND HE WILL MADE A WOMAN. [applause] That's the right answer. And there IS NO OTHER ANSWER. EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE DEVIL'S ANSWER. AMEN. AND IT BRINGS CONFUSION &gt;&gt; AND DEATH BECAUSE IT'S A LIE. HOW MANY KNOW THAT'S A LIE TO THINK A MAN CAN DO IT? AMEN. Man can do it. I want to see this. Never going to happen from what I understand. If you ever did, you sisters thought you'd never want to have a second one. Pretty bad stuff. But we know better than that. Ain't that right? But that's an example, isn't that a good example of HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT GOD KEEPS HIS WORD this morning? OH MY. THAT'S THAT'S JUST MY WHOLE MESSAGE right there. GOD DOES WHAT HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DO. IF YOU PUT YOUR TRUST IN GOD, GOD WILL KEEP HIS WORD. [applause] THE THREE HEBREW CHILDREN, THEY PUT THEIR TRUST IN GOD. BLESSED HE IS HE THAT PUTTETH HIS TRUST AND FAITH IN ALMIGHTY GOD CUZ HE COMES ON THE SCENE. HE CAN'T FAIL. &gt;&gt; BUT BAM SAYS, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T ALWAYS KEEP OUR WORD. WE NEED TO KEEP OUR WORD IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. BUT WE'RE HUMANS. WE'RE FALLIBLE. YOU MIGHT BE DEAD BEFORE YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PROMISE TOMORROW. AMEN. SO SOMETIME WE CAN'T. BUT GOD [screaming] HAS TO KEEP HIS WORD. HE DOES KEEP HIS WORD. IT CANNOT COME BACK FOR IT. IT'S GOING TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE SAID. So much so, AMEN, THAT WHENEVER THE PHARISEES WANTED THEM TO SHUT UP, SHUT UP AND NOT HALLELUJAH AND PRAISE GOD, HOSANA TO HIM THAT COMETH ON, HE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE SAYS, MAN, IF THEY SHUT UP, [screaming] THE ROCKS WILL IMMEDIATELY CRY OUT CUZ MY WORD WILL NOT COME BACK VOID. AMEN. Isn't that where our hope is, our confidence is this morning? &gt;&gt; That God keeps his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Let me go back on this a little bit. Talking about how many believes that we've got the we've got the answer to the devil's question. &gt;&gt; Amen. The right question that people in our generation need to be asking is ONE OF THEM IS WHERE DID WE COME FROM? BECAUSE THEY'RE believing that we CAME FROM A TADPOLE AND EVOLVED. NO, THAT'S NOT WHERE WE COME FROM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. How many believes IN THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHERE WE COME FROM. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW WHERE WE COME FROM. EVENING LIKE TABERNACLE, [screaming] YOU'RE NOT A HYBRID. YOU'RE NOT A MIX BETWEEN A A HORSE AND A JACKASS OR A A DONKEY, I GUESS IT IS. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF MULES. &gt;&gt; NO, WE KNOW WHO WE ARE. [screaming] WE KNOW WHERE WE COME FROM. WE KNOW WHAT OUR PURPOSE IS HERE. THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN ASK. AMEN. ALMIGHTY GOD, DOES GOD KEEP HIS WORD? YES, HE DOES. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE THAT BROUGHT US HERE. AS BROTHER BENAM SAID, YOU KNOW, IT'S SO IMPORTANT WE IT WOULD PAY US. AMEN. IF WE SAT DOWN AND [screaming] ASK WHERE WE COME FROM, WHO BROUGHT US HERE? WHO BROUGHT US HERE? AND THE SECONDLY IS WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR? HOW MANY BELIEVES EVERY ONE OF YOU SITTING THERE? NO, WE CAN'T [screaming] ALL BE PREACHERS. WE ALL CAN'T BE THE PREACHER. BUT YOU'VE GOT A MINISTRY. YOU GOT SOMETHING THAT GOD'S GOT YOU TO DO. WE ALL DO ALL WANT TO FIND [screaming] THAT PLACE AND DO WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO AND BE HAPPY RIGHT THERE. I DON'T CARE WHAT it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a terrible thing to question God's word. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing. Eve did it. A lot of people down through time did it. Samson did it. Huh? You know how brother Bam said that told the story of these carriage drivers. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And they could go around this mountain, this very cliffy mountain. And this one said, "Man, I can go at full gallop and I can come within an inch of the edge." Wow. Really? Full gallop them four horses just to get it. The other one said, "Well, I can't quite do that. I stay about five or six inches away from the edge, but I can do almost as good." Ain't that right? Oh, wow. That's pretty cool. The other one said, "You know, I might be able to do that, but I hug inside just as hard as I can." &gt;&gt; He says, "You're hired. I want you." &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes THAT'S THE WAY WE ought to be with our lives? That's how you OUGHT TO BE WITH YOUR PHONES, WITH YOUR INTERNET. Just stay as far away from that edge as you possibly can. THAT'S RIGHT. STAY CLOSE TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. Stay close to God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOLLOW THE HOLY SPIRIT. WE NEED IT MORE THAN EVER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAMSON, HE CAME OUT CLOSE TO THE EDGE. HE JUST WALLOWED RIGHT THERE ON THE EDGE. Remember all THE TIME SHE'D ASK HIM NOW, "WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? WHAT YOU AND HE GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER AND CLOSER TILL ONE TIME HE SAYS YOU KNOW IT ISN'T really going to matter if I really tell her cuz if he wouldn't have questioned he'd realize what had happened he's going to get his eyes gouged out and he's going to become a slave and he'll going to have no power he's not going to be no hero no more huh that's right if you thought about it and he questioned how maybe God won't or whatever but what did God do THAT'S RIGHT HE LOST HIS POWER WHY BECAUSE HE GOT OUT FROM BEHIND THE PROTECTION OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. God help us to believe everything God has said. God keeps his word. Amen. Don't question it. Praise the Lord. Eve found out, didn't she? Adam found out. Amen. when they thought that God wouldn't keep his word. Brother Bram said, I don't think I quote printed it out, but he says, "A minister comes up here and begins to preach the word." First of all, let me say this. How many believes that us preachers, we got to be up here for the right reason? Brother B said, "No selfish motive will work. If we're up here to impress you or to be a somebody or we're here for money or popularity, if you're here for the wrong reason, it will not be blessed. &gt;&gt; God won't bless it." No, you got to be here for the right reason. Doing it for the right reason. He was saying, you know, it might come into that preacher's mind. Well, now, you know, there's a heavy tithe pay or whatever. So, you know, he might be offended and quit if I preach this. I mean, know, sure. Sure. Every one of us, even us preachers got to be up here and we got to fight off that carnal thought. We got to get rid of our carnal mind and let the Holy Spirit speak. &gt;&gt; Preach the word. LET THE CHIPS FALL where they may. I hope I WAS THINKING LAST WEEK, I HOPE, AMEN. THAT GOD CAN USE ME IN SUCH A WAY. AMEN. THAT I'LL SPEAK PAST YOUR FLESH. AMEN. PEACE. SPEAK PAST YOUR SPIRIT. AMEN. AND SPEAK ALL [screaming] THE WAY TO YOUR SOUL. Cuz I guarantee you, AMEN. WE SAY THAT WE SAY THAT WORD OF GOD KEEPS HIS WORD ALL THE WAY FROM GENESIS TO REVELATION. HIS WORD IS YAY. [screaming] HIS WORD IS TRUTH. HOW MANY BELIEVES, I AM THE WAY. I AM THE TRUTH. I AM THE LIFE IS WHAT JESUS SAID. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT SPEAKS TO OUR SOULS. WHEN WE SAY WE'RE GETTING READY FOR A TRANSLATION, WE SAY, "AMEN, BROTHER. WE'RE LETTING [screaming] GOD WORK ON US." AMEN. THOUGH TRIALS MAY COME. AMEN. THOUGH PRESSURE MAY COME. AMEN. LIKE A AMEN. LIKE THE EIFFEL TOWER UP ON THE TOP OF AMEN. A SUGAR CUBES CRUSHING US DOWN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WOO! GLORY. [screaming] IT AIN'T GOING TO CRUSH US. NO. IT'LL CRUSH THE OLD MAN OUT. IT'LL CAUSE YOU TO BE THE DEAD, BUT BRING FORTH PURE GOLD. IT'LL P BRING FORTH REAL DIAMOND. &gt;&gt; IT'LL BRING FORTH WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BRING FORTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; How many believes we just can't do anything without Christ? And he gets all the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. I WITHOUT ME, JESUS SAID, YOU CAN DO NOTHING. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING WITHIN OURSELVES, WE GET IN TROUBLE. EVE THOUGHT SHE'D HAVE MORE REVELATION, MORE LIGHT. When you question God, let me say this. You think that you know more about it than God does. God help us take our thoughts away. &gt;&gt; Well, God's word says this, but I do this or that or the other. Well, hey, you're thinking that you know more about it than God. Amen. Praise the Lord. Some questions. I'm going to go over this for just a little bit. Questions. Amen. About where we come from. what our purpose is here to fulfill his plan. How many be that's important? That's so important to understand what we're here for. When I was younger out in the world, didn't know who I was, didn't know what I belonged to, Irvin and Marson remember me a little bit back then. That's right. Long hair. I don't know if hippie, rock and roll, all of that mess. Thought maybe that's what I was. But I thank God one day I realized that's not what I am. THAT'S NOT [screaming] WHO I AM. [applause] There's something IN HERE TELLING ME I'M SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I'M NOT JUST LOST. I'M NOT JUST MAN, WHAT IS RIGHT? DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. NO. I KNEW THERE'S a leader somewhere. THERE'S A GUIDE SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A VOID IN HERE THAT I WANT FILLED. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A HUNGER AND A THIRST THAT GOD PUT IN THERE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS THAT THAT'S THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD? CUZ EVEN BROTHER BAM SAYS, "AIN'T NOBODY EVER SEEKS GOD. IT'S ALWAYS GOD SEEKING MAN." SO IF YOU HAVE A DESIRE FOR GOD, IF YOU HAVE A THIRST FOR GOD, YOU THANK GOD FOR THAT LITTLE THIRST. If you're not content with the world, you're not content with how you are. You're not content with the walk that you have with Christ right now and you say, "I want a deeper walk. I want a closer walk." Cuz brother Bam said an 80-year-old lady in a man, amen, THEIR HEART'S DESIRE WAS A CLOSER WALK WITH GOD. HOW MANY IS WITH ME THIS MORNING? THAT'S WHAT WE DESIRE ABOVE [screaming] EVERYTHING IS A CLOSER WALK WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. UNTIL ONE DAY, BROTHER BRAD. AMEN. WE'RE NOT JUST BE HAVE A CLOSE WALK HERE. AMEN. BUT WE'RE ALL GOING TO WALK WITH HIM SIDE BY SIDE. WE'RE GOING TO STAND BY HIS SIDE. WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH HIM. We're going to be like him. &gt;&gt; That is our heart's desire. That is our passion is to be more like him. Oh, TO BE LIKE HIM. OH, TO BE LIKE HIM. AMEN. [clears throat] AMEN. Praise the Lord. The purpose of being here. Think about of all of our liberals, all of our leftists. Think about a lot of the right. Think about a lot of the Republicans. Think about all the world that doesn't really know what they're here for. They don't know who they are. They don't know what they are. Do they really think that adding another tattoo is going to give them a revelation of who they are? Another earring, another nose ring, another wickedness, another this, that, or the other. No, they'll never find it. They'll never find that. Brother Bam says that type of life, sin will never quench that thirst that's down in there. Cuz God I Hello. How many knows he put a void in everybody's heart? &gt;&gt; He put a void in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. It needs to be filled. a incomp completion. He left us incomplete. HE BROUGHT US TO A PLACE THERE WHERE WE WOULD BE INCOMPLETE SO WE WOULD DESIRE COMPLETENESS. WE WOULD DESIRE TO BE FILLED. A DISSATISFACTION SO YOU WOULD DESIRE A SATISFACTION SO HE COULD SATISFY YOU. SO HE COULD fulfill you. bring fulfillment in understanding who you are, what you come from, and where you're going. Amen. Where you are going. Then I will have some more questions. Amen. A few other questions that we really need to be asking ourselves. Asked the right question, get the right answer. There's a lot of people down through the Bible that question question God. Moses even, man, I can't speak. I ain't got no language. How am I going to go down there and do this? I'm insufficient. Amen. Didn't brother Brand preach on that on and the greatest battle ever fought? WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE INSUFFICIENT. &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T DO IT. WE'RE INCAPABLE. BUT SAYS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT GOD USES IF YOU RECOGNIZE, [screaming] YEAH, THAT'S YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS. THAT'S YOUR WAYS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. &gt;&gt; But think MY THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS, "BEGIN TO THINK LIKE ME. DIDN'T I MAKE THE MOUTH? DIDN'T I MAKE THE VOCAL CORDS? I MADE IT. MOSES, HAVE YOUR CONFIDENCE IN ME. IF I TELL YOU TO GO, I'M NOT GOING TO SEND YOU DOWN THERE BY YOURSELF. I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And God did. &gt;&gt; Maybe someday we'll get to hit the replay of when he got went into Pharaoh to tell him. I don't know. Didn't he have like a stuttering or something? Impedment. Pharaoh. you you you you going to going to have to let let let him let him go. Maybe not. Maybe he had perfectly clear talk. I don't know. But I'm here to tell you, God will use the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. He'll take the stupid things of what man thinks and he'll bring Pharaohs to their knees. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Because it's the ability that God gives. HOW MANY GLAD FOR THE ABILITY THAT GOD GIVES? I REJOICE THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID IF HE HAS BEGUN A WORK in you, a good work in you. &gt;&gt; It's up to you to finish it. &gt;&gt; NO, IT'S NOT UP TO YOU TO FINISH IT. HE'S GOING TO finish it. [screaming] HOW MANY GLAD FOR THAT? HE STARTED A WORK IN ME AND HIS WORD. HE KEEPS HIS WORD. HE'S GOING TO FINISH THIS THING. [applause] HE'S GOING TO FINISH IT. HE BROUGHT US SAFE THIS FAR, BROTHER BRAD. AND HE'S GOING TO LEAD US ALL THE WAY. EVENING NIGHT TIME. HE'S GOING TO LEAD US ALL [screaming] THE WAY. [applause] IT'S HIS WORK. IT'S HIS PROMISE. AND I'M RELYING ON IT. I'M COUNTING ON IT, BROTHER DANNY. [applause] WOO. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's right. [sighs and gasps] If id have had more time, we'd have had a lot more. But listen, you got a good work. There's so many promise, isn't it? All that the father hath given me will come to me and I won't lose a one. THAT'S HIS WORD. NO MAN CAN PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY HAND. HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU'RE IN THE HANDS OF GOD? AND THERE IS NO HEIGHT, NO DEPTH, NO DEVIL, NO SPIRIT. NOTHING WILL SEPARATE YOU FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. THAT'S HIS WORD. Whom he predestinated don't to those who he forneew. He predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son whom he has justified. He has also sanctified who he has sanctified. He's already glorified. M yum yum. Brother Bram said the Pentecostals used to do that. They actually lift their to lick their lip. That's good. You know what's good, brother Brad? I'll tell you what's good about it. Our prophet told us that what that meant whom he has justified, he has already glorified. Brother Glenn, that means that you already have a glorified body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many glad for that? WE'VE ALREADY GOT A [screaming] GLORIFIED BODY WAITING FOR US. HOW THAT NOT A THRILL EVENING LIKE TABERNACLE? HOW THAT THRILLS US THIS MORNING? DON'T THAT THRILL DOWN IN YOUR SOUL. KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT A THEOPHONY WAITING AND A THEOPHONY I HEAR IT [screaming] CALLING ME. MY THEOPHONY I HEAR IT CALLING ME. IT'S CALLING. Come up. A LITTLE HIGHER. COME UP. EVENING LIKE TABERNACLE. A LITTLE HIGHER. MORE THAN WE WERE LAST WEEK. MORE THAN WE WERE LAST MONTH. COME ON [screaming] PEOPLE. YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE HIGHER. YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP HIGHER. WE CAN'T STAY ON THE SAME PLATEAU. THOMAS [screaming] CAN'T STAY IN THE SAME PLACE. [sighs] [panting] &gt;&gt; AMEN. while ago I said told you I felt like my ministry was going to change a little. Not trying to copy the prophet but just to realize that hey there should be a little progress here. &gt;&gt; Don't you reckon &gt;&gt; should be some progress with us. And if it ought to be with our pastor then it ought to be with each one of us. &gt;&gt; He ought to be able to say you know there's going to be a little change in my life. Amen. We're going to come UP A LITTLE HIGHER. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE LIKE WE USED TO BE. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; CHURCH, it's going to BECOME MORE IMPORTANT TO ME. GOD'S GOING TO BECOME MORE IMPORTANT TO ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MORE IMPORTANT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD, TO PLAY A TAPE THAN TO SCROLL ON YOUTUBE, &gt;&gt; TO TAKE SO MUCH TIME ON THOSE THINGS, &gt;&gt; on our prayer bones. &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs] Amen. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Donna, didn't you not get that clock turned back? Cuz I've got 10 till 1. &gt;&gt; 10 till 1. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Man, you have almost got everybody out of here early today, baby. [laughter] Uh, and the Holy Spirit picked that up, right? Correct the air there. So, it's actually uh 11:52. Hey, that's all right. We got plenty of time, don't we? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's That's what's important to us is God's word. How many believes that? Oh, I just love these Bible stories. Don't you? But listen, there was another one. GOT IN A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE BECAUSE OF HIS OWN CARNAL THOUGHTS. And that was Kora and Nathan. Huh? CORA AND DAYATHAN THOUGHT, "MOSES, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY HOLY ONE HERE. THESE WERE NO DOUBT RENOWNED MEN, MEN OF RENOWN. A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT FOLLOWED DAYAN AND KORA. Is that right? YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY HOLY MAN HERE." And you know what they were really wanting is power. They want recognition, popularity, and power. You know, GOD USES US, TOO. Be careful what you think. God wasn't happy with their thoughts, now was he? They thought they knew more about it than what God thought about it. HOW MANY KNOW GOD WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM IF THEM IF THEY WANTED TO? Later on, THERE WAS A DISTRIBUTION of the responsibilities handed down later on, but not the way that them guys thought, the way that they wanted to do it. Amen. God was so displeased with it until he opened up the earth and swallowed them up because of the wrong thoughts that they had and the question that they had to God's answer. How many of these Moses was God's answers to delivering the delivering of the Israelites? I I like this CUZ GOD SAID, "I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER MY PEOPLE AND I'M SENDING YOU, MOSES." HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT GOD DOES THINGS AND HE DOES IT THROUGH YOU? HE DOES IT THROUGH HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; But you've got TO BE YIELDED. YOU'VE GOT TO BE SURRENDERED TO ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. Praise the Lord. Surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, help us. I believe we're getting closer and closer and that we need to be dead and dead to oursel that the Holy Spirit will have a greater and greater preeminence in each one of our lives. Not just just here in this last little bit. There are things I've been praying for and I find that if you will give time, give God a few weeks, give him a month, give him time. Don't be in such a hurry. I ain't no hurry. Never was &gt;&gt; but God will answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe God answers? &gt;&gt; But it has to be God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I BELIEVE THAT IS GOD IN YOU FULFILLING HIS PURPOSE, HIS WILL. I'm going to ask you another question. Next question is how do we overcome? How can we overcome? Brother Brad Wednesday brought it out how that God allows afflictions. He allows hard things to come our way. And this morning, I know I've preached on this many times, but I want to I feel like I have just a little bit more light on it. So, I want to touch on it a little bit. HOW HOW DO WE OVERCOME TRIALS? HOW WE OVERCOME TESTS, HARDSHIPS, things that are really, really get us to where we can't get over it. We can't get under it. You can't get around it. What is God's word on it? God's word on it is it this. But whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcomemeth the world? But he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God. Now we normally we just think, WELL, IT'S YOUR FAITH THAT OVERCOMES. BUT YOUR FAITH HAS TO BE IN SOMETHING. YOU HAVE TO FA HAVE [laughter] FAITH IN SOMETHING AND THAT HAS TO BE IN WHAT? GOD. It's your faith IN JESUS CHRIST. IT'S YOUR FAITH IN THE WORD. Because as I brought out last week that it's not you that fights the battles. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Can I touch on that just a little bit yet? It's your faith that overcomes. So no matter how great the battle is, no matter how the battle is, God is able to overcome it. God is the one that fights your battle for you. Amen. Praise the Lord. He told Joshua, I believe it was in Psalms, it says, [clears throat] "Be still and know that I am God." Be still. Hold still. I love that message. Stand still. Amen. Be still. Don't get all frustrated over things. Don't get all und done. Remember in Deuteronomy when they were coming out of the wilderness and so forth they murmured in their tents. Then said I unto you dread not neither be afraid of them. How many is glad that no matter what comes your way? You don't have to be afraid of it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be scared of it. How many is born by the word of God this morning? born by the spirit. Well, guess what? God keeps his word. How many believes you're a part of that word? &gt;&gt; So, he keeps that word. As long as you're walking in the line of duty. Amen. I'll never forget my wife. Amen. When she when we got all this news and everything, she says, "I'm at my post of duty. I'm teaching my grandkids. I'm cooking and I'm cleaning. I'm being a wife and I'm in my post of duties and I ain't scared. &gt;&gt; Huh? The devil's got to go. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? She was in her in the post of duty. And when you're in the way that God wants you to be, how many believes that there is your way and then there's God's way. &gt;&gt; And when you're in THE WAY THAT GOD WANTS YOU TO BE AND YOU'RE on his path following his word, he keeps you. &gt;&gt; HE'LL NEVER LET YOU GO. [applause] He said, "Neither be afraid of them, and the Lord YOUR GOD GOETH BEFORE YOU, AND HE SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU ACCORDING TO ALL that he did for you in Egypt. Listen, where are Let me see. Here they are. Couple of my quotes here in Joshua 1, one of my favorite chapters, he told Joshua, he says, "There shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with thee. I will not fail thee nor forsake thee." How many believes in the New Testament Jesus says, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." How many believe we got the same promise? And you ain't got to be afraid of whatever comes your way. Whatever is in our future, we don't have to be afraid of it. We don't have to be dismayed. &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not you. &gt;&gt; Woo. It's him. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. WHEN JOSHUA WENT ACROSS, WHEN WHENEVER JOSHUA CROSSED, DIDN'T GOD TELL HIM TO JUST GO AROUND JERICHO SEVEN TIMES? &gt;&gt; Go around seven times. And I think on the seventh time or so, amen, THEY SAID THAT GO SEVEN TIMES THAT DAY. And then at the END OF IT, BLOW YOUR TRUMPETS [screaming] AND SHOUT. &gt;&gt; WOO. HE DIDN'T SAY, "NOW, IF IT HAD BEEN JOSHUA AND THEY SAID, LOOK THESE WALLS OF GOD COMING DOWN. I WANT 100,000 OF YOU MEN, AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THESE GREAT BIG SPUD BARS, AND WE'RE GOING TO START CHOPPING INTO THIS STEEL INTO this uh UH STONE." THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS THOUGHT, &gt;&gt; BUT HE JUST DID WHAT GOD WANTED HIM TO DO. &gt;&gt; JUST DO WHAT GOD TELLS YOU TO DO. GOD WILL BRING THE OUTCOME. &gt;&gt; HE'LL MAKE IT WORK OUT. DO WHAT GOD TELLS YOU TO DO AND GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF IT. &gt;&gt; I can't get away from it. I love it. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; yeah. Amen. How many believe that we've entered into rest? We we entered into rest. The word of God, it it it gives you a place of rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. A rest in our soul. &gt;&gt; Ah, I'll go ahead and say it. Comes to my mind. But you get away from God. &gt;&gt; You grieve the Holy Spirit away. You have reason to fret, to be scared, to run, to be nervous, to be upset, TO BE DISMAYED. AH, [screaming] YEAH. You got every reason to be. But when you're in Christ and you're where you're supposed to be and God is in the control tower, &gt;&gt; you don't have to fear anything. &gt;&gt; You are in his hands. Your future's in his hands. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. Cuz you don't know. How many knows we don't know how bad things are going to get. We don't know for sure just how things are going to be. Some of us sometimes made makes it look like before the doors are closed, he going to take us up. Other places it looks like he'll shut us down. Amen. And and and we might get shot for going off in prayer for people. Amen. We don't know. We don't need things, you know, around the corner, but we don't have to fear any of it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. No man shall be able to stand before thee. Why? Because we've got the other thing that I want to speak on. And it may seem off the subject, but how many believes that Amen. Jesus said that he would the comforter. We've got a promise in the word of God that there would be a comforter in our life and that would be our guide. I don't know about you, but I need a guide. I need somebody to lead me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just can't do it by myself. Amen. Listen. He says, "I'll never leave thee, nor forsake thee." And at the end of it, he said, he said, uh, the book of the law of course shall not depart. But he says, "But have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage. Be not afraid, neither be dismayed. For the Lord thy God, he is with thee whethersoever thou goest. Remember when David came to Goliath, he says, you know, you come with me with sword and spear. Amen. You come up with big biceps and big muscles and a a mean look and a slobbering bunch of mouth and everything else, but I'm here to tell you, I don't come by my own power. I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts of Israel. And today, I'll cut your head off. Amen. How many you can say that this morning? Amen. That devil might want to make it look like this cancer is going to eat you up. This high blood pressure is going to eat you up. You ain't never Do you just tell him, "I don't come by my own ability. I come by the power of Almighty God. I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ. [applause] I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. WHATEVER YOUR NEED IS THIS MORNING, WHATEVER YOU HAVE A GREATER NEED OF, JUST BELIEVE on God. God said he would do it." How many believes you? If thou can't believe, all things are possible. That's God's word. God keeps his word. Amen. You take that word. You just believe. You just read this word. Amen. Like the prophet said, "Read this word. You take it into your heart. You believe it with all your heart." Amen. He said, "God is obligated to it." Something's got to give. [applause] &gt;&gt; How many believes that IF THOU CAN HAVE FAITH AS THE GRAIN OF A MUSTARD SEED AND YOU SAY TO THAT MOUNTAIN, "BE MOVED." &gt;&gt; HUH? Something has to give. God honors. How many believe God honors his word by keeping his word? He honors his word. Three Hebrew children, they trusted the Lord with all of their heart. And God honored him. We don't know if he will, but he can. We trust him with everything we have. Amen. Coming down to the end. Listen to this. He says, "When God made man, he made him thus. He made him with a little compartment in a man in it for his own throne, his control tower. God wants to lead man, but man wants to lead himself." Amen. Therefore, there is a war constantly. How many can say, "That's right, pastor. That's right, brother Ber. THERE EVERY DAY I FIGHT WITH MYSELF. I FIGHT IN MY MIND. I'M NOT TRYING TO THROW OUT THE WRONG THOUGHTS. KEEP THE RIGHT THOUGHTS. KEEP THE RIGHT ATTITUDE. WE ALL HAVE THAT. PAUL TALKED ABOUT IT. HE SAID THERE'S ALWAYS A CONSTANT WAR ABOUT THINGS THAT I WOULD NOT THAT I DO SOMETIMES AND AND SO FORTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. There's always a war going on between that first man, between your thoughts and his thoughts, between your ways and his ways. Amen. Praise the Lord. I thank God for what he has done for us in this generation to give us a word that we can take into our hearts, into our minds, and to become it. How many believes we got to become it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So faith, faith in what? Faith in God's ability to take you through is what we need. That's how you overcome. Well, I got faith in myself. I'M I CAN DO THIS. Watch out. [laughter] Yeah. Go ahead. Cuz how many knows the second that Eve began to think different than the word of God. Amen. She went the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; That's the way it is with man. And if you have a carnal mind, if you're a makebeliever in the church, you will lead that church in the wrong direction as soon as I'm standing here. Amen. All right. Praise the Lord. Listen to this. He says, "Men, you can't guide yourself. There's two ways. That's your way and God's way. How many knows Brother Abraham said that God's word is his way. &gt;&gt; That's his way. Either your way or his way. Amen. And when you're in your way, you're out of God's way. And you have to forget your own way to find God's way. A man cannot lead himself. Listen to the message called a guide the other day. Brother Bam talking about being up there and and in those mountains trying to hunt. Got a deer and hung him up. Remembering the storm came. He says, "I better get back." And he went back. He he he he he took off. He He's a guide. I know my way. Come back, I think, two or three times before he recognized, "Hey, I'm on a death walk." People go crazy on that death walk. Can we say that they're on a death walk out there and they're going crazy? They're losing their minds. &gt;&gt; He said one man did one time was on that death walk and his brother came and he tried to bite him and fight him and everything else. He had completely lost his mind. And I thought, man, you look at this world. They're on a death walk. They go round and round and round and round. &gt;&gt; Think about this. Didn't brother say that Billy Billy Billy Graham in his ministry, he would have them come and come to the altar. Come to the altar. Come to the altar. Right? And every year they come to the altar. But they wearied themselves to find the door. Never could get in the door. I come back and I have 30 thou I I I come and I get 30,000 converts. Come back next year ain't got 30. But Abraham says he's not leading them all the way. And he said he was actually blinding them. That's a terrible way to be. I was just listening to brother Brandham. I think it was uh either last night before bed or this morning and he's just talking about how the people like to adopt things and and bypass things. He says, "Man, there is nothing like having somebody come to the altar." Amen. And let him boo. And somebody says, "Oh, well, now you've prayed enough." HE SAID, "NO, STAY THERE UNTIL YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT, WHAT YOU NEED." AMEN. JUST CRY OUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Don't just go bypassing it. &gt;&gt; Get what you want because guess what? If you don't get what you what you come for the next time you come up, you'll probably say, "Well, I didn't get it last time." How many know those are all the devil's thoughts? &gt;&gt; Well, I tried this before and it didn't work. I tried to overcome this and I couldn't do it. Let me tell you something. That's all the devil's talk. &gt;&gt; I don't care if he takes you a million times. You keep right on doing. God will take it through. He'll help you. Just surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. All right, back to my subject. We're not made to guide ourselves. [snorts] We're made to follow the Holy Spirit, follow the word. Didn't finish my story, did I? That's right. He went all that three times, come back to his dear, and realized, and he said, he prayed. Brother Brandon prayed. Said, "God, you got to help me." I thought I was a guide. I am a I am boy. He really downed himself. I am not a guide. I cannot find my way out. And he says, I'm going to do the very best I can, Lord. He got up and started to go. Ain't that right? And a hand touched him on the shoulder, I believe it was. What is that? He looked and he heard a voice and he turned to look, I believe it was, and he seen an opening back behind him way over there. They had put a some kind of a wire. Ain't that right? They had to use used to some kind of wire down there so it could get to that wire. Amen. Amen. And he and he opened up the storm and he saw that over there and he says, "I was heading to complete towards Canada somewhere." He was going the wrong way. How isn't that how you and I are without the baptism of the Holy Spirit leading and guiding us? We'll go completely the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me say this that the word of God in order to really work has to be mixed with faith. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4 it says you know they the Israelites they had the word the word was they had the word but it wasn't mixed with faith. Israel did not have the faith that they were supposed to have. I mean know when Israel come to the Red Sea they weren't supposed to say hey look let's build a bridge across this river. How are we going to Is there enough timber in that woods over there for us maybe to make a bunch of rafts and go across the Red Sea? They weren't supposed to do all that. It wasn't supposed to be in their own ability that day they crossed. God was testing them just to see whether they would have faith or not. Faith in what? Themselves? No, BUT FAITH IN GOD. THEN God would make a way. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will make a way when there seems to be no way. How many believes that God always makes a way? Aren't you glad? Oh, this this is something that Lord's laid on my heart this week to tell you people. I try to lead the best that I can, teach the best that I can, but each and every one of us according to brother Brandham and the Ephesian church age, I believe it was, where he talked about the leadership of the Holy Spirit, how necessary it is for every individual. &gt;&gt; You need a greater leadership than just your pastor. You have to follow that leadership of the Holy Spirit in your heart. And that's what I desire today. If I don't say anything else, God, give everybody in here that uncction daily because I'm getting to the place, Amen, that I don't like to do any work. Lord, help me to install this countertop. We don't know if this thing's going to go in here or not. Lord, help me with this. Lord, help me with that. How many believe? CUZ YOU WANT GOD'S LEADERSHIP in everything that you do. Not just once, you know. No, but in everything. God help us. How many believe we all ought to be that way? Whether you make a a business deal, I'm going to go see this his business associate. Don't just go without praying. Say, God, you move on his heart. And if this is your will, ain't that right? How many believes HE'D GO A LOT BETTER IF WE'D FOLLOW THE LEADERSHIP of the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; The early church, Brother Bram said, they didn't want to do that. They just wanted the preacher tell them, "Hey, should I buy this car? Should I not?" No, you ought to buy it. Well, what's a pre preacher know about whether you ought to buy that car or not? [snorts] You know, but y'all each one have a leadership. God God spoke to my heart. So, my heart's desire this morning is God give us each one that leadership on a daily basis. How many believe that we'll be better Christians for it if we do? &gt;&gt; How many knows that? How many in here this morning would say with me, Lord, I want to be able to hear that voice louder than what I do? Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to witness. I want to testify to you this morning that I hear that voice much louder than what I did six months ago. &gt;&gt; That's right. Cuz it's been my desire, Lord. I'm listening. And it will it'll tell you what you need to know. I'm here to tell you it is. It will. And you might not always like it. You might not like what he tells you. Amen. I'm gonna go ahead and say it. How many of you God cares about the little things that we do? &gt;&gt; The little things that we do in following the Holy Spirit. Lately, by God's grace, I've done a lot better in keeping the speed limit. That's right. Keeping the speed limit. You say, "Well, brother, you're wrong about this. You're wrong about that." If you break a law, if you break one, you broke them all. Paul said, "Guilty of one is least guilty of all." So, Lord help us. Isn't that right? How many knows there's a reason brother Brandham honored God so much that he would? &gt;&gt; He would. So, when I go up and down here, I set mine on 64. I'm on the back roads 55 because I'm not I am not never have been in my life a person that like to go slow. And so it's hard. It's hard if you've done something for all your life. Hello. I think Sister Hannah and Sister Joyce one time followed me, didn't you? They said, "Brother, many, many, many years ago, Sister Hannah said something." Brother B, you need to slow down. at a wedding or somewhere. I forget where it was. But anyway, and I was like, "That's right." But you know, I believe that if you honor God, God will honor you. &gt;&gt; If you don't, then he's not really obligated. So, in those little things, Lord help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just those little things that God tells us. Amen. Because Jesus said that if you're not faithful in the little things, neither will you be faithful in the big things. &gt;&gt; And if you are faithful in the little things, you'll be faithful in the big things. So God help us. Those are just some of the things. Amen. The holy there's no telling. I don't know where y'all are at. I'd love I don't say I'd love to be able to read and see just where you are. Prophet God could. But you know where you're at. And God knows just how to speak to you. &gt;&gt; Whether it's to encourage you or text this person or repent of this or make that right. Amen. Amen. You might not you might not look at pornography. You might not do that. But you know the Bible says that as a man thinkketh in his heart so is he. How many believes you have to watch what you even think. &gt;&gt; Every thought that goes through your mind you want to be careful of. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're living in an age where it's very easy to let the wrong thoughts come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it's not just about the big things or whatever, you know. And if you do, remember this. You're cheating on your wife. If you have one, you're committing adultery. Whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after has committed adultery in his heart already. No. All of those things God will the Holy Spirit will keep you from. It'll it'll correct you if you if anybody's doing any of those things. Brother Brad, there was none of this was on my script. I'm just being honest with you. Other than that, I wanted to tell you, let's listen to that Holy Spirit on the on everything. Amen. And be more sensitive to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's stand. Let's bow our heads and talk to the Holy Spirit that's in our hearts. Lord Jesus, Father, we feel like you've answered prayer this morning. Lord, I ask God that you just help me to step it out out of the way, Lord, that you would speak. And I didn't intend to say those things. But Lord, I'm I I'm glad of it, Lord Jesus, that I didn't. For I realize that most of the times when it's not on the page, when it's not on the script, Lord Jesus, it's certainly you. If it wouldn't be, Lord, I would ask forgiveness and repent of it, God. But we want here at Evening Light Tabernacle. We want to be led by you, God. We're not here to play church. We're not here to be impersonators. We're not here to be make believers or unbelievers. We're here because we want to be genuine believers, followers of you, living lives that are pleasing to you, Lord Jesus. every thought that we think Lord Jesus that it would be the way that you would think about things Lord Jesus every action that we have that would express Christ Lord. So we humbly bow before you God this morning Lord Jesus saying take our hearts Lord fill that void Lord Jesus where Lord perhaps there's an emptiness I ask if there's any in here like that that you'll fill them with the spirit of God and help us to realize every day that there's nothing as important as our walk with you Lord our business and our everything else is not as important as hearing your voice and fellowshipping with you and waiting for the time when you come to call us home, God. And Lord, we raise our hands and say, "God, forgive me, Lord Jesus, where I've failed you, Lord, where I'm not what I ought to be, I ask, God, that you'd help me to listen to that still small voice, Father. The pastor may never preach about it. He may not have said anything about it, but I know because you show me. You speak to my heart and you tell me about it, Lord. And I just, Father, I want to follow you in whatever you tell me to do." We ask God that you'll take each and everyone this morning, Lord Jesus, to a [music] deeper walk with you, Father. A greater love for you, Lord Jesus. A greater love one for another, Lord. Lord, we'd give the very church off of our back to each other, Lord, if they needed it, Lord. And Father, this morning, we want to remember those that have not been feeling well. Brother Joe, Lord Jesus, each and every one that's been mentioned, Lord Jesus, serenity haven, Lord Jesus, and SA, [snorts] we already heard a report that it's one of them. Sale, I believe it's better, Father. And we thank you, Lord Jesus. And we believe, God, that you'll deliver him completely, Lord Jesus, this morning, Father. Lord, brother Joe's been asking God for strength and for energy, Lord. And we ask God, you've give him strength and energy, Lord Jesus. For we none of us feel good, it's not wonderful. It's not good at all if we don't have any energy or strength, Lord. And Father, I pray for the strength and energy of this church. May it surge, God. May each one of us, Lord, have a power surge, Father, so to speak, of the Holy Spirit to help us to be able to live this coming week, Lord, in the peace of God, knowing, God, that you fight our battles for us, Lord. And we surrender to you, Lord. And we watch you do it. We stand [music] still and know one thing, and that is that you are God. We love you with all of our heart now. Commit ourselves to you in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. God bless you. I know we went a little long this morning, I guess, with no Sunday school and all, but it's all right, isn't it? &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. a closer walk with thee. Granted, [music and singing] Jesus is my plea. daily [singing] walking close [music] to thee. Let it be, [music] dear [singing] Lord. Let it be.

[music] And there are people [singing] almost [music] everywhere whose hearts are all the flame with the [music and singing] fire that fell at Pentecost which cleans and made them clean. It is burning now within my soul. Oh, [music] glory to his name. I'm so glad that I can say I'm [music] one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them.
