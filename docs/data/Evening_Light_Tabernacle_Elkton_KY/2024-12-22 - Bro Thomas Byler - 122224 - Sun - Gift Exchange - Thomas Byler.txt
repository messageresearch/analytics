morning and this time of the Season we can just celebrate the birth of our savior and the death Buri on Resurrection of our savior I was listening to the songs and I I I'm not supposed to be up here saying anything to be honest but the Lord kept pressing something on me that that I learned this morning to share and I thought well I'll do it at this point at this point and then finally I thought I we just let it go and then Brother David looks at me he said you got something to say I said yeah I do so we'll just do what the Lord leads okay but I I I heard the story this morning and as the girls played the song and lay Away in a Manger and the story of the of the manger and I thought how how uh important it was you know nothing we happens in life happens without a reason and you know we hear about Mary and and the things that happened on that day and and then you hear about the manger and when I heard the story of the manger today it just struck out to me how important the little things in life are you know that manger we see it as a as a wooden manger that with hay and straw in it and but what it really was it was a it was a carved out Stone feed trough is the way it was it was a and what they would do the significance of that manger being Stone it was solid so when the perfect lamb was born if of the sheep when that perfect lamb was born the one who would take away the sins of the world the one who was spotless the one who was without fault or blemish when that lamb was born the Shepherds would take that lamb and lay it in that stone manger so that nothing could harm that little sheep that perfect lamb and Mary do you think she knew what she was doing when she wrapped him up and she laid that little baby in that stone manger and said here is the Lamb of God that'll take away the sins of the world on that very Christmas morning there and you know and I thought about that and they said you know they the the wise men they brought myrr when they hung him on the cross the Bible says they gave gave him wine laced with myrr and he received it not and and when they was in the when he was laying in that manger they said he would be called Emanuel for God is with us they mocked him and called him King of the Jews what an important gift Jesus was to us let's just sing that chorus again and and as we invite our pastor to come and he's got a a message for us this morning and I come expecting did you come expecting this morning amen let's just sing that chorus if we could Carson oh beautiful star of [Music] bethleem shine upon us until the [Music] glory oh give us the light to light the way unto God bless you brother Brad beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on one more time oh beautiful star of bethleem upon us until the glory on give us thy light to light the way onto the land where Jesus lay Bey fall star of bethleem shine on Amen praise the Lord good morning good to be in the house of the Lord amen good to have everybody out this morning amen certainly a nice little brisk beautiful winter day thank you musicians amen appreciate the music this morning amen want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas amen certainly hope that you have a really wonderful time amen with your family and amen as we celebrate at this time amen we know that the birth of the Lord was of course Amen in the springtime but amen the prophet but God said God wouldn't care where you what time but that just we honor and worship His coming to the Earth amen so praise the Lord let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you this morning thankful once again to be assembled together in your name in your house father Lord realizing God that you set this up father this is your set up this is the way that you have ordained for it to be Lord Jesus for the gospel to be preached Lord Jesus for Sinners to come to you Lord for people to be saved Lord for their lives to be preserved through eternity Lord Jesus to be immortal even as you're Immortal and father we ask God this morning Lord Jesus as we come before you Lord Jesus and Mark is wanting to be baptized and given his life to you Lord and we're thankful for this father and we ask God that you'll just bless not a meditation of a heart and that which we feel Lord that you've laid Upon Our Hearts to speak in Jesus name amen I was just thinking this morning amen the Lord amen yesterday I was pondering on what the Lord would have me to speak amen and uh I thinking of my series I was thinking of just kind of thinking of what I might what I want to say or whatever and I didn't really know what I wanted to say and something come to me well this is Christmas if you can't preach at Christmas I don't know that you can preach I mean come on you know you know so I mean I don't know maybe that was the Lord talking to me but I thought yeah that's about right if you can't preach at Christmas time I don't know if you can so amen and then I just begin to think and the Lord begin to lay something on my heart and and he just give me something that I like when he does that amen and it was just a a simple thought it was so simple that I thought you know but I learned something that no matter how simple it is if it's of the Lord that's what you need to do amen amen and so uh we want to share that with you and I thought this morning as I got up and the Sun was shining cold winry day and I thought we're fixing to go to church first of all isn't that a wonderful thing to be able to go to church and then to have something on your heart that God has laid on your heart to bring to the people so you have a AR rest so to speak and and you're not nervous or anything you realize what God wants you to say amen and then uh I thought that's just wonderful be amen because amen when God gives me something so we appreciate that and I trust amen it'll be a blessing to you this morning a simple message amen uh and I want to title it gift exchange gift exchange amen it'll be a Christmas message amen praise the Lord amen I know some people don't believe in Christmas and all that and and I and I've said well well brother brandham called it his Christmas message so if he did it it' be all right amen so praise the Lord so if you will turn your Bibles amen and this is certainly U uh this is going to be a message just centered around the simple gospel amen just preaching the simple gospel amen amen that God has given us amen and so I trust it'll be a blessing to you amen I think uh some of uh Mark's family brother Michael I think his mom's here so God bless you good to have y'all with us this morning and of course the Ws some of the other WS are gone this morning they're from the uh wedding and all so we're looking forward to having Dany and Julie and them coming back amen here next week so we pray that they have a great honeymoon um Mark let's go let me see let's go to Mark 8 Mark 8 and Isaiah 1 Mark 8 and Isaiah 1 amen amen we know that this is the season of exchanging gifts isn't it amen and we realize I think yeah as far as I know as much as I know about it amen perhaps they get it out of the Bible where they brought gifts to Jesus ain't that right gold frankincense and mura they brought their gifts to him and so forth and so we want to see talk about gift exchange how many knows that Jesus Christ wrapped in that uh swaddling cloth laying in the major was the greatest gift God ever gave to mankind that was the greatest gift amen why because it was the key he was the key or should we say the door for Humanity to come back into fellowship with him amen that Adam lost in the fall so what a Monumental time amen I'm going to read this and then we'll just try to get started amen and you know we just follow the leading of the spirit this morning if we go a little extra long just bear with us is that okay we want to try to convey what the Holy Spirit wants us to say Amen Mark 8 and verse 34 and when he had called the disciples called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what a man profit what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul amen whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me in my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with his Holy Angels amen Isaiah 1 and verse 18 come now and let us reason together sayeth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be see that you might say well that's awful strange Christmas scriptures am mean normally we would talk and read about him laying in the manger and so forth but we want to go and jump ahead just a little bit with the help of the Lord amen you know I was thinking back there that there was a ma there was a time when Humanity was ignorant right we didn't we didn't know just exactly what God expected of us amen amen man in ignorance didn't really know just what to do thought about Israel and how that they uh murmured and complained and how they were bit of the serpents and a a and wouldn't it have been maybe wouldn't it maybe have been better or or should we say what would have been like if God says now look before we get out of this Egypt before we leave Egypt I want everybody to understand there's some really strange things coming down to shoot you're going to come up against things that you won't know what to do which way to turn but don't never complain don't never murmur all right always just trust your leader and he could have made it so simple but he didn't he blindsided them is that right he just let them out led him down to the Red Sea and just bam there they were stuck and they didn't know for sure what to do and they complained they murmured God didn't like their murmuring and complaining he didn't like Moses murmuring and complaining but you know and I thought you know fool me once ain't that right fool me once that's on you but fool me twice what does it say then it's on me so you see folks if you don't know and you don't understand amen maybe you get caught and you do something wrong well you know that may be in another person's situation another person's fault but once you know amen and then you do it again and keep doing it then it's on you now how many knows that God has made a way for us through Jesus Christ he giv us all the examples of the Old Testament like and Corinthians the 10th chapter he says all these things were our examples so that we wouldn't do what they did so if you still do it it's on you can I say this morning if you are lost if your soul is lost it's going to be on you not God amen I was listening brother Bram yesterday and he made a statement that I thought was profound and I didn't remember him saying he says the number primary one way for God to speak to you the number one way for God to speak to anybody he says is the word of God through preachers that's right is that what Jesus said after he rose up again he said go ye into all the world and what preach the gospel that's right so the primary way for anybody to get saved for anybody to hear the word of the Lord is through the fivefold ministry through ministering so this morning we stand here just in that situation that right first of all the preacher has to be yielded to God he don't fear man he don't cater to man or what man thinks or what he thinks himself amen but he follows the leading of the Holy Spirit and it's God speaking through the fivefold ministry so I thought that was all right I really like that of course how many knows we've all got a still Small Voice that speaks to us we've got a personal relation with God and he speaks to us and he shows us thing but the number one way is this right here this morning is what you're listening to amen so I want to say this morning amen God has given us every example we've had all of history think about it we've had Luther Wesley Pentecost we've had acts we've had got the Bible I mean we got signs wonders we've had a prophit in our generation come and show the power of the resurrected Jesus like never before service after service there is no excuse man I was thinking back there all the evidence that God has shown in this generation amen and that people still don't get it it's going to be on them amen and the world who who to whom much is given to them much will be required it'll be more tolerable he said in Sodom and gomor and in the in the age that he was living in it'll be more tolerable ain't that right because why they would have repented in days of Noah I'm Jonah he says you know in days of no Jonah if they have had the Miracles even they will come up and rise up into judgment and condemn this generation he said because they repented at the preaching of no and Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here amen so it's going to be hot it's going to be bad for those who reject God after seeing him infallible come and Vindicated and proven the way that he has in this generation let me start first of all realize that God is always giving gifts God always give gifts amen you sitting there is a gift your life is a gift you being alive is a gift we understand through the prophet and how he taught how that when a when a man and woman come together and in the conception there is another million different persons that could have been born besides you but they'll just go through each other and the two will come together the act and so forth and and just the one that God ordains to life comes together and you become Ain that right give life itself is a gift of God the breath that you breid it's a gift of God the pews that you sit on it's a gift of God the world that you're in it's a gift of God God has given us everything he has given us the whole world and now what will we give back what will you give back amen and people I thought about back there how that people uh just really don't realize how valuable they really are every soul in here is worth 10,000 Worlds the Bible says here that what will a man give an exchange for a soul cuz you haven't profited one fit if you gain the whole world and if you lose your soul we know this here it's only a temporary body it's only a temporary house a that right on the inside of that is called what do you call a spirit there's a spirit that you're driven by the soul is driven by a spirit and it even doesn't go to where it's supposed to it stays here God takes his man but not his Spirit devil takes his man but not his Spirit but what's important is not so much a spirit even though it's important that you're driven by the Holy Ghost but it better be that that soul that soul is what's important and that's what you are that's you on the inside of the inside that is your soul it's you is that right and that's worth everything and people most of the time well let me just back up a little and how that we go after 50 years old how we're supposed to go to the doctor and we're supposed to get our heart checked out we're supposed to get our head checked out we're supposed to get others our insides checked out is't that right all kinds of different tests that we'll do to make sure there ain't a cancer there's not a little growth there's not little this or that or the other Wom and amen and checking mammograms and things like that just to make sure nothing's there a that right why they'll do that because why they don't want to there something in there that's going to take their life we'll go on diets man the doctors everything exercise and the way you eat amen make sure you eat right make sure you exercise right and that right all for what all for this outside body that's going to perish anyway but they don't take care of that Soul that's under the inside that's worth 10,000 worlds folks I believe it's time amen people won't come to church they won't go to the hospital amen and let the preacher let the word of come word of God come anden begin to tell you amen find out where your heart is where your desires are see where you are at with God how is your soul doing that's what's important people most of the time let me tell you something most of the people in this world Amen don't never really take inventory of their soul until they come down to the door death then they realize oh man I shouldn't have done this and I shouldn't have done that I shouldn't have been this way and I should have cared more about that huh why because they realize that they got to go and meet an awesome God Amen that perhaps they have not served all their life cuz you're going to meet God how many knows he said anybody that confesses me before men I will confess him before to my father and all the whole hosts of heaven but he that denies me I will also deny him oh it's got to be a reality to every one of us there's a land beyond the river there's a heaven to go to a hell to shun a judgment to shun that's right it's going to be just as sure as this Leo Wicked Sodom and Gomorrah age is fixing to get burned up there's going to be be a heaven and a new Earth people are just so unconcerned about their soul we should take a daily test is't that right we take I don't know about you but I take a bunch a whole handful of vitamins every day yeah omega-3 I like you know omega-3 and apple cider vinegar pills and on and on and on that's right why because I know I don't like this little thing here hurting me and if I don't it goes to hurting a little H that hurt ain't supposed to be there you know hurting H hurting I'm I still want to take a x-ray here and before too awful long take an x-ray see just how all my arteries are doing ain't it good just make sure I ain't got no blockings but if I can help it I don't want to have open heart surgery I don't want to eat all that pork and everything else like I do and and one of these days have to go in and have about five different blockages we want to try to avoid that if we can amen why because we're concerned but people need to be concerned about this so can you imagine living through eternity Living For Eternity you'll either do two things you'll live for eternity in a land that you can't even imagine how beautiful it is or you will be destroyed your soul will be destroyed in hell and you can't imagine how bad that's going to be and you see how many knows that Jesus came to give us the the gift of eternal life how many believe that he came to give us the gift of eternal life that's what he wants us in Every Soul on the face of the Earth to have I'm thankful let me just recop re re re uh retell you the story again how many knows God allowed all of humanity come into this Fallen condition he allowed Eve to come and fall he allow allowed all of this to happen but with the same thought and the same under the same line he also made a way of Escape so that you can live in a world and in a way that you do not have to fear death so that you can know that you have eternal life we were born in sin shap and iniquity come to the world speaking lies amen and God says come let us reason together come on let's have a talk I'd like to make a deal with you how many know God would like to make a deal with you that's right he wants to make an exchange with you with every person upon the face of the Earth God's voice calls come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and I will change it your weariness and I will give you rest God is still calling amen praise the Lord how many's glad for that see we're not ignorant we're not ignorant of God's plan are we that he allowed all this to happen he knew it would be but he also made a way of Escape told you it was a simple gospel is that okay this morning just a simple Gospel made a way of escape and it's through him through him Lord help us your life is a gift but you will have to give an account of how you spent your life amen one place he says you know I give uh give you Talent he give one one Talent one five Talent one 10 talents and they all and prospered with it Ain that right except the one the one that had one it just hid it in the field where did that where did that unprofitable servant go into outer Darkness ain't that right but the rest of them went and exchanged it and got more God give you life but he ex he expects you to exchange it and get more Abundant Life I came that they might have life and that more abundantly but you got to trade your old life in you got to trade that worthless wreck failed life our first birth if you have never been born again you're living a life of failure you were born it's in shape how in the world do you ever expect to succeed amen under a failed condition that's right we fail in life when you don't got God you're a failure you were born that way you can't help it but you can help it after you know better oh boy wait till we get to the sticky part amen that's right amen Rich Young Ruler came to him what must I do to inherit eternal life and isn't it something how Jesus said Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and th mother Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and the young man says unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet folks if he' had just had to have all of that he says man I I got it but he knew he had to have something more didn't he Jesus knew just how to speak it to him what I lack yet he says if thou wil be perfect go and sell that thou H give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me Rich Young Ruler was given the opportunity to have eternal life but he loved his wealth more than he wanted God's Gift people love their self more than they love what God has to give them over in Matthew 10 and verse 32 says who whoever therefore will confess me before men him will I confess before my Father which is in heaven whosoever will deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven think that I am come to send peace on Earth I came not to send peace but a sword for I am come to set a man that variance against his father and daughter against his mother and daughter-in-law against his mother-in-law for a man's foe shall be the of his own household you see folks he says if ye love father or mother more than me you're not worth worthy of me he's not going to make a deal with you if you love family or anybody or anything else more than him you can have no Idols in front of God he has to be first above your wife or anybody that's right anybody that's his command that's his demand that's the deal that he [Applause] makes amen and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not wor worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it amen another place he that saves his life you want to keep your life go ahead and keep your life you want but you're going to have a bad deal at the end you're going to lose your life but if you'll give Christ your life and you'll die to yourself then you'll preserve it that's the deal ain't that something I like that say oh I gave him my old tattered garments he gave me a robe of pure white give him your old filthy rags he would take your old filthy life your old filthiness because all of our righteousness is as filthy rags the Bible says but he'll take that old tattered garment and he'll give you a robe of pure white how many GL as you've traded your old robe and your old old tattered garment this morning I trust I'm talking to people that know what I'm talking about I know what it's like to say God I am here to give my life unreservedly to forgive me of my sins and my wretchedness wash me white clean and he did it and fill you with the Holy Ghost amen amen praise the Lord what was the Rich Young ruler's problem it was going to cost him too much oh yeah it's free as my former Pastor used to say it's free but it's going to cost [Laughter] you might not make a lick sense I don't care if it don't that's what the Bible says and that's the way I see it he theyy hello you could have never bought it if you went to Calvary and they stuck those things in your hands and put it on your side and crucified you you'd have been a rotten dead sinner that's all you'd have been but when he died he paid the price He Paid a Debt he did not owe I owed a debt I could not pay how many glad that he paid the price for you and he gives it to you free but you've just got to give him your old tattered garments you got to give him your life you got to come at the altar and say God I give you my life unreservedly here amen praise be to God that's right see the Bible says the wages of sin is death that's right you get a wage you make make an exchange you make a deal how many knows every time you go to work you make a deal you make an exchange with your boss you give them so much labor and so much time he gives you some cash money a that right that's right an exchange the Bible says what are you going to give in exchange for your soul most people just want to keep their life that's your exchange I just want to do what I want to do I want to live my life the way I want to live it go ahead you have that option remember the rich that rich man that had everything Lazarus stood at his gate begging and everything else didn't have nothing but he was a Christian after a while the Lazarus that was a Christian he went to the bosom of Abraham is that right Jesus tells about it and the rich man found himself needing only one thing just one drop of water one drop of water just get somebody give me a drop of water it's hot up in here to cool my tongue wasn't it how many's ever burnt your tongue folks burn my finger burn my toe burn my nose burn my cheek burn whatever you want but don't burn my tongue right cuz that really hurts amen but he just wanted some comfort he says man send somebody back send somebody warn my brothers not to come here how many know it's that same Holy Spirit today is here warning you don't go there don't go the downward path you don't want to go there and sadly enough only those who are interested in it care not to try to go there everybody else is well I don't care how many's glad that God put a little care in here I'm glad I care about how I stand before God how I look before God Amen that's right we care Rich Young Ruler did not care enough what would you have done if You' had been that Rich Young Ruler what would you have done that's what I wanted to hear if you're a Christian this morning if you completely sold out to God that's what you'd have done because that's what you did you don't care I don't care if he wants me to be a pper I don't care what God wants me to be that's what I want to be whatever he wants me to be my life is his that's how you get somewhere with God and back then you would have said the same thing but what about the disciples remember come follow me they left all they left everything their fish nuts wherever they were and they went and followed him how many believes that call is still going on way back down here in leadsa 2024 that Call's still amen going out call and follow me praise be to God that voice is still crying out Cain he didn't want the deal the deal was God himself came and say now King just do like your brother did and I'll accept you huh I'll accept you just do like your brother that's all he had to know but no not Cain why because the Bible says he's that Wicked one he didn't want it no he wanted that hatred a little bit more you know I don't think I would be wrong in in presuming Brother Brad I don't think I'd be wrong in presuming that Cain didn't want to repent he was kind of glad he met killed his brother he kept that same attitude I'm glad I killed him now he's out of my hair why because that same vengful spirit I mean as you think through that spirit and he never got rid of that Spirit he wouldn't repent when God told him to repent do what's right he wouldn't do it same way with the scribes and the Pharisees we know that the a man of ain't nobody can raise up last for and they of God but we're jealous of the crowds that you have the popularity that you have they had pride in their hearts amen they wouldn't confess that they were wrong that they needed to repent they kept that same attitude until they crucified him away with him away with him we don't want that gift it didn't come the way we wanted it to come I mean that's another problem with the world today is it doesn't come the way that they think that it'll come all the churches man it's got to be Amish it's got to be menite it's got to be that that w't come in any of that stuff and if it don't come their way well they just don't want it they don't care how many people were raised from the dead how many Open the Eyes of the blind how much discernment was going on that he thought to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart just like he did when he was on the shores of Galilee Pillar of Fire coming did the very same thing brother B saying here you know who I'm waiting on that pillar Fire come every service oh I believe I don't believe I believe with all my heart that that'll be played back those will be played back on the day of judgment oh we are oh my praise the Lord listen Jesus if you uh listen if he would come to Jeffers will Jeffersonville to a poor City like ours How would how like a like a a uh President coming or something oh they'd put on the dog and they'd get everything out for him they'd do everything dress up the streets and everything like that and make him welcome that's right if you're a politician so forth but Jesus can come in the form of the resurrection of his power can come in the Holy Ghost and can show signs and wonders Amen in the newspaper and everybody criticize it call it be a fortune telling come in the power of his resurrection how many knows Discerning the thoughts and intensify proving that Jesus Christ is alive as much as he was on the shores of Galilee more than we've had for 2,000 years hello my my my it does something to me so K he didn't want it no he wouldn't trade it for nothing Rich R ruler he wanted his riches more than what he wanted eternal life amen Judas sold his soul for 30 pieces of silver let me tell you something you talk about a double loss a double loss

my Commandments Paul said let anybody that's spiritual acknowledge that the things that we write unto you are the Commandments of God so what Paul said were the Commandments of God Amen praise the Lord think about those who I want to talk a few minutes those who really didn't want to make the trade isn't it something you have to make a choice you're forced to make a choice and on the day of judgment it'll be played back the time that you had your chance that you had your opportunity to make your choice amen amen those pick formers they didn't want him but guess what Legion did is that right the guy in the tombs he did he accepted him he was free from all of those demons got to go back to his family amen glad for somebody that want it praise the Lord amen now let's get to a little bit of the sticky stuff shall we praise the Lord over in Matthew I believe it is no not Matthew thank you Lord for bringing it to my mind John very very very familiar scripture for any of us see for God to love the world that he gave huh he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his world to his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved how many believes God is still calling everybody whosoever will I wish it would Echo Plum across the world whosoever will let him come the spirit Revelations last chapter the spirit and the the bride say come folks I'm here to tell you when I was 20 years old down in pinecraft Sarasota I am so thankful that I heard that call in here that said there's got to be something more than drinking and cring committing adultery and partying and all that other stuff there's something much better than all of this God didn't make the world for that and he begin to draw on me call on me how many knows God has to do the drawing God has to pull on your heart if you pull if you have any tug on your heart you be Greatful to almighty God be thankful for that tug I heard that call come to me amen I'm glad that God is still call calling praise the Lord no doubt but Mark's glad that God did something in his life already amen how many's believing for brother Mark God's going to do great things with that young man amen and that we all support him we're all going to encourage him he'll need it you'll be a part of the body brother Mark part of the local body body part of the body of Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're not alone amen amen now let's go on he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already whoa so if you got somebody that don't believe in Jesus you're already condemned why because you don't believe on the son of God you're already in a condemned state if you don't believe in the Son of God because he's the only way for you not to be condemned amen because he has not believed in the only begotten name of the son of God and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world how many believe that light has come into the world Joy to the World the Lord Has Come amen they brought Tidings of great comfort and joy comfort and joy oh Tiding of comfort and joy oh if you haven't received it you must not want it it's totally available it's totally paid for it's totally presented to you the only reason you don't have it is cuz you don't want it amen if you go to a doctor's office and you're sick and he says here this bottle penin will knock that out well I don't like the bottle it's in I don't like you Doctor you have scruffy hair and you don't look like you have good hygiene huh you might not like the person that's bringing it you might not like the cover that coming in but if you don't take it it's your own fault that's the way it is with God that's the way it is with eternal life if you go to hell you want to go to hell you got to fight over the preaching of the word you got to fight over your own conscience you got to fight it looking at the sun and knowing it makes a perfect Revolution every day amen the moon and the stars they all perfect God is there and you got to fight it and block it out God ain't there I don't believe him got to wait fight your way to hell oh how many traded in your old r trade it in sorrow for Joy trade it in depression for Joy trade all them things in trade in death for Life Darkness for light amen praise be to God the simple gospel give God your life give him his your all he'll fill you with eternal life amen all right still coming to it all right this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and Men loved Darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil there's just simply people that love Darkness more than they like light brother Brandon when that Maniac come up there and was going to punch him in the face and everything else and said you'll fall at my feet the holy spirit said and he did isin't that right and then they ask him well was he delivered no he wasn't delivered why because he loveed that Spirit he worshiped that Spirit you can never be delivered you can never be saved if you love your old ways that's what the Bible contributes to people not getting what they want in Christ is because they just simply love something else more amen there it is in a nutshell what do you want whosoever will whosoever wants to what do you want my how many knows that God put a little compartment in our heart amen the science and medical science found a little place in the heart a little void a little um a void or a space an empty space so to speak amen amen I want to call it the manger the Abode of the Holy Ghost or the Abode of the Soul there's a little void in there amen and I'll tell you right now if you don't get it filled with the Holy Ghost you'll try to quench that thirst in there amen with everything in the world never be satisfied how many know the things that the devil offers you never satisfied Never Satisfied that's that's why it's always torment always something else something else something else from here to there to here to there amen my I'm so glad that at the age of 20 about four years older than Mark now God got a hold of me God found me amen I hope he finds you tonight or this morning cuz he's knocking how many noise I stand that at the door and knock If any man will open I will I'll make a deal if you open the door I'll come in I'll s with you I'll give you the timee of your life like you ain't never had joy unspeakable ain't no drug compar to this makes you feel good yeah that's right it'll do something for you better than drugs why because he's the lily of the valley brother Braham says he's a lily of the valley and where did he get opium from by crushing a lily they'll get that opium out of it and they'll give it to people that are distressed and it'll help them to loosen up a little what we need is the lily of the valley that was crushed on Calvary to come into your heart amen and it'll loosen you up a little bit it'll make you feel [Applause] better amen I'm here to tell you it's a cure all it's a cure all acts 238 is a gift of God it's a trait repent every one of you is that right I'm going to read it I know I can probably rehearse it but I want to just read that before I go oh my some more you love him this morning I would say sorry I get a little carried away but I'm not saying to say I'm sorry I'm not sorry at all amen if you join me it won't bother me a bit amen cuz God is good isn't he verse 37 then when all of the well I'll go back a little bit when they were preaching to the house of Israel and so forth Peter says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this same Jesus whom you have crucified talking about people whom they had crucified him both Lord and Christ and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do he mean how many knows that's what we need to know what in the world are we going to do Peter says unto him turn around repent from your sins the problem is a lot of people want Christ they want the new birth they want to they want they want eternal life but they don't want to repent they don't want to turn from their own Wicked way you've got to make a deal with God God I give it all up I give it all up to you I repent and be baptized in every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promise is to you to your children to us down in leosia all the way to mark all the way to anybody that ever will come in the promise I promise you I'll give give it to if you [Applause] repent now I'm Ready the reason that people don't want to receive this rap package because they know what's on the inside of it and they didn't want it that's the reason churches and people today in the governments in the lands will not receive Christ Christmas present is because they know what's in it they don't want it it'll make women act different it'll make men act different amen you'll have to bear the name of fanatic maybe you'll have to take the away with the Lord's just by few you'll have to clean up your life you'll have to quit your meanness you'll have to stop doing wrong and cheating and stealing and lying and committing adultery you'll have to stop those things and the people don't want that amen they don't want it it brings too much truth to them it uncovers their sins so therefore they don't want it they want nothing to do with it they keep away from it amen oh my they don't want it why cuz when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll take the desires of those things away from you and if you're still wanting them he can't give you the Holy Ghost cuz the Holy Ghost is a nature to change yours to God's nature woo you'll love to abstain from Evil I was behind the vehicle yesterday up here at the light the guy stepped that stopped at the light and then just it was red he just went on I looked both ways I said that guy just ran the stop sign and I told honey I guess it's not much different than breaking his speed limit I mean he's breaking the law either way all right but how many know the holy spirit makes you sensitive makes you want to do right makes you love your neighbor makes you love your enemy makes me love everybody oh give me that old time religion how many wants more of that old time religion it was good for Paul and Silas it was good for the prophet of God it's good for you and I take the desires of sin away from you makes you want to live holy before God but people don't want it the churches didn't want God's wrapped gift they don't want no PR they don't want no trade and no presence why because it would take away from their Prestige and their pride amen but oh my praise be to God all right let's turn the corner praise the Lord I love that don't you promises to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call I'll throw this in y'all got a little extra time all right let me throw this how many knows that another gift that God gave to the church a gift that a lot of times we ignore and we don't really realize that is in Ephesians when he ascended chapter 4: 8 when he when he says when he ascended on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men I'm here to tell you that God Is A Gift Giver what did he give when he went up to heaven he gave gifts send back some more gifts he gave some Apostles and Prophets evangelists pastors and teachers how many know you operate what the gift you're looking at the gift this is Thomas berer right here but if I have the gift of Pastor then there's a god-given God ordained gift on the inside and you're enjoying the gift of God is that right every Church servers you get a gift God sends a gift every time an evangelist comes by and what is it for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ he G gives you a gift that edifies you till we all come to Perfection till we come to the Statue of a major the perfect man that's what it's to do so all of that is a gift of God so when a evangelist comes and steps on your toes and preaches to fight say thank you Lord for your gift it gives you a gift that blesses you not going to go over into First Corinthians there it talks about there's many de diversities of gifts and helps and governments and everybody out there God distributes gifts out there helps governments healings and faith and all these things how many we're a body we're all been given something to do something with oh my praise be to God Amen so Lord help us amen all right let's turn to our conclusive scripture and that is going to be in St John St John praise the Lord St John 1 amen I stand this morning Minister of the Gospel amazed dumbfounded and at a place of Wonder of how that God has made all that he has made and yet there's so few people that really know him they don't really know him he hides himself in humility and simplicity and if it's because people's minds really aren't open I mean You' got to open your mind and you got to open your heart for him to come in and all the different things the whole world the Bible says he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not they don't know their own maker that's pretty sad the condition that the world in is pretty sad and may I say this any individual where Christ isn't in your world you're pretty sad you're in a sad place I was amen I'm thankful that he he came aren't you then it says he came to his own he came unto his own verse 11 and his own received him not I mean those Israelites did not receive him the most religious people of that hour didn't receive him our Prophet come along in this generation and said that they all the churches out there lead to their own understanding and when Jesus would come and discern the thoughts intents of heart they'd say if you go to one of them meetings we'll excommunicate you they put him out the very Church world that we you and I live in put Christ outside the door according to Revelations 3 behold I stand at the door and knock he was outside the door they had put him out amen fulfilled in around 1962 1963 when the church world put him out amen but I like the next verse because there's a butt give a butt a hand say thank you Jesus for the butt but as many as received him to them gave he power to become Sons and Daughters of God how many sons and daughters of God have we got this morning why because you didn't make the exchange you received him you accepted him you're not ashamed you're not ashamed to be called a bromite to follow a prophet of God that prophet's a gift that had thus sayth the Lord never fail one time brought us back to the pure unadulterated word of God just like a medicine that's pure amen this medicine's absolutely going to cure you amen he brought us back to the pure word of God and it's curing us amen it's curing us even from this flesh will one day be changed in moment in the twinkling of an eye amen as many as received him gave he power over evil power over fear power over depression power over all the powers of the enemy how many's glad that you have power over all of the enemy power to become a son and a daughter of God look act and think the way that God thinks amen praise the Lord it is as simple as that amen just simply give your heart your life to Jesus Christ unreservedly say God from This Day Forward till the day I die I'm yours I will trust in you I will put you first in my life in everything amen I'm glad he's still calling amen amen I'm thankful for what God is done I wasn't there brother Brad probably wasn't there maybe David might have been there a little bit but I believe it's something that God sovereignly does to us sovereignly sure we like to testify witness and a lot of times God uses us to bring somebody to God Amen but it still takes God to draw it takes the Holy Spirit to draw somebody amen and when he does he was telling me brother Mark was telling me he had four overdoses over those four times I said I can't help but believe God's got a purpose for him because if not he to be in a world right now in a nightmare a lost nightmare when you die you don't go to heaven you don't go to hell you are in a nightmare you're stuck in a nightmare no matter how much you wiggle how much you shake or scream you don't wake up up you stay in a nightmare until the day of judgment amen but a saint a Christian we have another body that we go into we're not just some soul drifting we have another body that we go into in the presence of God stand with me if you will this morning is there anybody in here has never received the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior you'd want to do so by raising your hand say I want to accept Christ as my savior I want to confess him before men amen is there a backslider in here it says I need to get closer to God than what I am Raise Your Hands Say Yeah Lord I'm not where I ought to be with you God bless those hands Lord Jesus you see those hands father even brother Bram said we backslide every day Lord we we're honest we're all not quite as close as what we should be Lord we ask God that you touch these hands now that are up Lord Jesus draw us all closer to you Lord Jesus and then we give you praise Lord Jesus because we accept our forgiveness because you died for our forgiveness on Calvary and we have come to you Lord Jesus and we have reasoned with you together and Lord though we aren't perfect and though our sins perhaps be as Scarlet you said they would be white as snow and that they would for be forgiven and we thank you for the grace Lord Jesus that you have given to each and every believer in here this morning we ask God that as we're about to change the order to service and go into the baptism Lord Jesus we ask God that you will baptize brother Mark with the baptism of the Holy Ghost change his life forever may he never ever be the same and may he be a reflection of Christ and what God can do to a young man who in his first life Lord certainly failed Lord as we all have Lord but now father father it'll be a success because it'll be in you Lord Jesus you'll do the leading and The Guiding father Lord Jesus we thank you in Jesus name amen and amen just want to say how many is appreciative of the mercy and the grace of God I how amen the mercy and the grace of God I am looking and you are looking at trophies of his people who have derived from his Mercy and Grace cuz Mercy is what rewrote all of our Lives how many is in here say Mercy

abound God forbid how shall we that are dead in sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life for if we have been planted together in likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin but he that is dead is free from sin amen praise the Lord amen Mark way let just have a word of prayer Lord Jesus we just ask God that you would just take Mark now father and Lord as we bury him we ask God that
