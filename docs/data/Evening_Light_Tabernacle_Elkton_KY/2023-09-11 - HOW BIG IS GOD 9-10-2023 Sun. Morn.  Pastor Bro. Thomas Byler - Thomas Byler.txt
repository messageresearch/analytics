for this morning and shouting you know I I'm gonna confess something this morning I'm not going to hold back anymore and I'll tell you the reason why I went to Arkansas last week to my daughters and and me and my son-in-law we went to Razorback football game and I watched them people there from the little bittiest that could barely learn how to talk you know what they taught them kids how to do to call the Hogs has anybody ever heard that how dumb that is there's 40 000 people there doing that and I was one of them and I thought Lord here we are a hog I've got to laugh and I kept on calling everybody was doing the same thing and I thought but you know what I thought we'd come to church and some of us can't even raise our hand and praise the King of King the Lord of lords for giving us the victory this morning and it began to prick my heart and I said Lord help me not to be reserved no more never again I said Lord you help me if we can get that happy over and they did win thank the Lord I'd always hate going and paying whenever they lose but but I thought Lord help us not not to hold back not to hold back no more the world's not ashamed why should we be ashamed we got the greatest thing in the world and you know in the world if you had the greatest thing and you know years ago this was nothing but what it isn't now every little bitty kid and every old person in the world has got one of these dumb things and years ago when I was a kid we shared a phone line and I know you kids probably think you're crazy but we did because everybody didn't have it you remember that sister Hannah in Arkansas everybody shared the same phone line out there where they lived at but now that's the greatest thing but the greatest thing is what God's done in our heart lives this morning I said Lord help me never again amen just not to hold back no more man brother Daniel brother Michael John God bless you it's good to see you this morning brother Paul would you come and take up the offering and pray over the prayer requests this morning glad he's able to be here this morning amen I want to remember brother Josh this morning that God will continue to touch his body glad to

been asking the Lord to help get rid of one of my sins which is gambling and I gambled in over two months he has taken the desire away from me to even walk in a casino and I thank him every day several times a day so I just wanted everyone to know that he is real all you got to do is ask [Music] if Jesus comes tomorrow to spend some time with you would you answer all his questions or lie to hide the truth would you welcome him with open arms or even let him in if Jesus comes tomorrow [Applause] [Music] if Jesus calls your number could you leave today you ready ready for early goods and walk away [Music] a Month of Sundays just to tell him of your sin if Jesus comes tomorrow what then if the sky turns black as midnight in the middle of the day and somehow you knew that Jesus would soon be on his way would you have to beg forgiveness or could you reach out and touch his hands if Jesus comes tomorrow what is [Applause] midnight oh the day and somehow you knew that Jesus would soon be on his way but you have to beg forgiveness or could you reach out and touch his hand 15 [Music] would you have to beg forgiveness or could you reach out and touch his hands if Jesus comes

that is Amen brother Joshua and the Lord amen I feel like the God just brought his hand down there and watched over him don't you amen the devil no doubt would have likened to taken him but wasn't his time amen and so God watched it over for him so praise the Lord so he went to give a praise report brother Steve if you give him or he did you got the mic okay God bless you brother Joshua last year I just wonder um read a little scripture before I started if that was okay and um this is Leah's favorite chapter and oftentimes when I go to read the Bible she'll ask if we can read this and I'll be like again again but now it's kind of my favorite chapter two and all right Psalm 91 it says because Lord which is my refuge even the most high that I have for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways that's just really close to my heart now um so on Thursday evening I was bringing in my last load for the day and um at one of the Mills right here on the road it's about five minutes from our house and they don't have a loader yet they use a bobcat to unload so I unloaded the bottom bunks and the top one was just eight Footers and they can slide if they get crooked between the standards and come off the trailer so I had done about three poles and I was getting my third one and one of the logs under my Forks turned sideways I didn't know it yet so when I raised up my um forks I just seen the log coming all right towards my window uh so I had like a split second and I just kind of pulled back on the left joist window and um I don't know maybe a 500 pound log or so and uh come right through the window and landed right in my lap and it kept coming towards me and then when the when the other half fell off the trailer then it bounced up and hit the ceiling of the bobcat and so I was kind of in shock I didn't know what happened but I seen a lot of blood and my pants were ripped and I was in a lot of pain so I threw up the bar and tried to get out of the cab and um huh I try to put pressure on my right leg and uh so I was just laying on my back there and I just um called out to the Lord and I just said Lord yes I will get your help right now I really need you and I just prayed out just please don't let my leg be broken and and uh um out there praying for us because I know she was at home so she got about five minutes and um one The Meta Knight boys came out and helped me to the back of the trailer and if I was sitting on the back of the trailer I didn't my I mean my right leg was in a lot of pain and I could feel there was some glass in there and stuff but I was still praying like Lord don't let my leg be broken and um yeah so Aaliyah came and she took me to the hospital and um they got me right in I don't think the wheelchair even stops he texted everybody we're coming in so we got right in and they sent me right into X-rays and gave me some morphine and stuff and um and uh so they got me riding the x-rays and got me into the bed and all x-rays came back negative there was no broke brakes no fractures just anything crazy I love the big bruise I didn't even have to get any stitches or anything like that they just took uh two pieces of glass out of my leg and that was about a bit and they bandaged me up and cleaned it up and sent me home and so just a really big bruise on my right leg but I can imagine that you know like the doctor was saying pretty much every uh situation other than the one you're in is worse when something like that happens you know if it could come towards your chest or could have come towards your face or something like that but I was just super thankful that um the Lord was there with me and yeah I wanted to read one more scripture um brother Byler preached on us and um well it just went Hallelujah God is still on the throne isn't he hey amen watch an operation children amen amen we're blessed people aren't we it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and amen of the lord I can't think of any other announcements I know that hey man it's just have some busy schedule here not real busy but Amen to schedule for September amen a couple weeks we'll have brother John Michael's uh wedding amen and sister Emma so we'll be going down there amen and things like that but anyway so if you would stand with me this morning we'll just get into the word of God and see what the Lord was this morning amen we uh want to speak on something I mean maybe just a little bit different or look at it a little bit different with the help of the Lord this morning amen and I want to have title this how big is God how big is God Amen praise the Lord so yeah and we know there's a song that I remember hearing by a couple of sisters I think when we was before I was married even uh some sisters came from Israel and they sang a song that was called how big is God I believe it was called God that anyway but amen and he they were singing it says he's higher than the mountain taller than the trees deeper than the ocean wider than the Seas he says that's how big God is amen and of course it harmonized and everything it was a real good song Amen and so we wanted to look at it when we know that Jesus said I come from God and I go back to God Amen so whatever God was amen and however God was before he come into the flesh amen he went back to be in that same God Amen and so we'll read some scriptures on it amen and to see what the Lord will have this morning and amen I'm I'm praying about and thinking about maybe uh at the end of the service maybe like maybe have like a a prayer line amen if the Lord wants it amen I just feel kind of going that direction amen and I pray God will come and anoint this morning in a special way amen so if you will let's just get started amen and can we take our time today we'll try not to hold you too long but amen we want to try to just see what the Lord will have for us and I think we'll go uh back to the book of Ephesians if you will Ephesians will start here and look at Ephesians 3 Ephesians 3 and we'll begin with verse uh 14 amen amen before we read let's just power his Lord Jesus we come before you go in the Lord this morning thank the Lord to be able to send be assembled in Your Name Lord knowing that your word has promised that wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you will be in our midst Lord and we're so grateful father to have you in our hearts and with this Lord even in us this morning knowing father that you're going to lead us all the way through Lord and that we have a wonderful and a great God like you deserve to watch over us the guide us to lead us all the days of our life Lord and beyond that father we asked God this morning your best meditation of our heart bless the message wife that I feel you've laid upon my heart the minister Lord come and do exceedingly great abundantly above all that we could ask or think Lord for we ask God for you to come now in a special way and again we thank you Lord for watching over brother Joshua we just know that it was your hand your gardening Angel Lord Jesus watching over him father and we thank you Father for it Lord and we know you do that for each one of your children daily Lord and we're so grateful father for it we are Lord rest in you knowing god that you are our deliverer you are our protection you are our Shield Lord we thank you now father in Jesus Christ named amen and amen chapter 3 verse 14 says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named how many believes that's a very special name amen that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened now notice what Paul's desire is here that you would be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man notice he didn't say outer man he's at the inner man that's the one he Paul was interested in it and that what we're interested in is that inner man amen that Christ in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth the length the length the depth and the height amen so we got the breadth we got the length we got the depth and the height Amen to load the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think according to the power that worketh in us and to him be Glory by the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End amen praise the Lord I just thought about that and Paul said World Without End how many believes you're living in the world that doesn't have an end to it amen we're talking about this eternal world not this earworld but he's talking about Amen to another kind of world God bless you may God add His blessings to the reading in the word you can be seated this morning praise the Lord hallelujah how big is God Amen Hallelujah I'll tell you what when I begin to think about this I mean it reminds me of what brother Branham talked about when he was talking about the eagle the great mother Eagle when she's up there in the cleft of the rock raising her little youngins and then they almost get to the age to where they're getting ready to fly and he kind of demonstrated how that he would uh have that great Mama Eagle would come and he would just uh flutter us like I think he was Isaiah there it says that you know flutter over her young and so forth and she flaps those great wings and gets all the loose feathers out and lets them look at her and admire her and to see how great the the mama Eagle is amen that's what we want to do this morning amen amen I believe that it'll help our faith this is to increase our faith I mean beliefs that faith comes by hearing what the word of God that's right so as we hear the word of God it should amen it should uh you know I don't know what level of Faith each and every one of us come in here with but by the end of the service it should be built up it should be greater the more that we talk about God the more that we talk about his greatness amen amen and we make the statement he says we serve a great big God I mean you serve a great big God and we want to just with the help of the Lord for what's the and look at how great and how big God really is now one thing I've learned and I've looked it up and then but a man goes to saying what talking about when you try to figure God out he says don't ever try to figure God out you can look at that up if you want to he says because you can't figure God out amen he says you have to just believe God take him at his word and that uh you contact God Amen and so you can't never figure it out because I stop Finance Minds amen aren't able to comprehend he is haven't you heard never the phrase that he is incompetent and so you know there's a lot of things like we know that Jesus Christ ascended up on high and amen and he went above uh up into the heavens and so forth and I want to read that scripture but you know on his body and how that it was changed and how he could walk through walls and amen and then he Ascend it but then when G Paul saw him he saw him as a pill or a fire isn't that right then you beg the question sometimes well where is the physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so we know it's somewhere isn't that right and we know that the spirit of Christ is Spirit purifier is now in his church isn't that right that he's here this morning Christ is not just should I say he's not just somewhere else but he's also here in every real genuine believer amen he is with us I'll be with you even in you the end of the world so don't we know that God lives in the human heart amen praise the Lord another scripture in uh Ephesians and chapter 4 and verse 8. now notice wherefore he saith he saith when he ascended up on high he let captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is this what is it but he also descended first into the lower parts of the Earth he that descended is also the same is uh the same also that ascended far above the heavens amen now how many knows we know that yeah there's you know Paul talked about the seventh heaven and third and fourth heaven and so forth amen so we there's a lot we don't understand about what do you mean by different different Heavens well we know that the prophet of God taught us that uh there's seven different dimensions these verse three is light matter in space I believe it is right and that's the world that you live in life matter or time matter in space amen now thinking about that going down the road you know and I was thinking about here we're going through space and it's just a matter of time before I drive wherever I get to I just have to wait now I've got to go through that time and space and matter and so forth that's the world that you and I are living in then he said the fourth dimension of course amen is radio and television and so forth and he even said you know that cancer was a fourth dimensional disease isn't that right and then the fifth imagine we know how many knows where the fifth what The Fifth Dimension is regions of the Lost isn't that right he said The Fifth Dimension is the region of the laws where you know they can't come back here and they can't go to heaven so forth amen it's a dimension of the regions of the lost and then he said the sixth Dimension is what come on class it's where where the Brandon went transported he's one of the Believers where the Saints are now right that's sixth Dimension and then the seven now notice brother bam says he was in that Dimension and he says now I want to see him so wherever Christ was he was you know because we say when you die you go to heaven so that sixth Dimension that's Heaven that's the presence in the presence of God Amen but it's still another Heaven higher there's still another place higher than that amen because they said he's even higher than this so he's way out there folks amen and you can't go that nobody can go there amen there's a lot of things we don't understand just like the devil you know in the revelations you know that it talks about the devil is going to be cast out of Heaven he's going to come down to you and and you know we know the devil's right here there's a lot of things we don't know exactly isn't that right we know there's certain devil around but does he have a righteous as in a court of law he has a right to go to the attorney because he's the prosecuting attorney or the defense attorney and so forth he has the right to go there and have no before they throw in the Dawn and accuse you remember one day he's gonna be thrown out he won't go on that'll be over with amen there's so much when you realize we realized we really don't know our scope our minds can't comprehend it even brother Ben remember when he went over there he says there's no words I can't really count the ABCs really don't express to you how great that sixth Dimension is or the reasons to say I can't really tell it's Sublime Perfection isn't really the word it's not good enough it's it's greater than what you can imagine all he did when he did could come back he says just whatever you do don't miss it amen I like what the Bible says you know the most important thing in the world is your relationship with Jesus Christ and you really can't say that enough because everything you did this week it's all vanity it really don't matter beans what you're doing right now is the most important thing that we've done all week whenever we come together and we worship God in the spirit of the new truth ain't nothing more important when we come and we feed on the word that God ain't nothing more important than the feet on the word of God can they tell it to me again oh my you've heard it all before I don't care I want to hear it again oh it's getting so bored I don't have any new things to say this on the other I'm gonna tell you right now then tell me again about Grace one more time because when I've been there ten thousand years and then I'll still want you to tell me I'm saying to me the song of Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound it'll never get old to me all right praise be to God amen done notice you went into the heavens of heavens above all Heavens he went into the highest Heaven that there is that's where he is way up there somewhere if you notice over Revelations 1 amen he says you know uh in verse 8 he says I am the alpha I am the Omega how many knows you can find that in Isaiah where he calls him the first and the last here he finds again he's again he's the first he's the last he's the beginning and he's the ending saith the Lord which is which was and which is to come be Almighty God before there was even an atom in the air before there was anything there was nothing but God everywhere [Applause] and he filled all space and all times [Music] try to pack that in your little brain will you [Music] that's how big he is he I am he which was which is which is to come he fills all space out there and to infinity and beyond so that big he's out there all space that's big you're gonna realize he's much bigger than any of your little problems foreign the Bible says he is all and he is in all these are all in all he's all and easy now and he's in his church and you and I amen see some people think well if he's up there in his body he can't be down here don't don't talk talk to me about God limiting God don't try to put God in a box huh amen oh my now but begin to read uh scripture and I had to go back and look at where it was the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him I thought maybe that was in Genesis or not Genesis but if Ephesians but I found it in Revelations 1 the first chapter the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him amen now he says oh I love that don't you Revelation what is revelation it's something he said the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what the Bible is the Bible is revealed Jesus Christ now Omar he says I get back there and I get to get religious right away or feeling that way see Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Joshua all of them even the Army job Ruth all of them is a revelation of Jesus Christ that he and him might dwell that covers all space and all time amen and all that eternity holds is Jesus Christ amen and all these little things here is just seeds for that great remeeding day when the human race will be introduced to the resurrection to Jesus Christ so we're sitting here this morning and these are just little things these are seeds that's taking us to meet him in person how many is that for that but he fills all space all that eternity holds he said he covers it all all of them revive this entire Bible it's the Revelation showing us who God is what he is oh that is full of love that he's full look compassion amen mom my my thought I would say that's quite a big God wouldn't you he's a big God Isaiah 40 God puts it this way have you not know [Applause] we're hearing it this morning right from the beginning Hallelujah have you not understood from the foundations of the Earth that it is he that setth upon the circle of the Earth and all the inhabitants thereof are as grasshopper [Music] oh my how many of those God is out there looking down oh my when you think about it now listen that's true that just out the heavens as a curtain and spread at them out as they tend they can't my he spread up the whole thing and it's just a tent to him my goodness I don't know about you but I like a house don't you brother Brad just a little tent enough to get you bad in this out of the other just a tent for God to dwell in amen how big is god well let's just see what the Bible says 66-1 he says thus saith the Lord the heaven is my throne Earth is my footstool and he feels all of Heaven he puts his feet on the Earth that's what the footstool is that's how God is amen wow the Earth Is His footstool then brother Bannon when he preached uh what was it statue of a perfect man I believe he talked about he says he took that scripture and he also took the scriptures where but a body has now perverted the place of my dwelling but a body has thou prepared me and of course he ties that to us to you and I that it's in you deny that he dwells amen but we think well that's all there is no he feels all time and space he's he's a great big God folks build fun to me how many knows he he even said that the Solomon I believe it was Stephen that was preaching to uh the Pharisees and so forth when he was preaching about Salem wanted to build him a house but God said twice what house are you gonna build me things that I created Heavens the fourth Heavens is my uh my Heaven since my Throne Earth is my foot Paul and David I'm going to build your house he says what are you gonna build me what's going to fit me in it friends what am I gonna fit in that well I hear that's what I hear but how's he going to build me when Heavens is my throne and Earth is my footstool amen Hallelujah we have a great big God amen and how many of those let me let me just let me finish this and then we'll go to the next part I think about it I mean this God didn't want to dwell alone so right answer not you me he wanted to live with you and me and he does come on is he living with you or not is it the place that he's happy the place that he's resting is in your heart praise the place of my arrest why do we really find that season something no it's in Christ amen oh we're a privileged people folks amen let me just say this while it comes to mind God is such a great great God that he can make himself so little that if you and I aren't careful and most of humanity this goes right over the top of him he hides himself from the wall rise in the prudent you know isn't it something how that some of us maybe have an IQ of smart whippersnapper you are one smart they're smart people I'd hate to have to have somebody take you know test my IQ amen amen like what word can you add two letters to and make it shorter anyway we won't go there ER it's stored short short add two letters to a short in the ER he got shorter that it's a simple one but it's kind of an IQ test see if you can catch that or not I don't know about you but I'd probably missing a million miles off and about my accused but if when you think about the intelligence think about how many knows now because they've got it omniscient omniscient what is that all-knowing all knowledge he is oh my you you can't there is no skill for his to test his IQ for each little finite Minds have a hundred hundred wow no think about God and how smart he is that's why aren't you glad that you're a sheep you're just supposed to be led you don't have to figure it all out you don't have to think about it all oh just be led by the Wonder that's the smartest in the universe he'll lead you right it's one place he said don't think about what you're going to say whenever you're picked up taken before judges and so forth you know synagogues he said don't think it'll be giving you let him talk to you oh my it'll be given to you what to say amen he's all knowing he's omnipresent omniperson omniscient all-knowing oh the scribes and the Pharisees they found out didn't they dick they tried to get him the Bible slowly says they tried to catch him in his words you know uh about marriage and divorce about the coin about whether you should pay tax the other thing ask him any more questions just like the devil he tried to contempt to me man when he tried to tempt them and so forth amen he got his feathers burned he got cinched he got fried he was defeated amen why because you're talking to the master of all all knowledge so his his knowledge is immeasurable his presence is immeasurable omnipresent he's everywhere dang a part of it that he don't feel wow aren't you glad he fills that part in you wherever you are wherever you go oh when you leave church today he isn't going to stay here and leave you off by yourself when you get up the dangerous things and happen things like that he's not awesome where amen praise be to God now so not Otis what house and where is the place of my rest for all those things have mine handmade and all those things have been saith the Lord but isn't it something I'll just go off the subject for a little but the this man will I look wow all these things I'm not looking to that this is what I'm looking at but to this man will I look even to him that is of a poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word how many beliefs we ought to have a real respect for God's word if you want to catch God's attention have respect tremble at his word God said it God said it oh I don't want to go across that Lord help me to believe it let me accept it Lord I'm traveling God don't let me ever not believe it huh trembleth at my word back to Isaiah 40 he says and we'll begin with verse 15 behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as a small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the owls as a very little thing verse 17 All Nations before him are as nothing wow they are counted unto him less than nothing and vanity oh think about the great Empire of Romer Greece or uh uh Nebuchadnezzar and that great Empire and or America how superpowering Russia oh Russia huh isn't that somehow Russia can't even take if he's a little Nation beside it that didn't even have a military army don't shoot at me but that's the truth how many knows they've been trying to defeat him for all these years and we had a dad to borrow the weapons hey can y'all give us some more weapons we're fighting Russia why you'd have thought Russ should take somebody down in no time but how many knows what they do have which is nuclear there's still nothing to be messed with but as far as their domestic Army is not the whole lot from what I've seen but they're nothing America all this greatness all of this he said Bob says they just they don't amount to a hill of beans that's why he says you know we are the value what is the most valuable thing is Christ anything outside of Christ we feel about it the way that God feels about it if the Nations it don't mean much to God there's only one thing that amounts to anything and that's Christ even Jesus said without me you can't do nothing you're nothing without Christ [Music] ain't nobody not nothing without Christ and he says they're even less than nothing less than nothing how in the world I don't know how to explain it other than you know if you didn't have any bills and nobody nobody had anything and you might not have a thing you might be nothing but it's less than that because you owe all kinds of that you're deep in that you're less than nothing I ordered that I could not pay people's gonna have to pay for their sin they're gonna have to pay for their own belief people will take me taking the judgment and have to give account for it even Jesus said about Judas he doesn't have been better if he would have never been born I'll come here to tell you you don't know God it'd have been better for you never would have been born less than nothing because all Christians realize that the world is good all of our world the things it don't mean nothing it is not thing it is our relationship with God's Liberties right because the nations in the world it's just a small thing to God it ain't no big deal this little life that we live for 60 70 years it ain't nothing the only thing that means anything is when he gives you eternal life when he fills you with the Holy Ghost and you know you're a son and daughter of God oh my let me tell you something friends we ought to we got to realize that we as Christians we who are living in the Asia we're living in we have so much all the Christians down to the Dark Ages they didn't they didn't have they didn't have the things that you and I did not for their release team we still can't worship God we still can't give God the glory and honor that's due to his name folks folks it's time it's time to come here to tell you we just get back and a little silly for God Amen you just have to forgive me but I don't mind asking stupid for God he's the only one that's worth distracting stupid boy what some people call stupid God calls glorious and screaming and shouting and praising God he is great the Bible says that he is great and he is to be greatly praised [Music] my God is foreign [Applause] greatly to be honored coming to the church and we just filled our hands come on folks he's not worried about go off for your maggot eating steak to somebody else God don't want it when you come to God you give him your best not your football game not your business not your bank account give God your all give God your best hey man praise the Lord he feels it all I'm glad he feels my heart aren't you glad that little boy that's not in there folks if you don't get it filled with God you'll go after drink you'll go after dope you'll go after lust you'll go after this that or the other he'll try to satisfy it somehow amen but I'm glad that I don't have to satisfy I'm satisfied with just to cut it below a little something like oh why because I have him and I'm content God lead us with content of this great day you know how much it's worth to know that when you play your best you head in bed at night know that if you don't wake up hey man you ain't gotta worry in the world oh I'm so glad for that we shook a big God praise be to God you love it listen brother I'm saying here oh what a picture as the True Vine here we are the branches and he is divine just as Divine moves so does the Branch's roof is that right how beautiful then of his great body oh his great bleeding arms and dropping tears and his bleeding sides his Strike Back a hanging over the Earth like this between God the Father And The Mortals of this Earth did you get the picture I'm getting he's hanging over the Earth bleeding thighs remember the vision brother said that blood that is covered the Earth keep keeping the bumper keeping from coming to the father every time you make mistakes you'd be guilty worthy of death but it comes and works as a buffer here he paints a picture of his body hanging over the Earth there amen like between God and so forth the pleading and loving them as his body comes into motion and power is given into the church just as he says if I move my hands this way his literal body moves go here preach the gospel you'll see that church move right straight because why my shadow has to move with my hands how many believe that's what we like to see in a church amen we don't want to see the CH start moving up brother Byler we don't want to see you are moving we want to see them moving of the Holy Ghost he just moves his hand and the body follows wherever that shadow is we're like the shadow I mean whatever God says do folks I'm here to tell you my Prime my brain and my head is so attached to my head we think it says I'm from my body to do my body does it perfectly why we agree with God like that I'm telling you about we be a different people every move that he says to make make it my body obeys it perfectly move up arms move cross arms lift your leg up put it down when God gets a chance like that folks we'll be ready to leave this place amen Hallelujah [Music] that's right oh my just think of that his body moving going you into all the world demonstrate the power no matter about our Theology and teachings and so forth we bitterly fail because we go by theology instead of the anointing of the spirit isn't that right but now the hand of God is moving signs and what wonders are appearing is that exactly right he moved Malachi for on the scene of his hand going all over the wall hey man how many middle Seas had seen the move of God In Our Generation through Malachi 4. it's crazy isn't it how can people be so blind not believe God in what he does amen let me go on I stretched him out as a tent to dwell in amen that bringeth the princess to nothing make it the judges of the earth as vanity verse 25 to whom will ye liken me and twice he says it this is in verse 25 and also in verse 18 to whom will you liking God or what likeness will you compare unto him amen who is comparable the devil I don't know about you but the devil is no comparison to God all right God always wins when he does something the devil always loses he can't create nothing he has to be manipulate pervert whatever he does God then got to do all that amen my now notice whom were you liking who's to whom shall I be equal saith the Holy One lift up your eyes on high amen I like that's what we're doing this morning we're lifting up our eyes get it off to things of the world down here let's look up to him see how great he is on high and behold who had created the thing oh I could have me a jubilee this morning when I just think about everything he's made how many times a new time he says and without him with nothing created that was created were created by Him and without him there was nothing created that was created he made my ads to worship him he made my feet to walk in his footsteps he made my heart for a dwelling place for him he'd made my lips to praise him he made my mind to think his thoughts he created hey did you how many times do we praise God for that thank you Lord that's all said Thank you Lord for creating me hallelujah thank you Jesus amen who has created all things that bringeth out their host by number he called them by their names by their greatness of his might that he might for that he is strong in power not one second he never fails hast thou not known has thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the hands of the earth he changes not neither is weary there is no searching of misunderstanding Glory [Music] amen brother Brandon took us into creation he talks about atoms and molecules and and germs and all the way down and then where does it go from that then he says he goes back to gases and then from there we get lost goes back all we do is believe that God said it I believe it that settled that's it you ain't got to figure it out God knows amen no searching he'd giveth power to the faith and to them that have no no might he increases strength Hallelujah aren't you glad he's just strength Giver amen even the youth shall faint and be weary the young men shall utterly fail but then it wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as egos they shall run though how do we get the more of that quickening power we need we need some of that oh I'm here to tell you okay like the Lord is my Sanctus God Alone is my strength God is my strength he's your strength Hallelujah we need more his quickening power he gives strength to the weary renew their strength they shall not up with wings they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint praise God let's look at one more thing here before we go further that is it's omnipotent omnipotent all-powerful don't try to figure it out because his power is infinite he has infinite Limitless unlimited power we built the pyramids but I'm saying it's a great thing a man ever did probably built the two pyramids how did they do it ain't nothing to God he made the big ball that built the Pyramid he made the rocks to build it out of hung the moon hung the Stars harmed the galaxies he did all of that you see how weak our fake you can see why Jesus says oh you have little faith oh you have little faith God help our faith to know that God is in control guess my love we could have been having a funeral tomorrow since Julia foreign [Music] God keeps and he watches over us he has his hand on you he just puts his hand right there devil wants to try to do something even better bam said you know the gun's blowing up and and different ones the brothers he says the devil was trying to kill us but God wouldn't let it amen praise be to God again I'll just say I can't think of the name so I'll just hold off on it all right praise the Lord you love him this morning we're gonna take our time is that all right but a man was talking to a doctor he was studying to be a preacher and he said there's nothing really to it then brother Branham got to talking to him he says you know you can take an extra machine and you can look through the human body and all of that but you can only go as far as what science will let you he says but the tree of faith of God is unlimited amen you believe science is any more than step off and start believing from then on I said that's the way you have to do see amen how many knows that with God nothing is impossible and then God said as if God is in you with you nothing shall be impossible how many beliefs that man you you believe that whatever you you ask in my name I will do it finger and I want to talk about God's shoulder amen first thing we know is that a man and a woman were made differently isn't that right we were made differently now the world tries to say now they're really the same you can convert anytime you want to they're a bunch of liars you were born in a certain way amen you know now when he built a woman he built her feminine she's not right oh he didn't give her big biceps and triceps I guess it is I'm not sure which is which but you know it's like a bodybuilder when he made a man think of the biggest body Arnold Schwarzenegger out there and look at them bulging muscles a better band said when he's seen his daddy he said when he looked at his daddy he'd roll up them sleeves and he washed and he'd tease that muscle go up and back down I believe he said you know he'd see that muscle he says oh I won't be like my daddy I won't be like my daddy so strong you know one place brother bam says that God even loves to show his power he loves to show off his muscles do we have a daughter Among Us if you don't believe it listen to this if I can find the right quick let's hope I can or I'm gonna be really uh it's Romans not Hebrews he likes to show how many believe God likes to show how powerful he is he likes to show you show me how powerful he is he said about pharaoh Romans 9 and verse 17 for the scripture sayeth unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power and they and that my name might be declared through all the Earth Hallelujah my name might be declared through all yours here we are 2023 and we're still talking about it we're still sad wow God what you did down there was simply amazing you took your finger God took his finger and brought pharaoh to his knees all he has to do is take his little tip of his finger that's all he has to do huh and they did so and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smoked the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and in beast and in the dust of the land became life throughout all the land of Egypt and The Magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lives but they could not so there were lies upon man and upon beasts and The Magicians said unto Pharaoh this is the Finger of God this is the Finger of God but he hearkened not unto them another place as you know I'm going to take my arm and we're going to deliver Israel I'm going to hardens out but I'm going to take my arm and I'm going to deliver Israel amen God is so great that all he has to do is use his finger a little bit of his finger that's all you all you need is a touch from his finger amen praise the Lord it doesn't take a whole lot can you imagine no doubt but the Finger of God or the arm of God come down and the greatest walls perhaps that man could build Jericho great big walls chariots and everything else the Finger of God and just go please it don't take much you know don't take much you got to just flip them over what did they what did the Israelites have to do just do what God Said shout a little amen I wonder sometimes we don't get our walls to fall cause we ain't got enough shout in US just shout out to the Lord that depressional girl praise God Amen another place amen I'll tell you either Paul and Silas were in the inner prison the inner prison way down lockdown and the Bible set the earthquake they were praying and they were singing songs they were praising God they were conducting themselves conducting themselves with joy in the midst the trial of God allowed them to go through God so loved the dead he just shook that gate sugar there's the earthquake open up the gate let me tell you something you just stand in where God wants you to stand I mean if you're in the line of duty God will take his finger and knock all those big walls how many babies Jesus is the same yesterday today in free Fields all time space folks if you've got walls this morning need knocked down God can knock him out you're in the in the prison I don't care if you're caught in sin or whatever it is you're trapped it won't let you go amen just call on God rely on him he'll come he'll change the situation for you I believe in the present God that changes you today that'll do something for you today that'll fill you with the Holy Ghost if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you can be filled right now amen a lot of things God can just use his finger for amen all right Luke 11. and 20. we're gonna look at another place where God just has to use his fingers amen [Music] Luke 11. and I had a quote to go along with this right here in verse 18. if Satan be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that I cast out devil through Beelzebub and if I by Beelzebub cast out Devils by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be your judges but if I if I with the Finger of God cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of God is come unto you so whenever the god whenever he cast out Devils he'd use his little fingers go go good one don't need to do that just little finger maybe it's Pinky go you need that devil going just let the God use his pinky on you just the finger that's all he needs amen not his whole body huh listen to this look I want you to notice oh no matter how great a disease or how much Affliction the devil can put on you it just takes the Finger of God to move it oh my look at the great big strong shoulders and arms and muscles just his finger moves every disease and casts out devils what little thing the devil is he just takes his finger and moves him away then oh my so whatever it is all you little things you just need the Finger of God to move it let's take the shoulder how many wants to hear about God's shoulders amen now let me show you the love of God that when a sheep is lost he didn't use his finger he said he would lay him upon his shoulders he took his whole being amen his whole being hands sheep around his shoulder the strongest most powerful part of a man is across his shoulders and back have you ever had a hard job pushing a car or something odd man put your back into it when it comes to getting his lost sheep God puts his back into it all right this is going to take a little more I'm gonna have to get my shoulders my back and my muscles my leg we're gonna have to push I'ma have to go down there am I gonna have to come down make myself weak I'm gonna have to become sin Amen to the day we can become the righteousness of God I'm gonna have to come to the Earth and I'm gonna have to become a wit mortal all right but I'm gonna have to give it all I got but the man says in the Garden of Gethsemane and then Jesus wept and he fought like never before don't you think it wasn't a real Temptation don't think he was in the struggle it was a struggle Jesus fought he battled every devil why because he was going to come and deliver you he gonna give it his all he man he fought every devil to come to him he felt sickness disease Amen brother from the game not that so much ain't nobody had to fight death

takes off her bail and he placed it over on the groom's shoulders signify that not only is she under his Dominion we can stop there for a minute aren't you glad this morning that you're under his

Superman is that right but he found that he was kind of like a lot of us his faith was a little weak and he began to look around on the symptoms keep your eyes on Jesus amen keep your eyes on him praise be the god oh my now listen to this he has the responsibility and care and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility of course brother Benham went into the clergy in different ones that try to control God's people to God's children and God's people amen he says there's only one that has a right to take care of her amen she did not come on her own she did not choose him he chose her he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price a man who shot to lay anything to the charge of God's elect it's God that justify amen praise be to God you love him so that's right praise be to God Sammy believes that God is a great big God he's so big he sits up there on the circle of the Earth Heavens is the heavens are his throne Earth Is His footstool he sits on the circle of the earth is what it said and the inhabitants are like grasshoppers and he says one place man he said the grass all flesh is grass We Are Young strong handsome oh my but after a while we're old and feeble and we can't do what we used to do amen I can come to the age by the time I call myself an old geezer yeah these old geezer just can't I looked up the word geezer and it said something about an older guy that's stuck in his old ways that wasn't too bad so anyway as long as these old ways are right here amen so I thank God for every bit of strength I have hello amen all right praise the Lord God is good isn't he what he did for us how he supplies for us he's a great big God sits up back to the circle of the earth sits up there one day one of his children had a need and guess what he reaches over and no doubt takes his hand grabs the Sun stops it reaches over with his other hand say Moon you gotta stop too because Joshua said Son you stand still in Moon you stay where you're at reaches over all right son I'm gonna hold him right there looks down and says go ahead fight your battle down there go ahead keep idling folks I'm here to tell you if God will stop the sun and the moon for one of his children what will he do for you this morning [Applause] what will he do for us [Applause] there's no Talent what he'll do I do know one thing that we preach and we preach and we preach and we preach and we preach and it does US good foreign but there comes a time when you've got to exercise what you hear and what you preach exercise it and I thought Lord help us to exercise our faith amen I'm going to come down to the closing here faith is built that God is able to take care of you he's much bigger than any of your problems anything that comes your way he's more more than able just a couple scriptures I said closing but I really want to I want to talk about the touch of Jesus when he was here because most of the time if you talk about touching or touch every time Jesus did anything he was always almost always talk about and he touched them he touched him he just touched him in Matthew 8 and verse 1 and when there came down from the mountain great multitudes followed him and behold there came a leper and worshiped him saying Lord if thou will thou can'tst make me clean wow I think another didn't one is as if thou Wilt make me cold or whatever this guy's saying you know if thou will thou can't make me clean in other words I know that you can if you want to am I reading this right if thou wilt thou can'tst make me clean and Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed over in chapter verse 14 of the same chapter and when Jesus came was come into Peter's house he saw his wife's mother laid sick of a fever and he touched her and the fever left and she arose and ministered unto them when even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast them cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick how many remembers we have one instance where the woman which had a blood issue went through the Press through the crowd and touched the Hem of His Garment and was made whole remember it's either Jesus touching you that heals you are you touching Jesus oh touching Jesus is all that really matters oh he touched me oh he touched me and oh the joy that floods my soul see he touches you or you touch him here's a here's a case and I didn't really realize it but another place he says and when they were gone over they came into the land of the God can necessaret and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out all and into all the country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased and besought him that they might only touch the Hem of His Garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole amen how many believes it's important to be touched by the master I mean they'll come this morning think about it and even when you got saved when God revealed himself he touched you I mean please he touches you your life will never ever be the same amen now let's come to the conclusion John 14. 12 says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me The Works that I do shall he do also a greater than these shall he do because I go unto the father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name what will I do father may be glorified in the son if you ask any thing in my name I will do it remember they said if you'll that first one he says you know if thou Wilt that counts me he said what did Jesus say I will be thou clean here we have a promise that if we ask anything he in his name he will do it before we have a prayer line I want you to think about what you really have need of think about it amen while I'm reading uh reading this here quote listen she was talking about the tree of faith is unlimited and so forth you can never exhaust God's love or Mercy for you you say well I hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered that way he does don't ever think that you could ask too much of God I believe the scripture says you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not amen how many knows another place he says he he wants us to ask and believe that our Joys may be full he wants you to ask abundantly as for big things he's a big God ask for big things got children that are lost hello folks I remember when Caleb stray you know how many times me and my wife we prayed we ask God lord be back bring me back oh my and he did brought him back love the Lord and sometimes I wonder if it is a little more than me so I know he's close to God he says a lot of times it used to be you I think well this little thing don't matter and that little thing don't matter but I'm telling you he said Dad after everything literally thing will you do it means a lot it's either right or wrong you're either pleasing to God or you're not pleasing to God I thought that's right son I don't mind every movie you watch every music you listen to he'll tell me you know God's not pleased with all of that stuff and you can't just think you know you can do that and please God amen but ask big things gotta Lancer how many believes that amen don't be like that little fish out in the ocean at a great big ocean oh I better take swallow water sparingly amen I might run out no it's a great big ocean God is a great big God or be like a little mouse down in the Green Hills of Egypt when they had all of that seven years food startup for everybody hello I don't know about you but I want to be like that little mouse now I'm gonna say I'm gonna get good and fat because how many remember brother bam says you know when you're planted in Christ you're planting the Christ all you have to do is water that feed that and water drink more than what you have to how many leaves if you want more of Christ everything that you have need of is on the inside of you just feed it more just drink more there's a lot of grain there's a lot of food [Music] I believe there's a lot of a lot of Supply that he has my God shall supply all your need musicians if you come maybe play something softly but without it breaking the atmosphere anybody every any one of you that wants to come up and you want to ask me and brother Brad to pray

be ashamed of God if I'm ashamed of him he'll be ashamed of me on that date amen amen thank you there there you go praise the Lord and when we pray for you you believe that you'll receive it amen not
