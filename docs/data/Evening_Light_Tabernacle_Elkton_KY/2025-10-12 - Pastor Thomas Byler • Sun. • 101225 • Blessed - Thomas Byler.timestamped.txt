[18:31] Good morning.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; I thought you children could be
[18:35] dismissed to Sunday school.
[18:44] Brother Josh, would you stand up and
[18:46] open the service in a word of prayer?
[19:27] Amen. Let's stand and turn our Bibles to
[19:31] Psalms 90.
[19:40] Say amen when you got it.
[19:48] Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place
[19:52] in all generations.
[20:04] Thou turnest men to destruction, and
[20:07] sayest, "Return, ye children of men."
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Thou carest them away as with a flood.
[20:20] They are asleep. In the morning, in the
[20:23] morning, they are like grass, which
[20:25] groweth up.
[20:33] For we are consumed by thy thine anger,
[20:36] and by thy wrath are we troubled.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; For all our days are passed away in thy
[20:48] wrath. We spend our years as a tale that
[20:51] is told.
[21:08] who knoweth the power of thine anger,
[21:10] even according to thy fear, so is thy
[21:13] wrath.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Return, O Lord, how long? And let it
[21:23] repent thee concerning thy servants.
[21:34] Make us glad according to the days
[21:36] wherein thou hast afflicted us and the
[21:39] years wherein we have seen evil.
[21:48] And let the beauty of the Lord our God
[21:51] be upon us, and establish thou the work
[21:54] of our hands upon us. Yay, the work of
[21:57] our hands, establish thou it. Amen.
[22:01] God bless you, Brother Brian.
[22:07] needed.
[22:21] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[22:24] If you would uh
[22:26] turn with me, excuse me, turn with me to
[22:29] the third chapter of Colossians.
[22:33] I was um going to say um from last week
[22:37] what people what people gave me as
[22:41] offering and stuff uh the rock that was
[22:44] put last week is all uh is all paid for
[22:48] and the church is pretty pretty close to
[22:50] still having uh 10 it's not 10 it's
[22:54] about 9,000 and change that's in the
[22:56] general fund. I I was uh which can be
[23:03] you know I was I was thinking
[23:06] how important is for us as believers as
[23:09] Christians this morning that we stay
[23:12] sealed into Jesus Christ this morning
[23:14] because I was just thinking the
[23:16] circumstances that surround us every day
[23:18] of our lives just like the past couple
[23:21] of weeks the brothers have been
[23:23] preaching to us that we really need to
[23:26] be sealed in. We need to have everything
[23:31] pushed out of our lives that's contrary
[23:33] to the word of God and be ready for when
[23:36] God calls us home. And I would I was
[23:39] just thinking out there and it what like
[23:42] the brothers were saying, you know, you
[23:44] can spend too much time doing useless
[23:47] things, but you can never spend enough
[23:49] time in God's word. And it's only in
[23:51] God's word that you'll be become a
[23:54] perfected Christian this morning. It's
[23:56] only in the message of the hour and
[23:58] reading your Bible this morning that
[24:00] you'll become perfected. That the things
[24:02] that you used to care about won't mean
[24:04] anything to you anymore. And you all you
[24:07] care about is what God wants you to do
[24:09] in your life.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; And I I was there a simple thought came
[24:16] this morning. I'll get to the first
[24:18] verse in Colossians here, the third
[24:20] chapter. I was thinking there's a spirit
[24:23] out there that's trying to move people.
[24:27] I was just thinking sitting there, we
[24:30] know that the scripture says that every
[24:33] you know the in Revelations it says all
[24:36] whose names were not written in the
[24:38] lamb's book of life will be deceived
[24:41] that that the that spirit of delusion
[24:44] will come upon them. And you can see it
[24:46] moving in the in the day that can I say
[24:48] it'll be tomorrow? No. I'm a man. I
[24:51] can't say that. Will it be a year from
[24:53] now? Will it be a week from now? We
[24:55] don't know the day or the hour. But we
[24:57] can look at the circumstances in the
[24:59] world this morning and know that we live
[25:01] in a late day. And you could never say
[25:04] that enough. The very
[25:07] world is warning people that you don't
[25:10] have the time anymore that you think you
[25:12] used to have and that you need to be
[25:14] serious about your relationship with
[25:17] Jesus Christ this morning. But I was
[25:19] thinking what's going on in the world,
[25:22] the foundations of everything are being
[25:24] shaken. And you know, like brother
[25:27] Brandham said, I was I was just the
[25:29] thought I get through, you know, I
[25:31] listen to a different ministers on
[25:33] YouTube, which can be I mean a good or a
[25:36] bad thing if you're not grounded. And
[25:38] notice I say you have to be grounded.
[25:40] You have to know what you believe
[25:42] &gt;&gt; or I wouldn't. But I was just thinking
[25:44] it's they're all trying to move you
[25:47] somewhere and where they're trying to
[25:49] move you to is not a good place. The
[25:52] only thing that'll move you to the right
[25:54] place is the message of the hour. And
[25:56] anyone telling you anything else than
[25:58] that is actually lying to you this
[26:01] morning and you need to stop listening
[26:03] to them. But what I thought was funny is
[26:07] people are leaving
[26:09] the Christian churches, the non-atholic
[26:12] or orthodox or Lutheran churches.
[26:14] They're leaving those Protestant
[26:16] churches and going back whether it's the
[26:18] Catholic or the Orthodox churches and
[26:21] they're having people are joining them
[26:23] in great numbers. And I was just
[26:24] thinking what would make people want to
[26:26] do that and and it goes back to exactly
[26:30] what I said the first sentence I said
[26:31] this morning. They're not grounded in
[26:34] the word of God this morning. And don't
[26:36] let anyone ever tell you that because
[26:38] you're a Christian in the year 2025 that
[26:42] what you believe doesn't go back to the
[26:45] beginning. Because what you believe this
[26:46] morning goes back to the beginning. And
[26:49] I was just thinking, they'll try to tell
[26:51] you that their church is the oldest
[26:53] church, they have the longest church, or
[26:56] we have this or we have that. And really
[26:59] struck me this morning. I'll just turn
[27:01] to it.
[27:03] You know, the Orthodox Church and the
[27:05] Catholic Church will tell you this
[27:06] morning that they're they're the real
[27:08] church because they go all the way back
[27:11] to the beginning. And I I'm not trying
[27:13] to be funny about this this morning, but
[27:15] I really find it striking. Anytime
[27:18] someone tells you something, then you
[27:20] know what I would you do? You have to go
[27:22] back to the word of God. You have to
[27:24] bring them back to the word of God. It's
[27:26] not my idea, not their idea. It's what
[27:28] the word of God has to say. And not
[27:31] trying to be funny here this morning,
[27:33] but I was thinking you all this morning
[27:35] can say that you belong to the original
[27:37] church, the unadulterated original
[27:40] church of the word of God this morning.
[27:42] You belong to that church. It's not a
[27:45] Catholic church. It's not an Orthodox
[27:47] church. It's not a Lutheran church. It's
[27:49] not a Bath church. It's a bloodwashed
[27:52] church that you belong to. And when they
[27:54] say, "Well, we we go all the way back to
[27:56] Peter." Well, what comes to my mind, if
[27:59] their church went all the way back to
[28:01] Peter, then what would they do? They
[28:03] would do what Peter did. They would do
[28:05] what Paul did. And and uh and I'll just
[28:09] read this here this morning and then
[28:11] I'll get back into Colossians.
[28:14] But uh let me I would take them back to
[28:16] the second chapter of Acts and they'll
[28:19] say well Peter was our first you know
[28:22] he'll whatever they call Peter whether
[28:24] it's Orthodox Protestant or Lutheran.
[28:27] Now Lutheran don't believe that Peter
[28:29] the church is built on Peter they
[28:31] believe it's built on Jesus Christ. We
[28:34] all believe it's bu built on the
[28:35] revelation of the word of God. But I'll
[28:38] just you they read this every every time
[28:41] that there's a baptism. Every morning we
[28:44] have or evening we have a baptism they
[28:46] read these scriptures. But Jesus is
[28:48] given the keys. I mean Peter is given
[28:50] the keys to the kingdom after the day of
[28:53] Pentecost. And what does he do? He opens
[28:56] the word of God and he opens salvation
[28:58] to the people. You've all probably read
[29:00] this a thousand times, a hundred times
[29:02] depending on your age. Well, this is
[29:04] where I would take them back to. Then if
[29:07] you believe Peter was your pope or Peter
[29:09] was the first man that the church is
[29:11] built on, have you done what he told you
[29:13] to do this morning? So I'll start
[29:16] reading from about the u
[29:19] about the 36th verse and I'll finish
[29:21] with the 47th. You know, like I said, if
[29:24] you don't have anything to say, if you
[29:26] just read the word of God, it speaks for
[29:28] itself this morning. Therefore, let all
[29:30] the house of Israel know assuredly that
[29:32] God had made the same Jesus whom you
[29:35] have crucified both Lord and Christ. So
[29:39] everything, the whole everything is
[29:41] framed in Jesus Christ this morning.
[29:43] That you can't have anything foundation
[29:46] outside of that. It's not built on a
[29:48] man's idea. It's not built on anything
[29:50] this morning but Jesus Christ and the
[29:52] word of God. And he goes on to say, "Now
[29:55] you have heard this that and they were
[29:57] pricricked in their hearts and said unto
[29:59] Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[30:02] men and brethren, what do what shall we
[30:05] do?" And I want to I'll finish with this
[30:07] period here. Just remember that they all
[30:10] 120 of them were in the upper room, all
[30:12] the apostles, the women that followed
[30:15] Jesus, Jesus's mother was with him,
[30:17] everybody was there that day. And he
[30:20] goes and then he says, "Peter said unto
[30:23] them, repent and be baptized every one
[30:25] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[30:27] the remission of sins and ye shall
[30:30] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." And
[30:33] this one scripture right here divides
[30:37] you divides everybody this morning. It
[30:40] that's what I would tell I would ask
[30:42] them, "Have you fulfilled this word of
[30:44] God this morning?" And of course, you
[30:45] know exactly what they're going to say.
[30:47] They're going to immediately start
[30:49] explain it away. But if you've got that
[30:52] fundamental faith this morning, they'll
[30:54] never be able to explain it away. And
[30:56] I'll just finish these verses here. And
[30:59] for as with many other words did he
[31:01] testify and exalt, saying, "Save
[31:02] yourselves from this unto generation." I
[31:06] missed the 39th verse there. And then
[31:09] they were gladly received the word and
[31:11] were baptized the same day were were
[31:13] added about 3,000 souls. and they
[31:16] continued steadfast in the apostles
[31:18] doctrine and fellowship and breaking
[31:20] bread and in prayers. And I'll I'll just
[31:22] finish jumping into uh
[31:25] Colossians the third chapter this
[31:28] morning. I was also thinking especially
[31:31] what the brother said last Sunday and
[31:34] brother Brad on Wednesday. You know
[31:38] there's two type of people in any
[31:40] church. There's the well-fed person and
[31:44] the stick man in the church or the stick
[31:46] woman in the church. And that's I don't
[31:48] mean to be funny. The stick woman or the
[31:49] stick man is the man that it just goes
[31:52] right across the top of their head and
[31:54] goes out the walls and they never
[31:56] receive it. So, one is growing on the
[31:58] word of God and the other one is dying
[32:00] on the word of God. And only God knows
[32:02] who that individual is. And I was just
[32:04] thinking it would be a horrible thing to
[32:06] spend your whole life thinking you're
[32:09] okay but never receiving the truth as
[32:11] God presents it to you. You know the one
[32:14] thing
[32:18] go as you're led to go. But it's really
[32:21] I I can't say it enough. I know I see it
[32:24] in my own life as I get older.
[32:27] All the things I say this a lot. I'm not
[32:29] afraid to say this. All the things that
[32:31] I thought I were important when I was 20
[32:34] or 40, those things aren't important
[32:36] anymore. What's important to me is is it
[32:40] settled, you know, is it right in my
[32:42] heart and in my life this morning. I'll
[32:44] just read this in Colossians this
[32:47] morning. It kind of speaks to what what
[32:50] brother Brad was talking about on
[32:51] Wednesday.
[32:53] If you then be risen with Christ, what
[32:56] do you and it says here, seek those
[32:58] things which are above. That's what we
[33:00] desire. We're We're not trying to grow
[33:03] kingdoms on this earth. Everything we do
[33:05] is to grow a king. That everything we
[33:08] want to buy is on the other side. It's
[33:10] not here. And he goes on, "Think on
[33:12] those things above where Christ siteth
[33:14] on the right hand of God." I have to
[33:17] increase the reading. I have a hard time
[33:19] reading even these this big print. Set
[33:21] your affections on things above and not
[33:24] on things on the earth. for you are dead
[33:27] and your life is hid with Christ and
[33:29] God. It goes to what I was beginning to
[33:31] say this morning. It's really so
[33:33] important that your life be hid in Jesus
[33:36] Christ this morning. And it's not you
[33:38] doing it, but it's him doing it through
[33:40] you this morning. I I apologize. I know
[33:42] I say that a lot. I probably say it
[33:44] every Sunday I come up here, but it's
[33:46] still the word of God. And it's still
[33:48] the truth. You You won't get there on
[33:50] your own laurels. The only way you're
[33:51] going to get there is on Jesus Christ
[33:53] this morning. And when Christ who is our
[33:56] life shall appear, then you shall also
[33:58] appear with him in glory. It goes on to
[34:01] say mortify therefore your members which
[34:04] were upon the earth. So he's telling you
[34:07] to mortify your members. And what he
[34:09] means by that is that you're looking to
[34:12] put away all these things he's going to
[34:14] mention here. And uh forgive my
[34:17] pronunciation of some of these words,
[34:19] fornication, uncleanliness. And when you
[34:22] hear these words, your mind thinks of
[34:24] the world out there. It is totally
[34:26] running after these things this morning.
[34:29] Ignorant affections. That's really
[34:31] speaks to the society we live in this
[34:33] morning. Evil compance and covetousness,
[34:37] which is and I really thought about
[34:39] covetous, which is idolatry. And that
[34:42] really speaks to the age we're in. You
[34:44] know, when you desire what someone else
[34:46] has, the Bible says that's idolatry. I
[34:49] mean, that's a that's a really hard
[34:52] statement right there when you spend
[34:54] your whole life desiring to tear from
[34:56] other people the things they have.
[34:57] That's not a good place to be. For which
[35:01] things the sake of wrath cometh on the
[35:03] children of disobedience in which you
[35:05] you also walk sometime when you lived in
[35:08] them. And that goes back to what Peter
[35:09] said. The only way you escape this is by
[35:12] surrendering to Jesus Christ. Now know
[35:15] ye also put off all these
[35:18] and he's talking about us as Christians.
[35:21] Put off anger and wrath and malice,
[35:23] blasphemy, filthy communication out of
[35:26] your mouth. That's something most
[35:28] Christians I know myself you you got to
[35:30] as I get older, you know, it's I find
[35:33] like I said, I'm not afraid to say this.
[35:35] I see some of my father coming out of me
[35:37] as the older I get. Do I like that? No.
[35:40] I just need to work harder every day to
[35:42] make sure it doesn't come out. And it's
[35:44] line not one another, seeing that you
[35:46] have put off the old man with his deeds.
[35:49] And then put on the new man which is
[35:51] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[35:53] him created he him. And he goes, and
[35:56] I'll finish with this last verse, the
[35:58] 11th verse this morning, where there is
[36:01] neither Greek, Greek nor Jew,
[36:04] circumcision or unc circumcision,
[36:07] barbarian, cynthian, bond nor free, but
[36:10] Christ is all and in all. You know,
[36:12] that's the thing about being a Christian
[36:14] this morning. All accounts are even. It
[36:17] doesn't make a difference where you came
[36:18] from, who your parents are, what what
[36:23] religion you came from originally. All
[36:25] accounts are squared even. Everyone's
[36:27] the same in Jesus Christ this morning.
[36:30] Whether you're a billionaire or you're
[36:32] the poorest person on the face of the
[36:34] earth, in Christ, everyone's equal this
[36:37] morning. And that's a comforting
[36:38] thought.
[36:41] So, it's a I was and I was also
[36:44] thinking, you know, that I was thinking
[36:46] there this morning. I I said I was going
[36:48] to finish, but another thought came to
[36:50] my mind. You know what's the one thing
[36:53] this world desires so much? It's all it
[36:57] wants peace. Remember what the
[36:59] scriptures say though. When it gets to a
[37:01] point where people are seeking peace,
[37:03] peace, peace, we all know what comes
[37:06] after that. So I if I ever said one
[37:09] thing to get for myself or anyone this
[37:11] morning, it's a late hour and we're
[37:14] totally dependent on Jesus Christ this
[37:16] morning. Brother Josh
[37:28] If that's the only mistake you make
[37:30] today, you'll be doing good. Brother
[37:31] Brian, God bless you. You love the Lord
[37:34] this morning.
[37:35] Amen. Let's stand this morning and enjoy
[37:38] the Sunday school this morning. And just
[37:40] love the Lord this morning. And let's
[37:42] sing that little chorus. I love you,
[37:43] Lord. And I lift my voice this morning.
[37:46] Amen.
[37:49] I love you Lord
[37:56] and I lift my voice
[38:03] to worship
[38:07] you.
[38:09] Oh my soul,
[38:13] rejoice.
[38:16] Take joy, my king,
[38:22] in
[38:23] what you hear.
[38:28] Oh, let it be a sweet,
[38:31] sweet
[38:33] sound
[38:35] in your ear. Let's sing it to him once
[38:38] again.
[38:41] Oh, I love you, Lord,
[38:47] and I lift my voice
[38:55] to worship
[38:59] you.
[39:01] Oh my soul
[39:05] rejoice.
[39:07] Oh take joy
[39:10] my king

[1:09:12] where I gave up everything. And from
[1:09:16] that moment on, I know that God took
[1:09:17] control and um got me out of the
[1:09:20] lifestyle living in just been one
[1:09:22] blessing after another since I've left
[1:09:23] because I I was going to start at IHOP
[1:09:26] Monday, but HR happened to call Dakota.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Last time I worked for Hannah and told
[1:09:32] him that they were going to go ahead and
[1:09:33] hire me on where he worked at for$,750
[1:09:35] an hour. I think I think it's about
[1:09:36] around that pay raise. But I get paid
[1:09:38] weekly. I'll be they train me on first
[1:09:40] shift starting out Monday morning. I got
[1:09:42] to be there at 5:45 and then I'm
[1:09:44] switching over to second shift with him
[1:09:46] and we're going to go back and forth to
[1:09:47] working with each other. So that's a
[1:09:49] real blessing. Um I got to it be Martin
[1:09:51] Rey and Springfield instead of IHOP. And
[1:09:55] it's just been one blessing after
[1:09:57] another. He's blessed me with a
[1:10:00] possibility, a vehicle. I've been really
[1:10:02] struggling trying to get a car and
[1:10:04] everything, but it's just been one
[1:10:05] blessing. I'm taking it one step at a
[1:10:06] time. And ever since I've been out of
[1:10:08] the lifestyle that I've been in, it's
[1:10:10] just been amazing. I think it's been
[1:10:11] real easygoing. I feel him every day. I
[1:10:14] try to redeem the time as much as I can
[1:10:16] and I'm just he's really blessed me for
[1:10:18] it. So, figured I'd share that with
[1:10:20] everybody this morning.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:29] Amen. And no more seizures, huh? Praise
[1:10:32] the Lord. We're glad for that. Amen. God
[1:10:34] is good, isn't he?
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; How many is glad to be in the house of
[1:10:37] the Lord this morning?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand with me this morning. We'll
[1:10:41] go before the Lord in prayer.
[1:10:43] Amen.
[1:10:48] Let's bow our heads. Kind heavenly
[1:10:50] father, we come before you this morning,
[1:10:51] Lord Jesus, desiring once again as we
[1:10:53] assemble ourselves together, Lord, in
[1:10:56] your name, Father, realizing God, that
[1:10:58] you said wherever two or three would
[1:10:59] gather in your name, there you would be
[1:11:01] in our midst, Lord. And we just believe
[1:11:03] that with all of our heart. We thank
[1:11:04] you, Father, for being here, Lord. and
[1:11:08] we just look forward to the time that
[1:11:09] you'll come to receive us to yourself,
[1:11:11] Lord Jesus. And we won't have to be in
[1:11:13] this world anymore. But we'll get to
[1:11:15] spend all of eternity with you and all
[1:11:17] the saints of all the ages that you have
[1:11:18] redeemed that you have washed by your
[1:11:21] blood and that you have brought back to
[1:11:22] yourself, Lord. Father, we thank you,
[1:11:24] Lord Jesus, for testimony on what you're
[1:11:26] doing in Aaron's life. And we just pray,
[1:11:28] God, that you would further that work,
[1:11:30] Lord, and just make him a real son of
[1:11:31] God and a real man of God, Lord Jesus.
[1:11:34] and we thwart cast out the enemy Lord
[1:11:37] Jesus not just both around him but
[1:11:40] anyone anyone the devil would try to
[1:11:41] come at we rebuke him in the name of
[1:11:44] Jesus Christ father we ask God that you
[1:11:46] would come now in a special way take
[1:11:48] every spirit under the control of the
[1:11:50] Holy Spirit Lord that your name would be
[1:11:52] glorified and that Lord we'd have
[1:11:54] liberty Lord Jesus to speak your word
[1:11:55] this morning according to what you have
[1:11:57] laid upon our hearts to speak this
[1:11:59] morning father help me to get out of the
[1:12:01] way Lord and just let the gift operate
[1:12:03] this morning accord according to your
[1:12:04] divine will and we thank you for your
[1:12:07] goodness now in Jesus name. Amen and
[1:12:10] amen. Amen. Let's just get into the word
[1:12:13] this morning. Amen. Right away uh we do
[1:12:16] have communion service that we want to
[1:12:19] uh observe this morning. And so Amen.
[1:12:23] Amen.
[1:12:25] If you will turn to Genesis 12. Genesis
[1:12:28] 12.
[1:12:37] have actually quite a bit of reading I
[1:12:40] want to do just to lay a foundation. Um,
[1:12:43] so just bear with me.
[1:12:46] Genesis 12:1-3.
[1:12:48] Now the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get
[1:12:52] thee out of thy country, and from thy
[1:12:54] kindred, and from thy father's house,
[1:12:56] unto a land that I will show thee, and I
[1:12:59] will make thee a great nation, and I
[1:13:02] will bless thee, and make thy name
[1:13:04] great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and
[1:13:07] I will bless them that bless thee, and
[1:13:08] curse him that curses thee. And in thee
[1:13:12] shall all the families of the earth be,"
[1:13:14] and let's all say that last word,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; blessed,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; blessed.
[1:13:19] Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Isn't it quite something that when he
[1:13:22] went and appeared to Abraham, told him
[1:13:24] to get out of the country, the one thing
[1:13:26] that all the families of the earth are
[1:13:29] going to benefit from is that they're
[1:13:30] all going to be
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; blessed.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Blessed. That's our title this morning.
[1:13:36] Blessed. Amen.
[1:13:39] Turn another one in Genesis 18.
[1:13:43] Genesis 18.
[1:13:54] And we'll begin with verse 18. Genesis
[1:13:57] 18 and 18.
[1:14:02] Amen.
[1:14:07] Let me let's start with 17. And the Lord
[1:14:10] said, "Shall I hide from Abraham the
[1:14:12] thing which I do? seeing that Abraham
[1:14:15] shall surely become a great and mighty
[1:14:17] nation and all the nations. Now notice,
[1:14:22] let me see if it said it that. Yeah, if
[1:14:24] you notice in the chapter 12, it said,
[1:14:26] "And in thee shall all the families of
[1:14:29] the earth be blessed." Here he says,
[1:14:32] "Surely he shall become a great and
[1:14:34] mighty nation, and all the nations of
[1:14:37] the earth shall be blessed in him."
[1:14:40] Amen. I don't know if you understand
[1:14:43] just what that means, but we want to try
[1:14:45] to bring that out this morning and show
[1:14:47] just what that means. That
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So any blessing, this blessings
[1:14:53] that started started with Abraham.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; That's where it all started at. Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; There's another one in chapter 22.
[1:15:07] He says it again. whenever he had uh
[1:15:12] obeyed and had offered up Isaac and not
[1:15:15] withheld his only son. And because he
[1:15:17] had done this, verse 15, "And the angel
[1:15:19] of the Lord called unto Abraham out of
[1:15:21] heaven the second time, and said, by by
[1:15:24] myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord,
[1:15:27] for because thou hast done this thing,
[1:15:28] and hast not withheld thy son, thine
[1:15:30] only son, that in blessing, I will bless
[1:15:34] thee." Notice what it's all about. It's
[1:15:36] about blessing, isn't it?
[1:15:38] Amen. How many feels blessed this
[1:15:40] morning?
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're blessed.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; I am blessed. I am blessed. Every day
[1:15:48] that I live,
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; I am blessed. When I wake up in the
[1:15:51] morning, when I lay my head to rest,
[1:15:54] we're blessed.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll look at the definition of
[1:15:57] that here in a minute. Blessing, I will
[1:15:59] bless thee. And in multiplying I will
[1:16:01] multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven
[1:16:03] and as the sand which is upon the
[1:16:05] seashore and in thy seed. Now notice he
[1:16:11] said in thy seed
[1:16:13] in thy seed uh and thy seed shall
[1:16:16] possess the gates of these enemies and
[1:16:18] in thy seed. Verse 18 is what I was
[1:16:20] looking for. And in thy seed shall all
[1:16:23] the nations of the earth be blessed
[1:16:26] because thou hast obeyed my voice. Once
[1:16:29] again, the thing that everybody gets is
[1:16:32] a blessing.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just don't know how blessed we
[1:16:36] are.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's uh go to Galatians real
[1:16:40] quick. Galatians 3. We'll see the
[1:16:43] fulfillment of this scripture and we'll
[1:16:45] also see what the seed that he was
[1:16:47] talking about and how that it would be
[1:16:50] blessed and how that it would come.
[1:16:52] Amen. And I had just actually these
[1:16:54] three scriptures, but I knew Galatians
[1:16:56] somewhere Paul talked about this and I
[1:16:58] wasn't just sure how it was, but I found
[1:17:00] it in chapter 3 of Galatians.
[1:17:04] Amen. We'll go with verse six. Even as
[1:17:09] Abraham believed God, and it was counted
[1:17:11] to him for righteousness,
[1:17:14] know ye therefore that they which are of
[1:17:16] faith, the same are the children of
[1:17:19] Abraham. And the scripture foreseeing
[1:17:22] that God would justify the heathen.
[1:17:24] Hello,
[1:17:26] the nations, right? The heathen. All
[1:17:29] nations, not just Israel, but all the
[1:17:31] nations be blessed.
[1:17:33] All the heathens will be blessed,
[1:17:35] justified through faith, preached before
[1:17:39] the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee
[1:17:42] shall all nations be blessed.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; So that they which are of faith are
[1:17:50] blessed with faithful Abraham.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; How many believes in order to tap into
[1:17:55] this blessing, you got to have the faith
[1:17:57] of Abraham.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; You'll never tap into it outside of
[1:18:01] that.
[1:18:02] Amen. Verse 13. Christ has redeemed us
[1:18:06] from the curse of the law, being made a
[1:18:08] curse for us. For it is written, cursed
[1:18:10] is everyone that hangeth on a tree. Now,
[1:18:12] how many know that Jesus became a curse
[1:18:15] for us? And this is through Calvary.
[1:18:18] Amen. Coming through the cross comes the
[1:18:21] blessing. Ain't that right?
[1:18:23] that the blessing of Abraham might come
[1:18:26] to the Gentiles
[1:18:29] through Jesus Christ,
[1:18:32] that we might receive the promise of the
[1:18:34] spirit through faith. Now notice verse
[1:18:37] 16. Now to Abraham and his seed were the
[1:18:41] promises made. He saith not to seeds
[1:18:45] as of many, but as of one. Amen. And to
[1:18:50] thy seed. Isn't that right? Which is
[1:18:53] Christ. Amen. May God add his blessings
[1:18:56] to the reading of the word. You can be
[1:18:57] seated this morning.
[1:19:00] Amen.
[1:19:03] So, praise the Lord. So, we know that it
[1:19:05] is through Jesus Christ that this
[1:19:07] blessing has come and it comes to all
[1:19:10] the world.
[1:19:11] Amen. I'm going to read another one
[1:19:13] before I uh really start.
[1:19:17] So
[1:19:21] the blessings came through Jesus Christ.
[1:19:24] Amen. That's where the blessings came
[1:19:26] through. Started with Abraham and his
[1:19:28] seed and and and uh which is the seed
[1:19:31] which was Christ. Amen. In the beginning
[1:19:34] of Abraham, God said that he would bless
[1:19:36] in blessing I'm going to bless thee.
[1:19:39] Amen. And in through thee all the
[1:19:41] nations of the earth shall be blessed.
[1:19:43] And he that blesses thee will be
[1:19:45] blessed. He that curses thee will be
[1:19:48] cursed.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And really, when you think about
[1:19:51] it, in this life and in this world,
[1:19:53] there's really only two things. Amen.
[1:19:55] Right and wrong, good and evil, blessing
[1:19:58] or cursed, blessing or not blessed.
[1:20:01] Amen. Amen. When we talk about heaven,
[1:20:03] the land of the blessed, right? Amen.
[1:20:06] Heaven is going to be for the land of
[1:20:08] the blessed. Amen. Hell is for the
[1:20:11] damned, the cursed. Isn't that right?
[1:20:15] When Jesus preached his first sermon,
[1:20:17] when Jesus come along, preached his
[1:20:19] first sermon, he started out with the
[1:20:22] word blessed.
[1:20:27] First word, blessed or blessed.
[1:20:31] Blessed. Chapter 5 of Matthew. Blessed
[1:20:33] are the poor in spirit, for theirs is
[1:20:36] the kingdom of heaven.
[1:20:39] Blessed are they that mourn, for they
[1:20:41] shall be comforted.
[1:20:44] Blessed are the meek, for they shall
[1:20:45] inherit the earth. Blessed, blessed,
[1:20:48] blessed.
[1:20:50] [Music]
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; How many is blessed?
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:20:56] thirst after righteousness, for they
[1:20:58] shall be filled.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
[1:21:05] obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in
[1:21:08] heart, for they shall see God. Blessed
[1:21:10] are the peacemakers, for they shall be
[1:21:12] called the children of God. Blessed are
[1:21:14] they which are persecuted for
[1:21:17] righteousness sake. Amen. For theirs is
[1:21:21] the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye
[1:21:23] when men shall revile you and persecute
[1:21:25] you and shall say all manner of evil
[1:21:27] against you falsely.
[1:21:29] Amen.
[1:21:31] For my sake, rejoice and be exceedingly
[1:21:34] glad. For great is your reward in
[1:21:37] heaven. for so persecuted the prophets
[1:21:40] that were before you. All right. The
[1:21:44] definition of blessed according to Amen.
[1:21:48] Uh all right. Now let's look at the
[1:21:51] definition of what is the Bible's
[1:21:54] definition of blessed
[1:21:57] in the Bible. Being blessed means having
[1:22:00] God's favor.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Having God's favor. Now, how many knows
[1:22:08] whenever God God called Noah and that
[1:22:10] said, "Thou has found favor." He found
[1:22:12] favor with God.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Found favor with God.
[1:22:26] It's not. That's right. having favor
[1:22:28] with God, experiencing his grace,
[1:22:32] and receiving spiritual well-being that
[1:22:36] brings deep inner contentment
[1:22:41] and joy.
[1:22:45] Now, here here's here's here's a part I
[1:22:48] want to get to a little bit later, and
[1:22:50] that is regardless of circumstances.
[1:22:54] Regardless of circumstances,
[1:22:57] In other words, the God of the mountain
[1:22:59] is still God in the valley. God of the
[1:23:02] good times is the God in the bad time.
[1:23:04] The one thing the world can't do, the
[1:23:07] one thing the world can't do. They can
[1:23:08] all be happy in the good times, when
[1:23:12] everything's going well, oh,
[1:23:13] everything's good, but when somebody
[1:23:15] cuts them off on the road or whatever it
[1:23:17] might be, they turn to the other side.
[1:23:18] Ain't that right? They can't be happy in
[1:23:22] the bad times.
[1:23:24] Hello. But a Christian is not. Let me
[1:23:28] stop just a couple minutes. How many
[1:23:30] know? Noah found favor with God. Abraham
[1:23:33] what? Found favor with God. How many
[1:23:35] believes that? Amen. Mary. Mary said,
[1:23:39] "Blessed art thou Mary among women."
[1:23:42] Ain't that right? Because thou art
[1:23:44] highly favored.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; How many know my Mary was highly favored
[1:23:51] and she that's why God cho God chose
[1:23:53] her. She was blessed among women. How
[1:23:56] many believe that the church of the
[1:23:58] bride of Christ is blessed among
[1:24:01] churches?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Among all the women, the bride is
[1:24:04] especially blessed.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] I maybe I'll just go ahead and
[1:24:15] preach this morning.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Gersam here. Amen. you
[1:24:21] know, he come and visited with us and
[1:24:23] everything and he's a handsome fellow,
[1:24:25] right?
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:24:30] he
[1:24:32] and you know there was a lot of girls in
[1:24:33] the church. Is that right? Could chose
[1:24:36] from that right? Sure. Other church
[1:24:40] there was other churches.
[1:24:42] Plenty of girls message people got how
[1:24:44] many knows in the message there's a lot
[1:24:47] of girls. Finding a good guy is a little
[1:24:49] bit hard because they outnumber them
[1:24:51] about three to one almost from in my
[1:24:53] vocabulary.
[1:24:55] Hello. Because I've seen it. I've had
[1:24:57] the gettogethers. And I'm here to tell
[1:24:58] you, you know, they outnumber them so
[1:25:00] forth. And you know when But you know,
[1:25:03] you know when he chose that one, ain't
[1:25:06] that right? That one that found favor in
[1:25:09] his sight. Isn't that right? One that is
[1:25:12] highly favored. Amen. highly enough
[1:25:15] favored to ask her to marry him.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Highly favored. And that's the way
[1:25:21] it is with God and his people. If God if
[1:25:25] you found favor with God, you're a
[1:25:28] blessed person.
[1:25:33] Praise the Lord. How many's glad that
[1:25:35] you found favor with God? How many's
[1:25:37] glad that Jesus said, "Have hunger and
[1:25:39] thirst after righteousness?" I'm so glad
[1:25:42] that there was a hunger that there was a
[1:25:44] thirst for God.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. People that don't want to go to
[1:25:47] church, don't sit in the church. They're
[1:25:49] bored in church. They don't want nothing
[1:25:51] to do with it. You are Well, you're in a
[1:25:53] bad shape.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're happy out mowing your yard
[1:25:57] instead of going to church. You're happy
[1:25:59] with some old stale dead church
[1:26:01] somewhere that don't even preach the
[1:26:02] truth. Hello.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; No, we don't. We don't want no part of
[1:26:07] that. Why? We want something that's
[1:26:09] alive, something that's real. We want
[1:26:11] God in our midst. We've got a hunger for
[1:26:14] more of God.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're very blessed people. I got
[1:26:22] to thinking of how that my goodness, you
[1:26:24] know, here we are both naturally and
[1:26:27] spiritually, we're blessed.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; All right, let me let me finish this
[1:26:34] thought of the definition of blessed
[1:26:36] before we go to preaching.
[1:26:39] That's right. An inner contentment
[1:26:46] and joy
[1:26:48] regardless of circumstances. While God
[1:26:51] originally blessed creation with
[1:26:52] flourishing and multiplification,
[1:26:55] the meaning evolved to a state of
[1:26:58] spiritual prosperity marked by
[1:27:01] forgiveness, faith, a close relationship
[1:27:04] with God and satisfaction that is found
[1:27:09] in him.
[1:27:14] I'm sisfied
[1:27:17] with just a cottage below, a little
[1:27:20] silver and a little gold, but we're
[1:27:22] mostly satisfied because we have him.
[1:27:23] Ain't that right?
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Key aspects of blessed. The Bible
[1:27:28] says God's favor and grace. The most
[1:27:33] fundamental meaning of a blessing from
[1:27:36] God is his undeserved favor and grace.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Undeserved. How many know we didn't
[1:27:45] deserve it?
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; No. But still we found favor with him.
[1:27:51] Given by his mercy.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Now apply that to nations. Apply that to
[1:27:58] every family in the earth. Every nation
[1:28:00] has been given this,
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; granted it. Come unto me all ye who are
[1:28:07] weary and heavy laden. He calls the
[1:28:09] whole world. Calls everybody.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; But there's just a few that really
[1:28:13] desire it.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Got that hunger, that that blessedness
[1:28:17] of being hungry for more of God.
[1:28:23] Amen. All right. Given by his mercy,
[1:28:26] spiritual well-being. Blessed refers to
[1:28:28] a spiritual state of inner happiness,
[1:28:33] joy, and contentment that is not
[1:28:37] dependent upon material wealth or
[1:28:40] positive circumstances.
[1:28:46] Amen. Y'all are crying on that one.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:56] All right, we'll we'll just go ahead and
[1:28:59] jump right into this one. See, Job,
[1:29:06] he had some really bad stuff happen to
[1:29:08] him,
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; didn't he?
[1:29:11] went the devil went out there and wind
[1:29:13] came down and smoked the corners of the
[1:29:14] house and fell on all of his m all of
[1:29:17] his sons and daughters all of his stuff
[1:29:20] everything was taken away the devil said
[1:29:22] to God he says I'll make him curse you
[1:29:24] to your face
[1:29:26] cuz he had everything he had hedge about
[1:29:28] him he had a good life it was all
[1:29:30] wonderful but when Job heard all these
[1:29:33] things he rode he got up his mantel
[1:29:36] shaved his head fell down and to the
[1:29:38] ground and worshiped
[1:29:40] Amen. You want to know how to worship
[1:29:42] God? He said, "Naked came out of my
[1:29:44] father's womb and naked life returned
[1:29:47] thither. The Lord gave, the Lord taken
[1:29:50] away. Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; How many me believe the real true
[1:29:57] blessedness of God doesn't go just
[1:29:59] because of man everything that's going
[1:30:01] good or how things are going. No, it's
[1:30:03] something that has an anchor down in
[1:30:06] your soul. And that anchor is God. The
[1:30:09] world doesn't have that, but you've got
[1:30:11] that this morning. You're blessed to
[1:30:12] have that.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz without that, we'd all go crazy.
[1:30:16] We'd all be nuts. We'd all have road
[1:30:18] rage.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Rage of all kinds.
[1:30:23] Praise the Lord. Not depending on
[1:30:26] material wealth or positive
[1:30:28] circumstances. Inner sax, inner
[1:30:31] satisfaction in God. True spiritual
[1:30:33] blessing means being fully satisfied in
[1:30:37] God alone.
[1:30:39] Amen.
[1:30:41] I'm here to tell you, I'm going to tell
[1:30:43] you again. I'm here to tell you that if
[1:30:45] you haven't got God in your heart and
[1:30:47] you're not satisfied with your
[1:30:49] relationship with God, you won't be
[1:30:51] happy with your wife. You won't be happy
[1:30:53] with your husband. You won't be happy
[1:30:55] with your job. You won't be happy with
[1:30:57] your dog. You won't be happy with your
[1:30:58] cat. You just won't be happy. Why?
[1:31:00] Because you haven't got that inner
[1:31:02] happiness.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The pray pastor, he's just not
[1:31:06] good enough. The preacher ain't good
[1:31:08] enough. The church ain't good enough.
[1:31:09] The deacon ain't good enough. Trustees
[1:31:11] ain't good enough.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Hello. Just total no satisfaction. But
[1:31:17] brother preach, he says, man, you find
[1:31:19] just such a discontent. People
[1:31:21] everywhere are not satisfied.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm here to tell you if
[1:31:25] you have a car and you have the Amen.
[1:31:27] and you have a car and you you know you
[1:31:30] don't know nothing about the mechanics,
[1:31:32] you don't even know you're supposed to
[1:31:33] put gas in it, you're going to have
[1:31:35] problems down the road. Amen. When that
[1:31:38] tank gets empty, you're going to run out
[1:31:40] and say, "What is wrong with this car?"
[1:31:42] About as bad as seeing YouTube these
[1:31:44] women and different Wells, I'll say
[1:31:46] women, but that's what they have trying
[1:31:47] to put gas in an electric car. How do I
[1:31:50] get this thing in here? How do I get
[1:31:52] this thing in here?
[1:31:56] It helps to know something about what it
[1:31:58] is. And how many knows that people don't
[1:32:00] know what you are made for? We were not
[1:32:02] made to be empty. Our heart was made to
[1:32:05] be filled. You and I, we need
[1:32:07] satisfaction. Everybody needs
[1:32:09] satisfaction. Amen. But praise be to
[1:32:11] God. We understand. Amen. That if your
[1:32:14] car don't start, get out there, pop the
[1:32:16] hood. Amen. Wiggle that positive wire a
[1:32:18] little bit. Make sure that it's
[1:32:20] connected good. Amen. Maybe it was
[1:32:22] loosened. tighten that thing up and
[1:32:23] whoop, here we go. That's the way with
[1:32:26] your life. If it ain't purring the way
[1:32:27] that it ought to, if you ain't got joy
[1:32:29] unspeakable, I like that song that
[1:32:31] Brother David said, "Well, I have found
[1:32:33] his grace is all complete. It supplies
[1:32:36] my every need. It is joy unspeakable and
[1:32:39] full of glory. Full of glory.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, blows. It flows." Amen. It
[1:32:45] just flows.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God wants you to have joy
[1:32:52] unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:32:56] Amen. David, he got so so much of God.
[1:32:59] Amen. He says, "My cup is full and it's
[1:33:02] running over." How many believe that
[1:33:03] with what you got, with what I got, our
[1:33:06] cups ought to be full this morning. It
[1:33:08] ought to be running over a little bit.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; If it ain't, it ain't God's fault. He's
[1:33:16] got us plenty to drink. He's got us
[1:33:18] plenty to eat. That's right.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; If you ain't eating and you ain't
[1:33:23] drinking the way you ought to,
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; you that spiritual deprived person, that
[1:33:27] hungry person,
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; not getting nothing out of the service,
[1:33:31] why don't you repent? Why don't you fix
[1:33:32] that problem? Get right to where you
[1:33:35] come to church. Amen. You pull from the
[1:33:37] gift of God. You go out a better person
[1:33:39] than what you come in.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I'll tell you what. Amen. All
[1:33:49] we are blessed. If you are in Christ,
[1:33:52] every blessing comes from Almighty God.
[1:33:54] It all comes from Christ.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; We are blessed above measure through
[1:34:01] Jesus Christ, the son of the living God
[1:34:02] that went to Calvary for us.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; All the nations to be blessed. They can
[1:34:07] all be blessed.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; They talk about white people having
[1:34:13] privilege. White privilege. Ain't that
[1:34:16] right? I want you to know
[1:34:20] I took that word and I thought you know
[1:34:24] that word privilege to me can be used
[1:34:27] instead of blessed
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; instead of blessed. Talk about
[1:34:31] privilege. How many believe we're a
[1:34:33] privileged people? We're a blessed
[1:34:36] people
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; to have the privilege of something that
[1:34:40] gives you access to something.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not the UPC, as Dale Potter
[1:34:49] always said, the underprivileged
[1:34:50] children.
[1:34:54] We're not underprivileged.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; We're overprivileged.
[1:34:59] Do you realize that God has given you
[1:35:01] everything? Paul said, "Whether it's
[1:35:02] life, whether it's death, things,
[1:35:04] present, the future, God has given us
[1:35:06] everything. We are heirs of all things.
[1:35:11] The meek shall inherit the earth. Don't
[1:35:13] be excited about those two acres of that
[1:35:15] nice house you got. You're going to
[1:35:17] inherit the whole earth.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; That don't do something for you. I don't
[1:35:22] know what you need to drink.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; You need some more of the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:26] what you need to drink more of.
[1:35:30] Amen.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Come on, people.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get with me. Preach with me this
[1:35:40] morning. Amen.
[1:35:42] Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am blessed.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; I am blessed. Every day that I live, I
[1:35:53] am blessed.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; My cup is full and it's running over.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm enjoying.
[1:36:04] How many believe that we are enjoying
[1:36:06] what God gave to Abraham way back there?
[1:36:09] In these shall all the nations, all the
[1:36:11] families shall be blessed through you.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; And through your seed, which is Christ.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:21] All right.
[1:36:24] Let me go a little different direction
[1:36:25] for a minute.
[1:36:36] We sing that song. song, count your
[1:36:38] blessings. Name them one by one.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Count your blessings. I'm here to tell
[1:36:44] you that when you start counting your
[1:36:46] blessings,
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; you will give God glory and praise and
[1:36:50] thanks, you won't have time to complain.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; You won't have time to You'll be too
[1:36:56] busy counting some more blessing.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Just keep on counting.
[1:37:04] I thought, man, just to be standing
[1:37:05] here.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; I'm blessed to be standing here.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; I'm blessed to be able to jump.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; You know how many people are wheelchair
[1:37:14] ridden and can't walk? Oh, praise be to
[1:37:16] God. I'm glad I can stand this morning.
[1:37:18] I'm glad I can wave my arms this
[1:37:20] morning. I'm glad I can praise God this
[1:37:23] morning. I'm glad I got my movement. I
[1:37:26] God, I thank God for everything. We got
[1:37:28] to be like Stonewall Jackson. Amen. I
[1:37:30] don't take a sip of water, but I thank
[1:37:32] God for. There ain't nothing I don't
[1:37:34] thank God for. Why? Cuz it's all a
[1:37:37] blessing.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; We're blessed to be able to meet here
[1:37:40] this morning. Brother said they'll shut
[1:37:42] us down one of these days. So enjoy the
[1:37:45] time that you got.
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:52] Enjoy your blessings
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; because we won't always have them.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Privileges and everything else will be
[1:38:01] taken from us. Brother Ram said,
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; the world, look at how it's going now.
[1:38:06] They're already shooting and killing
[1:38:07] people for going out there and preaching
[1:38:09] the gospel and talking about Jesus,
[1:38:12] shooting them in the head. But Abraham
[1:38:14] says, "I'll come when they'll shoot you
[1:38:17] if you go try to offer prayer for
[1:38:18] somebody."
[1:38:21] Getting pretty close.
[1:38:23] My
[1:38:26] You love him.
[1:38:29] Amen.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:37] Praise the Lord. So I thought, you know,
[1:38:41] the whole world is blessed.
[1:38:46] The sinner is blessed.
[1:38:50] And you know the problem is is that
[1:38:54] people take things for granted.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; They don't realize how privileged
[1:39:00] they are or how blessed they are.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; You know how blessed the sinner is out
[1:39:10] there today?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Why is he blessed, brother Ber? I always
[1:39:15] like when the preacher tells me what
[1:39:16] what he's talking about.
[1:39:19] How are they blessed?
[1:39:22] Right now they get to enjoy
[1:39:27] the glory of God.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; They live in the glory of God. Didn't
[1:39:33] the Bible say that the whole earth is
[1:39:35] filled with his glory?
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; The whole earth is full of his glory
[1:39:42] also. The whole world is filled with his
[1:39:44] power.
[1:39:46] How many believe the power of God is
[1:39:49] everywhere?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Sure. What did Brother Ram say? He said,
[1:39:56] "Take a plate of grass or that oak tree
[1:40:00] or that peach tree or that apple tree."
[1:40:04] What tells that sap to run down in the
[1:40:06] winter time? Why are those leaves
[1:40:08] changing? Cuz somebody is telling it
[1:40:11] it's time to go down and hide. It's time
[1:40:14] to get out of the bad cold weather, the
[1:40:16] freezing cold, cuz it would kill him if
[1:40:18] it didn't everywhere. What's holding
[1:40:20] that sun up there? What's holding that
[1:40:22] moon up there?
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, the presence of God unrecognized.
[1:40:28] Brother Brandon preached, they don't
[1:40:30] recognize the presence of God. They get
[1:40:32] to get their boats and they get to go
[1:40:33] out there, enjoy the water. They get to
[1:40:35] go by the beach and fill the beach and
[1:40:37] enjoy the sunset. Oh, it's such a pretty
[1:40:39] sunset. You're privileged cuz someday
[1:40:42] everything's going to be dark unless you
[1:40:44] repent. There ain't going to be no sun
[1:40:46] to warm you.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; They sunbathe. They like to warm
[1:40:50] themselves in the sun. That's a
[1:40:51] privilege
[1:40:53] to enjoy the glory of God.
[1:40:58] All the things that they do that they
[1:41:00] enjoy. That's all in enjoying the glory
[1:41:03] of God. Enjoying the sun just right, the
[1:41:06] temperance just right. cuz I'm here
[1:41:08] today and tell you one of these days
[1:41:10] they're going to be in a place that is
[1:41:12] way way too hot. They're not going to be
[1:41:15] comfortable. They're going to be
[1:41:16] miserable.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; They're going to be in hell. They're
[1:41:19] going to be in darkness. And they're not
[1:41:21] going to have that privilege. But do
[1:41:23] they ever look up and say, "Thank you,
[1:41:24] God." No, they don't.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; But we do. We come to church and say, "I
[1:41:31] thank God for all of his goodness. I
[1:41:33] thank him for his grace. I thank him for
[1:41:36] his mercy.
[1:41:38] I am blessed and I enjoy having that
[1:41:40] blessing.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; So the sinner, the ungodly, they get to
[1:41:48] enjoy it.
[1:41:50] What if that sun didn't come up of a
[1:41:52] morning? Hello.
[1:41:55] What if it went too hot? What if things
[1:41:57] were really like they try to make it to
[1:41:59] be? You know how they try to make it to
[1:42:02] be? to try to make it that it's just
[1:42:05] evolution.
[1:42:07] Just by chance.
[1:42:10] Just by chance.
[1:42:15] Are y'all with me now?
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Tell me something. How can they know
[1:42:19] when Haley's comet will come back
[1:42:21] around? How? And everything. The tides
[1:42:23] turning. They can tell you what the
[1:42:24] tides are coming in, the moon, the phase
[1:42:26] of it, every month way ahead of time. It
[1:42:29] all stays in time, don't it?
[1:42:32] And you think that's by chance. So I
[1:42:35] say, "How stupid can you be?"
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; How stupid can you be to think that
[1:42:42] would just accidentally happen? No, that
[1:42:45] doesn't just accidentally happen. There
[1:42:47] is a God in heaven that makes everything
[1:42:49] revolve just the way that it's supposed
[1:42:51] to do.
[1:42:53] How many is counting on it this morning
[1:42:55] that you are part of his thoughts? You
[1:42:56] are part of his word. And you're doing
[1:42:58] exactly what he wants you to do in the
[1:43:01] age that you're living in.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:10] They're enjoying watching the power of
[1:43:13] God as that sun sets, but they don't
[1:43:16] have it in here. It's all external.
[1:43:20] In here, there's no fulfillment.
[1:43:23] There's no joy. There's no blessedness
[1:43:26] of forgiveness. How many believe that
[1:43:28] forgiveness is a blessedness?
[1:43:31] Amen. Peace is a blessedness. Joy is a
[1:43:36] blessedness.
[1:43:38] People will pursue become billionaires.
[1:43:40] Amen. To try to find joy. You can become
[1:43:42] a multi-billionaire and not have a lick
[1:43:44] of joy and be more miserable than what
[1:43:46] you ever was.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:52] Cuz
[1:43:53] it doesn't come that way,
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; does it? No, it doesn't come that way.
[1:43:59] Amen.
[1:44:01] Praise the Lord. Brother Bam says when
[1:44:03] God send a gift to the earth, if that
[1:44:06] generation receives that gift, then they
[1:44:09] become a blessed people.
[1:44:12] Amen. How many has accepted the gift
[1:44:13] that God gave of Malachi for the gift of
[1:44:16] a prophet?
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed this, blessed that.
[1:44:20] Brother Brand preach a message called,
[1:44:22] Amen, the forgotten beatitude. Amen.
[1:44:25] Blessed is he that is not offended in
[1:44:27] me. Amen. Because people are offended at
[1:44:30] the word of God. Blessed are you when
[1:44:33] the word don't offend you.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; But when the word offends people, how
[1:44:38] many knows it offends denominations?
[1:44:42] If you're offended in Christ, you're not
[1:44:44] a blessed person. You become a blessed
[1:44:47] people. And if they turn from it, turn
[1:44:50] it down, they become a curse pe cursed
[1:44:53] people always.
[1:44:55] Then he goes to talking about look at
[1:44:57] Jesus' hour, the greatest gift of all.
[1:44:59] Ain't that right? And they turned him
[1:45:01] down. And look at the curse. They were
[1:45:03] scattered to all nations. Jerusalem and
[1:45:06] those that were trapped in it. Ended up
[1:45:08] eating the bark off the tree and boiling
[1:45:10] each other's kids for something to eat.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; It was a terrible, terrible thing. It
[1:45:15] was a curse.
[1:45:18] How many in here have grieved the Holy
[1:45:20] Spirit away from your heart and know
[1:45:21] what it's like to feel that curse,
[1:45:24] that condemnation,
[1:45:26] that emptiness? Hello.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Get away from God and there's a curse
[1:45:30] there.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way it is with the
[1:45:34] world. But I was looking that up. But
[1:45:35] Bam says, "Whether it's a country,
[1:45:36] whether it's an individual, whether it's
[1:45:38] a church, when you get away from God,
[1:45:40] Amen. the judgment and wrath of God is
[1:45:43] upon you.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You reap what you sow.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just because we were founded on
[1:45:50] Plymouth Rock and religions and so
[1:45:51] forth, don't spare us. Amen. From
[1:45:54] another nation coming in and taking
[1:45:55] over, we've swn and now we're going to
[1:45:57] repossess.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:00] Everything. Think about it.
[1:46:03] Don't appreciate the sun that comes. And
[1:46:05] brother Bam talked about how that this
[1:46:07] sun is what brings and keeps life upon
[1:46:09] the earth because without that there
[1:46:11] would be no food, would there? No, they
[1:46:13] don't appreciate the growing of the
[1:46:15] orange trees, the apple trees, the fruit
[1:46:17] trees, and the vegetation. That's all
[1:46:19] God.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; How many believes every time you put
[1:46:23] something in your mouth, you say, "Thank
[1:46:24] you, Lord Jesus. You provided the food
[1:46:27] that I eat.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; He provides the food that you eat.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; I like to chew it extra much."
[1:46:36] And thank you, Lord. Ain't that right?
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; And I'd like good food. If you ever go
[1:46:42] to Evansville, go to their what's it
[1:46:45] called, Donna?
[1:46:47] Go to that Golden Corral.
[1:46:51] My my I may have sinned just a little
[1:46:55] bit.

[1:47:04] restaurant. We got to go because it

[1:47:09] of them ain't got the best, but they got
[1:47:10] some stuff, man.
[1:47:12] I had two plates in my hand. One guy
[1:47:14] goes by. He says, "You going to eat all
[1:47:16] that?" "Yes, sir, I am."
[1:47:20] Well, good for you. At least you can.
[1:47:24] I ate that and got another one.
[1:47:28] And thank the Lord. How many good We got
[1:47:31] good food. We got everything. Amen. How
[1:47:33] many believe we're blessed people?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We truly are. Brother Brandham
[1:47:37] said it this way.
[1:47:41] friends. We walk around here. He said,
[1:47:44] "We wear good clothes. The best
[1:47:46] clothes."
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought, "Look at the suit." I
[1:47:50] wanted to thank y'all for my Christmas
[1:47:51] present. This is my Christmas present.
[1:47:53] Y'all bought me a nice suit.

[1:48:13] that good food. Thank the Lord. Say,
[1:48:15] "Thank you, Jesus."
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; I was coming down the road this morning.
[1:48:19] I told my wife, "I'm glad I ain't got to
[1:48:20] drive no horse and buggy. I like this
[1:48:23] Dodge right here. I like my garage."
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; And I told her, "Or my Chevy
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; or my Toyota or my our bug, whichever we
[1:48:33] want to drive."
[1:48:35] And I thank God for good paved roads.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Hello. Good paved roads.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for good doctors. We
[1:48:42] got, you know, think about all the good
[1:48:45] things that God has given us.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; How many believe it's a good church?
[1:48:50] [Applause]
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Good group of people
[1:48:57] and we can come out on Wednesday and on
[1:48:58] Sunday and enjoy each other's presence
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; and hear the true word of God.
[1:49:05] I must say, I'm going to just think
[1:49:08] about it. We are the best fed people.
[1:49:10] How many believes this morning you are
[1:49:12] spiritually the best fed people on the
[1:49:15] face of the earth?
[1:49:19] Message people that'll quit a church and
[1:49:21] say, "Well, I'm just not being fed."
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. People have said it. I'm
[1:49:27] just not being fed.
[1:49:30] You know the problem it is? I'll tell
[1:49:32] you what the problem is. That person is
[1:49:34] little bitty baby that can't handle the
[1:49:36] spoon yet. Cuz you ain't got to
[1:49:38] shouldn't have to rely on the preacher
[1:49:40] to feed you. You can feed yourself. You
[1:49:42] can feed all day long 24/7. If you're
[1:49:45] hungry and not being fed, you just plain
[1:49:48] backslid.
[1:49:53] Jesus Christ came into this world to
[1:49:55] save sinners.
[1:49:58] Hey, the little old lady in the back of
[1:50:01] the room remember the story that she
[1:50:02] came from the hills and she says,
[1:50:04] "Amen."
[1:50:06] Everybody else turned around like, "What
[1:50:07] are you all excited about?" Hello. That
[1:50:11] feeds your soul.
[1:50:13] It's the truth.
[1:50:15] Amen.

[1:50:42] most money, but Trump and all these
[1:50:45] other guys, right?

[1:51:22] that right? That's right.
[1:51:26] We got the best. We got the best of
[1:51:29] everything in the world.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Look at our
[1:51:33] supermarkets. There's hardly anything
[1:51:35] that you can't get on your phone and
[1:51:38] have it delivered to your house in three
[1:51:40] days.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Well, you ain't happy about that. I'm
[1:51:45] happy about that.
[1:51:49] You know how much money I have saved? I
[1:51:52] told Donna sometimes we will go buy
[1:51:54] something and and we pay three times the
[1:51:55] price we got on Amazon and say, "Look,
[1:51:57] here's the same thing for a fraction of
[1:52:00] the price."
[1:52:02] I told her, I says, "Let's always make
[1:52:04] sure that if we're fixing to buy
[1:52:05] something, we go on Amazon first. Go
[1:52:07] online first, then we'll go to the auto
[1:52:09] parts or wherever we got to go."
[1:52:12] Amen. The best of everything. How many
[1:52:15] knows we're there's so much
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; brother Bam says you know in his leisia
[1:52:21] it was called wretched the word comes
[1:52:23] from the Greek words which means endure
[1:52:25] a trial it has nothing to do with the
[1:52:27] trials that come to a true Christian for
[1:52:30] God describes the Christian's trial as
[1:52:32] blessed and his attitude of one of joy
[1:52:35] whereas the description of this phrase
[1:52:37] is called wretched and miserable now
[1:52:39] here's a str here's my favorite quote as
[1:52:41] you know how strange in this age of
[1:52:43] plenty in this age of progress in this
[1:52:45] age of abundance.
[1:52:48] H isn't it strange? How can there be any
[1:52:51] trials in this age of plenty and
[1:52:53] opportunity when everybody has so much
[1:52:55] and there's so much more to be had and
[1:52:57] all of our inventions to do our work and
[1:53:01] so many things to give us pleasure but
[1:53:03] yet we find a mental illness.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Taking pep pills, you know, to get up
[1:53:09] during the day, sedatives at night, the
[1:53:11] change in institutions are filling up.
[1:53:13] How many believes that this Gen Z, this
[1:53:15] new generation of young people, they
[1:53:18] don't know what they've got.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; They want communism. They don't want
[1:53:22] America. A lot of our senators, they
[1:53:24] don't want America anymore.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm going to talk a little
[1:53:30] bit of polics here. Politics here. I
[1:53:33] want to set your
[1:53:35] mind right about the politics.
[1:53:40] I want it to be the the attitude that we
[1:53:42] have here. It's the attitude I have.
[1:53:45] Whether you have it or not, that's up to
[1:53:47] you.
[1:53:48] Sometimes me and my wife were sitting on
[1:53:50] the couch and we're talking about these
[1:53:52] people that really hate America. How can
[1:53:54] they be in there? You know, and all
[1:53:56] kinds of things. Man, you work yourself
[1:53:58] up thinking, man, why haven't why hasn't
[1:54:00] there been a revolution? Why don't
[1:54:01] people rise up? I said, Brother Bam
[1:54:04] said, America has needed a revolution a
[1:54:06] long time ago. and he said that he she
[1:54:08] needed a counterrevolution to that
[1:54:10] revolutions. So in brother Bham's
[1:54:12] opinion he didn't needed a couple
[1:54:13] revolutions already back in his day.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; But I said look as long as you're
[1:54:20] looking at wishing this could be this
[1:54:22] way or wanting that to be that way and
[1:54:24] this ain't right, you're going to kind
[1:54:25] of get worked up. But I said the right
[1:54:27] attitude is to realize well praise God.
[1:54:29] That's what brother Brandham said it
[1:54:31] would do. It's going to get worse and
[1:54:32] worse. It'll never get better until the
[1:54:35] skies catch on fire. But just have the
[1:54:37] right attitude towards politics. Don't
[1:54:38] think it's going to get any better.
[1:54:40] Amen. Look for the coming of the Lord.
[1:54:43] Get ready to get out of here. That's the
[1:54:45] right attitude. Not thinking you're
[1:54:48] going to change the politics out there
[1:54:49] by voting for another president, this,
[1:54:51] that, or the other. Not saying you can't
[1:54:53] vote or anything, but you understand.
[1:54:55] We're thankful for any good that's still
[1:54:57] there.
[1:54:59] But to have the attitude, oh boy, if
[1:55:01] they just do this, if they just do that,
[1:55:03] don't even go there. How many's with me?
[1:55:06] shouldn't even go there cuz it's not
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; bless praise the lord
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; plenty all the inventions to do our work
[1:55:16] to give us pleasure amen when I thought
[1:55:19] my what what how many believes that the
[1:55:21] gospel even as things brother Bam said
[1:55:23] even as things have progressed in the
[1:55:25] natural
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:55:31] and Julie
[1:55:33] you don't have to go out there and hitch
[1:55:34] up the buggy the horse. Is that right?
[1:55:38] And clean up the manure while you're at
[1:55:40] it. We don't want that laying around.
[1:55:42] Ain't got to do that. Huh?
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; How many of you sisters enjoy opening
[1:55:48] that dishwasher and putting the dishes
[1:55:50] in?
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; I think it's getting to where they want
[1:55:53] somebody to even put them in there. Hey,
[1:55:55] one, hey, can you load the dishwasher?
[1:55:56] People don't even want to load to a
[1:55:57] dishwasher anymore. That's getting
[1:55:59] pretty lazy.
[1:56:04] I told my wife, "Honey, I'm going to do
[1:56:05] the dishes. I'm going to do all your
[1:56:06] dishes for you. I'm going to go buy you
[1:56:08] a dishwasher."
[1:56:13] For a while, she didn't want one. She
[1:56:14] didn't trust them to get her clean, her
[1:56:16] stuff clean, but she finally come
[1:56:18] around.
[1:56:22] Amen. But how many's glad for the
[1:56:24] spiritual progress?
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We used to think you had to be
[1:56:28] doing this and you had to be doing that
[1:56:29] and you got to be Amish. You got to be
[1:56:31] menite. You got to buy obey all this.
[1:56:33] You got to do that or the other. And we
[1:56:34] found out that we're saved by grace. And
[1:56:37] that alone.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; What we do, we do because we love God.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; And if we still have that desire to do
[1:56:45] wrong, then you need more get more God
[1:56:47] in your heart.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; How many is with me on that?
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; That if you still have a desire, Amen.
[1:56:52] and it overrules, you need more of the
[1:56:54] Holy Ghost.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will take that right out
[1:56:57] of your heart and out of your life.
[1:56:59] We've got a seven course meal. How many
[1:57:02] believe we got fruits? We got
[1:57:03] vegetables. I like that sausage. I like
[1:57:06] those peppers. And I like those onions
[1:57:08] all mixed together. Oh, I love them
[1:57:10] onions. Hello. Oh my. I like that statue
[1:57:15] of a perfect man. I like that Godhead. I
[1:57:17] like that water baptism. Amen. I like
[1:57:19] that inner man.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; The hidden man. Hidden mana. Yes.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:57:27] Brother said under that veil when you
[1:57:29] get behind that you kind of glory. Every
[1:57:31] day is good day to you. Whether it's
[1:57:33] cloudy on the inside, outside, some
[1:57:35] people got to go to revival to get back
[1:57:37] refreshed again. But you meet a person
[1:57:39] that's hidden away. Boy, if there's
[1:57:41] anything I need to preach more of, I
[1:57:43] believe it's that we need to get so
[1:57:45] hidden away. Amen. I don't care if you
[1:57:47] ain't been in a revival in six months.
[1:57:49] You're still just as wide as you ever
[1:57:51] was.
[1:57:58] Settle down, brother Ber. Settle down.
[1:58:02] I got to talk to myself.
[1:58:04] How many believes God is good?
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I David, I know what you was talking
[1:58:09] about, man. I know what you take talking
[1:58:12] about when you said, "My cup is full and
[1:58:15] running over." Brother Brandon would say
[1:58:17] the same thing. Yeah, Paul. Yeah, David,
[1:58:19] I know what you was talking about. Amen.
[1:58:21] My cup is full and running over.
[1:58:23] running, running, running around that
[1:58:24] tree, praising God. Hallelujah. Amen. If
[1:58:27] somebody heard me, they'd have thought
[1:58:29] some crazy man was up there in that
[1:58:31] woods. I believe it's about time we get
[1:58:33] a little bit crazy for God. Why? Because
[1:58:36] he's worthy of our praise. He's worthy
[1:58:38] of glory and honor and blessing.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of whatever you give him.
[1:58:42] He's worthy of our dance.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[1:58:47] He's worthy of our shout.
[1:58:50] He don't deserve some dry, cold, dead
[1:58:53] form of worship.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; I didn't think I was going to get off
[1:59:02] the ground this morning, but I believe
[1:59:04] we're off the ground.
[1:59:26] How many's been blessed?
[1:59:29] Blessed
[1:59:31] by what?
[1:59:33] By having him, the Holy Spirit in your
[1:59:37] heart. Amen.
[1:59:40] Let me tell you what we got to be
[1:59:42] careful of. Evening light tabernacle.
[1:59:44] People of Evening Life Tabernacle, be
[1:59:46] careful of this. That you don't go
[1:59:49] looking for a super message preacher.
[1:59:52] Well, I want a super message preacher. I
[1:59:53] want a hero of a preacher. Hello.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Some people want to look to a man for
[2:00:00] some greatness. What you need to realize
[2:00:03] is that great man is right there in your
[2:00:06] heart in the form of the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:09] It's Jesus Christ is the great man. He's
[2:00:12] the one that we look to. That's the one
[2:00:14] that we admire. That's the one we adore.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll tell you what, he goes
[2:00:18] with you to your job. He goes with you
[2:00:20] wherever you go. He gives you joy. He
[2:00:23] gives you revelation.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the great one among us.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Not me or any other preacher.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; It's Christ that's the great one.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Couple more thoughts I maybe just share.
[2:00:37] That was one of them. The other one was
[2:00:40] that I believe that the devil
[2:00:44] Bible talks about
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; I think I turned it back on. I'm playing
[2:00:52] with my button back here.
[2:00:55] What are you switching it on for?
[2:00:58] Getting a little excited.
[2:01:00] Bible talks about that beast having
[2:01:02] seven heads and 10 horns.
[2:01:05] You know, I've almost concluded, sister,
[2:01:07] that the devil, if you cut his head off,
[2:01:11] he can grow it back.
[2:01:15] Huh? You can grow it back.
[2:01:19] Why do you say that, brother? Well,
[2:01:22] because my wife, as you know,
[2:01:25] the devil has tried to put cancer on
[2:01:27] her. Is that right? And since then, even
[2:01:31] in the last few weeks, sometimes he'll
[2:01:33] try to put a fear on her. Try to put
[2:01:36] some kind of feeling on her. Not that's
[2:01:37] just some feeling that be. He's just
[2:01:40] trying to get in.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the last few weeks, her legs
[2:01:44] have swelled up and changed colors,
[2:01:46] blistered a little bit like and got all
[2:01:47] discolored. We was really wondering what
[2:01:49] it was. And we've went to pray and just
[2:01:52] the devil. Ain't that right? Just the
[2:01:54] devil. Amen. And this morning, by God's
[2:01:58] grace, it's very, very good. Amen.
[2:02:06] But I say that because every time he
[2:02:07] sticks his head up, we cut it off.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; It ain't long. Here it comes again.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Why? He just can't
[2:02:15] seem to kill him. He just keeps sticking
[2:02:17] his head up. Ain't that right? And he
[2:02:19] probably will do that. But one of these
[2:02:20] days, we're not going to cut his head
[2:02:22] off. We're going to kick his whole body
[2:02:25] into the bottomless pit and we're going
[2:02:27] to have no more trials with him. He's
[2:02:29] not going to have pester us anymore.
[2:02:31] You're never going to have to suffer
[2:02:33] depression. You're never going to be
[2:02:34] down and have the blues. We're going to
[2:02:37] kick him off into the pit. Once and for
[2:02:40] all.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:46] Amen.
[2:02:48] Amen. God bless you this morning. We'll
[2:02:50] stop there. Amen.
[2:02:57] We should be the happiest people on the
[2:03:01] face of the earth. How many believe
[2:03:03] that?
[2:03:04] The other quote that I had under that is
[2:03:06] our cup should be full and running over.
[2:03:11] How many believes we don't have to
[2:03:12] splatter in that little old pond
[2:03:14] anymore? That's only knee deep. That's
[2:03:18] only waist deep. You ain't got to go
[2:03:20] flopping into that. Not waist deep, but
[2:03:22] just ankle deep, flopping in it, trying
[2:03:23] to swim. Y'all remember brother Brandham
[2:03:26] telling the story of he told his dad
[2:03:28] that he could swim and he jumped in some
[2:03:30] water hole. Wasn't even hardly big
[2:03:31] enough to cover him. And he went to
[2:03:33] swimming. His dad said, "Son, get
[2:03:35] yourself up out of that mud hole. Clean
[2:03:37] yourself up."
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; He was quite a rough daddy,
[2:03:41] but he thought he could swim. But let me
[2:03:43] tell you something. How many believe we
[2:03:43] ain't got to do that? No. How many
[2:03:45] believe we swim in a pure river of life,
[2:03:49] clear as crystal?
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Drink from the fountains of living
[2:03:54] waters. We're a privileged people. We've
[2:03:57] been blessed.
[2:03:59] Blessed.
[2:04:01] Blessed. That's why we sing. We'll sing
[2:04:03] this song as we change it. Can you pull
[2:04:06] that? We bless your name up. We bless
[2:04:08] your name because he has blessed us and
[2:04:11] we know we only got any blessings. Any
[2:04:15] blessings only comes from him.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; That's why we sing. We bless your name.
[2:04:22] We musicians, you don't have to come
[2:04:24] because I'm just we're going to have
[2:04:26] this without music. Okay, y'all help me
[2:04:28] out.
[2:04:31] We bless your name.
[2:04:36] We bless your name.
[2:04:40] We give you honor.
[2:04:44] We give you praise.
[2:04:48] You are the life,
[2:04:52] the truth, the way.
[2:04:56] I bless your name.
[2:05:00] I bless
[2:05:02] your name. Stand with me. this morning.
[2:05:06] Lord Jesus, we come before you from the
[2:05:08] bottom of our hearts singing this song
[2:05:10] that we truly bless your name. Lord, we
[2:05:13] bless your name. We give you honor. We
[2:05:16] give you praise and we honor you, Lord
[2:05:18] Jesus. Father, this morning we want to
[2:05:20] thank you, Lord, for every good gift,
[2:05:22] every blessing that you have bestowed
[2:05:23] upon us. Lord, we didn't even get into
[2:05:26] talking about that even in the trials
[2:05:27] very much, Lord Jesus, but we're blessed
[2:05:29] even when trials come upon us, Lord,
[2:05:31] because it turns us into pure gold. And
[2:05:34] we thank you, Lord Jesus, like Paul
[2:05:36] said, I have learned in the in in the
[2:05:39] aspect of respect to be content in
[2:05:41] whatever state that I am, Lord. But we
[2:05:44] ask God that we'd always be thankful,
[2:05:45] Father, in whatever state we are
[2:05:47] knowing, God, that even if we come down
[2:05:48] to the door of death, we're still
[2:05:50] blessed because we have one that's going
[2:05:52] to carry us across the river, Lord. No
[2:05:54] matter what our bad situation might be,
[2:05:56] Lord, we're always still blessed, God.
[2:05:59] And so we bless your name. We bless your
[2:06:01] name. And Father, this morning as we
[2:06:03] brought this change to the order of the
[2:06:04] service, Lord, to remember what you did
[2:06:06] on Calvary to make this blessing
[2:06:09] available through Jesus Christ. For we
[2:06:11] know that's truly what you was talking
[2:06:13] about, Lord, is the inner peace that we
[2:06:16] get, Father, from the blessing of
[2:06:18] Almighty God through the avenue of
[2:06:20] forgiveness because of the cross of
[2:06:21] Calvary. Lord, we observe this this
[2:06:24] morning, this communion, Father, in
[2:06:26] honor and in respect of what you have
[2:06:27] done for us, Lord, in purchasing our
[2:06:29] blessing. And we receive every blessing
[2:06:32] that you have bestowed upon us, Father.
[2:06:34] Bless the communion service now. We ask
[2:06:37] in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. Turn
[2:06:40] your Bibles right away if you will to
[2:06:42] First Corinthians. We'll just get into
[2:06:44] the word. Did you enjoy the word this
[2:06:45] morning?
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand. Say, "Thank
[2:06:48] you, Lord Jesus.
[2:06:51] Thank you, Lord. We appreciate it,
[2:06:53] Father." Amen. I felt like when it first
[2:06:56] came, it just that word bless. It just
[2:06:58] popped up in my head and I began to
[2:07:00] think about it and that seems to be the
[2:07:02] way that the Lord wanted me to go. So, I
[2:07:04] trust it was a blessing to you. Amen. 1
[2:07:06] Corinthians
[2:07:08] the 11th chapter. 1 Corinthians 11.
[2:07:12] Amen.
[2:07:14] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:19] Beginning with verse 23. For I have
[2:07:21] received of the Lord, that which also I
[2:07:23] delivered unto you, the same the Lord
[2:07:25] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[2:07:26] which he was betrayed took bread and
[2:07:29] when he had given thanks, he broke it
[2:07:30] and said, Take, eat. This is my body
[2:07:32] which is broken for you. This do in
[2:07:34] remembrance of me. After the same manner
[2:07:36] also he took the cup and when he had
[2:07:38] sucked, saying, "This cup is the new
[2:07:40] testament in my blood. This do ye as oft
[2:07:42] drink it in remembrance of me." Amen.
[2:07:45] This morning when I do that, and when I
[2:07:47] remember him, I remember all the
[2:07:49] blessings that he bought for me. Amen.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; How many was with was with me? Amen.
[2:07:53] That's right. We remember all that he
[2:07:55] did. For as often as you eat of this
[2:07:57] bread and drink of this cup, you do show
[2:07:58] the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore
[2:08:00] whosoever shall eat of this bread and
[2:08:02] drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily
[2:08:04] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[2:08:05] the Lord. But let a man examine himself
[2:08:08] and so let him eat of that bread and
[2:08:09] drink of that cup. How many knows? You
[2:08:10] know if you know got the Holy Ghost or
[2:08:12] not. You know if you're right with God
[2:08:13] or not. Let a man examine himself. So
[2:08:16] let him eat of that. For he that eateth
[2:08:18] and drinkketh unworthily eateth and
[2:08:19] drinkketh amnation to himself, not
[2:08:21] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[2:08:23] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[2:08:25] and many sleep. For if we would judge
[2:08:27] ourselves, we should not be judged. But
[2:08:29] when we are judged, we are chastened of
[2:08:30] the Lord, that we should not be
[2:08:31] condemned with the world. Wherefore, my
[2:08:33] brethren, when you come together to eat,
[2:08:35] tar one for another, and if any man
[2:08:37] hunger, let him eat at home, that you
[2:08:38] come not together unto condemnation. And
[2:08:41] the rest will I set in order. When I
[2:08:43] come, I like to have a few moment of
[2:08:44] silence so that you can take that little
