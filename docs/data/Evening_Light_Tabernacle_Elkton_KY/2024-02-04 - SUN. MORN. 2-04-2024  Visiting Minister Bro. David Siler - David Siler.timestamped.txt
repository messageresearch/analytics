[52:39] said amen God bless you today while
[52:41] you're standing with us if you'd be so
[52:43] kind to turn to the book of St John
[52:45] chapter 11 John chapter 11 want to say
[52:48] what an honor and a privilege it is to
[52:50] be with you today in the house of the
[52:52] Lord trust that the Lord will say
[52:54] something to you many years
[52:57] ago I was in India I was looking out the
[53:02] window getting ready for service service
[53:04] was about to start and I was getting
[53:06] ready to to go and to speak and I
[53:10] watched as a man pulled up in his car in
[53:12] a little place across from where I was
[53:14] staying at and he pulled up in his car
[53:17] and he opened up his trunk and out of
[53:19] the back of his trunk he picked up this
[53:22] statue it wasn't real big but it was a
[53:24] it was statue that he picked up and he
[53:26] took the statue over underneath the
[53:28] little canopy and I watched him as he
[53:32] set that statue down and he began to
[53:35] worship it he got down on his hands and
[53:37] his
[53:38] knees and he was worshiping that
[53:41] statue and I thought Lord I'm so glad I
[53:46] don't worship a God that's been
[53:48] fashioned by the hand of a man and I'm
[53:51] glad it ain't of God that I can pick up
[53:54] but I found out my God has to pick me
[53:57] up and I worship a god it's not been
[54:00] made by man's hands our God is real
[54:03] today I trust you brought him with you
[54:06] amen St John 11:1
[54:09] 17 then when Jesus came he found that he
[54:12] had l in the grave four days already
[54:15] bethan he was nine to Jerusalem about 15
[54:17] furlongs off and many of the Jews came
[54:20] to Martha and to Mary to comfort them
[54:23] concerning their Brethren listen listen
[54:25] to that again many of the Jews came to
[54:28] Martha and Mary to comfort them
[54:30] concerning their brother then Martha as
[54:33] soon as she heard and how many knows how
[54:36] Faith Comes Faith cometh by hearing and
[54:40] Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus
[54:42] was coming went and met him but Mary sat
[54:46] still in the house then said Martha unto
[54:49] Jesus Lord if thou been here my brother
[54:53] had not died but I know that even now
[54:57] whatsoever thou will ask of God God will
[55:00] give it thee and Jesus said unto her thy
[55:03] brother shall rise again and Martha said
[55:06] unto him I know that he shall rise again
[55:10] in the resurrection at the last day so
[55:13] she's looking to the future of things
[55:15] that are to be and Jesus said unto her
[55:19] watch him bring this Revelation among
[55:21] them and Jesus said unto her I am the
[55:24] resurrection
[55:25] and the life and he that believeth in me
[55:28] though he though he were dead yet shall
[55:32] he live and whosoever liveth and
[55:35] believeth in me shall never die and then
[55:39] he asks this question believest thou
[55:42] this she saith unto him Lord I believe
[55:46] that thou art the Christ the son of God
[55:48] which should come into the world and
[55:50] when she had said so she went away and
[55:53] called Mary her sister secretly she went
[55:58] her way and called Mary her sister
[56:02] secretly saying the master is come and
[56:06] calleth for thee I'd like to speak to
[56:09] you on that today the master is come and
[56:12] call us for thee may the Lord add His
[56:13] blessings to the word today you can be
[56:15] seated certainly appreciate each one of
[56:18] you coming to the house of God today see
[56:20] those from our assembly appreciate them
[56:23] coming i' like to speak on this story
[56:27] but the direction that I would like to
[56:30] speak on it from I know that it's
[56:31] preached been preached onto million
[56:33] times but a million and one won't hurt
[56:35] us but we know that the Book of John is
[56:39] actually a special book in the Bible out
[56:42] of the four gospels Matthew Mark Luke
[56:44] and John that John is a special book and
[56:48] each one of the writers that would take
[56:50] and pin that part of the Gospel Matthew
[56:53] Mark Luke and John they could only pin
[56:56] the word by the anointing that was upon
[56:58] them and we know that whenever you look
[57:01] at the anointing that would fall in the
[57:03] New Testament that the prophet tells us
[57:06] that it was going to come by those same
[57:08] anointings that was around Israel in the
[57:10] wilderness they would be the anointing
[57:12] of a lion Ox a man and an eagle and we
[57:16] know that the anointing that would come
[57:18] would fall upon each one of these
[57:20] writers Matthew Mark Luke and John and
[57:23] each one would write under a different
[57:25] anointing whenever you read the gospels
[57:27] it'll help you if you understand like
[57:29] the Book of Matthew whenever Matthew
[57:32] writes that Matthew was under that lying
[57:34] anointing and ly represents King so
[57:37] whenever Matthew begin to write he goes
[57:40] back into the genealogy just like you
[57:42] would with any King to prove his
[57:44] pedigree Matthew goes back into the
[57:46] genealogy of Jesus and he writes the
[57:49] genealogy showing how that the seed line
[57:52] of David had come all the way up and he
[57:55] wrote it that way then he actually spoke
[57:57] concerning the kingdom of God that is to
[58:00] come because he's under that lying
[58:02] anointing but whenever mark would write
[58:05] it Mark would not begin the same place
[58:07] that Matthew would write it but whenever
[58:09] Mark be to write the word Mark was under
[58:12] that Ox anointing and because he was
[58:15] under a servitude anointing he would
[58:18] actually write it from a servant's
[58:19] mentality so he would talk about Jesus
[58:22] being a servant and Jesus coming to
[58:24] served the people and Jesus coming to
[58:27] help the people but whenever it comes to
[58:29] Luke Luke writes it different than the
[58:31] way Matthew under the lion mark under
[58:34] the ox but Luke actually come under the
[58:36] man's anointing so when you read the
[58:39] scripture and you look at the way that
[58:41] Luke writes it Luke talks about the
[58:43] humanity of Jesus and he talks about how
[58:46] that the man was troubled and the man
[58:49] was outside the city of Jerusalem and he
[58:51] suffered with a headache and he looks at
[58:53] the humanity part of our Lord and that's
[58:56] what he focuses on because that's the
[58:58] anointing that Luke is writing under but
[59:00] when you come to the Book of John that
[59:03] John is different than the rest of them
[59:05] because remember that John was a prophet
[59:08] and a prophet represents a sear or a
[59:11] prophet represents an eagle and an eagle
[59:14] has the ability to be able to climb
[59:16] higher than what the ox can what the man
[59:18] can but the lon can it climbs higher
[59:21] than all the rest of them so whenever
[59:23] John begins right he doesn't go back to
[59:26] the Old Testament pick up the lineage of
[59:28] David pick up Tamar pick up Ruth that
[59:31] the way that John writes it but John
[59:33] being an eagle is actually elevated into
[59:36] the sphere that whenever John begin to
[59:38] write John said in the beginning was the
[59:41] word and the Word was with God
[59:44] and because John being a prophet amen a
[59:49] prophet can see all the way back into
[59:51] the past he looks all the way into the
[59:53] future and he can at present tense in
[59:55] the word that's the anointing that John
[59:58] was under so when it comes to this story
[1:00:00] in the book of of John that actually you
[1:00:03] realize the only writer that there is in
[1:00:06] the four gospels that's going to
[1:00:07] actually pin the story of the
[1:00:09] resurrection of Lazarus Matthew never
[1:00:12] wrote about it John never wrote about it
[1:00:13] Luke never wrote about it but only the
[1:00:15] prophetic Eagle type is the one that
[1:00:18] wrote about the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:00:21] now we know that this story has been
[1:00:22] laying here in the scripture for quite
[1:00:25] some time but you and I coming to the
[1:00:27] revelation of this day God sending us an
[1:00:30] eagle to be able to take the word which
[1:00:33] we have now and that word becoming alive
[1:00:35] to us we don't read the Bible the same
[1:00:38] way everybody else reads the Bible we
[1:00:40] don't look at Stories the same way
[1:00:42] everybody else looks at stories but now
[1:00:44] there's come a supernatural
[1:00:46] Enlightenment From Another Dimension
[1:00:48] that has actually took and discern the
[1:00:50] very back parts of God's mind and he's
[1:00:53] taken that story of history and he's
[1:00:56] brought that story present in the day
[1:00:58] that we're living in now so the book of
[1:01:00] Lazarus or the Book of John and The
[1:01:02] Story of Lazarus it's more than
[1:01:05] just another story in your Bible but it
[1:01:09] is a type of a people who is living
[1:01:11] today amen now we're taught according to
[1:01:13] the prophet's message that whenever it
[1:01:15] comes to the New Testament that God's
[1:01:17] going to reveal himself in Three Sons
[1:01:19] Nam Son of God Son of Man son of David
[1:01:22] and we know that there was going to be
[1:01:23] Junctions down through through history
[1:01:25] that God was going to make himself known
[1:01:27] in those offices and we know that the
[1:01:29] office that God wants to use when it
[1:01:31] comes to the prophetic office we know
[1:01:33] that God uses the office of the son of
[1:01:35] man you read that in the Book of Ezekiel
[1:01:37] when he says say unto me Ezekiel do you
[1:01:39] see these bones is laying here and he
[1:01:41] ask son a man can these bones live and
[1:01:43] then Ezekiel said but Lord you know it's
[1:01:46] because God was revealing himself
[1:01:47] through a prophetic office and they
[1:01:50] called it son of man so whenever it
[1:01:52] comes to the three sons Nam Son of God
[1:01:54] son of man son of David we know that God
[1:01:57] would reveal himself in that time now as
[1:02:00] he reveals himself in the days that is
[1:02:02] to coming we believe in a thousand- year
[1:02:04] Millennium Reign that is to to come he
[1:02:07] will reveal himself under the name of
[1:02:10] son of David and we know that through
[1:02:12] the church ages once the Holy Spirit
[1:02:15] Come Back upon the church he was going
[1:02:17] to reveal himself as Son of God down
[1:02:19] Through the Ages but then the scripture
[1:02:21] promises according to Luke 17:30 that
[1:02:25] between the coming of the Millennium and
[1:02:27] after the Son of God Church ages that in
[1:02:30] the end time the light is going to come
[1:02:32] amongst the Gentiles and he's going to
[1:02:34] reveal himself under the office of the
[1:02:36] son of man for as it was in the days of
[1:02:39] Noah so shall it be in the days of the
[1:02:41] coming of the son of man so we know that
[1:02:44] there's three Junctions down through
[1:02:46] history where God revealed himself as
[1:02:48] the son of man he revealed himself in
[1:02:51] that office when he come to Abraham just
[1:02:53] before the destruction of Sodom he come
[1:02:56] to Abraham in the form of MDC and he
[1:02:59] revealed himself as Abra as Elohim and
[1:03:02] we know that God has done that same
[1:03:04] thing God comes down God picks up a dust
[1:03:07] body he creates a body steps into it and
[1:03:09] through that body God discerned the very
[1:03:12] secrets that was in Sarah's heart in
[1:03:14] that body he told them what was fixing
[1:03:16] to take place he for warn them of
[1:03:18] Destruction was going to come and when
[1:03:20] that Ministry come it also give Abraham
[1:03:23] and Sarah a body changing message that
[1:03:25] was going to turn him back young again
[1:03:27] now once Jesus ask once to hear is
[1:03:30] Christ the son of man the almighty God
[1:03:33] comes down bails himself in that body
[1:03:35] the moment that God gets into that body
[1:03:38] that body can get hungry like a man it
[1:03:40] can get thirsty like a man that body can
[1:03:42] get tired like a man but yet the body
[1:03:44] was not God but God was veiling himself
[1:03:47] in that body it was Jehovah veiled in a
[1:03:50] human body that we call
[1:03:52] mezc and but comes and he actually
[1:03:55] identifies that Ministry and he tells us
[1:03:58] according to the message of who is this
[1:04:00] mkdc he tells us actually the opening of
[1:04:03] the seals he shows us by three different
[1:04:05] manifestations of the coming of the son
[1:04:07] of man under a mezic Ministry and he
[1:04:10] goes back he picks it up in the days of
[1:04:13] Abraham and then he tells us that MDC
[1:04:16] became Jesus Christ so it is the son of
[1:04:18] man in the days of Jesus Christ doing
[1:04:21] the same signs and same Wonders that was
[1:04:24] done to Abraham and Sarah was done right
[1:04:26] there remember whatever he called Philip
[1:04:28] and he said when did you know me he said
[1:04:30] before he called you underneath the tree
[1:04:32] I saw you what was it the same sign that
[1:04:34] came to Abraham and Sarah had come there
[1:04:37] and let me just say this you and I are
[1:04:39] living in the day of another revealing
[1:04:41] of the mezic ministry in which God has
[1:04:44] come down and he's unveiling himself in
[1:04:47] humanity and you remember what mzc is
[1:04:49] mzc is the power of an endless life so
[1:04:53] when he come to Abra and Sarah they
[1:04:55] received the power when it come in the
[1:04:57] middle of the book they received the
[1:04:58] power and when it come here at the end
[1:05:00] of the book we're receiving a power as
[1:05:03] well now we know that mzda had come to
[1:05:06] give them that body changing Ministry
[1:05:08] and it showed up the second time now
[1:05:10] think about it produced a a Rapture It
[1:05:13] produced a body change at the first of
[1:05:15] the book It produced The Rapture the
[1:05:16] Resurrection the days of Jesus
[1:05:19] underneath that Ministry and if it
[1:05:21] produced a resurrection and It produced
[1:05:23] a body change the first time it produced
[1:05:25] it the second time what about the day
[1:05:27] that we're living in will it not produce
[1:05:29] the exact same thing right here in the
[1:05:31] end time it must produce a resurrection
[1:05:34] and it must produce a body change so you
[1:05:37] realize we are looking at that same
[1:05:39] Ministry now milic to many the scholars
[1:05:42] you read about it they don't understand
[1:05:43] nothing about it but you and I we've
[1:05:46] heard about this we've seen it for years
[1:05:47] and years and years and we know that
[1:05:50] that mesic Ministry has come right back
[1:05:52] in the end time again think about it
[1:05:54] what did MDC do with Abraham just before
[1:05:58] he leaves notice the last thing that mzc
[1:06:01] did with Abraham was he took communion
[1:06:04] is that right what was the last thing
[1:06:06] that Jesus done with his disciples he
[1:06:08] took communion what's the last sermon
[1:06:10] William Bram
[1:06:13] preached we're right back into that same
[1:06:15] ministry again now in Revelation the the
[1:06:19] Bible tells us by Revelation that
[1:06:22] there's something laying here then
[1:06:24] that's going to be a parallel of the
[1:06:26] first the coming and the third and we
[1:06:28] know that the Bible tells us whenever it
[1:06:31] comes to the Book of John that Jesus
[1:06:33] loved
[1:06:35] Lazarus and he loved Martha and Mary as
[1:06:39] well he loved Lazarus he loved Mary he
[1:06:42] loved Martha for the Bible says in St
[1:06:44] John 11:5 that Jesus loved Martha and
[1:06:47] her sister and Lazarus so these people
[1:06:51] are not strangers to him but notice he
[1:06:54] loves them he cares about them and
[1:06:57] Lazarus gets sick and Mary and Marth are
[1:06:59] concerned about Lazarus being sick and
[1:07:02] so now what they're going to do is is
[1:07:04] what the prophet says what every
[1:07:05] believer's going to do whenever they
[1:07:08] have a need they're going to call Jesus
[1:07:10] on the scene so notice what they're
[1:07:12] doing they're doing the right thing
[1:07:14] because they are believers Martha's a
[1:07:16] Believer Mary's a Believer are you
[1:07:18] hearing that they are believers in the
[1:07:21] ministry of Christ they are believers in
[1:07:23] the Ministry of the son of man and the
[1:07:25] first thing they're going to do is
[1:07:27] they're going to call Jesus on the scene
[1:07:29] which proed they are genuine Believers
[1:07:32] and brother tells us that Jesus is not
[1:07:34] only coming on the scene when you call
[1:07:37] him but he's longing to come on the
[1:07:39] scene for you so here is Martha and Mary
[1:07:43] Lazarus is sick and they know that he's
[1:07:45] dying and so whenever he's dying the
[1:07:47] Bible says in verse six when he had
[1:07:49] heard therefore he was sick he Abode two
[1:07:52] days in the same place where he
[1:07:57] was so Jesus doesn't just jump up and
[1:08:01] run down there and get all all upset and
[1:08:03] all worried and everything going on
[1:08:05] notice he doesn't just jump up and
[1:08:07] around down there he waits two more days
[1:08:10] but the problem is after two days
[1:08:12] Lazarus is dead I'll tell you had that
[1:08:15] been your pastor you would have fired oh
[1:08:18] my you took your name off the church
[1:08:19] book you pulled your bench up you'd head
[1:08:21] it right out the back door you know why
[1:08:23] it does prove sometimes we don't
[1:08:25] understand the way that God does things
[1:08:28] amen but notice Jesus Waits two more
[1:08:31] days but now Lazarus is dead he's gone
[1:08:34] he's completely he's completely to the
[1:08:36] place to where they've taken him down
[1:08:38] and now when Jesus doesn't come
[1:08:41] immediately remember here is the Jews
[1:08:44] that are around Martha and Mary now
[1:08:45] they're familiar with Martha and Mary
[1:08:47] they're familiar with Lazarus being
[1:08:49] raised in that part of the country so
[1:08:50] they're familiar with them and the
[1:08:52] moment that Jesus Jesus doesn't show up
[1:08:55] when everybody else thinks he should the
[1:08:57] Bible says and many of the Jews came to
[1:09:00] Martha and to Mary to comfort them
[1:09:02] concerning their Brethren isn't that
[1:09:05] convenient that whenever Jesus do come
[1:09:09] here comes the Jews now let me let me
[1:09:12] give this to you the way that I see this
[1:09:13] today remember Martha and Mary is
[1:09:17] following the son of man Ministry
[1:09:19] they're following the ministry of Christ
[1:09:22] which means they've come out their
[1:09:24] synagogues they come out of Jewish
[1:09:26] tradition anybody hear me I'm talking
[1:09:28] about Believers they've come out of her
[1:09:30] my people they've left the teaching
[1:09:32] theyve left the Traditions they've left
[1:09:34] the Pharisees they left the Sadducees
[1:09:36] they they've come out of all that but
[1:09:38] notice after they come out of their
[1:09:40] temples and they've left their churches
[1:09:42] whenever Jesus doesn't show up here com
[1:09:45] some Jews to comfort them can you
[1:09:48] imagine the reproach can you imagine the
[1:09:51] reproach of here is these Jews now
[1:09:54] they've left their Temple they left
[1:09:55] their Church no doubt some of the people
[1:09:58] upset you leave our church bless God
[1:09:59] you're going to split hell wide open but
[1:10:01] notice here they come and notice what
[1:10:03] they're doing we know Jesus ain't here
[1:10:05] but we're here to help you we are here
[1:10:08] we still love you we still care about
[1:10:10] you Martha we know what you called our
[1:10:12] our congregation you know you called us
[1:10:14] off scar you called us Tommy Rod you
[1:10:17] called us Children of the but we
[1:10:19] we we forgive you for that and we know
[1:10:21] that we don't agree on everything but
[1:10:23] want to tell you we are here for you now
[1:10:26] Jesus ain't here but we are here where
[1:10:28] is Jesus when you need him to most at he
[1:10:31] ain't nowhere to be found but I want you
[1:10:33] to know we're here to help you and we
[1:10:35] got all kinds of we got all kinds of
[1:10:38] programs and small groups and all types
[1:10:40] of things to help you we got an old kind
[1:10:42] priest down here you can confess to him
[1:10:44] anytime you want to and it's so mother
[1:10:47] Church opens up her arms to welcome you
[1:10:50] back and no doubt these Jews are seeing
[1:10:52] that Jesus ain't here and they're
[1:10:54] Whispering among themselves I knew he
[1:10:56] was false I knew there was something
[1:10:58] wrong about him I going to tell you I
[1:11:00] knew there was something about that
[1:11:01] Jesus where's he at when these people's
[1:11:03] got a real need at where's he been found
[1:11:05] that they called and he wouldn't even
[1:11:07] come I hear he went another Direction I
[1:11:09] hear he went down to another house you
[1:11:11] know why this Situation's too great for
[1:11:14] him he can't fake
[1:11:17] this this time Lazarus is not
[1:11:20] sick he's dead so in their Darkest Hour
[1:11:26] where is Jesus at but little oh watch
[1:11:30] the top now little did they now know
[1:11:33] that while they were doubting Jesus
[1:11:36] Jesus was on the way when oh Hallelujah
[1:11:40] whenever they was doubting the word and
[1:11:42] they're doubting God coming in the
[1:11:44] middle of that don't you free see
[1:11:46] friends that knowing this first that
[1:11:48] scoffer shall come walking after their
[1:11:50] own lust saying where is the promise of
[1:11:53] his coming
[1:11:54] and the whole time our D get coming he's
[1:11:56] coming right among them they may not
[1:11:59] know it they may not see it but he's
[1:12:00] right among them
[1:12:06] Hallelujah here's their answer the Lord
[1:12:09] is not slack concerning his promise as
[1:12:12] some men count
[1:12:14] slackness so they're doubting Jesus
[1:12:16] anybody catching the picture yet so here
[1:12:19] is believers they are being made fun of
[1:12:22] they're being ridiculed for the message
[1:12:24] that they're
[1:12:27] believing here they're being talked
[1:12:29] about because of the message they're
[1:12:31] believing here they are being laughed at
[1:12:34] because of the message they're believing
[1:12:36] and they said they're following a man
[1:12:38] somewhere or they're offing some cult
[1:12:40] somewhere and the whole time oh let me
[1:12:42] and the whole time God was right there
[1:12:44] among them he was on his way because God
[1:12:47] is Not slack concerning his word and the
[1:12:50] whole world is doubting Jesus and the
[1:12:52] whole world is doubting his coming but
[1:12:55] let me tell you he's coming he's coming
[1:12:58] you may not know it you may not see it
[1:13:00] but he's coming he's coming for you and
[1:13:02] it's coming for me that's what the word
[1:13:04] says
[1:13:07] amen verse
[1:13:09] 17 then when
[1:13:14] Jesus
[1:13:18] come look at the way he finds the church
[1:13:21] I mean the people when he comes he found
[1:13:25] that he had lay in the
[1:13:26] grave four days
[1:13:29] already Jesus ain't on my time he ain't
[1:13:33] on your time he comes at the right time
[1:13:36] at the right day in the right hour and I
[1:13:38] heard the prophet say just the other day
[1:13:40] he said there ain't nothing out of cater
[1:13:42] it's just us that thinks it
[1:13:45] [Applause]
[1:13:46] is verse 20 then Martha said listen to
[1:13:51] this Martha as soon as she
[1:13:55] heard that Jesus was coming she went out
[1:13:59] and met him but Mary sat still in the
[1:14:02] house now watch the way this comes
[1:14:04] together so
[1:14:06] Martha hears that Jesus is coming and
[1:14:10] her faith is elevated to the place where
[1:14:14] she wants to meet Jesus but not Mary
[1:14:17] Mary sits still in the house showing
[1:14:20] that God's got a season and time for
[1:14:22] every person to receive their own
[1:14:25] Revelation notice the way he says as
[1:14:27] that have not I sent 1962 you talking
[1:14:30] about a powerful statement he said to
[1:14:32] Martha they've been saying that she was
[1:14:34] dilator and things about keeping her
[1:14:36] house
[1:14:37] clean but when The Showdown come she
[1:14:41] showed her color Hallelujah that's right
[1:14:45] when The Showdown come she showed her
[1:14:48] color so she may have just look like a
[1:14:50] housewife and she may have just look
[1:14:52] like she was dealor
[1:14:53] about making sure the beds was made and
[1:14:55] the house was clean and the food was
[1:14:57] ready and the kids got everything they
[1:14:58] needed but when The Showdown come that
[1:15:00] Revelation it went beyond her Duty as a
[1:15:03] housewife it went beyond her duty of the
[1:15:05] clothes and her duty of the bed and
[1:15:07] everything don't you see when the real
[1:15:09] Revelation strikes us I don't care if
[1:15:11] you're a woman in the house or a man in
[1:15:14] the factory when The Showdown comes
[1:15:16] that's when it's going to prove what you
[1:15:20] got Hallelujah when the show down come
[1:15:23] she showed her color yes sir Mary Mary
[1:15:27] the one that was always found by Jesus
[1:15:29] the one that was always down watching
[1:15:31] him speak hearing he said the one you
[1:15:33] would have thought that would have ran
[1:15:34] out to meet him is sitting in the
[1:15:37] house and Mary was sitting weeping
[1:15:40] because of her brother being dead but
[1:15:44] Martha went
[1:15:45] out and met the living words I want to
[1:15:49] say that real
[1:15:50] slow she went out and and met the Living
[1:15:57] Word the one that's concerned about the
[1:16:00] house being just right and the dishes
[1:16:03] being put away Mary the one that like to
[1:16:06] sit and hear Jesus preach but when
[1:16:09] Martha heard that he's coming she left
[1:16:11] the
[1:16:12] dishes anybody hearing me she left
[1:16:15] everything else anything else that was
[1:16:17] in paror and become secondary whenever
[1:16:20] she heard Jesus was coming so notice
[1:16:22] when she years that he's coming it
[1:16:24] actually puts Martha into action there's
[1:16:27] a reaction from the action and when she
[1:16:30] heard and Faith cometh by hearing
[1:16:32] hearing by the word don't you see that
[1:16:34] predestinated seed laying inside of
[1:16:36] Martha whenever she hit it oh my you
[1:16:38] would have thought she cared nothing
[1:16:40] about the preaching nothing about the
[1:16:41] word she's just another church CER but
[1:16:43] when The Showdown come here come that
[1:16:45] predestinated seed raising up outside of
[1:16:48] mar don't you see friends it didn't
[1:16:50] matter how dark the situation was it
[1:16:52] didn't look how bad it was when she
[1:16:54] heard that Jesus was coming the Bible
[1:16:57] said she ran out to meet him she went to
[1:16:59] meet the Living
[1:17:01] Word now watch her
[1:17:03] mindset verse 21 then Martha said unto
[1:17:06] him Lord had you been here that is a
[1:17:09] powerful
[1:17:11] Revelation our brother wouldn't have
[1:17:13] died proving proving that life and death
[1:17:16] can't exist in the same place at the
[1:17:18] same
[1:17:19] time had you been here Martha says that
[1:17:22] our would even to die look at her faith
[1:17:25] in the word if you been here death would
[1:17:27] have been an unwelcome visitor there
[1:17:29] would have been no way that Lazarus
[1:17:30] would have died had you been here you
[1:17:32] would have casted that from him verse 22
[1:17:37] but I know I'm not guessing I'm not
[1:17:40] wondering I'm not just asking I know I
[1:17:43] know I know that even now whatever th
[1:17:46] ask of God he will give it to thee yes
[1:17:49] it's a hard time yes it's a dark time
[1:17:51] yep there's trouble everywhere yep it's
[1:17:53] been four days and Lazarus has already
[1:17:55] rotten in the grave but I believe that
[1:17:57] even now that's where our faith has got
[1:17:59] to be at today even like that no matter
[1:18:02] how bad it looks no matter what the
[1:18:03] doctor scan says the MRI the X-ray no
[1:18:06] matter how bad that it looks whatever
[1:18:08] the word says He says even now Lord
[1:18:12] whatever you ask God let me say that
[1:18:14] same thing for you even now whatever you
[1:18:16] ask God the doctor May give up on you he
[1:18:19] may tell you there ain't no way you're
[1:18:20] going to make it but I want to let you
[1:18:21] know even now Lord even now whatever you
[1:18:25] ask God even now listen not maybe not
[1:18:27] sometime even
[1:18:32] now
[1:18:34] Hallelujah doubt Wants To Rule The Mind
[1:18:37] had you been here four days ago oh my
[1:18:40] know what people say oh if Jesus was
[1:18:42] just here oh if brother Bon was still
[1:18:44] here I want to tell there's a greater
[1:18:46] than Solomon that is Among Us Willam BR
[1:18:48] may not be here Paul may not be here but
[1:18:51] almighty God is still
[1:18:56] here when you face sickness that must be
[1:18:59] your confession even now no matter how
[1:19:03] bad it looks well I got all kinds of
[1:19:06] finan even now Lord on notice he says in
[1:19:11] perseverant even now whatever you ask
[1:19:14] God listen to this
[1:19:17] boy that got the cogs
[1:19:21] moving they begin to come together
[1:19:23] listen to this Faith begin to meet with
[1:19:28] God so what she heard produced the
[1:19:31] person
[1:19:33] Christ you seeing it what she heard
[1:19:36] produced a real Jesus and her faith
[1:19:39] begin to meet with god listen to this
[1:19:41] top it's just like putting the negative
[1:19:45] and positive together you're going to
[1:19:47] get light pretty
[1:19:49] soon you ever had your car batter go
[1:19:52] dead and that car battery can be dead
[1:19:54] about 4
[1:19:56] days but if you take another vehicle and
[1:20:00] you hook up some Faith cables I mean
[1:20:02] some jumper cables and you hook that up
[1:20:05] oh let me tell inside of that dead
[1:20:07] battery is some C sales in there
[1:20:10] Hallelujah inside them CES has the
[1:20:13] memory and the ability to be able to
[1:20:15] retain power but you got to have a real
[1:20:18] Jesus and a real faith and the real word
[1:20:20] and you hook that up to a dead battery
[1:20:22] and you allow that power to go inside of
[1:20:25] it and it goes from a dead battery to a
[1:20:27] live battery it goes from a dead Church
[1:20:29] to a Living
[1:20:31] Church
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:36] Hallelujah that's the way Faith Works
[1:20:39] you got to let your faith connect with
[1:20:41] the word of God in order to restore
[1:20:43] power to the
[1:20:46] believer
[1:20:47] Sometimes some of us when we was young
[1:20:53] we'd hook them up
[1:20:55] backwards let me tell you what you get
[1:20:57] you may get a bad
[1:20:58] radiator but let me know what happens
[1:21:01] you hooking up backwards you're going to
[1:21:03] get a lot of spark you're going to get a
[1:21:06] lot of movement you're going to get a
[1:21:08] lot of
[1:21:08] action but you ain't going to get no
[1:21:11] power are you hearing me that's what
[1:21:13] Pentecost had they had a lot of spark
[1:21:16] they had a lot of excitement but let me
[1:21:18] tell you the vehicle ain't going nowhere
[1:21:20] but this message come to tell us how to
[1:21:22] hook our faith up into the word of God
[1:21:24] we don't have listen we don't want just
[1:21:26] spark we don't want just that we want a
[1:21:28] power that's going to take us from one
[1:21:30] dimension to another we don't want just
[1:21:33] can we talk about or Fellowship around
[1:21:35] we want something that's going to get us
[1:21:37] out of here and change our bodies in a
[1:21:39] moment of twinkling and
[1:21:42] eye even now whatever you ask God and
[1:21:47] Jesus said unto her he gives their the
[1:21:50] entire
[1:21:51] Revelation and he says my brother shall
[1:21:54] rise
[1:21:56] again and then Martha goes to
[1:21:59] thinking she goes through the
[1:22:01] understanding in her mind he Lord I know
[1:22:05] one
[1:22:07] day there's going to be a pie in the sky
[1:22:09] and the B
[1:22:10] pie Lazarus is going to come forth as
[1:22:13] the rest of the
[1:22:16] Dead Martha's talking about a
[1:22:19] resurrection that is to come yeah she
[1:22:22] was talking about a future event
[1:22:26] right but Jesus he ain't talking about
[1:22:29] an event come on yeah he's the purse of
[1:22:33] the Resurrection so when you got the
[1:22:36] resurrection near you're not waiting for
[1:22:37] something to happen you got the person
[1:22:39] of the Resurrection The Resurrection is
[1:22:42] more than just an event we believe in
[1:22:43] the resurrection we believe that it's
[1:22:45] coming but I want to tell you'll never
[1:22:46] be a part of that Resurrection if you
[1:22:48] ain't met the person of the Resurrection
[1:22:51] too many people are looking for event
[1:22:53] and they fail to recognize the message
[1:22:55] that God has sent Among Us the reality
[1:22:57] of the
[1:22:58] word that's right notice verse 25 and
[1:23:03] Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:23:05] resurrection and the life and he that
[1:23:06] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:23:09] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[1:23:11] believeth in me shall never die
[1:23:13] believest thou this so watch she's
[1:23:15] asking the question he's asking a
[1:23:17] question he says I'm going to tell you
[1:23:19] what you're looking for I am yeah think
[1:23:22] you're looking for in the future I'm the
[1:23:24] one you're looking for look he's
[1:23:26] unfolding the very mystery of his coming
[1:23:29] he's this is the son of man he's
[1:23:31] unfolding the mystery of his
[1:23:33] coming he's revealing the secret of how
[1:23:37] he's going to come in the last days I
[1:23:40] didn't just come to comfort Martha I

[1:24:09] take her back to the Living Word to
[1:24:11] bring her faith to a higher where she's
[1:24:13] not just looking to the future but she
[1:24:15] believes that that same God is alive
[1:24:17] right now can do whatever you
[1:24:20] ask you he come to take her faith back
[1:24:23] to the original word and notice her
[1:24:26] response yay Lord I believe that thou
[1:24:29] art the Christ you told matter of
[1:24:30] Revelations you're the Son of God which
[1:24:32] come into the world in other words he
[1:24:34] says that she says amen yeah amen listen
[1:24:38] the believer punctuated The Words of
[1:24:40] Christ with an
[1:24:43] amen so you got the coming of the son of
[1:24:47] man you've got listen you got Martha who
[1:24:51] has met The Living Word you got Lazarus
[1:24:55] which is
[1:24:57] dead but something's got to happen
[1:25:00] before the Resurrection
[1:25:03] comes all the bride has got to get
[1:25:06] together so Mary is sitting in the house
[1:25:10] so in order for Mary she has got to come
[1:25:13] to this same Revelation and her and Mary
[1:25:16] listen they're alive upon the Earth and
[1:25:18] they're remaining at this time here's
[1:25:20] the words you got Lazarus which is the
[1:25:22] sleeping dead so we got those which are
[1:25:24] alive and remain we got that which is in
[1:25:26] the grave and we got the Living Word
[1:25:28] that's calling for the
[1:25:30] bride you see
[1:25:32] it so
[1:25:34] Jesus tells her what to do verse 28 and
[1:25:38] when she had so
[1:25:41] said she went her way and called Mary
[1:25:44] her sister
[1:25:45] secretly isn't that
[1:25:47] incredible that during the hour of her
[1:25:51] faith being restored back she's not
[1:25:54] calling her as a public show but she
[1:25:57] calls her
[1:25:58] secretly and she tells her the master
[1:26:01] has come so notice it's not a public
[1:26:04] show first pull is a public show second
[1:26:08] pull is a public show but the third poll
[1:26:10] is going to be a secret now Martha had
[1:26:13] caught the Revelation that Jesus was
[1:26:15] calling for and now that she's caught
[1:26:18] that Revelation from Jesus himself look
[1:26:20] what Martha's doing she she's running
[1:26:23] with the
[1:26:23] message she's got the Revelation now
[1:26:26] listen don't you see the bride top once
[1:26:28] the Revelation comes now here is Martha
[1:26:31] she's coming to get married and she's
[1:26:33] got this mystery she's got this secret
[1:26:36] she knows his message he's coming he's
[1:26:38] coming he's coming there's coming a
[1:26:39] resurrection she had the message that he
[1:26:41] ain't just come but he's here right now
[1:26:44] he is here and he's here to call you
[1:26:46] secretly not that just one day he's
[1:26:50] here so Martha repres represents the
[1:26:52] bride and God's using the voice of the
[1:26:54] Bride to call the rest of the
[1:26:59] Bride she's running with the message of
[1:27:01] the resurrection and that message is
[1:27:04] Christ is here don't you see my Ministry
[1:27:08] isn't just to tell you he's coming come
[1:27:10] on I'm here to declare he's
[1:27:13] here so it is the top then that the
[1:27:17] Rapture and the resurrection notice
[1:27:18] theam tells us in the Rapture message
[1:27:21] 1965 the first thing that comes forth is
[1:27:23] his message calling the bride together
[1:27:25] it's his message calling the bride
[1:27:28] together the next thing is the
[1:27:30] resurrection of the sleeping bride the
[1:27:31] ones that died back in the other ages
[1:27:33] they're caught up together the trumpet
[1:27:35] the feast in the heavens and the sky now
[1:27:37] the first thing is the sounding the
[1:27:38] first thing is a shout then a voice and
[1:27:40] then a trumpet so a shout is a messenger
[1:27:45] getting the people
[1:27:47] ready I'm telling you Martha's met him
[1:27:51] and she's got the re reation and now
[1:27:53] this Revelation is inside of her heart
[1:27:56] and she's running into the house to get
[1:27:57] married because she is a possessor of
[1:28:00] the
[1:28:01] word he said the shout is a messenger
[1:28:03] getting the people ready the second is a
[1:28:05] voice of the Resurrection the same voice
[1:28:07] the loud voice and St John 11 they call
[1:28:09] Lazarus from the grave he's getting the
[1:28:11] bride together then the resurrection of
[1:28:13] the Dead to be caught up with it now
[1:28:15] watch three things take place what is it
[1:28:18] I shout a voice and a trump so the same
[1:28:22] voice that called Martha and called Mary
[1:28:26] is the same voice that's going to call
[1:28:28] Lazarus what's the secret it's the voice
[1:28:30] of God and every bit of it don't you see
[1:28:32] that's what this message is that we've
[1:28:34] received in this hour it is the
[1:28:36] bridegroom's voice calling to the bride
[1:28:38] to get her oh don't you see that's what
[1:28:42] God has done in this day he has sent his
[1:28:44] own voice hallelujah it's more than just
[1:28:47] the Kentucky it's the voice of God using
[1:28:50] our body not MDC to reveal what Christ
[1:28:53] is doing
[1:28:54] [Applause]
[1:28:56] now so you got the dead in the graves
[1:28:59] you got
[1:29:00] the living bride which is already alive
[1:29:03] and here's the ministry of the son of
[1:29:05] man you got Martha and you got Mary that
[1:29:07] has already come out of the
[1:29:08] denominations but after they come out
[1:29:10] they've got to have the real original
[1:29:12] Faith to be able to be a part of the
[1:29:15] Resurrection amen amen here come the
[1:29:20] word of God in the darkest hour and the
[1:29:22] prophet says that this last age is the
[1:29:24] darkest out of all the ages and when
[1:29:27] Martha hears that Jesus is coming listen
[1:29:29] to this Jesus interrupts
[1:29:34] mourning he interrupts Sadness the
[1:29:38] Living Word interrupted her mourning of
[1:29:41] the
[1:29:42] Dead it looks like there's no hope it
[1:29:44] looks like there's no way it looks like
[1:29:47] Le osia is going to Snuff everybody out
[1:29:49] and there ain't nobody going to be ready
[1:29:50] it may seem that way and it may look
[1:29:52] that way but it ain't going to be that
[1:29:54] way because God's already promised in
[1:29:56] his word he's going to have a bride and
[1:29:58] he's going to have a people and I'm
[1:29:59] going to tell there's people in this
[1:30:00] building that's going to be a part of
[1:30:03] it Hallelujah listen friends we cannot
[1:30:06] shove this off for somebody else you
[1:30:08] must believe that you are the body of
[1:30:11] Martha and
[1:30:13] Mary thank you Lord Martha cannot sit
[1:30:17] still any
[1:30:18] longer when she hear Jesus says this
[1:30:22] watch Faith put her in action to go meet
[1:30:25] the word and now the word is putting her
[1:30:27] in action to get in as many as she can
[1:30:30] before the resurrection takes place I
[1:30:32] got to get in everybody that I can don't
[1:30:34] you tell me this friend listen to me we
[1:30:36] don't want just our four no more we
[1:30:38] don't want just these people that's in
[1:30:39] this we want to reach out cast the night
[1:30:42] net to everybody that we can we got the
[1:30:44] Peril of great price I don't want to see
[1:30:47] nobody miss it I don't care what
[1:30:48] denomination they here we don't want
[1:30:50] nobody to miss it
[1:30:52] [Applause]
[1:30:55] it so the word causes Martha to raise to
[1:30:59] her feet not just sit and twit her
[1:31:05] thumbs a resurrection's coming it's in
[1:31:09] it but the resurrection will not take
[1:31:12] place until all the bride Unite with the
[1:31:16] word you see it don't you see how
[1:31:19] connected you are in to this
[1:31:22] Revelation don't you see how the
[1:31:24] Readiness of the Bride is connected with
[1:31:27] the Rapture don't you see he is not
[1:31:29] going to lose a one it is completely
[1:31:32] totally impossible listen you may have
[1:31:34] children that's out here in the world
[1:31:35] doing what they want to do but I want to
[1:31:37] tell it's impossible for God to lose one
[1:31:39] of them it is totally completely
[1:31:41] impossible how can God lose one of them
[1:31:44] your name is inscribed on the bottom of
[1:31:47] his hands it is totally impossible I
[1:31:49] don't know what God's going to have to
[1:31:50] do what they're going to have to go
[1:31:52] through but God's going to make sure
[1:31:54] that Martha and Mary is

[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:03] Revelation when she come where Jesus was
[1:40:07] she fell down his feet and saying to him
[1:40:09] Lord if You' been here her brother not
[1:40:12] died wonder where she got that
[1:40:14] idea she recognized who she who he was
[1:40:18] and she knew that death couldn't touch
[1:40:19] Lazarus so she comes to that same place
[1:40:23] because she responded to The Master's
[1:40:25] Call she heard her name she got the
[1:40:31] Revelation and now she's got it you know
[1:40:34] what it's time for now
[1:40:36] Resurrection yes Martha's got it Mary's
[1:40:40] got it you got the Living Word Christ
[1:40:41] has come he's here the Revelation has
[1:40:43] come what's the last thing
[1:40:46] Resurrection because they got some
[1:40:49] blood they got some blood kin that's
[1:40:52] down there in that graveyard I said we
[1:40:54] got some blood kin that's laying down
[1:40:57] there in that tomb but after the bride
[1:40:59] is gathered together now it's the season
[1:41:01] of the resurrection and I want to tell
[1:41:04] we've got Brethren we've had people
[1:41:05] we've buried people in the last five
[1:41:07] years in our assembly it's unbelievable
[1:41:09] how many funerals that I have done but I
[1:41:11] want to tell we're coming to the last
[1:41:13] one we've got a lot of good brothers and
[1:41:15] sisters that has went by the way of the
[1:41:17] grave and let me tell you not just in
[1:41:19] this day all the way back into day
[1:41:21] they've went down to the Grave down the
[1:41:23] first the second the third the fourth
[1:41:25] the fifth but I want to tell you the
[1:41:26] Bible says the last shall be first and
[1:41:28] the first shall be last they went down 1
[1:41:31] 2 3 4 5 6 seven they're going to come
[1:41:34] back up 7 six 5 4 3 2 1 BL all
[1:41:37] resurrection and
[1:41:43] Rapture and here comes Jesus think about
[1:41:47] it the Bible says Jesus therefore saw
[1:41:50] her we weeping the Jews weeping which
[1:41:52] came with her he groaned in the spirit
[1:41:55] and was
[1:41:56] troubled Jesus
[1:41:58] groans but why why would Jesus groan and
[1:42:04] B said the reason something groans is
[1:42:06] because it's not in its rightful
[1:42:08] condition yeah so Jesus sees a Lazarus
[1:42:12] that's not in his right condition glory
[1:42:15] and now there's a groaning didn't Paul
[1:42:17] said there's going to be groanings
[1:42:18] everything is groaning Waiting For What
[1:42:20] manifestation of the sons of God Jesus
[1:42:23] groaned because Lazarus is not in his
[1:42:26] original
[1:42:28] state says everything's
[1:42:32] growing the only way you can grown and
[1:42:34] wait for it is because there's New Life
[1:42:35] coming here that speaks of a new world
[1:42:38] eternal life in you is calling for a
[1:42:40] body that cannot go by the way of the
[1:42:42] Grave which means we're calling for
[1:42:46] them you don't even know it today but
[1:42:49] your body when you get sick sick and
[1:42:51] it's groaning you're calling for a body
[1:42:54] they can't get sick they can't get down
[1:42:57] they can't get discouraged that can't
[1:42:59] get depressed yeah Jesus coming up to
[1:43:02] that grave he's wiping the tears from
[1:43:05] his eyes think about the humanity of
[1:43:07] Jesus he's wiping the tears back he's
[1:43:09] wiping the flood he love
[1:43:11] Lazarus and then he called Lazarus by
[1:43:15] name and I always loved it and I always
[1:43:19] will at the Prophet has always made this
[1:43:21] statement he said had Jesus not called
[1:43:24] Lazarus by his name yes everything in
[1:43:27] the grave everything let me tell you how
[1:43:30] much I believe that not only would
[1:43:33] everything every person that had died in
[1:43:35] that grave had Jesus just said come
[1:43:37] forth every deer every antalope every
[1:43:40] cow every bug every flea every even a
[1:43:44] little bit Little bitt M you know had
[1:43:46] Jesus said come forth everything that
[1:43:48] would have died had to give way to the
[1:43:50] master because that's how much
[1:43:51] resurrection power lays in his voice it
[1:43:54] would have all come
[1:43:56] forth and a man that had been dead four
[1:44:00] days do you understand it was against
[1:44:04] the law of the Jews to even be around a
[1:44:08] dead body after three days you wouldn't
[1:44:11] even allowed to be around it it's the
[1:44:13] law you cannot be around it because
[1:44:15] that's when corruption sets in and here
[1:44:17] this Lazarus corruption has set into his
[1:44:19] body the Prophet said his nose had fell
[1:44:22] in his eyeballs is already
[1:44:25] gone Glory but Jesus come after the
[1:44:29] law glory to God and he calls Lazarus by
[1:44:34] name and I want to tell you Jesus didn't
[1:44:37] have to fight with the bugs in his body
[1:44:39] all right worm spit his eyeball out give
[1:44:41] it back give me his eyeball right I said
[1:44:43] give me all he has to do is speak and
[1:44:48] when he speaks that creative word it
[1:44:50] reached out to whatever place that
[1:44:52] Lazarus was in at that time maybe
[1:44:54] Lazarus was over their fellowship with
[1:44:55] Abraham and Sarah maybe Ezekiel and
[1:44:57] about that time he hears his name
[1:45:01] Lazarus everybody around say did you
[1:45:03] hear that was that your
[1:45:06] belly I think I heard my name
[1:45:09] Lazarus come for and in a moment in a
[1:45:14] twinking and a twinkling of an eye
[1:45:16] Lazarus is back in his
[1:45:19] body
[1:45:21] that's how quick God can change
[1:45:25] you let's stand our feet
[1:45:28] today Jesus calls him by name and that
[1:45:32] higher
[1:45:33] law that went over the worms went over
[1:45:36] corruption it went over the body of
[1:45:39] Lazarus and when it moved over
[1:45:41] Lazarus the worms had to get
[1:45:44] back they didn't have no rights to the
[1:45:47] body you know why because the word the
[1:45:50] dominating word the supernatural power
[1:45:53] of the Resurrection was greater
[1:45:55] higher than corruption that's by our
[1:45:58] hearts but ter won't you come can you
[1:45:59] come play for me come play Oh friends we
[1:46:05] are living in the
[1:46:06] day that we've recognized by the coming
