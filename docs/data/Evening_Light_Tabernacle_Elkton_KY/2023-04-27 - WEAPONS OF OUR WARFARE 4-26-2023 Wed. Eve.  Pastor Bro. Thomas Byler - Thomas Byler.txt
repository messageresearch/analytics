really really considered a privilege Lord to be able to assemble ourselves together Lord knowing father what you said about this being upon memory one day and we don't know when that will be taken from us and just how it'll all be but father it's always good to be in the house of the Lord with your children Lord and to open your sacred word Lord Jesus knowing father God that you come and meet with us Lord Jesus you promise never to leave us nor forsake us but to speak to us along the way so that we could go and say it hasn't it been good to be in the house of the Lord father I pray tonight that you'll just bless me Lord with being able to get out of the ways so that you could use your gift Lord to speak to your people the things that you once said Lord close my mouth or anything that

wonderful God like you that meets all of our needs father we love you and ask God your bless you upon the reading of the word the meditation of our heart now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen amen so I don't feel like just didn't feel like I got finished Sunday and and uh so we want to just kind of continue on Amen on kind of the same thoughts some of the same scriptures go over some of these things and uh see what the Lord will have for us amen tonight amen tonight I want to title that the weapons of our Warfare amen the weapons of our Warfare amen and I didn't realize it really until just lately amen I guess in the last few service and didn't realize it amen but uh before this we spoke on character isn't that right the gold the character and so forth amen and we of course went to uh the character his divine nature and his and so forth and talking about the Statue of a perfect man amen Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and so forth amen but come to find out amen that these this character has a dual purpose amen it has a dual purpose I mean it's not only our character but let me just uh read what the prophet of God says he says you know what is the armor of God or Christianity then brother bam says love and joy and long suffering and goodness and meekness and patience amen see he says all those things are Supernatural he talks about love and joy what is it amen peace long-suffering he says you can't buy it it's supernatural and the whole armor of God or of the Christian of the is Supernatural amen and we're bitten by the scriptures to put on the whole armor of God Amen praise be to God so we find the Dual Purpose the things that it is it's our character and it's also our weapons amen our armor amen praise the Lord so we want to dwell with that for tonight for just a little bit we don't want to try to preach tonight we just want to have a lesson would that be okay and then we're going to try to have just a lesson here we have to praise the Lord but uh anyway so may God that is let really we haven't read we haven't been getting old turn your bibles if you will turn your Bibles to um I believe it's found in Ephesians yeah Ephesians is where we want to go amen Ephesians and also second Peter and I think we'll read second Peter our first Peter first uh first Peter 5 and if you have your scriptures also there in Ephesians 6. amen just get it ready for both of those and first Peter 5. now I want to read what I read amen I believe Sunday amen as we try to lay a little foundation with the help of the Lord amen we do plan on going tomorrow morning Lord willingly and Caleb amen go down there to the Virginia meetings at least for Thursday and Friday and then Lord willing to head back Saturday so pray for our traveling mercies amen looking forward to hearing some of these good preachers down there amen and taking a couple of services in amen all right first Peter and five and we'll begin with verse 8. be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast now notice the word resist there it'll be going along with uh the same word that Paul used over in Ephesians amen talking about um standing against The Wiles of the devil amen so now notice here he says goes who resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus and you have suffered a while make you perfect and establish and strengthen settle you amen over in Ephesians 6 and verse 10. finally my brother finally my brother in verse 10 of chapter 6 be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God Amen that ye may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand that was the word I was looking for a minute ago amen over there it's at Peter said uh this amen steadfast into Face Paul here talking about it he said that you may be able to resist or withstand in that evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your low end skirt about with truth and having on the best plate of righteousness and you feed shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Amen take that and we'll stop right there the god add His blessings to the reading of the word you can exceeded amen I had something in my mind and and the way that I had thought it and as I would begin to study it this afternoon and I ran across this and I really liked it because it really uh kind of Vindicated that my thought pattern was in the right direction amen remember I talked Sunday about how that no matter how many how many uh battles they won no matter how even even uh you know David with Goliath Samson and shamgar and all these they still were defeated they were still defeated amen because and they lived in defeat and brother Brandon he puts it this way and he was talking about Arnold Von Winkle Reed amen of Switzerland and how that I mean y'all remember the story well of how that they were surrounded by a much more Superior uh Army than what they were they were just farmers and so forth and and Arnold took it upon himself and uh to to tell his brother that he was going to give his it's like I for his country that day biggest bunch of Spears they had and he charged those Spears you know and screaming out Make Way for Liberty Make Way for Liberty as he plunged himself into those Spears is that right and because of his heroic uh move and heroism amen it routed the enemy in one place I believe brother ma'am said they haven't had a war since not for a very very long time amen and the Swiss people from what I understand had actually gotten away from God because of the fact they never had war never had it hard but it was in anyone he was uh talking about this and then he talks about the Lord Jesus Christ he says I want to tell you something he says one day Adam's race had been backed into a corner the law had failed the Justice had it failed the prophets had failed the judges had failed everything that God sent on Earth had failed amen so we look at that and realize that no matter what any all of that happened all the Old Testament they were still living in a failed State a defeated defeated State isn't that right amen and Adams Ray stood defeated amen sickness among them death among them everything deaths and in every place nothing could be done but in heaven there was one that stepped out the Son of God said this day I will give my life for Adam's race amen amen I thought much of what I've said about how that we uh we have got with the blood then of that war that happened on how much it was like it was like that we were we were defeated we were losing every time and amen we had a great hero to raise up amen that right to come down and fight for us and bring through the Enemy Lines so that we could actually enjoy some victory for a change amen it made us all Victorious because of what he did and brother Ben I'm talking about the Old Testament all this and man and so he says now and I noticed this day we're like I'm alive for Adam's race what will you do cry Dean just what will you do he came to the Earth he looked upon that bunch of men and women that wanted to serve God but they couldn't there was too much Temptation and I'm going to say there is still that carnal nature on the inside isn't that right no matter how much they pray not what they want there is still that amen that that prevailed that that black dog that prevailed things that there's a white dog so to speak amen y'all know the story of the how you doing chief oh it's pretty good pretty bad you know he's what do you mean he's well ever since I got saved there's been two dogs in me you know and there's a black dog and a white dog always fighting at each other isn't that right always fighting at each other and so forth world but I said well which one wins and he said well the one that I feed the most and isn't that the truth in our daily life the one that wins is the one that you feed the most because that black dog will always be there with you as long as you live amen amen amen I uh gonna read a scripture in a minute but I'm gonna just go ahead and read a little bit he says this I say then this isn't I won't tell you I'll tell you later this I say then walk in the spirit and shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen how many believe that for the flesh lusts us against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to another others so that you cannot do the things that you would well I'll tell you what if a preacher wanted to just stop there see you ain't never going to be able to do what you want because they're like she's always going to stop you huh you could stop there if you wanted to it says you can't do what you want but how many beliefs you need to really read the rest of them and then notice the very next verse yes but if you be letting the spirit ye are not under the law and praise the Lord but that doesn't have a fact if you're led by the spirit of God praise be to God let me finish my story so now notice he says in that and I noticed uh there was too much Temptations there's too much sin so much sickness so much troubles on every hand they couldn't everything had failed and he looked and he found the darkest spot of man's fear and that was that amen not only this but we could go through all his whole life there was sickness there was blindness huh there was confusion about what the truth was all kinds of things you don't have to come and show the way but the last death that he destroyed and the worst was and that was this it's always been and right right he ran right on to Calvary and got the thickest of the spirit and they throwed it into his heart and he cried back he says take what I leave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fight hey man how many blades he won the victory for us brother I mean if there ever was a time that those disciples pick up that baptism of the Holy Ghost one of the mightiest weapons has never been given to the hands of men and they cut a hole through sin they defeated the devil running him back with his sickness and all these other things men wants to see heroism men are waiting for a gallon stand the world's waiting to find a man that'll step out amen how many believe that yes sir to step out just like the disciples did amen defeated sickness defeated sour defeated amen being disfellowship with God praise be to God now notice here he makes another statement that I also printed out because I really liked it he says here not long ago he said they said when Divine Healing was going forth 10 years ago when I started out on the field and said you can't do it brother man I'm saying science is against you the doctors against you modernism is against you but I said but Christ is for us that's right now others have seen it they've cut holes through everywhere man we've got people surrounded we're surrounded with people that are surrounded by the enemies but my broad neighbors our family and different ones that we know that it's just being pounded by the devils and demons and such but the Bible let's speak huh oh my God no such things at the days they were saying the days of Miracles just passed right about the time the prophet of God showed up anymore aren't you we had a mighty warrior come it was Jesus Christ through the prophet of God showing us amen praise be to God how many he believes he's still the mighty warrior Christ still the so he says that's right others have broken through till now with all of that there's Big Revival fires kindled on every Hill of the world every nation under Heaven early it's having healing revivals and so forth going on hey man what is it it's wanting to see that gallon displayed your neighbors wanting to see it with you how many leaves that your neighbor is wanting to see that heroic amen gallantry from you and from me they want to see Christ they want to see that somebody that has the victory that defeats the enemy so your children how to defeat the enemy so your neighbor how defeat to the enemy praise be to God all right let's talk about the weapons of a Warfare with just the help of the Lord for a little bit shall we amen oh my God is good isn't he hey man I'm gonna read this last quote just one more he proves his weapons of Warfare when he healed sick when it thousand he proved that he had power over every atom that there was not only did he grow the fish but he growed cooked fish [Laughter] they got out of that basket there was five fishes and five Lords every time he took a little piece off there was another beat there and they didn't need just grown to fish but it was good whoo you talk about instant folks how many believe that again give you faith for whatever your issue is God can fix it all right away from the beginning to the end we ain't gonna go fishing catching and so forth he didn't say go catch some more fish I'm gonna make sure that the fish come and swim into your net no I didn't have to do that he just reached in how many believes his weapon was real I mean we need the weapon of faith is real aren't you glad that you serve a super demand he prove to you too and I can prove it by your Bible she says I don't believe it but if you can prove it by the Bible amen what did she do she went over to that one script scripture was cheap as Jesus wept he wrapped like a man see he was just the man he said your argument is thinner than the shadow of the brass of chicken that starves to death wasn't the chicken that starved for death it was the shadow of the chicken that starved today you might get a little out of a chicken that started that but you're never gonna get anything out of a shadow of a chicken that starved there hey man it was shallow he said that's right he was a man you know whenever he stood Lazarus grave he said a man that had been four days dead he says come forward Lazarus she wouldn't have said Lazarus he'd just said come forth prophet of God said it all come how many believe one of these days he's going to say come hither church and the whole church everybody filled with the Holy Ghost is going to go I'm looking for a feeling what did he say I'm gonna feel myself just go up how many believe that that's right he's gonna call and I'm gonna answer if I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he will cause oh don't get me off here but when my savior calls I will answer when he calls for him yeah I will hear how many believe that but if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you ain't got nothing to pull with remember the magnet story brother random went to a big old factory one time and they were showing them how a sweeper would come over and get all the loose shavings and everything else and it would just suck it up and they'd go over and remold and me shaking he says well it takes up all the seals and there was aluminum shavings and stuff on the aluminum wouldn't pick up and man that thing come on over there and they picked it all up and he was showing him I was doing and they picked all them up when that thing coming over there he says you need to stick it over there and do it he says well glory to God he says what do you mean folks he could watch a conveyor go across a magnet and get a revelation isn't that right he says that's the way it is going to be one of these eggs a mental great magnet of God will come across everybody that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be brought up and everybody that's made of a movement or something else ain't gonna get no pulled up they're not gonna go you're gonna just sit right there for the tribulation period oh Hallelujah amen God is good isn't he all right back to teaching oh I love teaching because I love preaching and teaching amen you love the Lord all right so every devil boy I tell you what he broke every devil power listen man was refused to go to heaven the highway was closed there was no highways for us amen but there was listen and he come to make one oh my the first line was Demons of doubt the next was prejudiced the next was selfishness this Earth was covered over with lines of demon powers I didn't believe that true folks when he when he come to defeat every devil every demon free to set you free we ought to appreciate our freedom amen Prejudice selfishness your carnal nature hatred there and simulations must disease Jesus amen but when he began to send up to heaven amen listen last night we had him come on out of Hell's with the keys of death and hell this morning we're taking up Hallelujah he says when he assigned it he was triumphant he went up he broke every devil power that holds over man amen he ascended on high and gave gifts to men the gift of the Holy the mighty conqueror he stands alone this morning and between him believer is that that's an Old Highway of Holiness that the righteous walk on it there's no way of Escape there's only one line cut down through glory and he left bloody Footprints as he walked through the corridors of the demon powers and made a highway for us all to go through and he sits on high this morning as the mighty come amen forget his name now I lived in down in Memphis I believe it was he used to believe sing that oh Behold The Mighty conqueror amen oh Behold Him in plain view amen I forget the brother's name but you still love to hear but that's the truth isn't it he is that Mighty conqueror all right let's look at let's look at this let's look at this character that we have As Weapons because it's better than he made it that is Supernatural is that right so we're going to go two places first first I want to go to Ephesians perhaps before we go to Galatians let's go back to Ephesians and I want to take one scripture at a time with the help of the Lord amen Paul says verse 10. finally my brethren if he is six and ten be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might can I just say what comes to mind I can just just about here Paul telling us that right now for our generation for you and for me finally Brethren look at where you've come to look at where we are finally it's time to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might the power of His might how many knows Paul said when I am weak then he is strong seriously get us to be weak in ourselves awesome amen I find that when I'm weak and I'm really really down like or whatever I realize I say Lord I'm weak but now you can be strong and he always is amen however he's the power of His might not your might or my might but his might put on that whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Wows of the devil praise be to God for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rumors of Darkness of this world again spiritual wickedness in high places amen I do not know I have not really heard the prophet or did any kind of research on what the high places are so I just kind of pray Lord what are the high places amen what are the high places you know my opinion is your heart and your mind and brother bam say that the devil wants but God wants the heart and isn't that what all principalities in our schools and what they're teaching our kids right now and stuff they want their minds because if they get their minds they'll get their heart and they'll persuade these kids that America is bad isn't that what they're doing that's right out there they're persuading the kids that America is bad isn't that terrible it's communist brother Branham said there was right in woven in Among Us don't worry about communism over there watch the stuff that's right on the inside but so my thought is your heart and your mind are high places the devil wants it and God wants it because what is this heart it's the control tower of your life and your mind is a high place because whatever you allow to come in here isn't that right will dominate and come down and dominate to astounding here it has to first come through the mind that's why the prophet of God set the greatest battle ever for is fought where in the human mind so to me that's the high places that's where the battle goes on is in the heart hurt and in the mind amen wherefore take unto you know the whole armor of God Amen Hey Brother Bam Sister a wicked in adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there'll be no sign given it to it but design of the prophet Jonah which according to what brother Phantom says was the The Sign of the Resurrection all right Paul Jonah coming forth about in a resurrection form amen after so many days coming forth amen and he said that was for this Jenna brother bam says that apply to our generation that this is a wicked and an adulterous generation let me believe that sure is very Wicked very adulterous generation amen that you might be able to withstand in other words to resist against amen to overcome to withstand it not to be overtaken by it and we know that the devil this just comes to my mind now even but my wife I think it was this morning we probably talked about now that we think about it and she was talking about how that you know look at that look at the Demonic powers that are around us now remember back in the 60s brother Brown says the lid has come off of hell and streams and streams demon powers are coming out upon the Earth now so that's exactly right because you didn't have it in the early 1900s or the 1800s you didn't have the wickedness yeah no none of that stuff isn't that right so it they were they were kept at Bay I believe it was in the future of the prom promise that brother bam talked about no demon powers and so forth that were held because the church held is that right because the Holy Spirit held them back because when we got church hey Church holes demons demon powers away Church keeps the families together it keeps your life together you get away from that watch out isn't that right people got into rock and roll as soon as they got Elvis out as soon as some of that began out evil begin to come out of course we got rap music and now all that stuff and it's just turned every loose they can't even hardly fly through the air anymore without having to throw people off isn't that right I may recent news about this plane had to take so many of them fighting each other and biting each other and all kinds of stuff oh my you can't you can't have ball games anymore they have riots hit the ball games you're getting that shot at a birthday party and this side of the other or oh my violence shall be increased how many violence is certainly being increased oh my folks I'm here to tell you uh and I could go back and I won't because it's kind of the sideline of where I want it to go and not what I wanted to think but uh brother bam says you know lawlessness is what it's going to Prevail lawlessness and he said a lot about it's going to become very Lawless and look at what it is they don't want the laws anymore oh yeah amen in the evil day that you might be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore and I got to thinking about it you know because this battle that you and I are in this and it's life I mean life life itself is a battle I mean you're in it whether you want to be in it or not and you're either going to be taken by this lion amen Aurora I'm either going to devour you or you're going to have to take a stand against you one or the other and we know that my you know and you cannot cannot at any time and I think this goes along with what Brother Brad said and not at any time can you let down and become lukewarm and just float with the tide because if you knew the devil would come on in there somewhere isn't that right and that's what I believe we got to watch every album every channel hey man that's why you got to stand and have all your lawyers have every thing in order because if devil looks and he's trying to get in any way that he possibly can but I got to thinking about this and one of the things that kind of took me in this direction is where brother bam was saying he says you know in um I'm thinking it might be the greatest battle ever fought and he was talking about these channels and so forth he says no don't don't wait look at how long you can fight with the devil on something he said stop him riding his tracks as soon as that thought comes or whatever just stop it right there huh how many leaves because just now let him kill him right there you don't want to battle with him don't let him in just like thoughts that come over your head come into your head how many know you gotta deal with it right away because you can't let that bird come in there because if you let that bird come in sometime it'll make a nest oh and it'll get you thinking of thinking of thinking and then guess what it'll lay eggs because from not just this but this and this and this and this it'll have eggs and have little birdies for them after a while chirping on your head yeah what kinds of little birds that you don't want on your head is that right amen I know what I'm talking about because I I gotta get kill that bird kill the eggs and everything else if I let it build a nest in my head because you're sure how many knows you'll try to do it he'll have a whole flock of little babies on your head and thinking if you don't watch out all right praise the Lord so my thought was be vigilant Bible says be vigilant you know I don't know exactly what Vigilant means but I would think that it probably means something on the order of diligent perseverant amen not lukewarmer haphazard about it in other words stay alert let me knows that in your battle you got to stay alert watch those arrows that's coming your way because you're sure you're gonna come your way amen so you got to be vigilant because he's an adversary amen can't just float with the tide of your feelings you know what feelings are really good for feelings are good you need feelings we need more feelings amen not that we go by him as our doc and so forth but you know when you're feeling that operating no if you can't feel for people you can't help them you got to feel for people images and this this will actually go in towards the end of my talking about love how to he uh loved that man that was a Mexican man and he thought about where did his shoes would fit him or his coat would feed him and so forth and when he was overcoming that great big bull is that right remember that he was overcoming that great big bull and he apologized to the bull for being in his territory and for disturbing him folks I'm here to tell you when we have that kind of feelings for each other we will overcome a whole bunch of devils but we don't want to hurt each other's feelings that's free isn't that right but that's what we should we should each and every one of us see God help me not to hurt because we can unintentionally so many times hurt each other's feelings amen and I'm probably the worst hope not but anyway Lord help you all pray for me amen the Lord's working on me he really is but that's what good feelings are good for if it's operated by the love of God God can use it and do great things with it he can actually manifest himself through there amen all right well now we talk about one of the weapons because remember remember what we said about um let me see here we'll just go to it right the fruit of the spirit brother Branham said was our spiritual weapons but the fruit of the spirit is love right now it's a character but it's also a mighty weapon as a matter of fact brother Benson's greatest weapon in the Christian Arsenal is the love of God I would say the next to that is Faith Now by this faith hope and love the greatest is love and I would say the next is Faith amen God's favor was one of the most powerful weapons that we have no I'll just I'll just cover that right now and that is what is prayer did you ever see any tank movies of World War II where they have to grab these big shells and put it into that chamber and and boom you know well prayer is putting the bullet in the gun ask and you shall receive Steve isn't that right so you gotta ask put that in there pray it and then watch it happen amen boom amen and it doesn't matter how many times you've gone misfires and that weapon says no matter how many times you don't go off just another one put another shell in yeah well they didn't happen but I still believe God is God and God will do it huh just keep firing it'll work you'll kill that devil don't quit just because it didn't work a time or two or it didn't fire amen but that's what prayer is it's the most powerful weapon amen because it brings God on the scene and it puts that bullet in that gun amen so I'll I'll jump over here is that okay for a second the fruit of the spirit is love amen and that's the most powerful Joy how many knows Joy if you have joy that's the opposite of being sad huh down-hearted peace it's the next one how can peace be a weapon let the peace of God the Bible says rule in your heart in other words it's ruling and if you want to keep that peace what do you do whenever the Devil comes and tempts you and say new yeah we'll just get on out of here I like the peace that I got now many knows that uh at one time we were at war with God we couldn't have peace with God because we always doing things that God didn't like didn't wasn't pleased with and I believe it's in Romans right quick I believe it's in Romans it says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God amen once you get Justified and God forgives you of all of your sins you come right with God then you've got peace with God and it's a weapon against the enemy because God the devil wants to take your peace huh got the peace that passes understanding down in my heart you know I believe that when you have peace just wonderful you're at peace amen you're at peace you're at peace with me you're angry [Music] no no and let me just say this I hope I can get this and I got this rope down but it's kind of like um when Jesus was on the cross they kind of wanted him to hate them the devil didn't really want him to die on the cross and pay the price what did they say if thou be the Christ come down off the cross how many notes even our Prophet said the Bible says you know he had the power to call Twin Legions of angels and foreign did he come off the cross he didn't come off the cross because that's what the devil wanted him to do he wanted him to act like the devil would get Vengeance on him come down there and straighten things up and then we'll believe no you didn't believe you wouldn't believe now you're just crying to get me the same devil that had him up on the mountain attempted him up there was there at the cross tempting him come on down come on he said nah I'm not coming on down if I did come on the whole approach you want amen but what did he do begin amen that's back before we mentioned it a little bit Sunday I believe it worked on how they love conquers everything I mean there's nothing more powerful amen than love and he conquered through love amen and goodness be not overcome by evil but overcome evil with good and of course the next one is mentioned here and that's faith that's the fruit of the spirit it's the character of a Christian but also it is fate I mean we'll talk about faith again and in a minute over in the book of Ephesians means that you have already overcome Pride overcome Pride with meekness temperance world does not have Temperance they do not have self-control and if you have Temperance that means that that Temperance already overcome your self you've already overcome again such there is no law and they that a Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts amen for if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit and a couple weeks ago it says the Holy Spirit has to teach us how to talk the Holy Spirit has to teach us how to walk how do we walk we walk in the spirit every step that we take Lord help us I'm sure you're with me this evening every step that we take in the spirit Lord help me to do everything that I do in the spirit according to the spirit because just one one time I just lose you here uh uh oh that's that's you you messed up you messed up the walk isn't that right you get back down on your knees and say Lord forgive me I tripped right there the devil does trip us don't he but you got to get back up and say Lord let me walk in the spirit amen and that long-suffering Amen Let me just mention this but the long-suffering goes along with patience isn't that right now we know that the Bible says that those our forefathers and so forth he says Those Who through patience inherit the promises patience is a virtue or strength there's a lot of people that do not have patience with God I mean no matter what you're facing be patient and let God do it because most people don't want to wait on God I want it done now is that right Abraham had to wait 25 years no uh had to wait 120 years inherit the promises you and I Christendom has been waiting for 2 000 years then it's a waiting on the coming of the Lord Brother Brahman places his own Houston over here over there waiting on coming to the Lord be patient unto the coming of the Lord amen that's why any one of us can appreciate endurance but God said time-tested memorials people that are tested by maritime that person has been a Christian for years and years and years and all I can see is Christ in and growing closer to Christ that's got to be God right there because we could just mean too many of them that they're just not serving God anymore they're not serving God anymore you got to have long suffering and you got to have patience be patient on Amen praise the Lord's Ahmed believes those are weapons they're a strength amen back to Ephesians again that you may be able to verse 13 against the walls of them having done all to stand stand therefore I mean your loyal and skirt about with truth amen in other words you got to be in the truth now I wrote down here aren't we glad that we have truth she said I am the way I am the truth and so many times we look at the prophet of God and we so we thank him brother Brian was just a brother that was able to surrender to almighty God odd and then God could do these things because God gets all the glory don't he God gets all the glory amen even one place he talked about the healing and so forth he don't really like to even lay hands on people and so forth because as they'll say well brother man ladies hands up I mean I got well he says no you shouldn't do that it's crazy it's the word and try to get you to have hey in Christ and this Christ that gets the glory how many believe that ministers all of us it's Christ that gets the glory because we're just a sinner saved by grace like anybody else amen but what makes us great is to be able to yield ourselves to God that God can use us but a lot of times we tend to lay the glory on the man amen amen how they say one time well brother Branham healed that person that's in correct that completely Incorrect and of course it's kind of the sect of the message that wanna make brother Branham more than what he was it was God through the problem but of God that does it any minister is the same way as God through them if we can get you to have faith amen how many appreciates faith there's been a lot of healing take place right here in this church I don't believe it I believe that amen I think brother Tommy was one of them that I admire his faith is that right a lot of us say well I'm Healed praise God I'm accepted I believe it but very few will stay stop taking their medicine and they could drop dead easily because of it you gotta have a revelation but it might honorable faith if it's a real Revelation hey live or die I'm I'm believing it amen but to see what God has done it's a real tremendous story and it's not anything that person's faith in Revelation every one of us how many believe that sickness and all diseases no matter what is just put your faith in the almighty God live or die God amen God will do it truth all right let's go a little longer on truth because I really want to touch on faith yet if I possibly can we no longer have to wonder what truth is because he came and did greater things in our generation than when he did that well deep what then what Jesus did while he walked the Earth and not So Much Greater because our prophet of God says he couldn't do much greater than race Eliza was from the dead on the fourth day isn't that right he couldn't do much greater than speaking things into existence and so forth I think one place uh perhaps one place but abandon mentioned that it was greater is because there was already fishes there was already loaves but when he spoke squirrels into there was no squirrels uh there was none God just completely to smoke him right into existence but more it means more he said more Works than these shall you do even Jesus said more Greater Works because I go to my father and to know that Christ came in our generation and proved himself over and over and over Vindicated himself Vindicated what was the truth amen wouldn't it be something if we had a prophet and we believed he was prophet but what he said just doesn't back up with the word we'd have an issue that would be really bad wouldn't it but to know that he was took us right back to the Bible indicates that he was really a prophet of God and not a false prophet it's because you can take everything right back to the word that's why I went to Saints when he was carried over to the other side and all those Saints and so forth the angel said you're going to be judged for what you have preached and brother bam says well we're Paul going to be judged for what he preached yep well praise God I'm good to go there can you imagine brother man who over the other side confidence because I just said what he did oh you know we have a debate we have a debate on on he's seen all of this his his converts were over there now I'm not not saying but people to me well there's that everyone is that me already over there my theophany or what I don't know but I'll tell you this if I would be over there I would be I'd be with that crowd that said we're resting on that we're believing that are you with me tonight that's right we're resting on that we're believing it because what he said was the word had to be Christ nobody could impersonate it nobody can impersonated remember a lot of times a lot of critics would come up the brother bands and they kind of criticize him and and not this out of the other you know what he said he says okay then you you come up here and do that he said you do it you know what it got them to do thank you shut up tithing it shut up because it's not me doing it it's Christ doing it anyway you God didn't call you he called me to do it he's the one that spoke to me I let treaty said you are God your message is going to fall around the Christ you're going to pray for potent dates and things Monarch you're gonna go over the world Peppers go back there and she'll Shake yourself off huh even he didn't believe it but he done it not by his own power but by the power of almighty God now I'll tell you what if people are on a message if we fade and if we die out and if we go into the cycle of death Christ has to come before we completely die amen because there's no other age coming no other message you're coming you see how close it is how many people just close I don't know about you but I don't believe I'm gonna die out my fire's not gonna burn out your Fire's not gonna burn out if you're a seed of God at all I'm in his lad for the truth that's right you're loins gird about with the truth no matter who you talk to you could take them right back to the truth amen back to the word of God Hallelujah and having on the breastplate of righteousness we didn't even know what righteousness was until the prophet of God came we thought that doing this and doing that and not doing this and not doing that and having our hair right and our dresses right and and men doing right this down the other that was not it's not righteousness it's when the blood of Jesus Christ has watched you from all of your sins his holy spirit is in there making the address right live right do right think right it's his righteousness because a lot of people do all of that from the Toronto they don't don't count none amen no it's got to be his righteousness we have the breastplate of his righteousness and your feet shot but the preparation of the gospel of peace amen I like that I talk about peace a while ago I mean that's the gospel is look God wants you to come back out of the chaos of the devil Scott Chan and bring you back to peace with God how many believe God wants you at peace with him amen the devil don't want you at peace with him above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked now how many knows it's going to be darts come at you amen I like that song Living by faith in Jesus above amen amen and it goes something about that and I feel no alarm while you're living by the faith of Jesus Christ without faith it is impossible to please God and I wrote down here I wrote down here you know just to have faith for your salvation that's wonderful but you got to live by faith no matter what comes your way live by faith have faith in God because you're not going to please God if you don't have faith for whatever comes your way how many believes we need to live by faith let Faith govern your entire existence amen that's what pleasing to God oh my so faith there again it's part of the character it's part of your character remember Faith down there and it's also a weapon the one of the mightiest weapons ever stop there for a while that right by faith we have access unto God the Bible says no not unto God into disgrace therefore being justified by by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace where when we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God in other words it gives you access to his grace his forgiveness he's Calvary everything all this again man you don't have the work to have your sins all you have to have is the faith of God dropped into your heart and we know that's by Grace also let me believe that and it's mighty weapon it'll destroy my my my my keep Faith at the Forefront of every one of your channels that is in your being keep faith on the Forefront and every time the devil tries to shoot something it's just Ricochet off Ricochet negative thought everything you shouldn't think we should rickety off I wish I had that poem or that saying cerebral hear no evil and so forth always do all right amen praise the Lord I'm so glad that I'm on the other side of that right now amen because was it when I was in the world this is when I was in the world I wore a shirt says See No Evil Hear No Evil do no evil think no evil have no fun that's what I wore yeah but I found out that it wasn't so fun it wasn't so much fun it left you completely empty and Barren now I realize Lord help me I don't want to see any evil I don't think any evil I got us a t-shirt brother Glenn I got as a t-shirt See No Evil Hear No Evil think no evil have a lot of fun have a lot of fun that's right thing no evil thing no wrong do no wrong and I'll tell you what you're going to have a whole lot of fun it's going to be a whole lot of fun that's right amen because that other one is a lie of the devil that's the devil's life thinking you're gonna have no it's all a lot of devil praise the Lord praise the homily believes we need the faith of God on the Forefront to quench every fiery Dart that the devil throws at you how many believes this on a daily basis every day you gotta have your card up amen whatever comes our way coffee is more than able to handle it because it was by faith that the Bible says by by faith God framed the whole world do you realize this whole planet the Stars everything was put there by God's faith and now that faith is in you what kind of world can you create ask anything in my name I will do it amen with you nothing shall be impossible Jesus said how many believes we ought to be Mighty we ought to be up there flying into Heavens president we're Eagle we're astronauts brother Austin we're not just Earthbound creatures we're not we're driving the airplanes anymore we're not driving these little old Jets we're not driving the supersonic B-52s no where is she we're in the spacecraft up there on the outside Realms of any kind of thing that pulls us back and our speed is unlimited let me believe that that's how many wants to live there there's no telling what God will do you'll just have faith in him and you will quench all the fiery darts the devil throw you away I think Brother David said many times man where would we be Brother David if it wasn't for God's mercy and Grace the faith that God put down in our hearts amen the devil had killed me a long time ago amen he almost killed me many times isn't that right by the Glen you too probably took you almost many times a lot of us have that testimony almost got killed here and I almost got killed there amen with gasified by their brand Devil Couldn't take you because even out there how many believes God had his eye on you even out there I was watching now can I say something there are no oops with God oops nah there's no oops with God no oh coming no [Applause] he sees it coming he knows all about it you know today you were conceived not only did they were and see if I'm in the Bible he knew you before the foundation of the world that's right we gotta go way back come on I don't just get too excited but that's the exciting thinking that he knew you before the foundation of the world he thought of you before the foundation of the world he knew who he was he knew what your name would be he knew who your mom and daddy would be he knew you'd sit in church he knew all about it so sit down he's got you I mean he believes he's got you he's got you he gonna take care of you he began a good work in you and he promised he would perform it till the day of Jesus Christ whoa come on people and I'm excited this Little Flower I think he's gonna take care of you you've got that faith in that belief folks that's sorrow just Vanishing me that fear just vanished away amen God bless you tonight how many once more for those weapons you want everyone to be diligent vigilant because you're adversary the devil that's a roaring lion he don't sled up slow up or nothing but guess what are you with me let's kill him where he stands let's kill him in these tracks stop him I think he said but let's say kill him stop him in these tracks just like Jesus did how many how did Jesus do it the word of God the word of God will defeat the enemy Anytime Anyplace under any conditions however brother Branham also said that the faith the sword of the spirit I didn't cover that did I I'm going to cover that yet let me finish it then I'll be done and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God how many but he's got to take the sword of the spirit a lot of people just got emotions they got a lot of spirit they don't have the sword of the spirit the sword of spirit is the word when the Devil comes and meets you you better have the word of God and you tell him the word of God you get sick or something you said the word of God said by his stripes I am healed the devil tries to tell you you ain't one of God yes I have accepted Calvary and I know that he said he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live shall have eternal life just use the word God it'll cut him but like I said as the prophet said that sword is only as good as the arm that wields it how many believe that if you got a weak arm and you just can't barely wheel it it's not gonna do too much is it it's got to be a strong arm of faith that wields that sword remember Josh lame man he didn't have to have to let me go pray about it now he was prayed out he had perceived that that guy had Faith to believe to heal he says it's silver and gold have a none but such as I have I give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and he leaked up and walked isn't that right Joshua he didn't have to have a prayer meeting he had faith amen and he said Son stand still now I don't know about you but I can't help but believe it was the inspiration of the Holy Spirit speaking and God heard and he stopped it mighty mighty faith in the word of God Jesus when he said to the devil remember the devil came to him he says you you're hungry after 40 days of fasting in Matthew 5 I believe it is he's just if that be the Christ command these songs to be made into bread huh Jesus knew it was nothing but a trick he said the word of God says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God brother Brown says man he tried it again with pride amen popularity I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world and so forth he got he come up against uh big old high-powered electrical line that right the devil grabbed the hold he coming he got a shock of his life brother bam says he got his feathers singed that day how many beliefs today I was going to get his feathers singed by those by you and I faith in almighty God he's going to get his feathers singed once again when he comes at you remember this now if you don't get nothing else amen when he comes at you is something Singh Is feathers amen tell him to go back where he come from get thee behind me say how many believes that resist the devil and he'll flee from you
