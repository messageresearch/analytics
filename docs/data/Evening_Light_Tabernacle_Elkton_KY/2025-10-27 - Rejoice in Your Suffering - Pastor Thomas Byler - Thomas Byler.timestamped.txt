[0:00] Peter said again in chapter 4, 1 Peter 4
[0:03] and verse 11 or 12, beloved, I think it
[0:06] not strange concerning the fiery trial,
[0:08] WHICH IS TO TRY you as though some
[0:10] strange thing happened to you. In other
[0:13] words, MY WHY DOES THIS GOT TO happen
[0:15] today? Why did this happen?
[0:19] Huh? This is weird. Is this stren? No,
[0:23] it's not.
[0:25] No, God is testing you.
[0:28] It's more precious. Your tests and
[0:30] trials of your faith are more precious
[0:33] than gold. How many believes that?
[0:36] Because Paul said, "I reckon that the
[0:38] sufferings of this world are not to be
[0:40] compared with the glory that is revealed
[0:44] that will be revealed
[0:46] from heaven."
[0:48] Amen.
[0:51] That's right. But rejoice in so much as
[0:54] ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings,
[0:59] that when his glory shall be revealed,
[1:02] ye may be glad with exceeding joy.
[1:06] Hallelujah.
[1:09] See, be sober. Be vigilant.
[1:12] For your adversary endeavor, as a
[1:14] roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom
[1:16] devour he may devour, who resists
[1:18] steadfast in the faith, knowing that the
[1:21] same afflictions are accomplished in
[1:22] your brethren that are in the world. But
[1:24] the GOD OF ALL GRACE WHO HAS CALLED US
[1:26] by his eternal glory by Jesus Christ
[1:29] after you have WENT ON A FLOWERY BED OF
[1:31] EASE for a while.
[1:34] That don't sound right, does it?
[1:36] Everything has been going good for you.
[1:40] No. After you have suffered a while,
[1:43] make you perfect, establish, strengthen,
[1:48] AND SETTLE YOU. BROTHER BAM SAID THAT
[1:50] EVEN JESUS WAS MADE PERFECT BY
[1:52] SUFFERINGS.
