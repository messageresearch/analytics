[6:47] will i be confident
[7:03] for in thy time of trouble he shall hide
[7:06] me in his pavilion and the secret of his
[7:08] tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set

[8:23] he shall strengthen my heart wait i say
[8:26] on the lord let's just pray over the
[8:28] scripture heavenly father we're just
[8:30] grateful to be in your house this
[8:31] morning lord and we're thankful for the
[8:34] word as the word's been placed before us
[8:36] lord jesus and lord we just come to hear
[8:39] from what you would have in store for us
[8:41] this morning we asked your blessings
[8:43] upon the this reading that was just read
[8:45] into our hearts lord we asked your
[8:47] blessings upon the sunday school
[8:49] uh the lessons that will be taught and
[8:51] lord upon the minister of the word and
[8:52] the the singing of our voice and the
[8:54] musicians this morning we asked your
[8:56] blessings and favors lord and as the
[8:58] word says in the scripture we just read
[9:00] we wait on you lord for we can do
[9:02] nothing in ourself but we trust in you
[9:04] in jesus name amen
[9:06] brother lebron
[9:08] you can be seated
[9:18] morning brothers and sisters
[9:21] you know we were reading that psalm
[9:23] everything about psalm tells you one
[9:25] thing
[9:27] uh
[9:27] your example
[9:29] everything you're looking to is not the
[9:31] circumstances around you or what's going
[9:33] on in the world but your example the
[9:35] thing you should be looking to the thing
[9:37] that's providing you light and comfort
[9:40] is the lord himself jesus christ
[9:42] so what should you worry about you know
[9:45] if it's already been settled
[9:47] if you would turn with me to
[9:50] if you want to hold two places ephesians
[9:53] the fifth chapter
[9:55] and then back in joshua
[9:57] everyone knows that joshua is a great
[9:59] man of god
[10:01] if anyone i think of
[10:03] when i think of joshua the thought that
[10:05] comes to my mind when i think of him and
[10:07] his example
[10:09] you know there's a saying among you know
[10:11] always faithful
[10:12] if you think of joshua
[10:14] or any man like joshua that's mentioned
[10:17] in the bible he was always faithful in
[10:20] his office
[10:21] he never wavered from
[10:23] what god destined him to do or told him
[10:26] to do he was always faithful in the
[10:29] things of the lord i mean that's that's
[10:31] a true example for any of us to follow
[10:34] whether it's in a natural sense when
[10:36] you're dealing with people or in an
[10:39] experience or in a religious experience
[10:42] that you're always faithful in the
[10:44] service that god puts you in but i was
[10:46] just thinking of something
[10:48] that's in these chapters if you would go
[10:50] to the fourth chapter
[10:54] you know we have a foundation in our
[10:56] lives
[10:57] we we have the word of god we have the
[10:59] experience that god gives us in the word
[11:01] the foundation that he builds with and
[11:03] i'm just going to read
[11:05] if i read too much you'll have to
[11:07] forgive me i i say that a lot but i do
[11:09] it i'll start at this fourth verse and
[11:11] this goes
[11:13] they were just about to cross over the
[11:14] jordan river
[11:17] joshua allows the people to prepare
[11:19] themselves and i'll read in here if my
[11:21] pronunciations are wrong
[11:23] i ask you forgive me and
[11:24] this is the fourth chapter of the book
[11:26] of joshua and said
[11:28] and it came to pass when all the people
[11:30] were clean and passed over jordan that
[11:32] the lord spoke unto joshua saying
[11:35] take you twelve men out of the people of
[11:37] the tribe
[11:39] amen and command ye them saying
[11:42] take your hands out of the midst of
[11:44] jordan out of the place where the
[11:45] priest's feet stood firm
[11:48] fall of stones
[11:49] and you shall carry them over with you
[11:51] and leave them in a lodging place where
[11:53] you shall lodge this night joshua called
[11:56] the twelve men whom he had prepared
[11:59] of the children of israel out of every
[12:01] tribe of man so
[12:03] every man was told to take a stone out
[12:05] of the river
[12:06] and then joshua said unto them over
[12:09] before the ark of the lord your god
[12:11] into the midst of the jordan and take
[12:13] you up every man you as stone upon his
[12:16] shoulders so these weren't small stones
[12:19] they had to put them on their shoulders
[12:20] so they were substantial
[12:22] in size upon his shoulders according to
[12:25] the number of the tribes of the children
[12:27] of israel this may be a sign among you
[12:30] that your children ask their fathers in
[12:32] a time saying what mean ye by these
[12:35] stones then you shall answer them that
[12:37] the waters of jordan were cut off before
[12:40] the ark of the covenant of the lord when
[12:42] it passed over jordan and the waters of
[12:44] jordan were cut off and these stones
[12:47] shall be a memorial
[12:49] unto the children of israel forever so
[12:51] joshua was setting up a memorial he
[12:54] the lord knew there would come a day
[12:56] when joshua wouldn't be here the
[12:58] children that cross over the jordan
[13:00] wouldn't be here but god left an example
[13:03] for the children in the land that they
[13:05] could look back on to know that god had
[13:07] done something for him and there was an
[13:10] example for him and uh if you jump with
[13:13] me to uh ephesians
[13:15] the fifth chapter if i don't get ahead
[13:17] of myself i i was sitting there this
[13:20] morning
[13:21] and i was just thinking about the world
[13:23] we live in this morning
[13:25] and
[13:26] both in our in a christian perspective
[13:28] and in a worldly perspective
[13:31] the the devil and society is trying to
[13:35] remove all them stones all those
[13:38] examples
[13:39] from us as people whether it's in a
[13:41] governmental sense or in a christian set
[13:44] all the examples they're tearing down
[13:46] for you as an individual that you had
[13:48] trust in they're trying to put
[13:50] everything in a place that's worse in
[13:52] the church than it is out there in the
[13:54] world because you don't have no
[13:55] confidence in what's out there in the
[13:57] world but when you see people in this
[13:59] message or people that you thought were
[14:01] christians and you start seeing people
[14:04] like that fall but they have no
[14:06] foundation anymore you know those are
[14:08] those that is tearing at the very fabric
[14:11] of society of church and the people and
[14:14] i'll just i was just thinking about it
[14:16] what it is
[14:18] is unless you have that foundation you
[14:20] have that experience in your heart and
[14:23] in your life this morning
[14:25] you're going to be you're not going to
[14:27] be able to stand in the age that we live
[14:29] in and i just wrote here there was
[14:31] numerous examples that we're supposed to
[14:33] follow
[14:34] but uh
[14:36] i was just wrote you have joshua and the
[14:38] 12 stones where god actually instructed
[14:40] a man to leave a physical example for
[14:44] the children of israel to know
[14:46] that what god had done for him
[14:49] and then he goes on you can think of
[14:50] jesus chose 12 disciples that when he
[14:53] knew he was going to leave the earth he
[14:55] chose 12 disciples that after he
[14:58] ascended and came back in the form of
[15:00] the holy ghost that he had 12 people on
[15:03] the face of the earth that could spread
[15:05] the message of god and then you go then
[15:08] you think of paul's ministry and his
[15:10] miracles and his teachings all these
[15:12] principles and you can see it going
[15:15] through the last 2000 years through the
[15:17] church where we all know from the
[15:19] message of the hour god raises up a
[15:21] messenger
[15:22] raises up a message for that time that
[15:25] we live in and people follow it but what
[15:27] i'm thinking about this morning
[15:30] is
[15:31] the devil your enemy your adversary is
[15:33] trying to tear down every foundation
[15:36] around you so that you have no
[15:37] confidence in the things that you
[15:39] believe and you're going to choose
[15:41] yourself or as an individual you've got
[15:44] to choose what you're going to believe
[15:46] and what you're going to hold firm to
[15:48] and i'll just read here in ephesians the
[15:50] fifth chapter
[15:55] uh some scriptures here
[15:57] this is what paul had the syrian he says
[15:59] be you there follow followers of god as
[16:01] dear children it goes back to that psalm
[16:03] we read you know that light that's in
[16:06] you as an individual is the life that
[16:08] god showed for you and he goes on be
[16:11] there followers of god as dear children
[16:13] and walk in the love as christ also had
[16:15] loved us and had given himself
[16:18] as an offering and a sacrifice to god
[16:21] for a sweet-smelling savior so we have
[16:24] this is paul's teaching the people here
[16:26] are the examples that are laid out
[16:28] before him and i'm what i'm saying is
[16:30] everything around us in the world today
[16:33] is trying to tear these foundations away
[16:35] from you and he goes on
[16:37] sweets but fornication and uncleanness
[16:40] covenantness let it not once be named
[16:42] among you has become the saints
[16:45] neither filthiness or foolishness
[16:47] talking or jesting which is not
[16:49] convenient but rather giving thanks for
[16:52] this you know the no whoremonger nor
[16:54] unclean person
[16:56] nor covetous man who is an idolater or
[16:58] have any inheritance in the kingdom of
[17:00] christ and of god
[17:02] you know i think i look at these
[17:04] scriptures and
[17:05] when you look at the church world you
[17:07] know you desire for everyone to be saved
[17:10] you desire mercy for everyone but if
[17:12] they don't have good strong teaching and
[17:14] good strong examples they're not going
[17:16] to be able to stand and he goes on to
[17:18] say here let no man deceive you with
[17:21] vain words because of these things which
[17:23] cometh the wrath of god upon the
[17:25] children of disobedience
[17:27] and be you not therefore partakers with
[17:30] them
[17:30] and that's really important in the age
[17:32] that we live in finding yourself not
[17:34] partaking in the same things that
[17:36] they're doing and be you there for some
[17:39] for you that were sometimes
[17:42] sometimes darkness but now you are the
[17:44] light in the world
[17:45] walk as children of the light
[17:47] and for the fruit of the spirit is in
[17:49] all goodness and righteousness and truth
[17:52] proving what is acceptable unto the lord
[17:55] and have no fellowship with on
[17:58] fruitful
[18:00] works of darkness you know sometimes do
[18:03] i get off on a tangent you know in a day
[18:06] at work or when i'm home not doing
[18:08] anything do i just do i find myself not
[18:11] being fruitful
[18:13] in the things that maybe god wants me to
[18:15] do or am i spending too much time
[18:17] doing things that really god aren't
[18:19] fruitful that things that god doesn't
[18:21] want me to do
[18:22] and then he
[18:23] goes on to say
[18:26] i lost my place proving what is
[18:28] acceptable on the lord and have no
[18:29] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[18:31] darkness but rather reprove them i know
[18:33] i read a lot but when i'm reading is not
[18:36] what my opinion is it's what god's word
[18:38] has to say i know i say that a lot but i
[18:41] can't say it enough
[18:42] you know i'm just a man but god's word
[18:44] is the truth and you know
[18:46] if we can't take what we're doing and
[18:48] put it bring it through the word of god
[18:50] and come out on the other side still
[18:52] doing it then there's something wrong
[18:54] with it and it then says here for it is
[18:57] a shame even to speak those things which
[18:59] are done and of them in secret when i
[19:02] think of it i'm not trying to be funny
[19:04] but with everything that you possess
[19:06] nowadays it's not done in secret anymore
[19:09] it's just out there in the open the sin
[19:11] that's out there in the open right now
[19:13] whether it's on the airwaves or on your
[19:15] phone or whatever it's just unbelievable
[19:18] things that we would that we know today
[19:21] still
[19:22] are wrong and people shouldn't be doing
[19:24] these things
[19:26] are a common thing among the people we
[19:28] live within the day that we live right
[19:30] now and to say something about it
[19:32] you're the mean person
[19:36] or you're the reactionary nowadays
[19:38] that's how bad it's got to say the
[19:40] proper thing the loving thing and the
[19:42] thing that's right would make you an
[19:44] enemy of most people and he goes on to
[19:46] say
[19:47] for it is a shame even to speak those
[19:49] things which have done of them in secret
[19:51] but all things that are reproved or made
[19:53] manifest by the light and whatsoever
[19:55] doeth make manifest that goes back to
[19:57] that song you know that light that god
[20:00] god gives us
[20:01] you know no one's getting out of here
[20:02] without that light being in your heart
[20:04] and life wherefore he saith awake thou
[20:07] this sleepless and that really speaks to
[20:09] the age that we're living people have
[20:11] just fallen asleep in their sins in
[20:13] their own belief
[20:14] or in their complacency
[20:17] and arise from the dead and christ shall
[20:19] give thee lies seeing now that we walk
[20:20] circumcised me not as fools but as the
[20:23] wise redeeming the time because they are
[20:26] the these are the because the days are
[20:28] evil wherefore be not unwise but
[20:30] understanding
[20:32] on the will of the lord is and i i mean
[20:35] i'm i'm not going to read keep reading i
[20:36] don't want
[20:37] but as i was thinking this i was reading
[20:39] that the one of the devotionals one of
[20:42] the other devotionals i had
[20:44] and it goes
[20:46] world war two one and it was talking
[20:49] about examples and it was talking about
[20:51] this man that his mother was a great
[20:54] example this guy wrote this paragraph
[20:56] about
[20:56] this one soldier whose mother was a
[20:58] great example
[21:01] that when he left to go to war
[21:03] the things that the other men were doing
[21:05] he couldn't do because of his the honor
[21:08] of his mother he wasn't able to do it
[21:10] and i was just thinking you know that's
[21:12] the same for us those examples that you
[21:15] had as young men or as young women
[21:18] you know that there's more than that
[21:20] that'll hold you but the examples if you
[21:23] walk over all the barriers that god has
[21:26] been put in front of you in your life
[21:28] you're going to find out on the other
[21:30] side of that wall it might not be the
[21:32] place that you want to be and i was just
[21:34] thinking we have examples in the day
[21:36] that we live in right now you have the
[21:38] message of the hour
[21:40] you
[21:41] i mean you have it on
[21:43] you have a video you have it on tape you
[21:45] have any way you want it you can have it
[21:47] this morning and we find ourselves
[21:50] getting further away from the truth i
[21:52] can't i'm just speaking in generalities
[21:54] i'm not looking at you as individuals
[21:56] but you find the world just getting
[21:58] further and further and further away
[22:00] from the true gospel and it just lets
[22:02] you know the lateness that we're living
[22:04] this morning but there is a hope i
[22:06] always say
[22:07] if you're in christ this morning then
[22:09] none of these things will ever affect
[22:11] you on that day brother david
[22:16] amen
[22:18] if we could

[46:05] you know brother tommy you sent me that
[46:06] video about why does the devil fight you
[46:09] so much when you pray

[46:12] everything in the world from buying a
[46:14] car to
[46:16] stuff that didn't matter
[46:18] and i
[46:19] i began to laugh i said
[46:21] yo devil
[46:22] we ain't much but your prophet said when
[46:25] the weakest of us gets down to pray
[46:28] you're scared
[46:30] and you're scared this morning
[46:32] because i'm praying for god's people
[46:35] and we believe
[46:36] that all is well
[46:38] and you know i got thinking about that i
[46:40] thought
[46:42] why should i worry it's in his hands
[46:45] as long as i keep praying and pressing
[46:47] on what the prophet tell us read your
[46:50] bible pray every day
[46:52] pretty simple
[46:53] what's the hardest two things you ever
[46:55] do in your life

[46:58] it's praying and reading my bible
[47:01] i could i could watch a western that was
[47:03] 20 hours long and never get sleepy
[47:06] but i guarantee you if i go to listen to
[47:08] the word of god or read five pages
[47:10] my eyes
[47:12] they want to close
[47:14] because he's not happy
[47:15] with something that'll give us strength
[47:18] and encourage us and give us power to
[47:20] keep pressing on

[47:24] but tomato tomorrow they're going to
[47:26] lose but if that word of god anchors in
[47:28] your heart it don't matter what comes or

[51:24] romans
[51:37] romans 8
[51:44] verse 28 for we know that all things
[51:46] work together for good to them that love
[51:49] god to them who are the called according
[51:52] to his purpose
[51:53] for whom he did for know them he also
[51:55] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[51:57] image of his son that he might be the
[51:59] firstborn among many brethren
[52:01] moreover
[52:02] whom he did predestinate them he also
[52:05] called and whom he called and he also
[52:07] justified and whom he justified
[52:09] demi also glorified me god had his
[52:12] blessings to reading the word you can be
[52:13] seated this morning
[52:16] amen i thought about this and i want to
[52:19] speak on
[52:20] uh
[52:22] speak on the gospel according to paul
[52:25] amen
[52:26] i know that it said in each one of the
[52:28] mark luke john
[52:31] matthew mark look in john those gospels
[52:33] all said the gospel according to
[52:35] uh you know those brothers there but i
[52:37] don't know that the bible ever said
[52:39] anything about the gospel according to
[52:41] paul but we know that paul did have a
[52:44] version of the gospel didn't he amen i
[52:46] believe in galatians he says a
[52:49] dispensation of the gospel was it was
[52:51] administered to him to bring to the
[52:53] gentiles amen and so forth
[52:55] amen another place i believe he talked
[52:59] and said about the gospel and in the
[53:01] ministering of the word
[53:03] you know he said but though we or an
[53:05] angel from heaven preach any other
[53:07] gospel than that which we have preached
[53:09] unto you let him be accursed
[53:11] and as we said before so i say now again
[53:13] if any man preach any other gospel unto
[53:16] you other than that which we have
[53:17] received let him be a curse so we know
[53:20] that paul got the gospel and whatever
[53:23] paul taught is what we believe amen
[53:26] we remember and think about uh
[53:28] uh brother bam going beyond the curtain
[53:30] of time and and how that the angel said
[53:32] that he'd have to be judged you know uh
[53:35] for what he taught for what he preached
[53:37] and so he asked if paul would have to be
[53:39] to do the same
[53:40] amen and the angel said yes and brother
[53:44] branham kind of shouted he was kind of
[53:45] like happy he says well then praise be
[53:47] to god
[53:48] you know if his goes in he says mine
[53:49] will too because i thought just what he
[53:51] did amen
[53:53] so praise the lord this morning amen
[53:55] aren't you glad to have a gospel today
[53:59] man i want to talk about in the
[54:00] basically of my my
[54:02] my i titled it
[54:04] more than conquers but i want to talk
[54:06] about staying
[54:07] positive staying positive
[54:10] amen
[54:12] amen more than conquers
[54:15] but staying positive we're living the
[54:16] world brothers and sister that
[54:18] everything about the world the outside
[54:20] world the world that we see
[54:23] everything about it is negative
[54:27] not one negative thing i mean not one
[54:29] positive thing about it i mean i say
[54:32] that based on what the prophet said the
[54:34] bible talks about heaven and earth shall
[54:36] pass away with a great noise and so
[54:38] forth so and the prophet saying i think
[54:40] wednesday i read it where he says
[54:41] there's not even a hope
[54:43] amen to make it in this world
[54:45] amen
[54:46] i mean knows that even as in these
[54:48] bodies naturally speaking
[54:50] you are not promised survival
[54:53] you are not going to survive this
[54:56] amen now i understand i'm talking about
[54:58] carnally amen we know there's only one
[55:00] escape that's through the rapture in
[55:02] that right only one way that you're not
[55:04] going to die and that is through the
[55:07] rapture if the rapture takes place if
[55:09] god has for ordained you to be in that
[55:11] rapture you're going to escape death but
[55:13] that's the only ones other than that
[55:15] amen we're so to speak we're going to
[55:17] die i mean everybody's going to die
[55:19] amen and so
[55:21] you look you look at first of all you
[55:23] look uh
[55:24] on a national scale you know
[55:27] talking about the nations and so forth
[55:29] uh actually talk about the whole world
[55:31] we know that the whole world
[55:33] amen is also going to die
[55:36] amen
[55:38] it's going to pass the way the bible
[55:39] says
[55:40] amen
[55:42] heavens and earth are going to die
[55:44] you know and and and
[55:46] brother branham taught us that that
[55:48] passed away where amen comes you know
[55:50] from the word of dying and death so
[55:52] forth it's passing from one form to
[55:54] another we passed away while he passed
[55:56] away she passed away while the world is
[55:58] promised that it's going to pass away
[56:01] amen so there's no hope there there's
[56:03] nothing positive about it at all
[56:05] amen and then we find there's other
[56:08] things that's many many things and uh
[56:10] that's not positive we know that this
[56:12] flesh this flesh that we live in the
[56:14] brotherhood said this is the the what
[56:17] the negative
[56:19] is that right
[56:20] your body is the negative of you
[56:23] the real use inside but this is just a
[56:25] negative and he said it has to go
[56:27] through the dark room to get developed
[56:30] so to speak
[56:32] amen has to get developed in the door of
[56:34] death he may go by the way the grave and
[56:35] so forth it has a good developments that
[56:37] way amen and then we come forth as a new
[56:40] man amen the world the same way it has
[56:43] to die it has to get developed
[56:48] and we're looking forward to that
[56:49] development aren't we amen amen but the
[56:52] process in which you are going through
[56:54] and and of course it's never pleasant
[56:56] never any good things so to speak amen
[56:59] because we know that the whole world is
[57:01] dying
[57:02] amen
[57:03] the whole world is dying amen you and i
[57:06] are dying and death is never a pleasant
[57:08] thing amen
[57:10] and so
[57:11] uh but you know
[57:12] i'm so glad tonight this this morning
[57:15] that there is hope amen
[57:18] and i appreciate it sunday school class
[57:20] brother brian gave about you know about
[57:22] room removing them landmarks and so
[57:24] forth and how that and now people
[57:26] previously maybe talk touching on
[57:28] what and they're talking about removing
[57:31] the landmarks and removing those places
[57:32] they want to take abraham lincoln sat
[57:34] you down in that right destroying the
[57:36] statues and saying bad things about him
[57:38] and so forth it destroys the very fabric
[57:40] amen and seeing people fall
[57:43] event he makes a statement something
[57:45] about seeing people fall amen amen tears
[57:48] at the very core of fabric and i thought
[57:51] that's the way it is with us as parents
[57:53] when uh parents preachers churches or
[57:55] anybody when somebody falls i mean it
[57:57] tears at the fact it shall shake your
[57:59] foundation you're like wow if they could
[58:01] fall then what really is solid
[58:04] amen
[58:06] amen
[58:08] so the atmosphere that we're living in
[58:10] is a negative atmosphere
[58:13] amen it's a negative atmosphere amen we
[58:15] know that money and all of those things
[58:18] will pass away one of these days
[58:20] and
[58:21] the atmosphere is that of that which is
[58:24] to perish
[58:25] but you know
[58:26] the bible says that when we gather
[58:28] together and so forth we gather in
[58:29] heavenly places in christ jesus
[58:32] when you come to church it's the one
[58:34] place that's positive the one place
[58:36] that's not negative amen the only hope
[58:39] that we have is in christ jesus there's
[58:42] not a hope for anybody or anything
[58:44] outside of jesus christ in his return
[58:47] no
[58:49] amen so we know that when you say no
[58:50] hope that's a lot of negative
[58:53] amen that's totally negative think
[58:55] there's no hope
[58:56] but it's positive
[58:58] because you have that word in there
[59:00] except
[59:01] i like that word except except for
[59:04] jesus christ
[59:08] there is hope
[59:10] very negative because i believe that
[59:13] most of the people out there
[59:16] almost all of the people out there most
[59:17] of the people out there
[59:19] they do not have comfort
[59:22] they're in misery
[59:24] that right
[59:25] they're in there they're they're
[59:27] stressed people are stressed are living
[59:29] under stress and living in that way is
[59:31] not positive it's not good at all
[59:35] amen
[59:37] so we want to talk about being positive
[59:39] and i'm thankful that god has made for
[59:41] us to be able to be positive
[59:44] amen let me first of first start with
[59:45] this well let's talk about
[59:47] uh people who has gone before us amen
[59:50] people that's gone before us i mean it
[59:52] reminded me about the brian sunday
[59:54] school class of how that it was told to
[59:56] take stones along so the next generation
[59:58] could look at that it's kind of like
[1:00:00] footprints on the sands of time
[1:00:02] look this is what god did gives you
[1:00:04] faith isn't that right this is what's
[1:00:06] solid this is what's sure is
[1:00:08] this is your absolute you know
[1:00:11] amen and they went on and i want to say
[1:00:13] that there's many uh uh you know
[1:00:16] many people many of men that have
[1:00:18] suffered and went through very hard
[1:00:20] times
[1:00:21] so that you could have a good time
[1:00:23] so that you can have it better
[1:00:26] isn't that right amen better bannon says
[1:00:28] it this way he says you know and many of
[1:00:31] you old timers here tonight was back
[1:00:32] yonder preaching you old baptist and
[1:00:34] methodists and pentecostal nazarene you
[1:00:37] were back yonder preaching when i was a
[1:00:38] little boy i respect you my brother
[1:00:41] you've made the way you hewed out the
[1:00:43] stumps and things
[1:00:45] all right
[1:00:46] so that when things come along they
[1:00:48] could run clear i respect you and so
[1:00:51] does god if there's any credit to be
[1:00:52] given at that day i want to stand to see
[1:00:55] you get it god bless
[1:00:58] then again he says help us lord now
[1:01:00] remember help us lord as we're working
[1:01:02] the row
[1:01:03] cutting down the briars moving back the
[1:01:07] rocks
[1:01:08] amen pulling out the stumps
[1:01:12] the front line give us courage lord big
[1:01:15] strong hearts buckle up the armor give
[1:01:18] us great strength and the power of thy
[1:01:19] spirit
[1:01:20] amen
[1:01:21] so he talked about different ones the
[1:01:24] preachers that's going on before when i
[1:01:26] want to look at paul i want to look at
[1:01:27] paul and some of his life and his
[1:01:29] attitude and and the way that paul
[1:01:31] looked at things amen
[1:01:33] but first of all talking about just
[1:01:36] different ones that went on and and cut
[1:01:38] all these things down we know that even
[1:01:39] the prophet of god had great adversity
[1:01:42] right he had great adversity people
[1:01:45] would
[1:01:46] women and
[1:01:49] say they don't believe things and so
[1:01:50] forth and he says well right here's the
[1:01:52] evidence that proves otherwise they
[1:01:54] couldn't say anything about it
[1:01:56] and we know brother branham greatly
[1:01:57] preached on the the goliath and so forth
[1:02:00] the goliath that was called the days of
[1:02:02] miracles his past you know and
[1:02:06] and so
[1:02:07] so forth oddity
[1:02:09] ain't no telling what they would have
[1:02:11] gotten away with teaching if it wouldn't
[1:02:13] have been for god sending uh they shall
[1:02:15] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:02:17] recover and all the miracles that did
[1:02:18] happen they could then probably
[1:02:21] instill that in all the world but yeah
[1:02:23] the days of miracles his path yeah
[1:02:25] there's no such a thing as the holy
[1:02:26] ghost
[1:02:28] but he went through great suffering how
[1:02:29] many was the prophet suffered a lot
[1:02:32] he suffered a lot he says you'll never
[1:02:34] know you
[1:02:35] you'll never know the scours that's on
[1:02:38] this heart
[1:02:41] he's got cut deep he said many times
[1:02:45] he went through some hard places so that
[1:02:48] you could have confidence where you
[1:02:50] stand
[1:02:52] amen
[1:02:54] and amen and i appreciate that about
[1:02:56] people that's done that paul did that i
[1:02:58] mean know that paul suffered greatly he
[1:03:02] suffered amen and cutting these buyers
[1:03:04] back and removing these stumps and he
[1:03:06] had to straighten out all circumcision
[1:03:08] they had
[1:03:09] a minute to spring things and made the
[1:03:11] road clear paul made the road clear
[1:03:14] didn't he so that you could understand
[1:03:17] hey this is the right road
[1:03:18] and anybody that tries to show you any
[1:03:21] other path remember that it's the wrong
[1:03:23] path this is the right path
[1:03:27] boy what would you do if you went by
[1:03:29] what our
[1:03:30] our liberals and the people are saying
[1:03:32] nowadays
[1:03:35] if you believe what they would say you
[1:03:37] wouldn't know for sure if you're a man
[1:03:38] or a woman even
[1:03:41] why don't they come up with next they
[1:03:43] got they got you know
[1:03:46] can you imagine that i don't want to
[1:03:48] bring this up again can you imagine your
[1:03:49] children saying what what bathroom is
[1:03:51] that but what does that mean mom
[1:03:54] you know
[1:03:56] confusion if what's next you know and
[1:03:58] all of that but man aren't you glad you
[1:03:59] don't have to listen to that you'd be in
[1:04:01] a heap of trouble but here we have
[1:04:03] something that's so solid for sure
[1:04:07] amen so solid and so sure and men that
[1:04:09] have gone on to make a way
[1:04:12] and now how many knows that chief one of
[1:04:15] all
[1:04:16] amen that has made the way was jesus
[1:04:18] christ
[1:04:19] he's the chief one sure others did sure
[1:04:22] moses god used moses back in the old
[1:04:24] testament amen to take the big stump of
[1:04:27] pharaoh out of the way so that the
[1:04:29] people of god could be free
[1:04:33] when they went rejoicing out of egypt
[1:04:35] and so forth that was because
[1:04:37] moses had to endure a lot of things god
[1:04:39] took him on the backside of the desert
[1:04:41] and let him sit there for 40 years to
[1:04:43] get his mind right
[1:04:45] then called him to go down there and he
[1:04:47] went out there and he stumped he cleared
[1:04:49] all of that out
[1:04:51] he meant so that they could have joy
[1:04:53] jesus the same way think about what he
[1:04:55] did he didn't just do one but he
[1:04:57] conquered every enemy every devil he
[1:04:59] conquered
[1:05:01] didn't he
[1:05:03] he made it clear all the way i believe
[1:05:05] paul said we are more than conquerors
[1:05:07] through him that loved us
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:18] one place he says you know talking about
[1:05:22] he says oh death where is i sting o
[1:05:24] grave where is thy victory the sting of
[1:05:27] death is sin and the strength of sin is
[1:05:28] the law but be the god which gives us
[1:05:32] the victory through jesus christ our
[1:05:34] lord i mean you didn't have to go you
[1:05:38] didn't have to go to the cross you
[1:05:39] didn't have to get nailed to the cross
[1:05:40] because that's what we deserve to die
[1:05:43] he went and took your punishment for you
[1:05:46] he took that stump of guilt he took the
[1:05:48] gut the sump of your sin away he removed
[1:05:52] that
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:54] and all you have to do is accept it you
[1:05:56] have to believe it just believe it
[1:05:59] why because he went and he cleared the
[1:06:02] path think about all the different
[1:06:03] things and now no matter what you face
[1:06:06] in life it doesn't matter what it is
[1:06:09] it's already been conquered
[1:06:12] it's already been whooped
[1:06:14] all you have to accept is the victory
[1:06:17] lord just give me the victory that's all
[1:06:18] i need is the victory
[1:06:21] you already purchased it for me
[1:06:23] and that comes by surrendering to god
[1:06:25] and believing god's word
[1:06:27] that's how you get the victory is by
[1:06:29] believing god's word
[1:06:32] amen god oh thank you jesus for all the
[1:06:36] things
[1:06:37] let me say this just while i'm on it and
[1:06:39] thinking about it but you know there is
[1:06:41] still a lot of stumps for us to remove
[1:06:43] isn't there
[1:06:44] there is still a path for us to clear
[1:06:48] huh
[1:06:51] in these ages that we're living with all
[1:06:53] that they have claimed all that they
[1:06:55] have done for us in the past that they
[1:06:56] have made for us
[1:06:58] but this still we faiths face laodicea
[1:07:01] we face lukewarmness we face the media
[1:07:05] we face all those things that the devil
[1:07:07] is throwing at us
[1:07:09] and now it's up to us
[1:07:12] it's not up to us amen to clear the path
[1:07:15] and to show those that are coming behind
[1:07:17] us look this is how you do this is how
[1:07:20] you overcome this
[1:07:23] let me tell you this if parents are
[1:07:26] overcome by evil what stan what chance
[1:07:29] do your children stand
[1:07:32] the fabric of that family is completely
[1:07:35] torn apart whenever the parents don't
[1:07:37] stand when they don't show the way
[1:07:42] huh
[1:07:43] when they don't clear out the stuff and
[1:07:44] say this is the path we take and it may
[1:07:47] be rough it may be hard the things that
[1:07:48] you go through the trials that you
[1:07:51] endure the things that you go through
[1:07:53] and you come out the other side in
[1:07:54] victorious it's important that you come
[1:07:56] out victorious so those following and
[1:07:59] looking at you can come out victorious
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:04] we've got stumps to clear
[1:08:06] we've got giants to bring down
[1:08:09] we've got goliaths to kill
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:15] the goliath of lukewarmness
[1:08:20] the goliath of a halfway christian life
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:25] a lot of things that we have to do
[1:08:27] amen
[1:08:30] one more quote
[1:08:31] let's not notice
[1:08:34] lord now we
[1:08:36] lord god here's christian people here's
[1:08:39] people who have literally would
[1:08:41] literally lay down their life freely
[1:08:43] tonight for you they love you
[1:08:45] they've come through great toils
[1:08:48] troubles and tribulations
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:53] praise be to god you know the great
[1:08:55] thing about heaven is there's not going
[1:08:57] to be any troubles there's not going to
[1:08:58] be any trials there's not going to be
[1:09:00] any tribulations
[1:09:02] there's not going to be anything
[1:09:04] negative
[1:09:06] everything's going to be positive
[1:09:09] all right and they've tried through
[1:09:11] years they've contended for the faith
[1:09:13] that was once delivered to the saint
[1:09:15] they believed that they lived to see
[1:09:17] that day coming
[1:09:20] many of their fathers and mothers have
[1:09:22] fallen asleep waiting for this day but
[1:09:24] father they've blazed the road they've
[1:09:26] taken the stumps they've pulled back the
[1:09:28] briars now their children are running
[1:09:31] happily down the highway
[1:09:34] enjoying these blessings
[1:09:38] amen how many is enjoying the blessings
[1:09:41] oh my how we could just take our
[1:09:43] projector and just go all down through
[1:09:46] all the blessings that they brought to
[1:09:49] us
[1:09:50] amen
[1:09:52] you know luther he didn't have a whole
[1:09:54] lot
[1:09:56] he didn't have a whole lot but the
[1:09:58] catholic church was trying to make them
[1:10:00] pay for every blessing they get from god
[1:10:04] it was a time that they were trying to
[1:10:05] pay for it and you had to do this and
[1:10:07] you had to do that or you weren't going
[1:10:09] to make it to heaven
[1:10:12] and luther caught the revelation the
[1:10:14] just shall live by faith in other words
[1:10:16] you are just if you live by faith in the
[1:10:19] word of god that's all he has asked for
[1:10:21] you can't ask that of me
[1:10:24] you can't tell me i have to pay for this
[1:10:25] not in the other it's already been paid
[1:10:27] for and the judge shall oh they didn't
[1:10:29] like it
[1:10:30] huh but he began to open up the way up
[1:10:33] and up the way and that's what he had
[1:10:35] and then the next comes wesley come
[1:10:37] along and he says you know you can't
[1:10:38] just be justified by
[1:10:40] but you've got to have you got to lay
[1:10:42] that cigarette down you got to get clean
[1:10:44] you got to have sanctification you got
[1:10:46] to be right and clean without holiness
[1:10:49] no man shall see god
[1:10:52] amen and another move come on out isn't
[1:10:54] that right and then pentecost come on
[1:10:56] pave the way boy they really got happy
[1:10:59] after a while didn't they
[1:11:01] amen sanctification justification sure
[1:11:04] we have both of those but now they have
[1:11:06] the gifts of the holy spirit speaking in
[1:11:08] tongues and the baptism the spirit
[1:11:10] coming back upon them isn't that right
[1:11:13] my they had a good time
[1:11:16] but they had to fight their way didn't
[1:11:18] they all those souls just had to fight
[1:11:20] their way they had to be persecuted they
[1:11:22] had to be mocked they had to be called
[1:11:24] the offscouring
[1:11:26] holy rollers fanatics
[1:11:28] fools
[1:11:31] amen
[1:11:33] i was looking somewhere about billy
[1:11:35] graham and he reached a
[1:11:37] message i believe he says be a fool for
[1:11:39] christ
[1:11:40] he even got the revelation amen
[1:11:43] but you know the thing of it is you're
[1:11:44] just a fool to those
[1:11:46] who think you're foolish
[1:11:48] but you're actually a wise guy
[1:11:52] you're the wisest there is
[1:11:54] you're actually
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:58] but just to them because they're on
[1:12:00] opposite sides they think you're a fool
[1:12:02] but that's okay
[1:12:04] amen we think about it pentecost come
[1:12:06] along it paved the way
[1:12:09] speaking in tongues
[1:12:11] now i want you to ask you the main theme
[1:12:13] that they have of course is stress
[1:12:16] very much and we do too acts 2 the
[1:12:18] baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:12:19] pentecostal experience of the baptism of
[1:12:22] the holy ghost you know that you gotta
[1:12:23] have and then they kind of went on you
[1:12:25] know that was wonderful that was correct
[1:12:27] but the devil tried to push him over
[1:12:29] aboard a little bit
[1:12:30] and they had speaking in tongues if you
[1:12:32] don't speak in tongues you ain't got it
[1:12:34] and if you speak in tongues that means
[1:12:35] you got it that's their that's where
[1:12:38] they got a little bit the devil just
[1:12:39] pushed them off a little bit
[1:12:40] i don't know about you but i'm glad that
[1:12:42] i have a whole lot more than just to
[1:12:44] think that because i speak in tongues
[1:12:46] i've got no legal i got a whole lot more
[1:12:49] realize the bible jesus said that by
[1:12:51] their fruit you shall know them the way
[1:12:53] that you live and your passion and your
[1:12:55] desire that's how you know whether you
[1:12:57] got it or not
[1:12:58] by their fruits you're going to know
[1:13:00] them
[1:13:01] amen come along and amen to think about
[1:13:04] all that was opened up to us on this
[1:13:06] road of of how that he went back before
[1:13:09] the foundation of the world and how that
[1:13:11] god had you in his mind he knew your
[1:13:13] name and he actually wrote your name
[1:13:14] down
[1:13:16] amen what redemption man we didn't
[1:13:18] really know what redemption man it's
[1:13:19] mean to bring back which what was long
[1:13:22] if he was never lost you can't never be
[1:13:24] brought back only those who were lost he
[1:13:26] brings back
[1:13:28] praise the lord we found the uh found
[1:13:30] what it would really like to be
[1:13:32] justified we found that justified means
[1:13:34] that you've never done it in the first
[1:13:36] place
[1:13:37] you were trapped in it i heard brother
[1:13:39] brown saying it was kind of a real kind
[1:13:40] of tricky but he says god will never
[1:13:43] condemn you for being a sinner
[1:13:46] he will never dab for being a sinner
[1:13:49] he was born that way you can't help it
[1:13:51] he was born that way
[1:13:54] but he says what he'll condemn you for
[1:13:56] is not taking the way out
[1:14:01] huh
[1:14:02] for not accepting the way out we're not
[1:14:04] accepting forgiveness for sins
[1:14:07] huh that's the condemnation
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:13] people love darkness than life
[1:14:16] amen
[1:14:17] praise the lord my
[1:14:20] they've contented for the faith many
[1:14:22] have fallen asleep waiting for what
[1:14:23] waiting for the coming of the lord
[1:14:25] that's our hope isn't it praise the lord
[1:14:28] now let's think about this let's talk
[1:14:31] about
[1:14:32] in the world that we're living in and
[1:14:34] let me just say this before we read this
[1:14:36] also and as we get older as you get
[1:14:38] older amen
[1:14:41] it's much easier to become negative
[1:14:45] and let me say this also
[1:14:47] you have a whole lot more to be negative
[1:14:50] about
[1:14:56] huh
[1:14:56] oh my knee hurts arm hurts i'm not as
[1:15:00] strong i'm feeble i'm weak huh
[1:15:03] all kinds of things that you have to be
[1:15:06] negative about
[1:15:07] amen
[1:15:08] because as i was
[1:15:10] thinking back in the offices after all
[1:15:12] dying isn't fun
[1:15:15] dying isn't easy
[1:15:18] it's a slow long process and it starts
[1:15:21] with your hair turning great
[1:15:24] it starts with turning 40.
[1:15:29] you're over the hill
[1:15:31] yep
[1:15:32] over the hill praise be to god i wish i
[1:15:35] was 40.
[1:15:38] but it starts going downhill he goes
[1:15:39] worse worse worse more and more things
[1:15:42] to be negative about
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:49] negative
[1:15:50] think about the things around us the
[1:15:51] economy look at the economy how
[1:15:53] depressing it is
[1:15:56] how perplexing how distressing it is
[1:15:59] to have to live in this world amen
[1:16:01] of negativity
[1:16:04] but you know that's why i believe
[1:16:06] probably god said lord help me never let
[1:16:08] the devil
[1:16:09] crown my life at being a crabby old
[1:16:12] fussy old man
[1:16:14] because somebody knows when you are
[1:16:15] negative you become fuzzy
[1:16:19] fuss about this fuss about that you
[1:16:21] murmur about this remember about that
[1:16:24] easy to become this way
[1:16:27] amen
[1:16:29] and you need more of god
[1:16:33] and old people will usually be real
[1:16:34] sweet
[1:16:36] or real grumpy
[1:16:38] one way or the other because they'll
[1:16:40] have learned
[1:16:42] not to complain about it thank the lord
[1:16:44] anyway
[1:16:47] amen
[1:16:48] all right let me read the course quote
[1:16:50] that come to my mind
[1:16:52] brother makes a statement he says you
[1:16:53] know
[1:16:54] it's a strange thing
[1:16:57] that there's so much thought of the
[1:16:58] people people will think well i'm weak
[1:17:00] and my faith isn't very much
[1:17:03] i'm not a very good christian
[1:17:05] that's just what the devil wants you to
[1:17:07] say
[1:17:08] huh
[1:17:10] oh my knee hurts and it's not getting
[1:17:13] any better don't say that
[1:17:16] oh my back hurts and i don't think it's
[1:17:18] gonna no don't say that stay positive
[1:17:22] huh
[1:17:24] that's just what the devil wants you to
[1:17:26] say you're just talking his language
[1:17:28] right then you mustn't never say that he
[1:17:30] says don't never let your testimony be
[1:17:33] negative
[1:17:35] praise the lord
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:39] why do you think that
[1:17:41] looking at the news too much is
[1:17:43] depressing and it'll depress you
[1:17:46] because it's negative
[1:17:49] huh
[1:17:50] it's negative
[1:17:52] all right
[1:17:54] you must never say that let your neck
[1:17:56] never be let your testimony be negative
[1:17:59] let it be positive all the time
[1:18:02] praise be to god
[1:18:05] oh i may not be what i want to be but i
[1:18:07] know
[1:18:09] god's going to get me there that kind of
[1:18:12] language
[1:18:14] i only believe that's the way we got to
[1:18:16] be
[1:18:17] i mean it was paul was that way wasn't
[1:18:19] he
[1:18:20] paul he always he he would mention the
[1:18:22] negative
[1:18:23] he would talk about the negative
[1:18:26] but he'd always have the positive side
[1:18:29] there's nobody suffered more than paul
[1:18:31] did
[1:18:32] outside of christ
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:40] now notice he says let your testimony
[1:18:42] always in your thoughts
[1:18:44] every time he says always never permit a
[1:18:46] negative thought to come into your mind
[1:18:48] if you can help it when it starts don't
[1:18:50] entertain it he talked about the birds
[1:18:51] it fly over it i mean no every one of us
[1:18:55] gets us those negative thoughts
[1:18:58] and we all know that nobody wants to be
[1:19:00] around a negative person
[1:19:04] there's too much negative
[1:19:07] but there's too much positive for the
[1:19:08] christian
[1:19:10] to live on to have to be negative
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:17] always i like that always be positive
[1:19:19] because guess what
[1:19:21] even when we're at death's door
[1:19:24] even when we're dying
[1:19:27] we should be positive
[1:19:30] huh
[1:19:31] when i come to beth's door
[1:19:34] which i hope i won't
[1:19:36] i'm
[1:19:37] trusting in the rapture
[1:19:39] but if it is
[1:19:41] i want to be able to say
[1:19:43] boy oh boy guess what in just a little
[1:19:46] bit when i draw that last breath it's
[1:19:48] adios amigo i'm going to a place in a
[1:19:52] beautiful land
[1:19:54] not ever looking back amen
[1:19:58] oh my it's so there's things to be
[1:20:00] positive about
[1:20:02] as you get weaker as you get older as
[1:20:03] you get feebler stay positive
[1:20:07] because if you don't you're gonna find
[1:20:08] yourself fussing at your wife wife
[1:20:11] fussing at your husband murmuring and
[1:20:13] complaining that's what negativity is
[1:20:15] all about
[1:20:18] that's pretty good right
[1:20:20] we fuss at one another we fuss and we
[1:20:22] bicker and everything else
[1:20:25] when you get negative
[1:20:28] amen another place brother bam says he's
[1:20:30] just the holy spirit is never negative
[1:20:33] he's always positive i think i have a
[1:20:35] quote on one more quote on that a man
[1:20:37] that is in christ with the holy ghost
[1:20:39] can bear with a man when he's wrong he's
[1:20:42] long suffering he's gentle he's patient
[1:20:44] he's sweet he's humble
[1:20:49] should i stop for just a minute
[1:20:52] i go so fast
[1:20:54] he can bear with a man when he's wrong
[1:20:57] he's long suffering
[1:20:59] he's
[1:21:03] he's sweet
[1:21:06] he's humble
[1:21:08] he's faithful
[1:21:10] filled with the spirit
[1:21:13] never negative
[1:21:17] huh
[1:21:19] brother i tell you what i just don't
[1:21:21] know what i'm going to do anymore and
[1:21:24] i'm so discouraged well if you wouldn't
[1:21:26] be doing this that any other maybe you
[1:21:27] wouldn't be that way
[1:21:29] is that positive
[1:21:32] no
[1:21:33] brother you're gonna make it through
[1:21:34] this i'm praying for you i believe it
[1:21:36] you can do it
[1:21:37] huh
[1:21:38] i'm with you i got your back
[1:21:41] positive
[1:21:43] the holy ghost-filled person is always
[1:21:45] positive never
[1:21:46] negative he says always positive why
[1:21:50] because he's a different person
[1:21:53] let's look at paul you want to look at
[1:21:54] paul with me
[1:21:56] in second corinthians the fourth chapter
[1:22:06] and verse six
[1:22:08] he says for god who hath commanded the
[1:22:11] light to shine out of darkness
[1:22:13] has shined in our hearts
[1:22:16] to give the light of the knowledge of
[1:22:18] the glory of god in the face of jesus
[1:22:20] christ
[1:22:22] now he said that kind of a different
[1:22:24] subject but he's talking about the god
[1:22:26] of this world has blinded the minds of
[1:22:28] those that don't accept the gospel amen
[1:22:32] and no light can come here it's nothing
[1:22:34] but negative in there when light comes
[1:22:36] into your heart amen
[1:22:38] joy comes in your heart
[1:22:41] but we have verse seven but we have this
[1:22:43] earthen
[1:22:45] this treasure in earth and vessels that
[1:22:48] the excellency of the power may be of
[1:22:51] god
[1:22:52] and not of us
[1:22:54] praise be to god
[1:22:56] hallelujah
[1:22:57] how many in here and out there has
[1:22:59] learned that it's not about you living
[1:23:02] your life
[1:23:03] it's not about you taking care of the
[1:23:06] problem it's about god living in your
[1:23:08] life it's about god taking care of the
[1:23:10] problem that's the treasure the treasure
[1:23:13] is amen that the power is of god not of
[1:23:16] you
[1:23:20] will never be positive outside of the
[1:23:22] holy ghost you'll be negative in one way
[1:23:24] or the other
[1:23:27] now paul says one side on one side he
[1:23:29] says the very next word he says we are
[1:23:31] troubled on every side
[1:23:34] we got some trouble everywhere
[1:23:37] now what paul's saying we got trouble
[1:23:39] everywhere
[1:23:40] paul knew what it was like to have
[1:23:42] trouble all around him
[1:23:45] yet
[1:23:46] i like that i like his yet not
[1:23:49] distressed
[1:23:50] [Music]
[1:23:51] praise be to god
[1:23:54] we are perplexed
[1:23:57] amen
[1:23:58] how many know when you look at this
[1:24:00] world
[1:24:01] you see all of this it perplexes you
[1:24:04] it distresses you i'm distressed with it
[1:24:07] but
[1:24:08] we're not in despair
[1:24:11] hey we still got the joy of the lord
[1:24:13] because even though these things bother
[1:24:14] us you still got the hope you still got
[1:24:17] you don't despair
[1:24:20] we are persecuted
[1:24:22] praise be to god people might make fun
[1:24:25] of you despise you whatever but we're
[1:24:27] not
[1:24:28] forsaken no god didn't forsake us does
[1:24:31] he
[1:24:32] we are cast down
[1:24:36] made fun of
[1:24:37] the elf sky
[1:24:39] powering the earth
[1:24:41] but we're not destroyed you might get
[1:24:43] cast down but you're not destroyed
[1:24:47] amen
[1:24:48] the thought comes to my mind where jesus
[1:24:50] said they might destroy your body
[1:24:55] but don't fear them that can destroy
[1:24:56] your body fear him that can destroy both
[1:24:59] your body and your soul in hell
[1:25:03] amen
[1:25:04] because when they kill you there's
[1:25:05] nothing else they can do you're in the
[1:25:07] presence of almighty god
[1:25:10] yet not this destroyed always bearing
[1:25:15] out in the
[1:25:16] body of jesus might be made manifest in
[1:25:20] our body
[1:25:21] so god allows
[1:25:25] our trials he allows tribulation he
[1:25:27] allows persecutions he allows your name
[1:25:30] to be cast out as evil inaudible
[1:25:35] all so that the life of christ can be
[1:25:37] displayed
[1:25:38] he'll allow somebody to smack you on the
[1:25:41] right cheek by saying something bad
[1:25:43] about you and you can go back and say
[1:25:45] lord help me to say something good about
[1:25:47] that person
[1:25:49] huh
[1:25:54] for we which live are always delivered
[1:25:57] unto death for jesus sake
[1:25:59] wow
[1:26:02] that the life of
[1:26:03] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:26:07] made manifest in our
[1:26:09] mortal body
[1:26:11] amen
[1:26:13] another place
[1:26:14] paul talked about
[1:26:17] how to death you know they always had it
[1:26:19] nice and so forth and we were like the
[1:26:21] off-screen and so forth he was the four
[1:26:23] on it so the rest could have it a lot
[1:26:24] nicer so death workers than us but life
[1:26:27] in you we have the same spirit we having
[1:26:30] the same spirit of faith
[1:26:33] according as it is written i believe
[1:26:35] therefore
[1:26:36] have i spoken we also believe and
[1:26:38] therefore speak
[1:26:40] knowing that he which raised up jesus
[1:26:42] christ shall raise us up also by jesus
[1:26:44] christ and shall present us with you
[1:26:47] for all
[1:26:49] are for your sakes that the abundant
[1:26:52] grace might through the thanksgiving of
[1:26:54] many abound to the glory of god
[1:26:57] for which cause we faint not
[1:26:59] but though our outward man perish
[1:27:02] yet the inward man is renewed day by
[1:27:06] day
[1:27:07] all of us older folks can say amen to
[1:27:09] that
[1:27:11] the outward man perish hit the inman
[1:27:13] it's renewed
[1:27:15] day by day
[1:27:17] you get strength to go on
[1:27:19] keep pressing on amen
[1:27:21] for our light affliction which is but
[1:27:23] for a moment
[1:27:24] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:27:27] eternal weight of glory
[1:27:29] for we look not at the things which are
[1:27:32] seen but that the things which are not
[1:27:33] seen
[1:27:34] for the things which are seen are
[1:27:36] temporal but the things which are not
[1:27:37] seen are eternal
[1:27:40] praise the lord how many is looking to
[1:27:41] the unseen
[1:27:43] i'm looking to the unseen that is for
[1:27:46] sure
[1:27:49] back to romans 8 this was my
[1:27:52] chapter that came to me when i got to
[1:27:54] thinking on this and meditating on the
[1:27:56] lord
[1:28:04] let's go back to romans 8 and i want to
[1:28:06] read the rest of it the rest of that
[1:28:08] chapter
[1:28:08] i stopped i believe
[1:28:12] in verse 30. moreover who he did
[1:28:15] predestinate them he also called and
[1:28:17] whom he called them he also justified
[1:28:20] and whom he justified them he also
[1:28:22] glorified now remember paul talking here
[1:28:24] many different places and especially
[1:28:26] what we just read where he talked about
[1:28:28] being cast down and so forth but not
[1:28:30] forsaken and talking about the
[1:28:32] tribulation the different things that he
[1:28:33] goes
[1:28:34] through
[1:28:35] and another place he said i have
[1:28:37] suffered the loss of all things
[1:28:39] amen sure that was negative that he
[1:28:45] saw some positive thing and in all of it
[1:28:47] if everything that paul would tell you
[1:28:49] he says in verse 28 again that
[1:28:51] everything works together for good to
[1:28:52] them to love god i mean if paul
[1:28:54] continued always to have a positive
[1:28:57] attitude
[1:28:59] and look he says if he predestinated us
[1:29:02] and so forth then he also called us if
[1:29:04] he called us then he also justified us
[1:29:06] and if he justified us
[1:29:09] then he also has glorified us
[1:29:12] it took a profit of god to be able to uh
[1:29:16] to make that a
[1:29:19] present thing he noticed
[1:29:22] half already done it right
[1:29:26] he hath
[1:29:27] also just then he also justified
[1:29:29] glorified and that was saying that we
[1:29:31] already have a glorified body waiting
[1:29:34] for us how many beliefs be believers
[1:29:36] have a glorified body waiting on
[1:29:39] already right now
[1:29:40] if this earthly tabernacle of this house
[1:29:42] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:29:44] paul said
[1:29:46] amen
[1:29:48] paul was so positive he says oh death
[1:29:50] where is your sting oh great varies
[1:29:52] where's your victory you don't have any
[1:29:54] victory
[1:29:56] amen
[1:29:57] now what shall we say
[1:29:59] to thee things
[1:30:01] if god be for us who can be against us
[1:30:06] faith to god
[1:30:08] aren't you glad for that
[1:30:10] that no matter what if god is with you
[1:30:13] you don't have to be scared of anything
[1:30:16] who can be against you why are you
[1:30:19] worried about anybody or anything
[1:30:23] let me tell you something this helps
[1:30:24] when it comes to having fear
[1:30:28] if you have fear a lot of times fear
[1:30:29] will come upon us fear this no if god's
[1:30:33] with you
[1:30:35] you're taken care of god's going to take
[1:30:37] care of it
[1:30:39] he spared not his own son but delivered
[1:30:41] him up for us all how shall he not with
[1:30:44] him also freely give us
[1:30:46] all things and who shall slay anything
[1:30:49] to the charge of god's elect it is god
[1:30:52] that justifies
[1:30:54] amen
[1:30:57] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[1:30:59] that died
[1:31:01] yea rather that is risen again and is
[1:31:04] even at the right hand of god who also
[1:31:06] maketh intercessions for us
[1:31:09] how many believe that christ is there
[1:31:11] making intercessions for you
[1:31:14] now like this who shall separate us from
[1:31:17] the love of christ
[1:31:19] in other words what's going to make you
[1:31:20] negative
[1:31:23] what's going to make you turn you back
[1:31:24] on god
[1:31:26] what shall separate us from the love of
[1:31:28] christ shall tribulation
[1:31:31] huh
[1:31:33] shall lay odyssea
[1:31:36] or distress
[1:31:38] nope
[1:31:40] persecution
[1:31:42] a whole lot of negative going on there
[1:31:43] folks
[1:31:45] because there's all of these things
[1:31:46] comes to the believer
[1:31:48] all that live godly in christ jesus
[1:31:50] shall suffer persecution the bible says
[1:31:53] amen
[1:31:54] and all that comes to god shall be tried
[1:31:56] god will try out god will put you
[1:31:58] through things
[1:32:00] he'll allow tribulation to come upon you
[1:32:02] he'll allow distress didn't he paul paul
[1:32:04] was boy he was really
[1:32:07] um
[1:32:10] those of you who know the message well
[1:32:11] know that brother branham taught that
[1:32:14] most of the time the people that god
[1:32:16] uses the most go through the most
[1:32:18] suffering
[1:32:20] amen
[1:32:22] paul was such a man
[1:32:25] because he says i'll show you the things
[1:32:26] that you must
[1:32:27] suffer
[1:32:28] that's what he that's what jesus told
[1:32:30] him at the beginning i'm gonna show you
[1:32:32] some stuff that you're gonna you're
[1:32:33] gonna suffer bro
[1:32:35] you're gonna suffer
[1:32:38] amen
[1:32:40] oh my paul he could say distress shall
[1:32:43] persecution shall famine or nakedness
[1:32:46] or peril or sword
[1:32:48] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:32:50] killed all day long wow
[1:32:55] that sounds pretty bad to be killed all
[1:32:57] day long
[1:32:59] how many knows that that literally was
[1:33:02] true
[1:33:05] those those
[1:33:06] christians down through the dark ages 68
[1:33:08] they would slaughter them all day long
[1:33:11] they'd slaughter them
[1:33:12] day after day week after week month
[1:33:14] after they were counted as sheep to the
[1:33:16] slaughter
[1:33:19] sounds real bad don't it
[1:33:20] but yet in it all paul says we're more
[1:33:22] than conquerors
[1:33:24] we thank god for the victory that comes
[1:33:26] through the lord jesus christ
[1:33:30] folks
[1:33:32] i don't know i'm going to die i would
[1:33:34] rather die for the lord anyway wouldn't
[1:33:36] you
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] it's okay
[1:33:41] brother branham he says you know he's
[1:33:43] willing to take a bull of any time for
[1:33:44] the lord
[1:33:46] he said they had guns
[1:33:48] trained at him
[1:33:49] did he fear did he get negative did he
[1:33:52] get scared no
[1:33:56] let me tell you something
[1:33:58] when you touch the lord so when you're
[1:34:00] dealing with god's people
[1:34:03] you know
[1:34:04] you'll get your reward
[1:34:06] you'll get your reward whichever way you
[1:34:08] go with it
[1:34:09] all right
[1:34:11] okay so persecution
[1:34:13] famine
[1:34:14] how many knows paul knew what it was
[1:34:15] like to be hungry
[1:34:17] huh or distress
[1:34:19] perilous pearl or sword peril or sword
[1:34:22] killed all the lay long we're kind of
[1:34:23] the sheep for the slaughter
[1:34:26] [Laughter]
[1:34:30] now and a y
[1:34:33] i'm going to pronounce it that way nay
[1:34:35] or nah
[1:34:37] nah
[1:34:38] [Applause]
[1:34:39] he says in all these things we are
[1:34:43] say it with me more than conquers we are
[1:34:45] conquerors through him
[1:34:47] that
[1:34:48] loved us
[1:34:50] praise be to god let's thank the lord
[1:34:52] thank you jesus
[1:34:53] no matter what comes better what goes
[1:34:55] lord help us we are more than conquerors
[1:34:57] through him that loved us
[1:34:59] amen
[1:35:00] praise the lord
[1:35:02] because i am
[1:35:04] paul says for i am persuaded
[1:35:07] convinced i'm sure of
[1:35:11] that not death
[1:35:13] not life
[1:35:16] let me just stop there a little bit
[1:35:19] killing them isn't going to work
[1:35:21] letting them live isn't going to work
[1:35:22] because sometimes letting them live
[1:35:25] is more dangerous than killing them
[1:35:28] because you know even at the cares of
[1:35:30] life sometimes choke out the word
[1:35:34] so if you just go along people just go
[1:35:36] along living and living and living and
[1:35:38] living and they kind of drift away from
[1:35:40] god
[1:35:41] because it carries her life
[1:35:43] but even life isn't going to keep you
[1:35:45] away from him amen
[1:35:48] nor angels
[1:35:50] nor principalities
[1:35:52] principles
[1:35:57] amen and that's let me tell you some
[1:35:59] principles is like the you know what's
[1:36:01] going on right now they're making other
[1:36:03] principles and what we're uh the
[1:36:05] principles that this nation was founded
[1:36:07] upon they're changing the principles but
[1:36:09] it ain't going to separate us from the
[1:36:10] love of god is it
[1:36:12] nor powers
[1:36:14] nor are things present
[1:36:18] nor things to come boy
[1:36:20] brother paul was really inspired wasn't
[1:36:22] he
[1:36:23] he had the inspiration he covered it all
[1:36:25] life death
[1:36:27] sickness health press things present or
[1:36:29] things to come
[1:36:32] oh my
[1:36:33] praise the lord i want to claim that
[1:36:35] promise this morning
[1:36:37] the things that are to come yet
[1:36:41] huh
[1:36:42] we don't know what's going to come we
[1:36:43] don't know the future
[1:36:46] we don't know what
[1:36:48] how much of a squeeze we're going to be
[1:36:49] squeezed do we
[1:36:51] but paul thinks the things that are to
[1:36:53] come even that isn't going to separate
[1:36:55] us from the love of god
[1:36:57] praise god for faithful people
[1:37:00] praise god for
[1:37:02] rock steady people that are anchored in
[1:37:04] christ
[1:37:05] let me tell you something i believe
[1:37:07] there's only one kind that's really
[1:37:08] anchored that's the predestinated
[1:37:11] everything else these floods that are
[1:37:12] coming in is just washing people
[1:37:15] away
[1:37:17] amen
[1:37:19] that
[1:37:21] predeterminated seed in there is what's
[1:37:23] doing it for you amen
[1:37:25] praise the lord
[1:37:27] nor things to come
[1:37:29] not height
[1:37:31] night not depth
[1:37:33] nor any creature shall be able to
[1:37:37] separate us from the love of god which
[1:37:39] is in christ
[1:37:41] jesus
[1:37:42] thank you lord
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:45] it is you don't matter how hard no
[1:37:47] matter how negative

[1:38:49] always

[1:38:58] be known unto all men the lord is at
[1:39:01] hand

[1:39:05] by prayer and supplication with
[1:39:07] thanksgiving let your requests be made
[1:39:10] known unto god and the peace of god
[1:39:12] which passes all understanding
[1:39:15] it will keep
[1:39:16] your hearts
[1:39:18] and minds amen how many believes that
[1:39:21] the peace of god is to keep you hard
[1:39:26] and your mind how many beliefs those

[1:40:51] negative thought go through your mind
