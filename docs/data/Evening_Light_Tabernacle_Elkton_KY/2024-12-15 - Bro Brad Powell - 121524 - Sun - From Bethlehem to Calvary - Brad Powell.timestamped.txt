[1:21:04] eat
[1:21:05] lunch because uh the songs were so good
[1:21:08] and they tell the story and and they

[1:21:12] and on our heart and we want to speak to
[1:21:14] you this morning and and uh just take a
[1:21:17] little time we'll try not to hold you

[1:21:22] song there and I thought about that and
[1:21:24] and I just want to look up I thought no
[1:21:25] well what you know we we hear it we hear
[1:21:27] it we hear it but what is it and as I
[1:21:29] looked it up I found out that no well is
[1:21:32] used in language after language after
[1:21:34] language after
[1:21:36] language and every time it's used in a
[1:21:39] in a in a different language it has a
[1:21:40] little bit of a different con
[1:21:42] connotation about it but it all points
[1:21:44] back to the same thing Noel it says it
[1:21:48] can mean news the news has come it means
[1:21:51] Christmas it means birthday it it it it
[1:21:55] it it means uh uh the Christmas season
[1:21:58] so we you take no well and it looks back
[1:22:00] and you say man here we are the good
[1:22:01] news of Jesus Christ born a savior in a
[1:22:04] world in a sick and Dying World a savior
[1:22:06] who's come into our hearts and into our
[1:22:09] presence that's good
[1:22:11] news that's good news so we're just
[1:22:14] thankful for the for the word and for
[1:22:16] the songs that we're sang this morning
[1:22:17] if you want to turn in your Bibles we'll
[1:22:20] look in Luke chapter 1 and
[1:22:25] look in Luke chapter 1 and I'm going to
[1:22:28] continue my thought I think there's
[1:22:29] another Sunday before Christmas but I do
[1:22:32] just I'm just and maybe brother Bower is
[1:22:34] going to preach us a Christmas service
[1:22:36] I'm I I'm assuming maybe I think there's
[1:22:38] another CHR Another Sunday before
[1:22:40] Christmas right so but I want to
[1:22:43] continue my thoughts and stay with the
[1:22:44] theme that's going today and and I know
[1:22:47] we having our den Calvary and as you're
[1:22:49] turning there I know you got your place
[1:22:51] let me read you this quote it says it it
[1:22:53] all comes by the spirit
[1:22:55] but Jesus was virgin born in order to
[1:22:58] Tabernacle the holy spirit of God first
[1:23:02] to manifest himself to the people and he
[1:23:05] gave his life a willing sacrifice that
[1:23:09] through his righteousness we unrighteous
[1:23:12] people might have a right to come into
[1:23:15] that Fellowship like he had with the
[1:23:19] father before the foundation of the
[1:23:21] world he said isn't that Grace and Glory
[1:23:24] what he did for
[1:23:25] us then to think that that day that
[1:23:28] we're living in that so many people cut
[1:23:30] up cut that privilege off from the
[1:23:33] people he says my wow we're living
[1:23:35] millions of miles below our god-given
[1:23:38] privilege we should never live under our
[1:23:41] privileges as we are today great powers
[1:23:44] of God lays within the reach of every
[1:23:47] member of the body of Christ how many is
[1:23:50] a member of the body of Christ great
[1:23:52] Powers lay Within each and every one of
[1:23:55] you who claim to be a part of the body
[1:23:58] of Christ whatsoever things you desire

[1:27:29] brothers and sisters I tell you this one
[1:27:31] thing this morning there's one thing we

[1:27:45] we need in this Christmas season is
[1:27:47] Power from on high we need power from on
[1:27:50] high that conquers every enemy we need

[1:28:03] delivers those that are bound by the
[1:28:05] things of this world we need a freedom
[1:28:08] from fear and anxiety and depression
[1:28:11] that pulls our Spirits down into
[1:28:14] darkness this is a little bit different
[1:28:16] what you was expecting from a Christmas
[1:28:18] service wasn't
[1:28:20] it but what I want for Christmas this
[1:28:23] year is I want want more of Jesus

[1:29:35] fun and we enjoyed to do these things
[1:29:39] out of the light-heartedness but for
[1:29:40] many I want you to think about today
[1:29:42] this time of year can bring
[1:29:45] sadness this time of year can bring
[1:29:48] loneliness and this time of year can
[1:29:50] bring a feeling of
[1:29:52] emptiness I've heard three or four
[1:29:54] different stories in the last couple of
[1:29:55] days of people who's really not looking
[1:29:57] forward to the Christmas
[1:30:01] season really not looking forward to the
[1:30:03] Christmas season because the sadness it
[1:30:06] brings into their
[1:30:07] lives people who has lost people at the
[1:30:10] this time of year memories of loved ones
[1:30:12] that have gone on times of hardship that
[1:30:15] you you you reflect back on during the
[1:30:17] Christmas time not being able to give
[1:30:19] the way you want to give so it brings a
[1:30:22] sadness it brings a heartache and
[1:30:24] sometimes those emotional challenges
[1:30:27] begin to build
[1:30:34] up but the the message today is is for
[1:30:38] you the message today is for all of us
[1:30:41] that need to be able to overcome these
[1:30:43] kinds of
[1:30:44] emotions we're people we're emotional we
[1:30:46] have emotions so I challenge you today
[1:30:49] don't let these emotions keep you from
[1:30:51] remembering the little Christmas package
[1:30:53] that was wrapped up in swaddling clothes
[1:30:56] laid in a Manger don't forget that
[1:30:59] package don't let that emotions get you
[1:31:01] and hold you back because that is the
[1:31:03] most important package that was ever

[1:32:39] that go on and and I I seen this little
[1:32:41] story and I got to share it with you
[1:32:42] just to kind of break some ice and some
[1:32:44] tension and there was a guy in Utah that
[1:32:48] decided he's going to send out 600
[1:32:50] Christmas cards to total strangers
[1:32:57] 600 Christmas cards to total
[1:33:00] strangers so he goes and he gets a the
[1:33:02] post officer gets a directory of several
[1:33:04] cities around him and he starts picking
[1:33:06] out these addresses and he writes out
[1:33:08] 600 Christmas cards to people he's never
[1:33:10] met in his life never seen never met
[1:33:13] never talked to and on these cards he
[1:33:15] puts his return
[1:33:18] address and so he goes out and he mails
[1:33:21] them puts them in the mails and puts
[1:33:22] them in the mail and and you know but
[1:33:25] here's the thing is out of 600 cards he
[1:33:29] received 117 returned cards come back to
[1:33:32] him somebody wrote something to him and
[1:33:35] what's what's funny from these responses
[1:33:37] from all these strangers listen to this
[1:33:39] now one lady
[1:33:41] wrote it was good to hear from you your
[1:33:45] card arrived the day that I come home
[1:33:46] from the hospital and I can't tell you
[1:33:48] what an encouragement was to hear from
[1:33:51] an old friend
[1:33:57] another one wrote I have to admit listen
[1:33:59] to this I have to admit when we received
[1:34:02] your card we couldn't really picture
[1:34:05] you we had to think hard for a long time
[1:34:09] before we
[1:34:12] remembered by the way please give our
[1:34:14] regards to your father he's such a
[1:34:16] wonderful
[1:34:19] man Christmas
[1:34:21] season this is the best one this is the
[1:34:24] best one the guy wrote it was good to
[1:34:26] hear from you after all these
[1:34:29] years by the way we're going to be in
[1:34:32] Salt Lake City next summer would it be
[1:34:33] all right if we came by and spend a few
[1:34:35] days with
[1:34:36] you so be careful who you send your
[1:34:39] Christmas cards to you may get some
[1:34:42] replies you're not
[1:34:44] expecting but Christmas is going around
[1:34:46] in happiness and joy and we think about
[1:34:48] that and this month is filled with
[1:34:50] sounds of Christmas bells everywhere you
[1:34:52] go the bells are ringing ringing
[1:34:55] choirs are
[1:34:56] singing and and music is filling the air
[1:34:59] but in the midst of all this joyous
[1:35:00] sounds of Jolly holly Christmas season
[1:35:04] there's other sounds too there's sounds
[1:35:06] of Anguish and sounds of grief and
[1:35:08] sounds of suffering and
[1:35:10] despair so let's go back and we'll look
[1:35:13] back over 2,000 years at the very first
[1:35:15] Christmas and and see if we can see this
[1:35:17] in Bethlehem and and we'll hear some of
[1:35:19] the sounds of going on in this busy Inn
[1:35:22] you know he comes to the end it's busy
[1:35:24] it's a busy time of the year the animals
[1:35:25] are in the stable and and the angels are
[1:35:27] singing and and and shepherds are coming
[1:35:29] to see the baby in the manger and
[1:35:31] probably Mary's voice in a soft lullab
[1:35:34] but can you imagine what Mary's voice in
[1:35:36] Her lullab would have been if she could
[1:35:38] have really sang and really know the
[1:35:39] song Mary Did You
[1:35:41] Know if she really knew what she was
[1:35:44] what she was holding in her little
[1:35:46] hands if she really knew the
[1:35:49] anguish that he that was going to have
[1:35:51] to go through Jesus's life for the next
[1:35:53] 33
[1:35:55] years you see we forget those things we
[1:35:59] forget those things we forget that as a
[1:36:01] human being Mark Lowry who wrote the
[1:36:04] song Mary Did You Know was able to tap
[1:36:05] into a little bit of that vision and see
[1:36:08] that Mary was holding a baby so precious
[1:36:11] but that this baby would go through so
[1:36:13] much anguish and distress in his
[1:36:18] life and the prophet said thinking of
[1:36:21] Bethlehem he said why did it have to be
[1:36:23] in Bethlehem why did it why did he
[1:36:25] choose birth the birthplace of Bethlehem
[1:36:28] for the King of Kings he said you know
[1:36:30] it's a very small place a small town and
[1:36:33] he said I've often wondered why God
[1:36:34] didn't choose some more religious Place
[1:36:37] such as Shiloh where the where the first
[1:36:40] tent was placed and the Ark was set and
[1:36:42] after it crossed over Jordan or gilgal
[1:36:45] another great religious City or Zion on
[1:36:47] the mountain another great religious
[1:36:49] City a proud capital of Jerusalem with
[1:36:53] all of its sages and Saints why didn't
[1:36:56] God choose
[1:36:59] Jerusalem why would he choose
[1:37:02] Bethlehem he said maybe it looked like
[1:37:05] that he may have chose some place of of
[1:37:07] a great City of Refuge now think about
[1:37:09] this that would that he would have
[1:37:11] protected his son in case some trouble
[1:37:15] came now you know there's there's times
[1:37:17] Brothers and Sisters Jesus had to push
[1:37:21] through the trouble he had had to push
[1:37:24] through the times he had to push through
[1:37:26] from the from the time of his birth he
[1:37:28] had to to go through hardships and hurts
[1:37:30] and pains he had to experience all that
[1:37:33] why did he have to experience that
[1:37:35] because you experienced that he had to
[1:37:37] know what you go through before he could
[1:37:40] die for you so now we see that Bethlehem
[1:37:44] has significance he couldn't be in some
[1:37:46] protected Refuge of a city where nothing
[1:37:48] could ever bother him or troubles could
[1:37:50] never come so we had to look at
[1:37:52] Bethlehem why God picked little
[1:37:55] Bethlehem and not choose one of these
[1:37:57] greater cities he says let me tell you
[1:38:00] he says because you know God has a way
[1:38:02] of doing things just like his own way
[1:38:05] about things I'm so glad he does
[1:38:08] sometimes he takes things that have no
[1:38:10] spiritual background or have any
[1:38:12] background at all and that's why he's
[1:38:16] God because he can take something that's
[1:38:18] nothing and make something out of it
[1:38:24] God takes you and I people who are of
[1:38:27] nothing and make something out of it and
[1:38:29] that's why he had to go to Bethlehem
[1:38:31] little Bethlehem he says that's what
[1:38:34] makes him God that's what makes us love
[1:38:37] him that's what makes poor people
[1:38:39] appreciate
[1:38:41] him because even though we're poor with
[1:38:43] no background yet God can do great
[1:38:46] things with us if he ever gets us under
[1:38:49] his
[1:38:51] control do you see why it's so important
[1:38:53] that you're under the control of the
[1:38:55] Holy Ghost that you're under the control
[1:38:57] of God's Will and God's way I don't want
[1:39:00] my will I don't want my way but I want
[1:39:03] God leading and guiding and moving in my
[1:39:09] life you want to talk about Christmas
[1:39:13] miracles you want to talk about
[1:39:15] Christmas miracles we kind of have that
[1:39:17] little joke around our house if boys do
[1:39:19] something or we do something we never do
[1:39:21] oh it's a Christmas miracle
[1:39:25] maybe y'all don't do that we
[1:39:27] do it's a Christmas miracle the boys
[1:39:30] pick their shoes up out the
[1:39:35] floor it's a Christmas miracle they took
[1:39:37] out the trash are you with
[1:39:39] me but we have we talk about these
[1:39:42] Christmas miracles but we through Christ
[1:39:44] are the Christmas miracles your life
[1:39:48] sitting here today is what a real true
[1:39:51] Christmas miracle is
[1:39:55] you know you could have been anywhere
[1:39:56] you could have been anything you could
[1:39:57] have done many things in your life but
[1:39:59] God chose you to be a Christmas
[1:40:04] miracle so the word Bethlehem let's
[1:40:07] break it down he says Beth means house l
[1:40:12] means god elham means bread he says so
[1:40:16] the house of God's bread how fitting is
[1:40:20] it that for the bread of life to come
[1:40:22] out of Bethlehem which is is the house
[1:40:24] of God's bread what a beautiful story
[1:40:28] what a beautiful story to know brothers
[1:40:29] and sisters that Bethlehem is a reminder
[1:40:31] to us that no matter what we go through
[1:40:34] in life no matter what we're going
[1:40:36] through today the very bread of life has
[1:40:39] been given to you the very bread of life
[1:40:42] you don't have to fear death
[1:40:45] anymore you don't have to fear death
[1:40:47] anymore you don't have to fear cancer
[1:40:49] you don't have to fear heart disease you
[1:40:51] don't have to fear diabetes
[1:40:54] why because fear and defeat is a word
[1:40:56] that we don't use because we are part of
[1:41:00] that Christmas
[1:41:04] miracle Luke Chapter
[1:41:07] 2 if you want to read along I'm going
[1:41:10] read verse

[1:43:30] clothes to be revealed in his true
[1:43:33] manifestation in days and years to come
[1:43:36] down the
[1:43:37] road glory to God now I want you to
[1:43:39] watch this suddenly there was with an
[1:43:41] angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts
[1:43:44] praising
[1:43:46] God praising God saying glory to God in
[1:43:51] the highest and on Earth peace Good Will

[1:43:55] men that angel was like these kids oh
[1:43:58] praise
[1:44:00] God this is something
[1:44:04] big and the angels are beginning to
[1:44:07] declare what is about to happen it says
[1:44:09] and it came to pass when the Angels were
[1:44:11] gone away the Shepherds said to one
[1:44:12] another let us now go into Bethlehem and
[1:44:15] see this thing which is to come to pass
[1:44:18] which the Lord hath made known unto us
[1:44:24] [Applause]
[1:44:27] what's he
[1:44:28] saying I've got something for you I've
[1:44:32] got something for you I've got something
[1:44:34] for the depressed for the downhearted
[1:44:36] the Brokenhearted the discouraged I've
[1:44:38] got something for you who is lost I've
[1:44:40] got something for you who has lived in
[1:44:42] such a way that you could feel like you
[1:44:43] could never come back I've got something
[1:44:45] for
[1:44:49] you but now let's fast forward a little
[1:44:52] bit
[1:44:54] time goes on and and the sounds of of of
[1:44:57] of joy and and excitement have now been
[1:45:00] been replaced with SH shouts of soldiers
[1:45:03] and cries of children and wailings and
[1:45:05] anguish of
[1:45:07] mothers you know uh to understand what
[1:45:10] I'm talking about you have to realize
[1:45:11] that for several months or even a year
[1:45:13] had passed from the time that this all
[1:45:15] began to start now Mary and Joseph and
[1:45:17] Jesus they're not in a stable
[1:45:20] anymore he's a small child they're not
[1:45:22] in a stable anymore and and here they
[1:45:24] are in a small house in Bethlehem and
[1:45:25] here come the Magi the wise men as we
[1:45:29] call them they come to worship him and
[1:45:32] you know the story in Matthew 2 we won't
[1:45:34] pull it up but I'll just rehearse it
[1:45:36] Matthew 2 13-18 if you're making notes
[1:45:39] listen to what happens when the Magi
[1:45:41] leaves Bethlehem to return to their
[1:45:44] Homeland when they had gone the angel of
[1:45:47] the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream
[1:45:49] and he told him get
[1:45:51] up get up you've got to get out of here
[1:45:53] you've got to take the child and his
[1:45:55] mother and escape to Egypt now you're
[1:45:58] going to have to stay there until I tell
[1:46:01] you because Herod is going to search for
[1:46:04] the child and kill
[1:46:07] him that old
[1:46:10] Grinch That Old Grinch what was he
[1:46:13] trying to do he was trying to steal the
[1:46:15] gift of God he's trying to steal the
[1:46:19] gift of God he's trying to steal Joy
[1:46:23] he's trying to steal hope he's trying to
[1:46:25] steal your love your happiness your
[1:46:27] overcoming power he wants to kill it and
[1:46:29] snuff it out so that you could never
[1:46:32] have any manifestations of God
[1:46:39] Almighty so he gets up he takes the
[1:46:42] child he takes Mary he takes the and
[1:46:45] during the night and they leave for
[1:46:46] Egypt where they stay until the death of
[1:46:49] Herod comes and and and so it was
[1:46:52] fulfilled at what the Lord had said
[1:46:54] through the prophet out of Egypt I shall
[1:46:56] call my son you see how the scripture
[1:46:58] works it never leaves us
[1:47:00] hanging it never leaves us hanging
[1:47:04] because you see brothers and sisters all
[1:47:06] of this that we're talking about and
[1:47:07] everything we've described it's all
[1:47:09] talking about part of the King's Highway
[1:47:12] scriptures have to be fulfilled
[1:47:15] prophecies have to come to
[1:47:17] pass are you with me so for there to be
[1:47:21] a savior there had to be a hunted down
[1:47:23] child of
[1:47:24] God and this child is hunted down and
[1:47:27] when Herod realized that that he'd been
[1:47:30] outsmarted and outwitted by the Magi he
[1:47:33] became Furious right he became Furious
[1:47:36] and he gave orders I want these people
[1:47:39] gone I want you to kill every boy under
[1:47:42] the age of two in this city and the
[1:47:44] surrounding
[1:47:45] cities you talk about putting out a
[1:47:48] decree you're talking about trying to
[1:47:50] get rid of a of something you didn't
[1:47:52] want to to
[1:47:54] manifest he's going to annihilate a
[1:47:56] whole race of of young boys just to get
[1:47:59] to
[1:48:02] one but the Bible says that was when it
[1:48:05] was said through the Prophet Jeremiah
[1:48:06] Was fulfilled a voice was heard in R RMA
[1:48:09] weeping and great moaning and Rachel
[1:48:11] weeping for her children and refusing to
[1:48:14] be comforted because they are no
[1:48:17] more you see we don't look at this side
[1:48:20] of Christmas
[1:48:23] but the reality is this is what
[1:48:25] Christmas is
[1:48:26] about this is where Christmas is really
[1:48:29] about it's not about a Santa Claus it's
[1:48:32] not about an elf or an elf on a
[1:48:35] shelf or a trump in a White
[1:48:38] House it's not about any of those things
[1:48:41] it's not about reindeer no more than the
[1:48:43] Easter's about an Easter
[1:48:45] Bunny it's about what happened in the
[1:48:47] land of of the of uh Bethlehem to get
[1:48:52] Jesus on the road to
[1:48:54] Calvary wailing and weeping mothers
[1:48:57] crying over the loss of their children
[1:49:00] so this this this scripture tells us
[1:49:02] tells us of an insecure and insane Old
[1:49:07] King who feels
[1:49:09] threatened he feels threatened because
[1:49:11] he knows that there's been another King
[1:49:14] born so when we talk about the sounds of
[1:49:17] Christmas maybe we need to remember the
[1:49:18] the shouts of soldiers the cries of
[1:49:21] children The Wailing of their mothers
[1:49:24] [Music]
[1:49:29] for these are part of the Christmas
[1:49:33] sounds
[1:49:36] pain I preached a Christmas message one
[1:49:39] time on Mary and the pain she must have
[1:49:42] felt as she watched Jesus walk to
[1:49:45] Calvary that was a Christmas
[1:49:48] message but that's
[1:49:50] true you know in order
[1:49:53] in order to have Deliverance somebody
[1:49:55] had to be
[1:49:56] bound there's there's there's negative
[1:49:58] sides to Christmas but those negatives
[1:50:01] turn into positive for there to be Joy
[1:50:02] somebody had to have
[1:50:04] sorrow for there to be good tidings
[1:50:07] somebody had to suffer for there to be
[1:50:10] healing somebody had to be sick before
[1:50:12] there was a miracle there had to be a
[1:50:13] mountain to
[1:50:14] overcome some of us are facing
[1:50:18] mountains we need the gift of
[1:50:21] Christmas right wrapped in swaddling
[1:50:25] clothes for the Lost we had to have a
[1:50:29] savior in order for me to ever find my
[1:50:32] way to heaven I had to have Jesus Christ
[1:50:37] there's no other way around it you can
[1:50:39] try to come up with Creeds and dogmas
[1:50:41] and
[1:50:42] pledges and put your name on books but
[1:50:45] until you have Jesus Christ until you've
[1:50:48] been baptized in Jesus Christ's name and
[1:50:50] you've been buried and your sins are
[1:50:52] gone on and you come up a different
[1:50:54] person your life begins to change that's
[1:50:57] what it means to be lost and to have a
[1:51:01] savior that's right and all of these are
[1:51:04] part of what God is trying to remind us
[1:51:06] at this season and if that's so what
[1:51:09] what is God trying to say he is he
[1:51:12] suffering this
[1:51:14] world is going to
[1:51:16] happen suffering in this world is going
[1:51:19] to happen
[1:51:23] but he said if you suffer in this world
[1:51:25] I'll bear it with you you see that's the
[1:51:28] difference is when we begin to look at
[1:51:30] it in the right light yes I may have to
[1:51:32] suffer I may have to go through things I
[1:51:34] may have to go through hardships but God
[1:51:36] promised me he promised me that I will
[1:51:39] go with you if you're suffering I'll
[1:51:41] bear it with you if you're hurting I'll
[1:51:43] bear it with
[1:51:45] you you remember the story of King uh
[1:51:48] King of England when he came through the
[1:51:50] British Columbia in Vancouver and and
[1:51:52] the prophet tells this story and he
[1:51:54] tells it says all the schools let out
[1:51:57] all the schools leted out to see this
[1:51:58] King and the Canadian people they wanted
[1:52:00] to take time and be loyal to their King
[1:52:03] and they go out into the streets they
[1:52:04] gave all the little children the
[1:52:06] flags the flags of the country and so
[1:52:10] all the school children were there and
[1:52:11] they were waving their flags and they
[1:52:13] were hooping and hollering and and all
[1:52:15] hell to the
[1:52:16] king God blessed the king God long lived
[1:52:20] the king
[1:52:23] and the kids come back to
[1:52:26] school and the teacher is looking and
[1:52:28] she's taking a headcount you might say
[1:52:30] and she realizes one of the little girls
[1:52:32] is not there and she gets frustrated she
[1:52:33] says where is
[1:52:35] Martha and they said I don't know we she
[1:52:37] was just with us she was just down on
[1:52:39] the street but she's not here now we got
[1:52:41] to go find Martha so the teacher and the
[1:52:43] children they all go out to go try to
[1:52:45] find Martha and they're looking around
[1:52:47] every corner here and there and the
[1:52:49] teacher runs through the streets and
[1:52:51] finally she sees
[1:52:53] Martha standing over at a telegraph pole
[1:52:56] with her head against the pole her hands
[1:52:58] head in her hands and she's crying in
[1:53:00] Weeping and weeping and
[1:53:04] weeping the teacher picks her up and
[1:53:06] says Martha honey why are you
[1:53:09] weeping didn't you get to wave your flag
[1:53:11] to the
[1:53:12] king yes yes I waved my flag to the king
[1:53:17] well well didn't you get to say your
[1:53:19] Praises To The King yes I got to say the
[1:53:21] praise and to the king so why are you
[1:53:24] weeping and she said you know teacher I
[1:53:26] saw the king but I was so little he
[1:53:29] didn't see
[1:53:32] me I'm so little he didn't see me but
[1:53:36] that's not the way it is with our King
[1:53:38] Jesus that's not the way it is I don't
[1:53:40] care how little you are how little you
[1:53:43] do whatever the smallest thing you can
[1:53:45] do and you know about God sees
[1:53:50] you he knows every little heartache he
[1:53:53] knows every little disappointment he
[1:53:55] knows every little pain he knows every
[1:53:58] little thing that you have going on and
[1:54:00] he still God and he still loves you and
[1:54:02] he still knows you you see that's a good
[1:54:05] thing he says our Lord he meets in the
[1:54:07] Realms of man sometimes he meets in
[1:54:09] great groups of
[1:54:10] men think about this sometimes he meets
[1:54:14] with a
[1:54:15] few he says one time he come and he met
[1:54:17] with 500 after the time of his
[1:54:20] resurrection and then we have a time
[1:54:22] where he met with 70 he met with 12 he
[1:54:25] met with three and there's times that he
[1:54:28] just meets with
[1:54:32] one aren't you glad you're that one
[1:54:35] aren't you glad this morning that you're
[1:54:37] that one that through all that he sees
[1:54:39] all the world person after person after
[1:54:42] person that's he knows exactly what
[1:54:44] you're going through the world may not
[1:54:47] know
[1:54:48] it that's right the world may never know
[1:54:51] your hurt
[1:54:55] your husband may never know you're
[1:54:57] hurting your pastor may never know
[1:54:59] you're hurting your brother your sister
[1:55:02] may never know you're
[1:55:05] hurting but he
[1:55:07] knows that's the one thing about God you
[1:55:10] cannot hide from God no matter what
[1:55:13] you're feeling what you're going through
[1:55:15] what you're hurting whether you're happy
[1:55:16] whether you're sad whether you're
[1:55:18] praising whether you're doubting he
[1:55:20] knows what you're feeling and he knows
[1:55:23] he you're never too little for God to
[1:55:25] know and we believe we believe that the
[1:55:28] Bible is the unfall word of God
[1:55:31] right so when it tells the story of
[1:55:33] Christmas it's not only telling about
[1:55:35] angels and Shepherds and wise men and
[1:55:37] Gifts of gold and frankincense we sang
[1:55:39] about it frankincense and
[1:55:41] Mer but he's also talking about a king
[1:55:44] and
[1:55:45] soldiers and the murder of little
[1:55:49] children you see it's telling a journey
[1:55:52] J from a
[1:55:53] Manger to a
[1:55:56] cross can you imagine what it was like
[1:55:58] to have been a parent in Bethlehem at
[1:56:00] that
[1:56:01] time can you imagine what it was like to
[1:56:04] have your your son you you've got a
[1:56:06] little boy and you've been a waiting
[1:56:07] anticipation and now he's maybe 18
[1:56:09] months old and he's captured your heart
[1:56:11] you've watched him you fed him you've
[1:56:13] nursed him you've watched him grow up
[1:56:14] and he's crawled and now he's pulling up
[1:56:16] and he's walking and he always says Dad
[1:56:20] Dad and now all of a sudden the soldiers
[1:56:24] burst into your home and they begin to
[1:56:26] search through room after room after
[1:56:28] room after room and they're trying to
[1:56:30] find what they know you've got hidden
[1:56:32] your prized son your prized boy that you
[1:56:35] you've wanted and cherished so much and
[1:56:37] you've got him hit and they come in and
[1:56:39] they grab a hold of
[1:56:40] him you want to talk about
[1:56:43] anguish but that's part of the Christmas
[1:56:45] story
[1:56:47] too part of that Christmas story is God
[1:56:50] gave His only begotten son
[1:56:53] that whosoever should believe in him
[1:56:55] shall not perish but have what
[1:56:57] everlasting life that's what part of the
[1:57:00] Christmas story is bringing out we may
[1:57:02] still have anguish we may still have
[1:57:05] anguish during the Christmas season no
[1:57:07] doubt many will suffer no doubt many are
[1:57:10] going through things in their life and
[1:57:11] the the joyous celebration is not going
[1:57:13] to be just a joyous celebration but
[1:57:17] pain but
[1:57:19] Christmas christ
[1:57:22] comes to a suffering
[1:57:25] world and he tells us and and lets us
[1:57:28] know that God doesn't just he doesn't
[1:57:30] always guarantee to take away our
[1:57:32] suffering but he Bears it with
[1:57:36] us I read this story and found it and
[1:57:40] stuck out to me and you think man this
[1:57:41] is not much of a Christmas story but
[1:57:44] listen to it eleazer wisel it's a Jewish
[1:57:48] author he wrote a book entitled night he
[1:57:51] was a a a slave laborer in the World War
[1:57:54] II German concentration camps and he
[1:57:56] writes about the Holocaust and he writes
[1:57:59] about things that happened to him during
[1:58:01] the
[1:58:01] war and he he tells how his father was
[1:58:05] was a more of a humanitarian type and he
[1:58:07] encouraged him to learn Hebrew and and
[1:58:09] to do unto others and he says his mother
[1:58:11] was more of of the believer type and she
[1:58:14] encouraged him to study the word and and
[1:58:16] to serve serve God and and to be
[1:58:19] faithful and in March of 1944 Germany
[1:58:23] occupied
[1:58:24] Hungary and and and they begin to come
[1:58:27] in and they begin to extend their their
[1:58:28] territory into the Holocaust and went
[1:58:30] into Northern
[1:58:32] Transylvania now weissel is 15 years old
[1:58:36] and he is he's he's captured along with
[1:58:39] his family and the rest of the town's
[1:58:41] Jewish population and they're put into
[1:58:43] one of two concentration
[1:58:45] camps 15 years old immediately they were
[1:58:49] sent to asts
[1:58:52] his mother and younger sister murdered
[1:58:54] on the
[1:58:55] scene wetel and his father were selected
[1:58:58] to perform labor as long as they were
[1:59:00] able and when they wasn't able anymore
[1:59:02] they would be sent to the gas
[1:59:04] Chambers and he tells in his story in
[1:59:06] his autobiography he tells he said my
[1:59:09] main motivation for surviving Asha was
[1:59:12] knowing that my father was still alive I
[1:59:15] knew that if I died or letting my father
[1:59:17] know I was still alive I knew that if I
[1:59:20] died he would die
[1:59:23] and he said they taken uh taken us to to
[1:59:26] bersin Wad and his father died before
[1:59:28] the camp could be liberated so now he's
[1:59:30] on his own 15 years old and he tells the
[1:59:34] shame that he felt when he heard his
[1:59:36] father being beaten and he was unable to
[1:59:43] help that's a place called
[1:59:47] Calvary can you imagine the pain and the
[1:59:49] suffering that Jesus felt on the cross
[1:59:51] of of Calvary and he's being beaten and
[1:59:54] he's being beaten and beyond
[1:59:56] recognition and the blood is Flowing out
[1:59:58] of his vessels and out of his brow and
[2:00:00] off of his forehead and his father looks
[2:00:03] at him and says there's not a thing I
[2:00:04] can do for
[2:00:09] you one
[2:00:11] evening he returned after a day of Labor
[2:00:15] and he looks out and they as the group
[2:00:16] come in they discover and they see that
[2:00:18] there's three Gallows set up into the
[2:00:21] into the front front area of the of the
[2:00:24] camp and they look at these Gallows and
[2:00:28] there's three prisoners are going to be
[2:00:31] executed and in order to get their point
[2:00:34] across the guards had orders to force
[2:00:37] all the prisoners to watch the
[2:00:41] executions two of the victims were
[2:00:44] men but into the horror of what was
[2:00:47] about to happen the prisoners saw that
[2:00:49] the third one was only a small boy
[2:00:53] a small boy hanging between two
[2:00:55] men fixing to take his place on The
[2:00:59] Gallows and the noes were then put
[2:01:01] around their necks and and as they were
[2:01:04] put around their necks the three were
[2:01:05] made to stand on the chairs and then the
[2:01:07] chairs kicked out from underneath them
[2:01:09] instantly the two men
[2:01:11] died the boy be to gasp the boy began to
[2:01:16] struggle for Life the boy began to to
[2:01:18] pant and try to catch his breath he
[2:01:20] wasn't heavy enough for the news to take
[2:01:23] action for 30 minutes he said we watched
[2:01:27] this boy struggle to
[2:01:31] live and he said in the crowd after the
[2:01:33] boy had finally died 30 minutes later he
[2:01:35] said behind him there was a man that
[2:01:37] cried out and said you say there is a
[2:01:40] God where is God
[2:01:42] now and he said immediately the thought
[2:01:45] came to his mind and he turned around
[2:01:46] and he faced him and he said I'm looking
[2:01:48] at God right now I'm looking at God as
[2:01:52] that boy hangs between two
[2:01:54] men God never left him God never forsook
[2:01:57] him God was with him God was even in him
[2:02:00] to the end of his life and that's the
[2:02:02] way it is with
[2:02:03] Christians God is with us he's in us and
[2:02:06] to the very end we will not be
[2:02:11] forsaken our God is Not beyond the
[2:02:14] stars our God is not not off in some Far
[2:02:17] Away
[2:02:18] Heavens he he's not right there but he
[2:02:20] came down here with with us suffering
[2:02:22] with us hurting with us bleeding with us
[2:02:25] that's the message of
[2:02:31] Christmas I think of
[2:02:34] uncertainty I think of uncertainty when
[2:02:36] I think about the lives of Mary and
[2:02:38] Joseph as they hurriedly packed up all
[2:02:40] their belongings and and they they get
[2:02:43] ready to leave to go to Bethlehem and
[2:02:45] leave Bethlehem and go to Egypt and Mary
[2:02:47] and Joseph begin to flee to Egypt not
[2:02:50] knowing where they would stay
[2:02:52] how many of you ever go on trips not
[2:02:54] knowing where you're going to
[2:02:57] stay one time that's was the last time
[2:02:59] wasn't
[2:03:02] it that ain't no fun I've done that
[2:03:05] before too called the cockroach in where
[2:03:08] we
[2:03:12] stayed but Mary and Joseph flee in Egypt
[2:03:15] they didn't know where they were going
[2:03:16] to stay it was a life of uncertainty
[2:03:18] they didn't know what the future held
[2:03:19] for them they didn't know what was going
[2:03:21] to happen happen all they knew was God
[2:03:23] was leading them I don't think God LED
[2:03:25] my wife to get that hotel for me just
[2:03:27] putting that out
[2:03:29] there but Mary and Joseph they just knew
[2:03:32] they were being led they've been told by
[2:03:34] an Angel that Jesus was to be the Savior
[2:03:37] that Jesus is going to save the people
[2:03:39] from their
[2:03:40] sins but what was their
[2:03:43] responsibility how were they going to
[2:03:45] raise the Son of God what did the future
[2:03:48] hold for them but uncertainty
[2:03:52] uncertainty you see our lives are
[2:03:54] uncertain teenagers your lives are
[2:03:58] uncertain you begin to
[2:04:00] question what am I going to do am I
[2:04:03] going to finish school am I going to go
[2:04:04] to college am I going to am I going to
[2:04:06] get married am I going to am I what am I
[2:04:08] going to do is this the one for me is
[2:04:09] that the one for me do I even need to
[2:04:11] get married and on and on and on and on
[2:04:13] it's a life of uncertainty where am I
[2:04:15] going to work what kind of job am I
[2:04:16] going to do am I going to be a
[2:04:17] businessman am I going to do this am I
[2:04:18] going to do that am I going to be a
[2:04:19] carpenter am I going to be a plumber you
[2:04:20] see what I mean it's it's a life of
[2:04:22] uncertainty so all these things begin to
[2:04:24] get uncertain but one thing about it you
[2:04:27] don't have to
[2:04:30] wonder you just put it before God and
[2:04:32] you just wait for something to happen
[2:04:34] you see life is uncertain but Mary and
[2:04:36] Joseph had one great Advantage they knew
[2:04:39] that God was leading the way and God was
[2:04:41] going to take care of them you see young
[2:04:44] people that is what you have to do in
[2:04:45] your life you have to say no matter what
[2:04:48] goes on I don't know if I'm going to
[2:04:49] pass or fail if I'll find him or her I
[2:04:52] don't know but one thing I know if I
[2:04:54] will put my life first before
[2:04:57] Christ come on parents help me preach if
[2:05:01] I will put my life first before Christ
[2:05:04] all the uncertainty won't
[2:05:08] matter here's this little Jesus jostled
[2:05:11] back and forth in on his journey to
[2:05:15] Egypt struggling jostling back and forth
[2:05:18] on the donkey to get to Egypt only to
[2:05:21] find out that one day he'll tell
[2:05:24] multitudes about the
[2:05:26] birds that the birds don't worry about
[2:05:29] where they're going to
[2:05:31] eat that the lies they don't think about
[2:05:35] nothing they don't care if they're
[2:05:37] clothed they just do what they do lies
[2:05:39] just do what they L birds do what they
[2:05:41] do Christians just do what Christians
[2:05:45] do we don't have to worry about the
[2:05:48] uncertainty and as Believers we have an
[2:05:51] advantage man to know that while we
[2:05:52] don't know what tomorrow holds We Know
[2:05:55] Who Holds
[2:05:56] Tomorrow you say I don't know what's
[2:05:58] going to happen
[2:06:00] tomorrow God knows he holds it he holds
[2:06:03] your future
[2:06:10] Paul so uncertainty is a Christmas
[2:06:15] message and finally there's
[2:06:19] death there's death in our world
[2:06:23] there's death in our world but God came
[2:06:25] to overcome it you see there was a
[2:06:28] brutal death long ago in Bethlehem and
[2:06:31] the cries of the children pierced the
[2:06:33] air innocent children victims of an
[2:06:36] insane King but there was one
[2:06:40] child one boy
[2:06:43] child that was
[2:06:46] saved and he was carried away off into
[2:06:49] the land called Egypt and that one child
[2:06:52] would someday become a victim himself 33
[2:06:55] years down the road he would find
[2:06:57] himself on a road called
[2:07:00] Calvary and because Jesus became the
[2:07:03] sacrifice for our sin death was now
[2:07:06] defeated death is defeated you see that
[2:07:09] there is no death in our
[2:07:11] world did you hear what I said as a
[2:07:14] Believer and as a child of God there is
[2:07:17] no death in our world there may be Death
[2:07:21] Around around us people may go may cross
[2:07:23] over but Christians do not
[2:07:27] die if you believe they do you're really
[2:07:29] you're believe in the wrong
[2:07:32] message because Christians do not
[2:07:36] die and here is Jesus walking down this
[2:07:41] highway walking down this highway that
[2:07:43] is fit for the king to
[2:07:45] travel and this highway he's walking
[2:07:48] down is a Highway for the King of Kings
[2:07:50] and the Lord of lords
[2:07:52] now when I think about this highway it's
[2:07:54] a highway I should have been
[2:07:57] walking are you with me this road that
[2:08:01] he's walking is my road this road he's
[2:08:04] traveling was my road it was my sins it
[2:08:08] was my
[2:08:09] shortcomings I'm the one who drove the
[2:08:11] nails in his hands I'm the one who put
[2:08:14] the crown on his
[2:08:19] head what's this man done the crowd
[2:08:22] cried what's this man done and you hear
[2:08:26] the dragon the prophet tells the story
[2:08:28] The bumping coming down the
[2:08:30] cobblestones and you hear the bumpity
[2:08:32] bumpity bump and you see the little
[2:08:34] frail body of about 120 PBS with 120 lb
[2:08:39] cross on his back and his head pressed
[2:08:41] up against the
[2:08:43] side and he says he's coming down the
[2:08:45] streets and you hear Bump by bump byy
[2:08:48] bump of that Old Rugged Cross
[2:08:51] and as he's coming down the street you
[2:08:53] notice uh he said you notice a little
[2:08:55] while that the the the robe he's wearing
[2:08:57] that's throw it over his back without
[2:08:59] seams he said they took him up there and
[2:09:02] they brought him into vulgarity they
[2:09:04] made him
[2:09:06] naked now do you see what opening the
[2:09:08] present's all
[2:09:10] about at once he was wrapped in
[2:09:12] swaddling clothes he was a baby in a
[2:09:15] manger and in that manger he was
[2:09:18] everything that he ever would be all the
[2:09:21] potential poal that ever that Jesus
[2:09:22] would ever be was right there wrapped up
[2:09:25] but now all of a sudden he's exposed
[2:09:26] before the whole
[2:09:28] world that's the gift of
[2:09:31] Christmas Calvary is the gift of
[2:09:34] Christmas Calvary is where you overcome
[2:09:36] depression Calvary is where you overcome
[2:09:39] the gift of your sanity Calvary is where
[2:09:42] healing takes place Calvary is where
[2:09:45] where you're released and you're free
[2:09:46] from the sins of your life that's
[2:09:48] Calvary that's the gift of God
[2:09:52] and he says he you see him fall and and
[2:09:55] he's on this road to galtha and he's
[2:09:57] going up to the hill and you see that
[2:09:59] bee buzzing around
[2:10:01] him and he said that bee is buzzing
[2:10:03] around him and saying I'm going to sting
[2:10:05] you and he says that bee is telling him
[2:10:08] it won't be long now you're going to
[2:10:11] Calvary do you still want to
[2:10:15] go can you imagine when when he asked
[2:10:18] him do you still want to go
[2:10:21] and he said
[2:10:24] no Joe needs me Paul needs me Gideon
[2:10:29] needs me Caleb needs me John needs me
[2:10:34] Troy needs
[2:10:37] me do you still want to go
[2:10:40] yeah that's my
[2:10:43] children that's my
[2:10:45] family G needs
[2:10:48] me and that's how much he cares as he
[2:10:51] walks down there bumpity bumpity bump
[2:10:53] and the prophet says that's the love of
[2:10:55] God how he unfolded himself how he
[2:10:57] became the Christmas
[2:11:00] package he became the PRI the Christmas
[2:11:03] package he was laid on the straw the
[2:11:05] first thing he pressed his little head
[2:11:06] against was a straw and the last thing
[2:11:09] was a crown of
[2:11:10] thorns he says that's the Christmas
[2:11:13] package they they took a dirty Rag and
[2:11:16] wrapped it around him and beat him and
[2:11:17] said if you're the prophet tell us who
[2:11:19] hit you and then they tacked him to the
[2:11:20] cross
[2:11:22] with love reaching
[2:11:24] out those hands were symbolic of the
[2:11:27] world the weight of the world and how he
[2:11:29] would surround the world with his
[2:11:35] love
[2:11:37] father forgive
[2:11:41] them can you
[2:11:43] imagine father forgive them they don't
[2:11:46] know what they're doing
[2:11:52] that Bee's buzzing
[2:11:55] around but as that bee began to sting
[2:11:59] Christ Prophet says that Stinger was
[2:12:01] pulled
[2:12:02] out now that bee that buzzes around you
[2:12:05] and say it says I'm going to take your
[2:12:07] life I'm going to take this I'm going to
[2:12:09] take that that bee no longer has a
[2:12:12] stinger so the sting of death no longer
[2:12:15] exist and that's why Paul could say
[2:12:18] death where is thy sting oh great
[2:12:21] where is thy
[2:12:23] Victory it's because the sting of death
[2:12:25] has been removed and Jesus wins the
[2:12:30] battle you see brothers and sisters
[2:12:32] death is real it's always been here
[2:12:35] suffering is here it's always been
[2:12:38] here but a baby born in a stable laid in
[2:12:42] a Manger rejected of the world took that
[2:12:45] sting of
[2:12:47] death and has given victory over it
[2:12:51] that little baby that was wrapped in
[2:12:53] swaddling cloth now is revealed before
[2:12:57] the world I'm savior I'm healer I'm
[2:13:01] deliverer I'm peace I'm Joy I'm love I'm
[2:13:06] longsuffering I'm gentleness I'm
[2:13:09] kindness I'm everything that I want you
[2:13:12] to be look unto me I'm the greatest
[2:13:18] gift hardship in a Time
[2:13:21] of
[2:13:23] Happiness there's a story I read about a
[2:13:25] family who had lost their seven-year-old
[2:13:27] son Doug I don't know who this is for
[2:13:30] but it just I just could I just couldn't
[2:13:32] get away from it and they experienced
[2:13:35] all the Dynamics of
[2:13:37] grief they went through everything all
[2:13:39] the different stages of grief they went
[2:13:41] to listening to counselors they went to
[2:13:43] to experts they were trying to do
[2:13:45] everything exactly like it was supposed
[2:13:46] to be done until they felt and they felt
[2:13:50] like they were doing really good until
[2:13:51] they begin to deal with the
[2:13:53] grief when they put up their Christmas
[2:13:58] tree it was time to put up the Christmas
[2:14:00] tree and the family all gathered
[2:14:03] around and they began to go through and
[2:14:05] they begin to hang the ornaments up and
[2:14:08] the mother begins to remember some of
[2:14:11] the ornaments that was made by her son
[2:14:13] who is now gone and as a parent we've
[2:14:16] all got them right you got the little

[2:15:55] no doubt it hurts it grips our hearts it
[2:15:57] makes us want to shed
[2:15:59] tears but that's the
[2:16:02] reality douge is having more fun than we
[2:16:07] are I'm going to try to lighten up just
[2:16:10] a little bit before we end today's
[2:16:13] service and I'll tell you this story
[2:16:15] there was a preacher and his family they
[2:16:17] started putting up their nativity scene
[2:16:19] in their front yard
[2:16:21] and so all of them are carrying out
[2:16:22] their figures of the nativity
[2:16:25] scene and they're bringing out all these
[2:16:27] different different little things of the
[2:16:29] Nativity they're bringing out Joseph and
[2:16:30] Mary and the manger and baby and angels
[2:16:33] and Shepherds and Barnyard animals you
[2:16:34] know the scene we've we've all seen the
[2:16:36] scene and they're bringing this scene
[2:16:38] out well here comes little
[2:16:41] Scott he comes out here and he's
[2:16:43] carrying one of his favorite toys and
[2:16:45] he's carrying out this F this this big S
[2:16:48] foot inflatable
[2:16:51] tyranosaurus
[2:16:55] Rex and he brings it out there and they
[2:16:57] say what are you gonna do with that he
[2:16:58] said I'm going to put it in the nativity
[2:17:00] scene and his dad the pastor now of the
[2:17:01] church says no no no no no no we can't
[2:17:04] do that you you can't do that because
[2:17:06] dinosaurs wasn't in this this scene
[2:17:08] right here we can't be putting T T-Rex
[2:17:10] in the scene of the manger he said Dad
[2:17:13] please please please please you know how
[2:17:14] it is please please please please please
[2:17:16] oh well
[2:17:18] okay so they put up the T-Rex they flate
[2:17:21] the T-Rex the big sft tall
[2:17:27] T-Rex and they they look back they step
[2:17:30] back and they
[2:17:32] look and as they see this T-Rex in the
[2:17:34] navity Nativity Scene It Dawns on them
[2:17:38] and they realized that this dinosaur was
[2:17:40] actually saying more than what they
[2:17:42] realized they begin to look at it and
[2:17:44] they said you know what this menacing
[2:17:46] character hovers over us threatening to
[2:17:49] Rob us of our joy our our peace and our
[2:17:52] cheer and here this big dinosaur is now
[2:17:56] hovering over the scene we can't allow
[2:17:58] the things of this world the enemy the
[2:18:00] old Dragon to come down and steal our
[2:18:02] joy and our love and our
[2:18:07] peace but Christmas Comes to remind us
[2:18:10] that it's more than a baby in a
[2:18:14] Manger but don't forget that baby's a
[2:18:17] whole lot stronger than that
[2:18:19] dinosaur hovering over your
[2:18:22] back musicians if you
[2:18:26] come I know this was a little different
[2:18:29] today probably like you've never heard
[2:18:31] Christmas before but I trust it was
[2:18:34] beneficial to
[2:18:37] somebody you know I can remember going
[2:18:40] through hard times and hardship and I
[2:18:42] can remember looking I can remember
[2:18:44] where I was sitting and I may have told
[2:18:46] this story but we were going to college
[2:18:48] at the time and I can remember looking
[2:18:50] at the person next to me and he was on
[2:18:52] the phone and he was smiling and I told
[2:18:54] myself something told me I should say
[2:18:57] that's the way I should put it I was
[2:18:58] just it come to me that even though he's
[2:19:00] smiling and he seems happy I really
[2:19:02] don't know what that man's going
[2:19:04] through we never know what somebody's
[2:19:06] going
[2:19:12] through we're going to probably try to
[2:19:14] sing Silent Night Sister Sister Becky if
[2:19:17] you just want to play that I'm going to
[2:19:18] read you this one last quote it says and
[2:19:21] she looked at him talking about Mary
[2:19:24] says Joseph have you noticed the star
[2:19:26] hanging
[2:19:27] Yonder and when he looked and S the
[2:19:31] surprise he said I hadn't noticed it
[2:19:34] before dear said well it's been flowing
[2:19:37] it's been following us ever since the
[2:19:38] sun went down and I've watched it it
[2:19:41] must mean something because I have the
[2:19:43] most wonderful
[2:19:45] feeling I have the most wonderful
[2:19:47] feeling and Joseph said Mary
[2:19:51] you know what I've never been so happy
[2:19:54] in all my
[2:19:56] life that's the spirit of
[2:19:58] Christmas he said way into the East and
[2:20:01] many hundreds of miles away from there
[2:20:04] the Magi were already on the road they
[2:20:06] had seen his star they was coming to
[2:20:08] worship God God's little gift package
[2:20:10] that he was sending to the world he said
[2:20:13] but just a little while from then the
[2:20:15] world was going to receive its greatest
[2:20:17] gift that it had ever received a little
[2:20:20] package wrapped up a little the first
[2:20:23] little Christmas package that was ever
[2:20:25] wrapped in all the
[2:20:28] world and he said God wrapped it up and
[2:20:32] I want to break in on my thought and say
[2:20:33] this he says the greatest thing was ever
[2:20:37] wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in
[2:20:40] that God himself wrapped his own self in
[2:20:44] the Christmas package and sent it to the
[2:20:47] world aren't you thankful for the
[2:20:49] Christmas package let's stand to our
