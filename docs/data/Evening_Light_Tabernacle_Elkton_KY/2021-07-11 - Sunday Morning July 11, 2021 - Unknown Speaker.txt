would you open the service in prayer for us father are we thankful again jesus that we've been committed it's another time together together in your precious buildings lord the house of god lord jesus made the spirit of the holy ghost over shadow and coming to this moment today give us peace of mind with you god let us be able to walk in the spirit today accept the spirit the word of god today we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen uh psalm 63 yes children can be dismissed for sunday school in just a second psalm 63 oh god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a day and in a dry and thirsty land where no water is because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee my soul shall be satisfied as with morrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth altogether but the king shall rejoice in god everyone that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped you can have your seats brother brian good morning brothers and sisters uh if you return with me to uh ii corinthians the third chapter before i get started i know we had a had a missionary offering last week so with what's been people the offerings people have made over over the last couple of months right now in the missionary fund there's uh seven to three hundred dollars and brother thomas gave an offering to someone a couple of weeks ago and it would have been it would have been about eight thousand dollars um with all the obligations that we have taking the missionary fund and taking all those other things out of out of the funds we have about eleven thousand dollars in the general fund and as of uh the tenth of this month uh there's eighty-eight thousand dollars left to pay off on the principle of the church and uh it's i've said this before the church is a 25-year loan the maturity date is like october september of 2030 so we're well ahead we're probably three or four years ahead of uh early right now and having it paid off so god is more than able you know that was a pretty good psalm this morning so i don't know who you are or where you come from people here this morning but if you came here depressed that psalm pretty much tells you that you shouldn't be depressed as a christian really should you be depressed i'm not saying there isn't spirits or depression out there in the world but if you've got that kind of hope and that kind of god that's taking care of you really should you be sad this morning should be no you should be happy and joyful that god has thought about you from the foundation of the earth and the beginning of everything god had you in his mind and had you in his purpose so with thoughts like that how can you be depressed i mean doesn't mean that life can't beat you down sometimes but in the end you got light at the end of the tunnel just think of that person next to you that you work with that doesn't have any light at the end of the tunnel that'd be a pretty miserable place to be this morning but before i go into uh that chapter and corinthians you got you don't have to turn to it i'll read here but i was just sitting in my office this morning and i was thinking you know if we were going to use examples to follow i was just i don't know why i was thinking about this but i was thinking about the first chapter of jonah and and uh i'll read a few of these verses here but you got to remember these men that were on the ship with jonah they they weren't hebrews they weren't like us they were just regular regular gentiles like you and me in a sense they were like us they were just regular gentiles worshipping their own gods but they had more manliness about them than most people in the world today and i'll just and i'll explain why i'll say that but the lord's this is in the fourth verse but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so the ship was like to be broken and you got to remember we're talking several thousand years ago and we're talking wood ships with square cells and oars and they couldn't tack in the wind the only thing they could do is stare by a square sail so it means the only time they could use a sail is when the wind was in their favor or in the direction they wanted to go so they didn't have this the ability to react with the seeds like they do today more afraid and it goes large out the grain went into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that chips was like to be broken then the mares were afraid and cried every man ought to his god and cast forth awares that we're in the ship into the sea to lighten it any of them but jonah was down in the sides of the ship as he lay and he was fast asleep so so the ship master came to him and said unto him what means thou o sleeper arrives call upon our god if we so be that god will think upon us that we perish not and they said everyone to his fellow come let us cast lots that we may know for those for whose cause this evil is upon us so they cast lots and the lots fell upon jonah so jonah was still hiding the fact of hawaii was on the boat then he said unto them tell it said on then tell us we pray thee for this cause this evil is upon us and what is thine occupation and once comes thou what is thy country and of what people are thou of and he said unto them i am a hebrew and i fear the lord and the god of heaven which hath made me made to see in the dry land then it goes back to the psalm that we just read then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why hast thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the lord because he had told them so these men are even though they're gentiles they're pretty smart when it comes to the the hebrew god they got the only god and then he goes on then they said on to them what shall we do then unto thee that the sea may become unto us for the sea rot and was tempest and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea become unto you for i know not for my sake this great thompson's upon him nevertheless the men rode hard to bring it to the land they and they could not for the sea rot with temptations against them what i'm trying to say these men wouldn't throw no or in the sea it tells you about their character and their integrity they didn't want to cast that man into the sea because they knew it would be death and it and in the end wherefore they cried unto the lord and said we beseech thee and in the end they had to do it i'm not saying that they didn't do it wherefore they cried on the lord say we beseech thee lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this man's life lay not upon us innocent blood for thou o lord has done as it pleased thee so they took up jonah and cast them forth into the sea and the sea ceased from its rage then the mere men feared the lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the lord and made vows no and then we all know what happened after that the lord made a great fish and we swallowed jonah but i was just i don't know i was just thinking this morning that's real character that's men being real men doing what men should do and that's protect each other until the uttermost end and then sometimes that's lacking in the world that we have right now there's you know i was just thinking in the world you live no matter who you are or what you are you you know brother adam said jesus said everyone says as a christian you should treat people like you want to be treated it doesn't make a difference whether they're a pagan a christian it doesn't make a difference you should treat people like you need to be like you expected to be treated you could shouldn't expect something out of someone else that you wouldn't do yourself and that's where we're at in the world people expect other people to do things for them that they wouldn't be willing to do for other people and i don't know why i'm saying this but that's in i was also listening to a message this morning and i'm not i'm totally off my point which i do a lot but i was you know that message that brother brown preached on identification where you have to identify with your sacrifice so everything we do what christian you're identified with jesus christ everything we do is identified without sacrifices in jesus christ and that's our hope and that identification should choke forth in our life for who we are and what we are this morning you know and in the natural sense i guess we're all americans but in the spiritual sense we're all christians you know brother brown said as an american you've got to identify with the good and the bad and as a christian sometimes you've got to identify with the bad things that happen and the good things that happen you know no one gets out of this life without struggle so our only hope is in jesus christ this morning and i'm totally uh off my point but i'll just read this i was thinking this morning i don't know if you all remember i've got one of those kind of memories it was like i forget what year it was 1994 1995 but i'll just read a few of these scriptures here do we begin to commend this is the third chapter of second corinthians i know i do that a lot some things never change but we'll start this verse first do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of condemnation to you or letters of commendation from you and we are epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men so we are epistles so god has wrote a tablet he's writing on your heart right now this morning and you're in a position where god is leading you and writing on your heart putting his love in you putting his desires in you this morning can we always see on the outside what god is doing for you or for me no but god is working on the inside and he goes on to say for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with spirit of the living god and not in the tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart so everything that god does for us is in the is to the inner man and then from the inner man everything reflects out the world's got it opposite they got you changing the outside hoping the inside will change with it but actually the real christian experience is the other way around god has to start on the inside and it has to work its way on the outside and he goes as such trust we have through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as ourselves but our sufficiencies of god who has also made as able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and like brother thomas mentioned on wednesday like brother parrish was praying that spirit the holy ghost itself has got to have control over everything what made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life but if but if the ministration of death written engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not steadfast behold the face of moses for the glory of his continents which glory was to be done away with how shall not the ministers of the spirit be rather glorious for if the administration i'm going to stop there i'm not going to read this whole chapter but my simple point this morning not wanting to take a long time every one of us has a responsibility to be that person that god wants us to be and then every one of us has got to get to a position where we let god work in our hearts and lives bring us into that place that we're supposed to be you know i was just thinking this morning i said i don't i'm not going to say it again but and where you're at this morning with jesus christ you've as as i get older i i know for myself i gotta stay you gotta i was just listening to brother brown this morning the closer you get the better off you are the further off you get the worse you are that's the thing about the you've got to stay close to the lord in every day of your life if you let anything get between you and him that's when you start having problems so may god bless you all brother david hey you love him with all of your heart let's stand and sing that little course i love you

wrote here in my arms this morning another one he said a lot of young people say well we can't have children we'll wait until we get a little later on and so forth he says just as god sends and them because they are the tithe that binds the hearts and the homes together the children they are the time of the times each of you mothers and fathers and your brother says that grandparents are offering

appreciate them amen we appreciate the lord this morning amen how many appreciates him this morning hey man he's good to us isn't he amen he's more better to us than we actually deserve amen but it's his amazing grace that we're all here this morning and i appreciate that hey man i'm just thinking about just the looking around and you know seeing everybody and just a good group of people this morning and i was thinking you know we're just just trying to hold you too long but i'm just thinking this morning about just uh what they are that we're living in i tell you what it's a not a ton to play games but it's time to get serious with the lord amen and just you know just been looking at that message how can i overcome and brother brown said we are to live in the spirit of revival every day amen he said one place he made mentions that how did i get closer to the lord amen he said read your bible and pray every day so surely we need to do that amen and i tell you what it satan he's always trying to make it hard you know man try to always put things there before us and but if we can just crucify that and just crucify this old flesh and say god i need a closer walk with you every day amen that's what i want because we're living in our brothers and sisters it seems like anymore you preach the word of god and don't stir people too much anymore amen i mean you you don't see people crying out to god like they used to but i say god help me help me to cry out to you more than i ever cried out to you because i i surely do need him amen in this hour that we're living in amen so how many's got a need this morning amen let's just buy our heads and look to him in prayer heavenly father lord we love you this morning we appreciate you this morning we thank you so much for your goodness and your mercy to us lord this morning and father we realize lord that it is truly amazing grace lord how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like us we once was lost but now we're found we were blind blinded to your word lord but you came along and put eye salve in our eyes that we can see father we want to just want to say we thank you this morning lord you saw the hands lord you know what was behind each and every hand before it was raised father i pray lord that you just meet each and every need father this morning whether it be financial physical spiritual lord just meet every need lord father lord we know we all need a closer walk with you father so i pray lord that you'd help each and every one of us this morning to get that closer list that we need to your father i pray oh god that you just help us this morning lord father i'm just a man i don't know what each and these people have need of father but you do lord jesus and lord you may help me you may help me go off my notes just to speak to one person father lord i remember so well lord the prophet preaching lord on the film deep calls to the deep lord and he backs up he said you sitting there sir you were praying said lord have that man speak to me father you're still the same yesterday today and forever father and lord you can do it to this morning father just like he did then make me leave my notes and speak to one person because they were praying father granted lord this morning father help us lord in every situation that we have meet up father lord i pray lord did you just touch the and heal the sick lord save the lost and fill all with the holy ghost father and lord when we leave this building this morning we can say like they did on the road to emanus did not our hearts burn within us as you talk with us along the way and we'll be careful to give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it all in jesus name amen amen if you have your bibles this morning turn with us to the book of acts the 11th chapter i was thinking looking back there and just kind of studying and kind of looking at some things last night just and that brother whoever was that was teaching the little sun sunday school lesson and didn't know what i was going to preach i probably didn't even know i was here amen and so we just appreciate brother byler having us while he's away so we appreciate that so you just pray with us and just a little simple thought but anyway i'm just thinking about that this morning as he was up here talking about and what i want to preach on this morning so you just pray for us acts 11 verse 26 and says and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in antioch may the lord add his blessings to the re word you may be seated i want to read a thought or a quote to you this morning and it was where i want to draw my thoughts from this morning brother brown makes a statement in israel in the homeland in 1953 he said now notice he condemned moses because moses glorified himself you know you remember this in a scripture that moses he was supposed to speak to the rock and he smoked the rock he said condemn moses and you just watched today he said these big churches they're all wanting you to come to their church in their organization and every preacher is falling to try to get a feather in his hat he will go along and say well i might be the district christopher i might be this that or the other now listen what he says brother i want to be a christian that's what men and women need is christ i want to preach on that this morning to be a christian to be a christian that's what he said he said brother i want to be a christian and as that brother was speaking this morning in the sunday school he was telling about you know when i heard a brother preach he said what if christ was in your skin when you go places on the job different places do they see christ in you and i know people today such a it seems like it's such a hard road you know it's just a struggle but i wonder if people see christ in us how many people aggravate us you're driving on the road they cut you off they aggravate you or do they see christ in us i've had to apologize a lot of times well i like that state he said brother i want to be a christian now uh i googled this i i looked up the word christian i googled it then i had it because google you know is always right and then also i i i i got this bible dictionary at home and looked up the definition of a christian but let here's what google said said christian is it an inherent a follower of christ so if we're a christian this morning i'm an inherit or i'm a follower of christ this morning if i'm a christian if you're a christian this morning you're a follower of christ i want to be a christian this morning because i want to follow christ that's the only way that i'm going to get into rapture is follow him because he is the word for the hour that we're living in so christian isn't a heart or follower of christ a faithful supporter all we might support a lot of things amen but if we're a christian this morning we're going to support the cause of christ amen whatever it is we're going to support the cause of christ i you know y'all was talking about your missionary funds and everything i think that's what that's great amen every church ought to be missionary minded amen brother branson we need to watch what we support but a christian said is a faithful support a faithful supporter sticking fast amen i want to stick fast to christ this morning i don't want to let him get out of my sight this morning amen another uh the definition was clinging my head i want to cling to him as much as i can amen you remember when he was here on earth and he began to teach you know he had three phases he had the first or the second poll then they opened another word and when he began to preach amen that me my father are one except you eat to my flesh and drink my blood the bible says they turn and walk with them no more amen and he looked around at the 12 that were left and said where you go also they said to whom shall we go seeing thou has the words of eternal life i say this morning if we're a christian where else are we going to go see that he has the words of eternal life this morning amen so i want to cling to him this is one who professes believe in the teachings of jesus christ so if you're a christian this morning you're a professor of the belief in the teachings of this bible of christ says a christian it's someone whose behavior and heart reflects jesus christ hallelujah god i've seen god help me this morning i'm saying lord help me wherever i go whatever i do amen let me be let me my behavior be like what you would want it to be lord help my behavior help my help my behavior and my heart to reflect you lord amen i want to reflect him so much amen i wouldn't people see me i want them to see christ in me is that what your desire is is that what your prayer is this morning that they'll see christ in you hallelujah there's a critic someone who's hard behavior i thought about that i just looked at that i thought god what about i believe it's inventory taking time it's checking up time we need to find out where we're standing in this late hour that we're living in and i sure want my behavior and heart to reflect jesus christ it's his followers of jesus were first called christians at antioch we read that they were called christians because their speech and behavior was like christ they were called christians because we remember in the in the scripture where peter you know he was warming himself by the fire and they came and said hey do you know him and he died him and they said hey you're one of them we seen you and he denied him and one of them said hey we know you're one of his because your speech betrays you i wonder this morning the people in the world and not only that but people sitting around us this morning and recognize us being a christian because our speech and our behavior are like his that's something to think about amen oh you say well you say you're a christian i want to be a christian brother said to be like a christian means to be like christ can i read you something preach this message remember the lord amen i thought this was real good so i'll just read this to you real quickly he said here a few months ago i was out to the hospital to pray for a woman in our city in indiana and there was a little lady laying there wanting to get right with god she being she was a backslider she once come to my church and she went back out and of course seven devils entered worse than they ever was and there she's trying laying in the hospital or dying she said brother random i don't want to die like this and i said all right sister you don't have to if you still got a desire in your heart to serve god oh god help us this morning he said you don't have to if you still got to desire in your heart to serve god i wonder this morning how many in here this building this morning as a desire to serve god this morning amen he said he said to serve god he'll never he's never left you you left him but he never left you then you can't if you can't and she said now i want to brother branham i said all right we'll pray there's another lady laying there with her lips down looking at me with a like she could run through me her son she was laying on the bed going to an operation the day before and i said and i seen her there and her son looking over at me and i said do you mind if we have a word of prayer she said pull that curtain i said well are you a believer she said i said pull back curtain i said i just actually said i'll give you to understand we're methodist i said well that certainly expresses it then what it was see she didn't want to see some other person that bore backslidden one and come back to god that she'd been a methodist it'd been different you see didn't we didn't remember jesus there she just remembered her creed just remember all right oh what a horrible thing it'd be in the day of judgment she said i have you to know i'm a methodist brother didn't say that she said are you a believer i mean i'm asking you this morning are you a christian you say well i'll follow the message i didn't ask you that i said are you a christian this morning [Music] amen he goes a few weeks ago i was riding in the elder elevator in louisville i was going up for an examination a physical examination to a doctor friend of mine to get a pass i would wanted to go over seasonal brother uh roland and right away outside i take my physical while i was had a chance and i went up that there was some men with us going up on the floor we went up about eight floors in louisville at a building and the hayburn building and when i was up almost about as high as she could go to stop one of these fellas was drinking a little i think he looked around so well boys i guess this is as high as we'll ever get so we better get off i never said nothing he didn't know i was a preacher so i just waited to get up i said just a minute that remark you made i said if you're trusting in our own merits this is as high as we'll ever get but i said if we're trusting jesus remember him hey man that's what i want to do he said that's about as high as you can get if you're trusted in your marriage but i ain't trusting in my marriage this morning my marriage won't get me nowhere my marriage will find me in hell but i want to trust in his marriage this morning trust in his grace this morning amazing grace how sweet the sound i want to trust in his grace this morning hallelujah see we can go higher when we pass this brother outlaw singer the other night jupiter venus neptune and mars the milky way and go on and on and on there's no difference beyond every solar system into the heavens of the heavens i'm glad for that just remember that he went on and above such things as that yes if we're trusting our marriage we're certainly lost but we trusted in his marriage we're saved i want to trust in his marriage this morning amen that's what i want to trust in amen if you're a christian this morning hey man how many wants to be a christian i remember the prophet of god said it like this he said one time i read in the bible he said i read a book called the lone ranger he said i got a broomstick around there my mama's old broomstick and rode around the house like a horse cause i wanted to be the wrong ranger then he said he read about tarzan said he got a you know kind of a rug and wrapped around him and everything slapped out in the tree for about a week because he wanted to be like tarzan but then he said one day i picked up this book called the bible and it read about christ amen and ever since then i wanted to be like him amen that's what i want to be like this morning i want to be like him this morning so if you just take this bible read the gospels about the life of christ if you take away the duplications and everything somebody said it's about 50 pages that ain't much we can look at other things but what about this so i googled something i wanted to see something i googled this he said to read in the google sense to read the book of matthew the brother said we don't read the bible like a newspaper to read the book of matthew it takes about an hour and 14 minutes to read the book of mark 46 minutes to read the book of luke an hour and 18 minutes to read the book of saint john an hour and three minutes that's four hours and 21 minutes but that's not much now i'm going to get be alright my step on some toes this morning we'll sit around and watch a dvd or something like that for four hours what about read the bible amen and we won't even get up to go to the restroom cause we're afraid we may miss something but when the holy spirit's moving and the preachers preaching the pastor whoever it may be you watch them doors back and forth back and forth brother in our we ought to be ashamed of ourselves holly preach on preacher amen now to read the book of mark and said it like this it's about a quarter of nfl football maybe we should be watching that you make them your example amen i want to make god my example i want to see something in the bible that trusted in god and make them my example to read the book of john it says it's about watching commercials in four hours of cable tv we ain't supposed to have one the book of matthew is as an average span of four major league baseball innings the brother said something about going in extra innings amen to read the book of matthews is an average span of four major lead league baseball innings and to read the book of luke one half of an nba playoff game amen so we can watch these things and do these things but what about the things that is most important in life the things that get us out of here in the rapture what about picking up a book amen and reading it what about listening to a tape when's the last time you picked up a message book and read it when's the last time you listened to a tape help us lord just to be a christian is where i want to be [Applause] oh hallelujah amen can i read this check

sisters i just read how can i overcome greater he that's in you than he that's in the world and how that god overcome he overcame by the word amen amen when satan amen when satan came into he said it is written hallelujah amen so he said the christian that's not one word in the world he said they should be the most freest happiest people amen the most freest and happiest people in the world amen

word of god and i can't lose with what i use hey man hallelujah he says so he said all things work together for the good to them that love god he said so how can we lose there's just nothing to lose

holy ghost gospel is nothing but one great big powerhouse of joy amen i got joy this morning i got freedom in the holy ghost this morning amen freedom walk and raise my hands freedom to shout freedom to death hallelujah i got it this morning hallelujah hey man hallelujah he said the holy ghost gospel is the perfect intoxication for every man what's got the blues you got the blues this morning we

the holy ghost you're you you drunk until you leave this world hey amen hallelujah joy unspeakable and full of glory amen and the half has not been told amen drunk until you leave this world drunk on the things of god that's what i want to be drunk on this morning not on the things of the world but on the things of god if i could just get drunk on the things of god this morning amen it may make me talk in another language amen it may make me shout whatever it is amen it may make you raise your hands and say god i love you god i appreciate you this morning it should take them to get on them keys and tickle them ivories in order for us to worship god we're going to just lift our hands and say god i love you this morning i appreciate you this morning i thank you for your goodness and your mercy if it wasn't for your grace i wouldn't be here this morning but it's blessed alone being the greatest message ever struck the face of the earth some years ago probably about 20 25 30 years ago there's a guy by the name of tim lahaye put out some books about being left behind you know what he was writing them books for getting people ready they were going to be left behind but god sent me a message that i won't have to be left behind thank god and like the brother said i think it was brother david wade said this morning amen said you're chosen hey amen god didn't have to choose you luke just think about who you are this morning you might not be the greatest he said he wasn't the greatest singer but god still chose you thank god god amen amen out of the millions and millions of millions of people on the face of the earth this morning we're just a handful and he chose me thank you lord oh that makes me happy this morning that makes me have joy this morning that he chose me amen thank you jesus glory to god hallelujah he said you joy and speakable full of glory there's a constant stimulation it's a constant intoxication drunk day and night amen he said that's the word of god hallelujah thank you lord he said that's the word of god drunk day and night amen fully intoxicated on the things of the world hey man they want to tell me ask me said you've been vaccinated i've got inoculated all right hey man hallelujah and it had been inoculated by the holy ghost amen and it'll keep all the evil away from me and keep all the bad spirits away from me amen if i get once inoculated with the holy ghost amen it made me want to come to church it made me want to worship god it made me want to lift my hands and say glory to god it'll make me want to hey man it made me want to just be a christian hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord i remember king agrippa now i get these men did these other two messed up mixed up because one of they're both names beginning with f festus and felix and one of them told paul and paul much learning's made you mad he said i'm not mad hey man but i'm just telling you what god spoke to my heart to tell you one when the other guy whichever one it was one the other one said hey listen paul when there's a more convenient season i'll call for you we never find in the scripture that it was more convenient season today is the day of salvation king agrippa said paul you almost persuaded me to be a christian almost almost they tell me only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades i don't want to almost be a christian i want to be a christian hey amen i want to be a christian amen this morning says jehovah gyra amen 1962. he said a man may look like a christian he may act like a christian he might impersonate a christian but unless he's got that german life in there he cannot rise again got to have that life germ in there have eternal life god i pray lord that you give each and every one of us eternal life and if you ever had it it was always there [Music] it just took something to spark it amen hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah thank you for your word lord thank you for your goodness now let that now listen this is how the bible dictionary that i have at home it's a christian and then hearing of christ look at that a faithful supporter follower clinging it's in the word occurs three times in the new testament the disciples were first called christian in any acts 11 26. peter exalted if anyone suffers as a christian let him not be ashamed first peter 4 16. yet if any man suffers christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf in each instance the word christian uh assumes that the person called by that name was a follower of christ christians were loyal to christ just as the herodians were loyal to herod matthew 22 16 and they sent out their disciples with herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teach us the way of god and truth neither cares for thou for any man for thou regardless not the person of man mark 3 6 and the pharisees went forth straightway to counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy them and then the same book mark the 12th chapter 13 birth and they sent unto him certain of the pharisees of the her and of the herodians to catch him in his words what were they doing they were trying to trap him in his words oh if i can just be like he was this morning brother david they came to him one time and said hey we want to know something by what authority do you do these things is it all right let me ask you a question john the baptist baptism was it of man or was it of god and they said we got a counsel just for a little bit and they got their group together they said now listen if we say it's a man they'll stone us because they all consider him to be a prophet but if we say this of god hillary asked us why don't we believe them so you know what they'd asked him or you know what they told him say we can't answer you he said neither can i answer you either oh i like that oh brother david let me be a christian let me to have his spirit in me so i know how to answer when i need to answer know how to keep my mouth shut when i need to keep my mouth shut amen oh god that's what oh god help me help me lord that's what god help me to be that way lord let you be my example lord hallelujah i believe there is something that takes place in a believer a person's heart when they become a christian hallelujah let me have a city like this of kinsmen redeemer he said when you take that that detect uh on that name of christian you represent christ in his church i tell people when i go home away from home brother homer longoria is my pastor awaiting them knowing a lot of you know them wrong homer said if i don't know them i may know their grandpa's or their great grandpas homer been around a long time anyway and so when i go somewhere i represent my church back home i represent my pastor back home amen remember when we're a christian you take on that name of christ like when you go away you're a businessman or something or you're in a uh what they call it a uh associate or somebody ambassador for your country what are you representing you're representing america if you're in a bad or whatever if you're work for a company and you go travel you represent that company amen he said when you're a christian he said you take them that name you represent christ and his church he said you should live like gentlemen like ladies don't never do the things of the world because the whole eyes of heaven and earth is cast on you to represent that one thing no matter how weak you are how little you are hold your head right because you're a christian amen i want to hold my head right this morning why because i'm a christian hallelujah ii timothy 3 12 says it like this all that live golly in christ jesus shall a child suffer persecution amen if i confess to be a christian and profess that his spirit is upon me to do as he did would it not produce the same thing that he did when he was here on earth this is what the prophet of god said he said it like this if the spirit of john dillinger was on the in me he said i'll be dangerous to be around i'd be packing guns and shoot somebody he said the spirit of our artist was in me he said i'll paint you the prettiest picture that there was and the spirit of a mechanic was in me he said you think i'd know about your car and what was wrong with your car but he said what about the spirit of christ being in me and i love like christ i'll act like christ i'll go where he would want me to go i wouldn't go where he would not want me to go hallelujah we're either a christian or sinner there's no halfway this morning we're going to be in his likeness our lives should pattern after the word of god amen i want my life to pattern after his amen oh help me lord help my life to be like yours lord amen this is what he says again on another message redemption by power 1954 to be christ-like go no place you wouldn't want to be if christ would come i think they sung that song would you be able to reach your hand out to him or would you have to beg forgiveness you know god knows what he wanted to have this morning none of these brothers knew i was going to be here i didn't know what they was going to say i didn't know what he was going to sing i didn't know that baby is going to get dedicated but god knew he knows how to orchestrate oh he's a good orchestrator hallelujah what an orchestrator he is amen he's so much of an orchestrator that he said to abraham said your children should children in a strange land for 400 years but i'll bring them out with a mighty hand and they wasn't even over there yet but god orchestrated it because of a famine they got over there and then pharaoh rose up they did not know joseph didn't get persecute him amen but god knew oh hallelujah what an orchestrator he is amen oh thank god amen go no place you wouldn't want to be if christ would come say nothing you wouldn't want to be saying when christ comes now all right one thing and help me lord facebook people want to get out on facebook air out their dirty laundry people want to do things that the prophet god said and preached against but once you put it on facebook it becomes public domain and i have a right to say something against it even before then if the prophet said it i still have a right to say something against it to be a christian you want to go nowhere where christ wouldn't want to be say anything that christ wouldn't want you to say when he comes help me lord lord he said christ come doing nothing that you wouldn't want to be doing when christ comes think nothing you wouldn't want to be thinking when christ comes keep your one motive your heart centered on calvary help me lord brother had a cross hanging in this car he's like why he said why he had it hey man then we see women walk down that way they you can't hardly turn your head anymore young brothers you're young young men you can't keep your eyes centered on calvary hallelujah but my brother said i just read it how can i overcome it's in my in my briefcase you want to look at it the other man said he was tempted by women so he could be a faithful high priest suffer and be tempted like we are so he can know what we went through thank you lord keep your one motive your heart sitting on calvary amen walk in the light as he is in the light and we have fellowship one with another the blood of jesus christ god's son cleanses us from all in righteousness that's another this baptist all of us together makes us all one in him thank you lord hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord god thank you jesus oh no reward i still didn't want to be a christian and there was no promise of uh matching on the hilltop no promises i still want to be this way because it's the best way what we need to do is unpack he said brother branham i already said brother david what do you mean by that i'm glad you asked but branson said it like this 1954 everlasting life and how to respect he said what's the matter with a lot of people today is they're trying to pack up to be a christian he said we need to do some unpacking we want to put the mama i can't go because the boys want me to bring my card table along so we pat that on the camel we'll pack back biting on the camel we'll pack this on the camel and the camel's so matched down he says and he's so boldly he can't hardly walk he said what we need to do is do some unpacking god help me to impact me this morning whatever's in my way lord help me start anything contrary in my life that's not like your word unpack me this morning let me get rid of it this morning i got something i got i got some things i gotta get rid of you got some things you got to do amen thank you lord hallelujah oh thank you jesus amen now listen again that bible dictionary he said the designation of the early father of christ this christian was initiated by the non-christian population for antioch originally it was a term of derision an object of ridicule like they call you holy roller brother bram said i've never seen a holy roller but if they call me an unholy ruler then there must be unholy rulers is that it's an object of ridicule or scorn eventually however christians used it of themselves as a name of honor and not a shame prior to their adoption of the name the christians call themselves believers acts 5 14 and believers were then more added to the lord multitudes both men and women call themselves brothers acts 6 6 3 wherefore the brethren look you out among you seven men of honest report for the holy ghost and wisdom point over this business our saints acts 9 13 18. these names answered these names the 99 has answered lord i have heard of this man how much he had done of the saints at jerusalem names that also continue to be used in modern terms the name christian what emptied of its meaning as a follower of christ like the lady said that i read i have you know i'm a methodist he said it it means said to some today christian means little more than an european or american who is not jewish while others have sought to make its proper use the name of a particular denomination however its original meaning is a noble one of which any follower of christ can be rightly proud i can be proud because i'm a christian this morning amen god's obligated to his word if i'm professed to be a christian he's obligated his word he's not obligated to me it's not but he's obligated his word amen if he said he'd heal yeah then he's obligated his word amen the lord's supper how many remembers the lord's supper how do you you know how that uh that pain originated how many knows how that painting originated good i'll read it to you so this is a replica of leonardo da vinci's of the last supper the famous masterpiece took over seven years to paint the interesting story behind the painting is this da vinci felt that he should use living persons as models since this was to be such an important picture he started with the painting of christ hundreds of young men were studied to find a man whose face portrayed innocent and beauty after long search he found a man whom he felt could portray christ the painting of christ took six months when christ was completed eventually worked for six years making the disciples all were completed but one that one was judas to find someone whom the events he thought looked like judas was a problem after a long discouraging search davinci heard of a man in prison at rome who was sentenced to die for his brutal crimes leonardo went to rome as as a prisoner was brought before him he saw a man with an ugly vicious face scarred and full of hate he knew immediately that this was a man he wanted to represent judas the savior's betrayer by special permission from the king the prisoner was brought to milan to pose for da vinci for six months he sent for da vinci and appointed ours finally the gifted artist finished his painting as a guard breaking the person away he broke loose rushing to leonardo's side he gasped it gaps look at me do you not know who i am with his sharp christian eyes and eventually looked at the man and said no i do not know you i never saw you until you were brought before me in rome then the pressure lifted his head toward heaven and cried oh god have i fallen so low then he turns to davinci said leonardo da vinci look at me again i'm the same man you painted only seven years ago as a figure of christ but brandon says it's like this um uh 1953 diamond democracy immunology religious realm it said it took 10 years for that man he said it don't even take 10 years just 10 minutes away from christ just 10 minutes away from christ and you'll never know where you end up at invention in the usa brother brown 1954 brother and says like this you never know where to stand a man that's unstable like that or a person that's professes to be a christian and that unstable you don't know what to do about that person today they're a christian tomorrow you don't know where they're at in church today they're rejoicing and singing and praising god and tomorrow out drinking corrosion around that type of a person is hard to do anything with god deliver me this morning if you give that your book didn't say god deliver me so i want to be a christian you know the church don't say this church it don't save you it only helps you maintain what you got amen i believe we need to do some maintaining around the church then i need to do some maintaining amen how do you maintain it start feeding it you remember that chief that brother talked about like a black dog white dog fighting he said well chief which one wins the most he said the one i feed the most what do you feed on during the week that wednesday night service sunday mornings but during them times what do you feed on lord help me help me lord i need you more the church helps you remain a christian it's not packing an image but it's being a limited image don't let me be a living image a walking example i want to be a christian remember i said churches have become prostitutes by giving out wrong doctrine oh god help us a christian before he can really call himself a christian has to meet god face to face and know where he stands god help me this morning if you're here this morning and you really ain't a christian then you've got to meet god face to face and really know where you stand at this morning because the scripture says the bible says that everything that can be shaken will be shaken and brother it's a second time it's a scary time but he had a glorious time for this bride because we know that we're fixing to be out of here thank you lord hallelujah right around like this i feel like running i'll be like jumping and screaming and something that's how i feel like running jumping screaming hallelujah that's how i feel sometimes hey man let me read this to you hey man he said now listen he said he said on greater than solomon is here 1963. he said the church needs to know not to solve hybrid something soft and family like the church is just make a confession be baptized and you're a christian is it not something soft and flabby just to be baptized and you're christian me my wife was walked uh driving down the road uh it's been several years now and they had it and i got xm you know satellite radio in my car so i turned it over there joel osteen you know he's always smiling he's that kind of guy brother wallace that you can whip him every day and take his lunch money away from him he looks like the kind of you know anyway he said repeat he on that right he's a repeat after me and he's supposed to repeat that to him he said all right now you're a christian i looked at my wife as what you think she goes i kind of doubt it said i do too to not be baptized be flabby soft flabby he said to be a christian or self-denial they had to deny themselves he said something i'll deny yourself take up your cross and follow me back then to be a christian death i believe it does the same thing today only spiritual separation from the things of the world but we don't want to take up our cross do we we always want it easy it reminds me of this little story this guy was complaining about his cross that he was carrying and he said god i'm tired of carrying my cross i said i want another cross that i can carry this one's i'm just tired of it he said all right there's three crosses make your choice so he picked up the other one he goes oh those splinters uh i don't want this one too many splinters so he picked up this other second one he said man i can't i don't want this one i can't lift it so he picked up this other one he said man this fits just right no splinters ain't too heavy the lord said that's been your cross all along see what you go through i might not be able to go through and what i go through you might not be able to go through but every one of us has a cross and one of us and everyone has to deny ourselves he said deny yourself take up your cross follow me today it's so soft when people call themselves christian when it used to mean death to confess christ and you had to depend on him daily for everything you had need of brother it's getting to that time it's getting to that spot hey man that we've got to depend on him once again but we had to depend on him all along but like i was saying you know the doctors seem like they don't know nothing anymore what's wrong i don't know well i come to you you tell me which but that's why i come to you for you to tell me what was wrong they know i got to depend on god again he says jesus christ the same 1962 said he just looked like an ordinary jew he was dressed like an ordinary man i don't believe you have to dress funny to be different to be a christian i don't believe you have to act funny i believe you just be a person just be a christian that's all nothing peculiar it's just something inside of you has took place you see happiness joy and peace and satisfaction and long suffering gentleness peace people can talk about you it don't bother you a bit see that's the fruits of the spirit hallelujah and the fruits of the spirit if you want to turn to it galatians chapter 5 and verse to uh 20 uh 22 but the by the fruit of the spirit but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith maintenance temperance against such there is no law and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with affections and lust he said that's the fruits of the spirit love joy peace long suffering goodness maintenance temperance is it against such there is no law amen and they that are christ have crucified their self in the lust the flesh paul said i gotta die daily if he had to die daily what about me and you brothers and sisters amen all brothers and sisters it's like this a lot of us was mixed up in a marriage some of us a lot of us did this and this i heard some of the old timers by the way you probably heard it too many one was going to hear and preach marriage and divorce and they told their wives whatever he says that's what we'll do but you know what he said he said go and do it no more teach your children not to do it no more what was it grace grace somebody was trying to brother wade somebody was trying to chase their family tree you know that started here some maybe fifteen twenty everybody wanted to trace their roots some person told me he said man i started and i and i had to quit i didn't want to go back no further but you look at the life you look at the you go back and you trust the genealogy of christ tamar ray had the harlot we call ruth moabite you know where she come from incest but grace grace when they came to him and threw that woman down at his feet said she's been caught in the very act of adultery moses law said she ought to be stoned what about you what do you say the bible says he stooped down hallelujah didn't say a word just begin to rot in the sand when i couldn't come to where he was he came to me he stooped down they threw their stones away she rose up grace hallelujah grace hey man in the seal book brother brandon said like this live just live a simple christian life hallelujah christ was a very expression of god i mean you brothers and sisters it's the bride of christ we're supposed to be the very expression of christ i just want to be a christian like brother brown said can i read you two more things and we'll get out of here unveiling my god 1964. brother wade i think might have been mentioned like this or somebody did he said i'll notice how many american citizens is in here huh he said raise up
