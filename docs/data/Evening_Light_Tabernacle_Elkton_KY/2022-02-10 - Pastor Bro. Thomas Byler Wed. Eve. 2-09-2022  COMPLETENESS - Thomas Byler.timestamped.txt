[44:34] lord jesus and ask you to just help us
[44:37] and inspire us and bring out the thought
[44:39] of it lord jesus for we know it takes
[44:41] you to truly to open that word to us we
[44:43] ask god the justice bless meditation of
[44:45] our heart lord
[44:47] that which we feel lord you've laid upon
[44:49] our hearts to speak for a little bit
[44:51] this morning i mean this evening lord
[44:53] and we just ask god you'd be with all
[44:55] those out there lord father on
[44:58] watching tonight that you just blessed
[44:59] them in a special way we do thank you
[45:01] lord jesus for sparing brother glenn
[45:03] lord and
[45:04] lord let him have us have him for a
[45:06] little while longer lord we pray god
[45:08] you'll give him long life
[45:10] lord as he serves you and his wife and
[45:12] his family and everyone we ask god now
[45:14] that you'll just bless the reading of
[45:16] the word in jesus christ's name amen and
[45:18] amen turn your bibles if you will
[45:21] and we'll start with
[45:27] colossians 2
[45:30] colossians 2
[45:33] completion
[45:34] and when you talk about completion
[45:37] or fullness
[45:39] or perfection amen
[45:42] amen
[45:45] amen so
[45:47] colossians 2 and we'll read
[45:52] verse 9 and 10.
[45:59] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[46:02] the godhead bodily
[46:05] and ye are complete
[46:07] in him
[46:08] which is the head of all principality
[46:11] and power may god had his blessings to
[46:13] the reading of the words you can be
[46:15] seated
[46:16] now i want to read a quote that i read a
[46:18] couple weeks ago that my mind went back
[46:20] to it after i began to study this
[46:23] and think about it and i realized that
[46:25] it certainly ties in with what we've
[46:27] been speaking about amen
[46:30] and they're talking about completion or
[46:33] being complete being complete amen
[46:36] amen
[46:38] now brother batman makes a statement he
[46:40] says it's just like you if you are a
[46:42] christian
[46:43] god don't make halfway christians god
[46:45] makes complete christians amen
[46:48] uh you know but we might rephrase that
[46:50] tonight
[46:51] [Music]
[46:52] and say that god brings christians
[46:56] amen
[46:57] god brings us to completion
[47:00] amen
[47:02] because god is working on us isn't he
[47:05] and he knows where every one of us is
[47:07] and let me just challenge you in the
[47:09] opening of the service here
[47:11] challenge you a little bit to go in your
[47:13] mind and ask
[47:15] if god is looking at you
[47:18] where do you think that god sees you as
[47:21] being
[47:22] in reference to completion
[47:26] amen isn't that a good question to ask
[47:28] ourselves where am i with god if he's
[47:31] trying to complete me but it's even good
[47:33] god bless you i know you've had that
[47:35] stuff too amen so god bless you good to
[47:37] see you tonight amen glad you're feeling
[47:39] better also my boys had it it certainly
[47:41] has been going around but hopefully it's
[47:43] starting to diminish now amen so praise
[47:46] the lord
[47:48] in reference to completion you look at
[47:50] yourself and say lord where i am amen
[47:53] now i just took quite a few different
[47:55] scriptures that i want to try to
[47:59] refer to in different
[48:00] perhaps
[48:02] scenarios that
[48:03] paul talked about jesus talked about
[48:06] uh you know in reference to being
[48:09] complete amen
[48:12] in uh ephesians 4 will be our next
[48:14] scripture let's go to ephesians 4.
[48:18] excuse me
[48:24] and remember when i talk about
[48:25] completion i also mean in a way of
[48:28] perfection amen
[48:30] you know whenever everything's when you
[48:32] complete something it's in the place
[48:34] that it should be it should be at a
[48:36] place of perfection amen and that's not
[48:39] what god's working on us isn't he amen
[48:42] and so i look at myself and i say lord
[48:43] where am i amen
[48:46] and you know i was just went through my
[48:48] mind lord if i live another 15 years 20
[48:51] years no matter how long i live my
[48:53] heart's desire i trust it's yours too
[48:56] and that is lord teach me
[48:58] your ways
[49:00] how many loves to learn things in the
[49:01] spiritual realm
[49:03] spiritually i love the lord to teach me
[49:05] stuff
[49:06] i hope you do too you love for god to
[49:08] show you things to teach you things
[49:12] amen it causes you to continue to grow
[49:15] amen
[49:16] and so let's read this here you know
[49:20] it says
[49:21] that when he ascended and so forth he
[49:23] also descended in verse 11 of chapter
[49:26] four it says and he gave some apostles
[49:28] some prophets and some evangelists and
[49:31] some pastors and teachers
[49:34] for the perfecting of the saints
[49:37] right
[49:39] how many of these that's god's god too
[49:40] it come and it taught us into the
[49:42] causing us to be completely in him
[49:44] complete in him perfect perfect in him
[49:48] amen
[49:50] oh my
[49:53] so he says the perfecting of the saints
[49:55] the work of the ministry for the
[49:57] edifying of the body of christ till we
[50:00] all come into the unity of the faith
[50:04] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[50:06] unto
[50:08] a perfect man
[50:13] unto a perfect man
[50:16] i mean that was probably god preached
[50:17] this a message called the stature of a
[50:20] perfect man
[50:21] and he used all those different things
[50:23] virtue and tempers we'll get into that
[50:25] here in peter because that's another
[50:27] illustration i want to use and talk on
[50:29] for a little bit so we're just certainly
[50:31] going to just hit the highlights of all
[50:33] these different things that we
[50:35] could take for a long time you know with
[50:37] the help of the spirit on it
[50:39] but it says you know unto it for unto e
[50:42] let me hold on where are we at unto a
[50:45] perfect man
[50:46] unto the measure and i don't truly
[50:49] completely understand this but it says
[50:52] unto the measure of the stature
[50:55] so there's a measure of a stature that
[50:57] god's looking for
[50:59] of the fullness of christ
[51:02] amen
[51:04] until the
[51:05] fullness of christ amen
[51:08] that he hands forth be no more children
[51:11] all right so now we understand where
[51:13] paul's going he's talking about growing
[51:15] up into him
[51:16] amen
[51:18] no more children but be adults
[51:21] and
[51:23] completely grown
[51:26] complete man complete women
[51:29] no more tossed to and fro and carried
[51:31] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[51:33] slightest man and coming craftiness
[51:36] whereby they lie in wait
[51:38] to deceive
[51:40] but speaking truth in love i don't know
[51:43] what's wrong my throat
[51:48] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[51:50] up into him in all things which is the
[51:54] head even christ
[51:56] from whom the whole body fitly
[52:00] fit left join together
[52:03] and compacted by that
[52:05] by that which every joint supplyeth
[52:08] according to the effects you are working
[52:10] in the measure of every part
[52:13] making increase of the body unto the
[52:15] edifying of itself and love so we
[52:18] realize that paul is actually talking
[52:19] about a body that is all fitly together
[52:22] every joint everything is in perfect
[52:25] harmony
[52:26] that right
[52:27] you know and i had to think you know
[52:29] because the devil wants you to be
[52:31] incomplete
[52:34] now
[52:36] you know uh unfinished or my might say
[52:39] deformed
[52:41] right
[52:42] deformity go back in the god of his evil
[52:45] age 1960 before i believe it is brother
[52:47] i'm talking about the power of
[52:48] transformation he talks about that if
[52:51] the devil has had 6 000 years to deform
[52:55] right or to pervert
[52:58] and he used the illustration of how that
[53:00] in a corn field whenever there's corn
[53:03] growing and so forth there's what they
[53:05] call those little creepers vines things
[53:07] that wrap themselves up around those
[53:09] those corn and so forth and amen if you
[53:12] let them grow they'll twist that corn
[53:14] sideways and they'll cause that corn to
[53:17] be deformed
[53:19] and you know every let me just say every
[53:21] imperfection in our life everything in
[53:24] our lives that's unlike christ is a what
[53:29] deformity
[53:31] right it's still a deformity
[53:36] amen
[53:37] and that's the devil's business is to
[53:40] make deformed christians you know and
[53:42] how many knows that over uh we we sing
[53:45] songs about you know when you get over
[53:46] there there's not going to be anybody
[53:49] deformed
[53:51] everybody will be perfect there's you
[53:52] know and it's not going to be any
[53:54] hunchback there's not going to be any
[53:56] people limping and
[53:58] and so forth you know because perhaps
[54:00] they get in their wreck or whatever
[54:02] they're lame and lame or whatever they
[54:04] just limp along limb along limp along or
[54:06] whatever there's not going to be any of
[54:07] that over there
[54:09] amen
[54:10] and god is trying to get us as
[54:13] christians not to just slip along but to
[54:16] walk uprightly
[54:18] are you with me
[54:19] to walk as a man amen and brother ben we
[54:22] all know he said you know there's a lot
[54:24] of men that are 200 pounds you know of
[54:26] muscle and oh boy they're strong as ox
[54:29] but he said but yet they don't have one
[54:31] ounce
[54:33] of man in them
[54:35] so manhood you can only gauge manhood by
[54:40] the word of god
[54:42] nobody believes that not by somebody's
[54:44] philosophy or how smart they are how
[54:46] many degrees in college they have the
[54:48] only way that you can truly be a man is
[54:50] to have the characteristics
[54:52] that's in this bible
[54:54] amen used to be that a man was a man of
[54:57] his word and all you have to do is say
[54:59] i'm gonna do this and what did they do
[55:01] they shook hands on it that was their
[55:02] contract
[55:04] because their word was their bond
[55:07] folks i'm here to tell you i believe in
[55:08] being like that but i would not do that
[55:10] with nobody around today
[55:13] because i know what it's like to be in
[55:14] business not at what feels like the
[55:16] people have come back and say well you
[55:18] said this and that the other and you
[55:19] don't never remember saying that
[55:21] then what are you going to do
[55:23] then you got to do all that because he
[55:25] said you said because you really want to
[55:26] be a man of your word
[55:28] so you all got to yeah nowadays there's
[55:30] people that won't be honest that way so
[55:32] it's very hard
[55:33] other than the contract or to have it
[55:35] written down
[55:37] amen i remember i was in the contract
[55:39] with the guy one time and then and he
[55:41] says well you said you would do this
[55:42] over that this that and the other i says
[55:45] read on your contract look on the paper
[55:47] the money and now he says this money
[55:49] that you're giving me to do this it's
[55:50] only to build so much but just to build
[55:52] it no extra
[55:54] he went back and looked at me was all
[55:56] done it was all good
[55:58] amen
[56:00] but anyway so think about it you know
[56:03] and man how many knows man used to be
[56:05] man
[56:06] i mean when i think about world war ii
[56:08] when i think about those soldiers when i
[56:10] think about even the civil war
[56:12] huh
[56:14] you know i've heard about a man that was
[56:16] uh you know one was on one side the
[56:18] other was on the other side and so forth
[56:19] and you know there was bitter bitter a
[56:21] lot of bitterness and so forth but they
[56:23] had so much
[56:25] effect that when one of them was going
[56:27] to their funeral and so forth it was
[56:29] cold it's raining and they told this man
[56:31] don't go because you're you'll you'll
[56:33] catch your death or whatever you know if
[56:35] you do and he went went anyway to that
[56:38] funeral and ended up dying
[56:42] why he has that much respect for one
[56:43] another
[56:45] amen how many knows that we have are
[56:48] facing a serious dilemma
[56:51] amen because the devil has had 6 000
[56:53] years to pervert and to deform
[56:56] and cause people not just to be
[56:58] incomplete but to go completely the
[57:01] other way
[57:03] i told my wife on the way to church you
[57:05] know if you want to see how deformed the
[57:07] world is look at these bodybuilders
[57:10] walking down through walmart
[57:12] in a little mini skirt tights on and uh
[57:15] makeup and look like a woman
[57:18] huh
[57:20] i don't advise anybody to watch it but i
[57:22] have on youtube people at walmart
[57:27] trust now some of y'all are laughing at
[57:30] you because you probably did and you
[57:32] find out real quick it's not something
[57:33] you really want to fill your mind with
[57:35] it's really bad folks
[57:38] yeah the way that people would rest to
[57:40] go to walmart you know it's just crazy
[57:43] it just shows you how perverted this
[57:46] world is
[57:48] how bad the devil is god
[57:50] god people all twisted up men and women
[57:54] alike
[57:57] and you know i had to think today i had
[57:59] to think of how that how that we we as a
[58:02] group here we're trying to uh not live
[58:05] below our
[58:06] god-given privileges are we we're trying
[58:09] to come up a little higher and live to
[58:11] where brother bam says we should live
[58:14] amen and not live down below all right
[58:17] our rights because you know because if
[58:19] you do amen it brings sadness
[58:22] it brings sorrow it brings depression if
[58:24] you're living way down there you don't
[58:25] have to live that way
[58:27] nobody here likes live a life of
[58:29] depression
[58:31] or fear or any of that and you don't
[58:34] have to
[58:36] or of uh uh you know of an area of your
[58:39] life that's not surrendered completely
[58:41] to your god
[58:42] we talk about being completely
[58:43] surrendered to god amen now we'll talk
[58:46] about completely being a man or a woman
[58:48] for the lord
[58:50] and you know i thought well we ought to
[58:52] we want to be we want to be the happiest
[58:54] people on the earth and i was thinking
[58:56] today i thought you know if we're the
[58:58] happiest people on the earth there's
[59:00] bound to go a lot more with that than
[59:03] just happiness
[59:07] right command if you've ever gotten to
[59:10] the place where you're the happiest
[59:11] place on the earth you have also got to
[59:13] have the most peace of anybody in there
[59:16] because you can't be right with god if
[59:18] you don't have the peace of god you know
[59:20] and so you've got the peace that passes
[59:22] all understanding
[59:25] how many knows you're gonna be full of
[59:28] something you'll be gonna be completely
[59:30] full of something
[59:34] amen and the bible wants you to
[59:36] experience fullness of joy
[59:40] you know there's a scripture here i mean
[59:42] go to it but he says that your joy may
[59:45] be full
[59:49] god wants his children happy
[59:54] he wants them to have joy unspeakable
[59:57] and full of glory peace that passes
[1:00:00] under that's full folks
[1:00:03] i mean completely full
[1:00:08] huh
[1:00:12] was it paul raider i guess it was when
[1:00:14] he was not
[1:00:16] he had so much the joy of the lord that
[1:00:18] was nothing to him
[1:00:20] you know and they come down there with
[1:00:22] the quartets and so forth and singing
[1:00:25] some slow gospel song it was a gospel
[1:00:27] song ain't nothing wrong with the gospel
[1:00:29] slow gospel song
[1:00:31] near
[1:00:33] my god
[1:00:34] maybe it was that one
[1:00:36] show you want me he said man get me some
[1:00:39] good give me some snappy i need there's
[1:00:41] not here he believed in happiness he
[1:00:43] believed enjoy yeah leave him being
[1:00:45] we'll stop he says she being sing me
[1:00:47] some snappy gospel song hold on she
[1:00:50] pulled back the shades and amen i'm
[1:00:52] going to a blissful let some gloom and
[1:00:55] spooky place
[1:00:57] i'm going where the angel says singing
[1:01:00] the second i take my lap breath i'll
[1:01:02] probably do a jig i'll probably dance
[1:01:05] ain't no telling i'm gonna be happy when
[1:01:07] i get over there so let's just start now
[1:01:10] so i'm snapping down at the cross where
[1:01:12] my savior died amen
[1:01:15] and he went out to meet the lord
[1:01:19] how many wants to go out that way if you
[1:01:20] go that way
[1:01:22] i'm hoping to go on the rapture but if i
[1:01:24] go that way i want to go to be like that
[1:01:26] fullness of joy fullness of peace god
[1:01:29] wants you to be completely full
[1:01:32] complete
[1:01:33] we are complete in
[1:01:36] him why do you think people do all the
[1:01:39] things they do to their body and do
[1:01:41] undress the way they do because they're
[1:01:42] not complete they're trying to satisfy
[1:01:45] trying to complain come to a place of
[1:01:47] satisfaction because that's what
[1:01:49] completion does
[1:01:51] when you feel complete with something
[1:01:53] you have all that you need you've got it
[1:01:56] hello
[1:01:57] and you're happy
[1:01:59] you're content
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:02] amen
[1:02:03] so
[1:02:06] oh my
[1:02:07] now notice
[1:02:10] in ephesians let me just say he he typed
[1:02:12] it
[1:02:13] he talked about it paul talked about the
[1:02:15] ephesians that it's like god working on
[1:02:18] us
[1:02:19] like he's working and building a
[1:02:21] building
[1:02:23] in verse 10 of chapter two he says for
[1:02:24] we are his workmanship created in christ
[1:02:28] jesus
[1:02:32] and two good works which god hath before
[1:02:34] or day that we should walk in them
[1:02:38] let's go on down
[1:02:41] wherefore remember that ye being in
[1:02:44] times past gentiles in the flesh
[1:02:47] who are called uncircumcision by that
[1:02:49] which is called the circumcision in the
[1:02:51] flesh made with hands
[1:02:54] that at that time ye were without christ
[1:02:56] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[1:02:59] israel
[1:03:00] strangers from the covenants of promise
[1:03:03] having no
[1:03:04] without god in the world
[1:03:07] here paul's talking about where we was
[1:03:09] at at one time
[1:03:12] and now
[1:03:14] but now in christ jesus you were
[1:03:16] sometimes a far off or made nigh
[1:03:19] by the blood of christ
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:24] how many is close to christ now
[1:03:26] close to christ
[1:03:28] for he is our peace who has made both
[1:03:31] one and has broken down the middle wall
[1:03:33] of petition between us
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:37] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[1:03:40] even the law of commandments contained
[1:03:42] in ordinances
[1:03:44] or to make himself of twain one new man
[1:03:49] so
[1:03:50] making
[1:03:52] peace
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:56] oh my
[1:03:58] i got to stop you for just a minute is
[1:04:00] that all right
[1:04:01] i think the greatest thing ever
[1:04:04] that you can ever experience
[1:04:07] is whenever
[1:04:08] the battle between you and god is
[1:04:10] over amen
[1:04:12] because folks i'm here to tell you
[1:04:15] he you know he's your judge
[1:04:18] you're going to go off into a devil's
[1:04:19] hell unless you make peace with god
[1:04:23] unless you get
[1:04:24] unless you get to be at peace with god
[1:04:26] you're in a lot of trouble
[1:04:28] huh
[1:04:31] and if you ever have the peace that
[1:04:34] god gives you
[1:04:36] it's because he has
[1:04:38] what is he what he has ex you have been
[1:04:40] accepted as i think the scripture says
[1:04:42] you've been accepted in the beloved
[1:04:46] god says okay
[1:04:48] all right
[1:04:49] you repent i see the repentance is
[1:04:51] genuine
[1:04:52] i give you the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:54] i wash your sins away how many believe
[1:04:56] that the forgiveness of your sins god
[1:04:58] has christ has to forgive you
[1:05:01] you have to have that forgiveness before
[1:05:03] grace before peace ever comes in
[1:05:07] and folks i'm here to tell you if
[1:05:08] there's not there's unforgiveness there
[1:05:10] you won't be at peace you'll never have
[1:05:12] peace without other forgiveness
[1:05:14] how many knows that peace how many of
[1:05:16] those what that forgiveness is based
[1:05:18] upon
[1:05:20] that forgiveness is based upon whether
[1:05:22] you would forgive every man their
[1:05:24] trespasses
[1:05:27] you hold one thing against one person
[1:05:29] and god's going to hold it against you
[1:05:33] if you forgive not men their trespasses
[1:05:35] the bible neither will your heavenly
[1:05:36] father forgive you yours about that
[1:05:39] so it's based upon that you're not going
[1:05:40] to hold things against anybody else
[1:05:42] because god don't want a bunch of
[1:05:44] garbage up in here
[1:05:46] he don't want you with bitterness and
[1:05:48] all kinds of these other things that
[1:05:49] come along
[1:05:51] amen
[1:05:52] we got to be clean got to be right
[1:05:55] we'll get to that in a minute we talk
[1:05:56] about the flesh and
[1:05:58] and and the bible talks about the flesh
[1:06:00] and the spirit where we're going to
[1:06:01] supposed to be there
[1:06:03] as christians
[1:06:04] let's finish this
[1:06:06] so making peace that he might reconcile
[1:06:09] both
[1:06:10] unto god in one body by the cross
[1:06:13] having slain the enmity thereby and came
[1:06:16] and preached peace to you
[1:06:19] which were afar off and to them that
[1:06:21] were nigh
[1:06:22] for through him
[1:06:24] we had both have access by one spirit

[1:08:28] the fish back to ephesians first because
[1:08:30] we want to talk about
[1:08:31] paul describing
[1:08:34] us

[1:08:38] as a soldier
[1:08:40] all right

[1:09:00] in their place
[1:09:02] to where they would be able to
[1:09:06] conquer all the fiery darts of the
[1:09:08] wicked in other words he wants us to
[1:09:10] stand right
[1:09:13] stand as men and women
[1:09:15] that the devil can't touch
[1:09:22] um
[1:09:23] i wanted to start out with something but
[1:09:25] i don't know if i even i have it
[1:09:29] but it was in fundamental of our faith
[1:09:31] the prophet of god said you know the
[1:09:32] first thing friend there's some of you
[1:09:34] here that may not believe in divine
[1:09:35] healing you may not believe in the power
[1:09:37] of god first
[1:09:39] he says let me say this you first you
[1:09:42] were born here
[1:09:44] to control all circumstances
[1:09:49] how many beliefs
[1:09:50] god is
[1:09:52] as a son or a daughter of god and i
[1:09:54] believe it was billy paul that said he's
[1:09:56] seen the blind
[1:09:58] the deaf all be able to see and hear and
[1:10:01] all kinds of things he saw but the
[1:10:03] greatest miracle was how his dad could
[1:10:05] handle

[1:10:09] huh how many words of people are like
[1:10:11] that lord help me to be able to control
[1:10:14] any circumstance that comes my way

[1:10:19] christ
[1:10:20] till i can commit that to christ and
[1:10:22] watch god work it out right
[1:10:24] and control all circumstances and he got
[1:10:27] that from the fact that adam was given
[1:10:29] power over all the earth right
[1:10:32] he was given authority over all the fish
[1:10:34] over all the animals he was supposed to
[1:10:36] be the ruler of the whole world even the
[1:10:39] winds the waves obey like jesus did how
[1:10:43] many knows jesus was that kind of man
[1:10:45] he controlled every circumstance it
[1:10:47] didn't matter if the ship was about the
[1:10:49] sink
[1:10:50] right
[1:10:52] the disciples said don't you care that
[1:10:54] we're about to perish
[1:10:58] brother glenn if i if i think i would
[1:11:00] hope that if i was on the boat
[1:11:02] i'd have told myself look if we go down
[1:11:05] he goes down so just chill
[1:11:09] right
[1:11:10] jesus in the boat so he may be sleeping
[1:11:13] down there but i'm here to tell you
[1:11:15] you know if we go down he goes down
[1:11:18] don't worry about it he's on and then
[1:11:20] don't you care what they wanted to try
[1:11:22] to say that he didn't care you know he
[1:11:25] cares

[1:11:31] said peace
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:34] peace still
[1:11:37] and it all became calm
[1:11:40] what did the disciples say
[1:11:45] behold i believe it is what manner of
[1:11:47] man is this
[1:11:48] that even the seas and the winds in the
[1:11:51] sea obey him
[1:11:54] amen
[1:11:56] god help us if we get to that place
[1:12:00] where we can control
[1:12:02] every circumstances people be saying the
[1:12:04] same thing what kind of man is he what
[1:12:06] kind of woman is he look at how they did
[1:12:09] in that situation
[1:12:11] look how they handled themselves look at
[1:12:13] what they did

[1:12:23] says finally
[1:12:25] coming to a conclusion right
[1:12:27] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:12:30] lord and in the power of his might
[1:12:33] put on the whole armor not just part of
[1:12:35] it not halfway not incomplete

[1:12:49] may be able to stand against the wiles
[1:12:51] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:12:54] flesh and blood against but against
[1:12:55] principalities against powers against
[1:12:58] the rulers of darkness of this world
[1:13:01] against spiritual weaknesses in high
[1:13:03] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[1:13:05] armor of god

[1:13:35] possibly do now
[1:13:37] having done all to stand now you're
[1:13:39] standing there
[1:13:41] stand therefore
[1:13:43] having your lawyers get about with truth
[1:13:46] having on the breastplate of
[1:13:47] righteousness and your feet shot with
[1:13:49] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:13:52] amen

[1:14:00] judgment and rather god you can have
[1:14:02] peace joy now everything that god has
[1:14:05] that's the gospel christ died for you so
[1:14:07] you can have all of that
[1:14:09] the gospel of peace and above all taking
[1:14:12] the shield of faith wherewith you shall
[1:14:14] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:14:17] the wicked let me ask you something what
[1:14:19] is a man going to do if he doesn't have
[1:14:21] faith in god
[1:14:23] the devil is going to have every dart
[1:14:25] come and hit him
[1:14:27] you don't go through jesus christ you're
[1:14:28] not going to be able to
[1:14:30] do anything
[1:14:32] right without me you can do nothing
[1:14:37] amen and so
[1:14:39] without that faith in god like the
[1:14:41] prophet god says anybody that ever
[1:14:42] amounted to hillary beings believed in
[1:14:44] jesus christ
[1:14:47] among to anything believed in christ
[1:14:49] jesus
[1:14:50] amen believed in the cross and what he
[1:14:52] did
[1:14:53] so that's the shield that's the shield
[1:14:55] of faith wherewith you shall be able to
[1:14:57] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:15:00] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:15:01] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:15:05] god amen praise the lord so many believe
[1:15:08] paul kind of gives a illustration there
[1:15:10] of perfection and completion and
[1:15:12] standing and being able to quench all
[1:15:15] the fiery darkness
[1:15:17] of the wicked being in a place to where
[1:15:19] the devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:15:22] you
[1:15:25] i laugh because you say that brother
[1:15:27] glenn say well the devil don't know what

[1:15:43] uh your bed and drop down on your knees
[1:15:46] and say god make me aware
[1:15:48] of what the devil is going to throw at
[1:15:49] me today

[1:16:16] whole thing down on the floor the whole
[1:16:18] door off of there taking it down and
[1:16:21] taking the door apart
[1:16:24] oh just to change your little face i'm

[1:16:37] and this little thing that you go
[1:16:38] through the hole and push it in the
[1:16:40] other side and these big old clumsy
[1:16:42] fingers they're just not too dainty
[1:16:45] and we was trying to fit it in there
[1:16:47] just right and i pulled it back apart
[1:16:48] and the spring and the main pin
[1:16:51] fell inside of the door down here
[1:16:58] oh no

[1:17:35] devil's going to make you prove
[1:17:36] right
[1:17:38] and you think everything's supposed to
[1:17:40] go good it doesn't always all go good
[1:17:45] but that's okay how many knows god made
[1:17:47] it that way
[1:17:48] to try us
[1:17:50] you know he could have made everything
[1:17:51] easy if he wanted to but he knew that's
[1:17:53] not what we needed

[1:19:30] how good god's been for you not just
[1:19:32] spiritually but definitely that right
[1:19:36] but all the natural things that god's
[1:19:37] given you
[1:19:40] how good god is
[1:19:44] oh my

[1:20:02] other than outside of israel right
[1:20:04] we had should i say not have it's still
[1:20:08] it's still good
[1:20:09] but it's going down really really fast
[1:20:12] right
[1:20:14] and people don't they aren't happy with
[1:20:15] it
[1:20:17] huh
[1:20:19] the very politicians that are now
[1:20:22] that were nothing but
[1:20:24] you and i very poor not because of
[1:20:26] politics and everything that floods in
[1:20:28] because now they're multi-millionaires
[1:20:31] and they aren't even happy with it
[1:20:36] it's sad folks

[1:20:39] not going to have it very long
[1:20:41] right
[1:20:44] well i appreciate the freedom god gave
[1:20:46] me
[1:20:47] and i plan on having it eons of time
[1:20:51] i'm sure you do too
[1:21:04] peter
[1:21:05] ii peter
[1:21:08] actually
[1:21:09] first peter
[1:21:14] very familiar scripture but it has to do
[1:21:16] with
[1:21:17] perfection completion
[1:21:20] being able to stand and not fall
[1:21:25] i shall not be i shall not be moved amir
[1:21:29] likes that song
[1:21:31] i shall not be no i shall not be moved
[1:21:35] just like a tree
[1:21:37] that's planted by the water
[1:21:40] and she left that that's what we want
[1:21:42] how is that what you want to be this is
[1:21:44] the age folks
[1:21:46] to stand
[1:21:48] when all everybody around you falls
[1:21:51] stand
[1:21:54] verse 4 first peter 1 whereby are given
[1:21:57] unto us exceeding in great precious
[1:21:59] promises that by these you might be
[1:22:01] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:22:04] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:22:06] world through lust and besides this give
[1:22:10] all diligence now what is this here this
[1:22:13] is coming to the stature
[1:22:15] of a complete or perfect
[1:22:18] man right
[1:22:21] add to your faith virtue
[1:22:26] and to your virtue knowledge
[1:22:31] my my i have got to preach on that
[1:22:33] sometime again
[1:22:35] for the third time or fourth
[1:22:38] how many knows we have got to get our
[1:22:40] mind right we have got to have some
[1:22:43] knowledge
[1:22:45] i don't know if anybody could tell me
[1:22:47] what brother bannon said that knowledge
[1:22:48] was
[1:22:51] if i'm not wrong he said that knowledge
[1:22:53] is to be able to discern between right
[1:22:55] and wrong
[1:22:57] amen
[1:22:58] and to knowledge temperance
[1:23:01] and to temperance patience
[1:23:05] and to patience godliness
[1:23:08] and to godliness brotherly kindness
[1:23:12] one other thought that i felt like the
[1:23:14] holy spirit gave me if you're the
[1:23:16] happiest person in the world you're
[1:23:18] gonna be the kindest person in the world
[1:23:23] you're going to be the lovingest person
[1:23:25] in the world you're going to be the
[1:23:26] sweetest
[1:23:27] person in the world
[1:23:30] amen
[1:23:31] because you just simply can't be the
[1:23:33] happiest person in the world unless it's
[1:23:35] truly christ in you and that's what he
[1:23:37] is
[1:23:38] all of those
[1:23:40] be kind-hearted tender loving one
[1:23:42] another and forgiving one right
[1:23:45] you're gonna be all those things
[1:23:48] and to godliness brotherly kindness
[1:23:50] empty brotherly kindness
[1:23:53] charity
[1:23:55] amen how many knows the charity is the
[1:23:57] capping of it all
[1:24:00] amen nothing greater
[1:24:02] now there's hope
[1:24:05] faith and charity
[1:24:07] and the great of these is
[1:24:10] charity or love right
[1:24:13] and the brotherly kindness
[1:24:15] charity
[1:24:17] if these things be in you and abound
[1:24:20] they make you that ye shall neither be
[1:24:22] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:24:24] of our lord jesus christ
[1:24:26] but he that lacketh the things is blind
[1:24:29] and cannot see a far off
[1:24:32] and had forgotten that he was purged
[1:24:34] from his old sins wherefore the writer
[1:24:36] brethren give diligence
[1:24:40] to make your callings and elections sure
[1:24:48] listen to this next scripture
[1:24:50] if ye do thee things
[1:24:53] he
[1:24:54] shall never
[1:24:55] fall
[1:24:58] wow
[1:25:02] looks good to me don't you
[1:25:05] how many wants to be there
[1:25:07] be in a place where you
[1:25:10] never
[1:25:11] fall paul said having done all to stand
[1:25:14] do all of this gear up like this
[1:25:17] completely gear up
[1:25:20] peter says completely have all of these
[1:25:22] virtues you had all of these and if
[1:25:24] these things are in you
[1:25:26] they'll make you
[1:25:28] like jesus
[1:25:31] he controlled
[1:25:32] every circumstance
[1:25:35] never fell
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:48] we're going to skip one where it says
[1:25:50] the old man the lust of the flesh and so
[1:25:52] forth
[1:25:53] you know
[1:25:54] all of the things that the flesh is and
[1:25:56] all of the
[1:25:57] deformity
[1:25:59] i mean those all of the deformity that
[1:26:01] the flesh is
[1:26:03] but you're not in the flesh but the
[1:26:04] fruit of the spirit is love dwight peace
[1:26:07] long suffering and so forth in that
[1:26:08] right
[1:26:12] so that's what he says you put that on
[1:26:15] put on these things
[1:26:17] let's go to jesus in in the last
[1:26:18] scripture i want to go to is in is the
[1:26:20] way that jesus looked at it what he said
[1:26:22] about
[1:26:23] perfection
[1:26:26] and it's in matthew 5.
[1:26:38] you know a scripture just comes to me
[1:26:40] also
[1:26:41] that i didn't write down but i think
[1:26:43] it's first corinthians 13 where paul
[1:26:45] talked about
[1:26:46] how that where there's knowledge it'll
[1:26:48] fail whether it's faith these other
[1:26:50] things he says and all these will come
[1:26:51] to where there's prophecies he says yeah
[1:26:54] but he says you know that love never
[1:26:57] fails
[1:26:58] not right how many remembers that
[1:27:01] genuine real genuine love it doesn't
[1:27:04] ever fail there's no fault in that
[1:27:07] perfect love
[1:27:08] i remember the prophet of god says
[1:27:10] you've got to have perfect love to get
[1:27:11] in there
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:13] you can't come into this place without
[1:27:15] perfect love and he also said thus saith
[1:27:18] the lord it'll take perfect love to put
[1:27:20] you in there
[1:27:22] i mean believe we've got to come to that
[1:27:23] perfect love
[1:27:26] we'll go with chapter
[1:27:29] 5 and verse
[1:27:31] you have heard that it had been said
[1:27:33] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:27:35] thine enemy but i say unto you love your
[1:27:38] enemies
[1:27:39] bless them that curse you and do good
[1:27:41] them that hate you and pray for them
[1:27:42] that despitefully use you and persecute
[1:27:45] you
[1:27:47] wow
[1:27:48] from what i understand if you can do
[1:27:50] this
[1:27:51] you're perfect
[1:27:55] now you forgive me if it's the wrong
[1:27:57] interpretation but let's read it a
[1:27:58] little further that ye may be the
[1:28:01] children of your father which is in
[1:28:03] heaven
[1:28:04] for he maketh the sun to rise on the
[1:28:06] evil and on the good and send us reign
[1:28:08] on the just and the unjust
[1:28:11] for if you love them which love you what
[1:28:13] reward have you you're just like
[1:28:14] everybody else
[1:28:17] huh
[1:28:18] because that's all what they do
[1:28:22] and if you sleep your salute your
[1:28:23] brethren only what do you more than
[1:28:25] others do not even the and so
[1:28:28] be
[1:28:29] ye therefore perfect
[1:28:32] even as your father in heaven
[1:28:35] is perfect
[1:28:37] amen
[1:28:39] oh that's one of the hardest things i
[1:28:41] believe in life that it is to do
[1:28:44] and you know i find brothers and sisters
[1:28:47] if you remember just remember this but
[1:28:49] everybody says cancer you know sometimes
[1:28:51] you have a perfectly healthy body but a
[1:28:53] cancer comes up perhaps you had a wreck
[1:28:54] perhaps you become a bruise he says it
[1:28:56] can come from a bruise
[1:28:58] and then it'll grow and it'll get worse
[1:29:00] and worse and worse
[1:29:02] the bible talks about a root of
[1:29:03] bitterness when you un don't forgive
[1:29:05] somebody for something there's a root
[1:29:07] down there that abraham talked about
[1:29:09] that little hole you got to grub it out
[1:29:11] and that bitterness will grow because
[1:29:13] that root grows you got to get it all
[1:29:15] out
[1:29:16] that root of bitterness grow and grow
[1:29:19] and grow and it'll canker you it'll
[1:29:21] deform you
[1:29:24] you got to make sure you get that out of
[1:29:26] there there's not a rude bitterness even
[1:29:29] if they would kill you you would say
[1:29:31] like steven did isn't that right
[1:29:34] what did steven say he says after they
[1:29:36] stone him fixing the throw rocks at them
[1:29:38] forgive them but they don't know what to
[1:29:40] do
[1:29:41] don't lay this to their charge
[1:29:45] folks
[1:29:46] you in carnality you will remember what
[1:29:49] people did for the longest time
[1:29:52] you'll remember it for whatever for
[1:29:54] whatever you can't there's no possible
[1:29:56] way in your human
[1:29:58] natural ability to be able to do that
[1:30:01] don't lay that at their charge
[1:30:03] i forgive you all for this i know you're
[1:30:06] fixing to bash my head in with rocks but
[1:30:08] i forgive you for it and god don't lay
[1:30:10] it to their charge don't put it on no
[1:30:12] charge this is a no charge situation
[1:30:15] here
[1:30:18] even jesus not even they forgive them
[1:30:21] father for they know don't know what
[1:30:23] they do

[1:30:30] and and all those things are blinding

[1:30:34] that's what jealousy they fought the
[1:30:36] fair they were jealous of jesus they
[1:30:38] hated him and it blinded them to what
[1:30:41] they actually did
