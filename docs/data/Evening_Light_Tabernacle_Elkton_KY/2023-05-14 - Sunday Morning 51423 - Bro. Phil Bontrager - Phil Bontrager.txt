========================================

foreign children can be dismissed to Sunday school and it's open our Bibles too Psalms 105 and I'll read till chapter 17. actually we'll read till chapter 16. speaking I'll give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people Lord ye in His holy name at the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord remember His Marvelous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth spirit he is the Lord our God his judgments are in all the Earth which Covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac um saying under thee will I give give the land of Canaan the light of your inheritance when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another people saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm okay you can be seated morning brothers and sisters it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning it's good to have a wonderful uh Mother's Day today and I had got that just a couple well one scripture here reminded me a lot of Mother's Day it's in Luke 13. see about where Jesus let me find it here and read it Luke 13 34. is talking about when Jesus was talking about Jerusalem oh Jerusalem Jerusalem which killeth the prophets and stoned them that are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen doeth her gather her brood under her wings but you would not he was talking about Jerusalem there and uh I got a couple quotes here brother Brandon was talking about Mother's Day see if I don't get it mixed up here and this is from it shall be even as it was told me and then there's another and the other one was Mother's Day and it's kind of a compilation of them he said well everyone uh things about their mother you know I think mother the good true mother is the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John mother mother gets them first he said that's the one who brings them up first is Mother and he said and I think the thoughts of mother and I have one this morning by the grace of God still here on Earth with us and I'm grateful for mother mother is so great you know first one that receives you in this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she Bears you under her heart and she is the first to know you and the first two in this life to hold you then when you're born she has one of the first hands that touch you and wipe wipes the back the tears out of your eyes she is the first one to pay you and to love you into coup over you in this life is your mother now I think that there is nothing enough honor that we could give a mother mother is first with the child she and she is a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path and that it must travel mother has a responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road and I think that's that's why my mother's has a special little touch and that was from mother's brother Brandon's Mother's Day sermon in 59 and how true is that and you see and brothers said it before it was parent delinquency you see the the absence of fathers and mothers in the children in the generation today and it's a it's a sad thing but we are very thankful for good mothers and we want to tell everybody Happy Mother's Day I was a had a little thought here and let's see I kind of get it mixed up here sometimes because I get a little nervous but let's go to Luke seven Luke seven here starting in uh Luke 7 starting in verse 19. and uh the thought came from just all the different pressures we live in a world that's full of pressure pressure pressure always pressure it seems like everybody's under pressure and uh with work with all different kinds of pressures but uh this is uh starting in Luke uh 7 verse 19 and John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying art he that should come our way for another when the men were coming to him they said John Baptist has sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look away for another and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight then Jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell John what things you have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here and the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached and blessed is he whomsoever shall not be offended in me when the messenger John were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning John but went out to see the in Into the Wilderness for to see a reed shaken with the wind but what when she had for to see a man clothed in Saw frame it behold they are gorgeously apparel and lived delicately earned the king's courts but what went ye outfit yay say unto you and much more than a Prophet this is he of whom it is was written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee for I say unto thee among those that are born of a woman there is not a greater profit than John the Baptist but he that is the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he and uh uh brother Brown said in here and this is a modern events made clear about prophecy he said God sent his Prophet as you as the word had promised in Malachi 3 or messenger I'll send before my face to forerun is coming now if you want to vindicate that to prove it Matthew 11 chapter of indicate the same when the Disciples of John came over to see uh they seen Jesus and they said John is in prison said that we've come to ask you whether he gone to Eagle hide I had been filmed over and he was in prison he was fixing to die said go ask him see John said oh his fans in his hand he'll thoroughly had to die and go into the stalk come up again and make the true bride so he said he'll gather his wheat into the Garner and he'll burn the lot burn the fire watch that that Forerunner of Christ in that age what he said would happen the grain and I hope you're not asleep the grain is here here it'll be gathered into the Garner it was that bride that part of it but what did he say will happen to the stalk it'll be burned with unquenchable fire seek salvation now while you can be a grain not a star see go into the life not the old dead form go into the Life of Christ the word made manifest the main manifest and Vindicated so this is this is the Gathering time the combine is coming you better get into the grain because the Shuck's going to be left behind now what we find happened Jesus to finish my Recreation here about Matthew 11 he's uh saying about John he said now wait I'll give John a book on how to con he didn't say I'll give John a book on how to conduct himself a believer in jail no he said stand around and Watch What Happens go back and show John what's happened the lame wall wow lines see the debtor and blessed is you who wasn't offended in me and the disciples crossed started across the hill brother Madam says that John had uh we went out to see what and did you see what the man catering and software and so case just goes back over that but he says how Jesus had gave him uh a compliment by saying that he there was none like under John okay let's see but he said there's one prophecy has been filled right before the face with a foreman to come exactly what Malachi said now the Malachi 3 not Malachi 4 John the Baptist was Malachi 3. he's already come they did what they said but remember Malachi 4 media after immediately after Malachi 4 profit the fourth coming of John the Baptist Elijah the fifth coming will be in Revelations the two witnesses he'll go to the remnant of the Jews but God had used that same Spirit five times Grace g j e s u s it's all been Jesus all the time Faith f-a-i-t-h Grace g-r-a-c-e and so forth you see the number five is a Grace number and used it won't use just three won't use just two three or four it's five times he uses it see here after the prop but in Malachi 4 immediately after the prophet prophesies the whole earth is burnt over and the righteous walk out upon the ashes of the wicked exactly see that's the Malachi 4 prophecy but just going back to what uh brother Ren said about John's Eagle Eye had gotten filmed over and a lot of times we live in this world of pressure and sometimes to me it feels like sometimes our Eagle Eye might get filmed over but we got to go back to the word reminds me also of uh how David said uh you know as my soul panted for the water broke so does my soul length after thee Lord and brother Ram said you know uh if a deer gets hit by an arrow if he can ever he might though he might be down though he might have lost a lot of blood if you can ever get to the water Brook and then it'll be all right and the world we live in sometimes it feels like we might got hit by one of the enemy's arrows but if we can ever get back to the water Brook which is that ever present water from The Rock Jesus and uh let's see I got one more scripture we live just in a constant World pressure and sometimes we do get hit by enemies you know fire and sometimes we do get down kind of 21. but we're in an age also uh how brother Aaron said it he said every and brother random said too how the ages they always die they died they died they went into the ground but this age can't die this is the last stage and uh Jesus said here so when we feel Under Pressure we should always go back to the word Feast on the word how many says here in Luke 21 and starting in verse 25. this is what we should be looking to there should be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then they shall and then shall they see the son of man coming in the cloud with power and great Glory and he says in verse 28 here and when these things begin to come to pass and look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draw an eye and that's where we are we better start looking up because things are shaping up get back in the word and keep looking up brother David foreign with all your heart this morning and mine's just good to be in the house the Lord and uh I have brother

amazing we can come together all people from all different Lifestyles and backgrounds and something we have in common and it's more than just the message of the hour it's more than just the profit we had Christ and if you can look back at your life and see what God got a hold of you by drawing you to him then you know that you're here because he brought you here if you're just here because it's just a religious thing to do you probably need to get a hold of God you need to do more than that friends it's got to be more than that amen good to see you all let's just let's go to prayer Lord Jesus we're so grateful we can come here this morning we're just so thankful father that we can look at our lives and see how you got a hold of us you do us to yourself no matter what our background we might have been raised in a message church we might have come from the worst drugs in the world but we know that something got a hold of us and Drew us to you father we're so grateful this morning Lord we can gather with people who can say Amen to that who can testify to the great power and the love of God lord Jesus this morning you want to bring your word you want to have something to say to us father I pray that each heart is ready to hear help me Lord just to say the things that you once said when your spirit to say it Lord and let everyone recognize this the voice of God speaking just to set aside all our flesh with all our ideas all our thoughts and just hear from you Lord we're expecting this Lord let your let your spirit and your word come and bring a comfort and a healing to every situation that's needed we ask this in your name amen if you want to read along I'm going to read from Psalms 31 31 19 and 20. I like what the brother said it's all about Jesus it's all you talk about is Jesus yeah anytime you get off of that you're off the track it's always about Jesus amen Psalm 31 19 oh how great is thy goodness which thou Hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou has wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men do you see where he said you trust him before the sons of men you're not afraid to make that confession Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man thou should keep them secretly in a pavilion from The Strife of tongues you can have a seat if you like this morning I want to speak on the thought of The Secret of his presence so let's go back to that verse 20. let's break it down a little bit it says this Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence that word secret needs a covering or a shelter it's a hiding place it's a protection and that word presence means his face and so what you're looking at here brother sister is that that secret that hiding place is when you're face to face with God you're in a secret place and it's just you and God there's nobody else around there's nobody else interfering there's not your church member it's not your family it's not your pastor it's just you and God and that's the secret place where you hide you from what the pride of man that Pride means snares and conspiracy it's when Satan uses people and your own self and whoever it is he come against you and these snarities like and every one of you you know you're going through life and everything's fine all it says Satan has a trap for you fall into it and you're laying there looking around and say what happened to me I thought I was doing great and all of a sudden you're falling on your back and think oh my goodness what's going on around here and what you have to do is recognize that you're still in the secret place because once you get in there you can't get out you're sealed in and everything else is sealed out and no matter what the self flesh does it no matter what you find yourself doing no matter what you're going through once you're in that place and that Veil is hit around you and it's just you and God together there's nothing can ever pull you out of there you can't get out if you try to you won't you can't get anywhere you're stuck she'll recognize friends if you are born again this morning you are going into Rapture whether you want to or not you can't get out it ain't even a choice anymore all right the secret and that secret place of his friends and it's his secret Because unless you're there you don't even know what I'm talking about I remember right for years I was seeking the Holy Ghost seeking the Holy Ghost because I had in my mind what it took to get it I had in my mind or what it was I had my idea what it was and I struggled and struggled and struggled and one time God just said why don't you quit just stop let me give it to you that changed everything changed everything and all of a sudden oh now I understand now I know what he's talking about before that it was just a mental conception in my mind what it must be to be there and when you get there you realize it wasn't what you thought at all it was because Jesus said you can't even understand you can't see the Kingdom of Heaven except you're born again amen it says this Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the Strath uh The Strife that means dispute and controversy of tongues and so again that word secretly it's a little different word but it means to hide it's a hidden a hiding place hide from Discovery and I really like that in a pavilion so this secret this place the secret of his presence is in a pavilion you know what that Pavilion it's a it's a booth it's a covert it's a rude temporary shelter yeah like this that sacred place is right there it's in you it's right in here you say well I'm not a root temporary shell to get a little bit older you'll recognize you are living in a rude temporary shelter it breaks down I don't care how you take care of it it breaks down and if you're here long enough you're gonna die that shelter is going to go away but brother and sister that secret place is when he comes and indwells in your heart right in here and nothing can get him out and we are praying you recognize your praying to the very Holy Spirit that's living inside your soul right here and that brother sister is a secret that no one can take from you nobody can take that from you it can't it's right there this is that root temporary shelter because that secret place I just can come in here and that's why no matter what happens all the way around me no matter what happens to this rude temporary shelter you cannot take that life that secret away from me because I am in his presence constantly it's there it's a permanent place it's a permanent deposit and all it was was that part that was part of God before the foundation world it was quickened alive it was always in there brother will it was now as in there no matter how much you you rather through the things of the world no matter what you do that thing was in there and it was pulling and you can try to find some kind of satisfaction you run here and you run there and you do all you want but something inside says yeah but I'm still not satisfied and then all of a sudden that you come to that point and God comes to you and he gets a hold of you and he draws you out and it's not well I saw God I was a seeking God I wasn't found him oh no you did not that that part of God inside you pulled you he saw you he come running after that sheep that was lost to say I got one over here I got one over here I got one over here I got one over here I'm gonna find them because they they get my father gave them to me and then a single one of them can be lost because they're part of me and if they're lost then a part of me will be missing ain't gonna happen if you want to turn to Psalm 27 David's talking about this a little bit more it's very familiar we know this where brother Grant preached the Rapture of Psalm 27 1 it says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear my all the world right now is just living in fear fear is at a high level right now everyone is angry they're defensive they're screaming at each other everyone is so afraid what's going on it's just the whole world is they're hard it's a failing for fear they said who will I be afraid of the Lord is the strength of My Life For Whom Shall I be afraid when the wicked in my enemy my foes come up on onto me upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble and fail though in whole should Camp against me my heart shall not fear we just say something right now he said my heart shall not fear you might experience filming your fear in your in your spirit Realm you might have something nice in your your mind is all terrible about something but your heart is at peace your heart is at rest your heart is not afraid we'll talk more about that as we go though cap against me my heart Shall I Fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident ever been a war how about every day Satan brings all he can against you to bring home some condemnation to get you a fearful get you worried get you stressed about something that's the word he's talking about he said when that well that rises against me I will be confident because one thing I have desired of the Lord that life seek after that I'm a dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life the rest of it don't matter all this stuff going around it's temporary it's periphery but the one thing that my heart desires is that I would dwell in the house of Lord all the days and to inquire in his Temple because this is the house of the Lord this is where he lives this is why he comes this is our confidence because I can look at my soul I can see my desires I can see from the deep and outside no matter what's going on in my head I know for my soul that um something has changed and that's where my desire comes from oh that's the one thing you desired I'm gonna skip down a little bit I'm getting back to 27 but David says this in Psalms 42 he says as a heart pan adapt to the water Brooks so pass my soul after thee oh God thirsteth for God for the Living God once shall I come and appear before God there he is it's that secret of his presence he said what kind of appear before God why not going to be in his presence when is it going to be something that I can find that satisfaction because there's a thirst you cannot give yourself a thirst an actual thirst is born in you it may if you don't satisfy that thirst with water you are gonna die but that spiritual thirst is born within you too if you don't satisfy that spiritual thirst you're gonna die because there's something inside that has to come to life and that's the thing that pulls us it draws us to God and that's what they were saying there's something inside of me that I just can't find satisfaction until I get to that secret place when I can get along just me and God and shut down everything else around me in the midst of all the trial and everything that's going on I find a secret place where I can rest a place of rest Frank listen David didn't even have that option the act the answer to that that you and I have you ever think of that David cannot be born again David could not be born again but he was a seed of God he had a heart a Believer and so he was fighting this little way he could not actually enter in there and live in that place like you can enter and live in that place because this is a permanent deposit David couldn't have all the uh the the access we have the the the privilege we have today the right we have we have a right to have that conference you have a right to enter into that secret place that the New Testament shows prophets and all those sages and all those things remember said they all would have loved to live in this day why because you have access to God that they didn't have on a daily basis [Applause] you don't have to be a prophet you don't have to be a great Minister you don't have to be anything but you can have the access on every morning when you wake up you can know that I am in the presence of God I am in this secret place and David would have killed to get there yeah oh the privilege we have the access the the the the the the how do you explain it that you can have one-on-one fellowship with the very creator God himself he condescends he says I love you I want you I want to refellowship with you I'm in a relationship with you individually why go to church please what does that have to do with it let's see what David says about going to church let's go back to 27 Psalm 27 4. one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple he said that's the thing I desired I just want to see God that's my whole life is focused around God to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he didn't say you're not going to have trouble but in the time of trouble he shall hide you in his Pavilion there's that word again right you are in The Secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock so let's look at these two words the first one is Temple he's referring to a building Solomon hadn't even built the temple yet there wasn't a temple but here David speaking by prophecy said I inquire in his temple in this building he said in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion that's that same rude temporary shelter and the secret we'll go to the secret of his Tabernacle which is a tent shall he hide me so he said I go to church to inquire the Lord but his secret is in the Tabernacle the secret isn't in this building this is where we come to church we need to come here because this is where he has set things in order this is where he has set a Ministry in order he sent a body of Christ in order to do what to get you to that secret place in the temple it's not just to get you to the church you can come to church every day your life and die and go to hell but if you ever find the secret of that Tabernacle in that tent that you're living in if that ever becomes a reality then you can't go to hell that's the difference yeah you got to come to church you don't come to church you don't even believe the word you got you know what Satan will do he gets you all discouraged well I don't even feel like I have the faith to go to church anymore I just feel so backslid I people don't even want to see me nobody loves me anyways I'm just going to stay home go ahead listen to that go ahead and stay at home if you think you're gonna find God there but if you're one of gods he's gonna kick your butt and you're gonna get back to church and he'll drag you through the gravel and what he has to do but he's gonna get you back here because this is a place that he is ordained to help you find that secret place he wants you to get to that place and he has a Ministry and place to get you you know what that Ministry looks like this it's the body of Christ he uses the body of Christ to get you to that secret place cause they know what they're talking about oh yeah it's more than the preacher it's the singers it's the musicians it's the deacons and some people running the sound system it's that person sitting there saying amen it's the entire body of Christ and to find the body of Christ said there's something wrong for you and you sit in that atmosphere that's provided that's that's created by the body of Christ and you sit in the atmosphere and something inside of you it's just longing for something and you got too much pride to humble yourself and take it brother Brown said you know what keeps you out self-will you say yeah but I still like the world a little bit better I've heard all this stuff before brother Phil I just don't know well there's two things about that the first one is terrifying because if you can sit in here in this atmosphere and not feel a thirst for God you have a serious spiritual problem but maybe it's just covered over by all your pride and self-will and sin and doubt and religion but you keep coming you'll find out because if you keep coming there's a good chance that he's bringing he said no I'm Gonna Get You I'm gonna get you you might not like the way I bring you but I'm Gonna Get You yeah because you're one of my yeah you come here you're inquiring to tell what's that inquire after God just see God let me let me tell you something else the gift behind a Pulpit is not for the preacher you all know that you have a need you come in choir you come and you're prayed up and you say God speak to me today and the preacher is up here preaching along and all of a sudden he goes right off on Simone that can't Jason he's over here thinking what where is this coming from I have no idea why I'm preaching this this is not in my notes I don't even know why I'm saying this I'm embarrassing myself up here what am I talking about if someone's sitting back there thinking speaking to me that's what the gift is for it's not for me it's not for me to get up here and shout and stamp around and scream and spit and all that that's not what this is for this is for the voice of God to speak to you and meet you exactly where your need is and you can know that God spoke to you today because you recognize the voice of God that's why you're coming to church to get that secret down here to get that established in here this is the Tabernacle that David Longford he didn't he didn't long for that Temple of Solomon he wanted to he said wanted to build he didn't see it he never had that but what he was long enough for he knew that he could get to that Temple then he could get that access right down in here this is what we're longing for you can go to church all day long the problem with that attitude is you have a denominational attitude because that's what they've done well I go to brother Thomas Butler's Church okay that don't put you in a rapture well I believe the message of the hour okay I don't put you in the rapture I sing and shout and dance and preach and I I had the baptize the Holy Ghost I'd ran the aisles and I good good things to do don't put you in a rapture not at all Here Comes the Bride nearly married couple God bless y'all see now I got off my subject what was it talking about the secret you get behind that you're beyond that interview into the holy of holies that's you and God no one else can come in there that's what we're here for you have to get in there friends once you get in there that's the ceiling that's where you're at that's what we come for that's why you come to church is that right I hope so it's a place of rest let's read out of Hebrews 4 let's let's switch this one but we're going to talk about place of rest Hebrews 4 1 it says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering to his rest any of you should seem to come short of it so he says there's a rest is God's rest it's a place where we need to enter into this rest he said For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so he's saying he's talking about the the children of Israel they're supposed to go into the promised land they didn't go in because they had heard the mo the prophet they had the prophet they had this message they had seen all the signs and wonders but when they came up to actually enter into that rest they couldn't do it because they didn't believe they could take it that's what Satan's doing some of you is sitting especially some of you younger people probably this morning he said holy spirit ain't for you you sought it you prayed about it it ain't for you just quit just forget it he's telling you the same thing he told those children lives or you can't take the promised land it's not for you there's too many Giants you can't overcome yourself you like the things of the world too much not being mixed with faith and then that hurt it and then what he also does brother bran says he he can't keep you out of church keep you from being a Christian and he'll take you and push you past it you just become religious and all of a sudden you're the best worshiper you're the best preacher you're the best whatever and you have the best Doctrine you know all the Mysteries and all that and he showed and Satan is actually encouraging you to believe that you're born again because that religion Makes You Think You Are good you mix the truth with your own ideas your own thoughts your own religion I was talking to a friend recently I said there's so many people I've seen to have a favorite Doctrine and they just won't let go of it they have a favorite doctor and it just makes them feel and makes them feel like Eve felt oh I have a little bit more truth than Adam I have a little bit more reality I see more than Adam does she Brother Brad says she could see more than her pastor did and that's why Satan appeals to our sense of of Pride and our lust for knowledge well I see a little bit more and it's so easy when we see someone who doesn't maybe see the things we are well they're wrong and I'm right and I'll puff myself up by pushing them down thinking they're in the promised land thinking they have that place because they know a little something more verse three for we which I believe do enter into rest as he said as I'm sworn in my wrath if they shall enter in my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of Lord The Works were finished the rest was there he said we wish to believe enter the rest so that's how you get in you don't work yourself in you don't try hard enough you don't live holy enough you don't pray enough you don't go to church enough you believe it's for you because something inside is telling you they're The Thirst for that and you and I have a thirst you cannot have a thirst if it's satisfy it you cannot thirst for more God if there's not more God for you to be satisfied with and so if you would just look past all Satan's life and all his facade and all the unbelief and you say well I'm saying if it's not for me then why do I still want it so bad why am I still here why am I still praying why am I still so miserable if I haven't if I'm not if it's not for me why don't I get satisfied just sitting on the Pew like a lot of other people because if you can just be satisfied sitting on the Pew and you you don't have in there that is probably a good idea it's a good thought or an indication that that thirst is not in there but if you're sitting there and you know there's more for you because look even after you're in there all you do is thirst for more you do not get satisfied and say well I got all of God I want I don't need it anymore God I'm just going to sit back when we get to this a little bit later but brother and sister if there's a thirst in there if it's been satisfied let me ask you this did you ever do a drink of water does that mean you're not thirsty anymore how many times do you need a drink every day every day and if that thirst is that thing is in there all you want is more of God because The Thirst is in let's go down to Hebrews 4 verse 9. they remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that injured into his rest he also had ceased from his own works as God did from his lettuce labor therefore to enter to that restless and even men should fall off the same example unbelief and so what we see is when you enter in by faith then you cease from your own religion you stop trying and your own ability you stop trying to please God in own ability let me tell you something friends if you're wondering if you're still doing that how discouraged do you get when you make a mistake you make mistakes everyone still make mistakes good if you were already in that body I'm in trouble how discouraged do you get can get discouraging right what do you do you recognize friends that you're not doing this on your own you're not overcoming in your own ability and so you say Satan you might knock me down again but watch me stand back up on my feet I'm still taking God at his work he's gonna set me free from whatever addiction it is you have he's gonna set me free from whatever is coming against me I am born to be an overcomer I am born to kick you back into hell and I am not going to lay here and wallow my sin and my depression and my discouragement because I am not discouraged [Music] oh my you ever you ever see someone getting knocked down and they just jump right back up and say whatever you need to be doing that friends Satan can knock you down he will sometime he knocked up proper down you know what you do you repent you get back up and you say you know what I'm still going through Satan come on watch if you want but I'm still going through but what you do we cease from our own words we cease from getting so done all I just try so hard God I don't know what to do I'm trying so hard he's saying stop trying so hard how about believing so hard that hurts your pride it does it's a pride thing friends you mean I'm not good enough I can't live good enough no that's why Calvary was for right you can't live good enough so why don't they cease the people they don't cease from their own Works in religion why because they don't trust because they don't believe is that what the children is or they came to the promised land and they didn't after all God had did all he did got him out of Egypt got the he fed them all the way through the Wilderness or everything they're going through got him across the Red Sea destroyed the Army behind us and all that stuff behind them and they get up to to the promise I said oh yeah but I know this is a little bit too much now and we'll look at that and we think are you serious right okay well let me bring it to 2023 why are you not born again are you serious what can God not do look at look at all the things he's done in this day all the Miracles he's performed look at all the times he'd come and met you at church look at all the situations you've been in look at all the testimonies you have testimony after testimony testimony that tells you Jesus Christ is still the same today as he's ever been and you let Satan talk to you out of it well yeah it's not for you please it is for you it is that thirst in there proves it let's look at some of these folks who would not cease from their own Works in Acts 7 45 Stephen you don't know Steven right he's our brother he says this he's talking about David let's go to verse 46. he's talking about the days of David he said David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands I said the prophet Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot still what house will you build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest oh my that just oh what is he saying hey I appreciate the church I appreciate you building this great place very respectful It's a Wonderful Church of God all across the country across the world you see this Mama's Great Big Beautiful churches people are built he says is that the place of my arrest is this building the place of his rest is that Pew the place no no remember David says it's the Tabernacle it's not the building it's not the temple it's the Tabernacle it's that person inside because all God ever wanted was an individual walk relationship with you the individual just just stop off from all this other stuff quit offer me your religion quit offer me what what Mysteries you understand quit offering me how well you worship quit offering me how anointed you are quit offering me all these things this is periphery they're very necessary but like Paul said you can you can know all Mysteries you can be give your body to be burned and you can shout you can worship but if you don't have love you're you're nothing it doesn't count it's just a periphery around it but the main thing is you have to have that relationship in your heart and without that the rest of it ain't gonna do you a bit of good you gotta get inside you gotta get that that that's sometimes like brother Brian would described it like a garden with a statue and he said now that there's flowers in there you know they had this the garden is all beautiful but the statue is the main thing it's the statue of Christ right here living through without that the guard means nothing you can go to church it's church services I want some recently and there's so much shouting and jumping and worshiping oh is this amazing beautiful how many people thought that was the evidence that they were born again how many people thought well I know I'm a Christian look how I look at this anointing look how I shout look how I jump look I run look how I preach that's just the temple okay I get to the Tabernacle you should have a church this is a beautiful Church you have you should have it shows your love and respect for God but ain't gonna put you in a rapture it ain't he said Heaven is my throne and Earth of my foots to what house will you build me saith Lord what is the place of my rest hath not my handmade all these things is our fallen nature desire to cross that Chasm back into fellowship with God by our own works by our own ability Adam spoke of it with his fig leaves Cain spoke of over the altar denominations speak with it all the way down through time because we're going to take the word we're gonna add this and we see this little bit of Truth and now we have the truth and this is what it takes and that spirit is rampant around our message friends be aware of that then he said he says hath not my my hand made all these things he's stiff-necked an uncircumcised and heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your father did so do you what's he saying you refuse to enter the rest you refuse to come until the rest that I provided because you want to do something yourself you want to provide your own your own rest you want to build your own art do you want to bring your beautiful religion you want to have King worship and accept it expect me to re to accept that but he said you always resist the Holy Ghost you only do it can resistance way back then in the beginning and Mankind has been resisting it all the way down ever since because we always think that God is not good enough to save us he's not strong enough without without our help we have to add something to it to prove to God something you don't have to prove anything to God except that you trust him and that you believe in and that you believe when he speaks to you and you hear his voice and you answer to it and you do what he asks you to do that's the relationship that he's looking for oh my that's what brother Brown said he said what is this Shekinah Glory today to break Beyond the Veil to see who God Is Standing before us see who God is standing here before us he said it's the pillar of fire he's veiled in human flesh that's where he's at what are you looking for you know what a lot of people let me just say something what if I was in a pillar of Fire appeared right there some of you would come and glued well friends do you not see him right there right there right there right there right there right there it's the pillar of fire inside us see if we if we really if that become a greater Revelation you come to church you'll have times a different attitude won't you you go about your life with a different attitude if you really recognize that one inside of you you are housing deity the very same Pillar of Fire that part of the Red Sea is inside of you the very same pillar fire that's Focus said let there be light and let there be the world it's housed inside of you it's right there it's not less it's the same thing but we see this human flesh he said now you realize there's a hidden place in Christ where you can be hid that all your enemies you love them you can't help it friends you can't help it but love your enemies because your nature inside of you is love solar fire is love there's something about it that you want people to love you you want to be lovely if you want people to be lovely you had to be love yourself if you put it oh come on it just believe that's what's the matter with the Church our country today there's too much to make believe in just religious works there's too many people making believe trying to impersonate Christianity trying to do something to act like Christians you haven't seen from their works if you're still trying to get Christian that won't work friend God knows that the devil knows it and people knows it you got to be genuine you got to be original and God will honor that so friends what you have to do is Cease from your own works and go behind the veil get to know Christ get that Born Again experience and you can find out that you are a genuine Christian you don't have to wonder anymore you don't have to look around say I wonder if I really am or not I'm sure trying really hard just cease from all that and just take God at his word all right oh my what does this look like a little bit let's go about Psalms 131 and say well if I'm into what am I going to do am I going to shout him with a dancer but I'm preaching God and testify I'm going to sing I'm gonna do all these things you'll do all that but that don't count you can do that without being there you have to do these things you have to be led by the spirit and it will manifest that but friends that's not what knowing my eyes lofty neither do I exercise myself in great matters or if things too high for me surely I have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is leaned from his mother my soul is even as a winged child it's a place of rest you know what a child does a little kid the whole world revolves around them right I want this right now and I'm going to get it I'm gonna throw a hissy if I don't get it and they scream and shout and all that but what happens is a person matures they call them down at least this post well let me put that if they mature they do as you get older don't mean you're maturing but they're resting the trusting that's what it looks like to be in there friends that's what it looks something goes wrong in your family and all the whole world is going to fall apart something goes wrong at church oh the whole church is going to fall apart well my question is so what if it does what's that got to do with this my kids are going out to the world what's that going to do with this but but the pastor he's going through a midlife crime he's not but you just passionately doing this and he's doing that what am I supposed to do be like a winged child Trust just realize quit trying to fix it God's running this church God's running this he puts people in office he puts people play in places to take care and just be that person that's not whining and crying about every little thing I can tell you something for sure pastors love those kind of Christians because too many times we don't manifest that you know who else loves those little kind of Christians Deacons trustees song leaders you know why songwriters love that kind of person because I don't care what you're going through you come to church and you stand there you sit there and you worship and you praise God you don't sit there it's a long face like I don't feel like preaching I don't feel like singing tonight I'm just going to kind of sit here because I'm just in a bad mood I've had a rough day all right we'll take the take the pacifier out of your mouth so you can sing living an emotional Realm just all emotions that's how I feel let me tell you something you know what the whole world is based on right now you know why all this perversion is going on in the world because they base everything their truth is based on their feelings how do I feel right now and when you base your truth on feelings it is shaky sand you are going to crumble it's just an earthquake waiting to happen this here is not based on how I'm feeling well I felt like a Christian yesterday until they don't feel like a Christian well what does that have to do with anything you don't feel like a Christian so that means you're not there's a lot of churches out there that'll teach you that Holy Spirit don't teach you that Isaiah 28 9 Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine then that a weave for the milk and drawn from the breath they quieted this same thing these are the ones each these ones he can show himself to he said John from the breast for priests that must be upon precept precept on precept line upon line up online here a little there look for staring lips and another tongue will they speak to this people what's that talking about he said I'm going to teach you line up online praise him on precept by staring by my Spirit that's what that's taught it don't mean you have to get up and speak in tongues to do it but it means it's a work of the spirit and he's teaching you The Voice is coming through the work of the spirit he's training he's teaching you his word he's teaching who he is by the spirit talking to you it's not just a man up here like me speaking to you just agree what I said or disagree with what I said but you actually hear the voice of God speaking to you it's just stammering lips and other tongues his voice is speaking to you recognize the voice of God and it might be one thing you hear today but you know that God came that still Small Voice and said something to you and you lashed on to that and that's what makes you a Believer you're sitting there amening me does not make you a Believer you sitting there agreeing with what I said doesn't make you a Believer but when you hear the voice of God speaking to them Street here she's like God had for me today and I'm gonna believe that and nothing's gonna talk me out of that that's what makes you a believer that's what it is for and it's good to say amen and what you do when you say man you say God I know he's speaking I regret what he said but I got to have something personal I need to hear something for you that's something more I agree what he's saying I love what he's saying brother Phil but I gotta hear from God and what right now you're saying isn't something resonating with me I need something more and you know what you do if you had that pull and you keep pulling and all of a sudden something just comes and it just anchors they say well where'd that come from because you you are pulling on the gift that's what you get friends that's what it means that's a personal walk it's an individual walk it's not everyone's getting the same thing no you as an individual are hearing the voice of God individually to you personally and it's just you and him and all of a sudden you might be saying that in that Pew but all of a sudden you recognize that you just been shut off from everything around you your wife ain't sitting there your husband they sitting there nobody's around you it's just you and God and you're just having this personal relationship sitting right there and that person beside you is wondering what they're gonna buy from Walmart and you're in a secret place with God shutting away from everything individually uh forward stammering lips and another tongue will speak to his people to him he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause aware to rest and this is the refreshing this is the rest what is it it's an individual walk it's just you and Christ Alone just by yourself than when your family falls apart you stay solid because your family wasn't in there with you when the church falls apart you sit there solid because the church wasn't in there with you when your health falls apart you sit there solid because your health wasn't in there with you brother Bram talked you know you about the The Boxcar that before it could be sealed the inspector came and he inspected it right he checked everything and then he sealed it closed the door he locked it you know what that inspector wasn't inspecting outside the boxcar he was looking what's inside that was the main thing and when the inside was ready it was ready to go yeah I was sitting watching a train recently go by and you know almost every car had graffiti on it look at your life how much graffiti has been sprayed on your life it might be ugly not calling you ugly but look at all this stuff look at all the scars look at all the things you have on the outside and you roll down the track and you Rattle and you get Creek and all this kind of noise inside everything is just solid everything's been locked away everything is just the way it's supposed to be and you know what the effect of the outside has had on the inside nothing that cargo on the inside is not thinking I wonder how much graffiti is outside I wonder how of what these tracks the to train stuff what if something goes on what if we have a wreck that's not worried about that at all because it knows it's been sealed this is the rest we may cause a way to rest and this is refreshing the words of the spirit working in you from first to the last you know his presence you know his voice Jesus said you know his voice to whom he said this is the rest words we make God's way to rest this is the refreshing and then those brutal words yet they would not brother this morning he said oh I would have hubby you like a mother overseer chicks but you would not they would not accept the rest they would not accept the real the revelation of the word for their day they had to have their own religion they loved their own religion more than their love truth makes them feel special makes them feel holy you can look around the message did you see what I'm talking about yeah they were not but the word of the Lord was unto them preaching upon precept precept upon principle line up online here a little there little that's the same thing it's the same thing it's a message it's the same word they're preaching the same message they think they're preaching what the prophet said they preach out of the same Bible they preach out of the same quotes but they refuse to let it be a work of the spirit it's their own religion that they might go and fall backward be broke snared and taken remember what David said was your way to escape the snares is to be hidden away in that secret place of his presence that's the only way to escape it they're not allowing they're not allowing God to to interpret the word by bringing it to pass they put their own interpretation to it and they present us look what a wonderful group of people we are look what God's doing on this and they do have they have they have signs of what does they absolutely do they have annoying things they have all these things otherwise it will not be deceptive for What's missing is that secret place because they have to look at themselves as a group well we believe this we believe this this is Who We Are Isaiah 30 and 6 he said the birth of the beast of the South into the land of trouble and anguish a land of trouble and anguish from Once come the young and old lion the Viper and fiery's flying serpent they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their Treasures upon the Bunches of camels to a people that shall not profit them so what is then is he's talking to Israel and what they do they're ready to go down and they're still to stay their way out and you know they want to go down and get Egypt to help him he said that Egypt's help shall be in vain to no purpose and they did not trust the Jehovah they did not trust The God Who led him to this place they're not trust me so we're going to load up all our all our treasure our money and we're going to get help from the other some other denomination we're going to help from this church we're going to go and get help from mankind we're going to get help from another religion we're going to get help from the somebody else we're going to lean on our own help our own understanding he said that Egyptians shall help in vain into no purpose there have therefore have I cried concerning this their strength is to sit still man's help is vain you know why so many times your people will run to the pastor brother brother Tom's like this problem got the problem for you and he tells you the word of the Lord and you go out there think of that with just Thomas speaking and your your situation gets worse you say well I don't have any confidence brother Thomas anymore you shouldn't have had it in the beginning your your confidence isn't a gift to God that God placed there that he wanted to speak to you through but you would refuse that he told you because you didn't like what he said trusting in your own ability well I have a better idea than that brother Thomas okay see how that plays out just sit still your strength is to sit still and trust that God's got this all in control he's gonna take take care of it Isaiah 30 15 4 that's it the Lord God the Holy One of Israel in returning and rest shall ye be saved just return to God and rest that's all he's asking you to do return and rest in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength quietness well we need to have a meeting we need to discuss this we need to talk about this we need to someone needs to talk to this person about this someone needs to do this someone needs to do that someone needs to sit still and be quiet Ness and confidence he's got this he's got this friends he got you this far he brought you this far you think he just I'm done with you I'm gonna drop you I'm going to find someone else to play with he don't do that friends quietness and confidence shall be your strength and he would not that human nature I tell you what it's it's a beast it is a beast but he said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shall you we will right up on the Swift therefore shall they that pursue you be Swift heart and ears always resisting and it's the churches who do it it is Psalms 4 4 says stand in awe and sin not commune with your own hand upon your bed and be still you know what that word all means it means when you're stressed you're agitated you're quick and some things are going wrong he said stand there when you're agitated when you're stressed when things are going wrong and sin not you know what sin is it's unbelief what he's saying is dear you're stressed adult situation that's when you need an emotion communion with your heart look at your own heart and say is Christ in here am I Born Again I'm communing my own heart it means to communicate is it is this real what I have is it it's really the holy spirit in me and if it is and I'm gonna sit still and let God handle this situation even though it's stressed me out he said well if I'm at rest how can that be stressed I'm going to get to that in a second hold that thought Psalm 46 be still and know that I am God Be Still if you know he is God then sit still and let him fight for you he is a god of battles he is the one who will deliver you he was the one who will heal you why don't you let him do that but as long as you're fighting the battle he can't help you he can't fight get your hand out of there and you just take the soil and he puts it in her hand and you he gives that word and you start hacking with that word and all it is is faith it's just faith watch him come on the scene and destroy your enemies oh man how many of you could stand here and give testimony after testimony and when God has come in your life when you're at your wits in you did not know what to do and all of a sudden he shows up front on time and he sets you free oh man we've been here all day giving the testimonies of that and yet the next time something comes along what did we do two modes as they get to this red scene oh God what are we gonna do now why are you crying to me speak and go forward haven't I commissioned you this haven't I commissioned you to go in the Rapture haven't I ordained it on the Rapture now why are you whining about what you crying about speak and go forward speak to that devil kick him in the and then walk over him as you're heading for the rapture Jesus said this in Matthew 11 28 come unto me all you that labor and a heavy laden I will give you rest you know what we're Laden with your heavy laborers our religion it's our religion it's our legalistic religion I'm trying so hard to be a Christian I'm trying so hard to be good I'm trying to quit doing this I'm trying to quit doing that you're resisting the Holy Ghost you stiff-necked message believer because you don't believe that he will do what he said he will do commune with your own heart is something in there pulling you is this God talking to you is this God doing this or is this just your own effort from your mind so my yoke is easy he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me I am making lowly in heart there's that quieted spirit I am meek and lowly I don't exercise much well brother Phil I can tell you all about the Seven Seals I can tell you about the seven Thunders I can tell you all about well can you tell me about the tribulation period because that's where you're going to be with that attitude making lowly and hard quieted you shall find rest into your soul for my yoke is easy my burden is like yeah there's a yoke there's a burden what you have to do you have to believe what he tells you that's your battle but it's not your own works if your yoke is heavy if it's burdensome it's because you're trying to be a believer we're still trying I don't know what time I got out here Satan will use your trials to prove to you that you're not at rest if you're really at rest why are you so Torah if you really at rest why so much stress you can't even sleep sometime at night because this is bothering you that if you arrest what's that all about y'all remember the story of the shunamite woman she couldn't have a kid she had prayed about it countless times getting older her husband was really old she had resigned herself to the fact that I'm not going to have a child but then the prophet came along like and she said she said to her husband by the way Bob says she's a great woman strong woman all these people out in the world they want to say I'm a strong woman I want you to take your example from her she's a strong woman she said let's build him a little room let's do something for him she did Elisha said what does she need is anything I can do she said no nothing I'm good I'm happy to be here she had resigned herself to the fact that I got my husband we're gonna get old we're going to die I'm not gonna have a child yeah hazy told us you don't have a child get uh Elijah said this time next year you're going to have a child and she basically said this said don't deceive me don't tease me like that I've already given up on that he said no but you're gonna have it she wasn't asking for it anymore she had resigned herself she had quieted herself this is God's will child came along can you imagine what it must have been like for that child he had Parents treating him like grandparents you know they did they spoiled that kid they got him everything they could just as happy and then he died what kind of a god would do that you would resign yourself okay I'm not going to have this child he comes on and said because you've been so good to my Prophet I'm gonna give you a child and then he takes him away ask Abraham she called into her husband and said send me I pray to one of the young men one of the asses on my run to God and come again he said wherefore will thy God then today it is neither new moon or Sabbath he had resigned he said what's the point let's just go to church let's go continue what we're doing she said I she said she said it shall be well she told her husband it shall be well well that means peace she said I'm going to have peace then she sat on an ass and said his servant drive and go forward slack not die writing except that baby she she went and came into the man of God to account Mount Carmel came to pass on the man of God saw her far off he said to go Haze his servant behold the Honors that shooting might run now I prayed thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with me is it will thy son is it thy husband as well with thy child she answered it as well we sing that song all is well we'll look at her as a hero we'll look at her look what she did her son had this situation that is described and God had taken that ripped her very hard out of her and yet she confessed all as well what a great woman that is not the end of the story and she came near the man of God to the hill she caught him by the feet because it came near to thrust your way and the man of God said leave her alone for her soul is vexed that word means bitter and the Lord had hid for me and hath not told me so we look at that we say well she must have been shouting and dancing I said all is well all is well wonderful I'm just so no no no no no she was acting just the way you would if you lost your 12 year old kid she was grieving bitterly she was tore up she couldn't sleep she had to run she had to get to the man of God and that worked her her testimony from my believer's heart was as well I have peace she said all is well I have peace in this situation but I'm bitter in my spirit I'm my mind is tore up and then she said to him did I desire a son of my Lord she said did I ask for this did I ask you give him I had to resigned myself I wasn't gonna have one and I said didn't I say do not deceive me play with me this way don't tell me I'm gonna have this because I resigned myself and then you gave him anyways and then you rip them away from me that my friend is where she was when she said all is well do you have that same testimony when everything's falling apart and you lost this one and your kids are doing whatever and things are just gone and the doctor said you got three weeks to live or your wife has cancer whatever and you look at that and you say I'm bitter in my spirit and I'm seeking God I say God what's going on and yet something inside just anchors there and say I have peace in the midst of this storm do you have that peace is that something that's real or is that something that you wish you had why don't you be honest with yourself just because you're in that secret place does not mean you don't have storms now David said in the midst of trouble that's when I seek that secret place that's what I had to get along with God that's why I got to get in there and find the answers that's when I had to get there and even when he don't answer Elijah says I don't even God has a told me what this is about and sometimes God doesn't tell you and sometimes you're going through something can you pray and you're praying and pray and he seems to be in miles away and you're going through a desert time he seems to be miles away he's thinking I gotta get an answer from God and you come to church and sure that he's gonna give it to you and he say silent and something else goes on and you're going a little further and you pray and you pray and he still sit silent brother Brown said that's when you need to be certain of God what is it that you know that he did this in your heart and if he did that one time that's all it takes he didn't do that and leave he can't leave you aren't sealed away he's never going to leave you he's just testing you to see if you gonna still say all is well because what he's proven to you is that well you have the goods he's proven to you that down his side that thing is still there it's not just to really just uh just a religion you have but if those tests prove that you are a Believer do you understand that do you see how how important those tests are those trials those Hard Times those troubles is because it proves to you who you are that's what it's about um he don't Vex you he don't call this just to do it he has a purpose you don't do it just for something to do David said this he said Psalm 10. why standeth thou far off O Lord why do you hide yourself in time and trouble you ever felt that well friends if he's always right there with you what kind of trouble would you have he has to do that he has to do that because if every time that a trouble came along his presence was just around you there's no trial there's no faith to that and so you have to look back and remember as many times he said when they came out of Egypt he said I'm gonna fight for remember what I did bring you out for Egypt remember what I did for you remember how I dealt with you here remember but right now I don't see you that's when you say all is well because you're still in that secret place though you don't feel like it Psalm 13. how long will you forget me Lord forever how long will I hide that face from me how long shall I take counseling my soul having sorrow my heart daily how long shall my enemy exalt over me consider and hear me oh Lord my God lighten my knives unless I sleep to sleep with death unless enemies say I have prevailed against him those that trouble me rejoice David's going through a hard time they've been through a lot of hard times but then he said but I have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation I will sing unto the Lord because he has dealt Bountiful in me bountifully with me in the midst of the trouble he said I'm still going to praise you I'm still going to go to church I'm still good still going to worship I'm still gonna say am I still gonna believe what you're doing because I know that you brought me this far and you promised to take me the rest of the way really quick I got two more things I want to look at in Song of Solomon the situations where talking about this truth that's the type of the Bride this this woman in here of course and so song was Solomon verse three I'm going to hurry up real quick so he said by night I uh By Night on my bed I saw him whom I so loveth I saw him but I found him not so here she is she is his bride she knows him at that secret place and she's there in bed and she's resting she's where she's supposed to be she's resting but in that place of rest sure her soul sought him but I couldn't find him he wasn't there I couldn't seem to pray through he seemed to be a long ways off and I just love and my soul lover that she knew that she was what we call born again this is a Believer this is the bride [Music] but he's withdrawn himself she said I will rise now and go about the city and the streets and in the broad ways I was seeking whom my soul loveth I saw him but I found him not she's going to church she's going where she's supposed to be she's seeking him she wants it she's longing for this and then it says the Watchmen these are God sent ministers The Watchmen that go about the city found me they found money to whom I said saw you him whom I so loveth she's inquiring at his Temple she had come to the temple she said where is this guy I need a hold of him and the ministers were there and then it said it was but a little that I passed from them but I found him whom I so loveth what was it they had pointed her the way you were going to find Christ there he is right there see that altar that's where you'll find him but she had passed from them why because it wasn't her in the pastor it wasn't her in the minister it wasn't her and her family it was her all by herself you don't get to him by someone else with someone else going to when Rebecca come to Isaac it was Rebecca and Isaac in the tent it wasn't Rebecca and Isaac and Elias it wasn't Iraq and Isaac and and her mother-in-law it wasn't anything like that it was just those two and that's the way you're going to find Christ is when it's just you and him alone do you dare trust him to go there by yourself as soon as you found him should I held him would not let him go until I brought him into my mother's house into the Chamber of her that conceived me she hold on tight brother and sister she had such a thirst she knew him she loved him but there was a time when he wanted a deeper walk a more intimate walk with her and so he spurred that thirst inside and said why don't you come seek me seek me I got more of me to show you I got more I want to show you I want to show you my I want a deeper relationship with you foreign chapter five verse two same woman I sleep but my heart awaketh it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh behold I stand at the door not will you answer will you let me in but see she was asleep she wasn't not just resting she had gone to sleep she was satisfied not because he said what's my beloved that knock of saying open to me my sister my love my dad my undefined for my head is filled with Dew and my locks with the drops of the night what's he doing he'd been out exposed to not hit going on he was looking forward he's knocking here he's knocking there he said well someone opened to me well someone opened to me and he couldn't find it because all he was running to was false bride and people who sells sounds like I don't need this anymore I don't need the message of the art it's not true anyways he's looking for shelter where does he look for shelter the same place where you look for shelter because brother and sister that shall just finds us with you it's with you he Longs for that rest with you that's what he brought you here for so he could answer you so he could find out pipes of rest he said where's the place of my rest it's right there in you he wants to come to you he wants you to provide that that shelter to him that's why he provides it to us friends trying to hurry too much let me slow down you give him purpose the bride gives him purpose for being the whole thing was to get to this bride right here so he can marry you friends this is what his purpose is but she said I have put off my coat how should I put it on I have washed my feet how shall I defile them oh look at this laodice seeing spirit I'm Justified I've never done it I'm undefiled I'm pure I'm holy I have need of nothing she's been influenced by that spirit do I have to get up do I have to defile myself do I have to get dirty why don't I just sit and lay in my bed and just rest because he has something more for you self-satisfied she's complacent I preach I sing I go to church I pay my tithes I live a good life I live in Christ in my life I'm just sitting here waiting for the rapture you know what goes into Rapture the only thing brother Raph said the only thing that goes there is perfect love and you might have all these other things in place but if God's looking for more of you he wants more love he wants that perfect love to come in to manifest to express that love to you that's what he's trying to get us to do and we can sit back there and be complacent in our labor to see and age and be the bride of Christ and still be influenced by that have need of nothing what's missing it's a perfect love my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door my bounds will move for me for him she loved him friends she knew him she died wrongs to open to my beloved my hands dripped with myrrh my fingers were sweet smelling Miracle on the hand of the luck look how impressed she was with her own religion look how old I am look at the worship I have just me and God together I opened my to my beloved but my beloved hands withdrawn himself was gone my soul failed when he spoke I saw him I could not find him I caught him but he gave no answer withdrawn himself The Watchmen that went about the city found me this time they smote me they wounded me the keepers of the water away my veil from me she needed chastening this is when she came to church and this the preacher just skinned her High said use don't you sit there in that Pew be complacent don't sit there thinking well I got it all all together I'm ready to go on the Rapture friends if you ever get to that point recognize that you are heavily influenced by the wrong Spirit by religious layout of sin Spirit when you come to church you should have such a thirst for more of God you said when you're going about your day there's a thirsty and there's some not something you put in yourself don't work it up or I'm gonna thirst for God no you're not you're gonna make yourself miserable what you're going to do is you're going to get all that other junk out of the way so that thirst can come through and draw you to God because that's the way the bride is she just wants more of him she just wants to know him more it's that thirst in this and Devil's trying to get you to to lukewarm to just calm down and just like well I'm good to go he said it is a place of restaurant it is a place of rest but it's in that love it's not in some lukewarm complacent attitude she said I charge you all Daughters of Jerusalem if you find my beloved that you tell him that I am sick of love which means she can't she's just growing crazy she's losing her mind let me read you this one more quote he said there's something brother Braham says he said something beyond the villiana that pulls a Christian he can't explain it he don't understand it himself but there's something in that Fellowship that he had with Christ sever him from there he becomes a Wonder a Wonder listen morning if you're wondering am I Born Again do I love him this way is this for me if you're wondering like that if you're a struggling maybe you've been a Christian for years maybe you're just young it doesn't matter friends you can't explain this but I'm telling you is you kind of you can't you can't bring yourself there you can't put yourself in that place it's something God does he draws you to it it's it's beyond your ability friends you can't understand what's going on but yet you know that God has pulled you like brother said you'll feel that pull friends friends if if you are born again that pool is still there it doesn't go away that makes sense it doesn't go away you're still there if you have that then you're one of the Blessed people in the world because so many people are just satisfied pray for him [Music] people are satisfied with their religion and they come to church and they're satisfied with their religion but the bride of Christ never gets satisfied she doesn't say oh I got all I need of God now I have everything I need no sir she keeps praying she keeps seeking him because love is pulling her into constraining her let's pray Lord Jesus we're so grateful you come this morning and speak to us we're so grateful that you would just have your way Among Us Lord Jesus won't you come now Lord just let your spirit just water this word let it have its effect that each heart needs from you Lord Jesus just have it have your way now Lord we just want to we want to know you more we want to know this as a reality not just
