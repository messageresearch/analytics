upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and to the glory of God the Father for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure this one together that you may be blameless and harmless the sons

you brother Tommy the Lord came down Wednesday real good didn't he amen I'll tell you what I just enjoyed myself and amen I I had a quote yesterday I pulled up where brother Bram says you know I guess it's okay for a preacher to to Worship the Lord while he's preaching he says sometimes I just feel like Scrump jumping and screaming and uh like I could fly almost I'm like wow that's what I thought I was doing with I thought I could almost fly and it's nice to be able to read a quote where you know you're on the right track you know amen and so brother benon felt the same way that he was just so excited he said because of the change that God has made in his heart amen and so God is good isn't he I truly believe I truly believe with all of my heart that amen um there's a work that God is doing amen how many knows God didn't quit when the prophet left God did not quit he's not quitting amen and there's something going on and we know as the world comes to a climax we know the bride's coming to a climax the people of God are coming to a climax amen and I don't know about you but I feel something moving in me I hope you have that same testimony I feel something moving in me something moved you to come to church this morning amen amen and we want to look at that again tonight I mean this morning we want to just continue on a little bit further on our thought and our series of eternal life amen and and remember I preached the seron series a little bit on on uh what it is to be a Christian and what it means to be a Christian right right well this is really the same thing amen eternal life and what it means to have eternal life and as I begin to look at this I realize how how little life touched on it you know and so with godself we just want to touch on it a little bit more amen praise just soar in the heavenlies amen so to speak amen so I trust that you come with hearts of expectation we certainly look forward to what God's going to do in his people and we're just so glad to be part of God amen amen God God just giving a real Revelation to my heart that you know we know that one day he's going to sit on the throne ain't that right the Throne of David in a millennium for a thousand years he's going to be king ain't that right amen but we realize that he's already King to us amen he's already our King we're in a kingdom he's our King and when we come to the house of God you come to worship that King in spirit any truth it's not fictitious it's not just uh you know imaginary it's spiritual but it's real and the way that we worship Him Now is the way we're going to worship him over [Applause] there amen how many knows that we're looking for Redemption we're looking to have this body redeemed but yet the inner man he's already redeemed amen Christ The Mystery of God revealed but B talks about how that you know that God is bringing a word amen in this Eve there's no um um what did he say he no respector of persons he says God is no respector of persons if Eve amen disbelieve one word and she caus all this chaos he says God won't let us back in unless we believe every word amen and God has restored that word so that we can believe every word and how many believe that it is restoring us to a pre Fallen [Music] condition sure we are how many knows brother says man every rights that Adam lost we have those rights again we have been spiritually restored the only thing we're waiting on is this right here this is the only thing we're waiting to change we're not waiting or looking for nothing else to change because he's already making that change on the inside amen we're so glad amen that he told us who we are the I am told us who we are are amen so this morning with the help of the Lord if you'll stand amen we'll just go before the Lord in prayer before we get start Lord Jesus we come before you Lord thankful thankful God that your word has promised us that if we would just completely yield ourselves to you Lord that you would live out through out through us your own life and we ask God that you have the preeminence against Lord in the service we don't know which way you'll go or just what you'll say father we don't expect services to be the same we know you you do different things sometimes we just God come and expect the unexpected Lord but father most of all we just want to welcome you to come and to speak to our hearts again Lord father we stand here to present ourselves before you we come into the house of judgment that's the prophet of God he said I read where he said that the very this is he said this is the Throne of God this is the Judgment House of Judgment of God and we come to see where our bad places are so we can go from here and change those bad places in our lives and and father to be judged with Mercy Lord we ask God this morning that you'll just have your perfect way now Lord use my mind use my heart use my lips and every part of me father that I might not say something out of the way or in myself Lord but it was just be your Holy Spirit doing it we ask it in Jesus name we also remember brother Joe Lord that sickness is really hanging on Lord and we believe God that by his by your stripes he is healed this morning Father there's any other sick Lord we claim them in Jesus name healing little Elena Lord she got these little bumps on her father we rebuke that thing in the name of Jesus and believe that it'll clear up father thank you for touching brother Brad Lord we God we know that it's just your healing power others that have been sick Lord You're touching Lord and we're so grateful for it now Lord help us to lay aside the cares of life let us even Forget About Time Lord and just enter into eternity in your spirit now father and may you have your way in Jesus name amen and amen amen if you will turn your Bibles this morning amen we're certainly looking forward to next weekend aren't we Amen brother Iran and Martha having a little get together there Saturday night amen we tried to let them know we plan on being there amen looking forward to coming over that way again amen and being with them and brother Joe Adams of course amen how many will pray for brother Joe to get a couple turkeys Amen brother B said God cares whether you get game or not amen and so amen we pray he'll have a good time amen and that also that God will just lay on his heart Amen to speak to our hearts amen the thing that we have need of how many believe that God speaks through the spirit to his church still amen I truly believe that Revelations if you will all the way over into the Book of Revelations the fourth chapter amen this morning I want to talk about The Throne of God the Throne of God amen amen chapter 4 verse one after this I looked and behold a door was opened Heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were a of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon as Jasper and sardine stone if I'm not wrong it is the first tribe of Israel and the last tribe of Israel if I'm not wrong amen and those names represented a certain Stone amen and there was a rainbow round about The Throne inight like unto an emerald amen rainbow how many knows that always represents a covenant amen how is glad to be in an unconditional Covenant God said he would do it and he's going to do it amen and round about The Throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats was four and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold amen praise the Lord how many believes how many knows what gold represents deity amen eternal life how many believes will have be had given Paul said a crown of eternal life amen and out of the throne proceed Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like unto Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind amen now notice what these beasts look like amen and the first Beast was like a l Lion and the second beast like a calf the third Beast like the face of a man and the fourth Beast like unto a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them and they were full of eyes Within and they rest not day nor night saying holy holy holy can we say holy holy holy holy unto the Lord God Almighty which was and which is and which is to come and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the 4 and20 Elders fell down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever and cast crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created may God add His blessings to the reading of the word this morning amen what it means to have eternal life amen amen what it means perfectly eternal life amen praise the Lord amen so we want to think about this for just a minute with the help of the Lord today what it's all about what happens this Throne amen first I want to say this that I read this heard brother B say this week talking about how that when the bride recognizes who she is amen the Rapture would take place amen and I got to thinking about how you know that things happen when you recognize things amen uh this just comes to my mind I ain't got it wrote down but I believe it is it's talked about you know having eyes they see you know even though they have eyes yet they see not is that right ears they hear not least at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and they would be converted and I would heal them so how many knows that when your eyes open when your ears open there's a transformation that takes place amen the First Transformation that takes place is that new birth now brother bam said you know that we were saved 2,000 years ago ain't that right 2,000 years ago one place and another place of course we always was saved in the mind of God it just depends on how far back you want to go amen because we know that at Calvary that that price was paid is't that right that's where the purchase power was is when the he died at Calvary he paid for your salvation amen and so amen and he says you know it's about recognizing who you are amen and you never was saved on a certain day now you and I can take it to the time we can take it to the place I could take the philippy creek I could take you to amen down there in Florida amen and and think about all of that you know but you realize you brothers and sisters that you just recognized who you are that you're Son of God you're a daughter of God that he saved you 2,000 years ago you just recognized it you just come to it and when that happened there's a transformation that took place how many believe we need Transformations you know I got to thinking about that transword and it was like oh boy oh boy a lot of trans going on in this world isn't that right people are transing into this they're transing into that well let me tell you something the bride of Christ is transing into Christ amen it's not going to be her anymore but it's going to be him living in her she becomes him amen but why is that that all that's yourself is dead and it's Christ in you now no wonder the prophet could get so excited that he thought he could fly and then when he realized when you recognize who you really are it talks about he says and I will be there his God and he shall be my son you know we every people people are thinking about well when I get over there I'll be saved and I'll be God's child be God Son no you're God's son you're God's daughter now now are we Sons and Daughters of praise be to God there's something that happens when you recognize who you are that you're Eagle you hear this scream huh screaming don't bother Eagles Eagles scream I've never heard of a eagle sparking never heard of Eagle clucking he's always screaming can't make it sound I think brother Brad didn't you make it sound the other day he did pretty good I don't know that's the best I can do sounds like a caling right he needed to laugh need to lighten you up for what's coming amen oh oh my but that's right something aren't you glad aren't you glad that something happened in your life oh folks oh you want something deep deep deep deep I'm telling you something deep something happened you got Bor again amen the old man died and now you are a new creature in Christ your affections are on things above amen and the things of this world don't mean so much to us amen our jobs our money our fin all of that it's taking second place amen how many know but Jesus said you know seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness don't put that second put that [Applause] first amen that's what a Believer does it's first foremost praise be to God when we just grasp let me just say something else that comes to mind you know there's some powerful things the prophet talked about in in Christ the mystery how to the how that the uh the bride becomes one with him is that right the church is going to be so much like him in order to be United there's so many prophecies there's so many quotes so many things amen that we and I believe that we've got to come to yet amen he didn't just say nothing things for the church to go the other way he said those things because there's going to be a people that is without spot that is without rinkle that believe every word that when he comes they're going to be [Music] ready let me tell you something as the pastor of this church I can't do nothing I could try manufacture something I could try to do do this that or the other but it wouldn't do no good would it how many believe it's about what the Holy Spirit does it's about what go God does that's important cuz when he does something you don't want to be caught fighting against it cuz you're either on one side or on the other you either for or you're against it you can't stand in between we've come through hell and high waters reason I said hell is because I've got a quote here says it this way now a days they don't even believe in saying Hell in the Pulpit I believe in saying Hell in the Pulpit amen oh mercy we need men of God men who won't hold back amen my when you think about it you become I want to talk about the New Birth just a little bit can I because it leads to this you recognize who you are that you are now sons of God not will be brother say but you are now sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him amen he that hath his hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure am amen when God accepts the sacrifice of your repentance amen is that right when you genuinely repent God accepts that sacrifice comes down with the Holy Ghost and he consumes that sacrifice he accepts it then listen to this the first Throne was in heaven judgment seat the second Throne was in Christ the third Throne is in man remember when John the Baptist seing the spirit of God like a dove coming down on Jesus is that right in Jesus dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily let me tell you something when you genuinely repent when God accepts your repentance there's a dove that better come down are you with me there's a spirit that better come down but the B said whenever that Spirit come down on Jesus Christ Heaven and Earth kissed each other they embraced each other amen and when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost Heaven and Earth kiss each other they Embrace each other God has come down to man he's come down to you I can't tell you enough God is now not up there on that Throne anymore but he's on the throne of your heart w wow W I could almost preach are you ready I might as well get ahead of myself mother B says now we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in the last days with his glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are the proof of his victory know he died he he went to Gethsemane and he wept and he fought and he fought out the battle he went to Calvary took the stri am me went all the way to Hell amen and he took that last R into hell grabbed the keys of death Hell In The Grave amen coming up mighty and triumphant amen and he gave us the keys he gave come and dwell right in here and now just as two fighters would come into an octagon and they would be scared of each other and just says

the dancing and shouting and everything else and he sat there oh my look what they have done to my church look out there tearing it up look at the mess making he says you know I wonder if there's a scripture for it ain't that a good question to ask folks we would probably have a lot quieter Church brother Tommy we have a lot quieter worship if it wasn't for the fact that he pulled it right out of the Bible and said well I guess Miriam whenever they got the victory she took a tambourine and began to dance up and down amen and all the sisters of Israel they begin to scream and shout why because they had some victory Heen how many doar this morning oh I just don't feel like that I don't feel like sh maybe you need some more Victory maybe you need to but have some victory in your life Brother Brad by the time we get finished living the inner Veil living the inner Veil The holies of holies where's it I it's back there keep that for me with you brother Brad the in oh it has to do with the Throne of go but then not not just to be in the outer cour not just to be in a Justified State find a place for that I'm not sure where you gonna put it there you go right there's good Hallelujah say man there's people that are come to church Glory but there're still out here in the outer courts they come they may be repentant and so forth they go back out the next day the first rain that comes first tire that bows for problem Oh I tell you what I just I don't guess I had it man that makes me so mad lose your temple temper is that right next guy comes all the way into here amen what a CH kind of Glory or where the candlesticks are amen he's got sanctification he's a whole lot better off is that right but guess what those candlesticks have to be LD they have to be run they have to be oh that's right we had a Revival last week we went to the youth camp and I'm telling you why we was fired up it was awesome but we come back home and it all smokes up we feel D and blue and sad on is that okay oh we had a wonderful time Wednesday but today we're back down Sad and Blue maybe we're living in the wrong court maybe we need to get in the back of the back where that you of Glorious amen I'll tell you what it never gets them it never gets low it's always shining bright on that Throne where God is do you realize I feel this with I'm a place you know why I feel so good because the Bible says that heated amen if the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead amen dwell in you it'll also cck and this Bal body if you want to more life get more the Holy Ghost it'll do something for you it'll cause you to worship God the way you're going to worship God over there it's on the sounds like thunder let me catch my breath go ahead brother bad you got five minutes give me a break here but you know what you What's happen Church of God I don't care if it's dnie raged I don't care if it's who it is better Joe any of them fall down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy amen it's not about me it's not about the preachers it's about what God has done and I want you to know that he gets all the glory he gets all the praise all the power all the strength anything that we are it's all him ain't one of us great it's him that's great and that's the hour we're living in folks we're living in the fight It's Time s to fall down and worship him said God when I get over there I'm going to fall down and see you're worthy Lord you're worthy Lord to receive H and glory and power and strength I wouldn't have nothing if it wasn't [Music] [Applause] [Music] you might as well get used to it you're going to fall down there might want to fall down here a time or two time to recognize who's worthy of the glory it's him that he is all and in all and it's all for his glory his honor his praise that's why the devil he wanted some praise and glory himself that's why when you find a man trying to get some glory and praise to himself it's a devil it's evil it ain't God Amen we don't need no glory of ourselves he's worthy of all glory praise be to God Amen but I thought about that oh my we are the evidence of his victory how many believe what did Paul say I thank God I thank Jesus who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ he did the battle how many know I didn't have to have nails put on my side I didn't have to have capital punishment I didn't have to die the flesh he did that for me he overcome death Hell In The Grave you didn't have to fight it he fought it and he gives you the victory can I say if people reject that they deserve to go to hell somebody rejects something that free God so rich in love that he writes kan's pardon he write every one of Cain's children a pardon is that right whosoever will let him come is that right whoo he invited them all for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe him should not perish but have everlasting life we understand the depth of that we understand the depth of God in his understanding he knew who wouldn't and KN he knew who would he realized that say something that means go ahead you know if God would have seen that not one not one human being wanted it not one I want to ask you a real spiritual question would he have come would he have come if he knew nobody's accepted well somebody correct me if I'm wrong but I say he wouldn't have cuz God God don't brother B God don't run a half shod job if he does something he knows there's somebody that's going to want some amen would be fighting the air but he knew if just one would I believe he said if were just one would if he' to come all the way from glory for that one person aren't you glad that he did he came all the way from Glory cuz he knew you would want to receive it you would want Grace you would want him that's who he came for for the ones that did want him for he knew he would they would want [Applause] him amen praise be to God so what happens in the New Birth is is that God comes down and Thrones himself the third Throne the place where his throne is is your heart see men and women they live a good life and love God go to church and all these things by mental conception huh other words there's a but that's not where it is isin't that right but the real hiding place is in the heart when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is with you with your temperment he's living his own life through his own will through you I want to stop there amen listen to this he says now the devil chose a man's head to control for his control tower but God CHS his heart ain't that right he makes him see things look through his eyes but yet God in his heart makes him believe things that he cannot see see God is on his heart and in the heart of man is the Throne of God you get it God made his throne in the heart of man folks you're not just a church member not just a so-call believer you're inhabiting God is inhabiting your very being you are the Throne of God and out of your heart comes thundering and voes and lightnings right come on you ready for me to preach listen to this amen listen notice now brother B the Revelation chapter 1 if you ever want to go back and study it the voice off the throne notice the throne before their Throne there was seven stars the voice of the Stars oh my I'm getting ahead of myself you see there was more in Revelations 4 he says and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and Thunders and voices not just one voice but voices plural what is it God speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits and when a true anointing of God speaks it's the voice of [Applause] God I mean know when a minister even a child of God Son and Daughter of God speaking to somebody in the streets or wherever you might be when you're anointed to speak it it's not yet but it's God's voice there was voices did but bam say in the Judgment there was a voice of many Waters what was this voice it's the voice of the minister that's cried out to the people in every age standing there saying come the voice is cry up come to Christ come to come from the highways and the hedges come unto me flee to that Throne come back to the throne come back to God that's the voice that's going out W think about it folks this is the hour this is the time that God is crawling he's calling thund out amen before I go deeper into that I want to bring go back and kind of lay Little Foundation here how many loves the Lord amen this is be a real good study so now notice he talks about when he talks about The Throne of God he's preaching on the throne and I think Revelations first chapter not first chapter but the first sermon he did on Revelations 4 he says if you'll notice and he talks about Israel let's talk about The Throne here's where God dwelt and look here's a tribe North West South every side had a little canvas down here didn't show any over there but they had four tribes each on each side of God guarding it nobody comes to here unless you go through these tribes is it right so all four of them if you'll notice Dan is the head of three tribes Judah is the head of three tribes Reuben is the head of three tribes Eep is the head of three tribes that's 12 see Judah remember he said that in the throne there was four beasts one was a lion one was a ox one was a man one was a uh flying eagle Dan represented the lion Reuben the man Ephraim an ox and Dan an eagle that right so you think about that and then also without reading all of this notice how he says that brother bam oh boy let me see here the lion what brother bam said this was Matthew Ox Mark man Luke Eagle John all of them pointing you and guarding the place where God is and that's guarding the book of Acts and that right and they were all actually pointing to he said but say acts 230 cuz that's the way to get to God that's why repent everyone of you and they're all saying that repent amen that repentance and remissions of sins should be preached in his name beginning at Jerusalem and oh the Glorious thing my Revelation this morning is this amen that you know even the Tabernacle in the wilderness was a type of what was over there so I'm not saying that nothing's over there I don't know what all is over there but you know that brother said the third Throne is here in the heart of man and listen wasn't it exactly right that God used those four anointings and where are those four anointing coming forth from the throne which is in PE people and you and I are experiencing and manifesting the coming forth of the eagle age it flies higher than any other bird that anointing is coming forth from the on if you're not anointed this morning there's something wrong with you I think we can all admit that we would prefer a preacher that's anointed I like preaching under the anointing because I'll be honest with you sometimes I feel like I never leave the ground huh I'm here to tell you something it's the devil's business to keep us grounded when you come to church it's his business to give you all kinds of attitude and problems from Wednesday to Sunday so the time you get here you can't get what you got Wednesday so you'll sit there and not get nothing it doesn't matter how much the anointing is up here you've got to be anointed so now you see what I'm saying about it's the very third Throne of God Amen Better B I believe it was in the token he also in the token and also in Christ mystery he says that you and I become the blood of Jesus Christ because of the Spirit that's on the inside so the blood is where on the throne it's right there in your heart we are the blood for the people your mercy for the people your grace for the people your love for the people the raise and The Shining of the throne amen coming forth out of the church that's what evening like Tabernacle is to be is not about building a bigger Church a prettier Church having the bigger crowd it's about manifesting Jesus Christ it's about being Al light to your community it's about being life where you work at it's about reflecting Christ reflecting the throne the eagle AG I'm telling you there'll be a voices come out of that Throne saying glory and honor and power amen you'll hear amen you'll hear Hallelujah coming forth from the [Music] throne aren't you glad do you get a little glimpse of why the prophet has said you should be the happiest people [Music] place thank you thank you for praying thank you for you being in the right place because like I told everybody Wednesday I couldn't preach like this if you wasn't pulling didn't says when you say sick when you say amen amen mean sing them well what about preaching what about hallelujah what yeah yeah that's right any one of those things is a shake them the Holy Ghost loves when you respond to his word God loves when you say Amen to what he says amen means yes honey yes dear yes my love yes my Lord yes amen that's coming fresh from the throne so you see where these things look like they're in heaven don't they these lion and ox and all of these things looks like they're up there no they're right there in your heart even those Thunders are in you let's preach on Thunders for a minute I like thunder boom wake everybody up thunder lightning praise be to God all right now we're ready to pick up where we left off amen amen listens that's right when the true anointing of God speaks it's the voice of God and to reject it what's coming forth salvation Mercy Grace and judgment judgment to reject it to reject Mercy you have to accept his judgment is that right that's what's for coming forth now from the throne amen praise be to God right after that listen to what he says the the voices candlesticks these seven candlesticks voices the voice of the seven Church ages the voices speak with thunder and lightning nowadays they're so well we don't believe in saying Hell in the Pulpit oh mercy we need men of God who will hold not hold back not that everybody can be a preacher but you got a voice if you can't preach a Ser the people sermon uh if he says if you're a pre prer you're called to the preaching the pulpit if you're not you're still a [Applause] preacher everybody's a preer you got to forgive me I just mix my worship and my preaching together is that all right brother BR says I guess it's right all right for a preacher to worship so I got my permission Worship in spirit and Truth Now listen all right so that's right listen you're if you're not a you're still a preacher but live the people of sermon let your sermon be Liv amen they say nobody can put a finger on his life or her [Music] life wo now let me just say something how many knows and all of us probably have done things that we're ashamed of in our past as Christians your pastor has was still there and I'm so glad that God causes us to repent of no things aren't you glad cuz none of us would probably be in church amen if we'd say I never did that but we need the grace of God we all need the grace of God Amen but this morning if nothing else say God let me go out there and let me try to live my best to where nobody could put a finger and say look at that that ain't quite right look at that that ain't quite right we could stop and have an altar call right now I wonder how many would be guilty that's right I still got a little a little bit too much of a foot I've done better but I still go over that speed limit I do try not to though I I'm saying God help me amen what about others I'm just saying that for me what about you don't just look at me look at yourself what's your problem all right let's get back into the Heavenly shall we before we hurt somebody's foot that's right but I thought my look at that so he that's right my finger on her or his life if there ever was a man of God it's that man and that woman

cover themselves you know something else about the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I talk about the evil of the the flesh amen is all the idolatry all these different Wicked evil many many different

Infidel man that right I don't believe in them go God he says them preachers are barking up the wrong tree a representing a that is a lying dog he's barking up the tree and there ain't nothing up there that's what he said to brother Bri ain't nothing up there amen Thunder he begin to tell him about and that man he says something there is a man that I would like to talk to though he said because I had a neighbor ain't that right a neighbor woman and she went to a certain meeting and that man called her out and me they brought the handkerchief I believe back and they laid it on her she

that is free is free in need that's free in need let those ches fall let the worshippers arise and begin to worship God like never before cuz we're fixing the worship like never before over there we might as well do it over [Applause] here when we think about what he did amen about who he is amen I like that that's the Thunder that shakes the devil amen where's the Holy Spirit here here at the throne shining out in each Church age where is that Throne right there Brothers you can come here brother Brad if you want to hug the Throne of God just give you brother hug of God isin't that right very Throne of God should we go a little further let's go a little further all right let's see what happens let's see what happened Ephesians EP Ephesians 1 and verse we're going to have to save a little time so I'm going to go forward just a little bit chapter 1 verse 20 wh which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places fire above all principality and power and and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body to fullness of him filth all in all every time I've ever read the scriptures I've always imagined it that he's some far distance I know he he's out there in that seventh Dimension but my God can be at the same place at two places at the same time I said my God can be in two places at the same time amen and I always imagine him way out there above all principality above all power but listen in chapter 2 verse 5 it says even when when we were dead in sins has he quickened us together with Christ and has raised us up together and made us to in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so wherever he is I am and wherever I am he is and that day you will know that I am in my father my father is in me I am in you and you are in me this is the day that we recognize who we are is it today we recognize where we are we it today we recognize where God is yes this is it woo a't that something the throne is in your heart it's in my heart how's it going is that a good question to ask so how's it going with the throne being on your heart is there Mercy coming out blessed are the mercy for they shall uptain Mercy if any has a quarrel against any forgive them even as Christ also forgave you amen there's lots of Mercy on his Mercy Seat how many believe that that Mercy Seat is right down your heart amen giving the world Mercy that's right blessed are the merciful let me come to a close on this I want to I still haven't finished Philippians talking about the nature of God I many knows that when the Holy Spirit isn't there and Faith virtue knowledge the temperance of God is coming for us that forth from us isn't that right the very patience we have patience with each other we have longsuffering with each other we have gentleness meekness humility we can humble ourselves all these things that the fruit of the spirit second Peter 1 Galatians 5 both comes forth springing water coming forth A River of Life coming forth out of the throne oh my Lord give us more Revelation on sea of glass clear as Crystal how manyan notice there's no Mucky Waters in the word of God there's no well I don't know for sure it's about the word of God it's Crystal Clear water flowing from our teenagers at school Wherever You Are they see the reflection of Christ that water comes flowing out amen do watch some videos on people out there preaching to the trans and everybody else and they come up hateful as all get out saying all the Christians are the most terrible people hateful people he says no if anybody's truly a Christian they're gonna love everybody Jesus says love one another that's what we're promoting is that Jesus loves you yet they're hating back how many believes that that's right I love what I heard he say see he don't like your ways but he loves you you don't like what you do but God loves you that's Grace is still there for you he wants you to come to him oh praise be to God okay I gotta quit worrying about time to much amen you love the Lord and I love you amen I love each and every one of you I don't say that a whole L but I believe we should I heard the prophet say it to his church we love you with the love of the lord we love you amen how many believe that we're one body let me tell you something don't ever let no muck and mire don't let let no carnality come from us are you with me how many with me let's not let any carnality come forth from this Fountain this is a pure Fountain amen amen all right praise the Lord amen God is good let me just finish this thought where is Christ far above every Power of every principle every devil is under his feet ain't that right and where is Christ Living in in your heart in his body so if you don't feel like you're but the little toe maybe you feel like you're the nail on the little toe do you know how much attention my little toe nail gets I don't even know I don't remember the last time I looked at that little toe hello I hardly trimmed the nail on it I think it might be like a hores hoof it wears itself down I don't know but that little toe gets very little attention my brother Brad got a little toe hello every devil is under that little toe every principality is under that little D it don't matter who you think you are you've got victory over every devil you've got as much joy as my mouth does expressing you're as important as every other part of the body cuz oh you're above every principality have every Power amen nothing shall stand in your way all the days of your life nothing shall be able to stand before you not even death how many believe let's give the Lord a hand that's right everything is on for you because we're Heavenly [Applause] places in the same place Jesus is in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and to conclude if I can find my quote amen I've put most of them away already but I only got four or five of them so it won't take be very hard to find amen you love him this morning amen praise the Lord here it is all right so I think this is why hold the hell off now notice he's living out his own life when the Holy Spirit when the Christ of the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in your temperament attitude demeanor Aura amen and he's living his own life through his own will through you so you you are that Christ speaks the kind of words he'd Speak Lord help me how many with me Lord help me when I open my mouth maybe I shouldn't open it as often but when it opens let it be his words that are spoken how many's with me let it be his words that are spoken he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded in resting what a beautiful picture of the con in the China Glory we done burnt you out here you're supposed to be way dead ain't that right now you're in here living in the and he's living out his life through you Paul said for me to live is Christ to die is gain it's not me that liveth anymore but it Christ that liveth in me Christ Living individual in the soul Soul surrendered Christ speaks through the lips and he thinks through the Mind amen how many believe we need to think God's [Applause] thoughts I think whenever somebody's in trouble somebody backslides sins when somebody or whatever it is how many knows it's very important the words that you use to those people if you go around criticizing them huh talking bad about him that's not Christ even the prophet said hide the thing pray for him don't go telling everybody about it that's a sure evidence you're no friend of that person you're an enemy if it was your brother or your sister you wouldn't do it no it's important to say well they'll get over it they'll get past it God's going to deliver them God's going to heal you Amen brother Ron texting back and forth he says you know you got to we're going to have to do a uh uh um a Widowmaker I guess on that one artery amen well I say I pray that it's not a Widow Maker but an energy maker I said I believe you're GNA have more energy after all this is said and done positive words not negative well I sure hope you don't die God bless you what a way to end the conversation right that would be about the wrong thing to say wouldn't it oh y I hope I don't either thanks for the vote of confidence no but say something amen good that's the way speak what God would speak think the way God would think how Lord I want to think the way God wants me to think cuz TR The Works that I do shall you do also how many believes we're to be a reflection of Christ and that's the whole thing amen all right we're we're running a little bit late here we go now notice Christ Living in the individuals Christ speaks through his lips thinks through his mind sees through his eyes acts through the temperament Hallelujah he said this few times here while the people are so tossed about and I just wanted to read all three quotes then the things of the world has passed away how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time Christ has got control amen you see it that's what it is it's Christ in you he speaks to The Sinner in the voice that he would speak to him in he speaks to The Prostitute and the voice that he would speak to them in your mind the very thoughts that he speaks to your heart and the Very way that he would if he was here on Earth amen God bless you this morning amen stand with me for a minute how many finds this message this morning a challenge to you in your life a challenge to you in your life to think to speak to see to act to walk just the way that Jesus would because truly he is here on Earth in your heart let's bow our heads raise our hands Lord Jesus we realize God that we're not what we want to be but as your Prophet said we're glad that you have brought us from what we were we're not what we used to be Lord and we're raising our hands in surrenderance to you Lord and we're praying God that after this morning Lord as we raise it open up our hearts and say God take myself take my own ways and get them out of my life Lord and put your ways in there put your thoughts in there every thought that I think Lord Jesus no matter where I'm on the job it doesn't matter where it is I want you to do my thinking to do my acting to do my breathing to do my seeing to to do my talking Lord we want you in our lives Lord for we know that the our heart is a very special place Paul said don't you know that you are the temple of God by the Holy Spirit that's living in us the Ephesians Paul said that he is building a habitation for God lord and we believe that you have filled our hearts and lives and we see God how that we are to be more more like you in your very image if we're going to go into Rapture in order to be United with you and I pray God every heart and every hand Lord that is up right now Lord father would yield to you in a greater way and this coming week God will not be as the previous week and that is for me Lord also God that I would be closer to you than I ever was more dedicated and more surrendered to you than ever and Lord as we about to change your order to service and to remember what you did on Calvary for Paul said I don't want to hear anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified even you knew that it was such of a great thing God until you said and told us to do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it as you take of this bread Lord and we ask God that you'll bless the communion service that we're about to take Lord and each one that go through father I pray we you don't want to come through here unworthily Lord father we ask God your blessing upon the communion now also in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord open your bibles if you will
