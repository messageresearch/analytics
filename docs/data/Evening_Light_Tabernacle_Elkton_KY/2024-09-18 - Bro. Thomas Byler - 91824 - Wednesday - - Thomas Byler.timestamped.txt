[49:22] just want to praise you Lord Jesus even
[49:24] as we sang in the hymns Lord Jesus that

[49:31] you thought of this whole program before
[49:33] the world was ever even created you knew
[49:37] down at the end of it all that there
[49:40] would be people that you would have sons
[49:41] and daughters you would have children
[49:44] that would bring praise and glory and
[49:46] that would sing to your name and of your

[49:51] that you are Lord because of how great
[49:54] you truly are and what you've done in

[50:19] what we're here for where we come from
[50:21] and in a million billion years from now
[50:24] where we'll be and we're so grateful for
[50:27] that how it does our hearts and souls
[50:29] good to know that God you we you are our
[50:32] father and we are in your care Lord we
[50:35] ask God you'll just bless the meditation
[50:37] of our heart father that which we feel
[50:39] you've laid upon a heart to
[50:41] minister grant us Lord Jesus the
[50:43] anointing father that we need keep us
[50:44] from saying anything that we shouldn't
[50:46] and to say just what you would want us
[50:48] to say bless your word and the reading
[50:50] of it now in Jesus name amen turn your
[50:53] bibles if you will to Matthew 24
[50:59] Matthew
[51:10] 24
[51:11] 32 24 and 32 now learn the parable of
[51:14] the Fig Tree when its branch is yet
[51:16] tender and putteth forth his leaves ye
[51:19] know that summer is nigh so likewise ye
[51:21] when you shall see all these things know
[51:23] that it is near even at the doors verily
[51:26] at say unto you this generation shall
[51:28] not pass till all these things be
[51:29] fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass
[51:31] away but my word shall not pass away
[51:37] amen and it's something I that uh he he
[51:41] he really wouldn't have to say that
[51:44] because he wouldn't have but he wants
[51:46] you to understand that his words won't
[51:49] pass away amen so he said it he says
[51:51] look one thing you can count on is that
[51:53] my words will not pass away amen
[51:57] I'm glad for that but if that day and
[51:58] the hour knoweth no man know not the
[52:00] angels of heaven but my father
[52:02] only but as the days of no were so shall
[52:05] also the coming of the son of man be for
[52:07] as in the days that were before the
[52:08] flood they were eating and drinking and
[52:10] marrying and giving in marriage until
[52:12] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[52:14] knew not until the flood came and took
[52:17] shall it also be at the of the son of
[52:19] man the two shall be two then two shall
[52:22] be in the field be taken and the other
[52:24] left two women shall be grinding at the
[52:26] Mill the one shall be taken and the
[52:28] other therefore for you know not the day
[52:31] for the hour that your lord doth come
[52:34] but know this that if the Goodman of the
[52:35] house would have known in what watched
[52:37] it he the thief would come he would have
[52:39] watched and would not have suffered his
[52:41] house to be broken up therefore be ye
[52:43] also ready for in such an hour as ye
[52:45] think not the son of man cometh who then
[52:48] is a faithful and wise servant whom his
[52:50] Lord made ruler over his household to
[52:52] give meat give them meat in due season
[52:55] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[52:57] when he cometh shall find so doing amen
[53:01] verily I say unto you that he shall make
[53:03] him ruler over all his Goods but if if
[53:06] that servant shall say in his heart my
[53:08] de Lord my Lord delayeth his coming and
[53:11] shall begin to Smite his fellow serpent
[53:13] Ser servants and to eat and to drink
[53:15] with the drunk and the Lord of that
[53:16] servant shall come in a day that he
[53:17] lookth not for him and in an hour that
[53:20] he is not aware of and shall cut him
[53:22] aunder and appoint his portion with the
[53:25] Hypocrites there shall be weeping in
[53:26] nashing of teeth amen may God add His
[53:30] blessings to the reading of the words
[53:31] you can be seated amen trying to try to
[53:36] amen just to be able to come through
[53:38] here with some of the thoughts amen of
[53:40] uh of this scripture and U I think we
[53:44] all know that brother bandam he makes
[53:46] the statement that Jesus actually talked
[53:47] more about his second coming than he did
[53:50] amen about his first amen he talked a
[53:53] lot about his second
[53:55] coming amen in this scripture here amen
[53:58] as we want to try to amen just look at
[54:00] this for a minute with the help of the
[54:02] lord we realize that uh the we're living
[54:06] in a late hour ain't that right we're
[54:08] living in the fulfilling of this
[54:10] scripture and I've I've touched on this
[54:13] and I've ministered on this quite a few
[54:14] times but I feel led to do it amen just
[54:17] one more time amen and and trying to
[54:20] just look at it because I believe this
[54:23] is our
[54:25] scripture this is is our scripture
[54:28] amen amen because it is talking about
[54:31] the second coming of the Lord amen and
[54:35] tonight I titled it verse 42 watch
[54:39] therefore for you know not what the hour
[54:41] that it comes he says and I just titled
[54:43] it tonight watch watch amen so how many
[54:48] believes we need to watch we need to be
[54:51] watching amen and there's another
[54:54] scripture I want to read in uh chapter
[54:58] 16 of Matthew Matthew
[55:14] 16 Matthew
[55:17] 16
[55:24] amen says the Pharisees also with the
[55:27] Sadducees came tempting and tempting
[55:31] Desiring him that he would show them a
[55:32] sign from heaven and he answered and
[55:35] said unto them when it is evening you
[55:38] say it will be fair weather for the sky
[55:40] is red and in the morning it shall be
[55:41] foul weather for the sky is red and
[55:44] lowering oh ye Hypocrites you can
[55:46] discern the face of the sky but you
[55:49] cannot Des discern the signs of the
[55:53] times amen
[55:56] amen so we see here he says even Jesus
[55:58] was talking because we realize that how
[56:01] many knows that the scribes and the
[56:02] Pharisees and the religious people of
[56:04] that hour they actually missed Christ
[56:08] amen they missed him for the most part
[56:10] because he came in a simple way in a way
[56:13] that they did not expect him to
[56:15] come amen but they should have seen
[56:18] whenever the sign of the Messiah was
[56:20] being done they should have realized hey
[56:23] this must be that Messiah
[56:26] is that right this must be the sign of
[56:29] the Messiah and because that they they
[56:31] they they missed the day of their
[56:33] visitation or they missed what God was
[56:35] doing in front of them amen Jesus ended
[56:38] up being on the mount amen and and
[56:40] weeping and talking about how that they
[56:43] had missed their hour and how that he
[56:44] would have hovered them as a h as a
[56:46] brood but they would not isn't that
[56:48] right and we're living in and it's quite
[56:51] something when you think about America
[56:53] and America that we live in and all of
[56:57] the Baptist and Methodist and the
[56:59] Presbyterian the Pentecostals and and
[57:02] everybody all the religious people that
[57:04] we had in all the Bible school had to
[57:08] teach that that we got taught am mean in
[57:10] the word to understand how God works
[57:13] still we all know that this generation
[57:16] also missed
[57:19] him it's a terrible thing to miss what
[57:22] God's doing in front of you how many
[57:24] knows that amen really appreciate the
[57:27] atmosphere here tonight amen and and the
[57:29] songs s and everybody just really in it
[57:31] I really appreciate that
[57:32] amen so we're just going to amen see
[57:35] where the Lord will take us tonight but
[57:37] we want to we want to talk about that
[57:39] watching for a little bit because I
[57:40] believe that we're living in an hour uh
[57:43] that we should be on our
[57:45] toes we have to watch we have to be
[57:48] careful amen because uh I believe that
[57:51] even and I'm going to talk a little bit
[57:52] about politics and so forth but I guess
[57:55] you know coming up the next 50 days or
[57:58] so I don't know just how long it is to
[58:00] election
[58:01] day but it's going to be Monumental for
[58:05] a message
[58:06] believer ain't that
[58:08] right amen because we believe that we
[58:11] may be looking at the fulfilling of
[58:16] Prophecy is't that right and I mean the
[58:19] prophets been off the scene for so long
[58:21] now over I don't know 50 some odd years
[58:24] and yall remember when he had the those
[58:26] Visions back in 33 of musolini and
[58:29] Hitler and Germany and all these
[58:30] different lines and all these different
[58:32] things that take place right and then he
[58:35] had like seven Visions is that right
[58:37] seven different visions that he
[58:40] had and so uh and I want to go into that
[58:44] with the help of the Lord because I
[58:45] believe it's important that we see the
[58:47] day and it's very exciting because uh
[58:50] let me let me just read you a quote now
[58:52] that brings us then to the election of
[58:54] President Kennedy and this car coming am
[58:57] me I think it was the car one of the
[58:59] cars that they was going to make that
[59:01] was going to be aerodynamic and and it
[59:03] was going to be self-driven we know that
[59:05] we've got they've got that already is
[59:07] that right they've already got that and
[59:10] then after that he talks about a woman
[59:12] coming into power and then after that it
[59:13] was going to be the destruction the
[59:15] destruction that comes so now listen to
[59:18] what he says I like what he says and
[59:20] this car coming on the scene bringing
[59:22] five things out of seven that has
[59:25] happened
[59:27] exactly so that leaves us with what two
[59:31] things two things to happen and that is
[59:35] he says and I predicted now this is a
[59:37] lot of lot of his prediction in one one
[59:39] place there's one place that he did say
[59:41] thus sayeth the Lord that would be a
[59:42] woman a woman rule either a vice
[59:45] president or a president is that right
[59:47] and I saw a great woman standing up
[59:49] beautiful dressed in a real highly Royal
[59:53] like purple and we know that when uh uh
[59:56] uh camela whenever she was in the
[59:58] inauguration that she wore that purple
[1:00:00] and it caught our
[1:00:02] eyes our eyes popped open here's a woman
[1:00:05] you know I mean Hillary was before that
[1:00:08] Hillary was a chance of that woman
[1:00:10] coming into power but she lost and you
[1:00:16] know I don't want to be mean so I won't
[1:00:18] say something but anyway uh she didn't
[1:00:21] fit
[1:00:23] it right she didn't really fit the
[1:00:25] prophecy but this would be a whole lot
[1:00:27] closer to fit in the prophecy especially
[1:00:29] with the dressing of the purple and so
[1:00:32] forth is't that right and really when
[1:00:34] you think about it I mean you know uh
[1:00:37] the vi being a vice president amen look
[1:00:40] she she could have already feel
[1:00:41] fulfilled that in that part but the fact
[1:00:44] that a woman and camela and we everybody
[1:00:48] looks at her Record Man it is nothing to
[1:00:50] brag about I don't care what what she
[1:00:52] did was nothing to brag
[1:00:54] about I guess whenever she went tried to
[1:00:57] run for president I think about a year
[1:00:59] or so ago she got like 1% or maybe 1%
[1:01:02] she you know this ain't going to
[1:01:04] work right so and and then all of a
[1:01:06] sudden here she is and she's get thrown
[1:01:09] right up here into the front page of
[1:01:11] everything and and becomes uh you know
[1:01:13] right now the race is about 5050 it's a
[1:01:16] it's a tied race all of a sudden where
[1:01:18] Trump was way ahead of Biden but it
[1:01:20] brings it all down there and and then
[1:01:21] our eyes pop open again and that right
[1:01:23] we're like whoa wait a minute look at
[1:01:25] this
[1:01:28] amen and so with this is the thing I
[1:01:31] want to bring out with just two more
[1:01:33] things and I I will say three but um
[1:01:38] I'll bring that out in a minute because
[1:01:40] we know that uh our loved ones are to
[1:01:42] appear and so forth isn't that right
[1:01:45] there's supposed to be a Rapture because
[1:01:47] uh really let me just say this for you
[1:01:50] and I there's only one more thing to
[1:01:53] happen before the rapture right only one
[1:01:57] more thing for you and I cuz I sure
[1:01:59] don't want to be here for the second
[1:02:03] one
[1:02:05] right right that's got to be tribulation
[1:02:09] period right Annihilation
[1:02:13] destruction oh my that right so can I
[1:02:16] read you a few things first of all let
[1:02:18] me just go back a little bit because
[1:02:19] we're living in a we're living in a
[1:02:21] exciting
[1:02:22] hour this is an exciting time
[1:02:27] things are starting to get
[1:02:30] exciting you know what's you know
[1:02:35] uh when the word when we hear the word
[1:02:38] we hear prophecy and we hear it and
[1:02:40] understand it's going to happen but when
[1:02:42] those things be begin to materialize in
[1:02:45] front of you then it's a whole different
[1:02:48] story ain't that right it's a whole lot
[1:02:50] more exciting it's more exciting
[1:02:52] whenever you ask God and pray for pray
[1:02:54] to God about something and and and the
[1:02:56] thing that you prayed for all of a
[1:02:57] sudden there it materializes woo you got
[1:03:00] something to shout about
[1:03:02] then and that's the way it is with
[1:03:04] prophecy when we see it happening hey
[1:03:06] we've got to be it's got It's close
[1:03:08] night we're almost there
[1:03:10] now Jesus told us he says you better be
[1:03:13] watching isn't that right when you see
[1:03:15] the Fig Tree putting forth its bud when
[1:03:17] you see the other buds putting forth
[1:03:19] their buds is that
[1:03:20] right as it was in the days of lot and
[1:03:23] as it was in the days of Noah and we've
[1:03:24] seen all of those things we've seen the
[1:03:26] Sodom and Gomorrah condition already
[1:03:29] we've seen Sodom come into fruition and
[1:03:31] so forth and all that we've seen all
[1:03:33] these other prophecies but this has got
[1:03:35] us our
[1:03:37] attention and I've got several different
[1:03:40] scenarios amen I've got wrote down here
[1:03:42] about four different scenarios that
[1:03:44] we're looking at and we'll go over them
[1:03:45] with the help of the Lord but I want to
[1:03:47] read you cck quotes first listen brother
[1:03:49] bam says listen we're standing tonight
[1:03:51] upon the brim watching come to pass and
[1:03:53] unfold two great scenes one of those
[1:03:56] scenes are these one of them is the
[1:03:58] ending of
[1:04:00] History amen the ending of history and
[1:04:03] the ending of time amen many great men
[1:04:07] down Through the Ages has longed to see
[1:04:10] this hour that you're we are now
[1:04:14] approaching amen how many know Luther
[1:04:17] Wesley Paul all of those great men they
[1:04:20] long to see the hour Amen to believe in
[1:04:23] the hours they they were under expect
[1:04:25] expectation
[1:04:26] God Amen he's fixing to come the second
[1:04:28] second time I mean know there's not one
[1:04:32] thing there's not one hope left in this
[1:04:34] world outside of the coming of the Lord
[1:04:36] that's the only hope there
[1:04:39] is the only hope there is is the coming
[1:04:41] of the
[1:04:42] Lord now wouldn't you wouldn't it be
[1:04:45] scary if you wasn't one of God's
[1:04:47] children boy God's going to come back
[1:04:50] and I'm not ready and there ain't
[1:04:51] nothing else there is no other hope
[1:04:53] that's
[1:04:54] right but when you're a Christian when
[1:04:56] you're ready to go and you're prayed up
[1:04:58] then it's a different
[1:05:00] story praise be to
[1:05:04] God oh my are you ready for
[1:05:06] this I've got wrote down here if we know
[1:05:09] if we know that when she comes into
[1:05:11] Power the things that she's going to do
[1:05:13] I'll read some of them you know am me
[1:05:15] how what she'll do and dominate and be a
[1:05:18] dominate you know the country and the
[1:05:20] rule just do what she wants to pretty
[1:05:22] much you know and ruin the country
[1:05:26] and then we realize that after that
[1:05:28] woman comes into it we realize he said
[1:05:30] the next thing he saw was the complete
[1:05:32] annihilation of the world we realize if
[1:05:35] that's a fact and if that's the way it
[1:05:38] is then guess what you better be looking
[1:05:41] for your loved ones to appear it's
[1:05:44] Rapture
[1:05:45] time between that woman and the next
[1:05:48] it's Rapture time it's coming real
[1:05:52] close praise be to God
[1:05:55] and I got wrote down here man if we know
[1:05:58] if we know that that's going to usher in
[1:06:00] and it's going to bring us right close
[1:06:02] to that time of the Rapture why
[1:06:04] shouldn't we be hoping well praise the
[1:06:06] Lord let it come even so let it
[1:06:10] happen anden I got wrote down here it
[1:06:12] might get me thrown out here people
[1:06:14] might not like it well but maybe we
[1:06:16] ought to go vote for
[1:06:19] her let's get this thing over with Let's
[1:06:23] Get It On that's what they going to
[1:06:25] happen whether you vote or not or
[1:06:27] whatever it don't matter if get Sky if
[1:06:29] it's prophecy it's going to
[1:06:32] happen I think one of the greatest thing
[1:06:35] is that that you can be under
[1:06:37] expectation and you can be enthused and
[1:06:39] you can be inspired and happy about
[1:06:43] it you don't have to be scared about it
[1:06:47] I don't have to be scared about it why
[1:06:50] because we know that the very Lord that
[1:06:52] we've been serving amen all of time all
[1:06:55] of history all of the Saints of all the
[1:06:57] ages have been looking for this moment
[1:06:59] for this time they want the coming back
[1:07:02] of the Lord they want to meet him they
[1:07:04] want to see the one that has been in
[1:07:06] their hearts and in their lives we want
[1:07:08] to be with
[1:07:11] him amen we want to be with him we want
[1:07:14] to be there and that time is Justified
[1:07:16] upon
[1:07:17] us we're happy about that not sad it's
[1:07:21] not a sad thing it's a joyous
[1:07:24] thing it's it's an exciting
[1:07:28] thing oh maybe they'll shut us down we
[1:07:31] already know that there's one of her
[1:07:33] agendas is to Amen to to persecute
[1:07:36] Christians I can show you a quote where
[1:07:38] brother B says when that woman when all
[1:07:39] of that happens he said there come a
[1:07:41] persecution upon the people God's people
[1:07:43] and it'll drive them together he says it
[1:07:45] that's what it'll take to bring message
[1:07:48] people
[1:07:50] together that persecution you'll lay
[1:07:53] aside your little isms and whether he's
[1:07:55] on a white cloud or a horse you worry
[1:07:58] about all of your little difference it
[1:07:59] ain't going to make nothing to the real
[1:08:01] believer anymore to me it don't make no
[1:08:03] difference
[1:08:05] anyway amen but we let little isms come
[1:08:08] between us some time
[1:08:11] amen praise be to
[1:08:14] God but oh I like that oh as we live in
[1:08:18] this glorious setting of mortal sun and
[1:08:20] breaking of Eternal Light amen listen he
[1:08:24] says
[1:08:25] we're living in one of the grandest ages
[1:08:28] that ever man was permitted to
[1:08:34] live and we sit there really I don't see
[1:08:38] nothing so Grand about
[1:08:40] it what's so Grand about

[1:08:58] it's one of the greatest grandest ages
[1:09:00] of all ages the leosia age is the

[1:14:49] States
[1:14:50] before the total annihilation of the

[1:15:43] have had to say yeah Trump was right he
[1:15:45] said that and it was right yeah there's
[1:15:49] a lot of things he said that ended up

[1:16:57] prophecy that is
[1:16:58] fulfilled ain't that right they may have
[1:17:02] a sorry
[1:17:03] Army that's right you can't even defeat
[1:17:06] the country that don't have an army
[1:17:08] Ukraine is't that right I I don't know
[1:17:12] about you but I don't think you had much
[1:17:13] of an army all of these little ways that
[1:17:16] they could take care of them so forth
[1:17:17] still fighting them but they do have
[1:17:19] some nukes folk they've got nukes and
[1:17:22] I'm talking enough to take the whole
[1:17:24] world out
[1:17:25] and so do we and see it's not just about
[1:17:28] if they destroy America America has
[1:17:30] enough Subs out there in the waters to
[1:17:32] destroy several times over just in the
[1:17:34] subs that they have so you see where he
[1:17:37] says the whole world
[1:17:39] annihilated
[1:17:41] amen there's going to be a
[1:17:44] fire oh my we can only
[1:17:49] imagine didn't they didn't they hesitate
[1:17:52] when they set off the atom bomb at the
[1:17:54] first time they hesitate it to do it fa
[1:17:56] fearing that they would set off the
[1:17:58] atoms in the air and the whole world
[1:18:00] would burn over now how do you know the
[1:18:02] whole world ain't going to catch fire if
[1:18:04] you set this thing off
[1:18:07] huh oh my when you think about that kind
[1:18:10] of fire now notice he says keep that in
[1:18:13] mind right now notice talking about a
[1:18:17] Mar's a a woman's Nations a great woman
[1:18:19] will rise up and be
[1:18:21] president or something like that in the
[1:18:24] nation and then there will come a total
[1:18:26] Annihilation the entire nation will be
[1:18:29] wiped out so that was the seven visions
[1:18:32] that he said after that woman comes into
[1:18:34] Power then there's Annihilation and
[1:18:36] that's why ours are open boy this woman
[1:18:38] in purple and and and and and Timothy
[1:18:40] puit I watched some of this on him and
[1:18:43] he had a picture of one of the
[1:18:44] newspapers where brother brandom said
[1:18:46] she's like a queen or something amen and
[1:18:49] it showed they one of the newspapers
[1:18:51] they they love her so much they put a
[1:18:53] crown on her like some queen or
[1:18:56] something amen I mean notice that kind
[1:18:58] of catches our attention queen crown
[1:19:03] coming into
[1:19:04] Power
[1:19:06] amen now I want to talk to you about the
[1:19:09] scenario if she doesn't get elected at
[1:19:11] all but of course personally I'll give
[1:19:13] you my opinion I I think she'll get
[1:19:15] in amen kind of hope she does
[1:19:18] actually if it's the fulfilling of the
[1:19:20] scriptures then I say let it happen
[1:19:23] because I don't care what I don't I
[1:19:24] don't care if Trump gets back under this
[1:19:26] world brother bam says it's going going
[1:19:27] to get worse and worse till the skies
[1:19:30] catch on fire the only reason we want
[1:19:33] Trump is because there might be a little
[1:19:34] more time might be a little
[1:19:40] reprieve but I want I want to I want to
[1:19:42] check you on that too here in a minute
[1:19:44] if I can and don't forget to amen right
[1:19:47] now notice something like that in the
[1:19:49] nation and then there will come totally
[1:19:51] and that entire nation will be wiped out
[1:19:54] now Noti and he says so I didn't know
[1:19:56] just then when I when I saw that that
[1:19:58] that it's they had something that could
[1:20:00] annihilate it but they got it now I see
[1:20:02] the nation in total Annihilation just
[1:20:05] stumps and trees and things like that so
[1:20:07] it's on its Road and if these other
[1:20:10] things has come to pass just as he said
[1:20:13] that never that will also how many know
[1:20:16] it's going to happen if Christ came the
[1:20:18] first time he'll come the second
[1:20:22] time W I'm glad for that if he said
[1:20:25] he'll come back he's coming
[1:20:28] back and all the things he said will
[1:20:31] come to pass and duly seeing this and
[1:20:33] knowing that our number is just about to
[1:20:36] be called as a nation knowing that the
[1:20:39] church is about to take its Rapture it
[1:20:42] moves the heart of a minister or any of
[1:20:45] the Ley to know that we're in this that
[1:20:48] we're in this day and time that we're
[1:20:51] living in it's the greatest time that

[1:21:29] life it's going to become what you could
[1:21:31] never imagine how many knows we can't
[1:21:35] imagine what lays ahead for
[1:21:38] us even brother bam says if you die and
[1:21:41] go over there to the other side he had
[1:21:43] no words to explain to you how wonderful
[1:21:46] it is just
[1:21:48] thee wo how many believes we're in the
[1:21:52] moment amen we're in that time

[1:21:56] Lord praise be to God the time is at
[1:22:01] hand Jesus said watch you know the signs
[1:22:03] of the time if you know what hour watch
[1:22:05] the signs around us I believe we're all
[1:22:08] watching and mean we got our eyes open
[1:22:10] look at the signs around us for 50 some
[1:22:13] years maybe we were sluggish maybe we
[1:22:15] were not sure of things but this is one
[1:22:17] true one good sign amen that we're
[1:22:20] looking at praise the Lord
[1:22:24] all right one was
[1:22:28] listen now listen and now these women

[1:22:35] the United States well-dressed and
[1:22:37] beautiful cruel in heart amen and she
[1:22:40] will either guide or lead this nation to
[1:22:45] ruination
[1:22:46] amen talks about science and its
[1:22:49] progress and the mechanic and
[1:22:50] Automobiles and all of that now I'm not
[1:22:52] going to go into that too much we've
[1:22:53] seen that a brother even brother abam
[1:22:54] says that's already happened then I see
[1:22:56] the United States as a smoldering burned
[1:22:58] over place it will be near the
[1:23:01] end now how many remembers in uh in uh
[1:23:06] Nebuchadnezzar in div Vision that he had
[1:23:08] of that stature of gold and the head of
[1:23:10] gold and and the chest and all down he
[1:23:12] talks about the kingdoms that are come
[1:23:14] all the way down to the uh Toes that
[1:23:16] were iron and Clay amen and brother bam
[1:23:20] says that we were down in those toes now

[1:23:27] Eisenhower or Eisenhower meant iron amen
[1:23:30] and they couldn't get
[1:23:32] along how manyan know for some reason
[1:23:35] folks we just can't get along with
[1:23:38] Russia Trump kind of he he kind of
[1:23:41] halfway gets along with Putin and so
[1:23:42] forth and claims he can actually stop
[1:23:44] that war with a phone call if he gets
[1:23:46] elected before he ever takes office the
[1:23:49] man's got a lot of confidence and with
[1:23:51] who he is I'm I'm just going to give it
[1:23:53] to him maybe he can I shouldn't doubt
[1:23:55] him even though I do a
[1:23:58] little but let me tell you something how
[1:24:00] many knows the Democrats don't want to
[1:24:02] be friends with Putin they don't want to
[1:24:03] be friends with Russia no they don't
[1:24:05] want to be no friends with them at all
[1:24:07] that's
[1:24:08] right but they don't we just don't get
[1:24:10] along we've been basically declared
[1:24:13] enemies we're pretty much enemies but
[1:24:16] anyway they don't mix and listen to what
[1:24:18] there's listen they couldn't mix
[1:24:20] together he took his shoe off and beat
[1:24:22] it see there's no mixing together they
[1:24:24] can't mix they won't cleave the Bible
[1:24:26] says one to
[1:24:28] another they just won't cleave one to
[1:24:30] another do you see friends the next
[1:24:33] thing that's left is for the stone to be
[1:24:35] cut out the coming of the Lord to roll
[1:24:38] into this image and to smash it into
[1:24:42] pieces oh my and all these kingdoms will
[1:24:45] be ground and blow
[1:24:50] away we blow it away all right fire

[1:24:58] cometh that shall burn us in heaven all
[1:25:00] the pride and all that do wickedly shall
[1:25:02] be ashes under your
[1:25:05] feate how many knows that's something
[1:25:07] else that you can look forward to coming
[1:25:10] back and walk on the ashes of the wicked
[1:25:12] no matter how they treated you no matter
[1:25:14] how low you was and how everything else
[1:25:16] they lied about you on that day you'll
[1:25:19] walk on their
[1:25:21] ashes amen they'll be blowned away he
[1:25:24] says this stone is going to come and
[1:25:27] blow him away
[1:25:30] amen these kingdoms will be ground and
[1:25:33] blowed away like the chaff on the
[1:25:34] summing thresher floor we're at the end
[1:25:36] time brother sister can't you see where
[1:25:39] we're at amen listen thus sayith the
[1:25:42] Lord I predicted the three curtains in
[1:25:44] the name of the Lord the Iron Curtain
[1:25:46] Russia red China bamboo curtain they're
[1:25:49] horrible but watch that purple curtain
[1:25:52] that's rising in the United States and
[1:25:54] over the world that Roman Empire the
[1:25:57] crest of them
[1:25:59] all just today I seen the flick on uh
[1:26:02] see Flick where the pope was am me
[1:26:04] meeting and he's making a trip around
[1:26:06] the world different places and he's
[1:26:08] talking about he says you know everybody
[1:26:10] wants God and he says you know he's
[1:26:14] we're all his children he said we're all
[1:26:17] his
[1:26:18] children come to me a that right come to
[1:26:22] me and I thought you know he's a false
[1:26:24] prophet you expect him to
[1:26:26] lie not everybody on Earth is God's
[1:26:29] children read your Bible there's the
[1:26:32] tears Jesus said the tears are the
[1:26:34] children of the wicked
[1:26:36] one amen but that's just how he does
[1:26:38] Amen but think about it he says even in
[1:26:41] America the crest of all of them
[1:26:44] remember in the name of the Lord get
[1:26:45] away from it come away from it from
[1:26:47] anything that's attached to it flee to
[1:26:49] the Rock the coming of the Lord is at
[1:26:51] hand we need a conference amen have a
[1:26:53] talk
[1:26:55] listen now notice as we see the days
[1:26:58] darkening and we see the Shadows falling
[1:27:01] when I predicted just a few more turns
[1:27:04] of the Sun and this nation's gone hasn't
[1:27:08] even been 200 years he says and no
[1:27:10] democracy has ever lasted 200
[1:27:13] years and I'm not sure which one it was
[1:27:16] Eisenhower or one of them that we were
[1:27:17] in a war and they said they should never
[1:27:19] take a third term and then I think they
[1:27:21] did and he said that broke the Democracy
[1:27:23] right there didn't even last 200 years
[1:27:27] before those seven years up were up I
[1:27:28] can get you a quote brother bam said the
[1:27:30] were broken before then and I manyan
[1:27:33] those my goodness gracious you talk
[1:27:35] about breaking our
[1:27:37] democracy amen nowadays have no respect
[1:27:41] for it whatsoever is that right the
[1:27:43] Supreme Court ruled that Biden and all
[1:27:45] them can't forgive student Le loans and
[1:27:48] stuff they kept right on doing
[1:27:50] it don't matter what the Supreme Court
[1:27:52] says
[1:27:54] amen isn't that
[1:27:56] sad listen we see the condition of the
[1:27:58] time we see the condition of the people
[1:28:00] we see the condition of politics we see
[1:28:02] the condition of the world it can't
[1:28:04] stand it's got to sink like the Titanic
[1:28:07] it must go down to give our one nation
[1:28:09] gives room to another and this Kingdom
[1:28:12] Must Fall in every Kingdom Amen to give
[1:28:14] room to that Kingdom that's coming which
[1:28:17] can not
[1:28:20] fall how many knows that we are
[1:28:22] Americans as far as our our uh bloodline
[1:28:25] and so forth we're Americans we're of
[1:28:27] this Kingdom of America but down on the
[1:28:29] inside we're of another kingdom a
[1:28:32] kingdom can never pass
[1:28:35] away never come to that it don't matter
[1:28:39] what king it don't matter what dictator
[1:28:41] tries to get us to leave that Kingdom
[1:28:43] people would rather die and give their
[1:28:44] lives by the millions than to try to
[1:28:47] denounce this Kingdom that you and I are
[1:28:50] in how many knows these kingdoms has to
[1:28:53] fall
[1:28:55] amen praise be to
[1:28:58] God Amen so let me
[1:29:01] uh it's going good let me just say a few
[1:29:05] things
[1:29:07] here as we talk about this election
[1:29:10] that's coming
[1:29:11] up how exciting it is and we think well
[1:29:16] guess
[1:29:17] what if Trump gets
[1:29:20] it well it'll seem like a little
[1:29:22] reprieve
[1:29:24] but if she gets to be the actual ruler
[1:29:26] of it
[1:29:27] all then I guess we'll every one of us
[1:29:30] will be definitely heads up heads up
[1:29:33] folks start looking for your loved
[1:29:37] ones and see if you're not ready you
[1:29:39] better get ready how many times did I
[1:29:42] read that even Jesus said be ready for
[1:29:44] you know not the day watch and be
[1:29:47] ready watch and be ready that was one of
[1:29:50] the main things that Jesus said in these
[1:29:52] Parables am mean even in 20 the fourth
[1:29:55] 25th chapter when he talked to wise
[1:29:57] foolish and the uh foolish virgins and
[1:29:59] the wise virgins went out there one had
[1:30:01] oil one didn't have oil
[1:30:04] amen I think if I can just get it real
[1:30:07] quick and I want to
[1:30:09] um read that and of course we know the
[1:30:12] foolish virgin said to the wise virgin
[1:30:14] give us of your oil they said no you go
[1:30:16] buy and sell you know and while they
[1:30:19] went to buy the bridegroom came and they
[1:30:22] that were ready went in with him to the
[1:30:25] marriage and the door was
[1:30:27] shut afterwards also came the other
[1:30:29] virgin saying Lord open to us and he
[1:30:31] answered verily I said I know you not
[1:30:33] watch therefore for you neither know the
[1:30:35] day nor the hour when the Lord son of
[1:30:37] man cometh watch therefore for you know
[1:30:40] not now there was a scripture I wanted
[1:30:42] to go to in Thessalonians I didn't have
[1:30:46] this tag but I remember somewhere
[1:30:51] here um in 2 Thessalonians 5 I believe
[1:30:55] it was here here he's saying watch
[1:30:59] because you don't neither the day nor
[1:31:00] the hour where in the son of man cometh
[1:31:03] but now we know by the signs of the time
[1:31:05] how many knows we're very getting very
[1:31:08] close getting very close to the coming
[1:31:10] of the
[1:31:12] Lord amen and I'm just going to put this
[1:31:15] in because we know brother Brandon
[1:31:18] whenever he talked about this woman
[1:31:20] whenever he talked about the
[1:31:21] annihilation he says and I predict that
[1:31:24] all this will happen before
[1:31:29] 77 look where we are now you tell me
[1:31:32] we're not ripe tell me we're not ready
[1:31:35] why do you think all believers have
[1:31:36] their eyes open right now Wella these
[1:31:38] things has to happen sooner or later
[1:31:41] amen when we see we when you see these
[1:31:43] things happen look up quit looking
[1:31:46] around amen make sure your priorities
[1:31:49] right like brother Joe's prayer make
[1:31:51] sure Lord that we have our priorities
[1:31:53] right all all this stuff in the earth it
[1:31:55] ain't going to mean
[1:31:57] nothing keep God on the
[1:32:01] Forefront why do you think I want to
[1:32:03] keep preaching you know that we've got
[1:32:04] to walk Enoch's
[1:32:06] walk if there's if there's one desire
[1:32:09] that I have as a pastor here and that is
[1:32:11] that every one of you walk Enoch's walk
[1:32:14] every
[1:32:16] day it don't matter if Trump in or
[1:32:18] anybody or what come you walk that every
[1:32:22] day amen watch for you not the day but
[1:32:26] uh Paul said it this way but ye Brethren
[1:32:28] are not in darkness that that day should
[1:32:30] overtake you as a thief ye are all the
[1:32:33] children of light and the children of
[1:32:35] day we are not of the night nor of
[1:32:37] Darkness therefore let us not sleep as
[1:32:40] do others amen but let us watch and be
[1:32:43] sober for that for they that sleep sleep
[1:32:46] in the night and they that are drunken
[1:32:47] are drunk in the night but let us who
[1:32:49] are of the day be sober putting on the
[1:32:51] bless breast pain of faith and of love
[1:32:54] and the forign helmet the hope of
[1:32:55] Salvation so Paul's saying you know it's
[1:32:58] not going to take you as a
[1:32:59] thief and over in in Matthew even Jesus
[1:33:03] says you know that servant that is
[1:33:04] watching for his coming and waiting for
[1:33:07] his coming I like these two
[1:33:10] words those that are leaving are going
[1:33:12] to be doing two things they're going to
[1:33:15] be watching and they're going to be
[1:33:19] ready be ye therefore ready
[1:33:24] they're watching and they're
[1:33:26] ready
[1:33:30] amen I don't know what it does to some
[1:33:33] people Tommy but it could I guess if you
[1:33:35] wasn't right with God scare you to think
[1:33:37] that we were that close that a woman is
[1:33:39] right there and the next thing's
[1:33:40] Annihilation but I truly believe if
[1:33:42] you're right with God it ought to excite
[1:33:44] you amen it ought to it ought to do
[1:33:47] something for you say Thank you Lord
[1:33:48] Jesus I'm so close to home now that's
[1:33:51] why Paul died that's why Peter died
[1:33:54] that's why all of them died and give
[1:33:55] their lives because they wanted to spend
[1:33:57] heaven with Jesus Christ they wanted to
[1:34:00] see his second coming they want to be in
[1:34:02] the resurrection they want eternal life
[1:34:04] and they've been waiting for all of
[1:34:06] these thousands of years for this moment
[1:34:09] and here we are getting close to
[1:34:14] it
[1:34:16] amen all right now how many knows that
[1:34:20] when you talk when you talk about the
[1:34:21] signs of the times when you talk about
[1:34:24] you know watching for the things that
[1:34:25] happen even brother brandham said one
[1:34:28] place he says you know there come an
[1:34:30] hour when people would say well I
[1:34:32] thought that there was supposed to be a
[1:34:34] Rapture
[1:34:40] first so what I'm saying is it's easy to
[1:34:43] miss the signs around us it's easy to
[1:34:48] miss number two whether it's me whether
[1:34:51] it's any other preacher or all of us
[1:34:54] when it comes to these things we think a
[1:34:56] little different
[1:34:59] Amen brother I I'll just put this out
[1:35:02] there brother Phil kind of leans on that
[1:35:04] it'll be the conservatives that bring in
[1:35:07] that
[1:35:08] persecution well I don't really see it
[1:35:10] that way because I'm watching who's
[1:35:12] really bringing it
[1:35:14] in but it's fine you know because we do
[1:35:17] realize that he set the world counil of
[1:35:19] churches and so
[1:35:20] forth but oh brother brand I read a
[1:35:24] quote today where he says brother bandam
[1:35:25] said that they already joined into
[1:35:27] Catholicism into Dem Market ofes into
[1:35:29] world ccil and they didn't even know it
[1:35:33] that's what brother bam said about the
[1:35:34] church they already in it and didn't
[1:35:35] realize it when they go shake hands they
[1:35:38] kiss it Pentecostals and Baptist when
[1:35:40] you go and you fall down before the pope
[1:35:42] and you you become one with him guess
[1:35:44] you're already in folks because you who
[1:35:46] knows who's going to rule that's going
[1:35:48] to be the pope it's going to be
[1:35:49] Catholicism that ultimately rules the
[1:35:51] calling these prop and that it's all
[1:35:53] part part of that so if you can find out
[1:35:55] what Catholicism is pushing and so forth
[1:35:58] then you'll know who's behind it but
[1:36:00] just exactly how it is you got to keep a
[1:36:03] comma behind what you believe and a lot
[1:36:05] of us see a little different that's why
[1:36:07] we just watch watch it transform let's
[1:36:09] let's see how it comes apart how it
[1:36:12] happens but my warning to you tonight is
[1:36:15] amen and that is that what if Trump gets
[1:36:19] it well this was all just a well this is
[1:36:23] nothing turn not the way we thought it
[1:36:25] did is that what we're going to say
[1:36:28] don't say that don't say that why
[1:36:33] because she has in a way already
[1:36:35] fulfilled that
[1:36:37] scripture she's already done
[1:36:41] it she already was in she was he said a
[1:36:44] president or vice president that's what
[1:36:47] he said she was already that vice
[1:36:48] president and what has they what have
[1:36:50] they done to our country with the
[1:36:52] economy
[1:36:54] and with the flooding of immigrants and
[1:36:56] the disrespect to the law and being a
[1:36:58] dictator woo this could get you in
[1:37:00] trouble but how many those they have
[1:37:02] been nothing but dictators up there
[1:37:05] don't matter what nobody does and they
[1:37:06] want to even quize our nuclear
[1:37:12] system so be careful it may be brother
[1:37:15] bam never said that it'd be the last
[1:37:17] president that that woman would be the
[1:37:18] last
[1:37:20] president maybe she's fulfilling that
[1:37:23] let's keep keep her eyes open be Lord
[1:37:24] don't let me miss it if she don't get it
[1:37:27] maybe that was
[1:37:29] it and the next thing is that we look
[1:37:32] for our loved
[1:37:33] ones because the fire's going to fall
[1:37:36] you never know who's going to throw that
[1:37:38] bomb
[1:37:40] amen just you have to be careful
[1:37:43] sometimes it's more simple than what we
[1:37:44] think we expect for her to come and
[1:37:46] totally destroy it well they destroyed
[1:37:48] it they borrowed millions and trillions
[1:37:50] into that through us into into total
[1:37:52] chaos isn't that
[1:37:55] right amen so that was my second
[1:37:57] scenario amen one is that uh she gets it
[1:38:01] and hey it'll look even more like the
[1:38:03] fulfilling of it and we'll see what
[1:38:05] happens from there on the other scenario
[1:38:07] Trump gets it and amen and and then we
[1:38:09] just got to be careful amen because you
[1:38:12] don't know just you know it could have
[1:38:14] been fulfilled already because she
[1:38:15] certainly did a lot of
[1:38:17] it but at any rate the most important
[1:38:20] thing is
[1:38:24] you and
[1:38:26] me check your
[1:38:28] heart I've got a few more quotes I want
[1:38:31] to get
[1:38:32] into amen and it's out of it almost
[1:38:35] seems like I'm taking a detour but this
[1:38:37] is about you and I being ready okay
[1:38:40] let's focus on that for just a little
[1:38:42] bit brother pranon preached a message
[1:38:44] you should listen to it straight is the
[1:38:46] gate straight is the gate amen listen he
[1:38:51] says now he says it's better take
[1:38:54] inventory this morning Christian he says
[1:38:57] there'll be tens times Millions times
[1:39:00] billions of CR Christians staunched in
[1:39:04] their life that'll miss the gate Jesus
[1:39:07] said so straight is the gate and narrow
[1:39:09] is the way and few there be that find
[1:39:13] it he says as it was in the days of Noah
[1:39:17] what was it
[1:39:19] seven seven
[1:39:22] nine SA night and then in the days of
[1:39:26] lot
[1:39:28] three few there be that find
[1:39:31] it listen to
[1:39:33] this how many's going in I don't know I
[1:39:37] don't know how many's going only God
[1:39:38] knows let me be one of them that's right
[1:39:40] he's a judge let me be the one you say
[1:39:43] brother bam how can you tell that you're
[1:39:45] a
[1:39:46] Christian amen he says I don't know but
[1:39:49] let me tell you what the scripture says
[1:39:51] surely you'll believe that and he talks
[1:39:53] about amen where the Bible says you know
[1:39:56] uh the Bible says go and put a mark upon
[1:39:58] those who sigh and cry for the
[1:40:00] Abominations that's done in the city in
[1:40:02] other words they're tore up about the
[1:40:04] sins that's committed in the
[1:40:06] world
[1:40:08] Amen so that's one say one way that you
[1:40:10] know that you're on the right path amen
[1:40:13] oh I can show you plenty going to church
[1:40:15] I can show you plenty singing the choir
[1:40:17] I can show you plenty teaching Sunday
[1:40:18] school I can show you plenty that's in
[1:40:21] uh the great societies and and that
[1:40:23] shouts and speaks in tongues plenty that
[1:40:25] works the gospel but let show me a man
[1:40:27] that's down on his heart troubled over
[1:40:29] the sins of the world show me a preacher
[1:40:31] that can stand today and condemn those
[1:40:33] denominations show my preacher that'll
[1:40:35] stand and condemn them things he better
[1:40:37] not he'll be kicked out that's his Meal
[1:40:39] Ticket amen
[1:40:45] listen as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:40:48] shall it be at the coming of the son of
[1:40:49] man he says oh the tens of thousands
[1:40:52] there was there were out of tens of
[1:40:54] thousands there were three saved you'd
[1:40:56] say to me preacher what about all of
[1:40:58] those thousands that's going uh to come
[1:41:01] up with him no brother that's made up of
[1:41:03] many
[1:41:04] generations two times brother brandom
[1:41:06] talked in that message if I remember
[1:41:08] right of what he thought and I said I
[1:41:11] hope what brother brandham thinks and
[1:41:13] the way that he thought it I hope he's
[1:41:18] wrong you don't hear preacher say that
[1:41:20] too often I hope he's wrong for the
[1:41:23] statement that he's about to
[1:41:27] make I'll be
[1:41:29] surprised if it doesn't come out of this
[1:41:34] generation I'll be surprised if it
[1:41:36] doesn't come out straight is the gate
[1:41:39] narrow is the way and few there'll be
[1:41:41] that find it oh I know the churches what
[1:41:43] they say if you put your name on the
[1:41:44] book and become a member you're all
[1:41:46] right there's no such scripture as that
[1:41:48] if everything that's got its name on the
[1:41:50] book in the church there'll be millions
[1:41:52] and billions times billions everything
[1:41:54] will go and all kinds of spirits will be
[1:41:56] in there then what kind of condition
[1:41:58] will Heaven be
[1:42:00] amen oh
[1:42:02] my let me warn you this morning church
[1:42:05] be careful take time today in our we
[1:42:08] take time in our self-righteous
[1:42:10] self-sufficient generation of hypocrisy
[1:42:13] that we're living in an hour when men
[1:42:15] and women stand in churches and in pews
[1:42:17] and sing anthems of God walk out of the
[1:42:19] church smoke cigarettes drink whiskey go
[1:42:21] to dances live like the world tell dirty
[1:42:23] smutty jokes call themselves Christians
[1:42:25] men and women who walk from the pulpit
[1:42:27] and from church and from the place of
[1:42:28] the power of the Resurrection where the
[1:42:31] sign the same Messiah sign is a moving
[1:42:34] among them and not be a new creature in
[1:42:36] Christ there's something
[1:42:38] wrong how many knows that God used
[1:42:41] brother bam he used the him to discern
[1:42:44] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:42:46] but he was in Africa just one sign and
[1:42:48] 30,000 would come to the altar come to
[1:42:51] America and he doesn't they say well I
[1:42:53] guess that's a pretty good
[1:42:56] service how many knows when God came and
[1:42:58] he did that Messiah sign it was the last
[1:43:02] sign before Sodom
[1:43:04] burn but Abram said when the come
[1:43:06] Prophet comes on the scene look out
[1:43:08] judgment's on its
[1:43:10] way we won't go into the justice of God
[1:43:12] and so forth but let me just let me go
[1:43:14] on here moving new creature there's
[1:43:17] something wrong when papers can blast it
[1:43:19] from coast to coast back and forth from
[1:43:20] the Frozen regions of the North to the
[1:43:22] tropical jungles of the South God sends
[1:43:25] it people constantly turn their back on
[1:43:27] it then what can we say what can we do
[1:43:30] we turn on scriptures and say straight
[1:43:33] is the gate and narrow is the way and
[1:43:36] few there will be that will find it amen
[1:43:40] I'd like to liken that that generation
[1:43:43] to this day when we got millions joining
[1:43:45] churches we've got tens of thousands and
[1:43:48] God comes down to live in his church
[1:43:50] again to do the same things that he did
[1:43:52] to make himself the same yesterday today
[1:43:55] and forever and people turn their back
[1:43:57] from it constantly I mean that's what
[1:44:00] exactly what the church world
[1:44:02] did
[1:44:04] amen some to be popular some to keep
[1:44:08] from having to make a choice it's forced
[1:44:10] to the people you have to make a choice
[1:44:14] you've got to say yes or no you'll never
[1:44:18] leave that door the same person that you
[1:44:20] came in
[1:44:23] you can't do it you've got a choice to
[1:44:25] make make it for Christ this morning
[1:44:32] amen
[1:44:34] amen praise the
[1:44:37] Lord then he says now someone would say
[1:44:40] to me now wait a
[1:44:45] minute Matthew
[1:44:50] 17 Matthew 7 see the scripture says many
[1:44:54] will come to me in that day and say Lord
[1:44:57] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[1:44:59] in thy name cast out devils and in thy
[1:45:01] name did many wonderful works then I
[1:45:06] will profess to them I never knew you
[1:45:08] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[1:45:12] how many believe that this is the hour
[1:45:14] of soul
[1:45:16] searching every individual in here
[1:45:18] everybody you have to search your soul
[1:45:23] now I'm going to give you a couple
[1:45:24] quotes of brother bam and how we what we
[1:45:26] really want to be amen because how many
[1:45:28] I
[1:45:30] I okay this is what I thought about when
[1:45:32] he said I doubt a dozen are
[1:45:34] going I thought well guess what I guess
[1:45:37] it's down to 11 brother Tommy down 11
[1:45:40] who wants to make it
[1:45:42] 10 oh that's the way I'm talking about
[1:45:46] that's right we got a bunch of said No
[1:45:48] 10 how about nine how about eight seven
[1:45:51] six better get hand up
[1:45:54] quick amen why because you got to
[1:45:57] believe that you are got one if it's
[1:46:00] just a dozen boy I'm telling you I got I
[1:46:03] got number 12 I may be the last but I I
[1:46:05] got I got a number here amen that's the
[1:46:09] way we've got to see
[1:46:11] it that's and that just in case you
[1:46:14] didn't understand that's where I hope
[1:46:17] brother bandam was wrong you know that
[1:46:19] he doubt it well I hope he's wrong about
[1:46:22] that I hope there's a whole lot more
[1:46:24] than that to go and he said he didn't
[1:46:26] know it was not any kind of a prophecy
[1:46:29] but looking at it because you got to
[1:46:31] look it Through The Eyes of the prophet
[1:46:33] he seen what people did with
[1:46:37] Jesus when he came and proved himself
[1:46:39] and how they ministers in the back Rose
[1:46:41] when he begin to say the same thing that
[1:46:44] Paul said you know I was not disobedient
[1:46:46] to the heavenly vision and then he begin
[1:46:49] to tell of how he was you know packing
[1:46:53] water for his dad and a voice and there
[1:46:56] they
[1:47:00] go boy it's it's G to be it's G to be
[1:47:04] some kind of day judgment day it is
[1:47:08] going to be some kind of
[1:47:11] day they'll come to me and say oh we did
[1:47:13] this that or the other let me show you
[1:47:15] whenever I sent Malachi 4 to you I'll
[1:47:19] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:47:20] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[1:47:22] the Lord and you walked out on him right
[1:47:25] there you did it and you said this bad
[1:47:27] about it and this bad I never knew you
[1:47:30] be
[1:47:31] gone and that'll be to brother Bram said
[1:47:35] millions and billions I think I've
[1:47:38] actually got the quote where he says it
[1:47:39] that
[1:47:42] way my
[1:47:44] my there'll be tens of millions and
[1:47:47] billions of professed Christians
[1:47:49] staunched in their life that's going to
[1:47:51] miss it
[1:48:00] amen all
[1:48:03] right our work
[1:48:07] tomorrow our
[1:48:10] jobs we have to ask ourselves it's not
[1:48:12] all that
[1:48:14] important this right here that we're
[1:48:16] here
[1:48:17] tonight it's not important that we close
[1:48:19] at 8:30 right now is that right
[1:48:23] what's important is that we've got
[1:48:26] everybody with their hearts lined up
[1:48:28] with
[1:48:30] God have your heart lined up with God so
[1:48:36] that you can say like Enoch the Bible
[1:48:38] says that he had this testimony that he
[1:48:42] pleased
[1:48:44] God I'll never have to tell you sisters
[1:48:46] not to wear makeup I'll never have to
[1:48:49] tell you not to cut your hair I'll never
[1:48:51] have to tell you not to wear pants
[1:48:54] or two tightest skirts I'll never have
[1:48:56] to do any of that if you are living a
[1:48:58] life to where you're wanting to please
[1:49:01] God all those things will take care of
[1:49:06] themselves can I say a little bit more
[1:49:09] I'll never have to say well yeah I wish
[1:49:11] you would get to church more why do you
[1:49:12] miss church so
[1:49:14] much if you want to please God when them
[1:49:17] doors are open you'll try to be in
[1:49:19] there thank you Lord Jesus that's right
[1:49:25] yeah amen that's what we want we are not
[1:49:28] leaving out those doors the same as we
[1:49:30] came I don't know about you but that God
[1:49:33] has given us dresswear he has given us a
[1:49:36] word a perfect Vindicated word even
[1:49:40] brother bam says I'm dressing the
[1:49:43] bride how many believe that he's
[1:49:45] dressing the bride this message will
[1:49:47] dress you it will have you ready for a
[1:49:51] body ch
[1:49:54] it will it'll have me I said you it'll
[1:49:59] have me ready for a body
[1:50:02] change I'm here to tell you if camela
[1:50:05] gets it I'm going to be watching for my
[1:50:07] left ones and me if Trump gets it I'm
[1:50:10] going to be watching for my loved on I'm
[1:50:12] looking for a Rapture to happen at any
[1:50:17] time amen you better be ready for an
[1:50:20] hour well now we got the Bible and the
[1:50:23] reason I read that but if the servant
[1:50:25] says the Lord delayeth his coming trumps
[1:50:28] in now we can relax and you better watch
[1:50:32] out you better watch out maybe it was
[1:50:36] fulfilled amen and the next one is a
[1:50:38] Rapture the church when you don't think
[1:50:40] he's going to come that's when he'll
[1:50:42] come but the believer's got his eyes
[1:50:45] open and he's watching for every
[1:50:47] time Lord I know you do things in simple
[1:50:50] ways sometimes and people go right over
[1:50:52] the top of of it
[1:50:55] amen it was quite something brother Bram
[1:50:58] said all these things are supposed to
[1:50:59] happen yet the doors closed this out of
[1:51:00] the other and he said could all happen
[1:51:02] by morning we could be
[1:51:04] gone amen so be ready God bless
[1:51:10] you amen who are they that's going just
[1:51:14] a few will be saved just remember very
[1:51:16] few you be one of
[1:51:20] them let's all say I I am one of
[1:51:24] them I'm one of
[1:51:29] them

[1:51:34] stuff like only
[1:51:36] 12 amen who are they brother bam I don't
[1:51:40] know nobody else
[1:51:42] knows we work out our own salvation with
[1:51:46] fear and trembling but you be lined up
[1:51:49] with God if your heart don't beat just
[1:51:52] with that Bible then there's something
[1:51:56] wrong there's something wrong no matter
[1:51:58] what your church says you can't go by it
[1:52:01] you got to go by what God said this is
[1:52:03] the book that you're going to be judged
