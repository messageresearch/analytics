========================================

the mind of christ that's the same mind that should be in us all there's no differences in christ everyone is the same and i interest thee also true yolk fellow help those womans with labor with me in the gospel with clement and also with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the book of life and i'm sure all of you rejoice in the fact knowing that god has put your name in the book of life rejoice in the lord always again i say rejoice you know you like i said you'll see plaques with some of these let your moderation be known unto all man that the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god you know and that's pretty important here god doesn't want warriors if it's one of the things i know about the can you look can you get a ray from worrying no but worrying won't do any good it won't change anything i know from a fact i i can only i hate to say that again but i can only speak for myself i know that you can get so stressed out in life or so stressed in a situation you can do all that worrying and i realized a long time ago that that won't change anything god can change it but you worrying about it isn't going to change anything doesn't mean that you don't take it serious but there's a difference between allowing your body and your mind to be totally worried and an anxiety over something and sometimes letting it go and i'll just read a few of these scriptures that the lord spoke about in psalms 100 you might some of you won't be able to keep up with me because i got this thompson chain reference bible psalm 127 verse 2 it is vain for you to rise up early in the sit-up way to eat the bread of sorrows for so he that giveth his beloved sleep so david's saying here it's best to put your cares upon the lord and not worry about it matthew the sixth chapter and the 25th verse it says therefore i say unto you take no thought of your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink yet for your body what you shall put on it is not life more than meat and the body more than raiment that's true as true in that day as it is for today you know you can't make yourself an inch taller you can't make yourself an inch shorter you know there's nothing you can do to change who you are you just got to yield and he goes on to say luke 10th chapter and the 44th earth jesus answered and said on to martha martha thou are careful and troubled about many things you know and this goes to the story where mary and all the other ones were at jesus feet and martha was doing all the serving and she got to a point where she wanted her sister to help her and jesus said her sister had chosen the right path and it goes on luke the 12th chapter and the 29th verse seek ye not what you shall eat or what you shall drink neither you be of a doubtful mind and basically it's the same thing today you know you don't have to be doubtful god will provide for you doesn't mean it's going to come when you think it should come sometimes it doesn't happen that way you just have to be willing to yield right though let god have his way and then in luke the 21st chapter and the 34th verse take heed to yourselves at least at any time your hearts be overturned charged with suffering uh it's actually suffering and drunkenness and cares of his of this life so that the day come upon you unaware and i was thinking this morning as i was reading this scripture in the tom thompson chain reference bible i'll go back to it then i read of ephesians 4 and 6 verse it says to be careful in nothing but going back to this verse right here you know i think that's where we're at this morning i'm not saying that's where you're at as an individual looking at the clock before i go on a different avenue but i that's where every where the world is at this morning is and i was writing this down who who who am i or who are you you know there's a spiritual picture of that god has of you and an image of you that only god knows about you in that image and there's you're either in that image you're either a true saint of god or you're an unbeliever and that's the problem that's what the scripture is dealing with this morning here that i just read are you are you doing the things that the lord wants you to do in the day that we're living in are you just surfing a long life with no real responsibility or no real attitude for the things of the lord are you are you just are you just mingling in it are you just just going with the flow and not really consecrating yourself to the things of the lord this morning and that's where i think we're at as a as a society you know people aren't say they what they are on the outside but they're but the inside is not what they're professing to be and i all the preachers have been saying lately you know you don't get out of this life without god proving who you are this morning and then god knows who you are this morning you don't get out of this life without a true relationship with jesus christ you know i'll just finish with this i'm i'm all over the plate this morning but i would say the most i say this a lot you can't say it enough i mean you know the one thing that life has taught me about whether it's coming up here for the last 20 or so years you know if you're looking at people to be an example then you're you're starting off at the wrong foot if don't get me wrong brother branham as an example your pastor is an example but if you're trusting that example more than you should when something happens to that example it might be your father it might be whoever it is if you put them on a pedestal higher than they should be in your life and something happens to them and they fall then you start wavering or questioning your experience this morning or were you trusting christ or were you trusting their word or her word and that's what the scriptures deal with this morning that foundation that we have this morning has to be built on the word of god in jesus christ does it mean that you don't use people are good you know the bible says you know look at the the right example follow the right example but it never says to put i don't why i'm saying this don't ever put that example on a pedestal where it shouldn't be the only one that should be on that pedestal that you're serving and trying to image in your life is jesus christ in his example that's the image that you should be footing before anything else in your life and and i just know from what's going on in the world today there's a lot out there trying to take away your focus from what it really should be on this morning but don't ever let the enemy take your focus off of jesus christ this morning brother david this morning if we could sing that song a little course this morning more than ever before lord i love you if we could this morning and you're loving with all of your heart amen oh more than ever before lord i love you than ever before lord i need you [Music] oh more than ever [Music] is that how you feel in your heart this morning oh more than ever before lord i love you yes lord [Music] [Music] more than ever before i want to tell you i love you now more than ever [Music] yes lord so glad your mercy [Music] has followed me [Music] so glad you found me and you set me free [Applause] so glad i'm [Music] are

so glad i'm yourself [Music] so glad i'm yours amen you love him with all of your heart this morning god bless you it's good to see each and everyone out this morning and i just realized i made another mistake this morning and i wrote the wrong page number down for such love page 187 this morning amen that god should love a sinner such as i amen oh that god should love a sinner such as i should learn to change oh my sorrow into bliss no rest till he had planned to perfume such wondrous love such love such wondrous love oh that god should love a sinner such as i how wonderful is love like this that christ should join so freely in the sea although it meant his death on calvary did it [Music] meant by nobody this lovely vine that rain [Applause] such one christmas oh that god should love a sinner such as i how wonderful is love like these [Music] the savior bled and died [Music] oh love such one raised love such love such one christmas that god should love a sinner such as i look like this [Music] and now he takes me to his heart aside oh he asked me not to fill the servant's place for such love such wondrous love all that god should love a sinner such as i oh how wonderful is love like this once again this morning grace love such love such wondrous love all that god should love a sinner such as i how wonderful is love like amen are you thankful for his love this morning hey man god bless you you may be seated this morning it's good to have each and everyone here like we said those that are watching on facebook our shut-ins we pray god will bless you this morning and those that are not feeling well and just pray the lord speak to your heart it's we had several gone out last week for vacation we still have some out this week but appreciate each and everyone is back this morning and thankful that the lord has kept his hand upon you and and uh we turned into church this morning and janet said look at sister jamison's van down the side of and i thought oh no and i remember her name she told me this morning who she was so i wouldn't forget but i asked her i said what happened she said let my family borrow my van they brought it back damaged i was thankful that everything was all right and that's the first thing i thought of oh no and you know these people are are just crazy how they drive and they just and you know we just i'm thankful the lord watches over

my tray my truck and my trailer because you know that's 50 foot they're behind so i think lord and jan will tell me she said why are you lagging so i said i'm used to my truck people coming in sliding

glenn's always smiling he always has something good to say and amen he's not always honest because he always tells me i do a good job and i know it's different but but he sure makes me feel good amen i was kidding about singing and said please sing on key and i don't do that so i shouldn't tell anybody else but you know i was thinking as he talked about brother brad and brother thomas and we think about the things and brother brad preached the sermon this then some time ago and he's talking about a they went to eat and ministered that he was with a friend he had asked the lady and he said you know discerning the spirits of the people that you're dealing with and he said here i was and i began to think about that and the other it's been a few weeks ago i went through burger king to get something to eat and get some ice and and uh this young lady was there at the window and i said well how are you today she said i'm not doing very good i don't feel good of course you know the first thing that popped in my mind i'm giving her money and getting changed she's got coveted that's just the first thing in my mind i thought well i'm not going to worry about it and i thought you know she doesn't feel good and as soon as i pulled up someone said what's wrong with you you back up and you ask her if you can pray for her and that sermon come in my mind brother brad and i said there's nobody behind me i backed up trailer and all i backed up and she said what's wrong and i said i want to ask you something i said you said you don't feel good do you she said no i don't and i said well i just felt on my heart that i heard to pray for you and she said no i said well let me have your hand i want to lay hands on you and pray for you and the whole time in my mind my brain's saying you don't need to be doing this but i thought you know if he's in me there's nothing on her that's going to bother me because greater is he that's in me that he that's in the world and i began to pray for her and i left she said you have a blessed day and i thought you know that i could yield and and take heed of what had been said and to feel what someone felt not just because of me i could basically went on down the road and prayed for when i wrote that's not what god wanted because see i had to get out of my comfort zone to ask her if i could pray for her because i don't know her i wouldn't know if i met her today i don't even think i'd recognize her but god wants us to get out of her comfort zone and be a ministry to him not just for the brad and brother thomas and brother daniel but all of us this morning come ahead brother steve it's been requested that him and sister becky would sing but i just appreciate that song this morning and god help us to be a witness of what we hear you know the bible says not to be just a here only but a doer and you know sometimes we you know it's like tommy told me he said you know the world they don't care to tell you what they think i think it's time we tell them what we know is true don't you amen god bless you this morning [Music] how many times must i prove how much i love you [Music] how many ways how many times from trouble for you do know just how much i love you [Music] didn't i wake you up this morning were you clothed in your right mind when you walked into a problem then i stepped right in on time when you got weak a long life's

i believe it's kim amen jacob and leah right so praise the lord it's good to have them with us this morning amen stand with me we'll just get into the word of god amen and see what the lord will have for us this morning amen we uh amen want to continue on a basically part two of wednesday i really didn't know what to minister on this morning and just kept pondering and pondering and praying so this is what i feel like the lord just let my heart speak amen and so wednesday wednesday i believe we spoke on harmony amen rapturing harmony where everything works together amen how beautiful it is amen to be in harmony even especially with god amen and so this morning it's going to be we're going to kind of uh uh talk on the other side of harmony we're going to talk about disharmony disharmony amen amen and so may the lord help us in that right i mean y'all pray for me amen god bless you let's bow our heads before we open the bible lord jesus we come before you thank the lord jesus to be able to assemble ourselves together in your name lord jesus and having the reactionality in our hearts of what you said when you said that wherever two or three are gathered there you will be in our midst lord and we truly believe god that you are in our midst lord jesus we feel you lord in our heart and we know that you're here lord jesus because you've always proven it to us lord and we ask god that you'll just help me lord get out of the way that you might use your gift to speak to your people may we go from here better people to serve you lord jesus and we for all the health and the blessings and everything that you bestow upon us lord we can't even begin underneath them all but lord this morning as we look at this thought of this harmony and what it's all about lord we ask god you just help me lord and as i read your word father give us the concept of it lord jesus speak to our hearts this morning in jesus name amen and amen turn to bibles and i'm going to go to the one scripture first of all i have quite a few scriptures so i'm going to do a little bit of reading here first let's go to matthew if you will amen matthew the 10th chapter and i want to begin with the help of the lord after i read the description we want to go over and we want to talk about the purpose of god amen because we spoke wednesday night about the will of god amen and how did those that are in the bride of christ the people of god the children of god they only want to do the will of god amen and god has a purpose god has a will amen there's something that god wants i mean that's what we desire whatever god wants and to understand his purpose amen in his ways and the ways of god in every aspect so chapter 10 of matthew will begin with verse 32 amen whosoever 10 32 whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before man him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven amen think not that i am come to send peace now how many knows there another place he says my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth divine to you amen how many know is it god god does give us peace every real christian has peace in his heart but i want to ask you a question right off the bat are you ready everybody awake do you have peace around you is there peace all around you it's a very tricky question huh is there peace everywhere it sounded like peace on the news last night does that sound like peace no no let me tell you something there's not going to be any peace around you no no no the only peace that you're gonna have is down in here this is the real peace down in here but the external and out there that's the world you're still in the world where there is no peace there's no peace for the wicked saith the lord and you're going to have be all around the wicked as long as you're here on earth the only place he's going to have peace around you is in heaven amen we're not there yet amen now notice here how that jesus does give us peace but think about this how did he also came to do something besides listen what he says think not that i have come to send peace on earth amen i am not condescend peace by the sword ma that's quite something for him to declare that he didn't come to send peace but a sword and i like this sword and what he brings it to because he says i am come to set a man at variance i like that amen at variance in other words there's going to be a little friction there's going to be a difference a variation are you with me against his father and daughter against her mother and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law now do you reckon that this applies to believers not supposed to no no no no the bodies to be unified you'd be you this this just comes to me can i speak speak to here listen to this if i can quickly find in colossians here you know for us it's like this therefore i beseech you this is in ephesians 4 i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness and long-suffering forbearing one another in love putting up with each other endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace because there is one body amen there is one spirit go ahead i'm waiting amen how many know we're all baptized into one body by one spirit variance comes when you don't have the same spirit as somebody else you don't have the same goals as somebody else you don't have the same thought as somebody else all right one uh hope of your calling one lord amen we ain't gotta fuss about heaven and two three different gods no one lord we have one faith we have one baptism we have one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen back to our scripture over here all right come to say that variance his father and daughter shall be they out of his own household wow he that loveth and father mother more than me is not worthy of me or he that love a son or daughter more than he is not worthy of me and he that taketh not of his cause and followed after me is not worthy of me he had findeth his life shall lose it and who that loses his life for my sake shall find it amen may god add his blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated oh praise the lord disharmony when i got to thinking about this harmony i got to thinking about a lot of words that go along with this harmony amen like adversity and now first of all some this harmony is something that is not working together it doesn't have the same purpose therefore it doesn't have the same goal because your purpose is usually your goal how many there's a purpose there's a purpose while we're here this morning there's a an achievement we're trying to achieve and that's heaven amen oh my well let me just slow down and go to ephesians and let's look at something and this is both to us this morning and certainly will apply to the world out there amen in ephesians if you want to go with me ephesians 1. ephesians 1 and we'll begin with verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ let me put this down a little bit according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of notice this were not a good pleasure of his will amen to the praise of the glory of his great swearing hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we also have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now notice now i want to bring something here wherein he hath abounded towards us all wisdom and prudence wise and prudent amen now one place he talks about he says he hides his hides himself from the wise and prudent and reveal it to babes such as learn would learn but here paul is saying that if you're a christian you're going to be given wisdom and prudence amen and this is the thing having made known unto us the mystery of his will praise be to god how many know that is what a believer desires and longs for all of the earth it's a mystery to the world of what the will of god is they don't know what the will of god is that's right but you have been made known what the will of god is i'm here to tell you if you are living in this life in this world and you don't understand why you're here or what you're here for or who you you are in a confused horrible nightmare of a state that's the world during a nightmare horrible state they don't even know if they're man or woman anymore you can't even say woman i don't know what they want you to say now female i i don't know come on folks it's terrible people don't know what they are let me tell you light is going out light is going out people are going into darkness more and more the lights are going out to this world folks and the fire is fixing to fall just like it always has all right let me go on now notice having made known unto them us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he's going to gather together in one all things that are in christ praise god both which are in heaven and which are in earth now how many knows he's going to gather all that is in christ to himself in the rapture we're going to go to heaven and be with christ but the bible also talks about it he's also going to do a bunch of binding and a bunch of bundling together of what the tares they're also going to be gathered in one isn't that right but what's it gonna be for for the fire for the burning amen how many knows there's a fire coming heaven shall be on fire everything on earth is gonna be completely burned just as sure as there was water that flooded the earth the whole earth is going to be burned amen second peter 3 amen there won't be anything left is it going to burn amen the elements shall melt with fervent heat the bible says and it's right around the corner not notice so it says both in heaven which are on earth and so forth but listen i like that according to his purpose he has made known to us the mystery of what his will is in ephesians the third chapter and i believe it's in if you want to follow me chapter 3 ephesians verse 8. and he's talking about how that god had called paul and struck him down the road to damascus and made him a minister right to the gentiles amen which in other ages in verse 5 says was not made known unto the sons of men and it is as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit now that's how the whole mystery has been made known why god created the earth why are you hung assad why you on the moon why you made the animals why he made the earth why he made everything that he did that mystery has been made known you can now know the full purpose you can know the full plan of god one place i believe it says that we have made known unto us the manifold wisdom of god manifold wisdom it may be in here let's see verse 8 unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men he really like for all men to see this everybody should see it nate no person in the world but shouldn't see what paul was trying to say to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery what's it all about oh my you don't have that question do you i don't have that question but there's billions out there that have that question what's it all about what's the whole plan for because don't get me wrong god knew that be just like this he knew everything about him he knew that down through the dark ages from the time of christ till the 1500s you know 68 million christians would give their lives be thrown in the lions then be crucified by the droves be killed with the sword but even jesus says you know be faithful unto death and i will give you a crown of life having a sword stuck through your heart having your head chopped off it's not that big a deal all right oh yeah it seems like it but no after that you're going to live throughout this further than the sun and the moon any any of them ever eternity amen the persecution the trials the hardships the things that you suffer paul said is not to be compared with the things that's going to be given you for what you suffer for christ folks i'm here to tell you it's going to be a little different because this is the same message that's over but just a new angle is that okay this morning it's gonna be a little different amen they don't unders people don't understand the purpose of god they don't understand his ways they don't understand his plan isn't that right and that's why they are in the shape that they're in i believe that it was paul had said in hebrews about israel and how they could never get it they could never get it they kept disbelieving now the worst thing that you can have is unbelief in the word of god unbelief and they kept this believing they kept commemorating they kept complaining god would bring a mighty hand and bring them out of egypt and plagues and everything that happened and water turned into blood fleas jumping in the the king's bed chamber and under his sheets and biting him in the legs and biting him all over and he just sweet i don't know but he'd drive me crazy we drove him crazy i'll tell you what he said just go just go god did these miracles amen and they went out rejoicing and god took them all the way to the red sea and brought them to a dead end and then they what opened their mouth and didn't believe god did wasn't there enough graves in egypt we had it better back then and they said together where where's the gods now that he delivered you out of egypt and so forth and did all these miracles he's still here he's still with you amen and why did they not enter into the kingdom why did they not jesus even set their everyone dead why did they all perish because they didn't understand something why will this world perish and everybody in it that doesn't believe in christ because they don't understand they never get it and mostly because they refuse to believe because your whole world your whole world is created by the things that you believe and accept let me tell you this what we're fighting for is simple little ideas like uh people are fighting for the right to have a choice you know to have a choose choose whether they want what they want to do with their body well i have some news for them maybe that's not just their body anymore that that's little one's body huh and they're throwing a big fuss but can't take because they can't spill blood brains and guts and everything else and kill all these big people having a fit let me tell you something what that is that is that is uh a medieval that is just evil pure and simple evil i don't care what you say people are having a fit because they can't kill little unborn babies not right in their mind they're medieval amen and then you wonder why they have their teenage kids and going to school and killing everybody well mama killed her baby that they can kill all them they got a right to do that i cannot have a right to do whatever i want kill anybody i won't they got a right to kill you see the philosophy they don't understand amen but what i'm saying is and the other idea is that hey you know they have a right both of them claim to have rights you know but it's an idea it's just a little it's a difference isn't it it's adversity it's disharmony because they don't have the same idea let me tell you something as soon as you get a different idea than somebody else while there's not going to be harmony in there that's why paul was saying you know you're one body one faith one lord one baptism one in god and father of all who is in all and through all that's how it's supposed to be supposed to be harmony supposed to be one america is supposed to be one you know i'm thinking the other day i said man how can you make can you imagine running any kind of a government with a putin huh oh my ungodly heathen nation don't believe in god you do something they don't like we're going out behind that witch head and you're going to disappear and we're never going to see you again that's that justice huh my thought is that man ain't no kingdom ever was fit to rule or reign or anything unless he was a christian we did our very best we had the best nation on the earth when christian men ran it amen we were founded upon christianity huh on our on our dollar even god we trust can you imagine all the eighth can you all the americans that hate that thing they hate that oh i got oh i hate that thing huh they do yeah you wait till the tribulation period until they come after the christian the conservatives and those that call themselves christians because they're already saying they need to die hello everything's coming to a head people people are gonna become as bad as they can become coming to a headstone same with the bride of christ coming to a head all right so now notice over in israel notice how that they tempted listen he says listen he was talking about them hard not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my mighty works 40 years they saw my mighty works for 40 years do you realize malachi 4 says behold i'll send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord he'll turn the hearts of children back to the father he will send us elijah before the great and dreadful day of the lord god didn't have to send elijah jesus christ didn't have to come in this generation and discern the thoughts in the tenth of the heart like he did with the woman that dwell millions of times the sick were raised the dead were raised and all the miracles that he did he didn't but he did it because of grace because of mercy for this world i'm telling you right now because we are in the condition of it because people did not accept it didn't receive it they don't want it israel they lost they they had to go back out uh you know and and uh they could never go into the promised land god forbid them to when your father's tempted me prove me somebody works 40 years where if i was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their hearts and they have not known my ways how many know it's important to understand and to be able to get the concept of what god's thinking about what is god thinking what was god thinking amen how is his ways what is he like what does he like to do what does he do amen praise be to god why are we in the place that we are now this is a it's really a global message really when you think about it what is what's in god's mind why did it allow humanity to fall adam and eve to fall he allowed that to happen or if he wouldn't want it to happen he wouldn't let it happen it'll never happen isn't that right now i was driving down the road the other day and this is where it began to multiply my mind i began to think of them what if we'd never fail how many know we'd have been in perfect harmony the whole time there would have never been any disharmony it would be perfect a garden of eden the lions and the oh my they not ripped nobody apart you can cuddle up to him and oh does everybody everybody everyone was everything was perfect they didn't know any wrong they didn't know anything they didn't have any opposition so to speak but he allowed him to fall and when man fell he became self-destructive i know his man destroys himself most of the time no we never no no no no no humanity does not learn from history we're repeating it right now humanity is repeating it exactly like they did in the days of noah man's mind is what's continually evil all the imagination of man's heart was continuously and that's how it's become wrong it's become right right it's become wrong they're going backwards just like the prophet said it it flips so to speak goes right back amen we become a bunch of heathens again with nose rings and earrings and tattoos and everything else going right back to heathen and after being christians a christian nation always going back and we're heading back to destruction again going back to being destroyed again god will have to destroy he will destroy it because man corrupted himself i mean that's what's happening man he's corrupting himself and then i began to think i began to wonder i thought you know in the midst of all of that god has a plan god makes a way for man 100 god makes a way for a man not to be destructive not to be wrong not to be sinful but to have a relationship with god and he allowed that to show you that we are empty we were born in sin shaken in anybody come into this world speaking lies and jesus says you must be born again you can never be a christian unless you do like jesus said unless you're willing to take your cross and follow on me and hate your own life also if you're not willing to die to yourself you cannot be my disciple unless a man is born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of you've got to have a new birth and that is the holy spirit coming into your life are you with me god has to come in there and the reason that man goes the way that he does he's just born to it's like in his genetics i thought man it's in man's genetics to fall it's a man's genetics to go the wrong way to corrupt himself to get worse all the time it's in his makeup but most of all it's in his nature you can't fight your nature huh you know how hard it is to quit smoking cigarettes and nicotine didn't get on you and you just can't hardly let them go it's a tough battle it's very strong and outside of the holy spirit amen and it takes because listen the one thing i want to emphasize this morning is that god knew that we would be in that champ he allowed us to get in that shape but like paul said he says the first adam took us into death but the second adam picked us up out of that he created and brought a second atom so we can get out of that if you chose to i hear some amen because you're glad to be out of that and like i said wednesday talking about god amen that he uh all things work together for good to them that are called according to his purpose right those that are called according to his purpose and don't move he pressed that predestinates he predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son his real purpose was to have men and women he wants sons and daughters like himself that's his objective amen that's his objective and that's what the whole plan of calvary wants to pay the price for mankind oh and god was so generous that he didn't just ration it to certain ones but he said whosoever will let him come whosoever will let him come amen but knowing who would and who wouldn't praise be to god you love him can we go a little longer this morning well we ain't even passed time yet so we ain't got nothing to worry about i like that according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world how many knows god knew everything before it ever happened he knew all things he knew who would want to and who wouldn't amen folks when i think about having been out there at 18 19 year old loving ac dc van halen and rock and roll and pot and everything else huh then i think about there was something down on the inside of my heart said there's got to be something more to life than this and god to begin to call down there and says you know there's a greater calling than this there's got to be more and i got the hunger and i got the thirst after righteousness because the bible says you are blessed if you have a hunger you are blessed if you desire god because so many people don't even have to desire that's the saddest thing that ever could happen to a person from that i have no desire for god and i'm guarantee you what if he knew you before the foundation of the world there's gonna be something down there there's gonna be something down there that pulls you jesus said it this way he said all the father has given me will it just say under your seats all that he has given will will come to me and i will lose or not i will cast them out i will lose none of them oh in the midst of adversity in the midst of discord huh because how many knows that's what the devil brings he brings discord amen you want to see the beginning of disharmony let's read the scripture on the beginning the creation of disharmony the devil was in heaven right the devil at one time was god's right hand man but something came into his heart and then he says how are thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did streak in the nations for are we becoming weak we're becoming really weak a nation divided itself cannot stand what do you reckon won't happen we're so divided lying politicians will run saying we're going to bring unity we're going to bring everybody do they not even a little bit amen and i can't blame them folks i'd be i'd be i wouldn't be unified with the wrong thing either i'd be kind of politicians that stood for what you believed stand for what's right not just give in to every other thing amen anyway listen which that's weak in the nations for thou i set in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit upon the mount of the congregation on the sides of the north i will ascend above the height of the cloud i will be like the most high in other words i'm going to be like god people are going to worship me isn't that exactly what hollywood stars do basketball football stars to musicians and everybody else they love for people to worship them amen and it's all comes from the devil the devil wants you to worship him and all you got to do is take his idea i mean that's all you got to do is take his will do what he wants you to do that's why the dark ages they just wanted you to acknowledge just kiss the cross just tell just do what we tell you to do and we'll let you live they want you to submit to their will that's what the devil wants you to do this morning submit to his will and he's got you but not the bride of christ we will not submit to their his will amen that's where it started that's where the dissension came that's where amen that disharmony began and what happened there was war in heaven there was a battle in heaven amen that was a great big split in heaven [Music] god cast them out he says there's no unity here i believe in you in order of unity you have to have the same idea one faith how many know is that a church has to have the same the same goal amen and there was that was where the first one came along how many knows the second one was found down in the garden of eden when the devil planted in eve's mind that god wouldn't really do what he did but he'd know that you'd be like god knowing good and evil he impregnated her he put in her mind the wrong seed and she believed him oh that's why my my hairs are great thanks eve that's why i'm getting old when my arms and hands are getting all wrinkled huh getting more feeble every day thanks eve she did it that's why paul says she's not allowed back here i forbid a woman to speak she has a question asked her husband at home she's the weaker vessel she can be deceived much easier she was deceived adam knew what he was doing he was going out and for her sake to save her he knew better amen oh my praise be to god so you think about that that's where the second major one was where he brought in and and there was oh my think about it when when when david could kill goliath he could kill bears and everything else but the devil put that lust in his mind for beth sheba isn't that right now let me tell you something i will talk a little bit about two kinds of uh disharmonies god will bring disharmony in your life actually you bring it upon yourself there's one kind that you bring it upon yourself david brought this harmony he brought chaos he brought the whole nation was in turmoil for years many soldiers died fighting absalom and different things that happened and all kinds of all kinds of things happened because of what david did the disharmony that david brought upon himself but then there's other things that god allows he's you know i chasing you as children how many knows god god allows disharmony to come just like job he allowed all those things to happen to job to try him to test him amen just as our trials today here all they were all allowed by god this is all part of the plan isn't that a great thing to be able to say to know that this whole thing is all part of the plan it is absolutely part of the plan and people say well where is god in all this oh he's there they just don't want him they kick him out of schools now they're all getting shot huh they kick him out of our our our government buildings our law officers the ten commandments they wanted they want him out on them they want to say where's god at let me tell you something god put us on free moral agency and if you don't use that free moral agency right it is chaos that's right free moral agency you can just about do whatever you want it to do right now huh that's a tremendous tool but if you don't submit to god and put him in a control tower folks you're it's kind of like this let me explain this whole thing kind of in a simple thing it's like all these vehicles that i hear are sitting in lots and they can't sell them because there's a certain wire harness that they don't have just a simple little 25 wire harness perhaps and it will not run and they can't do anything with it until they get that wild harness and that's the way it is with every human being you're not ready to operate you're not ready to run until you get harnessed with the holy ghost until you get the baptism of the holy ghost you're not fit to live until you're ready to die you're not fit to live until you've got the holy ghost without the holy ghost as the prophet said you are nothing but a natural brute beast you are worse than an animal monkey still kill other monkeys because they're not part of the tribe but listen when they will kill their own that's really bad you don't even see monkeys going amongst each other and just killing their own tribe huh man is a beast without god and people think well i'd never do this just give it time give it the right pressure let it meet the right circumstances and people can become utterly evil let your kids watch the wrong stuff in their bedrooms play those head blowing games and everything else desensitize the blood and everything else oh my it's all just getting right for it you all right this morning i hope i'm not too hard but i'm just preaching what i feel led to preach i hope that's good aren't you glad for grace i'm so glad for what christ did on calvary that's part how many knows that's part of the plan let me say it quick before i don't say it but the whole plan of god is that we would get saved and that we go into all the world and preach the gospel tell everybody that jesus loves them tell them all that christ died for you nancy pelosi christ died for you trump god christ died for every life he died for everybody what are you going to do about it christ died for every one of us what are you going to do about it all right jesus said if you're ashamed of me there's going to come a day where i'm going to be ashamed of you in other words in the midst of opposition in the midst of uh disharmony people that don't agree with you huh it's easy to confess to believe that i believe jesus but how about confessing unbelievers i'm a christian you're ashamed to confess christ he'll be ashamed to confess you now we've heard the phrase that life is not a flowery bed of ease god doesn't make it a flowery bed of ease for his children this whole world is not a flowery bed of ease it really isn't amen praise the lord i want to begin reading another one let's look at uh luke 6. let's look at luke 6 let's go to luke 6. let me just say this while i'm returning pages adversity is actually good for us huh if you had no adversity at all no adversity no problems nobody come against you huh what kind of person you be just kind of a dish rag i don't want to say it but i kind of know people that just go along with what everybody else does and says what is that called a rag we call it a dish rag somebody just molds to whatever comes along don't don't have real standing on something now i want you to look at this for a minute wait a minute yeah this is the scripture yeah on down there's quite a bit of reading let's go blessed are ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh [Applause] how many knows persecuted killed go hungry christians used to blessed are ye when men shall hate you and who knows he's saying look you're going to have some adversity here there's not always going to be harmony being a lot of disharmony in this world they're going to hate you and they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast your name out as evil not everything's going so good for the son of man's sake rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets but want to you that are rich now for you have reached your consolation war unto you that are full for ye shall hunger for unto you that laugh now for you shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you huh how many knows when you're a christian and stands for what for what's right you're not always going to be spoken well of when you do what you know is right people will hate you welcome to christianity why is it that jesus said one place i believe and he said well it may be down here if not i'll pick it up with the lord's help speak well i love you for the dear father is a false prophet but i say unto you which here love your enemies amen praise god how many know you're going to have enemies too good to them that hate you bless them that curse you this is the way of the lord this is the will of god how many believes that when the opposite comes against you when at when uh your adversaries come against you with hate what do you do hate back now we've learned that hate breeds hatred huh but return it with love bless them that curse you pray for them to despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek turn to him also the other have so much love of god and you can turn the other cheek huh think about it when somebody does you wrong what if nobody ever did you wrong you'd never know whether you're really a christian or not you could never exercise these things you could never love somebody that hates you if you didn't have anybody to hate you let me say this god allowed the devil only he who now let us will let until he be taken out of the way god allows it god allows all his adversity amen he knew this would be the setting for a christian gift to every man that asked us of the thee and him that taketh away thy goods asked him not again and as you would that men should do to you to you also to them you what thank have you hello notice how you start if you don't have disharmony huh if you don't have somebody that doesn't love you you will not be able to return it because listen to this let's just go on for sinners also love those that love them you see philosophy of christ what good is it if everybody just always loves you sure you love those that love you don't you everybody loves those that love them that's easy life's not a flower bed of ease never was meant to be christianity was not a flower bed it never even was meant to be and i have a feeling that there's going to be a lot more pressure on all of us are you ready there's going to be more pressure on every last one of us of whether we have the life of christ or whether we don't whether we can do these things and live this kind of life amen we'll be on greater display amen you know it's just had a little thought and i know it's just business but us that are in the dog business you know it's getting to where you can't ship them you cannot ship them unless unless you have a certain paper and if you do you better be under usda or they'll find you ten thousand dollars and they will come and shut you i know somebody that got shut down over a bunch of dogs huh you see the squeeze coming folks you can't buy or sell unless you belong that's just as fractions just getting closer and closer why do you think oh boy here we go why do you think the government wants their car once their hands on all of our cars wanted to bail out all the banks why do you think they want to bail out all the small businesses and all of it they're going to get their hands on everything and control everything you won't buy or sell unless you be a puppy or belong to the mark of the beast unless you belong to them that's what the bible says amen and if you do good to them they do good to you what thank have you wow jesus i like being good to know that he says this doesn't really count don't really count [Applause] because the sinners can do that but i expect more of you you're my child in it amen oh do you see where i'm going with this disharmony god allowed all this disharmony he allows this harmony to come in your life to get you to get down on your knees and get a little closer to god if everything always went easy you would just be a tissue you become a dishrag if you nobody ever opposed you amen and that's sad how many knows it's sad when we get to heaven there'll be no opposition anymore are you with me when we get over there nobody will say a crossword nobody else say something like i did wednesday i guess make no mistakes i made a mistake wednesday can you just say that is that all right josh i come out here you know i didn't hear josh say uh brother violet come out now you know because i've had that up happen up in indiana i didn't hear him coming out but he must have called me so i opened the door and looked sure enough he was saying yeah come on so i didn't hear it so i come out here and says brother jones will you come up say better now we're gonna have brother obama come on out and so forth i was telling him how to how to bring me out you know afterwards he told me he said i never did call you oh my this one that was on me that time he said you know i seen the door open and i just went yeah he was like come on you know i'm like there you go full of mistakes folks let me know that we need grace let me tell you something god created the world so that you have to forgive people i mean believe that forgive amen that heavenly father will forgive you god made it to where sometimes you know you've done wrong so you can do good to others he made adversity allowed adversity to sharpen you up to sharpen us up he allowed israel to go to the red sea to get hungry and thirsty and adversity oh it didn't work out the way they wanted that's just that's a run right to find out what you're made of amen and to form you into the image of christ how many believes that he wants to form us into the image of god's what scott's whole intention was they meant that we would come we would be in a fallen state he could pick us up he could mold us and he could shape us into sons and daughters of god he could work on us every day and make us better christians make us better pastors make us better dads make us better moms make us better communities he sure ain't doing not out there no but god is working somewhere yet if god's done working he's going to burn this place he's going to be done with when god gets done working on people and getting him ready to heaven he's going to get wipe it off the earth because it's bunch of muck it's a bunch of mess folks it's it's so corrupt and it has to get that corrupt and that's sad and we all know that it's because of those who do not those do not understand the plan of god don't understand amen that they need to give their life up they need to surrender to god let god have control of their life and all these things oh my you'd never have to worry listen ask the prophet put he says you know if everybody was filled with the holy ghost you could dismiss every police for we should truly defund the police brother brad we could defund the police if everybody be a christian if everybody come to the plan of god you could truly defund the police and you'd never have you could dismiss 9-1-1 oh we don't have a 9-1 in this community we're all christians that's right logan county todd county we don't have a 9-1-1 everybody there is christian wouldn't that be nice but we're not in heaven yet and no just because anybody wants yeah we still have 9-1-1 oh my you love the lord i'm just glad to be a part of the program part of the purpose of god it will scare me to death to think that i'm not a son of god or that i'm not a part of the program of god wouldn't it you how many glad to be a christian to know that god has done the work and i guess that's the one thing that when i was 20 years old when i that one thing that god quickened to me you are a you're my child you're a son of god you're not a son of the devil because there's lots of sons of the devil sons of the wicked one the bible says children of the wicked one the world's full of them and that's why these like it is they're still cane he's still murdering his brother he's still jealous he's still hateful just like the devil was in heaven he was jealous of god getting all the glory he wanted some glory same jealousy come down in the cane amen oh my god help us to allow disharmony to bring you closer to god and to have the mind of christ amen praise be to god all right just a couple words and we'll close look couple of words one of them is resistance resistance is in other words for disharmony somebody resists you you say something say no i don't agree with that do you know that's actually really really really terrible if what you're saying is this here not so much your word but you disagree with this you're going to hell you're going to perish the life that you have one day will not be anymore eternal life is this life that you have on the inside to have ceaseless ages of perfection in heaven the earth is a place of trial the earth is a pace of place of testing the earth is a place of proving who you are what you are what you'll stand for whether you'll stand or whether you'll fall whether you'll be a dishrag or you'll be a son and daughter of god amen that's what it's all about it's about grace amazing grace christ died for the sins of the whole world every sin that ever will be done that has been done all been paid for huh the pardon has been signed but it's not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon and that's the problem is people are not receiving it that's why the trouble is that is resistance defiance like goliath i defy the armies of the living god whoa none of us likes to be defied none of us likes to be resisted against how pleasant it is the bible says for brothers to dwell together in unity jesus christ came to save sinners a little louder we're all one with that amen you speak one thing and you get all agreement agreement opponent praise be to god resistance defiance to differ difference differences i guess we have differences of opinion has that ever been all that good for you not really you can't walk the same path you don't agree with each other your opinions are different god's opinion and god the devil's opinion is different amen they differ that's little word differ can be a terrible word amen dislike to dislike i wanted to pull it up probably god says it's a terrible thing for one person to dislike another huh to dislike you just don't like it at all huh you're different there's no unity there's no love there it's a dislike he made that statement just a dislike but how sweet it is brothers and sisters put their arms around each other and say brother i love you with all my heart huh we're one how nice that is but there's a problem there's something wrong when there's a dislike discord amen god hates discord god hates somebody that sows discord among brethren or sisters god hates it amen amen opposition opposition to oppose who opposes and exalted himself i believe ii thessalonians that the wicked one would oppose and exalt himself he would oppose you i oppose you got a lot of opposing going out there don't we yeah we oppose well i up here this morning oppose i oppose the devil i'm an opposition to the devil huh i am his opposition i'm against him not for him i'm against everything that's evil you know what it's like to have to stand up here and put you in danger maybe be in danger for opposing no they don't like when you oppose it ain't no telling what they'll do when you oppose many knows you speak against them they might just try to kill you that's sad we ah we're not living in the medieval times anymore i'm gonna call it this recall we're living in the late evil times the late evil times is gonna be a lot worse than the medieval if you don't think so read revelation he says woe unto you epidermis of the earth for the devil has come down to you and he knows that he has but a short time going to get real wicked real bad in the tribulation period every video game every music can i just say what comes to mind i won't go much longer brother brandon said that the people listening to rock and roll music it is preparing them for arm like who said that armageddon that's what he said they're ready getting ready for armageddon tell me what they tell me what the soldiers play some of uh uh sean you might know different ones that have been in the army don't they play rock and roll while they're fixing to go into a war battle rock and roll amen getting them ready for armageddon amen but i don't know about you but i love the sweet music of amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me i once was lost but now i'm fine i was blind but now i see when we've been there i'm getting ready for something myself are you getting ready for something by the music that i listen to about what you put in your heart and your ears and you're getting ready for heaven one of these days soon could be any time jesus is going to come and he's going to catch his people away we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them that city we shall be alive and they shall be caught up in the air to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with god amen just as sure as he took his picture with brother bannon the fbi searched it out the only supernatural light ever taken and it was the pillar of fire god himself god himself you say well well you can be how many knows you can be critical but if that really really is god what do you reckon your attitude's going to mean it's going to mean a lot if that really is god and i believe it is that pillar fire over brother baby the only picture that would even develop amen all the others of that critic wouldn't even come out miracles and signs and wonders to prove that god is real taped library back there 1100 tapes of jesus discerning thoughts and intensive heart miracle after miracle there's no excuse for this generation they're just not america it's just not going to be an excuse for how many knows it's it's one thing for a sinner to just you know he can't really turn his back on god but when a nation that claim god then turns your back on god can you imagine the penalty that it's going to be it's going to be fire folks it's going to be hot amen so i want to close with this thought he put it that way he says look you confess me before me and i'll confess you you're ashamed of me i'll be ashamed of you he puts it in such a way until you have to make a choice how many believes you got to make a choice people don't want to make a choice but you have to make a choice who you're going to serve because jesus said no man can serve two masters he only he'll serve the one and hate the other or love the one ate the other let's stand this evening early afternoon anybody has received the lord and as your savior as your lord and savior you may not have tomorrow we may not have it tomorrow this is your chance this morning step out come to the altar and say god here i am i want to give you my life right now lord i want to serve you i want to die to myself i want to take up my cross and follow you i want to confess me confess you before all these people that i accept you i just want to put that opportunity out if there's anybody that god is tugging on your heart you feel something in your heart that tells you you should give your life to god don't wait do it now with eyes closed heads fouled think about it this is your opportunity this is your invitation from christ to come and accept him it's your choice it's up to you there's two outcomes which one do you want which one do you want you're going to have one outcome or you're going to have the other it's going to be one way or the other it's not going to be the way that we want it to be this way that god has already ordained it to be [Music] how many inhibitions that need to be a greater reflection of christ because that's truly his purpose not our businesses and everything else but his the business of christ is to go into all the world and preach the gospel to tell the world of what christ did for
