[21:11] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[21:13] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[21:27] afraid
[21:31] though an host should encamp against me
[21:33] my heart shall not fear though War
[21:35] should rise against me in this will I be
[21:52] confident for in the time of trouble he
[21:54] shall hide me in his Pavilion and the
[21:56] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[21:58] me he shall set me upon a
[22:16] rock here oh Lord when I cry with my
[22:19] voice have mercy also upon me and answer
[22:26] me

[22:46] Lead Me in a plain path because of mine
[22:56] enemies

[23:03] see the goodness of the Lord in the land
[23:05] of the
[23:05] living wait on the Lord be of good
[23:08] courage and he shall strengthen thine
[23:10] heart wait I say on the Lord Brother
[23:24] TR children can be dismissed for Sunday
[23:26] school and you may be seated
[23:29] [Music]
[23:30] was a really good Psalm that we read
[23:32] this
[23:34] morning I like there in in five some of
[23:37] them always is you know stand out
[23:39] different to you at different times I
[23:40] guess but F stood out to me this morning
[23:43] quite a
[23:45] bit and uh if you've been walking in
[23:47] this Christian way anytime at
[23:50] all it says for in a time no there
[23:54] there'll always come trouble it says but
[23:56] in the time of trouble he shall hide me
[23:58] in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[24:00] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[24:03] me up upon a rock it's really good and
[24:07] we know trouble will
[24:09] come but we know that if we can hide in
[24:11] his Pavilion we'll be just all right if
[24:15] we'll go here let me try to see
[24:19] here all right just a little
[24:22] thought in the day and age that we live
[24:25] and uh the pressure that's on us in this
[24:28] age and just uh the different things the
[24:32] distractions that we have amongst us in
[24:34] our lives I
[24:36] guess uh I'm trying to look here first
[24:38] Peter if you want to go with me to First
[24:41] Peter just a one verse there and I got a
[24:44] couple different little verses marked
[24:46] down here
[24:51] but first Peter 5 and
[24:56] 7
[24:59] I think it is here
[25:02] you casting all your care upon him for
[25:04] he careth for you this is the one I
[25:06] actually wanted to get to here is eight
[25:08] be sober be diligent because your
[25:10] adversary the devil is as a roaring
[25:12] lying lion walketh about seeking whom he
[25:16] may devour and that's the where we're
[25:19] kind of living in today's age uh I was
[25:22] thinking kind of on distractions and the
[25:24] press the pressure of the age that we
[25:26] live in the pressure different stuff
[25:28] that come up in our lives jobs and and
[25:31] uh the different distractions kind of
[25:33] that we have we all have to have a job
[25:35] and things but
[25:38] uh um everybody has different jobs I
[25:41] guess but for our job sometimes at the
[25:44] market Tammy knows and different ones
[25:46] know mom probably especially but just
[25:49] the different bombardment of different
[25:50] things uh of situations that come up and
[25:53] it's not sometimes one thing but it's
[25:55] multiple things at one time and creates
[25:58] such a pressure that sometimes you know
[26:01] you make a decision out of haste and and
[26:04] you may make the wrong decision
[26:06] sometimes sometimes you may make the
[26:07] right decisions but it's just a constant
[26:08] pressure and peppering of different
[26:11] things that might come up in a daily uh
[26:15] daily walk that uh extreme
[26:19] pressure and uh uh let's see here I'll
[26:23] go to the some of the one of the things
[26:28] was uh I have a quotee here it's just
[26:30] about brother Brenham saying about
[26:32] pressure but when we come under pressure
[26:34] then sometimes we can make like I said
[26:36] the wrong decisions are the devil tries
[26:38] to get us under that pressure and this
[26:40] is from letting off the pressure brother
[26:42] Brenham speaking letting not the
[26:44] pressure he said but there is a pressure
[26:46] on the people today and that pressure
[26:48] has no limitation or any denominational
[26:50] lines it has no age line it has no
[26:53] respect to persons it's not it's on The
[26:56] Young and the old good and the bad it's
[26:58] on everybody it's pressure he said we're
[27:01] living in an neotic age a nervous
[27:02] tension everybody is racing here and
[27:05] going there and going nowhere he
[27:07] said to that kind of an age and I know
[27:11] this church would be plagued with it as
[27:13] everywhere is plagued by it Tabernacle
[27:16] is flagged with it everywhere the whole
[27:17] world it's a day of pressure it's hurry
[27:20] hurry hurry hurry up and wait Drive 90
[27:23] miles an hour and then get home to for
[27:25] supper and wait two hours till it gets
[27:26] ready that's right he said it's a time
[27:28] of that rushing and speeding it gets you
[27:30] to a nervous tension the wife says
[27:32] something a little contrary and you want
[27:34] to fly off temper husband say something
[27:36] you want to Pat your foot and tell him
[27:38] to uh correct and get in the room well
[27:40] now husband I don't want no words with
[27:42] you go out there and wife oh I'm so
[27:44] nervous see why what's the matter he
[27:46] says all this together this T building
[27:49] up then the result of it is doing doing
[27:52] something wrong and acting out of place
[27:55] that's right now it'll make the the poor
[27:57] act that way it'll make the middle class
[27:59] act that way it'll make the rich act
[28:01] that way it'll make the wrong act that
[28:03] way it'll make the pretty good act that
[28:05] way and it'll make the good act that way
[28:08] because it's tension it's steam built up
[28:10] got to blow it off somewhere see and
[28:12] don't know the blow uh you blow the
[28:15] boiler up he said we find it builds up
[28:18] as the day goes you talk to your boss if
[28:21] you're working and so on and so on if
[28:23] you speak to the kitty come here and uh
[28:26] the kitties do it said Mama there there
[28:28] you are he said it builds up and he said
[28:31] you feel like you're going to head is
[28:32] going to come off I know I'm with he
[28:36] said every day so I know what it means
[28:38] it builds
[28:39] up and then uh further down in the
[28:42] message he said I thought that it is
[28:44] letting off the steam everybody is just
[28:47] becoming a neurotic age everything is
[28:48] built up haven't got no time and that
[28:50] builds up to a place that it breaks up
[28:53] things and causes people to have hard
[28:55] feelings when they snap off they say
[28:58] things you don't mean to say um he said
[29:01] now everybody is guilty of it I'm guilty
[29:02] of it you're all guilty of it we all we
[29:04] all do things under pressure that we
[29:06] wouldn't do otherwise so there's there's
[29:09] an excessive preure built up today I
[29:12] believe before I go any further I might
[29:13] say this I believe it's the enemy coming
[29:15] down and
[29:16] pressing I believe the devil and we know
[29:19] the coming of the Lord is at hand and
[29:21] the Bible said in the last days that the
[29:23] devil would be going about like a
[29:24] roaring line and if he could get you
[29:26] under pressure hurrying running over
[29:29] something you'll make a decision that
[29:30] you wouldn't make if you'd sit down and
[29:32] think it over and that's totally the day
[29:35] that we live in we should have more time
[29:37] than we ever had because we have more
[29:39] conveniences than we ever had we have
[29:41] supposedly I guess easier uh than we
[29:44] ever had but everybody's under constant
[29:47] pressure and uh and it's a
[29:50] distraction that pressure is a
[29:52] distraction of the devil to try to get
[29:54] you in a situation where you would
[29:55] wouldn't make that decision on a normal
[29:57] day basis or if you kind of thinking it
[30:00] over like brother Brenham said or if
[30:01] you're in your right mind but it being
[30:04] under constant pressure you make it
[30:06] quickly and you might make the wrong
[30:07] decision it's a distraction of the devil
[30:11] and we're living in that day of constant
[30:14] pressure uh one of the thoughts that
[30:17] with being distractions and stuff you
[30:20] know uh preacher a while back said you
[30:23] know he had had uh this and you you've
[30:26] probably been in your car too
[30:28] seeing a bird in the in the road or
[30:29] something to that nature bird or a a
[30:32] squirrel chasing something or a bird
[30:35] looking for for his meal and under when
[30:38] he's distracted and busy focusing on his
[30:41] meal he might not see the car that's
[30:43] approaching and and going to kill him
[30:44] flat so uh that's one one distraction
[30:49] that's the example of distraction
[30:51] there's other distractions you know the
[30:53] devil sets traps for you uh you know
[30:57] with uh they they said back in the old
[30:59] days when they used to hunt or
[31:02] things like that that if they just took
[31:04] a a can and uh cut a little hole on the
[31:07] top put something shiny down in there
[31:10] the would go uh go in there for
[31:12] that something shiny and he'd make a
[31:14] fist and he couldn't get it out and he'd
[31:15] be trapped there so it's just different
[31:17] distractions and stuff i' had seen this
[31:19] little
[31:20] video of a it was a it was an animal
[31:24] video of uh a Viper that was on this
[31:28] this cliff and its tail looked exactly
[31:31] like a a spider it had the scales were
[31:34] over grown on the tail of it and it
[31:36] looked like spider legs and the end of
[31:39] the tail was a blunt end of the tail
[31:41] like a like a belly of a spider and it
[31:44] would sit there and it would run there
[31:46] those scales back and forth and the
[31:48] birds would look at it and it was so
[31:51] camouflaged and such a such a trap for
[31:53] the birds that the bird would come and
[31:55] pick pick try to get that spider
[31:57] and the bird would maybe not get it the
[31:59] first time and fly away and the bird
[32:01] would come back and get it again but we
[32:03] know the end of the story it wasn't the
[32:04] bird that got the spider it was the
[32:06] Viper that got the bird so it's just
[32:09] ways of the devil uh going about like a
[32:12] roaring
[32:13] lion trying to uh to stumble up God's
[32:17] children basically I had a couple more
[32:19] scriptures here let me see uh let's see
[32:23] the second one one of them that I kind
[32:25] of thought pertained to this was
[32:29] Ephesians Ephesians
[32:41] 6 Ephesians 6 and it's in verse I think
[32:46] it starts in verse
[32:48] 10 this is just Paul speaking about
[32:51] putting on the full armor of God finally
[32:53] my brethren be strong in the Lord and
[32:55] the power of His might put on the whole
[32:57] Armor of God that you may be able to
[32:59] stand against the Ws of the devil for he
[33:02] says we wrestle not against flesh and
[33:04] blood but against principalities against
[33:05] Powers against the rulers of the
[33:07] darkness of this world against spiritual
[33:09] wickedness in high
[33:12] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[33:14] armor of God that you may be able to
[33:16] withstand of the evil in the evil day
[33:19] and having done all to stand he says
[33:22] stand therefore having your loins G
[33:24] about you with truth and having on the
[33:25] breastplate of righteousness
[33:27] and your feet Shaw with the preparation
[33:31] of the gospel of peace above all taking
[33:34] the shield of Faith wherewith you shall
[33:37] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[33:39] the wicked take the helmet of salvation
[33:41] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[33:42] word of God praying always with all
[33:45] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[33:47] and watching there into with all
[33:48] perseverance and supplication for All
[33:51] Saints amen uh Philippians if you go
[33:56] with me to
[33:59] Philippians three I believe it
[34:03] is I got these marked off but when when
[34:06] you get up here then then it's a little
[34:08] different than having it all put
[34:10] together in your mind it kind of
[34:12] scatters up but Philippians here let's
[34:23] see Philippians 3 starting in verse 12
[34:27] it's just
[34:30] uh this is Paul
[34:32] speaking of keeping Focus basically not
[34:35] as though I had already attained either
[34:37] were already perfect but I follow after
[34:40] if that I may apprehend that for which
[34:43] also I am apprehended of je of Christ
[34:45] Jesus Brethren I count not myself to
[34:48] have apprehended but this one thing I do
[34:50] forgetting those things which are behind
[34:52] and reaching forth unto those things
[34:53] which are before I press toward the mark
[34:56] of the prize of the High Calling of God
[34:58] in Christ Jesus amen and then if we'll
[35:02] go to
[35:09] Corinthians First Corinthians we'll do
[35:12] uh verse it's uh chapter
[35:17] 15 starting in verse
[35:21] 51 and this is what we're trying to
[35:24] attain to I believe
[35:27] and this is the stage the the stage is
[35:30] being set with all the pressure and all
[35:31] the the the tricks and The Traps of the
[35:35] devil this is what we're attaining to or
[35:38] trying to attain to uh First Corinthians
[35:42] it's
[35:43] uh 15 starting in verse
[35:46] 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall
[35:51] not all sleep but we shall be changed in
[35:54] the moment in twinkling of an eye at the
[35:56] last last Trump for the trumpet shall
[35:58] sound and the dead shall be raised
[35:59] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[36:01] for this Incorruptible must put on
[36:03] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[36:06] immortality we're heading up to to a
[36:09] Rapture and we sure don't want to be
[36:11] distracted and there's many more things
[36:13] that we're distracted by uh some of this
[36:16] it's traps of the devil and it's the
[36:18] pressure of the age we're we're
[36:19] distracted by devices and all these
[36:22] different things that we have uh in our
[36:24] life that's supposed to make our life
[36:26] easy but a lot of times just becomes a
[36:28] distraction for us but if we just stick
[36:31] with God's word and be keeping in his
[36:33] word uh brother
[36:36] Tom thank you
[36:39] brother
[36:41] amen amen I'm just trusting the Lord
[36:44] will speak to our hearts this morning

[37:13] a woman coming into power and amen after
[37:16] that you know he said he's seen in his
[37:18] last V part of that Vision he says as
[37:20] far as his eye could see he didn't say
[37:23] the whole United States but he said as
[37:24] far as his eye could see he's nothing
[37:26] but Boulders and burnt over

[37:32] there's fires coming amen I believe it's
[37:34] time to get ready amen time to be ready
[37:36] to leave this world Amen because God is
[37:39] certainly going to burn this sinful
[37:41] world Amen and those who have rejected
[37:44] his mercy and his grace this morning

[38:13] wrong doing missionary work ain't that
[38:14] right and so we always want to do that

[1:20:26] save a sinner free someone from
[1:20:29] pornography amen glory there's nothing
[1:20:33] that our God can't do I want to read now
[1:20:35] from 2 Corinthians chapter 6 starting at
[1:20:37] verse 10 the Bible says
[1:20:40] this as sorrowful yet always
[1:20:44] rejoicing as poor yet making many rich
[1:20:49] as having nothing yet possessing all
[1:20:54] things amen let's just bow our heads and
[1:20:58] hold your Bibles we'll read a little bit
[1:20:59] from Genesis 22 after we're seated but I
[1:21:02] want to speak to you this morning for
[1:21:03] just a little bit on professing what we
[1:21:06] are
[1:21:08] possessing Heavenly
[1:21:11] Father we love you
[1:21:14] Lord we thank you for all that you've
[1:21:17] done for
[1:21:18] us father I pray this morning that you
[1:21:20] would just take this simple thought Lord
[1:21:23] It's really the only kind I
[1:21:25] know how to preach rise
[1:21:29] within him to receive that which they
[1:21:31] have need of Lord father as they've said
[1:21:34] it's a Troublesome time a a wearisome
[1:21:36] time but yet God it's a rejoicing time
[1:21:38] because we see you said when these
[1:21:40] things begin to come to pass for us to
[1:21:42] lift up our heads our Redemption is draw
[1:21:45] nigh so Lord we pray that you'd move
[1:21:47] Among Us this morning those that are
[1:21:48] sick and Afflicted may be weary those
[1:21:50] unable to be here dear God may your
[1:21:52] spirit just just move upon them may the
[1:21:54] Healer pass by Lord and take every
[1:21:55] symptom every every every pain whatever
[1:21:59] it would be Lord just remove it from
[1:22:00] them that before the service is over
[1:22:02] lord the testimonies will be coming in
[1:22:04] that the Healer passed by Lord we
[1:22:06] wouldn't ask you these things if we
[1:22:08] didn't have faith that you was able to
[1:22:09] do it so we commit this congregation
[1:22:11] ourself into your hands For Your Glory
[1:22:14] in Jesus name and the bride says God
[1:22:17] bless you you may be seated now turn
[1:22:19] with me over to Genesis 22 want to read
[1:22:22] there just for a couple of scriptures
[1:22:24] Genesis
[1:22:28] 22:15 nice pullit brother
[1:22:34] B the Bible says
[1:22:39] this and the angel of the Lord called
[1:22:41] unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second
[1:22:43] time and said by myself have I sworn
[1:22:45] sayith the Lord for because thou H has
[1:22:47] done this thing and has not withheld thy
[1:22:49] son thy only son that in blessing I Will
[1:22:52] Bless thee and multiply and I will
[1:22:54] multiply thy seed as a seed shall
[1:22:57] possess the gates of his
[1:23:00] enemy and in thy seed shall all the
[1:23:03] nations of the earth be blessed why
[1:23:06] because thou Hast obeyed my
[1:23:11] voice amen may the Lord add his Blessing
[1:23:14] to the reading of his word now we
[1:23:17] understand by these scriptures in verse
[1:23:18] 17 and 18 that Abraham is the father of
[1:23:21] the faithful
[1:23:23] and we are heirs to his promise through
[1:23:26] Christ now Abraham was just an ordinary
[1:23:29] man at one time he was actually an idol
[1:23:31] worshipper so what does that tell us
[1:23:33] about God it tells us that we serve a
[1:23:36] God who has transforming power now the
[1:23:39] word transforming it means the ability
[1:23:41] to bring about a dramatic change and we
[1:23:44] serve a god this morning who has the
[1:23:46] ability to bring about a dramatic change
[1:23:50] amen he can transform a drunk into a
[1:23:52] preacher I can say Amen to that he can
[1:23:54] transform a streee hearted into a lady
[1:23:56] he can transform a bit of water and make
[1:23:58] it sweet he can transform a sinate to a
[1:24:01] saint he can transform a world that is
[1:24:03] dark and void and without form and
[1:24:05] transform it into a Garden of Eden by
[1:24:07] the transforming power of the almighty
[1:24:10] God Amen the prophet said that's the
[1:24:12] transforming power of God that he can
[1:24:14] take something that's nothing and make
[1:24:17] something wonderful out of it God's
[1:24:19] transforming power Jesus one day said if
[1:24:22] if these rocks hold their peace if the
[1:24:25] PE if these hold their peace the rocks
[1:24:26] will cry out and you think how can rocks
[1:24:29] cry out all right thank God no vocal
[1:24:32] cords and yet Jesus said if these hold
[1:24:34] their peace the rocks will cry out how
[1:24:37] could he make such a statement like that
[1:24:38] but you've got to
[1:24:40] remember the rocks and when you have the
[1:24:43] power to create you can make your
[1:24:45] creation do hallelujah what you wanted
[1:24:48] to do amen and God by his transforming
[1:24:51] power is going to take his old frail
[1:24:53] bodies of ours one day and it's going to
[1:24:54] transform them into young men and women
[1:24:56] Again by the transforming power of the
[1:24:59] almighty God am and you young people sit
[1:25:01] and say well that ain't fair to us we're
[1:25:03] young what are we ever going to
[1:25:04] experience I'll tell you what you
[1:25:05] experience God's going to take your
[1:25:07] young body and take you from youth to
[1:25:08] Eternal youth by the transforming power
[1:25:11] of the almighty God Amen that's the God
[1:25:14] we serve this morning now we understand
[1:25:17] by the Bible that Abraham wasn't looking
[1:25:20] for God and neither was you but God came
[1:25:24] looking for Abraham and as Abraham SE we
[1:25:27] could say the same thing amen when Adam
[1:25:31] was lost Adam the first son when he was
[1:25:34] lost who come looking for Adam God did
[1:25:37] then who comes looking for every son and
[1:25:40] daughter of
[1:25:41] God God does Amen we never sought God
[1:25:45] but it was always God seeking us out now
[1:25:48] God sought out Abraham because by his
[1:25:49] fance he knew that Abraham would believe
[1:25:52] him when
[1:25:53] he
[1:25:55] spoke so God sought out Abraham because
[1:25:58] he knew that he would believe
[1:26:01] him and God SS you
[1:26:04] out because he knew you would believe
[1:26:06] him when he spoke amen but said God has
[1:26:09] purposed and hid it from The Eyes Of The
[1:26:11] Prudent and wise and revealed it to
[1:26:13] predestinated babes who are
[1:26:15] predestinated to receive it you didn't
[1:26:17] stagger into this message we didn't
[1:26:19] stagger into this message but before the
[1:26:21] foundation Of The World God
[1:26:23] predestinated us for such a time as this
[1:26:26] this moment this time this hour this day
[1:26:29] Hallelujah that we would stand here and
[1:26:31] prove he's the same yesterday today and
[1:26:34] forever oh my then God help us this
[1:26:37] morning to be like Abraham that we never
[1:26:39] doubt God when he speaks to us God said
[1:26:43] because thou has obeyed my voice that I
[1:26:47] myself have sworn because there's none
[1:26:49] greater to swear by for God made a
[1:26:52] promise to Abraham because he could
[1:26:54] swear but none greater he swore by
[1:26:57] himself thy seed shall possess the gates
[1:27:00] of his enemies not maybe not hope so not
[1:27:03] could be but shall now shall in the
[1:27:07] Bible is used to indicate a commandment
[1:27:10] or an
[1:27:11] obligation th seed shall it is a
[1:27:13] commandment amen you know like let there
[1:27:16] be
[1:27:17] light God said let there be light there
[1:27:20] was a commandment come on do we have
[1:27:22] light yes why God said so and that same
[1:27:25] God said that said let there be light
[1:27:27] said thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:27:29] the enemy and that same God said repent
[1:27:31] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:27:33] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:27:35] Holy Ghost for the promise into you and
[1:27:37] to your children even as far off as many
[1:27:39] as the Lord Our God shall call it is a
[1:27:41] commandment amen not could be not hoped
[1:27:43] so if you do this I'll do this says the
[1:27:45] Lord amen hallelujah are you with me
[1:27:48] this morning
[1:27:51] amen said I like this and Abraham was
[1:27:53] air to All by the promise so he could
[1:27:56] lay claim to everything that was in the
[1:27:58] land and the land itself Abraham had be
[1:28:02] given the promise now we understand he
[1:28:03] was the poorest man in all the country
[1:28:06] because he lived out there in the desert
[1:28:07] and lived in peace with God and lot was

[1:34:29] brothers amen anybody ever read the
[1:34:32] autobiography of jono they said it took
[1:34:35] an Apache to catch an Apache and they
[1:34:37] they got the White Mountain the paches
[1:34:40] brought them into the military gave them
[1:34:41] ranks gave them rifles and they tracked
[1:34:43] down jono and his Warriors and they
[1:34:46] brought them in and when they put Jano
[1:34:48] on a train the White Mountain of patches
[1:34:51] they place him under arrest stripped
[1:34:52] them of the rank put them on the same
[1:34:54] train sent them all down to
[1:34:56] Florida while they was on the train one
[1:34:59] of the White Mountain the patches looked
[1:35:01] at up to jono's
[1:35:04] Warriors he said you was right not to
[1:35:06] trust the white eye said everything he
[1:35:09] told us was a
[1:35:10] lie and he said I'll hate you as long as
[1:35:14] there's breath in my body I'll hate you
[1:35:16] so why didn't you leave us
[1:35:18] alone we were serving the Creator the
[1:35:20] way he created us this is our land our
[1:35:23] way of life why didn't you leave us
[1:35:25] alone I'll hate you as long as there's
[1:35:28] breath in my body I'll hate
[1:35:30] you one of
[1:35:32] Dono Warriors just looking at him and
[1:35:35] Dono spoke up and said do not hate him
[1:35:40] there's too few of us left to hate one
[1:35:45] another if you're not little bride it's
[1:35:48] the father's good pleasure to give you
[1:35:49] the
[1:35:50] kingdom amen Abraham heard that his
[1:35:53] brother was in trouble was taking
[1:35:55] captive we might bump around a little
[1:35:57] bit in the backyard but we stand
[1:35:59] shoulder the shoulder in the front
[1:36:01] amen and when he heard he was taking
[1:36:03] captive he went and got him Abraham's
[1:36:05] men they they weren't Farmers they
[1:36:06] weren't
[1:36:07] Warriors
[1:36:09] 318 men 318 Farmers with pitchforks and
[1:36:14] rases went down after these kings that
[1:36:17] held lot and his family now what think
[1:36:19] about that's on almost Insanity that's
[1:36:22] almost suicide why would
[1:36:25] 318
[1:36:26] Farmers being led by Abraham go up
[1:36:30] against a bunch of kings and their
[1:36:32] armies and you know if they Kings
[1:36:33] they've got an army they've got Shields
[1:36:35] and Spears and horses and helmets
[1:36:38] and a well equipped Army what made
[1:36:42] Abraham so sure he can win this battle
[1:36:45] he look
[1:36:47] so he looked like the
[1:36:49] underdog who would have Vegas bed on the
[1:36:52] kings are
[1:36:54] Abraham and why would he go up why would
[1:36:57] he take why would he do that because
[1:37:00] Abra glory to God Abraham had a
[1:37:02] revelation that God had given him the
[1:37:05] land and land and all that was in it Bel
[1:37:07] on to him amen and he acted on his
[1:37:09] belief that what God Said was true he
[1:37:11] acted on the word of
[1:37:13] God hallelujah he went up against those
[1:37:16] kings believing what God said about it
[1:37:19] amen God could tell Abraham he knew he
[1:37:22] was an air to all the land because he
[1:37:23] knew Abraham would believe him amen it's
[1:37:26] time we act on what we say we
[1:37:28] believe well I believe the message the
[1:37:31] devil believes the
[1:37:32] message come on you got it's more than
[1:37:34] that
[1:37:36] somebody how do we know Noah believed
[1:37:38] God's message when he said it's going to
[1:37:39] rain how do we know Noah believed that
[1:37:42] the boat is the
[1:37:44] evidence how will we know that you
[1:37:46] believe the message when you act on what
[1:37:48] the prophet said
[1:37:50] amen
[1:37:51] amen he was a possessor of the Gate of
[1:37:54] his enemies why because God said so he
[1:37:57] wasn't relying on 318 Farmers with
[1:37:59] pitchforks he wasn't trust he wasn't
[1:38:01] trusting in their ability he wasn't
[1:38:03] trusting in their military training they
[1:38:05] didn't have anything but he was trusting
[1:38:07] in The God Who made the promise and I'm
[1:38:09] not here this morning I'm not trusting
[1:38:10] in my ability I'm not but I'm trusting
[1:38:12] in The God Who made the promise to me
[1:38:14] amen he said I'll never leave you he
[1:38:16] said I'd never forsake
[1:38:19] you Abraham when I his nephew he went
[1:38:22] after what belonged to him because he
[1:38:24] was a possessor of all that was in the
[1:38:27] land yeah Abraham had a right to the
[1:38:30] promise and the promise was his yet he
[1:38:32] had to fight to possess it there you are
[1:38:35] the believer today yet we're AES to all
[1:38:37] things we're HS to every spiritual
[1:38:40] blessing every physical blessing every
[1:38:43] blessing the bible promises you have to
[1:38:46] fight for every in of it even though
[1:38:49] it's yours we have to fight like for
[1:38:52] every inch of it then I say this is the
[1:38:55] day we need to declare
[1:38:57] war that's God's way that's the way he's
[1:39:00] got it set up the prop said it's always
[1:39:01] been that way you have to fight to
[1:39:04] possess what you know is your own you
[1:39:07] have to fight to possess it and that's
[1:39:09] what we have to do then if that's what
[1:39:10] they have to do then God give us
[1:39:12] strength to fight to possess what we
[1:39:14] already
[1:39:15] own then let the fight start how if we
[1:39:18] if we've got the fight then let the
[1:39:20] fight start are professing what it is we
[1:39:23] possessing you got to remember the
[1:39:26] ABCs ABC is to accept believe and
[1:39:31] confess before you can ever receive any
[1:39:34] blessing even though it's yours you must
[1:39:36] first accept it yeah that's
[1:39:39] right you see if I said I've got a $100
[1:39:41] bill in my pocket now I don't but if I
[1:39:43] did if I had a $100 bill pocket I said
[1:39:45] whoever wants it come up here and get it
[1:39:47] it's yours I can say that all day if you
[1:39:49] all just set there I'll keep $100 bill
[1:39:52] but if somebody believes me it will get
[1:39:54] up it's yours but first you've got to
[1:39:58] accept
[1:39:59] it believe it and then confess it what
[1:40:03] does it do to confess it the prophet
[1:40:05] said your body will obey your
[1:40:08] confession I wonder sometimes that we
[1:40:10] have such a hard time in life because
[1:40:12] we're always talking negative
[1:40:14] everything's negative Wy Wy me come on
[1:40:17] somebody this is going to happen and
[1:40:18] that's going to happen and I've got the
[1:40:20] worst luck in the world you're just
[1:40:21] speaking the devil's language it's time
[1:40:23] you say what God
[1:40:27] Said Amen Hallelujah let the fight start
[1:40:31] by professing what it is that we possess
[1:40:34] what the word says is
[1:40:36] ours amen
[1:40:39] hallelujah amen Abraham returned from
[1:40:42] the slaughter of the Kings he went he
[1:40:44] slaughtered him and the king of Solomon
[1:40:47] told him he said take the SPs and
[1:40:49] Abraham said I'll not take from Fred the
[1:40:51] sulat he didn't fight the war to make a
[1:40:55] lot of money right and the real true
[1:40:57] battles are not made with selfish
[1:41:00] motives but we're living in such a time
[1:41:03] that selfishness controls
[1:41:06] everything we are living in a selfish
[1:41:09] age brother said it'll come to pass that
[1:41:11] self-love will take the place of the
[1:41:13] true love of God and that's how really
[1:41:16] it's true for us if you don't believe it
[1:41:17] you you can't make this stuff up a woman
[1:41:19] down in Texas married
[1:41:22] herself had a cake had a
[1:41:25] preacher had a bridal party just didn't
[1:41:27] have a groom married herself because she
[1:41:30] said I can find nobody that loves me as
[1:41:32] much as I love
[1:41:37] me in 2013 a word was picked to
[1:41:40] represent the entire world every year I
[1:41:44] think it's Oxford dictionary or
[1:41:45] something picks one word for the west
[1:41:47] and one word for the East that Bo
[1:41:48] describes what the people are thinking
[1:41:50] what's in their lives and I think it was
[1:41:52] 2013 they chose one word to represent
[1:41:55] the entire world you know what it was
[1:42:09] selfie
[1:42:11] selfie amen like the little brother was
[1:42:15] talking there this morning that's why
[1:42:16] they cut around you 90 M hour and then
[1:42:18] turn off in front of you because they
[1:42:19] think they're more important than you
[1:42:21] are well preach I think y believe
[1:42:25] will
[1:42:27] amen but they're not fault for selfish
[1:42:29] motives true battles are not fought for
[1:42:31] selfish motives men fight War for
[1:42:34] principles and when Abraham went to get
[1:42:36] lot he didn't go out there because he
[1:42:38] knew he could whoop the Kings and take
[1:42:39] all that they possessed he went after
[1:42:42] for the principle of saving his brother
[1:42:45] and any Minister that's sent out under
[1:42:46] the inspiration of the king of heaven
[1:42:48] will not go for money neither will he go
[1:42:50] to make big churches or inspired
[1:42:51] denominations he'll go for one principle
[1:42:54] that's to bring back that Fallen brother
[1:42:56] and I say this morning I've come to this
[1:42:58] service with this principle to war
[1:43:00] against the devil not to get a name not
[1:43:02] for popularity I'm not interested in
[1:43:03] that but to get my Fallen brother the
[1:43:06] one that Satan has tied down and say
[1:43:08] loose him Satan and let him
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:12] go you see Satan don't care he don't
[1:43:15] care if you see your prison house he
[1:43:17] don't care if you see your prison door
[1:43:19] matter of fact he wants you to see your
[1:43:20] prison door but what he don't want you
[1:43:23] to see is that that door is
[1:43:26] open he'll tell you there's no way out
[1:43:28] and I'm trying to tell you the doors
[1:43:30] open when Jesus died at Calvary
[1:43:33] every every gate in Hell came open
[1:43:37] amen he said he said he said I could go
[1:43:41] free amen Solomon said there's a Time
[1:43:44] For Peace and there's a time for war
[1:43:47] amen there's nothing wrong with fighting
[1:43:48] if you're fighting for the right
[1:43:49] principle
[1:43:53] well that's a
[1:43:55] quote said I was reading at Tombstone
[1:43:57] the other day the museum saw the picture
[1:43:59] of Dono so many of you think Dono was a
[1:44:02] renegade but to me he was a genuine
[1:44:06] American he was only fighting for that
[1:44:08] which was right that God had given him a
[1:44:11] land and a nation and a place to live
[1:44:15] said I don't blame him I don't blame him
[1:44:18] and those white soldiers come in there
[1:44:19] by force over take over the land killing
[1:44:21] them out like a bunch of flies and that
[1:44:23] was the original picture of gono's
[1:44:24] medical headquarters or his hospital it
[1:44:26] was two or three blankets over a piece
[1:44:28] of
[1:44:29] miske and then
[1:44:32] wounded American Indians fighting for
[1:44:35] the God given rights that J with a baby
[1:44:38] of his own on his ships standing there
[1:44:40] looking about his own Warriors bleeding
[1:44:41] and dying with no penicillum or none of
[1:44:44] them no way to help him genuine
[1:44:47] god-given American then you call him a
[1:44:49] renegade I call him a gentleman fighting
[1:44:53] for something that God had give him a
[1:44:56] land and a nation and a place to live
[1:44:58] we're not Waring for a selfish motive
[1:45:00] but Satan took something that belongs to
[1:45:02] us and I said let's go get it back amen
[1:45:06] it's time for the seat of Abraham to
[1:45:07] rise up and get back declare war on all
[1:45:09] hell and its demons well the devil's
[1:45:11] been after me all week I say it's time
[1:45:13] we go after
[1:45:14] [Applause]
[1:45:16] him you need to tell him This Means War

[1:57:20] what God had told their father Abraham
[1:57:22] that they would possess the Gate of the
[1:57:23] enemy but here's the great thing about
[1:57:25] it you see God never took the fire out
[1:57:27] of the
[1:57:30] furnace he never did I'm sorry I didn't
[1:57:32] know you didn't know that he said how

[1:57:39] times harder than it ever been heated
[1:57:41] and he looked in there and seen it was
[1:57:42] out what do you think he would have done

[1:58:04] Daniel possessed the enemy's Gates the
[1:58:07] Li's mouth they couldn't even open their
[1:58:09] mouth to eat
[1:58:11] him now these lies they ate humans
[1:58:15] before and when they saw that Daniel was
[1:58:18] in that den and no way out it was a
[1:58:20] Happy
[1:58:22] Meal yum gums here he comes where you
[1:58:25] going to
[1:58:26] go now they said a line can roar I don't
[1:58:30] know if you know this or not but a
[1:58:31] lion's roar can be heard five miles
[1:58:34] away wow that's probably from here
[1:58:36] almost to Elon I guess ain't it five
[1:58:39] miles a line's Roar is between
[1:58:44] H4 decimals is a roar of a line the
[1:58:48] human ear is physically damaged at 120
[1:58:52] decimal so a line's Roar is almost loud
[1:58:56] enough to give you hearing
[1:58:58] loss can be heard five miles away and
[1:59:02] when that line saw Daniel with no way to
[1:59:05] go he just gave out one of them good
[1:59:07] Five Mile
[1:59:10] Roars but what happened he didn't
[1:59:13] realized that the man standing there
[1:59:14] possessed the Gate of the enemy that
[1:59:16] when he tried to give a f mile Roar all
[1:59:18] came out was
[1:59:20] meow
[1:59:31] meow he shut the Li's mouth
[1:59:34] amen let me tell you he shut the Devil's
[1:59:37] Mouth
[1:59:40] amen Samson one time had a bunch of
[1:59:43] people had him fenced in and the prophet
[1:59:45] God said those Gates weighed eight tons
[1:59:47] a piece I believe it was
[1:59:49] now the prophet said that Samson was a
[1:59:51] mama's boy a shrimp that's what he
[1:59:56] said now I worked in surgery for years
[1:59:59] and I actually done surgery on people
[2:00:00] who come in who picked up a wheelbarrow
[2:00:03] of bricks working construction and they
[2:00:05] pick up a wheelbarrow of bricks and they
[2:00:06] rip this muscle loose from the bone they
[2:00:09] have to come in and they take a big 1050
[2:00:11] staple open it up take that put back the
[2:00:13] bone Wham hit it put it
[2:00:15] back to the Bone let it heal up just for
[2:00:18] picking up Bricks now here's a mama's
[2:00:21] boy who picked up two gates that weighed
[2:00:23] 8 tons a piece it should have ripped
[2:00:25] every muscle that boy had out of his
[2:00:27] body but it
[2:00:29] didn't and he ripped up those Gates
[2:00:32] packed them I forget how many miles it
[2:00:33] was up on a hill and Sh him down and he
[2:00:37] looked at him said hey you want your
[2:00:39] Gates come up here and get
[2:00:46] them how could he do that How could a
[2:00:49] mama's boy make such a statement how
[2:00:51] could he lift up those Gates like that
[2:00:53] he had a promise from God that thy seed
[2:00:55] shall possess the Gate of his
[2:00:58] enemy and all these fine Warriors in the
[2:01:00] faith they all died but I'm thinking of
[2:01:02] another seed this morning one called
[2:01:04] Jesus Christ The Royal Sea he took all
[2:01:06] the gates of the enemy took the gates of
[2:01:07] sickness he took that that could not
[2:01:09] exist in his presence neither could
[2:01:10] anything else exist in his presence a
[2:01:12] funeral possession could not EX stand in
[2:01:13] his presence what did he do Joshua died
[2:01:15] Moses died all the rest of them died bu
[2:01:17] this Royal seed death could not stand
[2:01:19] where life
[2:01:21] was Hallelujah he raised that woman's
[2:01:24] boy from the dead he gave tyrus's
[2:01:26] daughter back to him he raised Lazarus
[2:01:28] from the dead even his sister said Lord
[2:01:30] he stinks his nose has done Cav in but
[2:01:33] he stood there and said Lazar come
[2:01:36] for
[2:01:39] amen
[2:01:41] Oh Glory to God he broke the seals of
[2:01:44] everything his precious Soul descended
[2:01:46] into hell where I ought to went but on
[2:01:47] that third day s took the gates of the
[2:01:49] city on his back had nothing to do with
[2:01:51] this he took the Gate of Hell the Gate
[2:01:52] of the grave and everything else he
[2:01:54] didn't pack it up on the mountain but he
[2:01:55] destroyed it he possessed the Gate of
[2:01:58] the enemy the atmosphere that was filled
[2:01:59] with Devil's power above that Angels or
[2:02:01] nothing else could come down there could
[2:02:03] be no intercession because the blood of
[2:02:04] goats would not would not take away sin
[2:02:06] but his own blood took away our sins and
[2:02:08] he ascended up on high leg captivity
[2:02:10] captive gave gifts and the men now
[2:02:12] everyone of Abraham's seed is there
[2:02:15] anybody here like that everyone of
[2:02:16] Abraham's seed

[2:08:06] him with just enough crops you know what
[2:08:08] he was doing he was feeding his enemy
[2:08:10] and I'm convinced many times with our
[2:08:12] negative talk and our negative attitude
[2:08:13] and the way we live we don't pray like
[2:08:15] we should don't read like we
[2:08:17] should just come to church and wonder
[2:08:19] how long it's going to

[2:08:27] there's more than
[2:08:28] that amen just leave him enough he's
[2:08:31] feeding his enemy just enough to feed
[2:08:33] his many and I'm convinced that many
[2:08:35] times with our negative talking there
[2:08:37] all we're doing is feeding our
[2:08:39] enemy and one
[2:08:41] day it's the Harvest Time here they come
[2:08:45] just like they come every
[2:08:47] time
[2:08:49] here they come but this time what they
[2:08:52] failed to realize there's another seed
[2:08:54] had come to
[2:08:55] maturity there's another seed it's time
[2:08:58] you realize who you are you see Amnesia
[2:09:00] if you don't know who you are Amnesia
[2:09:02] feeds fear anybody that's worked in the
[2:09:04] nurs home with Alzheimer's patients you
[2:09:06] know they're scared sometimes they're
[2:09:07] very violent you know why because they
[2:09:09] don't know nothing they don't know who
[2:09:10] they don't know who they are and
[2:09:11] everything so they fight it's like a
[2:09:12] self-defense mechanism and then finally
[2:09:14] the Alzheimer kicks into the point that
[2:09:16] they even forget how to fear some times
[2:09:18] they just become cuddly babies you know
[2:09:20] is that my telling
[2:09:21] brother you see how long as you don't

[2:09:32] he knew who he was in the word and when
