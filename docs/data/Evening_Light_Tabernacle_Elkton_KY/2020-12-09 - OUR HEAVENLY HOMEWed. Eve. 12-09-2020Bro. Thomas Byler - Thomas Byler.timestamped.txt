[17:49] uh just thankful for that and we always
[17:52] have something to be thankful for so

[46:26] 14.
[46:32] chapter 14 verse 1 let not
[46:35] your heart be troubled you believe in
[46:38] god believe also
[46:39] in me in my father's house are many
[46:42] mansions and if it were not so
[46:45] i would have told you and i go to
[46:47] prepare
[46:48] a place for you if i go to prepare a
[46:50] place for you
[46:51] i will come again and receive you unto
[46:53] myself
[46:55] that where i am there you may be also
[46:58] may god add his blessings to the reading
[47:00] of the word you can be seated
[47:04] i just uh gonna preach just the way that
[47:06] this
[47:07] spirit leads me here but i want to
[47:13] read another scripture out of
[47:15] revelations 21 and verse
[47:17] 3. i think that goes along with this
[47:20] real well
[47:21] that where i am there you may be also
[47:26] amen amen how many likes that
[47:31] that where i am there you may be also
[47:34] we see the fulfilling of this over in
[47:36] revelations 21
[47:38] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[47:39] saying behold
[47:41] the tabernacle of god is with men
[47:45] and he will dwell with them and they
[47:47] shall be his people
[47:49] and god himself shall be with them
[47:52] and be their god amen so how many
[47:55] believes the day is coming when we will
[47:57] be
[47:58] with the lord jesus christ we will be
[48:01] with god amen now we already
[48:05] are with him i mean at least we're ready
[48:07] with him
[48:08] jesus says i'm not going to leave you
[48:10] comfortless amen
[48:12] i'll be with you amen even in you
[48:16] unto the end of the world so the spirit
[48:18] of god is with us now
[48:20] amen but i want to start first of all by
[48:23] saying that
[48:24] i mean i've preached this direction
[48:26] before and
[48:27] i've had a brother say well brother you
[48:29] you know you preached
[48:30] like a funeral service amen and i'm like
[48:33] uh
[48:34] you know uh well it kind of is in that
[48:38] direction because of most of the things
[48:39] that we are going to read tonight
[48:41] most of the time i use at a funeral
[48:45] service
[48:46] yeah but you know jesus neither jesus
[48:49] nor paul that i know of or even john the
[48:52] revelator as far as i know
[48:54] was preaching at a funeral when they
[48:55] said these things amen
[48:58] but they had a perspective they had uh
[49:00] they had
[49:01] uh something that they wanted to get
[49:03] across to the people amen
[49:05] and jesus here in the 14th chapter and i
[49:08] don't know just how many chapters there
[49:10] is
[49:11] not all that many 20 21 towers coming
[49:14] definitely coming down towards the end
[49:15] of
[49:16] jesus life you see very little red
[49:18] writing
[49:20] after this you know he's kind of getting
[49:22] ready to leave
[49:23] amen because he was wouldn't be too long
[49:26] before he leaves this world
[49:29] and he was telling his disciples not to
[49:31] let their heart be troubled
[49:34] amen because he was going to prepare a
[49:36] place for him now
[49:38] the one scripture i believe the prophet
[49:40] of god corrected
[49:42] and he talked about the english language
[49:44] and how that in this scripture
[49:46] it didn't really it didn't say it
[49:49] correctly amen
[49:52] he talks about how that in my father's
[49:54] house
[49:55] are many mansions amen and i believe he
[49:59] interpreted if i remember right he says
[50:02] the correct interpretation is in my
[50:04] father's kingdom are many palaces
[50:08] i'm going to remember that that right in
[50:11] my king my father's kingdom are many
[50:13] palaces amen so he's gone to prepare a
[50:17] place and he was telling his disciples
[50:19] that their hearts shouldn't be troubled
[50:21] now how many knows that after jesus left
[50:24] their hearts were truly troubled every
[50:27] one of them was
[50:28] very very troubled i mean
[50:31] and no doubt but jesus knew that this
[50:33] all was coming and so
[50:35] he gave him words of comfort no doubt
[50:38] amen
[50:39] they remembered these scriptures many
[50:41] times but jesus was trying to tell them
[50:43] and
[50:43] give them a perspective and let them
[50:45] know that
[50:46] their heart really doesn't have to be
[50:49] troubled because
[50:50] i'm going to go prepare a place for you
[50:52] and if i go prepare a place for you i'm
[50:54] going to come back and i'm going to
[50:56] receive you unto myself
[50:58] amen how many knows the the fulfilling
[51:01] of that
[51:02] is going to be over in second
[51:04] thessalonians the fourth chapter around
[51:06] the
[51:06] 18th 13th 14th verse maybe somewhere
[51:09] where the lord shall descend with a
[51:10] shout amen that in christ shall rise
[51:13] we which are alive and remain shall be
[51:15] caught up together to meet the lord in
[51:17] the air
[51:18] so how many knows that he that is a
[51:20] fulfilling that he's going to come back
[51:22] they of course didn't know it was going
[51:23] to be 2 000 years later
[51:26] amen i want to talk to you about three
[51:28] houses amen three houses say man three
[51:31] three places that god has given three
[51:33] homes basically
[51:35] three homes that god gives us to live in
[51:38] amen and this is actually uh when you
[51:41] would tell
[51:42] some of this stuff to a denominational
[51:44] person perhaps
[51:45] you know i don't know that they really
[51:47] would believe it amen or
[51:49] see it the way that we see it amen
[51:52] and because we're talking about changing
[51:54] bodies
[51:55] how many believes that we're the kind of
[51:57] people that have a promise of changing
[51:59] bodies
[52:01] amen and so we have different places
[52:04] that we live and so we get so
[52:07] so at home here amen and we don't
[52:10] realize that this is actually just a
[52:11] house that we're living in amen
[52:13] the real man's on the inside amen
[52:16] and i can tell you i remember one thing
[52:18] that brother john steeman said as he got
[52:20] older he was probably not as old as i
[52:22] was
[52:23] when he told me amen back in the day he
[52:25] says you know i may feel old but
[52:27] i still think like a young man i still
[52:29] you know i
[52:30] you know it's just still you feel like
[52:32] the inside is hasn't changed a bit
[52:36] huh amen brother jeff back there not in
[52:39] his head yeah and
[52:40] all of us that are getting older we our
[52:42] bodies might fail our mind
[52:44] skin might wrinkle and we might get
[52:45] older but this inside man you know
[52:47] that's a spirit man
[52:50] it doesn't get old amen it stays the
[52:52] same
[52:53] and that right and so the outward man
[52:56] perish but the inside band stays the
[52:58] same
[52:59] and so i thought that's about right you
[53:00] know because it's just the outside that
[53:02] perishes and one day
[53:04] we're going to take this house and of
[53:05] course we know that this house gets set
[53:07] aside and
[53:08] amen when you tell people that you're
[53:10] going to change bodies one of these days
[53:12] well
[53:12] that's more than a lot of people can
[53:14] comprehend i know where i was come from
[53:16] and where i was born at people
[53:18] and and i'll be honest with you most
[53:19] people probably just don't know where
[53:21] they're going to end up at
[53:23] and tonight's service has to do with
[53:25] course it has to do with where we're
[53:27] going
[53:28] you know right and and that's a great
[53:30] thing to know where you're going amen
[53:32] where
[53:32] we not only do we know where we're going
[53:35] but you and i
[53:36] have been made more clear about where we
[53:39] come from than any other age any other
[53:41] time
[53:42] because it towards the end of brother
[53:44] ministry he got into talking about
[53:46] how that if you're not a seed gene of
[53:49] god i mean
[53:50] you have to be a seed gene of god
[53:54] you have to be there way back when just
[53:57] like you were
[53:58] in your great great great great friend
[53:59] father you each and every one of us
[54:01] were seeing your great great great
[54:03] grandfather you were in him
[54:04] and you come on down come on down come
[54:06] on down and that's the same way it is
[54:08] with god
[54:09] it has to do with your genetics
[54:12] amen of course talking about where we
[54:15] come from
[54:16] but i want to i want to just take a
[54:17] little bit of time let's talk about our
[54:19] first home first
[54:20] amen then we will talk about our second
[54:22] home which is going to be our theophany
[54:24] all right
[54:25] that's our second home is our theophany
[54:28] and i may just
[54:29] go ahead and read a paragraph out of a
[54:32] quote of brother bannon
[54:33] that i'll probably end up reading the
[54:34] whole thing here in a little bit but he
[54:36] says now we've got to have
[54:38] everything in threes to make perfection
[54:40] this is god's only provided place of
[54:42] worship
[54:43] 1965. all right so it was right down
[54:45] towards the end of
[54:46] his ministry he says now see now there's
[54:49] one body here right here where we're at
[54:52] this is the body that we have
[54:53] then that body there okay which is the
[54:56] celestial body
[54:57] okay and then the glorified body all
[55:00] right
[55:00] in the resurrection so those are the
[55:03] three
[55:03] places that he says three bodies that we
[55:06] have see
[55:06] and that makes it complete so and it's
[55:09] not a myth
[55:10] it's not just an idea it's not just the
[55:13] spirit
[55:14] amen it is he says it is a man and a
[55:17] woman
[55:18] like you are just exactly amen so we
[55:21] realize that we've got two
[55:22] we got three different homes we're
[55:24] looking for that right
[55:26] amen at home that is bright and fair
[55:30] and you know sometimes you just i'll
[55:31] tell you i truly believe that
[55:33] you know as a christian you know that
[55:35] there's another place over there but now
[55:37] let me
[55:37] let me just come back let's talk about
[55:39] our first home because that's a house
[55:41] that you're living in right now
[55:42] you're comfortable with it perhaps uh
[55:45] you know it's just
[55:46] you know if people it's all about people
[55:49] live all about the house that they got
[55:50] right here they don't realize
[55:52] amen that one of these days that this
[55:54] house is going to pass away
[55:57] you're not always going to be here folks
[55:58] and people that don't
[56:00] look at that if you don't uh get it in
[56:02] perspective and really begin to think
[56:04] about that and many times
[56:06] brother branham would get try to get
[56:07] people to realize hey you are not always
[56:10] going to stay here
[56:12] this is not your eternal home
[56:15] this is not your permanent dwelling amen
[56:18] this is only a temporary place
[56:21] all right first first hole that we come
[56:22] with come come to
[56:24] we realized brother bam talk about how
[56:26] that when a mama
[56:27] is pregnant with a child and she's
[56:29] fixing to have a child
[56:30] and that fixing that baby's fixing to be
[56:32] born and then that
[56:34] mama might cause and chew and spit and
[56:35] everything else you know but you know
[56:37] he said if that mama even is every ever
[56:40] as mean as she might be
[56:42] amen whenever it gets close to having
[56:44] but that mama will turn
[56:46] sweet and kind and gentle is that right
[56:50] you know what he said why because
[56:52] there's another spirit amen that is
[56:53] waiting there there's a spirit that's
[56:55] waiting there
[56:56] amen to come into that body
[57:00] amen now one place and i'm not here to
[57:02] say that it's your soul because i don't
[57:04] really have the scripture
[57:05] or don't know the scripture well enough
[57:07] to back that up but amen it would seem
[57:09] right
[57:10] because when he god breathed the breath
[57:12] of life into adam he became what a
[57:14] living soul
[57:15] right so but there's a spirit that comes
[57:17] into that body and that spirit that's
[57:20] you all right coming into that body
[57:22] because brother baby says you have never
[57:24] seen me i've never seen you
[57:25] the real you is on the inside
[57:28] all right so that that spirit comes in
[57:30] there after that baby's born if it
[57:32] doesn't take that breath of life
[57:33] of course it's still born and it's dead
[57:37] it has to receive that spirit amen but
[57:40] there's a kindness and there's a
[57:42] sweetness that comes about
[57:43] and i truly believe that's the way that
[57:45] brahm said about a believer
[57:47] also when you are fixing to pass out of
[57:50] this world
[57:51] amen in going to your next home i mean
[57:54] please when you go
[57:55] to your next home people on their
[57:57] deathbed or coming close to that have a
[57:59] tendency to get really sweet
[58:01] really kind huh if you made any mistakes
[58:05] if you've done anything wrong you don't
[58:07] mind humbling yourself
[58:08] say forgive me brother forgive amen
[58:10] you're not going to sit there and say
[58:11] well you know yeah
[58:12] i you know you know forgive me but you
[58:14] did me wrong no no
[58:15] you don't branch in any of that you just
[58:18] want to make sure you're right with god
[58:19] you get sweet and kind
[58:21] humble huh how many i know that's the
[58:24] way we need to live all the time
[58:26] not just when we die or come down to the
[58:28] door of death but you know because
[58:30] you're fixing to change homes again
[58:32] so we come into this this world that
[58:34] we're living in and now we contact
[58:36] this world by what see taste feel hear
[58:38] and smell
[58:39] amen conscience and memory imaginations
[58:41] 10 senses basically
[58:43] that we have to contact this world amen
[58:45] and i'll tell you what i don't know
[58:46] about you brother david but
[58:48] amen when i you know sometimes have to
[58:50] wear glasses and i said
[58:51] lord thank you for being able to see how
[58:54] many glad to be able to see
[58:56] not to walk around but it'd be a
[58:57] terrible place if you couldn't contact
[59:00] this world
[59:01] and then because you have our everything
[59:03] would be dark you might hear people's
[59:04] voices you might be able to touch people
[59:06] you can hear people
[59:07] but if you can't see this world it would
[59:09] really be a drastically different world
[59:11] for you to live in so we're glad for
[59:13] every sense that god gives us
[59:15] amen to contact he give you feelings so
[59:17] that you can feel for people
[59:19] and then he gave you a conscience so you
[59:21] could keep it straight amen you
[59:23] can have a few conscience and have it
[59:24] right because some people's conscience
[59:26] will condemn them so bad they'll blow
[59:28] their brains out because they're so
[59:29] miserable
[59:31] and also god all of those things have to
[59:33] be in line god give that so that we can
[59:35] contact this
[59:35] now how many knows that even in this
[59:38] natural life here
[59:39] that we talk about and we talk about
[59:42] uh maybe uh going into another body and
[59:45] to another
[59:46] into another vessel we know that
[59:47] actually you actually change vessels
[59:50] amen but when you think about even this
[59:53] natural man that we have here
[59:55] amen your your soul who you are
[59:58] amen how many knows that even that man
[1:00:00] has to become regenerated
[1:00:03] that person has to become born again
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:06] to enter into the kingdom of god and to
[1:00:09] receive eternal life
[1:00:11] amen so here we are the first birth amen
[1:00:14] if you go out of this world without that
[1:00:16] we know that there's no other body
[1:00:18] waiting for you over there
[1:00:20] amen there's no place for you to go to
[1:00:22] man because you don't have what
[1:00:24] that second home ready but if you are a
[1:00:26] child of god
[1:00:27] if you're a son or a daughter of god
[1:00:29] there is a theophany waiting for you
[1:00:31] amen praise the lord and in that you
[1:00:35] find out that
[1:00:36] there's something on the inside of you
[1:00:37] now brother bam says whenever you're
[1:00:39] born again
[1:00:40] that right he says there's a little
[1:00:42] birth that takes place
[1:00:44] that inside man and it grows and it
[1:00:46] grows and he typed it with what
[1:00:48] a pregnant woman is that right grows to
[1:00:52] nine months comes to full maturity
[1:00:54] and it comes time to be delivered amen
[1:00:58] and as you grow and as you grow and as
[1:01:00] you grow i believe god has you in a
[1:01:01] place
[1:01:02] that you're ready to go home you're
[1:01:04] ready for your new house
[1:01:06] isn't that right you know and sometimes
[1:01:09] we wonder why god takes people
[1:01:11] huh you know and a lot of times we'll
[1:01:14] say well they were ready to graduate
[1:01:17] i was ready to take them home they were
[1:01:19] ready to go
[1:01:20] amen uh we even have heard stories of
[1:01:24] of people that almost drown and come
[1:01:26] back and find out later that hey
[1:01:28] you know they weren't ready they weren't
[1:01:29] quite ready so they were given another
[1:01:31] time it was their time
[1:01:32] but they weren't ready so to come back
[1:01:34] and get ready and go that's the god's
[1:01:36] grace
[1:01:37] don't we all pray that god will do that
[1:01:39] for us that if we're not ready lord
[1:01:40] don't let me go
[1:01:42] i want to be ready to go when i go
[1:01:45] and the thing of it is you know we how
[1:01:47] many knows human beings we human beings
[1:01:49] and anybody that isn't born again
[1:01:51] they completely live by these eyes and
[1:01:53] by by the sense by their senses
[1:01:56] and you know basically for what they see
[1:01:59] lust of the eye loves their flesh and
[1:02:00] lusted and the pride of life does those
[1:02:02] three
[1:02:03] major sins and that's this major thing
[1:02:05] that people live for
[1:02:06] never realize you know that there's
[1:02:09] another world
[1:02:10] that is so much better than this one
[1:02:13] amen now
[1:02:17] let's talk about uh as we go through
[1:02:19] here we think about
[1:02:20] when you're born again he says you know
[1:02:22] and you grow
[1:02:23] and you get ready for that next house
[1:02:26] amen and people
[1:02:28] uh people don't really
[1:02:31] keep their eyes on that next house the
[1:02:33] way that they should
[1:02:35] all right our new home
[1:02:39] but jesus did how many knows jesus was
[1:02:41] telling disciples look
[1:02:43] you know i go don't let your heart be
[1:02:45] troubled you believe in god believe also
[1:02:47] in me and i'm gonna go and i'm gonna
[1:02:49] prepare a place for you
[1:02:50] in other words i'm going somewhere else
[1:02:52] and i'm getting a place ready
[1:02:54] for you so get your eyes on that and
[1:02:56] every christian that
[1:02:57] was ever born every every uh abraham
[1:03:00] every
[1:03:00] paul anybody that was ever a christian
[1:03:02] their eyes were
[1:03:04] on that new place
[1:03:07] their new home their heavenly home amen
[1:03:10] and i'll tell you this right now i
[1:03:12] believe it's more relevant than any
[1:03:14] other time because
[1:03:15] not only was this coming towards the end
[1:03:16] of jesus life paul he began to speak
[1:03:19] about it
[1:03:19] brother branham talked about it and here
[1:03:21] we are at the end of the world
[1:03:25] and i believe it's time any time for us
[1:03:27] to leave this place
[1:03:28] i believe it's time to go real soon
[1:03:32] let's look at so jesus here was getting
[1:03:34] them
[1:03:35] to to look at it in the right
[1:03:37] perspective
[1:03:39] let's um turn if you will to saint john
[1:03:42] now
[1:03:44] st john
[1:03:53] the third chapter
[1:04:00] saint john 3 it says i'm sorry my bad
[1:04:03] first john not saint john first john
[1:04:20] and it talks about how that today is
[1:04:22] going to come that we are going to be
[1:04:24] and have the same body like jesus has
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:30] first john 3 verse 1 behold what manner
[1:04:32] of love the father has bestowed upon us
[1:04:34] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:04:37] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:04:39] because it knew
[1:04:40] him not beloved now are we the sons of
[1:04:43] god
[1:04:44] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:04:47] be
[1:04:48] let me ask how many knows we don't know
[1:04:50] exactly what it's going to be like
[1:04:54] but we know that when he shall appear
[1:04:57] we are going to be like him another
[1:04:59] place bible talks that we're going to
[1:05:00] have a body
[1:05:02] like unto his own glorious body
[1:05:05] am i right we're going to see him we're
[1:05:08] going
[1:05:09] listen we know that when he shall appear
[1:05:11] we shall be like him
[1:05:13] for we shall see him as he is
[1:05:17] all right and every man that hath this
[1:05:21] hope
[1:05:21] in him purifieth himself even as he
[1:05:25] is pure now what are we looking at we're
[1:05:29] looking at
[1:05:30] somebody that is what we call
[1:05:35] uh like the song says
[1:05:40] some folks are building hopes down here
[1:05:42] planning ahead so busy with their
[1:05:44] fortune
[1:05:45] they forgot what jesus said he said but
[1:05:48] listen he says but there's a group of
[1:05:50] people but here's a group of people
[1:05:52] doing what
[1:05:54] getting ready to leave there's people
[1:05:57] that you have to coax
[1:05:58] you have to push you have to scare to
[1:06:01] death almost
[1:06:02] to try to get ready to leave this place
[1:06:05] but john says if this is the hope that
[1:06:07] you have
[1:06:08] he says every man that has this hope
[1:06:11] of seeing him and being just like him
[1:06:15] it says that he purified himself
[1:06:19] you ain't it's just like that dove with
[1:06:21] the oil on the inside
[1:06:22] hey man you ain't got to coax and push
[1:06:24] people amen that i have got the gold if
[1:06:27] you've got your eyes
[1:06:28] amen on christ if you've got it on the
[1:06:30] rapture if you got it on
[1:06:31] the coming of the lord you're going to
[1:06:34] put everything
[1:06:35] in perspective yourself you'll have your
[1:06:38] priorities the way that they're supposed
[1:06:40] to be
[1:06:41] otherwise you're going to have to be
[1:06:44] pushed and shoved
[1:06:45] and let me say this the second that
[1:06:47] people get their eyes off
[1:06:49] of this goal they let all kinds of
[1:06:52] things come in
[1:06:54] huh they get lukewarm they get reckless
[1:06:58] they get
[1:06:59] you know just all kinds of many times
[1:07:03] sin will come in because why
[1:07:07] they haven't got their focus the way it
[1:07:08] is supposed to be
[1:07:12] amen it's a desire how many knows it's a
[1:07:14] desire
[1:07:15] that you have i don't know about you but
[1:07:17] i hope that's what you have tonight is a
[1:07:19] desire
[1:07:20] to see the lord turn to another one in
[1:07:22] hebrews well if you will with me
[1:07:24] let's look at abraham for a minute i'll
[1:07:27] talk about seeking
[1:07:30] and desiring seeking and desiring
[1:07:34] a better country amen
[1:07:38] abraham chapter 11 of hebrews verse 8 by
[1:07:42] faith
[1:07:42] abraham when he was called out to go
[1:07:44] into a place where he should after he
[1:07:46] after received for an inheritance he
[1:07:49] obeyed
[1:07:50] and he went out not knowing whether he
[1:07:53] went
[1:07:54] he didn't know just where he was going
[1:07:55] to go by faith he so adjourned
[1:07:58] in a strange land of promise
[1:08:01] as in a strange country dwelling in
[1:08:04] tabernacles with isaac and jacob
[1:08:07] the heirs with him of the same promise
[1:08:10] now he knows that abraham was at a home
[1:08:13] where he lived but when i called him to
[1:08:15] go out
[1:08:16] into another strain it was a strange
[1:08:18] country to him
[1:08:19] he didn't know just where to go god had
[1:08:21] to tell him where to go
[1:08:23] it was a strange place he went through
[1:08:26] some strange places
[1:08:28] are you with me this morning this is
[1:08:31] this is some strange this is a strange
[1:08:33] world
[1:08:35] we're living in some strange times with
[1:08:38] strange things everything is strange
[1:08:41] huh you go around and everybody's all
[1:08:44] tattooed up you're like
[1:08:45] that is so strange they got earrings and
[1:08:49] nose rings like they look almost like
[1:08:50] them africans do out there that don't
[1:08:52] know anything about god
[1:08:54] yeah boy i'll tell you what couldn't the
[1:08:57] prophet have been more
[1:08:59] right about saying when it's become so
[1:09:01] civilized
[1:09:02] and so modern he says the pinnacle
[1:09:05] swings backwards
[1:09:06] people go right back into hedonism they
[1:09:09] become complete evens
[1:09:11] that's exactly what it's done that's
[1:09:13] exactly where people are at
[1:09:14] becoming complete heathen
[1:09:18] not even believing in god in a very
[1:09:20] country
[1:09:21] that has in god we trust on every penny
[1:09:24] and diamond
[1:09:25] dollar that we got we get we got the
[1:09:27] most biggest bunch of heathens in the
[1:09:29] world
[1:09:30] but it swings back but it's a strange
[1:09:32] place
[1:09:33] that's for deca i mean that's how it was
[1:09:35] for
[1:09:36] abraham now notice he says the heirs
[1:09:39] with him of the same
[1:09:41] promise for he looked for a city
[1:09:44] which has foundations whose builder and
[1:09:47] maker
[1:09:48] is god i mean that was abraham he was
[1:09:52] looking for a city
[1:09:55] amen that how many of that cities found
[1:09:58] in the same chapter i read a while ago
[1:09:59] revelations
[1:10:00] uh 21 and i saw the holy city coming
[1:10:04] down out of heaven
[1:10:05] as a bride adorned for her husband
[1:10:08] you know right he's looking for what
[1:10:10] kind of city
[1:10:12] abraham what did he have he had a desire
[1:10:16] for an eternal city
[1:10:20] every christian that's born in the
[1:10:22] spirit i believe desires that one thing
[1:10:24] and that is to have something
[1:10:28] that's eternal because we're living in a
[1:10:31] world where
[1:10:32] nothing is eternal seems like
[1:10:35] holy spirit is but everything around us
[1:10:37] all changes all
[1:10:39] passes away
[1:10:42] amen
[1:10:47] amen when you look at it
[1:10:50] just like the bicycle at the end if if
[1:10:52] you keep looking at the way you're
[1:10:54] supposed to
[1:10:54] that right everything in your life will
[1:10:57] stay in perspective
[1:10:58] but if you don't it'll get out of
[1:11:00] perspective
[1:11:02] amen so he looked
[1:11:06] he says for a city whose builder and
[1:11:07] maker was god
[1:11:09] and then we'll go down to verse 13.
[1:11:12] these all
[1:11:13] died in faith not having received the
[1:11:16] promises
[1:11:18] but having seen them afar off
[1:11:22] and were persuaded of them i believe
[1:11:25] that's important
[1:11:27] how many please when you're looking for
[1:11:28] a city who's builder and makers god when
[1:11:30] you're looking for an eternal
[1:11:32] home or can we say a body that is
[1:11:35] eternal
[1:11:36] an eternal body an eternal home
[1:11:40] you have to be persuaded of it he is
[1:11:43] persuaded
[1:11:46] and embraced them and confessed
[1:11:50] that they were strangers and pilgrims
[1:11:54] on the earth how maybe that's what you
[1:11:56] and i are we're pilgrims
[1:11:58] and we're strangers here this place is
[1:12:00] getting weirder
[1:12:02] all the time strangers
[1:12:05] all the time i'm just passing through
[1:12:08] this place folks
[1:12:10] amen we're looking for a
[1:12:13] different kind of place let me just put
[1:12:16] this in
[1:12:17] when you get born again brother bam
[1:12:20] talks in the future home he says you
[1:12:22] know that this world
[1:12:24] is going to pass away peter saw it
[1:12:27] the heavens and the earth passed away
[1:12:29] with a great noise
[1:12:31] he said that he used to think perhaps
[1:12:33] that that means annihilated
[1:12:35] but that passed away don't mean
[1:12:36] annihilated it means changing from one
[1:12:39] form to another
[1:12:40] is that right and
[1:12:44] the same way with when somebody talks
[1:12:46] about well my
[1:12:47] my loved one passed away let's hope
[1:12:49] that's all they did
[1:12:51] right because they just changed from one
[1:12:53] form to another
[1:12:55] amen you go from one to another amen
[1:12:58] just like going from a physical body to
[1:13:01] a spiritual body
[1:13:03] amen and the world is going to do the
[1:13:05] same thing it's going to pass
[1:13:06] from one form to another it's going to
[1:13:09] change
[1:13:10] but now when we're born again how many
[1:13:11] knows that before christ can come and
[1:13:14] make his abode here
[1:13:15] amen god has to come down he's got to
[1:13:17] burn do some burning
[1:13:20] he's got to burn all the old stuff out
[1:13:23] and you brother ben says not only this
[1:13:25] this this old self of you it doesn't
[1:13:27] uh it don't just pass away it's got to
[1:13:29] die you can't just put it aside or
[1:13:31] divorce
[1:13:32] it it has to die your old nature has to
[1:13:34] die
[1:13:36] completely die for that new man to be
[1:13:40] born
[1:13:41] amen just like the world will let me
[1:13:46] just say this
[1:13:47] and i want you to think about the
[1:13:50] atmosphere that you and i were in with
[1:13:52] the first
[1:13:53] birth that we had our first nature that
[1:13:55] we had our first
[1:13:57] uh uh the first person that was
[1:13:59] inhabiting
[1:14:00] this body huh
[1:14:04] because that first person i i want him
[1:14:06] to be completely dead
[1:14:07] all right i want the new man where the
[1:14:10] bible says that we're a new creation
[1:14:12] all things have passed away all things
[1:14:14] have become new
[1:14:16] everything else is gone you're a new
[1:14:17] creature amen a new creation
[1:14:21] he says that's the way it's going to be
[1:14:22] with this world it's only the atmosphere
[1:14:25] around it
[1:14:26] and the sin that's upon the earth that
[1:14:27] will be destroyed
[1:14:30] he says we realize that the heavens
[1:14:32] means the atmospheres above
[1:14:34] what does it do these thistles and
[1:14:37] sickness and death and politics and
[1:14:39] sinful man and sinful woman
[1:14:41] and evil spirits will all be gone away
[1:14:45] and annihilated they'll burn with
[1:14:48] fervent heat the earth is the only thing
[1:14:51] that passes away that's the only thing
[1:14:53] that
[1:14:53] will be made new because we're going to
[1:14:56] live where

[1:15:36] the earth now

[1:15:40] of evil spirits that the world
[1:15:42] is contaminated with how many knows that
[1:15:46] that's where we're living it we're
[1:15:47] living in a complete
[1:15:49] contaminated world
[1:15:53] amen just kind of like this virus
[1:15:57] now it's just to get all around us now
[1:15:59] how many knows it's all around us
[1:16:00] we're even catching it yeah

[1:16:07] us

[1:16:18] bram says this whole place is like a
[1:16:20] pest house
[1:16:21] full of contaminants how many believes
[1:16:24] that when we get them over there
[1:16:25] there's not going to be any
[1:16:26] contamination over there no
[1:16:29] contamination on the other side

[1:16:36] going to god is making a place
[1:16:38] for our new bodies we're going to have a
[1:16:41] body like unto his own
[1:16:43] glorious body amen
[1:16:47] and there will be a world for us to live
[1:16:49] in
[1:16:50] now we're going all right now notice all
[1:16:53] this exists in the heavens
[1:16:54] or the atmospheres oh my
[1:16:58] and the earth which is now this earth
[1:17:01] holds these things
[1:17:03] but it wasn't made for that purpose sin
[1:17:05] caused it to be that way
[1:17:06] see and it was made by god the creator
[1:17:09] and
[1:17:09] all of our bodies that we live in right
[1:17:11] now were put on the earth that god
[1:17:13] created it excuse me
[1:17:16] because we're made out of the dust of
[1:17:18] the earth it was all laid out here when
[1:17:20] god created himself
[1:17:22] you were in here thinking you were in
[1:17:23] him the great eternal was a thought and
[1:17:25] attribute now sin caused all this to
[1:17:27] happen
[1:17:28] and god through this age is gathering up
[1:17:30] his material
[1:17:32] satan is still here that's the reason
[1:17:34] that all these things happen
[1:17:36] he's still here and all of his evil
[1:17:38] forces are still here
[1:17:40] that's why the earth now is so filthy
[1:17:43] that's why it is common the ridiculous
[1:17:46] thing that goes on bloodshed war
[1:17:48] politics sin adultery all kinds of
[1:17:51] filthiness goes on it's because the
[1:17:52] satan is the ruler
[1:17:54] of this earth and this atmosphere you
[1:17:58] say atmosphere that's right
[1:18:00] both the heavens and the earth is now
[1:18:01] contaminated with devils
[1:18:03] that can accuse us before god and but
[1:18:06] jesus is there to intercede for us let
[1:18:08] me stop there and go back here
[1:18:09] as we talk about here this uh as we
[1:18:12] think about
[1:18:13] the atmosphere let's talk about the
[1:18:15] atmosphere
[1:18:16] now christ came into our hearts changed
[1:18:20] us
[1:18:20] now right took out all the old rats and
[1:18:24] killed all the
[1:18:25] germs and the devils and the bad
[1:18:27] attitudes the fussing and the fighting
[1:18:29] and the cussing and the drinking and
[1:18:31] smoke
[1:18:31] all of that's all cleared out
[1:18:35] and where are you living out where is
[1:18:37] the inner man in it where's the
[1:18:39] inner man at on a wednesday night

[1:19:01] no frustration there
[1:19:03] there ain't no darkness there there
[1:19:04] ain't no sad and wozzy wildy who's there

[1:19:43] are holy things that are
[1:19:44] lovely how many knows that brother brown
[1:19:47] said sure we're americans

[1:20:00] different spirit comes from another
[1:20:02] place
[1:20:03] amen and we're looking for something
[1:20:05] else let me let me let me finish this
[1:20:07] quote here i never finished
[1:20:09] uh that paul made in hebrews here
[1:20:15] so he says that we're strangers and
[1:20:17] we're pilgrims on the earth that's right
[1:20:20] now for they that say such things
[1:20:23] plainly declare
[1:20:24] that they seek a
[1:20:30] country
[1:20:32] i don't know about y'all but through all
[1:20:34] of this politics that we have went
[1:20:36] through here in the lately
[1:20:37] this went through my mind
[1:20:41] what could i go to a country that would
[1:20:42] be better
[1:20:45] huh it has i think maybe you know
[1:20:48] brother brown says up way up there in
[1:20:49] canada it's like heaven's gonna be like
[1:20:51] maybe i'll go to canada huh
[1:20:55] maybe i'll go up there until somebody
[1:20:57] mentioned mosquitoes
[1:21:00] i don't want to get half the feet fight
[1:21:02] all the mosquitoes up there
[1:21:04] huh it's not perfect is it but sure
[1:21:08] through all of this you know the bible
[1:21:09] says we're seeking a better country now
[1:21:11] you realize we realize that we can still
[1:21:14] say
[1:21:15] or the world says i guess or or people
[1:21:17] say that this is still the best country
[1:21:19] in the world
[1:21:22] and all that it is it's still the best
[1:21:24] country in the world
[1:21:26] that's why we a lot of us say that look
[1:21:27] if you want social islam go on over
[1:21:29] there to them communist country if you
[1:21:31] want that
[1:21:32] huh but think about it but
[1:21:35] as good as we have it as good as we
[1:21:37] still have should i say
[1:21:39] when you look at all the debauchery
[1:21:42] huh we realize it's not good enough for
[1:21:45] us
[1:21:46] huh we're going to stay here as long as
[1:21:48] we are in this flesh but we're looking
[1:21:51] for a better country
[1:21:53] we're a bunch of people that is looking
[1:21:54] for something better
[1:21:59] that's what it says the bible says they
[1:22:01] declare plainly
[1:22:02] that they seek a country
[1:22:09] verse 16 says but now they desire
[1:22:12] a better country i mean it's desiring
[1:22:16] a better country yeah i'm an american i
[1:22:20] love america
[1:22:21] you know glad for what god's given us
[1:22:23] but i'm desiring a
[1:22:25] better place amen
[1:22:28] a better country that is
[1:22:31] in heavenly a heavenly country
[1:22:36] folks just everybody that claims to be a
[1:22:38] christian get that into perspective
[1:22:40] look at that and make that your goal and
[1:22:42] everything else will fall into place
[1:22:45] everything else be all right if that's
[1:22:47] your goal
[1:22:48] that you're looking for a place that is
[1:22:51] a heavenly country
[1:22:52] or indwelleth righteousness amen
[1:22:58] all right that is in heavenly wherefore
[1:23:01] god is not ashamed to be called
[1:23:05] their god for he hath prepared
[1:23:09] for them a city
[1:23:13] amen how many at least he's gone to
[1:23:15] prepare that city
[1:23:17] it's in the building it's under
[1:23:19] construction right now
[1:23:22] don't ask me how god can intercede for
[1:23:24] all of our sins and take care of the
[1:23:25] whole world
[1:23:26] and still be off over the under building
[1:23:27] a big city but he can
[1:23:29] he's big enough to do all that
[1:23:33] man when i think about god and you know
[1:23:36] i don't even think try to figure him out
[1:23:38] because
[1:23:39] you can't do it amen
[1:23:44] and how deep god really is how much he
[1:23:48] knows what he can do
[1:23:50] all right that's right so he's not
[1:23:52] ashamed to be called their god
[1:23:54] because they're not satisfied there's
[1:23:56] too many people that's satisfied with
[1:23:58] this world
[1:23:59] too many people satisfied their sin too
[1:24:01] much people satisfied where they're at
[1:24:04] but i look for another country i'm
[1:24:05] looking for another place
[1:24:08] amen praise be to god
[1:24:12] all right so now
[1:24:15] what is our next body of course let's
[1:24:17] talk about our second home
[1:24:19] our second home is going to be our
[1:24:20] theophany our theophany body
[1:24:25] now it's
[1:24:28] it's over let's go to corinthians to
[1:24:30] find this
[1:24:32] i think it was the holy spirit that
[1:24:34] showed brother branham this
[1:24:37] paul we want to look at paul preaching
[1:24:40] basically a funeral service talking
[1:24:42] about
[1:24:42] the first man and the second man he
[1:24:45] talked about
[1:24:46] a celestial body in that right
[1:24:50] over in chapter first corinthians
[1:24:53] 15
[1:24:57] and verse 40. we'll begin i want to read
[1:25:00] just that one and then we'll jump over
[1:25:02] to
[1:25:02] verse 47. so first corinthians 15
[1:25:05] 40. there are also celestial bodies
[1:25:10] amen we believe that that theophany is
[1:25:13] the celestial body
[1:25:14] amen and body's terrestrial but the
[1:25:17] glory of the celestial is one
[1:25:19] and the glory of the terrestrial is
[1:25:21] another verse 47 paul says it this way
[1:25:24] trying to explain
[1:25:25] where we're going what's going to happen
[1:25:27] the first man is of the earth
[1:25:29] earthly but the second man is of the
[1:25:32] lord
[1:25:33] from heaven how many believes that
[1:25:36] and as is the earthly such are they also
[1:25:40] that are earthly and as is the heavenly
[1:25:43] such are they also that are heavenly
[1:25:46] amen
[1:25:47] as jesus this body is so our body will
[1:25:49] be
[1:25:50] and as we have borne the image of the
[1:25:52] earthly so shall we
[1:25:54] also bear the image of the heavenly now
[1:25:56] i say brethren that flesh and blood
[1:25:58] cannot
[1:25:58] inherit the kingdom effect of god
[1:26:02] neither does corruption inherit
[1:26:04] incorruption
[1:26:05] praise the lord behold i show you a
[1:26:08] mystery we shall not all sleep
[1:26:10] but we shall all be changed
[1:26:15] amen any moment in the twinkling of an
[1:26:19] eye at the last trump for the trumpet
[1:26:23] shall sound
[1:26:24] and the dead shall be raised
[1:26:26] incorruptable
[1:26:27] and we shall be changed for this
[1:26:30] corruption
[1:26:32] shall must put on incorruption and this
[1:26:34] mortal must put on imma
[1:26:36] mortality so when this corruptible shall
[1:26:40] have put on incorruption and this mortal
[1:26:42] shall have put on immortality
[1:26:44] then shall be brought to pass saying
[1:26:46] that is written
[1:26:47] death is swallowed up in victory
[1:26:50] paul once again to the thessalonians
[1:26:52] says about the same thing and from
[1:26:54] scripture we were
[1:26:55] familiar with he says i would not have
[1:26:57] you to be ignorant brother concerning
[1:26:59] those which are asleep that ye saw not
[1:27:01] even as others
[1:27:02] which have no hope but if you believe
[1:27:04] that jesus died and rose again
[1:27:06] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[1:27:08] will god bring
[1:27:10] with him for this we say unto you by the
[1:27:13] word of the lord that we which are alive
[1:27:14] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[1:27:16] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:27:18] for their lord himself shall descend
[1:27:20] from heaven with a shout with the work
[1:27:22] of voice of the archangel and with the
[1:27:24] trump of god
[1:27:26] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:27:29] then we which are alive and remain and
[1:27:31] shall be caught up together with them
[1:27:32] in the clouds to meet the lord in the
[1:27:34] air and so shall we ever be with the
[1:27:36] lord wherefore comfort one another with
[1:27:38] these words
[1:27:40] amen now
[1:27:45] there is a scripture that i missed
[1:27:53] huh okay
[1:27:59] so let me go back for just a second
[1:28:02] i don't know if i can even find it for a
[1:28:04] preacher i really should be able to do
[1:28:06] this but
[1:28:07] i'm not finding it all right
[1:28:10] over in corinthians
[1:28:15] maybe brother bad would know for if this
[1:28:18] earthly tabernacle of this house be
[1:28:19] dissolved we have one waiting
[1:28:22] it's in corinthians i should know where
[1:28:28] that
[1:28:28] is just right off the go get but i don't
[1:28:32] that's really one of the one of the ones
[1:28:33] i wanted to quote
[1:28:39] it's the beginning of a chapter this i'm
[1:28:44] relatively sure of
[1:28:47] speak of men and angels and so forth all
[1:28:50] right
[1:28:51] we'll leave that we'll just just repeat
[1:28:53] that for you okay
[1:28:54] how many members are familiar with the
[1:28:56] scripture he says for we which uh
[1:28:59] uh before this earthly tabernacle of
[1:29:01] this house
[1:29:02] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:29:05] in the heavens
[1:29:07] ii corinthians
[1:29:10] thank you second corinthians 5 and 1.
[1:29:13] there it is
[1:29:15] i'll tell you what when i switch bibles
[1:29:16] i can't just go to that certain
[1:29:18] neck you know and so that happens but we
[1:29:21] know
[1:29:22] chapter 5 second to corinthians for we
[1:29:24] know that if our earthly
[1:29:25] house of this tabernacle were dissolved
[1:29:29] we have a building of god a house not
[1:29:31] made with hands
[1:29:33] eternal in the heavens praise be to god
[1:29:37] how many knows we've had that explained
[1:29:39] to us by a prophet of god
[1:29:40] vindicated prophet of god exactly what
[1:29:44] that means
[1:29:44] so anybody that any denominational
[1:29:47] person amishman and i whoever
[1:29:49] most of the time when they don't
[1:29:50] understand that hardly at all
[1:29:52] but you and i understand it perfectly
[1:29:54] because brother branham
[1:29:55] he went over there didn't he he went
[1:29:58] over there and he seen
[1:29:59] the second house that we have which is
[1:30:01] the theophany house
[1:30:03] i believe that second home that we have
[1:30:05] is a theophany body
[1:30:07] when he was over there you know they
[1:30:09] were not eating or drinking they were
[1:30:10] just in a perfect body in a perfect
[1:30:12] place
[1:30:13] now brother brahm says after the rapture
[1:30:16] when the rapture comes they come back
[1:30:18] and they pick up a what glorified body
[1:30:22] what is that that is the actual if this
[1:30:24] goes to the ashes goes to the dust
[1:30:26] it doesn't matter where it is those
[1:30:29] atoms now it won't come up
[1:30:30] corrupt it comes up paul said incorrupt
[1:30:33] but he takes
[1:30:35] to redeem something is to bring back
[1:30:37] it's not to take something else if one
[1:30:39] falls down to redeem something is to
[1:30:41] bring the same thing back but abraham
[1:30:42] says resurrection and all that
[1:30:44] it's not to bring a different body up
[1:30:46] because there's
[1:30:47] people around a message some perhaps
[1:30:48] even don't think it'll be the same body
[1:30:50] it'll be it's a different body no
[1:30:52] it'll be the same adam's i don't care
[1:30:54] what it is god will bring that back
[1:30:56] brother brown clearly said he says i
[1:30:58] don't care where my atoms my burnt ashes
[1:31:00] bring me gotta call that thing back amen
[1:31:02] but it'll be in a glorified state it'll
[1:31:04] be
[1:31:05] you amen amen so that's our second body
[1:31:09] of course is the theophany body now
[1:31:11] he's at one place you know you are here
[1:31:15] this is where it's hard to comprehend
[1:31:16] for the world you are
[1:31:18] here what you are somewhere else
[1:31:23] i mean so you have a representation over
[1:31:26] there
[1:31:27] and he says you know that body is
[1:31:30] perfect
[1:31:31] there's not a flaw in that body
[1:31:34] whenever you're at 20 years old that's
[1:31:36] what you'll be
[1:31:38] amen an old lady over 80 years old that
[1:31:40] passed away come
[1:31:41] to hug brother ma'am say oh brother
[1:31:42] branham i'm so glad you came
[1:31:44] i'm so glad you preached because you
[1:31:46] came because you went
[1:31:48] because you preached we are here
[1:31:52] and he said you don't recognize her do
[1:31:53] you she was over 80 years 90 years old
[1:31:55] when you let her to the lord
[1:31:57] how about the old man that was out there
[1:31:58] and lived in the country amen and he was
[1:32:01] about 80 some years old and he was an
[1:32:02] infidel don't beli
[1:32:04] atheist didn't believe in god and that
[1:32:07] right didn't believe in god and
[1:32:08] everything else and brother branham
[1:32:09] ended up leading him
[1:32:10] to the lord through that woman neighbor
[1:32:12] of his that was healed of cancer
[1:32:14] completely
[1:32:15] he got to telling him hey that woman she
[1:32:17] was completely healed
[1:32:18] the preacher told her her sister or
[1:32:20] somebody take this handkerchief lay it
[1:32:22] upon her
[1:32:22] and she did and she was healed but
[1:32:25] everybody says the man was preaching to
[1:32:26] me
[1:32:28] he says you tell me what tells that tree
[1:32:30] sap to go down into the roots
[1:32:32] what intelligence tells us apple trees
[1:32:34] happen to go into the roots before
[1:32:35] winter comes
[1:32:36] and i'll tell you it's the same
[1:32:37] intelligence told me what was wrong with
[1:32:39] that woman and was just going to be
[1:32:42] amen how many believers will see them
[1:32:45] but they'll be in their perfect youth
[1:32:48] form again
[1:32:49] amen now there is things that i don't
[1:32:52] understand amen things that i don't
[1:32:55] understand
[1:32:55] and that is if we come back with the
[1:32:58] theo
[1:32:58] if they come back with the theophany to
[1:33:00] pick up a glorified body
[1:33:02] what happens with the theophany body
[1:33:05] can't answer that i don't know
[1:33:06] i don't know if it goes within the
[1:33:08] glorified body i don't know
[1:33:10] all i know is one place jesus said don't
[1:33:12] touch me i haven't been glorified yet
[1:33:14] and that right but in another place he
[1:33:16] came back
[1:33:17] and he could go through walls not right
[1:33:19] he could walk
[1:33:20] right through walls and he says give me
[1:33:22] fish to eat he ate fish and bread
[1:33:24] he could eat and drink he could do all
[1:33:27] of that and still go through walls
[1:33:30] so i don't understand it but god knows
[1:33:32] what he's doing isn't that right
[1:33:33] it's in his hands and right now they're
[1:33:36] over there and they don't eat and drink
[1:33:37] but they'll come back
[1:33:38] and brother bam says when we come back
[1:33:40] we pick up those glorified bodies so
[1:33:42] that we can eat and drink
[1:33:44] and to live through a thousand year
[1:33:46] millennial
[1:33:47] i'm just looking forward to that i don't
[1:33:49] know about you but i'm looking for it
[1:33:50] it's my whole goal is my whole ambition
[1:33:53] is for that
[1:33:54] home that's bright and fair be no more
[1:33:58] death no more old age
[1:33:59] no more passing away and for me
[1:34:02] that takes care of all the rest i'll
[1:34:05] have my life right
[1:34:06] i'll make myself make sure i'm ready to
[1:34:08] go if you've got that hope the bible
[1:34:11] says you're going to see to it that
[1:34:12] you're ready
[1:34:13] amen oh my time does go fast
[1:34:18] all right end with a
[1:34:22] quote if that's all right now
[1:34:26] brother branham is preaching on god's
[1:34:28] only provided place of worship
[1:34:30] he says and as i see all of us the three
[1:34:33] of us getting creeping up towards that
[1:34:35] age
[1:34:35] i guess he was talking about a couple of
[1:34:37] friends he is getting older well we
[1:34:38] could say the same thing
[1:34:40] all right towards that age the end
[1:34:45] it would be very sad thing if we didn't
[1:34:47] have
[1:34:48] place within us that great thing
[1:34:52] what we know is true we're fixing to
[1:34:54] turn back
[1:34:55] one of these days back to our young
[1:34:58] manhood
[1:34:59] again our bodies will be transformed
[1:35:03] made into his likeness to stand forever
[1:35:06] for when this earthly tabernacle of our
[1:35:09] habitation is dissolved
[1:35:10] there's one already waiting and the
[1:35:14] thankful part
[1:35:15] of it dear friend that the lord jesus
[1:35:19] you trust me to tell you the truth the
[1:35:22] dear lord jesus one morning about eight
[1:35:24] o'clock
[1:35:25] let me see that land it wasn't the
[1:35:27] vision
[1:35:28] but i don't want to say that ever what
[1:35:31] it was
[1:35:32] it was just as real as i'm speaking to
[1:35:33] you here now
[1:35:35] i've seen the faces of those people and
[1:35:38] i couldn't
[1:35:38] recognize them they had turned back
[1:35:40] young again
[1:35:42] and it was just as real i'd hold their
[1:35:43] hands and things just as real
[1:35:46] and it helped me because i used to have
[1:35:48] the idea that a person when a person
[1:35:50] died
[1:35:51] just their soul went off but then he
[1:35:54] quoted
[1:35:54] that to me that if this earthly
[1:35:56] tabernacle of our habitation
[1:35:58] we already have one see and we've got to
[1:36:01] have
[1:36:02] that everything and we've got that to
[1:36:05] have
[1:36:05] everything in there than the threes to
[1:36:08] make perfection
[1:36:10] there's the one body here and there's
[1:36:12] the body the celestial body
[1:36:14] and then there's the glorified body in
[1:36:16] the resurrection see
[1:36:18] and it makes it complete it's not a myth
[1:36:20] not just an idea or a spirit
[1:36:23] and then years ago i seen the regions of
[1:36:25] the lost
[1:36:26] and i was there and i tell you friend as
[1:36:29] an old man
[1:36:30] let me persuade you this across this
[1:36:33] nation this morning
[1:36:34] don't you never you never want to view
[1:36:37] that place
[1:36:38] there's no way at all that i could if i
[1:36:41] was an artist with a brush
[1:36:43] and could i couldn't paint the picture
[1:36:45] as a minister i couldn't describe it to
[1:36:47] you
[1:36:47] talk about a hell being
[1:36:51] a burning place it's a million times
[1:36:53] worse than that
[1:36:55] the horrors that go with it
[1:36:58] in heaven or this place whatever it was
[1:37:00] i don't know what to call it
[1:37:02] he referred it to me as the souls that
[1:37:04] are under the altar
[1:37:06] and when it was i have never there's no
[1:37:09] way
[1:37:09] to explain how great it is now you just
[1:37:12] have to take my word
[1:37:13] i'm just a man see but these visions
[1:37:16] that's
[1:37:16] always come to pass just as i've told
[1:37:18] you and you know that
[1:37:20] every one of them has been true and this
[1:37:24] is true also whatever you do
[1:37:28] if you miss everything else
[1:37:31] health strength eyesight whatever it is
[1:37:36] whatever you miss don't
[1:37:39] miss that
[1:37:42] there's nothing to compare with it
[1:37:44] there's no words in the english language
[1:37:47] that could express
[1:37:48] it if you'd say perfect it's beyond that
[1:37:51] superb it's beyond that sublime
[1:37:55] there's no words that could ever express
[1:37:57] it
[1:37:58] and then to think that isn't the end of
[1:38:01] it yet
[1:38:02] i thought me be afraid to come to this
[1:38:06] i said do you eat said not here
[1:38:09] we don't eat here but when we go back
[1:38:11] down to earth
[1:38:13] we'll receive a body that we can eat in
[1:38:17] amen when he comes back
[1:38:20] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:38:23] changed in the moment
[1:38:25] in the twinkling of an eye just change
[1:38:27] from this
[1:38:28] dimension into another one amen
[1:38:31] and we're gonna go and live for a
[1:38:33] thousand years
[1:38:34] how many knows the first thing happens
[1:38:36] is we get picked up and we go to the
