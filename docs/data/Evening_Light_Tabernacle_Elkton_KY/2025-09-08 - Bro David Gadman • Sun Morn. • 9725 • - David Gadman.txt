Amen. You believe that this morning? I believe it with all my heart. Amen. So, if you have your Bibles this morning, turn with me to the book of Psalms, the 23rd chapter this morning. Like I said, I greet each and every one of you in the name of the Lord this morning. I guess this is my water. Amen. And if it ain't, we'll just, you know, praise the Lord, we just drink after one another. Amen. Brother Bram said, we ought to get so close we'd be able to chew one another's gum. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But let me be the first one to chew it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, but anyway, we ought to be in that much in love with one another, though. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms the 23rd chapter. We'll look at the first well, we'll we're going to read all these verses. And every one of us should know this by heart. I learned it when I was a little uh boy in Sunday school. And we had to say it. I was going to uh United Pentecostal Church. And at sun on Sunday afternoon, Sunday nights, Sunday evening service, they had what they call children's church. And they said, and this was during the Easter time, they said if we uh could memorize Psalms 23, we'd get something. Well, I memorized it and I got something and I ain't gonna tell you what I got because I'm kind of embarrassed of what it wasn't nothing bad. It just Well, you know, ask me after church and I may tell you. &gt;&gt; Psalms the 23rd chapter. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. You appreciate him. &gt;&gt; Said, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want." That word actually means lack. I shall not lack. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadth me beside the still waters. He restoth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. How many's got a need this morning? Kind heavenly father, Lord, we just love you this morning. We just appreciate you so much for your mercy and your goodness to us, Lord, for allowing us once again to be able to come into your presence, Lord, with brothers and sisters of like, precious faith. And Father, we just ask, oh God, that you just help us this morning. Lord, I pray, Lord, that I can get myself out of the way and you just speak to us this morning by your word. Lord, I pray, Father, that you just touch each and everyone here this morning, Father. You saw the hands, Lord. You know what was behind each and every hand before it was raised. So, Father, we just ask, oh God, that you just help us this morning to get ourselves out of the way. And you just use us, Lord, this morning as you see fit, Father. Lord, we just love you. We just appreciate you so much, Father. We just ask, oh God, that you just minister to each and every one of us. You saw the hands, you know the needs, Father. Lord, you're a God that can meet each and every need this morning. Whether it whatever the need would be, Father, Lord, your hand not too short that you can't supply, Father. Lord, every need that's represented here this morning, we just ask that you do it, Lord. May you, Lord, move us aside this morning, Lord, and speak to us through your word, Father. Lord, I'm just a yielded vessel to you this morning, Father. I pray, Lord, that you just use me. Help me, Father, as I yield myself to you, Lord. I just lord like that song. I just give myself away. Lord, may I give myself away this morning that you can use me, Father. Help me, Father. Lord God. And I pray, Lord, you'd help each and every one of us. We know in your scripture, Lord, you said that Lord that the word when it goes out, it will not return back void. For when it goes out, it accomplish what it is sent to accomplish what the purpose is for it this morning. May you do that this morning, Father. It's a promise, Lord. And you never backed down on your word. You never you never uh uh uh uh welched on any promise, Lord. But you always kept your word. And Father, we believe you'll keep it this morning. Father, grant it to us this morning. We ask all these things in the lovely name of Jesus Christ. And God's people said, &gt;&gt; you may be seated this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love them this morning. &gt;&gt; You appreciate them, sir. Psalms 23. We read it. And I I' I've I've looked over this many times here. And and I like Psalms. I like the Psalms. I like uh most of it was written by David. And I appreciate David this morning. You believe that this morning? I believe he was a the B Well, the Bible, even the prophet of God said he was a man after God's own heart. He was a man that he never did let anything uh get by him and he always trusted in God and he had a spirit of quick repentance. Anything he done wrong, he was quick to repent of that. &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? And I I want to be like David. &gt;&gt; And so here we read here in Psalms the 23rd chapter that we read that that he said, "The Lord is my shepherd." And I don't believe David was uh I like this pull pit. It's new, isn't it? Since the last time I've been here, so real big and everything. It's real good. Just be courageous. Fear not. I'm with you even in you. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. So anyway, and and he said, I believe David, he not only wrote this as being a a a a shepherd, &gt;&gt; but he also wrote it as being a sheep himself. And that's why he could say because he knew what it was like on both ends of the p perspective. Amen. That he he was not only a shepherd, but he was a sheep too under the great shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ. And that's why he could say, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want." &gt;&gt; In other words, I ain't going to lack anything if he's my shepherd. And if he's our shepherd this morning, we won't lack anything. Whatever we have need of, he'll provide for us as being a shepherd. You believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want or I ain't going to lack. Whatever I have need, whatever you have need of this morning, he ain't going to let you lack. You need healing, he's here to provide it for you. He's your shepherd this morning. He'll provide you healing. If you you need encouragement this morning, he's here to encourage you. You need uplifting this morning, he's here to uplift you. Whatever you have need of this morning, he's here to do it. &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures." &gt;&gt; In studying the sheep, I preached on this many times. In studying the sheep, there's four requirements that it takes in order for a sheep to lie down. Now, all I have is studied through books and stuff. I'm not I've not been a shepherd myself, but you know, I knew my one time my uncle, my he uh uh he had some sheep and everything. And one day we was over there with my aunt and it was her husband and uh uh uh and she he walked out there and was looking across there and I said, "What's he doing?" I asked my aunt said, "Well, he's talking to the sheep." See, the Bible says that the sheep knows the shepherd's voice, &gt;&gt; and a stranger they won't follow. &gt;&gt; So, he said, "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures." And like I said, there's four requirements in order for a sheep to lie down. Number one, they got to be free from fear. &gt;&gt; I thought about that. Free from fear. And I thought, you know what? Sometimes it's that that get the unknown that gets us. &gt;&gt; But fear, worry, mean a brother was talking about it. Worry brings illnesses onto us. Worry brings, Brother Bram said, if you was going to get shot in the morning, why worry about it? &gt;&gt; But if you can have faith, &gt;&gt; it may change the whole situation around. &gt;&gt; But free from fear. Oh, if they only knew. They might not see the shepherd. They may not feel the shepherd, but they can know that he's right there. &gt;&gt; It dispels all fear. &gt;&gt; What about me and you this morning? We may not feel him this morning. We may not see him this morning, but he promised that he'd be right there with us. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And if he's right there with us, all fear is gone &gt;&gt; and we can lie down. Number two, free from hunger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He promised that he'd feed us. &gt;&gt; He promised that he'd supply all of our needs. We pray. He told us to pray like this when he was here cuz even his disciples came to to him and said, "Lord, teach us to pray as John's taught his disciples to pray." He said, "Pray like this. Our Father, it's got to be personal. Which art in heaven, &gt;&gt; hallowed be thy name. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. &gt;&gt; Give us He'll supply whatever we have need of today. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they got to be free from fear, free from hunger, free from pest. &gt;&gt; He said it's nothing that bothers him like the old bot flies and the warble flies and everything. Said he, this shepherd said he had to grow to he had to go to great care intently to take care of his sheep. When the time comes, flies would bother them. Nasal flies that get in their nostrils and everything, but they could be free from fear, free from hunger, free from pest, and number four, free from friction with others of their kind. &gt;&gt; Then they could lie down. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you want to be free from all that? &gt;&gt; He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadth me beside the still waters. Sometimes it ain't the jumping and the shouting and all that, but it's still waters that run deep. &gt;&gt; Remember when uh Elijah was hid back up in the cave? Oh, and he heard the he seen the lightning, he heard the thunder, he heard the wind and everything, but it was in that still small voice. &gt;&gt; Oh my, no wonder David could say, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadth me beside the still waters. He resto my soul. &gt;&gt; Ah, every now and then, brothers and sisters, we need a restoring of the soul. &gt;&gt; The things that we go through and we're all human beings, are we not? Here this morning, none of us is robots. You believe that this morning? We're all human beings. And sometimes we go through things and and and and we go through discouragements. We go through disappointments. We go through uh just the trials of life, the battles that we go through. And sometimes it brings us down and we need a touch. We need a we need a refreshing in the soul in the spirit. Is that right? &gt;&gt; He said as he restores our soul. &gt;&gt; He leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. &gt;&gt; Though we may be going through the valley of the shadow of death, there's still light &gt;&gt; cuz light makes a shadow. Yay. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, &gt;&gt; for thou art with me. &gt;&gt; Thy rod and thy staff, thy they comfort me. You know what, brother Bram said that rod and that staff was was hard preaching. &gt;&gt; Said they comfort me. &gt;&gt; Verse five, there prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. Oh, we need a fresh anointing this morning. Is that right? I need a fresh anointing. You need a fresh anointing. I looked at that that fresh anointing. They said when them flies go, they bother them. Especially them nasal flies and everything. It said he seen a sheep one time get in and them nasal flies and it just run that sheep to death. It go to scratching. It butt his head against a tree trying to get some relief and everything. So he had his own h kind of he and I forget what all he took. It was tar and and I forget what all he had. a mixture of stuff that he mixed together and he just anointed that sheep's head. Oh, hallelujah. I want my head anointed this morning. Amen. From Almighty God. Hallelujah. He said, "My cup runth over." Amen. I want my cup running over. I want it full, but I want it running over. So maybe I'll have to drink from my saucer cuz my cup's running over. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he said in verse six, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." And that's what I want to kind of speak on this. Surely goodness and mercy. &gt;&gt; Like I said, the sheep know their shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know the shepherd today. &gt;&gt; And I don't believe we need to uh uh nothing. We don't need nothing to worry about. We shouldn't we shouldn't worry about anything because the shepherds got everything under control. &gt;&gt; You believe that? The shepherd's got everything under control. So why should we worry this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's goodness and mercy I believe will be will be the treatment received from the master's expert loving hands from the shepherd's exert loving hands. That's what he's going to give them sheep. goodness and mercy. And many of you are type of sheep this morning. And I believe that's what many of you are going to get this morning is surely goodness and mercy. Amen. I want some of that this morning. It's surely goodness and his mercy. That's what I want this morning. Oh, you know, I feel this way about Christ. Amen. said, "I believe he sure he's truly concerned about each and every one of us this morning." &gt;&gt; He's concerned about what you go through this morning. He's concerned about what your needs are this morning. That's why he said, "I will supply every one of your needs." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why David could cry out, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not lack." Like I said this morning, whatever you have need of this morning, you need more of the Holy Ghost. Well, the there the more of the Holy Ghost to receive this morning. The deep calling to the deep. If there's a deep calling, there's a deep to respond to that call this morning. You want more of him this morning. I believe there's more of him to receive. &gt;&gt; I need more of him this morning. &gt;&gt; I thank him for what he's brought me through. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, I I was passing blood for over a year and I came out when I first had my first colonoscopy about a year ago, year and a half ago. I got in there, man. I was ready. Brother David, I was ready. &gt;&gt; Hey, they told me said, "Man, you going to have to drink that nasty stuff and everything." And I was kind of be honest, I was ready. First one I ever had. I was kind of scared. I I'll be honest with you. Hey, let's be honest. We're all human beings. &gt;&gt; Some of us go to the dentist and we get kind of scared. Hey, you never know anymore. &gt;&gt; You just never know. &gt;&gt; Hey, I want to be in God's hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be in his hands. I'll just give you a brief rundown. Can I real quickly? So, about a year and a half ago, went through my first colonoscopy. This guy, he was just a a general uh surgeon. He was not a colonoscopy doctor. in that in that field or that expert in that field cuz sometimes they want to send you to, you know, uh somebody that's whatever trouble you got, they want to send you to somebody that's kind of expert in that field. So, I got in there and I drunk all that stuff the night before and everything. Got ready, got in there and my wife noticed they came and got me. You know, you know how it is. They come in there and take the vi your vitals and everything. Come in there, the anesthesiologist comes and talks to you and all this stuff. And I don't know why they always tell me. They said, "Now, this is the same thing that uh what Michael Jackson took. I don't know why they tell you that." Anyway, I said, "Well, okay. Thank God." So, they they will me back there, you know. My wife kissed me. So, I she said, "Well, we'll have them back about 20 30 minutes." And she was noticing everybody was coming back laying on their side cuz how they do the procedure and everything laying on your side and everything for and all that stuff and all that. And so I came back and I had a tube down my throat, oxygen up my nose. They asked my wife said, "Hey, has he ever drank? He ever smoked?" Said he needs to go see his heart doctor. My oxygen level dropped. My heart started acting up. The doctor came in there and said, "I'm sorry. only got a third of it done. I was very disappointed. So from that point on, for over a year of trying to get my heart regulated, trying to find out what was wrong with my heart, what was wrong with my oxygen level dropped. Finally, make a long story short, got that all tended to back in April this year. Had my next colonoscopy, they found a polip. It was about 5 cm, which is about 2 in long. And and then said he took took it out. Said it was like a cauliflower. Said he cut it off at the base. Said sent it off to get it, you know, get it biopsied. Said and he even gave us his personal number. Said, "Call me cuz you call my office." Said, "Probably in a couple days I I'll know just what it is or if it's benign or cancerous or whatever." Said, "Call me. Don't call my office because you probably won't get a hold of me." Said, "Just call me." Well, I tried to call him. He called us back on a Friday. said it was cantress said but I think I got it all said but I want you to come back in and do another colonoscopy in in uh May went back in he took two more pallets out but nothing wrong with them but he said but between then and there I had to have a CT scan had to have a PET scan and all them things but everything came back all out good and everything he said well there's 10 inches right there certain spot there 10 inches that needs to come out about 10 inches there It's bunching up. It's nearing right there and it needs to come out. It's right there where that polip was. And so said, "So, so said so do you have a surgeon?" I go, "No, I don't have a surgeon." He So he he he named someone. I said, "Okay." He said, "He's he's top-notch in the field." I said, "Good." Said, "But something happened and they called me the day before I was going to go see this surgeon." Said, "He's on emergency medical leave. We don't know when he's going to be back." I said, ' Man, I said, 'Well, Lord, you got everything under control &gt;&gt; through the grape vine. We kind of heard what maybe happened. Whether that's true or not, don't know, but then God put me with another one cuz I think it was God. He usually put, you know, and I like this surgeon. He seems like he knowed everything. He he he did it uh uh robotically and uh what do you call it? Appostocopic or whatever you call it. He's a expert in that field. had about 15 20 years experience. Want somebody with experience. But before that, you know, he said, "We'll get together." But before that, I ended back up in the hospital running back and forth to the restroom. Couldn't hardly make it sometimes. And and come to find out what they said. And they did another colonoscopy. Then when I was in the hospital, cuz a surgeon came in said, "Hey, your doctor, your colonoscopy doctor, he wants to do another one." He said, "Now both of them," he said, "now tomorrow." He said, "If everything comes out all right." But he said, "Cuz you want two good ends when we reconnect it to be healthy. You want this end and this end to be healthy cuz you don't want no bag. I don't want to have to give you a bag." I said, "Okay, but come back." Wasn't cuz the colonoscopy doctor said, "Man, your colon looks like hamburger meat. Look like it's been chewed on." Said Kate said, "You need to wait about a month." Boy, I was disappointed. But you know, still God's got everything under control. Went back in, seen my colonoscopy doctor. He said he thought I had Crohn's. They tested me for IBS, ultrated colitis, and uh uh Crohn's disease. Said I thought he may have Crohn's, but then he said, "I don't think he did. I think he got food poisoning, whatever. But I know God takes care of everything." So about what a month later had another CT scan. Everything came back all right. Said, "You're good to go with your surgery." So I had surgery, like I said, five weeks ago. went and then my surgeon I seen him two weeks after the surgery and he wasn't there but his nurse practitioner she goes I'm from the old school I didn't get these gray hairs for nothing said I want to send you to a cancer doctor sent me to a cancer doctor he came out there said I got some good news &gt;&gt; said you don't have no have no treatments or nothing said everything's fine said I just want you to come back in six months so we can keep up with you to see how you're doing &gt;&gt; I stopped him right there you You know what I said? I said, you know what I said? Stop right there for a minute. I said, "Thank God." Amen. I said, "Hey, I thank God that he gave you the knowledge to know how to take care of me, but hey, I also uh my ultimate healing comes from God." Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, so he knows how to take care of us. Amen. Oh, I feel that way about Christ. He's truly concerned about me. And no matter what happens in my life or in your life this morning, we're being followed by goodness and mercy. Amen. I'm glad for that. That's what we're being followed by this morning is his goodness and his mercy. Our body may break down. Your body may break down. It just hey, it just the way it is. &gt;&gt; And sometimes some of ours breaks down fast sooner quicker than others. It's just a grabag of life. That's just the way it is. Our bodies break down. The prophet of God said about the age of 20, 25, you start dying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hey, and that's just the way it is. Body breaks down. Sometimes we stand back helpless as our spouse dies or whatever. Your job may fold up. Whatever it may be. Hey, that's just the way it is. But what is your reaction to everything? Yes. &gt;&gt; What's your reaction? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Children running with the wrong crowd. Your friends prove false, turn against you, but you got surely goodness and mercy following you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for your goodness and your mercy this morning. the shepherd, he may, you know, you looking back, a shepherd may look back and see, my everything that he's been through to take care of them sheep cuz he wants to make sure, especially if he's got them to uh to to kind of uh breed them back and forth or whatever and sell them and what he wants to make sure he has a good stock. He makes he wants to make sure he's got a good breed &gt;&gt; if he's going to make try to make some money or a business with it.

He wants us to bear fruit. &gt;&gt; He wants us to be productive. And so he goes through a lot of things &gt;&gt; to bring me and you to where we're at today. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And a shepherd he if he looks back maybe over the years caring for his sheep. Maybe they they he's been through utter calamities and we can say that that may be in the natural but what about the spiritual sometimes looking back the great shepherd looking back oh he might has brought he might have has brought us through utter calamities this morning we might have been through in all kinds of situations this morning ups and downs in and outs past we might have took like going through a uh going down a blind alley, might have been black as night, but the end it turned out for my benefit &gt;&gt; and my well-being. &gt;&gt; I might not know why I went through that calamity. I might have not known why I've been going maybe seem like a going through a blind alley. Didn't know which direction I was going. baby, so to speak. Might have been as black as night, but at the end, it turned out for my good. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me tell you something this morning, church.

You promise you take care of me. You make me let lie down in green pastures. Let me be free from fear. Let me be free from pest. Let me be free from everything that bothers me, Lord. &gt;&gt; And y'all turn out all right, Lord. Why do I love him? Because he first loved me. Jesus loves me &gt;&gt; and he loves you. &gt;&gt; You said, "How do you know?" The Bible tells me so. &gt;&gt; His goodness and his mercy are new every day. &gt;&gt; Every morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That song the brother sung, I think. What would I do without the Lord? &gt;&gt; What would you do this morning without the Lord? the song. I thank that sister sung. Amen. Oh, I thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I just want to have strength to praise you this morning. I can't thank him enough. &gt;&gt; I can't praise him enough. &gt;&gt; I can't lift my hands enough to him. &gt;&gt; He's been so good to me. I love him because he first loved me. Thank you, Lord. Loved me when I was unlovable. &gt;&gt; When you think no one else cares, he cares. &gt;&gt; He cares. Do you care? &gt;&gt; When you think no one else loves you, he loves you. &gt;&gt; When you think everything is going against you, he's not against you. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's working it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may not think it, but he's working it out. &gt;&gt; It'll be for your good and your benefit. Hallelujah. Amen. First John 3:16 says it like this. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us, we ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren. We ought to be able to lay down our lives for one another. Amen. Lay down our lives for each other. &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to pray for one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, this brother said, I don't care. I ain't I didn't come here to say the differences we have or or whatever." We are to love one another. &gt;&gt; We are to pray for one another. &gt;&gt; His good I don't want his goodness and mercy. I don't want it to become stagnate stagnated in my life. You said, "Well, brother David, what are you talking about? I want to be able to pass it on to others." &gt;&gt; You take I used to clean for a living uh custodial work and you may make a good, you know, solution of mop water and I mop the floor and it may smell so good and everything, but you know what happens to it? If you lay it sit there and set there and set there, &gt;&gt; it becomes stagnated. &gt;&gt; We just let goodness and mercy sit in our lives. Let it sit and let it sit and we don't pass it on to others. We don't let it flow out of our lives like it's supposed to. You know what happens? It becomes stagnated in our lives. I don't want it to become stagnated. &gt;&gt; I want to pass it on to others. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want it to be a positive and practical aspect that my life in turn can be a blessing to somebody else. &gt;&gt; You want your life to be, hey, I want my when I go around wherever I might go to, when I go uh uh uh uh preaching for somebody else or whatever it is, I don't want to be a hindrance. I don't want to be a burden. I want to be a help. &gt;&gt; I want to put my shoulder to the wheel. &gt;&gt; I want to put my shoulder to the load. &gt;&gt; I remember one time and I'm kind of like, you know, some I'm glad my wife, she gets to go with me quite a bit now and places, but one place one time she wasn't there. They said, 'Now, Brother David, if you see anything on the table that is not there, he's eating, you know, said just, you know, get up and get it. Look in the refrigerator. &gt;&gt; Well, I remember what Brother Brown said when he preached on doors in a door. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you invite me to my house, you know how it is." He said, "You got many doors. If he just comes in there and you say, "Wait a right here. Christ ain't very welcome, but you want him to go in every room of your heart." He said somebody called told me so brother just he said I go to the refrigerator I make me a big sandwich I'd kick off my shoes I go get in bed and I'll just have me a gastronomical jubilee &gt;&gt; where something wasn't sitting on the table and I look around I said well they ain't got this I said y'all ain't got this on the table I said I just got up and went over their refrigerator open their door my wife would have killed me if she'd have been with me but hey they said make yourself at home. &gt;&gt; I went somewhere and I told them they and and and and their testimony here and I ain't trying to be braggious this morning or whatever, but they told me said, "Brother David said, we've never had anybody like cuz I I being a I I ain't been a pastor, but I I know Brother Homer, different ones. I've been sitting under him for about 25 years now and and different ones. And hey, and I understand that, hey, what they go through sometimes and people they invite that to maybe they'd want to help the church, encourage you, and sometimes you don't know who you going to invite, what kind of character that guy is going to be. &gt;&gt; So I was there and the the pastor's wife said, "Brother Dave, we appreciate you being here." Said, "You just" said, "Man, you just don't know." Said, "You just been so respectful and we ain't had to do much. Ain't had to pick up behind you." Said, I said, "Well, I thank you. I appreciate that. They they respected me for that." I said, "Hey, I I'm an example not only to my church, but to Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to be a blessing to others. &gt;&gt; I don't, like I said, I don't want to be a hindrance. Amen. I want my life to be a blessing. I want to say, "Hey, I want my life to to I want my light to shine." I was reading the message this morning, Brother at the end of the message, he was singing that song, Lord, let the shine on me. Shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine on. That's what I want him to do this morning. Shine on me, Lord. Let your goodness and your mercy flow out of my life to others. [Applause] But sheep under the wrong kind of shepherd, they say they're the most destructive livestock that there is. They said they can run and uh make ra and ravage land almost above remedy. In other words, if they're under the wrong kind of shepherd and they're the most destructive livestock, they can ravage a land to where you there's maybe not any remedy for that land at all. I thought my they can r but they on the contrast they can be the most beneficial of all livestock. It just depends on what kind of shepherd they're sent under. Don't you want to be under the right kind of shepherd? &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, he's just a shepherd under the great shepherd. But the prophet of God said, "You ought to pray about who you set under." &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us, Lord. He said they could be the most beneficial under the right leadership, under the right shepherd. He said, "And if they're fed the right kind of food, they're fed the right kind of sheep food and everything, it's they that that that said their manure can be the best fertilizer that ever was. If they're fed right, they're under the right kind of shepherd. They're fed the right kind of food and everything. They can be the most productive livestock that there is, the most beneficial livestock. Their manure is the best fertilizer. But if they eat the wrong kind of stuff and they eat something maybe something that they can spread through their through their waist or whatever it it a noxious weed or whatever. My my it just it just ravages the land. But the flock if they're well managed they can restore land. My and that's why if they're they're well managed and everything a flock of sheep can restore a land. That's why they always refer they refer to sheep as those of the golden hooves because they can make a my he said I've seen some beautiful land beautiful landscapes that the sheep their manure and everything has been there and they they they were fed well they were took care well. He said, "I seen many parks that were beautiful and it's because sheep had grazed on them and everything." And this shepherd that I was uh was reading about that had sheep, he said, "I had to restore," he said, "I had to restore two ranches myself cuz there the sheep wasn't taken care of and they just uh just ravaged the land and everything around them. It ruined the the the the ranch and everything." But he said, "I had to take and restore those two ranches if I could." And he did. He said, he said, "But what about my life? What about your life this morning? Is it a blessing that you leave behind? What do you leave behind on your job? What do you leave behind?" Amen. &gt;&gt; I know when we're working sometimes, brothers and sisters, especially if you're working maybe in a in a place in a factory or whatever it may be, sometimes the people you work with, they can kind of frustrate you. You get to a place, hey, just let me do it. You know, you know how it is, brother. Sometimes you got help or whatever, you just, hey, let let me do it. Just let me you go about your business. I'll take care of this. But what does your life leave behind? This shepherd that I was reading about, he said one time this he had this couple of guys that were staying with him. And so he would they was going to go on this trip and they asked him to come along. So he said he would and said when they left and when they got to the place where they were going, that one guy that had stayed with him, he said, "Oh man," he said, "I forgot my hat at your house." He said, "You think you can call your wife and have her look for it and find my hat and send it to where we're at now?" So he called his wife. She got to looking around and she looked everywhere and every corner of the house, everywhere, every place she could think of. She called back said, evidently he didn't even he didn't bring his hat or whatever, but he didn't leave it behind, but said he did leave something behind and that was a blessing. What about you? What do people feel about me? What do people feel about you? Do you leave a trail of sad uh glad sadness or do you live a trail of gladness? &gt;&gt; Do you live goodness and mercy &gt;&gt; or do they forget you at all about you? Do you deposit a blessing or misery others? Is your life a pleasure or is it a pain? &gt;&gt; Isaiah 52:7. Now, we always quote this scripture that I'm fixing to quote to you. We always talk about ministers. How beautiful are the How beautiful mountains are the feet of him that bring good tidings. I always say that ministers have pretty feet because they bring good tidings. But listen to all of it. How beautiful are the ma upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that bringeth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publishes salvation that saith unto Zion. Thy God reignth. Amen. So all of us can deposit something when we go somewhere. Whether it's on our job, in the grocery store, visiting a relative, or whatever it may be, we all can leave good things behind. We can we can publish peace. We can publish salvation. And we can always say, "My God reignth." &gt;&gt; Does your God reign this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me calm down now. They said I got to take it easy for and I don't know how long. You know, I Google and Google's always right. They said usually about four weeks a person's good to go, but I my health my home health nurse said, "You know what?" said cuz I did do some part-time work in a grocery store pulling on pallets, unloading a truck and everything and all that. They said you might not want to go back to doing that about to after the first of the year said because you may look good your scars and everything may look good on the outside but on the inside there was some major surgery. So listen what the prophet of God said kinsman redeemer 1960 he said now on the road back there come a time as her being a type of the church or of the Christian talking about you know he's talking about Ruth and all that as each individual each individual we as individuals represent the entire Christian nation &gt;&gt; did you know that you and your behavior and the way you act and what you do, you represent the entire body of Christ. &gt;&gt; So when I was at that place preaching, visiting, I represent brother Homer and his church. &gt;&gt; Not only that, but I represent him. They tell me, and I've heard brother Billy Paul's testimony many times. He said, "My dad had friends and my dad had enemies, but you could not distinguish the two from each other. He loved them just the same. &gt;&gt; He's still working on me." Amen. &gt;&gt; In your behavior, in the way you act, and what you do represent the entire body of Christ. I say, Lord, I don't want to bring a reproach. Let goodness and mercy follow me. &gt;&gt; Let me not bring a reproach to your cause, Lord. Let me What did the prophet of God say one of his last messages? What house will you build me in Tucson 1965? He said, keep all the smud off the message. They leave me live in such a way. I remember one time, I forget where we was at, and I was listening brother Billy Paul's testimony and coming back across, I forget where they was coming from. I think California or somewhere. And somebody had put some fresh nuts or whatever in the car. Brother Brandham didn't know about it. I think they handed them to Billy Paul and he put them in there. Well, when they go through, you have to press, you have to pass through the port of entry, you know, out the states and they always asked you there said, "Do you have any fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, fresh uh whatever?" And brother did not know about them nuts being in there. Well, when he got home, two hours down the road home. When he got home, as I was unloading the car, he said, "Where did these come from?" Cuz when they crossed, Billy Paul was asleep in a car. He said, "Well, somebody," he said, "Well, I told that guy at the state line that I didn't have any." You know what he did? He got in his car, drove two hours back &gt;&gt; and said, "I'm sorry." What would we have done? &gt;&gt; Goodness and mercy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet human being just like me and you are. He got frustrated because of them lawyers and everything called him and when they rang and sister his wife answered the phone system meet. He said Bill it's them lawyers again. He ran out the back said tell them I'm not here. &gt;&gt; Huh? He got frustrated. He got upset. Hey. He got stressed out when he came back in the house just me you know crying and everything said hey you know and all all all that said do you I I wasn't here I I I had stepped out back I think what was it that he said that phone ring he said daddy should I tell Joseph little Joseph said daddy should I tell them you're not here or whatever see everything that we do it causes an effect on somebody else and he started to pray for somebody. You remember the story? &gt;&gt; He went to lay hands on a little girl that was sick and God said, "Hey, you told a lie and now you going to lay hands and he won't apologize to that lawyer." See, our behavior, we represent the entire body of Christ. You say, "But I'm just a lay member." That doesn't matter. When you take on that name of Christian, you represent Christ in his church. You should live like that. You should live like gentlemen, like ladies. Don't never do things of the world because the whole eyes of heaven and earth is cast on you to represent that one thing. No matter how weak you are, how little you are, hold your head right cuz you are a Christian. &gt;&gt; I want to hold my head right this morning cuz I'm a Christian this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then there's some questions we should ask ourselves. Do I leave behind peace in lives or turmoil? Do I leave behind forgiveness or bitterness? Do I leave behind contentment or conflict? Do I leave behind flowers of joy or frustration? Do I leave behind love or bitter anger? some good questions. &gt;&gt; What do you leave behind? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Some people leave behind a mess and they got to cover their tracks. They always say if you tell one lie, you got to tell another one to cover it up. &gt;&gt; Then you got to tell another one to cover that lie up. &gt;&gt; Just be honest. &gt;&gt; Tell the truth in the beginning. &gt;&gt; You'll never have to cover that up. What do you leave behind? What's your behavior? How do you act? You represent the entire body. You leave behind a mess that you got to cover your tracks. We're a true child of God under the good shepherd's care. We're not fear be ashamed. And we can go back to the place where we lived at before. We don't have to worry about anybody turning their heads. We won't have to worry about anybody not talking to us. We won't have to We can hold our heads up high. Why? Because we're a Christian. &gt;&gt; Because we're a child of God. Cuz we leave behind goodness and mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember that one time this one guy, his came to town to visit and he he ran into this guy that he knew, friend of his, ran into his son, his little boy, and he told him all about the things that him and his dad did when they were a little boy, how much rotten stuff they did, how much trouble they got into, all kinds of things that they did that were wrong. And when he went to and when he went back home, he told his dad said, "Dad, I ran into a friend of yours that came to town to visit." And he told me about all the everything that you ever done, all the lies you ever told, every the time you got in trouble. He said, "Next time you run into old John, you go tell John come see me and I'll tell him how this old boy died." &gt;&gt; Amen. This old guy died a long time ago. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, there was a you know, we used to live in a town where I where I grew up. Uh some of my life was in Emerald, Texas. How many knows that's where the prophet left the scene at? Emeralda, Texas. You can read it. And brother Perry Green put out a book, Acts of the Prophet. Emerald, Texas. The old uh uh hospital where he's in. It's a it's a it used a I guess a apartment complex now in it or something like that. It's last time we was there so ran down. But let me tell you, there was a there was a William Brandham that lived many many years ago. See, William Brandham actually didn't die in in Amarella. No, there was a William Brandham that lived many many years ago that swore that he killed the cop that killed his dog. &gt;&gt; There was a William Brandom that lived many years ago that they made fun of, called him a Kentucky squall and and and mashed his face in so he'd have to drink from a straw and went and got a gun and was going to kill every one of them. But that William Brandham died a long time ago. &gt;&gt; And the William Brham that didn't die but just went to sleep in Emerald, Texas was a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] Amen. There's a guy I was read remember reading a story about or reading just a little experts or comments about a guy by the name of David Livingstone was a missionary to Africa and oh my talking about you talk about David Livingstone. He left a a legend. He left the legacy everywhere he went. Everybody loved him and appreciated him and what he did for the slaves and everything in Africa. I think of our own prophet, brother Brown. Wherever he went, whatever was told about him, &gt;&gt; what about me and you this morning? &gt;&gt; What about our lives? &gt;&gt; What about them? How many believes that you have got faults this morning? &gt;&gt; Every one of us &gt;&gt; have got faults. Every one of us has made mistakes. &gt;&gt; Some that we hate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some that we don't like to talk about. Like somebody said one time come by preaching for us said whatever you say and you just tell them said now we won't talk about that. That's a family story. How many's got family stories? &gt;&gt; You don't let nobody know. See, but I wonder, like I said, everybody's got faults. Everybody's made mistakes. Can we overlook one another's faults &gt;&gt; and pray for one another? &gt;&gt; He overlooked our faults. &gt;&gt; We sang that song, Amazing Grace shall always be my song of praise. &gt;&gt; For it was grace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He overlooked my fault and saw my need. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we can look over everybody else's faults this morning and see their need. I need more of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I need more of his Holy Spirit this morning. I need more of his grace this morning. I need more of his love this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. my appreciation of his mercy and his goodness. It a show. Amen. And I wanted not only to show from me, but I wanted to, like I said, I don't want to become stagnated in my life. I wanted to be able to proceed out of my life. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be unable to forgive. And I quoted that prayer that his disciples said said, "Hey, teach us to pray." Our father, it's got to become a personal relationship which art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive our debts as we forgive others. We owe to debt. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "For we all have sinned." David said, "I was conceived in sin, born and shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies." I owed a debt be when I first came in. I owed a debt, born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies. First lie I probably told was to get out of a whipping. We sang that song, I owed a debt I could not pay. &gt;&gt; He paid a debt he didn't owe. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the we for we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; For the wages of sin is what? &gt;&gt; But he forgave our debts. &gt;&gt; What about forgiving somebody else? &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember he tells a story in the Bible Jesus did about this guy that this man came to him said I owed him he owed him so much he couldn't pay it and he that guy forgave him of everything and then that guy that he forgave he went and found somebody that didn't owe him quite as much as he owed that other fell and he wouldn't forgive him. &gt;&gt; Help us Lord. &gt;&gt; I want goodness and mercy to flow out of my life. I want to be able to forgive &gt;&gt; what is it. They said we had visitors this morning. I don't know, but I don't want to be accused if somebody comes and they don't know how we operate or whatever. I don't want to be the ones that run them off or whatever. say, "Hey, is because it's lack of love or because I'm just lukewarm and people get turned off because I don't show I want to Hey, Jesus." He showed love, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Remember that woman when they came to him, threw him at his at his feet and said, "Hey, she was caught in a very act of adultery." The scripture, the law of Moses' law said she ought to be stoned. What you say? The Bible says he stooped down. He stooped that we might be able to be lifted up. &gt;&gt; Can't we stoop for others? Can't we forgive others? Oh my I don't I don't want to have a lack of love. God, give me more of your love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You know, this this this surely this goodness and mercy, it ain't a one-way street. It's a two-way street. back. Hey, I want to proceed. I want I I want goodness and mercy and I want to be able to give goodness and mercy. &gt;&gt; You know, a shepherd in this book, I read this shepherd. He said, "You know what? I can look back and I can say if my sheep are if they're flush, if they're if they're flourishing and the land is flourishing and they're content, I can be a happy camper, so to speak. I can be a happy shepherd because my flocks well taken care of. They're well nourished. The land that they're uh that that is flourishing where they've been on, they're wellfed and they're real content. I wonder if God can look down from the portals of glory this morning and see us as his sheep. See us as his ch children, see us as his sons and his daughters. And he can be he can be very happy this morning and said they're very content this morning. They're wellfed this morning. They're flourishing this morning. Oh, hallelujah. Everything's producing. Amen. Everywhere they go, they're producing. Amen. They're producing the fruits of the spirit in their lives. They got love. They got joy. They got peace. They got longsuffering. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want him to see in my life this morning. Isaiah 53:11 says it like this. He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied. By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many, for he shall bear their iniquities. Hallelujah. He shall see the survail of soul and shall be satisfied. Is he satisfied with you this morning? I think he looks on in my life in tenderness for he loves me deeply. He loves each and every one of you this morning very deeply. He cares about each and every one of you this morning. &gt;&gt; And the long years that he's been taking care of each I don't know how long you've been around. Hey, some of us been been around for a long time. &gt;&gt; Brother Homer, he's been this way over 50 years. 1969 he said when he was baptized. My mom and dad got baptized in 1969 in Hardy, Arkansas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over 50 years and he's had goodness and mercy for me. &gt;&gt; He has he's had patience with me. There many a time that I would have gave up on myself. You'd have gave up on yourself. But hey, over the long years, he had goodness and mercy without slacking. And he longs for to see it passed on to others by me. And not only that, but also passed back to him with joy. And if he can see that, he can look back on over his throne and say, "Hey, that's my son. That's my daughter. They're the sheep of my pastor. And I'm glad that they're in the fold." Amen. Hallelujah. He longs for my love. That's what he longs for. He longs for love. My love. He longs for your love this morning. I want to say I love you Lord. &gt;&gt; I appreciate you this morning. I thank you this morning. I love him because he first loved me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he longs for my love and I can love him and pass this goodness and mercy on to others, then I believe he is satisfied this morning. &gt;&gt; Let me read you these couple things, then we'll try to get out of here. The hidden life 1956 hidden life with Christ. God didn't put you here to work in a factory just alone. &gt;&gt; So if you're here working young people, you working in a factory school or whatever, he didn't put you in here just to do that alone. He put you in he put you here as a testimony, a written epistol read of all men. &gt;&gt; There may be people that don't even read the Bible, but they'll read your life. That's right. &gt;&gt; When they read your life, what are they reading this morning? &gt;&gt; I hope they read Christ in mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "He put you here as a testimony, a written epistle read of all men to live an honorable and decent life and a hid, consecrated life with God, so that men would know that Jesus Christ still lives and reigns. When I'm at school, when I'm on the job, when I'm in the grocery, wherever I may be, I want people to know that Christ still lives and reigns. &gt;&gt; Still lives and reigns. Amen. He said, "That's a little pinchy, but it's good. It'll help your digestion orders. It's helping mine." &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I read this, I I didn't know he said it, you know. And I read that brother David. I said, "My cuz I just before I had my surgery, he said, "Hey, this is" He said he he he said, "You hear a written epistle read over all men to live an honorable and decent life, a life consecrated to tell to so that men would know that Jesus Christ still lives and reign." He said, "That's a little pinchy, but he said it it's good. It helped your digestion orders." I said, "God, you're helping mine both naturally and spiritually." Amen. He said, you know, to take the food, right? &gt;&gt; Cuz hey, I've been on a kind of a strict diet. Amen. So, hey, I I I said, man, thank you, Lord. I read that. I said, "Thank you, Lord. Let me show people that you still live in rain." Amen. It not only helped my digestion order spirit naturally, but it helped them spiritually to take the food right. Amen. When Brother Tom comes out here and he's preaching to or Brother Brad or whoever it may be, the evangelist, that you'll take the food, right? And it go down into your system and it'll digest right. &gt;&gt; Said it fit you into a place that you can receive healing for both soul and body. &gt;&gt; Again 1958 behold I stand at the door knock and said and when you said you're if you're the salt of the earth then you got to live such a life. What does salt create? A thirst. You ever ate something? And you got so thirsty. He said, "Man, I can't get enough water to drink. Maybe it's what I got. Maybe it's what I ate." He said, "You're the salt of the earth. You got to live such a life. A written epistol to all men will know what you are professed to be." You know they say this, your life speaks so loud I can't hear your testimony. That's right. My he said sometime ago a little story I want to tell you just before that I speaking of think of the importance of Jesus at the door trying to get in to create a brotherly love. He said but your life speaks so loud that I can't hear your testimony. I want people to be able to hear my testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Surely goodness and mercy is following me. Amen. He said here, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." &gt;&gt; Surely goodness and mercy. Let's stand together. Hallelujah. You love him. &gt;&gt; You appreciate him. Amen. You want that surely goodness and mercy. That's what I want this morning. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we love you this morning, Father. And Lord, I just love you so much, Lord Jesus. And Father, once again, just forgive me for not being maybe myself, so to speak, but taking it easy, Lord. But just Lord your prophet said if we go to the doctors we need to try to do what they say. So, Father, I'm just trying to do, but sometimes it's kind of hard, Father, just to get so excited sometimes when we see these things, Lord, and know these things, Father. And maybe this was just simple, Father, this morning, Lord. But, Father, I pray, Lord, that you'd help us, oh God. We want surely goodness and mercy. That's what we want. We don't want your judgment, Lord. We want mercy. We don't want meanness. We want goodness, Lord. We want your mercy. We want your grace, Lord. Cuz Father, we know if we would receive due dice, it'd be the grave and then a devil's hell. But Lord, we want your mercy, Father. Lord, like somebody said, and I was thinking about it, Lord, and somebody said the other day, they said, I don't know if there's ever been a book written about Barabus, Lord, what he thought. He was a murderer. He was a robber. And he went free cuz somebody took his place. And maybe he didn't realize who it was. And maybe that day on Calvary when somebody ran into them and they said, "Hey, Barabus, I thought they was going to execute you. I thought they was going to hang you on a cross." He said, "Yeah, but somebody took my place and maybe somebody heard him and they came up to him and said, "You must be that Barabbus." He said, "Yes." He said, "You was a murderer. You was a robber." He said, "But you see there on the hill that they call Galatha, there's three crosses, but there's a man in the middle." And he fell beneath his load and somebody had to carry his cross. Said, "That guy in the middle, he's the one that took your place. I wonder if he realized who that was and what he had to go through, what he had to suffer, the beat he took that Barabus should have had, the whips that went across his back, the catinetails that Barabus should have felt, but He took his place that he wouldn't have to go. And God, you took my place. Cuz if it wasn't for you, Lord, I couldn't be like David and said, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul." I couldn't say that Lord, but Father, you took my place so that I wouldn't have to go. I want to say thank you, Lord. Words can't express enough how much I love you. Now, Lord, don't let it stay and become stagnated in my life. You had goodness and your mercy, and it didn't only stop there, but it followed me all the days of my life. Lord, don't let it stop there, Lord. Don't let it become stagnated in my life, but it let it flow out of my life to others, Father, that they can know about your goodness and your mercy. That when they see me, they can know about your goodness and your mercy. Maybe I don't even have to say nothing to them, Lord, but they'll understand some of your goodness and your mercy. Grant it, Lord. Grant it, Father. Help us, Father. We don't have to worry. We don't have to care, Lord. We ain't got to care in this life because you took it all. And Lord, when troubles come, when trials come, we just cast all our cares upon you, Lord, for you careth for us. Grant it, Lord. We love you and we appreciate you. Bless your people this morning. Lord, I trust that this was something that was said that would do some good. Lord, let my life be a written epistol. When they read my life, may they read you, Lord. May they see you in my life. Not only me, but these others here this morning. Grant it, Father. For we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Thank you. God bless you this morning. &gt;&gt; And over and over he molds me and makes me into his image. He fashioned the clay, a vessel of honor I am today. And it's all because Jesus didn't throw the clay away. Over and over he molds me and makes me into his image. He fashions the clay vessel of h I am today. And it's all because Jesus didn't throw the clay away. Amen. The goodness of God. I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me. And all my days I've been held in your hand. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head. Oh, I will see of the goodness of God. And all my life you have been faithful. [Music] And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire in darkest of nights. You are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. And I have lived in the goodness of God. Oh, and all my life you have been faithful. [Music] And all my life you have been so so good. If every breath that I am made, oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Cuz all my life and all my life, you have been faithful. [Music] And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am made. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. One more time this morning. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Amen. Has he been good to you this morning? Amen. It's been good to be here. We're going to dismiss this morning. Let's just sing as we go. I'm amazed that you love me. I'm amazed that you love me. And I'm amazed and how you
