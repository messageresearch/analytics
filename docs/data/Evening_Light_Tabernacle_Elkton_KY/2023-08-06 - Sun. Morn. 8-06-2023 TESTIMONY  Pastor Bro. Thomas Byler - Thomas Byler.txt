while amen and so amen I know I mean it might warn you amen the we may end up starting going a little bit longer Services amen would that be all right I have some longer services and so amen I was studying back there and I read where Paul there in the book of Acts amen he preached till midnight amen that midnight that man fell out of the third balcony and killed himself amen and Paul went over and prayed for him to raise up and they preached some more and amen then he said he had talked and spoke and fellowship sound like till the break of day at the break of day he went somewhere else all night long and then I thought wow that's a long service right there praise the Lord amen but I imagine we could stay awake if we had the dead raising up about 12 o'clock wouldn't we amen praise the Lord God is good isn't he and so amen I believe that uh amen the word of God is good and I just really enjoyed the Lord pouring this upon me amen so I trust that it'll be a blessing to you this morning I know that we want to have communion uh this morning and so amen I told the Deacon say man just we would hold off on Sunday school give us plenty of time amen maybe a little more for the word I think we've pretty much scheduled it not to have Sunday school on the first Sunday of the month since we do have communion and so forth and amen and so I'm still still in the trial stage amen we're still kind of in the trial stage of having that communion on Sunday morning but it does seem to work pretty good I think more of a skit to take it that way amen and so that's good because we do want as many as possible to take it amen but we don't want you to go home once for a Sunday night either amen and so amen and I believe tonight we're going to have a special treat so I hope everybody can make it back tonight amen and so we're going to have a testimony service a word of exhortation and so forth and amen and so uh a testimony amen and about what God has done for you amen what God has done for you amen I I tell you that song has really inspired me man that song about let me tell you about my Jesus let me tell you about my Jesus and so that's what we want to do tonight is I mean we want to hear from everybody that God has done something for for you and you get to tell everybody about what Jesus has done for you amen but it'll be good but to have a couple little things in here amen but uh this morning we want to preach on testimony amen testimony amen and so amen it's kind of a different different uh Direction perhaps than what I've went but amen will just trust the Lord in it let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we're so grateful father that before we open your thoughts Lord that you had before the foundation of the world and then you wrote him in a book lord father we realize that that Bible is your thoughts manifested and wrote on paper Lord and before we open that book lord Jesus and read your thoughts Lord Jesus and and have what you would have us to speak on Father this morning if we're so grateful to be able to approach the author of the book lord and we just thank God if we thank you for being able to approach you Lord and be able to come before you with the blood of Jesus Christ knowing god that we don't come it's about our own righteousness but we come the righteousness that you created on Calvary we ask God that you'll just bless the reading of the word meditation of our heart and father help us to deliver Lord Jesus what I feel like you have laid on our hearts to speak on this morning Lord Jesus we ask these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ amen it does look like we're going to be kind of busy here amen this month amen and also next month amen with John Michael and Emma's wedding coming up next month and then having some special meetings here even with brother Andrew on the third third Sunday amen so it's going to be a little busy but that's okay amen and next Saturday of course amen amen the wedding shower for them amen trust every everybody will try to come amen and then uh we did schedule some activities for the Youth Amen on the Saturday the third Saturday when brother Andrew will be here amen between 12 and 3 o'clock hey man just a little time for the young people to get together amen and so forth maybe here at the church amen looking forward to those meetings I trust that everybody will be ready and expect amen amen because I'll tell you what brother Andrew is certainly a powerful preacher amen amen but even he definitely needs to have pool amen and so we all want to pull when he gets here I mean as you do always amen we appreciate that amen God bless you we'll open our Bibles to Revelations this morning let's go to the Book of Revelations the first chapter Revelations 1. laughs the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must certainly come to pass and he sinned and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record now I want you to notice that bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of the things that he saw may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen we'll just title this we call the testimony this is going to be a day of testimony we're going to preach on testimony this morning with the help of the Lord amen and then have a testimony meeting this evening amen with the help of the Lord amen so we look at this with the help of the Lord and first of all that word testimony it's it's quite something because amen I didn't pull it up but I read different places where brother banham and he got to talking about like in the courtroom and so forth how that you know that's a lot of times where you have people giving testimony amen and that in order to be uh to give testimony you have to be a witness isn't that right you have to be a witness amen and you have to be there as a prophet of course who said and you know it's something that you had to see you had to be there worry that happened had to happen both the I think he mentioned two things you either have you've had to either see it or hear it amen either your eyes or ears and so forth amen and we realize that of course this whole book here is the Old Testament in the New Testament isn't that right amen and so this is God's testimony amen God's entire testimony amen of the whole book the whole Bible is a testimony and I wrote down here this morning we start here up here he says amen and we realized in this so I want to wrote down here especially today not that it isn't any different entity but especially today as we talk about testimony as we preach the gospel amen and we to realize and to think that as we stand here this morning the power of testimony or the power of preaching amen amen it's a very very powerful thing that you're you you're you're sit back you relax but you don't realize sometimes sometimes we don't realize the power [Music] of preaching and so testifying of the things of God and how important it is to believe God's testimony amen amen I wrote down here we don't realize sometimes but you know it has just a word the words that I speak this morning amen will have the power it's so powerful the words that we speak are so powerful that if you receive them it can actually cause you to live a hundred trillion years in a perfect State now I want to say repeatedly once a hundred trillion years are over then the cycle goes over again calm down calm down think about that the words that we speak this morning will have the power to do that or it'll have the power to send you into hell into damnation into a amen it's total separation from almighty God to be destroyed in the Lake of Fire and to become extinct that's the kind of power we're talking when we come to the house of God so it's important isn't it we need to have our ears open and our eyes open and we need to hear what the spirit saith to the churches amen I realized this morning that this here this this thought that the lord gave me is it's so awesome that it would certainly take a long time but we'll just see how far the lord gave how the Lord how much uh which way the Lord will lead us amen a little more on testimony amen and I'll first talk uh perhaps if I can uh pick it up amen because I didn't write it down but I did look it up just before we come and this is about the testimony that what Jesus would give when Jesus come he gave testimony in Saint John 3 and verse 31 John says he that Cometh From Above is above all and he that is of the earth is Earthly and speakers of the earth he that Cometh From A from Heaven is above all and what he has that's seen and heard that he testifies amen now that was talking about Christ and no man receives his testimony in other words it's very hard for people to receive God's testimony I want you to understand something that amen and I'll read the actual scripture for it but if you don't accept God's testimony you'll be damned and if you accept God's testimony you'll have eternal life it's a power to give you eternal life if you receive God's testimony no man receiveth his testimony he that hath received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true amen for whom for he whom God hath set speaketh the words of God isn't that what Jesus said he says the words that I speak I speak not of myself amen but I receive them of the father I may believe that everything Jesus did he got from a higher authority isn't it something that in order to forgive a testimony you have to be a witness you have to be there but if it says you have to know something and who knows anything more than God himself he knows everything he was there eat chocolate and if you're right you better believe it that's the power that changed your life if you receive it amen now notice so he says he has speak he speaketh the words of God for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him now how many knows that's the only person that ever lived that didn't have the spirit of God by major and that was Christ you and I have the spirit by measure but he had it without measure the fullness of the godhead dwelled in him bodily whatever he said was the testimony of almighty God praise be to God listen to the next verse I I kind of just stumbled upon this because I had stopped reading right there but notice the Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his hands and then in verse 36 he that believeth on the Sun have everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not be he lied how many believes that's the testimony of God but the wrath of God abideth upon him amen so we see that the testimony of Jesus Christ is true one more just laying a foundation here in first John 5 first John 5. and I don't understand too well about that little phrase about bearing record other than being a witness amen and so forth but in verse 7 that's actually just uh yeah let's start with verse seven no no no let's go to verse six this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood now notice and I want you to catch this phrase and it is the spirit that beareth witness amen I mean those it's a spirit that bears witness because the spirit is true for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and d3r1 amen how many knows the Father the word and the Holy Ghost is all the same person all the same and there are three that bear witness on Earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one amen and if we receive the witness of men the witness or testimony the witness of God is greater I may know that my isn't that something how they need to record a law how did you have to put your hand on a Bible to swear that what you tell the testimony that you give is going to be the truth the whole truth and nothing about the truth and then they'll still lie cause you can't believe a man but let me tell you when you put your hand on this you know that you actually know that it is absolute truth God does not lie his word is the truth amen for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his son I may believe the whole Bible it is the witness of God that God testified of his son it's the testimony of Jesus Christ amen the testimony and he that believeth on the Son of God hath to witness in himself and he that believeth not God hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record amen or the testimony are the witness that God gave him his son so like I said earlier to believe his witness to believe his testimony is to receive lives to deny it is to call God fire think about it so let me put you in plain simple language if you disbelief what God said you're calling him a liar thank you everybody that don't believe this is calling God a liar amen and if you'll notice that if you truly believe now notice how many knows many places uh well let me just finish a couple more verses and this is the record that God has given unto us eternal life and this life is in his son he did have the son have life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life amen over in to to go along with a certain verse here if we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater verse 10. he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself amen now we know that uh we we fertile a lot there's a lot of people that say well I believe the Lord Jesus Christ amen and and that's enough that's it that's all I need well brother man says look you know if you truly believe it God would baptize you with the Holy Ghost there's a lot of people that say they believe Lord Jesus Christ but it don't really because the bottom line is he that believeth on me shall not perish isn't that right so it is a simple salvation is in if you truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's how that's that's how it is amen but God gives you the witness that you truly believe a top Prophet taught us according to Abraham Abraham believe God they imputed him for righteous listen God gave him the Sea of circumcision amen as the seal that he truly accepted his faith and if God truly if you truly believe it he that believeth on me shall not perish but have everlasting life Jesus said many places if you truly believe you'll be saved amen amen First Corinthians 12 in verse three that's wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed huh so in other words you can never say that you uh you that you're a holy ghost self person and curse God Holy Ghost will never do that amen even brother Madam you know I Thomas that if a person says well I believe God but I don't believe what that word says I don't believe that he says that person ain't got the Holy Ghost I didn't know nothing about the message the prophet or anything else but when I received the Holy Ghost something told me you believe that from cover to cover from one side all the way to the other and I went out testing everybody see if they really believed all of it I told you about that it don't want to be an old man to tell you 150 times is that right testing everybody do you believe it I don't understand it but that's what the Bible says it's got to be right all I want to hear from you is I amen but it'll kind of be the truth I don't understand it all but that's right and that's without limiting anything else let me tell you if you got the Holy Ghost you'll believe God's word the Holy Ghost believes he's walking he's working something in here mate you believe it oh Hallelujah and then we might not understand we might have not quite understood but Prophet makes a statement he says you know if you say you believe that you believe the Lord Jesus Christ and so forth he says you know that you can't even count you don't even know Jesus is the Christ until you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost cause you don't know him you do not know him until he's in here that's how you know him oh my god notice nobody can say he's a cursor deny his word and all that and that no man can say that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost In other words the witness if you truly believe that witness is going to come into your heart and it is the spirit that Bears record oh even Paul says you know this is how you know that your sons of God even because of the spirit that is within us that's what tells you that you're a Son of God is because the Holy Ghost that's in there oh man praise the Lord you can't deny it people won't believe it people don't want to believe the testimony of almighty God Amen brother Ben be preached on the message called the witness Witnesses he begin with with Jonah uh not Jonah but with Noah is that right I didn't know I had a message in that right no I had a message and sold the world now I want to I wanted to talk to you a little bit with the aspect talking about the aspect that I call it the Thomas effect doubting Thomas effect amen we'll maybe get into that a little bit but Noah he had a message that God said that it's gonna rain I mean everybody believed Noah's testimony got saved everybody that didn't believe is testimony neither the man sucked water up into there until they couldn't breathe no more that's what happens with the rest of them they all died because they would not believe his testimony you know it's not always it's easy to believe it's what you think and I hope with the help of the Lord I know we're going to go a little longer pass but you know we want to just go down through here let me let me uh go into calling a witness let's call a witness first of all and we're going to call a witness this morning and it's called creation we're going to call nature in all of creation amen it's found in Romans if you want to go with me Romans the first chapter Verse 18 for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold a truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God has showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen wow being understood by the things that are made amen being understood by the things that are made even is eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse how many knows that this morning when you got up you testified you witnessed that there's a Resurrection coming when you met the bed last night yeah man you was typing an old man going to the grave and covering up and departing out of this world into the Dreamland huh isn't that right every day that we live testifies that there's a resurrection every cycle of the moon the Half Moon full moon all the way to Full Moon and everything else that's every month testifies every year testifies all of nature testifies every season testifies We're In the Heat of the summer coming down Towers fall hello this spring every time that little leaf buds hello when that little blue not on a tree and it begins to sprout it says there's a Resurrection on every tree on everything it's yelling out hey there's a Resurrection coming if people will just look at the creation they'd know there's a God even as God had his Road in nature and touches things like the lion it's the king of the jungle when he Roars everything else shuts up that every man would be alive and by the truth oh what even the Bible says the lion has roared who can but prophesy he's the line of the tribe of Judah he has prevailed look at the lion look at these eagle the Bible talks about Jehovah ego he's the Jehovah Eagles the king of the birds is that right there's a king of the jungle aren't you glad there's a king in this jungle that's right it's not

intelligence and they were doing something about talking about man becoming God now I'd love to have that Pulpit for a few minutes it wouldn't be very very proper I said man of yeah you're just

make something out of thin air once like God does he'll take squirrels and they're eating on their poop there they are he'll take loads of fish just multiply it that's what I'm talking about all you can do is go with your hardware and all of your mechanics and everything else it ain't nothing you'll answer to the king one of these days I'd like to tell that guy says Hey sir the day will come that

kingdom you can look at the nature of birds and animals and all these other things and realize he's so unique that it has to be a Creator there's got to be something somebody that made that that didn't just happen people [Music] I don't like the words they're used to stupid too much but anybody that you've got to be from stupid not to know that there's somebody that has to make all of that

on talk about the Rocks here's some time ago there was an infidel went across the country oh 20. 30 years ago can I just say what Pops in my mind you say stupid yeah stupid the Bible says that uh he that says there's no God a fool says in his heart now I called you stupid God called you a fool pretty strong in it amen and he was noticed he went across there and he was tearing up church or smart intelligent man he was tearing up the churches and saying there's no such a thing as God and he went to England he was too smart for them here and he took off the England made Commerce there his health broke down he come back went out west to rest and one day he'd made fun of the Bible when he talked about how the handle even destruction happened and now it cut the heels and so forth he thought that was all a bunch of nonsense so he took a little walk one day out along a path and he got to look and hear the winds come down across mountains and he looked up at them great big rocks hanging there he says Oh Mr Rock he says this really did you come the way I think you did or did someone that I don't know put you there brother I'm telling you preachers will hold their peace the rocks will immediately cloud if I said not make rocks cry out that's not how the Rocks convert people let's get people to believe the testimony of God that Infidel fell on his face there and gave his heart to Christ huh why the clergyman held their peace but nature cried out in the midst of it all amen amen isn't that something what he could look at that rock but he can realize hey something had to put it there it just didn't get there by itself this man was getting some serious getting rid of some foolishness and gaining some serious smartness now wasn't he he got some serious intelligence

power of God if that don't bring you to your knees what will to witness the power of God right there I hope they all made I hope everybody in that Barbershop got down on their knees amen and get their heart to God because if they weren't oh if they then they didn't believe the testimony of God amen praise the Lord those two sisters one was in the things dropped right off her throat didn't it the other one is healed of her stomach problem why because they kept testifying by his stripes I am healed now as far as I know whenever the prophet of God had his stomach problem isn't that right he didn't have it thus saith the Lord he didn't have a vision that I know of anywhere that I have found from what he said he simply took God at his word isn't that right simply took God at his word by his stripes I am healed throw it in the God go ahead take a bite mom crying over there so I don't eat dad you'll die sorry Mom I'm dying if if the God don't heal me because I believe I'm Healed right in the bathroom [Music] hi I don't get one to come down to the devil hello I'm Healed he got his healing didn't he we need more faith like that who take God at his word and believe it oh my how many knows John 3 16 it's enough to save everybody if you'll just take out any word believe it's just about it Hallelujah praise the Lord you got to believe every testimony that God give every record that he has given amen a little girl was going down the street one day after she got the Holy Ghost after meeting she got the Holy Ghost saying oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm singing there was an old Infidel sitting over in the corner said what are you so happy about the island said oh Jesus saved me and fill me with the Holy Ghost said I'm so happy amen how many do we have Happy in the morning said look what's that watch what he got there in your hands the Bible said do you believe that sure do you believe all of that all of it you believe that about Jonah yes how many believes that about Jonah I believe it actually believe the whale swallowed the man yes sir I believe it how are you going to prove it besides faith she says well when I get dab and I'll just ask brother Jonah then Fidel said to her as well what if Jonah is not in heaven then you'll have to ask him I guess she didn't care yeah I believe the story he ought to believed the story or he'll have to ask it won't be Jonah you can be up in heaven but he didn't believe the testimony of God amen how many ladies we gotta believe the testimony of God amen let's talk about Paul for a few minutes and then I'm going to go in to our age a little bit more but let's talk about Paul let me see where I've got it here in the book of Acts book of Acts you know Paul was always trying to give a witness he was a witness he had gotten struck down on the road to Emmaus was it Damascus that's right he got struck down he had a personal experience with God and we're taught in Saint John the first chapter that they were told to go into Jerusalem until they'd be endued with power from on high isn't that right he said after the Holy Ghost he's come upon them that they'll be Witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and into the other most parts of the world to be a witness how many believes that we need to be a witness we are all Witnesses how you know brother Bissell I believe long ago he had a wonderful testimony of and he he called it I am a witness but I realized that everybody in here if you're a Son of God if you've been born again you are a witness how about with us I give testimony amen Paul he had it many times how many times he'd say he'd stop him he'd stand on the on the stairs and places and he'd begin to tell him of what God had done and how he's uh he struck him down in his story and so forth just to give him the testimony of what had happened Amen brother bam says you might not be a preacher this out of the other but just tell people how you fire god lit amen you ain't got nothing else oh I want to tell it here at the end of the service before we could I want to give you my testimonies amen let me tell you about my Jesus I love telling you about my Jesus all right but Paul here now notice in Chapter 13 of Acts that went into the synagogue and so forth and after verse 15 13 and 15 and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying this does this Paul in them ye men and Brethren have ye any word of exhortation for the people if you have any word of exhortation say on and I'm going to skip a lot or we'll be here all morning but Paul goes all ultimate from Egypt all the way down to Moses and so forth all the way down all the way to verse 23 he finally comes up close to Jesus's time of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance notice how he's at John's now repentance to all the people of Israel and as John fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that I am I am not he but behold there cometh one half boy Paul had a lot of wisdom when presenting the gospel didn't he whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to lose that's what John the Baptist said men and Brethren Children of the stock of Abraham and whoso among you that feareth God to you is the word of this salvation sent for they that dwell at Jerusalem and the rulers because they knew him not not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him boy isn't that specific in other words because it read the scriptures oh God we can say that and Men amongst the church well today they'll read the scriptures they'll read Malachi 4 they'll read Revelations one two three and the Seven Stars and so forth but they don't never comprehend it if fulfilled it condemning him found no call cause of death in him yet they desired pilate that he should be slain and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a Sepulcher and God raised him from the dead amen and he was and he was sent many days of them which came up with him From Galilee to Jerusalem who are his Witnesses unto the people and we declare unto you glad tidings how did the promise which was made unto the fathers God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children that he hath raised up Jesus again and it is also written in the Psalms second from Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee Paul begins to even bring the scriptures in for him isn't that right and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he said on this wife wise I will give you the sure mercies of David whoever he says also in another Psalm Thou Art not Thou shalt not suffer that Holy One to seek corruption for David after he has served his own Generation by the will of God fell to sleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption Paul trying to point out to him that that's this what Paul what David was talking about Jesus not himself but he whom God raised again saw no corruption be it known unto you therefore men and Brethren that though this man is preached unto you that through this man is preached unto you the Forgiveness of sins and by him all that belief are Justified from all things aren't you glad that you're Justified as though you never know that from everything your entire house has been struck off from which he could not be justified by the law of Moses be fair beware therefore at least that come upon you which was spoken of in the prophets behold ye despisers and wander and perish for our work and work in your days the work which she shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you amen and it says that of course they went out from that Sabbath day to the next and so forth and then they found that there was a lot of people that began to follow after the next Sabbath day they came almost the whole congregate Old City together to hear the word of the Lord but the Jews when they saw the multitude they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken of by Paul contradicting and blasphemy amen how many of those the testimony Paul gave they had to either choose whether they would believe it or they would not believe it amen see belief doesn't always come as easy as what we think I'm going to read another scriptures before we bring this up into our time do you realize this morning that in Matthew 28 and 5 through 8 it says and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here he is risen as he said come come to the place where the Lord laid and go quickly and tell his disciples didn't Brothers preach many places go tell go tell my disciples that he's not dead but he's risen mine from the dead and behold he goes before you into Galilee and ye shall and he shall see him low I have told you and depart departed from the and then he put it quickly from the Sepulcher for the fear of great joy and did run to bring his disciples word hello I mean we always heard about people Peter running isn't that right but here are the first people that ever ran to give testimony of the Resurrection was a couple of women Seven Devils it'd be like taking a couple of our sisters I thought about doing have them going without him have him come running in here to me and say no hey brother Jesus is this prison Jesus is risen I'm like oh I don't believe you as the Bible says they didn't believe it huh go tell my disciples that he is risen the other account of it is found in Saint John during verse seven but go your ways tell his disciples Peter that he goes before you into Galilee and and there shall you see him as he said unto you and they went out quickly and fled from the Sepulcher for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything among to any men for they were afraid Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared for Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils and she went and told them that had been with him as he mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and that had been seen of her believe not after that he appeared in another form I to two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it to the residue neither believe they them huh oh I try to get to people's mindset it's always easy to believe Jesus of the past but to believe what Jesus is doing and right in front of you that's a lot of times the hard part amen Lord she appeared on 11 as they sat at meat and abraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen amen now notice here he abraided them for their unbelief then he said go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in his mouth that shall be saved he that believeth not shall be them and he shot and shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues and if they take up serpents and if they drink anything it shall not hurt them and if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen you know sometimes you're not you don't talk about in in John I believe it was in John the first chapter uh uh hold on a minute nope it's the same it's right across the page there Luke the first chapter he says you know even as they delivered them unto us delivered what to us let me read the first verse for as much as many this is the first verse of chapter uh one of Luke for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed Among Us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word in other words they were eyewitnesses they were a witness so they could testify this is what we saw but how many knows Even in our generation we never saw the mighty works that God did sometimes you don't see so where there's the power come if you're not a witness you didn't see this is the Thomas effect that I wanted to talk to you about because remember Thomas was the kind of one I've got to be an eyewitness I've got to put my hand in this side I've got the touches tomorrow Mrs hamster I won't believe in other words he wanted to really be a wet this but Jesus said Thomas you know it is greater to have not seen and believe how many believe we ain't seen but we believe anyway how many believes that we love we want to see a church of a book of Acts and so forth don't we man we see we'll see God in the mighty way now let's bring it up for another 15 minutes maybe into our day would that be okay you know because Paul there was talking and testifying of what Christ had done in his hour amen now notice brother bam says it this way now on these type of testimonies he says God who is my judge would know this and I say this if I'm exaggerating God forgive me he don't never try to do that I believe that I can stand here if it was possible possible enough and for the next 500 hours gift testimony of things that I know that our Lord has done and it wouldn't even cover it of things of the thousands of volumes of books wouldn't put it into detail of what God but Jesus has done in our day how many knows that even brother Brown says science has to testify to God even science remember they took the picture of that cloud amen they didn't know what it was even the philosopher Francis acknowledge it's God he makes him acknowledge the testimony of almighty God brought it into a few they've got to testify that it is oh my again another quote I wish I could testify a little bit now of the things that I've seen happen amen I thought about him give me a minute I'll take some of my sermon this morning I'll testify to the people amen you said you know that you can believe it or you don't have to believe it but God is my judge and I'll be able to give a record on the day of judgment but when I went beyond the curtain of time those people were real he was over there somebody said I believe that I believe that when that bull came after him been a serpent biting him like Paul did amen but to still had power over nature we've had a book of Acts Road Again you could tell that ball to go back and lay down you might make fun of it you might make fun of him having and seen horses in heaven he's his horse in heaven remember that critical preacher says brought a randomized your story and your vision was fine until you talked about your dog and your horse got all critical stuff let me tell you something it's in critical Spirits God don't have much for it God don't have much for critical spirits don't you ever let a critical spirit get on you amen it's the worst thing that can happen to you sit in the Pew and be critical of the of the servant of God [Music] I mean those is demon powers demon powers oh my God I don't wanna I don't want to wait till tonight to get my testimony I want to y'all give y'all plenty of time tonight amen but let me finish this is okay if I had a little bit of time to seeing what things that I had seen happen just the last few weeks oh I could test what I could testify like Lou said Luke said about Jesus and all the books he says there wouldn't be enough books in the world to write it just what I've seen in my own Ministry what I've seen him done notice what Jesus done in Brothers Ministry now what brother Brown did but what Jesus you always got will could realize it was Jesus what I seen him do just in my own Ministry he had more success in my Ministry than he did with his own when he was here he was only here for three and a half years Amen brother Brandon was here from I don't know how many 30 40 50 years that he preached went around the world oh boy give us another Kings another book where where are all of uh uh uh Jezebel and all her prophets came to Mount Carmel remember said let's see who's God is gone we had another one happen like that oh how many of those Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he come and did the very same things today he challenged the Buddha that seeks to change all of the religions of the world come over here and open these Blind Man's eyes I didn't see it but I believe it and I can have the effects I'll be believing it I believe one person said spoke against that pillar fire and died another one says I believe that and was healed just your attitude towards it amen I believe it anyway amen Hallelujah more success in my Ministry needed his own that's right and he said Spider-Man says that's not me here Glory Hallelujah more success in Jeffersonville that he did in Nazareth because they did not believe him because he thought they knew him oh preachers preachers preachers let the holy spirit will have to say to you on the day of judgment you just thought that brother Brandon was just another man to somebody else with a Ministry he was just a man he didn't have another Ministry but it was God's Ministry there was fire above any of theirs Jesus Christ would come down and he even challenged them brother since if you think you can do it come I'll step aside and you do you do this dang one would raise up because they know they aren't commissioned to do damn Angel didn't talk to them under under the tree and said you don't drink or smoke or defy your body I have my work for you to do I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I'm not ashamed of the testimony of the possum I'm not ashamed of the Hornets I'm not ashamed of the squirrel said that God told him to create and he created them we've had another biscuits and see just and so forth and even greater than the fixings of the Lord we've had another book of Acts we've had another woman Touch the Hem of His Garment and then when that Mexican woman there wasn't enough deacons to stop her amen with her dead baby she called under him and over him but got to the prophet got to Jesus that's what he got too I believe it don't you I believe every story that's wrote and I believe it was for me and it inspires me and it changes me gives you eternal life if you'll believe that one they'll give you life in a trillion years from now you'll still be and you'll be in a perfect state because you have believed his testimony you believe the testimony of Jesus Christ Hallelujah tell it to me again tell me again what God did in our day and he's the same yesterday today and forever he could have a Mount Column or Showdown with all of those religions of the world remember that was in India and Africa 500 000. can you imagine brother Glenn 500 000 people gathered together foreign and the next day there was such a healing that took place how many truckloads was it seven either seven or eleven semi-truck loads of cots and stretchers and wheelchairs the whole city was blockaded they didn't have no activities today we're just going to go down through the streets and we're going to think only believe only believe all things are possible why don't you take a day I mean why don't we take your day time it's just Center it to the Lord we'll take our vacation days well to make sure we have two weeks that we didn't take a day folks to go outside and just listen to tapes and reach Bible and pray and see if you don't come in here different than what you did the time before but they took a day and they just begin to go down through the whole city was just completely blocked in and so forth and they were going down there with all of those seeing all they believe they've been there I hope I get to meet each one that was saved through all of those meetings hey man then he come here to America we had another Showdown here in America didn't we the Holy Spirit warned prophet of God he says there's a trap set for you you're going to have a meeting you're going to invite you and so forth and I have a truck for you they're going to challenge you on the guarded serpent season so forth isn't that right amen and then uh and and then the brother banham he had a vision and so forth and told one of the members of the ones that was putting it all together he says I've seen you doing this one and that one that one isn't sitting at a table and talking about this and so forth he says you're not going to have that meeting you're not going to have the building that you're in oh yeah we give the down payment already we're gonna have it no you ain't unseen division there's gonna be a lady dressed like this over here a little dress over there like that and this person here down there and a minute they got up in that meeting and so forth and that better come up he said now y'all can do what you want but yesterday or last night or Des Moines whichever it was but a man told me that that person would be sitting there that person be sitting there and he already told me before we ever canceled or before the cancel and I said we would not have that building but we'd have this building brother comes brother Brown come up here says I understand y'all want to challenge me on this Saturday other I challenge anybody that wants to come bring your Bible up here by my right side come on up come on up prove me wrong quietest Bunch you ever saw he said he said smarter if I'm not wrong brother Joe he said smarter that's what I thought right Savannah smarter than I thought let me tell you something if I can do that through a man it was not the man it was Jesus Christ I'll give my all for that I'll give my all for that there's people commissions folks if you want to get on the internet and look at all the negative and the bad stuff you can actually almost ruin your faith by the junk and the mess that message preachers who have preach this message have turned away from the prophet and everything else they've looked for false they've looked for faults and some of them will point out that fault and this fault and that fault but abandon wasn't perfect but I'm gonna tell you something I'm not perfect either them guys are not perfect either oh this is just me worth five cents but I wonder if God didn't do it in such a way and allow those mistakes to be made just to knock them off just to knock them off because even our Prophet said that he will say stuff do the sad things to thin down the crowd because I want you to know I give my soul to the Lord Jesus Christ knowing that that was and while he was here they would have never done it because your father he had been here he said now you Brothers think I was wrong on this come here I think they'd be smart too they'd probably be smart enough to head on out oh they're listening this morning you're fools that's right you're a fool to do what you did to turn on God after claiming that you was a you know claiming that you believed the message amen that's very very unwise you love the Lord I believe the testimony of God I believe him all the way I believe God I believe God I believe God it shall be done even as he said trust and Obey look up and say oh I
