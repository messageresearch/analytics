========================================

in the psalms we're going to go to psalms 1 15. it's a little bit longer than the some of them but psalms 115 not unto us o lord not unto us but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake but our god is in the heavens he had done whatsoever he had pleased they have mouse but they speak not eyes have they but they see none they have hands but that they handle not feet have they but they walk not neither speak they through their throat o israel trust thou in the lord he is their help and their shield ye that fear the lord trust in the lord he is their help and their shield you'll bless them that fear the lord both small and great you're blessed of the lord which made heaven and earth dead praise not the lord neither any that go down unto silence but we will bless the lord for this time forth and forevermore praise the lord god bless you may be seated brother brian good morning brothers and sisters you know as we were reading that song they were talking about the house of israel and about aaron and uh the thing about aaron is that's the priesthood that was given to the children of israel so god's talking to the children of israel and he's talking to the house of aaron and he meant suspiciously mentioned as i was reading that but it says house of aaron trust in the lord he is their help and their shield so he's telling the priests that they need that they need to be prepared you know if you go back to uh the old testament the lord told the the aaron the levites they were supposed to put the word of the lord before the people because they couldn't read and write like we do and the only way they could know the word of god is through the priests as they were taught by the priest and it's a pretty solemn job that the children of aaron had with the children of israel and i was also thinking about talking about false gods but you know right now in the age that we live in the false gods that the world has and people have really aren't images you know physical images of a fault not to say that some don't you know if you but it's actually an idea they make their education a religion they make their ideas a religion so it doesn't have to be a physical thing they put everything that they have before believing the lord and uh if you turn with me to mark the first for the third chapter i was talking to them in the prayer room the the before i get started the offering for the principal amount was five hundred dollars and i went ahead and made that uh that uh principal payment on on friday and the way i have figured i'll have to reconcile once they send me the next payment in september uh that leaves the principal amount right now as of this morning 60 547 dollars and i was telling them back there when i make the next payment uh it'll readjust the the amount of interest i pay every month also so with the next payment we'll be down to uh after the 10th of september we will probably be down in the low 59 000 mark so we're slowly but surely getting it knocked off and um and after all all the all the said and done and uh from through the summer so far and there's two things i haven't that are going to happen here real soon for the church uh if i have enough if they're the church i remember change that if the church has enough money i usually do a summer fill for the for the fuel tank and then i do a prepaid if i have enough money and we'll see and then the other thing i have to do or the church has to do on the 30th of september is when the church insurance renews against and that's lately it's been around three thousand dollars for the year and that's liability plus uh you know that's liability plus regular insurance for the fire and damage in the church so it seems like a lot but it a lot of it is liability also and when we do the liability is for everything that goes on in the church and plus the two buildings that we have the fellowship hall and and the church so those are the two expensive things that we have coming to the church here and and it's not very far and if i don't think there's enough money in the general fund to do the to do a uh prepaid for the winter time then i'll just i'll usually just pay the insurance it just depends on where we're at as a church you have usually to september 30th to do that prepaid for the following year where you get a better rate with the propane which i don't even know what it is right now i hadn't bought any in a while but like i said if you have any questions don't be afraid to come up and ask me and i was just reading this morning i was also thinking coming up here i was thinking about what brother branham said one time he said you know he was talking about that that over-educated preacher if he'd have gone up the way he came down then he'd be a lot better off and i'm not trying to be funny i was just thinking about that myself this morning but i was uh reading in this uh in this spoken word book here this morning and i was thinking about what to say and uh this is from this is then jesus came i'd have to give you the year but not taking a lot of time it's the 11th page and i'll just he's talking about the woman that had the blood issue but i just want to read what and it's no different for the day that we live and you know people will laugh you to scorn if you tell them you believe god's word and you're going to put god's word before anything else they're just going to laugh you that's going they're going to make fun of you and if they don't laugh at you they'll wait until you walk away and then they'll make make a big scene but i'll just see what brother branham had to say here this morning this morning and then maybe some scriptures from here and it's about the 73rd quote it says he said whosoever will come and drink from the waters of life freely and that's really important it's open it's an open invitation this morning to every individual here those waters are free the waters of life they're free for you this morning now the enemy might try to put walls in your way but god is not putting any walls in your way this morning it's totally open for you this morning to reach out there in faith and he goes on to say don't listen to him for he's the devil and that look little woman got down where jesus was coming up and people rallying around on porn so forth and this is what i was thinking more about and there stood the priest all the great leaders of their her religion and they were making fun of him and say oh you're the one that heals the sick or you uh we've got plenty of sick and that's how that's how sick people really are when you say you're playing praying for somebody well they say well we've got loads of other sick people they'll always take something good and something wholesome and make something evil out of it and uh and that kind of spirit you really you have to get to a point in your life where you choose what kind of spirit you're going to be around and there stood the priest and all the great leaders in her religion and they were making fun of him saying you're the one who heals the sick oh well we've got plenty of sick let's see you heal him oh you're the one that raises the dead are you well we got a grave full of them there let's let's see you raise them and that's you know that's people making fun of what you believe and what god has done for you and he goes on he never he never even paid attention to them he just walked on he had one thing to do and that one thing that god showed him to do and nothing less nothing more and when christians get to that place where he'll lay aside and not listen to all the scandals and stuff that's said and all that's going on and have one motive and that is to do the will of god that god sent you to do there's nothing there'll be a different day in a different church and i was just thinking about that you know in the age that we live in there's so much that satan's trying to put in our is trying to put in our way to make us discouraged make you not look at the things you should be looking at but looking at other things and uh this is the first chapter if you come with me to the first chapter of the book of mark and i was also i i was you know i guess as you get older you start remembering the things from your youth form i don't i'm i'm only just about to be 63 i don't know if that's true or not but i was thinking this morning uh there where i where i went to church years ago um in lima ohio there was a brother out of london ohio his name was brother peterson he used to preach a lot and he used to talk all of it goes back to what i was just saying his major theme a lot of times is he would tell people you've got to use your gospel 44 and you would look and say what's the gospel 44 and basically that weapon that you have this morning that pistol that you have that will kill every devil that tries to come into your life this morning and that is uh if you go to luke 4 and 44 and 44 uh excuse me luke 4 4. basically it is where jesus has been taken up in in the mountain and he says that when he was hungry but jesus said man shall live by not bread alone but every word of god and that's where we're at this morning but you need to live by your weapon the thing that'll make you successful in the day that we live this morning is that before you put anything else in front of yourself that you're always going to put the word of god before you this morning if you put the word of god before you in any room whatever is going on in your life and be successful it'll push all those black thoughts away all those evil thoughts away and it'll make you successful i know i'm carrying on here but i'll read here this um starting at about the 31st verse and no i'm thirsty i'm losing my place here and even when the sun did the 32nd verse here at evening when the sun did say they brought on to him all that were diseased and them that were possessed with devils you know this word is just applicable for you this morning whatever your situation is this morning you know god you know we all believe jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so as you read of the word of god it's just as powerful for us today as it was for them in jesus's day and he goes i lost my pleasure and all the city was gathered together at the door and he healed many that were sick of diverse diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him and you know we could all have that powerful life this morning there's nothing to keep you from it and he goes i lost my place again and in the morning rising up i miss he healed many that were sick with divers diseases cast out many endeavors and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him and in the morning rising up a great while before the day he went out and departed onto a solitary place and there prayed and simon and they that were with him followed after him and when they had found him they said on them all men seek things he said let us go on to the next town that i may preach there also for therefore come and i was thinking you know christ gave us an example as individuals this morning and the exam he set that example for i'm not going to take a lot of time i know i say that a lot but you know you have an example this morning you have to actually you have multiple examples and a lot of times your enemy is going to want to make you look at that man or that woman that says there's something and aren't living what they're saying but you do have examples this morning your most important example is jesus christ in the word of god and then you have the message of the hour and its messenger so as as the troubles come to you in your life or whatever that situation is you have the examples to follow and the example i was just really struck me this morning is that the time you put into anything will make you successful whether it's business whether it's sports well it's the same being a christian more in a spiritual sense what you spend your time in spiritually is what you're going to be this morning and jesus spent his time he set that example for us that he started the day in prayer and he finished the day in prayer brother david amen praise the lord we're gonna have a testimony here before we get started in worship would that be all right amen you know i mean god sometimes god just does something special amen i believe in this case probably be a guardian angel or something so i certainly believe in guardian angels don't you brother tommy's going to come and give us a testimony this morning amen praise the lord appreciate brother tommy amen and the work that the lord is doing in his life and the zeal that he has for the lord amen yeah well the lord was exercising my faith wings a couple weeks back it was pretty crazy brother uh irving me and him was getting ready to hook up the bush hog and uh the jack wasn't on the bush hog it was stacked up on some six by sixes well i got on this side of the bush hog and had the pto shaft i'm like well because he was backing in he was coming in there and uh i scooted on this side and i went to pick up the the a-frame part of the tongue kind of pivots just a little bit because it raises up and down and uh as i got on that side it was like i had to get down and get another bite on it's hard for me not hand talking you know but uh as i went to pick up on it i realized how heavy it was so i picked up again a little bit and at about that time next time i know it was smashed on my foot i couldn't even see my foot and it was all across there and i'm yelling i mean it was just chaos i'm like go get the jack go get the jack i'm telling them i'm thanking the handyman and i'm looking way up there and the barns way up there and i'm in this awkward position like i said i can't hardly show you right now but i'm in this awkward position i can't i go to pick up on it and i ain't budging this thing you know and uh i'm young he's i mean it was crazy it's chaos and uh he grabbed this board there he grabbed the board and put it up under the a-frame of the thing nothing he was sitting there pulling on and he's like i heard him he's like i tweaked my back and i'm like oh my gosh i'm sitting there i'm like go get a jack he wouldn't go and get a jack and there was another two by four there it was about two foot long and by the time i put it up under there i had no bite and i had about just enough to get a handle on it and i said give all you got he did and i pulled and i slipped out and i laid over on my side i just laid there because i know my foot was smashing i mean you couldn't see my foot and he was right there saying it too i mean and i was like oh my gosh i'm thinking doctor bills i'm thinking i'm gonna be in a cash i broke both legs where i'm like thinking how long this is gonna take to heal i'm thinking all these crazy thoughts i'm just like you know oh my gosh man and i mean my foot is smashed to nothing and uh i looked down i could just see the top part of my boot caved in and i'm just laying there and i'm just like oh no and i just stood up and when i stood up i don't know why it's like god gave us peace over me and i just i don't like it i said paul shook off a serpent said any deadly thing wouldn't harm me and i believe god's a prison helping a time of need i was able to walk it off walked off we went went home went to my house and me and tammy she was she was tripping too and we got my boot off my foot was swelling and i was like i was like i was like well didn't say paul didn't have no bite marks you know and so i just kept on going and uh as i went back i went i was like i ain't gonna sit here all day i'm gonna go bush hogs so i'm going bush all right i was bush hogging i thought he had bought an eight foot bush hog and i'm looking at it i stop i'm sitting there i'm googling it because i'm like thinking how much is this thing wait man i got to looking it up and uh because you know all your mind's thinking all this stuff and i look up i'm not finding an eight foot bush hog for that number and then i'm like yeah i'm like i could get off here measure slam sure enough it was a ten and a half foot bush hog away twenty seven hundred and fourteen pounds and all that i mean whatever was not we can be safe to say probably two thousand pounds was on my foot and uh i'm like you know i said and it was like the lord was uh showing me as i was bushing i was just praising god you know and it was just a jubilee and i was like you look back and all that fear that was coming on my mind when i was laying there and then it was like in scripture too it came to my mind you know he's like you know fear not i only believe all things are possible and that he's very present helping the time nate and i just want to praise the lord for that man god is good isn't he i tell ya he's an awesome god and i was thinking this morning and y'all are fixing to laugh at me but that'll be okay i was thinking this morning about trevor and sister sarah came in and she said there's a prayer request for trevor said he goes to mayo's tuesday and what'd y'all say that thing was he drank now what yeah he took a drink of coke this morning he was able to swallow he hasn't been able to swallow in over a year so then brother jamie and then went to mcdonald's and got in this thing and he drank it this morning that's awesome that is awesome this morning and you know i and i thought you know we all go through trials and we go through tests and we have issues but he's still the same yesterday today and forever and you say well i talked to brother truman this morning about sister carol and and the 31st of august uh her that tumor is not doing like they want from the radiation she's been going for five weeks and uh the 31st they're gonna put her in the hospital and they're gonna put something in and they're going to put the radiation right on the tumor for three days and try to kill that tumor and we begin to talk about the goodness of god and the different ones that are sick and and you know we wonder why the test but we'll understand it better by and by and you know people laugh at us because they think you know you think you're going somewhere where there's no problems well i don't think i know we're going there this morning by his grace and his mercy this morning there is a land that we're longing for this morning there ain't no cancer there's no sugar diabetes there's no bad eyes and i told the brothers in the back when we prayed i said i'm kind of like an old car i get one part fixed and something else messes up but i said you know i'm thankful for his grace and his mercy and remember brian started sunday school this morning and he

certainly is good to us this morning and it's good to be in the house of the lord and i just want to give fair warning it's going to be a terrible day for the devil so uh today's message is for believers and i mean truly heartfelt believers so how many believers do we have here this morning amen a house full of believers so we're going to do a lot of stomping on the devil this morning and realizing who we are so i want to quote a quote as we get started this morning and just to kind of put us in perspective where we're going probably said my grandfather wrote an ox cart i'm driving a ford v8 and my son will fly a jet plane that's where we're moving on he said that's what religion ought to be the coming of the lord is at hand how many believe that this morning the coming of the lord is at hand he says the church ought to be moving on into their powers science can can climb so far but then it has to drop off but we've got untapped sources listen to this that has never been touched that has never been touched the power unlimited of god that we ought to be moving into you believe that but listen to what he says next he said but we're living a million miles under privileges tonight under of the privileges that christians ought to be enjoying he said and i feel ashamed of myself to look out here and see institutions and the sicknesses and troubles that's going on right now he says our church listen now our church he's speaking to us he's speaking to believers he's speaking to the people that that are living in this last day this last age that are following the last age message he says listen our church ought to be walking the street healing the sick raising the dead casting out devils doing signs and wonders don't you get tired on me now just because i'm talking about things we're supposed to be doing and not doing don't you get tired on me we're supposed to be raising the dead casting out devils doing signs and wonders making the whole world realize that christ jesus lives that's what we ought to be doing he says turn with me to the book of jeremiah jeremiah chapter one god is sure good to us jeremiah chapter one i've got to get my glasses for this i'm reading now my bible here has came to me on the way to church two minutes time from my house to here the lord gave me this to read so chapter one of jeremiah and verse four we'll read in the word of the lord say amen if you're there i want you to see this for yourself this morning then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou cometh forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations then said i allah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a child but the lord said unto me say not i am a child for thou shalt go into all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thee thou shall speak be not afraid watch now we live in a world a wicked world a wicked world that is against us and we talk about this a lot but it's becoming reality more and more every day we live in a wicked world but he says be not afraid of their faces for what does this say i am i am i am with thee to deliver thee saith the lord now i want you to notice that i am we're going to talk about that i am then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my words my words in thy mouth god right here talking to the prophet jeremiah pouring himself into the prophet saying i'm gonna touch your mouth your lips will no longer be your lips your words will now be my words i put my words into thy mouth see i have this day set thee over nations over kingdoms to root out to pull down and to destroy and to throw down and build and to plant god is awesome let's pray heavenly father we come before you this morning with grateful hearts lord and thankful to be in your house and we feel such a sweet presence such a a powerful presence amongst us this morning and and lord we we we felt that for the last few days lord as we prepared for this message and and lord it's just been a special special feeling and lord we just ask that you would continue to come down amongst your people this morning that you would come down into the congregation and go from isle to isle and and person to person lord and as you will speak and deal personally with each person there so that they can find their identity in you lord so that we can see what you would have in store for us and may you come down this day lord jesus and touch our lips touch our mouth lord and take away our words take away our thoughts take away our wants and our desires and fill our vessels with you this morning lord jesus that we would speak what you would have us to speak that we would do what you would have us to do we want to tell you we love you i appreciate you lord we just ask that you've been the remainder of this service and may all glory be given to you in jesus name amen amen you can have your seats turn with me to the book of acts if you would for just one minute i want to read one more portion of scripture i'm going to try not to to hold you along i'll warn you i'm in uncharted territory again this morning i i i i usually print my stuff on font 14. i can't see it no more we was talking about our vision back there and every one of us back there can't see no more so i had to blow it up and so i've got more pages so i hope we'll stay within our time frame brother jeff but acts chapter 2 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues as a fire and sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so here we are on the day of pentecost the group of people are gathered together and they're they're kind of mourning they're kind of you know and trying to figure out what direction they're going to go but they're praying out they're seeking they're trying to get the movement of god and all of a sudden the spirit comes down upon them and people from all nationalities all different places and races that are there together and talk about what's going to happen now they're all speaking one language and the people look at them and it confuses the people in verse 12 it says they were amazed and they doubted and saying what does this mean what does this mean and they mocked them and said these guys are drunk now peter knowing what was going on peter being a man of god could feel the anointing that he once felt the days that he walked with jesus the same anointing that same presence that we're talking about peter reckon i said no no no no these men are not drunk they're not full of new wine this is only the third hour a day we've been drinking people but there is something amongst us that we can't explain right at this point it's a presence of jesus christ the man of galilee and we feel that presence and this is the way we're acting it's told just as the prophet joel and he said it shall come to pass in the last days that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams my message to us this morning is acts the sequel are you with me acts the sequel and as i talk about acts the sequel i want to talk a little bit about a pentecostal experience and don't get scared i'm talking about a pentecostal experience i'm talking about more than just the pentecostal experience that we've we've heard about and we've seen about in the in in the last 50 years 50 60 70 years ago when the move went through and and the tongues went forth and then the pentecostals began to put a a movement around it that said if you don't speak in tongues you don't have the holy ghost if you don't shout if you don't have the holy ghost if you don't come to the altar and and get your back beat on to you till you do something you don't have the holy that's not what i'm talking about that is all part of it don't get me wrong that is all a genuine portion of the holy ghost but what i'm talking about is a portion of pentecost that says we as believers can say silver and gold have i none but what i have i give a thief that's the pentecostal experience i'm talking about i'm talking about a life of christ that dwells in us that makes us more than just talking in tongues now don't get me wrong i love the presence when you get into a place and it's quiet and i experienced this some maybe three three two three years ago first time i ever experienced but what an experience it was when i found myself locked away into a private place first time i've ever shared this but found myself locked away in a private place and i began to pray the lord i said lord i want to feel your presence i don't want to talk to you i want to feel your presence and i laid there in the bed and i was praying and praying and praying and i felt such a peace and a calm come over me and it was a feeling like i've never felt before and i was just praying and praying and before i knew it i was praying in some kind of gibberish i've never heard in my life and i couldn't stop and i prayed and i prayed and it just kept going and it was like there was a communication but i i it was just it was different that is a true cause to experience but i want more i want more than what that is many of you know and can relate to good movies or books they're hard to come by and so when you find a good movie or a good book and we begin to all get wrapped up into the story line and the characters of this movie or a book or whatever it is you're you're wrapped up in and the producers a lot of times they and the authors they look at these movies and these books and they have a way of captivating their audiences and they draw you in they suck you into the plot they suck you into to the characters to where you're you're really enthralled and you're beginning to read and you're looking and you just got to know what's going to happen next and you begin to watch this and many times you you get to the point in the movie or the book and you you think man this is this is fixing to be the climax the plot of this whole thing is fixing to be unveiled and what's it do it leaves you hanging it leaves you hanging to a place and you begin to look at you say the movie's ending but i know it's not over it's ending but i know it's not over you know there's more to the story and it's just beginning to get good and it can't end like this and what happens before you know it there's another movie there's another book and that's what's called the sequel so when you look at what a sequel is it's a publisher broadcaster recorded work that continues a story or it develops a theme from an earlier story and it's something that takes place after or a result of an earlier event brother sisters that's what i'm talking about as christians in the life of christians today we have to be building up on the acts of our forefathers we have to be building upon the acts of our forefathers in the bible because when jesus went through the agony of the garden of gethsemane when he was tortured and beaten and hung up on the cross to die it was for your salvation sure it was for your salvation and we're so thankful for that salvation that everlasting life but i want you to know this morning that it was for more than just your salvation it was so that you can live with the benefits of the holy ghost have you ever thought about the benefits of the holy ghost when somebody dies there's a benefactor when i die what little of god or insurance money or whatever we have is going to go to the benefactor my wife when jesus died it was salvation but it was so much more than salvation it was power and authority it was deliverance and healing it was so that you can overcome the wickedness of this world that's what the benefactor was of the holy ghost jesus said in john 16 7 nevertheless i tell you the truth that it's expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you brother sisters in the bible the word comforter relates to the holy spirit and this comforter was to come and do the very same works that the one who left it did put yourself there and think about jesus and think about this as we look at this as because jesus said if i don't go you can't have me and all along we've always thought in our minds and this has become a real hard reality to me that we need the cross of calvary for salvation and that is true but jesus says it's so much more than that because if i don't leave you can't have me i can't come back there's nobody for me to give myself to because it's christ in spirit he says i came from god i go to god a little while the world sees me no more that's the people that's the people of this world a little while i go and they see with me no more and the prophet said that's the worldly order he said yet you see me that's the church you see me i see him you see him because why we're the bride we're the church of jesus christ you see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world the works that i do are you with me you shall do why is it we're afraid of the works come on church why are we afraid of the works i i you know i i'm talking about the silver and gold experiences why is it we're afraid of seeing god in action why is it we're afraid of seeing god in action when god could go and open blinded eyes he could unplug deaf ears he could look at it and say cancer be gone he could look at any kind of sickness nothing stood in his way he could calm the raging seas these are the things that our god did and greater greater than that shall you do but we begin to sit back and we begin to balk and we begin to think oh no i just don't know if if i if if that's for me but let me tell you it's time for the message to prove to the world what god does through his people it's a proven time the devil proves what he is let me tell you about it i had to go home or had to go to eastern to get western on friday he had to come pick up an airplane to take back the eastern for a test pray for him he's got a big exam tomorrow and uh but but he he was telling me about his first week on the college campus said dad eastern's different any college there is i said what do you mean he said it's just different he said the people i said son that's everywhere he said no i don't know he said there's men you know hey men his age at 19 20 24. he said they dressed in halter tops got their belly button pierced wearing cowboy boots up to here snake skin cowboy boots and shorty shorts built like a linebacker we laugh we laugh but the truth is that's a reality they're proven satan has proven who he is and many times we we're bashful christians find ourselves bashful we get ourselves many times in a corner and we kind of sit back and we just watch things happen around us we don't really get in there and say no no no this is not the way it's supposed to be you shouldn't be wearing that because this is not a pleasing to the god that we serve in america he's still our god of america and we sit back and we look at these things and we just kind of look back in awe but it's time for us to prove because if we're not careful will be what brother branham called a moralist a moralist what is a moralist you say he said let me give you a beautiful picture of it he said we would think today that it's a man that thinks he's going to heaven just because he quit gambling a morse is a man that thinks he's going to heaven just because he quit running around with women on his wife he said a moralist is a man who thinks he's going to heaven just because he stopped drinking he said a moralist is a person who on new year's day turned over a new leaf and they joined the church he said but you see he's really not converted that person is really not converted why does he say that because his life is not producing any other fruits and going to church uh-oh [Music] he said you see he isn't really converted because he's a moralist he said and the devil is using moralists do y'all want me to stop [Applause] he says the devil is using moralist he said to make a foolish representation he said when really the real power of the living christ isn't there brothers and sisters that'll make us examine ourselves the morning and say where do i stand when i come in and sit in a pew is church just about being here on sunday morning church just about showing up to say hallelujah when the songs are saying or do i have the fruits of christ produced through me on a day-to-day basis am i the one going out here and people say man that man's got power i'm talking about power god given power and authority somebody asked me here no longer said why don't we see some of the things around us that other churches do where are we standing the only thing hindering god for moving is his people are we where we're supposed to be are we dedicated the way we're supposed to be dedicated because i'm afraid brothers and sisters around the masses there's a lot of people who've just become that moralist attitude they they've been around this message so long they're content to just be christians they're content just coming to church i've done my duty i've done my part i paid my tithes i give my offering they're content that jesus is their savior on calvary stay with me i'm not downplaying that don't think i'm downplaying that because it's the most important thing that's ever happened in your life is your salvation but there's more and people become to get content they think well i had to cut my hair in 25 years i don't wear clothes i don't drink i don't smoke i don't wear the clothes i used to i don't cuss i don't i've cleaned out my closet i don't do those things i listen to message tape every day i read a message book and we call them believers don't we they do all those things and we call them believers i want to see believers in action god is looking for believers in action i'm sorry for being so hard this morning but i'm here to tell you that the messenger of this hour he come to bring you more than just mediocracy he come to bring you more than just not cutting your hair not not wearing makeup but you're wearing a dress and he come to bring you more that and god expects more from you than that the message of the hour is more than just being a good man there's a lot of good men out here there's a lot of good women i know a million of them but can they demonstrate the power and authority of the holy ghost you see the bride is special the bride is special what our scripture say when we first started i knew you before you were formed in the womb i chose you brothers and sisters i want to be all that god wants me to be i want to be more than than just a mediocre christian and if we're not living under the power and authority of the holy ghost i feel like we're diminishing and we're downplaying the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ we're downplaying it because we're saying he's good enough to die for my sins but i'm not good enough to perform the acts he did when the scripture says we should turn with me to john 15. yo when you say statements like that you've got to prove it so john 15 we're going to prove we're on proving grounds john 15 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away see how important it is that we bear fruit and the first statement there if you're not bearing fruit you're gathered you're gathered together with the things that are dead what the prophets say about our denominational churches they're dead [Applause] if you're not bearing fruit you're going to be gathered up he says and ever and it says in every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it and make it bring forth more fruit oh boy that's good that ought to make us get up run around and shout and have a little pentecostal experience right there that the more you do for god he'll prune you and make you grow a little bigger a little better a little stronger a little more authority he'll give you a little more confidence now ye are clinging through the word which i've spoken abide in me notice abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i and him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing you see when i talk about power and authority i'm not talking about something that you or i manufacture i'm talking about something that's poured out and given to us through the holy ghost a life that's lived with the holy ghost if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and get them gathered and cast into a fire and they're burned if you abide in me my words abide in you you shall ask what ye will and it shall be done authority herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit if you want to glorify god don't just come into the church and praise and and worship just when it's when it's sunday morning in worship time don't just that's not what we're talking about glorifying god but he says if you want to glorify god bear much fruit do things that god done as the father has loved me that's all i loved you continuing my love i want to skip on down here we came to verse 15. henceforth i call you not servants you're no longer a slave you're not a slave to jesus he says no for the servant knoweth not what he what his lord doeth but i have called you friend there's no greater friend than the lovely jesus i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you so this is not something new what god is trying to do in this last hour in this last day is nothing new to us he's made it known to us that's why we have a messenger in this hour and so many times we downplay that and take it for granted we know things that baffles scholars listen to 16. you have not chosen me but i have chosen you listen to the next part real important and ordained you or that word ordained means he's decreed holy orders upon you he's given you a decree god says i've ordained you i chose you i picked you i've chosen you and i've ordained you that with this holy order you should go and bring forth fruit you shall go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit shall remain god's fruit don't rot god's fruit stays plush and it stays healthy and it's a good god-given uh uh fruit that goes out in it and nourishes people and it nurtures people it's a healthy fruit and he said that you you that my fruit that your fruit shall remain that whatsoever you shall ask in my father's name we live below whatever you ask in my father's name he we may give it to you brothers and sisters that's christ granting the power and authority to have and it's so freely given but yet we don't use it what good does it do if we just set it on a shelf if there's a need for a healing and i set it on this shelf and i watch those around me that are suffering what good does it do me to leave the holy spirit of healing on that shelf remember silver and gold have a knot i might not be able to pay you medical bills i might not be able to send you to the best doctors but if i've got the spirit of god and i've got healing on this shelf i'll give it to you i'll give it to you are you with me well i know you say well jesus said that but i feel like it's just for another day i feel like it was just for the apostles sometimes i just don't feel it brother sister that's why we don't go on feelings that's why we don't go on feelings because feelings will confuse you because satan works in that realm when god looks at you and say go lay your hands on that person and satan says you can't do it don't tell me it's never happened to you because it has something tells you go witness to this person i can't do it i don't know the word that's what satan tells you you know more than you think you know it's better to obey and just let god take control that's the best thing you can do that's the best sermon that's ever preached if you'll just obey god listen to god and do what he tells you to do and just let him take control you ask any preacher they can study they can study they can put it all together but the best messages they'll ever preach and the ones they feel are more effective than any is when they get out of the way they step aside from their notes and they just say what god says it's when god begins to minister yes he lays thoughts on our mind he thoughts in our hearts but i love it when we branch and deviate from our nodes because that means somebody's pulling somebody's needing something from god somebody this morning needs more power somebody this morning needs to know the authority that they have laying inside of them and to grasp the reality of that that authority we can't go on feelings you say i just can't do it i'm going to tell you satan's lie to you enough because the word says you were built for this day do you realize that you look at this this portrait on the wall right here this is church age after church age after church age after church age after church age the world's been in existence we know for more than 2000 years right why didn't god choose you to walk on the road of a mess wasn't for you why didn't god choose you to go through the dark ages was it for you god said i need a bride in the last day that will be authority and power and take my word and show the world that i am alive that's what you were built for the prophet said the world is wanting to see jesus the world is wanting to see jesus and jesus said i am the vine you are the branches and the branch bears record of the vine because it draws the energy and the life from that vine it's nothing we produce it's nothing we manufacture you have to understand a little bit about the way grapes and vines are grown you have a vine that comes up you got roots and the vine comes up and then that vine will put out little leaders little branches off the sides that branch is no good if the main vine is no good you let some rot get involved into that vine that branch will begin to die you'll never have a one ounce of fruit but as long as that vine lives let me tell you god's alive and as long as that vine lives and we are the branches and we begin to to pull and saturate ourselves with the nutrients and the wisdom and the knowledge and the power that comes up out of that vine these branches said it here will have to bear fruit the fruit hangs off the branches he said listen now if he said because it draws energy and life from the vine he said well the first vine the first branch that came from this they wrote a book of acts behind that branch he's talking about peter and john all the apostles and the disciples that was left behind and was there on the day of pentecost he's talking about the ones that go out there and said silver and gold have i not but what i have i give thee that's who he's talking about that was that first book of acts behind that branch he said and we see the way the holy spirit acted in that first church the church of pentecost he said we believe that if the original vine ever puts forth another branch you know what it's going to do he said it'll write another book of acts behind it because it's the same life coming from the same vine god don't change and he says and if that first branch put forth a bunch of grapes we're going to have a bunch of grapes he said but if you find it's got watermelons growing or pumpkins or cucumber you know that that is not the true vine that's the false vine i want to remind you this continuation of god this continuation of god in action we send in the old testament to the new testament to testament to matthew mark luke and john and we go over and write the backs did god ever change from them till now remember what i told you when we talk about jeremiah and god said i am he said i'm going to speak and i am in the book of exodus chapter 3 we got moses god has come down and began to speak to moses now and he says moses you're going to go and you're going to deliver my people you're going to go down there and i've heard my people's cry and i whether you like it or not moses i picked you i can't do it lord moses you're built for it are you with me how am i going to do this lord how am i going to do this who am i that's what we all have to ask ourselves who am i i'm nothing that's what the word said we're nothing without god and moses says he realized that who am i i'm nobody god that i should go down to pharaoh and i can't bring those children out of egypt and god said certainly i love the way it's written certainly i will be with thee for i have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of egypt you will serve god on this mountain and moses listen to all this he begins to look and he says when all this happens and and you say to me and they come and ask me who sent you down here to get us moses who do i tell them who am i going to tell them that you are he said tell them that i am that i am and he said thou shalt say unto the children of israel i am have sent me unto you the same i am that spoke to the prophet jeremiah the same i am that says i am greater in you than you are in the world the same i am john 6 jesus feeds over 5 000 people and right after that miracle he tells them i am the bread of life i am the bread of life and he who shall comes to me shall never hunger and they will never thirst i am jesus his disciples are at the temple and they're celebrating a festival of lights and jesus comes in there and and jesus announced i am the light of the world who is this i am it's god it's god in us it's god and his people it's god in jeremiah it's god and moses it's god in jesus and it's god in you and i i am the light of the world and he who follows me shall never walk in darkness they're looking out over the hills the shepherd are heard in the sheep and jesus says i'm the gate i'm the gate for the sheep and whoever enters through me will be saved he will come in and i and go out and find pasture i am jesus goes on to say i am the good shepherd i am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep you want more when jesus comes up to the tomb of lazarus mary and martha crying where have you been god why didn't he show up if you would have just been here if you would just come my brother would still be alive and he sits there and he looks at the situation lazarus dead and he declared i am the resurrection and the life i am and he who believes in me will live at the last upper jesus warns his apostles about the coming of rest and the death and he's trying to tell them hey things are fixing to get a little bit tricky around here better have your head on straight brothers because things are fixing change and he begins to tell them and they just can't understand it and thomas says we don't know where you're going jesus we don't know where you're going how how can we possibly know that way that you're talking about you're trying to tell us some way to go but how do we know and jesus looks at this opportunity he says i am the way i am the truth and i am the life i am you say well how does this apply to us what in these everyday events he went to lunch fed some people went to a funeral leading a group of people at work i am i am jesus says his last recorded i am statement after the last supper these men were no doubt probably walking around the upper room and after they just got done eating and it was the last supper there and they're walking around and they go down into the garden where jesus would later be arrested and during that walk they're walking down through there and here is a prominent symbol and over into the going into the into the entrance of the temple they had a golden wire that was threaded golden wire had beef hanging off of it golden beets and it was to symbolize a golden grapevine and jesus then takes this opportunity to sit there he points to that golden grapevine and he says i am the true vine jesus is usually something they're familiar with grapes was something that's still to this day is is grown prominently into in that land over there grapes grow easy over there grapes grow healthy they make wine some of the best wines uh that connoisseurs look for in the world come from right there in that region where jesus was and he looks up over the temple and points to those golden beads and says i am the true vine i am the true vine these grapes these grapevines are used as three types of symbols it represents past and present and future so do you see some kind of a correlation there that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and as we look at this the past vine notice what happens here the path that's a little history for you the past vine symbolizes israel as a choice vine you know israel was god's people they were his own flesh and blood so to speak and so the israel they were important to him but what did that vine constantly do that vine constantly disappointed the vine dresser they couldn't be obedient they couldn't abide they couldn't stay in the word they deviated here and there and so it says that they were wild grapes have you ever tried a wild grape they will lock your jaws sour bitter they'll make you pucker up worse than persimmon wild grapes then the future vines symbolize the last days on earth ripe for god's judgment and wrath where you think we're at we're in these last days where it symbolizes the wrath of god is upon us this land cannot continue to disappoint and god not do something about it somebody said something to me the other day and i just remember how i responded to it i don't really remember what we were talking about forgive me for that but they were talking about i do know what we're talking about we were talking about uh what is normal can anybody give me a definition of normal in this day we're living in think about the college situation i just told you is anybody anything what is normal we'd like to look around and say we're normal but she was talking about she said you know the colleges set kids up to try to pull them in they better be strong when they go is what she was trying to say they better be strong when they go because the colleges are setting them up to go into this abnormal mind and state and draw them in to pull them into that that little circle and she said she said something about how how it must affect god and i said you know how it must hurt god's heart and when i said that i thought about what i said it's one of those things i said it came out really before i thought about it but then when i said it i thought how true it is that god did so much for the world he gave his only begotten son he gives us benefit after benefit after benefit and all we have to do is come to him and accept him and people turn faster than a jet engine from him and i thought how that must hurt his heart as he looks over the banister of time and says what is this what is this it's ready for judgment and the present vine on that representation is the lord jesus christ jesus said i am the vine you're the branches and if a man abides in me and on him he will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing so an important thing we need to look at here if we look at this vine and where this teaching goes is the word abide because the word abide was used 11 times in 11 verses it's a pretty important word and so what it's trying to tell us is if we abide with jesus the branch abiding with the vine we're together we're growing we're fruitful but if you do not abide with the vine you're gonna die you take a branch on a tree they've done some work behind my house and one of the my favorite trees it's a little little white oak tree and it's just a little bushy pretty little thing and they took the track hole around and swung around and hit two branches you think they got green leaves on them today brother jeff no i got to get my pruning saw out and cut them off because they will never be green again because they don't abide anymore into the trunk where the life given material comes from and jesus said if you abide in me and i in you you're going to be fruitful you're going to put out a lot of fruit so i mean studying meditating on the word getting in god's word abiding in christ reading studying spending time praying focusing on god drawn from that life we're told to abide because it's something we can do or not do like i said jesus said you're not servants you're not slaves you can abide in me are you going to choose to not abide in me but the word clearly tells us that if you're unfruitful if you're not a biden that branch is going to be taken away like i said about the tree i'm going to cut it off because it'll never bear fruit again it'll never put out an acre and it'll never put out another leaf and if you're not abiding in christ you may come to church you may go to meetings you may sing specials i'm not don't think i'm pointing fingers that anybody does those things i'm making an example but if you're not putting out fruit jesus jesus is fruit that is an example of the life he lived did you ever think of a point or a place where jesus sang specials did you ever think of a place where jesus sat down and played the guitar i can't recall it we need those things i love those things it's part of our worship it's part of who we are as christians to be able to worship and praise but jesus is looking for fruits clusters of grapes if we don't abide in christ the consequences are what we would say is terrible if you're not abiding in christ if you if you want to see your world fall apart just stop abiding in christ if you want to see your marriage on the rocks quit coming to church if you want to see your children go the ways of the world quit bringing them to church if you want to see your uh your job and your career go to the pits quit going to church because i tell you i don't know where i would be without god i was thinking just here the other day and i was sitting there thinking uh how i'm 46 years old and i've been through what i think would be some some rough times in my life maybe it's not rough in yours but i've been in as times we've been in financial distress and we didn't know where in the world was going to get money there's been times when i when i didn't know about my job i didn't know what what i was going to be doing there's been times when when maybe we had a little squabble and we just wonder what in the world are we doing here as a couple well i'm glad somebody's been there but i thought i was thinking like laying there thinking and all my 46 years i could not think of one time that god didn't bring me through it it's nothing i manufactured but i was just living for christ in my darkest times when i didn't know where church was going to take me i still live for god i never lost my love for god and i thank him for that my family never lost their love or god we didn't know we're up from down as far as where we were going or what we were supposed to do but god never left us [Music] the fruit comes from abiding abiding in god obeying in god obeying god and connecting with christ vines and branches they have to connect they have to stay together and god says you're not a slave you're a friend and when we talk about a friendship what is a friendship a friendship is pers personal a friendship reciprocates he gives you the option to abide and obey right and he wants that to be reciprocating he wants it to come back and forth and back and forth because god only shares his plans with his friends i don't even have to say nothing you know what i'm talking about god shares his plan with those he loves the most those he pulls up into his bosom and says abide with me my love you know a person who abides finds it easier to obey and a person who is obedient is more comfortable abiding think about that but if you want a conflict in your life just begin to disobey god and you'll find you're not comfortable abiding anymore and god's not a comfortable comfortable with you trying to come to him when you're not obedient to his word let me tell you brothers and sisters you want you want your life to change quit abiding in god quit obeying god and see if he don't turn the spigot off oh you may cruise along for a while but eventually it's going to catch up with you let me tell you god and abiding in god and serving god and praying to god and being full of power and authority that god has given us is more important than any job you'll ever have oh we like money sure we do money buys us nice things money buys us nice clothes and cars and houses but if you've got that money and you're not abiding in christ it's gonna burn you want to find the person brothers and sisters that's the happiest person on the face of the earth find the one who's abiding and obeying and you'll find a person that's filled with joy and love and peace and gentleness and meekness you'll find somebody that's living every bit of this statue of a perfect man you say well we can't do it yes we can because you're called to do it you're built to do it don't tell me you can't do it because god says you can well i'm just down here at the very bottom i don't have enough faith to start my car in the mornings i have to put it on jumper cables you're not built for that quit talking such nonsense stand on the word of god and where it says greater is he that is in me say it with me than he that is in the world i want to read one more scripture if we could kind of lengthy if we could mark 16 because mark 16 is often overlooked but mark 16 is the foundation when you talk about the book of acts you talk about the book of revelations mark plays a very important part it says and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the other mother the mother of james and salome had brought sweet spices that they may come to anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun and they said amongst themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it would be great and entering into the sepulcher they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed and a long white garment and they were frightened one of the other one of the others i don't know which one i'd have to look it up but one of the others says it when they come there the stone was rolled away and there was an angel sitting on that stone and it rested on that stone and when i thought about that i thought you know there's something special about when satan tries to push stuff into your life and he tries to bind you and hold you down with the weight of the world and hold the stone against you where you can't get out there's something special that says god can move that stone out of the way and you can rest on it entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sit on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were frightened and he said unto them be not a frightened you seek jesus of neither as nazareth which was crucified and has risen he's not here he's not here one place that says why do you seek the dead amongst the living why are you seeking these why are you seeking he's not here why are you sick and living among the dead i'm sorry check me see but go and tell your disciples and peter that he goes before you into galilee there you shall see him and he said and as he said unto you they went out quickly and fled from the sepulcher they trembled and was amazed and they said any said they anything to any man and they were afraid and when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first in mary magdalene whom he had cast out seven devils and when she had went and told him that that he that he had been that been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive had been seen of her believe not somebody's not abiding in jesus because he told them i'm fixing to go away from here because if i don't the comforter cannot come i'm fixing to leave this place and and you're going to come looking for me in three days i'm going to raise up and they're still looking for him and after he appeared in another form into two of them as they walked and went into the country they went and told him to the unto the residue neither the neighbor neither believed they them afterward he appeared unto the heaven as they said it meet and upbraided him with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned what does he say next and these signs shall follow them that believe you say i can't do it in my name in jesus name they shall cast out devils in jesus name they shall speak with new tongues in jesus name they shall take up serpents in jesus name they shall drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's in jesus name so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and said on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs signs i said well it's going to be a terror terrible day for the devil let me tell you what i have come to the conclusion and what i have i've learned to find joy and i've learned to find pleasure and i have learned to find peace in putting the devil in his place the older i get the bolder i get i don't know if it goes with everybody i'm sure it does that preaches but i'm just an anxious person okay i'm not i'm not claiming anything i'm not confessing but my spirit my nature isn't that anxious and i begin to dwell and think and try to put things pieces together and and we got you know in my life right now we got this going on and that going on and weston going to school and we're worried about working on this work and it's just constantly just back and forth back and forth and the devil was just beating me up and said you're never going to accomplish any of this you don't have time you're not going to be able to accomplish any of this you're not going to pull any of this off and so what does that do when you start listening to that it starts giving you that feeling of oh no oh no what are we going to do and then that turns into a little bit of fear has anybody ever been there and it turns into a little bit of fear and then you begin to think about it you begin to panic and i was driving down the road and i could just feel that nervous tension in my body and my back and i was just driving down the road and finally it just dawned on me and i just spoke out loud and i said devil let me tell you something i've listened to you oh i'm going to listen to you i spoke out loud to him because i'm not playing with him anymore i said i'll listen to you all i'm going to listen to you because the word says greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and my god is a deliverer my god is a provider my god is a healer my god will give me this my god delivers when he says he will i don't care what you say devil you're a liar and go back to the pits of hell where you came from [Applause] i felt good i felt as good then as i do right now i'm about ready to jump off this stage right now because the presence of god is in this place with power and authority if you want it it's here for you tell him out loud you don't have to hide in the closet from me we don't hide from satan he's going to come after you let me tell you he's coming day after day after day i'm not hiding our pastor taught us wednesday night out of the book of revelations and i find it found it fitting that he would ask me to preach because this has been on my heart for some time and let me tell you how it works as god begins to show you things when you're when you're a preacher you begin to see things and you begin to have little thoughts and topics and you shot little notes down and brother bowler would preach something a couple weeks ago or so and i think man he's fixing to ask me i'm fixing to deliver nope the next preacher who preached somebody else would preach something i think it's got to come it's coming now it's got to be the next service nope lord i know you laying this on my heart for a reason he preaches out of revelations and i think oh boy when he opened up with revelations i thought maybe all those things you told me lord wasn't where i was supposed to be going because he asked me to preach and i knew which direction i was going but i hadn't finished all my thoughts yet let me back up god hadn't finished all my thoughts yet and he began to preach out of revelations and then as i looked at this and i thought about it and i thought the book of acts and the book of revelations and the book of mark 16 all of this dovetails for the believer and i knew it in my heart and i was trying to figure out how does this all dovetail into the believer but as we get ready to close let me read to you a portion of the church age book can you can you bear with me as we read some of the word the prophet says let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of revelation why he hates the book of revelations of jesus christ in the church because he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not and he knows a whole lot more than do 90 of theologians we're not dealing with a rookie he knows that since god is immutable in nature and he is just as immutable in his ways the brother sister that word immutable means he's not capable of change from the very beginning god has never changed you can bank on it he's never changed he said thus satan knows assuredly satan knows assuredly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action he said is the true church listen now that jesus claims as his own you want to be god's own put mark 16 in action you want to be god's own put the book of acts chapter 2 chapter 3 in action he said now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit will come into the church who are we yeah he's coming for you don't be surprised he's coming for you the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it and he's going to make it lukewarm and formal and powerless powerless the very thing that we're striving for power and authority in the name of jesus christ satan's there to try to pull it the rug right out from under your feet powerless he said because it exposes satan it's revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and discrediting god's word right down to the time that he's yesterday okay right up until the time that you got saved no right up in the time until he is cast into the lake of fire he fights it because he cannot stand it that's exactly why he's a troublemaker that's exactly why he comes to torment you that's exactly why he causes you problems because you hold the power in your hand that will eventually cast him into the lake of fire he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and what she can do the greater word works she will be an invincible army [Music] i'm talking this morning to a group of soldiers i'm talking this morning to a group of warriors that will go out and face satan head on and say because of who god is greater is he and you will go back to the lake of fire if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church by god's spirit discern withstand the antichrist spirit you know what satan will be powerless satan will be powerless before her he said oh he will be as definitely forted today as christ or as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it that's why we need messages like this we need this from time to time to give us the revelation of who we really are i love the word i love to get deep into the scriptures but sometimes i just need to know that god is on my side and i can't lose do you realize that you cannot lose he said yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us we will prevail over them he said you recall i mentioned at the beginning of this message that the book we're studying is actually the revelation of jesus himself in the church and the work in the future ages he said then i mentioned you take that home with you and think on that one we don't have time he said then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it he said bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study you can read your bible all you want you can underline you can highlight you can circle you can put a star it won't take ordinary study he said no no no it it to bring thinking to make this book real he said it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost that's why when you sit down to read your bible you say god anoint me to be able to hear and see your word to pull out of the word what you would have for me that means that this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people somebody's gonna run before we get out of here it'll take one with the prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse to verse or though that's good he says but a mystery requires teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear can the church world hear this kind of word and move the way we're moving can the presence of god be felt under this kind of preaching in that church um how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit and to hear and know i told you one of my greatest experiences when i became laid down and yielded to the spirit the presence was unbelievable and it's it's a presence that i wish i could replicate every time but i have to be honest and say that it doesn't happen every time but oh when it does god sent us another church just before the end time that the power of the holy ghost can come into her her the bride the church the bride that the power of the holy ghost can come into her in the demonstration of the spirit and mark 16 can follow the church and acts 2 4 acts 2 38 all of it will be following right along with the church signs and wonders accompanying the apostles signs and wonders accompanying the apostles great signs of there's a resurrection accompanying them while we were in prison surely god is growing a crop up somewhere this morning he said and out there in the land out there in the land this is where this will go i will trust that this message will help bring back vitamins into your system that you will grow spiritual power back into your life when brother branham preached that let's stand to our feet musicians would come when brother branham preached that that right there that portion of scripture are quotes come out of the uh message called deceived church by the world and when he preached that he was talking about talking about samson and he was talking about samson uh and during that message he was giving a warning out to the people and he's telling him simpson the philistines are on thee and he says worldly ism is creeping in amongst you branham tabernacle the philistines are upon you pentecost the philistines are upon you and i want to say this morning even in light the philistines are upon you but greater is he i'm going to close with the quote i started with and you think about this as you go home our church ought to be walking the street healing the sick raising the dead casting out devils doing signs and wonders making the whole world realize that jesus christ lives that's what we ought to be doing let's bow our heads heavenly father we come before you lord thankful that we've been in your presence this morning we're thankful that you accepted the invitation to come and worship with us and talk to us and teach us and lead us and guide us lord lord as we hear the words that we brought forth this morning lord may it be a reality in our lives that we're not just to put our our holy spirit up on a shelf somewhere but that the holy spirit was given and we abide in you that we could be fruits to the world that we could be joy and peace and healing and longsuffering and patience brotherly kindness and that there is deliverance in the holy spirit there's overcoming power in the holy spirit and that these revelations were given for just a handful of select special people oh lord we count ourselves no greater than anybody else lord but it was by your choosing as we've heard in the word that before you were before we were formed in our mother's wombs you knew us you chose us you ordained us you picked us to be and it's our lord and lord in ourselves we know we're nothing lord in ourselves we can talk a big game in ourselves we can we can talk about all the great things we can do and and the gifts that we have but lord jesus we're nothing without you [Music] so lord we cry out to you this morning we we lift our hands before and we bow our heads and we cling to your feet this morning lord and say fill us with your holy spirit fill us with the power fill us with the authority that was given to those on the day of pentecost that that same authority would fall down upon this church that we may be seen as a church that christ lives in lord jesus forgive us of our faults our failures our shortcomings lord forgive us for our human size but lord there is nothing like living living in the spiritual side in the holy side where you talk to us and you dwell in us and you abide and we abide lord help us to obey the word as it goes forth lord help us to open ourselves up and lay prostrate at the word and to be accepted and be able to accept father what you would show us in your scriptures and help us to punctuate every single word with an amen lord we love you lord we ask lord that you just continue to bless and move in this church and in this body as the believers hear they love you lord with something special lord you can see it in their eyes you can see it in their heart lord jesus bless us lord jesus we love you lord with all our hearts and give you glory and praise in your precious name amen amen what are you playing sister becky greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me the greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world o greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world oh satan's like a roaring lion roaming two and crows seeking whom he may devour the bible [Music] [Applause] but god has given to overcoming our praise the lord o greater you see that is in me greater is he that is in me the greater is he that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes with a power greater

need to do more for more in that way amen trying to get the lost amen to be saved and so forth amen amen let's give the lord a hand say thank you jesus amen praise god amen amen also brother brad amen for getting out of the way and just let the lord have you and you appreciate that praise the lord amen hallelujah amen i like it i mean i like that preaching that's it's really good amen and we just
