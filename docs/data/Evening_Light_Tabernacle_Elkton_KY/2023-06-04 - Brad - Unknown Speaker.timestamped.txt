[0:00] examples
[0:01] in the Bible
[0:03] where you where you have
[0:06] Abraham takes Isis up to Mount Moriah
[0:09] and God stays his hand about
[0:14] offering eyes of deaths and sacrifice
[0:16] but if you go
[0:18] this interview I hope I don't wind up
[0:20] reading this whole chapter but a lot of
[0:22] you know who Jacob was he was a he was a
[0:25] criminal well not a criminal but he was
[0:27] an outcast among the people and he was
[0:30] surrounded by uh people that were
[0:33] considered outcasts or criminals but
[0:35] I'll just read a few I'll just jump
[0:37] around
[0:38] my point and my point being you got to
[0:41] be careful as a father or as a man or
[0:44] woman
[0:47] the vows that you make before the Lord
[0:49] because he's going to hold you
[0:50] accountable for it the thing I find
[0:51] striking
[0:53] in this 11th chapter
[0:56] you know I'm just I'm just a man I can't
[0:58] play scripture but
[1:00] you know you would think that Jacob that
[1:03] God would stay his hand that he wouldn't
[1:04] sacrifice his own daughter
[1:06] as a burnt offering but I'll just read
[1:09] what's in this chapter and you know what
[1:11] I was reading in the 11th chapter of
[1:13] Hebrews
[1:14] where his name is mentioned in those you
[1:16] know in that Hall of Fame of all the
[1:19] people his name's there too but all and
[1:22] forgive my pronunciations I'm not the
[1:24] best with them
[1:25] then Jacob went to the Venture program
[1:28] with and the eldest of gilia and the
[1:31] people made him head and Captain over
[1:33] them I'm sorry
[1:36] and shape without all these words before
[1:38] the Lord misspound and Jacob sent
[1:40] messages on to the king and the children
[1:42] of Amon saying why is thou to do with me
[1:46] why else Thou come out against me to
[1:48] fight in my land and they're talking
[1:50] this is the land that Moses had given
[1:52] them you know on both sides of the
[1:54] Jordan and this is the land that they
[1:56] took from Amon when they wouldn't let
[1:58] the children of Israel pass through and
[2:00] the king of the children they weren't
[2:01] answered unto the message of japheth
[2:03] because there Israel took away my land
[2:06] when they come up out of Egypt
[2:08] from Iran and on to Jay Park and on to
[2:11] Jordan now therefore restore these lands
[2:13] again if you know the scriptures you
[2:16] know that God said you can never give
[2:18] back to the heating what I have given
[2:20] you so that was you can't do it he
[2:23] couldn't do it
[2:24] and Jacob sent messages saying unto the
[2:27] king of the children of aeon Amon and he
[2:30] said unto them thus saith jape if Israel
[2:33] took not away the land of the land of
[2:35] the children of Mayon but when Israel
[2:37] came up from Egypt and walked through
[2:39] the Wilderness onto the Red Sea and came
[2:42] to cut us when Israel sent messages onto
[2:45] the king of Edom saying let me I pray
[2:48] thee pass through the land
[2:50] and the King Amendment would not hearken
[2:51] they're there too and in like manner
[2:54] they sent unto the king of Moab and he
[2:56] would not consent so as we go down he
[2:58] talks about all the people
[3:01] that the that the Israelites asked for
[3:03] permission to go through the land
[3:05] instead of letting them go through they
[3:07] Ward against them and then I'm jumping
[3:09] down to the ninth verse
[3:11] and Israel sent messages well let me
[3:14] jump
[3:15] then the Lord God Israel now I'm gonna
[3:18] jump I don't want to read all these
[3:20] scripture shares
[3:23] I'll start at about 23rd verse here and
[3:25] now the Lord God of Israel had
[3:27] dispossessed the armorites from before
[3:30] his people of Israel should have stopped
[3:31] possessing but thou possess what charm
[3:35] us thy God giveth thee to possess so
[3:37] whom ever the Lord I'll drive out from
[3:40] for Force then when we possess now art
[3:43] thou anything better than ballet the son
[3:45] of zippoor the king of love
[3:47] do you ever strive against Israel or did
[3:50] we ever fight against them when Israel
[3:52] grew up in heshban and her towns and
[3:54] Aaron her towns and and the cities to be
[3:57] along the coast of era there are three
[3:59] therefore did you not recover them so
[4:02] he's given them a response at no other
[4:05] time than they ever tried to repossess
[4:07] the lands and then he wherefore not
[4:10] sinned against thee but thou that's me
[4:12] wrong to war against me the Lord the
[4:15] judge be judged this day between the
[4:17] children of Israel and the children of
[4:19] Imam are that the king the children of
[4:21] Amon heart did not unto the words of
[4:24] Jeff
[4:24] which he sent them
[4:26] and then the spirit of the Lord Came
[4:28] Upon Jacob and he passed over Gilead and
[4:31] Manassas and passed over misbah and
[4:33] Gilead and from mispar of Gilead he
[4:36] passed over onto the children man and
[4:38] this is this is already verse instead of
[4:41] reading all that and Jab fouled a vow
[4:44] unto the Lord and said if that will
[4:45] without fail so delivered the children
[4:47] of aeon into my hands then shall it be
[4:51] that whosoever come forth the doors of
[4:54] my house to meet me when I return in
[4:56] peace from the children of them shall
[4:58] surely be the Lord and I will offer it
[5:00] up for a burnt offering
[5:02] and I was there you just got to be
[5:05] careful of what you promise you know
[5:07] what you promise people you're going to
[5:08] do what you promise them you're not
[5:10] going to do what you make a vow to the
[5:12] Lord you know every vow that you make
[5:14] before the Lord should be a vowel that
[5:16] goes that intertwines through the
[5:18] scriptures you can't promise someone
[5:20] that God's word doesn't promise you
[5:22] can't do for something somebody that's
[5:24] something that's contrary to the word of
[5:27] God you know I'll just
[5:29] he got the victory
[5:32] and then I'll reached on at the 31st
[5:35] fourth verse and Jeff came to miss Pawn
[5:37] to the house and behold the his
[5:39] daughters came out to meet his daughter
[5:40] came out to meet him with trembles and
[5:43] with dance and she was his only child
[5:45] beside her he had neither son nor
[5:48] daughter so this was his only child
[5:50] and he came to pass when he saw he ran
[5:52] his clothes and said ask my daughter
[5:55] that was brought me very low about the
[5:57] one of them that traveled me if I open
[5:59] my mouth onto the Lord and I cannot go
[6:01] back and that's what he's trying to say
[6:04] once you make a promise you got to keep
[6:06] it you know I was going through the
[6:08] scriptures you know I would think
[6:11] the only thing as a man like I said I'm
[6:14] not a profitable I can't play scripture
[6:16] I can't tell you what God was thinking
[6:18] you know if I've been with the disciples
[6:20] in the Day of Israel I would have asked
[6:22] about this year why didn't God send a
[6:24] prophet but I can't I can't say anything
[6:27] other than what the word of God says and
[6:29] she said unto him my father if thou has
[6:32] opened thy mouth unto the Lord to do to
[6:34] me according to that which has preceded
[6:36] out of thy mouth for as much as the Lord
[6:38] have taken Vengeance for thee for my
[6:41] enemies even for the children of Imam
[6:44] and she and he said unto her father let
[6:47] thine things be done for me let me alone
[6:50] for two months that I may go up and draw
[6:52] upon my mouth upon the mountains
[6:54] and beware my virginity and I am my
[6:58] fellows and he said go and he sent her
[7:00] away for two months and she went with
[7:03] her companions at beweld her virginity
[7:05] upon the mountain that came to pass at
[7:07] the end of the two months she returned
[7:09] on to the father who did who did with
[7:13] her according to his film which he have
[7:15] found and she know knew no man and it
[7:18] was a custom of Israel that the
[7:19] daughters of Israel went yielding
[7:22] to lament the daughter of Jeff the
[7:24] Gilead light for four days in a year and
[7:27] I'm just gonna
[7:29] jump up here to this Psalm 2 and then
[7:32] sit down this morning you know sometimes
[7:35] you can star well and you finish bad
[7:38] um I was just also thinking
[7:40] I'll just read the psalm and sit down
[7:43] but we live in an age where it's really
[7:45] important you know who you are and I'll
[7:47] just I was thinking this morning I was
[7:50] talking at the beginning I was talking
[7:52] about how the world is out there
[7:54] and you see all that's going on
[7:58] but just remember
[8:00] when they made the the one reli the one
[8:03] group of Believers they're constantly
[8:06] attacking making fun of trying to
[8:09] destroy is the Christian believer
[8:12] they're not I I say to people sometimes
[8:15] you know when they talk bad about
[8:17] Christians I'd like to see them to say
[8:19] the same thing about a Muslim or the
[8:22] things they do to church uh Christian
[8:24] Church just let them see them do it do a
[8:26] Muslim Mosque and they wouldn't go very
[8:29] far it wouldn't fall on a very good
[8:31] crowd but I'll just read what the second
[8:33] Psalm has to say why did the Heathen
[8:35] rage and the people imagine obeying
[8:37] things and the kings of the earth set
[8:40] themselves to take counsel together
[8:42] against the Lord and against this
[8:44] anointed saint let us break their bands
[8:47] in asunder and Cast Away their quotes
[8:48] from us
[8:50] be that sitteth in heaven shall laugh
[8:52] and the Lord shall have them in delivers
[8:54] him he shall speak unto them in Wrath
[8:56] and vexil them in his sword displeasure
[8:59] yet I have set my king upon the holy
[9:02] hell of Zion I will declare the decree
[9:04] in the Lord that said unto me thou art
[9:06] my son this day have I begotten thee ask
[9:09] me and I shall give Thee the Heathen for
[9:12] thy inheritance and the uttermost part
[9:14] of the earth for thy possessions
[9:18] now thou shall break them with a rod of
[9:21] iron thou shall vast them in pieces like
[9:24] upon us this be wise now therefore oh
[9:27] you Kings and be instructed you Jersey
[9:29] judges of the Earth
[9:31] serve the Lord with fear and rejoice
[9:32] with Kremlin kiss the son least he be
[9:35] angry and ye perish from the wife when
[9:38] is wrath is kindled but a little blessed
[9:41] are all they they put their trust in him
[9:43] and I was just thinking
[9:44] in the age that we live and that's a
[9:47] hope that we're having
[9:48] the belief the unbelievers out there in
[9:52] the world there's not any
[9:55] we you hope the best form you desire the
[9:58] best for him but if you believe God's
[10:01] word you
[10:04] I I don't know how to say it there's no
[10:06] outside of Christ in your heart and life
[10:09] there's really no hope for for the for
[10:12] any anything that you know anything that
[10:14] you hold dear out there in the world I'm
[10:15] not saying it ain't a good thing but the
[10:17] only hope we have is Believers or as
[10:19] peoples in Jesus Christ and if you're
[10:22] looking for anything else other than
[10:24] that
[10:24] then you're going to be disappointed on
[10:26] that day brother Steve

[24:02] Brother David when I'm here but I didn't
[24:04] get past brother Steve either so it's
[24:07] not to be
[24:08] but I'll sing for you just a little
[24:11] song taken out of the Psalms you're
[24:13] probably all familiar with Psalms 19
[24:14] more to be desired are they than gold
[24:17] beautiful when you look at the first
[24:19] line of each verse there the law of the
[24:21] Lord is perfect the statues of the Lord
[24:24] are right the fear of the Lord is clean
[24:27] more to be desired are they than gold
[24:29] and I'll just share a brief little story
[24:31] of uh comes from Mr Rockefeller who had
[24:34] the wealth of the world right and there
[24:37] was a reporter interviewing him he asked
[24:38] him
[24:39] at what point were you satisfied with
[24:41] your wealth or anything that he said
[24:43] that what does it take to satisfy a man
[24:45] and very insightful Mr Rockefeller said
[24:48] it just takes a little bit more
[24:51] so you never if you chase riches you'd
[24:54] never catch it it's a it's an empty
[24:56] thing when you get there and that's why
[24:58] you find a lot of wealthy people that
[24:59] become philanthropists they want to give
[25:00] it away because they realize there's no
[25:02] joy in having
[25:04] the wealth it to anyhow here's true
[25:07] riches here's more to be desired are
[25:10] they than gold the statues of the Lord
[25:13] fear of the Lord
[25:15] the law of the Lord
[25:17] the love the Lord is
[25:22] expect
[25:23] converting the soul
[25:28] the testimony of the Lord is sure making
[25:35] wise the simple
[25:39] more to be
[25:41] desired are they than gold yea then much
[25:46] fine gold
[25:50] oh the sweeter also then
[25:53] honey
[25:56] and the honeycomb
[26:01] the statues of the Lord are right
[26:07] rejoicing the heart
[26:10] [Music]
[26:11] the Commandment of the Lord is pure
[26:18] enlightening the eyes
[26:22] more to be
[26:24] desired are they foreign
[26:43] [Music]
[26:48] [Music]
[26:53] ever
[26:55] the judgments of the Lord are true and
[27:01] righteous all together
[27:03] oh
[27:22] [Music]
[27:29] hallelujah thank you
[27:31] [Music]
[27:43] thank you brother Russell
[27:49] I don't want to put anybody on the spot
[27:51] but
[27:52] does any of the family got a song back
[27:54] there
[28:00] okay all right
[28:03] but that was like you don't know
[28:06] that's my niece and their family from
[28:11] Jeffersonville area
[28:14] the Steve would you like to come up and
[28:16] give a testimony
[28:20] and
[28:35] God bless you Saints I think I know a
[28:38] few in the congregation uh no brother
[28:41] Steve of course and but it's good to be
[28:44] here with y'all
[28:45] um I uh
[28:47] I do a lot of things there at the church
[28:49] there in New Albany brother Nathan
[28:51] Bryant's Church the open door uh teach
[28:54] Sunday school and help out whatever wet
[28:56] can just like you do so sometimes I as
[28:59] the trustee I plunge the toilets
[29:01] um other times I preach a sermon so we
[29:05] just do what we can for the Lord uh I've
[29:08] had the opportunity a few times to go
[29:10] overseas and one thing that always
[29:12] strikes me is the presence of the Lord
[29:14] amongst the people no matter where
[29:16] you're at what state what country when
[29:19] you get around Believers that have the
[29:20] Holy Spirit it's that same spirit and we
[29:23] know because we're all baptized into the
[29:25] body of Christ by that same spirit so
[29:27] I'm looking forward to meeting more of
[29:29] you all uh chat with you outside but
[29:32] really looking forward to the service
[29:34] today What the Lord Has for us in the
[29:36] word and um you know I was just thinking
[29:40] as that brother was teaching Sunday
[29:41] school this morning what he was saying
[29:44] there about this age and about the
[29:47] importance of having Christ a real
[29:49] relationship with Christ Jesus that's
[29:51] the only thing that can hold a person in
[29:53] this age is that Holy Spirit that true
[29:56] word living in us and it can't just be
[29:58] taking somebody else's word for it
[30:00] learning from somebody else but that
[30:02] word as he was saying has to be
[30:04] something that we consume and come alive
[30:06] in us reminds me of you know Psalms one
[30:09] there where it says that believer
[30:11] planted by the rivers of water bringing
[30:14] forth fruit in its season so I don't
[30:17] know what the brother wanted me to to
[30:19] say as far as the testimony but I'll
[30:22] just say one little testimony of
[30:23] something good the Lord's done in my
[30:25] life uh a few years ago we we felt led
[30:29] to get a little place uh you know a
[30:32] different house with a little bit of
[30:33] land and uh as as it would work out the
[30:37] lord gave us a place uh helped our house
[30:40] to sell for more than we thought it
[30:41] would sell for and worked everything out
[30:43] to where we could get that place and we
[30:45] thought hey it's smooth sailing praise
[30:47] the Lord everything's good but you know
[30:49] that's when Satan's on his road to give
[30:51] you a hard time is when the Lord's doing
[30:53] something for you so as it worked out
[30:56] for us right as we were getting ready to
[30:58] try and close we got Another Blessing
[31:01] where we got to move some of our stuff
[31:03] into that house ahead of time because
[31:05] the prior people had left but then right
[31:08] about that time I lost my job and you
[31:12] know what happens they do that
[31:14] employment verification check to make
[31:16] sure you have a job before
[31:17] and everything and I was real worried
[31:20] you know I was tempted to be worried
[31:22] there do that check and this deal is
[31:23] going to fall through and all these
[31:25] thoughts come into your head you know uh
[31:28] my half my stuff's in the house I'm
[31:29] gonna have to pay somebody to move it
[31:31] out and get all this worry and all this
[31:33] things coming on I thought you know what
[31:35] the same God that gave me that house and
[31:38] helped my house to sell for above asking
[31:40] price so I could get that house is the
[31:43] same God that's going to get me a job
[31:44] and work this all out
[31:46] and you know uh I just went to the Lord
[31:49] in prayer and just started doing what I
[31:51] could do and through an employment
[31:54] agency
[31:55] um I got an interview with a company
[31:56] that I had worked at before and I left
[31:59] on good terms but I didn't want to go
[32:00] back
[32:01] you know how that is sometimes but the
[32:04] Lord got me an interview and it was a
[32:06] phone interview with about 15 people and
[32:09] as I got on the line and started to
[32:11] introduce myself there was one man that
[32:13] spoke up and he said you know what I
[32:16] hired Steven the first time he came to
[32:18] this company and he was a great employee
[32:20] we don't even need to continue this view
[32:22] I'm going to hire him and so it just
[32:25] worked out I I was able to within two
[32:28] weeks get the new job start the new job
[32:31] the employment verification went through
[32:32] fine we got the house and uh you know it
[32:36] was just a real reminder to me to take
[32:39] God at his word and remember the things
[32:42] that he's done even in the midst of the
[32:44] trials he's guiding every step and he is
[32:48] faithful to perform and complete every
[32:51] work that he has started God bless you

[38:10] the Lord and share the words so I don't
[38:12] want to keep you long this morning but
[38:13] just until I finish
[38:15] so
[38:16] some of you caught that uh
[38:19] if you want to be turning in your Bibles
[38:21] I'm going to read from a couple of
[38:22] portions of scripture uh first John and
[38:25] then I'm also going to Reign from read
[38:26] from Saint John
[38:29] and uh just thinking and listening to
[38:31] the testimony of our brother how good
[38:33] God is and he's always faithful and on
[38:35] time and he knows our needs before we
[38:38] even have need of them uh he's our
[38:40] protector he's our healer he's our God
[38:42] he's our financial advisor he's our
[38:44] counselor we can just go on for hours of
[38:48] what God does for us and and what he
[38:49] does for through us
[38:52] um you know just uh just a quick
[38:54] testimony the other day uh and and I
[38:56] didn't I didn't even think about this
[38:57] till the brother was speaking and I just
[38:59] thought how good God is uh Weston was up
[39:02] at the at the house the other day riding
[39:03] the four-wheeler and just kind of
[39:05] getting away and uh wasp got after him
[39:08] as he was sitting there watching the
[39:09] deer he jumps off the four-wheeler and
[39:11] starts dancing and probably screaming
[39:14] you know a little bit about this red
[39:15] wasp and right when he's getting ready
[39:17] to step and running from this walls he
[39:19] looks down and there's a copper hit
[39:22] he was one step away from stepping right
[39:25] on it
[39:26] and we sat down at the dinner table I
[39:28] said you know what that was I said that
[39:29] was just the hand of God showing you
[39:31] where where not to put your footsteps
[39:35] I said because you were you should have
[39:37] been bitten you were that close they
[39:38] don't play they they're aggressive they
[39:41] don't play but God is mindful of every
[39:44] step we take
[39:47] I want to speak to you this morning if
[39:49] we could on the comforter
[39:52] and The Advocate
[39:54] the comforter and The Advocate
[39:56] um
[39:57] you know we're in a late hour I'm gonna
[40:00] I'm gonna let you stand for just a
[40:02] minute it it uh it'll do us some good to
[40:04] get legs stretched right so uh thinking
[40:08] about this I thought you know we're
[40:10] living in a late hour we're living in an
[40:12] hour where sin is rampant and we know
[40:14] that is not nothing new to us it
[40:16] shouldn't take us by surprise
[40:18] uh it it doesn't take God by surprise
[40:21] the Bible tells us and I'm going to get
[40:23] into some of that the Bible tells us as
[40:25] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[40:27] be so when we hear about homosexuals and
[40:30] we hear about transgender and and we
[40:32] hear about all these different uh events
[40:35] that's happening and and wars and rumors
[40:37] of wars and the political parties are
[40:39] absolutely uh inspired by the devil
[40:43] whether you like him or not
[40:46] no matter what what side of the fence
[40:48] you're on left or right they're all
[40:50] inspired by something and I don't think
[40:53] it's a heavenly and so you know I'm
[40:56] thinking about this and and uh just was
[40:58] listening to a little clip that Joe has
[41:00] pulled up there's a weather man that
[41:01] does uh clips and stuff and he was
[41:04] talking about the New Madrid fault as
[41:06] many of you know we are just miles from
[41:08] the New Madrid fault line and he said
[41:11] that scientists have proven that it's 35
[41:12] years past due of a major event
[41:18] now the last major event run church
[41:20] bells in Boston
[41:21] it busted sidewalks in Washington DC
[41:26] and so this next major event who knows I
[41:30] hope we're gone
[41:32] it'd be nice to have taken a Rapture
[41:34] right before that happened and get out
[41:35] of here but the world is shaken and they
[41:39] said the New Madrid is waking up
[41:42] um if any of you know where Nebo is it's
[41:44] just a little town maybe 30 40 miles
[41:46] north of here had a 2.5 I think it's
[41:49] probably closer to Brother John and his
[41:51] family maybe up that kind of that
[41:53] direction
[41:54] um
[41:55] Nebo they had a 2.5 earthquake last week
[41:58] and another one followed it up and we're
[42:00] right here on the we're on the line and
[42:03] uh you know so things are shaking they
[42:05] shouldn't surprise us what that should
[42:06] tell us is hey we're at the end
[42:09] we're at the end to where God is going
[42:12] to raise up somebody
[42:14] we're that somebody we're that standard
[42:17] that's going to have to be raised up to
[42:19] a higher level
[42:22] let me read this to you this is Brother
[42:25] Brown I'm speaking
[42:26] who is The Advocate Jesus Christ the
[42:29] righteous
[42:30] and he is a propitiation for our sins
[42:33] and not only for ours but also for the
[42:38] sins of the whole world
[42:40] what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate
[42:43] what is an abdicator what does it do he
[42:46] makes advocate he has Mercy it stands in
[42:49] your place
[42:51] it stands in your place and it says it
[42:54] does things that you cannot do
[43:00] this Advocate is an amazing thing that
[43:04] we need
[43:05] the holy spirit is a believer's must
[43:08] because it does think it makes me do
[43:10] things that I'm not capable of doing
[43:12] it'll make you do things in your life
[43:15] that you're not capable of doing
[43:18] he says it's a propitiation for your sin
[43:20] it's righteousness it's your healing
[43:22] it's your life it's your Resurrection
[43:24] it's all that God has for you
[43:29] that's what this Advocate is that's what
[43:31] this this uh propitiation does he says
[43:34] and here we go we can go into details he
[43:36] says and he makes intercession for our
[43:39] ignorance
[43:41] he says sometimes we got the Holy Ghost
[43:46] praise the Lord
[43:49] sometimes we have the Holy Ghost
[43:52] and he says
[43:54] [Music]
[43:55] we ignorantly stagger into something
[44:00] how many has ever been in that place
[44:02] you know you're born again you know
[44:04] you've got the Holy Ghost you're feeling
[44:05] LED and inspired by God and the next
[44:07] thing you know you find yourself in a
[44:09] situation in a place listening seeing
[44:12] hearing talking and you think man I've
[44:15] got myself in a pickle here this is not
[44:17] where God wants me to be
[44:21] in our ignorance
[44:23] sometimes we find ourselves there and he
[44:25] said but he's the advocator for us he's
[44:28] our attorney he stands in pleas for us
[44:31] he plays your case to God he please on
[44:35] your behalf he says because you can't
[44:37] plea for yourself
[44:39] we can try all we want God I knew I
[44:43] shouldn't God I wished I hadn't God I
[44:46] knew better
[44:47] we need an advocate in our life that
[44:50] goes Before the Throne of God and says
[44:52] God I'm not worthy please forgive me
[44:55] that Advocate speaks on our behalf
[44:59] and he says the Holy Spirit giving
[45:01] utterance
[45:02] he says and when we walk into things
[45:04] like a little kid he said we're walking
[45:06] in the dark in a world full of enemies
[45:08] and full of sin and full of traps and
[45:11] full of everything
[45:12] and he said you say oh I'm afraid I'm
[45:15] afraid to take a Christian Life I'm
[45:17] afraid to do this I'm afraid to do that
[45:20] don't be afraid because we have an
[45:23] advocate
[45:24] Don't Be Afraid we have an advocate he
[45:26] stands by us he stands in us he makes
[45:29] intercession for us the Holy Spirit he
[45:32] says constantly constantly constantly
[45:34] making an advocate for us all the time
[45:39] constantly
[45:40] on our behalf
[45:43] brother Russell good to see you and your
[45:45] family
[45:46] he said it's a seal a sign a spirit of
[45:49] Life the god of Heaven the comforter the
[45:51] Life The Advocate what he is oh my we
[45:53] could go on for hours
[45:56] um
[45:57] turn with me into the book of First John
[46:00] chapter 2.
[46:01] first John chapter 2.
[46:04] then we'll let you have your seats here
[46:06] in just a minute
[46:09] brother Butler I'll tell you it must be
[46:11] getting hot outside because it was
[46:12] getting hot in there
[46:14] I don't know if that air is working in
[46:15] there
[46:18] John first John chapter 2. now John
[46:21] speaks of this Advocate five times four
[46:24] times in uh in Saint John and once in
[46:27] first John and here's where he speaks
[46:30] about it this is considered one of the
[46:31] most intimate and inspired writings in
[46:33] all the Bible uh aside from the Song of
[46:37] Solomon
[46:38] and John opens with the words little
[46:41] children
[46:42] little children meaning the born ones
[46:46] how many this morning can say we're born
[46:48] again
[46:50] we're the born once so John here is
[46:52] speaking he says little children
[46:55] the Born Again Sons and Daughters of God
[46:57] Little Children these things are right
[46:59] unto you that you sin not and if any man
[47:02] sin we have an advocate with the father
[47:05] Jesus Christ the righteous and he is a
[47:09] propitiation for our sins and not only
[47:11] ours but the sins of the whole world
[47:13] that propitiation that word right there
[47:15] means the act of gaining favor or making
[47:19] things right with someone
[47:21] especially after having done something
[47:24] wrong isn't that amazing
[47:27] the man who could do no wrong
[47:30] stands in the gap for us
[47:32] to all we can do is wrong
[47:35] because we're born in flesh
[47:39] and then let's go down to the end of
[47:41] that verse six he says and he the saith
[47:43] he abide in him all to himself also to
[47:45] walk even as he walked so if we're going
[47:49] to gain the benefits of this
[47:50] propitiation if we're going to gain the
[47:53] benefits of this Advocate that stands in
[47:55] the gap for us
[47:56] the word tells us that we ought to walk
[47:58] the way he walked
[48:01] we ought to do the things that he did we
[48:04] ought to say the things he said
[48:06] turn with me now to Saint John chapter
[48:08] 14.
[48:16] here we at the notice we're at the last
[48:20] passover supper supper's just ended
[48:23] Jesus has just washed the disciples feet
[48:25] he's explaining to him about what's
[48:27] about to happen
[48:29] and tell them where he's going what's
[48:31] happening and what they're supposed to
[48:32] do and thank God that Thomas was bold
[48:35] enough to speak up and ask what everyone
[48:37] else in the room was thinking and afraid
[48:40] to ask
[48:43] we you know we get we get hard on Thomas
[48:45] sometimes
[48:46] and and we laugh and we poke fun at
[48:49] Thomas but do you realize if he hadn't
[48:50] asked the question of where are you
[48:53] going who are you what is what are we
[48:55] really what have we witnessed what's
[48:56] really happening here if he had not
[48:59] asked that question do you know we
[49:01] probably wouldn't have had a clear
[49:02] picture of who we are and what the
[49:04] Spirit-filled believer's supposed to do
[49:05] in our day
[49:07] and he asked a question and got the
[49:10] elephant out of the room that everybody
[49:12] wants to know the answer to can you
[49:14] imagine all them looking at Thomas like
[49:16] look at this guy I wonder what he's
[49:18] gonna say
[49:20] and he looks at him and he says verily
[49:22] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[49:24] on me the works that I do shall he do
[49:26] also and what Greater Works than me
[49:29] shall he do because I go to my father
[49:33] so Jesus was telling him hey brothers
[49:34] it's your time to shine
[49:37] I'm leaving this place
[49:40] all of the wonderful Miracles you've
[49:42] seen the blind eyes that's been opened
[49:44] the ears that's been opened the healings
[49:46] have taken place the demonic spirits
[49:48] you've seen cast out through my Ministry
[49:51] all of these wonderful life changes that
[49:53] changing events that you've witnessed
[49:55] now that same Authority is being handed
[49:58] to you
[49:59] because I'm leaving I'm leaving here
[50:03] and verse 13 says and whatsoever you
[50:05] shall ask him my name that will I do
[50:07] that the father may be glorified in the
[50:11] son
[50:11] if you ask anything in my name what's it
[50:15] say
[50:16] one more time
[50:19] so if you the believer
[50:22] are living the life of a Believer and
[50:24] you ask anything in the name of Jesus
[50:27] he'll do it
[50:31] that's some powerful words right there
[50:33] I will do it if you love me keep my
[50:37] Commandments he stresses that keep my
[50:40] Commandments and I will do it
[50:44] the problem is sometimes we don't keep
[50:46] all the Commandments
[50:49] and he says I will pray the father and
[50:52] he shall give you another comforter that
[50:55] he may abide with you forever let's bow
[50:57] our heads Heavenly Father we're thankful
[50:59] to be in your house this morning Lord
[51:01] and just wanting to stand this morning
[51:04] humbly before the people humbly before
[51:07] your bride Lord with this little thought
[51:09] that you've placed on My Heart Lord and
[51:11] I pray Lord that it will be a blessing
[51:13] to your your bride Mrs Jesus Christ I
[51:16] trust it will lift us up it will
[51:18] encourage us it will show us who we are
[51:20] I trust Lord that it will bring us
[51:23] closer to you that we would be uh those
[51:25] that are doing the Greater Works as your
[51:27] word says Lord we just want to tell you
[51:29] we love you we appreciate you and
[51:30] dedicate this service into your hands
[51:33] Lord
[51:34] in Jesus name we pray amen you may have
[51:36] your seat sorry to keep you standing so
[51:38] long
[51:40] the word
[51:42] as we're looking here I'm going to focus
[51:44] on verse 16.
[51:47] and I will pray the father and he shall
[51:48] give you another
[51:50] comforter
[51:51] that he may abide with you forever
[51:55] this scripture here came to me about six
[51:58] months seven months ago
[52:01] and it completely changed my way of
[52:03] thinking
[52:05] in a good way of Who We Are
[52:08] of who Jesus would have us to be it
[52:12] completely inspired me to look at the
[52:14] Bible through a different set of eyes
[52:15] from the very beginning
[52:18] uh at the children of Israel even to the
[52:20] to the where they put the blood over the
[52:22] Leno and the token was applied it
[52:24] brought it down into the the Book of
[52:26] Judges where I seen the men that was
[52:28] overcoming in the Book of Judges it
[52:30] brought it all the way down into uh the
[52:33] Psalms or I could see where David's life
[52:35] was inspired by this comforter it
[52:38] brought it down into Peter and James and
[52:40] John and it brought it into Mary and I
[52:42] began to see this is something more than
[52:44] what I've ever thought the holy spirit
[52:46] is an essential need we have to have it
[52:49] and if we don't have it we got to get it
[52:52] because there is a bride that's going to
[52:54] be a special group of people it's not an
[52:58] everyday Christian Life that in and out
[53:01] of church here there ups and downs woes
[53:03] and and giving in to the world the
[53:06] believer the Bride of Jesus Christ is a
[53:08] holy ghost filled power with authority
[53:12] type bride
[53:15] foreign
[53:18] look at this word another comforter
[53:20] another when you look at that in the
[53:22] Greek it means an identical or just
[53:27] just alike so Jesus Is Telling Brothers
[53:29] I'm leaving here I'm going to go prepare
[53:33] a place for you I'm going to prepare a
[53:34] Heavenly home for you so that when I
[53:36] come back you can leave this old hellish
[53:39] world you will leave this place you
[53:41] won't have to rub shoulders with those
[53:43] nasty dirty hairy demons up in the the
[53:46] abide in this world anymore you won't
[53:49] have to sit and watch two men walk down
[53:52] the street holding hands anymore you
[53:54] won't have to look and watch two women
[53:56] locking lips and kissing and loving on
[53:58] each other anymore at the stop lights on
[54:01] the sidewalks in the malls in the
[54:03] restaurants you won't have to worry
[54:05] about seeing men dressing up like women
[54:07] wearing high heels and painting their
[54:09] lips
[54:10] come on this is the world we're living
[54:12] in and Jesus is telling me
[54:15] you won't have to worry about that you
[54:18] know Disneyland listen to this
[54:19] Disneyland of all places
[54:23] Cinderella has now become Cinder fella
[54:27] have you seen this
[54:29] has anybody in here seen it raise your
[54:31] hand if you have
[54:33] I'm not sure which park it is but it's
[54:36] Disney
[54:38] they have a place where there's a man
[54:41] standing out there
[54:43] and Cinderella dress
[54:46] with a mustache
[54:49] and inviting the little kids come in you
[54:51] can be you can be a princess if you want
[54:53] little boys come on in you can be
[54:55] whatever you want just come on in we'll
[54:57] dress you up and put you in a cute pink
[54:59] little skirting and pink little sandals
[55:01] and you can just parade around and you
[55:03] can be a princess
[55:06] that is inspired straight out of the
[55:08] pits of hell
[55:10] for a place that has the of the public
[55:13] uh presentation in the audacity to to
[55:17] lure little boys little children three
[55:19] four five years old in and say come here
[55:21] dress like a girl
[55:25] it's the age we're living in
[55:28] it's part of this scripture or part of
[55:30] the where brother Brown said there must
[55:31] be 200 000 demons be poured out before
[55:34] the Rapture takes place
[55:37] they were rubbing shoulders with them
[55:39] day after day and but you remember now
[55:41] Jesus said
[55:43] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[55:45] it be in the coming of son of man he
[55:47] said see we are everybody will agree we
[55:49] all agree with that we all agree that
[55:51] we're in a solemn condition listen he
[55:53] says I picked up a Los Angeles paper
[55:55] this is 1965.
[55:58] I picked up a Los Angeles paper here not
[56:00] long ago and it said homosexuals is on
[56:02] the increase by 30 percent
[56:05] each year
[56:09] you know you can do compound interest
[56:12] and one
[56:15] point five percent grows pretty quick
[56:18] over 40 years
[56:21] into a big big number
[56:24] so 30 every year he said it's horrible
[56:27] the government is horrible everything's
[56:30] perverted the whole thing the whole
[56:32] system the church is all perverted
[56:33] brothers sisters that's the condition
[56:35] that we're living in it's in time and
[56:37] like I said earlier this is no surprise
[56:39] to God
[56:40] it didn't catch him off guard that men
[56:42] are dressing like women
[56:44] we look at it we magnify but we we fail
[56:47] to remember that somebody's going to
[56:50] keep the standard
[56:51] somebody's gonna raise up that standard
[56:54] the book of Isaiah says when the enemy
[56:55] comes in like a flood
[56:58] and how many can say we've seen a flood
[57:00] of evil spirits in this last day a flood
[57:06] you can feel it when you go out in
[57:08] public
[57:09] used to you could go to a restaurant
[57:11] have a decent meal used to you could
[57:14] drive to Clarksville and get around used
[57:17] to you could go to Nashville and enjoy
[57:18] not anymore
[57:20] I hate it
[57:21] I hate going out I hate going to
[57:24] Nashville I took a 30-minute detour the
[57:26] other day just because I didn't want to
[57:27] drive by 24. because of the road rage
[57:29] the spirit the evil that's out there you
[57:32] don't know what the person next to you
[57:34] is doing look at them wrong they'll
[57:35] shoot you
[57:37] it's an evil evil age we're living in
[57:41] but just as Isaiah said it will say the
[57:44] evil will come in like a flood it says
[57:46] the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[57:48] standard against it there is a standard
[57:52] that's going to be lifted up are you
[57:53] with me this morning is this working
[57:56] who is the standard we are the standard
[57:59] where are the standards Jesus said
[58:01] listen fellas I'm gone
[58:06] amen without me it's not going to be
[58:09] easy
[58:11] maybe it isn't Arizona brother Russell
[58:13] maybe life is easy
[58:16] maybe they don't Mock You in Arizona
[58:19] or in Louisville
[58:23] but he says it's not going to be easy
[58:26] you're going to have to take a stand
[58:28] you're going to be mocked you're going
[58:30] to be ridiculed you're going to be made
[58:31] fun of they're going to try to tear you
[58:33] down they're going to try to destroy the
[58:35] family altar
[58:38] um
[58:40] how do they do that how does Satan and
[58:42] his little
[58:43] evil spirits do that time
[58:47] time
[58:49] if they can occupy your time
[58:52] if they can occupy your time where the
[58:55] family can't sit down at dinner the
[58:57] family can't talk about the goodness of
[58:59] God well the family can't get together
[59:01] and pray together read the Bible
[59:03] together hey I'll tell you I'm guilty
[59:05] we're guilty I think I probably all of
[59:07] us are guilty to some point
[59:10] where's a few honest ones here
[59:14] time he wants our time he takes our
[59:17] time
[59:19] they tear down the altar but Jesus says
[59:22] don't worry
[59:26] don't worry
[59:28] I won't leave you comfortless
[59:31] I won't leave you comfortless don't
[59:33] worry little bride in this last day in
[59:35] this last age I will send a comforter to
[59:38] you I will send another comforter and
[59:40] that comforter will make you walk like
[59:42] me it'll make you talk like me it'll
[59:45] make you act like me it'll make you
[59:46] forgive like me it'll make you love like
[59:49] me it'll make you have joy like me and
[59:52] happiness like me and peace like me and
[59:54] authority over sickness like me and
[59:56] authority over death like me
[59:59] is anybody with me
[1:00:02] this is what he said that comforter is
[1:00:04] going to do for you
[1:00:05] death brothers and sisters is just a
[1:00:07] bump in the road
[1:00:09] when we begin to realize that that
[1:00:12] anything in this world really doesn't
[1:00:13] matter
[1:00:15] that life was before the foundation and
[1:00:18] it lives Eternal there's no end to life
[1:00:21] when you die you just cross over it's
[1:00:23] just a bump in your journey
[1:00:28] sickness heartache heart attacks disease
[1:00:31] diabetes
[1:00:33] bump
[1:00:35] it really doesn't matter
[1:00:39] it's irrelevant
[1:00:42] I'll give you another comforter
[1:00:45] this is the word that caught me months
[1:00:48] ago
[1:00:49] the comforter
[1:00:50] and I mentioned it in a service that I
[1:00:52] preached just briefly but it stuck out
[1:00:54] to me I couldn't get away from it
[1:00:56] the comforter in Greek is paracletos
[1:01:03] it's not a new word
[1:01:05] it's in the all Scofield Bibles been
[1:01:07] there since 19 whatever
[1:01:09] paracletose and it means one called
[1:01:13] alongside to help
[1:01:19] mine uses it four or five times in that
[1:01:21] context one caught a long side to help
[1:01:25] so you mean to tell me brothers and
[1:01:27] sisters when all hell is stacked against
[1:01:29] me when all hell is stacked against you
[1:01:31] in this day and you're battling
[1:01:33] depression and you're battling fear and
[1:01:35] anxiety and cancer disease and diabetes
[1:01:38] you're battling all these things and the
[1:01:40] devil has you even doubting the very
[1:01:42] walk of God and tells you you're not
[1:01:44] even going to make a rapture
[1:01:46] yeah does he ever tell you that
[1:01:48] because he has told me that you're not
[1:01:50] going to make a Rapture when all of hell
[1:01:52] is stacked against you like that look at
[1:01:54] the Devil and say devil you're a liar
[1:01:57] double you're a liar because I know one
[1:02:00] who's caught alongside me to help I know
[1:02:03] an advocate today
[1:02:06] I know an advocate who fights my battles
[1:02:08] and he's never lost a war
[1:02:12] Psalms 46 says that God is our strength
[1:02:15] and our refuge a very present help in a
[1:02:18] time of
[1:02:19] trouble
[1:02:21] what do we have to fear
[1:02:23] or ours are worries our worries why are
[1:02:25] we why do we fear
[1:02:29] Prophet says who is this Spirit then
[1:02:31] what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ in
[1:02:33] you the comforter the Holy Spirit and
[1:02:36] when the comforter has come he will do
[1:02:39] the very same thing that I've done while
[1:02:41] the comforter is in me
[1:02:43] he said I'll pray the father and he'll
[1:02:45] give you a comforter you know the
[1:02:47] comforter the world don't know him
[1:02:50] you see I said there's something
[1:02:51] different about a Christian and a bride
[1:02:59] not everybody knows this comforter
[1:03:03] because that comforter is the Holy
[1:03:05] Spirit
[1:03:06] there's Christians
[1:03:08] there's Christians Christians Brides
[1:03:10] brides churches churches
[1:03:16] but without that Holy Spirit
[1:03:18] you can't have that relationship with
[1:03:20] that comforter the one who comes
[1:03:22] alongside you to help the one who's
[1:03:25] there in the ever-present time of
[1:03:27] trouble and need
[1:03:30] he says listen
[1:03:31] you know the comfort of the world don't
[1:03:33] know him never will but you know him
[1:03:36] because he dwells now with
[1:03:41] you
[1:03:43] you
[1:03:45] Jesus speaking he said I shall be in you
[1:03:48] there you are that's the comforter shall
[1:03:51] be in you I will not leave you
[1:03:52] comfortless he said now that's the
[1:03:55] comforter that's the Holy Ghost
[1:03:58] so brothers and sisters we have an
[1:04:00] advocate this morning
[1:04:04] we have an advocate this morning that
[1:04:07] Holy Ghost Advocates us there for us to
[1:04:09] fight our battles
[1:04:11] yes and a quarter long you have
[1:04:13] attorneys you have a prosecutor and a
[1:04:15] defense attorney
[1:04:18] I don't need a prosecutor
[1:04:23] he's already out for me
[1:04:27] he's already prosecuted he's already
[1:04:28] pressing charges he's already making
[1:04:30] accusations
[1:04:32] but what I have need of as a defense
[1:04:34] attorney I have an advocate that says
[1:04:36] I'm your defense attorney I'll plea for
[1:04:39] you I love you I defend you I'll
[1:04:41] overcome sin for you and I'm going to
[1:04:43] place Holiness in you
[1:04:46] Holiness you made them you may message
[1:04:49] people can still have holiness
[1:04:52] you ain't message people can still run
[1:04:54] and shout and clap and praise and and
[1:04:59] are you kidding me yes God said I'm your
[1:05:02] Advocate I live in you I'll dwell in you
[1:05:04] I will be your holiness
[1:05:09] let me tell you this may hurt a little
[1:05:12] bit this may sting some
[1:05:14] if it does it does
[1:05:16] but let me tell you this this Advocate
[1:05:18] I'm talking about this this Holy Ghost
[1:05:21] this power and this Authority that I'm
[1:05:22] talking about and fixing to illustrate
[1:05:24] it's not for the weekend warrior
[1:05:28] oh
[1:05:32] it's not for the fair weather Christian
[1:05:36] no no that's not who this is for
[1:05:39] it's not for the person who just shows
[1:05:41] up when I feel like it
[1:05:43] it's not for the person that that you
[1:05:46] know you don't get the kind of overcome
[1:05:47] power
[1:05:48] you don't get that overcoming power if
[1:05:50] you don't have enough strength to come
[1:05:51] to church just cause you're tired on
[1:05:52] Wednesday night
[1:05:57] um
[1:06:01] well
[1:06:03] it's not for that Christian that says
[1:06:05] well Sunday Sunday morning is all I need
[1:06:10] thank you
[1:06:16] Your Average churchgoer
[1:06:20] anything else matters
[1:06:22] jobs matter Money Matters cars matter
[1:06:25] fun matters ripping and running matters
[1:06:28] but when it comes to the house of God
[1:06:30] I'm just too tired I can't do this
[1:06:33] man I had to work all day today and I
[1:06:35] had to fix supper for the youngins and
[1:06:37] man
[1:06:39] I just need to kick my feet up God
[1:06:41] understands
[1:06:42] he knows I'm tired
[1:06:48] it's not for the Christian who can't
[1:06:51] come to church because everything's not
[1:06:52] just right
[1:06:56] the music's just not right the song
[1:06:58] leader just ain't right the preacher
[1:07:00] ain't right the temperature ain't right
[1:07:01] the Hypocrites ain't right
[1:07:07] I can't go to church because brother
[1:07:08] so-and-so goes there
[1:07:11] you ain't got it buddy
[1:07:13] [Applause]
[1:07:14] you're missing it
[1:07:16] you need to find a place where you don't
[1:07:18] get on your prayer bones get on your
[1:07:20] knees and say God let me come before
[1:07:22] your throne and clean out anything that
[1:07:25] hinders me from being in the house of
[1:07:27] God
[1:07:28] if it's job if it's family if it's wife
[1:07:31] get your house in order
[1:07:40] you know we could all come up with a
[1:07:42] million reasons
[1:07:44] and excuses
[1:07:46] not to be here
[1:07:52] amen if it's a problem with the church
[1:07:54] go to your pastor
[1:07:57] no that's what he's there for he's your
[1:08:00] he's your leader he's your guys
[1:08:03] when you got a problem if you got a
[1:08:05] problem with this brother and you can't
[1:08:06] work it out and it's just hindering and
[1:08:08] festering on you go to the pastor and
[1:08:09] say brother Butler I just got to talk to
[1:08:11] you about this
[1:08:13] this is hindering my walk with God
[1:08:15] because of this
[1:08:17] am I wrong or what do I need to do
[1:08:23] you asked a question you better be ready
[1:08:25] for an answer
[1:08:27] it may not be the answer you like
[1:08:32] but if we believe he's LED man of God to
[1:08:35] be here
[1:08:37] that's who we ought to go to
[1:08:43] boy something's just pulling at me here
[1:08:45] somebody's pulling at me
[1:08:51] I just wonder if brother Byler come up
[1:08:53] here we just all agreed he's the lead
[1:08:54] man of God to be in this in this in this
[1:08:57] town he's our leader he's he's our God
[1:08:59] he's he's trying to get every one of us
[1:09:01] every single one of you here he wants to
[1:09:03] see you in that rapture
[1:09:05] that's his goal that's his mission God
[1:09:07] is placing the desire on his heart to
[1:09:09] say I've got to get these people ready
[1:09:10] to go
[1:09:12] so what would happen if he said I want
[1:09:14] to have 10 nights of service
[1:09:20] that's that's mild compared to what used
[1:09:22] to happen six eight nine ten weeks
[1:09:27] every night not missing a service I
[1:09:29] wonder how many pews how many people how
[1:09:31] many how many Tails will be setting to
[1:09:32] infuse
[1:09:37] well you got that for free
[1:09:43] how can we be ambassadors
[1:09:45] and representatives for Christ if all we
[1:09:48] find ourselves doing is murmuring and
[1:09:51] complaining
[1:09:53] and finding fault holding grudges laying
[1:09:57] out a church
[1:10:00] praise God I'm filled with the Holy
[1:10:03] Ghost I can't stand that brother
[1:10:05] God don't like him either I know he
[1:10:07] don't because I don't like him
[1:10:10] righteous
[1:10:15] brother Brown said the enemy will come
[1:10:18] the enemy will come
[1:10:20] and when he does
[1:10:24] what's he say there
[1:10:26] cling
[1:10:27] cling that much closer together
[1:10:33] why is it so easy to go take part of
[1:10:35] things that's out in the world
[1:10:38] but it's hard to get together to have a
[1:10:40] fellowship
[1:10:42] with Believers of like Precious faith
[1:10:49] cling
[1:10:50] more close together
[1:10:53] and the one that the devil is using for
[1:10:55] your enemy will either get out
[1:10:58] or he'll come in and be one of you
[1:11:01] so you mean to tell me
[1:11:03] that guy that I can't stand I've got to
[1:11:06] be even nicer to him
[1:11:08] I've got to be kinder to him I've got to
[1:11:11] display more Christianity to him than I
[1:11:13] do the brothers that I love how am I
[1:11:15] going to do that God
[1:11:19] the comforter
[1:11:22] the comforter
[1:11:26] he says well now
[1:11:28] God wants us as a body of Believers to
[1:11:31] stay right exactly with one another
[1:11:34] write that with one another
[1:11:42] I'm gonna tell on myself
[1:11:44] I know more about people in my community
[1:11:46] than I know about some of you in this
[1:11:48] church
[1:11:52] does that make it right I know
[1:11:57] but if we're in an hour when the enemy's
[1:11:59] coming in
[1:12:00] this flood of evil is come don't you
[1:12:03] think we might ought to put our arms
[1:12:05] around each other a little closer
[1:12:07] don't you think we might ought to say
[1:12:09] hey bring your Holy Ghost lick a holy
[1:12:12] ghost over here
[1:12:14] and let's meet
[1:12:16] everybody meet on Wednesday night
[1:12:19] and let's just see what God will really
[1:12:21] do when this look of fire and Slick of
[1:12:24] fire and that lick of fire and this
[1:12:25] liquor fire all come together it's gonna
[1:12:28] be a hot one in here when the fire burns
[1:12:31] like that
[1:12:34] cling together
[1:12:36] here's the quote nobody likes the home
[1:12:39] go the home stairs they don't like this
[1:12:41] one
[1:12:42] don't stay home
[1:12:44] if God is in your heart you can't hardly
[1:12:48] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[1:12:51] and get in there to fellowship with your
[1:12:53] brother it didn't say you can't hardly
[1:12:55] wait to start your boat and go to the
[1:12:56] lake on Sunday
[1:12:59] it didn't say you can't hardly wait to
[1:13:01] get to the baseball field on Sunday for
[1:13:03] junior to play and travel ball
[1:13:08] I've been there I know
[1:13:10] and I know the feeling when you think
[1:13:11] man I gotta sacrifice Church
[1:13:14] or my kids
[1:13:16] my kids going to be the one that can't
[1:13:18] go to the ball game because his Holiness
[1:13:20] Daddy
[1:13:21] pulls him out and he's got to go to
[1:13:23] church
[1:13:24] I've been there
[1:13:26] I ain't always made the right decision
[1:13:31] but I can be honest about it
[1:13:34] I don't want to make that this is the
[1:13:36] wrong decision again
[1:13:40] anytime the doors are open you want to
[1:13:42] be in there and get in there and
[1:13:43] fellowship with your brothers and he
[1:13:45] says if you don't feel that way it's
[1:13:46] time to go to praying
[1:13:49] he said the Bible exhorted us much more
[1:13:54] gather as you see the day approaching
[1:14:01] love one another
[1:14:04] assemble yourselves in Heavenly places
[1:14:08] listen now this is important if the
[1:14:11] brother you think he's a little wrong or
[1:14:13] the sister
[1:14:15] say Lord don't ever let me take a root
[1:14:17] of bitterness
[1:14:20] if you want something to destroy your
[1:14:22] life
[1:14:24] let a little rude bitterness spring up
[1:14:27] you'll start seeing every little fault
[1:14:31] every little failure
[1:14:33] every little thing that you can possibly
[1:14:35] see the devil will will highlight it and
[1:14:38] put it under a magnifying glass and
[1:14:40] you'll see that Brother In a Different
[1:14:41] Light you'll see that sister in a
[1:14:43] different life for the rest of your life
[1:14:44] until you get to the altar
[1:14:48] bitterness
[1:14:49] hatred
[1:14:51] jealousy it begins to grow
[1:15:03] he says I'm an ambassador of Christ
[1:15:07] has Authority
[1:15:09] the ambassadors
[1:15:11] got the the power that's on the throne
[1:15:14] he says listen to this
[1:15:16] as long as as long as that exists
[1:15:20] talking about fear and trembling and
[1:15:23] wondering what will happen wondering and
[1:15:25] wondering this and wondering that and
[1:15:28] and
[1:15:29] doubting if things will happen if the
[1:15:31] power of God he said as long as you got
[1:15:33] that as long as that exists the church
[1:15:35] can never stand upright
[1:15:39] you could come to church every every
[1:15:41] time the doors open
[1:15:42] but if you don't realize who this Holy
[1:15:44] Ghost is and the power that lays within
[1:15:46] it
[1:15:48] you can't stand upright
[1:15:52] he says when we talk every talk of fear
[1:15:54] is vanished the holy spirit is
[1:15:57] completely in control of the church then
[1:15:59] all fears are gone and that church has
[1:16:02] the power he says it has everything that
[1:16:04] heaven owns behind them
[1:16:10] you talking about a powerful group of
[1:16:12] people
[1:16:13] when we get to a place that we have no
[1:16:16] more fear no more doubts and we know
[1:16:18] exactly who we are and we're living with
[1:16:19] our lives filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:22] that means that all of Heaven everything
[1:16:24] that heaven owns all the streets of God
[1:16:27] all the crystal Rivers all the Seas all
[1:16:29] the love
[1:16:31] can you imagine that perfect love
[1:16:34] that we're striving for it'll stand
[1:16:37] behind you
[1:16:40] we become a new creature
[1:16:42] we become a new creation something has
[1:16:45] changed
[1:16:47] because it's no longer us speaking
[1:16:50] but it's God
[1:16:55] he's a Christ
[1:16:57] you go into all the world you are my
[1:16:59] Witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:17:02] to you that's what a witness is it's an
[1:17:04] ambassador it's a witness the whole
[1:17:07] powers of Heaven is right in your hands
[1:17:11] can you handle it
[1:17:15] ask yourself
[1:17:17] are we at a place that we can handle
[1:17:19] that
[1:17:20] can we handle the whole powers of Heaven
[1:17:24] in our hands
[1:17:26] because it's there
[1:17:29] I didn't say that he said that
[1:17:33] either you believe it or you don't
[1:17:35] you can take it up with him on the other
[1:17:37] side
[1:17:39] but he said that all the power of Heaven
[1:17:42] is in your hands why do we set why is
[1:17:45] the church Barren why is it doing it
[1:17:47] because we don't recognize these things
[1:17:51] it's so easy
[1:17:53] so easy to get caught up in the thing
[1:17:56] round
[1:17:58] the church just becomes humdrum
[1:18:02] I gotta go oh no it's Wednesday I forgot
[1:18:06] we got carry in I forgot it's communion
[1:18:10] I guess I'm gonna get out of here
[1:18:16] but let's look at what the powers
[1:18:18] can do and what the power of God can do
[1:18:21] in the hands of his believers
[1:18:24] still got some time
[1:18:28] are you with me
[1:18:30] no
[1:18:32] we look here and we say Noah Noah was
[1:18:34] just a farmer
[1:18:36] many times we fail to realize how our
[1:18:39] insignificant lives
[1:18:41] are just like the insignificant lives of
[1:18:43] those in the Bible
[1:18:45] and here's Noah just an everyday farmer
[1:18:48] who goes up gets up in the morning fixes
[1:18:50] his breakfast he gets his eggs his ham
[1:18:51] and bacon his biscuits goes out Till's
[1:18:54] the field works all day
[1:18:57] but the promises there come a time that
[1:18:59] that man had to come to a place of
[1:19:01] purpose
[1:19:04] he had to come to a place of purpose and
[1:19:07] he said it's something that would change
[1:19:09] him anytime a man meets God he will
[1:19:12] never be the same once he meets God and
[1:19:16] here's Noah out working praise the Lord
[1:19:19] here's Noah out working till in the
[1:19:22] fields and God comes to him and says
[1:19:24] I've got a purpose for you
[1:19:27] what do you want me to raise more corn
[1:19:29] if we're not putting enough up in the in
[1:19:31] the crib uh what we don't need to raise
[1:19:33] more wheat what do I need to do God
[1:19:35] no I need you to build a boat
[1:19:38] a big boat
[1:19:40] a boat
[1:19:42] what do I need to build a boat for
[1:19:45] well you say no it's going to rain
[1:19:49] what's rain
[1:19:53] there never had been any moisture on the
[1:19:56] Earth
[1:19:57] no rain had ever fallen there was not
[1:20:00] even the word rain spoken to that time
[1:20:05] what's your name
[1:20:07] just build the boat
[1:20:11] so like I said what we have to do we
[1:20:13] have to realize that the things in this
[1:20:16] world really don't matter
[1:20:18] so Noah spends the next several years
[1:20:23] pounding away on a boat
[1:20:27] he's not worried about farming he's not
[1:20:29] worried about cattle he's not worried
[1:20:31] about pigs he's not worried about
[1:20:32] chickens he's not worried corn wheat
[1:20:34] grain he's pounding on a boat and I say
[1:20:36] look at you you're crazy man you're
[1:20:37] going to lose everything you've got what
[1:20:39] are you doing well I'm building a boat
[1:20:42] why are you building a boat
[1:20:45] because God says it's gonna rain
[1:20:53] what language is God speaking Noah
[1:20:55] because I've never even heard that word
[1:20:59] tell us Noah what is rain I don't know
[1:21:03] when's it coming I don't know
[1:21:06] is there going to be a Rapture yes it is
[1:21:11] is there coming away yes there is
[1:21:14] there's going to be a going away yes
[1:21:16] there is when is it I don't know God
[1:21:18] said it
[1:21:20] and Noah stands here under the anointing
[1:21:23] of God and he's building this boat over
[1:21:25] and over day after day pounding away at
[1:21:27] this boat
[1:21:29] a man of insignificance inspired by God
[1:21:38] here we got David
[1:21:41] here's David this
[1:21:43] ready little fella to be anointed king
[1:21:48] Samuel goes down here and he
[1:21:51] he Samuel gets a word from the Lord
[1:21:55] and the Lord says go down to the house
[1:21:56] of Jesse
[1:21:58] and he's got some boys down there and my
[1:22:01] next anointed king is in that house
[1:22:04] I'll let you know when when you find him
[1:22:07] so he goes down there says well how am I
[1:22:09] going to do this God they'll they'll
[1:22:11] persecute me when they find out what I'm
[1:22:13] doing when i'm trying to overthrow King
[1:22:15] Saul he said we'll go there and make a
[1:22:17] sacrifice go to the house of Jesse tell
[1:22:18] him you're making a sacrifice and then
[1:22:20] look for this anointed the one we're
[1:22:22] going to anoint King
[1:22:24] a little bit of
[1:22:25] wisdom there trickery whatever you want
[1:22:27] to call it God knows what he's doing
[1:22:29] so Jesse had our Samuel heads out down
[1:22:32] there to Jesse's house and he starts
[1:22:34] going through and he says I'm here to
[1:22:35] look at all these boys I'm going to
[1:22:37] anoint one God told me to anoint one of
[1:22:40] your boys Jesse
[1:22:41] as king
[1:22:44] the anointed man of God
[1:22:49] you know how proud Jesse must have felt
[1:22:53] throw them shoulders back it's good to
[1:22:56] see you Samuel
[1:22:57] come on in
[1:23:01] here's my boys
[1:23:04] one by one by one by one
[1:23:08] they're being looked at
[1:23:11] Samuel then comes down there to his
[1:23:13] oldest iliab
[1:23:16] and he says this has got to be the one
[1:23:19] he looks like a king
[1:23:22] he acts like an ID he's fit like a king
[1:23:27] he's muscular he's tall he's handsome he
[1:23:30] looks like a leader
[1:23:32] this man can replace Saul
[1:23:40] you know Samuel made a mistake by
[1:23:42] judging eliabs basis on his appearance
[1:23:47] because
[1:23:48] they had already made a mistake of
[1:23:50] picking one king based on his appearance
[1:23:53] Saul was a mistake
[1:23:57] Saul was chosen because he looked the
[1:23:59] part he acted the part he he looked like
[1:24:01] he could be a leader and he could lead
[1:24:03] people he was favored amongst people he
[1:24:05] stepped in there and God said this is
[1:24:06] not the man of the hour for me
[1:24:11] but Samuel looks at this guy he lives
[1:24:13] and says I think this was the
[1:24:14] replacement God says Samuel Samuel
[1:24:16] Samuel
[1:24:19] you're looking through the wrong set of
[1:24:21] eyes
[1:24:23] you're looking with what man looks at
[1:24:28] can be
[1:24:30] you're looking at what man looks at I
[1:24:32] want you to look at what I'm looking
[1:24:34] through ask him if he's got any more
[1:24:36] boys
[1:24:39] Jesse
[1:24:42] I just stopped feeling that this is the
[1:24:45] this is the way we ought to go here
[1:24:48] do you have any more boys
[1:24:51] oh well
[1:24:55] he ain't much of a man
[1:24:57] boys right
[1:24:59] he's out there with the Sheep
[1:25:01] you know he never even called his name
[1:25:04] didn't even recognize him by name
[1:25:08] he's out there tending to the Sheep he
[1:25:10] stays out there all day he don't know
[1:25:12] nothing about leadership he don't know
[1:25:14] nothing about
[1:25:15] anything he just sits out there all day
[1:25:18] all day after day after day talking to
[1:25:21] those sheep
[1:25:23] and talking to God
[1:25:25] he does what
[1:25:30] I said he sets up there all he can talk
[1:25:32] about is God how much he loves God and
[1:25:34] how much he loves nature and how much he
[1:25:36] loves the goodness of God and the things
[1:25:37] that God does for him that's not all
[1:25:39] that boy can do is talk about God
[1:25:42] I want to see him
[1:25:44] bring him in here let me talk to him for
[1:25:46] a minute oh no we're not gonna bring him
[1:25:47] I won't sit down Jesse till he comes in
[1:25:50] this house
[1:25:52] and Samuel sits there it's bold and bold
[1:25:55] sits there and says I want to see this
[1:25:57] boy
[1:25:58] and here comes David brothers and
[1:26:01] sisters we may not be the most
[1:26:03] intellectual people
[1:26:04] we may not be the most well thought of
[1:26:06] people in our own family circles we may
[1:26:09] not have any Prestige any notoriety any
[1:26:12] fame or Fortune but when God is in it
[1:26:15] little is much and here's little Davis
[1:26:19] this Ruddy little fella has now been
[1:26:21] called up there and he's looking before
[1:26:23] him and Samuel's looking at him and says
[1:26:25] David you look nice
[1:26:29] but you don't look like a king
[1:26:34] he didn't look the part of a king
[1:26:37] 10 to 14 years old they say
[1:26:42] and Samuel is going to say this is our
[1:26:44] next anointed king
[1:26:48] you're a nice looking boy David
[1:26:55] and the Lord said Samuel
[1:26:57] arise
[1:27:00] arise and anoint him he is he is the one
[1:27:05] arise and anoint him he is the one see
[1:27:08] God's choice of David was we don't have
[1:27:10] to quit our jobs
[1:27:13] he was 10 years old
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:16] a lot of times we think if we're going
[1:27:17] to do anything for Christ we got to go
[1:27:19] to the extreme
[1:27:20] oh I can't do I can't go I can't do this
[1:27:23] I have to give up this and I have to
[1:27:24] give up that he didn't ask him to give
[1:27:26] up nothing he said just be anointed and
[1:27:28] I'll take care of the rest
[1:27:30] so Samuel that comes and he gets the
[1:27:32] anointing all and he takes the anointing
[1:27:34] and pours it over the head of David and
[1:27:37] can you imagine as Jesse and the
[1:27:39] brothers what in the world is this quack
[1:27:42] doing
[1:27:44] where did he come from
[1:27:46] we thought we thought this man was
[1:27:49] really holy we thought he was really
[1:27:51] special he wanted to come in and anoint
[1:27:53] one of us King and he chooses him
[1:27:56] he's lost his mind
[1:28:02] but David has spent time
[1:28:06] David knew God David had trusted God the
[1:28:10] real anointing happened when the Holy
[1:28:12] Spirit come upon David David's life
[1:28:15] began to change under the anointing of
[1:28:17] the Holy Ghost under the anointing of
[1:28:18] the Holy Spirit and David on that day
[1:28:21] received an advocate from God
[1:28:25] are you with me David was out in the
[1:28:28] field 10 in the flock and a line comes
[1:28:30] up to take the flock and David can't get
[1:28:33] there and he grabs him by the beard it
[1:28:35] says not today Satan
[1:28:38] a boy a boy of 10 to 14 years old a bear
[1:28:42] comes to take Israel take it from the
[1:28:44] flock
[1:28:45] and steal from David and David goes up
[1:28:47] to this growling bear and says not today
[1:28:49] Satan how could he do that how can you
[1:28:51] do that how can I do that by the power
[1:28:54] of God that's within us
[1:28:56] by the anointing of God it's on his
[1:28:58] people
[1:29:02] David face is now this big filthy
[1:29:06] uncircumcised philistine that's a
[1:29:09] mocking the whole Army and nation of God
[1:29:13] boy if we haven't seen some of that
[1:29:24] what are you doing
[1:29:26] man if you've seen this guy David
[1:29:29] huh I've seen and he's cursing us he's
[1:29:33] mocking us he's laughing at us he's
[1:29:36] tearing down our religion
[1:29:39] I said somebody's gonna have to raise up
[1:29:40] to the standard
[1:29:42] and David says thy servant slew both The
[1:29:46] Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised
[1:29:49] Philistines shall be just like one of
[1:29:51] them because I serve a living God
[1:29:56] and David says moreover than that the
[1:29:59] Lord that delivered me out of the paws
[1:30:00] the line now the Paul of the bear he'll
[1:30:02] deliver me out of the hands of this
[1:30:04] Philistine brothers and sisters David
[1:30:06] was facing a gigantic problem in his
[1:30:09] life
[1:30:10] he was facing a problem like he had
[1:30:12] never seen a problem that was that was
[1:30:14] defined the whole Army of God
[1:30:17] and David is facing this how many of you
[1:30:19] can say brother Brad sometimes I feel
[1:30:21] like I'm facing gigantic problems in my
[1:30:24] life
[1:30:25] sometimes I feel like the Giant's too
[1:30:27] big
[1:30:29] sometimes I feel like I can't stand
[1:30:32] David looked at this Philistine and he
[1:30:34] goes out there and he says
[1:30:36] not today Satan
[1:30:38] not today Satan it's not going to happen
[1:30:40] today and David goes out to this
[1:30:42] Philistine and says you come at me with
[1:30:44] the sword and a spear and a shield
[1:30:47] you think that scares me
[1:30:49] you see a lot of times we let the devil
[1:30:51] get his blood thin on us
[1:30:53] that Big John had been sitting there
[1:30:54] bluffing a whole Army of grown men
[1:30:56] muscle-bound sword bearing Shield
[1:30:59] bearing armor-bearing soldiers have been
[1:31:01] bluffing them day after day after day
[1:31:06] and we allow those gigantic problems in
[1:31:09] our life to do us that way
[1:31:12] not today Satan
[1:31:16] David comes out there and he says you
[1:31:17] come at me with all this but I come to
[1:31:19] you in the name of the lord of the hosts
[1:31:21] of God
[1:31:25] this day
[1:31:28] will the Lord deliver thee into my hands
[1:31:32] confession
[1:31:34] positive confession
[1:31:37] today the Lord will deliver thee into my
[1:31:40] hands and I will smite thee and I'll
[1:31:42] take your head off
[1:31:46] um
[1:31:48] how many is willing to take the head off
[1:31:49] your enemy today
[1:31:54] I like when it says David reached into
[1:31:56] that bag
[1:31:57] and he pulled out that little Stone and
[1:31:59] he began to slang it
[1:32:03] and the more he slang at the faster the
[1:32:06] more velocity it gained until he finally
[1:32:08] let it go and he said it sunk into his
[1:32:11] head
[1:32:12] now the most profound thing that I think
[1:32:14] that I like about this story is it said
[1:32:16] David ran over to him he didn't have a
[1:32:19] sword but he said he ran over to him and
[1:32:22] stood up on the philistine
[1:32:25] you're under my feet Satan and he grabs
[1:32:28] him by the head pulled his own sword and
[1:32:30] slays his head off and says now I Reign
[1:32:34] not today Satan
[1:32:37] that's the power of God
[1:32:39] Gideon is a man in hiding he's afraid
[1:32:44] but God says God the brother Brown says
[1:32:47] God can't use a man that's afraid
[1:32:51] if you're afraid of your animal if
[1:32:53] you're afraid of the things that's
[1:32:54] hindering you and hounding in you and
[1:32:56] and coming after you God can't fix that
[1:33:00] you have to trust God and find yourself
[1:33:02] unafraid Gideon have to send all of them
[1:33:05] that was scared away
[1:33:08] God wants Heroes
[1:33:12] that's what he said
[1:33:13] God wants Heroes he wants something
[1:33:16] that's Brave
[1:33:18] he said he wants someone who will stand
[1:33:20] up and talk that's not scared to tell
[1:33:22] you or tell your boss or anyone else
[1:33:25] that Jesus Christ the son of God has
[1:33:28] saved me from life of sin
[1:33:37] we all know that feeling don't we
[1:33:41] when you guys say it then you don't want
[1:33:43] to say it

[1:34:05] clerk there we're here come this
[1:34:07] husband and wife in
[1:34:11] dress holiness
[1:34:12] and she looks at Joseph says what church

[1:34:28] here we go
[1:34:29] [Applause]
[1:34:31] I said we believe in Holiness we believe
[1:34:34] in the every word in the Bible
[1:34:37] and we follow the teaching of William
[1:34:39] Brown okay I'm out of here that's what
[1:34:42] she said that's what she did you thought
[1:34:44] I touched her with a hot poker when I
[1:34:46] said that it was a conversation over
[1:34:48] we're out of here
[1:34:51] she knew
[1:34:54] she knew she knew that name she knew
[1:34:57] those prophecies she knew the healing
[1:34:58] she knew the ministry
[1:35:02] but she didn't want none of it
[1:35:05] um
[1:35:07] God wants somebody that'll stand up
[1:35:12] Gideon now standing there
[1:35:14] The Field's been sown
[1:35:17] the crops are ready to be brought in
[1:35:19] and it says that Israel had sown the
[1:35:22] midianites came the amalekites came the
[1:35:24] children of the East even they came up
[1:35:27] against them I know who they were I
[1:35:29] didn't look deep into it but I thought
[1:35:31] that's astounding that the Bible says
[1:35:32] and even they came against them
[1:35:35] everybody's against them
[1:35:38] and they had camped about them and they
[1:35:40] destroyed the increase they left no
[1:35:42] sustenance for Israel
[1:35:44] no food no sheep no oxen no cattle
[1:35:49] no grain
[1:35:51] and they come up there and they begin to
[1:35:53] take everything and it says Israel was
[1:35:55] greatly impoverished
[1:35:57] because of these midianites
[1:35:59] and the children of Israel Cried unto
[1:36:02] the Lord
[1:36:05] and you know what the Lord said
[1:36:07] he said didn't I deliver you out of the
[1:36:09] hand of the Egyptians
[1:36:13] didn't I deliver you out of those the
[1:36:15] hands of those that oppressed you didn't
[1:36:17] I drave them out from before you and
[1:36:19] gave you their land
[1:36:22] yeah I think that I think that was me I
[1:36:24] think I'm the one that done that I think
[1:36:25] I'm the one that done that for you I am
[1:36:27] the Lord your God
[1:36:29] not the gods of the amorites and whose
[1:36:32] land you dwell I've given it to you
[1:36:39] and the angel of the Lord it says set
[1:36:41] underneath the oak tree
[1:36:43] and begin to watch the scene here
[1:36:46] and here's Gideon
[1:36:48] hiding
[1:36:50] afraid
[1:36:51] scared
[1:36:53] he's in there threshing his weak behind
[1:36:55] closed doors you know you're supposed to
[1:36:56] thrash weed out in the field and on a
[1:36:58] Hilltop so that the wind can throw it
[1:37:00] can blow away the trash
[1:37:02] and he's in there in a little low Dusty
[1:37:04] room no doubt choking on the dust in
[1:37:06] there trying to thrash sweet
[1:37:08] can't even breathe
[1:37:15] and the Lord looks at him
[1:37:18] what are you what are you doing
[1:37:22] oh my Lord if you would be with us
[1:37:25] it's something about it when you know
[1:37:27] where you're supposed to be living and
[1:37:29] you know you're not living
[1:37:32] there's a conversation you can carry on
[1:37:34] with God
[1:37:36] and you say oh Lord
[1:37:38] if you'll just give me one more chance
[1:37:42] if you'll just be with us one more time
[1:37:45] if you just just help me well in this
[1:37:48] situation one more time
[1:37:49] and get in there and the Lord says unto
[1:37:51] Gideon says surely I will be with thee
[1:37:59] and get in
[1:38:01] finds out the advocate in his hour of
[1:38:04] despair
[1:38:06] I will be with you I'll be your Advocate
[1:38:09] I will work for you I will we'll get all
[1:38:11] this we'll take all this over when all
[1:38:13] hope was lost God stepped in and said
[1:38:15] I'll be with you
[1:38:17] and you know the story we'll condense it
[1:38:19] get him now he's got 32 000 men and God
[1:38:22] said that's too many
[1:38:24] that's too many men
[1:38:26] send all them home that's afraid
[1:38:29] ten thousand go home
[1:38:32] or 22 000 or 22 000 gone ten thousands
[1:38:34] left
[1:38:37] 12 000 go home ten thousands left I'm
[1:38:40] not good at math I'll admit it
[1:38:43] now we got ten thousand men
[1:38:47] so that's still too many
[1:38:50] we need to narrow it down some more
[1:38:54] you said you'd be with me Lord
[1:38:56] I'll do whatever you say
[1:38:58] take some down by the Brook you know the
[1:39:00] story those that lapped like a dog
[1:39:03] you look you look you look you look
[1:39:04] that's the word in Greek it means lap
[1:39:06] like a dog because it sounds like a dog
[1:39:09] laughing yellow you look
[1:39:11] send them home
[1:39:15] but those that are aware of the enemy
[1:39:17] without fear
[1:39:19] I want those man 300 men to take on over
[1:39:22] a hundred thousand
[1:39:24] but God said surely I'll be with thee
[1:39:28] surely I'll be with thee so what did he
[1:39:31] do he separated them into groups it says
[1:39:33] now when we'll come together you go on
[1:39:34] this side you go on this side you're on
[1:39:36] this side and God said to break our
[1:39:38] pictures light our lamps blow our
[1:39:40] trumpets and brothers and sisters when
[1:39:41] God steps in the enemy has to flee they
[1:39:45] were scared to death they run they
[1:39:46] thought they were fixing to be overtaken
[1:39:48] and now the Gideon and his people all
[1:39:51] get to eat
[1:39:53] [Music]
[1:39:57] thank you
[1:40:01] foreign
[1:40:02] trying to hurry now
[1:40:09] sometimes God has to put us in
[1:40:11] Unfortunate Events or unfortunate times
[1:40:14] or uncomfortable is the word I'm looking
[1:40:16] for uncomfortable days on our journey
[1:40:23] there was a little girl about 13 years
[1:40:25] old
[1:40:28] just an innocent little girl
[1:40:30] an angel of the Lord comes down to her
[1:40:33] and says
[1:40:35] Hail Mary
[1:40:37] Thou Art highly favored
[1:40:40] what does the next sentence say the Lord
[1:40:43] is with
[1:40:45] thee
[1:40:48] here's this girl
[1:40:50] now that becomes favored among all women
[1:40:53] it says for good for her not to fear and
[1:40:57] God is going to let her bring forth a
[1:40:59] son and you'll call his name Jesus
[1:41:02] well that sounds pretty enticing to a
[1:41:04] young girl probably about that age and
[1:41:06] no doubt some fear and some some uh
[1:41:09] thoughts about wondering how this is all
[1:41:11] going to play out bands I hadn't ever
[1:41:12] been with a man
[1:41:15] foreign
[1:41:20] says there's a decree to go out we have
[1:41:22] to have a journal of everybody
[1:41:24] oh God says we can't be doing that
[1:41:27] so Mary you're going to have to take
[1:41:29] your pregnated self
[1:41:32] and you're gonna have to ride a donkey
[1:41:37] for 10 miles a day
[1:41:39] for 10 days
[1:41:41] and you're going to have to ride through
[1:41:43] some of the most grueling lands to get
[1:41:45] to Jerusalem you're going to have to
[1:41:47] ride through the lands that are infested
[1:41:48] with bears and lions and wild boars and
[1:41:53] bandits and robbers not to mention it's
[1:41:56] raining it's going to be a rainy season
[1:41:58] the cold weather could be moving in
[1:42:01] but I want you to think about this
[1:42:04] The Advocate
[1:42:07] was on the inside
[1:42:10] did you ever think that no matter what
[1:42:12] Mary went through on that Journey she
[1:42:14] would never go into premature labor no
[1:42:17] matter how rough no matter how bumpy
[1:42:19] there was never a dog there was never an
[1:42:21] animal a line a bear a boar there was
[1:42:24] not a bandit there was nobody that could
[1:42:26] touch her why because she had an
[1:42:27] advocate on the inside of her she had an
[1:42:30] advocate named Jesus who would die for
[1:42:33] the entire world and there was nothing
[1:42:35] out of the pits of hell that could touch
[1:42:37] Mary on this journey brothers and
[1:42:39] sisters when we find out that we've got
[1:42:41] that Advocate on the inside of us we
[1:42:44] have nothing to fear there should be
[1:42:45] nothing on this journey that hinders us
[1:42:47] or slows us down or puts doubt or fear
[1:42:50] in our lives but we press on just like
[1:42:52] Mary did
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:58] it's time
[1:43:00] brothers and sisters for the bride
[1:43:04] of Jesus Christ to stand up and say when
[1:43:07] I am weak he's my strength
[1:43:10] we hear these scriptures
[1:43:12] but we need to apply these scriptures
[1:43:14] when I'm weak he's my strength when my
[1:43:16] adversary comes up against me I have an
[1:43:18] advocate that says I can do all things
[1:43:20] through Christ who strengthens me
[1:43:22] not not my not my brother yeah I want
[1:43:24] him to be strengthened too but he
[1:43:26] strengthens me
[1:43:28] when my adversary comes against me when
[1:43:30] fear and doubt rise up God says I'll be
[1:43:32] with you even in you to the end of the
[1:43:34] world
[1:43:35] that's the promise he made he's never
[1:43:37] backed out on a promise
[1:43:39] God has never told the first life he did
[1:43:42] this is all in vain
[1:43:44] God has never told the first lie when
[1:43:47] sickness comes our Advocate on the
[1:43:49] inside says I'm Healed
[1:43:51] do you believe that
[1:43:54] it's time to look the devil in the face
[1:43:56] and say not today devil because we've
[1:43:59] got a power today in the name of the
[1:44:01] Lord
[1:44:02] let me tell you how powerful this name
[1:44:05] of the Lord is
[1:44:07] it stood out to me as astounding
[1:44:10] Peter and John go into the temple at The
[1:44:13] Hour of Prayer the ninth hour
[1:44:16] and there was a man out there asking
[1:44:18] alms
[1:44:20] they were asking alms
[1:44:22] this man had been there for years
[1:44:25] everybody in the town knew this
[1:44:28] and he says silver on the give me some
[1:44:30] silver give me some gold and Peter and
[1:44:32] John look at him and what do they say
[1:44:33] silver and gold have I not but what I
[1:44:35] have I giveth thee rise up to your feet
[1:44:37] and walk
[1:44:39] now that's power isn't it
[1:44:42] that's power and that's authority to
[1:44:44] stand where we're good you're so
[1:44:46] Anointed with God that you can tell that
[1:44:47] to somebody and they rise up and walk
[1:44:49] let's go a step farther when they heard
[1:44:51] that Peter was coming into the city they
[1:44:53] had heard how powerful he was under the
[1:44:55] anointing of the holy spirit that they
[1:44:57] brought men and women crippled Oh I
[1:44:59] thought the whole city and laid them
[1:45:01] down on cots and mass and said if this
[1:45:04] the shadow of Peter will overcast them
[1:45:06] they'll be well and I think brother
[1:45:07] Brown said every single one of them if
[1:45:10] the shadow passed over was made well
[1:45:15] that's some Authority
[1:45:21] brothers and sisters we've got a lot to
[1:45:23] be thankful for
[1:45:25] that God would entrust us
[1:45:28] to be his ambassador
[1:45:31] that God would entrust us to and dwell
[1:45:34] as an advocate and a comforter the Holy
[1:45:37] Spirit leading and guiding us
[1:45:39] it's a huge responsibility
[1:45:43] but there is a bride
[1:45:45] that's built for it
[1:45:48] you're built for it look Satan in the
[1:45:50] eye and say not today Satan
[1:45:53] let's stand to our feet we got to get to
[1:45:55] the communion service
[1:45:58] you know
[1:46:01] God has given us so much
[1:46:04] peace and joy and love and happiness
[1:46:06] forgiveness
[1:46:08] we could just go on and on with all the
[1:46:10] fruits and all the goodness that God has
[1:46:11] given us
[1:46:13] and Satan his job is to kill steal and
[1:46:16] destroy
[1:46:19] and I thought about that little song and
[1:46:21] I'm not going to try to sing it but I
[1:46:22] thought about it and it says the world
[1:46:24] didn't give it
[1:46:27] the world didn't give me peace
[1:46:29] the world didn't give me happiness the
[1:46:31] world didn't give me my salvation the
[1:46:33] world didn't give me love
[1:46:35] the world didn't give me compassion
[1:46:38] and the world can't take it away
[1:46:41] God give it
[1:46:43] I accept it I claim it now I'm going to
[1:46:46] go live it
[1:46:47] let's just bow our heads
[1:46:49] Heavenly Father
[1:46:51] We Trust Lord that the message today
[1:46:53] would
[1:46:55] have encouraged and inspired someone to
[1:46:57] step up and see that how important it is
[1:47:00] for the advocate to be in our life the
[1:47:02] comforter
[1:47:03] the importance of the scripture as as
[1:47:06] we're a vessel a vessel that houses the
[1:47:10] Holy Spirit Lord and it is important in
[1:47:13] our lives Lord that we uh that would
[1:47:17] cherish that lick of fire that's on the
[1:47:19] inside of us that we nurture it that we
[1:47:21] live for that we love you that we be
[1:47:23] like a day we did all we can do is talk
[1:47:25] to you and talk about you Lord we're not
[1:47:27] trying to be fanatical but we just know
[1:47:29] we're in the end time we know we're at a
[1:47:31] late hour and we know we want to be
[1:47:32] ready whatever it takes to be ready
[1:47:34] that's where I want to be Lord
[1:47:36] and I don't want to make I don't want to
[1:47:37] make the mistakes that others have made
[1:47:39] in the past but Lord I want to find
[1:47:41] myself ready when the time comes Satan
[1:47:44] May growl he may Roar he may boast he
[1:47:47] may mock at us he may make fun of us
[1:47:50] but Lord
[1:47:53] I know the comforter has a final say
[1:47:56] the comforter has the final say
[1:47:59] and Lord as we get ready to turn the
[1:48:01] service over to our pastor for this
[1:48:03] communion service
[1:48:04] I can't help but think about that last
[1:48:07] night on that last passover when you
[1:48:09] were explaining all this to your
[1:48:10] Apostles and Lord as we take this
[1:48:13] communion service today May our hearts
[1:48:15] burn with inside as we take this
[1:48:16] communion knowing that you went away to
[1:48:18] prepare a place for us and we do this in
[1:48:20] honor in reverence to you because you
[1:48:23] dwell in US Lord
[1:48:26] help us to be a vessel of Honor today
[1:48:29] Lord
[1:48:30] we just love you Lord with all of our
[1:48:31] hearts and dedicate Our lives our
[1:48:33] thoughts our families our jobs our homes
[1:48:37] everything we do we dedicate to you Lord
[1:48:40] and we want you to be in the Forefront
[1:48:42] the preeminence we want you to be in the
[1:48:44] front lines of our life Lord
[1:48:46] first you are a priority Lord
[1:48:50] we love you Lord with all of our hearts
[1:48:52] in Christ's name we pray amen
[1:48:57] father
[1:49:00] you love the Lord today
[1:49:02] amen can we give the Lord a hand a clap
[1:49:05] of praise
[1:49:07] he's worthy of our praise
[1:49:08] [Applause]
[1:49:26] union service if you will turn your
[1:49:28] Bibles
[1:49:29] Amen to the First Corinthians
[1:49:33] amen how many believes that we do this
[1:49:36] in honor to the Lord because he has
[1:49:38] asked us to do this as often as we meet
[1:49:40] amen
[1:49:42] and to remember what he did for us
[1:49:45] amen because everything hinged on what
[1:49:47] he did
[1:49:49] First Corinthians the 11th chapter
[1:50:02] verse 23.
[1:50:04] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:50:07] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:50:09] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:50:11] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:50:14] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:50:16] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:50:19] you this do in remembrance of me
[1:50:22] after the same manner also he took the
[1:50:25] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:50:27] is the New Testament in my blood this
[1:50:29] two years after she drink it in
[1:50:31] remembrance of me for as often as he eat
[1:50:33] this bread and drink this cup he do show
[1:50:36] the Lord's death till he come
[1:50:38] whiffer whosoever shall eat of this
[1:50:40] bread and drink of this cup of the Lord
[1:50:41] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:50:44] and blood of the Lord
[1:50:45] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:50:48] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:50:50] cup I mean he believes it's important
[1:50:52] that you search your own heart because
[1:50:54] you know where you stand with the Lord
[1:50:56] amen
[1:50:57] for he that he didn't drinketh
[1:50:59] unworthily eateth and drink a damnation
[1:51:01] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:51:03] body and for this cause many are weak
[1:51:05] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:51:08] if we would
[1:51:09] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:51:12] but when we are judged we are chasing of
[1:51:14] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:51:16] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:51:18] when you come together to eat Terry one
[1:51:20] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:51:22] him eat at home that you come not
[1:51:24] together unto condemnation and the rest
[1:51:27] will I said in order amen when I come
[1:51:29] let's have a moment of silence as you
[1:51:31] judge yourselves make sure that
[1:51:33] everything's right in your heart with
[1:51:35] the Lord before you take of the
