[27:55] foreign
[28:04] Lord bless you all this morning you know
[28:07] you read a Psalm like that you know
[28:09] run around talked many messages about
[28:12] worrying you read what God's word like
[28:15] that what do you have to worry about you
[28:18] know it doesn't take away from the fact
[28:19] that we're human you know we have
[28:22] emotions and sometimes we let our
[28:25] emotions get the best of us but when you
[28:27] read something like that why are you
[28:30] worried if you committed a completely
[28:31] into Christ's hands what is there really
[28:35] to work now again I have to you always
[28:37] have to quantitate stuff excuse my using
[28:40] big words but you really have to bring
[28:42] it down to the basics your enemy's goal
[28:45] in life is to make you worry about
[28:47] things you absolutely have no control
[28:49] over and when you and when you realize
[28:52] the sole goal is to get you to worry
[28:54] about the things that really don't
[28:56] matter
[28:57] what they do is they keep you away from
[28:59] the things that really do matter and I
[29:02] was uh
[29:03] reading that devotional this morning
[29:07] and uh I'm totally awful what I was
[29:09] going to say but if you return with me
[29:11] to Peter
[29:12] uh first Peter the fourth chapter in the
[29:15] devotional this morning I was reading
[29:17] the one I read every day the old one you
[29:20] know it talks about brother I wrote some
[29:22] bullets from it but
[29:25] yeah the scripture this morning for that
[29:27] devotional was the fourth chapter of
[29:29] First Peter and I'll read it's not a
[29:32] long chapter
[29:33] and like I said you can never read God's
[29:35] word too much if this is what Peter had
[29:38] to say but we know it wasn't Peter but
[29:40] we know it was the Lord speaking through
[29:42] Peter for us in this generation where
[29:44] we're at right now we have the very
[29:46] words that God spoke through Peter to us
[29:49] and it says for as much then as Christ
[29:52] hath suffered for us in the flesh arm
[29:55] yourself likewise with the same mind for
[29:57] he that hath suffered In the Flesh had
[30:00] ceased from sin
[30:01] that he no longer should live the rest
[30:04] of his times in the flesh to the lust of
[30:06] men but to the will of God and that's
[30:09] the purpose of your enemy this morning
[30:11] you know I don't I don't even want to
[30:13] talk about it anymore you know I you
[30:16] know years ago I would talk about how
[30:17] it's only going to get worse and get
[30:19] worse while talking about it don't make
[30:21] a difference anymore it's already here
[30:23] so worrying about it ain't gonna change
[30:25] what's going on outside those four walls
[30:27] and when he goes on to say for times
[30:31] past
[30:32] for time past our life may suffice to
[30:35] have brought the will of the Gentiles
[30:37] when we walked in lasciviousness plus
[30:40] excess of wine reveling banqueting and
[30:43] abdominal
[30:44] idolatry so Pierce pointing us where we
[30:47] came from when they think if they
[30:50] strange that you run not with them to
[30:52] the same exact excess of Riot speaking
[30:55] evil love and so what Peter's telling us
[30:58] is what all the preachers tell you you
[31:01] know that
[31:02] they're going to speak evil of you no
[31:04] matter who you are so trying to
[31:06] fellowship with the world out there and
[31:08] the age that we're living in right now
[31:10] is not going to do you any good it's
[31:12] only going to make you worse it isn't
[31:14] going to make you better and worrying
[31:16] about the things they're doing is going
[31:18] to make you far worse so you know and
[31:20] simply believe in God's word is where we
[31:23] need to be it and then goes on to say
[31:24] hint say here we're in
[31:27] they think it's strange that you run
[31:29] that with them to the same excess Riot
[31:31] speaking evil love you who shall give
[31:33] account to him that is ready to judge
[31:35] the quick and the dead for this cause
[31:38] was the Gospel preached also to them
[31:40] that are dead that they might be judged
[31:42] according to men in the flesh but live
[31:44] according to God in the spirit and I was
[31:47] this is the most important things at the
[31:49] end of this chapter
[31:51] but the end of all things is at hand and
[31:53] you be therefore sober I'll watch him
[31:55] onto prayer and above all things have
[31:58] fervent charity among yourselves for
[32:00] charity shall cover a multitude of sins
[32:03] you know the world gets worse basically
[32:06] we need to get better it's that we need
[32:08] to be the opposite of whatever the world
[32:10] is this morning you need to be the
[32:12] opposite as they get worse you need to
[32:14] get better in the age that we live in I
[32:16] mean it's pretty simple you know and it
[32:19] goes on to say
[32:21] but at the end of all things is a tambi
[32:23] you're therefore sober and watch on to
[32:25] prayer and above all things have further
[32:28] charity among yourselves for charity
[32:30] shall cover a multitude of sins you know
[32:32] that's the gospel
[32:34] and the Bible but the message of the
[32:37] hour hour that we all trust and believe
[32:39] it's just simple charity and being sober
[32:42] in the age that we is and goes on use
[32:45] Hospitality one to another without
[32:47] virgin
[32:48] and as every man hath received gifts
[32:50] even so ministered so the thing that
[32:53] strikes me brother brownham said the
[32:55] same thing and Peter's saying the same
[32:56] thing as God gives you more you should
[32:59] be giving out more it's not you storing
[33:02] everything up and not giving anything
[33:03] out so as God gives you more of himself
[33:06] you should be poor and more out to the
[33:09] people around you and he goes on that
[33:11] use Hospitality one to another without
[33:14] grudging as every man hath received the
[33:17] gift even so many of the same one to
[33:19] another as good stewards of the manifold
[33:22] grace of God I'll keep reading and I'll
[33:24] take a lot of time I was in that message
[33:26] you know it was talking about the story
[33:28] of the Hornets but I wrote some bullet
[33:31] things he was talking about he was
[33:33] saying if we as Believers as Christians
[33:36] he was talking about being more juvenile
[33:39] what he meant anybody changed and then a
[33:41] a comma later is being more childlike so
[33:45] as Christians we need to be more
[33:48] childlike and what that means is as a
[33:50] child is dependent on their father or
[33:51] mother for every good thing that that's
[33:54] given to him it's the same as us as
[33:56] Christians but if we can remain simple
[33:58] in childlike and just totally trust
[34:00] Jesus Christ for the things that we need
[34:03] you wouldn't have any worry this morning
[34:05] and the other thing he talks about it uh
[34:08] brother Brown talks about it but the
[34:11] world is the opposite it's Simplicity
[34:13] you know it's the simple things that God
[34:16] wants you to do you know read your Bible
[34:18] pray
[34:20] you know just simple things that are
[34:22] hard to do in these so there's so much
[34:24] trying to take over your time out there
[34:26] and the other thing he mentioned here
[34:29] the most important thing is and everyone
[34:31] stress stresses over this
[34:34] basically you just simply have to relax
[34:36] and just believe you just got to relax
[34:40] you just got to trust God and just
[34:41] believe that he's going to bring about
[34:44] the good circumstances that you need in
[34:46] your life and then and then all that
[34:48] produces one simple thing and that's the
[34:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[34:53] promises of God and it's that Divine
[34:56] love he was talking about in that job or
[34:58] he had that Divine love not just feeling
[35:01] of love but he had Divine love for those
[35:04] Hornets that they were they would since
[35:07] he had that kind of love the Hornets
[35:09] just simply listened to him when he
[35:10] asked him to go back into their nest and
[35:13] then Fellowship all that brings about
[35:15] one thing in our lives and that's true
[35:18] Fellowship between you and Jesus between
[35:20] you and the spirit and he uh I just
[35:23] gonna read this I was thinking about
[35:25] that this morning
[35:27] uh and I'll finish with this
[35:31] I hope I turn
[35:32] to the right chapter yeah I turned to
[35:34] the right Java
[35:37] uh it's chapter you don't have to turn
[35:39] there it's chapter 40 in job and it and
[35:43] it kind of goes along with what I'm
[35:45] saying
[35:47] you can't add to yourself you can't take
[35:49] away from yourself whatever your statute
[35:52] is whether you're tall or small big or
[35:54] wide whatever it is it doesn't make a
[35:57] difference you are what God makes you to
[35:59] be and you can't change anything about
[36:01] yourself in the National sense because
[36:03] that's who God wants you to be but you
[36:05] can change who you are in a spiritual
[36:07] sense you can change yourself every day
[36:10] you don't have to remain that same old
[36:13] lack of power lack of Charity Christian
[36:15] you can allow God to change you and
[36:18] become better than you are this morning
[36:21] but
[36:22] um it's just uh reading yeah I think I
[36:25] lost my place here I think it was the
[36:27] 39th chapter of Joe Bob was reading
[36:31] but God is talking to job and letting
[36:34] him know that
[36:36] in in context we're just one seed in a
[36:40] grain in a garnery we're just one little
[36:43] seed in a whole sea of seeds we're just
[36:46] one little aspect of it and I'll just
[36:48] read what God had to say here in job in
[36:51] the 39th chapter I won't read the whole
[36:53] chapter I know I say that I wind up read
[36:55] 40 or 50 verses but I'll just read a few
[36:58] notes thou the time this is in the 39th
[37:01] first verse notice about the time when
[37:03] the wild goats of the rock bring forth
[37:06] well cance thou Mark when the Heinz do
[37:09] calf so God's telling job here
[37:12] you don't have control over this I do
[37:14] you can't tell when this happens or that
[37:16] happened but I can and you go cancel
[37:18] that number the months that they fulfill
[37:21] or know thou the time when they bring
[37:23] forth
[37:25] they bow themselves they bring forth
[37:27] their young ones they cast out their
[37:30] sorrows their young ones are in good
[37:32] liking they grow up with corn they go
[37:34] forth and return not on to them so
[37:37] everything that God is talking about
[37:39] here is set in Aura by himself and it's
[37:42] no different in our own lives and in our
[37:44] things God sets things in order I'm just
[37:47] going to read a few more and who had
[37:49] sent out the young ones that are in good
[37:52] life and grow up with corn forth and
[37:54] return not unto them who have sent out
[37:57] the wild ass fewer who have loose the
[37:59] bands of the wild ass who whose house
[38:02] have I made the Wilderness and the baron
[38:04] land his dwellings to scorn us the
[38:07] multitudes of the city neither regardeth
[38:09] either crying of the driver I'm not
[38:11] going to read the whole chapter cutting
[38:13] a little short here this morning but he
[38:15] also later on in the chapter talks about
[38:17] the ostrich
[38:19] you know so he sets there's all
[38:22] different kinds of animals over there
[38:24] some would you think are better mothers
[38:25] other others you would think are less
[38:28] better modest but it's all in God's
[38:31] time it's all in God's planning and it's
[38:34] the same way for us this morning
[38:37] the only thing I would say is you see
[38:38] the world that we live in this morning
[38:41] you shouldn't worry about what the what
[38:44] the final result is if you have Christ
[38:46] as your savior this morning you know the
[38:48] world I was just thinking out there this
[38:50] morning as we go into another Christmas
[38:53] season or as the church is out there are
[38:56] going into another Advent season as they
[38:59] call which is nothing wrong with it but
[39:01] you know do you spend yourself more
[39:03] concerned about the first Advent where
[39:05] we should be actually more concerned
[39:07] about the second Advent or the Rapture
[39:09] of the church is where we really should
[39:12] be worried about this morning brother
[39:14] David
[39:19] loving with all your heart yes amen God
[39:22] is good isn't he
[39:24] yes he is let's stand this morning
[39:27] amen
[39:28] just appreciate the Lord this morning
[39:32] appreciate each and every one that's
[39:34] here this morning
[39:36] God he's just an awesome God he's been
[39:39] so good to us and
[39:41] I sing a little horse I Love You Lord
[39:42] and I left my voice this morning if we
[39:44] could oh

[1:05:14] the Bible said we're his workmanship
[1:05:16] created we are his new creation today
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:20] thank you for
[1:05:22] standing and honoring the word now in
[1:05:24] the book of Colossians
[1:05:27] I want to read
[1:05:30] beginning verse 25
[1:05:36] I would have to say hello from the
[1:05:38] Saints back home and from my life and
[1:05:41] even from Joel he said say hi to any of
[1:05:45] his old friends up here
[1:05:46] and uh
[1:05:48] and uh we thank God for each and every
[1:05:51] one of you
[1:05:54] 25 of Colossians 1. we're up I made a
[1:05:59] minister according to the dispensation
[1:06:01] and dispensation means an economy
[1:06:04] so God opened up an economy for the
[1:06:07] people through the prophet or the in
[1:06:09] this case the church-aged messenger
[1:06:11] Apostle Paul
[1:06:13] and God opened up an economy for us
[1:06:16] through brother Brown
[1:06:18] through the message of the hour so we
[1:06:21] have a we have a different economy than
[1:06:23] the world's got
[1:06:24] we got promises that they don't have
[1:06:27] aren't you glad for that
[1:06:29] and so we got to make ourselves a Avail
[1:06:31] to those things if otherwise if we don't
[1:06:34] go to the store just like if I wanted to
[1:06:35] buy some
[1:06:37] good old Amish stuff I'd have to go over
[1:06:40] to
[1:06:41] where is it Scottsville and go over to
[1:06:44] the Amish store over there and go in and
[1:06:46] get it
[1:06:48] it's available but you got to go get it
[1:06:51] amen so we're here today to get what God
[1:06:55] has made available to us today
[1:06:57] amen and then you know the word sin
[1:06:59] means you miss the mark Or you miss what
[1:07:01] God was offering to you that at that
[1:07:03] time so I don't want to be a sinner
[1:07:06] I don't want to be a sinner I want to
[1:07:09] get what God has for me today amen
[1:07:12] and uh
[1:07:14] so we read here wherever my May to
[1:07:17] minister according to the dispensation
[1:07:19] or the economy of God which is given to
[1:07:21] me for you
[1:07:23] to fulfill the word of God
[1:07:27] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:07:29] ages and generations but now has made
[1:07:31] manifest
[1:07:33] to his Saints it's the mystery that's
[1:07:34] been hid from ages and generations made
[1:07:37] manifest to you
[1:07:39] then then you're one of his Saints it's
[1:07:41] only made manifest to the Saints
[1:07:44] so when you look at yourself
[1:07:46] the kind of life but if he's made the
[1:07:48] mystery known to you you're one of his
[1:07:50] Saints the the revelation of the mystery
[1:07:53] is going to make you a saint
[1:07:55] amen we don't change ourselves I love
[1:07:58] what Brother David said he changes us
[1:08:00] aren't you glad for that
[1:08:02] and uh we appreciate the Lord and so
[1:08:06] this mystery that God was going to make
[1:08:08] known is this in verse 27.
[1:08:12] that God would make known what is the
[1:08:14] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:08:16] among the Gentiles which is
[1:08:19] say it with me Christ in you the hope of
[1:08:23] glory shall we bow our heads and have a
[1:08:25] word of prayer Heavenly Father we love
[1:08:26] and appreciate you it's such a joy be
[1:08:29] back here amongst friends and loved ones
[1:08:31] thank you for brother Byler and sister
[1:08:33] Byler and all the Byler family thank you
[1:08:35] for Caleb my friend who's always gives
[1:08:37] me a little room up there in the house
[1:08:39] and and uh shares his lovely loving
[1:08:43] animals with me and we appreciate that
[1:08:46] pure love that that these creatures of
[1:08:49] God have
[1:08:51] but we as people on the other hand have
[1:08:53] a little trouble
[1:08:55] uh showing pure love so we just ask you
[1:08:58] to help us have the pure love in our
[1:09:00] heart today Father and we love you with
[1:09:03] all our heart like Brother David said in
[1:09:04] the song serve his brother was sharing
[1:09:06] it's just everything that happens just
[1:09:10] makes us love him more and we love you
[1:09:12] and if we love you then we have to love
[1:09:14] each other because
[1:09:16] book said if we say we love God but
[1:09:19] can't love our brother
[1:09:21] then rely we're telling a lie oh Lord
[1:09:24] don't let us live lie let us live the
[1:09:26] truth in all honesty father we ask you
[1:09:28] for thy Glory bless your people today uh
[1:09:30] take hold of my uh lips and the gift
[1:09:33] that you put in me and uh steer it just
[1:09:37] the right direction that will help
[1:09:39] someone here today Father
[1:09:41] and we commit our life to you in Jesus
[1:09:43] name amen God bless you take your seats
[1:09:46] make yourself comfortable we won't be
[1:09:47] here long I'll just get this over and
[1:09:49] we'll have a good time
[1:09:51] uh I'm I'm learning you know I guess you
[1:09:54] know I look closer you get towards your
[1:09:55] body change and the other dimension you
[1:09:58] realize you don't have to preach it all
[1:10:00] over here uh we'll be talking about the
[1:10:02] Lord forever and forever and forever so
[1:10:05] uh you know I used to I guess with that
[1:10:07] Evangelistic call on my life I would
[1:10:09] just give both barrels 100 and tell them
[1:10:12] everything I know because I never
[1:10:13] thought I never knew if I'd be able to
[1:10:16] come back again
[1:10:17] but here I've been invited time after
[1:10:20] time and I appreciate brother Byler
[1:10:22] doing that so uh we'll uh we'll be uh
[1:10:26] we'll be merciful and gracious to you
[1:10:28] today how about that but on the other
[1:10:31] hand I'll say exactly what God put on my
[1:10:32] heart and if it if it burns a little or
[1:10:35] hurts a little it's got to uh you know
[1:10:37] if it doesn't make you sick sometime
[1:10:39] it'll it won't get you any better so uh
[1:10:42] God has to shock us sometimes even in a
[1:10:45] new birth you know you have to sometimes
[1:10:47] you have to sometimes those weren't
[1:10:49] Lively I'm telling you but other times
[1:10:50] you've got to get a little spank so uh
[1:10:53] God does you know a lot of the things
[1:10:55] we've gone through in this last year and
[1:10:57] I think maybe you have also has been God
[1:11:01] given us a little spank maybe to shock
[1:11:03] us to take a deep breath
[1:11:05] and realize we are alive in Christ and
[1:11:07] that every promise in the book belongs
[1:11:09] to us amen and we thank God for that and
[1:11:12] so we do appreciate him so I want to
[1:11:14] talk about uh the power of high
[1:11:16] expectation and we realize uh uh having
[1:11:20] said that that they're the other side of
[1:11:23] that and we want to kind of think on
[1:11:26] that line too that the sin of low
[1:11:29] expectation you know a lot of times we
[1:11:32] don't think well we know we're living
[1:11:33] clean we're not out here doing sin and
[1:11:35] stuff like that but brother bear said
[1:11:36] sin is unbelief and unbelief will cause
[1:11:39] us to have very low expectations of what
[1:11:42] God's promised us and I look around I
[1:11:45] see people with low expectations I see
[1:11:47] families I see uh married people do you
[1:11:50] ever notice that when you first get
[1:11:52] married you got high expectations I mean
[1:11:55] way up there like your marriage is going
[1:11:57] to be the best ever was this is the
[1:11:59] finest woman in there in the world or
[1:12:01] finest man in the world and then after
[1:12:03] uh
[1:12:04] how long does it take to start getting
[1:12:06] disappointed uh after a few
[1:12:09] disappointments you you lower your
[1:12:12] expectations based on your perceived
[1:12:15] reality but yet if the dream could
[1:12:18] continue living in your heart
[1:12:21] you see then you would based on your
[1:12:24] high expectation you would have to
[1:12:27] fulfill what the prophet said you get
[1:12:29] what you expect
[1:12:31] you expect to see somebody fail exactly
[1:12:34] if you expect to see yourself fail
[1:12:36] exactly that's what's going to happen
[1:12:39] amen and so um you said say you say
[1:12:44] expect to see something to criticize
[1:12:45] even in his meeting can you imagine
[1:12:48] could you how many of how many would
[1:12:50] think that you could possibly go to hear
[1:12:51] Brother Brown and preach in a live
[1:12:53] meeting and he'd be there in preaching
[1:12:55] the prophet our prophet and you'll be
[1:12:57] disappointed
[1:12:59] because but some people go there with
[1:13:02] their mind made up of what they're going
[1:13:03] to get and what how God's going to do it
[1:13:05] and he doesn't do it that way and they
[1:13:07] get disappointed because they expected
[1:13:09] that maybe it would happen that way but
[1:13:11] when you expect that God's going to give
[1:13:13] you everything you need uh you can you
[1:13:17] can be sure or you're going to get what
[1:13:18] you expect but your expectation actually
[1:13:20] brings it from that other dimension into
[1:13:23] where you live right now there's one
[1:13:26] thing to have the cure for disease it's
[1:13:28] another thing you need to access it a
[1:13:30] lot of it you a lot of times you go down
[1:13:33] to get something from the drugstore or
[1:13:35] something like that and the boys say I
[1:13:37] just need to get this medicine I've got
[1:13:38] enough prescription but once we go there
[1:13:40] in the drug stores close but you go down
[1:13:42] there and you can't get it but see God
[1:13:45] has made it available to us this morning
[1:13:47] because God knew we'd be here God knows
[1:13:50] exactly everything that's going on I
[1:13:52] believe that morning by morning his
[1:13:54] mercies are renewed to us his promises
[1:13:56] confirmed to us time and time again it's
[1:13:59] like God confirmed the Covenant with
[1:14:01] Abraham he's confirmed it with Jesus
[1:14:03] Christ he confronted it with Brother by
[1:14:04] Adam he's confirming his promise to you
[1:14:07] day by day amen morning by morning it's
[1:14:10] brand new life it's a brand new day it's
[1:14:13] a brand new opportunity and so here we
[1:14:16] are living in the past under
[1:14:18] disappointments and hurts and having low
[1:14:21] expectations and
[1:14:23] it's a sin to be like that for a
[1:14:25] Christian
[1:14:26] I don't want to say I'm a Christian and
[1:14:29] have low expectations because that's the
[1:14:31] proof that I'm really not what I'm
[1:14:32] saying
[1:14:34] amen so I think I've made
[1:14:37] that point did I hammer that one in good
[1:14:41] low expectations is sin so we want to
[1:14:43] flip that over and find out just what
[1:14:45] our expectations should be and how that
[1:14:47] God wants us to have high expectations
[1:14:48] what he what he demands of us amen what
[1:14:52] he expects of us
[1:14:54] because he's expecting Also let's read
[1:14:57] that in a scripture in the book of uh
[1:14:58] Hebrews I want to read this in Hebrews
[1:15:02] chapter oh Where'd I put my Bible marker
[1:15:11] well I think I took it out of there
[1:15:15] no problem I won't spend all morning
[1:15:17] looking for it
[1:15:20] but it said that Jesus
[1:15:23] has ascended up on high
[1:15:26] henceforth he's already beat the devil
[1:15:28] down
[1:15:29] he's already paid the one price that was
[1:15:32] the only price that could bring us back
[1:15:34] to our sonship amen because we're more
[1:15:37] than just human
[1:15:38] there will never be angels
[1:15:41] we are actually God beings
[1:15:45] put in a human flesh
[1:15:46] because we have eternal life
[1:15:49] eternal life never be down never ends
[1:15:50] it's God's own life Zoe life and that
[1:15:53] life is in you now amen
[1:15:56] Hallelujah so we're not a We're Not a
[1:15:59] Human Being having a Divine experience
[1:16:01] we're a Heavenly being having a human
[1:16:03] experience is just a time here after we
[1:16:06] go through this we go back where we came
[1:16:08] from
[1:16:09] praise the name of the Lord and uh I'm
[1:16:13] looking forward to that aren't you
[1:16:16] but I'm not only looking forward to it
[1:16:18] like it's going to be way off I'm
[1:16:19] looking for it like it's right here
[1:16:21] today
[1:16:22] everything God needs to do for me today
[1:16:26] he can do and will do if I expect it to
[1:16:31] happen
[1:16:32] amen so we do thank the Lord appreciate
[1:16:36] God's uh goodness and mercy oh I got so
[1:16:38] many scriptures we could read on this
[1:16:40] but I want to take us to Genesis 1 1 and
[1:16:43] just read this you don't need to turn
[1:16:44] because you probably know this one by
[1:16:46] heart in the beginning God created the
[1:16:48] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[1:16:49] without form and void and darkness was
[1:16:53] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[1:16:55] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[1:16:58] and God said let there be light and
[1:17:01] there was light
[1:17:03] now I did something overnight I just
[1:17:05] came back from India and I did something
[1:17:06] over there I said I told the people it
[1:17:07] was a 500 people gathered in this
[1:17:09] building came back about two weeks ago
[1:17:12] about a week ago or something from India
[1:17:14] had a wonderful time it's uh you know
[1:17:17] it's amazing that when you
[1:17:19] when I was young and just looking
[1:17:21] forward to you know what God might and
[1:17:22] then I hear I look back on all these
[1:17:24] trips overseas and and everyone that I
[1:17:28] ever went on was the best wine
[1:17:31] so this one was the best one ever even
[1:17:34] though back in August I went to Africa
[1:17:37] and that was the best one ever
[1:17:39] so it just keeps getting better because
[1:17:41] that's what I'm expecting I'm needed to
[1:17:44] get better
[1:17:45] we need to be better amen we need to
[1:17:49] have the realization
[1:17:51] of what God is amen and uh God we don't
[1:17:55] we can't be expecting God to change but
[1:17:58] we're expecting God to change us so
[1:18:01] everything that happens is part of that
[1:18:04] great plan aren't your plan for that
[1:18:05] amen like God told Jeremiah he said I'm
[1:18:08] going to hasten to perform my word you
[1:18:11] know when you look that up it means I am
[1:18:13] going to stay alert I am going to keep
[1:18:16] watch over you it means I will not let
[1:18:19] my promise fall and God's high
[1:18:23] expectations keeps him drawing from you
[1:18:27] that which he's put in you aren't you
[1:18:29] glad for that
[1:18:30] anything everything that's in the tree
[1:18:33] is already in there everything's in seed
[1:18:36] form already inside you how many believe
[1:18:38] that you were an elect seed before you
[1:18:41] even had a clue about what was going on
[1:18:44] God had placed something in you that was
[1:18:46] going to transform you into a
[1:18:49] supernatural being and yet you're still
[1:18:52] human you can worry you can cry you can
[1:18:54] suffer you can hurt you can feel
[1:18:56] disappointed but at the same time you
[1:18:59] got God's nature in you that is pushing
[1:19:03] out high expectations
[1:19:05] see when God spoke the word and he said
[1:19:08] let there be light now brother Brown
[1:19:10] describes it like this he said he
[1:19:12] pointed his finger and said there was a
[1:19:15] little light that just sprung into me
[1:19:17] and he said it flew out there for
[1:19:19] millions of years and he said then he
[1:19:22] pointed and said stop and that light
[1:19:25] stopped and said God had spoken the word
[1:19:29] and God had believed his own word and
[1:19:33] God had expected his word to happen just
[1:19:37] like he said it and watch it might have
[1:19:39] been millions of years he said but he
[1:19:42] said God kept his expectation level high
[1:19:46] all the time
[1:19:47] now I'm not talking mind over matter and
[1:19:50] I'm not you know one of these
[1:19:52] motivational speakers but I'm talking
[1:19:54] about the nature of God in you is what
[1:19:58] projects your faith and your expectation
[1:20:01] you could not
[1:20:03] ever do it but because of who is in you
[1:20:06] dude it's like we look at ourselves
[1:20:09] in America and say how could I ever be
[1:20:11] the bride of Christ how could I be ever
[1:20:14] identified with a man to the caliber of
[1:20:16] brother Branham or even the some of you
[1:20:19] all here how can I be identifier called
[1:20:21] your brother or even be to the capacity
[1:20:23] to what I would be preaching and you'd
[1:20:26] be listening to me how could I ever do
[1:20:28] that I can't do it but he that
[1:20:31] commissioned us is doing it already
[1:20:35] Amen Let me thank God for that and
[1:20:38] that's why that's why we don't worry
[1:20:40] because worry don't have no virtue I was
[1:20:43] so
[1:20:43] good bro that was a confirmation to me
[1:20:45] brother Brian God bless you all I love
[1:20:48] you all so much and my time is so short
[1:20:50] to tell you so I'll just show you by
[1:20:53] preaching the law a long sermon in a
[1:20:55] short time I'll show you that I love you
[1:20:58] I got a year of sermons I want to tell
[1:21:00] you about I just got it on my heart to
[1:21:02] express those so many things and the
[1:21:05] Lord help me
[1:21:07] to mind the clock
[1:21:09] back there amen
[1:21:11] and uh praise the name of the Lord good
[1:21:14] thing my eyes are failing
[1:21:18] they must be because I went out the
[1:21:20] other day isn't amazing I went out in
[1:21:21] the woods
[1:21:22] and I've heard about you know the deer's
[1:21:24] populations down and must pull dying off
[1:21:27] or something like that and I heard of
[1:21:28] things because of the drought listen
[1:21:29] drought we live with drought in Arizona
[1:21:31] drought is just normal rain is what's
[1:21:34] special but out here for you to have a
[1:21:37] drought nah I know it was rough and it
[1:21:39] is still rough still rough
[1:21:41] steel rough we need not just the little
[1:21:43] Dew drops of Mercy that are falling here
[1:21:45] we need we need showers a blessing
[1:21:48] I'm going to expect God's going to send
[1:21:50] it to you
[1:21:51] and I know brother Stephen he called me
[1:21:53] said brother Pray For Rain is so dry our
[1:21:55] ponds are drying up and everything else
[1:21:56] and I I prayed for rain the next day he
[1:21:59] called that praise the Lord it rained
[1:22:01] but it only rained for three hours so he
[1:22:03] said Pray Again
[1:22:05] I said with that kind of expectation
[1:22:07] something's going to happen
[1:22:09] when you call like people would go to
[1:22:11] brother Adams you know for an interview
[1:22:12] or something and they believed that when
[1:22:14] they got there something was going to
[1:22:16] happen
[1:22:17] and brother Brown said that's the reason
[1:22:18] they got what they came for
[1:22:21] the same thing with our everyday life
[1:22:22] and our coming to church when we pray
[1:22:24] like our sister saying sister who sing
[1:22:26] that song that was so beautiful
[1:22:28] God bless you
[1:22:30] amen I I clapped in the back everyone
[1:22:32] else clapses that was so sweet and
[1:22:36] through you know I can't we can pray but
[1:22:38] she prayed prayer without expecting
[1:22:42] uh it it isn't the same
[1:22:46] because you do praise because you're
[1:22:48] expecting God to do something amen and
[1:22:50] we appreciate the Lord so even God's Own
[1:22:52] nature
[1:22:54] which when you're born again it isn't
[1:22:56] always shouting and jumping and running
[1:22:58] and feeling good and you know
[1:23:01] everything's fine and you know no it's
[1:23:04] not you at all it's God's Own nature
[1:23:08] that has come into you
[1:23:10] and he if yeah I hope you can agree with
[1:23:13] me on this God doesn't never lower his
[1:23:17] expectations God keeps them way up there
[1:23:21] amen and so if you're like him which is
[1:23:24] child of God should be in His image you
[1:23:26] know we were made in His image like Adam
[1:23:28] was expectations should be way up here
[1:23:32] amen and so today that's if I could
[1:23:35] leave you with that thought
[1:23:36] expect the miraculous like we read in
[1:23:39] the scripture he Christ in you is the
[1:23:42] mystery the mystery is Christ in you but
[1:23:46] how many knows that the Bible talks
[1:23:48] about in the last days the the so-called
[1:23:50] Christians would be just have the form
[1:23:52] of godliness
[1:23:53] but you know I know when God talked
[1:23:55] about in in in Timothy when he talked
[1:23:57] about God made flesh in a human being
[1:24:01] which by the way was divinely born Jesus
[1:24:04] but he's also born in you God made flesh
[1:24:08] in you is the mystery of godliness and
[1:24:12] the church out here is the form of God
[1:24:14] in this and they're both reading the
[1:24:15] same Bible they're both praying to the
[1:24:17] same God both talking to the same God
[1:24:21] but one is a form of godliness because
[1:24:24] it's not inspired them
[1:24:27] the whole church is based and built on
[1:24:29] Revelation
[1:24:32] you can just memorize it and you can
[1:24:34] quote it and you can say it you can try
[1:24:36] to do it and how many here I've tried
[1:24:38] and failed and got disappointed and then
[1:24:41] your expectations go down down down down
[1:24:44] down down
[1:24:46] I believe my job as a preacher your job
[1:24:48] as a Christian as a parent
[1:24:50] is to build people's expectations not to
[1:24:53] push them down they already down
[1:24:55] they've already got low expectation
[1:24:59] and I believe God sent brother Branham
[1:25:01] build our expectations Way High
[1:25:04] and God said brother Thomas to do that
[1:25:06] for us too no to see but we can't
[1:25:09] just look at the person because the
[1:25:11] person is going to disappoint us there
[1:25:14] is no person here that will not
[1:25:16] disappoint
[1:25:17] now I don't expect to disappoint you but
[1:25:19] I probably will
[1:25:21] come find out recently there's a lot of
[1:25:24] people I disappointed never even knew it
[1:25:26] they were so disappointed they they were
[1:25:29] ashamed to talk to me about it
[1:25:31] you can be so disappointed or ashamed to
[1:25:33] pray
[1:25:34] you lower your expectation well God
[1:25:36] don't want to hear me
[1:25:38] God does want to hear you he said it
[1:25:40] already in his word God expects to hear
[1:25:42] from you
[1:25:46] like a sister saying good I can't I can
[1:25:49] pray I can not only can pray I must pray
[1:25:52] I must pray because I have to have
[1:25:55] something in me that can connect with
[1:25:57] God and the only thing that could
[1:25:58] connect to God is God
[1:26:00] God and God connect them brother man
[1:26:03] said you got two omnipotents that are
[1:26:06] meeting here like Martha as a grave of
[1:26:08] Lazarus when Jesus came in it was one
[1:26:11] omnipotent was almighty God in Jesus
[1:26:14] Christ the other omnipotent brother Adam
[1:26:16] said what that faith and that
[1:26:18] expectation that was in Martha's heart
[1:26:20] when two omnipotents met something
[1:26:24] happened
[1:26:25] praise the name of the Lord how many can
[1:26:28] call you and said I'm that something
[1:26:30] today
[1:26:31] time that's something that's happening
[1:26:33] today
[1:26:34] God's omnipotent promise and my
[1:26:37] omnipotent high expectations makes it
[1:26:41] happen in my life today even if I don't
[1:26:43] see it
[1:26:44] even if I don't feel it
[1:26:47] even if nobody else sees it
[1:26:50] I'm a mystery of godliness I'm not a
[1:26:53] form of God and is trying to pretend
[1:26:55] trying to put on and show the church
[1:26:57] that I'm spiritual I'm a mystery of
[1:27:01] godliness amen God hiding himself in
[1:27:04] that little room that little tent down
[1:27:06] on the inside that third pull that is
[1:27:10] the opening of the word of God to you as
[1:27:12] an individual
[1:27:13] amen so God's going to watch over his
[1:27:17] word
[1:27:18] and a lot of times Satan is coming to
[1:27:20] come around all the time and say God
[1:27:22] don't care about you because look it's
[1:27:24] not happening
[1:27:25] well what do you expect an unbeliever to
[1:27:28] say
[1:27:29] he ain't seeing nothing he ain't feeling
[1:27:31] nothing
[1:27:33] amen
[1:27:35] well I'll tell you one of these days
[1:27:36] You're Gonna feel about foot on top of
[1:27:38] his head he's going to feel your foot
[1:27:41] because the Bible said you expect this
[1:27:43] to happen that shortly
[1:27:45] the God of Peace is going to brew Satan
[1:27:48] under your feet amen
[1:27:51] hallelujah but the devil's so
[1:27:53] hard-headed he never learned he can get
[1:27:55] beat up he doesn't even know how it
[1:27:56] happened or why
[1:27:58] amen but me and you we can be get beat
[1:28:03] up we can be put down we can be hurt but
[1:28:05] then we have a reason why
[1:28:08] God is putting us through things
[1:28:10] getting us the place to where we won't
[1:28:13] sin anymore
[1:28:14] and as I said at the beginning
[1:28:17] sin is having low expectations of God's
[1:28:20] promise for us
[1:28:22] how many members you have first
[1:28:23] converted brother you thought everywhere
[1:28:25] you
[1:28:26] have Miracles where
[1:28:28] you did birds were saying indifferent
[1:28:30] everything was great everybody loved you
[1:28:33] you loved everybody and you come to find
[1:28:35] out two days later
[1:28:37] I wonder if anybody loves me
[1:28:40] but blessed be the name of the Lord that
[1:28:42] nature doesn't quit having high
[1:28:45] expectations
[1:28:47] so it was easy to change people
[1:28:49] Jesus wouldn't have had to go to Calvary
[1:28:52] it ain't easy to change people
[1:28:54] especially people in your life our own
[1:28:56] children grandchildren our own loved
[1:28:58] ones even spouses you can't change them
[1:29:00] but keep your expectations up high
[1:29:04] in God and God can do what you can never
[1:29:07] do amen is that is that too simple
[1:29:12] you are but David I think was talking
[1:29:13] about Simplicity and I think brother
[1:29:15] Brian too I think brother Thomas
[1:29:17] mentioned it back there
[1:29:18] so you wouldn't expect me to be
[1:29:21] complicated today then
[1:29:23] would you
[1:29:24] amen
[1:29:27] you would expect me to get on with my
[1:29:28] sermon though and get it over right so
[1:29:31] God bless you amen so God is staying
[1:29:35] alert he's keeping watch over and he's
[1:29:39] not going to let his promise fall
[1:29:42] amen uh and his high expectations
[1:29:47] stayed High until the promise
[1:29:49] materialized
[1:29:51] and that's the same way in our life this
[1:29:53] Rapture promise we'll materialize in US
[1:29:55] brother bam said as we feed on the word
[1:29:58] write that word that you feed on
[1:30:01] how does that body change happen he said
[1:30:03] that body forms around that word that
[1:30:07] you have become inside of you amen
[1:30:11] blessed be the name of the Lord so I
[1:30:14] want to become the word I skipped this
[1:30:16] little thought and I was talking about
[1:30:17] thinking about these deer I got on that
[1:30:18] and I got off of it but looking around I
[1:30:21] said boy how do they do it
[1:30:23] every deer I saw was healthy
[1:30:27] and happy until he met me
[1:30:30] then the Lord blessed us with venison
[1:30:32] again I thought you know here coming out
[1:30:34] here I'm just
[1:30:35] something you know it wasn't going to be
[1:30:37] good and even Brother Brad thank God he
[1:30:40] was so he was so expecting me to see
[1:30:43] that that nice doe that lord gave me us
[1:30:46] while I was praying for I was expecting
[1:30:48] it and then it just you know didn't work
[1:30:50] out it was over at both Austin's and it
[1:30:52] was just little guys and little gals and
[1:30:55] it wasn't it wasn't the one I was
[1:30:57] looking for for me I'm a meat Hunter I'm
[1:30:59] not coming here and shoot the horns that
[1:31:01] you want you get the horns I'd never
[1:31:03] found a way to boil them to get them
[1:31:04] soft enough to eat I like the food
[1:31:07] you can have them but then on the other
[1:31:09] hand I got to have a disclaimer on that
[1:31:13] I don't know if I could hold myself back
[1:31:14] if I saw the monster okay
[1:31:17] so careful if you put me on your farm
[1:31:19] I'll try to have integrity
[1:31:21] I think I did the other day and I waited
[1:31:23] Brother Brad I called him just Beth just
[1:31:25] for dark he said brother tell you just
[1:31:27] be patient that's sitting there nothing
[1:31:30] happening squirrels were all around I
[1:31:31] think they got a nest above that thing
[1:31:33] that little Hut there and a below it and
[1:31:35] everywhere else and uh I see in the old
[1:31:39] days I would just jumped out and try to
[1:31:40] run around the woods and probably
[1:31:41] spooked everything in the country and
[1:31:43] brother Urban remember those days
[1:31:45] don't let by the cat around the hunting
[1:31:48] Woods because everything's going to run
[1:31:51] but this time he just said be patient
[1:31:53] it'll happen oh I love that that's
[1:31:57] encouraging too you know and you know
[1:31:59] somebody has expectation when yours have
[1:32:02] lowered down
[1:32:03] and and sure enough just around five
[1:32:07] minutes till five no one knowing not
[1:32:09] knowing brother Caleb I knew he was over
[1:32:11] it right here back behind the woods
[1:32:15] you grow some healthy deer over here I'm
[1:32:17] telling you what you're not only that
[1:32:18] you got some helpful people there are
[1:32:20] some healthy Christians here amen
[1:32:23] so if you'd like to clap your hands you
[1:32:25] could do it too I'm one of them I'm one
[1:32:28] of them
[1:32:29] I'm one of them I got high expectations
[1:32:31] even being better
[1:32:32] gonna make it through the drought it's
[1:32:35] not going to hurt us they're they're fat
[1:32:37] that there yes it was so fat I shot by
[1:32:40] the grace of God not telling nothing
[1:32:42] stories and pulpit
[1:32:44] at the I think it was within five
[1:32:46] minutes
[1:32:47] that brother Caleb got the got his right
[1:32:50] over here and they were exactly almost
[1:32:52] his
[1:32:53] we're just a little bit longer
[1:32:56] a little bit bigger a little bit better
[1:32:58] but my expectations was met God will
[1:33:01] give you what you expect
[1:33:03] and then he gave me the strength getting
[1:33:05] old as I am which you may not have
[1:33:07] noticed and you probably haven't but yet
[1:33:11] I can't walk around like I used to do so
[1:33:13] I'm thinking how am I going to do this
[1:33:15] and then it worked out to where your
[1:33:17] camera came up with his truck and helped
[1:33:18] get it out of there brother Brad I
[1:33:20] didn't know how I was going to do it
[1:33:22] I didn't know how I was going to do it
[1:33:23] by the grace of God we did it so you
[1:33:26] know
[1:33:26] just put things in God's hand just
[1:33:29] expect that he's going to be there when
[1:33:31] when nothing is working out
[1:33:33] praise the Lord anyway brother praise
[1:33:36] the Lord anyway because God hasn't
[1:33:37] stopped being God God hasn't stopped
[1:33:39] watching over his word God hasn't
[1:33:41] stopped protecting you God hasn't
[1:33:43] stopped
[1:33:45] Sheltering you he's always there and he
[1:33:48] just wants
[1:33:50] to test you by letting your feelings run
[1:33:52] Rampage sometimes
[1:33:54] just see what's really the real part of
[1:33:57] you
[1:33:58] is it the feeling or is it that
[1:34:00] something
[1:34:01] that little something that God has done
[1:34:04] inside of you
[1:34:06] like brother man when he was tested in
[1:34:07] the final test you know and he said
[1:34:09] Satan came down said I don't love you
[1:34:11] remember when his lost is it lost his uh
[1:34:15] a child now his wife and Satan came down
[1:34:19] said how can you serve a dog like that
[1:34:22] he don't even love you here I've seen
[1:34:24] you pray I've watched you pray I've
[1:34:27] watched you Satan watches us when we
[1:34:28] pray I have watched your sacrifice I've
[1:34:32] watched you I don't know how Satan gets
[1:34:34] in our private chamber but he can see
[1:34:36] when you're dedicating consecrating when
[1:34:38] you're talking to God and he'll pull
[1:34:40] that on you he'll come back and say I
[1:34:42] heard you say that to God and God look
[1:34:45] at he don't love you remember brother
[1:34:48] Brandon said he said that was my hardest
[1:34:50] test that was my lowest hour
[1:34:52] my lowest hour
[1:34:55] and he said he couldn't now Satan
[1:34:56] couldn't get me on the reason to God
[1:34:58] because I knew there was a god I'd
[1:35:01] experienced his reality but he got me on
[1:35:04] he don't love you
[1:35:06] brother bam said he had this thought
[1:35:08] coming up in his mind didn't he and his
[1:35:11] thought was coming up in him you watch
[1:35:12] how God watches over his children
[1:35:14] brother you can have something creating
[1:35:17] a wrong thought in your mind and brother
[1:35:20] Brandon was taking
[1:35:22] then he don't love me then if he don't
[1:35:25] love me notice before you say it with
[1:35:26] your mouth you've got to think in your
[1:35:28] mind and he thought it in his mind
[1:35:31] if you're going to be that way I won't
[1:35:33] serve you he was going to say that to
[1:35:35] God now listen our Prophet wasn't uh
[1:35:37] Angel friends he was a human being but
[1:35:40] he had the nature of God and he expected
[1:35:43] that God was going to help him an hour
[1:35:45] of need amen
[1:35:47] and he's that thought from his brain to
[1:35:50] his mouth how long would that take
[1:35:53] traveling at the speed of light or a
[1:35:55] speed of nerves
[1:35:57] in the body
[1:35:59] just like that from his brain to his
[1:36:03] mouth something else was there
[1:36:06] down in his heart that interrupted what
[1:36:09] was going on in his brain couldn't get
[1:36:11] to his heart God cut off God cut off the
[1:36:15] unbelief cut off the low expectation cut
[1:36:18] it off and God pushed them expectations
[1:36:22] way up there and said
[1:36:24] though God slay me like job did you know
[1:36:28] I'll trust you
[1:36:30] I serve a God Like That
[1:36:33] I serve a God that can bring me from the
[1:36:35] deepest low I've ever been in
[1:36:37] to the highest high that I've ever had
[1:36:40] by bringing raising my expectations
[1:36:43] and I find out that when I have high
[1:36:46] expectations the people around me is
[1:36:47] kind of getting rubbed off on them
[1:36:50] you want that you want that anointing
[1:36:51] that you have to be rubbing off on other
[1:36:54] people but not that down part
[1:36:56] not that complaining part that's why
[1:36:58] when you're around somebody complaining
[1:36:59] listen nobody no Christian likes to be
[1:37:01] around a complainer because they're
[1:37:03] creating that kind of an atmosphere
[1:37:05] negativity and this and that because
[1:37:08] maybe sure they're way down there but
[1:37:10] their expectations being low proves that
[1:37:13] that's sin
[1:37:15] and if you take part in all the
[1:37:17] complaining
[1:37:19] you can but if you're living High here
[1:37:22] and high expectations they can be
[1:37:25] complaining all around you and it
[1:37:26] doesn't touch you
[1:37:28] because you're on a walk with God and
[1:37:30] you're lifted up in Heavenly places in
[1:37:33] Christ that's where we belong that's
[1:37:34] what God wants for us amen Church
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:41] I don't want to bring you quantity I
[1:37:43] want to bring you quality
[1:37:45] so if you've got if you've got the
[1:37:47] quality you needed Let's uh you know
[1:37:49] let's start shutting down all shut down
[1:37:51] too but if you keep pulling you're still
[1:37:53] looking for the quality you need a
[1:37:56] that's what I'm gonna bring you but it
[1:37:57] ain't going to be quantity today promise
[1:38:00] don't have no high expectations of a
[1:38:03] long sermon because I was cleared in the
[1:38:05] back room
[1:38:07] in the office
[1:38:08] make sure that that was a a throat loss
[1:38:11] injure not a button in my mouth and
[1:38:13] I'm good I've been feared I got my
[1:38:16] clearance
[1:38:19] the Lord
[1:38:21] so thank me to God
[1:38:22] but it's just you get so much in your
[1:38:24] heart
[1:38:25] you want to bring it all I don't have to
[1:38:27] bring it all out to you because I ain't
[1:38:29] saying anything new
[1:38:31] I'm saying oh what the prophet said to
[1:38:32] us in this hour
[1:38:34] yeah that's what I love to see is people
[1:38:36] that stay with the message and have high
[1:38:38] expectations
[1:38:40] that God is big enough to make it happen
[1:38:42] in your life amen
[1:38:45] amen
[1:38:46] good
[1:38:47] yeah
[1:38:49] so never lowered his expectation
[1:38:52] you won't find one disclaimer in the
[1:38:55] Bible
[1:38:56] where God gives a disclaimer said in
[1:38:59] case it doesn't work out uh you know I
[1:39:01] won't be held liable
[1:39:03] God never put an old disclaimer in his
[1:39:05] word he just said there it is come and
[1:39:09] get it
[1:39:09] they didn't have to put a disclaimer
[1:39:11] because when you got high expectations
[1:39:13] your faith is there it's gonna happen
[1:39:19] amen blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:39:22] I love this quote the scripture that we
[1:39:24] read Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:39:27] Christ in you the hope of glory and that
[1:39:29] really means the expectation of the
[1:39:32] miraculous
[1:39:34] when you're a Christian you wake up
[1:39:35] every morning with that hope of glory
[1:39:37] that expectation
[1:39:39] of the supernatural God
[1:39:42] the miraculous the inspiration
[1:39:45] you know some people are looking for
[1:39:46] inspiration so hard looking for
[1:39:49] Revelation so hard
[1:39:52] when God comes down in Simplicity they
[1:39:54] miss it
[1:39:55] because they've lowered their
[1:39:57] expectation
[1:39:58] I've preached to people like that pretty
[1:40:01] well on a regular basis some
[1:40:03] one or two
[1:40:05] do I walk away from her no I'll come
[1:40:07] right back come right back waiting for
[1:40:10] that quality moment when they're lifted
[1:40:12] out of that
[1:40:13] see God's came down brother God's whole
[1:40:16] purpose from the beginning was to come
[1:40:18] down to our level amen God to come down
[1:40:21] to our level because we couldn't get up
[1:40:23] where he is so he had to come down and
[1:40:26] friends we gotta have him come down this
[1:40:29] morning we got to have him and he will
[1:40:31] because he's placed something in you
[1:40:33] that's part of him aren't you glad for
[1:40:35] that and he has high expectations and
[1:40:37] brother Ben said this way about the
[1:40:39] eagle you know the eagle is a special
[1:40:41] bird how many Eagles here today amen and
[1:40:44] because we know that the the the analogy
[1:40:47] there between the eagle and we're an
[1:40:49] eagle age and the message of the hour
[1:40:51] and he said oh he Likens his church to
[1:40:53] an eagle he said you are a city that sat
[1:40:56] on a hill not you're not in a valley
[1:40:57] you're a city that's set on a hill you
[1:41:00] can be seen as far off a lighted candle
[1:41:02] the church setting high with high
[1:41:06] expectations
[1:41:08] High ambitions
[1:41:10] Redman said I haven't got much hope for
[1:41:12] a pastor's church that hasn't got
[1:41:14] Ambitions to better themselves day by
[1:41:16] day year by year a church that's really
[1:41:19] a Church of the Living God will never
[1:41:21] stop and say well uh just come in I
[1:41:26] guess it's all right now that ain't the
[1:41:28] Church of God he's got an ambition to
[1:41:31] press on
[1:41:32] well I've done my part I've brought one
[1:41:35] Center this year and he got saved
[1:41:37] brother his brother Branham here brother
[1:41:40] that's not the ambition of the Church of
[1:41:42] God brother he said well you brought one
[1:41:45] you want to bring another and another
[1:41:47] and another and another we want to have
[1:41:50] high ambition and high expectation God
[1:41:54] wants us to be that way amen
[1:41:57] quoting the prophet
[1:41:58] amen you know Brother Band expectation
[1:42:01] he said in 61.
[1:42:03] it's usually expectation it's based upon
[1:42:06] a faith
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:09] somebody gives you a promise say like I
[1:42:12] had a high expectation my brother
[1:42:14] invited me said he was going to come and
[1:42:15] get me and take me out
[1:42:17] tell you what my expectations were super
[1:42:21] and the it was exactly like it was amen
[1:42:26] so we went over to a good place and
[1:42:28] I've been wanting one of those
[1:42:30] ribeye steak and I don't eat it very
[1:42:33] often because I'm a venison man
[1:42:35] but I suffer through the dry heat to get
[1:42:38] a good rib eye steak once in a while
[1:42:41] and but I don't eat them too often
[1:42:44] because they uh they're not really good
[1:42:47] for your longevity
[1:42:51] but I ain't challenging you on that I
[1:42:53] ain't challenging you I'm just saying
[1:42:55] what I heard
[1:42:56] but brother Brown said if you're gonna
[1:42:58] eat one eat one
[1:42:59] prayer and he told Donnie think of me
[1:43:02] and
[1:43:03] rare steak
[1:43:05] so I like it just as red as it can get
[1:43:08] they just tastes better I found that out
[1:43:11] with venison duper Thomas if you don't
[1:43:12] cook it well done you leave it all pink
[1:43:14] in the middle it is much more delicious
[1:43:17] and I think it's that way that God wants
[1:43:19] to see the blood all the time in us we
[1:43:23] can have some delicious Fellowship
[1:43:25] delightful times when we're showing the
[1:43:28] red amen into his presence because it
[1:43:31] was the red that redeemed us amen I knew
[1:43:34] it was the blood praise the name of the
[1:43:37] Lord grateful to God anyway some of
[1:43:39] those may be my personal opinions and
[1:43:41] that's all but the other part of it is
[1:43:44] at my high expectations was met
[1:43:48] and praise the Lord for that and God
[1:43:51] will honor at high expectation
[1:43:54] and low expectations means there's sin
[1:43:57] around somewhere so you get that part
[1:44:02] so Broadband said the major sin of the
[1:44:05] Bride in the last days would be
[1:44:06] worldliness
[1:44:08] and the whole world out there has got
[1:44:10] low expectations they got to where they
[1:44:12] just don't care anymore they're so hard
[1:44:13] they could
[1:44:15] like that woman that rubber bands that
[1:44:17] girl who rejected the holy spirit in the
[1:44:19] meeting brother said it's your last call
[1:44:20] sister and you embarrassed her she ran
[1:44:22] out of the meeting said since that time
[1:44:24] brother Benny met her on the street
[1:44:25] drunk that's flask will be skinny room
[1:44:28] it and just gone so since that time
[1:44:31] brother ma'am that was God dealing with
[1:44:33] me and I refused it and since since that
[1:44:36] time I have got so hard careless I could
[1:44:40] see my mother you know
[1:44:42] Brian hell and laugh
[1:44:44] I think that's the way the world has got
[1:44:47] they have Lowered Expectations so much
[1:44:51] that the greatest reason in the world
[1:44:53] brother Bandy put him all over YouTube
[1:44:55] brother branham's on YouTube all the
[1:44:57] time everywhere all the great features
[1:44:59] the of the message out there and people
[1:45:02] just passing by because their
[1:45:04] expectations is so low but once in a
[1:45:06] while once in a while somebody will tune
[1:45:09] into something of spark on the inside
[1:45:11] have you got that little spark on the
[1:45:13] inside that just brings you to the word
[1:45:15] you know if you have the nature of God
[1:45:17] and you it always brings you to where
[1:45:20] God is and what God's doing amen and God
[1:45:24] Is Lifting our expectations through the
[1:45:26] miraculous Christ in you the expectation
[1:45:30] of the miraculous and the beautiful
[1:45:32] that's what that means Christ in you the
[1:45:35] hope of glory Christ in you the
[1:45:37] expectation of the miraculous and the
[1:45:39] Beautiful so I look in the mirror and I
[1:45:41] don't see beautiful I see more ugly all
[1:45:44] the time
[1:45:47] a memo of it too uh realizing that wall
[1:45:51] you know by brother Ted Mr Smyrna
[1:45:53] they're getting so old we don't want to
[1:45:55] be around them anymore but thank God for
[1:45:56] people that aren't like that they got
[1:45:58] high expectations they don't look at me
[1:46:00] as old they look at me as and close to
[1:46:03] the body change amen we're not getting
[1:46:06] weaker we're getting better God's doing
[1:46:08] listen God's people say brother and Ted
[1:46:10] how can you do it because God got a high
[1:46:12] expectation
[1:46:13] that maybe this next year I might go
[1:46:16] five times overseas again because
[1:46:17] pandemics over thank God and I might go
[1:46:20] five says how can you do that why you
[1:46:22] just
[1:46:25] because one soul is worth 10 million
[1:46:27] worlds to me
[1:46:28] and if I can spark something by
[1:46:30] something I do or say and a lot of times
[1:46:32] it's not something I even say we had a
[1:46:34] family in India they came to me they
[1:46:36] drove 200 miles to come and tell me
[1:46:38] thank you and they brought their little
[1:46:39] girl she was seven years old
[1:46:42] she said seven years ago she was in the
[1:46:45] mother's womb and went to the doctor and
[1:46:47] the doctor said you got down syndrome
[1:46:48] child here this child is not you should
[1:46:51] abort this child and they said well what
[1:46:53] do we do what do we do now and and it
[1:46:56] was a little girl baby
[1:46:57] and they listen somebody said see I
[1:47:00] heard there's a meeting episode showing
[1:47:02] this brother from America is going to be
[1:47:04] there and there's just something they
[1:47:06] said sparked in their heart and they
[1:47:07] said we got to go there and I listen to
[1:47:10] most people I'm just nobody right
[1:47:13] maybe you can feel the same some most
[1:47:15] people don't realize who you are but
[1:47:17] sometimes somebody realizes there's
[1:47:20] something inside of you that can change
[1:47:21] people's life
[1:47:23] amen and that's where you gotta go
[1:47:25] whether you feel alive or don't feel
[1:47:27] like you still got to go because you got
[1:47:29] high expectations amen
[1:47:32] and uh and so I I went and we prayed for
[1:47:36] that mother I remember that very well
[1:47:40] two years later I went over there and
[1:47:42] they showed me the baby was born I
[1:47:44] thought one-year-old two-year-old baby
[1:47:47] and I blessed that little child her
[1:47:49] dedicated that little child
[1:47:51] then they come back they drove all the
[1:47:53] way they'll never forget this the rest
[1:47:55] of their life they drove all the way
[1:47:57] back said this was what they wanted us
[1:47:59] to abort
[1:48:01] this beautiful girl name is hope she's
[1:48:04] just a living doll seven years old and
[1:48:07] she just up against me like this like my
[1:48:10] own grandchild and I blessed her and had
[1:48:13] the time of our life and that family
[1:48:15] went away with tears in their eyes
[1:48:16] saying oh my
[1:48:18] we expected it and we got it
[1:48:23] amen
[1:48:25] so you can't make that lie you can't say
[1:48:27] well I expected it and I didn't get it
[1:48:28] you your expectations wasn't right
[1:48:32] God doesn't fail
[1:48:34] we fail
[1:48:37] we got to look at the Unseen not of what
[1:48:39] we see but what we believe amen
[1:48:42] right so look at it look at how it
[1:48:44] happened in heaven even can you imagine
[1:48:46] being in heaven and losing your
[1:48:48] expectations
[1:48:52] Lucifer in heaven lost his expectations
[1:48:57] he didn't think it was ever going to
[1:48:58] change
[1:48:59] he was always going to be a servant
[1:49:02] he wanted to be one of the upper echelon
[1:49:05] he wanted people to worship him he
[1:49:07] wanted angels to worship him he wanted
[1:49:10] to get some notoriety after all he was
[1:49:12] the most beautiful after all God had
[1:49:14] made him special
[1:49:18] but you know what makes us special
[1:49:21] we're able to admit that we're nothing
[1:49:24] that's what a real believer has this
[1:49:26] special
[1:49:27] he on the other hand lowered his
[1:49:31] expectations that God was ever going to
[1:49:32] give him a better position
[1:49:34] although he had the best position
[1:49:36] available
[1:49:38] right second in command brother bam said
[1:49:41] he was almost co-equal Satan was almost
[1:49:44] co-equal with God
[1:49:46] and he it still wasn't according to what
[1:49:48] he wanted he lowered his expectations
[1:49:50] that anything could get better and he
[1:49:51] got to thinking you know what we need a
[1:49:53] change around here said we need to get
[1:49:56] something a little more exciting a
[1:49:58] little daring a little naughty going on
[1:50:01] here and and then we can have a better
[1:50:05] way of life here and having that he
[1:50:07] lowered his expectations in God
[1:50:11] and now God felt that look God feels it
[1:50:15] when you lower your expectations do you
[1:50:17] think he does
[1:50:18] God can sense it God's got a machine
[1:50:21] better than whatever the doctors have he
[1:50:23] can read your spirit God discerns your
[1:50:26] heart he sees when you have dropped your
[1:50:28] expectations when your faith brother
[1:50:30] Adam could look out and see it like a
[1:50:32] light said man expectations were all up
[1:50:36] the roof your faith is high then he
[1:50:39] could also see it when a dark shadow
[1:50:40] come over when a dark shadow come on and
[1:50:43] you lowered your expectations my brother
[1:50:47] God's purpose in our being here this
[1:50:50] morning
[1:50:51] is to challenge us not to be sinning
[1:50:55] by having low expectations
[1:50:58] though God bless your heart
[1:51:00] Satan lowered his expectations and then
[1:51:03] he went into the garden and he lowered
[1:51:05] Eve's expectations
[1:51:06] Eve's expectations was Adam's going to
[1:51:09] tell me Adam's going to speak the word
[1:51:11] I'm going to have the child she might
[1:51:12] want to be a mother like any woman she
[1:51:15] wanted to be a mother God had already
[1:51:17] said she would be she wanted to have
[1:51:19] that child and Satan came along and said
[1:51:22] ah it's not going to happen the way you
[1:51:23] think Adam just Adam ain't gonna do it
[1:51:25] Adam he's way off somewhere else Adam
[1:51:28] should be here with you if he had been
[1:51:30] there that devil wouldn't he'd have had
[1:51:32] his legs cut off right there he'd have
[1:51:34] gone on his belly amen he should have
[1:51:37] done that when that devil came talking
[1:51:39] but she lowered it she got her to
[1:51:42] sympathize with his idea
[1:51:45] don't trust you Adam Adam Adam ain't
[1:51:47] going to do this for you
[1:51:49] right
[1:51:52] he lowers expectation how many marriages
[1:51:54] probably right even in a church like
[1:51:56] this
[1:51:57] have you seen you know break up and
[1:52:00] because of expectations lower and Satan
[1:52:02] come Whispering that that poisoned
[1:52:05] breath of the serpent where spring said
[1:52:07] nah they'll never change now they'll
[1:52:10] never change no they'll never change
[1:52:14] and you lower your expectations and you
[1:52:16] don't create anything around them
[1:52:18] anymore that could help them
[1:52:23] yeah and then you become dysfunctional
[1:52:28] we're all Masters Believers we believe
[1:52:30] we're all part of the Bride but we could
[1:52:32] be we could be very dysfunctional
[1:52:36] I want to be a functioning part don't
[1:52:38] you
[1:52:40] know there's times in my life I've been
[1:52:42] dysfunctional but I tell you what I
[1:52:44] needed
[1:52:44] somebody to come and create expectation
[1:52:47] in my life
[1:52:48] not just positive mind over matter you
[1:52:51] know motivational all the little nice
[1:52:53] little phrases I needed an atmosphere
[1:52:57] is that what we crave remember long for
[1:53:00] an atmosphere when he comes
[1:53:03] everything gets better
[1:53:06] when Jesus came
[1:53:08] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:53:11] so we find out even she quit waiting for
[1:53:14] Adam and she lowered her expectations
[1:53:16] and went with the devil's plan
[1:53:19] got the Devil's Child
[1:53:21] that wasn't God's child
[1:53:23] that lets serpents seed that was the
[1:53:26] Devil's Child that he put in her for
[1:53:29] having low expectations
[1:53:32] I don't carry the Devil's Child around
[1:53:34] even though I'm in the message quote
[1:53:35] quotes and stuff but if I'm carrying
[1:53:37] Doom Gloom fear doubt Darkness
[1:53:41] impossible hopelessness
[1:53:43] that's the Devil's Child you see it in
[1:53:45] the message all the time oh you got to
[1:53:48] come here here's the Messiah here's the
[1:53:50] Messiah here's listen you don't have to
[1:53:52] move across the world to India or Africa
[1:53:55] where it got away they got these new
[1:53:57] brother branhams over there who believe
[1:53:59] that they got they got a quote brother
[1:54:01] Brandon said God takes his man never
[1:54:03] takes his spirit so here they were one
[1:54:05] day and William bam came and took over
[1:54:06] their body and now they're the new
[1:54:08] William Bannon and one of them's got ten
[1:54:10] thousand people following him
[1:54:14] and the other one has got 20.
[1:54:17] because people
[1:54:18] they build up their High expertise on
[1:54:21] the wrong place
[1:54:22] high expectations on the wrong place is
[1:54:25] as good as having no expectations at all
[1:54:27] you put your faith where it belongs on
[1:54:30] God's promise not on a man's ability
[1:54:33] lift up some man he'll always if he's a
[1:54:36] man of God God will make him thaw God
[1:54:40] will make him fall so he'll repent God
[1:54:43] will put it down because that's not his
[1:54:46] Messiah that's not his answer his is the
[1:54:49] word Christ in you
[1:54:52] the hope of glory
[1:54:54] the bride's Revival is not in a town not
[1:54:57] in a state not in a place the bride's
[1:54:59] Revival is you you are the bride's
[1:55:01] Revival that's what God expects
[1:55:03] God expects you to be the bride's
[1:55:05] Revival see what brother Ted how can I
[1:55:07] snap out of it
[1:55:08] you've got to do that yourself I can't
[1:55:10] do that for you
[1:55:12] but if I can say something that makes
[1:55:14] you Ponder
[1:55:17] about doing what our sister said praying
[1:55:21] about it
[1:55:22] and doing what Brother David does every
[1:55:24] Sunday and brother Thomas does
[1:55:27] in spite of what's going on in their
[1:55:29] life you wouldn't think anything was
[1:55:31] wrong when he comes up to lead song
[1:55:32] because he's in another Channel
[1:55:35] he's in that high expectation amen
[1:55:39] blessed in the name of the Lord we find
[1:55:41] that when when these are told by the man
[1:55:44] to get the people to believe not get
[1:55:46] them to Hope get them to know get them
[1:55:50] some knowledge get them to believe but
[1:55:52] if they believe they were
[1:55:55] level will rise so high it'll Force the
[1:55:59] promise into manifestation
[1:56:02] how many believe God for that
[1:56:04] you know it's farmer knows if he can get
[1:56:06] that seed in at the right time of year
[1:56:08] and the weather permitting and the sun
[1:56:11] will shine the length of days and the
[1:56:13] moisture content will be just right he
[1:56:16] knows that seed is certified seed he
[1:56:19] knows that that's going to grow amen
[1:56:21] it's going to sprout and grow blessed be
[1:56:24] the name of the Lord
[1:56:26] if God put something in these deer that
[1:56:29] should have been all scrawny
[1:56:31] this year but this is one of the I can't
[1:56:33] believe it they're just so healthy
[1:56:35] looking
[1:56:37] and I don't know if I asked somebody I
[1:56:39] said did half of them die
[1:56:41] because they're not that many rounds I
[1:56:43] don't know but the ones that I saw they
[1:56:46] made it brother in spite of the doubt is
[1:56:48] that okay using this analogy
[1:56:51] As the deer pants for The Living Water
[1:56:54] of the brook
[1:56:55] they found water somewhere
[1:56:58] say well I had no water every deer gonna
[1:57:01] die we ain't gonna have any good hunting
[1:57:04] this year but I came over here expecting
[1:57:06] but then my expectations went low but
[1:57:08] Brother Bear I knew because they've seen
[1:57:09] 19 the day or two before
[1:57:12] thank you but I'm giving away all the
[1:57:14] secrets
[1:57:15] my secret my secret honey hole Heidi
[1:57:18] Heidi Place of the deer I've gave it
[1:57:21] away but no you don't know exactly where
[1:57:23] it is
[1:57:24] and now I'm going to tell you
[1:57:26] but he will
[1:57:28] because he wants to help build up other
[1:57:30] people's expectations
[1:57:32] God's good to us
[1:57:35] when you have something positive
[1:57:37] powerful and wonderful miraculous
[1:57:40] beautiful
[1:57:42] in you which is Christ
[1:57:46] he's an expectation
[1:57:48] of that same power Wonder might Beauty
[1:57:54] rubbing off on someone else
[1:57:58] so you know that's why Satan wants to
[1:58:00] get you so down
[1:58:02] and say I ain't going to church I ain't
[1:58:05] going to that dinner they all want to
[1:58:08] get together and dinner and I know they
[1:58:09] all were going to gossip and all that
[1:58:10] and I ain't going to go
[1:58:14] what are you trying to do keep your keep
[1:58:15] all your miraculous to yourself
[1:58:17] give all your beauty to yourself
[1:58:20] or is it you're feeling so guilty
[1:58:22] because you're so ugly
[1:58:25] oh in expectations
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:30] so God has to supernaturally come down
[1:58:32] doesn't he
[1:58:34] and Inspire his word to you do you know
[1:58:36] there's four Bibles
[1:58:39] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:58:40] words with God and the Word was God
[1:58:42] and that word is logos right
[1:58:45] the logos
[1:58:47] and that was Jesus but that word logos
[1:58:49] actually means the plan
[1:58:52] thank you
[1:58:54] God has a plan
[1:58:57] don't worry his plan will not be foiled
[1:59:02] Satan will not stop his plan amen
[1:59:05] but ambassadors four Bibles God wrote he
[1:59:08] made it clear to mankind he put one in
[1:59:10] the Stars
[1:59:12] do you ever study the Zodiac mother
[1:59:13] Brian and teach on that and I know like
[1:59:15] brother
[1:59:16] Morris hunger and he really taught on
[1:59:18] that a lot
[1:59:19] I think he's gone to the Lord is he
[1:59:21] brother Morris hungry and I think he
[1:59:22] went to the Lord a few years ago from
[1:59:24] down Tennessee Memphis
[1:59:26] yeah you ever hear him saying I just
[1:59:29] heard brother Brown say he'd love to
[1:59:30] hear Brother Morris I'm going during the
[1:59:31] seals he's saying down from his glory
[1:59:33] but he studied on the stars and it was
[1:59:36] just for me it was too much because if I
[1:59:40] got into that I'd be a longer preacher
[1:59:43] than I ever thought I could
[1:59:45] because you could go on and on and on
[1:59:47] and on forever
[1:59:49] so I just never went that way but I the
[1:59:51] thought of it is amazing that God wrote
[1:59:54] his Bible in the Stars
[1:59:56] and then he wrote another Bible
[1:59:58] that's
[2:00:00] that is the pyramid
[2:00:03] and the pyramid God hit all these
[2:00:07] mystery Secrets all these mysteries of
[2:00:09] what was going to eventually unfold
[2:00:13] to this moment
[2:00:15] and then he hid all that in there
[2:00:18] and and that was in the pyramid
[2:00:21] oh the king's chamber and the Queen's
[2:00:23] chamber and the distance and the measure
[2:00:25] of the years of time between Moses and
[2:00:27] David and David and Christ is all the
[2:00:29] pyramid
[2:00:32] God doesn't miss anything
[2:00:35] because you know people can actually
[2:00:36] delve into the study of the Stars delve
[2:00:39] into the study of the pyramid and miss
[2:00:41] the message of the hour
[2:00:43] because God brought it down so simple
[2:00:45] now the next Bible
[2:00:49] was in John 1.
[2:00:51] and the Word was made flesh
[2:00:54] and First Timothy 3 16 without
[2:00:57] controversy great is the mystery of
[2:01:01] godliness
[2:01:02] for God was manifest in the flesh
[2:01:08] you say oh that was Jesus that is me
[2:01:14] that is you
[2:01:19] Jesus came to release you
[2:01:24] is that true
[2:01:26] the third Bible is the pyramid the
[2:01:28] fourth Bible
[2:01:30] the word
[2:01:32] made flesh
[2:01:35] oh I'm so glad
[2:01:38] that I'm not just a trying to work up my
[2:01:41] own enthusiasm and Revival
[2:01:44] my own energy I have people all the time
[2:01:47] brother Ted retire
[2:01:48] you pre you pre you went over 85 times
[2:01:51] overseas I said that ain't enough I got
[2:01:54] to go another 85.

[2:01:58] 87 across across the ocean say are you
[2:02:02] bragging no oh I'm bragging on him
[2:02:05] because he put inside of me a high
[2:02:07] expectation that I might win that last
[2:02:10] soul
[2:02:12] how do you know you won't be the one
[2:02:14] that wins that last search arms nobody
[2:02:17] listen to me nobody want to hear me come

[2:02:48] them a word give them something that'll
[2:02:51] raise their expectations out of from

[2:04:13] Brad of
[2:04:14] can't follow me on up
[2:04:17] time would fail us even Paul said to
[2:04:20] tell about all the people who out of
[2:04:22] their low place
[2:04:26] were lifted into a high expectation
[2:04:30] you could just go through the Bible and
[2:04:31] every time Moses you take the woman at
[2:04:33] the blood issue the woman at the well
[2:04:34] the different ones the Miracles blind
[2:04:36] Bartimaeus the different things and go
[2:04:38] through there and see how their
[2:04:39] expectation became raised too high left
[2:04:43] all of a sudden because the presence of
[2:04:45] God had drawn down drawn near to them
[2:04:48] their expectations went Sky High out the
[2:04:52] roof oh brother
[2:04:54] this is like prayer remember that sister
[2:04:56] brother I'm told about they hooked up
[2:04:58] the meter to her when she was praying as
[2:04:59] a dying lady
[2:05:01] and they hooked up their scientific
[2:05:03] meter to her they'd hooked it up to
[2:05:04] another man which was a filthy letter a
[2:05:07] dirty Wicked ungodly sinful uh viciously
[2:05:11] horrific uh evil man and they hooked up
[2:05:14] the meter to him and it went One
[2:05:16] Direction all the way down to the very
[2:05:19] bottom
[2:05:21] because of his spirit and then they
[2:05:23] hooked it up to this dying lady sister
[2:05:26] supposedly dying but Christians don't
[2:05:28] die
[2:05:29] and she was praying
[2:05:31] and said that meter went all the way
[2:05:35] over
[2:05:36] brother Vance there was enough power in
[2:05:38] that to send a beam of electricity uh
[2:05:42] out into outer space and back about 20
[2:05:44] times
[2:05:47] inside of one prayer of one woman who
[2:05:50] had high expectations
[2:05:52] uh I could tell you testimonies of
[2:05:55] people I was in a meeting and a brother
[2:05:57] raised his hand and something told me in
[2:06:00] my heart he was sitting right behind me
[2:06:01] something told me in my heart Reach Out
[2:06:04] And Touch his hand grab his hand and I
[2:06:07] turned and I grabbed his withered hand
[2:06:10] became straight right there miraculous
[2:06:13] Tower of God tears running on his eyes
[2:06:15] he said brother I was asking God for you
[2:06:18] to do that I expected it to happen I
[2:06:21] said there it goes
[2:06:25] foreign
[2:06:28] how many times do we pass by an
[2:06:31] individual
[2:06:33] because we've got a little complex about
[2:06:34] that they don't want to hear from us
[2:06:37] and maybe they don't want to hear what
[2:06:40] we've always been like maybe just
[2:06:41] preaching at them or maybe just making
[2:06:43] them feel bad
[2:06:44] putting them down
[2:06:46] bringing the law we're not
[2:06:48] of the law we're not of the letter we're
[2:06:51] of the inspired word brother
[2:06:53] this message is not LED or you don't you
[2:06:55] don't chop people up with the with the
[2:06:57] letter of this message brother this
[2:06:59] message sets free sets people free by
[2:07:02] the inspiration of high expectations
[2:07:05] brother
[2:07:06] amen
[2:07:08] but maybe that person that we've passed
[2:07:10] by
[2:07:13] is expecting something to change
[2:07:18] and maybe you're the change
[2:07:21] that they're expecting
[2:07:23] that's all the time we put it on other
[2:07:24] people don't we oh you you did this to
[2:07:27] me me and you do this to me I live with
[2:07:29] it every day with people that are
[2:07:31] blaming somebody else for 20 years ago
[2:07:33] and not moving listen we are in Christ
[2:07:37] in you the expectation of the beautiful
[2:07:39] and the miraculous amen
[2:07:43] high expectations low expectation is
[2:07:46] really just sin
[2:07:50] amen
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:58] my lifesaver's gone let's bow our heads
[2:08:02] I brought my Lifesaver out to you
[2:08:07] that'll save your life if you'll believe
[2:08:09] it
[2:08:11] it'll lift you out
[2:08:14] we sing that song he brought me out of
[2:08:15] the my replay David his expectations was
[2:08:18] low
[2:08:19] he was looking at himself he's looking
[2:08:21] at his sin he's looking at his adultery
[2:08:22] looking at his murder looking all the
[2:08:24] stuff he did said how can I be a
[2:08:26] recipient of the sure mercies of David
[2:08:29] I don't deserve it true
[2:08:33] but God's a god of high expectations
[2:08:35] David
[2:08:37] God is a god of hide expectations of the
[2:08:42] beautiful
[2:08:43] and the miraculous
[2:08:46] to be brought into manifestation in our
[2:08:48] life
[2:08:50] now is there anybody sitting here today
[2:08:51] that
[2:08:55] would first of all agree
[2:08:58] that low expectations for a believer in
[2:09:02] this hour to have low expectations for a
[2:09:05] message follower
[2:09:07] or we say even a member of this church a
[2:09:09] part of this local assembly
[2:09:12] for a local assembly member of this
[2:09:14] church to have low expectations is sin
[2:09:19] do you agree with that part
[2:09:22] you must agree with the next part which
[2:09:24] is
[2:09:28] in you the whole plan
[2:09:31] wasn't Christ in Jeffersonville
[2:09:35] Christ in you
[2:09:37] I'm just Christ in brother man Apostle
[2:09:40] Paul
[2:09:42] brother bam said I'm not him I'm just
[2:09:44] here to point you to him
[2:09:47] I'm just a voice that he used
[2:09:53] if you'll believe this
[2:09:56] he'll prove it to you
[2:09:59] so
[2:10:02] high expectations is what he expects of
[2:10:06] us in spite of our situation
[2:10:11] in spite of the people that you know
[2:10:13] that are talking against you right now
[2:10:17] it doesn't phase you
[2:10:20] you got high expectations
[2:10:25] I should be like somebody tried to grab
[2:10:27] a 220 volt line
[2:10:28] and say I'm going to stop this
[2:10:30] electricity
[2:10:34] no
[2:10:35] they're not going to stop that
[2:10:37] electricity
[2:10:39] it's going to run right through them
[2:10:42] you're not going to stop God's word
[2:10:48] it's got high voltage
[2:10:50] high voltage this is a high octane high
[2:10:54] voltage message
[2:10:57] and it's so simple
[2:10:59] it all works down to the level
[2:11:03] of your expectation
[2:11:06] brother Adam said I've been in meetings
[2:11:11] I didn't even have to preach or pray for
[2:11:14] the sick
[2:11:16] said I walk out on the platform
[2:11:19] and the expectation of the people was so
[2:11:23] strong
[2:11:24] every sick person and every sinner
[2:11:28] was healed in
[2:11:30] saved before I even came out on the
[2:11:33] platform
[2:11:34] as I was walking out they were all
[2:11:37] healed
[2:11:39] and I got the quote to read it to you if
[2:11:41] you want me to
[2:11:42] and he said church that's what God wants
[2:11:46] every service
[2:11:49] he said Church
[2:11:51] if we met that same level of expectation
[2:11:56] God would do the same thing today
[2:12:01] I I believe that don't you
[2:12:04] maybe there's someone just an uplifting
[2:12:06] hand I'm not going to even look I don't
[2:12:07] have to I expect that somebody's going
[2:12:09] to lift their hand and that's all I need
[2:12:11] to know
[2:12:13] you want to raise your hand to God and
[2:12:15] say Lord
[2:12:16] my expectations has been way down in the
[2:12:19] dumps
[2:12:22] but now I'm getting a little hope hope
[2:12:24] means expectation
[2:12:27] amazing that they named that little
[2:12:28] child hope over there in India little
[2:12:31] Punjabi girl beautiful little girl
[2:12:33] she was their hope
[2:12:35] she was their expectation
[2:12:37] not
[2:12:39] aborted but living and healthy and
[2:12:42] beautiful
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:47] I believe that you're living
[2:12:50] foreign
[2:12:53] and beautiful
[2:12:55] and had high hopes for you
[2:13:01] God has the same feeling towards you
[2:13:03] that's why he sent you Elijah the
[2:13:05] prophet
[2:13:06] he wasn't sent to everybody
[2:13:09] but he was sent to you
[2:13:10] because he had high hopes for you
[2:13:14] brother Thomas wasn't so cute for you
[2:13:17] you were sent to brother Tom that's
[2:13:20] because God
[2:13:21] they had high hopes for brother Thomas
[2:13:23] too we need each other
[2:13:25] we help each other
[2:13:28] create an atmosphere brother Urban that
[2:13:31] quote on the token again
[2:13:33] you create an atmosphere
[2:13:35] around you of power
[2:13:38] that makes someone
[2:13:40] wants you to say something to them
[2:13:44] God makes all things beautiful in his
[2:13:46] time this may be his day
[2:13:51] this may be the day this may be the hour
[2:13:56] and then again God can do something
[2:13:59] and you never see it
[2:14:01] but it's done
[2:14:03] that's the beauty of our God he hides
[2:14:06] himself he doesn't put on a show
[2:14:08] he just saves
[2:14:10] he changes the atmosphere
[2:14:14] you're all a miniature Creator how many
[2:14:16] want to create
[2:14:17] love when you go around
[2:14:20] create Faith around
[2:14:22] instead of doubt and fear
[2:14:26] God bless you with your hands raised but
[2:14:28] is there somebody here
[2:14:30] that brother Ted this old guy from
[2:14:33] Arizona
[2:14:39] has said something that made you think
[2:14:42] and you want to say Lord I need to have
[2:14:45] my expectations raised up again where
[2:14:48] they used to be
[2:14:50] I want to get back to that place and
[2:14:52] then go onward and onward from there I
[2:14:55] don't want to stagnate again
[2:14:59] I don't want to stagnate
[2:15:03] God bless you God bless you we're going
[2:15:05] to pray now with our heads bowed real
[2:15:07] quiet in here that's okay
[2:15:10] God can do more without any noise like
[2:15:13] brother Ramsay draw God can draw
[2:15:15] millions of gallons of water out of the
[2:15:16] ocean up into the sky to send rain over
[2:15:18] Kentucky
[2:15:20] and you never heard any of it in silence
[2:15:24] he did it
[2:15:26] man has to make a lot of noise in
[2:15:28] fanfare
[2:15:29] God doesn't have to do that
[2:15:32] God just does it
[2:15:35] because he has high expectations
[2:15:37] so we're going to pray we're going to
[2:15:39] take the advice of our sister beautiful
[2:15:41] song that she's saying I can pray
[2:15:44] you can pray
[2:15:45] we can pray
[2:15:48] when
[2:15:51] high expectations pushed by faith driven
[2:15:54] by love
[2:15:58] creates an atmosphere
[2:16:01] where God can fulfill his promise
[2:16:04] Heavenly Father
[2:16:07] it's a sacred
[2:16:09] we don't go by feelings but if I could
[2:16:11] we try to describe what it is by using
[2:16:15] our human terms
[2:16:17] I feel a sacred fee feeling here
[2:16:22] and I believe that you're doing this a
[2:16:24] great work in the hearts of your
[2:16:26] children
[2:16:28] I believe that
[2:16:31] brother Brandon said when the faith is
[2:16:32] right you don't need a prayer line you
[2:16:34] don't need all the goings-on and
[2:16:37] activities that look like a great church
[2:16:40] meeting
[2:16:41] all right when that's there you don't
[2:16:44] need anything
[2:16:46] done already
[2:16:48] heavenly father I pray that you do the
[2:16:50] work and hearts today and build their
[2:16:51] expectations High because Lord we don't
[2:16:53] want to be sinners
[2:16:56] going around
[2:16:58] in this day of
[2:17:00] the mystery of godliness

[2:17:11] godliness
