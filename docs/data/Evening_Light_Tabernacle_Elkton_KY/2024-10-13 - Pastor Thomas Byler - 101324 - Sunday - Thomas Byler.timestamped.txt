[0:00] make sure you can get to where you're
[0:01] going so I told the kids listen I guess
[0:03] I'm speaking to myself to make sure pay
[0:05] attention because we get
[0:07] so so off track sometimes the devil if
[0:10] he's going to put anything on your mind
[0:11] he's going to put it on your mind on
[0:12] Sunday morning so it's good for us to
[0:15] pay attention but Psalms 37 we're going
[0:17] to go and uh we're starting in verse
[0:21] 20 but the wicked Shall Perish and the
[0:24] enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat
[0:26] of the Lambs they shall consume into
[0:28] smoke shall they consume away
[0:36] way for such as he be blessed of him
[0:39] shall inherit the earth and they that be
[0:41] C cursed of him shall be cut
[0:49] off though he fall he shall not be
[0:52] utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth
[0:54] him with his hand
[1:04] he is ever merciful and lendeth and his
[1:06] seed is
[1:11] blessed for the Lord loveth judgment and
[1:14] forsaketh not his Saints they are
[1:17] preserved forever but the seed of the
[1:19] wicked shall be cut
[1:25] off the mouth of the righteous speaketh
[1:27] wisdom and his tongue tth of judgment
[1:36] the wicked watch the righteous and
[1:38] seeketh to slay
[1:44] him wait on the Lord and keep his way
[1:47] and he shall exalt thee to inherit the
[1:49] land when the wicked are cut off though
[1:52] shalt Thou shalt see him
[2:00] yet he passed away and lo he was not
[2:03] yeah he sought him but he could not be
[2:11] found but the transgressors shall be
[2:13] destroyed together and the end of the
[2:15] wicked shall be cut
[2:22] off this one together and the Lord shall
[2:25] help them and deliver them he shall
[2:27] deliver them from the wicked and save
[2:29] them because they trust in him amen God
[2:32] bless you may be seated brother
[2:47] Brian morning brothers and sisters you
[2:50] know there's a lot of Truth to what
[2:53] brother TR was
[2:55] saying I guess being land lovers like we
[2:58] are it's hard to realize how important a
[3:00] compass is unless you've actually used
[3:03] one you know your Bible is your
[3:05] compass if you've ever flown an airplane
[3:08] or been out at sea or Compass you have
[3:10] this morning you're not going to make it
[3:13] on the other side you're not going to be
[3:14] able to follow the path to get you to
[3:17] where you want to be this morning and uh
[3:19] I was just going to mention this this
[3:22] morning I hope I didn't lose
[3:25] my uh from from Wednesday night I was
[3:29] going to to say that
[3:31] uh I was just thinking there this
[3:33] morning i' probably been doing the
[3:35] treasury here since I think 2003 it's
[3:39] been almost 20 years and after the
[3:42] offering on Wednesday I can say you know
[3:45] I'm I'm not a warrior it's never been my
[3:48] nature to be a warrior I I mean I have
[3:52] to just commit things to God's hands
[3:54] and no matter what's happened over the
[3:57] years with us God has always provided
[4:00] and you have to believe that you have to
[4:02] have the faith to believe that God is
[4:04] always going to provide does it mean
[4:06] that you don't go through hard
[4:08] situations no there's no no human being
[4:11] has any guarantees but you have to have
[4:14] faith to believe that God's going to
[4:15] bring you out on the other side so the
[4:18] the offering that I have wrote down from
[4:21] Wednesday is
[4:23] $222,000
[4:24] 635 so that that's a pretty good size
[4:27] offering so God is more than able to
[4:29] touch people heart and make things
[4:31] happen so I can just tell you as a
[4:33] Treasurer there's been many of times
[4:36] where if if you looking at the
[4:40] situation what we going to be able to go
[4:42] through it and I can tell you God has
[4:45] always provided for us when we ever
[4:46] needed to provide it and um I can't
[4:50] right now we've uh there's a lot of
[4:53] bills that been paid in the church and I
[4:55] know I gave a report a couple of weeks
[4:57] ago but there were some other expenses
[5:00] from the summer until
[5:02] October uh uh so instead of I I think I
[5:05] told you all about $77,000 but when I
[5:08] edit it all back up again uh for the
[5:11] meetings and everything from August
[5:13] until now for stuff we've done around
[5:15] the church we probably spent about
[5:18] $88,500 but getting on to something more
[5:21] important just I I can't say it enough I
[5:25] been doing this a long time I have never
[5:27] seen God not it might not be the way
[5:31] that I expected it to be it might not be
[5:34] what I actually prayed for in my life
[5:36] but God always meets the needs and I
[5:39] have that I'm not afraid to say that
[5:41] because I know that God no matter what
[5:43] the circumstances are he will meet the
[5:46] need this morning and I if you want to
[5:48] turn to the uh 12th and thir and 13th
[5:53] chapter of Hebrews I'm not going to take
[5:55] a lot of time this morning but I I was
[5:58] reading this one devotional
[6:02] and it goes back before I read this it
[6:04] goes back to the gospel you know Jesus
[6:07] in Matthew 5 and 6 and 7 when he's doing
[6:11] pre teaching the people in the
[6:14] Beatitudes you know he talks about the
[6:16] lies of the fields and the birds in the
[6:19] and the birds he God meets their needs
[6:21] supplies their needs without them
[6:23] worrying or caring about the things that
[6:26] are going on and it's the same for you
[6:29] God will meet your need he supplies the
[6:31] need as you need it and this is this is
[6:34] what this man wrote years ago not
[6:37] majoring on it but I thought it was
[6:38] funny It Go but to where what we believe
[6:41] this morning you know all of us believe
[6:43] that we got something waiting for us on
[6:45] the other side something is drawing us
[6:48] to the other side this morning and uh we
[6:51] know God's word says that and we know
[6:53] the message of the hour says that but
[6:55] this is what this is a par couple of
[6:58] paragraphs here
[7:00] and and he kind of strikes it here
[7:03] there's a sense of Exile in all our
[7:05] hearts and all of us feel that this
[7:07] morning and the Exile is we're separated
[7:10] from being with Christ this morning not
[7:13] in a spiritual sense but in the physical
[7:15] way we're not in heaven yet and there
[7:17] comes to most men now and then a sense
[7:20] that the Earth is alien Shore and we
[7:22] sure believe that some theologians say
[7:25] this sense of Exile is due to the fall
[7:28] of Man and that's trueth there we're
[7:30] exiled and this body's exiled our spirit
[7:33] isn't exiled by his sin man has broken
[7:35] the original Harmony and has lost the
[7:38] environment for which he was created as
[7:41] the birds with broken
[7:42] pinion and the poet said this since the
[7:46] Exile is in us God is our home and like
[7:49] water seeking its own level we are
[7:51] seeking the ocean from where we come
[7:53] from and that's us this morning our
[7:55] spirit this morning and everyone here is
[7:57] seeking to be in the presence of Jesus
[8:00] Christ this morning I hope that's what
[8:02] everyone's desire is this morning and uh
[8:05] I lost my place it's our Glory that we
[8:08] yearn for the heights beyond our reach
[8:11] and we are
[8:12] searching for something lost behind the
[8:14] ranges and seek a comp a completeness
[8:17] and a self-re
[8:19] realization of which our Earthly
[8:21] environment is too limited and that's
[8:23] true this flesh we have is kind of
[8:25] limited this morning but the spirit that
[8:28] in us that God's going to redeem one day
[8:31] that's not going to be lious have any
[8:33] limits that day and when all is said in
[8:36] the sense of Exile hunger we have said
[8:38] nothing saves that we are hungry for God
[8:41] and for righteousness to me the most
[8:44] precious promise of Jesus is that who
[8:47] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[8:50] shall be satisfied and that's true this
[8:52] morning the more you hunger after the
[8:54] Lord the more you desire him the more he
[8:56] feeds you and the pro that promise of
[8:59] course makes the necessity of an
[9:01] afterlife for no soul is ever satisfied
[9:05] in this world and I was just thinking
[9:07] this he's talking about an ancient um
[9:10] Persian quote here and it kind of speaks
[9:12] to what brother Bram was talking about
[9:14] the ancient pers said that the death
[9:18] death a man's soul is met by an Angel
[9:20] who says I am the image of your in of
[9:23] your interrupted ideas and unfulfilled
[9:25] strivings and I don't believe that but
[9:27] he goes on to say I'm your true self all
[9:30] you tried to be wanted to be but failed
[9:33] to be I am but we shall merge into one
[9:36] being as one is I don't believe that but
[9:39] what I believe
[9:40] that everyone here this morning has a
[9:43] theophany Laten on them on the other
[9:45] side how God seen you in the F in the
[9:48] very creation of the
[9:50] world and that's what we're striving to
[9:53] move toward in our lives is to be on
[9:56] that other side to take possession of
[9:58] that L that God I'm not pronouncing that
[10:01] right you have to forgive my
[10:03] pronunciation but that's what God
[10:05] desires us to move to one day and uh let
[10:08] me just read a few scriptures and I'll
[10:10] sit down so brother Brad can talk about
[10:12] what happened on Thursday but
[10:15] uh I'll just read out of the 13th
[10:18] chapter of Hebrews and sit down but I
[10:22] was just thinking this morning this is a
[10:24] crazy world that we live in it's a crazy
[10:26] place I don't even like talking about it
[10:28] don't like mention the things they do
[10:30] out there in the world anymore it's not
[10:33] edifying you know to bring it to the
[10:34] house of God but it just lets me know in
[10:37] my spirit that the time is close do I
[10:40] know exactly when it's going to be no I
[10:42] don't know exactly when it's going to be
[10:44] but the evidence I see in the outside
[10:47] world the darkness that I see lets me
[10:49] know that it can't be that far off and
[10:52] it's in God's hands where when it's
[10:54] going to happen and I'll just read what
[10:56] this has to say this is the 13th chapter
[10:59] the first few verses here let Brotherly
[11:02] Love continue be not forgetful to
[11:05] entertain strangers thereby some have
[11:08] entertain entertained angels unaware and
[11:11] that's really
[11:12] true um remember that your in bonds is
[11:16] bound with them and them which suffer
[11:19] adversity as being yourselves also in
[11:21] the body marriage is Honorable in all
[11:24] and the bed on the file but whoremongers
[11:26] and adulterers God will judge that
[11:28] speaks to the the age we live in right
[11:30] now that your conversation be without
[11:32] coveted this that speaks to the age
[11:35] we're in it's very Covetous age be
[11:38] content with such things as you have had
[11:40] for he hath said I will never leave thee
[11:42] nor forsake thee and then in the sixth
[11:45] verse it says so that we Mo boldly say
[11:48] the Lord is my helper and I will I will
[11:50] not fear what men shall do unto me and I
[11:54] you have to really hold that close to
[11:55] your heart because remember what brother
[11:57] Thomas was mentioning the
[12:00] there's coming a day what what we
[12:01] believe just people won't be able to
[12:03] stomach it anymore they'll get so angry
[12:06] with you because you believe what you
[12:08] believe they'll wind up trying to kill
[12:10] you one day and remember them which have
[12:12] rule over you who have spoken unto you
[12:15] the word of God whose Faith followed
[12:18] considered the end of their conversation
[12:20] and we all know this scripture Jesus
[12:22] Christ the same yesterday today and
[12:24] forever and be not carried away about by
[12:28] diverse strange doctrines for it is a
[12:30] good thing that the heart be established
[12:32] with Grace not with Meats which have not
[12:35] profited them which have been occupied
[12:38] therein and then I'll just finish with
[12:40] this we have an altar whereof they have
[12:42] no right to eat which is save the
[12:45] Tabernacle I'll leave there the only
[12:48] thing I'd like to say is it's a very I
[12:52] was uh as a young kid I've always
[12:56] been interested you know and rocketry
[13:00] and stuff like that and some of you
[13:02] probably know that the SpaceX people
[13:05] were able to land 100 foot cylinder in a
[13:09] tower and now you would think to
[13:12] yourself the technology required to do
[13:15] something like that but the point I'm
[13:17] going to is brother random said that
[13:21] we're you know we're in that astronaut
[13:23] age and it's the technology out there in
[13:26] the world is just accelerating and
[13:28] acceler ating and accelerating there's
[13:31] no way of stopping it anymore and it
[13:32] goes back to me what he was talking
[13:34] about in the days of Noah the very
[13:37] technology that the Earth has right now
[13:40] is the same technology brother Bram said
[13:42] man will always destroy thems of God
[13:45] doesn't step in because men don't know
[13:47] when to stop they just keep going and
[13:50] going and going but I think it there's
[13:52] always if there's a negative there's
[13:54] always a positive and the positive for
[13:56] us that God has no breaks for you this
[13:59] morning any promise any desire that you
[14:02] have that come from through the word of
[14:04] God that can find its way through all
[14:06] the promises of God it's here for you
[14:09] this morning if you'll just reach out in
[14:11] faith and accept it this morning so as
[14:13] they go one way we all need to be going
[14:16] another way and there's nothing stopping
[14:18] us either you can have more of God this
[14:21] morning and the only thing limiting you
[14:23] this morning is your own faith and your
[14:25] own desire to do greater things for your
[14:28] Lord this morning
[14:29] brother
[14:34] Brian thank you brother Brian it's a
[14:36] good day to be a Christian amen
[14:39] certainly thankful for what God is doing
[14:42] and and done in the in this church and
[14:44] just to give a a quick update and I was
[14:47] uh thinking I don't want to take much
[14:48] time but there there just stuff keeps
[14:51] coming to me but uh we were able to make
[14:53] a delivery on Thursday and and uh was
[14:56] quite impressive uh with what the church
[14:58] here has done and what the community has
[15:01] done um and you know I was thinking
[15:04] about that and I thought you know um we
[15:06] always are wanting to uh be Christlike
[15:10] and and that's what a Christian is is
[15:12] Christlike and that's ministering to
[15:14] others uh and you often times we wonder
[15:16] what can I do I'm not a preacher I'm not
[15:18] a deacon I'm not this I'm not that but
[15:21] ministering to others through what
[15:23] you've done is is just just great and
[15:26] and it's it's just it just Thrills my
[15:29] Soul so you know I was thinking Jesus
[15:32] you know and and even he had to be
[15:34] ministered to and he told us in in the
[15:35] Book of Matthew 25 he said when I was
[15:37] thirsty you gave me drink when I was
[15:39] hungry you gave me food when I was naked
[15:41] you you gave me clothes when I was a
[15:43] stranger you took me in so we don't have
[15:46] to know these people to help these
[15:48] people but it's our duty to help our our
[15:51] brothers and sisters and neighbors and
[15:53] you know uh you you see the stories and
[15:56] and you you think well man I I could be
[15:58] so angry at the government for not doing
[16:00] what they should be doing when you hear
[16:02] these stories well as Believers we we
[16:05] shouldn't even be angry it shouldn't
[16:06] even affect us because we we're not
[16:08] dependent upon the government we're not
[16:11] I mean if something happened to us are
[16:14] they coming we we depend on
[16:17] God and and and if we take you know take
[16:20] that attitude that's what that's what
[16:23] the the way the the church was set up to
[16:25] take care of each other before
[16:27] governments were even established the
[16:29] church took care of each
[16:31] other the the sister that took the
[16:33] alabaster box she ministered to Jesus
[16:36] and she ministered her she poured out
[16:38] what she had to give to Jesus and we see
[16:41] Jesus go and feed 5,000 plus women and
[16:44] children probably 20,000 people he was
[16:47] ministering to the people so uh I'm
[16:50] encouraged to to know what what the
[16:52] church has done here with just uh just
[16:54] uh the people getting out and and
[16:56] sharing what what we're trying to do who
[16:59] we trying to help and what what's behind
[17:01] us so as we come went in the other day
[17:04] we were able to deliver and I tell you
[17:06] the The Word of Life Church and brother
[17:08] Michael Bailey his coordination there is
[17:10] is quite impressive um we pulled up with
[17:14] if anybody saw in the back of our truck
[17:16] it was four pallets it was about uh 5400
[17:20] lbs of clothes food and boxes and heavy
[17:23] stuff and so we pulled up and he said
[17:26] hey we're we're eating lunch right now
[17:28] would w should just come in and and have
[17:30] a bite and we'll unload this truck when
[17:32] we get done so I said okay so we go in
[17:34] and we're sitting down and having lunch
[17:36] and a few minutes pass and the sister
[17:39] comes by with a microphone and she says
[17:41] brother Michael about everybody's done
[17:42] eating do you want us to unload the
[17:43] truck and he said yeah go ahead and and
[17:45] take care of it and she got on that
[17:48] microphone and she said listen we need
[17:50] so and so's group to go unload the truck
[17:52] so and so's group she had them busted up
[17:54] in teams you be at the Sorting table and
[17:57] I'm going to tell you brothers and
[17:58] sisters in 15 minutes time they had the
[18:00] trailer unloaded sorted and put on
[18:04] tables it was quite incredible so I
[18:08] thought you know these these people are
[18:10] they're all in they're dedicated and
[18:12] joas was talking to brother Daryl and he
[18:14] said you know Sister Joyce we went up
[18:16] into the mountains the other day and and
[18:19] they reached some people who said they
[18:21] haven't seen another human in nine days
[18:23] right nine days eight or nine days and
[18:27] just the gratitude that they have for
[18:30] for the efforts that's been put forth
[18:31] and and knowing that you know and they
[18:33] say hey we we could we couldn't have
[18:35] made it we wasn't going to be able to
[18:37] keep going without you guys reaching us
[18:40] and you know the and I'm like I said I'm
[18:43] not politicizing this thing but I do
[18:45] know when brother darl brother Michael
[18:48] and the the Saints up there tell you
[18:50] that they're bypassing those that are on
[18:52] the main roads to get to those that
[18:56] can't get out they can't get to the town
[18:59] they can't get to help and they're
[19:00] dropping off supplies and then you know
[19:03] and they tell you the soon as they drop
[19:05] them off the supplies are gone by the
[19:07] end of the day uh or when they drop them
[19:09] off they just raise their hands and
[19:11] praising the Lord and crying in tears
[19:13] because somebody cared enough and so uh
[19:18] that's you you done that ministering
[19:22] those people are are alive and and
[19:24] eating and and warm because of the
[19:27] efforts that you've made and and so
[19:30] thankful to the church for that um we uh
[19:32] we are still doing doing the work this
[19:35] week and and trying to keep things
[19:37] moving for at least this week I do know
[19:40] uh as far as food right now uh we will
[19:42] take what we get in because that's what
[19:44] it's designated for and we have several
[19:47] people that's doing things I I think the
[19:49] Beta Club at the high school are they
[19:51] doing canned good still and and other
[19:54] stuff too so they're going to be
[19:56] bringing stuff in several churches that
[19:58] have been in contact I think with us are
[20:00] are going to probably be bringing some
[20:02] stuff in but what I asked brother
[20:04] Michael what are the needs today and the
[20:07] need today is
[20:09] generators um so that they can have heat
[20:12] and
[20:14] Refrigeration um they don't expect the
[20:16] power to be turned back on up in some of
[20:18] those remote places at the earliest
[20:21] would be
[20:23] January so um you know we're getting
[20:26] cold here just take a few 10 degrees off
[20:29] and go into the mountains and think how
[20:31] cool it's getting up there so um
[20:34] blankets uh you know good good you know
[20:37] we we would like and and I'm going to
[20:39] share this with the church here and if
[20:41] anybody sees it it'll probably be within
[20:42] our Circle anyway uh but they they've
[20:46] had to sort they've had so much clothing
[20:48] and stuff brought in that was you know
[20:52] just it was an empty out and and people
[20:54] with good intentions but uh they had to
[20:57] leave everything outside because things
[20:59] just wasn't clean you you know what I'm
[21:01] saying things wasn't clean wasn't in
[21:03] well-kept and so they had to leave and
[21:05] had to go through it they spent like
[21:07] eight hours going through stuff uh to
[21:10] make sure that that stuff was good and
[21:12] clean and and they had to discard what
[21:14] what wasn't so really we need good clean
[21:19] uh new stuff if possible and and I know
[21:21] you know people do what they can do and
[21:22] give what they can give and very
[21:24] appreciative of all of that uh but let's
[21:27] just be conscious that these have to
[21:28] have wear left in them you know it's not
[21:31] the these clothes may be the only
[21:33] clothes for one or two outfits for just
[21:36] a couple of you know for two or three
[21:38] months for a while so they have to have
[21:40] a lot of wear in them uh so you get what
[21:43] I'm saying I'm not going to go too deep
[21:44] into that but um so our drive this week
[21:48] um and brother John and and I'll just
[21:50] tell you he has he has went above and
[21:53] beyond and he has he said well they need
[21:57] generators we're going to get them
[21:58] generators and I said well I'll make
[22:00] some phone calls you make some phone
[22:02] calls we'll find some generators and
[22:04] we'll see what we can do and um so he he
[22:09] called me I got four I got four paid for
[22:13] and he called me back I got two more
[22:14] paid for I got four more paid for and I
[22:19] think now we're up to 15 that has been
[22:23] spoken for 15
[22:25] generators um I've been calling brother
[22:27] John's been on on the phone he finally
[22:29] made the connection with Cabellas and
[22:32] Cabellas is going to offer a discounted
[22:34] price uh in the next probably tomorrow
[22:37] he'll make an order but John said I'm
[22:40] put I'm we're our church he said I feel
[22:42] 100% sure we can do
[22:48] 40 there's there's a book somebody wrote
[22:50] it's a business book and it said
[22:52] whatever you think you need as it's
[22:53] called times 10 as times 10 and so he
[22:57] said we can do 40 I said okay okay we
[23:01] can do 40 now you say man this church
[23:03] has given and given and and until we've
[23:05] about you know probably give all we can
[23:07] probably give but what he did he went
[23:10] through his phone and he just started
[23:12] seeing looking at his contacts and he
[23:14] went alphabetically from A to Z and
[23:17] started just texting hey our church is
[23:19] doing this it's you know they need heat
[23:22] they need generators they need power
[23:24] they're not going to have power would
[23:26] you be interested I I'll take one and
[23:29] tell them how much that's what he did so
[23:31] if you wonder how to how to sell just go
[23:34] to your phone and start
[23:36] selling so uh but do what you can do I
[23:39] know everybody's busy but that is kind
[23:41] of our goal this week and and we're
[23:43] headed in the right direction we've got
[23:44] funds coming in I know the the school uh
[23:48] Carson school is going to do a uh a a
[23:51] fund Fund Raising Drive fill The Jug and
[23:53] they're going to have competitions
[23:55] between their classes to try to see who
[23:56] can raise the most money to go towards
[23:58] these generators extension cords those
[24:01] kinds of things so I just want to let
[24:03] you know where the need is what the
[24:05] direction that has shifted and U and
[24:08] when John told me 40 I'm
[24:10] thinking okay that's that's a big that's
[24:12] a tall order I thought I better call
[24:14] brother Michael Bailey and make sure he
[24:16] can distribute 40 you know we don't want
[24:18] to just put a bunch in there and I said
[24:20] brother Michael how many generators can
[24:22] you distribute because we're thinking
[24:24] about sending a tractor and trailer load
[24:26] he said yeah boy send them
[24:29] on so that was his response and uh the
[24:33] need is great um and you know the thing
[24:36] is you say well man we're just keep
[24:38] hearing about this but you know as well
[24:40] as I do it doesn't matter if it's a if
[24:43] it's a death in a family if it's a
[24:46] disaster after two weeks that is kind of
[24:50] Forgotten is that right you know it's
[24:53] for the first week two weeks everybody
[24:55] calls everybody's there you got all you
[24:58] know all this help but then life goes on
[25:01] with that circle of people and before
[25:03] you know it you're you're still
[25:05] suffering but everybody else is back to
[25:08] their regular daily lives and so that's
[25:10] what brother Michael stressed he said
[25:11] listen we need all the food we got we
[25:14] will get rid of all of it it will be
[25:16] needed because this is going to last for
[25:19] he said this is not going to last for
[25:20] two more weeks this is going to last for
[25:21] two more years you know um the need that
[25:25] they're going to have up there so um
[25:28] very thankful for the church I just want
[25:29] to give you a heads up and let you know
[25:31] what was going on and and where your
[25:33] efforts have went and proud of proud to

[51:11] Lord turn your Bibles again and we want
[51:14] to pick up on the story that we
[51:17] uh uh read about over in Second Kings
[51:21] Second Kings will start there
[51:27] amen have y'all got my title
[51:30] ready all right put that up for them
[51:33] before we start I'll just give you my
[51:35] scary title
[51:38] amen there it is the windows of Heaven
[51:41] and the Gates of Hell amen there it is
[51:44] up back there all right the windows of
[51:45] Heaven and the Gates of Hell amen and it
[51:49] just I just begin to ponder a little bit
[51:52] Amen on that last story that we read
[51:54] that we're about to read so uh and I'm
[51:56] not going to read uh I'm not going to
[51:58] read it again uh because I want to read
[52:01] a different part this is in 2 Kings 7 if
[52:04] you haven't gotten there 2 Kings 7 and
[52:08] we read about the four lepos men if you
[52:10] all remember last amen last time and how
[52:14] that they uh said but man Samaria if we
[52:16] stay here we die and if we go to the
[52:18] enemy we might get killed but you know
[52:21] we sure are going to die if we stay here
[52:23] so uh let's just go and then when they
[52:26] got got there of course we find that all
[52:28] of the hosts of the syrians or the
[52:30] syrians they were all all gone ain't
[52:33] that right and they went in there and
[52:35] man they got gold and silver and there
[52:37] as much as they gold and rment and hid
[52:39] it and come again another tent and went
[52:41] and hid it and boy they was just having
[52:44] them a jubilee you know amen and so but
[52:48] I want to read chapter 7 verse 1 through
[52:52] two um then Elijah said and let me just
[52:56] before we read don't read ahead of me
[52:58] but listen to this we know that they
[53:00] were in a terrible famine to where even
[53:03] a mother killed its baby and they ate it
[53:06] and then the other mother was supposed
[53:08] to they were supposed to e it eat its
[53:10] child the next day and of course it had
[53:13] hid it so that they couldn't find it and
[53:16] and the woman came to the king and
[53:17] complained and said you know that she
[53:19] ought to do it and of course he was in
[53:21] distraught because of it and then in
[53:24] verse CH verse uh chapter 7 verse one
[53:26] Elijah said Elijah said Elisha said hear
[53:30] ye the word of the Lord thus sayith the
[53:32] Lord tomorrow about this time shall a
[53:35] measure of fine flour be sold for a
[53:38] shekele and two measures of barley for a
[53:40] shekele in the gate of
[53:43] Samaria then the Lord on Whose hand the
[53:46] king leaned answered theand of God and
[53:49] said behold if the Lord would make
[53:52] Windows in heaven might this thing be
[53:57] amen might this thing be and he said
[53:59] behold Thou shalt see it with thine eyes
[54:02] but shall not eat thereof turn to
[54:06] Malachi this is another place where God
[54:09] talks about the windows of Heaven
[54:12] Malachi 3 but I I just begin to ponder
[54:16] on that thought about the windows of
[54:18] Heaven amen and so and I also got to
[54:22] thinking about the Gates of Hell amen
[54:25] and and what it brings but we know
[54:27] that the man was no doubt trying to
[54:31] express that you know this kind of a
[54:34] good thing that so happen could only
[54:37] happen if God opened up the windows of
[54:39] heaven and poured it
[54:41] out amen how many knows that God is in
[54:43] the business of pouring things out of
[54:46] the windows of Heaven that's right amen
[54:50] windows I mean Heaven has
[54:53] Windows Heaven has a door
[54:56] amen how many believes that heaven has
[54:58] Windows and Heaven has a door how many
[55:01] knows what the door to Heaven
[55:03] is that's right Jesus says I am the door
[55:07] to the Sheepfold amen so he is the door
[55:10] Amen to heaven but we'll maybe get into
[55:12] that a little bit later but in Malachi 3
[55:16] and this is of course this is where
[55:17] people would go amen if you was going to
[55:20] preach on tithes amen and so forth but I
[55:22] just want to pull out the part about
[55:24] heaven will a verse 8 chapter 3 verse
[55:29] 8 will a man rob God yet ye have robbed
[55:33] me but ye say wherein have we robbed
[55:36] thee in tithes and offerings ye are
[55:39] cursed with a curse for ye have robbed
[55:41] me even this whole nation bring ye all
[55:45] the tithes into the storehouse that
[55:47] there may be meat in mine
[55:48] house and prove me that now herewith
[55:53] sayith the Lord of hosts that I if I
[55:56] will not open you the windows the
[56:00] windows of Heaven ain't that right and
[56:02] pour you out a blessing that there shall
[56:04] not be room enough to receive it amen
[56:08] praise the Lord is't that a wonderful
[56:10] scripture amen I will rebuke the
[56:12] Devourer for your sake and he shall not
[56:15] destroy the fruits of your ground
[56:17] neither shall your Vine cast her fruit
[56:20] before the time in the field sayith the
[56:23] Lord of hosts and All Nations shall call
[56:25] you blessed for ye shall be a
[56:27] delightsome land sayth the Lord of hosts
[56:30] praise be to God may God add His
[56:32] blessings to the reading of the word you
[56:34] can be seated this morning amen you know
[56:38] uh we know that the Bible says that
[56:40] we're not supposed to tempt the Lord God
[56:43] ain't that right in other words you
[56:45] don't jump off a building and say well
[56:47] you know the angels are going to Bear
[56:48] the up amen because that's what the
[56:51] devil tried to get Jesus to do and he
[56:53] says Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[56:56] God but in this case but in this case
[56:59] God go okays you proving him ain't that
[57:02] right he says go ahead and do that and
[57:05] prove
[57:06] me prove me amen and I've said it before
[57:10] I believe that the church here as far as
[57:11] I know everybody paid their tithes and
[57:14] and so I truly believe that it is a
[57:17] blessing of God to do so isin that right
[57:20] amen because you're promised well I
[57:24] don't I don't mean to go here but go to
[57:26] my mind so I might as well ain't that
[57:28] right I mean can you imagine if
[57:29] everybody was cheating on their tithes
[57:31] how much Freedom that the Holy Spirit
[57:33] would have to
[57:36] work it wouldn't be good wouldn't no it
[57:39] wouldn't be good because God would be
[57:40] grieved because nobody's doing what
[57:41] they're supposed to do anyway and so you
[57:43] know sometimes when we do things wrong
[57:46] whatever it might be in your life until
[57:48] you change what you're doing don't
[57:50] expect the windows of Heaven to come
[57:51] open for
[57:53] you you have to change what you're doing
[57:56] amen and start doing something different
[57:58] Amen in order for God to bless that and
[58:00] I can't help but believe that amen you
[58:03] know uh even even behind this Pulpit it
[58:06] doesn't matter who it might be amen when
[58:09] things are in the way that they're
[58:10] supposed to be God promised that he
[58:13] would pour out ain't that right of the
[58:15] windows of Heaven A Blessing ain't that
[58:19] right that there may be he said bring
[58:20] this so that there may be what meat how
[58:23] many knows that's spiritual food
[58:26] Amen in the house of God Amen and so I
[58:29] believe it's not just for the pastor
[58:30] Brother Brad or other ministers amen but
[58:33] I believe it's for whoever might come
[58:34] behind his Pulpit amen God promised that
[58:37] he's going to feed you I don't know
[58:40] about you but oh Lord I'm hungry and I
[58:42] want to be fed I love when the Holy
[58:44] Spirit have Liberty to
[58:46] move amen Windows of Heaven pour out
[58:49] prove me brother Bon when he preached on
[58:51] he says you know this is the one thing
[58:52] that God said that you can prove God on
[58:55] amen he will reuke the Devourer for your
[59:00] sake amen so there we see and I really
[59:04] want to dwell first on the gates of hell
[59:07] if I could for a few
[59:09] minutes amen should really take a whole
[59:12] sermon on each
[59:13] but we'll see if we can't get through it
[59:16] with the help of the Lord amen and see
[59:18] just what he'll have to say Amen praise
[59:21] the Lord Matthew
[59:24] 16 a fam your scripture it says in verse
[59:27] 177 and Jesus answered and said unto him
[59:30] Simon that is blessed art thou Simon bar
[59:33] Jonas for flesh and blood has not
[59:35] revealed it to thee but my Father which
[59:37] is in heaven and I say unto thee that
[59:40] thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[59:42] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[59:45] shall not Prevail against it amen so how
[59:48] many knows that that g the hell has some
[59:53] gates that's right we want to talk first
[59:55] of all all what hell
[59:58] brings what hell
[1:00:01] brings oh
[1:00:03] my and it ain't
[1:00:06] good how many knows what hell brings
[1:00:09] ain't
[1:00:10] good he'll try to make it look
[1:00:14] good it'll seem like it's
[1:00:17] good it'll be
[1:00:20] glamorous it'll be something yet your
[1:00:22] flesh will
[1:00:24] desire it'll be fast it'll be Pride
[1:00:27] it'll be gy it'll be uh you know all of
[1:00:30] the Splendor and it'll look like it's
[1:00:32] good but it'll be death in Disguise
[1:00:37] isin't that
[1:00:39] right
[1:00:43] amen all right see brother benon makes a
[1:00:46] statement he says brother the lids come
[1:00:49] off of
[1:00:51] Hell the lids come off of hell and
[1:00:54] streams of demons power is pouring from
[1:00:59] everywhere
[1:01:05] amen Pandora's box came to mind when I
[1:01:08] was studying on this Pandora's Box and I
[1:01:11] didn't really go do any research and so
[1:01:13] you forgive me and I don't get the story
[1:01:15] right my wife looked it up a little bit
[1:01:16] because I asked her about it and I guess
[1:01:18] it's some kind of a what Greek mythology
[1:01:20] or something about a man who had a box
[1:01:23] and they had captured all these curses
[1:01:26] that right all these curses and and evil
[1:01:29] things you know that they had put it in

[1:02:58] so curious that she opened so to speak
[1:03:02] pandar SP she opened the floodgates of
[1:03:08] Hell a that right she opened up the
[1:03:11] floodgates but said every sickness every
[1:03:14] ambulance every great hair every
[1:03:16] feebleness every ache in my arm and my
[1:03:18] pain every ache anything that ever was
[1:03:22] caused I'm going to say through Eve
[1:03:25] isin't that right
[1:03:26] she opened that box up and there wasn't
[1:03:29] no cloth in
[1:03:30] it loose so to speak let go come out the
[1:03:35] lid come
[1:03:36] off is that right come off a
[1:03:40] hell
[1:03:43] amen amen you know in a way you also
[1:03:48] hold Pandora's Box because you've got a
[1:03:51] door to your heart is that right and you
[1:03:54] got to be careful what you open that
[1:03:55] heart
[1:03:56] to amen that's right there many doors am
[1:04:01] in in the in the area of our life and
[1:04:04] she opened up and what
[1:04:07] happened we know that ultimately it was
[1:04:10] it was The
[1:04:12] Serpent and ultimately it was the devil
[1:04:17] because we know the devil got into the
[1:04:19] serpent is that right and coaxed Eve and
[1:04:24] spoke to Eve and deceived
[1:04:26] de and get calized
[1:04:30] her by saying you know the Lord knows
[1:04:33] that you know if you take this you're
[1:04:35] going to be wise it's G to make you
[1:04:38] smart you're going to know both good and
[1:04:40] evil you're going to be like us knowing
[1:04:43] good and
[1:04:45] evil how much better we'd all been have
[1:04:47] been perhaps if that had never
[1:04:49] happened hello but God knew it was going
[1:04:52] to
[1:04:53] happen and she opened up that
[1:04:57] gate and my what flooded
[1:05:00] in the very Gates of
[1:05:03] Hell very cursed
[1:05:07] amen is that what the she opened up the
[1:05:10] box of
[1:05:12] curses even God said to Adam I curs this
[1:05:15] to ground and curs this this that and
[1:05:17] the other brought a
[1:05:23] curse amen
[1:05:26] I'm going to go ahead say what comes to
[1:05:27] my
[1:05:28] brain like a lot of message people or
[1:05:31] people Christian of any kind sometimes
[1:05:33] just a simple gospel isn't enough they
[1:05:35] want something a little more and a
[1:05:37] little deeper and more knowledge and a
[1:05:39] deeper understanding and a a deeper
[1:05:41] Revelation and it can get off you can go
[1:05:43] off if you aren't
[1:05:45] careful
[1:05:47] amen that's right cuz the devil will
[1:05:49] offer you all kinds of things amen
[1:05:55] so we see that's one place that was one
[1:05:57] time that this was open the gates of
[1:06:00] hell so to speak was open and the devil
[1:06:02] could come in and my the Havoc that he
[1:06:05] brought brother bab says Satan's Army
[1:06:08] now notice he says I got to get this
[1:06:11] Satan's Army he brings diseas
[1:06:15] us he's a
[1:06:18] destroyer the whole Kingdom of Satan is
[1:06:22] sickness
[1:06:23] death sorrow
[1:06:27] frustrations worry
[1:06:31] amen and that's the two great forces
[1:06:34] that's coming together right now and
[1:06:36] they're
[1:06:40] battling how many knows this morning we
[1:06:43] come and you sit there and you might
[1:06:46] have your arms folded but you're doing

[1:06:57] somebody that's going to come against
[1:07:00] you we don't get to have the freedom of
[1:07:03] no adversary amen until we get to the
[1:07:06] other
[1:07:07] side and the one thing that God is
[1:07:09] allowing amen is to learn how to fight
[1:07:12] that adversary how to overcome that
[1:07:17] adversary praise aren't you glad for
[1:07:20] that woo we can talk about how Adam grew
[1:07:24] old how he got fee

[1:09:00] master Every Soul that hears the gospel
[1:09:03] is and the gospel is this that you have
[1:09:06] to choose your
[1:09:08] master Jesus says you can't serve both
[1:09:11] you have to choose which Master you're
[1:09:14] going to serve cuz you will serve one or
[1:09:17] the other you have no
[1:09:19] choice you must serve one or the

[1:17:48] atmosphere a Heavenly
[1:17:51] atmosphere a Heavenly atmosphere amen
[1:17:54] all right
[1:17:56] so listen to
[1:17:57] this sin he brings sin which is the
[1:18:01] biggest you realize that sin is what
[1:18:04] unbelief the one thing that the devil
[1:18:08] does that is most
[1:18:11] catastrophic is to cause a person to not
[1:18:16] believe to
[1:18:19] disbelieve cuz that shuts off any
[1:18:23] blessings of God to that
[1:18:25] person it shuts off Heaven from that to
[1:18:28] that person because they have to believe
[1:18:31] all things are possible to them that
[1:18:32] believe but if disbelief to disbelief is
[1:18:36] to miss the Mark it's
[1:18:40] sin
[1:18:42] amen so brother Brown didn't he say the
[1:18:44] worst sin is or the W worst thing is
[1:18:47] unbelief that's the worst sin there is
[1:18:49] the sin of
[1:18:50] unbelief amen isn't that exactly what he
[1:18:53] brought to E believe got her to question
[1:18:56] God's word not believe that it's

[1:19:08] blood pressure diabetes epilepsy cancer
[1:19:12] amen he brings Envy jealousy hatred
[1:19:16] meanness murder anger lust all those
[1:19:20] things is what the devil
[1:19:23] brings makes you jealous of this person
[1:19:25] or Envy towards that person or hateful
[1:19:28] towards this person or that person
[1:19:30] that's what he
[1:19:32] brings that's
[1:19:34] right
[1:19:37] amen
[1:19:39] or the devil will also
[1:19:42] offer if you're not a druggie or all of
[1:19:44] these other things he'll offer a
[1:19:46] religious spirit is that right go to
[1:19:50] church put your name on a book many
[1:19:53] people try to appeased their conscience
[1:19:55] by joining church or do things like that
[1:20:01] amen that's right
[1:20:06] but and they go into some kind of a
[1:20:09] man-made sister ain't that
[1:20:13] right and they're still lovers of
[1:20:15] stagnation they're still lovers of
[1:20:17] things that's wrong uncleanness they're
[1:20:20] still hateful Birds is that right
[1:20:25] now let's look at another one
[1:20:27] Revelations
[1:20:28] 20 Revelations
[1:20:30] 20 and verse one it says and I saw an
[1:20:33] angel come down from heaven having the
[1:20:36] key of the bottomless pit with a great
[1:20:39] chain in his hand and he laid a hold on
[1:20:42] the dragon that old serpent which is the

[1:26:59] of hell a't that right hell opening
[1:27:05] up
[1:27:06] demons coming
[1:27:10] forth we're living in that
[1:27:12] hour according to the prophet of God it
[1:27:14] hadn't happened for 2,000 years there's
[1:27:16] these demons that's been bound for 2,000
[1:27:20] years and these demons in our age has
[1:27:24] been let
[1:27:25] loose
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:29] okay let me see where we're
[1:27:34] at Revelations
[1:27:41] 9 Revelations 9 and verse 13 says and
[1:27:45] the six Angels sounded and I Heard a
[1:27:48] Voice from the four horns of the golden
[1:27:50] alar which is before God saying to the
[1:27:53] six angels which had the trumpet says
[1:27:55] loose the Four Angels which are bound at
[1:27:58] the great river
[1:28:00] Euphrates and the Four Angels were loose
[1:28:03] which were prepared for an hour and for
[1:28:04] a day and for a month and for a year for
[1:28:06] to slay the third part of men and the
[1:28:09] number of the army of the horsemen were
[1:28:13] 200,000,000
[1:28:15] and I heard the number of them brother
[1:28:19] bam says under this six seal he says
[1:28:21] these 200,000 spiritual demons
[1:28:24] they started in Rome Germany
[1:28:28] Hitler huh remember he said musolini
[1:28:31] stalen Hitler and I believe ikeman he M
[1:28:34] named him about four of them huh that
[1:28:37] were
[1:28:38] dictators what did they do I don't know
[1:28:41] why Japan didn't come in there is that
[1:28:44] right because they were a dictator and
[1:28:45] they were responsible for the large
[1:28:47] portion of the people that got
[1:28:50] killed 68 million was
[1:28:53] it World War II 68 million
[1:28:57] people men becoming so scarce until they
[1:29:00] had to train a women and a
[1:29:03] children
[1:29:06] hello now see I just follow what the
[1:29:09] prophet says and say what he says
[1:29:10] because some of these things we don't
[1:29:12] really understand but I just try to say
[1:29:14] what he says is that okay that's what he
[1:29:16] said German Hitler over in the Bible
[1:29:19] they would receive power as kings but
[1:29:21] wasn't crowned a dictators not a Crown
[1:29:24] King but just receive power as king
[1:29:27] notice these 200,000 demons turned loose
[1:29:29] upon those Jews when they burned them
[1:29:32] they crucified them they put bubbles in
[1:29:34] their veins they killed them until there
[1:29:36] was no more gas to kill them with they
[1:29:38] shot them till they didn't have any more
[1:29:39] bullets to shoot with they done
[1:29:41] everything they could how many know
[1:29:44] these Devils were ruthless merciless
[1:29:47] unimaginable
[1:29:51] evil loosed
[1:29:54] opened up the pits of
[1:29:57] hell so if there's anything loosing from
[1:30:00] the river fredes it's already happen
[1:30:04] hello spiritual demons he call it they
[1:30:08] cremated the their bodies and everything
[1:30:10] and hung them on the fences children and
[1:30:13] all innocent people because they were
[1:30:15] Jews they were done that way but God
[1:30:18] said he'd give each one of them a robe a
[1:30:20] that right undeserving as they was
[1:30:24] ain't that something how they just
[1:30:26] willfully went into those camps gave
[1:30:29] their
[1:30:30] lives I don't know about you but I think
[1:30:32] I'd have maybe put all up a little
[1:30:33] resistance brother
[1:30:35] R we'd have had more resistant parties
[1:30:37] they had some but for the most part
[1:30:40] there's very little they could do amen
[1:30:44] then sometimes we wonder well where did
[1:30:46] all of those Spirits go brother brandham
[1:30:49] said where they went he it's the hour
[1:30:51] that we're living in the Ecclesiastes
[1:30:54] the spirits uniting together now and
[1:30:57] bringing them all in this one great big
[1:31:00] Slaughter to blot out it's already in

[1:51:27] what god let's be led by the
[1:51:30] spirit what'll be next week next year
[1:51:33] what we don't know but whatever it is we
[1:51:35] have a God that promised to lead us and
[1:51:38] to guide us because I'll tell you right
[1:51:39] now if the devil will lead you to
[1:51:41] death he'll make see it's young people
