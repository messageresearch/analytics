[Music] Now let us oh let us he will hear our faintest cry and he'll answer by and by. Now when you feeling prayer will burn and you know a little fire is burning. You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right. Well, I may have doubts and fears and my eyes be filled with tears, but Jesus is a friend who watches day and night. Will I go to him in prayer? For he knows my every care. And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right. Now let us oh let us he will hear our faintest cry and he'll answer by and by.

You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right. Amen. You believe that with all your heart. Amen. And brother Thomas, could I have just another minute? I want to give a little short testimony. When I was 5 years old, my dad had a terrific nose bleed and he almost they called our family in and we went to the meetings the other day and brother Gary Hair, a lot of you know him and and if you ever watch any of DV any of the messages from Brother Donny's church, he's the gray-haired gentleman that plays the steel guitar. I've known Brother Gary my whole life and they lived upstairs from us. And I as I was brother Gary was talking to me about my dad and he said I want to tell you something about your dad and I said what he said we was at church that night and brother Smith was our pastor and he said brother Smith come out of the pastor study because back then we had phones we didn't even know what a cell phone was then but and brother Smith come in front of the church and he said church he said brother Wade is fixing to go unless God moves on the scene. He said, "They've called the family in, they'd give him five minutes to live." And my dad was bleeding so bad out his nose, all the blood they'd put in, it would just gush out. They and he was in the best hospital in Chicago there was. And so he said, "Brother David, we all got down up front." And he said, "We prayed." &gt;&gt; And he said, you know, he said, "Brother Smith went back after we got done praying." And he said a few minutes later he come back out. He said, "I just want to tell you." He said, "His blood has changed pink and he's quit bleeding." And he said, "Brother David, that was the first miracle I had ever seen in a time like that." And I said, "God is good." He said, "Oh, yeah. He's very good." And and my dad was always a real prayer warrior. And you know, I said, and I know no matter what we go through, God's a healer tonight &gt;&gt; and he's a savior. And somebody, of course, I said a seen a lot of those people that I knew and they all said the same thing. They never a lot of them didn't have much hope that I'd ever make it, but there was a God that had different ideas. Aren't you glad for that God tonight? Amen. Sister Annabelle, do you have a special tonight? Come ahead. [Music] Sometimes I fall [Music] to my knees and pray, "Come Jesus, come." Let today be the day. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to break, but I'm holding on to a hope that won't fade. Come Jesus, come. We've been waiting so long for the day you return to heal every hurt and brought every wrong. We need you right now. Come and turn this around. Dear down I know this world isn't home. Come Jesus come. Come Jesus come. There will be no war and there won't be no chains. When Jesus comes. Let today be the day you'll come for the weak and the strong just the same. And all will believe [Music] in the power of his name. Come Jesus come. We've been waiting so long for the day you return to heal every hurt and rot every wrong. We need you right now. Come and turn this around. [Music] Do you not know this world isn't home? Come Jesus, come. [Music] Come Jesus, come. One day he'll come and we'll stand face to face. Come and lay it all down cuz today the time is right now. There's no one made to wait. Your paths will be washed by rivers of grace. Come Jesus, come. We've been waiting so long for the day you return. to heal every hurt and rot every wrong. We need you right now. Come and turn this around. Do you don't not know this world isn't home. Come Jesus come. Come Jesus come. Come Jesus come [Applause] tonight. Amen. How many is under expectation? How many will pull from the gift? Amen. Hang on to every word. Right. Sit at the edge of your seat. Hold your cup of pie. Amen. Let's welcome Brother Phil to come out as we sing. Here's my cup, Lord. Fill it up, Lord. Here's my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. [Music] Come and quench the thirsting of my soul. Bread of heaven, feed me till I want. God bless you, baby. God bless you. Come fill it up. Make me whole. Let's sing that again. Oh, here's my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. Come and quench, thirsty up my soul. Bread of heaven, feed me till I want [Music] more. Here's my cup. Fill it up. make me whole. Amen. It's the only thing that's going to make us whole. You, friend, is a Holy Spirit in our lives. It gives us a purpose. It gives a reason. It's why we come here tonight. It's It's all Jesus. It's all It's all that we need. Everything else taken care of. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful we can come gather tonight with believers. And father, it's just such a such a privilege that we can we can have things in common. And not just we can gather a lot of people have things in common, but when it's you, Father, when it's Christ that we have in common, that's that's the difference maker. And we we see you in different people's lives. And it just gives us courage. We see that the word is having the effect it's supposed to have. We see it in our our lives. We see it around us. And then we look out at the world and see how dark it is. is. And no matter how dark it is, the light shines just as bright as it is dark. And so, Father, tonight we want to get a closer look at the light. We want to see what you are doing. We want to recognize, Father, the word having the effect in each life, Father, and we want to accept it more and believe it. And, Father, just to lay aside all our doubt and unbelief and just receive what you have for us tonight. Won't you speak to each heart, Lord? Let each person know that they heard your voice tonight. Lord, I ask this, Lord, in your name. Amen. I'm going to read out of Revelations 13 verse 11-14 just to get started here. It's sure good to be back here in Elton. I just you guys are just a wonderful group here. It's always such a great atmosphere and I just appreciate that so much. Just good people. Something happened to my pad and it's got the wrong thing written down. I better read out of a Bible. I guess that's okay to still do the oldfashioned way, huh? &gt;&gt; Verse 11, chapter 13-11. I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb. He spake as a dragon. He exercisth all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth, and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And this is what I want to get to. He doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. He deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast. Let me repeat that. He deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast. saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live. You may be seated this evening. Tonight I want to speak on the thought of a simple evidence and I want to ask the question can you allow God to be simple in your life. We know brother Brandon preached on that. He preached some a great message. God hides himself in simplicity. He reveals himself in simplicity. And if God does this, then we know Satan's doing all he can to make God anything but simple. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He anything. And there's so many ways he goes about it. This is how he got Eve to fall. This is how he gets every one of us to make mistakes, to do the things. He's got every church to to go off on their tangents the way they have by making God anything but simple because simple is not pleasing to our old nature. We want to have something we can do in it. We want to have something we can brag about. We want to have something like to to be beautiful. You know what what what what what the church did is she wanted to be more beautiful. She wanted to be more pre more more prestige. She wanted more whatever it is that that get that attracts people to her. And that's why say that's what Satan does because the simple gospel is just plain and simple and that's just all there is. And it doesn't give us any any room to to exalt ourselves and like well look at me. Look how holy I'm living. Look what's going on in my life. Look at all this. And that's what Satan wants to do is get us f focusing on an evidence that is not based on the simple fulfilling of the word. &gt;&gt; There's always got to be something else. He wants to add something else so that well I know God did this because this but was it just the simple word that you were basing your evidence on or do you need some kind of fantastic something else to base your evidence? What is your evidence? And that not I'm not just talking evidence of being born again, but anything that you base your faith on, there's got to be an evidence that you base your faith on. And if it's not simple, you're missing out on God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to read out of I want to read out of First Kings 19. I'm going to read 11 through13. And you all know this is where Elijah was called up on the mountain. And God said and God said, he said, "Go forth and stand up on the mount before the Lord." So, right away we're going to look. He said, "Go stand before me." He is there where God called him be. In other words, he said, "Go to that church. This is the church I want you to go to. This is where you're supposed to be, and I'm going to deal with you there." &gt;&gt; And behold, the Lord passed by. Now, listen. The Lord passed by. He told him to go there, and the Lord came by where he was. &gt;&gt; And a great and strong wind the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the Lord. Now, if you went to church and you saw something like that happen, what would your what would your result be? What would your uh &gt;&gt; what would your evidence be? &gt;&gt; How would you respond to that? I'd have a shouting, running hissy fit. &gt;&gt; Look what God is doing. &gt;&gt; He called me to this church. He put me here and he passed by. The very presence of the Lord passed by and look what he did. And that's what happens. And the the anointing comes. It's the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But wait, you know what this says? &gt;&gt; The Lord was not in the wind. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; You told me to come here. Okay, let's look. Here's Elijah. He's standing there. I I know. Imagine this. He's standing there on this mountain and God said, "Come here." And a mighty wind comes by so strong it breaks rocks. Have you ever seen a wind that strong? &gt;&gt; I haven't. Wow. What a supernatural thing is happen. What a phen. This is amazing. I got to tell somebody. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the Lord wasn't in the wind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And after the wind and earthquake. So the first of all the wind comes and blows and knocks rocks over and breaking them. And the Lord, so Elijah, he just standing there. Nope, that ain't it. God brought me here, but that wasn't it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So what is it? Oh, earthquake. Shaking everything. Probably fell down and he was like grabbing rocks and he's looking around. He stands back up. He said, "Nope. God wasn't into earthquake." &gt;&gt; After the earthquake of fire, that would have got me. I mean, if with that because I mean, here's a fire. The fire of God comes down and just scorches everything around. You know, Elijah's standing in the midst of that fire. He's looking around. He says, "No, this ain't it. God's not in the fire. &gt;&gt; Look at the phenomena going on. Look how we would have responded to that kind of of supernatural activity. After the fire, after the fire, a still small voice. &gt;&gt; And it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entry of the cave. And behold, there came a voice into him and said, "What you doing, Elijah? Wait a minute. All this mighty stuff going on." And then all God says very very quietly said, "What are you doing here? Why are you in church? Why did you come here tonight? Did you want to see some fantastics?" &gt;&gt; I love fantastics. &gt;&gt; I love the the move of the spirit. We have to have it. &gt;&gt; But you can have all this stuff that Elijah saw and God wasn't in it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He's testing the prophet. Are you going to run? Are you going to run with these phenomena? Are you going to run with all these supernatural things? Are you going to run with all the gifts? Are you going to run with all this stuff that that's this great that that that humans would call wonderful and great? Or are you going to wait for the voice? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Because the reality is, friends, God is the word and the word always has a voice. &gt;&gt; And that's where your evidence is. That's because you heard the voice of God. He told you who he you were. He told you who he is and you believe that and that's all God ever wanted from you. It just simply believe the voice when it talks to you. &gt;&gt; That's the simplicity he hides it in. But look what he he does all this other stuff. Say are you going to chase after that? Brother Brandon preached on this. He said people go the churches are going. He said they're running. They're doing all they can but they don't have a message and you can run without a message. And oh how many people would have taken those things? I got to go tell somebody. And they were running. Look, God knocked the rocks over. He had an earthquake. He had a fire. &gt;&gt; But what did he say? Well, what do you mean? Don't you understand? That wind was so great it was breaking rocks. &gt;&gt; There was fire. The fire of God fell down. But what did he say? &gt;&gt; You can have all these supernatural wonderful phenomena and all this. You can have healings and deliverance and raise the dead and do all those things and God not even in it &gt;&gt; because God has a voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't hear the voice, what good is it going to do your soul? &gt;&gt; Because we just saw Satan can do those miracles, too. Satan can produce all that kind of stuff. His evidence was God spoke to me and then he did what did he do? He he said, "What are you doing here?" And and Elijah said, "Well, I'm doing this. I'm do this." And God corrected him. He said, "No, you're wrong. Your your idea is wrong about this. You think you're the only one left. You're not." And he set him on the path and he gave him a message. Now go do this. Go do that. And that's all he wants you to do. He says, "I want you to run. Everyone, this ain't just for preachers. This is everyone who's born again. Every one of you have a ministry and every one of you have the voice of God to speak through your life. And that might not come from your mouth, but it's going to come from your life. And it's the voice of God and it's your ministry and God, take this and run, but don't run until you go with what I give you to go with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many people go out and try to accomplish something and they don't have a message to go with? You say, "I'm a message believer. I automatically have a message." No. No. And no. Just because someone says I'm a message preacher don't know doesn't mean they have a message at all because they can be preaching that's their theology that can be predicting their their theories or something like that without the voice ever speaking to them and revealing to them this is the truth of it &gt;&gt; and you have you can see it I'm sure you've seen it you have you have a minister gets up he is so focused on the theology of the message and the mysteries and all this but there's no life to back it up and you have someone else and They preach and they just focus on the miracles and the signs and the supernatural, but there's no voice in what they're saying. And what are they doing? They're taking away from the simplicity that God requires of his bride. &gt;&gt; Quit focusing on that. Quit focusing on that. We got to have it all. But in the middle, your foundation, your evidence is that God has spoke to you. &gt;&gt; There is the evidence. That's the revelation on which he builds his church. It's the voice of God to you personally. And you know what he said cuz you were there to hear it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And the the more mature you get in Christ, the closer you going to have that it it's like I hate saying this. If you're immature in Christ, you might still need the thunder and lightning for something to believe &gt;&gt; because you don't have confidence in that still small voice yet. Oh, &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about. I've been there &gt;&gt; and God could speak to me, but I said, I need to get prayed for now. I need something. I need to feel the move of the spirit in order for me to believe that was God speaking to me. I couldn't get simple enough. I couldn't let God be simple enough in my life just to be that voice. You know, Brother Bram said he he he likes he like it's like he takes a a man who take his wife up and whisper his love secrets to her and that's all God wants to do. He don't always want to have to sit there and holler and scream and hit you with lightnings and and whatever else. He said, "Won't you just come away with me a little bit? Let's spend time just you and me together." &gt;&gt; And he wants to whisper to you. He don't have to shake and hit you on the head. Hey, I'm talking to you. What a kind of relationship is that? Come up to me. Let me talk to you. And you hear that voice and you walk out of there and your faith is grounded in that he told you that. &gt;&gt; Do you feel anything? I felt a lot of love. &gt;&gt; That's what it that's what it that's what it produces, friends. And and here's here's what I just let Let me say this real quick. When you see a ministry that produces Christ, it don't care. I don't care if it produces miracles or not, signs will follow. Well, that's fine, but that's not what you're looking for anyways because you can get signs. You could have gone to Arizona a couple days ago and saw all kinds of signs and wonders out in that stadium. And you talk about anointing, there's an anointing going out there. And brothers and sister, they were saying a lot of really cool things and really nice things, but recognize that that is still the beast system coming into power. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Don't be fooled by that, friends. &gt;&gt; They were I'm off my side here. Let me just real quick look. They were out there. They the the Catholics and the prot they didn't care who was Catholic, who was Protestant. We had our most powerful politicians in the world, the most powerful nation ever been, and out there preaching Jesus Christ. Can you imagine that happening? What's going on? She's taking control. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they didn't care who was speaking, if they're Catholic or Protestant. They were together. They say they're still preaching Christ. We're going to accept it. You tell me that the the the daughters haven't gone back to mama &gt;&gt; They don't care anymore. And it looks so good. &gt;&gt; And it comes in with flatteries. And it comes in making people think this is wonderful. And I wish it was. And there's so much that we so what? But we know it's too late. America has crossed the line. There's no more mercy. There's no coming back for America. All that's going to come back is that beast system that that the the that that Roman spirit of of of that dominating iron disposition is going to show itself and it's going to dominate the world and there's only one thing standing be between it and the domination of the world and that's you. &gt;&gt; You're staying square in the middle of them taking over and you think they're going to let us go without trying to shut us down. The prophet told you they're going to shut us down. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "When they try to shut us up, God's going to take us up." &gt;&gt; Oh, we're watching scripture being fulfilled all around us. We're absolutely watching what's right here, written how long ago, and we're watching it happen. But where would we be without the message of the hour to tell us this stuff? I tell you what, we'd be right in the middle of that. &gt;&gt; Oh, we should be so h We are happy. We are grateful. Look what God has done. has opened our eyes so we're not being deceived by that beast system. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, they crucified our savior and those Roman soldiers, this is just some kind of another one of these crazy Jews, put him up on the cross, very humble. What happened? There's earthquake. Darkness covered the earth. And what did they say? Oh, this was the son of God. They recognized it after it's too late. The spiritual phenomena opened their eyes. Oh my goodness, look what we've done. After it was too late. &gt;&gt; After it was too late. Let me move on here. So you say, well, well, how do we how do we allow God to be simple in our lives? So we're going to read out of Mark 10 and verse 13. We must become simple ourselves. We have to also become simple. Verse 13, 10:13. And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. His disciples rebuked those that brought them. And when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased. He said, "Don't don't stop those young people, those kids from come unto me," and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for such is the kingdom of God. Verily I send to you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein." He took them up in his arms, put his arms around them, and blessed them. How does a child receive it? You say, "Well, how how would a child receive anything when we're supposed to receive the kingdom of God like a child? How does a child receive something?" Mommy, I'm hungry. Oh, that's too simple. You know what she responds? Well, honey, I know you're three years old, but you got to earn dinner. Have you done good enough to be fed? Have you lived a good life? Are you good enough? Do you think you earn Have you really earned dinner? Have you impressed me enough to get to feed you? &gt;&gt; How many how many people look at God that way? &gt;&gt; How many people see the the rules of the message and say, "Oh, I got to earn his blessing." &gt;&gt; You see how Satan corrupts us from the simplicity? &gt;&gt; You know what a real three-year-old? Mommy, I'm hungry. Well, wait for dinner. Oh, mommy, I'm hungry. No. You cry out until you get what you want. &gt;&gt; Don't ever quit. I don't have a hissy fit. I'm not talking about that. Well, why do you believe, you know, another three-year-old comes up and says, and he says, you know, my my daddy said the the the moon is made of green cheese. Well, my daddy said it's made of yellow cheese. Well, why do you believe that? Daddy said so. It's that simple. Why do you believe the crazy things that people could do? How can you believe the things you believe? Daddy said so. &gt;&gt; Let it be that simple. &gt;&gt; God said so. It's enough. &gt;&gt; It's enough. But it has to be a revelation, friends. It's got to be God spoke to you. And then you say, "Well, what if he don't speak to you?" Then you're in a bad place. Have you made yourself available? And here's here's I think the biggest thing. Do you recognize his voice? &gt;&gt; Do you sit in church and your mind is wondering and then all of a sudden some little something just kind of just kind of registers a little bit and just dismiss it? Wait until after this service that we're going to worship and praise and we're going to have a wonderful foot stomping shouting time here in the service. But when God was speaking to you, you ignored it. You didn't recognize that was the main thing. &gt;&gt; That was the main thing. You couldn't walk out of here with your faith renewed. You walked out of here with your confidence, your evidence because you shouted and felt the anointing. And that'll go away by the time you hit the parking lot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You've heard it. How many How many times people said, "We had such a great service. I I am not belitting that at all. We need to shout and stump and praise and show God and make love to him all we can. But if that's all you have, you ain't got anything &gt;&gt; because a sinner comes in and does the same thing. And the demons come in and do the same thing. They love worshiping in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Just trust him. &gt;&gt; Let me keep going here. I'm going to run out of time. Matthew 11:25. Look at Jesus his his attitude towards simplicity. 11:25. At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, has revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." What's he saying? Thank you for being simple and hiding yourself in simplicity. Oh, this is going to get to me. &gt;&gt; He was He was thanking, Father, thank you that these wise and these prudent and these theologians and all these people with all these degrees and they know so much, but you hid it from them, but you revealed it to little children, spiritual children, babes. Think about what he was doing. What was the father hiding? Ever think of that? He was hiding the reality the of who Christ was. He was hiding that he was the Messiah. How did he do it? By the simplicity. He was too simple. They said, "We're not going to accept a Messiah like that. He's too simple. And what's the result? By the father hiding his reality, his position, who he was, it resulted in a crucifixion. They killed him because of it. &gt;&gt; And he thanked the father. That gets to me. &gt;&gt; What kind of a love? What? Why would you do that? because the word had to be fulfilled. If the father would have opened their eyes, he blinded their eyes through the simplicity. If he would have said, he gone to the the the Pharisees and the the priests and all, he said, "This is the Messiah." And he took the scales out their eyes and say, "Oh my goodness, the Jesus is the Messiah." They would have accepted him &gt;&gt; and there would have been no crucifixion. And you and I would be as lost as loss could be. talk. Look, look at the attitude. Look at the character of Jesus to say, "Go ahead. Thank you for I know it's going to cost me, but thank you for doing that so that I can be fulfill my purpose." Now, do you have that same attitude? Can you be that simple? Can you allow God to be that simple? If you have to blind their eyes, blind their eyes. But I thank you that you're fulfilling the word. &gt;&gt; What if it's your family? He's blinded. &gt;&gt; That's what the love of God does, friend. Human love don't don't get there. &gt;&gt; But God's love will get there and say, "Not my will, but thine be done." &gt;&gt; And if you had to blind my family's eyes or whoever it is, I thank you for fulfilling your word. &gt;&gt; God don't play. He's not playing church. He said, "I sacrificed my own son. I sent him to Calvary for you." And then we want to come and go and and and have our evidence because oh, I shouted or jumped or I something or or I had this all going all this stuff that don't mean a thing. Well, I went to church. I'm I'm holy. I go to church. I'm a believer. Where's your evidence? Well, I down at the altar 20 years ago, I just felt a great baptism of the Holy Spirit. That's wonderful. I love that. Y'all love that. You had that. Amazing. What did he say? Because he might have spoke through that. That a new birth, but not if he didn't speak. If there's no revelation to it, it wasn't a birth. Because this is a word birth. That means that means he has to give you a word to believe. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And how many times pee especially people they're seeking the Holy Ghost and they run the altar and they have these great sensations and the great there's this great outpouring of the spirit and baptisms and they have such an awesome awesome time and they're just in that spirit and it's so wonderful and they they think I finally got it. I finally got it. And six weeks later they know nothing changed. Wow. &gt;&gt; Because their evidence was in some fantastic something. I am not belitting that. That is wonderful. And we need those things. But you got to have it based. Your evidence has to be based on the revealed word that God spoke to you personally. &gt;&gt; Nothing else is changing your soul. Nothing. And and look at this friends. What greater thing can you have than take this old nasty nature, this old nasty human being, and put a life in there, which is God's life, it's eternal life. There is no greater miracle than that. &gt;&gt; There is nothing greater than that new nature coming alive and expressing itself. What more do you want? &gt;&gt; What will you settle for? Why will you be satisfied without that? &gt;&gt; That seed inside of you won't be satisfied. &gt;&gt; No, it won't. Jesus wasn't wasn't thanking God that all these people going to be lost. It killed him. He wept over Jerusalem. He said, "Oh, Jerusalem, I would have hovered you. I would have taken you all but you would not &gt;&gt; because they were blinded for you and I's sake so God could come and get us. &gt;&gt; That's the love of God. &gt;&gt; I don't play well with human love. Human love doesn't like that. Because if God's willing to do that there, what's he willing to do with us? Oh friends, if God has shown you that you are elect, you are there's it's impossible to describe how amazing that is. &gt;&gt; Impossible. Let me quote the prophet. He said, "God is so great he can make himself simple. That's what makes that's what makes him so great. So many miss him in the simplicity because in simple ways he hides himself." Now we know that man cannot do this. Man cannot make himself great enough to be simple. So right away you said, "Well, then what am I supposed to do?" You're supposed to adopt the attitude of a little kid and just trust God and let him come and change you the way he wants you to be. And that nature inside of you will be that and simple. It will be so great, but it looks so simple because you can look at different people say, "Well, I I see this brother and I see him being a Christian and I I I see but it's so simple. Where are your mighty miracles? Have you walked on water, brother? What's wrong with you? Have you raised the dead? Oh, well, I have no confidence in you. That's ridiculous, isn't it? &gt;&gt; But how many times do you look at yourself and say, "Oh, if I would just see more Christ." &gt;&gt; What are you looking for? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we want to see more Christ. But what of Christ is that we want to see? I want some kind of physical evidence. I say, "I I smoked that tree and it died and and I stopped the storm from coming and I Oh, shut up. Sing to people with those kind of and those are necessary. Please don't get me wrong. We got to have that. These signs must follow them that believe. But don't let your evidence be the sign. They follow you. Your evidence is that God and you have become one. You and God are united. You are him and his character and his love and his his his everything about him. He just lives out through you. And yet it's so simple. You sometimes stumble it over. You look at you say, "I made another m I make so many mistakes." Praise the Lord that you're not taking any credit for it. that character that's in you, you can't take credit for it. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about this just a minute ago before I come out. I was studying on this thought the last couple days and it was just falling in place. Anointing was there and everything. I said, "This goes here and this goes here and I said, I'm ready to go." Right before I come out, I open it up just to go through it again and nothing made sense. I said, "What? What am I supposed to do?" You know what God's saying? You better trust me, huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You want to go out and be a big preacher, you're going to fall over your face. You're going to stumble and you're going to totally lose it. But if you would just trust me, I got something to say to these people. Get out of my way and let me speak. &gt;&gt; Lord, [Applause] brother Bram goes on. He says, "John would have never known him." No, sir. Had the Holy Ghost not pointed it out. &gt;&gt; Ain't that amazing? &gt;&gt; The prophet knowing that he was called to identify the Messiah. And one day he's going to be there. And he would not have known him except the Holy Ghost pointed it out, the prophet himself. And that same prophet, he testified. He said, "This is him." He said, "He's going to come. His his fire is with him. you know, he's going to he's going to do all the things, the mighty things that he said he was going to do. And then it didn't happen the way John thought it was supposed to happen. &gt;&gt; And what did he do? He started questioning. He started doubting. The greatest prophet, are you him? Why? His ministry was too simple. It was too simple. It couldn't be that simple. You're supposed to be kicking the Romans out of here. I believe this is the way I believe the scripture is supposed to be fulfilled. The prophet himself had it wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It wasn't time for him to see it. Let me let me go and look at some. Let's I'm gonna skip. Let's go to John 14. Excuse me. Verse one. This is when Judas is left. It's at the last supper. And though, you know, John 14 through17, some of the most amazing words ever written down. and and John and Jesus is taking his disciples and kind of telling them what's going to be happening and all this kind of stuff give them so much that is g we're going to use up to this day just just amazing the words of Christ he says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions for not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go ye know and the way you know and Thomas said unto him Lord We know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way? And what's he starting to say? We're going to see these disciples here where they were spiritually and how they were just totally missing out what was going on. Those 12 the the 11 those apostles. Why? Because they didn't they were not born again and they did not see the mysteries of God yet. Jesus said unto him, "I am the way. You've been following me the whole time. Keep following me. I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto him to the father but by me. People really don't like him saying that. They want to have other access to the father but by him. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you had known me, you should have known my father also." So he's saying, "You don't even know me. Henceforth you know him and have seen him. Philip said unto him, Lord, show us the father and it sufficeth us. In other words, they were not satisfied with what was going on. Jesus Jesus had just said, "If you had known me, you didn't know my father also." And henceforth, as you know him seen, he said, "Lord, just show us the father. We'll be satisfied." Why were they not satisfied about? because it was he was not fulfilling what they wanted him to be. He had walked in water, raised the dead, multiplied the fishes, and done all these mighty things, but he wasn't fulfilling what their idea had, what the Messiah was supposed to do, what they've been taught their whole life, because he had not even killed a single Roman yet. &gt;&gt; He hadn't done anything except purge the temple and and just kind of ruined their whole their whole uh uh religion there. and his eyes were getting the Pharisees mad, getting the priests mad and getting everybody mad. He said, "Just just," in other words, why don't you show us the father? He'll take care of business. They didn't like that this could be the point, that this was the Messiah. They they could not accept it. They did not make sense to them. They're looking for something more. Jesus said, "Have I been so long with you? You have not known me, Philillip. He that hast seen me hath seen the father. And how sayeth thou, show us the father? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why didn't they recognize it? Why didn't they recognize that him that was the father? That's the Holy Spirit dwelling in that man. Why didn't they recognize they they they confess it? You're the son of God. You're this. But they yet he wasn't fulfilling the scripture the way they thought it was supposed to be done. And how many times do we stumble over that same thing? Yeah, &gt;&gt; we're the bride of Christ. We're the final voice of the final age. We have thus sayith the Lord. We keep still. &gt;&gt; Where are the mighty works to go with that? There and there and there. And it's right there among you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's right among us. But what are we looking for? Some fantastic something. Do you recognize that you are the f I'm not a preacher. You are the final voice to the final age. I'm a sister. I raise my kids. You're the final voice to the final age. How many sisters, how many women can do what you do? &gt;&gt; Raise kids and the ammonition of the Lord. Raising kids to to to respect God. Raising kids to respect you and their daddy. How many people going to do that? How many people, how many mothers in this world today, in this country, this Christian country, spend the time in prayer for your family like you do? &gt;&gt; And of those, how many actually know Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; How many are actually praying to a God of their imagination? &gt;&gt; You're a special person. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if that makes you puffed up, you have no clue what I'm talking about. So I ain't worried about it. &gt;&gt; What more evidence? He said, he said, "He that has seen me has seen the father." Are you simple enough to confess the same thing? Can you dare say that? If you've seen me, you've seen the father. Phil, you are arrogant. If I'm saying that in my head, yes, I am. If that's coming from my heart because the Holy Spirit dwells there, I'm just confessing the truth. And for me to say something else would be unbelief. Can you allow him to be that simple? The Holy Spirit in you which is the father &gt;&gt; is confirming the word living through you manifesting Christ and people look at you and they see the father. Do they recognize it? Probably not. Most people don't. &gt;&gt; They see you as some weird cultish kind of group of people dress funny and act funny, believe some strange doctrines. Welcome to the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's all it is. All right, let me let me go to one more scripture here. I said one, it'll probably be more, but second Corinthians 11, Satan blinded Eve from the simplicity that is in Christ, right? by twisting the word projecting a different God &gt;&gt; than who he was. Verse one, would to God you would bear with me a little in my folly. This is 11:1 Corinthians. And indeed bear with me, Paul's talking. He said, I am jealous over you with godly jealousy, for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chasteed virgin to Christ. But I fear lest by any means as a serpent begiled Eve through his subtlety. That word means through his cunning craftiness, his false wisdom. Begiled Eve through his subtlety. So your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. That word corrupted means defiled, destroyed when even the slightest degree damaged. You hear what he said? One word off and it destroys it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. just takes one word and that's all he had to do was project a different god to Eve than who God was to get her to seek after knowledge and that simplicity that mean that word means singleness sincerity mental honesty free from pretense and hypocrisy not self-seeking and so Satan was coming to Eve he said now has God said she said yes God says this he said but now here's the reality God tells you that because he wants to keep you under his thumb cuz he knows if you had this wisdom you'd be like him and that got her that's what got Lucifer well he wanted I just want to be like God I want to have the same power God I want to be worshiped like God and he's saying now you can be like God if you have this wisdom and God don't want you to have it he's portraying a a different character of God than what is reality Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that God he he was saying God is not sincere. He does not have mental honesty. He's not free from pretense and hypocrisy. He's self-seeking and he he's portraying this kind of a God to Eve. And because Eve lusted for knowledge and because she wanted to be special and she didn't she wasn't satisfied with the simplicity of God says so, I'm going to believe it. I'm going to stand on that. Why? Because she could be deceived. And God made it that way &gt;&gt; to fulfill his plan. &gt;&gt; And so he's it says he beguiled her from the simplicity &gt;&gt; that is in Christ. He's just not a simple papa. He has some ulterior motives. Lean on your own understanding. He wants to keep you ignorant. Friends, when you lean on your own understanding, you are taking the word of God and hybriding it. And you are be you're committing spiritual adultery. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you when you have anything as evidence besides the simplicity of God, you are committing spiritual adultery. God don't play. He don't play. So that's what Satan does with us. He he uses subtlety to confuse us to keep us He offers a religion of knowledge. He offers us something that that that appeals to our human nature. Anything to keep us from simply believing God. Verse four, for he that cometh preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached. Or if you receive another spirit we have not received, or another gospel which you have not accepted, you might well bear with them. Why? Because it's what we want. Our old nature wants that. He's saying, "Well, not my old nature." Yes, it does. I don't care how born again you are, your old nature is still your nasty old nature. &gt;&gt; And that's why Satan still has a market. He still can get us to to to stumble. That's why Paul said, "When I do good, then evil is with me." Why? Because even Paul still had that old nature. &gt;&gt; That's why we stay simple, humble before God. said, "God, either you do this work or it's not going to get done. I'm not going to help you save me. I'm not going to help you by living good enough. I'm not going to try to impress you. I'm not going to try to earn it. I'm simply going to take you at your word." And I said, "That's all I ever wanted from you. That's all I ever wanted." All right. I got this one scripture we're going to be we're going to finish up here. Second Thessal Thessalonians. That's a hard word for me. Uh, chapter 2. Verse seven. And if there's ever a scripture that is being fulfilled in our day, this is it, friends. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work. Only he that now let us will let until he be taken out of the way. Then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and so shall destroy with the brightness of his coming. that wicked shall be revealed has been revealed. We know who this is. Why? Because a message came and exposed him. &gt;&gt; Verse nine, even him who's coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders. And I spoke a minute ago about about the beast system and what you know the the the funeral out there in Arizona and all that. That's not deceiving for you and I. these signs and power power and signs and lie and wonders is in our midst. This is within the message ranks. This is where Satan's attacking us. And he's not attacking us physically yet, but spiritually, he's been on our case for a long time. And we need to make sure we recognize and look around and say just because this minister is anointed, just because this f uh uh supernatural phenomena has happened, whatever, keep our eyes focused on Christ. Cuz he deceiving people by the signs and wonders he's performing in message groups and churches and families. Just because you can do signs and wonders does not mean you're right at all. It doesn't mean it friends. You can have all that stuff and be a devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read a quote from the prophet. He said, "Stay right with the word. Stay with that. Watch what happens. Say, oh Lord, I believe it. Send the Holy Spirit." Then watch. If he goes to bearing record, then you know you got it. There's your evidence. He goes to bearing record. Then you know you got it. There's your evidence. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not by some sensation. The devils do that. &gt;&gt; Not by some miracle. The devils do that. That's what our prophet said. He said, "Don't be deceived by these things." &gt;&gt; He said he goes to bearing record. Then you know he got What is the record? It's Christ in you, the hope of glory. It's his character living out through you. It's you surrendering to him and growing closer and closer. And it's you the the the very love of God expressing himself through you in ways that you can't even touch. And you look at that and say, "How in the world is this happening?" It's because God is in you expressing himself through you. You're clapping because you know what I'm talking about. You're clapping because you see that and yet it's so simple. It's so simple and you want to believe it. And Satan says, "Don't you believe that. Don't you accept that. That ain't you. It's not you. That's too simple. You should have more than that." And you say, "I believe it anyways." Why? Because it's the word speaking through you and to you. And you are just you just have enough faith to just confess what God's doing in your life. &gt;&gt; It's happening. It's in you. It's expressing yourself, but it's doing it such a way. It's not a show &gt;&gt; out there that the world is making a show of Christianity. They're doing all these things of Christianity, but in you, it's a secret place. It's just you and him in a secret place where it's just you having that communion. And you say, "I just long for more of you." And he says, "I long for more of you." &gt;&gt; Oh, the bride and the spirit saying the same thing, longing for each other. And set everything aside and set all our my religion aside. I just want to see Christ. He said, "There you are." And you say, "But but it was so simple. It was so small. How can you do something a little more?" He said, "I thought you were more mature than that. Can you allow him to be simple? Can you allow your your evidence to be just the manifestation of the word? &gt;&gt; Let me finish verse nine. Even him who's coming is after the working of saint with all power and signs and lying wonders and with the deceivleness of unrighteousness in them that perish. Why? They receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved. They're Christians. They're message believers. They receive the love of the miracles. They love the signs. They love the supernatural. But they don't love the truth. They love the miracles more than they love the truth. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why sometime when the spirit doesn't move very much in a service and it's kind of like a downer. Well, I drove all the way to church and nothing happened. Guess I'll just go home. Hopefully something more happens on Sunday. You poor miserable sign seeker. &gt;&gt; This evil generation seeks after a sign. Did God speak? Well, he didn't speak to me. Oh, so it's all about you. Did he speak to someone else? Were you praying that he speak to what? What if this person got blessed? What if that person got blessed and you it wasn't your time? You going to pout? &gt;&gt; Oh, that got me. I &gt;&gt; want I I I want I I want I I I &gt;&gt; I'm way off my nose here, so forgive me. What makes a great service? I like that. It got real quiet. That's what makes a great service. I don't care how much you shout amen or anything else. If God is speaking to you and you're sitting there receiving it, that's what makes a great service. &gt;&gt; Don't matter if anyone shouted or said amen the whole time. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. H we left. Satan's trying to get us leave off the main thing. Leave off the main thing. The main thing. Go. Let's Let's seek for supernatural signs. Let's seek for this. Let's seek for that. Leave off the main thing. What's the main thing? The word spoken to you personally. &gt;&gt; That is a revelation that hell can't destroy. Nothing can stand against you. The gates of hell cannot prevail against you if you have that. You say, "Well, I shout it." The gates of hell can prevail against shouting. Well, I dance the the gates of hell can dance right with you. Well, I had this great supernatural phenomena happen to me. And you know what? There's probably demons around you dancing with you at the same time. &gt;&gt; But you know what they can't do? They can't enter into that secret place with you in Christ where he gives you his seed. He gives you his word and you take it and it brings forth. &gt;&gt; He can't touch you there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's a good place. That's the part that soul, that part of God that doesn't have a single fingerprint of Satan on it. That's the part the rest of you has Satan's fingerprints all over it. But that part of you that's that new birth, that new life, there's nothing of Satan. He has no part in that. And all he can do is stand there and scream because he's powerless against that. That's a precious place to be, friends. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie that they might all be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and their gifts and their signs and wonders. You say, "What about the gifts?" You know what? Back 1906 Pentecost, that's what they had. That was the word for the day. That's not the word for this day. We still have the gifts. We don't do away with them. But if that's where you're still at, you're eating on yesterday's mana. And it's rotten. It's warm eaten. It stinks. The word for the day is Christ and the bride. Married becoming one manifest in Christ through you. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Believe the lie and be damned by it." What is that lie? You're born again. How many people sitting in message pews are believing the lie that they're born again because they have some evidence besides the revelation of God telling you you are. What's your evidence tonight, friends? Well, I had a great experience. The Holy Spirit fell. I know I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I would not doubt that. I would not argue. And that's amazing thing. But was the voice within that baptism? Did you hear God speak the still small voice through that? Or was that all you had? &gt;&gt; It cuts down close, friends. It cuts down close. But he's not saying this to taunt you. He's not saying this to say, "Well, you're all not born. I believe you're all born again. Don't don't get me wrong, but I'm saying you must make sure that you're sure because not because of any evidence except the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally because brother Brandham said the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. &gt;&gt; He revealed himself to you personally. He doesn't do that through screaming and shouting and dancing. He does that through his word. It's a word birth. He gives you the word. He says, "Believe this and watch it take effect." Let's stand tonight. All that can be shaken will be shaken. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; If the word shakes you and causes you to wonder, oh my goodness, man. Well, let me check up. What about this? What about friends? you. It's such a blessing. You thank God for that because if we would be shaken now when you still have time to get it right, there's going to be a a time coming where you're going to be shaken without a time to get it right. This is a great This is the greatest time. This is the best thing that can happen. It's be shaken by this to make sure you are standing on a solid rock. Make sure your evidence is the revelation to Jesus Christ. He said, "I built my church on the revelation of who I am." That's what it must be built on. What an opportunity. He's saying, "I'm calling you. I want you to be right. I want you to get rid of all this other stuff." A and even if you're born again, sometime we still in our minds, we have some junk in there, some false doctrines and and some some stuff that we still kind of mess with. And he's saying, "Get rid of it all. Don't do just there's no it means nothing. Get rid of it. Just let me be your everything. Let the word be your everything." &gt;&gt; That's all he's asking for. And I guarantee you that's all you want. That's all you want. Because all we want is Christ. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Ain't it wonderful when you see Christ in yourself, but also when you see him in your brothers and sisters, you can come to church and look around and say, "I see Christ and I see him. I see Christ. I see Christ." It's so amazing. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What a privilege we have. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we're so grateful, Father, that you would come and speak to us tonight, Lord. And and it in some ways it was a cutting message but in other ways it was such a it's such a peaceful marriage to recognize that we are standing where we are. We are resting in this place uh beside the cool waters and the green pastures. Why? Because our confidence our evidence is the revealed word that you have spoken to us and you've gotten rid of all the other stuff, all the periphery stuff and all we want to do is just focus on you. And father, we got we find such peace tonight knowing that that's where you brought us to. And you got such peace tonight and knowing that nothing can get us out of there. We know that Satan would want to get us moved. Want want us to get us to get up and walk away? Get get us tore up about things. And what do you really have it? Do you really not? And all you want to do is say just believe what I told you. Father, that's all you're asking tonight. Will we believe? Will we take you at your word or will we be will we be corrupted through the subtlety of Satan a and getting its way for the simplicity of simply God speaking to us? Father, tonight I believe that you've given this word and I believe this word will have the effect you wanted to have. And I'm asking that it would go to each heart, Lord, and just anchor there. And Father, if there's something they need, if they need more of you, Father, a a new revelation, reveal that to each one, Father. If they are standing on that solid rock, then Lord, just quicken that and just just comfort them knowing that that's where each person is standing. Father, we need to have that comfort. We need to have that relationship. We need to have your presence. Father, we need to know that we know where we're standing. And tonight, Lord Jesus, won't you come and just quicken that? Speak to each heart, Lord, and let them know exactly where they are. We ask this, Lord Jesus, in your name. God bless you, brother and sister. I sure appreciate the opportunity to come and speak to you. You're great people to speak to and I just pray for you all the time and pray for me and pray for each other and we're going to go into rapture someday. It's it's guaranteed, friends. It's guaranteed. God bless you. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; He is my everything. He is my He is my everything. He is my all. He is my everything [Music] both great and small. He gave his life for me. He made everything new. He is my everything. Oh, how about you? Once again, if we could. Oh, he is my everything. He is my all. He is my everything, both great and small. He gave his life for me. He made everything new. He is my everything. Oh, how about you? And all is well. Oh, all is well. We have heard the message, shalom, and all is well. Oh, there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner veil. So rest little bride rest for all is well. Can we sing it one more time tonight? All is well. All is well. [Music] We have heard the message shalom and all is well. Will there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner veil. So rest little bride rest for all is well. Amen. Aren't you glad all is well tonight? Amen. pray you enjoyed the word tonight. Just just nothing like being in the presence of the Lord. And and also, you know, Brother Thomas was speaking about Brother Biscll and I was thinking as brother Biscll's passing and I I failed to mention it, but uh I talked to Brother Charlie Cox's son and brother Charlie Cox really needs your prayer and he's wanting to go home. He has stage four cancer. He's not doing very well. And I I thought, you know, all the most about all the brothers that was with the prophet, about all of them's gone, you know, and ones that stood steady, you know, brother Cox and and you know, Brother Bisll, but you know, we're all going to be going home one of these days. Thankful for the message that God's given us. God bless you tonight, church, and pray that you'll go and pray the Lord will go with you tonight. Let's sing that little chorus as we go. If Jesus goes with me, I'll go anywhere. God bless you till 10:30 Sunday morning. Well, if Jesus goes with me, I'll go. Oh, anywhere. Oh, it's heaven to me.
