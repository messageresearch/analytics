Jesus we come before you and we're so grateful Lord Jesus to be able to Bow our heads and to speak to the god of the universe Lord to have him in our hearts have him in our lives have him in our minds Lord have you right here you be with us you said even in us to the end of the world Lord Jesus we're at the end of the world and we just pray father tonight God that youd come again Lord and do as always you have and that speak through your ministers through your church through your people father and get me out of the way Lord Jesus and just operate your gift father and may the people receive the things that they have need of Lord Lord and we just ask God for sister Parish tonight that you touch her in a special way right where she is Lord and touch her and raise her up and give her strength she really needs strength she has no energy and father we ask God that you give her energy Lord Jesus may she know that she's been touched by you as the Saints are all agreeing together Lord for a touch for her Lord tonight all those requests that have been mentioned already we pray once again we knock some more Lord and say God answer answer those prayers Lord and may those people know that somebody's been praying and that there's a God in heaven that answers prayer father we ask God that you'd have your Divine will done in the service tonight we come according to your word not forsaking the assembling ourselves together as the manner of some is Lord but so much the more as we see that day approaching so we're so grateful to be assembled together Lord and to be able to open father your word and ask you to come and Lord give us father out of it what we have need of for we ask these things in Jesus name and everybody's said amen turn your bibles if you will and we'll go to Matthew if you Matthew The Book of Matthew this evening for a little change amen we want to so to speak kind of look at the clock amen and see where we're at amen we want to speak on uh end time prophecy amen end time prophecy amen so end time prophecy of course we know that prophecy is something that you prophesy of the future amen it's like reading tomorrow's newspaper that right amen and so whether it's for tomorrow or whether you're right living in it amen you're living right in it amen if uh then you'll be able to see the signs that's going on whatever signs going on around you you kind of kind of know what time it is and where you're at is that right and I believe we can do that with the help of God Amen and so that's what we want to kind of look at the signs around us and see what time that it tells us us that it is amen and so um we just pray for the help of the Lord Matthew 24 I think we'll begin um with verse chapter 24 and if I'm not wrong this will be somewhere brother brandom of course amen uh spoke of this uh on and he compared all this whole chapter with the seals and so forth and i' I'm not wrong this is down into the six seal time amen six seal time immediately verse 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken you can run that over into the Book of Revelations around the sixth chapter around that s that's the Sixth Seal and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and then they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels with a sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now learn the parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth for leaves know ye that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see the things know that it is near even at the doors verily verily I verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can proceed it tonight I want to say first of all something that the prophet said many times and that is that this is the hour right now of all the of all of time he said this is the greatest hour this is the greatest hour and of course if you say that you might ask well brother B why is this the greatest hour of course we know that it's because this is when amen it's going home time is that right it's time to go home it's reunion time Resurrection time amen it's time when uh things are wrapping up it's the end of time and the beginning of Eternity amen amen and we all understand brother brandom thought that it would be over with by 1977 so where we are in 2024 amen and maybe just a little bit sluggish we might just be a little bit sluggish about how late it really is amen amen amen but you know thing of it is and the thing about prophecy is prophecy when something said is kind of like a warning Ain that right it's telling you what's ahead and it ain't no man it ain't all these different philosophers and different ones that do the predictions it's God telling you what's in the future amen and in that Amen in that you can do two things you can believe it and get ready for it or you can be unprepared ain't that right you'll be one or the other you'll be prepared for what lays ahead or you'll not be prepared because just as sure as the world the end is coming the fire is going to fall everybody as you know that's left will be burned it's going to be a horrible thing it's going to be unlike anybody could have ever imagined Ain that right and as I begin to think about this I think about Humanity as a whole you think about our politics you think about our governments and what their goals is and and what uh let me see how I've got it put here amen what is the accomplishment what has Humanity accomplished where has man gone what have we ever done ain't that right well if you want to see what we've done just look around look at where we going look at what really the Pinnacle so to speak of humanity the greatness of humanity where is it it's pitiful condition people that don't know who they are what they are people running around with blue hair and tattoos and every which way and just completely crazy that right so it hasn't gone any far they really haven't done anything but yet how many knows there is a end goal for Humanity there is an accomplishment for Humanity and all ultimately when it's all said and done amen people don't realize people don't realize first of all what it's all about do they they don't really realize what it's all about most of them think that the achievement and the accomplishment of humanity perhaps is to become like a what Elon Musk or whatever Ain that right are these guys that got the richest in the world Amen Trump even different ones worth billions of dollars but come to find out that's really nothing either Ain that right that really doesn't get you anywhere either can you imagine having a billion dollars and taking a bullet into ear because because you want to try to do something help America knowing that you was that far and if it would have been for the grace of God you wouldn't be here huh so apparently his billions of dollars doesn't satisfy that right it's not sat it doesn't satisfy and we have to be careful folks it's not about how much money that we have in the bank how much money we make it's nice it helps here but don't let that be your achievement it's got to be another achievement and I One mean to say this and we realize and know one thing that there is only two powers in the universe only two and humanity is subject to one power or the other you led by one power or the other amen now let me get started we've got quite a few good things here we want to try to bring out with the help of the Lord and we started first of all with uh with talking about the parable we know that the fake tree brother Braham said was of course Israel a that right so we one see one end time prophecy fulfilled amen and we know that the generation that sees Israel becoming a nation that Nation will not pass away is that right because Jesus said verily verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled so we are in the last generation we need to remember that we're about to uh perhaps elect that woman that brother bam talked about I've got prophecies I want to bring out for that amen amen and we'll get into that for just a little bit in a little bit but that's the one the one thing that's been full we realize of course that Malachi 4 and you know I can just go ahead and and say these things and and say well we know this we know that but if anybody's out there listening I really like to have a scripture ain't that right let's read the scripture that way if somebody's out there listening amen they'll actually have a scripture for for it amen Malachi 4 says behold the day cometh that shall burn as and oven so we're promised to fire aren't we that's right and all the proud y all not just half of them all that do wickedly shall be stubble what did Brother Brenham see I'll tell you here in a minute and read it to you America burnt over nothing but Stomp and everything blowed up they shall be stubble all this politics and all this other stuff it's going to get blowed up it's all going to burn it's all going to be done with and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts and it'll leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his will Wings amen how many believes he's done that and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall I just want to say this because it came in my mind as I was studying that the most important part about any of our lives right now is how that you are growing and maturing in Christ that's all that's important that's the most important thing for any of us is that we are getting ready for a translation that's why what we're getting ready for we're ready getting ready to meet the master that's what we're still here for and we're still waiting for that last name to be redeemed that last name to come to Christ and when that happens we're going to get out of here amen people like money isn't that what everybody all the politicians prominis them a good life and know more money and oh my we're going to vote this one out because you know they you know it's so much harder this that or the other you know it's all about your self existence is that what it's all about no that's not what it's all about amen people are so self-centered as brother brandham said uh the people just uh unconcerned Amen Let Me Go on that's right shall grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall Tre down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soils of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayeth the Lord how many knows Revelations 19 him and the bride after tribulation period we're going to come back ain't that right and walk on the ashes of the wicked better start walking if you're a Christian you better start walking one of these days there's going to be ashes under your hold you your feet where it's all burnt so now what's important let me tell you something what's important is not now but it's what's coming after about where are you going to spend eternity that's what's important whether you're going to go to heaven or whether you're going to go to hell because you will go to one or the other place just as sure as God took his picture and Vindicated himself a thousand times over there is a God that you everybody's going to answer to Isn't it nice to be able to Proclaim that nobody getting the way with nothing every action every thought you ever thought amen is recorded and it'll be played back to you amen but aren't we glad Brother Brad that there is an eraser for the Christian there's a leader for the Christian amen when they confess their sins amen it goes into a deletion amen the devil could try to pull it up anybody could try to pull he's going to say you know he's there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit no condemnation it's all gone I hope there's some sitting in here amen that know what I'm talking about amen and if you know what I'm talking about it means something to you to know that your sins are forgiven dear gone thank you Jesus that's right thank you [Applause] Jesus praise be to God cuz you can have them going on before unto judgment or you can wait till after amen and not only will you have be judged and have to suffer the wrath of almighty God but then you'll have to be judged then cast into the Lake of Fire that's right trust me it isn't going to be pleasant amen as I was saying money and everything and I meant to pull up but I know at one time I heard of all the deer Nation series you know how many most nations are deader nations in other words they're inde dead very few that are not amen so that all that doesn't mean so much now notice remember ye the law of my servant Moses I commanded him in the up and all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold beh I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord amen how many knows that John the Baptist came and he was proclaiming Christ's coming the acceptable year of the Lord this is the Dreadful day of the Lord a different day how many knows that has been fulfilled there he is right there that's the Elijah that this Bible talked about God himself came and had his picture taken with him in the midst of a critic that had all kinds of things he tried his best to take pictures and with his finger up is that right and that's the only one that came out none of them other else came out amen why could God was with him that's right there's your Elijah the Prophet come and gone and he says whenever you hear of a prophet being in the line you better head up judgment is on the way brother Bram talked about uh uh France and all of those that were wine women and everything else and the temporary judgment because they turned the gospel down of John Smith and and so forth all of those preachers and they had a temporary judgment and the wrath of Hitler came down on them and everything else all I can say is where's ours we had a mighty a propit than uh uh Martin Luther John Wesley or any of them much greater and look what they did how many knows Revelations 3 there it says the lay out of heia age was lukewarm is that right he said I behold I stand at the door knock we know that happened right around 1963 when even to Pentecostals and everybody would say look if you go to brother B meetings where Jesus is there Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart doing the sign of the Messiah something only God can do will excommunicate you they turned him down and he was on the outside saying I I've been here for 3 years and I ain't got no inv invitation trying to get back in aren't you glad that he said but if any man hear my voice amen and open up his heart I will come into to him I will s with him and he will s with me how many sing tonight see I love the something that I'm doing with almighty God Amen we're fulfilling the scripture of sing with him and my oh my oh my I'm here to tell you what a dinner he fixes for us what a supper he fixes for us a full car meal gives you strength W it gives you all kinds of strength and energy spiritually to tell the devil get out of here devil you ain't got no rights here on this property no I refuse to be wowy wowy W I refuse to be sad and blue I can have a have a right to enjoy the presence of God the blessings of God no matter how much the devil tries to get you to be a grumpy old man a grumpy old woman a grumpy young man a grumpy young woman no matter what much he tried you've got a right to be happy aren't you thankful scriptures being fulfilled all kinds of scripture being fulfilled amen verse 36 chapter uh 24 Matthew wow going backwards again Matthew 24 36 but of that day and the hour knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only but as it was in the days of Noah word so shall also the coming of the son of man be one man one Prophet declaring unless you get in this boat you will perish amen God again since one man one Prophet says come out of her my people that you receive not of her plagues that you don't partake of her sins that you received out of her plagues cuz if you don't come out of her you are going to partake of her plagues amen because you partake in her sins amen for as the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark amen and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be amen so as it was in the days of Noah how many knows in the days of oah Noah the Bible says it grieved God that he made man there was constantly violence people had become violent and the imagination of his heart and thought was only evil continually that's what it is today every thought that people think it's only evil continually would somebody mind thinking about God a little bit would somebody keep their hearts and their minds and their thoughts pure yeah somebody's gonna somebody is cuz God's going to have a bride without spot and without wrinkle amen knew not until the flood came how many know is that that tribulation period it's going to drop in on people going to catch them unawares that's right catch them unawares my my I'm G to have to hurry but I'm not gonna Jesus was never in a hurry so remember remember how many will remember that when you get in a hurry remember don't get in a hurry you'll do stuff you oughtn't to do you'll get irritated and everything else in the book two shall be in a field one shall be taken the other one left two women will be grinding at the Mill the one shall be taken the other one left watch therefore for ye know not the hour that your lord does come but know this that if the Goodman would have if the house would have known and what watched the watch th would have come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken in how many believes that you and I are not of the dark we're not of the night we don't sleep with the drunken we are aware we're watching we know that it's in this hour that he comes so how many believes it's important that you understand that this is the time if you ever watch watch now oh if I could just say that not just 77 people man all kinds of people my father-in-law a mean he he told told Donna that man if he if we go past 19777 I'm going to go ahead and a horse the horse that you want ain't that right well guess what I don't know if they ever did or not I don't think they did but it went past 977 but remember he predicted that he didn't prophesy that amen if he'd have prophesied that I wouldn't have made it because I wasn't in at that time amen how many glad God is a little longsuffering amen everybody that came in after 77 raise your hand just about all of us after 77s God had a little work he had some more seed had to come praise be to God okay all right we won't go into this I want to go into some of these other things but know this that if somebody says well Mighty Lord layth his coming and shall begin to Smite his fellow fellow servants and eat and drink with the drunken amen so if you get in your heart well we've heard it and heard it and heard it and heard it and heard it and heard it and I don't know you know I just better uh kind of take care of myself sure you plant your potato sure you take care of yourself but don't you get the attitude that the Lord you know maybe he won't come for a while because that's when you get slack watch out those are the kinds that's going to get caught unaware and listen to what he says the Lord of that servant will come in a day that he lookth not for him and in an hour he is not aware of and he shall cut him aunder and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites there shall be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth amen remember the talents that were given certain person and so forth and and the one that didn't do anything with it he says and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer Darkness thou shall be weeping and nashing of teeth that outer darkness is the Tribulation period amen completely blacked out cuz why the brides gone there will be weeping wailing and nashing of teeth nashing of teeth what's going to cause them what's going to hurt that bad amen gonna be bad how many believes it now let's go to Revelations Revelations 13 and we understand through the prophet of God that he identified America in the 13th chapter of Revelation he said America started with 13 uh colonies 13 stripes and stars and all these different things that was 13 isin't that right and we find America rising up in the 11th verse of chapter 13 and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth and it had two horns like a lamb and it spake as a dragon and he exercise all the power of the first Beast before him and causes the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire to come down from heaven of on the earth in the sight of men amen I don't know just what that is but I do know that whether it was Germany or Japan even before the nuke they would burn almost whole cities that napon and stuff they've burned more people more civilians and you can imagine and then the big ball fire ain't that right certainly was a lot of fire to come down and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image unto the Beast which had the wound By The Sword and did live we know that was cath Catholic Roman Catholic isn't that right going from Ro Pagan Rome to Papa Rome amen changed it over and its deadly wound was healed and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast notice the big beast the first Beast has power to give life to the image image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or cell save he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that has understanding count the number of the Beast for it is 600 the number of a man and his number is 6003 score and6 if anybody don't know on the crown of the pope is vicarious which means uh uh instead of the instead of the Son of God vicarious Phil and mean you take all of those R numerals and it comes up to 666 so the number the Beast is the pope amen now in the tribulation period you say something like that and you're liable to get drove out of your church amen I wouldn't doubt a bit but the time will come you better watch what you say Amen remember brother Brandon when he was preaching he says you know you know they've got guns on me he says I believe for this that I'm talking about the Beast and even he says I'll probably pay for it with my life one day but that's all right I won't go until God calls me is that right so oh they're they're ferocious there's two evils let me say there's two evils in the world and and this is just me but two most evil things that I know of and that is that that Catholicism Catholicism is as wicked and as bad as they get don't you ever think Catholicism holy they killed 68 millions in the most brutal horrible way you could ever imagine amen and in order for you to maybe be spared if they told you to kiss the crucifix if you kissed it you might live because you did their bidding you bowed to what they wanted you to do we're going to get right down to the nitty-gritty tonight man find the whole purpose of man and what what it's really all about the whole thing in a nutshell what it comes right down to amen because like I said earlier there's only two Powers God's power and Satan's power and remember Satan's motive and his objective was to be worshiped like God his whole goal the whole nutshell the whole thing about the devil is he wants you to worship him let me tell you that's far from falling down and say oh devil we worship you we worship you we worship no it's far from that as a matter of fact Catholicism don't mind if you have a church or whatever they used to you ain't need nothing but Catholic but now anybody that comes up there bows before the pope kisses his ring that's worship hello submits himself to them he's good good with that right isn't they aren't they even going as far as blowing our minds to uh uh blessing LGB and all that stuff blowed my mind I'd have thought they didn't never Sloop that low but did it amen and then the image of the Beast the next one that's so bad is the image of the Beast and the image of the Beast is the confederation of churches it's the denominations now brother Bram and I'll I I hope I have time yall got plenty of time I want to read you about those churches because it makes you look like those conf churches are of Confederate together and they'll make well if you don't belong to this church and and and and you come to our standards and all that stuff that you won't be able to do anything but I'll tell you I believe it's a little bit more slick than that a little more tricky than that now I do believe it'll be the Confederation churches but let me just show you something so now listen to this brother bam is saying he's somebody asking about the mark of the beast being in the forehead or in the hand brother bam speaks listen don't you believe they'll tattoo a number on your head or tattoo it on your hand no sir don't look for that at all amen it'll be a boycott no man could buy or sell unless he belongs to the confederation of church churches am in the image of the Beast remember they have the World Council of churches Catholic means Universal World Council of churches that's Universal also amen that's true he says they'll come like a union unionizing the thing is that right bringing it down unionized religion Union is bring it together to one ain't that right how many how believes that this is uniting sign and time this is uniting time the Terrors they're going to unite they're going to bundle together and the wheat they're going to be bundled together amen they're going to be taken to the Garner but they're going to bind the bundles together and that's what's happening in front of your eyes and in front of my eyes amen notice it ain't far off brother Ben I and you'll see it she's just around the corner well I believe we've turned that corner and beam was preaching on the darkest hour then Jesus comes and he was talking about the disciples being out in that darkness in that boat and Jesus come when all hopes was gone and then after he says that all of a sudden he jumps into this he says now I'm going to say something here it's not a Doctrine I'm just prophesying you know what's happened it's going to come to a place soon mark my word that all denominations are going to have to join The ecumenical council and if they don't they can't have the support of the council therefore there'll be a boycott that nobody can go to these churches or go to any churches unless you have a mark from your own church and you or you cannot buy or sell remember the church AE book he says to come a time when that squeeze comes when that time of the squeeze comes that yeah you know people are they're going to take your privileges amen privileges will be taken your rights will be taken isn't that exactly what's happening in the political world now notice just as it was so is it going to be the church will realize and that's the spiritual people now he says you Pentecostal I put message people listen anyhow you recognize it you begin to feel it amen he says now what are you going to have to be you're going to have to forfeit your Evangelical teaching of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're going to have to have forfeit your doctrine of the Bible he says and the members is not going to stand for it real Born Again Christians will die first they're warned by the word and they know this things coming amen now notice and isn't it strange that right in this darkest of hours then Jesus comes along and calls them said don't be scared it's me I'm still with you I'm here to manifest my word now notice how he says that even right after this quote that he just read am me talking about it's going to be a dark hour amen and no doubt no doubt but a lot of us thinking in our political realm of how bad it's been and what they've done in the last four years that uh you know that they certainly wouldn't vote for something like that again and we understand that uh camela has now uh uh what was it the governor of Minnesota is that right and from what I understand he's very liberal he thought that those riots wow that's just uh you know it's awesome it's pretty exciting having all those riots they had back in 2020 and the city burning and everything else we know that in the past and they thought everybody was talking now the media is going to try to paint camela as a moderate because moderates have a used to have a lot better chance of winning but now not only they prove that she's by far he's the they say she's the worst extreme leftist anybody ever was now the maybe the running mate would be a little more conservative to try to get some more on their side but no they go all the way both of them very very very liberal very on the left side and according to the poll she's ahead and we know that you can see in her uh Gatherings and so forth it doesn't compare to Trump not even close amen so you and I knowing the scriptures and the prophecy that brother B A made let me read that prophecy first can I now notice picking up the other day picking up the other day let me see what it is here now she he said I was reading some of these things that the Lord had told foretold already come to pass remember brother bam about Hitler and and musolini and the battle they have and Germany would give them a hard time but they'd over come all those things that were prophesied and whenever um what was his name that went into Ethiopia musolini when musolini he said when musolini goes into Ethiopia know that there will never be peace on Earth until Jesus returns that's what he said amen now notice and about the war how it would come out and those things just two things left of those Prophets phes brother bam says two things one of those great prophecies is for cars to be on the road with remote control egg likee only you don't drive it it controls itself and then there'll be a great woman rise up come because America is a woman's Nation a great woman will rise up and be present or something like that in the nation Amen Let me uh before I read the rest of that I want to go down back to the cars a little bit notice I said it'll come to pass that in those days that cars will not be run by a steering wheel it'll be something another run uh them cars they're bringing out right now remote control for safety correct you won't be able to enter into the city then in a 20 M Zone you can just go 20 miles you can't hit one another another car because it's remote control see going like that now I understand somebody Brother David has said you know that when you put that on remote control you can take your hand off it for a while can't you jerk you over off the left lane and if it sees a car it'll slow you down and all kinds of stuff so we're already seeing the remote control thing in a great way so how many knows that's the sign of the end scripture prophecy being fulfilled amen and then a great woman will rise up to be present or something and then there will come I always wondered even preaching up here a few weeks ago I he seen so far he's seen it burned burned over but here listen to what he says he says and there will come a total Annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out amen and I pr predict this I'm not saying thus sayith the Lord but I predict it'll be total an anation before 77 amen see I didn't know that there is something that could annihilate it I just seen the other day where they said three bombs three of Russia's bombs could make America uninhabitable amen like they got now but I seen the nation in total Annihilation just stumps and trees and things like that that's the only thing that was left so it's on its Road it's on its Road and I said remember at that day before the end time comes there be there comes that woman now you all keep this wrote down there'll be a great powerful woman rise how many know she's not powerful in 2020 she ran to be president and she got three% of of votes for a primary just 3% hardly anything nobody wanted her but now look how she's rose up to power she rose up either be president or dictator or some great powerful woman in this United States what does Trump keep saying what do we all know that if Trump don't win I'll tell you this for my part I don't look forever to be a Republican president again ever I heard one of the it was one of one of uh it was a republican can't Lindsey Graham is it Lindsey Graham I think few years ago he said talked about you know if if they don't get it there won't be no Republican ever uh voted in again so if he doesn't it would be holding true what he said back then huh because as you see if they can do this and you know most of the people you see the majority of the people people they they don't want we don't want they don't want to keep going this way no but as we know they'll they if they if if they do they'll get it in somehow they'll get it in somehow and we'll know that you know what's going on now listen and listen so you and I no doubt are are hoping we're praying that it'll be a republican it'll be Trump I hope you know and to think to me when you found out that hey Biden I remember another one I I'm just GNA take my time I hope yall got time tonight somebody said you know there ain't no way way back said there ain't no way that Biden's going to be nominated ain't no way they all said what do you mean what do you mean what do you mean and guess what even months and months ago and they were right that right and just when you heard that it was camela that they picked isin that right didn't that do something for you down there because in our hearts in my mind ah she'll never win maybe she won't it may not be her at all I don't know but I do know that there's prophecy that it's going to be a woman raised up ain't that right and back to my thought about what Trump says and we all say and and we know he says look if we don't win this election America is finished ain't that the truth it's finished because anybody get can put up with this and the inflation and the way that it's going and then all vote for that some more oh let's have some more of that no something ain't right of course we know people's mind ain't right we understand that but this is what he said about it he says some great powerful woman is United States and she'll sink under the influence of that woman remember that he says that's thus saith the Lord so what do we do we got our heads up amen how many's got their heads up we're looking we're looking because right after the woman what what happens next total Annihilation amen now let me reach you another one this is talking about when he was talking about that we type Jezebel and Ahab isn't that right then one day after sin had take its toll and God has brought his people on their knees Jezebel took everything she wiped it all up and she'll do it again that's thus says God's holy Bible she'll do it again she's right on the throne now be behind the figurehead twisting it any way that she wants to how many thinks Biden was in control that man doesn't know how to get off the steps how's he going to control anything he can't you know can't keep a sentence straight you know no he's not controlling anything he's not pushing the buttons it's just coming out of his mouth because because he's the figurehead and so we look at him well he did it no it's somebody back there AOC or one of them huh isn't that crazy how AOC and some of those liberals and all of that they're just excited about oh yeah we're gonna rich just going to have a blast I don't know if you ever seen OC AOC after Trump went to New York and then she came in and uh she had a little rally and she Plum went berserk almost we got to get it back we got to get it back we she was hysterical thinking that maybe you might lose control amen I got a lot I want to say here but I hope you can bear with me she wiped it all up and she'll do it again now notice she's uh now notice twisting it any way she wants to and nobody's going to stop her nobody's going to stop her now because what they couldn't get done in the religious Cycles they'll do it through politics and then they done it see that's exactly right which the polit political will be a boycott just exactly back to the mark of the beast as sure as I'm standing here the Bible says it now there's many young people here I don't know Jesus may come this afternoon he may come next year I don't know when he'll be coming but you remember if I do not live to see the day is coming which I hope that I will and some I believe I will now if I do not see it do not let this word ever depart from your ears and your heart you just remember remember I speak in the name of the Lord I believe with all of my heart that's the way it'll wind up there'll be like a union a boyot and all such places as this here will be closed down then and you'll not be able to speak unless you have got a permission or a license from the federal Federation of churches to hold a service wow now let me ask you something how many knows that she swall following every he's wiping it all up I said there's two evils Catholicism and the image of the Beast okay now we know that the real evil if you really want to know something that's real evil it'll be homosexuality is that right LGB and all of that that's wickedness and now how do you tie that in with church Brother Brad how how does that got anything to do with churches and they're getting into everything I remember years ago uh uh Governor kusumo up in New York right he me he was talking about he's going to Outlaw big gulps too much sugar you can't have big gulps this out the other and all these other things they were trying to do and and things they were trying to push a't that right well big GS what's that got to do well it's just intruding on on on people's rights intruding on people's rights let me see what I got here and then it goes from one to the other then it goes of course they're doing their best to take your guns away is that right camela said that I I'll give Congress a 100 days and if they don't do something about about it I am signing executive order we're going to ban ARs and all that other stuff that sound like a dictator to you or what well if they don't make the law I'll make the law what have they done even even Biden now and and well let me just say this look at look at what they've done they had they had an absolute hisy fit I remember uh Nancy Pelosi saying boy I'll tell you what if the Democrats were and we would really do something with this Co I mean we'd do something with it you know and that after Trump got out didn't they do it they exactly did they was made it mandatory and if you work for the government and if you didn't take it if you was a soldier and you didn't take it isin't that right they forced you to do it forced you to do it all of these uh uh uh lesbians G all this um Sports and inner uh changing sex and all of that it's not like and we all know it's not like they'll just do it for themselves that's that they're not happy with that you have to agree with it did you ever watch them any on the news when they are talking to each other Bo if you don't agree with them they hate your guts and they want you dead there's a spirit rising up brother bam says we got to get it they got to get in the spirit of the end time before the end time can come they have to get in the spirit of the Antichrist and then what did they do they didn't stop there but they infringed even more and went crazy okay what did they do when they went crazy I'll tell you what they did is they went into the schools and said look we're going to have let your children decide what they are maybe even giving them a sex change and not even telling the parents and all that oh you parents ain't got no right to tell us what to teach and everything else let me ask you who are those people them are denominational church folks denominational church folks teachers and everything else principles and governors and all of that you think there's any Holiness in them churches no there's not they'll let homosexuals preach lesbians and and Mary all of that they're as filthy as the homosexuals are they won't hesitate to persecute you so you see how that squeeze is coming just like the homosexuals on in Sodom and gomorra pressed their way into it pushing it squeezing it forcing it's a forcing brother Brandon went all the way back to Nebuchadnezzar and how they forced everybody to worship Daniel that Idol or they'd be killed he says it's came in that way it'll go out that way it'll be a forcing amen and I thought well maybe it'll just be uh and I truly believe that brother Bram all every every instant everything that I can come come up with and brother Bram says at that time it's at that time that Christ will take his church amen but let me just say this there's this there's a quote that I wanted to say isn't it strange that right in the hour of Darkness then Jesus comes along and calls them and says don't be scared amen one thing that should be one thing this should do for anybody is give you a wakeup call hey am I ready to go does it scare you a little bit and then to Brothers I seen a text where it said something about well you know maybe it it maybe she should be we should just pray she comes on in and I thought about that pray that she comes on in in order to have that mentality hello in order to have that mentality you've got to let go of this world and wanting to be here ain't that right and you better not wait till it happens to let go we better start letting go tonight saying God I'm ready to get out of here I don't have my Ties on here I don't put everything else in front of Christ Christ is first Christ Holy Ghost is first church is first God's first [Music] hallu don't be scared don't let this scare you I'm with you he says aren't you glad Christ is with us going through this and seeing the squeeze come down Amen brother BR said much about the squeeze and you take the political realm he said using that political realm because the churches are already in it they're swallowed up in that Antichrist Spirit they they took the Antichrist Spirit when they rejected Jesus Christ in this hour when they rejected the message that God sent to this generation infallible of Jesus Christ coming down every time and prove it when you reject that you reject God period amen so my so you think about all the way down to our children Amen to our gas stoves all of a sudden they're saying you can't have gas stoves and they're pressing amen that you can't have cars you got to have elect where's that law come from did Congress vote on that brother Brad because I missed it that I'm going to have to let ride electric scooters around with a seat in it Trump says I'll make it to where you can if you want to but if you don't you can still drive gas cars then you know the latest hey you want a good one I got a good one I heard just the other day just the other day that Biden is trying to get rid of your plastic forks and spoons because of global warming well my gracious if he can take your spoon away from you what else can he take away from you hey we thought it was funny when they said this uh uh you know take the money away from the police force they'll never they did don't laugh too hard nothing will surprise me nothing is surprised ain't nothing surprise you it wouldn't be surprised one bit and look at how they go after everything even don't know they even though it burns them up and in and people know that there ain't no trans man should be in there fighting a woman but yet they do it because of the principle we said it do it then do it you tell me they're not evil huh to what length will they go I can certainly see how if camela does get it with her attitude yeah she'll she'll do everything and people don't rise up against it now let me just say this again to think that oh yeah just let it come cu the bride does say even so Lord come come if you want it to last a little longer vote Trump which I'm saying you can vote whatever you want to I'm not promoting anything they'll take our rights away I guess but anyway you love the Lord I certainly wouldn't vote camela that's for sure but to think you want to last a little longer but to say come on come on Lord Jesus cuz we're waiting we're watching for you to come we're preparing our hearts it's amazing where it's gone to all the way into our schools Brother Brad I'm surprised that they haven't hit the churches yet I'm surprised we ain't been hit yet I know some Churches get burnt and people throw stuff in because of what they preach Donnie Reagan P got a little persecution because of what he preached about brother brandham and and staying with your color and all that hello oh they get angry they get angry I've seen a I've seen a a YouTube thing where one guy would go over and say you look uh you know I'm a Trumper with the left they said get away from here who are you get out of here we and spilled some slushie on him huh then they went over there to the trumpers hey y'all you know I'm with I'm with them over there and so forth and he says well come on you know you're all right I understand you just the nicest people you could have what is what is it with all of trump and all of those that come to those rallies I I I spoke this a few years ago but I said you know it's teetering we almost have more left than we do right and even though we have a lot in millions upon millions of people that are still sane hello that are still don't want all of this stuff Ain that right and you think about it if I wanted to hang on brother brother Tommy I'd probably go up uh on the Square with a big Trump sign hey Trump trump yeah yeah you want to have all kinds of says and the left is crazy and they've lost their mind and huh a that right that little bit of America that's in us this is our home ain't that right we live here we hate to see it go the way that it does that's what they feel notice when Trump got shot and so forth and you didn't see everybody Panic they didn't run over each other killing until they get out of there just held still if it had been the left there'd have been more people dead from running over each other didn't run got shot amen that's right but just the difference see the difference they all the those people are still hanging on still hanging on hoping hoping that we can have just four more years of Peace perhaps or greatness but the Bible says that the there be Nation against Nation wars and rumors of wars didn't that right brother Joe the soldiers down there they're on high alert they're all thinking they're going to go to war could go to war any time hello we done let 7 million 10 million 15 million of people we don't know all up in here is that right we don't know what's going to happen next it's very unstable very unsure aren't you glad for the word of God and to know that you are safe and secure in Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord but prophecy I wanted to just bring that how that the squeeze that squeeze you looking at it how many believ we're looking at it they practi this and that's why Pelosi and them said we would like to let's see what we can make them do let's see if we can make them close down their churches amen I'll tell you this what good did it do we was out of church for two months maybe at the beginning of it and it was about a year later later if I remember about a year after we started coming back again it come through here like a wave we all pretty much got it when they had two or three cases and all of that just a few cases they shut everything down well guess what it spread anyhow took about a year for us to really come around to us amen but anyway they'll close us down probably one of these days yeah praise the Lord can we'll know that we're right at the time let him keep taking stuff away you ain't going to stop it what did Brother Braham say she swipes it all up she gets into everything She Wants to Rule everything she wants to run your gas stove she wants to tell you what to do brother brandom here let me see if I can find what he said here just give me a second all right the reason that you don't know these things all right let me go back a little bit there'll be like a union unionizing the thing bringing it down unionized religion mark my word it ain't far off she's just around the corner the reason that you don't know the things is you're at home here all the time follow me over into countries where Catholicism has the upper hand one time and you'll see what takes Brothers takes care takes place brother they tell him what they can do and what they cannot do hello so you tell me who's behind the figurehead somebody wants to tell you what to do and what you can't do all the way down to your plastic spoons I don't know about you but I'm just expecting it anytime I'm expecting it anytime Things Are shaping up just the way that they supposed to let me close with this one thought that I was hoping to get across and that is brother Braham says they'll stamp out anything that doesn't agree with them anything that doesn't agree with them and remember if the devil can just get you to agree with him how many believes he's got you I thought it's like somebody gossiping the church brother bam said when you listen to that gossip in other words when you believe that gossip the Holy Spirit takes its flight Jesus Christ leaves the person gossiping they're already poisoned by the devil they already lost it amen just by a believing it and in the Dark Ages if you would just kiss the cross crucifix or just agree with them CU two unless how can two walk together unless they be agreed this is what we come down to the nutshell that I was telling you about the devil doesn't care if we have church he don't he wouldn't care if you're message churches whatever as long as you agree with him but cross them have you ever seen such a hateful spirit I mean if you cross them man they just they hate you and it's the spirit of that that Antichrist Spirit they want to get rid of you amen and it's the spirit getting ready not just think about this all you have to do to be go on the devil's side is to agree with them okay that's fine let's let's just let them have that you you know I'm not opposed to you know having this that or the other in church okay well just don't come don't say anything against it we're good why you done agree with the devil you're on his side but you know because that's ultimately Brother Brad the scope of the picture of the whole thing is if the devil can get you to do that that's his whole goal it's not so much about Nancy Pelosi and her millions or or Trump and his millions all these people that have billions of dollars now they're focused on power they want to be able to tell the people what they can and can't do and that is the devil that is the spirit of the devil amen and it's actually bringing it down to where like brother baham says you won't be able to have church unless you're a part of them ain't that right and just it just takes that it comes down to just that the devil just wants you just to be in agreement with him and do you realize that Jesus Christ is the same way the devil will take you to hell when you agree with him but the Bible says that he will he that will confess with his mouth the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved he's the high priest of our profession brother baham said to profess something is to say the same thing many beliefs that you have to confess Jesus Christ died for my sin I believe that and he'll save you and fill you with the Holy Ghost give you eternal life the devil will do everything in his power by forcing you to agree with him God Don't force you to do it the devil is trying to force people amen that's where we're at folks that's where we're at coming very close to the forcing one of these days don't be surprised keep your eyes open how many's got their eyes open we're looking at the clock it's a late hour could very well be that woman if it is brother you better get ready to go home and you know this is the thought that I had when I begin to study this and that is boy you don't want to wait until then to start getting ready amen there'll come a time when it's too late for you to get ready brother bam said when that squeeze comes down he says it's too late then this is the hour this Wednesday night right now is the hour say God I want to be ready Lord have me ready let her go ahead if they want to vote that in vote her in cuz God won't let anything go in there that he don't allow God knows exactly who's going to get it amen and if it ain't her and Trump goes in for another four years that'd be a good time for it to come CU everybody thought this that or the other you don't know brother brah said that Figure Head was behind Kennedy all the way back then already amen and I thought you know in my mind the eal Cil get together and all these churches will say look you've got to be this out or the other but it may be a lot trickier than what you think cuz that ecumenical part is part of that evil thing and to begin with and then they're using the politics to achieve their goal might be a little different what we think amen but yet it's still fulfilling that very prophecy amen that's right it's kind of funny spoons and porks but yet it's the eyeopener hate they'll even try to do that amen what will they do next amen God bless you stand with me with our heads bowed eyes closed I hope tonight that this will cause you to lift up your head because you're Redemption is drawing nigh we're closer than we've ever been we've heard it and we've heard it we've heard it and we've heard it tell it to me one more time and help me to get ready one more time because one of these days it's going to happen one of these mornings there's going to be a sweet change come over us but it's not coming to those who have their hearts away from God and that have their priorities wrong no it's those who have their priorities right that have the sweetness of the Holy Ghost in their hearts and that are living for him every sing single day how many raise your hand say God have me I want to be ready Lord if you come tomorrow morning if you come before morning I want to be ready Lord we see the signs around us we see prophecy being fulfilled we see a squeeze coming we see prophecy being fulfilled and we're watching it Lord even as your Prophet said you can look at the newspaper and you can see prophecy being fulfilled and we're seeing it Lord we ask God today that you would would help us to be ready Lord because Lord we know that the enemy will squeeze our finances they will squeeze everything that we have on this Earth to try to get us to take cater to them but we will never do it we are don't hold our Earthly possessions as a treasure you are our treasure tonight we ask God that each one father that is hearing this both here and out there God that they would say in their hearts Lord help me to purpose in my heart I will not be a foolish servant I will not say the Lord delayeth his coming but I will be ready and I will watch father for when you come and I'll be ready so that God you can have me Lord Jesus as you have spoken and as you have said he that has been faithful in a few things you'll make ruler of much and we will not have our house spoiled we will not have to come down and say oh I got to let go now oh I should have let go no I we let go of all of this world here tonight and say Lord we just here we're just using these things to get by we're pilgrims and we're strangers in this world we're looking for you to come in the skies of Heaven to take us home and we ask God have our hearts pure forgive anybody Lord just rais their hands any kind any kind of sin any kind of fault or failure Lord we ask Purge us with this up your blood Clean us clean and white as snow Lord just now let us not go out those doors without asking forgiveness and Grace Lord and have us prepared Lord we want to be with without spot and without wrinkle we want every sin and every fault under the blood of Jesus Christ Lord today I was reading where you Prophet the opening of his message saying Lord
