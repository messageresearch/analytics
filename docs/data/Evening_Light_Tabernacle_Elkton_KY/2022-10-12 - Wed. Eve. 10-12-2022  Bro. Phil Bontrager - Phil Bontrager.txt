brother Thomas give me this opportunity it's good to be able to come away from all that stuff we did today just gather into a place like this the atmosphere you bump heads you bump shoulders with the world all day long and it just drains you and you just you just feel like oh my you come here and you're just like picked up and it's like oh yes this is what life is supposed to be about right here so God God takes us out there when we walk through the world we fight the battles we go through the things but there's a there's there's a strength when you fellowship with brothers and sisters there's a strength when you come together in person and see each other and you can talk to each other and you can look him in the face and you don't get that from Streaming Friends I know some people have to stream but it does not have the same effect that's why brother Brown said one though if you have the love of God in your heart when those Church doors are open you can't wait to get here because you know this is where your strength lies amen amen God bless you let's just pray one more time lord Jesus we're so grateful that we can be here tonight Lord together with Believers in such an atmosphere Lord Jesus where Believers have come together to worship you and to praise you Lord Jesus we're just so so thankful Lord Jesus I pray that you would take this word and let it have the effect that you wanted to have Lord Jesus not just me saying something not just a Doctrine going out but Lord the Holy Spirit coming and making this a reality to every Hungry Heart Tonight Lord that will seek to hear from you father I believe this is your will for us tonight Lord meet our needs we ask this in your name amen if you want to read I'm going to read from acts about three or four verses in Acts 19. starting at verse 13. Acts 19 will start at verse 13. it says this then certain of the Vagabond Jews Exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we endure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth and there are seven sons of one skiba a Jew and chief of the priest with did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are ye and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaked on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so they fled out of that house naked and wounded go ahead and have a seat tonight I want to I'm going to speak on the thought the devil's question I'm gonna ask you who are you yeah who are you because see right now this world is having a serious identity crisis nobody knows who they are men can't decide if they're a man a woman woman can't people can't even tell you what a woman is they they can't tell what gender they are they say well I'm I'm gender fluid I'm a man one day I'm a girl the next day sometimes I'm a cat sometimes I'm something besides all that and the whole world is going crazy and what's the really bad part is the people who should know better the Educators smart people the doctors the leaders of the country all these people they actually go along they say yeah this is legitimate friends is not legitimate this is insanity your Prophet said is going to happen in this world he said the world will go completely insane and we see it right now on the street and the people who are supposed to be leading us are the ones who are leading that insanity that's right what's it all about friends it's Satan asking the question he's trying to figure out excuse me I'm choking to death already he's trying to ask who are you he wants to find out why because Satan always has problems identifying Christ in flesh Oh my he always has struggle because he looks at you he said are you kidding this is the bride of Christ come on ordinary people like this the bride of Christ he struggles with that he does because he can't stand to think that you in that flesh body you're in can overcome him he cannot stand to think that you can cast him out he cannot stand to think that you can lay your hands on the sick and they will recover and that demons are holding him have got to leave he can't stand you because of this because he's got every other age he's got every the bride all the way he got eat he got the Israel the the Jewish bride he got every Church ate down through the church ages he got him all to fall to some temptation but he can't touch you what is wrong with you who Do You Think You Are because you've been given something that those other ages lost and that was the pure work to produce a pure bride that will not that will not uh hybrid herself with some man-made doctor and some man-made's Creed and you see here with the pure word is producing the act the absolute genuine Jesus Christ in flesh again today in case you wanted to know that's who you are now do you believe that as a Doctrine would you have the authority of the word to stand there on the word because it's been revealed to you because see that's where a lot of people are and they're a good message believe or they believe they're proper and they believe there they live a good life but it's just a Doctrine and if it's just a Doctrine the best you can produce as lukewarm Lego seed and message believer that's a horrible place to be in this day friends because God hates that spirit Satan try to identify God in flesh he's always been doing it look let's look at this John the Baptist he come out right and the priests and Levites come out to him and say who are you tell us who you are he said he confess it I'm not the Christ he's coming after me but look what look what Santa is doing he always has it's the religious leaders and just be is Satan almost always taking those religious denominational leaders and leading them he's trying to find John are you that Christ are you the one says no I'm not the one because Satan saw that he had a strange kind of birth he knew there was something strange about him so he was concerned oh you hear me so I'm not him Jesus come along he started doing some amazing things what happened Nicodemus come out here he snuck out at night right because he's part of that denominational system who didn't really like what's going on they didn't want some other religion popping up to oppose them because that took away their power and their Prestige and their money and their popularity and so Nicodemus came out and said now now we know first of all he said we know that means they've been discussing it right they're sitting around thinking who is this guy why is he not there doing these so he said we the the the denomination we know that you're a man sent from God you're a teacher from God because no one could do these things what was Nicodemus next question now we know yourself from God his next question would have been now who are you identify yourself Jesus cut them off never let him ask that question you know why Jesus said it don't make any sense we know your man sent from God except you're born again you can't believe it anyways you can't understand it anyways you cannot see the kingdom of God I am the Kingdom of Heaven stand in front of you and he said unless you're born again you can never see or understand so you're wasting your time until you get the new birth and let me tell you something brother sister tonight if you are sitting in this church and you don't have the new birth you're still wasting your time because you're not going anywhere you want without it I don't care how faithful you are in this church you can see her pay attizing preach to everything you want to do but unless you're born again you will never understand the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is inside you and if it's not inside you you don't know what you're talking about I don't care how much you can quote the prophet it's just the way it is friends it's never changed since Nicodemus went to Jesus till tonight except you're born again you cannot understand the kingdom of God and you can look around and see all these wonderful people and you can think you're one of them but if you don't stand on the revelation of the authority of the word in your own self personally you're just being deceived [Applause] John 10 says the Jews came around him and said him down how long does that make us doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly oh he's asking who are you Jesus answers I already told you and you believe not because it wasn't the way they wanted him to be he wasn't the Christ the Messiah that they look for that's why he fooled Satan because it wasn't the way you know sales saw that word he saw the prophecy for what the messiah's supposed to be and here comes this man he born a really strange birth he grows up he just disappears and Satan's watching him all this time he goes to his teen years nothing really happens go says 20s don't look at nothing here I guess it was just another flash in the pan all of a Suddenly It's just about his authorities and all of a sudden he starts doing things they say oh I gotta find out who this is so he's there he's watching there's John the Baptist that crazy man down there dunking people in the water and Jesus goes to him and say and said oh let's see what's going on he says he saw the the spirit of God like a dove come down on him oh oh now he's going to start his ministry now he's going to start assembling an army and throw the Romans out of out of Judea and now he's going to start with causing Revolt he's going to start Gathering people together and Satan said okay gotta stop this now because Satan believed that because all those other people believed it he had inspired them to believe that the scriptures that way yeah and you know what this said the Bible says the spirit the Holy Spirit drove him into the the desert why would the Holy Spirit do that same reason he does it with you he takes you to the desert doesn't he I hope so if he doesn't you got something to worry about because every son and daughter of God has to go through their desert experience and ain't a one-time thing we go through these over and over because this is where you mold your character all right so Satan's watching and he's out there wandering through the desert he's getting weaker because he ain't eating you remember he's a man and he's not eating for 40 days and you know what happens when you don't eat for 40 days you get weak you get weak spiritually you get weak physically you will get weak mentally you get weak emotionally and all it has effect we're going to get weak when you're not eating you become weak and it affects your whole life until about 40 days Satan says you know what this guy's pretty much pretty weak is he gonna get he's probably gonna start eating let me go out and just tell him because I got every Prophet everything every person every man every woman I got Eve I have a very Paradise itself to fought to my Temptation and I'm gonna prove to you that this ain't him either care what John said about the Lamb of God I'm gonna get him because I have I know how to tempt a person you ever tempt you I hope so he better be so he goes up to him he says if thou be there is there is your question if thou be the Son of God you're hungry why don't you turn some of this rocks into bread and eat I mean goodness sakes he got Moses to fall to that Temptation he got Elijah he got all these people use your gift you've got great gifts use this to prove your because he knew Satan knew that he knew that if he was the Messiah he was the very Creator he could do anything he wanted Satan knew that kind of just jump off a little bit a bit yeah I'm convinced friends that so many message Believers still think he's the second person in a trinity and I think that so many massive Believers think that the holy spirit is some inferior Spirit to God the Father because we treat him so different oh yeah the holy spirit is here holy spirit is here really and we treat him the way we do foreign so Jesus met that Temptation with the word singed from tail feathers he didn't know saying that's tail feathers the prophet said he sent his tail feathers I don't know what he looks like with tail feathers but so Satan wised up a little bit he said whoa he thought he would and so he gave him another temptation he said you know dump up you know go take up on the the temple there and jump off and he quoted the scripture to him and Jesus came right back with another scripture and Jesus scripture overcomes saying scripture he said there are both scripture yeah but why does saying scripture fall to see Jesus because Satan did not have the authority of the word it was not in Revelation it was just a Doctrine all saying could do was called the scripture as a Doctrine and Jesus no standing and he took the authority of the word and he overcomes Satan and brother Brown says that's the only way why he was doing the show and you and I had to overcome the only way you know you're overcoming is if you're using the word and it's not because you can quote Dr the scripture I tried that so many times and Satan's coming their Temptation and I take a scripture and I quote and I quote and I quoted and I still fall to the Temptation why because it wasn't something that God had revealed to me I'm just trying to take a Doctrine you have to know friends that's been revealed that you have the authority when you recognize who you are in the word brother Brad said Jesus saw himself in the scripture he went out and fulfilled what the Messiah was supposed to fulfill and he says that's what the bride does too you see yourself in the word for this day and you go on you fulfill what the brightest post to fulfill you don't do that by just quoting a Doctrine or a quote or whatever like that it's got to be something well how do you get this Revelation well first of all brother bear said you should pray for Revelation more than anything else how do you get this real he's so you can't give yourself Revelation he has to reveal it to you and that's sovereign he gives it to who he will well I'm living a good life that doesn't matter I mean that doesn't mean it doesn't matter it does that doesn't mean you're gonna it's gonna be revealed to you well how do you get it you wrestle between you guys are having it or your mom your dad having it you must have that Revelation yourself you must wrestle it out you had to have that root that that relationship with Christ and I'm not talking about just a church relationship when it comes Sunday morning and you're worship and you praise and you listen to the preacher and you say amen and you go out and say boy we had a good service can't wait till Wednesday night you're not going into reaction with the church relationship it's got to be a daily relationship you got to know and it's got to be something once you know him and you can't help but love him and when you love him you want to be with them and you don't want to make it some kind of Justice well I pray and read my Bible 15 minutes every night before I go to bed I'm gonna get in trouble here I'm gonna talk about stuff I got nothing about okay married couples okay I'm single in case you didn't know that never been married but let me ask you brother something who are married let's say you're at work and you think about your wife and you have a break so you call her up honey I just want to talk to you I just want to say hello and she said you know I'm really busy can we talk tonight at that 15 minute planned talk we have oh I just want to I know I know listen something just came up on Facebook I'm busy I gotta answer this all right we'll talk later how many guilty of something I'm not preaching against Facebook do whatever you want I don't care I'm not preaching against Facebook anymore I'm preaching against hunting anymore I'm preaching again hunt uh shopping or eating or anything else the only thing I'm saying is when you go do what you're going to do take Jesus with you take Jesus be sitting right beside you there when you're on Facebook when you're shopping when you're hunting whatever it is take him with you that's all he's asking for and I go with you can I be part of your life I give you 15 minutes every night what do you want I go to church twice a week I pay my times I live a good life what more are you looking for he's looking for love he hates religion he wants love that's all he's ever wanted is someone who wants to love him more than they love their Church well then they'll love their religion those Pharisees love the religion more they love Christ so they had to reject him and that's the same thing today that's why the denomination affected him many years ago because you have to humble yourself to be to be one of Christ and you had to suck you had to rest without yourself with Christ you as an individual it doesn't matter what church you go to it doesn't matter what you believe you have to wrestle it out you and God alone it's an individual walk it's not you and your church it's not you and your family it's not you and your pastor it's just you and Jesus Christ nothing else counts look at your life I challenge you look at your life who are you who are you do you have that relationship with Christ are you just a lukewarm messageably or sitting in a nice view in a nice church with a nice passion with a nice everything going on and you're being so blessed look around you because all that's fiction to fall apart I can tell you this I believe this with all my heart there's going to be a time and then very near future when all of a sudden these computers are gonna start filling up with all those people who have the last oh I want to get I'm not right with God I'm not right with God I got to get to church you know they're sitting out there just enjoying this nice bubble that's gonna burst let me ask you a question I'm so off my subject but anyways what if you knew you don't but what if you knew that the Rapture was going to happen next Sunday how would it change your life yeah would you also get serious oh so you're not serious now would you all sing it A Prayer life think about it he was on the cross and found me the Son of God come down off the cross mocking him trying to see if it was trying to prove to themselves it wasn't him because they did not want to accept that's that's who it was they didn't want to accept it Matthew 8 28 I want to read something here if you want to turn to it that's fine but you don't have to so this was a little bit later after the Temptation This is when Jesus had gone about doing some mighty works and you know what the demons find out babe this is the real deal right here 8 28 and when he was coming to the other side into the country of the good scenes there Mayhem two possessed with Devils coming out of the tombs exceeding Fierce so that no man might pass that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee Jesus thou Son of God what a difference they are still asking questions but it was no more a question of who he was those demons identified who he was they knew who he was the religious people were calling him a devil the Devils were calling him God asking him what do we have to do with you why don't you leave us alone why don't why do you have to mess with it just we're happy here just don't come in here and stir things up just leave us alone I'm happy being a lukewarm message believer I'm happy sitting here in this seat why should you come and mess with me why do you get you may have to get me uncomfortable in my chair I have a good standing in the church thorn in your pastor's flesh let me I'm kind of just blunt for a second if you're a lukewarm message believer you are a thorn in your past with flesh because you bring that nasty spirit in here every time you come to church it's true if you want me to quit I'll quit these demons coming to identifying who he was and say why are you messing with us leave us alone they were done they asked another question all right now come hither to torment us before the time again they're asking the question and look what they're saying hey you torment me you who you are torments me oh brother and sister my do you recognize the authority of the word do you recognize who you are your job is to torment demons instead of them tormenting you all the time goodness sakes let's turn the tables on Friends you don't have to walk around being kicked around by Devils you can walk around kicking doubles around you have the authority of the word to be the same place he was Jesus is the same today as he ever was going about tormenting devils I am so tired of myself and other people walking around oh I'm just having such a hard time life is just so difficult I'm such a hard time being a Christian oh shut up if you want to want to complain go out one of the whiners and complainers are if you're ready to confess the word of God come into church and confess the word of God [Applause] fine goodness sakes why don't we we give the devil so much credit oh he just got this going on and he's taking my kids away he'd made me he's taking me make a sick and and I can't overcome this and I can't overcome this you're preaching Satan's gospel talking his language exactly right he loves it when you do that your brother Brown said this ain't a dry quote but you can look it up he said when you go around confessing oh I'm a weak a weak Christian yeah God wants to kick you around he don't want to hear you because I'm so weak Lord oh just quit you've been taught better than that he's at high priest of your profession why you say he'll come come to that and if you confess so I'm just a weak Christian I can't overcome anything he said well you're right my hands are off I can't do anything with you yeah I have to tell myself a couple nights ago I I had a rough evening I was gonna well okay this got worse than I thought I was gonna spend time just praying and studying and I got busy on some other ridiculously nonsense total wasted time and all of a sudden it's time to go to bed and I just felt condemned like oh I wasted all this time you know what I'm talking about [Applause] I got in bed I lay down there I said God I don't even know what to say just feeling bad he said yes do start praising me well that takes some humbling hallelujah thank you Lord for a great day thank you for this and you know why the Holy Spirit just come right there and everything is just fine all he was looking for was my profession that he could come and bless me well I could have wild in my my misery oh I'm such a poor woman I was so bad I feel so bad whatever you want to be a victim they got plenty of people out there who are preaching preaching victimhood the whole left is preaching victimhood it's got some kind of some kind of great you know it's the best thing to do is to be a victim I didn't looking for victims he's looking for Victors he's looking for Overcomers he's looking for someone to take him at his work so he can come and move to the profession of his word that's all he's looking for yeah let's keep looking at these folks here they said are you kind of headed to torment us before the time now I don't know exactly what that means torments before the time I'll imagine it has to sending them back to hell because friends the demons themselves hate hell they don't want to go to hell they want to be out here on Earth where they can torment people and live in people and even live in pigs they're ready to live in pigs go to hell can you imagine if we have to go there friends don't go to hell you don't have to you don't have to what the world has to offer I promise you is not worth it gracious quit listening to the devil tell you all this is going to be good you don't want it's so hard to be a Christian you think it's hard to be a Christian [Music] how hard is it to be a sinner they're the most miserable I've ever seen I work in mental health with troubled kids you want to see troubled unhappy kids they're out there serving the devil as hard as they can they're the most miserable suicidal people I've ever seen that's what you get for serving the devil he promised you all this stuff and you find out I'm so miserable I can't stand myself they're miserable out there they can't decide who they are they're getting all these changes getting all this stuff done we're giving puberty blockers to five and seven-year-old kids that's just Insanity we're we're doing surgery on people changing their gender before they're even an adult what kind of heathens are we just devil possessed and that's better than being a Christian they think you're odd they think you're insane we think they're insane they walk in and said look at you insane people yo I got natural hair color where are your nose rings for goodness sakes how can you be happy without a nose ring I don't see any tax and all you identify as the gender uh prescribe that birth you must be miserable a sign that bro that's the word I mean let me ask you something how if I if my boss will fire me if she hears but that's okay how do you assign a gender at Birth when the person comes out of the womb that way they come out either male or female in the doctor and it says hmm eeny meeny miny moe oh we got 50 hundreds of genders so let's assign this gender over here it's not actually a gender but we'll make one up for it it's not a signed up birth is a sign that conception in fact it's a sign in God's mind before the foundation of the world if you're one of his that's right he knew what you were going to be I still ain't come to the best part here he said oh that kind of hit it to torment us before the time and there was a good way off from them and heard of many swine feeding this Devils we saw him saying listen if thou be I'm sorry if thou casteth out suffer us go away into the hurtless line the Devils were asking Mercy don't send us back to Hell let us go into the pigs they are asking mercy and and this is the best part I said if thou cast us out it wasn't can you there was no question there was no like well we're gonna try and stay here they knew he had the authority to say go and he did all he said was go he didn't scream or shout or do anything he just said go to do off they go because he knew who he was if thou cast this out friends do you recognize that you had that same Authority when God reveals to you something and you stand the authority of the word you can go to that whatever that situation is and there's no question that devil has to go he can't stay there if all all the devils in hell were there they have to go because you're standing on the authority of the word because you know who you are you know who you are you've been identified the word has identified you the token is on display in your life and you can see who you are and the Devils know who you are and if you go up and pray for someone and then you pray to cast them out and that devil says well who are you I'm way ahead of myself I'm gonna back up we'll get to that later Lord willing but friends recognize who you are you are here as the bride of Christ all hell all Heaven is for you all hell is against you and with the revelation of Jesus Christ the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you you know what the problem is we're afraid of the gates of hell if the gates of hell are around you need to go down and kick it down don't be afraid of it don't make some compromise don't sit back as well if you leave me alone I'll leave you alone don't leave them alone they're Bluff all he is is a bluff and Friends Satan will try to Bluff you and try to Bluff you but he knows if you're a buff or not and here's the thing you can be a born-again child of God and go to pray for someone and the devil just looks like you like whatever because you don't have that Revelation enough of who you are it's not it's clear enough it's you don't have the Revelation even to pray for that situation or to do with that because you haven't wrestled it out with God enough to get to that point yeah a baby is born to a family at a very young age maybe from birth that that that baby can identify who mom is if you asked him who's mom he'd go he can't say anything but something decided to identify he gets a little older he says dada mama he can sort of identify he gets an order he said that's my dad that's my mom he's starting to identify who he is oh I belong to this family and the older he gets the more he can identify who he is see brother Brown said once the bridalizes who she is recognizes who she is the rapture goes you say well we all know her bride was taking so long because we're going through a growing process because we had to come to a point where we take over dad's business watch that business it should cast Devils out and send them back to hell I hope it's okay for me to say that Jesus had mercy and they said go to the pigs I'm going to say go back to hell I hope that's all right hey they drowned the pigs they had to get out of them anyway so they still have a place to go that's our job friends is to withstand Satan withstand the devil to be the light in this world to be Christ in this generation but until we grow up and it doesn't come you grow into it you go battles to your tryouts to your dancers all these things you keep growing and growing until Dad hands you the checkbook he hands you the keys to the truck and you go down to the bank and said I need a loan and they say sign your name I don't need my dad's signature no you got the same Authority he does are you there [Applause] are you there do you stand there in front of the devil and say I know who I am and I Know Who You Are and you're gonna leave because my papa told me to tell you to get out it's true he has to go friends you can be anointed and scream and shout and pray and anoint with oil and everything over that person but if you don't have the authority to stand there and knowing who you are that Devil's gonna just sit there and go do if you don't care but will you stand there with the authority know who you are you're not bluffing anymore and he knows you're not bluffing he's got to go remember when was it uh Peter and John right at the gate they walk by and that person is asking alms he said silver and gold have another one I have what I give I give to you what I have I give to you and why did he picked him up and that man jumped up right away he started jumping and shouting and being he was healed a lot you know what that devil never said that devil never said well you can't do that that devil recognized the authority of those men and he goes out of there and he was fleeing out of there he's I'm out of here man you could go ahead and walk because he knew that it was not a question of candidate it was if you cast me out I said yes we're going to cast you out now go part of the problem is when it doesn't happen immediately like that we start doubting you lay your hands on the sick to be prayed for and to heal him and it you know we pray and we believe and then it doesn't happen and it doesn't happen we start wondering well maybe well maybe uh what do you mean maybe what do you mean baby is it God's word or is it not he's just testing you to see if you believe who you say you are that's all it is he's just testing you if thou cast this out I love it it's time to torment Devil's friends it's time for us to stand up and be the bride of Christ notice excuse me how much time do I okay being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question by being personally identified not Church identified personal just you if no one else in this church is identified by the original headship you are you are I am that's what brother Brandon said if one person in your city goes in the Rapture you got to know it's you sorry for the rest of you because I'm gone no because I taught myself into no because it's been proven the Holy Spirit has identified Who I Am by the revelation of Jesus Christ to me personally personally identified you as an individual identified by the original headship what's that that's the pure word living through you manifesting what the word is supposed to manifest in this day as an individual not my church just you we had the answer to the devil's question he Christ has risen has paid the price and raising up the body let me skip down a little bit just to save time he said you think I'd be signed myself I'm not we've got the devil's answer it's not me that liveth but Christ the word living in me I have no power over any demon I am not smart enough I'm not spiritual enough I can overcome anything I can do nothing but it's not me it's him was living in me and he's identifying Christ and flesh today it's the very mystery be that God wants you to know it's Christ in you the hope of glory it's not me it's him and me and Satan hates you for that because that's where he has the biggest struggle is when Christ forget in a human being and start manifesting yourself and Satan can't stop it he can stop religion he can stop all kinds of movements he can stop anointings but he cannot stop Christ and flesh the hope of glory you can't stop it we got the devil's answer it's not me but Christ that liveth in me now we are the sons of God not will not we will be but we are oh that's such a great Doctrine that's such a great thing to confess now I am a Son of God and I am a son of God does it prove does your life prove that or do you just try to get religious to try to work something up Fred don't work anything out just let the Holy Spirit Come and prove Who You Are you're his witness let him use you to witness the kingdom of God is within you what does that even mean if the kingdom of God is within you that means there's a king residing within you and when a king resides and so he can take Dominion and he is looking for somebody to take dominion over this Earth to take dominion over Devils he's looking for someone's hands and arms and mouth and heart and body to use so he can take dominion over everything he's supposed to take dominion over in this age and that means every devil oh he's looking for someone who recognizes who they are they come to places dad give me the checkbook I'm ready to go to battle I'm ready to go to work I'm ready to do what you asked me to do because I recognize who I am it's not just I gotta get down here it's not just an anointing you get a church so many times okay I'm sorry I have to go here I don't go to youth services meetings too much anymore they said I'm too old they kick me out right but I talked to a lot of people who do I got friends that go there and they talk about and you could use Services here and you know it's a wonderful atmosphere and the kids are all up front and they're they're anointed and they're praising God and this wonderful atmosphere saying anything against that but six weeks later you can talk to them they haven't changed some of them some of them absolutely changed wonderful but so many you talk to him and said why'd you go to the front because everyone else did that's one of the worst reasons to go to the front what are you going from because I wanted to feel the anointing that's not the new birth you can feel that really and then what happens is they start going from one your service to the next to the next because it's like getting at their high like they're addicted and I have to go get another anointing so I can feel good but that relationship with Christ isn't there for so many of them I'm not please I am not diminishing Youth Services I think they're incredibly vital incredibly helpful but but we got to make sure the kids know what they're looking for don't look on my hair looking for a sensation don't come looking up Eric should jump in bubble dance of that why are you dancing why are you shouting I believe in shouting I believe in dancing but why are you doing it just because you feel something all right that will never put you in a rupture let's be honest oh my God now we are sons of God now we will be we are now we're redeemed we have Satan's answer God Vindicated himself God proved himself to his promise in this day the headship is here that's his answer who are you I am the manifestation of the word for this day that's who I am who are you you're a devil going to a devil's hell you're going to be totally annihilated and we are not even when you're not even a member anymore I'm still going to be alive and well torment the Devils with that instead of letting them kick you around tell them about their future home they come and say well you're not going to the Rapture you don't know that devil don't know if you're going in the Rapture or not so quit listening to what he has to say because he got he's got a mountain as high as this building with all the evidence proving that you're not a Christian and all you have is one little promise from God and so you got one little promise in here you got Satan's pile of evidence to prove that you're not a believer you say I'll take this I'll take this because this will last when the world is gone and everything Heaven and Earth will pass away but this promise can't pass away that means all his lies will pass away but that promise won't pass away are you a believer amen praise the Lord oh my God man was put here with dominion over the Earth he had everything under his control Adam lost it Jesus prude he had restored he stopped nature raids that they did another thing the world is growing today the Bible said for the manifestations of the sons of God the whole world you know why it's going crazy out there nature is waiting for you and I to come to our place where we take minion like we're supposed to yeah for God to get into his children again in reality and make things real is stumbles the people he gave them dominion over the Earth but his Fallen estate dropped that but what they lost by Adam it was restored by Christ we had to be restored back go listen to gadget Christ is a mystery that third phase is to take all the way back to everything Adam and even Eve lost in Eden is restored to us we needed to stop believing what the word says about us friends amen kingdom of God within you friends let me just see if I can just quit here you must be identified Brother Brad says this is spiritual Amnesia you must be identified somewhere you must show your live shows tonight where you are identified you identified either in Christ or out of Christ your life bruising you are not halfway a friend of mine was talking to the sister just recently Church having service he went up to he said are you are you born again she said I don't know well I do if you don't know you're probably not that doesn't mean you're not going to have doubts and Satan's going to prove you're not that's what I'm talking about at all but when it comes down to that question sinks down deep You're Going To Know Who You Are if you take God out his word you're not halfway there's no such thing as a drunk sober man there's no black white bird you're either saved or you're not saved you're a saint or a sinner one or the other listen to this please your spiritual attitude towards God's word identifies you exactly where you're standing what is your spiritual attitude towards God's word it tells you who you are Satan sees that he sees your attitude towards the word and then when you come to pray and he knows you're bluffing he just laughs at you but if your spiritual attitude towards the word is I'm a Believer and no matter what this circumstance no matter what Satan puts on me no matter what's going on no matter how much I fail no matter what so all this stuff going on but I know I'm a Believer because I've been identified by the word itself then when you walk up he starts you know what he'll do he's such a he is he's a car he's a boy and while he'll do he'll stop backing if you walk toward he'll back up and says come on man I ain't afraid of you come on you gotta pray for him I don't care yeah I'm not afraid of you he's backed up the whole time he is because he knows who you are [Applause] yes he knows that you have authority over him he'll scream and shout and Bluff and do everything else but when you speak he's got to go because it's the word of God speaking through you it's not your own word and you cannot go and do this well if I do that I'm gonna go heal people I'm gonna save them I'm gonna do it no you're not because you don't get that kind of authority until you got the the the character to handle it God don't give you the checkbook until he says okay you're ready to be led by the spirit remember Jesus could himself he had to do what the spirit led him to do he wanted that pull up it says the Bethesda or whatever that was he walked up there and there's one man and he healed and he walked away there's all these other sick people around you think Jesus the man did not want to heal every one of them of course he did he said I always that was pleased with the father all that my father showed to me that what to do if you don't show me something I don't do it and that's the same thing with the mature bride of Christ and she will go and do what he says and she won't do anything else with it because that's not what his will is see human Humanity doesn't understand that at all they think if he's a god of Mercy he should just save everybody well he's given a chance they just don't love this God of Mercy that's the problem they love their own God the Satan will say when you die you're lost say you're wrong I have the perfectest product I'm the purchase product I have the token what is the token listen to this he knows what it is don't fool with him he knows what it is now you might talk to these preachers they'd argue if you're not Satan he knows better he came against it two or three times you know made a mistake of Temptation Satan knows what you're talking about just show that token he'll fly Satan knows if you're bluffing or not he knows it can read one more quote they try to figure out Jesus how do you do these things what done it he he said I'll ask you a question was the ministry of John the Baptist was it a God or was it a man they said we can't say he said neither do I tell you that's right he went on he wasn't going to mess with those make-believing lukewarm so-called believers from henceforth no man asked him anything he just cut them off when Satan comes and starts tormenting in your mind about something whatever just cut him off don't argue with the devil you're going to lose every argument with the devil all right because that's all he wants you to do just cut him off just take them and say hey satan this is the word now shut up and walk away will he quit tormenting me he might he might not would you still do the same thing don't start picking up an argument with him he'll just get you all wore out and stressed he just cut them off he didn't tell them nothing about it none of their business he had a work to do and he finished it oh my what an attitude it's none of your business someone wants to come argue with was the prophet right about this was he right about this you know what go argue with someone else I ain't got time for you devil I ain't got time to discuss this with you because you don't want to find an excuse not to believe the message is true you want to listen to some devil that told you it's not true because you can't explain everything the prophet said you would have done the same thing but Jesus well he said except you drink my blood and eat my flesh you have no part in me and they said this is a hard thing who can say it we can't understand this and they walked away that's why they're walking away from the message today because they can't understand everything prophecy and the reason he said the things the way he did is so they would walk away he has to cut them loose because they're just hanging on they're just they're just hair in the biscuit they're just gonna be a problem they're bringing that nasty spirit and we need to get that out of here so we can have the fellowship of Jesus Christ hey man it's none of their business he had to work today he finished it not help us to do the same thing that's what your Prophet said do the same thing he said we don't have to answer the devil's question we don't have to answer the devil's question if thou be so and so you're responsible for that Gospel of preachers and that's all not how it's written it's just responsible for saying it I'm not response for anything but say what he gave me to say tonight and if you will hear what I'm saying my words they have spirit and they have life and you can receive what you want from Jesus Christ tonight because he set me up here with the word to tell you that he's here to take care of your needs if you'll just stand and believe who you are that's all you have to do that's all you have to do is accept your spiritual attitude towards the word it dictates who you are and where you stand tonight personally oh praise the Lord [Music] all he ever wants all he wants is just that relationship with he just he just wants you he don't want your religion your son's a schema they came and they said hey I think we're going to identify ourselves as some Holiness preachers here we're going to cast out some devils and they try to do it without the authority of the word it says those Devils say you know he said in the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches and that devil said you know Jesus we know Paul I'm not sure who you are they kicked their tail clear out of all seven of them naked and wounded yeah what about you who are you Jesus I know Paul I know brother random I know brother Thomas I know who are you who are you this is a question you ask her personally you can ask your pastor Who You Are you can ask your mom or dad Who You Are you have to know from God he's the only one who can reveal it to you and the way you get that is because you and him have a relationship because you wrestle it out with him it's not well I have a 10 minute prayer and he didn't say anything so I'll just go do something else every day well I'm busy brother Phil okay well I tell you what when you're in the when you're in the tribulation period you're gonna be busy like you never thought be busy because you're too busy to have a relationship with Christ he said I'm too busy to put you in a rapture what is what is eternal life worth to you what's it worth who are you I believe you all could stand us out I'm a Child of God I'm a born-again child God can you do that isn't that good stand up say it I just asked you let's all stand just raise your praise God a little bit God you ever reveal yourself to me you have shown me who I am and I stand here tonight as a child of God Hallelujah Lord Jesus we just thank you for this service we thank you that you would come tonight and just have your way we thank you that you would encourage us Lord and just show how Satan comes against us to try to weaken us but Lord Jesus you are strong you've given us your word to withstand him and all his demons that come against us and when he wants to come and prove to us who who we say that we are not who we say we are but your word comes and proves that yes we are we are the born-again by the Jesus Christ Lord we just I just ask that you would come now and touch each heart you would come and just have your way Among Us Lord Jesus let the word sink in there let it produce what you wanted to produce don't let that word return void but let it just move upon each one and bring a closer walk with Christ Lord when something is trying to to interfere with our relationship with you let this just expose that and just move it aside and we can just die to that thing and just grow in the spirit and if we have to walk through the desert won't let us walk to the desert we have to climb the mountains we have to go through the seeds whatever it is Lord Jesus the Lord just have your hand on us and help us just to be led by your spirit and everything we do that we can come to through the trials and we can raise their hand and say God put me through this and he brought me all the way through and praise God I'm quoted him than I ever was before Lord Jesus just reveal us reveal who we are Lord show us let's cause us to grow so we have a greater Revelation day by day Lord Jesus father we ask this in your name and it's easy to ask this because it's your will for your bride it's not hard to ask these things it's not hard to say that you're going to do this for us because this is what you promised to do all we want to do or Jesus is get out of the way and let you have your way in our life father we ask this Lord Jesus in your name amen praise the Lord isn't he wonderful my goodness to sit there and just try to contemplate who the word says I am sometime it boggles my mind and my head doesn't accept you my head say no it can't be and you know one of the hardest things the hardest thing is it can't be that simple how can it be so simple that all I have to do is take this word that he shows me and believe it he said now stand still and watch the power of God in your life he said but why but what a nice person do you already did it you believed what he said oh it can't be that simple and sane says you gotta try you got to be more faithful you got to do this you gotta do that and God says are you gonna listen to him or me stand still and see the power of God in your life just believe what he says and then when he tells you to do something go do it Brother Brad said we got so impatient we get ahead of him we try to accomplish something on our own and all he do is get in his way I'm trying to quit preaching I tell you what
