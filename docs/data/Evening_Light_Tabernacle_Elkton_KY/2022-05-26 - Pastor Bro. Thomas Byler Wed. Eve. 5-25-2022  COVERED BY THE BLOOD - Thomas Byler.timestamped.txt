[22:10] amen and amen
[22:12] if you will turn your bibles
[22:14] amen i have several scriptures here
[22:18] amen
[22:23] and i think we'll start with perhaps
[22:26] let's go with romans 4
[22:28] romans 4.
[22:41] and we'll go
[22:44] with
[22:46] one through eight
[22:47] what shall we say then that abraham our
[22:50] father as pertaining unto the flesh is
[22:52] found
[22:54] for if abraham were justified by works
[22:57] he hath whereof to glory but not before
[23:00] god
[23:01] for what saith the scripture abraham
[23:03] believed god and it was counted unto him
[23:05] for righteousness
[23:07] now to him that worketh it is reward
[23:10] is the reward not reckoned of grace but
[23:12] of debt
[23:13] but to him that worketh not but
[23:15] believeth on him to justify the ungodly
[23:18] his faith being counted for
[23:20] righteousness even as david also
[23:23] describes the blessedness of man
[23:26] unto whom the lord
[23:28] unto whom god imputeth righteousness
[23:30] without
[23:32] works saying blessed are they whose
[23:35] iniquities are forgiven
[23:37] and whose sins
[23:39] are covered amen blessed is the man to
[23:42] whom the lord will not
[23:46] impute sick and
[23:48] be seated my mind uh
[23:52] i feel like the lord just
[23:54] [Music]
[23:56] laid this on my heart to speak on
[23:58] on assurance i want to
[24:00] call i'm going to title this covered by
[24:02] the blood but i want to
[24:04] take that word covered for a minute amen
[24:06] how many knows that that covered
[24:08] according to
[24:09] brother branham he said
[24:11] he he said that the word religion
[24:14] means covering amen
[24:17] it means a covering amen so if we're
[24:20] covered by something it means that we're
[24:22] under something amen we're taken care of
[24:24] so to speak and it reminded me of having
[24:27] perhaps an insurance policy in that
[24:30] right and being covered by insurance
[24:32] policy and all the things that a
[24:34] insurance policy will cover you amen and
[24:37] when you are under the blood under
[24:40] christ or in christ
[24:42] there is a lot of things that's covered
[24:44] how many believe that
[24:47] a lot of things it's covered
[24:48] and tonight i want to speak speak to you
[24:50] with the help of the lord about some of
[24:53] those things that are covered and
[24:55] some things that are covered and some of
[24:57] uh takes few illustrations of a few
[25:00] characters through the bible amen of of
[25:03] that were
[25:04] uh blessed amen and i guess right here's
[25:07] a good one to start with because david
[25:09] talked about the blessedness of man
[25:12] amen
[25:14] how many believe you're blessed
[25:16] to be under the blood of jesus christ
[25:19] david was blessed now
[25:21] i'm going to go for a minute into the
[25:23] old testament because we know that uh
[25:26] in the old under the old testament
[25:28] they would sacrifice sheep and whatever
[25:31] god required right
[25:33] and every year they had to come and they
[25:35] had to make sacrifices
[25:37] they had to continuously do it after
[25:41] year after year after year
[25:44] and
[25:45] they were all and those sins were only
[25:47] covered by the blood amen one place i
[25:50] believe the prophet god said they
[25:51] weren't forgiven they were still there
[25:53] and those that died could go into a
[25:55] place called paradise but they couldn't
[25:57] go on up into the presence of god until
[26:00] christ came that's why when christ came
[26:02] and when he paid the ultimate price
[26:04] that's when the substitute and all of
[26:06] that was taken care of by the blood and
[26:08] they could go out of paradise up into
[26:11] the presence of god amen
[26:13] and so it was just a covering in the old
[26:15] testament but in the new testament under
[26:17] christ it is a much deeper
[26:21] uh much deeper thought a man and much
[26:23] richer
[26:24] application in our lives it's not just
[26:27] not just covered but it's also
[26:29] completely done away with
[26:31] amen praise the lord
[26:34] you know and one of the first things
[26:35] that we look at is adam and eve after
[26:38] the fall we know that they covered
[26:40] themselves with fig leaves
[26:43] huh
[26:44] fig leaves they covered themselves and
[26:46] there was a religion but it was a
[26:48] man-made religion
[26:51] right
[26:52] and when god come down those fig leaves
[26:55] weren't good enough
[26:57] huh
[26:58] just think about it those fig leaves i
[27:00] mean they were covered their bodies
[27:01] probably no nakedness
[27:04] they were they were covered you think
[27:06] well that's modest
[27:08] huh
[27:09] but no it wasn't wasn't what god wanted
[27:11] that's not what was asking for he knew
[27:14] that because of their sin
[27:17] they couldn't even come before him they
[27:19] couldn't even communicate with him
[27:21] unless there's a sacrifice made that is
[27:24] for the sin that they committed
[27:26] and so god we know that he took a lamb
[27:29] in that right and killed that lamb and
[27:32] dressed them in lambskins and so when
[27:34] they went walking through the garden
[27:37] they're not even crying
[27:41] but at least they could have an audience
[27:42] at least they could communicate with god
[27:44] and we know that all through the old
[27:45] testament god would communicate man with
[27:47] man because of a substitute amen which
[27:51] was a figure of the lamb of god that was
[27:53] going to take away the sins of the world
[27:56] amen
[27:57] so praise the lord
[28:00] amen we think about david and think
[28:01] about how
[28:03] and it's simply amazing how what what
[28:05] the blood of jesus christ
[28:08] amen we'll cover first of all
[28:11] amen as like i said i'ma just kind of
[28:13] take this in a little bit different way
[28:14] than what perhaps what we're used to but
[28:17] in colossians 2
[28:18] and verse 2 it says that their hearts
[28:21] might be comforted being knit together
[28:23] in love
[28:24] and unto now this is assurance that
[28:27] we're looking for
[28:28] unto all riches of the full
[28:32] assurance not insurance even though in
[28:35] the interpretation under siri talks
[28:38] about the assurance being the same as
[28:40] insurance amen it's assurance in other
[28:42] words if i assure you of something uh
[28:44] i'm i i'm making it good amen that's
[28:47] what insurance is amen it's you know
[28:50] if he was in a wreck amen and that what
[28:53] is the
[28:54] first thing that somebody's gonna ask
[28:56] are you gonna ask the other person
[28:59] do you got insurance
[29:01] or are you covered right are you covered
[29:05] are you covered do you have insurance
[29:07] and uh yeah we ain't got nothing to
[29:09] worry about i got real insurance i got
[29:11] real good real good insurance then again
[29:13] well i'm glad for that
[29:15] huh
[29:16] and so you think about it you know
[29:18] covered by where and here he talks about
[29:20] unto the riches of the full assurance of
[29:24] understanding to the acknowledgement of
[29:27] the mystery of god and of the father and
[29:30] of christ
[29:32] amen hebrews 10
[29:34] it says it this way he says let us draw
[29:36] near
[29:38] with a true heart in full assurance
[29:43] amen
[29:44] in full assurance of faith
[29:47] having a heart sprinkled from an evil
[29:50] conscience in our bodies washed with
[29:52] pure water and let us hold fast a
[29:54] profession in our faith without wavering
[29:56] for his faithful who has promised now
[29:58] how many knows that our assurance is in
[30:01] god tonight
[30:04] amen
[30:06] and you can relax
[30:08] amen
[30:09] how many knows when you're driving down
[30:11] the road and you don't have insurance
[30:14] huh and you almost wreck into a
[30:16] lamborghini
[30:18] hundred thousand dollar car you're gonna
[30:20] be sweating
[30:23] oh man i'm nervous
[30:25] but you know it's the same way in life
[30:27] you go throughout if you go through life
[30:29] without endurance of faith and having
[30:32] god in your heart you ought to be
[30:34] nervous i mean that's how the world are
[30:37] the whole world is nervous because they
[30:38] don't have that assurance
[30:40] when you have that assurance amen i
[30:42] believe they call it in a song that said
[30:44] blessed assurance jesus is mine oh what
[30:48] a foretaste of glory divine it's a
[30:50] blessed thing to have assurance like
[30:52] this to be covered
[30:54] by the blood amen
[30:57] praise the lord
[30:59] so he talks here
[31:00] amen in romans there he says
[31:05] in cautions and also hebrews now i was
[31:07] going to read the whole chapter there of
[31:09] hebrews but we won't but we know that it
[31:12] teaches there
[31:13] in hebrews the 10th chapter that the law
[31:16] had a shadow of good things to come
[31:19] amen but could never those sacrifices
[31:22] which they offered year by year
[31:23] continually could never make the comers
[31:26] there unto perfect in other words it
[31:29] could may never make them what they were
[31:31] supposed to be
[31:34] amen
[31:36] let me tell you something any man-made
[31:38] religion any substitute will never
[31:42] bring you to the place that you need to
[31:44] be
[31:44] it'll never give you the peace or the
[31:48] comfort that you need to have
[31:50] no substitute will ever do it
[31:52] and how many knows this world
[31:55] our religious world is covered with
[31:58] substitutes
[32:01] amen we have millions of so-called
[32:04] christians that have fig leaf religion
[32:07] in other words this is how i feel to do
[32:10] it
[32:11] huh kind of like cain right cain he said
[32:14] he offered the sacrifices he was
[32:16] religious
[32:18] amen he went to church because he people
[32:20] like to feel like they're okay
[32:23] so they do stuff
[32:25] but that doesn't make them okay doesn't
[32:27] it there's only one thing that'll make
[32:28] you okay and that is if you do it like
[32:30] abel did
[32:32] because he's god said to cain he said do
[32:34] it like able it and i'll accept that
[32:37] because he did it right way
[32:39] that's where we find that millions will
[32:41] be disappointed on the day of judgment
[32:43] you'll think well didn't i do this yeah
[32:45] but you went with a substitute
[32:48] amen
[32:50] but we want to be so careful to make
[32:51] sure that we are under not like this
[32:53] here i like that word full assurance
[32:57] not liability
[32:59] but full assurance how many likes full
[33:01] insurance
[33:02] how about if you're driving around in a
[33:04] brand new vehicle and and you go up to
[33:06] the insurance company
[33:09] only a stupid person would say i want
[33:11] liability on this eagle
[33:16] it's okay to say amen amen
[33:20] my teacher my teacher well years ago
[33:22] she said many hands she says i want to
[33:25] teach you something many hands make
[33:27] light work
[33:30] and i was at the mommy's boy i was like
[33:31] what in the world does that riddle me
[33:35] and he said well i didn't say that but i
[33:37] thought and i was like i have no idea
[33:39] what how many hands make light work i
[33:40] mean she says that means if you have a
[33:42] lot of people and then pulling on
[33:44] something it makes it much lighter well
[33:45] tonight i thought well we have a lot
[33:47] fewer people so you're going to have to
[33:48] pull a little harder tonight
[33:52] mean believe that that's right
[33:54] but it takes pulling from the holy
[33:55] spirit amen
[33:57] praise be to god
[33:59] oh my
[34:00] full
[34:02] coverage
[34:04] hallelujah i praise the lord how many is
[34:08] glad for full coverage
[34:10] i'm glad for full assurance
[34:13] you don't have to just wonder because
[34:15] the bible even talks about all those old
[34:18] testament days anybody that come up to
[34:21] death was always kind of worried about
[34:22] death always a little scared of death
[34:24] because they couldn't come into it with
[34:26] the confidence that you and i can come
[34:28] into it now
[34:29] amen
[34:31] they always fear death but you don't i
[34:33] don't have to fear death now because we
[34:35] know that our sins are not just under a
[34:37] blanket somewhere not just put away but
[34:40] they're completely divorced i believe
[34:42] that's the way the of god did not
[34:43] just put it away but they're completely
[34:45] annihilated
[34:48] aren't you glad that
[34:51] let me see here
[34:57] here it is
[34:58] we'll pick up
[34:59] on hebrews
[35:01] the ninth eighth chapter
[35:04] and
[35:07] maybe
[35:12] verse seven for if that first covenant
[35:14] had been faultless
[35:16] then should no place for
[35:19] have been sought for a second in other
[35:20] words if that sin would have worked
[35:24] if that covering would have worked then
[35:26] we wouldn't need nothing else right
[35:28] if it had been perfect well you wouldn't
[35:29] have need to christ
[35:31] so it wasn't perfect that's what the
[35:32] bible's saying here
[35:34] for finding fault with them he said
[35:36] behold the days come saith the lord when
[35:38] i will make a new covenant with the
[35:39] house of israel and without of judah
[35:42] not according to the covenant that i
[35:44] made with their fathers in the day when
[35:46] i took them by the hand and let them out
[35:47] of the land of egypt because they
[35:49] continued not in my covenant and i
[35:51] regarded them not saith the lord for
[35:54] this is the covenant that i will make
[35:56] with the house of israel after those
[35:58] days saith the lord
[36:01] amen i will put my laws
[36:05] not on a table like he did moses right
[36:09] no he's not going to put it on the table
[36:11] but where is god's law now
[36:15] i will write them in their hearts
[36:20] i want you to know that every believer
[36:23] every christian has god's commandments
[36:27] written in their hearts
[36:32] why do you think that when you do
[36:33] something wrong that scripture will come
[36:35] up to you
[36:36] that is what pops up in your mind
[36:39] or before you do something wrong it'll
[36:42] come up and it'll it'll it'll come right
[36:44] to you
[36:46] brother bible doesn't have to be there
[36:49] my brother my sister nobody else has got
[36:51] to be there closer hey now you shouldn't
[36:53] do that
[36:54] no you got something in here that tells
[36:56] you
[36:57] you know what the word says about it how
[36:59] many clap for that
[37:00] write them in their hearts
[37:02] and i will be to them a god and they
[37:05] shall be to me a people and they shall
[37:08] not teach every man his neighbor and
[37:10] every
[37:12] man his
[37:13] brother saying know the lord for all
[37:15] shall know me from the least to the
[37:17] greatest
[37:18] and i will be merciful to their
[37:21] unrighteousness and their sins and their
[37:24] iniquities
[37:26] will i just cover up and bring up later
[37:28] on
[37:29] oh
[37:31] their sins and their iniquities will i
[37:34] remember
[37:35] no more
[37:37] i mean believe that if your sins have
[37:39] been forgiven if god does not impute
[37:42] iniquity to you
[37:43] you're a blessed person
[37:46] because i believe that god has a god has
[37:48] the ability to
[37:50] to to hold you accountable for your sins
[37:55] or he can forgive you
[37:58] amen
[38:00] because even paul
[38:01] said that he was a blasphemer he worked
[38:03] against god and so forth but the bible
[38:06] says he died but i did it ignorantly if
[38:08] god would have chose to he could have
[38:10] held him accountable for it god ever
[38:11] held you accountable for it but you'd be
[38:13] done
[38:15] one of the things that once is one of
[38:16] the things that god determines
[38:19] is whether or not you blaspheme against
[38:20] the holy ghost
[38:22] amen
[38:24] that can be as simple as making fun of a
[38:27] sister's hair in church
[38:29] or the way they dress or speaking in
[38:32] tongues or something that the holy ghost
[38:34] does
[38:35] when the holy ghost comes and does this
[38:36] you speak against that
[38:38] amen when you do speak against what the
[38:40] holy spirit does
[38:42] it can be blasphemy
[38:45] amen because you remember
[38:48] um
[38:49] i believe it was judas that wept
[38:51] bitterly and so forth repented and put
[38:53] his silver back to him and that right
[38:56] threw his silver back and went out and
[38:58] cried and wept everything there was no
[39:00] forgiveness
[39:02] amen
[39:05] that's why my friends you and i aren't a
[39:07] judge
[39:09] sometimes people will do things that you
[39:11] might think hey that looks like
[39:12] blasphemy
[39:14] huh
[39:16] but it's up to god
[39:18] he's a judge
[39:20] amen so we see here
[39:23] i like that i will remember no more amen
[39:27] in that he saith a new covenant he hath
[39:29] made first now that which decayeth and
[39:32] wax is old is ready to vanish away amen
[39:36] praise the lord
[39:38] all right so you look at that and let's
[39:40] talk about for a little bit let's look
[39:42] at uh
[39:43] david first of all
[39:45] david
[39:47] we like to preach him as
[39:49] the man after god's own heart we love to
[39:52] preach about david when
[39:54] he went out there by faith and salute
[39:56] goliath
[39:58] mighty acts that he did
[40:00] saul that killed his thousands but they
[40:03] wrote songs about david killing his ten
[40:06] thousands
[40:08] and david
[40:10] you know of course we know saul heard
[40:12] that songs that they wrote he was
[40:13] jealous
[40:15] he was jealous
[40:17] of david and he would one he tried to
[40:19] kill him
[40:20] but we find in david he knows that if
[40:23] god would have imputed the iniquity and
[40:25] the bad that david did
[40:27] he wouldn't have been around very long
[40:29] because even his own pronouncement and
[40:31] judgment upon the man that took that one
[40:34] little lamb and killed it isn't that
[40:35] right
[40:37] the rich man and so forth you know and
[40:39] he says well he shall surely die that
[40:41] was his judgment
[40:43] he says no samuel he says david you're
[40:46] the man that did that
[40:48] you took the right uriah he was nothing
[40:51] he was just a little guy but he was
[40:52] faithful and that's all he had and you
[40:54] took what he had
[40:57] first of all we know that it was
[40:59] adultery involved
[41:01] hello
[41:02] adultery
[41:04] murder
[41:09] huh
[41:10] you know sometimes we think oh well i
[41:12] tell you what i just don't think the
[41:14] lord can forgive me
[41:15] let me tell you god
[41:18] is able to
[41:22] there's a lot that's covered under it
[41:24] but god forgave david didn't he
[41:26] god forgave david sure he punished him
[41:28] for what he did and so forth but he
[41:30] didn't kill him
[41:32] because that's what he deserved
[41:34] amen
[41:36] but he knew what it was like to be under
[41:38] that blood and he was covered and god
[41:39] was watching over him and now the other
[41:42] one that i don't even hardly like to
[41:43] talk about there's one so much until you
[41:45] know you almost wonder whether he would
[41:47] be deserving of heaven at all
[41:50] and most people had a question about
[41:52] whether this guy ever made it to heaven
[41:54] or not it was a man that disobeyed god
[41:56] he was a king
[41:57] and in the first commandment the first
[41:59] thing that he was supposed to do he
[42:01] didn't obey it
[42:03] and ever since he didn't obey it god
[42:05] sent an evil spirit on him and he was
[42:07] tormented all his life he tried to kill
[42:10] david time and time again
[42:14] his name was saul right
[42:16] time and then after god's after notice
[42:19] this
[42:20] because it was a strong penalty for
[42:22] touching god's anointed
[42:25] you speak or do anything towards god's
[42:27] anointing it's usually a real strong
[42:29] penalty for something like that
[42:32] it was so strong that day but whenever
[42:34] he got the opportunity to kill saul he
[42:36] says
[42:37] i can't kill i can't touch god's
[42:39] anointed
[42:41] scripture says touch not mine anointed
[42:43] do my prophets no harm
[42:45] that right
[42:46] remember the
[42:48] i'm not sure i don't think it was a
[42:49] malachite but it was somebody that had
[42:51] come into the camp of israel and when
[42:53] saul actually
[42:55] uh i think i saw that
[43:00] it fell on his sword
[43:03] and
[43:04] tried to kill himself but he wouldn't
[43:06] die
[43:07] didn't quite kill him didn't quite get
[43:09] the job done and i ordered him to get
[43:12] jump on him and kill him
[43:14] because he didn't want to be killed by
[43:15] the enemy so the young man did and he
[43:18] came back and bragged about it today hey
[43:20] he told me to do it he wouldn't have
[43:22] lived anyway the young man said so i
[43:24] went ahead and i did what saul said
[43:27] and you know it got him killed right
[43:30] david later on says fall on him his own
[43:33] mouth testifies against him he touched
[43:35] god's anointed
[43:38] huh
[43:40] but what i thought about you know and
[43:42] all the things that solved it speak of
[43:44] all he did most people think that saul
[43:46] didn't make it and we wouldn't know
[43:49] whether he wouldn't know unless that a
[43:50] prophet in our age would have told us
[43:53] that right
[43:55] because you to think deny he can't make
[43:56] it we don't but you know the way that he
[43:59] knows the way that the private says and
[44:00] we know that he did is because when he
[44:02] went to
[44:04] find out whether he would win a war and
[44:05] so forth and he was
[44:07] inquiring of the lord the lord wasn't
[44:09] even answering the man anymore
[44:12] isn't that right so he went to the witch
[44:13] of endor was it you know he went up
[44:15] there and the witch and and so forth i
[44:17] want you to summon me up a spirit and
[44:19] and sure enough she summoned samuel up
[44:23] and she didn't realize maybe who it was
[44:25] going to be because after she was sum it
[44:27] up she says man you didn't tell me it
[44:29] was going to be him
[44:30] she didn't want no part of it
[44:32] but she pulled samuel up and there he
[44:34] was in his mantle
[44:36] isn't that right there he was and he
[44:38] says why have you brought me up and so
[44:40] forth he wanted to inquire whether he's
[44:42] gonna you know win the war
[44:44] and the way that we know that he made it
[44:46] is because the lost and the damned
[44:49] aren't in the same place
[44:51] and
[44:52] samuel told saul
[44:53] tomorrow you're going to be with me
[44:56] and tomorrow you're going to be with me
[44:58] where i am that's where you're going to
[44:59] be
[45:00] somebody knows god knows he's a judge
[45:04] but you think about the sins
[45:06] the things that
[45:08] even the substitute blood
[45:11] will cover
[45:13] amen
[45:14] how many knows that if our president
[45:18] chose to completely pardon the worst
[45:21] prisoner out there he could
[45:24] that president has the power to pardon
[45:26] who he wants
[45:28] i don't know how full extent of it but
[45:30] he can pardon me because he's the
[45:31] president and i'm gonna tell you aside
[45:33] this right now god's the same way he can
[45:36] pardon who he wants
[45:38] is that right
[45:42] amen
[45:47] we're not going to have time to go
[45:48] through all of them but
[45:50] amen how about jacob
[45:53] how many knows brother bam called him a
[45:54] little shyster he was a little deceiver
[45:57] he was a deceiver in a conniver and
[46:00] everything else and
[46:02] and stole the birthright from his
[46:04] brother when he got in the pinch and
[46:06] he was hungry you know for ebola
[46:12] journey abroad while he was deceiving
[46:14] and his father-in-law and all of that
[46:16] and getting all his cattle and great
[46:18] substance and everything else
[46:21] i think that's partially where he called
[46:22] jew a jew
[46:24] you know i i don't know i remember up in
[46:26] uh uh ohio there used to be a uh a jew
[46:30] up there guessing they try to make money
[46:32] any way they can right
[46:34] they go after that mighty dollar
[46:36] even the jews in wall street and
[46:38] everything else and we used to call them
[46:40] mute in german it's you that's all i uh
[46:43] you know he'll he'll take you for the
[46:45] last hour if you can you know
[46:47] and i guess you know it comes from
[46:48] perhaps early ninja whatever and that
[46:50] pardon but you know you know we call
[46:52] them jews but there's a lot of white
[46:53] folk whatever jews do it
[46:56] is that right
[46:58] but anyway jacob he was a real shyster
[47:00] he was a deceiver and everything else
[47:02] and and so forth and when he came back
[47:04] he was scared of what esau was going to
[47:07] do to him
[47:08] because of what he had done
[47:10] and he knew he had an army and
[47:12] everything else
[47:13] and so that night
[47:15] we know that uh jacob got in contact
[47:17] with the angel of the lord amen he was
[47:20] worried and so forth and and he wrestled
[47:22] with that angel all of that time
[47:25] huh
[47:27] that whole night he wrestled with the
[47:28] lord he wanted him to bless him
[47:30] amen we can't wrestle for five minutes
[47:33] with the lord sometimes when we want a
[47:34] blessing
[47:36] but anyway
[47:38] we know that he wrestled with the lord
[47:40] and and and i guess the angel grabbed
[47:42] the hole of his hip or something and
[47:44] and you know he finally blessed him and
[47:45] so forth but after that jacob could
[47:48] never walk right
[47:49] or should we say never walk the same way
[47:52] he walked right after that and after
[47:54] that his name was changed from jacob the
[47:57] scheister to
[47:58] the prince with god israel
[48:00] huh
[48:01] that's where israel comes from
[48:04] it's look at what god forgave for him
[48:06] look at look at what god forgave what he
[48:09] covered even under the old testament the
[48:11] things that were covered
[48:13] praise the lord
[48:16] amen
[48:18] let's come up a little bit let's come on
[48:20] up to
[48:22] perhaps the woman at the well
[48:26] huh
[48:27] the woman at the well as the prophet
[48:29] said you know she had to go out to the
[48:30] well at a sec at a different time
[48:33] because all the
[48:35] decent ladies with their daughters and
[48:37] everything that they had and they just
[48:39] didn't want their kids and to mingle
[48:41] with the prostitute
[48:43] she had to come out at a different time
[48:46] amen and
[48:48] and jesus
[48:49] somehow he sent the disciples away
[48:51] didn't he sent them to go get riddles
[48:54] there he was with this woman by herself
[48:56] which wasn't really all that
[48:58] not so wise as what we would call it
[49:00] today for a preacher to be with a a
[49:01] prostitute buyers even by himself
[49:04] but anyway when they come back you know
[49:06] he says you know this woman and so forth
[49:07] did you get food and so forth but in
[49:09] that time frame we know that he got the
[49:11] contact with it and asked for a drink
[49:13] and she said it's not right for a jew to
[49:16] ask a samaritan so forth you know for a
[49:18] drink or whatever you know we have to
[49:20] search customs this saturday but if you
[49:22] knew who you was talking to you'd ask me
[49:24] for a drink
[49:26] right
[49:29] because i give you the drink you'll
[49:31] never thirst again this is where we get
[49:33] the great fountain of water
[49:35] amen a well springing up into
[49:37] everlasting life that you never thirst
[49:39] again
[49:40] amen and she says give me this drink
[49:45] and what did he do
[49:47] he discerned her thoughts intense of her
[49:49] heart
[49:50] that was giving her the drink that she
[49:53] desired she realized that he was the
[49:55] messiah
[49:56] remember she said we know when messiah
[49:59] comes he'll do these things i am he is
[50:02] that right and furthermore you know she
[50:05] says you know go call your husband and
[50:07] so forth and then she said uh
[50:09] she says i've man got no husband
[50:13] yeah you're right you ain't got one but
[50:15] you the one you're with now is your
[50:17] fifth
[50:19] in other words she's living with them
[50:20] like husbands hello
[50:24] folks let me tell you something you let
[50:26] a woman like that nowadays how would you
[50:28] look at her
[50:30] huh but jesus himself
[50:32] had mercy because why because there was
[50:34] something down in here i mean knows
[50:36] that's what makes the difference that's
[50:38] what makes you blessed is because down
[50:40] in here that woman didn't really desire
[50:42] to be that way
[50:44] and he knew it she was a child of god
[50:46] the prophet of god said she had
[50:47] representation in her heart
[50:50] because jesus never did anything until
[50:52] the father showed him first it was the
[50:54] father that told him exactly what to do
[50:56] where to be and who to talk to
[51:00] amen
[51:03] now i'll just mention this i didn't look
[51:04] up the scriptures but remember i believe
[51:06] her name was mary i believe it is that
[51:07] washed his feet and with her hair and so
[51:09] forth and before she did all of that she
[51:11] went and took her prostitute money the
[51:13] alabaster box right took that money
[51:16] and went bought the finest perfumes that
[51:18] she possibly could buy
[51:21] you know and and even the according to
[51:23] the way the prophet put it you know
[51:24] maybe even the one selling it to her
[51:26] didn't really want to sell it to her but
[51:28] i got the money so she i'll go ahead and
[51:29] give you that and that you know and then
[51:32] when she came and she anointed him with
[51:34] that oil and so forth
[51:36] the disciples said couldn't this have
[51:38] been sold for a great price and we could
[51:41] have given it to the poor and he said
[51:43] she did it for my burial
[51:45] the very anointing that was going to
[51:47] bury him and so forth amen
[51:49] you come from that type of money you say
[51:51] well that's some dirty money let me tell
[51:54] you something ain't dirty when god's
[51:55] cleaning it
[51:57] because that woman was doing it in
[51:58] repentance isn't that right she was
[52:01] repenting and she was asking for
[52:03] forgiveness when god cleanses something
[52:06] it is clean amen
[52:08] even his burying god himself
[52:12] amen
[52:14] it's like a little heart for us humans
[52:15] our self-righteousness i understand but
[52:17] i want you to know the blood of jesus
[52:19] christ has the power to clean the vilest
[52:23] sinner
[52:27] amen
[52:28] a vile sinner
[52:36] amen
[52:37] let's uh i got two stories here i want
[52:39] to read
[52:42] the one is about lady macabee y'all
[52:45] remember the story
[52:48] brother baby says here a few
[52:49] years ago all religions of the world met
[52:52] and i believe it was in london england
[52:54] he says and when there was all speaking
[52:55] of different churches and mohammedans
[52:57] and buddhists and everything a little
[52:59] old fellow that represented christianity
[53:00] american holiness church john witt i
[53:03] believe was his name so then when he got
[53:05] up to his time to speak all the
[53:07] religions represented in this great
[53:08] gathering he told the story of lady
[53:11] maccabee how low she was
[53:13] got arrested in the oklahoma smoking a
[53:15] cigar and driving and passed the speed
[53:18] that she's supposed to with all of the
[53:19] horses and so forth amen with the
[53:21] stagecoach she done so many murders and
[53:23] filthy and ornery
[53:26] until they went to tar and feather her
[53:27] they wouldn't even put their hands on
[53:29] her afraid they'd be polluted
[53:33] real low down woman
[53:37] and he got and he told the story in such
[53:39] a dramatic way till it got every
[53:41] listener on the ends of their seats he's
[53:43] a gentleman of the and the religions of
[53:45] this world
[53:47] has your religion got anything that
[53:49] would clean the hands of lady maccabee
[53:52] nobody said the word
[53:54] he jumped up in the air and he kicked
[53:56] his heels together slapped his hands
[53:57] again the blood of jesus christ won't
[54:00] only clean her hands but it'll clean her
[54:03] heart
[54:05] amen
[54:07] no matter how vile how dirty
[54:11] it can clean
[54:12] listen
[54:13] he says again the blood of jesus christ
[54:15] will take the lowest prostitute in
[54:17] louisville kentucky and make a lady a
[54:19] saint out of her it'll take a bootlegger
[54:22] out there and a place down yonder and
[54:23] make a gentleman out of him and a saint

[55:29] buddy of mine

[55:32] life insurance

[56:27] let me tell you something the blood of
[56:29] jesus christ will wash you white it'll
[56:30] clean you and it'll take the desire for
[56:33] sin away
[56:36] i hope everybody listen everybody
[56:38] listening here tonight
[56:40] and out there
[56:43] if your faith in god hasn't taken you so
[56:46] deep
[56:47] and you haven't got filled with the holy
[56:49] ghost so much until that desire has left
[56:52] you're not deep enough yet
[56:55] amen
[56:57] was thinking this week how david said i
[56:59] keep the lord always before us how many
[57:02] believes and we talked on what was we
[57:04] talked about on sunday on on priorities
[57:07] if we keep christ in front of you all
[57:09] the time there's no temptation can come
[57:12] to you there's nothing the devil can put
[57:14] in front of you
[57:16] until it faces him first
[57:18] because he's in front of you
[57:20] amen it has to come through him
[57:23] amen lord help us
[57:25] so remember that
[57:26] take the desire
[57:28] of it away make
[57:31] sin has to look ugly to you not pretty
[57:34] not sexy
[57:36] not tempting no
[57:38] ugly and terrible then you are where you
[57:40] should be
[57:42] because uh under the new covenant it
[57:44] takes the desire of sin away
[57:47] all right where was why
[57:52] oh
[57:55] so that's right he says i got assurance
[57:57] he says what insurance do you have
[57:58] blessed insurance jesus is mine
[58:00] he said that's really nice brother
[58:02] really i appreciate that said but
[58:05] he says i got a brother preacher you
[58:06] know to all brother howard and i says
[58:08] yes and he said billy but that won't put
[58:11] you in the graveyard
[58:14] amen
[58:16] there's a lot of people worried about
[58:17] making sure that they have enough funds
[58:19] to get buried
[58:21] right maybe have a little insurance
[58:23] policy to get buried
[58:27] but he says yeah i know
[58:30] but it will get me out
[58:34] how many is that that how many that's a
[58:36] whole lot more important than going in
[58:39] it's a whole lot more important to have
[58:41] the kind of assurance that you're going
[58:43] to come out of there
[58:45] we'll get you buried one way or the
[58:47] other but let's just make sure that
[58:48] you've got the policy that's going to
[58:50] get you out of there
[58:54] are you with me tonight
[58:55] i want the policy that's going to bring
[58:57] me out
[58:58] and you can only have that policy
[59:01] if you're filled with the baptism of the
[59:03] holy spirit
[59:04] your life dedicated to god and when you
[59:07] have been born again
[59:10] oh my i got to thinking about this you
[59:11] know jesus says all that come to me i
[59:13] will in no wise cast out and nobody can
[59:16] pluck them out on my hands how many when
[59:17] you're truly saved you got assurance you
[59:20] don't have to worry about being lost
[59:22] because you know as much as i do the
[59:25] devil likes to play games with our minds
[59:29] whether or not we're going to make it or
[59:32] whether you're good enough
[59:34] huh
[59:37] so many people probably don't go on with
[59:38] god because they don't feel like they're
[59:39] worthy i was thinking you know god has
[59:42] taken us who were nothing but a worm
[59:45] taking us up out of that dirt that deep
[59:47] mirey clay that we were wiggling around
[59:49] in and he's made us sons and daughters
[59:52] of god
[59:54] higher than the angels
[59:58] you know you're higher in higher
[59:59] authority angels because angels are
[1:00:02] servants
[1:00:03] servants serve the son
[1:00:06] sons and daughters that's higher than
[1:00:07] servants
[1:00:09] he's taken us from worms
[1:00:11] to sons and daughters of god just like
[1:00:13] he could have i don't know that he ever
[1:00:14] did take this lady maccabee but i'll
[1:00:17] tell you he can take the most violent
[1:00:19] sinner
[1:00:20] you know who would one of the most
[1:00:22] violent sinner was was paul
[1:00:26] paul was a real vile sinner
[1:00:32] he condoned to the murderer
[1:00:34] of stephen
[1:00:37] folks the christians were scared perhaps
[1:00:39] of a
[1:00:40] pilot
[1:00:41] uh uh
[1:00:43] caesar or some of them
[1:00:45] they were a little worried about but not
[1:00:46] as much as they were about paul
[1:00:48] because paul was actively throwing them
[1:00:51] in prison and coming after them in other
[1:00:53] words he says i'm coming after you gods
[1:00:56] i'm gonna throw you in jail y'all are a
[1:00:58] bunch of heretics
[1:00:59] because that's what he thought the
[1:01:00] christians were persecuting the church
[1:01:02] of god and going and taking the coats
[1:01:05] and and keeping track of the coats as
[1:01:07] they going stone stephen he was part of
[1:01:09] it he was guilty of it
[1:01:11] amen
[1:01:13] next to blasphemy
[1:01:15] until paul says
[1:01:18] god came into this world to save sinners
[1:01:21] how many believe that
[1:01:23] of whom i am
[1:01:26] chief
[1:01:27] he says how much i'm the chief center
[1:01:31] i was so
[1:01:32] i was so
[1:01:33] zealous in what i was doing but it was
[1:01:35] absolutely the wrong thing i was
[1:01:38] persecuting the very weight it was
[1:01:40] righteous and so forth
[1:01:42] how many knows the first church a lot of
[1:01:44] folks didn't believe it nah not paul
[1:01:47] you mean god is called paul
[1:01:50] i mean he took his arch enemy
[1:01:53] god can take his arch enemy
[1:01:56] and turn him around
[1:01:58] and make him serve him that's what he
[1:02:00] did to fall
[1:02:01] he can forgive all of that
[1:02:03] a lot of those church folks probably
[1:02:05] didn't one i never gave him
[1:02:07] they were scared of him but
[1:02:09] it took the confirmation of the prophets
[1:02:11] different ones
[1:02:12] no paul really is on our side now
[1:02:16] he is really not going to kill you or
[1:02:19] or throw you in jail
[1:02:21] paul said he was the chief of sinners
[1:02:24] amen
[1:02:30] let's go to another scene
[1:02:32] brother banham
[1:02:35] was up in ohio having services
[1:02:38] isn't that right
[1:02:40] and he did like
[1:02:43] he was hungry and the main restaurant
[1:02:46] was closed in between services somewhere
[1:02:48] and he went over there to this little
[1:02:49] shocky place and he didn't realize from
[1:02:51] what i could tell
[1:02:53] it pretty much describes the bar that i
[1:02:55] used to go to
[1:02:57] all right he come in there and they were
[1:02:58] playing the jukeboxes
[1:03:01] there all drinking beer and everything
[1:03:03] else and he rises this is a terrible
[1:03:05] place isn't that right
[1:03:08] he see the policeman over there playing
[1:03:10] slot machines and he says it's illegal
[1:03:12] to have slot machines and gamble in ohio
[1:03:14] hit that cop was breaking the law
[1:03:18] amen ill had his arm around some young
[1:03:21] girl as ill
[1:03:22] badly dressed and everything else and
[1:03:24] all kinds of bad stuff going on in there
[1:03:27] and there was some old woman that was in
[1:03:30] a in a a in a
[1:03:33] seat from what i understand with some
[1:03:35] men there and had all kinds of
[1:03:38] crazy looking hair and and eye shadow or
[1:03:41] whatever just looked terrible
[1:03:44] arms just you know when you get old i'm
[1:03:46] sorry but it just don't stay tight it
[1:03:48] gets all flabby
[1:03:49] right and she had flabby arms just
[1:03:52] uglier than sinned pretty much and and
[1:03:54] they're flirting trying to pick up guys
[1:03:58] you know and boy he just didn't think
[1:03:59] about a whole lot of it
[1:04:01] he was standing there criticizing and
[1:04:03] thinking god why don't you just how can
[1:04:05] you stand this
[1:04:07] right how can you stand this why don't
[1:04:09] you just wipe this off the face of the
[1:04:11] earth
[1:04:13] and something said to me come on over
[1:04:15] here to one side i want to talk to you
[1:04:18] he says that was my boss
[1:04:22] and when i went over there it just
[1:04:24] seemed like it come before me and like a
[1:04:26] vision and i've seen this and he says
[1:04:28] seems like i could see the world and
[1:04:29] around the world was a rainbow
[1:04:32] and that rainbow represented the blood
[1:04:34] of jesus christ
[1:04:36] that right
[1:04:37] and if that blood would not listen
[1:04:39] closely if that blood would ever leave
[1:04:42] there god couldn't look at this world
[1:04:45] another second
[1:04:49] why do you think homosexuality why do
[1:04:51] you think
[1:04:52] all of that terrible things that's going
[1:04:54] on the mass murdering just yesterday
[1:04:57] again
[1:04:58] all of the terrible the our politicians
[1:05:02] huh
[1:05:03] it's hard to believe it isn't it but our
[1:05:05] wickedness of our politicians that's
[1:05:07] right because most of them are wicked
[1:05:09] that's right
[1:05:10] uh and then they go to church and you
[1:05:12] know and they think they're okay with
[1:05:14] god why are they gonna have a surprise
[1:05:17] killing babies is okay you reckon that's
[1:05:19] gonna be all right on that day no it's
[1:05:21] not
[1:05:22] huh
[1:05:23] all kinds of the whole world is in the
[1:05:25] sodom condition
[1:05:27] if that blood of christ would ever leave
[1:05:32] god would look on it he would see it
[1:05:34] it would be in his presence do you think
[1:05:36] god's going to live with all that
[1:05:38] he would destroy it
[1:05:40] annihilate it immediately
[1:05:46] but that's why we're still here that's
[1:05:49] why he hasn't destroyed it yet
[1:05:51] because that blood is there because how
[1:05:53] many knows he died for the sins of the
[1:05:55] whole world
[1:05:57] that's what he died for that's the power
[1:05:59] of his blood all the way from cain all
[1:06:01] the way to the last one no matter how
[1:06:03] bad it is outside of what god says as
[1:06:05] far as blasphemy and so forth it's
[1:06:08] powerful enough to wash it all away
[1:06:12] amen and as long as it's there
[1:06:15] we're covered
[1:06:16] we have like a bumper brother ram said
[1:06:18] isn't that right
[1:06:26] he destroyed the blood of jesus christ
[1:06:29] is the only thing that keeps the wrath
[1:06:30] of off of us tonight
[1:06:32] amen that's the truth if it wasn't for
[1:06:35] there for that there would be no more
[1:06:36] world in five minutes time from now god
[1:06:39] cannot look in the face of sin
[1:06:41] and the reason he can't see the world is
[1:06:43] because of the blood of jesus christ
[1:06:44] holding that's in all
[1:06:47] and if god could look in on a scene such
[1:06:49] as that
[1:06:51] it'll be finished he's too holy for that
[1:06:54] and then
[1:06:55] here's what come to me i thought
[1:06:57] to see the blood of jesus i acted as a
[1:07:00] bumper on a car
[1:07:01] he says every he saw his sins coming up
[1:07:03] there and every time his sins had come
[1:07:05] up there it bumped
[1:07:07] and jesus go crying and just weeping and
[1:07:09] bleeding and you know it's the blood of
[1:07:11] jesus christ
[1:07:12] all of his suffering was for your sins
[1:07:15] and for my sins
[1:07:17] and i thought that's the blood of jesus
[1:07:18] it's like a bumper and i thought oh my
[1:07:20] here i go to criticizing that woman
[1:07:24] i may not have did that but may have uh
[1:07:26] not have acted like that policeman was
[1:07:28] acting but yet in the sight of god i was
[1:07:30] a sinner just as bad as they was
[1:07:33] nami knows that he's seen all of his
[1:07:35] sins now let me just let me just read it
[1:07:36] the woman's sitting there sin is sin
[1:07:38] that's all doesn't matter
[1:07:40] no matter what your morals are you're a
[1:07:42] sinner you're just a sinner and so i
[1:07:43] thought god yes
[1:07:45] and god would have destroyed me if it
[1:07:47] hadn't been for the blood of jesus
[1:07:48] christ
[1:07:49] keeping my sins from his presence
[1:07:52] then something said to me he said yes i
[1:07:55] forgive you but you wanted to get that
[1:07:57] murder
[1:07:59] i seen my sins
[1:08:00] and the one day i crawled up to him i
[1:08:02] seen an old book laying there had
[1:08:04] william branham at the top of all kinds
[1:08:06] of things wrote on it and i said oh lord
[1:08:08] i'm so sorry i've caused it
[1:08:10] amen and i've seen the sweat
[1:08:12] coming down off of his face and so forth
[1:08:14] you know what he realized that his sins
[1:08:16] is the ones that had put him there and
[1:08:18] then he says here you are i forgave you
[1:08:20] but you want to condemn them
[1:08:22] so i just thought man look at the
[1:08:24] atmosphere of that bar look at the
[1:08:26] terrible atmosphere in there
[1:08:29] you wouldn't think that god would just
[1:08:31] let that oak go by
[1:08:34] huh
[1:08:35] i'll say go by because he knew there was
[1:08:37] a woman in there
[1:08:38] that was his child
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:43] and so even that if you think about it
[1:08:46] god's power is enough
[1:08:48] it means uh to take and to be patient
[1:08:51] with human beings you and i we don't
[1:08:53] tend to be real patient with each other
[1:08:55] you let somebody do one little thing
[1:08:57] about we're ready to condemn them all
[1:08:58] all up and down
[1:09:01] isn't that the truth we have to be
[1:09:03] careful in that
[1:09:05] because we make mistakes we have faults
[1:09:07] all the time that if it wasn't for that
[1:09:10] blood covering us
[1:09:11] we'd be in a lot of trouble
[1:09:13] i'm just glad for a forgiving god that
[1:09:16] forgives you of your sins you repent to
[1:09:18] god cover it by the blood it goes into
[1:09:20] the sea of his forgetfulness never to be
[1:09:21] remembered no more
[1:09:24] so if god can be merciful to people like
[1:09:26] that i believe he can be a merciful to
[1:09:28] anybody
[1:09:29] if they'll just accept what he did
[1:09:32] but he had the wrong he had the wrong
[1:09:34] attitude didn't he the attitude that you
[1:09:37] know he was holy and this is so unholy
[1:09:39] that
[1:09:40] oh my
[1:09:41] brother says that
[1:09:43] changed my attitude
[1:09:45] and then what did he do he went over
[1:09:47] there to that woman
[1:09:49] said hello to her
[1:09:51] how do you do ma'am
[1:09:54] can i sit down or whatever he says oh
[1:09:55] i'm already with somebody you know what
[1:09:57] she said
[1:09:58] yeah well i don't mean it in that way
[1:10:00] brother brown says but just now i was
[1:10:02] condemning a lot of people in here and
[1:10:05] and the way that everybody's doing
[1:10:07] and this is what the lord showed me
[1:10:09] that says are you brother banham she
[1:10:11] said are you here having the meetings
[1:10:13] and she began to cry and how that she
[1:10:16] used to be with the lord and all that
[1:10:17] had happened brother man says god will
[1:10:19] take you back
[1:10:20] they had a big old-fashioned prayer
[1:10:22] meeting right there in the barn he led
[1:10:24] her to the lord i believe you're not
[1:10:26] going to get to see her don't you
[1:10:28] i believe it
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:32] over the blood of jesus christ the power
[1:10:35] that it has
[1:10:36] the forgiving power of
[1:10:38] whatever it might be amen aren't you
[1:10:41] glad for his grace
[1:10:42] for his mercy
[1:10:44] amen i certainly am
[1:10:47] thankful for it
[1:10:49] and for the heaven the assurance in your
[1:10:51] heart
[1:10:52] blessed assurance
[1:10:54] that when you do trip then when you
[1:10:56] wreck when you fail
[1:11:00] that you can go before the blood of
[1:11:01] jesus christ and say god forgive me
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:05] because you're covered god will cover
[1:11:06] that i mean god is here to cover your
[1:11:08] mistakes
[1:11:10] our false
[1:11:12] all little little faults that we have
[1:11:13] he's there it's covered by the blood
[1:11:16] brother brown says as long as you're
[1:11:18] repenting when you do things he says
[1:11:20] you're you're perfect in the sight of
[1:11:22] god
[1:11:23] why because it's going right under the
[1:11:24] blood amen
[1:11:26] amen i'm thankful for his grace thank
[1:11:28] you for his mercy don't ever let the
[1:11:31] devil tell you you're not worthy sir if
[1:11:33] you look at yourself we aren't worthy
[1:11:35] we're nothing but worm but we're not
[1:11:36] looking at that we're looking at the
[1:11:37] blood of jesus christ he is worthy
[1:11:40] and he has made you worthy
[1:11:43] amen he has raised you up from a life of
[1:11:46] sin
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:48] in that bar or whatever it might be or
[1:11:51] or like paul persecuting or saul that
[1:11:53] was way out of line or david and all of
[1:11:56] that god will raise you up out of that
[1:11:57] and forgive you amen pick you up make
[1:12:00] you a son and daughter of god
[1:12:02] to serve him
[1:12:03] every day of your life
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:07] i love it because
[1:12:08] nowadays when you have those sins go
[1:12:10] before him and we know that justified
[1:12:12] means so as though you never did it in
[1:12:15] the first place
[1:12:16] it goes in the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:12:20] what if god remembered your failures
[1:12:22] here in the last week or two maybe
[1:12:24] yesterday maybe today
[1:12:26] if he would remember him
[1:12:28] then he'd still be accountable
[1:12:30] but when he forgives you they go into
[1:12:32] the sea of forgetfulness like brother
[1:12:34] baptist says a little ink amen i believe
[1:12:36] it was it's this in isaiah 1 it says
[1:12:39] come let us reason together though your
[1:12:41] sins be a scarlet they shall be as white
[1:12:43] as no they be crimson red like crimson
[1:12:46] amen or like your brother says you have
[1:12:48] a big old stain on your shirt you
[1:12:50] usually take oil and stuff from gas or
[1:12:52] something try to get out of it and just
[1:12:54] made it bigger
[1:12:55] but with the clorox bleach it says it
[1:12:57] sends it right back to its original form
[1:13:00] and that's what the blood of jesus
[1:13:01] christ does and it goes right back to
[1:13:03] where he comes from and he can't never
[1:13:05] see it no more
[1:13:07] drop a drop of ink into a cup of bleach
[1:13:10] and it'll go away and you'll never see
[1:13:12] it again i seen the brother one time
[1:13:14] illustrating what bleach will do and and
[1:13:17] he would pour a little coke or pepsi in
[1:13:18] it and kill pour coke and pepsi in this
[1:13:20] and it hardly ever you could never tell
[1:13:22] that he's changed color
[1:13:24] you just go take it take take it right
[1:13:26] out
[1:13:27] amen god come up with the bleach that
[1:13:29] takes the
[1:13:30] stain sin has left a crimson stain on us
[1:13:34] didn't it
[1:13:35] he washed it

[1:13:51] he can make the vilest sinner
[1:13:54] vile a sinner

[1:14:00] you it's the devil's business to get in
[1:14:01] our minds and think you can't be
