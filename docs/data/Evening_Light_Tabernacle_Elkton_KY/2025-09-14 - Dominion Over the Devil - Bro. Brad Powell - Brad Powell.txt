TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You've got dominion over that flesh. And he says you've got dominion and over the devil. &gt;&gt; So you've got dominion over You don't have to fall for his lies anymore. You don't have to listen to him and his tricks. You don't have to listen to him and his folly when he tells you you're not good enough. You can't make it. You're not bride. Those are lies and tricks of the devil. And you have been given domain, dominion. over his lies, over his tricks, when he says you're not going to make it, when he says you're going to fail. Get thee behind me, Satan. Do you see where the word comes into play? We've been shown all the tricks of the trade. Our father was a craftsman. He was a carpenter. He knew all the tricks of the trade. And he laid it out word for word for word in the Bible so that we would have the the ability to have the dominion over what Satan throws at us. Yes indeed, even now we are seated in heavenly places. He says he's showing forth his praise and glory, showing forth himself for it is Christ in us. And as long as we keep that at the forefront that it's Christ in us, it's not us manufacturing. It's not us doing. It's not because we study. It's not because we we do this or that. It's because we were predestined before the foundation of the world for a purpose. Let's read in Genesis 3:14 and 15. I want you to notice here God setting some things in order. We know the scene. We know the scenario. We know what's happened in the garden here. And so now God's coming down to set some things in order and take back, should we say, what the enemy stole. He went to the enemy's camp and he took back what he stole from him. Some of us need to get in our minds that we're going to go down to the enemy's camp today and we're going to take back what he's stolen from us. So if you're sitting here depressed, take it back. If you're sitting here full of anxiety and fear and doubt, go down to the enemy's camp and take it back because the order has been placed. [Music]
