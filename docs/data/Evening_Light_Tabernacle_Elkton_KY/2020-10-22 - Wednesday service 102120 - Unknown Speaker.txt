each one father and for the spiritual health lord you've bestowed upon us through your word and what you've supplied for us to be able to eat on this in this hour we just desire now lord you'd help me just to get out of the way and that you just used your vessel father to speak the things that you once said tonight lord we do count it and deem it grand privilege lord to be able to assemble ourselves together to read your eternal word knowing god that it never changes father we just ask your blessing upon it bless the reading of it meditation of our heart that which you've laid them on our heart to speak we ask god that you just lord say what you once said tonight lord and let your presence be felt among the people for we ask it in jesus name amen and amen amen amen turn your bibles if you will to all the way towards the back of the book first epistle of john chapter one and we'll read verse 6 and 7. if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen so i want to talk about and i want to title this rapturing fellowship rapturing fellowship amen we've heard of rapturing faith right so i want to just title this rapturing fellowship and i'm going to try to re-read this just a little bit if i could verse 7 if we walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of jesus christ clean his son cleanses us from all sin then back up about two lines then we have fellowship one with another amen is that all right amen god bless you you can be seated tonight amen that's right because how many knows that if we are under the blood then we have fellowship one with another amen so tonight for a little while we want to speak on something i've spoken probably many times before but perhaps just maybe see it from a little bit different light or a little different view amen so fellowship let's just think about the word fellowship for a minute amen there's god created each and every one of us to want to have fellowship you know right i don't know anybody no human being that i know of likes to be alone and not fellowship or talk to somebody sometime now we've heard y'all have heard of hermits right some people like to be a hermit they like to go out in the woods somewhere and most of the time if you ever know anything about a hermit they don't like people to come around right they've had some really bad experiences with people and so they they don't want you to trespass on their property they don't want you to come and you know their hermit they're hermit for a reason most likely it's because that they have had a bad experience with people so they just like to be by their self they want to be by their self and for the most part i just want to say that they probably hate most people they just don't like people why else would you not want to be around anybody else unless you really didn't like them but for the most part most of us normal people like to talk to each other like they have fellowship and that right and a lot of times you find the people in the country right how many knows are the people on the farm and so and it used to be more so back in the olden days when perhaps a farmer wouldn't see nobody for a week or whatever so whenever somebody would come they'd be super friendly and they'd be very outgoing and they'd talk to you and so forth right because they wanted to talk to somebody you know but city folks we don't even wave each other anymore why we're so used to each other we got so many people that we know already but let me take this a little bit different first of all i want to say that fellowship is one of the oldest things in the universe all right it's one of the oldest should we say desires that come from god in the universe in the world amen we know through the message of the hour uh brother bannon says it this way he says god in the beginning being infinite he says he knowed all things from the beginning all right and the only thing that these things are is the display of his attributes all right so everything that we're seeing around us is a display of god's attributes all right so he's let's listen you have you have an attribute in it's your thought your thought is your attribute you think of something and then you speak it and then you take it so forth and that's god in the beginning and he says if you ever was or ever will be in heaven you was in heaven to start with amen so we go back and you're a part of god you were his thought he knew your name and he knew who you were before there was a molecule before there was a light before there was anything amen and then listen so he says he knew your name and then you became the word and the word is this thought expressed and you were manifest now next quote who do you say this is phoenix arizona 1964. that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself i mean though that god was by himself before there was any molecule before there was the first stardust before the first light before the first moon before earth was ever created god dwelled alone now this is where this is the area where you can't figure god out all right there's certain thoughts that you can't entertain because it'll blow your mind how many of those gobbled flaps will blooply blow your natural mind i mean you think about how long god was before he ever created anything you make questions you know you ask yourselves questions there's no answers for it because you just ask yourself a question that is that that's not even answerable but you say how long it was never never was the length of time he was always he was eternal it's not like 10 000 years or whatever he was he always was all right so then he began to think well god was always was and you know how could he be because we're such creatures of time and element and everything has a beginning with us but god never did and how great was and i'll tell you what you know and just to think of how great god is to be able to create everything that was created me and my wife the other day we finally got outside in the dark and you know it was out in the country and boy i'll tell you what and i guess was it last night isn't here uh last night or is it tonight i think it was last night it was supposed to be the meteor showers and so forth it's supposed to be really heavy and while we were out there a few nights ago and i see a few of them going across there and you look at the galaxy look at the stars and how great god really is and how powerful he really is to be able to make all this stuff just thinking about god ought to do something to us you know it just you know it ought to make like the scripture says i stand in all of you it's like wow really i i can't even fathom it my mind isn't great enough to comprehend how great how powerful god really is amen and they're so it's just infationable and some people cannot accept god because they can't fathom him they can't bring god into their mind and and project him as well he started here he started there he's this that or the other no he never was and there's no way that you can ever fathom how great god is in your mind you can't never do it our human mind isn't able to conceive that amen that's what different places brother bam he says you know you can't figure out don't try to do it amen you weren't meant to figure god out you were meant to believe god that's what we are we're meant to accept god but there we look at this and go way back before the beginning before the first molecule notice he says before the first molecule was ever made god had you in his mind he had you any thoughts and he fellowship with his thoughts well you see that's weird brother bob no it's not so weird didn't you ever see a person talking to themselves what are they doing hey some people laugh some people will you know just talk and talk back to this house right you know they're having a good time fellowshipping with their mind and their thoughts is that what it is now you might not do it wait till you get my age you find yourself in the backside of the barn laughing about something all by yourself but that's how god was god was there all by himself and can you imagine there he had all these thoughts in his mind and he said oh oh he could have just had a good old-fashioned time just fellowshipping with his thoughts with his thinking and what he's going to do and how he's going to create things and the sons of god you know whenever job was down into despair or he was in the in the ash sheep and so forth you know god says where was you job when the sons of god shouted for joy where was you i bet you were in my mind [Applause] shouting for joy that's where you was think about that when you're down in the ashy amen when you go through our thing just realize that i knew you'd go through this before i created the first doll [Applause] i knew your name jeff young i knew your name before a hunger and created the first molecule let me tell you if you're christians born again saved by the holy ghost and you believe that you are a part of god you ought to be the happiest person on the world to think that you are a part of god you and if you ever gonna be in heaven if you were ever gonna be there you was there at the beginning and the fact that you now have fellowship with god shows you that when the rapture does come he's not gonna leave you no forsake you that don't make you happy go grab you a budweiser huh huh how many believes you ought to do something for us amen a budweiser on a dope and an that don't make us happy when you read the word of god it makes us happy praise be to god but he was there he was all by himself he was lonely because he was all by himself for all that time and god wanted fellowship amen you might say oh i want more fellow how many wants more fellowship with god well you just remember that this that god wants more fellowship with you than what you do with him he's more anxious to have fellowship with you than what you are with him this is what we speak about what we're going to talk tonight about you know talking about amen this is this is something that has to be top priority in our life if we expect to be in the rapture we have to have the kind of fellowship that's going to take us out of here if you don't have the right fellowship with god you're not leaving this place amen enoch walked with god he had fellowship with god and before he left he had this testimony that he pleased god that was his testimony he had such a walk such a fellowship with almighty god until he didn't do anything but what pleased god jesus said the same thing i do nothing amen but my father shows me first and i always do that which pleases the father listen everybody are you doing always that which pleases the father good question because if you're not because i'm healthy to tell you i wonder what god's gonna have to do to shake us up to get us ready for that rapture huh oh it's gonna be interesting there hey amen can i say it you ain't seen nothing yet you wait because i know there's one thing sister john easton that is that god is going to have his people ready and he's already got it laid out exactly what it's going to take to have you ready i don't know just what it is the prophet of god one place he says it'll be that persecution that drives them together perhaps it's that persecution that will drive us together and that'll bring us right into a rapture condition so let's go back so we're thinking about that there god was all by himself he was lonely and he wanted fellowship how do you know he wanted fellowship well it's quite evident his works manifest that he wanted fellowship and that he didn't want to be alone you know right that's why he created us that's why he created angels and then he created us i mean those angels that are there 24 7 their wings are just gone just a flop in the air never stop day and night saying holy holy holy is the lord holy holy holy is the lord that's all they do day and night the bible says they're created to do that amen but god wants something more than just angels to worship him he wants something more he wants sons and daughters amen let me go now let's just talk about the natural side of fellowship for a minute the natural side of fellowship everyone that is normal normal human being grows up to be about 15 16 17 18 and in those years amen if you as a teenager i'll just kind of perhaps use my testimony maybe not everybody's like me but when i got to be about close to 20 18 19 20 you know i wasn't lonely i had friends i did what i want but there come a time in my life going to church knowing the lord being saved but there's something in my heart that just said you know i don't want to be alone i don't want to live my life by myself i was renting a little room from a little old man of the night lady her upstairs room she rented it out for me that's where i lived for quite a while even as a christian now i just read that for about 100 a month you wouldn't do that nowadays anymore would you and so but you know i it was got to the place to where you know i was ready for a mate i was ready for a companionship i mean sometimes it helps they have parents sometimes it helps their friends sometimes it helps to be busy with this data that most times amen young people will get to the place to where they're lonely and they want companionship amen let me preach to the young people a little bit sure that's why austin serenity's sitting back there amen didn't want to be alone there was something called you begin to pray lord is everyone out there for me is there a companion out there for me amen and you know god granted me that desire of my heart amen and give me donna and that satisfied that hey i was happy it was awesome it's wonderful you know but think about this that let's say you don't know god you don't have christ yeah that'll satisfy that it'll take care of that natural part but after you've been married and that person becomes kind of common to you there's going to be another loneliness that sets in hello and that is a loneliness of your soul your soul is lonely it wasn't meant to be alone your soul wasn't meant to be empty your life wasn't meant to be empty as much as perhaps a make and satisfy and feel that loneliness and bring you fellowship that never will take the place of the holy ghost amen i thank god that he had already filled that place but you know after a while we were married about two years and i began to think and talk to my wife we said you know wouldn't it be nice to have a child wouldn't it be nice we got perhaps lonely we wanted fellowship with our offspring huh you don't think about all the nights you don't think about the puke they're gonna throw up on you everywhere you don't think about all the dirty diapers you don't think about the fevers you don't think about all the struggles you don't think about all the school you got to take them to and all these activities and oh boy i'll tell you what after you have children the time begins to fly by fast well because your whole rap life is wrapped up now in your family in the job and guess what you don't have time to be lonely you ain't got time at all hardly time that's why those 20s and 30s snap by really quick and that right because why you feel fulfillment especially as a christian you have the lord jesus christ to satisfy your soul amen you have these other things that god meant for you to have amen and then all of a sudden here comes your child you know and for me it wasn't a girl but it was a couple of boys and then when they were first born what is the first thing we look is does he have my hand does he have my feet does he look like me or does he look like her or whatever is that right he began to look for a resemblance because guess what amen that is a part of you and that's the way it is with god he was by himself but he was looking for more than just the angels more than just servants but he was the desire to have a son he wanted sons and daughters like himself how many believes that god is looking for his children to be like him to act like him oh my and i want to take you to the scripture that day the bible says you're gonna know that i am in my father my father is in me i am and you and you are in me i want you to know that come a time when you'll realize that we have fellowship one with another god is desiring fellowship a fellowship that you can walk out of this world with fellowship that you can walk in this world with and be in this world with amen we look on down and we find out that the first two thousand years and the days of noah isn't that right amen that there was a man by the name of enoch isn't that right his name was enoch amen in the bible says he was not for god took him and laid it over in hebrews i believe it is it says you know that through enoch kept this testimony that before he was taken he had this testimony that he pleased god how many knows whenever you love the lord jesus christ you look and there's every way possible you look how that you can please him just as a husband looks to please his wife a wife looks to please her husband if they really love each other and have fellowship they'll do about anything for each other if you've got a friend that's really a friend you'll do about anything for your friend because you have fellowship person that you're close to amen fellowship praise the lord so you think about that you are now a son and daughter of god and if you're a christian let me just put this out before you god is looking for fellowship that we can walk out of this world with what kind of fellowship do you have with him now is your fellowship with god where it should be huh amen brother is your fellowship with god where you want it to be no it's not part of the reason i'm preaching this i'm preaching this at myself no it's not i believe i need a deeper fellowship with god i need a deeper walk with god [Music] i don't believe there's anybody in here to be honest wouldn't say i need a deeper walk with god we'll need a deeper walk with god the kind of walk that is totally and completely pleasing to him people say well i love the lord i got fellowship with him but if you walk in darkness then you're a liar huh and do not the truth the fellowship chapter which is in saint john 14 if you will go with me saint john 14. this is the fellowship that i desire to have and i trust each and every one of us is 14th chapter of saint john we'll begin with verse 8. philip saith unto him have i been so long no wait a minute philip says unto him lord show us the father and it'll satisfy us jesus said unto him have i been so long a time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me has seen the father and how saith thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwell up in me he doeth the works hallelujah how many wants that kind of a walk with god amen that when people say well i would like to see what the holy ghost does amen you can say i'll tell you what the words that i'm saying to you they're spoken by the holy ghost and the works that i do they're done by the holy ghost just watch me if you want to see the holy ghost let me say it again just watch me if you want to see the holy ghost pretty good huh you want to see what the holy ghost does what it's me believe me that i am in the father and the father is in me or else believe me for the very works sake amen verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than they shall he do because i go unto the father and whatsoever he shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son and if you ask anything in my name i will do it i mean knows somebody has real fellowship with somebody you'll do whatever you can for that person if you've got real fellowship god will do whatever he can for you amen whatever you ask i'll give it to you how about joshua huh joshua i i i may forgive me of down little carnal hill here but joshua couldn't have barely known what he was saying if he didn't took a thought about what he was saying he probably wouldn't have said it you think a man just carnally thinking would tell the sun to stand still and the moon all still no somebody would have to be under under inspiration said son stand still and move would you hold your place in the valley of agdalone or whatever it was you stay at your place and god stopped the universe for a man how many wants to be a closer walk with god you talk about a close walk with god and god honored his honor his word when he said those things because he what spoke under the inspiration man speaking under the inspiration the bible says that all scripture is given by inspiration it's not man's word to begin with amen lord help us to be able to say that the words that i speak of to you they're not my words they're his words may that be every day of our life the things that we say it's the holy ghost speaking children talking to your parents parents talking to your children amen boss is talking to your work every time it's hey this is the holy ghost talking this is how the holy ghost would do it if it ain't then we're not pleasing the god pastor let's put me in this the way you talk to your congregation the way you counsel people the way you talk to people not you talking let the holy ghost be amen praise be to god all right let's go on ask anything in my name and i will do it this is where i realize we all need a closer walk with god if you love me you ain't got to do what i say that sound right do whatever you want live however you want that's what the world wants to do no if you love me keep my commandments anybody that wants a close walk with god cares about whether they do what god said or not [Music] amen if you don't you'll be highly disappointed in all yourself verse 18 well let me just read on i'm gonna pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you when the convenient time is convenient on sunday morning or wednesday night no forever that he may dwell with you and he shall be with you and in you amen i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you amen yet a little while and the world shall be no more but ye see me and because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father you are in me and i am in you i mean believe that this is truly the uh the revelation of the thoughts of god being expressed through the prophet of god telling us that we were in his mind any thinking before the world ever was at this day you're gonna know that you have been a part of me from the start and i was a part of you from the start at that day amen and ye in me and i in you heeded hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that love with me all else are liars and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and i will manifest myself to him amen verse 23 jesus answered us and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him i wrote down here let me see what it was if i can even find it we are not sufficiently impressed with the scripture of how that he is in us the father is in him he is in the father we are in him and he is in us how many are so thankful to have the holy spirit in your heart the greatest treasure you have is to have god in your heart to have the comfort of the holy spirit in your hearts the greatest thing on earth nothing greater to have him to make his abode with you he that loveth me not uh keepeth not my sayings amen you don't have the fellowship with god if you don't keep his sayings don't lie to yourself don't kid yourself you don't obey what god said do you ain't got fellowship with him amen how can two walk together unless there be a grade somebody answer me that question if you can't i'm gonna leave it open for a second how will let me rephrase it how will two people to walk together when they're not agreed they'll walk together in argument in disagreement and in this fellowship that's how they'll walk together if they're not agreed you have to be agreed to have fellowship you have to be think the same isn't that right whenever you don't agree with somebody while you disagree and most of the time that's argue and then we all know that too well right amen all right so he keep it not my saying he is the one that don't love me and the words which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me amen all right now let's talk about fellowship first just a second here fellowship middletown ohio fellowship comes by love and love requires fellowship love requires fellowship hate creates hermits right but love requires you to have fellowship it just draws you together how many knows that it pulls you together it's a magnet it requires fellowship if you love your wife but you've just got to get with her and to talk with her if you love your friend you got to get with him and talk to him and if you love god huh you got to go worship god you got to praise the lord you got to talk to the lord i can't help but believe that enoch had a real prayer life i believe that he had talked to the lord morning noon and night and probably most of the time in between he had a real fellowship with god he had a prayer life his number one theme in his life was his fellowship with god let me just say this this should be the number one thing for us everything else is secondary or third arie or fourth area there's no aries about that i know but that's just to kind of loosen you up second third or fourth somewhere down the line but our fellowship with god is top of the line that's the most important is our fellowship how many believes that this fountain is inexhaustible because i've preached on fellowship many times but look what the lord can bring just he can open it up even so much more there's no end to the word of god there's no exhausting it there's no drying it up it's not don't get old it stays fresh as long as it's in the presence of god now how many know you take that same man and take it out of the presence of god gets wiggletails and gets stagnated huh but it's got to be in the presence of god amen okay now notice so he says here now you cannot have fellowship god with com without coming to god's agreement everything he said he has to have an agreement marriage has to have an agreement fellowship has to have a basis of of an agreement and there's a basis for the thing of fellowship how many knows what the basis of fellowship is for the christian the basis what you got to have to have fellowship let me just read something over here actually let me just read this that basis is the blood the blood of jesus christ god's not going to make meat with you he's not going to have fellowship with you anywhere else outside of the basis of his blood what does that mean that means that you'll have to come under that blood coming under that blood means that you have to have your sins forgiven am i right he's just not going to come if you're a sinner all right that's the blood the blood only it's been god all the way from the beginning and it will be that way until the end the only place of fellowship is through the blood that's the only place that he will meet with us today people can meet in church they can meet in a baptist a presbyterian a lutheran a a lodge a mason lodge people can fellowship in all these different places you can come to church here hello and still we may not have fellowship i am going to church that's wonderful but there's only one way you and i will have fellowship and that is the blood of jesus christ his cleanses from all sin then we have fellowship one with another no matter how different we are no matter how much we differ [Music] no matter how much we have a quarrel no matter how much we fight no matter how much we fuss if we ever get back together if we ever love one another again if we can never smile and put our arms around again it'll be called be because we come under the blood and we bring those things under the blood otherwise it'll never be fellowship let me just say a few more things god does not have any fellowship with an eight believer there's no fellowship there he's a mate believer he didn't have no fellowship with the pharisees how many knows he didn't have anything in common with the pharisee they were the most religious people of that day but they had nothing in common they certainly didn't have any fellowship they certainly couldn't agree so any make believer any hypocrite cannot fellowship with god if you ain't absolutely honest if you ain't real you have no fellowship with god let me tell you this i truly believe that a real believer doesn't have any fellowship with any of those either there's so far you talk be friendly but as far as having real fellowship where you can just be open and you're just heart heart amen you can't have that unless both of you come under the blood then it's all forgiven god won't meet you the holy ghost won't come to you he won't come and make his abode here unless that thing's been taken care of and you have come under the blood you have no fellowship with god unless your sins are taken under the blood this just comes to mind i think today that great man has swept this nation back and forth jack schuller's billy grahams and many others that run over and over and over and over through the nation and go right back the same year or the next year and find the same group that they preached to just as far deluded in sin than there ever was because man can't save you when men can only make an altar call but it's your individual or personal faith and trust in god to plunge beneath the blood and to be filled with his spirits and and by speak and become a partakers of his divine nature not a partaker of church not an organization but to be able to be partakers of the blood of jesus christ it takes an individual's faith you might find it in a cornfield amen i found it in a little trailer i was renting not in church hello by myself no nobody really influenced me at all except the holy ghost drawing me i give my heart to god as a hippie dude saying god i want to give you my heart i want to give you my life i want to give you everything and god came and he met with me and he led me right straight to the message of the hour how many of these that's where the holy ghost gonna lead you right straight to the message of the hour i think brother perry i've been thinking about brother perish this week and how that most of the times if you're born a pentecostal you're going to stay a pentecostal you don't see people very often come from that on over to what god has now but i see that in him to where he actually come on over come out of that and come right into the message of the hour that's real grace that's god amen but listen to what he was saying brother branham was saying here that you know you can we can take people to the altar but it takes a personal faith of an individual to become part of god and when a believer comes like that i'll pick that up in a minute i don't take you out too long tonight but can i go a little further so we see here amen that it has to be under the blood and the blood only nothing else fellowship god wanted to fellowship with man always wanted to do it the old testament all of it was full of the shed blood without the shedding of the blood there is no remission i called it forgiveness of sins the other night right there in order to remit your sins there has to be a shedding of blood all right and when there's no remission of sins there's no fellowship amen you've got to get away from sin before you can have ever have fellowship with god because god can't have fellowship with sin [Music] now you think about all the denominations you think about everybody that goes content to the word of god everybody that claims the name of jesus christ but they're not under the blood and they don't have their sins remitted huh women with cat hair makeup on earrings on pants on don't let just everything god told them not to do and they say well i love the lord huh you put god fellowshipping with sin you make him sinful and that right god ain't sinful he doesn't partake of sin he doesn't have fellowship with sin that's why sin has to be taken care of how many breeds is evening if you're living in sin you're out of fellowship with god if you haven't got your sin under the blood you're not in fellowship with god [Music] and then if you're not obeying all of his commandments you're out of the fellowship of god you don't have the right kind of fellowship it ain't no wonder god don't answer your prayers [Music] he don't have to answer here he's under no obligation if you abide in me and i abide in you you can ask what you will but otherwise the deal's off amen that's the secret right there abiding in christ praise the lord he don't have fellowship with sin and if he does have fellowship with you and you have come under the blood and you're a believer when the believer comes like that god gives him a checkbook for any redemptive blessing that he died for oh help us i don't know about you but i like to see my prayers get answered the way that the prophet did i'd like to see the son stand still if i call for it i'd like to see amen all these blessings to shower now whatsoever things you will ask in my name i will do it but i'm gonna have to be in the right fellowship with god you're gonna have to be in the right fellowship with god if you're to expect god to answer your prayers i believe if you walk and you are in that kind of fellowship with god cancer won't stand in your way nothing will stand in your way god gives him a check for any redemptive blessing that he died for and jesus name is signed at the bottom my desire is don't even try to get me to do or ask for anything but what the father shows me first [Music] amen then if god the father shows you first he behooves it upon your heart to do it it'll be done right god will grant it to you you won't ask a miss because you want to consume it upon your own lusts you ask and you receive not because you ask it that you may consume it on your own lust the bible says people ask wrong amen oh my praise the lord notice the holy spirit once you get in contact with god and the holy spirit makes christ real in your heart you're not afraid to take god at his word anytime or believe it if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards god let me just close and close saying this i don't know about you but i want the strength of samson i don't want his backsliding but i want us to strength of samp and the strength of joshua the faith of joshua amen i want the walk that jesus had i also want to walk that the prophet of god had in our day why do i want the walk i believe i wrote down here that if we have the walk that the prophet of god had i believe we'll be all right amen he got to the place to where god could so trust him that if he chose to curse a couple up on the front that were practically making love on his bench he could have said i curse you in the name of the lord just like elijah did with the she bears they killed 40 children but no he had the grace of god he says i forgive you for that god's mercy god have mercy on you for that amen because guess what maybe that'll be something that only did that one time and it could have cost them their life i don't know maybe they later on come to the lord i don't know but god help us that we wouldn't want the same judgment upon us when we make a mistake isn't that right i said are they merciful for they shall obtain mercy amen kind of walk with god in closing amen to kind of walk with god that he could speak to you and say storm go pack sunshine for three days amen to control the elements or even where do you want that squirrel at how many squirrels did you want god could trust you so until he would tell you just say it he says well i'll tell you what i want that squirrel to come up on the tree that can never come up go over on the branch and never go up and sit on the place and never want to sit let him come over there let the other one come over here and go over there and sit down let the other one go he got specific to make sure that this was of god right and then squirrels where god created those squirrels they ran right up there exactly like he said and he took for five of his five of them that or so many of them that time and the other one that evening that's how close you walk with god god honored his prayers he never had to worry sometimes he would say now you know what i'm waiting for i'm waiting for the angel of the lord to come if i've told you the truth if he don't come and back it up and prove it you ain't got to believe the word i said huh god already did that he don't have to do it again i believe the word don't you let me ask you this you can answer how many times did he not come how many times did that angel not show up [Music] he always showed up he was always there why because god promised that i'll always be i'll never leave you so i'd always be with her i'll be there he might have to wait a minute or two and there it was just waiting on him but he always show up god backed him up folks these tapes will be played back on judgement day you heard it you heard it on the radio you heard it here and you heard it there you ain't got no excuse that was me in my people amen lord help us that's kind of walk i want stand with me tonight if you would thank you better joe y'all keep praying for me will you amen let's power heads be honest before the holy spirit how many knows you need a deeper walk with god lord i really want that deeper walk with you god i want greater fellowship with you lord jesus don't you let me go from this service tonight after speaking to my heart like that and then for me to forget about it for me to let it pass for me to not change for me not to do this just here it is not acceptable god we want for you to come right now and change us lord if there's not a love in our hearts like it should be i ask you to forgive us help lord like i said lord we don't know what it's going to take to get our hands off of the things of this world and to start getting a real grip on you but you're going to cause it one of these days but i ask god that without the desperation that you'll help us to let go of the things of this world and begin to get a grip on the word of god and say god make me what i'm supposed to be lord because i'm supposed to have a walk like this with you i'm supposed to have the walk of enoch the walk of jesus the walk of the prophet the god if i expect to leave this world in a rapture if i truly was the son of god if i truly was in your mind and in your thoughts then lord jesus you have desired complete fellowship with me in this hour and you're going to have a bride without spot without wrinkle that is ready to go if there's anybody in this church or in the radio world or out there in the airwave world i pray god that they'll right now raise their hand say god i am not what they ought to be and after tonight i want to be a changed person lord i want to be more dedicated to you i want a closer walk with you a father i want the holy spirit like never before father lord jesus one thing i didn't say god and that is that you don't walk with a backslip person because you're backslid you don't walk backslid you just correct that person and bring them back in the walk with you god so i ask god tonight lord if there's any backslid lord bring them closer to you lord so that you can walk with them wash them white forgive us of our sins lord get it all under the blood father we're not what we're supposed to be and we're confessing it we say god forgive us and give us a closer fellowship with you lord so that you just have to nudge us you just have to put a little nudge in our hearts a little voice that'll be here loud and clear father when you speak to us whenever we do something or not doing something that we know we should god don't let us drown that out don't let us shove that aside but let it be real loud in our minds that we need to do this if we truly love you lord jesus we need to change you're not going to change we're the ones that need to change for you god and i pray god that every heart and every hand and i after tonight would have a closer walk with you that this world and the things of this world are secondary if not further down than that our fellowship that we have with you is top of the line it's first it has to be we want the kind of fellowship that jesus had with the father that could say i say nothing but what he tells me to say i do nothing but what he tells me to do [Music] the works that i do it's not me but it's god doing it let people see the holy spirit works in each and every life tonight from this thought night on let our neighbors see the holy spirit works let our people that we work around let them see jesus in everything that we do and say in jesus name we ask these blessings and favors amen and amen to be like jesus dear be like jesus on earth thy long to be like him all through livestreaming [Music]
