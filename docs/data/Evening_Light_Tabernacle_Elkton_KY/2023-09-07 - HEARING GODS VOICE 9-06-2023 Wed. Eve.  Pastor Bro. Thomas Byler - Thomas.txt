aren't you glad that your future looks good amen my we're just so grateful for having a god like what we do to know what you do amen and uh serve a god like what we serve amen why shouldn't we be the happiest people on the face of the Earth is that what he said amen God bless you good to see you Kaylee I even hadn't seen you in a coon's age amen how old is that little one now amen it was about a year before that probably or sort of that scene it's been a while all right talking yet not quite yet that's up closer to two before they do that amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads and talk to the Lord Lord Jesus we just come before you and we want to thank you Lord for being able to come into your house Lord and father to do something worthwhile something that's Everlasting and that's uh has a real benefit in our lives Lord all of the rest was just father passing the time so to speak Lord secondary temporal uh as Solomon said all is Vanity upon the Earth that all his vanity except for you and for the Eternal things Lord Jesus and that's what we come father this for is for the Eternal things that last forever we ask God that you speak to our hearts tonight Lord Jesus by Your Word Lord and help us Lord just to get out of the way that you might use this for your honor and For Your Glory and to speak to your people the things that you once said tonight father bless the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid upon the heart to minister tonight for we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen see whether Tommy brought a friend also we want to welcome him tonight amen praise the Lord amen amen well there ain't no telling what might happen tonight ain't it you name it it ain't because of you and it ain't because of me but it's because of him amen so whatever God is there's always the Supernatural and all things are possible to them that believe without with you nothing shall be impossible so the possibilities are endless amen so praise God and so I just want to share with you a little something I feel like the Lord's laid on my heart certainly is a message that I've spoke on before but I just feel kind of directed to go in this way again amen and so we want to speak with the help of the Lord on hearing the voice of God Amen hearing the voice of God so we'll turn first of all amen over and now it's kind of torn and I also had another thought as maybe sometimes we'll speak on and that's the Simplicity of God Amen want to speak on that sometime again the Simplicity of god let's go to Matthew 13 Matthew 13 if you will with me amen and verse 13. therefore speak I to them in Parables because they sing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand amen so how many understands that to really see something is to understand something amen do you see what I'm saying no I don't know what you're saying tell me again you're telling me again all of a sudden oh yeah I understand now I see now amen so it's about understanding what you're hearing amen and shall not understand and seeing they shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax grows in their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed at least at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear amen Hallelujah if you're in this category you're in a blessed you're either in one category or the other you're either a person that hears or you're a person that hears but does not understand and if you don't understand you really don't get it imagine not a year is to not get it it's to fail to get it amen that's why Jesus said blessed are your eyes ears if you can hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them amen Revelations if you will The Book of Revelations one I mean let's go to verse chapter 2 first amen chapter two inverse now notice this is of course going down through the seven churches that he spoke of in Revelations one and at the end of each Church age our message to each church he speaks these words in verse 7 of chapter 2 says and he that happened here he that happened here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will it give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God Amen then in verse 11 of the same chapter he that had the ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcome us shall not be heard of the second death my isn't that quite something to be able to hear to be able to hear that you're going to get to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God and the second one unto him that overcometh shall not be hurt in other words you'll never have to worry about the second death now we're not going to go through each one of them because that would take quite a bit of time but I do want to go to the last uh layout Asia Ages which is in chapter three and I want to go down to verse 19 of chapter 3. as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock amen If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will set with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne amen praise the Lord he that have an ear he says it twice here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may God add His blessings to the reading and the word you can be seated hearing the voice of God Amen my my mind how many knows there are so many voices in the world today so many different things there's so much noise going on in the world so it's because I'll tell you voice of God is just noise amen it's not the true voice amen now um first of all I want to read another one in John I believe it is quite a few scriptures here in John 10. and verse 27 and I'm going to read it wrong at first would that be okay he says my goats hear my voice and I know them and they follow me no he said my sheep know my voice know my voice and I know them and they follow me amen we see about this is how that Jesus says my sheep now we know that Israel amen the Israelites children of Israel Amen in Jesus this time amen he tried his best to get the sounds of his voice to penetrate into their ears the scribes and the Pharisees to get him to be able to hear he says look if you can't believe my words believe my works for they testify of who I am remember Nicodemus came to him at night and says we know that you're a man sent to your sin from God nobody can do anything no matter how much we disagree nobody could raise Lazarus from the dead unless he was of God but there's such a thing as jealousy and everything they closed their own ears to hearing what Jesus really had to say to him amen and because of that they completely missed salvation do not hear God's voice it's a Mis salvation amen amen there's many different ways to hear God's voice I can use many different things he can speak through nature just not so long ago I've read your story how brother bam said talked about an atheist that went all over the country preaching amen there ain't no God and all these things and he got a little sick I guess went up into the mountains to get a little reprieve and so forth and he began walked along the great big rocks and suddenly he looked at me Roxy some question came into his mind he said where did they come where did you come from huh oh my God now everything else that that man ever heard not the thing about this how many knows that we've got these little voices that we hear in our head oh yeah we got all kinds of voices if you're a human being you got more voices than you care to have and you had talking to you on a daily basis and everyone no thoughts every one of those thoughts that come your way they're either a God or they're of the devil they're the voice of God or their voice to the devil amen this man back to my story back to the everything that he had ever believed before amen since never tried to get him to understand or to look at the Rock and to ask the question where it came from he was always no if God would if God would be God he would have all of this chaos he wouldn't allow all this that and the other all this pain all the that's all the devil stopped everything poured into him isn't that right but finally God can use whatever he wants to he can use a rock he said because of that thought he realized he says you know his another thought came between I believe it was invited remember reading the quote writers he says could I have been wrong huh that little thought it came into his mind because I have been he opened up the door forgot to deal with him now because first of all you've got to before God you can even hear the voice you got to acknowledge hey you know I could be wrong amen especially his biggest what he's doing and believing there ain't even a God he better have a little more of an open mind isn't that right but he opened it up and it wasn't long but he got converted murder came in Christ became a Believer from I understand hello God can use a rock he can use whatever he wants he can speak through a whirlwind I believe it was uh Hebrews there it says God in Sun Dry times in diverse manner stake unto us by the prime outfits and so forth that's in these last days spoken unto his by his son amen the one one way God used to talk to him with the prophet and so forth but even Jesus when he was here said behold you prophets and scribes and wise men and some of them you'll scored in your synagogue and so forth and so forth isn't that right so God never ending profits and scribes wise men but back to our story think about it there's many different ways God can speak we know brother abandon himself he was seven years old and then he was carrying water for his father and so forth and there's a whirlwind to come into the tree and now all of a sudden here the nautical voice say don't you ever drink or smoke or defy your body in any way for I have a work for you to do when you get older amen how many knows anybody that comes up with a story like that by themselves you ain't got to worry about but if that was actually God Amen saying that to him then I want to hear what the man has to say as a matter of fact you're looking at a Prof product of that work that God had to do I mean he's with me God had to work and everybody here is a product of that work that God had to do he's behold I'll send you Elijah to the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers amen just like they had it on the day of Pentecost back to the book box back to the Bible away from all these voices amen all these different voices Amish boys Mennonite voice Holderman voice Baptist Methodist Pentecostal all these different voices but God said I'm going to give you a voice it's going to be my voice amen and before I get off this year I want to read you yeah I'm gonna have a little story first how many ready for Story Time amen I'm gonna read you a story of another way that God can use Amen to speak to our hearts amen and amen I better say it before I don't know I'll try to pick it up baby but I was listening to uh Vancouver and and their meetings they had folks that come up Amen to give a testimony about them services and everything and it would be amazing how many of those young people amen said that it was something in the message that caught their attention and something that spoke to them through that message you know amen but leave that and they'll pick it up here in a little bit now I know this is Saint John 10 amen and verse 16. let's go to back to 15. as the father knoweth me even so no I the father and I lay down my life for the sheep and uh deep have I which are not of this foe Now isn't he talking about cheap in the future Jesus is talking about sheep that he has in the future amen he says them also must I bring and they may hear my voice does that sound sure no and they shall hear my voice they shall hear my voice and shall there shall be one fold and one Shepherd amen so we see that we're even in the future he talked about how there's going to be and then people coming in the future amen now uh and of course we read part of that part of that Future's over in Revelations there amen where John of course saw and uh you know uh was we saw one sat upon the throne so forth saw the seven churches the seven angels and so forth let's get into that for just a minute shall we let's go back to Revelations Revelations one or uh yeah let's go back yeah let's go to Revelations one and I'm gonna let me see before I really get into this I'm gonna just touch on it and then I want to read your story before we get into this very deep one and verse 12 or actually let's go with verse 10 1 and 10. I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet saying I'm Alpha and Amiga the first and the last one thou seeest writing a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna bergamus titira Saras Philadelphia and liada Sia now notice and I turned to see the voice that Spate with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks now notice how John says first of all when he turned to look the first thing he saw when he heard the voice was something coming from Seven golden candlesticks now is that right all right we're going to stop there I want to read you this story of another way that God can speak before we get into this this way that God speaks all right brother man says a young man came to my house not long ago he said on the porch and I felt sorry for him an old beat up Chevy truck I want to talk to you and I said all right what is it and he said I come from Minneapolis he says and my wife went down to the church to the Pentecostal church and she got in the spirit now I just said the way he said it said she got in the spirit and said we did go once in a while to the Presbyterian church and he said she got in the spirit and she was very happy she come home and I and told me all about it and I wanted to go down there and get it he says now look honey you do whatever you want to and I'll work and make a living work and make a living but I'm not the religious type he said you go anywhere you want to it'll be all right Jesus well you ought to come down and get happy with us he said well we have a we have the greatest time and said she really was a changed person and said brother bam said that went on for about two years we quit playing cards and um I didn't go to any of the parties or and so forth like we didn't go to the parties like we used to said everything stopped and said I the church and I'd sit around and read the library book go down to the lodge or something and said one day I made a sale in in the car in my car lot he was a car salesman and I come in and I put my coat on and said it was summertime and said I put my cup there said on the road back said I'm up my coat he says and when I did I said I wonder if I gave him the keys and I reached down there in my pocket and if I'm not wrong but I'm talking about having like a little uh track or something somebody gave him and what I did I wondered if I had given him the keys I reached out in my pocket and pulled out a little piece of paper and it wrote on it where will you spend eternity said I just laid it down and turned the fans on and said and I picked it up again I couldn't get away from it where will you spend eternity and said I'm 40 years old I got to settle that thing said that's right said I just had to turn to work over to somebody else and I went home to seek God and I said I went to a famous Minister Mr Graham Billy Graham and said I went to his meeting said all he wants to all that wants to receive Christ stand up he said well I did he said accept Christ now as your personal Savior and it'll be settled said I'll I talked to some of the men there who told me that it's oh that's all I had to do well said I did the best I could said but I would it wasn't settled said I met up with the Nazarene people and said they're taking me back in the room and told me unless I got happy enough to shout that I wasn't Sanctified yet and so I stayed there and all of us prayed together until it sounded like one person praying said I'd get happy and shouted that they told me that's all over now I thought it was and then I went out but it was still not over I said I sold all my cars I was worth nearly half a million dollars I sold my car lot all my cars amen and said the only thing I got is just this old meter up car trying to give it to preachers and so forth where I can find trying to find where I can find peace to my soul he says I want to find the Lord he says and then I finally run into the Pentecostal people and they told me asked me if I ever spoke in tongues I told him no this is well you haven't got it unless you speak with tongues said they're taking it back and I prayed nearly half the night and got a little tent out there behind the Big Ten and said then I spoke in tongue and they said now you got it that's it brother I didn't have it and said went on down to Shreveport in Dallas the voice of healing said they had all the boys up there and said they tried to do me good but they couldn't do it and said and then they told me you as a prophet to come see you and you tell me surely and I crossed this and they said did you they tell me you cursed surely that you've crossed a separating line there's no hope for me if I had done all this and still didn't have it and I said well brother I want to tell you something I said no this is better than speaking I'm not a prophet that's what people say but said he says I'm just your servant but now you didn't need to go to apart from to straighten you out you just need the word of God and I says what uh Mr Grant told you it's the truth but the Nazarene people told you it's the truth about dependent people taught you the truth yet it's not but not all the truth to shout to raise up your hands speak with Thomas he be Christ receiving Christ is receiving the person of the Lord Jesus Christ then these other things take place after that see it's about the receiving Christ and you know personally see now you could do all that and still not have Christ yet he says well brother Brandon where can I find him I said I want to ask you something there's let's back go back to your story and he walked up and and he said well what do you mean God says you said that the day that when you come in you pick up a piece of paper something struck you and you said oh I want to see God I said uh up to that time you were going this way down this road and then you completely turned and you went this way he said what did that I said what changed your opinion what come into your heart that made you one time not care for God and so forth something that make you change to being loving God what done it he said well I don't know I said before that could be a creation there has to be a crate here to create that creation God came into your heart right there when you looked at that piece of paper he says you mean I've had it all along I said certainly brother you go to church I'm fine reading my library book and everything else all of a sudden stop stalking or will you spend eternity well most of it wouldn't have been for God I mean no man comes unto me except my father draw him first that was God draw him you can't hear the voice of God unless God opens up your ear to it and he opened up his ear he opened up his heart and God came right on in anybody been looking for some evidence some speaking in tongue shouting at this idea I mean that's all wonderful that's all fine but that's not receiving the person of Jesus Christ amen because your life has to Bear record of what you have gotten amen so yeah to think about it God can use your track he can use anything he wants to he's God you can be driving down the road oh can I just say this morning or this evening like Jesus said blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled oh if you have a thirst in your heart you're a blessed person he couldn't have cared less he sold his car lot he sold all his business got a lot of men I'm so amazing I got to find a boy he was serious about me you know there's some things that God does for us for free for salvation I mean as the gift of Salvation is completely free just give it to you but there's other things that are not free amen be hard for us just thing what is it brother what are you talking about what's not free well your character is not free nope it's not a gift character is not a gift amen it's something that you have to suffer for for it amen praise the Lord you know and I was I was just thinking but anyway so let's go back here to uh back here now the revelations I want to say that I believe the foremost way for God to speak to us is through the fivefold ministry preaching by the foolishness of preaching God bestowed to save them that belief that's how God chose it isn't that right I mean I thought you know you might hear a voice you might you might be reading God can speak to us many different way he can but the primary way that he uses and that he can is through the preaching of the word and think about it how much time will spend there amen and then we'll come and maybe within an hour or so listening to preaching maybe twice two hours or something like that a week amen but God speaks through amen and the reason I went into this because notice how many notes Let me just read the rest of this and then we'll explain it scene Seven golden candlesticks amen and in the midst of the Seven Candle six one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and a girt about the paps with a golden girdle brother Branham explained this as being girded like a judge amen is that right Church age spoke his head and his hair were white like wool that's why the snow his eyes were as a flame of fire his feet like unto fine brass if this as if they burned in the furnace and his voice was as the voice of many Waters right here's where I'd like to play that song the voice of many Waters amen what is this voice better man says it's the voice what are these many Waters many people what is God's voice where's God's voice in his seven Messengers in his Seven Stars in his ministers he said it's the voice of the ministers that's cried out to the people in every age standing there says you know that uh even a local body a pastor will be the judge for that community and so forth he said take because the prophet will meet this generation on Judgment Day amen that's right so think about that it's the voice of God that goes forth amen voice of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth goes a sharp to edged sword his kindness was as the sun shining in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and laid him and he laid his right hand upon me and saying fear not I am the first and the last I'm he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen I'm I know that's just one God he was alive he died on the calvary in his life forevermore and has the keys of hell and of death despite these things which thou see as seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou saw us in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks all right the two the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks all which thou saw us are the seven churches amens how many knows God has not just one mouth that he speaks anymore amen and when he was in Bible time but now he has many voices many mouthpieces those Seven Stars is who God was gonna use as his mouthpiece because if God's gonna say something you have to have somebody to speak it through amen that's why the foolishness of preaching what do we preach when we preach our own ideas no amen oh I wanted to preach on this sometime on how to how that if God is going to do anything he sends his word to do it I mean he believes he already gave us his word that's enough and what we preach we preach the word of God amen I believe the voice is still in the church even in Revelations the last chapter he says the spirit and the bride say come and him that is The Thirst come amen and drink of the Water of Life freely message and that resounding has to be sounded for two thousand years oh my he's still I mean did he still say come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden did you ever wonder sometimes oh my how many times some of the a lot of y'all have testified brother Bob I'll tell you what I don't know oh I think sister sharing different ones he said man I sometimes think you were Brad amen that you got some kind of microphone hung up there because we'll have spoken of the same thing or had a question on that same thing and then you go to hitting on it you got to speak in that how many knows that's why we want to just be yielded to God say God use me help me to say something that'll trigger amen and bring a light to it lost sheep amen that's how it works God quickens who we will by the foolishness of preaching by those seven stops or seven candlesticks seven ages seven Church ages even now we've been taught by the prophet Malachi forward and the days of the voice of the silent Angel and then when he meets shall begin to solve the mystery of God should be finished as he is declared to his servants of prophet he says you know the in the bride the bride of Christ God's real church will be and have the final voice to the final age hey man how many believes you're the mouthpiece of God 's using your mouth he has no mouth but yours no heart but years no hands but years no feet but years but he's got plenty of them if we're yielded to him oh Hallelujah praise be to God aren't you glad for that to have that voice of God Amen Amen to speak to us through the ministry through the word basically just saying what God Said I mean it was that say what God said every time for God to love the world then whosoever then he gave his only begotten son then whosoever should believe him should not perish but have everlasting life he that Hearth my words and believe it on me shall have everlasting life shall not die or come into condemnation amen all that Christ said how blessed we are when you think about how blessed you are to be able to hear amen I remember one time I remember so sorry brother Bannon being way up in the mountains and he was lost he was walking in circles and he was a God he told himself I can't get lost I'm a guide I know how to get it I know how the thickest part of the tree is going to be on the North side and so forth and amen but yet he found himself going in circles in a snowstorm huh and what happened he felt something touched his back hey man and make him turned around and look hey man I thought man if a person's lost in the world there's a master that's somebody that can touch you there's a voice that you can listen to a man that can guide you turn him around and amen he got into the lifeline showed him where the lifeline was that lead him right down there to his family back to his home I thought that's the way it is in this world with you and I if you're lost you're a sinner there's a Lifeline God has a way amen but you got to hear that voice the voice of God let's go with another one shall we amen praise the Lord it's found in uh First Kings let's go to First Kings First Kings thank you amen First Kings the 19th Chapter let me see 19 and verse 9. 19 it will be going with verse 9. this was of course after Elijah killed all those false prophets and so forth in Jezebel threatened to kill him the next day and he was up and he was in the cave he found a cave to Lodge in and so forth and he came thinner into a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto them here what here is thou Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant Throne thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great strong wind burned the mountains and breaking pieces the Rocks before the Lord and after the win an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake it fired but the Lord was not in the fire amen and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrap his face in the Menthol and went out and stood at the entering end of the cave amen listen to what the prophet says we find that he went 40 days and nights and God located him stacked standing back there in a cave God wanted to attract his attention so he'd send a great storm by and it ripped the mountains it was so powerful till the Rocks rat and so forth but God wasn't in the storm and it went before God did And Then There came an earthquake shook the Earth and still God wasn't in the earthquake there came a fire but God wasn't in the fire and then there came a still Small Voice and God was in The Voice brothers and sisters I have haven't we been back in the cave long enough and you have to and to know that there's been a lot of earthquakes and shaking around a lot of noise amen a lot of noise he says but where's Ben Bob out of it all that's the reason I said this morning he said there's got to come something deeper than just the healing service there's got to come something deep for them just a gift of speaking in tongues there's got to be something deeper than just Mighty rushing winds and so forth he says God's this isn't even in it we've had rushing winds all over the country Sensations blood in the face and then the hands and all kinds of signs but where's God at woo I mean listen to this all the great fuss Americans guilty of listening to those noises oh we love noise but God's not in the noise amen how many knows that whenever you're preaching the gospel you have to bring a balance to things we know that wherever Jesus is there's always a lot of noise hey man but it isn't necessarily hello doesn't mean that you necessarily Christian because of it because I'll tell you what right now the Terrors they pray he's God just as much as though he does We Like it Loud huh get too quiet off to sleep right because that preachers man he can't hold my attention at all if I scream a little well I'll have your attention we're just prone that way we like the fire we like the smoke I thought about concerts Brother Brad concert back Eastwood man look at the concerts used to be they have what big old fireballs going up bunch of smoke billowing everywhere and you know they got all kinds of what is it nowadays they have these uh fireworks everywhere any of that that is in simplicity I wondered why the prophet of God would have to go back into a cave all the way back into arcade for a day or two and seeking God's answer they're saying that these are demons and not a God these visions that I'm having everything I want to have an answer I'm going to go back there and I'm gonna die if I don't get an answer I'm gonna go back there and have to trade show three o'clock in the morning brother John he said finally he's in the seen a little flickering in the light coming into the cave huh let me tell you something sometimes God allows us you know like I said God gives us freely the gift of Salvation is free but other things God allows you to get into desperation because how many knows God loves sometimes to put us into desperation he loves perseverance he loves to see perseverance how do we know I'll tell you how we know because that woman that wants himself wanted something from the Lord Jesus amen he's not my needs not me to give the children's bread to Gentile dog didn't even talk to it for a while kept walking on can you imagine him walking automatic you just ignore her nobody did come on people and then after a while finally he said you know he said he makes that same he says yes yes Pastor that's the truth but don't even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master table he realized that she had the kind of persevere and she wasn't going to quit because he walked away from her he well she wasn't gonna quit because he called her a dog no she was gonna get in God's love stuff if God did all that for us he's looking for something from us he's seeing what we were all my every little thing that you do oh I wouldn't have to do it but why don't you do it anyway if it's where the Lord got a lot he sees what you do oh my for without faith it's impossible to please him if it's impossible to please for today to come to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that haphazardly seek him no diligently seek him God loves to see diligence out of us sometimes we need a day or two we need more time we need to seek the Lord I believe that we we don't see Visions we know we'll see dreams we don't see the things we do and then we don't try hard enough we don't spend enough time saying God I want this more than anything because I'll tell you when the prophet went back there he said Sunday I got 23 dollars in the bank I'm going down if I don't come back I'm dead cause I'm going there to die unless God talk to me that's what he said I got it right there huh you get into that kind of desperation you get God's attention sometimes it takes desperation God puts you in desperation God put you in Desperate places sometimes before you really call upon him saying God I need to hear from you yeah amen that's the truth anyhow he allows to get to those places oh my how many knows I meant even even uh remember when the disciples and then he was the three disciples on the way to Emmaus when they came and they talked to him amen and when they come to hit their house he made us he was going to go on by he was gonna keep going but they beat him come and stay he was waiting for an invitation just like when he said I stand at the door and knock If any man will open you've got to open from your side yeah amen got to open it up from your side all he can do is now and if you're a sheep you'll haste into that door and you'll open that door amen my praise me to God to hear the voice of God amen now notice America is guilting of listening too much noise we love noise but God although as honorable the things that they are yet God isn't in noise if that had been so when the Africans when they beat them tomtoms you ain't never heard such noises Rhythm and such dancing in the spirit have you huh God wasn't in it and we've had Mighty rushing Mighty winds and we've had all kinds of fires earthquakes shakings and great revivals and things like that and God wasn't in it if it hadn't been it would have showed itself so but after that come a still small voice amen preacher might yell so loud it doesn't mix the windows rattle but you'll still hear it in that still small voice something will say that's for me the Lord himself has to Quicken that word to you or you won't get a thing you'll walk out those doors just the same or worse as you came in unless God speaks to your heart amen I'll tell you right now oh my let me see if I have something here God is able this minute to Discovery cancer out of this building open up every blind and eye to set everybody in freedom and liberty God has provided away he's made a way he sent his son Jesus Christ the holy spirit is brooding over us today the Holy Ghost is all over us it's blessing us it's bringing an atmosphere Hallelujah oh my I might as well change my subject here a little bit we talk about amen from the foundation of the world when the Earth was with dark and it was with my form it was without it was void and there was Darkness upon the face of those all of the place and then it wasn't until the warmth of the sunshine amen the Holy Spirit as the prophet of God said begin to brood over the Earth and he brought flowers he brought trees he bought Greenery he brought cattle he brought out of me but everything by his brooding and by his calling hey man amen sure he did you love the Lord my can I finish that that's right it was the holy spirit's rooting vegetation trees and everything come we might call that the first rising of the Sun the time that the sun rose the first time but at the second rising of the Sun amen I like I like I like let me let me tie this in because it won't make no sense to you unless it's a mental picture today that we're gonna make amen so does let's just say he had great big wings around the earth brooding a man insane cooing and saying come the father has ordained you come I'm coming to perform what the father has said oh is it sinking in that first brooding with said come on to me are you a weary and heavy land amen the second rising of the sun amen it wasn't necessarily whenever Jesus rose from the grave but it was when it was he came back on the day of Pentagon and the Sun come down and he's shown in Peter's heart he's shown in there he said amen and I'll tell you what that seed that was on the inside they were sheep they were sheep seed and he quickened them Spider-Man says in the first event in the first time that sun came up rocks never grew nothing they just ate his rocket they didn't have the seed down on the inside Amen in the second time Jesus come amen and say oh my the disciples and everybody went out there sharing this gospel shining the light shining the light and then they shown the light of Shores you're a seed of God if that shine light shines in your heart it calls you from death to life it changed his appetite it changed his desires changed everything he heard the voice of God in his heart God today ma what he could do if we just let the Holy Spirit brood over us speak to your heart I mean it believes that when you go to work when you go down driving down the road wherever you go when your mind is on him let him come down there and speak to your heart oh and it's sweet isn't it wonderful I wouldn't change it for all the crack in the world no I wouldn't do it for the biggest marijuana High the big Budweiser I wouldn't change the sweetness of the holy spirit amen to detoxification of the holy spirit amen they're afraid that it makes you feel I wouldn't change it and trade it for nothing yeah oh my he'll speak to your heart listen to what he said that's right he can speak it all out of existence amen open every blinded eye he said the Holy Spirit he's brooding over us the holy spirit is all over us why is it that you can take a ham egg and put it on their brooder house to Mother hand don't have to be over there to hatch it just so it has to come a warmth it has to have a certain temperature I mean knows everyone we've got a about three or four of those little incubators amen you got to set the temperature isn't that right the right atmosphere hey man you put those eggs now I'm telling you what if my wife ever once said put a bunch of eggs in that Rooter house and we don't have a rooster in the yard I'm gonna tell her let's eat them eggs them eggs will never hatch why because if it hadn't been with the mailman amen that I don't have a seed it has nothing in there to Quicken some Pharisees they didn't have anything to quicken in their heart there was nothing to raise them from the bed but that woman that was in there oh I said well she had something he spoke to her he's shown the light to her she ran in the city isn't this the Messiah [Music] Jesus Christ came in this end right here amen did that thousands of times discern the thoughts and sense of the heart never was wrong didn't do anything to some people not a thing

brooder house and how the he is regulated the heat is kept over the egg until it's hatched and God is and has so said in order that one day through all the types way back from Adam down the Eve on down through the prophets down through Abraham he said it in order put it all the Old Testament showing what he was going to do and he finished that okay what He sent Jesus amen oh my who was wounded for our transgression Bruce foreign husband of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we were healed he finished it not in others then he anointed features and set it out now to bring that word to put the eggs in the right position the right place oh my honey please every service is unique God knows exactly who's going to sit in every service you don't sit there for no reason there's a reason why everybody whether it's even out there maybe somebody just said hey I just happened to touch on that and I'm streaming and I'm hearing that God can use that and speak to that heart and change ourselves forever I can do it then he said the same word and it anchors it out there God how many knows the word has to not just be up here and going over to microphones that's not where it's supposed to go the word's supposed to go right down an anchor in your heart I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I am healed he is my healer foreign he's your savior he's your healer he's your dilemma he's your Waymaker he's your God I lead you he'll guide you into all true he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you I'll be with you even all the way to the end of the world and here we are at the end of the world you realize what people's gonna hear some noise they're going to hear those atomic bombs cracking hundreds of times greater than Nagasaki or Hiroshima many many more times greater than that you'll hear that noise everywhere when they hear that noise it'll be too great you better listen to that still Small Voice before you hear the big noise because there's a this comes to mind over and Peter says there is a great noise isn't that right great noise I believe it was if I'm not wrong amen heavens and earth passing away all right back to my thought now notice he said his word it anchors out there and then it comes and hovers over it by the Holy Ghost until that word becomes life in the human heart amen how many so glad I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them Acts 2 38 repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of your sins and ye shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe that years and years ago amen birth for us the Son of God Amen and he's still here brooding and brooding until it makes it come alive in your heart the Holy Ghost alive in your heart there's so many too many people that claim it and they're dead amen all right listen until that word becomes life in the human heart and all Devils of hell can't keep life out of it yes sir whatever the egg is if it's a duck egg it'll bring forth a duck amen if it's a chicken it'll bring forth a chicken if it's a bird it'll bring forth if I promise amen salvation take it into your heart the Holy Spirit Will brood over it and it'll come to life you promise healing take it into your heart God's promised that it is his provided way oh man we've had all kinds of voices like I said Baptist method all kinds of denominational voices out there but he said you know that it's going to be in the evening time it shall be light and then we had like so to speak in a chicken yard Amen in all kinds but every time the eagle screamed he had some kind of a scream amen all that I no doubt this just comes to my mind first now but no doubt that every time an ego was scream amen trying to make a noise no doubt but them chickens would shut up it would probably have scare them no that sounds like a predator to me that sounds like something that would eat me they all shut up amen and that eagle fell out of place out of place kept screaming out of place out of place I just wasn't in place of Amish I was the place of man and I I wasn't in my place amen as a hippie and rock and roll all that place it was not my place I just didn't fit in and then one day I Heard a Voice it sounded like a scriptural voice to me that green Eagle screamed come out laughs Hallelujah oh my what did we hear we heard after the third chapter of Revelations the public God said the Mind goes up well in chapter 4 verse 1 after this I look the behold it all is open in heaven Hallelujah ready for this Eagle to come up isn't that right come on body there to the Barnyard I open up a way and the first voice which I heard as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up Heather I will show you things which must be Hereafter how many knows that the Bride of Jesus Christ me when we when the prophet began to preach all of these things amen there was one that sat upon the throne come up high and it shows us all these things come apart I heard that Voice come on up higher amen quickly now Revelations 18 another voice and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightning with his glory Trace that back and look back another bad message if he didn't say there were three Messengers one was all Roberts one was Billy Graham but the other one said was the voice it was a mighty angel Earth was lightened with his glory it wasn't just here it wasn't just uh Canada it wasn't it was all over the world stole Earth 500 000 of all heathens amen Hindu Buddha seeks change if your God can open this Blind Man's eyes I'll follow your religion but if I my Lord Jesus Christ whom I representative he'll open up his mind Blind Man's eyes will you follow not me but follow Christ and believe our Lord Jesus Christ people bought tore his shirt and coat and everything off just wanting to touch them them Indian people believe in touching and grabbing and all that other stuff amen horse was lightened with his glory and then he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is fall now wait a minute who's Babylon over in Revelation 17 and verse 5 he says and upon her forehead and it was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlems and Abominations of the Earth how many knows the Catholics are the mother Harlot they say they're the mother Church all for the Antichrist they are the mother Church but she had a lot of little harness and now her little harlots are allowing homosexuals preachers Pentecostal churches which is next to the message right next to us and then have women preachers lie everything else in the book to go on there in abomination and Abominations of the Earth but notice this Mighty Angel cried Babylon the great is Fallen it's fallen and has become the habitation of devils that's exactly what's happened in the prophecy 53 Pentecost Baptist Methodist Pentecostal all of them they're all dead [Applause] that's what he said that was a prophet of God God's voice you know a lot of times he discern the thoughts and intense of the heart and he says I got to go back and play that tape back I don't know what I said he uses my voice Jesus Christ was so real in his church until he could speak to a man use his voice and he'd not even realize what he's saying oh my brother bam says you know I've preached the gospel he says now if Jesus Christ will come and vindicate and prove it and after he would come and he would prove it he says he says now it's sin for you to unbelieve after God vindicates now it's sin for you to unbelieve disbelief how many believe it that voice meet everybody in this laodicea age on the Judgment Day can I say something we're going to play some tapes over there if you don't like tapes now they don't like tape now they're gonna get played some tapes one amen come on folks you know that's what he said he said this message will meet this generation on Judgment Day because it wasn't this man's doing it was the pillar of fire above his head that was doing it it was God that was doing it and he used the prophet's voice just like he uses any god-given Minister's voice do with it what you want amen a prophet with a Kentucky language is with fetches and totes and Carries and all kinds of Kentucky language not elegant and all of that God you know I was thinking on the way to church how we say that God hides himself in Simplicity well but Austin whenever I go hunting we hide in the woods don't we we try to hide what do we camouflage ourselves we try to wear camouflage the stupidest thing I ever heard inside here you know we God camouflage ourselves for the time and we've got manual put on these masks I know you do it put on all of that other stuff and then we teach that he's colorblind he can't tell the fun from another I could go when this here and do justice good probably I know I could but again because I've done it the only one important thing is make sure you're in the right the wind is in the right direction because they you ain't gonna deceive that on them they might you might be high enough they don't see you but they're gonna smell you if you ain't careful oh my but what does God do God hides himself in humility and simplicity amen in a bunch of nuts a bunch of crazy people following a prophet of God claiming God sent us a prophet I am not ashamed of it he said he would he said he had seven stars in his hand it's easy to believe Martin Luther it's easy to believe Wesley easy to be Paul Irene is in some of them but when you say brother Branham that was your messenger that was this generation's messenger hello that's where the rub comes hey man that's where the reproach comes that's where it's a little hard for people sometimes but it said truth nonetheless and I'll Proclaim it upon the house hops hey man how many believes it God bless you oh don't you like that can I finish this here and then we'll quit Babylon is Fallen he has declared it's Fallen it's done and become the habitation of devils even them churches are breaking up with each other they're falling apart because a lot of them don't want part of all that amen but the part that's breaking off still Cuts their hair and wears shorts and makeup and pants and everything else they just don't want homosexuals but everything else that much better off huh It's All or Nothing but unless you're willing to forsake call to follow me you cannot be my disciple amen and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all Nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornications with her and the merchants of the Earth are lack stretch through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice [Music] how many years it wasn't Amish It Wasn't Man Enough it wasn't Pentecostal it ain't no woman preacher ain't no much this mess but it was a real voice saying from Heaven come on over [Music] my people oh my God now tell me something who's gonna come out my people come out of her my people and it's her people it's people that will come out and partake not of her sins well it don't hurt to do this and it don't hurt to do that sounds like the slithering snake and eating or the serpent before he was a snake well God knows that you're gonna be smart if you believe it God it's not surely gonna die Thou shalt not surely die it doesn't really matter you're slithering it does matter every word man shall live not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God here to live by the voice of God by every word that he has spoken amen all everything has give is you your genuine Christian that's what you want to do praise the Lord and Pete and my people that keep me not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not her plague now let's just finish with this for our sins have reached unto heaven boy boy oh boy haven't they gone just about is rot low down as possible God has remembered her iniquities reward her even as she has rewarded you and double under her according to her works well in the cup which he has filled filled to her double that sounds like a real vengeance is mine saith the Lord whatever she did and however she glorified herself give her double it she's going to get double punishment I don't know about you but it's pretty bad isn't it and how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she has said in her heart I see the queen and am no Widow and Sal see no sorrow remember brother bam said that Russia is gonna send the nuke to Rome and blow it up in a day in an hour therefore shall her plant come in a day death morning and and famine she shall be utterly burnt with fire for strong is the Lord God who judges her hell my people can mock God they can do whatever they want they can be as craziness nasty as they want to be but the day will come when they're gonna get however nasty they were they'll get twice as much punishment amen oh my but I'm thanking God that we have heard the voice saying come on to her my people come on out of her come on out of here a lot of preachers a lot of deacons a lot of people say well you know if I believe that if I teach that brother about him I know it's a truth they'll kick me out he says well you got to get kicked out somewhere you want to be kicked out down here or you want him to kick you out huh you can't live on both ways no you got to make up your mind you got to decide which side of the fence you're on who are you going to serve amen whether you want to come out of her or whether you don't praise the Lord and God bless you we're not going to keep you until tonight tonight I know you all work hard but for this one final thought is I'm so good and I didn't bring the quote up but Brother Band says man he says you sisters do your dishes and then find you a nice little quiet place to talk to him and to be able to listen to that still Small Voice he says same way with the preachers now we can't get so busy find a nice quiet place somewhere and listen to that still Small Voice don't be in such a rush don't hurry so much that you can't hear that's still small voice how many believes you're led by that still Small Voice day by day Mond hour by hour telling you to do this telling you not to do that and how I would love to be able to sit here and talk detail a lot of things but you know anything that leads you the wrong way anything that's wrong is of the devil everything that's good and right is of God Amen you have to weigh every thought that comes into your mind listen to every voice every thought that comes into your mind you got to guard it I believe it's bringing into captivity every thought because God will speak to your mind he'll speak to your mind through your heart comes from here and they need to come here and you'll have a thought don't you just love them good thoughts oh I hate them evil thoughts amen the thoughts that come into my mind I'm thinking sometimes boy I'll tell you what I don't know how I would demonstrate it but sometimes you get to think and stuff you get negative or whatever that's just them that bird that comes down he's making a nest it's time to Glide a match get that thing off I'm burning say don't you ever come back amen don't let him make a nest control what goes through your mind listen to the right voice when it speaks to you because that's the most powerful thing there is is that still Small Voice God bless you stand with me tonight amen it's hard to quit how many loves the Lord that's powerheads Lord Jesus I trust and hope fathered it but something was said that helped your people tonight Lord that your spirit spoke something to somebody's heart and they needed that may they recognize that we don't Lord Jesus there's a lot that was said a lot of your word was said but it'll be maybe just that one or two little things that really touched people touch somebody says I needed that well Jesus I pray God that it was a blessing to your people tonight Lord that you had your way Lord and you said what you wanted said Lord that I could have just been out of the way Lord and father you could speak to hearts father we thank you Lord Jesus you said you'd never leave us neither would you forsake us but I'll be with you even in you even to the end of the world and we believe that Lord that you are when we ask God that you'd help us each one to always try never to do the wrong thing and we'll only accomplish that God by listening to the right voice and let the right voice lead us father and we pray God that you would do that for each and every one in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you Church [Music] and Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus [Music]
