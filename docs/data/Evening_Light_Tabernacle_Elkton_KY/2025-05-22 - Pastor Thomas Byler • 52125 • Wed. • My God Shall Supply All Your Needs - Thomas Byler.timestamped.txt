[50:38] seems to be a good time of the year. I'm
[50:40] not really in interested in doing the
[50:42] fall because everybody else is doing it
[50:44] and it just you know it just doesn't
[50:47] work too good. But if we can find a time
[50:49] slot like what we did. Amen. And I think
[50:51] brother Tommy and whoever was really
[50:53] trying to get the time slot together and
[50:54] make it all work, we appreciate it.
[50:56] Amen. And so we certainly appreciate all
[50:59] that brother Tommy did. Amen. Amen. And
[51:02] so uh I've been thinking about saying
[51:05] something for a little bit. Amen. And I
[51:08] guess I will since it comes to mind. You
[51:10] know, sometimes I've I've I've lived to
[51:13] see people come and go. Ain't that
[51:15] right? I've seen people be on flame and
[51:18] fire and then die out. And you know, I'd
[51:21] rather you just be a little calmer and
[51:23] go to distance, right? But now I like
[51:26] somebody that's fired up. And we know
[51:28] Tommy's fired up. Amen. And so I just
[51:30] been watching, you know, and uh I'm
[51:33] thankful, you know, that he's keeping
[51:35] pressing on. Amen. Amen. More power to
[51:38] him. Ain't that right? And so that's
[51:40] wonderful. Amen. But Amen. So we
[51:42] appreciate that. Amen. A man that's
[51:44] fired up for God. Amen. suggesting
[51:46] having meetings with them and then me
[51:47] praying about it and deciding to go
[51:49] ahead with it and say, "Yeah, let's
[51:51] let's go ahead and try this and and see
[51:53] how it works out, you know, in that time
[51:54] frame." And it all worked out good by
[51:56] the grace of God. Amen. And we certainly
[51:58] enjoy Amen. all the different churches.
[52:00] We had more uh participation than we've
[52:04] had in quite a while. Amen. So, Amen.
[52:07] Uh, I was I was of course a little
[52:09] skeptical, you know, because it seems to
[52:11] be hard to get meetings together and
[52:12] having different churches come and help,
[52:14] but we certainly seen it last weekend.
[52:16] Amen. And so we appreciate, Amen.
[52:19] everything everybody did and the
[52:20] ministers and so forth. But a special
[52:22] thanks to the congregation here, amen,
[52:25] for making it so easy. And so, Amen. and
[52:28] and just and doing all that you've did.
[52:31] Amen. So, God richly bless you for that.
[52:35] Amen.
[52:36] I'll be ministering tonight and Sunday
[52:39] morning and then brother Brad will be
[52:41] ministering next Wednesday and I think
[52:42] brother Joe is going to be back the
[52:44] following Amen Sunday to get our first
[52:46] Sunday service and grace I haven't
[52:50] talked to you about this yet but we need
[52:52] to look at the 8th or the 7th of June
[52:55] the 7th of June to have the Ber uh uh
[52:59] Ber farm
[53:01] fellowship fellowship I guess you call
[53:04] fellowship and fishing
[53:05] something like that. Amen. And so,
[53:08] because we want to do I want to do it as
[53:10] soon as possible so it isn't so hot. You
[53:13] know, the sooner we do it, the cooler
[53:14] it'll be. Amen. And so, uh, so if the
[53:17] ETH don't work for everybody, too many
[53:19] of us or whatever, uh, then let us know.
[53:22] Okay? Not the eth. ETH is Sunday. I keep
[53:25] saying ETH, but the 7th of June. Did I
[53:27] got the right month? I think so. All
[53:29] right. Yeah. So, that's in about three
[53:31] weeks, something like that. It's not
[53:33] very far away. Amen. But amen. If
[53:35] everybody wants to do that, I think
[53:37] that'd be nice. All right. Amen. So,
[53:40] let's look at that and we'll go from
[53:42] there. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's
[53:47] stand and we'll begin to just share.
[53:52] Um, basically Sunday, Monday morning,
[53:56] Monday morning about 3:30, we was all
[53:59] supposed to go fishing, I guess, by
[54:01] about six o'clock. And I woke up and I
[54:04] wanted to sleep right up till close to
[54:05] then. But I woke up at 3:30 and my mind
[54:08] got to going. Amen. And the Lord began
[54:10] to just pour things out. And and this
[54:13] time instead of just going back to
[54:14] sleep, I got up. Amen. I got back up, I
[54:17] got up, sat at the table, and before I
[54:19] knew it, it's not 3:30, but by 5:00, you
[54:22] know, and I had just almost wrote my
[54:24] whole message out in that hour and a
[54:26] half. So, Amen. And so we uh studied
[54:30] some again today just just you know kind
[54:32] of add a little bit to it and see what
[54:34] the Lord would have. It's certainly
[54:35] something that we're all familiar with
[54:37] and something I've spoken on before but
[54:40] uh that's what the Lord laid on my heart
[54:42] so perhaps it's for somebody. Amen. I
[54:45] certainly trust that it will be. Amen.
[54:48] And so let's bow our heads and go before
[54:50] the author Lord Jesus as we come before
[54:52] you Lord. Thankful, Lord, to be able to
[54:54] assemble ourselves together again in
[54:56] your name, Lord. We just pray, Father,
[54:58] that you'd have your perfect way, Lord,
[55:01] and that this service, Lord, would be
[55:03] operated, conducted, Lord, just as you
[55:07] have thought of it, that it would be
[55:08] before the foundation of the world,
[55:10] Lord. And all we can do is surrender
[55:12] life, surrender our hearts, our mind,
[55:15] our thoughts, our lips, our ears to you,
[55:18] Lord. And if we ask God that you'll come
[55:20] and speak to our hearts now, Father, the
[55:23] words that you want us to say, Father,
[55:25] the words that you want people to
[55:27] receive and and the change that you want
[55:30] to make in our hearts and lives, Lord,
[55:32] through the preaching of the word, we
[55:34] ask you to come now and and bless every
[55:36] portion of it in Jesus name. Amen. One
[55:40] more thing that I forgot before I go on.
[55:43] Amen. And
[55:48] uh here it is two pages back. Brother
[55:52] Glenn wanted me to Amen. talk about
[55:55] brother Murray Reeves, right? He a
[55:58] testimony. Elizabeth wanted us to she
[56:01] wanted to thank the church for their for
[56:03] the prayers for him because he's at home
[56:05] now and a cat scan showed that
[56:07] everything went good. Amen. And so, you
[56:10] know, by God's grace, everything's
[56:12] looking good for him. So, let's give the
[56:13] Lord a hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord
[56:15] Jesus."
[56:18] Amen. Amen. Sister Margaret. Amen. She's
[56:22] back home also and eating a little bit
[56:25] more. Amen. And getting some of her
[56:27] feeling back. So, just a slow go there,
[56:29] but still water not building up in her
[56:32] stomach from what I understand right
[56:34] now. So, praise the Lord for that. Amen.
[56:36] Let's give the Lord a hand for that.
[56:37] Amen. God is doing things. Amen.
[56:42] Amen. Praise the Lord. All right.
[56:45] Um Oh, and I'm going tell you, Amen. I'm
[56:49] I don't usually do this, but I think I
[56:52] will this time. I think it'd be okay to.
[56:54] I know. We took a love offering off for
[56:56] the preachers, and it ended up being
[56:58] about 2,200 each. Amen. So, thank y'all.
[57:01] God bless you. Amen. Good offering for
[57:03] them. Amen. Take care.
[57:05] Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. Now,
[57:09] turn your Bibles if you will and we'll
[57:11] go to Philippians and we'll just start
[57:13] here. Amen. And try to go as far as we
[57:17] can. Amen. This is certainly certainly a
[57:21] message I feel like that what you could
[57:22] take a series from, make a series of.
[57:26] Amen. And so, but we'll just go as far
[57:30] as see what the Lord will
[57:31] have. Amen.
[57:35] Philippians
[57:38] 4 and
[57:41] verse
[57:43] 19. But my God shall supply all your
[57:47] need according to his riches in glory by
[57:51] Christ Jesus. Amen.
[57:55] Amen. Y'all like that? Now, let's look
[57:57] at another scripture. I just saw this
[58:00] across the page. Amen. And I thought
[58:02] that I would bring it out. Notice just
[58:04] before Paul said that in verse
[58:08] 11, he said, "Not that I speak in res
[58:12] respect of need or want, for I have
[58:15] learned that whatsoever state I am
[58:16] therewith to be content. I know how to
[58:19] be a base, and I know how to abound.
[58:22] Everywhere and in all things I am
[58:23] instructed both to be full and to be
[58:26] hungry, both to abound and to suffer
[58:28] need. But I can do all things through
[58:31] Christ which strengthenth me. Amen.
[58:34] Isn't it something that he said that
[58:35] about himself and then just a few more
[58:37] verses later he says, "My God shall
[58:40] supply all your need." Amen. According
[58:44] to his riches in glory.
[58:47] Amen. All right. Let's just stop there a
[58:50] minute. In other words, he's going to
[58:52] supply your need according to the riches
[58:56] that he has in glory.
[58:59] How? By Christ Jesus.
[59:03] How many knows the phrase we have said
[59:04] all? He's all I need. He's all I need.
[59:08] Amen. He is all I need. And this comes
[59:11] back to me again just now for the first
[59:13] time since Monday morning. Amen. And
[59:16] that is uh uh you know Jesus is the
[59:20] answer. How many knows that Jesus is the
[59:23] answer? Amen. And Jesus supplies all of
[59:27] your need. That's why we say that
[59:29] whenever you have Jesus in your heart,
[59:31] you have everything that you have need
[59:33] of. Why do we say that? It's because if
[59:36] you have him, he is the supplier of all
[59:39] that you have need of. So he is all you
[59:42] have need of because he supplies all
[59:45] your needs. God bless you. You can be
[59:48] seated
[59:49] tonight. Amen.
[59:55] Way back in the Old
[59:57] Testament, I believe it was in
[59:59] Deuteronomy 8 and I'll go 7-10. It says
[1:00:03] 8 and 7 through 10. For the Lord thy God
[1:00:07] bringeth
[1:00:08] thee into a good land. Don, I'm not so
[1:00:12] sure if that was the scripture that you
[1:00:13] had I think it is. And that when I read
[1:00:16] that, I thought that's the same
[1:00:17] scripture that you had been that you
[1:00:19] that the Lord spoke, Amen. to your heart
[1:00:22] when Amen. when the Lord blessed us.
[1:00:25] Amen. He says, "For the Lord thy God
[1:00:27] bringeth thee into a good land, a land
[1:00:29] of brooks of water, of fountains and
[1:00:32] depths that spring uh out of the valleys
[1:00:36] and the hills."
[1:00:41] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:00] Amen. And I just thought about another
[1:01:03] scriptures. I stopped because I wanted
[1:01:04] to tie this together. I had this thought
[1:01:07] before and I didn't write it down, but
[1:01:09] it just comes to me now. Amen. Praise
[1:01:12] the Lord. I love the sound. I like the
[1:01:15] sound. Can y'all Does it Is it different
[1:01:18] for
[1:01:19] y'all? Is it a little different for
[1:01:21] y'all? I know it has a little bit like a
[1:01:23] echo or whatever, but I can hear myself
[1:01:27] speaking, so I know I'm
[1:01:29] speaking. Anyway, I I like it. So, I
[1:01:32] hope that works out and we don't have
[1:01:33] too much rebound. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:01:36] So, we can give the Lord a hand for
[1:01:38] answering another prayer. I ain't got to
[1:01:40] wire this crazy stuff on my head.
[1:01:43] Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh, so he says,
[1:01:46] now notice here, he says, fountains and
[1:01:49] depths and springs out of valleys and
[1:01:52] hills, a land of wheat and barley and
[1:01:55] vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a
[1:01:58] land of olive oil, oil, olive and honey,
[1:02:02] a land wherein thou shalt eat bread
[1:02:04] without scarceness.
[1:02:07] Amen. Think about what God was supplying
[1:02:10] for them back in the Old Testament.
[1:02:13] Ain't that right? That's right. Without
[1:02:16] scarcess, thou shalt not lack anything
[1:02:21] in it.
[1:02:23] Amen.
[1:02:25] Praise the Lord. Isn't that wonderful?
[1:02:28] Whose stones are iron, and out of whose
[1:02:31] heels thou mayest dig brass. When thou
[1:02:34] hast eaten and are full, then shalt thou
[1:02:37] bless the Lord thy God. For all the good
[1:02:41] land which he hath given thee.
[1:02:44] Amen. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord, oh
[1:02:47] my soul, and all that is within me,
[1:02:50] bless his holy name. If God's been good
[1:02:52] to you, you ought to bless him a little.
[1:02:55] You ought to give him a little honor.
[1:02:57] Give him a little
[1:02:59] praise. Amen. Hallelujah. He's worthy of
[1:03:02] it. Don't believe you believe. Amen. But
[1:03:05] beware that thou forget the not the Lord
[1:03:08] thy God in not keeping his commandments
[1:03:11] and his judgments and his statutes which
[1:03:13] I command thee this day. Least when thou
[1:03:15] hast eaten and are full, and has built
[1:03:18] goodly houses and dwell therein. And
[1:03:21] when thy herds and thy flocks multiply,
[1:03:23] and thy silver and thy gold is
[1:03:25] multiplied, and all that thou hast is
[1:03:28] multiplied, then thy heart be lifted up,
[1:03:31] and thou forget the Lord thy God, which
[1:03:33] brought thee out of the land of Egypt
[1:03:35] from the house of
[1:03:36] bondage.
[1:03:38] Amen. Praise the
[1:03:40] Lord. Hallelujah. I'm going to stop
[1:03:43] right there. Amen. So, notice how he's
[1:03:46] saying here. Let me see if I missed
[1:03:47] something back here. Uh just write that
[1:03:50] at down if you want because the whole
[1:03:52] chapter is really good because I missed
[1:03:54] a lot on there. Amen. How that God talks
[1:03:57] about how he brought you out of the
[1:03:58] land, humbled thee, suffered thee uh uh
[1:04:02] not to be hungered and so forth, fed
[1:04:04] thee with mana which thou kneest not and
[1:04:06] all of these things that he did
[1:04:08] raignment that wax not old upon thee.
[1:04:11] Amen. Thy foots and so forth. All that
[1:04:13] he did. Don't forget that. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:16] So we see there where he talks about you
[1:04:18] know amen from from he told didn't he
[1:04:21] tell uh Abraham go up on this hill and
[1:04:24] look as far as you can see to the east
[1:04:26] as far as you can see to the west north
[1:04:29] and south how many he said it's all
[1:04:31] yours.
[1:04:33] Amen. It's all yours.
[1:04:36] How many believe we've been given a a
[1:04:38] kind of a land like that? Amen. that
[1:04:40] Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:04:42] faith, that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:04:45] in love may be able to comprehend with
[1:04:48] all the saints what is the breadth and
[1:04:51] the length and the depth and the height.
[1:04:53] Amen. We got a little depth and height.
[1:04:56] We got a little look this way, look that
[1:04:58] way. And that's what we want to do with
[1:05:00] the help of the Lord. We want to look
[1:05:01] this way. We want to look over into the
[1:05:02] promised land and see what really all
[1:05:05] that is ours.
[1:05:08] Amen. It'll certainly take more than one
[1:05:10] night. It'll take a long time for us to
[1:05:13] really try to comprehend, amen, what the
[1:05:16] depth of God is, what the love of God
[1:05:19] is. Amen. And to know the love of Christ
[1:05:23] which passes knowledge that ye might be
[1:05:26] filled with all the fullness of
[1:05:29] God. So we see here that he says,
[1:05:32] "You're not going to lack." He said, if
[1:05:34] I can find it again. Amen. And I believe
[1:05:36] he said it right down around
[1:05:39] here.
[1:05:41] Amen. Let me see if I can find it. There
[1:05:44] it is. Verse nine. A land wherein thou
[1:05:47] shalt eat bread without scarceness. And
[1:05:51] thou shalt not lack anything in
[1:05:53] it. Notice Paul said, "My God shall
[1:05:57] supply all your needs."
[1:06:04] Well, should I just say what comes to
[1:06:06] mind? I guess if he don't supply it,
[1:06:08] then you must not meet it.
[1:06:14] That's right. Cuz it's a promise of God
[1:06:17] that he'll supply it.
[1:06:21] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] Another one in the Old Testament be
[1:06:27] Psalms
[1:06:28] 34 Paul said David said I will bless the
[1:06:33] Lord at all times.
[1:06:36] His praise shall be in my mouth when we
[1:06:39] have special meetings.
[1:06:44] Once in a while well we had a good time
[1:06:47] but that's special me. No, I will bless
[1:06:49] the Lord and I will praise him and I
[1:06:52] will bless him and my his praise shall
[1:06:54] be in my mouth continually.
[1:06:58] My soul soul shall make her boast in the
[1:07:00] Lord. The humble shall hear thereof and
[1:07:03] be glad. Now I'm reading a little extra
[1:07:05] here if that's okay, but I'm getting to
[1:07:07] my point. Oh, magnify the Lord with me.
[1:07:13] Amen. Oh, magnify the Lord with me and
[1:07:16] let us exalt his name
[1:07:20] together. Hallelujah. Let's exalt his
[1:07:24] name together.
[1:07:27] Hallelujah. How many believes Jesus?
[1:07:30] Jesus. That's right. The Lord Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ, he is to be exalted.
[1:07:37] Amen and amen.
[1:07:40] I saw the Lord and he heard me and
[1:07:42] delivered me out of all my fears.
[1:07:48] They looked upon they looked unto him
[1:07:51] and were lightened and their faces were
[1:07:53] not ashamed. This poor man.
[1:07:56] This poor man cried and the Lord heard
[1:08:01] him and saved him out of all his
[1:08:04] troubles.
[1:08:07] Aren't you glad that God heard your cry
[1:08:11] when you called to him and he saved you
[1:08:14] out of all your troubles?
[1:08:21] Glory. I'm so glad for that.
[1:08:24] Amen. The angel of the Lord encampeth
[1:08:28] round about them that fear him and
[1:08:31] deliverth them.
[1:08:34] Amen.
[1:08:37] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[1:08:40] Blessed is the man that trusteth in
[1:08:42] him. Now, here we come to our point. Oh,
[1:08:45] fear the Lord, ye his saints, for there
[1:08:49] is no one to them that fear him. Amen.
[1:08:57] The young lions do
[1:08:59] lack and suffer hunger, but they that
[1:09:03] seek the Lord shall not want any good
[1:09:09] thing. Come on, people think about it.
[1:09:12] That's a promise of God. If you fear
[1:09:15] God, he promised you're not going to
[1:09:18] lack any good thing.
[1:09:24] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:09:27] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[1:09:32] want.
[1:09:37] Amen. How many glad to have a shepherd
[1:09:39] like that?
[1:09:42] The Almighty, Lord Jesus Christ, is like
[1:09:44] a mother tending to her children and she
[1:09:48] sees and and supplies everything that
[1:09:52] they have need of. How many knows a good
[1:09:54] mom tends to her children and she wants
[1:09:56] to make sure they have everything they
[1:09:59] need?
[1:10:01] What? They want the right vitamins, the
[1:10:03] right food, the right clothes, the right
[1:10:05] shoes. They have do everything. But they
[1:10:08] all grow up and be real Christians and
[1:10:10] be amen to have everything they need.
[1:10:13] And that's the same way it is with God.
[1:10:15] God wants you to be fully supplied.
[1:10:19] He wants you to be fully equipped. Yeah,
[1:10:23] he tease to every part of your life.
[1:10:27] He cares for you.
[1:10:33] Amen. Amen. My title is I guess he may
[1:10:36] have put it up there. My God shall
[1:10:37] supply all your
[1:10:41] need. Amen. How many knows there is a
[1:10:46] lot of needs?
[1:10:50] Amen.
[1:10:52] a lot of needs.
[1:10:58] Okay, let me see
[1:11:03] here. Psalms the next. It seems like I'm
[1:11:07] missing
[1:11:10] one. Yeah, I am. That's over in
[1:11:13] Exodus. Exodus 16.
[1:11:18] Exodus 16:12 says, "I have heard the
[1:11:20] murmurings of the children of Israel.
[1:11:23] Speak unto them, saying, At evening ye
[1:11:26] shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye
[1:11:30] shall be filled with bread, and ye shall
[1:11:33] know that I am the Lord your God."
[1:11:37] Now I the main point I want to get to is
[1:11:39] further down, but I read that up there.
[1:11:41] And as I read that, what came to mind
[1:11:44] was I thank God that he still has
[1:11:47] preachers
[1:11:49] like what we had last weekend that will
[1:11:51] feed you. Why? Cuz God wants you fed. He
[1:11:56] wants you full in the morning. He wants
[1:11:58] you full at night. What would we do if
[1:12:01] we didn't have anointed preachers to
[1:12:03] bring the word of God?
[1:12:06] Where will we be at?
[1:12:08] How many believes we need that? God
[1:12:11] supplies that. He says, "I'm going to
[1:12:12] make sure that you eat good."
[1:12:19] This is no time to be the skinny calf
[1:12:22] coming out of the barn,
[1:12:24] saying, "The days of miracles has
[1:12:26] passed. Oh, such
[1:12:27] fanaticism." No. I want to be that fat
[1:12:30] calf that kicks its legs up in the air,
[1:12:35] squalls, making crazy sounds. Amen. And
[1:12:38] just enjoying itself real good, jumping
[1:12:41] around and kicking up its heels. And
[1:12:43] because why? It's had plenty of
[1:12:45] nutrition. It's been eating good.
[1:12:49] Let me tell you something. We couldn't
[1:12:51] have had a service like that this
[1:12:53] weekend. Amen. If the evening light
[1:12:54] tabernacle saints wouldn't have been
[1:12:56] eating good, wouldn't be spiritually
[1:12:58] healthy. We didn't sit down on the
[1:13:01] preacher and fold our hands. No, we
[1:13:03] participated. We pulled. And that's what
[1:13:06] makes the difference. Others from other
[1:13:08] churches come together. Amen. All it was
[1:13:10] is more
[1:13:13] people. Amen. Coming together and having
[1:13:16] a real big fire.
[1:13:19] Amen. Makes a huge difference. Brother
[1:13:22] Tim got up and started preaching. Well,
[1:13:24] kind of looks back, you know, it'd be
[1:13:25] easy to preach to y'all. Joe says, "I
[1:13:28] told
[1:13:29] you that's I told you evening tabernacle
[1:13:32] ain't those people easy to preach to."
[1:13:37] I've been in other places, man. I had to
[1:13:39] plow, not preach.
[1:13:43] I called it
[1:13:47] plowing. Amen.
[1:13:52] But I thank God for churches that are
[1:13:54] easy to preach to that love the Lord and
[1:13:56] and respond to the
[1:14:01] word.
[1:14:03] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's right. And
[1:14:06] I know that I am the Lord your God. You
[1:14:08] shall know. You'll be filled and you're
[1:14:11] going to know that I am the
[1:14:12] Lord. How many mean that that's exactly
[1:14:15] right? Now on down. This is this has to
[1:14:19] do with the mana that fell.
[1:14:26] Okay? And it talks about when the dew
[1:14:29] came, you know, how mana fell and
[1:14:31] everything. But let's go down to verse
[1:14:33] 16. This is the thing which the Lord has
[1:14:35] commanded. Gather of it every every man
[1:14:39] according to his
[1:14:41] eating and for every man according to
[1:14:44] the number of your persons.
[1:14:46] Take ye every man for that for them. I'm
[1:14:49] gonna go down here with this a little
[1:14:50] bit, Brother
[1:14:51] Carson. Take every
[1:14:53] man for them which are in his tents. And
[1:14:58] the children of Israel did so, and
[1:14:59] gathered, some more, and some less. And
[1:15:03] when they did meet
[1:15:07] it, he had he that gathered much had
[1:15:10] nothing over, and he that gathered
[1:15:12] little had no lack. Amen. I like that.
[1:15:16] She says, "They gathered every man
[1:15:18] according to his eating." How many know
[1:15:22] it was just right? Don't you like that
[1:15:24] when you get fed just right?
[1:15:27] Some people
[1:15:28] are
[1:15:30] gluttonous. Some people are a little
[1:15:32] heavy maybe, and they going to have to
[1:15:34] have
[1:15:35] two, maybe three. But he's saying, "Get
[1:15:39] what you need. Get what you eat. And in
[1:15:42] the end, you're going to have be
[1:15:43] satisfied. You're going to have just
[1:15:45] what you want. How many glad that when
[1:15:48] the Holy Spirit feeds us, you're
[1:15:50] satisfied.
[1:15:53] Now Jesus says, you know, the bread that
[1:15:55] that mana that fell, they got hungry
[1:15:57] again and they die. But he says, I am
[1:16:00] the mana that come down from heaven. If
[1:16:02] a man eats this mana, he'll never hunger
[1:16:05] again. Amen. Amen. And he'll have
[1:16:08] eternal life. This will give you eternal
[1:16:11] life. This mana that you and I are
[1:16:12] eating. Amen.
[1:16:16] Amen. Same way with the drink. They
[1:16:18] drank from the spiritual rock, but they
[1:16:21] all are dead. But the water that I give
[1:16:23] you, how many glad when you get that
[1:16:26] water, you'll never thirst again. It'll
[1:16:29] quench your thirst.
[1:16:32] It'll fill that void.
[1:16:35] It'll make you whole. Fill my cup, Lord.
[1:16:37] Come and make me whole. That's what I'm
[1:16:40] desiring tonight. Lord, make me whole.
[1:16:47] That's what we're working for.
[1:16:51] Praise the
[1:16:54] Lord. Aren't you glad that there's a man
[1:16:58] that you and I are eating on?
[1:17:03] That is a dress that you and I are
[1:17:05] dressing with.
[1:17:07] Amen. Brother Bam says, you
[1:17:10] know, I've got the quote. But I don't
[1:17:12] guess I'll pull it up. But he says, you
[1:17:13] know, the hospitals and the whole world
[1:17:15] is full of dissatisfied people.
[1:17:20] Why? They have a need. How many believe
[1:17:23] God made the whole world needy?
[1:17:27] But if they don't fill that need with
[1:17:29] the real thing that satisfies, they'll
[1:17:32] always be dissatisfied.
[1:17:40] Paul was a satisfied person. Imagine
[1:17:44] Paul was not a grumbler. He was not a
[1:17:46] complainer. He knew that if he's hungry,
[1:17:49] if he has need or if he's full, I have
[1:17:53] learned to be content. Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:55] I know I know this one thing that
[1:17:57] whatever I'm going through, you are my
[1:18:00] supplier. You take care of me.
[1:18:04] How many knows? He is our supplier. He
[1:18:07] cares about us.
[1:18:15] Amen. Praise the
[1:18:18] Lord. So if you're a Christian, God has
[1:18:21] promised that you shall not lack any
[1:18:24] good
[1:18:26] thing. Amen.
[1:18:36] Isn't this something how that God has
[1:18:40] absolutely made the world a demand and a
[1:18:46] supply situation? It's a demand and a
[1:18:51] supply situation.
[1:18:54] He puts that void in people's lives,
[1:18:58] that place of
[1:19:00] emptiness, that place of incompleteness,
[1:19:04] so that you'll search.
[1:19:07] He'll make you thirsty, so you'll be
[1:19:08] thirsty. Even Cain is thirsty. Even the
[1:19:12] devil's people are thirsty. The Indians
[1:19:15] were thirsty. The Africans are thirsty.
[1:19:18] Everybody has a thirst. They have a
[1:19:20] need.
[1:19:26] I wish they could hear me in Africa. God
[1:19:29] has
[1:19:30] supplied a thirst quencher.
[1:19:34] Amen. Something that'll quench your
[1:19:36] thirst. Something that will satisfy you.
[1:19:44] And it's
[1:19:45] himself. It's
[1:19:47] himself in every aspect and for every
[1:19:51] aspect of our
[1:19:53] lives. He has provided you what you have
[1:19:56] need of. It doesn't matter what it is.
[1:20:00] How many believe that?
[1:20:04] Amen. I'm going to go there while I'm
[1:20:06] thinking about it. our young
[1:20:09] people as they get up to 14 to 19, 20,
[1:20:14] 21, we know that they're that is a
[1:20:17] crucial time for
[1:20:19] them. Most likely they're going to
[1:20:21] decide whether they serve God or whether
[1:20:23] they don't during that time. Amen.
[1:20:25] They'll make some big decisions and it's
[1:20:27] so important that we influence and I'm
[1:20:30] keeping them around the right thing.
[1:20:33] Amen. Amen. Young people, they have
[1:20:36] needs. Amen. When you get 18 years old,
[1:20:39] don't be thinking about no boyfriend and
[1:20:41] husband at 15, 16. Don't worry about all
[1:20:43] that. Get old enough first.
[1:20:47] But you'll get to the age where you'll
[1:20:49] want a
[1:20:51] wife. Amen.
[1:20:54] We'll have young We got young boys that
[1:20:56] no doubt they'll need a
[1:20:58] wife. Amen.
[1:21:02] What was it brother Ram said about it?
[1:21:04] He says, "You know, a woman might be
[1:21:06] just ugly as what you can think of."
[1:21:09] Huh? I don't know just how he described
[1:21:11] it, but she could be just pretty
[1:21:14] ugly. But if she's a real genuine
[1:21:17] Christian, and if you're any kind of a
[1:21:19] man of God, you'll respect that woman.
[1:21:25] Amen.
[1:21:27] maybe a woman or a lady looking for a
[1:21:30] man. And man, let me tell you something.
[1:21:32] The girls, they don't always have to be
[1:21:34] the
[1:21:38] prettiest. The young boys, they don't
[1:21:40] have to be the
[1:21:43] handsomest. What's
[1:21:45] important is their character.
[1:21:49] What did brother B says, you know, this
[1:21:50] one girl ran off with this boy? The boy
[1:21:53] go outside in church and wait for her
[1:21:55] girl to go to church and get her pick
[1:21:57] pick her up after church. Wouldn't even
[1:22:00] come in.
[1:22:03] You get a boy like that. You go out
[1:22:06] there parents. The parents will be going
[1:22:08] out there, won't they? We know the
[1:22:10] people at evening that go. That girl
[1:22:13] won't even get a chance to go out there
[1:22:14] and tell that boy to get lost.
[1:22:17] Mom and dad be all over it. You going
[1:22:20] home
[1:22:21] now.
[1:22:22] before I pull you out of that car and
[1:22:24] stick you on after you're right
[1:22:30] there. That's right. And something or
[1:22:33] other Bam says, you know, I really like
[1:22:35] him because he smells so
[1:22:38] good and he's got cute
[1:22:42] feet. That's what he said. Got cute
[1:22:46] feet. Boy, Brother Bam didn't have much
[1:22:48] fort. I would rather, you know, a girl,
[1:22:52] you'd be better off having a boy that
[1:22:54] smells like a pole cat.
[1:22:59] Woo. And had feet like a box car.
[1:23:04] I'm going to add a little. Maybe he's
[1:23:06] got a crooked
[1:23:07] nose. Maybe got crooked teeth. Huh? But
[1:23:12] he loves the Lord. He's in church when
[1:23:15] church is open. He loves the Lord. His
[1:23:18] beauty. That girl's beauty, that boy's
[1:23:20] handsomeness, it'll fade. It'll go away.
[1:23:24] But that character in there, it'll stick
[1:23:26] with you through thick, through thin.
[1:23:28] It'll love you. It'll treat you
[1:23:32] right. That's what you want.
[1:23:35] Something that'll treat you right. Treat
[1:23:37] like Christ does the church. Husband,
[1:23:39] love your wives even as Christ loves the
[1:23:42] church. Gave himself for it that he
[1:23:44] might sanctify it.
[1:23:46] making it clear that she might with be
[1:23:48] without spot and without with wrinkle.
[1:23:50] Ain't that right? How many knows that's
[1:23:52] relationship that you and I have with
[1:23:54] God? It's like a husband
[1:23:56] relationship. A man that cares about his
[1:23:59] wife. Every detail about his
[1:24:04] wife.
[1:24:06] Amen. You my wife sitting on the
[1:24:09] porch. We have a lot of sitting on the
[1:24:11] porch stories, don't we? He's talking
[1:24:14] about how
[1:24:16] that Sapora Moses's wife was hotheaded.
[1:24:20] Is that right? But Bam, she had a and
[1:24:24] how that brother Bam said God knew just
[1:24:26] what Moses
[1:24:30] needed. You got a hoted wife? Well,
[1:24:33] guess what? God knew what you
[1:24:38] needed. Let's hope nobody got a
[1:24:40] hotheaded wife.
[1:24:43] Why? Most probably to mellow you down a
[1:24:46] little bit.
[1:24:48] Come on,
[1:24:53] people. Teach, you can't run off into
[1:24:55] the bushes and hide on top of the house
[1:24:57] or somewhere. You're going to have to
[1:24:59] get back in the house. You're going to
[1:25:00] have to get things straightened
[1:25:04] out. Amen. That's right. Don't think
[1:25:08] marriage ain't work. Marriage is work.
[1:25:11] It can be hard. It's something that you
[1:25:13] got to work at and you got to learn.
[1:25:15] Yeah, that's right. You got to learn not
[1:25:16] to be selfish.
[1:25:19] If you need if you need patience and you
[1:25:21] need to learn to not be selfish, get
[1:25:23] married.
[1:25:25] Hey, when you're single, you can go do
[1:25:27] what you want, when you want, how you
[1:25:30] want. But when you get a wife, hey,
[1:25:32] where you
[1:25:34] going? Can I go with you? I want to go
[1:25:37] with you. And I want to go over here for
[1:25:39] Oh,
[1:25:43] man. And over there for
[1:25:47] what? Yeah, that's right. You'll learn
[1:25:51] to say, "Okay, honey. I think we've got
[1:25:52] We'll make
[1:25:55] time. We'll make one. We'll make time."
[1:26:00] That's right. You might fuss a little
[1:26:02] this, that, or the other, but get that
[1:26:04] all done out of the way. when you get
[1:26:05] back to the house, she'll give you a
[1:26:08] good hug. Say, "Honey, you're the best.
[1:26:10] I love you." And you'll have a good
[1:26:12] marriage. But try it the other way for a
[1:26:15] little while. Cuz remember, the Bible
[1:26:18] said that husbands are to love their
[1:26:20] wives even as their own bodies. How many
[1:26:23] knows that that's the relationship? He
[1:26:25] says, "I speak towards Christ in the
[1:26:26] church." God loves us like he loves
[1:26:29] himself. Hello.
[1:26:32] And that's pretty much Amen.
[1:26:36] Hallelujah. So, there's another need.
[1:26:38] How many knows God knows you need? Just
[1:26:40] another thought that I had, you know.
[1:26:41] And so, well, I ain't getting no
[1:26:44] husband. I'm almost 19 years old and I
[1:26:47] ain't married. Come on. We used to wait
[1:26:51] a little bit longer than that, I guess.
[1:26:53] But why don't you pray a little harder?
[1:26:58] Amen. How many know God knows what you
[1:27:00] have need of.
[1:27:04] and be open for what God has for you.
[1:27:08] Some people are not married at 50
[1:27:11] because that girl had to be just
[1:27:12] perfect.
[1:27:14] That boy had to just be perfect and he
[1:27:16] never did get married.
[1:27:21] Can I say something? All right, I will.
[1:27:23] Thank you very much.
[1:27:26] God knows just exactly who you're
[1:27:29] supposed to be with.
[1:27:32] And you need to have your heart and mind
[1:27:34] open. A mean that right
[1:27:38] and let God do the work. I want to say
[1:27:41] something else. Thank you very much. A
[1:27:44] girl or a boy is a whole lot better off
[1:27:49] single. You're better off single than
[1:27:52] with the wrong one.
[1:27:54] If you marry a woman that is a runaround
[1:27:57] or can't be trusted or hello runs off
[1:28:01] with another man, it's water in your
[1:28:04] blood. I've never had water in my blood,
[1:28:07] but I'm sure that it doesn't work too
[1:28:09] good. It's miserable. No doubt.
[1:28:13] Amen. Or a husband that don't treat you
[1:28:16] right, don't love
[1:28:17] you, better off without one. You'll be
[1:28:20] happier laying on the bed and going
[1:28:22] doing things by yourself than you with
[1:28:24] somebody yelling and screaming at you
[1:28:25] all the time. Hello. Not doing getting
[1:28:29] along. That's all free.
[1:28:32] Amen.
[1:28:35] Committed to the Lord. Wait on
[1:28:38] God and let God put it together. I'm
[1:28:41] thankful for the young couples we have
[1:28:42] here tonight. Amen.
[1:28:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:46] That's right.
[1:28:50] Amen. He's all I need. He's all I need.
[1:28:53] Praise God. Let's look at something
[1:28:57] here. Let's look at the Leodysa
[1:29:00] condition. All
[1:29:02] right. We know that in the Leodysia
[1:29:04] church
[1:29:06] age, they were
[1:29:08] rich, they were increased with
[1:29:10] goods, and they had meat of nothing.
[1:29:16] You realize that's what happens a lot of
[1:29:18] times. Even Jesus said it back in the
[1:29:21] Old Testament. Oh, watch out. When you
[1:29:23] got your houses and you got all of this,
[1:29:26] you've got all what you feel you've got
[1:29:28] your needs supplied.
[1:29:31] Well, I don't think I I'm just too busy.
[1:29:34] I, you know, I've got too much to do to
[1:29:35] go to church.
[1:29:40] Uh oh. Don't you know God sees and hears
[1:29:42] that? When you say you ain't got time to
[1:29:45] go, God hears that.
[1:29:48] He's given you. I mean, knows every one
[1:29:50] of us.
[1:29:52] Maybe not you, but definitely me. I know
[1:29:54] everything I have, the Lord has given
[1:29:56] me. I can't credit anything to myself.
[1:30:00] No, God has given it to me.
[1:30:06] Amen. And I know you clap because you
[1:30:08] know that's you, too. A lot of us have
[1:30:10] been to the bottom. We've went to the
[1:30:11] top and dropped to the bottom and God
[1:30:13] brought us up again several times. Amen.
[1:30:19] My much could be said there in way of
[1:30:21] personal testimony. Amen. It's what God
[1:30:25] does. But then you can slack off. No,
[1:30:28] that's not what you're to do. The more
[1:30:31] he pours out his blessing, the more
[1:30:33] you're supposed to pour out your praise.
[1:30:36] Amen.
[1:30:38] Amen.
[1:30:40] But these layers here, they said they
[1:30:42] were rich, they were increased with
[1:30:44] goods, had need of nothing that they
[1:30:47] come to the place that they didn't need
[1:30:53] anything. And let me tell you
[1:30:56] something. I'm trying to get to that
[1:31:01] place. I'm trying to get to the place,
[1:31:03] Brother Brad, where I don't need
[1:31:04] nothing.
[1:31:10] I've got a quiz question for you.
[1:31:15] When will you get to the place you don't
[1:31:18] need nothing? When will I get to the
[1:31:20] place where you don't need
[1:31:24] nothing? See, when you need something,
[1:31:27] you're lacking something.
[1:31:31] Even Nebuchadnezzar was found wanting.
[1:31:32] He was found nap needing.
[1:31:36] lacking.
[1:31:37] Hello.
[1:31:40] Lacking. And I can tell you this, it
[1:31:44] won't be on this side.
[1:31:46] No. When I get to heaven. When I get to
[1:31:50] heaven, I won't need nothing. Why?
[1:31:53] Because I'll have what I've been wanting
[1:31:55] all my life.
[1:31:57] Brother Ben says up there, it's not a
[1:32:00] pretty good day or kind of a good day or
[1:32:02] a good day of wonder. No, it's perfect.
[1:32:04] He says it's greater than perfect beyond
[1:32:08] English vocabulary. You have arrived.
[1:32:11] And the less were saying that they had
[1:32:14] arrived. They had not arrived. They were
[1:32:16] miserable, poor, wretched, naked, and
[1:32:19] blind and without the
[1:32:22] knowledge of being in that condition.
[1:32:27] Now, how many know better Brandon even
[1:32:28] said he says that was the worst part.
[1:32:30] The worst part is being in that
[1:32:32] condition and not knowing it.
[1:32:40] Maybe maybe we would
[1:32:43] uh dementia. Maybe we would talk about
[1:32:46] somebody that has dementia or something
[1:32:48] and they're out there running the
[1:32:50] streets naked, cut up, bleeding,
[1:32:53] completely stripped
[1:32:55] naked, and somebody comes up to you and
[1:32:57] says, "Hey, don't you know you're naked?
[1:32:59] Don't you know you're don't have any
[1:33:00] clothes on?
[1:33:02] What? I got clothes
[1:33:07] on. Maybe they're in Elton. Where are
[1:33:10] you at? In
[1:33:13] Hopkinsville,
[1:33:15] huh? Maybe there's some They don't know
[1:33:17] where they are. They don't realize
[1:33:19] they're in that condition.
[1:33:21] That was Leosa
[1:33:24] and don't know it.
[1:33:27] What a terrible place to be.
[1:33:31] Another thought I had on this not
[1:33:34] needing
[1:33:35] anything. In other words, they've come
[1:33:37] to that place of
[1:33:40] perfection. Now, how many knows in the
[1:33:42] stature of a perfect man, we're working
[1:33:45] towards that stature of a perfect man?
[1:33:47] We want to become more perfect and more
[1:33:49] perfect and more perfect. We want to get
[1:33:51] rid of all of our flaws. We want to come
[1:33:53] into the full stature of Christ. How
[1:33:56] many's with me? This is to us Christians
[1:33:59] who have walked however long we've
[1:34:00] walked. We still realize that we're not
[1:34:03] there yet. Even Paul said, "I haven't
[1:34:05] come to that place yet. I'm not what I
[1:34:08] used to be. I'm not what I want to be.
[1:34:11] I'm still progressing. I'm still working
[1:34:14] on it. But I I don't care how close we
[1:34:17] get to God. I don't care if you'd be the
[1:34:19] prophet of God." He was as close as
[1:34:20] anybody was. But he even said that
[1:34:23] perfection is not on this side. Cuz as
[1:34:26] long as you're in this body,
[1:34:29] you'll make mistakes.
[1:34:31] Amen. So when you get that perfect body,
[1:34:34] you'll have arrived.
[1:34:36] You won't need anything
[1:34:38] anymore. Cuz in heaven, you're not a
[1:34:40] needy person.
[1:34:42] You have everything the way that it's
[1:34:45] supposed to be.
[1:34:48] Amen. Praise the Lord. But they had come
[1:34:52] to the place that they thought they
[1:34:54] didn't
[1:34:55] need anything. Praise the
[1:35:04] Lord.
[1:35:06] Now, for the next 15 minutes, if I
[1:35:08] could, I want to take this old thought,
[1:35:10] and I know one of the brothers preached
[1:35:11] on this, and I don't just copy off of
[1:35:13] them or anything, but the Lord brought
[1:35:15] this into the thought, and I trust it'll
[1:35:18] be a blessing to you. But I want to talk
[1:35:19] to you a little bit
[1:35:25] about having the answer to the devil's
[1:35:27] question. Amen. Because how many know so
[1:35:31] many times questions comes up and there
[1:35:35] has to be an answer for
[1:35:37] it. A lot of times it'll
[1:35:41] be a football game, it'll be sports.
[1:35:46] One game, one team will score a
[1:35:50] touchdown and the other
[1:35:53] team will have the ball kicked to
[1:35:57] them and that
[1:36:00] uh whoever takes it
[1:36:02] back. The guy gets the ball to take it
[1:36:05] back somehow goes all the way back. And
[1:36:09] they might say, "Well, they come back
[1:36:11] and they
[1:36:12] answered. This is their comeback. This
[1:36:14] is how they answered. This is how they
[1:36:16] answer to it. Isn't that
[1:36:18] right? Could be
[1:36:20] a fight. Could be Muhammad Ali. Could be
[1:36:24] Mike Tyson and his
[1:36:26] uppercut. Ain't that right? And he's
[1:36:30] going to take you down. He took the
[1:36:31] biggest and the best down with his
[1:36:33] uppercut. He was deadly. Ain't that
[1:36:36] right? People flapped their lip and jaws
[1:36:39] and all kinds of stuff, but landed on
[1:36:41] the carpet. Ain't that right?
[1:36:44] And there had to be there had to be an
[1:36:46] answer for it. We might say, you know,
[1:36:50] if somebody's going to defeat him, they
[1:36:52] learn to block, they answer that
[1:36:55] undercut with a
[1:36:57] block and straightforward,
[1:37:01] right? How did you beat him? What was
[1:37:04] your answer? Ain't that right?
[1:37:08] And so many times the devil has
[1:37:11] come and he does
[1:37:14] things. I'm going to take my wife first
[1:37:16] before we even go into Bibles, Bible,
[1:37:18] Bible
[1:37:20] examples many
[1:37:23] times because how many knows we have a
[1:37:25] need for an answer? There has to be an
[1:37:28] answer. When she was diagnosed, they
[1:37:31] said what they said that you are going
[1:37:33] to die with
[1:37:34] this. We had a testimony meeting. so to
[1:37:37] speak at the hospital there. Everything
[1:37:39] was
[1:37:40] negative. But what was her answer? What
[1:37:44] did she come back with? My testimony. My
[1:37:48] testimony is not to die. But it's Isaiah
[1:37:51] 53.
[1:37:53] He was wounded for my transgression,
[1:37:55] bruised for my iniquity. The
[1:37:57] chastisement of my peace was upon him.
[1:38:00] And by his stripes, I am
[1:38:03] healed. That's what I'm coming back
[1:38:05] with.
[1:38:10] Hallelujah. The devil said, "Daniel,
[1:38:12] what are you going to do? They're going
[1:38:14] to throw you in the lion's den." Because
[1:38:16] they did not like you praying up in that
[1:38:19] window. How many know what the devil
[1:38:21] didn't like? And they come up with a
[1:38:22] law. Nobody prayed to no other god than
[1:38:24] this other one. No prayer. Hello. And he
[1:38:28] prayed
[1:38:29] anyway. And he was heading. I call it
[1:38:33] the answer to dead ends.
[1:38:37] the answer to dead ends. God brings us
[1:38:39] to dead ends sometimes. And he brought
[1:38:42] him right into the face, right on the
[1:38:45] wall, and then over the wall.
[1:38:49] I don't know how far down it was, but
[1:38:51] over the wall he went. He went down. He
[1:38:53] went in the lion's den.
[1:38:58] The next morning, he says, "Your God is
[1:39:00] able to deliver you." How did he do it?
[1:39:02] He said he brought the pillar of fire
[1:39:04] down in there. Amen. And protected him.
[1:39:06] God answered.
[1:39:08] [Applause]
[1:39:10] He supplied. He has need.
[1:39:13] He didn't know which way to go. That's
[1:39:15] why we love the song. He's a
[1:39:18] way. Oh, he loves to do that. Makes a
[1:39:22] way. When you need a way, he makes a
[1:39:24] way. Aren't you glad?
[1:39:28] I think we should say this. When you It
[1:39:30] don't matter. We're facing a lion or if
[1:39:33] we're hitting hitting straight for the
[1:39:35] fiery furnace.
[1:39:37] Hello. Straight for it. No side turn.
[1:39:41] Straight for the fiery furnace. And in
[1:39:44] the fiery furnace they went. What was
[1:39:47] God's answer? He took the heat out of
[1:39:50] the fire.
[1:39:51] [Laughter]
[1:39:54] I can't imagine having a torch up here
[1:39:56] and putting that torch to my
[1:39:58] hand. Huh?
[1:40:01] Just let's get bigger. Let's get a
[1:40:04] little bigger, Brother Caleb. Get you a
[1:40:06] big old flamethrower. Come up. Just
[1:40:08] flamethrow
[1:40:10] me.
[1:40:12] Huh? And I just stand and say, "Wow,
[1:40:15] it's not even warm. I'm at the same
[1:40:17] temperature I was before." But there's
[1:40:20] flames everywhere. I mean, know God can
[1:40:23] take the heat out of the flames.
[1:40:26] Thank you, Lord. Glory.
[1:40:30] Why? Cuz he's a way maker. When you have
[1:40:32] a need, he will supply your need. When
[1:40:36] Paul was in prison and he had a need to
[1:40:38] get out, how many knows God supplied him
[1:40:42] with his what he had need of? The jail
[1:40:45] shook and uh angels came and opened the
[1:40:48] door. Jehoshaphat, I believe it was,
[1:40:51] wasn't it? Jehoshaphat that was
[1:40:53] surrounded by a military and they said,
[1:40:55] "Don't you stand. Don't trust in your
[1:40:57] gods." None of the other gods were able
[1:40:58] to deliver them people. Your God is not
[1:41:01] able going to be able to deliver you. He
[1:41:02] went and he
[1:41:05] dreaded and that night I don't know 80
[1:41:07] some thousand soldiers died again. 280
[1:41:11] huge number of soldiers were killed. God
[1:41:14] come down in the camp and killed all the
[1:41:17] enemy.
[1:41:18] How many knows God always answers? Amen.
[1:41:22] All of God's children has had the the
[1:41:26] answer to the devil's question. And what
[1:41:28] is that answer? Jesus. That answer is
[1:41:33] God.
[1:41:35] How many believes Jesus is the answer?
[1:41:39] And if you've got Jesus, he will make a
[1:41:41] way. He will supply your need, no matter
[1:41:47] what it is.
[1:41:51] Amen. Well, praise the Lord. All right,
[1:41:54] I got two more pages, but we're going to
[1:41:56] do that Sunday, I guess, because we sure
[1:41:58] won't get through tonight. But I don't
[1:42:00] know about you, I just love to go
[1:42:02] through this. Don't you just look at
[1:42:04] Turn your eyes on Jesus. Look full in
[1:42:07] his wonderful face. Amen.
[1:42:09] I don't know what kind of worries I
[1:42:11] don't know what kind of problems you had
[1:42:12] at your job today.
[1:42:16] But I'll tell you this. When I got up
[1:42:19] this morning, I thought, "Hey, this is
[1:42:20] Wednesday. Hey, we get to go to church.
[1:42:24] We get to go praise the Lord. We get to
[1:42:26] go talk about his word and and talk
[1:42:28] about God."
[1:42:31] How many likes when going to church has
[1:42:33] the right feeling in your heart? How
[1:42:36] many believes it needs to have the right
[1:42:37] feeling in your heart?
[1:42:39] Amen. Cuz too many times, folks, we've
[1:42:42] gotten too wrapped up with the rich and
[1:42:45] increase with good things.
[1:42:48] Amen. And down in our heart, oh yeah. Oh
[1:42:50] yeah, that's right. I'm going to have to
[1:42:51] go tonight. No, let's not think like
[1:42:54] that.
[1:42:55] Let's keep pressing on.
[1:43:00] Amen. All
[1:43:02] right. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:05] I
[1:43:06] think what we're going to start with
[1:43:08] Sunday
[1:43:09] is the devil
[1:43:13] asks this layout that we're living
[1:43:17] in every trap and every snare that's set
[1:43:20] for
[1:43:22] you. Everything that's
[1:43:26] set and we'll start Wednesday, I mean
[1:43:29] Sunday. It wouldn't be right to make you
[1:43:32] lukewarm.
[1:43:35] How are you going to get How are you
[1:43:37] going to escape it? How are you going to
[1:43:39] get out of
[1:43:41] this? How are you going to get out of
[1:43:43] this? And I'm here to tell
[1:43:47] you, I'm here to tell you like Joshua
[1:43:49] did, we're more than able.
[1:43:53] We're more than able to get out of this
[1:43:56] out of here. We're more than
[1:43:59] able. Amen. And we'll talk about that
[1:44:02] again Sunday. More than able to do it.
[1:44:06] Why? Because you ain't got a worry in
[1:44:08] the world. Even the prophet said, "You
[1:44:11] haven't got a worry in the world when
[1:44:14] Christ is your God. When he is in here,
[1:44:17] you have everything that you have need
[1:44:20] of in this life's journey because he's
[1:44:22] going to supply you with whatever you
[1:44:24] have need of. You've got the supplier.
[1:44:29] Amen. You might be a builder. KC Mills,
[1:44:32] let's just say they have the lumber.
[1:44:34] They have everything. They don't, but
[1:44:36] just some lumber company that has
[1:44:38] everything that you need to build the
[1:44:40] house. Hello. You just have to go to
[1:44:43] that one place and get what you need.
[1:44:45] That's the way Christ is. Everything you
[1:44:47] have need of to be a Christian is in
[1:44:50] Christ. All you got to do is come to
[1:44:54] Christ. He has everything you have need.
[1:44:58] And I don't know about you, but I know
[1:44:59] that we need to be more like Jesus. We
[1:45:02] need to be We want to We want to be
[1:45:04] perfect, don't we? We don't want to
[1:45:06] lack. We don't want to need have a need
[1:45:08] of the character of Jesus. Hello.
[1:45:11] Because the five-fold ministry is for
[1:45:13] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[1:45:15] we come to that stature of the perfect
[1:45:17] man. Amen. Till we come into the perfect
[1:45:20] image of Jesus. That's what we have need
[1:45:23] of. And Paul said, "I travail in birth.
[1:45:26] I travail until Christ is formed in you.
[1:45:31] Even Paul had a need. I'm going to close
[1:45:33] with this.
[1:45:35] But while we are satisfied because we
[1:45:40] have Christ. Hello.
[1:45:42] While we're completely satisfied that
[1:45:45] because we have Christ, there is still
[1:45:49] a portion of us that's not satisfied. In
[1:45:52] another way, we're not satisfied. Ain't
[1:45:54] that right? That's right.
[1:45:56] Because even Paul said, "We who have the
[1:45:59] first fruits of the spirit do groan."
[1:46:02] Ain't that right? We're groaning to be
[1:46:04] clothed upon. Amen. Until, you know, the
[1:46:08] sons of God are manifested. Until we get
[1:46:10] raptured and the earnest expectation of
[1:46:14] the creature is changed.
[1:46:18] No. How can we be satisfied in this
[1:46:21] world? That's right. No, we won't be
[1:46:24] satisfied until we meet him in the air.
[1:46:27] I was thinking today, you know, brother
[1:46:28] Bam said that when the rapture take
[1:46:30] place that Paul's group will come up and
[1:46:32] they'll come up like a parade, come up
[1:46:34] there to meet the Lord in the sky. Then
[1:46:36] Ireneius's group will come up and
[1:46:38] they'll go
[1:46:41] up and then Columba and then Luther then
[1:46:44] Wesley and all of all the saints. How
[1:46:47] many believe this is not some fiction
[1:46:49] story? One of these days in our near
[1:46:52] future that's going to happen. And then
[1:46:54] he says we'll fall in line and we'll go
[1:46:56] up to and all the saints of all the ages
[1:46:59] shall be with them. Then we'll be where
[1:47:02] we want to
[1:47:03] be. Then we won't have no need anymore.
[1:47:07] Hallelujah. Then we'll be completely
[1:47:09] satisfied because we are with him. But
[1:47:12] until there's still a need, there's
[1:47:13] still a dissatisfaction because we want
[1:47:16] more. Even in our lives, I meant to
[1:47:19] stop, but even in our lives, how many
[1:47:21] knows we sing the song, I want more of
[1:47:25] Jesus, more and more and more. I want
[1:47:29] more of Jesus than I ever had before.
[1:47:32] Aren't you glad that you've got a need
[1:47:34] of having more of God? Why? Because that
[1:47:37] means there's more of God to be had.
[1:47:41] Amen. Praise be to God.
[1:47:46] Thank you, Lord
[1:47:47] Jesus. Here they
[1:47:50] are. That's what happens when you don't
[1:47:52] have three pair up here. Amen. God bless
[1:47:55] you tonight. I hope that was good. Do
[1:47:56] you enjoy the word? Stand. We'll sing a
[1:47:59] couple songs, brother. Turn it over to
[1:48:01] brother Joshua. Amen. Appreciate his
[1:48:05] labor of love and song. Amen.
[1:48:08] Amen. Let's bow our heads and talk to
[1:48:11] the author.
[1:48:13] Lord Jesus, as we come to the close of
[1:48:15] the ministering of the
[1:48:16] word, as we have
[1:48:18] looked at your word and father, how that
[1:48:21] you, no matter what the conditions of
[1:48:24] your children was anywhere, you truly
[1:48:27] did what Paul said, that you always take
[1:48:31] care of your children. You always
[1:48:33] provide them with what they have need
[1:48:34] of. We've heard the phrase that God
[1:48:39] supplies supreme grace for the supreme
[1:48:42] hour. You always take care of what we
[1:48:47] have need of,
[1:48:48] Lord. Whether it's by the Red Sea,
[1:48:50] whether it's little things in our lives,
[1:48:52] whether it's our young people, whatever
[1:48:54] it is, you know their need. And we ask
[1:48:58] God that we would completely trust in
[1:48:59] you, Father, and put our faith in you,
[1:49:01] Lord. Knowing God, that if we do come to
[1:49:04] dead ends, if we come to hard places, it
[1:49:07] doesn't shake us because, God, we have
[1:49:08] need of a rock and we got anchored in
[1:49:11] that rock of ages, which was you,
[1:49:13] Lord, that we've learned to trust in
[1:49:16] you, Father. For you are our provided
