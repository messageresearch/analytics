say that Lord willing you know whatever cuz God has different plans in us and God can change our plans right but you have a beautiful church here uh physically but more importantly a spiritual church with the beauty of Christ's character brother Bram says that's what a real church is that's beautiful she has the character of Christ Jesus Hallelujah You Love to Worship You Love To Say Amen to the word you will respond to the word of God you'll obey the word of God that's what makes a Christian have a real Christlike character someone that can obey the word of God hallelujah so God richly bless each and every one here uh thank you for the the love and the kindness from this church I'm I'm already blessed by it it brings me to tears um but I so thank God for the holy spirit that I feel here today by God's grace and all weekend Psalms 149 verse1 let me get there in my Bible here by God's grace I'd like to preach this morning uh I preached a eight-part series at our home church last year uh 2023 called Praise Jesus's name in the dance so I'd like to preach just a a short summary of that here uh I trust you'll be blessed I preach at other places in each place I preached it uh the Lord really blessed it with his presence praise God and so that's what we want we want God's presence to be with us today hallelujah praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of the Saints so this is the place right here to praise the Lord let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King so after to remember God Made You To Praise Him that's part of the reason he made you so you'd come to church and you say praise the Lord You're fulfilling God's purpose when you say praise the Lord Jesus amen verse three let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timberl in the harp wow so blessed whoever was playing the tambourine this morning morning I was like Hallelujah you're under the right anointing Hallelujah and the song leader sang all those right songs I thought I thought the Holy Ghost is here amen hallelujah he's going to be well pleased with our worship today verse four for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation see what makes you beautiful when you've received his salvation that's beautiful in God's sight you're not under the power of Darkness you're under the power of light verse 5 let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let's have one more word of prayer father God just take this word now Lord and help me to step aside Lord Jesus this is your church really this is your people this is your Earth this is your bride so father God just have your way this morning I yield to you Lord and may each person yield to the Holy Spirit we're thankful for these verses we're thankful that you created us for your pleasure and we only want to do that we only want to live for your pleasure God may we please you this morning in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God one of the brothers helped me on my uh my dates last night when I was talking about how my daughter was you know writing prayer requests for that brother that got saved she was only two or three years old Caris and she would raise her hand at our church I'll say now who has a public prayer request and my daughter was two or three years old Caris and she'd say pray for brother Austin to come back cuz she couldn't write yet so we talked about that and then as she got older you know almost every service her little hand would go up pray for brother Austin to come back and God heard a three-year-old's Prayer by God's grace church it don't matter what age you are Hallelujah God uh God is glorified God hears your prayers and and God God is faithful Hallelujah God wants him himself to be real to the littlest child amen and to the the most uh mature Elder we'd say right the most mature message believer God wants to be just as real to the most mature message believer as the most humble little child because Jesus said you got to become like a child to enter in the kingdom of God hallelujah so I'm going to try not to look at the clock you know I got I got a long drive back tonight by God's grace I think it's seven hours in 20 minutes that's without stops and we got some events we got to take care of but we'll trust the lord to bless BL today Hallelujah so the word uh praise here uh means to make a boast about accomplishments so in the Hebrew when it says praise His name it means boast on God's accomplishments so see when we know we're praising God when we're saying look what God did not what I did look what God did that's really praising God hallelujah and then uh name means reputation fame or glor Glory Hallelujah so we're we're we're boasting on we're praising boasting on God's accomplishments for his Fame to make him more famous to make him receive more Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah and of course you know Jehovah uh means the existing one so Lord God you know praise the name of the Lord God Lord God means Jehovah Elohim or the existing one or the strong one Hallelujah so we praise him and then the Bible said Praise Him in the the dance now uh in Psalm chapter 150 verse1 it says praise ye the Lord praise God in the sanctuary Praise Him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty ex Praise Him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the Sury in the harp praise him with the timberl and dance praise him he says with string instruments and organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols Praise Him upon the high sounding symbols let everything that ha breath praise the Lord Praise ye the Lord amen but I I love these chapters these these two chapters are like twins you know like they just go together Hallelujah uh brother Ram said faith and grace are twins he said they're sisters because you can't have uh faith without grace and grace without faith amen you got to have both and uh so but it the Bible says let them praise His name in the dance in Psalm 149:3 let them so we have to look at uh something here you know uh we have to let them so that means let means allow we have to allow them to praise God with a dance right because someone's trying to forbid them from dancing who's trying to forbid people from praising God who's trying to forbid people from dancing for Jesus well I think we all know the answer to that Lucifer Satan that old serpent that Dragon Hallelujah right praise God s God's enemy right so we have to allow people to praise him in the dance because Satan wants to forbid us from worshiping God hallelujah but God commands it he says let them and then he says praise them he didn't say if you want to he said Praise Him in the dance so this is the holy spirit saying praise me with the dance praise me with the timberl praise me with the string instruments God wants us to praise Him hallelujah oh my scripture makes it clear that we are to boast on God's accomplishments and give more and boast on the fame of God and the word dance did you know this in the Hebrew the word dance means to twist or twirl so it doesn't mean what the world thinks it does it just means to twist your body or to twirl around like this just a Twist in a circle I looked up online and uh the Jews even the the the Jews today have all these they have three or four different dances that they do together and one of them is they just dance like this another one they join hands you know women with the women and they just dance in a circle like this and they're fulfilling what the Hebrew says the Hebrew says you're supposed to twist in a circle and give God glory the Bible commands it God said you're created for it Hallelujah God says I take pleasure when you do it so right here like like this God takes pleasure in me Dan I got plenty of room to dance up here amen hallelujah remember that one preacher said you ain't got enough room for me to preach up here there's plenty of room to dance and preach up here hallelujah thank God Amen we were created for this purpose let them allow them to praise God in the dance Hallelujah Satan is trying to stop your dance Satan's trying to stop your praise Hallelujah and so we've got to if you don't have your dance you've got to get it back if you've never had a dance you got to find it is that right you no you you're telling me Oh Brother Jess I can never you're telling me they could dance under the blood of bulls and goats that could never take away sin but you and I are the devil trying to makes us not dance when we have a perfect blood of a perfect lamb a perfect sacrifice that doesn't cover sin he abolishes sin he we got a bleach brother brand said a bleach that sends it back to Satan Hallelujah the bleach of the blood Hallelujah you're telling me they could dance under the blood of bulls and goats but we can't dance for the sinless Son of God who gave his life for us died on the cross and then he rose amen the Bible said he rose for our justification that means he declares you righteous as you wish to be Hallelujah I think you see where I'm going today by God's grace oh my when I first became a Christian I wasn't in the message I told you that story last night I was in a uh kind of like a mega church it's like a presbyterian Baptist Church and when I first got saved I was so happy on the inside I told you last night I threw away my ACDC my Snoop Dog uh my shanai Twain and Tim McGraw I threw all I had every kind of music I didn't I didn't discriminate I was sewn into sin but as soon as I went to church I wanted to praise God there was something brother Danny there was something in me bubbling I want to praise God but we were in a mega church that didn't really encourage it so I would look around and as long as somebody else was raising their hands I go like this now inside I wanted to go like hallelujah thank you Jesus you saved my soul I get to worship you but I was so nervous I was like this then the sh was over that's all the Liberty I had in denominations oh but when I come to this message brother amen I see brother Brooks playing the tamarine dancing all over and then I start dancing all over praise God and he whom the son has set free is free indeed hallelujah oh my amen glory you know there's all those churches God could have sent me to when I came in the message but God sent me to the Church of Isaiah Brooks all the freedom all the joy all the worship and brother BR brother Brooks's major was you better get the Holy Ghost you know he was around all these brothers that were arguing about Doctrine some of them have now fallen away from the message they were too busy worrying about Doctrine they never got the doctrine of you must be born again brother bandam said uh Jesus's first Doctrine was you must be born again Hallelujah yeah yes amen John chapter 3 and brother Brooks knew that he said these brother and brother Brooks came to our church in 2007 and he said you watch this PR preacher he's going to fall away and he fell away eight years later because that preacher walked up to brother Brooks he said you know I don't like how you use your tambourine he said you're get you're working them up into some type of a uh emotional affair and brother Brook said he just turned away and said you you grieve the Holy Ghost yeah but brother Brooks just went on he kept playing a tambourine I'm going to preach out for him a couple weeks there I'm going out to see my former Pastor by God's grace he ordained me to preach but that's what I love he brought people he created the atmosphere Hallelujah he created the atmosphere where other people could join in and be free god brother B said God didn't call us to be wall flowers God didn't call you just to be like a you know part of this texture here or like the B God didn't call you to do that just stand there and do nothing God called you to raise your your hands God called you to clap your hands God called you to sing God called some of you to dance amen but man said don't be a Wallflower when you come to church he said get in the spirit of it Hallelujah if somebody else shouts you shout amen hallelujah hallelujah get in the spirit of it because you're going to be in some Spirit today you're going to be in one or the other Spirits praise God and we saw last night you might be in the bad Spirit but you can sure get out of it God has a Waters of Separation to separate you from any sin hallelujah oh my thank God God's done it for us hallelujah but notice Psalm 149 ver4 for the lord taketh pleasure in his people many verses say God created all things and for all these things they were created for God's pleasure Revelation 4:11 Colossians 1:16 and then Psalm 22 verse three says he inhabits the Praises of your people so friends when you come to church and you really brother R said you got to forget about everybody else there he said if you can forget about who's there and forget about who's looking at you I was so concerned who's watching me I'm I going to get out of order I I cared way too much and now I don't even care what people say about me they're going to say whatever they want to say praise God but I know God's watching me and I want God to say something good about me amen what does God think about me that's all that matters I don't care what anybody else says let them say what they want as long as Heaven loves me that's all that matters [Music] Hallelujah as long as I'm giving God pleasure I can live with that but I can't live with Wallflower or brother say a bump on a [Applause] pickle I don't want to be a bump on a pickle brother said how can you save your life and be a bump on a pickle I just don't want to be a little bump there brother man said I want to be a living moving Monument praise God I want to be a living moving member of the body of Jesus Christ amen ah I've been one Hallelujah you've been one we'll keep being one by the grace of God hallelujah now friends Romans 9:25 I don't think I gave this to the brother but Romans 9:25 said as he saith in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass and the place where it said unto them ye are not my people they shall be called the children of the Living God friends God has made us God cut off Israel to graft us into the holy tree we're living on the life of the Holy tree I am grafted in I'm living on the life of Jesus Christ and he calls me three things I'm his beloved his people and his child what else could I want my life other than to be beloved of God what else would I want I'm his I'm his I'm a sweetheart we're a sweetheart praise God that's what he's made us we we weren't that before how many remember when you weren't you you were a sinner how many still remember your life as a sinner Hallelujah we we weren't we were we were the Bible said we were far from the Covenant far from the promises but the blood of Jesus Christ has brought us nigh to these promises amen now we're the Beloved of God enjoying the blessings of This Promise that's Covenant to us hallelujah amen I want you to see what brother bam called dancing I'm just going to look at this for a moment brother Bram says this in basis of Fellowship 1961 I preached on this last night brother talking about a songwriter he said William cper was his name he said as soon as the inspiration left him he was there and he he wrote the song and when he was in such a high key where the people don't know nothing about it just to sing and shout and dance so you see that a man who write who writes songs or a woman who writes poems brother said they get lifted up in such a spot where they can sing and they can write songs and they can do all these things and dance he says that's in the spirit all right he said but it's the Spear of Joy do you catch that Spirit of Joy so for somebody to dance in the spirit they got to be empowered to do it if you're going to dance you need the spirit of dancing yeah brother said if they want the spirit of the world they got to play The Rock and Roll they got to play the rap they got to get under that Spirit they're getting under the Spear of Destruction for the tribulation we're getting under the spirit of the Rapture praise God Amen we're getting the spirit of joy and victory and promises and God's faithfulness Hallelujah you just got to get in the spirit of joy and brother said that produces dancing that produces songs that produces worship Hallelujah Exodus 15:20 and Miriam the prophetess the sister of Aaron took a timberl in her hand and all the women went out after her with timberl and dances this is the first recording of dancing if you start chronologically at the front of the Bible Miriam picks up a tambourine now why was she dancing Hallelujah she got the victory praise God they were being chased down by the world's greatest army they were cornered Moses cries out God would you do something he said speak the word hallelujah Don't Cry To Me Speak the word amen hallelujah and yet we what do we often do it just helps us out we always cry out to God too why why why God said speak the word son speak the word daughter just speak God's word hallelujah Hallelujah and then you know the story Moses stretches out the rod they all walk through on dry ground praise God and then once they get through Moses takes the rod down all the waters fall and all their past sins all their past uh C task Masters all the bondage and slavery was done for I've got no more slave masters amen I'm not a slave to anybody anymore no wonder and 85y old woman how old are you sister 75 she has awesome testimony you too by God's grace he was Glenn was blessing me with that testimony last night I was like Hallelujah man I'm more blessed for just coming here praise God she's 75 but an 85 year old woman saw all that and she said sisters follow me come on I'm 85 years old sisters come on an 85y old woman she wasn't some spring chicken now but she was so moved by the power of God that's the first time God recorded dancing Hallelujah and what does that symbolize that symbolizes you repenting of your sins oh that represents you getting baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and all your past sins have been buried in the sea of forgetfulness hallelujah oh my Hallelujah read 1 Corinthians 10 they were all baptized under Moses that represents the Waters of baptism how many been baptized here look at this you got a whole church of mirams in here amen hallelujah did that make you that happy when you got baptized it should have I said it should have yeah amen yeah that's right brother Glenn amen it should have because that's what the Bible says you're unreprovable without rebuking Colossians chapter 1 the Bible said forgiven all your trespasses you are forgiven all your trespasses I have an awful past I I did so many wicked things I wasn't raised in the message but when I read that verse I condemn because when I was baptized God forgave all of it praise God now I can twist now I can twirl for God's pleasure Hallelujah that's right amen Satan will try to remind me of that like they say remind him of his future that's he reminds me of my past I say oh let me remind you of your future Hallelujah that's right brother BR was a young Pastor you probably remember this he was doing a New Year's Eve service he said he preached uh three hours on the return of Jesus and he took a break about three hours or about half an hour and a half into it he was drawing the Rapture on a chalkboard remember this at brandom Tabernacle he sat down for an intermission some sisters got up there to play a special and they started playing there's going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet by and by and brother Ram said one of those censors had a thimble and she had a washboard and I did this at my church I brought a washboard in and a thimble okay talk about embarrassing myself I'll do anything for Jesus I don't care if God calls me to do it he'll back it up amen he said one of those girls started screaming and dancing and brother Bram said he said shame they're making my they're making my uh Church a Tavern he said now look at his attitude towards dancing he said I was surely against that stuff he said all the people in the church turned and looked at the pastor what are you going to do about it Pastor that's what brother Bram said he said you're turning my church into a Tavern we don't believe in such stuff as this but then he said the Holy Spirit told him where did that come from is that in the Bible that's a good question see you know the Holy Ghost is working on you when you ask you is that in the scripture what scripture have for that the church said Hallelujah and brother said that's right yes the first time they uh dance was when Miriam got the victory he said dance is Victory he said maybe I don't have enough Victory Hallelujah he said the problem is I'm sinting in the seat of the scornful and I don't have enough Victory Hallelujah come on so that sister started [Music] singing I'm trying to do this it was a thimble and a washboard in that sweet sweet by and by there's going to meet you and greet you over there in that home and brother said I started tapping my foot to it he said my Baptist foot I started tapping my Baptist foot before I knew it I was out there dancing with them Hallelujah Hallelujah I was out there praising the Lord and he said I guess I did all right he said I didn't look very good he said but I sure felt good what brother Jesse it's okay to feel good in church of course this is the house of God Amen that's what God wants us to do he wants us to feel good Hallelujah you know why cuz we're fighting a real devil out there and we got to feel good about the gospel if we're going to defeat that devil hallelujah what kind of solders is better one who who's mourning and sad all the time or somebody some Soldier who's happy he's got his AR there whatever he's got you know he's got his grenades and everything he's all happy he's singing he's ready to go you know the answer yeah the happy Soldier is the one who's ready to get the victory praise God live or die I'm fighting on the right team Hallelujah live or die I've got the joy of the Lord I'm in the Lord's army praise [Applause] God he said I sure didn't look good he said but I sure felt good he said he said I lived off that for a couple weeks see church that's where the devil's trying to rob some of us from how many want to feel good for a couple weeks Mercy some of us like to feel good just for two days right that's right brother said the same thing about the future home he said I lived on that for two weeks think about that you wake up one day future home next morning buy that future home Third Day future home that's what the word of God is supposed to do brother bar said it's a lifegiving resource the word of God is a lifegiving resource God wants you to have experiences so you can live on it and you can overcome the Gates of Hell the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you praise God so what do you need a revelation of true worship Hallelujah a revelation of who you are a't that beautiful brother mam said Miriam she had that Victory and he asked this question he said did you ever get that much that was brother Ram's question did you ever get that much Victory brother as Miriam now now it's getting serious did you ever get that much Victory like Miram where we could dance around the church oh I danced around numerous churches praise God you know why cuz I got the victory yeah that's right I sinned but Jesus Paid the price for my sins God doesn't look at me anymore God looks at me through the blood amen he's not looking at me he's looking at My Sacrifice he's looking at my savior amen hallelujah have you ever got that much victory where you dance around like Miriam with a tambourine and you praise the lord well I encourage you try to get it you'll live on it for weeks like brother Ram said it'll feel so good did you ever get it how many won it by God's grace oh you can get it today Hallelujah you musicians get ready here in about an hour or so you know by God's grace maybe an hour and a half brother I I got to lay it in there if if you see it through the scripture it's undeniable I preached eight sermons on this at our church by the end everybody's dancing all around praise God that's what I needed amen I need a church that dances around now we go through Seasons we go through battles but you know a few months later after preaching this you know it kind of died down the Holy Ghost dropped during the first song service before I even came out and I said Thank You Lord this is what I wanted I want a church that can get under the anointing they got Victory before the word was even preached hallelujah praise God Amen we're so full of Victory we're happy even before we hear the word and the word gives us Victory praise God oh my and you know what song it was that started it joy unspeakable and full of Glory they called me out there but I got out there I said let's sing joy unspeakable soon as I soon as we struck that one of the sisters screamed and shouted and they started doing a Jericho mark all around our tiny little Sanctuary you know how small it is hallelujah that's the freedom that's what God wants if brother was here he asked you did you ever get that much Victory before Oh gets quiet like that that's good think about it today might be your day to get that Victory where you don't care you don't care who's watching all you care is that God's watching Remember church this is a scriptural command Praise Him in the dance amen and what did it take on that first dance it took a humble 85y old woman so none of us can say well I couldn't do it uh you know I couldn't be the first one to get in the spirit if a 85 year old woman could get in the spirit surely you can amen and she didn't even have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul she just had an anointing on the spirit she doesn't even have what you got but we're supposed to have something greater amen Hallelujah we got something greater this is greater Hallelujah the blood of Jesus is greater I'm going to preach till my voice runs out today Amen brother BR said the only thing that mattered with me I just ain't got enough victory in a few minutes something happened he said this might shock you I came to myself I was out there with that little girl dancing out on the floor just a thing that I thought I wouldn't do I did I think God wants to anoint some of you so you do something you thought you never did but it's to get I like some of those Smiles out there I like that some of you start to open up to the word of God right we shut ourselves up so long I've got to be I've got to be in order uh but you don't even realize this is part of the order this is the order of Joy that's right this is the order of worship he said let them dance let them pray praise him you're just as much in order dancing as the people hitting these strings right here cuz it's the same chapter the Bible you're just as much order Hallelujah just the thing that I thought I wouldn't do I did brother I never thought I would dance over all around the churches I never thought that but God makes you do things you don't think you'll do to Humble you that's why he does it to give him glory and humble you [Music] I was never on a dance floor in all my life but I guess I did it all right how many wish they could have seen brother R dance do you know another time he told a story he got so under the anointing while preaching he sat on top of of the pulpit and swung his legs off the front preaching and then he said if this is okay he pulled up his his sleeve to about there he said he pulled it up for some reason look it up and he said why did I pull up my my my sleeve on my pants you think that's not very good church maners brother R said it was the Holy Ghost manners I was so lost in the spirit God will humble you that's what God's trying to do humble you of your pride Hallelujah you're so prideful and brother said stiff and starching I'm talking about me I'm talking about all of us praise God all of us message believers [Applause] amen you know we just want to obey the word we just want to be true uh we just want to be faithful we don't want to get deceived we don't want to be over emotional we don't want to be under emotional but here the Bible gives us there's anointings of Joy there's time to praise God that's what God wants hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah how many believe the message came to restore us the whole Bible well then why aren't people preaching about dancing that's that's in the Bible we've heard about the anointed ones the end time the godhead the water baptism all these Church ages Seven Seals All these great things what about dancing when is that going to be preached well right now is when it's going to be preached how many know God's timing is perfect so now we can see there's at least four or five reasons to dance I'm going to read them through you for the scriptures here the first is because you were baptized in the water baptism like Miriam was bapt AP ized in the Red Sea all your past is under the blood all the slavery of the past is under the blood you got a fresh start you're free in Jesus Christ Hallelujah the second is the one of the most well they're all awesome but 2 Samuel 6:14 and David danced before the Lord with some of his might now I'm just starting to sweat brother Thomas I'm just starting to sweat but David danced with all I haven't give all my might I've given some of my might I can jump pretty high for Jesus David dancing with all and and now here I just did this at our home church too if I'm going to dance with all my might I got to jump with all I got so David danc he jumped his high as he could dance not not some of his might the Bible said all of his might did you ever get that much Victory where you dance with all of your mind Hallelujah that's what Jesus is supposed to make you do sometimes get so happy so much joy you just give him praise and you dance Hallelujah and I know this pastor would agree to you dancing Hallelujah he's a real Holy Ghost filled man Hallelujah that's right there's a time and season for everything amen now you won't see see me dancing I had my identity stolen a few months ago you didn't see me dancing during that boy I was stressed out you ever have uh thousands of thousands of dollars ever vanish right before your eyes I was watching it vanish vanish I'm like oh God have mercy on me now thank God I got it all back except a little bit I'm still working on that by God's grace you know AT&T had a data leak a data leak right well brother Jesse was one of those man my stomach was in knots for months you got to reset all your passwords you got to call everybody you gotta you might have to reset your social security number all these things now thank God it didn't go that far but church when I got out of that I found a reason I found a new season this is a season to dance and rejoice it's just like David and zlac David had all that taken away but he got it all back Hallelujah and I'm going to dance I got most of it back I believe the rest is coming hallelujah praise God Amen I lost thousands and thousands but God gave it back he keeps giving it back I've got a Reason To Praise Him Hallelujah and Satan thought it was going to do the opposite he thought he was going to cut off my praise not forever no no no not forever Church Hallelujah we'll go through difficult times we'll go through mourning we'll go through uh uh Temptations sorely but God will restore our dance how many believe that Glory verse 16 and as the Ark of the Lord came in the city of David Michael Saw's daughter looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart brother raham said that was that was him Michael was despising uh David brother Ram said I was like Michael despising those sisters dancing but see Church you don't have to remain that way that's the beauty of the story a man who used to condemn dancing became the dancer the ones that used to make fun of the speakers and tongues you might become a speaker in tongues the one who used to make fun of Divine Healing you might receive Divine Healing oh my Hallelujah God loves to do that God loves to take people off the enemy's side and bring them to his side hallelujah [Applause] amen Oh Glory so this is the second reason the first reason you might have been B you baptized and you appreciate all that God has done for you forgave all your sins the second reason is brother tells us why David danced anybody remember David rejoiced and dance in the spere around and around and around why now notice around around and one more around twirling that's the Hebrew definition Church David danced around and around why brother ROM says he saw the word back in its place does anybody remember when the word was in its place where was the word in its place on Mount Mariah and Mount Zion before David H I guess we have to dig in the scripture to find that Ah that's right we go back to Genesis 14 yeah Genesis 14 when the word mezc met Abraham there in Jerusalem king of Salem king of Jerusalem oh it was about 890 or 900 years earlier the word was in its place Abraham met mzc right there in Jerusalem praise God and David recognizes it it's 900 years later and mzc is back but he's here in a different form he's here in the form of the Holy Ghost in the Ark of the Covenant carried on the shoulders near the the heart of the priest and David recognized the word is back Jesus Christ is back in his provided place of worship Hallelujah this was stunning to David remember even Joshua if you read Joshua 1563 even Joshua couldn't drive out the jebusites out of Jerusalem did you know that if you read it read in your Bible Joshua 1563 The jebusites couldn't drive I'm sorry the jebusites couldn't be driven out look Satan had taken a stake on that mountain that Holy Mountain why because that was God's Mountain great is the Lord and greatly to be praised the city of our God the mountain of his Holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth yeah is Mount Zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king Hallelujah so Satan refused to give that up through the jebusites Joshua tried they you know I'm sorry the people of Judah the Judah the Judah tribe couldn't drive them out think about that Joshua was a mighty conqueror but God saved it for David God saved uh the Holy Mountain being brought back by David because David was a type of Christ David was a prophet priest and king and the church said he was a prophet he wrote about God he prophesied of God he was a priest he put on the ephod he put on the ephod and he was dancing there before the Lord he was prophet priest and now he's anointed King it's a beautiful type of Jesus Christ is Prophet priest and King son of man Son of God Son of David hallelujah oh maybe that didn't strike you like it struck me so hope it was a blessing by God's grace so even 450 years after Joshua Jerusalem had never been taken until David took it remember they did it through the Waterway they did it through a secret passage underneath the city right and what what is it what is that that type all the secret things secret fasting secret prayers secret almsgiving how many know that gets a how many know that gets a reward from God when you fast pray and give alms in secret boy y'all really quiet on this one okay Hallelujah well that means you're thinking about it amen that's what my wife says she says I don't like when uh preachers say why aren't you say Amen she said I'm thinking about it I said well good that's what I want y'all to think about it amen so think about that am I praying in secret are you fasting in secret are you giving an alms in secret that's how the enemy's Camp is sacked Hallelujah that's how you defeat what seems to be like an insurmountable enemy it was insurmountable for 800 years Joshua couldn't get in there nobody could get in there but David got in there through the secret I think it was joab he crawled through that Waterway and they did a surprise attack and God and David made job uh the the leader of all the Mighty Men after that the leader of the arms forces because he went the secret Way Church Jesus said go in your closet and pray and brother Ram said that was part of the third poll brother R said what's that little tent mean and the angel said didn't our Lord say go pray in the closet and the church said how many want third pole power okay well now you know how to get it pray pray he said the angel is always scriptural that's what I love about this message amen the angel points us back to the Bible Hallelujah brother R's message points us back to the Bible Hallelujah Glory Glenn knows what I'm talking about amen hallelujah I was raised in church I I saw Miracles my mom was healed of cancer when I was 8 years old in in denominations Supernatural of cancer I'd seen Miracles our church had speaking in tongues but I never seen anything like the message because it was the word of God it's the word restored plus the supernatural it's the revelation of the word plus it's a supernatural word of God didn't brother B say Mark 11 always struggle always stumbled me if you say to this mountain it'll be cast in the sea if you don't doubt in your heart brother said that was always a puzzling scripture to me but then the Lord said how many squirrels do you want is that right and brother said I didn't ask to speak squirrels God told me to speak them that's how you know God using you in the third pole God will tell you to speak something I've seen it probably four five times in my Ministry one time I had a cooworker she's no longer at our school her name was Nikki we did Bible she was Barren her and her husband couldn't have children they're not in the message they're Catholics but she asked me would you help me we want to have a child they're doing all these procedures nothing worked I had a Bible study one morning Saturday morning I was praying I was looking out at this the the window just like that and something came on me brother uh and I said in the name of Jesus Christ I speak to that mountain of infertility and I command to move in the name of Jesus Christ I was crying I went upstairs I told told my wife I said honey I think I might have just prophesied I I'm afraid to tell anybody else cuz that's never happened to me before a couple days later I'm out pushing my children on the swings you know probably Caris back there I got a text from her and she sent a picture of her and her husband with a positive pregnancy test were finally pregnant nine months later the baby was born because if you say well I can't say I don't have any power of my own but when God gives us what to say then we can speak the word and that is thus sayith the Lord that will come to pass amen hallelujah praise God then in 2020 one of my our brothers in the church van he's a founding member his dad had a stroke and died but they brought him back to life he was in a coma and it's when you couldn't visit your family remember that in Co you couldn't visit your family yeah but they did let him in after a few a few uh weeks he died well I didn't know what what had happened but for some reason brother I went to bed I woke up up at I think it was 4:30 in the morning I had three scriptures on my mind the last one I could remember was Proverbs where it said life and death are in the power of the tongue yeah I'm like why am I waking up at 4:30 I was I was wide awake I just went to study I just okay I'll just go study and pray you a regular day about 88: a.m I get a call and saying this man has a stroke and as soon as he said that that scripture came to my mind there's life and death in the power of the tongue I said brother hold on let me go outside I go out there and pray I said let's pray I was looking at the Sunrise it was just a beautiful morning Hallelujah and I said brother I I speak to that stroke in the name of Jesus Christ I speak to that mountain in the name of Jesus Christ he's going to be healed and he's going to come out completely well I didn't know what I was doing I was just praying couple week couple days lateer or yeah a week later he still nothing had happen I just kept telling the church Speak Life you know what you need to do church just Speak Life stop being depressed stop being negative Speak Life don't have a negative testimony always have a positive testimony amen and then one that Sunday I was preaching on Philippians and I found out Paul that's where Paul used the prayer cloth I said let's get we have a brother brand prayer cloth and I don't know what happened to it somebody took it I really like to get that back but I said let's pray for this and I gave it to the brother Vang he went in there for his dad they finally let him sit by his dad and he said as soon as he got in there the nurses said we should pull the plug he's he's not even breathing on his own and Van said you know we're going to wait he sat there for two days straight by his dad's side he put that prayer cloth of brother random on his dad's arm and he waited and the full two days he had the Jon of faith and he said these these machines are all lying vanities for two days straight lying vanities lying vanities lying vanities two days later he woke up within a week he started talking within two weeks he was walking in 3 weeks he was out of there now he just passed away last year but God gave him three and a half extra years of life and his his son said he was a different man after God healed him God was giv him a second chance Hallelujah we need some Jonah Faith Hallelujah these are vanities amen I'm looking at the word of God hallelujah how you looking at the word of God oh it's happened numerous times you say to this mountain but you can only say it when he tells you to say it you how many believe that by God's grace I've seen a manifestor right before me speak to this mountain and the Mountain's going to move this one might be more important for some of you Brothers in 2011 boy I had a bad you ever heard of candida infection infection it's like a sugar yeast infection boy brother brother Thomas I was really unhealthy guy I was in the message I was preaching but I go out to eat all the time I had a Dr Pepper diet I guess I get I just drank Dr Pepper all the time it got so bad I was living so unhealthy I had red dots of rash all over my feet and all over my midsection every time I'd eat Taco Bell instantly it just reads red dots I have to say excuse me I got to go itch in the bathroom it was so bad brother Brad I would lay at the altar and say God give me a miracle God give me a miracle brothers would pray for me and God showed me all you have to do is stop drinking Dr Pepper stop going out to eat so much I went on a 24 day fast from sugar after 24 days all the candida was gone I'm not itching anymore I'm not scratching anymore now and I haven't had a diet uh I haven't had a Dr Pepper for over 12 years I'm done with pop I'm done I'm done I'm done hallelujah and I spoke to that I said I'm not going back in the name of Jesus Christ that was hindering my walk with the Lord I wanted a miracle I want a miracle this time God didn't say speak it this time God said look at your diet and change your diet and I always say you know the miracle was God gave me a wife who told me she' been telling me for years uh Jesse you got to stop going out to eat you I have an Egg McMuffin for breakfast I get a a bacon ater for lunch you know I was destroying my temple but remember it's not my temple I'm bought with a price this is not my body this is God's body therefore glorify God in your body so see now I can dance because my body is healed he healed my body he touch my mind he Sav me just in time I'm going to praise His name hallelujah oh each day will be it'll be the same Hallelujah yes come on and praise Him Look What the Lord Has Done how many you believe that your Miracle might come in a different way but you got to be open to the Holy Ghost showing you the way am and so now I just speak to those Taco Bell Signs all the way down here I rebuke you Taco Bell I rebuke you Egg McMuffins you're not real eggs come on Church y'all were saying amen before no wonder David dance Church the word was finally back in its place and brother R said this you know God looked down from heaven at David dancing David's leaping with all of his heart he's praising God hallelujah he's praising God mesic's back amen the word is back brother said God looked down from heaven he said David you're a man after my own heart and the church said now oh you're out of order David you're in the flesh you're just a Pentecostal no God said you're a man after my own that's why I created you I created you to dance I created you to give me praise oh my beautiful brother R said why he done lost all Pride he had done lost all of his that's what we need brother that's what that's the kind of church we need Church where people lose their pride and they just do what the Holy Spirit spirit says do and I'm not saying dance every service I'm just saying dance once in a while praise God whenever God leads you to do that or go pray for somebody when the Holy Spirit tells you to do it Hallelujah just be led of the Holy spir just lose your pride I don't care what anybody says I'm doing what God tells me to do I'm not a servant of man Paul said if I was a servant of man I couldn't be a servant of Christ you and I are here to serve Jesus Christ so let's lose all of our pride amen it takes it takes you in other words it takes humility to dance for the Lord it takes humility to shout and praise God that's what we need in America we got a bunch of prideful America right you know we're just prideful I can afford it I can do it I can do this I can do that we can do that I can do it for me I can preach I can do whatever no it's it's being humble it's being led by the Holy Spirit praise God I can't do nothing without Jesus brother B said I'm a failure without him amen he said I'm always a failure and he says I'm not saying that to be humble praise God he said I'm a sinner saved by grace not fit to live he said that the seven seal Hallelujah he said put all this grace on Jesus Christ how many believe God used brother brandom okay now put that Glory put that Grace on Jesus Christ that's what brother Braham said Glory brother Braham said Mary when she danced on the day of Pentecost brother manam said this he said she had to wait up there till she lost all of her dignity and pride so if you want the Holy Ghost you have to be free from pride and dignity well I'm just going to be the most staunch person here I'm going to be the most controlled PE person here I've got everything under under control I'm making sure everybody's in order but are you making sure you're doing what the Holy Ghost tells you to do that's really what matters Hallelujah and brother and said if you want to be like David if you want to be like these men of God in the Bible lose all your pride and dignity praise God I think that's why God's made me so reject in the message because I just done lost all my pride it forced me to lose all my pride and dignity I don't care about a small church I don't care if I'm a a church of with a a small church with a pastor it doesn't matter I'm a servant of Jesus Christ this is not about money popularity or women this is about the kingdom of God this is about getting Souls saved this is about getting the bride filled with the Holy Ghost the bride has made herself ready hallelujah amen and if God can use me in a humble little way then I want to be used in that come a little away Hallelujah I love this quote I got this from some uh some Bible commentator guy I forget his name it might have been Matthew Henry I love I love those guys you know they had some do false doctrines but they were good guys but man said they they preached and wrote like nobody ever did in the history of the world he said that in the church age book they were so anointed on that man age but Matthew Henry said the problem with maau now this is this is something that we may feel sometimes right some of us are not maau but we might act like it for a little bit like well I'm too good to dance well I I'm too good to speak in tongues brother uh Matthew Henry said Mall's problem was that she was looking at David she should not have been looking at David she should have been looking at the ark that's what always gets us in trouble we look at the man preaching we look at the sister singing we look at all these other things instead of looking at we what we should look at we should look at Jesus Jesus cuz when you see Jesus you see a savior you see a man who died who Rose and and and he gives you power he gives you power on high to be a witness unto Elton to Kentucky to akan Ohio to the ends of the world Hallelujah that's what he does Amen so let's look at the word don't look at brother Jesse jumping as high as he can I'm 43 I can't jump that high much longer I'm getting older by God's grace don't look at a man look at the word of God hallelujah now if you got your Bibles go to Jeremiah 31 here's where this can help you Church did you ever get that much Victory brother Bram said Jeremiah 31 and this ties in perfectly the last night doesn't it you get victory over sin that separates you from God's presence right and when you have victory over sin now the death is out of your life and what's left if death is gone what's there life I mean there's only one only two options there Hallelujah Jeremiah 31 now I'm going to skip down here look at verse three the Lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yay I have loved thee with what church what kind of love did God love you with ever somebody ought to say Amen on that if God loved Israel with an everlasting love what about you under the blood of Jesus Christ therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee how did God get you to the message it was his love that Drew you to the message right Glenn God's love right sister I forget your name but love you God bless you Sister God's love Drew you into the message yes it that's what it was for me I was happy in my denomination but I always looking for something deeper I was going to this preacher and then John Piper I was trying to get a little bit deeper and then Simon brought the message I like this is it this is what I've been thirsting for all these years it's the word it's the revelation of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I couldn't deny it it answered my soul's thirst hallelujah amen my soul thirst is for God for the Living God hallelujah verse four again now look listen church this is is you again I will build thee and thou shalt be built oh Virgin of Israel Thou shalt again be adorned with tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances them that make Mary did you catch that God said I'm going to give you a season to rebuild you so you can dance again I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands but how many of you have ever danced before but now for some reason you don't have the dance like you you used to have you used to have so much freedom maybe your dance was only like this you know you could dance that's a pretty good dance I'll take that dance I'm sure our pastor would take that dance oh that's the only dance you could do or maybe it's just all I can do is turn around but for some reason the trials of life and the tests and the cares of the world you lost your dance but God said I will visit you and make you dance again there is hope that you'll Dance Again by God's grace Ecclesiastes 3:4 says it plainly there's a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn and a time to dance there's a time so the question is is it time that's the question is it time uh do you have anything to be joyful about in your life let me see do I have food do I have clothes do I have a house do I have a job do I do I have health do we have anything to be thankful for we we have so much to be thankful for count your blessings name them one by one I love that song Hallelujah we have so many blessings amen if anybody's got a reason to praise God it ought to be the Christians praise God and I just name Natural Things what about the spiritual things praise God love brother R said go buy me a dollars worth of Love somewhere you can't because it's something given by God if you've got love you've got a gift from God joy peace patience Temperance longsuffering forgiveness these are all gifts of God you have things money can't buy Hallelujah somebody ought to be thankful in here this [Applause] morning Hallelujah we got to read our Bibles tomorrow praise we got to listen to the message more [Applause] amen did you ever get that much Victory thank you Jes Glory I love it and you know some people say well you know you can dance but you know only only Miriam and David dance well I got something better for you than Miriam and David there's someone greater than Miriam or David who danced could you say God and Jesus danced would you say that Proverbs 8:30 pull that up there brother then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Des Delight rejoicing always before him if you look in the Greek this means to play with singing and dancing who is this talking about who's Proverbs 8:30 talking about brother Ram said it's the logos and the church said what's the Loos the Loos is the first VIs form of the Holy Ghost so before there was anything there was just God invisible spirit and he said let there be light and a light popped out that's the lust that's the Holy Ghost that's the Son of God that's the anointing God's hiding in the light oh my and the Bible said this light was always rejoicing before the father brother Braham said it in 1953 he says I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity where' you get your dance brother brother Jesse who taught you to dance Jesus taught me to dance he was the first dancer Hallelujah god listen God originated the dance Satan perverted it but God started it that's why I dance because Jesus started the dance Hallelujah Satan's not a Creator God's a Creator [Music] hallelujah oh that struck me I started dancing around the church Hallelujah Satan didn't start to dance God started the dance that's can you imagine you got a little you got a little son I got a three-year-old son right now boy he love say Daddy let's go play football daddy let's go play tackle football he loves to dance before me and just play with me that's what the Bible said God or Jesus was doing before the father amen father it's a joy father thank you for the glory that you're sharing with me Jesus said uh give me you're going to glorify me with the glory we had before the foundation of the world Hallelujah if that's not enough put up Song of Solomon 2 ver8 you want another witness well brother Jesse in the mouth of two or three Witnesses I'll be happy to give you a second witness Song of Solomon 2 verse 8 huh the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon call in the Hills so here comes Solomon skipping down the mountains I can't wait to see my bride oh I love my bride I can't wait I'm coming in the Rapture that's what Jesus is doing Jesus coming down oh I'm going to catch a a meeting in the air praise God Glory Hallelujah God is a god of Revelation I've seen this Bible open up in the since I've been the message like it never before this Bible brother said it just becomes a new Bible the more you study down it's like well this gets deeper I feel like I'm going deeper like how how much deeper can we go my mind is blown by how deep this message is praise God so when I dance I'm dancing like Jesus taught me to dance did you know brother brandom said running around a tree was dancing did you know that brother Bram went to Colorado he said how many miles I forget how miles I think he said 60 miles riding horseback in the Colorado mountains he said he was all alone he said he heard the wolf how to its mate remember that then he saw a rainbow he said he saw a rainbow through the icicles on the tree then he saw an eagle and the squirrel we know that got a story and he said I said he said God I see you everywhere amen I see you in the the wolf I see you in the call I see you in the rainbow he said you're God of creation I love what brother said but when I saw that he said i' had set my gun down see time for hobbies was over now it's time for worship y'all love going hunting y'all love going fishing I like doing workouts too I I have hobbies too but when God's presence comes brother sets down his beloved whether be Magnum maybe I don't know he set it down he said God he said I felt like I was going to explode he said I ran around the tree praising God let me just run around the altar here I ran around the tree praising God he said I was yelling so loud if anybody would have saw me they would have thought I came out of an insane institution he said I didn't care I was worshiping my Creator oh my hallelujah praise God that's our Prophet he'll pull up his a pant leg he'll hang from a Pulpit he'll dance around he'll Scream and Shout around the tree till people think he might have been insane brother BR said if you think I'm insane I'm happier this way so leave me this way look it up he said it in 1955 he said I was dancing like David danced see you don't you don't have to dance you have to do like one of these like sometimes I was doing these at the church you know brother say you just got to run you just got to have freedom just got to you just got to move amen he said and God will look down and say there's a Danny after my own heart right there's a Glam after my own heart there's a brother Joe after my own heart heart oh glory amen that's right when you really worship God God is so pleased he said that's a child after my own heart I hope God can say uh evening light Tabernacle is a message church after God's Own Heart oh yes I believe he does hallelujah thank you Lord did you know one time brother brandom uh sister Dolores she was the youngest of 10 I think uh she said she was in a meeting in 1959 I want you listen this she said the holy brother man said the Holy Ghost fell in the building last night and look what Satan was telling Dolores Dolores came up to brother Brandon her older brother right so first and last first and last youngest and oldest interesting Alpha and Omega interesting I just caught that I don't know if there's anything to it but and dores said brother BR the devil had come in around the people saying don't listen set still so this is what the devil does when your pastor's preaching this is what the devil does when I'm preaching the devil will say don't listen sit still what stop listening so let your mind look at the preacher but out there you're doing some maybe you're cleaning at home or maybe you're looking for the deals in Walmart maybe looking for that next truck to buy with 4x4 I don't know I'm not outo door guy I don't know for me it might be I'm looking at a new a a new iPad or a new something like that to do better teaching but see Satan says don't uh uh Satan says don't move and don't listen to him That's what Satan comes to do in our services don't listen and don't move listen Church you shouldn't be sore from sitting after church you should stand up and praise God sometimes you should just stand up and say Glory I believe it and then just sit back down or just you know stand up and say hallelujah that's right brother keep preaching that's true but Satan says don't listen and sit still my sister said bill I was so happy anybody happy this morning I'm so happy while you were preaching I felt like I could raise up and jump through a wall now this is what Dolores said I felt like I could raise up and just jump right through the wall anybody ever felt like that I felt like that before and look what look look what she says brother bam said well I said raise up and jump that's all but then she said but when but when uh she said then the people began shouting so the people started shouting before she jumped up she wanted to be the first one to jump up and shout right and there's nothing wrong with that uh there's nothing wrong with one to be the first one to move in the spirit yeah that's what Miriam did yeah there's nothing wrong with wan to be the first one who stands up and pray there's nothing wrong with that but Dolores got discouraged because she wasn't the first one and she said Bill the people began shouting and that I just felt like I was an old nothing so she wanted to raise up and run through the wall she wanted to raise up and jump but other people started shouting first and I said I felt like I was nothing let's see what brother bam tells her to do I said that's the devil yeah the devil will say your worship doesn't mean nothing so tell the devil shut up devil like what do they say boo devil I don't really say that too much but is that what people say boo devil shut up devil I'm not a old nothing I'm God's beloved I'm God's people I'm one of God's children praise God but said that's the devil that's Satan now look at brother braham's advice I love this look at what a prophet advises his sister when she wants to do something he says when he comes to do that I said then you should have raised up anyhow if you feel so happy in service and Satan's trying to tell you to stop you should just do what the Holy Ghost is telling you to do Satan wants you to sit still and do nothing and say nothing God God Made You To Worship Hallelujah Glory if somebody else stands up that's okay you stand up too you didn't come here to be a bump on a pickle you came here to be part of the body of Jesus Christ yeah that's right praise God you're here to worship God tell Satan no Satan get be behind me the name of Jesus Christ that's a prophet's advice to his own sister when you feel happy follow the leading of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I'm trying to close here let me try to close now usually that means 15 or 30 minutes we'll see that's what my wife tells me back home you know Lamentations chapter 5 says when you sin it stops your dance like we saw last night when you let something die in your life if you don't clean it up it'll stop all your worship you won't feel God's presence you won't go into God's presence anymore you want to have fellowship with God that's right sometimes brother like I said last night sometimes people will sit there and they'll chew their nails through the whole service I'm like how do they have any nails left instead of chewing that they should actually lift that up and say praise God right I thinking m it's already been an hour when they start chewing their toenails they're probably done with their hands now please don't take off your socks you see how people they they're not even thinking they're not I know it's it's funny it's reality I'm like how can these people be moved by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is telling you to trim your nails during church I'm not trying to be a legalist but you understand the point yeah right what are we doing in church brother used to be heing for the Holy Spirit to raise up to praise God this Bible should make us so happy we should praise God Hallelujah at the least take notes or something save your toenail or finger trimming for home right that's good one time brother Brook said I was chewing my nails he's like that looks pretty good can I have a bite of that you he was just trying of being funny he so sometimes I'll say that in church well that looks pretty good can I have a bite taste of that there service can I take a taste of that no I'm just joking but you understand I mean we should be so in love with God that these little things should just pass away I'm here to Worship the Lord I'm glad some you get a good chuckle out of that that made me chuckle too Lamentations chapter 5 look at verse 15 the joy of our heart is ceased our dance has turned into the mour and this is because the Lamentations because the Kings and all the people had let down on God's word and all the idols came into the city so there's no joy in Jerusalem it's the city of Joy this supposed to be the House of Joy but sin had caused no dancing and no real worship and singing that's what sin does sin takes away your praise sin takes away your dance how many believe though God can bring it back he's the master of bringing things back Hallelujah he's the master of turning a new page start a new chapter of your life amen he's the master of restoring all the years the Palmer worm the caterpillar the Locust Hallelujah all the years God's the master of I will restore sayi the Lord [Applause] hallelujah Oh Glory Hallelujah now just so you know the the Bible says clapping is a is a sign clapping and shoutings are songs of are signs of Triumph when you're clapping and praising God shouting that's a sign you've got the [Music] victory Psalms 47 verse1 a psalm for the sons of Kora clap ye Hands All Ye people shout unto God with the voice of Triumph see instead of chewing on those start clapping with those Hallelujah it's plain God Specializes in turning your mour into dancing go to Isaiah 61 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he anointed me to preach the Good Tidings of the meek now go to the verse three to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for Mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness you know what heaviness is depression you ever looked that up Church we've all been depressed sometimes I don't have to ask you to raise your hand we've all been depressed you know the greatest depression ever was in the Bible was the Govern gemy how do we know because he there was so much depression blood was coming out none of us have ever had depression like that and yet he went through that the Bible brother said that was him overcoming that's when he overcame in prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane he prayed until he overcame depression and the Bible said Jesus Christ will take your mourning and turn it into dancing he will take that depression from you brother man says if you just hate it you have to hate your sin expose the devil and not love it anymore remember brother said he couldn't cast that devil out because a man loved that he worshiped that Spirit up there in Windsor was clinging onto his feet remember he said he's not free because he loves that Spirit that's why we got to hate our sins you start loving sin you are in a you're in a bad spot but Jesus can turn the page Hallelujah Jesus can bring you to a new chapter praise God and I hope somebody or many people here get a new chapter starting today Hallelujah God will give you the spirit of Joy Hallelujah instead of the spirit of heaviness he'll give you a garment of praise amen put on your preaching clothes put on your church clothes put on your glory clothes amen the Bible says you got to put it on like clothes you all got up this morning look really nice that's what the Bible said spiritually put on your praise I got to put on my dancing shoes this morning is that right I can dance for the Lord I can give God praise I the Bible says you got to put on the Garment of Praise Hallelujah that's the anointing brother brother said the spirit of joy and friends let me tell you this this is what helped me out a lot when I was battling this years ago I realized this Satan's going to try to condemn you either way whether you dance or whether you don't right how many ever dance here before the Lord anybody ever spoke in tongues I've never but I've asked God I'm still waiting on God if he'll let me speak in tongues it's just a small thing it edifies you right but here the Bible says you know either way whether you know before I dance Satan says see you never dance you're too you're too ashamed well then after our dance Satan said well you just dance for yourself either way he's going to try to condemn me so how do I win that argument brother take him back to the word take Satan back to the word just like Jesus brother said Jesus could defeat Satan any time any place anywhere with thus sayith the Lord it is written Hallelujah it is written yes hallelujah it's written I'm to praise him with the dance it's written I'm to clap my hands it's written I'm to shout songs of praise Hallelujah that's the only way you defeat the Devil anyway is by the word of God and my Bible says there's no condemnation to them that are in Jesus Christ Romans 81 Satan says oh you're condemned you're selfish you're just doing this for yourself you're just doing this uh so people can see you say shut up devil I there's no condemnation for me you can't condemn me if you haven't read Romans 8 in a while go read that that will make you feel like a Sky High Christian you'll be walking on the clouds after that there's no condemnation for me all things work together for good to them that love the Lord hallelujah who can lay any charge to God's elect Hallelujah it is God that justified you sister hallelujah it's God who justifies you Satan cannot lay any charge to your account because Jesus already dropped the charges hallelujah oh yes take Satan right back to the word of God God it is written Satan Hallelujah and then he ends the chapter with there's nothing that can separate me there's nothing that can separate you from the love of God oh no PO no principalities no demons no temptation even death nothing can separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus so what can Satan tell me now what can he tell you now he can't tell you nothing you're walking in Victory I like how you're stand up brother that's good don't sit still say you know Satan says sit still and God says don't sit still amen give God some praise and if you get depressed brother R said every time time I get a little blue I go to Romans chapter 4 where it said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith giving God the glory huh brother Brandon got depressed yes and he went to Romans chapter 4 Abraham called those things not as though they were Hallelujah Abraham didn't stagger he was strong in faith giving God glory we need some strong people in faith this morning that will give God some Glory Hallelujah I'm about worn out here either way he's going to condemn you so you might as well obey the word of God and just tell Satan a little bit of this it's written I'm supposed to praise him I was born to praise him I was born to dance why cuz he danced first Hallelujah because he danced first because he lives I shall live also because he dance I shall dance also Oh Glory Hallelujah let me close with this go to Psalms 148 I am going to try to close I can't preach my whole eight sermons in one sermon here I love you so much though I just want to give you as much as I can to strengthen local church to strengthen the pastor and the associate I just want to strengthen the people of God the best I can Psalm 148:3 praise ye him ye son and moon praise him all ye stars of light Praise Him ye heavens of heavens and ye Waters that be above the heavens let them praise the name of the Lord for he commanded and they were created the pastures are clothed with flocks The Valleys also covered over with corn they shout for Joy they also sing did you know that the valleys and the corn and the pastures and the flocks of sheep shout for Glory did you know that when that sheep goes that's shouting for Glory Hallelujah notice all creation was created in a way that they glorify God that's what you were created to do you were created for his glory for for his pleasure how many you believe that that's right so notice the Sun the moon the stars all the heavens give him praise now remember you got all these four or five reasons to praise God here's the final one when you praise God especially in the dance remember dance means to twirl right dance means to twirl and give God praise yeah when you finally get that much Victory oh I hope somebody gets some victory this morning by God's might be afternoon actually by God's grace when you finally dance and give God glory you are twirling and spinning and giving God praise and when you finally do that you actually start joining in with the rest of God's creation how many know the Moon is spinning right now around the Earth the moon types the bride oh I just seen that amen hallelujah the Moon is twirling and dancing around the Earth right now yeah come on now is that right the Bible said Ezekiel Saw a wheel spinning in the middle of the wheel so even Jesus Likens himself unto a spinning wheel oh go glory to God Amen a twirling wheel there's a wheel in a wheel there's a God in Christ yeah Glory there's a God in you there's a God in Me praise God and when we finally get enough victory in church to do a little spin or twirl We join all the stars all the planets amen all the moons We join all creation Church in what we are created to do to dance to twirl to orbit around and give God some praise Hallelujah and look they never stop praising God the moon just keeps going around Hallelujah Oh
