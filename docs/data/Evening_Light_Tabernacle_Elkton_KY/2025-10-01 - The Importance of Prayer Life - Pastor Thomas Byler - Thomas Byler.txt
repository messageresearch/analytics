========================================
And uh it's off the point maybe, but I'm sure some may somebody may be needed. And that is when you get into that closet in that quiet place. There's so much could be said about that. Cuz when you get in that prayer closet and when you go to talking unto the Lord, how many believes that you're tuning up? Amen. If your wheels are just hitting the top of the spokes and it isn't working right, when you go in that prayer closet, it makes to where things begin to go right. You're tuning up with the Lord. Amen. If you've got a temper, Brother Bam said, sweeten it with prayer. Amen. It'll tune you up. It'll tune you in. It'll Amen. It'll charge you up. It'll get you a relationship with him to where he shows you where you're wrong. If you don't have a prayer life, you're going to get messed up. How many believe we need a prayer life? We need a lot of time with the Lord. that quiet place. Amen. That still small voice. Listen to that still small voice. Amen.
