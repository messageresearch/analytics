mother's day and happy mother's day to all you mothers and it's a special day mother's day it's a day that should be i feel like highly honored and esteemed for the mothers um so we're going to do that today we're going to take time to honor the mothers and our message as we honor jesus and a little something like a couple of things i want to read real quick to you i thought this this come up this morning i seen it somewhere and it said there is no love like a mother's love she who carries the child that god knits in the womb she who nourishes and guides she who teaches and good and the happiness of her children and her family that was ronald reagan said that and you know you think about mother's day i tell you i've had the privilege to to speak on mother's day several times and and i always try to come up with a mother's day message but i just tell you they're hard they're hard to get through them uh when we think about our mothers and we and you know i know some sitting here whose mothers have gone on and i heard brother david you know if he could just have one more chance just on this side to say something to the to his mother you know um it's just special so um we'll do our best to get through it if i get sappy and cry y'all just cry with me and and we'll get on through it but uh well i just want to read this to you that brother brandon talking about the mother and before we get into our message um brother branham said to your little mothers here this morning that's been real mothers and i know there's many of you i think every one of you let me tell you something god bless you you're the fifth gospel we've heard that over and over matthew mark luke and john and mother she's the fifth gospel and he says remember when moses was a little boy it was a mother who gave him instruction it was a godly mother who took little moses on her knees and said moses someday you're going to deliver the children of israel you're the boy that's called keep yourself pure unspotted from the world for you're the one you're the one how many of you ever had mother encourage you like that that's what mothers do they encourage no other place do we know of that he ever went to a seminary all of his teaching he ever got was right there in pharaoh's palace who was a heathen but his mother was there and taught him that's a real mother she taught him the precepts of the lord she taught him how he must be holy she taught him how that he must live she taught him how what god must do and would do for him and it stuck with moses all the days of his life you've been there all the days of his life brother david i think you're still mic'd up i hear you coming through the monitors here and any good and loyal and true mother that'll take her little babies instead of sending them to a picture show and a dance and set them on her lap and teach them about the lord jesus christ he said my here the other day he said i was talking to a mother on the telephone and the mother said oh brother billy said my poor boy is in trouble oh what trouble he's in brother brown said yes i know about it sister dear and she said he may be wrong i don't know said one says this and one says that i don't know but no matter whether he's right or wrong i love him i love him he said he said to his mother he said i've been so deceived by this and that the son talking back to his mother now he said but mother i believe you're about the only sweetheart i really have you're a woman that's been true to me and sticks to me that's a mother's love that's a real mother that'll put her arms around her baby regardless right or wrong she goes right on through and if a mother can think that of her baby how much more will god think of his children stay right with him that's powerful words in that two pages let's stand if we could we'll open our bibles and get into our scripture reading real quick i'm not going to try to keep you long because i know i want you to have time to to visit like i said that's a special day and go visit with family and and your mother and as we preach this message today i want to encourage you and um and inspire you children to appreciate your mother in a different way maybe um you know when we read these things and these statements that we've come out with on a day like today it brings everything to our remembrance you know uh husbands this you know let this be a new appreciation for your wife that's raising your kids the mothers mothers make the world go around isaiah 9 and 6. isaiah 9 and 6. for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace so i'll speak to you this morning on a mother's love let's pray heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've given us a day to come out and worship and to bring honor and glory to you and spirit and truth lord and it's a special day in our hearts as we set aside one day of the year to honor our mothers who should be honored every day of the year father so lord we just ask for this message as it goes forth that it would just bring honor to you through honoring our mothers today lord and draw us close to you and lord may it just give us a new appreciation and heartfelt gratitude of everything our mothers do for us lord we just want to thank you for the cross we thank you for calvary for what you've done for us there lord and forgiveness of our sins and trespasses lord and and given us a way to to make it through we just want to tell you we love you we appreciate you in christ's name amen you can be seated i'm also going to read a portion of luke chapter 1 luke chapter 1 it says to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel come unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus he shall be great he shall be called the son of the highest the lord the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and his kingdom there shall be no end praise the lord then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seen i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said listen to how she replies behold the handmaid of the lord she accepted right there her responsibility the handmaid of the lord she is saying i will be your servant i will be your partner i will be an element of this plan of yours i behold the handmaid of the lord
