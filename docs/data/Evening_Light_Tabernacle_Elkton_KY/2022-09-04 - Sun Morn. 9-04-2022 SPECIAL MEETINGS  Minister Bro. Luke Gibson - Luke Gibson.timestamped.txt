[23:49] walketh not in the counsel of the island
[23:51] godly nor standeth in the way of sinners

[24:10] fruit in his season
[24:12] his leaf also shall not wither and
[24:14] whatsoever he doeth
[24:16] shall prosper
[24:26] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[24:28] the judgment nor sinners in the
[24:29] congregation of the righteous
[24:32] for the lord knoweth the way of the

[1:07:59] and god's brought us a long ways

[1:08:03] way
[1:08:04] amen so we appreciate the lord this
[1:08:06] morning as you're standing we'd like to
[1:08:08] open our bibles to the book of
[1:08:10] beginnings the book of genesis
[1:08:12] just wants to say it's been wonderful to
[1:08:14] be here
[1:08:15] and these services with you i want to
[1:08:17] thank again brother our brother brother
[1:08:19] thomas byler for allowing us to come and
[1:08:21] just minister to this portion of the
[1:08:23] bride of christ thank you young people
[1:08:25] for
[1:08:26] listening so tentatively
[1:08:28] and the middle-aged folk we appreciate
[1:08:30] you and the age folk as well i don't say
[1:08:33] old people just age people amen we
[1:08:36] certainly appreciate them being in the
[1:08:38] meetings as well
[1:08:40] you know i was reminded when i was 22
[1:08:43] years old i think it was
[1:08:45] i had my oldest sons luke and elijah
[1:08:48] they're 30 today but they were about 2
[1:08:50] years old i remember my brother by the
[1:08:52] name of daniel williams i remember his
[1:08:54] brother daniel williams
[1:08:56] i was sitting in his office one day at
[1:08:58] his home and i think my boys were about
[1:09:00] two or three years old
[1:09:02] and brother daniel called me into his
[1:09:04] office and i he said something to me
[1:09:06] that day that stuck with me
[1:09:08] even to this day brother daniel's gone
[1:09:10] on but he said the statement to me he
[1:09:13] said brother luke
[1:09:15] this is his statement he said don't ever
[1:09:18] do
[1:09:19] what i did don't make the mistake that i
[1:09:22] made
[1:09:23] in my heart i was thinking brother
[1:09:24] daniel what in the world are you talking
[1:09:25] about
[1:09:27] and this is what he said to me and it
[1:09:28] stuck with me
[1:09:29] he said don't you travel around the
[1:09:31] world
[1:09:32] and try to win the world
[1:09:34] and lose your own family
[1:09:38] and when he said that it penetrated my
[1:09:40] heart
[1:09:41] and i was determined that if i did
[1:09:43] travel and i have around the world
[1:09:45] but i was not going to do it at the
[1:09:47] expense of my own family
[1:09:50] and i thank god today that
[1:09:52] after these years every one of my
[1:09:54] children seven of them are all serving
[1:09:56] the lord
[1:09:58] and i certainly appreciate god for that
[1:10:00] if he never done another thing for me
[1:10:03] saving my family and all of them being
[1:10:06] in christ is the greatest gift that god
[1:10:08] could ever give to me as a human being
[1:10:11] and i certainly appreciate him for that
[1:10:14] i said it and i know it's hard words but
[1:10:16] i'd rather go to hell than to see my
[1:10:18] children lost i'd rather take their
[1:10:20] place
[1:10:21] i know that's tough but i mean that i'd
[1:10:23] rather be lost and then be saved but i
[1:10:26] just thank god he made room for us all
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:29] and god is good to us amen i know your
[1:10:31] pastor mentioned it but september the
[1:10:33] 22nd through the 25th
[1:10:35] twice a year i set up my gospel tent
[1:10:38] and there in townville right next to our
[1:10:40] church we have a property there and i
[1:10:42] set it up we have wonderful meetings and
[1:10:44] this year brother bottler and brother
[1:10:46] jason jackson will be coming and

[1:10:55] welcome to come we'll treat you so good
[1:10:57] so many ways you're bound to like one of
[1:10:59] them and so we do sort of what you do
[1:11:01] here we have our meetings in every night
[1:11:03] we have fellowship over in our
[1:11:04] fellowship hall and just we just have a
[1:11:06] good time amen so everyone here would
[1:11:08] certainly be welcome to come
[1:11:10] we if you all can't come that's fine but
[1:11:12] just make sure he comes that's that's
[1:11:14] the main thing
[1:11:16] amen genesis chapter one how many's
[1:11:18] enjoyed the services so far
[1:11:20] and i've tried not to last night i
[1:11:22] apologize i went a little longer than
[1:11:24] what i um
[1:11:26] was meant to and brother david let me
[1:11:28] know that i went longer than what i was
[1:11:29] supposed to so
[1:11:31] he changed a bit amen
[1:11:34] genesis chapter one i'd like to read two
[1:11:37] verses verses 26 and 27.
[1:11:41] very familiar text to all of us we all
[1:11:44] know how the prophet god explained all
[1:11:46] of this in question answered in genesis
[1:11:48] but i just want to read it for a
[1:11:49] foundation and god said let us make
[1:11:52] man in our image after our likeness and
[1:11:57] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:12:00] the sea
[1:12:01] over the fowl of the air over the cattle
[1:12:04] and over all the earth and over every
[1:12:07] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:12:09] earth
[1:12:10] so
[1:12:11] god created man
[1:12:14] in his own image
[1:12:16] and in the image of god created he him
[1:12:20] male and female created he them
[1:12:24] and brother branham question answers
[1:12:26] would take you from there take you to
[1:12:27] john 4 24 and tell you that god is a
[1:12:30] spirit so when he made the first man who
[1:12:33] was the son of god an attribute off of
[1:12:35] god if god would have a son he would be
[1:12:37] a spirit
[1:12:38] son
[1:12:41] right he would be a spirit son just like
[1:12:43] brother batman talked about the three
[1:12:44] dispensations when the son of man when
[1:12:46] the holy ghost come on the day of
[1:12:47] pentecost he called it son of god
[1:12:50] because it was it was sonship in spirit
[1:12:52] form that's what adam was in the garden
[1:12:54] of eden adam was called the son of god
[1:12:58] now we turn over to genesis chapter 2
[1:13:00] one verse
[1:13:02] we find in genesis chapter 2 that god
[1:13:05] created man but yet he said there's no
[1:13:07] man to toil the ground in other words he
[1:13:09] didn't have a body yet
[1:13:12] so in genesis chapter 2 the lord god
[1:13:14] formed the man of the dust of the ground
[1:13:20] and god breathed into his nostrils the
[1:13:22] breath of life here it is and man became
[1:13:26] everybody say with me a living
[1:13:28] soul so now we have a three-part being
[1:13:31] we have a man who is spirit in the image
[1:13:33] of god he now has a body he's taken on
[1:13:36] flesh
[1:13:37] god breathes into him and becomes a
[1:13:40] living soul body spirit and soul
[1:13:44] now turn with me one other place
[1:13:46] romans chapter 12
[1:13:50] verse 1 and verse 2.
[1:13:54] romans chapter 12
[1:13:55] 1-2 again another familiar
[1:13:58] scripture to his romans 12
[1:14:02] 1 and 2.
[1:14:05] paul i beseech the word there means to
[1:14:08] beg you therefore brethren
[1:14:11] by the mercies of god
[1:14:14] that you present your bodies as a living
[1:14:18] say with me a living

[1:14:27] which is your reasonable service

[1:14:34] but be you transformed by the renewing
[1:14:38] of your mind

[1:14:42] acceptable and perfect
[1:14:44] will
[1:14:46] of god

[1:14:49] from verse two if i could let me verse
[1:14:51] one i'm sorry let me read it again i
[1:14:53] beseech you
[1:14:54] therefore brethren by the mercies of god

[1:14:58] say with me as a
[1:15:01] i would like to speak this morning just
[1:15:03] along those lines for a few minutes on
[1:15:05] being a living sacrifice that is what
[1:15:08] our spiritual worship is is to be a
[1:15:12] living sacrifice i trust the holy spirit
[1:15:14] will
[1:15:15] speak to our hearts father we thank you
[1:15:17] for your word
[1:15:18] we pray now lord at this final closing
[1:15:21] service
[1:15:22] oh god that is
[1:15:24] it's another service now lord and we
[1:15:27] just pray that the holy spirit would
[1:15:29] have his way over these next few moments
[1:15:32] may you take this lord and just cap it
[1:15:33] off into the heart of the people
[1:15:35] may the holy spirit just come now and
[1:15:38] take preeminence lord and help me but
[1:15:40] once again just to get out of the way
[1:15:43] and lord give your people ears to hear
[1:15:46] lord a mind to conceive and a heart to
[1:15:49] receive this morning and then father
[1:15:51] when we walk out of here may we have a
[1:15:54] greater reality that we are not our
[1:15:56] bodies we are
[1:15:58] in our body
[1:16:00] and our bodies are just vehicles that
[1:16:02] pack us around but lord in us is you and
[1:16:06] in you
[1:16:07] lord you want to use our bodies to
[1:16:09] express yourself
[1:16:11] may we give it over to you this morning
[1:16:13] lord
[1:16:14] may we give our bodies as a living
[1:16:16] sacrifice as an expression that our soul
[1:16:19] has already been ignited lord and had
[1:16:22] already been changed into your image may
[1:16:24] the holy spirit have the preeminence in
[1:16:26] this service and we'll give you
[1:16:29] in the name of our lord jesus christ and
[1:16:31] the whole church says
[1:16:33] amen god bless you you may be seated
[1:16:35] this morning
[1:16:38] you know we hear a lot that
[1:16:40] and i'm sure there's nothing wrong with
[1:16:42] it i believe it
[1:16:44] that's right
[1:16:46] but i sure
[1:16:48] we'd all say that and i i'm certainly in
[1:16:51] agreement with that but i would like to
[1:16:53] just change
[1:16:54] the way you think for just a minute
[1:16:57] because the bible teaches us that we are
[1:17:00] changed or transformed
[1:17:04] that word is like the word uh meta it's
[1:17:07] metamorpho but it's
[1:17:10] to the word we get called metamorphosis
[1:17:12] it means to actually change forms and he
[1:17:15] said we change our forms by the renewing
[1:17:18] of our minds
[1:17:21] so we think a certain way sometimes and
[1:17:23] then the holy spirit will just bring
[1:17:26] inspiration
[1:17:27] change the way we think well i'd like to
[1:17:30] just change a little bit this morning a
[1:17:32] different direction and help you to look
[1:17:34] at something that sometimes it's not
[1:17:37] more of god that we need
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:44] no
[1:17:45] it's that we need to give ourselves more
[1:17:47] to god
[1:17:50] so i'd like to sort of change your
[1:17:52] thought pattern just
[1:17:54] for
[1:17:55] it because
[1:17:57] um sometimes we got god we do we have
[1:17:59] god if you have the baptism the holy
[1:18:01] spirit this morning you have god
[1:18:03] we want more and more of him but i don't
[1:18:06] want more of him without
[1:18:08] equally giving myself more to him
[1:18:11] so i see as i give myself more to god he
[1:18:14] can use me more and then the counteract
[1:18:17] that is that will bring more god into me
[1:18:22] so i want to begin this morning and i
[1:18:25] trust that god will help us but i want
[1:18:27] to read a little quote to you we sung
[1:18:29] this morning wonderful songs
[1:18:31] we call this worship
[1:18:33] when the preaching is done we'll call it
[1:18:36] worship let's all worship together want
[1:18:38] to change your thinking there too just
[1:18:39] for a minute
[1:18:42] because we identify
[1:18:43] worship when we sing songs we identify
[1:18:46] worship when we have our hands up we
[1:18:48] identify worship when we're sitting in
[1:18:50] the church
[1:18:52] but i want to tell you this morning that
[1:18:54] worship can be worshiped when you're not
[1:18:57] singing
[1:18:59] worship can be worshipped when you're
[1:19:00] not having your hands up
[1:19:02] worship can be worshipped when you're
[1:19:04] not sitting in the house of god
[1:19:07] let me tell you what i based that upon
[1:19:09] brother branham said oh
[1:19:11] may god drive that home in this
[1:19:13] tabernacle this morning
[1:19:15] i pray that the holy spirit will sink
[1:19:17] that so deep into the hearts
[1:19:20] we ought to give the more earnest heed
[1:19:21] to the things that we heard
[1:19:23] what type of people ought we to be
[1:19:25] when we see the great jehovah come down
[1:19:27] and do things that he does and see them
[1:19:30] compared scripture by scripture that
[1:19:32] they're the truth
[1:19:33] we sit around sometimes like works on
[1:19:36] log
[1:19:37] and so just so unconcerned
[1:19:39] we ought to be busy every minute trying
[1:19:42] to get people to christ
[1:19:44] we ought to be lively stones we should
[1:19:47] never be thoughtful like we are we'll go
[1:19:50] to church and see the lord jesus do
[1:19:53] something or bless in such a way and
[1:19:55] then we'll go out back and say that was
[1:19:57] a very nice meeting
[1:19:59] now the preaching of the word we enjoy
[1:20:01] it but that's not the main thing that's
[1:20:03] not we should not worship the lord just
[1:20:06] after we get through preaching the word
[1:20:08] as we usually do just worship him that's
[1:20:10] wonderful but we should worship him
[1:20:13] every hour of our life
[1:20:16] when we're at work we should worship him
[1:20:19] every time the opportunity presents
[1:20:21] itself worship the lord by testifying of
[1:20:24] him
[1:20:26] if you see some of you ladies see a
[1:20:28] woman in the wrong worship the lord by
[1:20:30] taking her and saying sister there's a
[1:20:33] better life than this a few minute work
[1:20:35] you hear a man using the name of the
[1:20:37] lord in vain
[1:20:38] get a chance pull him to one side slip
[1:20:40] over and take him by the hand say
[1:20:43] there's a better life than this you
[1:20:44] shouldn't use those words and tell him
[1:20:47] in a meek gentle way all those things is
[1:20:51] worship
[1:20:53] and when we see someone sick and the
[1:20:55] doctor said there's no more that can be
[1:20:56] done we ought to worship the lord by
[1:20:58] telling them there's a god in heaven
[1:21:01] that answers prayers
[1:21:06] now jesus when he was here
[1:21:08] he as i said the other night in john 4
[1:21:11] he passed told the disciples y'all go on
[1:21:14] i have needs to go by samaria
[1:21:17] jesus went by sumerians sat on a well
[1:21:20] and a woman come out to draw water
[1:21:23] in the conversation that jesus had with
[1:21:25] her he ultimately said these words the
[1:21:28] hours come and now is
[1:21:31] that
[1:21:32] the true
[1:21:33] worshipers
[1:21:34] shall worship the father in spirit and
[1:21:36] the truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:21:40] worship him now jesus was not talking
[1:21:43] about her getting a guitar and a piano
[1:21:45] and all those things and i'm nothing
[1:21:47] wrong with that i believe in those
[1:21:48] things matter of fact i'm sold out on
[1:21:50] those things i like it but he said god
[1:21:52] is a spirit and they that worship him
[1:21:56] must worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:22:01] worship is not just our singing not just
[1:22:04] our praising not just in our music when
[1:22:07] we walk out of these doors and we go out
[1:22:10] into our everyday life we're still
[1:22:12] worshiping the lord we worship him
[1:22:15] everywhere we go
[1:22:17] as i said back home we have on sunday
[1:22:20] morning i look like you all do the same
[1:22:22] thing so i don't feel so bad people ask
[1:22:24] me
[1:22:25] how many folk you got going to church i
[1:22:27] said which service
[1:22:32] sunday morning we have about 175 maybe
[1:22:35] 150 sunday night not half that cloud
[1:22:39] sunday night wednesday night a little
[1:22:41] bit less that's just the way it is it's
[1:22:43] way and as i travel around i realize
[1:22:45] that's the way it is everywhere
[1:22:49] but i but we we come to church and we
[1:22:51] worship and here's what i say on sunday
[1:22:53] morning when i preach a cir one sermon
[1:22:56] and i said you folks leave this church
[1:22:58] there should be 150 sermons preached on
[1:23:01] monday
[1:23:03] i preach one here and you take 150 out
[1:23:06] there because each one of you ought to
[1:23:08] become a living sermon
[1:23:10] you ought to go out here and express
[1:23:13] christ to the world
[1:23:15] as i said last night everybody should
[1:23:17] preach the gospel and of necessary used
[1:23:20] words
[1:23:23] our life should be an expression of
[1:23:25] christ
[1:23:27] now
[1:23:28] when we think of worship it's hard to
[1:23:31] not think of worship and think of some
[1:23:33] sort of a
[1:23:34] spiritual house a temple a church and
[1:23:38] and and we we have to kind of train our
[1:23:40] minds not to look at this building as
[1:23:43] what god's coming after this is we call
[1:23:45] this the house of lord but it's wood and
[1:23:47] it's
[1:23:48] stubble and it's it may be concrete and
[1:23:51] carpet and all these things but when the
[1:23:53] rapture comes he ain't coming after this
[1:23:55] building
[1:23:56] he's coming after this building
[1:23:58] your bodies is the temple of the holy
[1:24:01] ghost brother it would be sad thing if
[1:24:03] we thought the only time we met god is
[1:24:05] when we come to church we bring god with
[1:24:08] us when we come to church
[1:24:10] when we
[1:24:11] leave we take god with us
[1:24:14] he's in each one of our hearts this
[1:24:16] morning by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:19] and as the body of christ we are the
[1:24:22] church
[1:24:24] are you with me so far
[1:24:26] here's what the bible says
[1:24:28] and he also has lively stones i like
[1:24:31] that lively stone not dead stones
[1:24:36] lively stones
[1:24:38] i tell people all the time if you can
[1:24:40] punctuate the word god with an amen say
[1:24:43] amen
[1:24:44] if you're going to nod to me don't just
[1:24:46] do it easy give me a good hearty knob
[1:24:49] let me know there's somebody there
[1:24:52] we ought to be lively stones
[1:24:55] not a dead church a live church
[1:24:58] we have a living god among us
[1:25:01] not a dead god he's a living god
[1:25:04] brother david said you go to a bald game
[1:25:06] it's the truth brother david i've been
[1:25:08] to him that boy right there zechariah
[1:25:10] one day we took him to i think he might
[1:25:12] have been six flat you know
[1:25:16] we didn't tell it but it might have been
[1:25:18] six flags over georgia or you know north
[1:25:20] carolina whatever that place is up there
[1:25:22] one of these places where about every
[1:25:24] ride is tempting the lord thy god
[1:25:28] and he said daddy come ride this with me
[1:25:30] you probably don't even remember it come
[1:25:31] ride this ride with me was it him mom or
[1:25:33] was it jeremiah was him wasn't it
[1:25:35] zechariah i believe but he said ride it
[1:25:37] it was one of these rides that they go
[1:25:39] up real slow and they click
[1:25:42] click click click click click i said son
[1:25:44] i'm not riding it i said i rode that
[1:25:46] when i was young but i'm older now and
[1:25:50] you know my heart i just don't like that
[1:25:52] kind of stuff i believe it tempts the
[1:25:53] lord thy god the bible said him only
[1:25:55] shalt thou serve oh come on daddy so i
[1:25:58] decided to get on the ride with him and
[1:26:01] click click click click took about 10 or
[1:26:03] 15 seconds to get off the top then we
[1:26:05] got close to the top he said lift your
[1:26:06] hands up
[1:26:10] and so i lifted my hands up i'm used to
[1:26:11] doing that in church but not on the rise
[1:26:14] so i lifted my hands up when he got to
[1:26:16] the side it boom it dropped my heart
[1:26:18] dropped he screamed i screamed
[1:26:21] then with the crazy thing is we got out
[1:26:23] the same spot that we started at
[1:26:25] and i got off that rod and i said now
[1:26:27] wait a second boy if we can get on a
[1:26:29] ride lift our hands and scream on a ride
[1:26:32] that takes us back where we started from
[1:26:34] and you can do that on this kind of ride
[1:26:36] and next time we're in church you ought
[1:26:38] to have your hands up praising the lord
[1:26:41] because we're on a ride that's going to
[1:26:43] take us somewhere where we started at we
[1:26:45] come from god we're going back to god
[1:26:48] and if you can stream on something like
[1:26:49] that how much more in the house of god
[1:26:51] can we praise him and love him
[1:26:54] [Applause]
[1:26:56] he played in a a state championship last
[1:26:58] year and i've got the picture and i'll
[1:27:00] always have it
[1:27:01] and in the picture they put him in the
[1:27:03] newspaper and he's
[1:27:05] just like maybe he caught that game is
[1:27:07] what he did and after the game they won
[1:27:09] and he was so excited he jumped
[1:27:11] so high off the ground and he's got his
[1:27:13] leg out in his hand like that and it's
[1:27:14] on a paper in the newspaper the local
[1:27:17] paper and i got a
[1:27:19] copy of it matter of fact it's in my
[1:27:21] phone and i thought if you can be happy
[1:27:23] about winning the game to bring you that
[1:27:25] high off the ground how much more a soul
[1:27:28] it saved that's got the holy ghost
[1:27:30] that's been redeemed from sin
[1:27:32] come on church we ought to be able to
[1:27:34] love him and worship him for his great
[1:27:36] grace that he's poured out not only upon
[1:27:39] our lives but on our lives of others
[1:27:42] amen we have a right to worship him we
[1:27:44] have a right to praise him we should be
[1:27:47] a lively living stone
[1:27:50] and each stone makes up this spiritual
[1:27:52] house until
[1:27:54] peter said we'll notice these words
[1:27:56] we're a holy
[1:28:02] offering up spiritual
[1:28:04] sacrifices
[1:28:06] acceptable this is powerful to god
[1:28:09] by jesus christ and i'm going to get in
[1:28:11] a little something here and i'll try not
[1:28:13] to hold you too long but what we see is
[1:28:16] if there is a worship
[1:28:18] then there is a temple
[1:28:20] and if there is a temple then there are
[1:28:22] sacrifices
[1:28:24] if there's sacrifices being offered
[1:28:27] there is priests that offer them
[1:28:30] and then there's a priesthood but this
[1:28:32] priesthood is not after the aaron
[1:28:34] aaronic priesthood or the levitical
[1:28:36] priesthood as a matter of fact when
[1:28:39] jesus come he was not even a high priest
[1:28:42] after the order of aaron he was a high
[1:28:45] priest after the order of melchizedek
[1:28:48] that priesthood has an end but jesus's
[1:28:52] was the one that was had no end it was
[1:28:55] after the power of an endless life and
[1:28:58] if you're sitting here this morning you
[1:28:59] don't have a life that's going to end
[1:29:02] you have eternal life and the reason it
[1:29:04] won't end because it never did begin
[1:29:06] it's without beginning and it's without
[1:29:08] end
[1:29:11] let me tell you why i'm laying this just
[1:29:13] for a second hebrews 13
[1:29:15] verse 15 tells us that by
[1:29:18] him therefore
[1:29:20] let us offer the sacrifice of praise
[1:29:25] you realize you come to church sometimes
[1:29:27] and you don't feel like
[1:29:30] praise
[1:29:32] but i don't serve god because i feel
[1:29:35] like it
[1:29:36] i do it because he's worthy of it
[1:29:40] there's times and i'm the preacher that
[1:29:42] i thought got up and said oh my god to
[1:29:45] go to church my body feels that way but
[1:29:48] then there's something inside down in
[1:29:50] that soul says but i'm going to church
[1:29:52] today
[1:29:53] sometimes you might look look in this
[1:29:56] meeting that we've had friday saturday
[1:29:58] this morning you might wake up this
[1:29:59] morning
[1:30:00] and don't even feel like you're saved
[1:30:03] but you ain't saved because you feel it
[1:30:05] you're saying because you believe it
[1:30:07] if we just went by
[1:30:09] feelings our life would be a roller
[1:30:10] coaster we don't go by our feelings we
[1:30:13] go by his word this is a faith law okay
[1:30:16] man so sometimes i come in and i might
[1:30:19] not like feel like lifting up my head
[1:30:21] but my soul says lift them up anyways
[1:30:24] amen because this is a sacrifice of
[1:30:26] praise
[1:30:28] but i'm going to get to something then
[1:30:30] he went on to say praise god
[1:30:32] continually that is the fruit of our
[1:30:35] lips giving thanks to his name
[1:30:39] but now when i come to romans 12
[1:30:43] he tells us to offer to god a living
[1:30:45] sacrifice but then when he brings it
[1:30:47] down he says offering yourself to god is
[1:30:49] the liberal side it's just a reasonable
[1:30:54] service
[1:30:55] it's just a reasonable service here's
[1:30:58] the facts
[1:30:59] the concept
[1:31:01] of a sacrifice is certainly old
[1:31:04] testament
[1:31:06] yes
[1:31:07] the first
[1:31:09] man that ever fell in the garden of eden
[1:31:12] he didn't make the first sacrifice
[1:31:15] adam didn't make the first sacrifice
[1:31:18] eve didn't make the first sacrifice even
[1:31:21] abel
[1:31:22] didn't make the first sacrifice
[1:31:24] the first sacrifice that was ever made
[1:31:26] was made by god himself
[1:31:29] he killed
[1:31:31] a lamb and clothed
[1:31:34] the fallen man and his wife adam and eve
[1:31:37] and he clothed them in the skins that
[1:31:40] they
[1:31:42] were
[1:31:43] covered in
[1:31:44] god made the first sacrament but notice
[1:31:46] the sacrifice that was made
[1:31:49] when it was made it had to be offered as
[1:31:51] a dead
[1:31:53] sacrifice
[1:31:56] because no sacrifice
[1:31:58] in the old testament was ever offered to
[1:32:00] god
[1:32:01] except you took the life of that
[1:32:03] sacrifice
[1:32:04] so every offering that was ever offered
[1:32:07] to god was a dead
[1:32:10] sacrifice and that dead sacrifice
[1:32:13] represented someone who was living
[1:32:17] but when paul picks up the sacrifice in
[1:32:21] romans 12 he doesn't speak of a dead
[1:32:24] sacrifice he speaks of a living
[1:32:27] sacrifice
[1:32:29] let me show you why this is important
[1:32:32] sacrifice
[1:32:33] is not us offering and i'm going to show
[1:32:35] you why we don't offer animals today
[1:32:39] god don't want an animal he don't want
[1:32:40] one of your lambs
[1:32:42] he doesn't want a bull he doesn't want a
[1:32:44] turtledove he doesn't want a goat
[1:32:46] god don't want any animals matter of
[1:32:48] fact he never had pleasure in those
[1:32:51] things
[1:32:52] no god wants a sacrifice but he doesn't
[1:32:55] want a dead animal
[1:32:57] no i don't want you bringing a
[1:32:58] substitute
[1:33:00] for you he wants you to bring you
[1:33:03] and when you bring you he doesn't want
[1:33:06] you coming for offering something that
[1:33:08] represents you he wants you and when he
[1:33:10] when you when you come he doesn't want
[1:33:12] to come and bring him something dead he
[1:33:14] wants to bring him something that is
[1:33:16] living
[1:33:18] a living sacrifice
[1:33:21] now just stay with me for a minute the
[1:33:23] language of sacrifices is certainly
[1:33:26] old testament
[1:33:28] it's ceremonial
[1:33:32] it's the language of the levitical
[1:33:34] priesthood
[1:33:35] it's the language
[1:33:37] of sacrifice the levitical system the
[1:33:40] language of priesthood and in the old
[1:33:42] testament
[1:33:42] they would offer to god a lamb
[1:33:45] a turtle dove
[1:33:47] they would bring the sacrifice notice
[1:33:49] this to the holy place
[1:33:51] of which brother byler
[1:33:53] the people that brought their sacrifice
[1:33:55] had to depend on somebody else to go in
[1:33:58] there for them
[1:33:59] so nobody that brought a sacrifice could
[1:34:01] actually go into the holy place they'd
[1:34:03] have to bring the sacrifice and then
[1:34:05] before it would enter in they would kill
[1:34:07] it and then that individual would take
[1:34:09] that
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:11] representation of the blood and go into
[1:34:13] the holy place and that animal would
[1:34:15] represent the person
[1:34:17] but the person themselves could never
[1:34:19] enter into the holy place
[1:34:21] the only thing they could actually give
[1:34:22] to god which watch this would represent
[1:34:25] the condition of their own soul
[1:34:27] because man was separated from god
[1:34:30] he was in a dead condition
[1:34:32] we all came in the world ephesians 2 i
[1:34:35] read the other night dead and trespasses
[1:34:37] and sin
[1:34:40] there was no response there was nothing
[1:34:43] in our human makeup even in our fallen
[1:34:46] condition that we could ever give to god
[1:34:48] that would please him
[1:34:50] so the only thing that man could do was
[1:34:52] bring dead sacrifices which brother ben
[1:34:55] tells us was simply what it was a
[1:34:57] substitute
[1:34:59] as a matter of fact that dead animal as
[1:35:02] brother ben would say was a lower life
[1:35:04] form than man because it was a it was
[1:35:06] had a spirit but it was an animal and it
[1:35:10] and man was made hard because he had a
[1:35:12] soul and the animal had no soul so
[1:35:14] brother said when you offered it
[1:35:18] the life of the animal could not come
[1:35:20] back upon the worshiper that was
[1:35:22] bringing the dead sacrifice so he would
[1:35:24] walk away with the very same nature
[1:35:26] desires that he had before he went so
[1:35:29] there was no change about him the only
[1:35:32] thing was a dead sacrifice was offered
[1:35:35] and this man's
[1:35:37] sins that he may have confessed he
[1:35:38] placed his hand on the head of that
[1:35:40] animal those sins were not even remitted
[1:35:43] they were only covered
[1:35:46] because the power of animal blood
[1:35:49] had no power to wipe out the memory of
[1:35:52] god
[1:35:53] what man had committed that's why the
[1:35:56] bible tells you in hebrews 10 that the
[1:35:58] same sacrifices the high priest stands
[1:36:00] daily offering the same sacrifices which
[1:36:04] can never take away sin
[1:36:06] and then this is what it says and when
[1:36:08] the high priest or the priest offered
[1:36:10] the sacrifice there was a remembrance
[1:36:14] of sins made every year
[1:36:16] think about that hear people
[1:36:19] young poor and
[1:36:21] the feast was coming and they would go
[1:36:23] to offer the sacrifice and when that
[1:36:25] animal was shed and his blood was poured
[1:36:28] out and that worshiper walked away the
[1:36:31] only thing that
[1:36:33] that little ceremony did and that
[1:36:35] substitute did was remind god
[1:36:38] of what man did in the beginning because
[1:36:40] every time they offered an animal they
[1:36:42] were replicating what god did in the
[1:36:44] garden when he sacrificed an animal and
[1:36:47] reminded god of the sin that man had
[1:36:50] committed
[1:36:53] listen to me that's what dead sacrifices
[1:36:55] does because that animal blood had no
[1:36:58] power to wipe out of god's mind the sins
[1:37:01] that was committed by the human race now
[1:37:03] i'm going to give you the answer here
[1:37:05] and then we're going to preach it but
[1:37:06] did you know when jesus come
[1:37:08] the bible said but this man offered one
[1:37:11] sacrifice for sins forever
[1:37:14] sat down on the right hand of god and
[1:37:17] listened to this and then the bible said
[1:37:19] after he did that then god said their
[1:37:22] sins and iniquities will i remember no
[1:37:25] more amen the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:28] which was the created brother jehovah
[1:37:30] god didn't remind god of what we did it
[1:37:33] wiped out his memory wiped out of his
[1:37:36] mind every sin that was ever committed
[1:37:38] past present and future
[1:37:43] the power of jehovah's created blood was
[1:37:46] the only thing that had power to wipe
[1:37:48] out god's memory that he would take man
[1:37:50] sin cast him into a sea never to be
[1:37:54] remembered again
[1:37:58] brother if that don't make you happy i
[1:38:00] don't know what will but them high
[1:38:02] priest if you read it the bible said
[1:38:05] they stood daily
[1:38:07] standeth daily
[1:38:09] standeth daily offering the same
[1:38:12] sacrifices which can never take away sin
[1:38:17] them priests work
[1:38:18] the reason the bible tells you they
[1:38:20] stood daily
[1:38:21] is because it was a sign the work
[1:38:24] would never be completed
[1:38:26] their work would never be finished
[1:38:28] that's why a man stands because his work
[1:38:31] isn't completed but that you notice when
[1:38:33] jesus
[1:38:34] offered his sacrifice
[1:38:35] and then he ascended to god the first
[1:38:37] thing the bible said was he set down
[1:38:40] when this high priest offered the
[1:38:42] sacrifice he went to throw him with god
[1:38:43] the holiest of all and sat down because
[1:38:45] there was a sign the work was finished
[1:38:48] and let me just tell you this then
[1:38:49] priest back there would die and another
[1:38:52] priest would take his place then he
[1:38:53] would die another priest would
[1:38:55] take his praise he would die and another
[1:38:57] preacher would take his place but when
[1:38:59] our high priest and our apostle when in
[1:39:02] the presence of god he lives forever
[1:39:04] more he could never die again nobody
[1:39:07] will ever take the place of jesus nobody
[1:39:10] will ever substitute him amen he's god's
[1:39:13] amen every living memorial in the
[1:39:15] present of god and he stands there to
[1:39:16] represent you enough this morning in the
[1:39:18] presence of god
[1:39:20] not a dead sacrifice
[1:39:23] he lives
[1:39:25] oh really god i'm saying like the bible
[1:39:26] he ever lives to make intercession upon
[1:39:30] the confession of the saints
[1:39:33] you're still with me
[1:39:35] let me go on
[1:39:37] so here they would bring the sacrifice
[1:39:40] sacrifice was basically a
[1:39:42] substitute
[1:39:44] the system of offering dead animals
[1:39:48] has ended
[1:39:51] yes
[1:39:52] that system of offering something dead
[1:39:55] to god he takes this is the bible he had
[1:39:57] no pleasure in those things
[1:40:01] he didn't god wasn't pleased with animal
[1:40:04] sacrifice you study history you'll find
[1:40:06] millions and millions and millions and
[1:40:09] millions of gallons
[1:40:12] of animal blood was shed
[1:40:14] and not even a speck
[1:40:16] an ounce of that animal blood had any
[1:40:19] power to remit our sins and make us
[1:40:22] sinless in the presence of god
[1:40:26] that's right
[1:40:28] there's no more animal sacrifices none
[1:40:30] of that is pleasing to god why because
[1:40:32] it's dead
[1:40:35] and the bible said jesus
[1:40:37] in that he died
[1:40:39] why did he die he didn't die because he
[1:40:41] sinned
[1:40:42] he died because the sins of you and i
[1:40:44] came on him
[1:40:46] so he had to represent us in that dead
[1:40:49] condition but said in there he died he
[1:40:51] died once to sin
[1:40:53] and that he liveth he liveth unto god
[1:40:57] and tonight jesus is just as alive as he
[1:41:00] ever was
[1:41:02] he will never die again
[1:41:04] i'm just going to put the points in here
[1:41:06] and if you're in him you'll never die
[1:41:08] again
[1:41:09] if you're a christian you cannot die
[1:41:12] brother said matter of fact christians
[1:41:13] don't die they only change their
[1:41:15] dwelling places
[1:41:17] you take my body you led out to the
[1:41:19] grave that ain't me that's what we'll
[1:41:20] get to that's not me that's just the
[1:41:22] body that's just the vehicle i walk
[1:41:24] around in you can't even see me
[1:41:28] i'm down on the inside of this body
[1:41:30] don't get so in love with this hey this
[1:41:32] is going to be i'm going to step out of
[1:41:34] this one day if i leave here before
[1:41:37] jesus comes or you do you're going to
[1:41:39] step out of this step over into another
[1:41:41] body that's already waiting on you
[1:41:44] how long has that body been around well
[1:41:46] here's what the bible said we have a
[1:41:48] building of god a house not made with
[1:41:49] hands eternal
[1:41:54] eternal
[1:41:56] don't you think you just
[1:41:58] started when you got here
[1:42:01] you were somewhere else before you ever
[1:42:02] got here
[1:42:04] you just bypassed that
[1:42:06] and came here through a sexual act the
[1:42:09] brother had there not ever been a
[1:42:11] fall
[1:42:13] every predestinated seated god who's
[1:42:15] named the lamb's book of life would have
[1:42:16] come right to that garden by the spoken
[1:42:18] word of god
[1:42:19] but then the fall happened and man came
[1:42:21] in the world a secondary way which was
[1:42:23] by sexual act but when jesus come he
[1:42:26] bypassed the sexual act and came in the
[1:42:28] world with a spoken word of god and you
[1:42:31] know what he did he was making a way for
[1:42:32] us to be born again not by such a desire
[1:42:35] but by the holy ghost amen he was making
[1:42:38] way for the new birth and do you realize
[1:42:40] in the resurrection brother madam said
[1:42:42] in paragraph 45 page 45 and merging
[1:42:45] divorce he said god will call his
[1:42:47] children from the dust of the earth like
[1:42:49] he did at the beginning amen not by
[1:42:51] sexual desire but by the power of the
[1:42:54] spoken word the cosmic lights have
[1:42:56] petroleum he'll call you up and you'll
[1:42:59] come out of that grave not a different
[1:43:01] body but the same body but in a
[1:43:02] glorified condition
[1:43:06] oh i hope you believe that
[1:43:08] that's our hope this morning
[1:43:11] but now watch this very closely
[1:43:14] what does god want now well
[1:43:16] he wants living
[1:43:18] not dead
[1:43:20] he wants living
[1:43:21] sacrifices now when i was a young
[1:43:24] pentecostal boy i was just thinking back
[1:43:26] there again
[1:43:27] brother daryl and brother david
[1:43:30] i was about 20 years old
[1:43:32] when i started pastoring arkansas when
[1:43:34] these guys
[1:43:36] met me
[1:43:37] i still didn't believe in brother thomas
[1:43:38] wearing short sleeves
[1:43:41] i would not put a pair of
[1:43:42] short sleeves on my
[1:43:44] holy arms
[1:43:47] we didn't believe in that we only wore
[1:43:49] long sleeves
[1:43:50] we didn't wear rings and watches all
[1:43:52] that ungodly stuff we didn't wear that
[1:43:54] stuff
[1:43:55] we just didn't do it we didn't wear
[1:43:57] watches
[1:43:58] i know that's all man-made traditions i
[1:44:01] get it that's all man nature but you
[1:44:03] know what we believe we believe that we
[1:44:04] were offering things of god that was
[1:44:06] pleasing him and somehow i could offer
[1:44:08] something to make myself more
[1:44:10] acceptable to god
[1:44:12] thank god for this message
[1:44:15] thank god for a vindicated prophet
[1:44:18] that knows how to balance us up and
[1:44:20] bring us back in line with the word of
[1:44:22] god thank god for the ability to die to
[1:44:25] the old system say man
[1:44:27] and let god change our mind to mold us
[1:44:29] into the image of his word
[1:44:32] but god wanted what not
[1:44:35] something weak at all
[1:44:37] this is very important because you young
[1:44:39] people are going to understand
[1:44:40] you don't have nothing to bring to god
[1:44:44] to make yourself
[1:44:46] acceptable to him
[1:44:48] but something's got to die
[1:44:51] something has to die
[1:44:53] the only thing that you could ever offer
[1:44:55] to god
[1:44:57] that would make yourself you can't even
[1:44:59] approach him without it
[1:45:01] there's only one thing that had a power
[1:45:03] to deal with your sin
[1:45:06] and that is christ
[1:45:10] it's so true
[1:45:11] that you don't even have the power to
[1:45:14] approach god
[1:45:15] except to go through christ
[1:45:19] okay what all these religions tell you
[1:45:21] muslims and hindus and i've been in
[1:45:24] their countries and i've been to india
[1:45:26] where they got over 40 000 gods
[1:45:29] i've been on an airplane in india flying
[1:45:31] from one side of any to the other
[1:45:34] and a cockroach
[1:45:36] is crawling on the wall
[1:45:38] of the plane and i tell the interpreter
[1:45:40] next to me i said if that thing comes
[1:45:42] near me my hand to god i'll kill it oh
[1:45:44] no you can't do that it would upset this
[1:45:47] whole plane
[1:45:49] really yeah because that could be uncle
[1:45:51] sword and so come back
[1:45:53] as a cockroach i said well he's gonna
[1:45:55] die again
[1:45:58] he comes near me he's dead
[1:46:00] and i went down the restaurant and the
[1:46:02] hypocrisy that's in it
[1:46:04] cows are walking down the streets people
[1:46:06] are skinny and the cows are all fat and
[1:46:08] they worship the cows and when i when
[1:46:10] they saw the cow they saw uncle tony
[1:46:13] when i saw the cow i saw a rib eye steak
[1:46:18] and i said man i'm tired of this rice
[1:46:21] i'm tired this stuff i said you found
[1:46:23] your restaurant served me a steak and
[1:46:24] they found me one and we went down there
[1:46:26] and they did it just for the americans
[1:46:27] and you think of the hot pockets why are
[1:46:29] you going to feed me your family if you
[1:46:30] believe that you're better why are you
[1:46:31] going to feed it to me
[1:46:33] i sat there and ate that big rib eye
[1:46:35] and told the interpreter with me i said
[1:46:37] their incest their ancestors taste
[1:46:39] really good right now
[1:46:43] can you imagine
[1:46:45] having that type of mentality
[1:46:48] but i've seen it you know where they
[1:46:50] believe that they can approach god but
[1:46:51] listen here's the facts in our condition
[1:46:54] we cannot even approach a holy god
[1:47:00] no religion has rights to approach god
[1:47:03] without a mediator between them and that
[1:47:05] god
[1:47:06] he's holy and we ain't
[1:47:08] there's one god
[1:47:10] and one mediator between god and men
[1:47:13] the man christ jesus
[1:47:16] jesus said i am the way i am the truth
[1:47:18] and i am the life and no man comes to
[1:47:20] the father but by me
[1:47:23] now why is that so wonderful let me tell
[1:47:25] you why because that means
[1:47:28] as the song says nothing in my arms i
[1:47:30] bring
[1:47:31] simply to the cross i clean if i'm going
[1:47:34] to come to god and something has to die
[1:47:36] in my place then what i'm going to
[1:47:38] accept is i'm going to come to a holy
[1:47:40] god with a sacrifice but the sacrifice
[1:47:42] motor says that i'm bringing to him is
[1:47:44] not a dead sacrifice it's a living
[1:47:46] sacrifice the sacrifice i'm approaching
[1:47:48] god with is not myself it's jesus
[1:47:54] you say well what about me well the only
[1:47:56] way you can become a living sacrifice is
[1:47:58] to get in jesus
[1:48:02] if you're in christ today you're not a
[1:48:04] dead sacrifice
[1:48:07] how can i get in christ well the bible
[1:48:09] teaches it first corinthians chapter 12
[1:48:11] verse 13 tells us that by one
[1:48:14] spirit
[1:48:15] we're all baptized into one body and
[1:48:18] when you get in that body this body is a
[1:48:20] living body
[1:48:22] it's a holy body and the only way you
[1:48:24] can ever be a living sacrifice is you
[1:48:27] got to be in a living christ
[1:48:29] i don't mean a church i mean christ
[1:48:34] i don't mean a building i mean christ
[1:48:36] there's all kinds of people sitting in
[1:48:38] church of the day they're not in christ
[1:48:41] i passed quite a few of them coming down
[1:48:43] the road and it's possible some of you
[1:48:44] could be sitting here this morning
[1:48:46] that's not incredible not saying you're
[1:48:47] eight but it's possible being said in a
[1:48:49] message because with a message building
[1:48:51] don't mean you're in christ
[1:48:53] we made a horrible mistake by teaching
[1:48:55] that nonsense well if you believe our
[1:48:57] doctrine i don't care you know every
[1:48:58] doctrine brother and preach that still
[1:49:00] don't mean you're in christ you've got
[1:49:02] to meet the person of christ
[1:49:05] brother adam wasn't coming here to try
[1:49:06] just to change our theology he was
[1:49:09] trying to introduce us to a living
[1:49:11] christ
[1:49:12] [Applause]
[1:49:15] listen i'm gonna say just a couple of
[1:49:17] things i gotta hurry
[1:49:19] young ladies it's wonderful that you've
[1:49:21] never put a pair of scissors to your
[1:49:22] hair
[1:49:23] that is wonderful that you've never done
[1:49:25] that but you ain't seen because you've
[1:49:27] never cut your hair
[1:49:30] it's wonderful you don't walk around in
[1:49:32] short short skirts showing your thighs
[1:49:34] off to men but you ain't saved because
[1:49:36] you've got dresses dragging the ground
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:41] i'm trying to hurt your feelings i'm
[1:49:42] just telling the fact boys you ain't
[1:49:44] saying because you don't smoke
[1:49:45] cigarettes and tell dirty jokes that's
[1:49:47] wonderful you might not do that morally
[1:49:50] but you still ain't saved because you do
[1:49:51] those things or don't do those things i
[1:49:54] was sitting down in a barber chair a few
[1:49:56] years back
[1:49:58] and i don't usually let men cut my hair
[1:50:00] because most of them are
[1:50:03] they're too sweet to be messing with me
[1:50:06] and so i've never used a male stylist or
[1:50:09] a barber because i don't like them i
[1:50:11] don't like the way they act
[1:50:13] they don't act like
[1:50:14] a
[1:50:15] man i don't want to touch me if i have a
[1:50:17] woman give me a real one
[1:50:20] [Applause]
[1:50:21] i sit in a restaurant one day and this
[1:50:23] boy come up can i help you i said no you
[1:50:26] can't
[1:50:27] i said go back to the back send a real
[1:50:29] woman
[1:50:32] the manager come out said well you're
[1:50:34] not satisfied with your
[1:50:35] server i said no you sent me a
[1:50:37] counterfeit send me the real thing

[1:51:01] time tried to pay me five thousand
[1:51:03] dollars quit preaching against
[1:51:03] homosexuality i said the man would have
[1:51:06] the guts to tell me that i said then you
[1:51:08] you're either one or you got somebody in
[1:51:09] your family come to find out his son was
[1:51:10] one and he didn't want to hear me
[1:51:12] preaching against it i don't care if
[1:51:13] your grandma's one of them
[1:51:15] we're still going to preach the truth
[1:51:18] it's an abomination inside of god
[1:51:21] amen and we got a society trying to dumb
[1:51:23] us down so we don't speak out against
[1:51:26] those things but this bible causing an
[1:51:28] abomination of god
[1:51:30] expects you girls to act like cinnamon
[1:51:32] act like girl new boys
[1:51:34] masculine be boys be men
[1:51:39] so i sit there in that barber chair and
[1:51:41] one thing i don't do is talk about
[1:51:42] religion the bible god or nothing else
[1:51:45] while i'm sitting in a barber chair
[1:51:48] that's a dumb mistake they'll
[1:51:49] accidentally shade the back of your head
[1:51:51] up you say something they disagree with
[1:51:54] and she asked me a question she said can
[1:51:56] i ask you something i said yes
[1:51:58] she said your wife doesn't cut her hair
[1:52:00] and i said look i don't talk bible while
[1:52:02] you're
[1:52:03] cutting my hair when you're done cutting
[1:52:04] my hair i'll talk bible with you
[1:52:08] she said oh i won't do nothing
[1:52:11] and i said okay
[1:52:13] i said if you
[1:52:15] mess me up i'll never come back again
[1:52:19] oh i wouldn't do that to you
[1:52:21] she said but am i going to hell because
[1:52:23] i
[1:52:23] cut my hair i said absolutely not
[1:52:28] shocked her
[1:52:30] she said well wait a second you had a
[1:52:32] fella here the other day that told me
[1:52:33] you was his pastor and she named the
[1:52:35] fella
[1:52:36] and i said yeah he does go to church
[1:52:38] with me
[1:52:39] he told me i was going to hell because i
[1:52:42] cut my hair i said he lied to you
[1:52:46] she said but you're his pastor don't
[1:52:47] y'all believe the same thing and i said
[1:52:49] well not that she said well don't you
[1:52:51] believe i ought to cut my hair i said no
[1:52:54] my wife doesn't cut her hair
[1:52:56] i said but she's not going to heaven
[1:52:58] because she don't cut her hair
[1:53:00] and you're not going to hell because you
[1:53:01] cut yours
[1:53:04] she was taken back
[1:53:06] she didn't understand it because i don't
[1:53:07] get it i said well let me ask you
[1:53:09] something if you knew the bible told you
[1:53:12] not to cut your hair and it was given to
[1:53:14] you for your glory
[1:53:16] and you've done it anyways
[1:53:18] are you going to hell because you cut
[1:53:20] your hair or are you going to hell
[1:53:21] because you disbelieve
[1:53:23] what god said she said now that makes
[1:53:27] sense i said ain't nobody going to hell
[1:53:29] because they cut their hair and smokes
[1:53:31] and they're on down the line i said you
[1:53:32] go to hell because you disbelieve
[1:53:36] and i said when you're saved you ain't
[1:53:38] saved because you grow long hair and do
[1:53:40] this and do that and do this you say
[1:53:42] cause you believe
[1:53:45] all the other things are attributes of
[1:53:47] either faith or unbelief
[1:53:50] she said that makes perfect sense so her
[1:53:51] hair as i kept going back her hair kept
[1:53:54] getting longer and longer look it was
[1:53:55] nice it looked nice to see it on her and
[1:53:57] then finally one day i went in and it
[1:53:59] was chopped back off again i said hey
[1:54:00] well she was i just couldn't do it
[1:54:04] it's getting too long and i said look
[1:54:06] that's because you don't have to do it
[1:54:08] on the inside
[1:54:10] that's now we got to get to the other
[1:54:11] thing when you believe and it's true
[1:54:14] faith then god will confirm your faith
[1:54:17] by giving you the holy ghost
[1:54:20] then when you get the holy ghost now you
[1:54:22] got to want to down inside there and you
[1:54:26] you wouldn't have done it because i told
[1:54:27] you to the bible to which is good
[1:54:29] nothing wrong with that but you do it
[1:54:31] now not because it's a rule or it's a
[1:54:33] ritual or it's a regulation you do it
[1:54:35] because of the love of god in your heart
[1:54:36] that wants to serve him and you become a
[1:54:39] living sacrifice to him
[1:54:45] i know that's old-fashioned but it's
[1:54:47] right
[1:54:48] we put so much emphasis out here look
[1:54:51] you're trying to clean the fist before
[1:54:53] you catch it
[1:54:53] [Music]
[1:54:55] then we get our cart before the horse
[1:54:58] that's right and what we got to do is
[1:55:00] get men and women of christ
[1:55:03] you get into christ and the life of
[1:55:05] christ will come on the inside and when
[1:55:07] the life is down the inside in that root
[1:55:09] down on the inside the inside then you
[1:55:11] won't have to go around worrying about
[1:55:13] the fruit they'll automatically manifest
[1:55:16] themselves this ain't counterfeit this
[1:55:18] ain't manufacturing this a hypocrisy
[1:55:21] this ain't putting on it could come out
[1:55:23] of a genuine burst from the holy ghost
[1:55:30] god
[1:55:31] wants living
[1:55:33] sacrifices
[1:55:36] listen now
[1:55:37] here's brother banham
[1:55:39] can i have a few more minutes this
[1:55:41] morning
[1:55:42] y'all look quiet on me now when you do
[1:55:44] that scares me thinks maybe i got a
[1:55:46] rabbit on the run
[1:55:50] back home when they do that i start just
[1:55:52] chasing the rabbit
[1:55:53] and i'll chase it all around the church
[1:55:55] until it comes right back where we
[1:55:56] started from
[1:55:58] but we have to deal with it i don't want
[1:56:00] that young man that's my son but i do
[1:56:02] not want him believing that he's going
[1:56:03] to heaven because his daddy's a preacher
[1:56:05] i do not want him ever believing because
[1:56:07] he was raised in church that's a ticket
[1:56:09] to heaven
[1:56:11] i want him knowing he's met christ
[1:56:18] you think these kids
[1:56:19] understand as much as brother byler
[1:56:22] nope the man studies day in and day out
[1:56:25] they'll probably never have the
[1:56:27] understanding maybe their pastor well
[1:56:29] well you can't the prophet of god said
[1:56:30] it
[1:56:31] can't grow no higher than your pastor
[1:56:33] god will take that gift and keep
[1:56:34] elevating him in the word keep bringing
[1:56:36] you up and bringing you up it's a gift
[1:56:38] that's put there or brother bran or any
[1:56:39] of these other brothers that's called a
[1:56:41] god to preach
[1:56:42] god puts that gift in them
[1:56:44] and that gift to open up the word so
[1:56:46] they can open it up to you
[1:56:48] so that's god's channel
[1:56:50] but i don't want him depending on
[1:56:52] knowledge
[1:56:54] i want him to know christ
[1:56:57] then if he knows christ and the holy
[1:56:59] spirit get on the inside and just lead
[1:57:02] and guide him on altar and guess what we
[1:57:04] all don't grow at the same pace
[1:57:08] that's what i said the other night this
[1:57:09] bible right here never ever ever ever
[1:57:13] puts a magnifying glass in your hand
[1:57:17] the only thing this bible does is put a
[1:57:19] mirror in your hand
[1:57:20] any young girl's got a mirror you got a
[1:57:22] mirror i figured you got it on you
[1:57:25] is it here
[1:57:26] any of you women got a mirror in the
[1:57:29] church
[1:57:30] do you
[1:57:32] lord god really nope no woman's got a
[1:57:34] mirror to check her face out before she
[1:57:36] goes into church
[1:57:38] how about you boys
[1:57:43] this bible is a mirror
[1:57:46] and when you look into the mirror of his
[1:57:47] word it don't show you everybody else it
[1:57:49] shows to yourself
[1:57:53] it's not a magnifying glass where you're
[1:57:55] looking checking everybody else out
[1:57:58] brother you had one
[1:58:00] oh
[1:58:06] you just stay right here then
[1:58:09] who you see
[1:58:10] me that's right
[1:58:14] hey don't get mad at that miracle that
[1:58:16] looks like what it looks like
[1:58:17] that's just you man you can be seated
[1:58:20] thank you
[1:58:21] who you see
[1:58:23] that's right who you see
[1:58:25] so you don't see me
[1:58:26] you only see yourself that's what this
[1:58:28] bible is every time you look into it
[1:58:31] you see yourself you don't see everybody
[1:58:32] else it's not a magnifying glass that i
[1:58:35] go around checking you out and
[1:58:37] seeing if your
[1:58:38] skirt is exactly right or
[1:58:40] let me check them heels out see if
[1:58:42] they're right
[1:58:46] there flat as they can get you're all
[1:58:47] right
[1:58:49] [Laughter]
[1:58:51] even though we know the prophet preached
[1:58:52] that
[1:58:54] what the man of god does is just obey
[1:58:56] the holy spirit preach what god's put on
[1:58:57] his heart and let the holy spirit work
[1:59:00] on people let god look at their god you
[1:59:02] say well i'm gonna check what you can
[1:59:04] change them but that don't mean they're
[1:59:05] gonna stay changed
[1:59:09] you know i saved a lot of people
[1:59:12] i did i've saved people
[1:59:14] and guess where they're at tonight this
[1:59:16] morning back out in the world
[1:59:18] when we save them they'll go back out
[1:59:21] when he saves them he seals them in the
[1:59:23] christ
[1:59:28] well i convinced so-and-so to believe
[1:59:29] the message don't worry somebody's
[1:59:31] smarter than you
[1:59:33] somebody come along and talk them out of
[1:59:34] it
[1:59:35] you talk them in they'll talk them out
[1:59:37] god reveals it to you nobody's talked
[1:59:39] you in nobody will talk you out god
[1:59:41] revealed it to you but holy ghost
[1:59:45] this word is a mirror where we look in
[1:59:48] and we ask god to change us
[1:59:51] verse corinthians you can read it
[1:59:53] sometimes 13.
[1:59:55] let me give this to you
[1:59:59] brother bam says now everybody can't be
[2:00:01] a preacher

[2:00:10] a preacher you're called to the pulpit
[2:00:12] to preach

[2:00:15] you're still a preacher but you live the
[2:00:17] people of sermon
[2:00:20] look i'm not going to be really too
[2:00:22] harsh
[2:00:24] but this spirit that's floating around
[2:00:26] our message and i'm a hey i've been like
[2:00:28] the other day i was in jeffersonville

[2:01:42] in the five-fold ministry we call it the
[2:01:44] five-fold ministry we don't get offended

[2:02:04] ain't got no rights to hand the word and
[2:02:06] get in the pool because you got money
[2:02:07] money is not the qualification or wealth
[2:02:10] is not the quality to be called to
[2:02:11] preach

[2:02:28] how
[2:02:29] live your sermon let the sermon be lived

[2:03:01] live it too and if he can't live it then
[2:03:03] you stop preaching it but you're
[2:03:04] supposed to live your sermon
[2:03:07] now watch all right here was voices oh
[2:03:13] how we need in jeffersonville thousands
[2:03:16] of lived voices
[2:03:18] the thunder of god thundering out in
[2:03:20] sweetness and holiness and purity
[2:03:22] undefiled lives walking around on earth
[2:03:23] today without a blemish yes sir real
[2:03:26] christians
[2:03:27] that's thunder against the enemy the
[2:03:29] devil don't care how loud you holler the
[2:03:31] devil don't care how much you can jump
[2:03:34] up and how you can do this and do that
[2:03:36] or shout but what hurts the devil is to
[2:03:39] see a sanctified holy life consecrate to
[2:03:42] god
[2:03:43] say anything to him call him anything
[2:03:45] just as sweet as he can be move right on
[2:03:47] oh my that throws him away that's the
[2:03:50] thunder that shakes the devil
[2:03:54] you know what he's talking about he goes
[2:03:56] on to tell it and he's talking about
[2:03:58] living epistles
[2:04:02] known
[2:04:03] and read of all men
[2:04:06] there's people out here that will never
[2:04:08] pick up their bible but they will
[2:04:11] read their bible in you because you're a
[2:04:13] living sacrifice
[2:04:16] god takes you and writes with the finger
[2:04:18] hold god he writes up on the tables of a
[2:04:21] fleshy heart and you become god's word
[2:04:23] in manifestation
[2:04:26] you remember the apostles
[2:04:28] and that 120 when they went up in the
[2:04:30] upper room let me hurry they went out of
[2:04:32] that upper room they went up her brother
[2:04:34] and said cowards
[2:04:37] peter went up there and just a few days
[2:04:40] prior he denied our lord
[2:04:43] some months before that he pulled a
[2:04:45] sword out to take a man's ear off others
[2:04:48] said call down thunder
[2:04:50] lightning from heaven and kill them
[2:04:53] but when they went in that upper room
[2:04:56] they waited
[2:04:58] on the holy ghost and that killer of
[2:05:00] fire broke itself up and come in there
[2:05:03] like a russian mighty wind set up on
[2:05:05] that to one of them and they were all
[2:05:06] filled up holy ghost the prophet said
[2:05:08] out the doors and they went windows they
[2:05:10] went acting like a bunch of drunks
[2:05:12] you say oh we know they got it they were
[2:05:15] drunk we know they got it they shot it
[2:05:16] we know they got it they were speaking
[2:05:17] in other languages wait a second what
[2:05:20] was the real evidence that they had it
[2:05:22] i'll tell you what it was
[2:05:23] peter stood up
[2:05:25] when they said these men are drunk he
[2:05:27] said they are not drunk as you suppose
[2:05:29] but this is that the real evidence was
[2:05:32] they was unable to identify what
[2:05:35] scriptures was being interpreted for
[2:05:36] that hour
[2:05:38] and you know what he wasn't just quoting
[2:05:40] the scripture he didn't have to open the
[2:05:42] bible and say this look here it is here
[2:05:44] it is all he had to do was point out 120
[2:05:46] and say this is that these people right
[2:05:49] here is joel's prophecy being
[2:05:51] interpreted they're they're god's
[2:05:53] prophecy this day in manifestation they
[2:05:56] may never wreck joel's prophecy but when
[2:05:58] they saw them people come out of that
[2:06:00] upper room stabbed him like a bunch of
[2:06:02] drunk people filled the holy ghost there
[2:06:03] was joel's prophecy in manifestation let
[2:06:06] me just say this there's people that'll
[2:06:08] never read
[2:06:09] my count 4 they won't read revelation 10
[2:06:12] 7 they won't read these scriptures but
[2:06:14] you realize sitting right here this
[2:06:16] morning it's a group of people that is
[2:06:18] malachi 4 you said no no brother madam's
[2:06:20] mother cat 4 5 i know that he's lied to
[2:06:23] the prophet but then it said but he
[2:06:25] shall turn the hearts of the children
[2:06:27] back to the faith of the apostolic
[2:06:28] father sitting right here is malachi 4
[2:06:31] and 6 in human flesh brother and could
[2:06:34] say this day this scripture is fulfilled
[2:06:36] and he quotes malachi 4 but you and i
[2:06:38] can stand here today and say malachi 4
[2:06:41] and 6. this day that scripture is being
[2:06:43] fulfilled
[2:06:47] god's word
[2:06:49] being interpreted in you
[2:06:51] not listen i'll just say like brother
[2:06:53] baby said not dead letter
[2:06:56] but a living sacrifice
[2:06:59] come on
[2:07:00] i'm talking about god
[2:07:02] living in you and you becoming
[2:07:04] a living sacrifice i miss it this way
[2:07:06] the word
[2:07:08] made flesh
[2:07:10] and dwelt among us
[2:07:13] acts 2 38 in flesh
[2:07:18] confessing repentance give you
[2:07:20] granted you
[2:07:21] repentance unto life
[2:07:24] brought down when you're confronted with
[2:07:26] the holy spirit conviction came
[2:07:28] and what happened god did sorrow work
[2:07:31] repentance not to be repented of
[2:07:33] the goodness of god the mercies of god
[2:07:36] does what leads man to repentance
[2:07:40] right
[2:07:41] then you're water baptized
[2:07:43] in the name of the lord jesus christ an
[2:07:45] act of obedience
[2:07:47] brother ben said when that candidate
[2:07:48] comes to the top of the water the holy
[2:07:50] ghost is there to meet it amen to fill
[2:07:52] it with the holy ghost let me tell what
[2:07:54] it is that's a sign that god has
[2:07:57] accepted your faith
[2:08:01] now
[2:08:03] let me go just a tad further for a
[2:08:04] minute because we're talking about
[2:08:06] living sacrifices it's essential it's
[2:08:08] essential
[2:08:10] in the old testament jews life was to
[2:08:12] present a presentation of a sacrifice as
[2:08:15] an indication of the genuineness of
[2:08:17] their faith
[2:08:18] the central act of the new covenant that
[2:08:20] means the new testament new covenant
[2:08:21] believer is a presentation not of an
[2:08:24] animal but of his heart his soul his
[2:08:26] mind and his body all that he is as a
[2:08:29] living
[2:08:30] sacrifice
[2:08:32] and what are the sacrifices of god here
[2:08:35] they come a broken spirit
[2:08:38] a broken and a contrite heart
[2:08:41] oh god that will not despise
[2:08:44] my prayer be sent forth before he is an
[2:08:46] instant the lifting up of my hands as an
[2:08:48] evening sacrifice
[2:08:51] christ died at calvary
[2:08:54] god poured upon him the justice of god
[2:08:57] man fell in the garden of eden
[2:08:59] justice went walking
[2:09:02] justice walked all the way until it met
[2:09:03] christ at calvary god poured the sins of
[2:09:05] the whole world him and the scripture
[2:09:07] said and it pleased the lord
[2:09:09] to bruise him and he made his soul an
[2:09:12] offering for sin
[2:09:14] that day at calvary god took full
[2:09:16] responsibility for every man and woman
[2:09:19] and if you die you die with christ
[2:09:22] when you when he raised we raise with
[2:09:24] him
[2:09:25] when he has sinned in the present god
[2:09:27] the probably god said we are sending
[2:09:28] with him
[2:09:29] he said we said now in heavenly places
[2:09:32] in christ jesus
[2:09:34] now he's there and we're here
[2:09:37] let me tie it together now
[2:09:41] they said the day that brother bradham
[2:09:44] baptized down on the ohio river
[2:09:48] sister branham where that time was his
[2:09:50] babysitter
[2:09:52] standing on the
[2:09:53] banks there
[2:09:55] in jeffersonville and
[2:09:58] when what transpired they left and
[2:09:59] brother branham had to ask her later did
[2:10:01] you see that light she said no bill
[2:10:05] no i didn't see it you told us to bow
[2:10:06] our heads
[2:10:08] so but did you hear the voice he said
[2:10:10] well sure bill i heard the voice but it
[2:10:12] was your voice
[2:10:15] now i know our mentality is or some
[2:10:17] voice thundered out there
[2:10:19] there wasn't some voice out there was
[2:10:20] that prophet that was saying
[2:10:22] speaking it out that's who they heard
[2:10:25] you know why because in heaven he's your
[2:10:27] voice
[2:10:29] but on earth
[2:10:31] you're his voice
[2:10:33] he represents you there
[2:10:36] and you represent him here
[2:10:38] [Applause]
[2:10:41] if god has a voice on earth today you're
[2:10:44] his voice
[2:10:47] if god's got eyes on earth today you're
[2:10:50] his eyes if he's got ears you're his
[2:10:53] ears
[2:10:53] brother said god walking around in you
[2:10:56] in two feet
[2:11:00] because you become a living that's what
[2:11:03] i keep driving home you become a lim
[2:11:05] young people take what you got this
[2:11:07] weekend you walk out in the world you go
[2:11:08] back to school you go to your college
[2:11:10] you go to your job you need to realize
[2:11:12] that if anybody's ever going to be
[2:11:14] christ to this world it's you you
[2:11:16] represent him as a living sacrifice
[2:11:20] and you're not trying
[2:11:22] to argue theology
[2:11:25] you're not trying to out debate
[2:11:27] everybody
[2:11:28] you're trying to portray christ as a
[2:11:32] living
[2:11:33] being a life the holy ghost
[2:11:39] you believe that say man
[2:11:43] redemption
[2:11:45] let me give this to you before i close
[2:11:49] absolutely
[2:11:51] great
[2:11:52] was the work of creation
[2:11:55] but greater
[2:11:57] is the work of redemption
[2:12:00] that's right it didn't cost god anything
[2:12:02] to create you
[2:12:04] but it cost him everything to redeem you
[2:12:08] the scripture said he created it with
[2:12:10] his finger but he redeemed you with his
[2:12:13] arm
[2:12:15] what happened
[2:12:17] man in the beginning as a spirit man
[2:12:20] brother bam said he led the animal life
[2:12:22] the way the holy spirit lives there
[2:12:23] today
[2:12:24] god and man had perfect fellowship right
[2:12:26] there
[2:12:28] then there was no man who told the
[2:12:29] ground god took the dust the earth and
[2:12:31] put
[2:12:32] had him in that body breathed man became
[2:12:35] a
[2:12:36] living soul
[2:12:38] god again had perfect fellowship with
[2:12:41] man
[2:12:42] man's trouble listen
[2:12:44] man's trouble was never in genesis 1.
[2:12:48] brother thomas the fall would have never
[2:12:51] happened if adam would stay in the form
[2:12:53] that he was in in genesis 1.
[2:12:56] the trouble come
[2:12:58] when he was put in flesh
[2:13:01] that's right
[2:13:02] then god took a rib from the side of not
[2:13:05] a spirit he took a rib from a man's body
[2:13:09] and made he a woman and brother bam said
[2:13:10] it was a byproduct off the original
[2:13:12] creation
[2:13:14] am i right took the phenomenal spirit
[2:13:16] put it in her
[2:13:18] and there stood in perfect fellowship
[2:13:20] had in his wife but the fall happened
[2:13:22] when they were in flesh what happened
[2:13:24] when the fall happened
[2:13:26] man separated himself from god
[2:13:29] all of a sudden god came down adam
[2:13:32] adam where are you
[2:13:35] god never had to ask that before brother
[2:13:37] said that light would come down into the
[2:13:39] garden they would hear a roar look over
[2:13:41] the tree and he said there would be a
[2:13:43] light around that tree he said they
[2:13:44] would hear roar that was jehovah talking
[2:13:46] to them said adam would take eve by the
[2:13:48] hand and they go over there by that tree
[2:13:50] and they'd have church in the evening
[2:13:52] time
[2:13:54] god and man and perfect fellowship
[2:13:57] then our bodies were made up to the
[2:13:59] animal life
[2:14:01] satan creeps in under the walls of the
[2:14:03] word in the garden of eden and
[2:14:05] vicariously through the serpent which is
[2:14:07] animal life which was what our bodies
[2:14:09] were made in the image of you go get it
[2:14:11] question answered exactly what he said
[2:14:13] and then the serpent came to the
[2:14:15] byproduct the woman
[2:14:18] and then she fell
[2:14:20] you know the story
[2:14:21] i'm gonna tell you why she fell
[2:14:23] she took sensation over revelation
[2:14:28] he introduced to her a new way to
[2:14:30] produce these names this is the way
[2:14:32] we'll do it and he introduced to her
[2:14:34] pleasure
[2:14:36] sensation
[2:14:38] through sensation she produced something
[2:14:40] that was not in the will of god
[2:14:44] that's right
[2:14:46] why do you think christ come
[2:14:48] because there came another woman 4 000
[2:14:50] years ago
[2:14:51] that didn't take sensation she took
[2:14:53] revelation
[2:14:55] and said be it unto me according to our
[2:14:57] word and when she did by the creator
[2:14:59] like the god in her womb jesus came
[2:15:03] that's what should have happened in the
[2:15:04] garden of eden
[2:15:06] mary took since excuse me eve took
[2:15:08] sensation over revelation mary took
[2:15:10] revelation over sensation
[2:15:13] brother man said god never did give mary
[2:15:15] a sensation
[2:15:16] he took both egg and sperm and created
[2:15:19] himself a body
[2:15:23] god came down lifting the body now what
[2:15:24] happens this give me five minutes and
[2:15:26] i'll go
[2:15:27] what happened when man fell
[2:15:29] now brother bam i'm gonna tell you what
[2:15:30] he said all that adam lost jesus
[2:15:32] restored
[2:15:35] and this might be
[2:15:36] hard to swallow but right now i don't
[2:15:38] know how many people's in this building
[2:15:39] but when this service is over they ought
[2:15:41] to be a bunch of little jesus that walk
[2:15:42] out of here
[2:15:45] little christ little anointed ones
[2:15:48] individuals young people with god in
[2:15:50] them out of here
[2:15:53] and you go out there with an
[2:15:54] understanding that if god is going to
[2:15:55] express himself to the world it has to
[2:15:57] be through me i am his living not a dead
[2:16:00] i am his living sacrifice
[2:16:02] sacrifice already died to represent me
[2:16:05] that's jesus
[2:16:06] i'm identified with him and when i
[2:16:08] identify with him now the life of that
[2:16:10] sacrifice comes back on me it takes a
[2:16:13] dead man to make a living man out of him
[2:16:15] and i go out here as a living sacrifice
[2:16:17] representing the lord jesus christ
[2:16:21] my actions my life the way i live and
[2:16:23] what i talk what i do
[2:16:25] the way i handle my business the way i
[2:16:28] conduct myself in school and i don't
[2:16:30] cheat and i don't lie and i don't do all
[2:16:32] these things and that should be an
[2:16:34] expression that comes out of heart
[2:16:35] that's been regenerated
[2:16:41] but what happened
[2:16:43] well
[2:16:44] when adam fell being the
[2:16:47] abstract tied to the holder to the
[2:16:49] earth when he failed he lost the
[2:16:51] abstract title d it went back in the
[2:16:53] hands of original owner almighty god and
[2:16:55] the earth went into the hands of satan
[2:16:57] and brother of them said satan filthy
[2:16:59] hands could not take that book and went
[2:17:00] back to the hand of the owner and when
[2:17:02] it went back it sat there waiting on
[2:17:04] redemption claims
[2:17:06] now god was a spirit he had the book why
[2:17:08] didn't he redeem the book of spirit
[2:17:09] because it wasn't a spirit that lost the
[2:17:11] book it was a man that lost the book so
[2:17:13] it's got to be a man to redeem the book
[2:17:17] what happens in revelation 5 revelation
[2:17:20] 5 all of a sudden we see one settlement
[2:17:22] thrown in his hand was a book
[2:17:25] if he spirit wasn't he claiming because
[2:17:26] adam didn't lose in the spirit lawson as
[2:17:28] a man so we've been waiting on a man to
[2:17:30] come and redeem this book so god had to
[2:17:32] change his mass from spirit to become a
[2:17:33] man and he did it in the person of
[2:17:35] christ
[2:17:37] and all of a sudden john began to weep
[2:17:39] because there was no m-a-n man found
[2:17:41] worthy heaven earth under the earth and
[2:17:44] then one of the voices said john we not
[2:17:46] behold the line the tribe dude after
[2:17:47] villains and i turned and see a lot and
[2:17:49] i saw a lamb that had been bloody blood
[2:17:51] and blood had been slain but then said
[2:17:52] he come out from behind the throne what
[2:17:54] what's the drama what's the scene god
[2:17:56] changes math now god is a man here's a
[2:17:58] man that's conquered death held in the
[2:18:00] grave since black father he's the one
[2:18:02] that's got the right to take the book a
[2:18:03] man lost it so a man's got to redeem it
[2:18:08] and when he redeemed that book
[2:18:10] he redeemed every name in that book
[2:18:15] revelation 5 he redeemed the book
[2:18:18] but in revelation 10 he descended from
[2:18:19] heaven with an open book
[2:18:22] saying there's mysteries in that book
[2:18:24] yeah and you was in that book because
[2:18:25] your identity your name is identified
[2:18:27] with that mystery
[2:18:28] and today sitting right here look i'm
[2:18:31] just going to say it like it is
[2:18:32] when we are send back to meet jesus
[2:18:35] we ain't going to hand him a book
[2:18:38] you're going to hand him he's going to
[2:18:40] be presented with the names that was in
[2:18:42] that book
[2:18:44] the word is being made flesh in you
[2:18:47] the revelation this hour is in his
[2:18:49] church it's in his people he writes it
[2:18:52] upon your heart
[2:18:56] that's what we got to get hold of
[2:18:58] in every expression let me say it all
[2:19:01] the rules i got to go all the rules that
[2:19:04] people want to make it's a shame
[2:19:07] and we've taken a message that god has
[2:19:09] given us in this day and made it
[2:19:11] rulebook out of it
[2:19:14] and all you do when you make a rule book
[2:19:16] out this message you will have people
[2:19:19] that live one thing but their heart is
[2:19:21] different
[2:19:24] god be merciful on us
[2:19:26] to cause people to live their whole
[2:19:28] lives outwardly being one thing but
[2:19:30] generally something else is there and
[2:19:32] that's the reason today please forgive
[2:19:34] me just for a second but that's when you
[2:19:36] see people walking away today
[2:19:38] walking away today it's because the
[2:19:40] truth is they live by rules but their
[2:19:42] hearts have never came in contact with
[2:19:44] christ
[2:19:48] on any of it including me shame on me if
[2:19:50] all i'm interested is bringing people to
[2:19:53] rules and regulations
[2:19:55] and not getting them to christ
[2:19:57] i don't want something manufactured i
[2:19:59] tell you boys there's a genuine holy
[2:20:02] ghost there's a genuine christ that gets
[2:20:04] on the inside and you will like i told
[2:20:07] you won't do this i i told this boy that
[2:20:09] you borrow my commit no it's wonderful
[2:20:12] the day that when
[2:20:13] your mom and daddy and i'm not saying
[2:20:15] they would but i'm just saying and when
[2:20:17] god gives it to you your mom and dad
[2:20:18] will walk away there'll be an inside
[2:20:20] power that keeps you
[2:20:22] because you ain't saved cause mom and
[2:20:23] daddy said you met christ for yourself
[2:20:26] he's come down on the inside of you and
[2:20:28] you become a living tabernacle for
[2:20:31] living god to dwell in
[2:20:38] let me read this to you
[2:20:39] i wish i had more time but
[2:20:43] it just is what it is
[2:20:46] brother branham said
[2:20:48] when a man possesses these kind of
[2:20:49] things the holy ghost comes upon him
[2:20:52] no matter you might speak with tongues
[2:20:53] you might impersonate any gift god's god
[2:20:56] you might do that but until these
[2:20:57] virtues go in there
[2:20:59] you're still off the real foundation of
[2:21:00] faith and when these virtues go in
[2:21:02] you're added to that then you're a
[2:21:03] living
[2:21:05] monument
[2:21:07] listen this you're a living
[2:21:10] moving idle
[2:21:15] my when i was a boy
[2:21:19] this day what they taught me
[2:21:22] they taught me i could fast enough
[2:21:26] for god
[2:21:27] to see all my fasting and he would
[2:21:30] let me see angels
[2:21:32] not have visitation manuals i've been to
[2:21:34] the mountains of west virginia
[2:21:36] i fasted 21 days straight
[2:21:39] faster 28 days straight i've been on a
[2:21:41] 40 day fast i fasted 30 days never went
[2:21:43] a week without fasting fats and so much
[2:21:46] i ruined my eyes
[2:21:47] as a young man starving myself thinking
[2:21:50] harry find god
[2:21:53] about the only visions i ever had along
[2:21:55] fast was the clouds looked like mashed
[2:21:56] potatoes
[2:21:58] i kid you not
[2:22:00] i'd get so hungry looking at the sky
[2:22:03] said angle ever come to you well i could
[2:22:05] tell you one night in a little place
[2:22:07] called douglas georgia
[2:22:09] laying in a bed
[2:22:11] yeah there was a man that stood the edge
[2:22:13] into my bed
[2:22:14] but i can tell you now it was not an
[2:22:16] angel it was a demon
[2:22:18] he was dressed in a black suit he stood
[2:22:20] there and he talked to me when he was
[2:22:22] done with me told me nobody cared i was
[2:22:24] wasting my time and ought to commit
[2:22:26] that's his words you ought to commit
[2:22:28] suicide
[2:22:29] he stood the end of my bed
[2:22:32] i never could understand that quite the
[2:22:35] way it should have been understood until
[2:22:36] i come to this message
[2:22:38] and i hear a man that did fast but not
[2:22:41] like that he taught me that them things
[2:22:43] were enticing spirits of the devil
[2:22:46] no bible he said for men to go along
[2:22:49] fast
[2:22:51] shave my head one time bald
[2:22:54] went home my mother was so upset what in
[2:22:56] the world i sit in a barbie chair in a
[2:22:58] little place in middle florida near
[2:23:00] calif ocala florida got in the barber
[2:23:02] chair the woman said i said cut it off
[2:23:04] she said what
[2:23:06] i said cut it off she said are you
[2:23:08] joining army i said i just joined it i'm
[2:23:09] in it
[2:23:12] she said really i said yes shave it up
[2:23:13] i'm starting my army of the lord
[2:23:16] she shaved it off and i went home
[2:23:18] my mother saw you know what i thought if
[2:23:20] i shaved my head i killed pride
[2:23:25] i had a sackcloth outfit
[2:23:27] laid in sackcloth and burned ashes and
[2:23:29] rubbed it on my bald head
[2:23:31] for three days laid in a room wouldn't
[2:23:33] come out
[2:23:35] you know when i come off him fast i had
[2:23:37] just as much pride as i did before i
[2:23:39] started
[2:23:41] had just much temper as i did before i
[2:23:43] started i was still angry like i always
[2:23:45] was still had a fighting spirit like i
[2:23:47] always did
[2:23:49] and what i found out it's not all the
[2:23:51] rituals and all the fast and all that
[2:23:53] kind of and that's all fine and good but
[2:23:55] i'm just telling you that cannot be a
[2:23:57] substitute for meeting a real christ
[2:24:02] one day at 18 years old tipton georgia
[2:24:04] preached a little tip meeting a young
[2:24:06] man come and set that service invited me
[2:24:08] to his house when i went to his house he
[2:24:11] introduced me to the message and i got
[2:24:12] brother bam's tapes and i'm telling you
[2:24:15] something happened
[2:24:17] something took place
[2:24:19] things that i've wondered about my whole
[2:24:21] life things i could not comprehend how i
[2:24:24] watched me and standing on the platform
[2:24:26] on my eyes up and make me watch them
[2:24:28] cast out devils
[2:24:31] watch blinded eyes open of a little
[2:24:33] black girl and she read aside and she
[2:24:35] never could read i watched with these
[2:24:37] two eyes make me stand there and watch
[2:24:39] that make me steady keep your eyes open
[2:24:41] watch me catch this devil out
[2:24:45] and i stand and watch it knowing the man
[2:24:47] that's making me standing and watching
[2:24:49] has done left his wife run off with
[2:24:50] another woman left her rubbed another
[2:24:52] woman but he was still cast out devils
[2:24:54] and healing the sick

[2:25:02] people he called me out of babylon this
[2:25:04] message didn't confuse me it unconfused
[2:25:06] me

[2:25:16] had
[2:25:17] one sermon called anointed was in the
[2:25:19] end time answered every question i had
[2:25:22] on my heart back there in the
[2:25:23] pentecostal church
[2:25:26] god i couldn't go back
[2:25:28] i couldn't go back and argue with them
[2:25:30] preachers i tried
[2:25:32] and all they did was mocked and made fun
[2:25:36] one man i was close to i've been on him
[2:25:39] with on a 40-day fast rode in the car
[2:25:40] with him
[2:25:42] well i ate he would not eat i was with
[2:25:45] him
[2:25:45] traveling in the ministry no he didn't
[2:25:47] touch a bite of food and watch him stand
[2:25:49] up watched him one night matter of fact
[2:25:51] i was in a hotel room with him
[2:25:53] and i'm just trying to
[2:25:54] show you that you can approach this to
[2:25:56] religion you can approach this through
[2:25:58] rituals and and i know you understand
[2:26:00] what i'm saying this message is not
[2:26:02] rules it's not regulation it's not a
[2:26:04] bunch of creeds it's not just just a
[2:26:06] rule book to you it's a life it's living
[2:26:09] it's the holy ghost it's eternal god
[2:26:11] when he gets in you you become a living
[2:26:13] sacrifice him you walk around as
[2:26:15] representing god to the world
[2:26:20] i stood in this car going out to
[2:26:22] harrison arkansas got in a hotel one
[2:26:24] night
[2:26:25] he i laid on the bed he laid on the side
[2:26:28] on the floor with his head against the
[2:26:29] bed and the man wept all night long
[2:26:34] and i'll be honest as a little boy in my
[2:26:37] mind 17 years old 16 70 years old i
[2:26:40] thought when is he ever going to stop
[2:26:41] when he quit
[2:26:43] literally got tired of hearing a man cry
[2:26:47] that next night got up that morning
[2:26:50] he goes to bed not go outside
[2:26:52] come back in the middle of the day he's
[2:26:54] back crying again go to the church that
[2:26:55] night he's starting to poop in he's
[2:26:57] weeping as a young man sitting on the
[2:26:58] back row i saw him the crowd about 300
[2:27:01] he went to weeping again
[2:27:03] so why is he crying like that
[2:27:06] he told that young man said god came to
[2:27:08] me last night
[2:27:10] told me tonight is your night he'll
[2:27:11] never deal with you again if you don't
[2:27:13] come tonight in three days
[2:27:15] they'll call me and ask me to bury you
[2:27:17] this is your night your last opportunity
[2:27:19] to come to christ that boy sat there
[2:27:21] with his hands folded shook his head
[2:27:23] refused to listen to what that preacher
[2:27:24] had to say
[2:27:28] i kid you not we left the
[2:27:30] house in florida on the third day you
[2:27:32] got a call from that pastor said would
[2:27:34] you come back that boy you spoke that
[2:27:36] night he died in the car wreck we want
[2:27:38] you to preach the funeral he said i will
[2:27:39] not do it
[2:27:41] i watch god use men like that
[2:27:45] he told me one night down there in east
[2:27:47] point florida on top on a platform with
[2:27:50] his head praying against a oregon bench
[2:27:52] the back door opened up he told me he
[2:27:55] said this he didn't know i didn't know
[2:27:57] anything about brother batman he said
[2:27:58] the back door opened up and a man walked
[2:28:00] in
[2:28:02] he said you ever heard of william
[2:28:03] branham
[2:28:04] no sir don't know who he is said he
[2:28:06] appeared to me i said he did yeah he
[2:28:08] said but i believe he had a message for
[2:28:10] me but fear struck me and he disappeared
[2:28:12] i said oh i just let it go i didn't know
[2:28:13] nothing about what he was talking about
[2:28:15] didn't know if it was true or not
[2:28:17] but a year later i meet a man by the
[2:28:20] name william branham's tapes
[2:28:23] and i get the books and i drive to
[2:28:24] jeffersonville i get all the tapes and
[2:28:26] the books i can and i'm so happy i can't
[2:28:28] wait to get back down there to crawford
[2:28:30] mills florida to take this message to
[2:28:31] this cert cert same individual when i
[2:28:34] got there i started telling i found
[2:28:36] the message that you thought we oh no no
[2:28:38] no no and when i started tip up the
[2:28:40] message he started mocking a cloud he
[2:28:42] started mocking this and i said how in
[2:28:44] the world can men be anointed to do all
[2:28:46] that and they turn down the word
[2:28:52] how in the world can they do that how
[2:28:53] could it be so annoyed and deny the word
[2:28:56] of god
