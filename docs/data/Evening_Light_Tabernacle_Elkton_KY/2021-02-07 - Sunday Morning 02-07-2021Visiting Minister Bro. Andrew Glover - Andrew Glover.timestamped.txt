[35:36] brother russell on them here we've asked
[35:37] him to heal
[35:38] come and sing this morning
[36:09] always glad to be greeted his family my
[36:11] brother david
[36:13] you feel that way some disadvantages of
[36:16] that
[36:16] when you're a guest everybody treats you
[36:18] really nice when your family maybe they
[36:19] don't but
[36:21] you can still treat us nice we'll be
[36:23] fine
[36:25] for the david i need to know that when i
[36:26] come here he's going to ask me to sing
[36:28] be prepared but i never am but i'll just
[36:30] remind you of an old hymn this morning
[36:32] wrote in 1863 on christ the solid rock i
[36:35] stand but
[36:36] this came so real to me just a couple
[36:38] months ago we were here and at the
[36:40] church
[36:41] but i'm speaking on perfection and i
[36:44] thought this is a quote i should print
[36:45] and just have it on the fridge it's kind
[36:46] of one of those cornerstone
[36:48] quotes brother branham and then it just
[36:51] brought to my mind this song that my
[36:53] hope is built on nothing less than jesus
[36:55] blood and righteousness
[36:57] but abraham says that my salvation and
[36:59] yours tonight
[37:01] does not hinge upon the merits of our
[37:03] own acts
[37:06] it's hinged upon the posit positive
[37:08] sovereign grace of almighty god
[37:11] who has chosen us in him certainly i
[37:14] could
[37:15] never be perfect nor you could never be
[37:18] perfect and we don't claim to be perfect
[37:20] but we have this one consolation that
[37:23] our faith rests in a perfect sacrifice
[37:25] that's already been received amen
[37:29] my hopes built on nothing less
[37:36] keep f probably
[37:38] [Music]
[37:42] my hope is built on nothing less
[37:46] than jesus blood and righteousness
[37:51] i dare not trust the sweetest frame
[37:56] but holy on
[37:59] jesus name
[38:02] on christ the solid
[38:06] rock i stand all of the ground
[38:09] is sinking sand
[38:13] all other ground is sinking sand
[38:20] when darkness seems to hide his face
[38:24] i rest on his unchanging grace
[38:29] in every high and stormy gill
[38:34] my anchor holds within the veil
[38:39] his old his covenant
[38:42] and his blood support me
[38:46] in the well-mean flood
[38:49] when all around my soul gives way
[38:54] he then is all my hope and stay on
[39:00] christ the solid rochester and all of
[39:05] the ground is seeking
[39:08] sand all other ground
[39:13] sinking sand
[39:16] when he shall come with trumpet sound
[39:21] oh may i then in
[39:24] him be found dressed in his
[39:28] righteousness alone
[39:30] faultless to stand before the throne
[39:36] on christ the solid rock i
[39:40] stand all other ground is
[39:44] sinking sand
[39:47] all other ground is sinking
[39:52] [Laughter]

[46:28] quickly and
[46:29] romans the 15th chapter in the fifth
[46:31] verse
[46:33] the bible here says now the god of
[46:36] patience and consolation grant you to be
[46:40] like-minded one toward another
[46:42] according to christ jesus that you may
[46:46] be
[46:46] with one mind and notice here in one
[46:49] mouth
[46:51] glorify god even the father of our lord
[46:54] jesus christ
[46:56] so paul here is taking the mind and
[46:58] connecting it to the mouth and says
[47:00] that you may be with one mind and one
[47:03] mouth
[47:04] glorify so what you're thinking in your
[47:06] mind is going to come out of your mouth
[47:07] and paul here is saying
[47:09] whatever is in your mind then whatever
[47:10] comes out of your mouth let it be
[47:12] glorifying
[47:13] unto our father our lord jesus christ in
[47:16] the book of second timothy the first
[47:18] chapter
[47:19] ii timothy the first chapter
[47:23] and the 11th verse second timothy the
[47:26] first chapter
[47:28] and the 11th verse here
[47:31] paul here writing to timothy says we're
[47:34] unto i am appointed a preacher
[47:37] and an apostle and the teacher of the
[47:39] gentiles
[47:41] for the which calls i also suffer these
[47:44] things
[47:45] nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know
[47:49] whom i have believed is anybody here
[47:51] today can say i know whom i have
[47:53] believed
[47:54] and then persuaded that he is able to
[47:57] keep that which i have committed unto
[47:58] him against that day
[48:00] now notice this here in verse 13 hold
[48:03] fast
[48:04] the form of sound words which thou has
[48:08] heard of me
[48:09] in faith and love which is in christ
[48:11] jesus
[48:12] that the good thing which was committed
[48:14] unto thee keep
[48:16] by keep thee by the holy ghost
[48:19] which dwelleth in us we ask the lord
[48:22] this morning to add the blessing to the
[48:24] reading of his word
[48:25] as you may have your seats there for
[48:27] just a few moments this morning
[48:29] if the lord would help me i would like
[48:31] to speak to you from these verses here
[48:33] and maybe just to draw a
[48:34] title here out of the 13th verse paul
[48:36] says hold fast
[48:38] the form of some words which thou has
[48:41] heard of me in faith and love
[48:43] which is in christ jesus and i want to
[48:45] speak to you for just a few moments
[48:47] you're on hold fast
[48:48] the form of sound words hold fast the
[48:51] form of sound words i i think we're all
[48:54] very much aware this morning that we are
[48:55] living
[48:56] in uncertain times amen the world is
[48:59] full
[49:00] of uncertain times it's the problem of
[49:01] god like you call it a time
[49:03] of uncertainty you'll say that politics
[49:05] are uncertain religion is uncertain
[49:08] uh government is uncertain everything in
[49:10] the world we're living in
[49:11] is uncertain and when things become
[49:13] uncertain then people
[49:15] actually become uncertain themselves so
[49:17] it's not that the world is full of
[49:18] uncertainty
[49:19] but you've actually got a world full of
[49:21] uncertain people that's living in the
[49:23] middle of uncertainty and these people
[49:25] are actually looking for something
[49:26] they're looking for something to give
[49:28] them hope the prophet will say this way
[49:30] they're looking for something to hold on
[49:32] to they're looking for something
[49:34] that they can anchor their lives to now
[49:36] uh the
[49:37] prophet of god preaches a message called
[49:39] the uncertain sound
[49:40] in first corinthians 14 verse eight for
[49:42] if the trumpet
[49:44] give an uncertain sound then who shall
[49:46] prepare
[49:47] himself to the battle if the trumpet
[49:49] gives an uncertain
[49:50] sound then who is going to prepare
[49:52] himself to the battle now that word
[49:54] sound means a voice it means to be
[49:57] noised abroad
[49:58] it means the sound of uttered words put
[50:01] into speech so
[50:02] he's saying here if the trumpet gives an
[50:04] uncertain word or if the trumpet gives
[50:06] an uncertain noise or an uncertain sound
[50:09] amen then who can prepare himself to the
[50:11] battle now
[50:12] in 1960 says now this is a day of
[50:15] uncertainty can you say amen it said
[50:17] here
[50:18] if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[50:20] then who shall prepare himself for
[50:23] battle paul's speaking here of course he
[50:24] was speaking to these corinthians
[50:26] and many of them were soldiers in those
[50:28] days in the roman army
[50:30] now now if the trumpet gives an
[50:32] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[50:33] himself
[50:34] he said you've got to have the certainty
[50:36] of anything
[50:37] he said we've got to know whether it's
[50:40] right or not so
[50:41] if you're going to have something
[50:42] there's got to be a certainty there
[50:44] he said you've got to know whether it's
[50:46] right or not and now we're living in a
[50:47] day of great uncertainty
[50:49] we all know that the day of uncertainty
[50:51] and the time of uncertainty
[50:53] now i want you to catch what he says
[50:54] here i don't believe there ever was a
[50:57] time
[50:57] since the first time began back in the
[51:00] garden of eden when sin come in
[51:02] and broke eternity in the time i do not
[51:04] believe there's ever been a space of
[51:06] time
[51:07] with so much uncertainty as is today now
[51:10] think of that this is 1960
[51:12] and the prophet is saying there's never
[51:14] been a time amen
[51:15] all the way back to eden that there's
[51:17] been so much uncertainty in the land
[51:20] as there is today now let's fast forward
[51:22] from 1960 and come to 2021
[51:25] amen and think about how much more
[51:27] uncertainty there is today
[51:29] amen even than there was in 1916 he said
[51:32] there's not even one hope
[51:34] left in the natural world today there's
[51:36] not one hope amen
[51:38] amen now that that's pretty heavy and
[51:40] there's not one hope left in the world
[51:42] amen except jesus christ let me just let
[51:44] me just cut to the chase and say we are
[51:46] not here this morning
[51:48] amen listening to an uncertain sound we
[51:50] ain't that when we read our bible we are
[51:52] not reading an uncertain sound when we
[51:54] listen to a tape
[51:55] amen we are not reading an uncertain
[51:57] sound we are preparing
[51:59] amen by the most certain sound that is
[52:01] on the face of the earth today
[52:03] and let me tell you what it is it is the
[52:05] message of the hour amen
[52:07] ain't that every sound of denomination
[52:09] is uncertain ever
[52:10] every theologian is uncertain every
[52:13] preacher and then apart from this
[52:14] message is uncertain but god
[52:17] he then sent elijah in this age with a
[52:19] certain sound
[52:20] he meant to put a hope in the heart of
[52:22] his people let me say this this morning
[52:24] church the message of the hour has never
[52:26] changed
[52:26] amen and it will never change amen this
[52:29] message
[52:30] is jesus christ and there is nothing
[52:33] uncertain about him amen i'll say it
[52:36] like this we are not this morning as the
[52:38] church
[52:39] of the living god we are not in a
[52:41] national battle amen we
[52:43] we are not in a political battle i know
[52:45] sometimes it's hard
[52:46] even being americans and being amen
[52:48] loving this country and loving the
[52:50] nation you live in sometimes it's hard
[52:52] amen to separate amen what is your
[52:55] battle and what is not your battle but
[52:57] let me just say this
[52:58] amen there is absolutely nothing that we
[53:01] can do to change this nation
[53:04] amen we could go march around washington
[53:06] all day long
[53:07] and we'll never change nothing amen
[53:09] because prophecy has fallen upon this
[53:12] nation
[53:12] amen and when prophecy falls upon
[53:14] something it must come to pass
[53:16] amen let me say it like this prophecy
[53:18] has not just fallen upon this nation but
[53:21] prophecy
[53:22] amen is falling upon you amen prophecy
[53:24] is falling up on this nation that she's
[53:26] going to fall
[53:27] and she's going to bow to roman
[53:29] catholicism amen but there is another
[53:31] prophecy that is taller
[53:32] upon the church in these last days that
[53:35] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[53:37] we shall all be changed i'm talking this
[53:40] morning about something
[53:41] amen that is not uncertain it is a
[53:44] certain sound therefore our battles
[53:46] and national battles they are not
[53:48] political battles
[53:49] our battles are spiritual battles which
[53:54] which is the battle for truth amen we
[53:57] are not here this morning battling for
[53:59] something
[54:00] amen that is not at truth we are in the
[54:02] battle for truth the problem god will
[54:04] call it
[54:04] he'll say and in the battle for truth he
[54:07] said them ends it has been lost but god
[54:09] said
[54:10] they would be restored again in the last
[54:12] day
[54:13] i will restore saith the lord amen now
[54:16] let me say this our spiritual battles
[54:18] today what are they brother andrew well
[54:20] let me just give you a few of them the
[54:21] first one is
[54:22] amen to stay positive while surrounded
[54:25] by negativity
[54:26] amen another one is to stay sound while
[54:29] surrounded by unsoundness
[54:31] amen another one is to stay certain
[54:34] while surrounded by uncertainty
[54:36] amen to stay stable while surrounded by
[54:39] instability that is the battle
[54:41] amen that the church is in today proud
[54:44] of god was it like this but we are not
[54:45] cowards
[54:46] amen we are soldiers amen how many
[54:49] soldiers have we got here today
[54:51] amen we're not cowards we're not boy
[54:53] scouts we're not i mean we're not
[54:54] somebody just playing a battle
[54:56] we are soldiers and we didn't choose to
[54:58] be a soldier
[54:59] amen but he chose us to be a soldier in
[55:02] this battle before the foundation of the
[55:04] world
[55:05] he said see in second timothy 2 4 no man
[55:08] that worth
[55:08] amen entangled himself with the affairs
[55:11] of this life
[55:12] amen now let me say this if you're going
[55:13] to be a soldier and then you're going to
[55:15] have to separate yourself
[55:17] amen from everything in this world amen
[55:20] and realize who you
[55:21] are and realize what you're fighting for
[55:24] is that right amen now you think of a
[55:26] natural soldier when he goes and becomes
[55:28] a soldier the first thing they do
[55:30] is they change everything about him they
[55:32] change his identity
[55:33] they change the way he dresses they
[55:35] change the way he looks and amen they
[55:37] they do everything because
[55:39] they're separating him amen from the
[55:41] life that he has known
[55:43] amen and opening up a new life to him
[55:45] and i'll say it like this this message
[55:46] amen is a separation it's going to
[55:48] separate us
[55:50] amen from everything we've ever known
[55:52] amen and open our eyes to what is truth
[55:54] now he said that he may please him
[55:56] who have chosen him to be a soldier amen
[55:59] how many will agree that you've been
[56:01] chosen by god
[56:02] a meant to be a soldier you you this
[56:04] morning are chosen by the almighty god
[56:06] by
[56:07] by general jesus to be a soldier in the
[56:10] battle for truth we are
[56:11] in amen the army of god we we are in the
[56:15] army this morning church
[56:16] amen now you say i am a soldier what
[56:18] comes next well a soldier
[56:20] amen must find their position we hear a
[56:23] lot of preachers about that don't we
[56:24] got to find your position find your
[56:26] position amen but another thing is when
[56:29] you
[56:29] find your position amen you've got to
[56:31] hold it somebody say hold it
[56:34] you've got to hold it so it's not good
[56:36] enough just to find it
[56:37] amen but you've got to hold it you it's
[56:40] not good enough just to know who you are
[56:42] amen but there's got to come a stability
[56:44] there's got to come a certainty
[56:46] there's got to come a soundness amen to
[56:48] the soldier to be able to hold
[56:50] amen the position they're called to the
[56:52] prophet says this way
[56:53] the only thing he is waiting for is for
[56:56] his
[56:56] army to get their position like the
[56:59] stars
[57:00] and then get the position amen now we
[57:02] are in a spiritual battle what kind of
[57:04] battle between
[57:05] right and wrong he said that's right
[57:07] you've got to know the word stay on the
[57:09] word
[57:09] seek the great battle is at hand now
[57:12] we've played church for years and years
[57:14] but the hour has come now that when
[57:16] janice and chambers will withstand moses
[57:20] the hour you're living in is the hour
[57:23] when janice in chambers he says we'll
[57:25] withstand moses
[57:26] as the bible said they would and it's
[57:28] going to be a spiritual battle
[57:31] it's going to be a conflict there will
[57:33] be some just continue on
[57:35] the denominational church will just move
[57:37] on right into denomination
[57:38] and go the way it goes but i mean the
[57:40] real true believer
[57:42] is coming to the battlefield and you
[57:44] better be versed
[57:46] and know what you're doing or you could
[57:48] take an evil spirit
[57:49] so easy and not know it if it's contrary
[57:53] to the word
[57:54] then don't you believe it you stay with
[57:56] the word
[57:57] amen notice how close he's bringing this
[57:59] amen that in this battle it's going to
[58:01] be a battle of spirits
[58:03] and it's going to be a battle where you
[58:04] could so easily amen take an evil spirit
[58:07] and
[58:08] not even know it amen we wrestle not
[58:10] against flesh and blood
[58:11] but against principalities and against
[58:14] powers and against the rulers of the
[58:16] darkness of this world
[58:17] and against spiritual wickedness in high
[58:19] places now the bible says we're here
[58:21] tonight fighting a great warfare
[58:23] which is right that gets wrong amen the
[58:26] word of god
[58:26] against modern theology and trying to
[58:29] make the word of god
[58:30] and bring it to the people while the
[58:32] enemy will try to beset it
[58:35] in every way but one is the majority in
[58:38] god
[58:39] now think about that this morning amen
[58:42] one soldier is the majority in god
[58:44] right here this morning amen if one
[58:47] person needed healing
[58:48] and the entire building didn't believe
[58:50] in healing but one person began to fight
[58:53] against every unbelieving spirit amen
[58:56] that god would come down in this
[58:58] building
[58:58] and would fill that person with healing
[59:00] if there's one individual that wanted
[59:02] the holy ghost this morning
[59:04] and nobody in here believed in the holy
[59:06] ghost but one individual
[59:08] amen said god you made me a promise you
[59:10] would give me the holy ghost and god
[59:13] amen will tear down every demon amen to
[59:15] fill a heart with the holy ghost what
[59:17] are you saying
[59:18] i'm saying we're not here playing church
[59:20] we are in a battle this morning
[59:22] but let me say like this the angels of
[59:24] god
[59:25] are entemped about those that fear him
[59:27] and then the angels of god are here this
[59:30] morning
[59:30] amen pushing against coldness pushing
[59:32] against formalism
[59:34] pushing against demons why we are in a
[59:37] battle but one is the majority
[59:41] in god now amen do you realize you're
[59:43] living in a time
[59:44] where actually the bible prophesies of
[59:46] the time you're living in
[59:47] it's actually in matthew 24. the bible
[59:50] says that the elected
[59:51] amen would be deceived if it was
[59:53] possible but see it's not possible
[59:56] the father said watch how close it gets
[59:58] it gets that razor edge and then out
[1:00:00] between right and wrong
[1:00:02] and remember it'll fall on one or the
[1:00:04] other sides
[1:00:05] until it comes down sometimes like like
[1:00:08] a home
[1:00:08] razor between the difference of right
[1:00:11] and wrong
[1:00:12] it's got to be every word of god not
[1:00:15] just
[1:00:15] almost every word but every word and
[1:00:18] it's got down today
[1:00:19] he said not to the lutherans not to the
[1:00:21] methodists not the pentecostals
[1:00:23] amen but two that honed age
[1:00:27] amen that's a that's a powerful term
[1:00:29] amen it's gotten down today
[1:00:32] amen to that honed age amen now how many
[1:00:35] knows the prophet says
[1:00:37] amen there's been a lutheran age there's
[1:00:39] been a western age
[1:00:40] there's been a pentecostal age he said
[1:00:42] but now for the first time
[1:00:44] amen it's coming forth for pride amen
[1:00:46] the calling of a bride for what
[1:00:49] amen for a bride age amen here's another
[1:00:52] term
[1:00:52] or to a honed age what is that home age
[1:00:56] it's when not everything is going to go
[1:01:00] are you awake are you in me it's it's
[1:01:03] when
[1:01:03] everything is going to have to be judged
[1:01:06] by something
[1:01:07] amen see every spirit is not going to
[1:01:10] pass the word test
[1:01:11] amen every idea is not going to pass the
[1:01:14] word test
[1:01:15] he's saying we've come to that honed h
[1:01:18] in this age where the antichrist
[1:01:20] anointed it so perfectly
[1:01:22] it would deceive the very lack he said
[1:01:24] they'll fall on the wrong side
[1:01:26] if they don't watch it like a wedge he
[1:01:28] said watch
[1:01:29] and be careful we're not living in a
[1:01:32] pentecostal age
[1:01:33] now we've passed that age just the same
[1:01:36] as it passed lutheran seed amen we
[1:01:38] are living in a home owned age
[1:01:41] amen can i preach to you for a minute we
[1:01:43] are living in an age
[1:01:45] amen we're our lives amen there's no
[1:01:47] room for error
[1:01:48] we are living in an age where there is
[1:01:50] no room amen to back off of the
[1:01:52] principles of this message
[1:01:54] we are living in a time where there is
[1:01:56] no room
[1:01:57] ain't meant to let anything and
[1:01:59] everything go we have come to a time
[1:02:01] where we must judge all things or as
[1:02:03] paul says we must prove all things
[1:02:06] now the bible says here in first
[1:02:07] thessalonians 5 21
[1:02:09] it says prove all things and then notice
[1:02:11] these next two words
[1:02:12] and hold fast to that which is good
[1:02:16] so paul you're saying you've got to
[1:02:17] prove all things but when it's
[1:02:20] been proven what is good then hold fast
[1:02:23] to it
[1:02:24] now can i read the definition of the
[1:02:25] word hold fast it means to keep
[1:02:27] it means to possess it means to stay
[1:02:31] it means to take to retain amen from
[1:02:34] going away
[1:02:35] to restrain to hold or to head the ship
[1:02:38] it means to keep secure it means to keep
[1:02:41] firm possession of
[1:02:42] it means to get possession of so paul
[1:02:45] you're saying
[1:02:46] and then prove all things and get
[1:02:48] possession
[1:02:49] of what is good amen amen restrain
[1:02:52] what is good amen secure what is good
[1:02:56] now that word hold fast is used in
[1:02:57] different forms in the scripture
[1:02:59] like in luke 8 15 the bible says but
[1:03:02] that on the
[1:03:02] ground are they which in an honest and
[1:03:05] good heart
[1:03:06] having heard the word amen they keep it
[1:03:09] and bring forth fruit with patience now
[1:03:11] amen their whole fast is used as keep it
[1:03:14] so there's going to be a people
[1:03:15] who's going to hear the word and they're
[1:03:17] going to keep the word and they're going
[1:03:19] to bring forth fruit
[1:03:20] and acts 27 40 when they had taken up
[1:03:23] the anchors
[1:03:23] they committed themselves into the sea
[1:03:26] and they loosed the rudder bands
[1:03:27] and they hoisted up the main cell to the
[1:03:29] wind and they
[1:03:30] made toward the shore there and then the
[1:03:33] word hold fast
[1:03:34] is actually used as they made toward the
[1:03:37] shore
[1:03:38] in first corinthians 11 verse 1 be
[1:03:40] followers of me even as i also am of
[1:03:42] christ
[1:03:43] now i praise you brother that you
[1:03:45] remember me in all things
[1:03:47] and keep the ordinance somebody say keep
[1:03:49] the ordinances
[1:03:51] as i deliver them to you so there amen
[1:03:54] hold fast is used as
[1:03:56] keep the ordinances in first corinthians
[1:03:58] 15 1
[1:03:59] moreover brethren i declare unto you the
[1:04:01] gospel which i preached to you which
[1:04:03] also you received and wherein you stand
[1:04:06] by which also ye
[1:04:07] are saved if you keep in memory
[1:04:10] what i have preached unto you unless you
[1:04:13] have believed in vain so hear paul
[1:04:16] saying
[1:04:16] amen hold fast to that which i preached
[1:04:19] unto you
[1:04:20] and then keep it in your memory amen
[1:04:22] keep it even keep it there on your heart
[1:04:24] unless you would have heard it and then
[1:04:26] you would have believed on it and then
[1:04:28] you would have turned away from it and
[1:04:29] had believed
[1:04:30] in vain listen church amen i don't know
[1:04:32] how much more plainer to say it
[1:04:34] if there's ever been a time amen to take
[1:04:36] this message off the shelf
[1:04:38] if there's ever been a time and then to
[1:04:40] dust off her bibles and dust off them
[1:04:42] tapes
[1:04:43] i say now is the time there is not
[1:04:46] one thing happening in the world we're
[1:04:48] living in today but what this message
[1:04:50] has already warned the church of amen
[1:04:53] but i'll say it like this if this
[1:04:54] message
[1:04:55] ain't meant to warn us of destruction
[1:04:57] could warn us of nations
[1:04:58] could warn us of government failures
[1:05:00] could warn us of everything going
[1:05:02] bankrupt
[1:05:02] i say this same message amen can release
[1:05:05] an anointing in the church
[1:05:07] a minute of bringing it from just being
[1:05:09] a gathering ain't meant to be in a
[1:05:10] powerhouse
[1:05:11] where the holy ghost has a right away
[1:05:14] ain't meant to move in every service
[1:05:16] ain't meant to save the laws and then to
[1:05:18] fill with the holy ghost
[1:05:19] hey you may think i lost my mind this
[1:05:21] morning but i really don't care
[1:05:23] amen i'm surrounded by unsoundness amen
[1:05:25] but i've got a sound message
[1:05:27] and then the world i'm living in is
[1:05:29] confused amen but i've heard the eagle
[1:05:31] scream
[1:05:32] i have heard amen the sound of the
[1:05:35] gospel trumpet that has called me from
[1:05:37] confusion
[1:05:38] these things i'm preaching it's not
[1:05:40] something i heard yesterday
[1:05:42] these things were preached in the 40s
[1:05:44] and the 50s and the 60s
[1:05:46] amen but somebody held fast to it
[1:05:49] somebody believed it
[1:05:50] and it's ought to change
[1:05:53] oh to think this morning church it's
[1:05:55] time to put this message back in your
[1:05:57] minds
[1:05:59] well let's preach a minute amen it's
[1:06:01] time to put this message back in your
[1:06:02] homes
[1:06:03] amen i think it's a shame and then we
[1:06:05] got kids on this message
[1:06:06] they know the voice of every well-known
[1:06:08] preacher but they can't even identify
[1:06:10] the voice of a seven angel
[1:06:11] and i think it's a shame and then we got
[1:06:14] tapes and they never get played
[1:06:16] i think it's a shame that we're living
[1:06:17] in a time where message people
[1:06:19] amen can identify themselves more amen
[1:06:22] with the things of politics
[1:06:24] than they can the things the prophet
[1:06:26] said
[1:06:28] well i know and i know it's a confusing
[1:06:30] time
[1:06:31] amen but we've heard some things we've
[1:06:33] heard some sound
[1:06:35] solid gospel preaching amen and paul
[1:06:38] would go on to say
[1:06:39] as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[1:06:42] as poor yet making many rich as having
[1:06:45] nothing
[1:06:46] and yet possessing all thanks now look
[1:06:49] here
[1:06:50] he says in second thessalonians two
[1:06:51] verse five remember ye not
[1:06:53] that which i was yet with you i told you
[1:06:56] these things paul you're saying remember
[1:06:58] when i was with you i told you these
[1:07:00] things and now you know what withholdeth
[1:07:03] that he might be revealed in his time so
[1:07:06] paul here takes the word hold fast
[1:07:08] and he goes to 2nd thessalonians 2 and
[1:07:11] there that word is used as withholdeth
[1:07:13] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:07:16] work
[1:07:17] only he who now liveth will let until he
[1:07:20] be taken out of the way remember he says
[1:07:22] in the first seal for the mystery of
[1:07:24] iniquity
[1:07:26] already work he said deceivers you see
[1:07:29] amen deceiving the people off into
[1:07:32] something
[1:07:33] see only he which is god that letteth
[1:07:36] will let until he
[1:07:37] he says now that he is church amen
[1:07:40] christ the bride
[1:07:41] be taken out of the way
[1:07:44] so in this honed amen razor's edge time
[1:07:47] that we're living in
[1:07:48] there's only one thing a man standing
[1:07:51] between you
[1:07:52] are standing between the world and
[1:07:53] judgment and that is the bride
[1:07:56] of jesus christ amen and proven his word
[1:07:59] he said now you know there's a scripture
[1:08:00] in the bible
[1:08:01] in first thessalonians 5 21 where it is
[1:08:03] written prove all things
[1:08:04] hold fast to that which is good when
[1:08:07] anything is proven
[1:08:08] it will either be proven right or wrong
[1:08:10] he's not saying
[1:08:11] it's going to be proven and there's
[1:08:13] going to be a gray area given to it
[1:08:15] he's saying it's going to be proven
[1:08:17] right or wrong
[1:08:18] and when there's anything in question it
[1:08:20] should be proven until you find out what
[1:08:22] is right
[1:08:23] and then as you find out what is right
[1:08:25] it said hold fast somebody shout that
[1:08:27] with me
[1:08:28] hold fast amen in other words he said
[1:08:31] you grip it
[1:08:32] don't you turn it loose you hold it fast
[1:08:34] in other words
[1:08:35] you hold it tight so that it will not
[1:08:37] slip you hold fast that which is good
[1:08:40] after it's been proven right and
[1:08:43] anything that's proven
[1:08:44] not right he said then turn it loose as
[1:08:47] quick as you can
[1:08:48] he said get away from it don't never
[1:08:50] hold on to the wrong thing
[1:08:54] when anything has been proven either
[1:08:56] right or wrong he said if it's been
[1:08:58] proven right
[1:08:59] then you get a hold of it and because it
[1:09:01] like this put a death grip on it
[1:09:03] and then get a hold of it and don't turn
[1:09:05] it loose
[1:09:06] amen he said but if it's been proven
[1:09:08] wrong then you turn it loose right quick
[1:09:10] now it's possible that salts christians
[1:09:13] find people hold sometimes to the wrong
[1:09:17] thing thinking it is the right but then
[1:09:19] these things should be proven
[1:09:21] whether they are right or wrong and it's
[1:09:23] the duty of all of us
[1:09:24] as we are expecting to go to heaven when
[1:09:26] jesus comes it is the minister's duty
[1:09:29] when any question is brought up that he
[1:09:31] solves this
[1:09:32] out and then proves it before the people
[1:09:35] that they might understand
[1:09:38] now see he's going to prove these things
[1:09:40] that there might come an understanding
[1:09:42] amen notice because no one wants to be
[1:09:45] found wrong
[1:09:46] amen holding to the wrong side so we
[1:09:48] have a scripture here
[1:09:49] that all scripture must be fulfilled
[1:09:51] then hold fast
[1:09:53] amen let's say this together hold fast
[1:09:55] get a death grip on it
[1:09:58] and don't turn it loose
[1:10:01] fast to that which is good see hold fast
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:05] get a death grip on it and don't turn it
[1:10:07] loose now in our text here apostle paul
[1:10:10] is actually writing to timothy who paul
[1:10:12] is a veteran minister a veteran soldier
[1:10:15] who is fixing to go off the scene and
[1:10:17] he's writing to young timothy
[1:10:19] amen as a veteran soldier of the cross
[1:10:23] and he says here hold fast the form of
[1:10:26] sound words
[1:10:27] which thou hast heard of me in faith and
[1:10:30] love which is in christ jesus
[1:10:31] now i want to break this first down for
[1:10:33] just a moment that word hold fast there
[1:10:35] means to get a grip on means to cling to
[1:10:38] means to hold on to
[1:10:39] the word form means an outline an
[1:10:42] example of pattern
[1:10:43] amen to show by the example of my
[1:10:46] conversation
[1:10:47] that the same grace amen i could preach
[1:10:49] here all day
[1:10:50] the same grace which i had obtained
[1:10:53] would not be warning also to those
[1:10:56] who should hear after believe amen can
[1:10:58] you imagine paul and timothy
[1:11:00] even brother can you imagine timothy
[1:11:01] looking at paul and paul writing to him
[1:11:04] and paul saying now timothy you hold
[1:11:06] fast to the form of sound words
[1:11:08] and in the back of timothy's mind he's
[1:11:10] thinking paul you're getting ready to go
[1:11:12] off the scene amen you've been
[1:11:13] shipwrecked you've been put in prison
[1:11:16] you've been persecuted all these things
[1:11:18] has happened to you paul
[1:11:19] and you're telling me amen that i'm
[1:11:21] going to make it
[1:11:22] you're telling me to hold fast amen but
[1:11:24] paul could look at timothy
[1:11:26] and say timothy don't worry i may be
[1:11:28] gone amen but the same grace
[1:11:30] amen that got me through is the same
[1:11:33] grace
[1:11:34] that's gonna come to you let me say this
[1:11:36] more amen the prophet messenger may be
[1:11:38] gone
[1:11:39] amen but the same grace that got peter
[1:11:41] and paul
[1:11:42] and james and john through is the same
[1:11:44] grace that got
[1:11:46] seven star messengers through that is
[1:11:48] the same grace
[1:11:49] and it's going to get the bride of jesus
[1:11:51] christ through this time of uncertainty
[1:11:54] we are not left wanting we are not left
[1:11:56] hoping
[1:11:57] we have become the recipients of the
[1:12:00] same
[1:12:00] grace of god my help me this morning
[1:12:04] lord
[1:12:05] amen to see amen that there's not going
[1:12:07] to be a bride here
[1:12:08] amen looking for something to hold on to
[1:12:11] but there's been something left for her
[1:12:13] now that word sound actually means to be
[1:12:15] wholesome
[1:12:16] it means to be sound it means to be well
[1:12:19] it means to be
[1:12:20] in good health amen it means to be in
[1:12:23] good health
[1:12:24] even so paul you're saying tend to fee
[1:12:26] you you cling to
[1:12:27] even the pattern amen of words that will
[1:12:30] produce good health
[1:12:32] now i'm not here to ain't meant to get
[1:12:34] off on a health card a health tank but
[1:12:35] let me just say this
[1:12:36] i wish above all things that thou mayest
[1:12:39] prosper and be
[1:12:40] in health amen even as thy soul prospers
[1:12:44] the prophet of god said god's god and
[1:12:45] his bounty of blessings everything we
[1:12:47] have need of
[1:12:48] all of the vitamins everything we have
[1:12:50] need of he said to make us
[1:12:52] a men full sturdy healthy christians
[1:12:55] feel with his spirit amen washed in his
[1:12:57] blood
[1:12:58] and what a time that we can have a
[1:13:00] fellowship he said see it's spiritual
[1:13:02] strength
[1:13:03] it meant to live in the sunshine the
[1:13:05] shining of his glory or it's the
[1:13:07] greatest privilege
[1:13:08] and then we have been given amen is to
[1:13:10] live under the sunlight
[1:13:12] of god's glory he said look at good
[1:13:15] healthy christians i think it's amazing
[1:13:17] he says and then you take a man or woman
[1:13:20] who would put himself down in a cellar
[1:13:21] he said they'll shut themselves off
[1:13:23] he said they become anemia he said they
[1:13:25] become so pale
[1:13:26] they won't have good strength he says
[1:13:30] they won't have good health
[1:13:31] because he has shut himself off from the
[1:13:33] privilege that god gave him
[1:13:35] he said then if we shut ourselves off
[1:13:37] from the glory of god
[1:13:39] from the baptism of the holy ghost or
[1:13:40] the fellowship of the spirit
[1:13:42] he said the first thing you know we
[1:13:43] become pale amen sickly christians
[1:13:46] are growing them when the great trials
[1:13:49] come
[1:13:49] we shrink and go back it takes the
[1:13:52] soldier
[1:13:52] who's lived in the sunlight of god's
[1:13:54] word amen it takes the spirit of god
[1:13:57] he said they can wave every doubt they
[1:13:59] can stand somebody say stand
[1:14:01] they can stand in the midst of a trouble
[1:14:04] and cry
[1:14:04] my redeemer liveth how can they do that
[1:14:08] because they're feeding
[1:14:09] up on sound words now watch here we
[1:14:12] shine ourselves off
[1:14:13] he said but many today they don't want
[1:14:15] to get in a healthy healthy place with
[1:14:17] god
[1:14:18] he said a healthy christian even had a
[1:14:20] healthy spirit
[1:14:21] he said you'll certainly rally for a
[1:14:23] healthy body
[1:14:24] anybody would amen well no matter how
[1:14:26] much health you put in that it's
[1:14:28] going back to the dust but oh my brother
[1:14:30] he said that
[1:14:31] soul cannot get too healthy
[1:14:35] are you hearing me that soul amen cannot
[1:14:38] get too healthy
[1:14:39] every time it grows in the strength and
[1:14:42] the grace and power of god
[1:14:44] amen the soul in you amen cannot get too
[1:14:47] healthy think of that this morning amen
[1:14:48] people poor
[1:14:49] and i believe in it i believe we should
[1:14:51] take care of ourselves right amen but
[1:14:53] watch something ain't meant they pour
[1:14:54] into this body
[1:14:56] and they do they do and then they do all
[1:14:57] kinds of face lifts and all kinds of
[1:14:59] plastic surgeries
[1:15:00] and all kinds of things trying and then
[1:15:02] to keep health in this body but the
[1:15:04] problem of god is saying see
[1:15:06] but they got a soul in there that you
[1:15:08] can't pour too much health in it
[1:15:10] amen you've got a soul in there that
[1:15:12] could not get too healthy
[1:15:13] you've got a soul in there that cannot
[1:15:15] get too much power
[1:15:17] amen so other words we should be
[1:15:19] believers with healthy souls
[1:15:21] amen we should be believers with healthy
[1:15:23] minds amen
[1:15:24] what what's making our mind healthy is
[1:15:26] the things
[1:15:27] which we've kept in remembrance that's
[1:15:30] been taught now i'd like to read this to
[1:15:32] you
[1:15:32] it means simply stated the believers are
[1:15:34] to hold fast to the holy scriptures
[1:15:36] to the very words of god himself for the
[1:15:39] word of god alone somebody said the word
[1:15:41] of god alone
[1:15:43] can bring health and life to the human
[1:15:46] soul
[1:15:46] he said the words of christ are absolute
[1:15:49] and
[1:15:50] people that live and i'm just reading
[1:15:51] some here people that live by theories
[1:15:53] and philosophies
[1:15:54] they will perish by them amen people
[1:15:56] that live by conspiracies
[1:15:58] they will perish by them amen but there
[1:16:00] is an absolute here church
[1:16:02] there is a word here that we can anchor
[1:16:04] our lives to what are you saying i'm
[1:16:06] saying we don't have to live by feelings
[1:16:08] we can live by what god said amen the
[1:16:10] prophet said unless you die to yourself
[1:16:12] and your feelings and act on god's word
[1:16:15] you'll never have life
[1:16:17] he said forget your feelings and just
[1:16:19] take what
[1:16:20] god said amen see forget your feelings
[1:16:23] amen forget your sensations forget your
[1:16:26] emotions and take
[1:16:27] simply what god said amen now i said
[1:16:30] like this god
[1:16:31] amen holds fast to his own words amen
[1:16:34] god does not speak a word
[1:16:36] and then change the word and then speak
[1:16:38] another word and change that
[1:16:40] amen his first word is a spoken word and
[1:16:43] his spoken word is a perfect word
[1:16:45] and his perfect word is an absolute word
[1:16:48] and what are you saying preacher
[1:16:49] i'm saying this message it's not a
[1:16:51] second thought of god
[1:16:53] it is not a second opinion of god this
[1:16:55] message
[1:16:56] is the perfect interpretation of the
[1:16:59] spoken word of god
[1:17:00] amen we can laugh we can anchor our
[1:17:02] souls on it
[1:17:03] amen i know if y'all forgot the word or
[1:17:05] not but it's amen amen we can anchor our
[1:17:07] souls on it
[1:17:08] we can build our families upon it listen
[1:17:10] church we ought to be the most happiest
[1:17:12] people this morning
[1:17:14] amen the world don't have nothing to
[1:17:15] build on ain't in brother russell
[1:17:17] they'll be
[1:17:18] there they're building families they're
[1:17:20] building futures upon this country
[1:17:22] and it's going down quicker than we can
[1:17:24] watch it amen but there is a kingdom
[1:17:26] coming
[1:17:26] and it's not a shaken kingdom it is not
[1:17:29] an unstable
[1:17:30] kingdom it is a sound amen certain
[1:17:32] stable kingdom
[1:17:34] and that kingdom will never pass away
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:39] what are you saying i'm saying hold on
[1:17:40] to sound words amen god's words are
[1:17:43] sound words
[1:17:44] you realize this morning church we are
[1:17:46] judged even by
[1:17:47] the word of god either we we are
[1:17:49] actually this morning judged
[1:17:51] by the word of god now the prophet god
[1:17:53] tells us that there's actually two vines
[1:17:55] he says there is a true vine he said
[1:17:57] then there is a false vine
[1:17:59] he said both vines amen hear the words
[1:18:02] of the lord
[1:18:03] the true mind hears the words and the
[1:18:05] false vine hears the words
[1:18:07] he says now watch he says the true mind
[1:18:10] hears the words
[1:18:11] and it strikes joy and gladness
[1:18:14] and rejoicing in their hearts he said
[1:18:16] but the false mind
[1:18:18] amen hears the same words and the same
[1:18:20] words
[1:18:21] strike fear and terror in their hearts
[1:18:24] see what it is it's the force or it's
[1:18:27] the power
[1:18:28] of those words that are falling in a
[1:18:29] heart amen that true vine heart
[1:18:32] is a prepared heart to receive the words
[1:18:35] of the lord amen but that falsehood
[1:18:37] heart
[1:18:37] is a heart that'll hear the words but
[1:18:39] it'll fall and it'll go somewhere else
[1:18:41] but that true line is going to get a
[1:18:43] hold of those words
[1:18:44] and they're going to meditate on those
[1:18:46] words they're going to chew on those
[1:18:48] words
[1:18:48] they're going to feast on those words
[1:18:50] and those words are going to release an
[1:18:52] anointing in that individual
[1:18:55] now many times we underestimate the
[1:18:57] force amen behind our words
[1:18:59] look here in proverbs 16 24 the bible
[1:19:02] says pleasant words
[1:19:03] are as in honeycomb which they are sweet
[1:19:06] to the soul
[1:19:06] and their health to the bones but now
[1:19:09] now i just like to read this bit of
[1:19:10] commentary here to you
[1:19:11] honey is delightful taste and see it has
[1:19:14] a nourishing property
[1:19:15] that spread throughout the body he said
[1:19:18] like honey pleasant words add sweetness
[1:19:20] to a person's life and contribute to
[1:19:22] good health words carry
[1:19:24] great power are you hearing me words
[1:19:26] carry
[1:19:27] great power and wise people speak words
[1:19:30] that have a powerful
[1:19:31] impact and edify the hearts and lives of
[1:19:34] others
[1:19:35] amen see their words of wisdom flow from
[1:19:38] the fear of the lord
[1:19:39] and the understanding of his word in
[1:19:42] paul
[1:19:42] 25 verse 11 the bible says a word fitly
[1:19:45] spoken
[1:19:46] is like apples of gold in pictures of
[1:19:48] silver amen wise people are awful
[1:19:51] or also are are often times careful in
[1:19:54] choosing their words when settling
[1:19:55] differences are you hearing me
[1:19:56] amen words have the ability amen to tear
[1:20:00] down
[1:20:00] and ring up amen words have the ability
[1:20:02] to drive apart
[1:20:04] and bring together words have the
[1:20:05] ability amen to discourage one
[1:20:08] amen or to encourage one's seed amen
[1:20:10] saying the right thing
[1:20:12] in the right way at the right time can
[1:20:14] be very effective in making peace with
[1:20:16] another person
[1:20:17] the reference here to gold apples in a
[1:20:19] silver setting describes something that
[1:20:21] is both exceptionally
[1:20:22] and beautiful and extremely valuable it
[1:20:25] aptly
[1:20:25] illustrates the benefits of well chosen
[1:20:28] amen properly spoken words can bring
[1:20:31] reconciliation are you hearing me amen
[1:20:34] well chosen
[1:20:36] properly spoken words have the ability
[1:20:39] amen to bring reconciliation amen so if
[1:20:41] you amen and i i can pick on brother
[1:20:43] wrestler for a minute amen but but if
[1:20:45] there was a disagreement there between
[1:20:48] amen i wanted to i wanted to get it
[1:20:49] worked out and what caused this
[1:20:51] agreement was i said brother brother
[1:20:52] russell that title match that shirt
[1:20:54] and it it ain't very nice amen it put a
[1:20:57] wall between us
[1:20:58] amen now if i want to go and i want to
[1:21:00] fix that and bring a reconciliation
[1:21:01] i'm not going to go and say well i'm
[1:21:03] sorry for what i said about your shirt
[1:21:05] and your tie
[1:21:05] amen but your shoes are worse are you
[1:21:08] saying
[1:21:09] if i'm going to say something to bring a
[1:21:11] reconciliation i must filter my words
[1:21:13] i must do something ain't meant to are
[1:21:15] you hearing me church
[1:21:17] and this world has been divided and then
[1:21:19] they've been drawn back by words
[1:21:21] amen political words and religious words
[1:21:23] has tore the world apart
[1:21:25] amen but in the seventh seal amen under
[1:21:28] the seven angels message
[1:21:29] there would come a word that would not
[1:21:31] tear the church apart
[1:21:33] it would bring the church together
[1:21:34] listen friends amen denomination was a
[1:21:37] word
[1:21:37] that drove people apart amen
[1:21:39] denomination was a word that tore
[1:21:41] families apart
[1:21:42] amen but there was another word which
[1:21:44] was a word like this a spoken word
[1:21:46] that did not drive us apart but it
[1:21:49] brought us together
[1:21:51] amen i say this our words are important
[1:21:54] the bible goes on another place and says
[1:21:56] the words of the wise
[1:21:57] are as goats and as nails fastened by
[1:21:59] the masters of assemblies which are
[1:22:01] given from one shepherd the lord god
[1:22:03] isaiah 54
[1:22:04] 50 verse 4 the lord god has given me the
[1:22:07] tongue
[1:22:08] of the lord are you catching it the
[1:22:10] tongue of the learn
[1:22:12] amen that i should know how to speak a
[1:22:14] word and sees into him that is weary
[1:22:17] if somebody is already weary you have
[1:22:19] the power
[1:22:20] amen to speak a word that can cause them
[1:22:22] to be more weary
[1:22:24] or you've got the power to speak a word
[1:22:26] that can give them strength
[1:22:27] that can give them grace that can give
[1:22:29] them are you hearing me the power of our
[1:22:31] words are a very powerful force
[1:22:34] but i said see many times you say i
[1:22:36] can't do very much about
[1:22:38] the conditions today he said but just a
[1:22:40] little kind word to someone
[1:22:42] amen an invitation or a little testimony
[1:22:45] a little kind smile
[1:22:46] a greeting to a passerby might mean more
[1:22:49] than you think it does
[1:22:50] amen just a little word and it can go a
[1:22:53] long way
[1:22:54] just a little word can change an entire
[1:22:56] situation now you say what are you
[1:22:58] saying
[1:22:58] i'm saying notice the power of words
[1:23:00] it's not the quantity
[1:23:02] of the words it's spoken it is actually
[1:23:04] the quality of the words that are spoken
[1:23:08] you say but then if it's going to be
[1:23:09] something of words to bring
[1:23:11] reconciliation it's going to be a lot of
[1:23:12] words well let's go to genesis
[1:23:14] and look there in genesis where there
[1:23:16] was creation power look at the words
[1:23:18] there were three words spoken let there
[1:23:20] be
[1:23:21] are you hearing me and then let there be
[1:23:23] three little words
[1:23:24] of let there be amen but behind those
[1:23:27] three little words
[1:23:28] was the entire power of creation behind
[1:23:32] three words
[1:23:32] it wasn't an essay amen it wasn't a
[1:23:35] paragraph
[1:23:36] it wasn't an entire sentence jesus
[1:23:38] christ spoke three words
[1:23:39] amen let there be and the son amen felt
[1:23:43] the force of those words
[1:23:44] amen the moon and then felt the whole
[1:23:46] help me jesus the moon felt the force of
[1:23:49] those words
[1:23:49] amen those three words amen let's go to
[1:23:52] the bible and preach a second can we
[1:23:53] amen the bible says and then in the
[1:23:55] beginning was the word
[1:23:57] and the word was with god and the word
[1:23:58] was god right amen
[1:24:00] said now let's go back to genesis and
[1:24:02] watch that amen in the beginning god
[1:24:04] which was the word amen created the
[1:24:07] heavens and the earth
[1:24:08] and the earth was without form and void
[1:24:11] and darkness covered the face of the
[1:24:12] deep
[1:24:13] but i love the next part but the spirit
[1:24:15] moved
[1:24:16] and then the spirit moved no matter how
[1:24:18] dark it was
[1:24:20] no matter how bleak it was no matter how
[1:24:22] confusing it was
[1:24:23] there was nothing that could stand in
[1:24:26] the way of the spirit moving
[1:24:27] i say this morning church and then you
[1:24:30] may be just like the earth you may be
[1:24:32] without form
[1:24:32] and you may be void and darkness may be
[1:24:34] covered in your life
[1:24:35] but the same creates your power has
[1:24:38] returned in this age
[1:24:39] amen under a ministry of elijah amen to
[1:24:42] say let the spirit move
[1:24:44] again and let there come let there come
[1:24:46] a garden of eden out of chaos
[1:24:50] see the words it's not the power it's
[1:24:52] not the quantity it's the quality
[1:24:54] look in saint john 11 7 11 17 the bible
[1:24:57] says this
[1:24:58] then when jesus came speaking of lazarus
[1:25:00] he found that he had laid in the grave
[1:25:02] four days already
[1:25:03] there says it's so different with jesus
[1:25:05] and it he sees every little move that
[1:25:07] you make
[1:25:10] every little word that you speak
[1:25:13] every kind deed that you do all of them
[1:25:15] mean much to him
[1:25:20] now he says these little words here's a
[1:25:22] direct quote these little words here
[1:25:24] tonight
[1:25:24] of these four letters that's been read
[1:25:26] for texts they conceal
[1:25:29] your eternal destination your attitude
[1:25:32] towards them
[1:25:33] what were those four words then jesus
[1:25:37] then when jesus came are you hearing me
[1:25:39] see when jesus came
[1:25:41] he said then when jesus came then he
[1:25:43] takes the text and calls it and then
[1:25:45] jesus came
[1:25:46] and that isn't that a small little bit
[1:25:47] of words but he says look
[1:25:49] he says what makes him so important he
[1:25:51] said the little words could set you free
[1:25:53] from sin
[1:25:54] then little words of then when jesus
[1:25:57] came
[1:25:57] could set you free from sin tonight he
[1:26:00] said those little words
[1:26:01] could condem those little words of them
[1:26:03] when jesus came could condemn you
[1:26:05] tonight
[1:26:05] those little words could set you free
[1:26:08] from sickness and suffering
[1:26:09] tonight but you've got to receive them
[1:26:12] they've got to be received
[1:26:14] and now we just got one service today
[1:26:16] right so let's just let our hair down
[1:26:17] for a minute have church okay
[1:26:19] amen amazing some people come to church
[1:26:21] believing on their mind amen but let's
[1:26:22] just let's preach here for a minute okay
[1:26:24] amen them little words amen could heal
[1:26:26] you or they conceal your destination
[1:26:29] them little words could set you free are
[1:26:31] you hearing it amen see what it is
[1:26:32] it's not the power of just speaking the
[1:26:35] words but the words have got to be
[1:26:37] received
[1:26:37] amen those words will have effect upon
[1:26:40] no one
[1:26:41] if they're never received but when
[1:26:43] they're received
[1:26:44] then the effect of those words amen
[1:26:47] begins to change
[1:26:48] and then the person that received them
[1:26:50] and then see on the day of pentecost
[1:26:51] peter spoke there
[1:26:52] and said these uh then they that gladly
[1:26:55] received his word
[1:26:56] were baptized and the same day they were
[1:26:58] added in them about 3 000 souls
[1:27:02] are you following me and then they
[1:27:04] received the words amen notice here the
[1:27:06] evidence they received the words
[1:27:08] was they went and was baptized so they
[1:27:10] received the words then they went and
[1:27:12] was baptized which showed
[1:27:14] they did more than hear the words but
[1:27:16] they received the words and the words
[1:27:18] had effect upon them
[1:27:19] he said the promise of the holy ghost is
[1:27:21] an assurance if you'll get if you
[1:27:23] receive it that way
[1:27:24] it depends on your attitude towards the
[1:27:26] word
[1:27:27] the word is not the paper it's just a
[1:27:30] book but it's christ
[1:27:32] it manifests on the paper he said we
[1:27:35] just received his word
[1:27:36] just like it was he himself when i see
[1:27:39] his promise to me
[1:27:40] that christ he said i embrace it amen
[1:27:43] amen notice this he cannot lie
[1:27:46] to me it's exactly the true see i might
[1:27:48] not know how to take a hold of it
[1:27:50] but it's the truth and i'll hold right
[1:27:53] with it because it's christ to me
[1:27:57] when i read his word when i hear his
[1:27:59] word i will receive his word
[1:28:01] and his cries to me the brother goes
[1:28:03] another place and says when god speaks a
[1:28:05] word
[1:28:05] it's already finished are you hearing me
[1:28:08] when god speaks a word it's already
[1:28:12] finished
[1:28:12] and what about his promises that he's
[1:28:14] given to us
[1:28:15] everything he has said it's already a
[1:28:18] finished work
[1:28:19] so therefore when we receive his word
[1:28:22] into our heart it's already done
[1:28:25] it's completed oh help me this morning
[1:28:29] church
[1:28:30] amen when you receive his word into your
[1:28:33] heart
[1:28:33] it's not going to begin to work it's not
[1:28:36] going to begin to
[1:28:38] be done but the prophet said when you
[1:28:40] receive it it's
[1:28:41] already completed it's already finished
[1:28:44] it's just looking amen for a bonnie come
[1:28:46] on church amen look at i say
[1:28:48] he prophesied and said behold amen a
[1:28:51] virgin shall conceive
[1:28:52] do you realize that word word that word
[1:28:54] circled the earth for some 700 years
[1:28:57] it was not a word that had to be
[1:28:59] tampered with it was not a word that had
[1:29:01] to be changed
[1:29:02] it was a spoken word it was a perfect
[1:29:04] word
[1:29:05] it was a creative word the only thing it
[1:29:07] was waiting for
[1:29:08] was a room that could be received and i
[1:29:11] say this morning church
[1:29:12] there has been a prophecy and it's been
[1:29:14] circled the earth and then there is
[1:29:16] going to be a bride
[1:29:17] there is going to be an invincible army
[1:29:20] there is going to be a church
[1:29:21] aimed with the power of god and the
[1:29:23] apostolic blessings
[1:29:25] amen flowing through it that word has
[1:29:27] been circling
[1:29:28] amen for years but this morning there is
[1:29:31] a womb
[1:29:31] on the earth to receive the spoken word
[1:29:34] and allow it to manifest
[1:29:38] oh god help me are you hearing me church
[1:29:41] your wound this morning
[1:29:42] is a prepared womb to receive a prepared
[1:29:45] word
[1:29:46] and there is a force
[1:29:50] there's a force behind the word
[1:29:53] now you say blender what is the word
[1:29:55] well the prophet said a word
[1:29:57] is a thought expressed
[1:30:00] a word is a thought express he said see
[1:30:04] god's thinking expressed it his words
[1:30:07] through the prophets and they wrote the
[1:30:09] bible
[1:30:10] which is in word form i love that
[1:30:14] they wrote the bible which is in word
[1:30:17] form
[1:30:18] and jesus called it a seed and any seed
[1:30:21] will bring forth of its kind if it's in
[1:30:23] the right condition
[1:30:25] the right atmosphere
[1:30:28] how many knows atmosphere is the most
[1:30:31] important thing
[1:30:32] an atmosphere when it comes to a seed is
[1:30:35] so
[1:30:35] important now watch here the problem
[1:30:37] says what is the word
[1:30:39] he said a word is a fault expressed
[1:30:43] now can i this very simple but i pray
[1:30:45] it's helping somebody
[1:30:46] i want you to notice something here
[1:30:48] notice the order amen it's fault
[1:30:51] then the word the new expression
[1:30:55] it's a fault then it's a word then it's
[1:30:58] expressed promises see
[1:30:59] before you say anything subconsciously
[1:31:02] you think it before you speak it is that
[1:31:05] right amen i'll watch in the beginning
[1:31:07] was the word this was a minute ago
[1:31:08] in the beginning was the word that's as
[1:31:10] far as we can go back by this theology
[1:31:13] but before the word was it was a
[1:31:16] fault see as far as the written word
[1:31:20] this morning
[1:31:21] as far back as we can go is genesis 1
[1:31:25] in the beginning was or in the beginning
[1:31:28] god created the heavens and the earth
[1:31:29] right
[1:31:30] but a prophet says see but there was an
[1:31:31] existence of that word before it become
[1:31:33] written formed
[1:31:34] it was a fault in the mind of god he
[1:31:37] said see and the word was made manifest
[1:31:39] when jesus no wonder can i take some
[1:31:41] time and read this to you
[1:31:42] it's powerful when no wonder when he
[1:31:44] come off the hill that night and looked
[1:31:45] around at the tree for food there was no
[1:31:47] there were there was no food on the tree
[1:31:49] and he said no man eat it from me
[1:31:50] and he went on away and the next day
[1:31:52] coming back the tree and withered
[1:31:54] he said god's mind the mind that in the
[1:31:57] beginning
[1:31:58] that was a fault before it was a word
[1:32:00] that expressed jesus christ
[1:32:02] he said the same one was expressing that
[1:32:05] word back again
[1:32:08] the same mind that was expressing itself
[1:32:11] in genesis 1 has now come to john 1 14
[1:32:15] when the word has become flesh and the
[1:32:17] same mind-hole
[1:32:19] god the same mind back there is
[1:32:22] now in flesh speaking the same word
[1:32:25] he said and every word in the bible is
[1:32:27] god's thoughts amen laying in seat form
[1:32:30] that if they're received into the human
[1:32:32] being and spoke by the same fault
[1:32:35] that materialized the bible brings the
[1:32:37] same thing to pass
[1:32:39] are you following my trail now amen this
[1:32:41] is beautiful
[1:32:42] amen think of this brother russell all
[1:32:44] the way back there amen was the mind of
[1:32:46] god in genesis 1.
[1:32:48] and that mind amen come into jesus in
[1:32:50] john 1 14
[1:32:52] and that same mind it's not dead this
[1:32:54] morning
[1:32:55] amen but that mind is in the evening
[1:32:57] like tabernacle
[1:32:58] amen in elkton kentucky this morning the
[1:33:00] same mind
[1:33:02] that spoke in genesis one that cursed
[1:33:04] the victory
[1:33:05] is the same mind that it's in the church
[1:33:07] today and the province said
[1:33:09] see and what difference is it to you if
[1:33:11] it becomes a real revelation
[1:33:14] it becomes real revelation he said back
[1:33:16] there he said you're
[1:33:17] let there be and let there be this he
[1:33:19] said then how much more today uh how
[1:33:22] much more today can we say
[1:33:23] let there be no cancer are you hearing
[1:33:26] me
[1:33:26] amen the same authority is in the church
[1:33:29] today by the word
[1:33:33] now this is what it's going to take
[1:33:34] though when the human element goes out
[1:33:37] the spirit of god fills the vacancy when
[1:33:40] you empty
[1:33:41] yourself amen then we'll be the church
[1:33:44] and if
[1:33:44] it's power in the resurrection we'll
[1:33:47] walk in his steps
[1:33:48] in his power in his thoughts in his
[1:33:50] being
[1:33:51] in his movement then your thoughts will
[1:33:54] become words
[1:33:55] and words will become material
[1:33:59] oh jesus what is a word a word
[1:34:02] is the fault expressed amen let's follow
[1:34:05] the trail again
[1:34:06] amen god above us amen bond with us amen
[1:34:09] and now it's god in us
[1:34:10] are you hearing me amen and your words
[1:34:12] amen your thoughts
[1:34:14] will become words then your words will
[1:34:16] become material
[1:34:18] church this time is not coming this time
[1:34:21] is here
[1:34:22] and then he said it like this i believe
[1:34:24] it's on its road
[1:34:25] when the church will be so wrapped in
[1:34:27] christ and the holy spirit mankind
[1:34:30] sow away from themselves they don't see
[1:34:32] themselves they don't have no oh but all
[1:34:34] they think is to serve god
[1:34:36] and their thoughts just move on they
[1:34:39] refuse the things of the world
[1:34:41] they just move in the spirit they live
[1:34:44] in the spirit
[1:34:45] they move in the spirits they walk in
[1:34:47] the spirit so fulfill the law of christ
[1:34:49] then the love of christ in the human
[1:34:51] heart moving by the holy ghost
[1:34:53] that great wonderful church will go
[1:34:56] forth with power
[1:34:57] and deity because deity because deity
[1:35:00] because deity because they no i'm not a
[1:35:03] broken record i want to drive this home
[1:35:04] because deity will be revealed in human
[1:35:08] beings
[1:35:09] by the holy spirit bringing to pass
[1:35:12] the fault in their mind
[1:35:18] that'll hit you about 10 o'clock
[1:35:19] tomorrow at work and you'll scare me to
[1:35:21] death
[1:35:21] are you hearing me deity is back in the
[1:35:24] earth
[1:35:24] being revealed again brother brad amen
[1:35:27] bringing the thoughts to pass
[1:35:30] are you hearing me the time has come
[1:35:33] what did
[1:35:34] what did the bible say the bible said
[1:35:35] the time will come that they will call
[1:35:37] but before they call i will answer and
[1:35:40] while they're yet speaking i will hear
[1:35:42] are you hearing me see or we've come to
[1:35:44] church deity
[1:35:45] has come back in the church by the power
[1:35:48] of the spoken word amen now what are you
[1:35:51] saying
[1:35:51] i'm saying negative thoughts even
[1:35:53] produce negative words
[1:35:55] which produce negative expressions
[1:35:58] amen a negative thought will produce a
[1:36:00] negative word
[1:36:01] which will produce a negative all right
[1:36:03] you can't tell me that you've got a
[1:36:05] negative
[1:36:05] a negative thought and you speak
[1:36:07] negative words all you think is negative
[1:36:09] thoughts
[1:36:10] and all you speak is negative words and
[1:36:13] you got the most positive expression
[1:36:15] it don't work negative thoughts produce
[1:36:18] negative words
[1:36:19] produce negative expressions now if that
[1:36:21] works in the negative
[1:36:22] then let's bring in the positive where
[1:36:24] positive faults
[1:36:25] amen produce positive words which in
[1:36:28] return
[1:36:29] will produce positive expressions
[1:36:33] now we've all heard this quote i know
[1:36:35] you can probably read it to me before i
[1:36:36] even start reading it but can i
[1:36:38] can i dissect it for a second it's in
[1:36:40] law 1955 paragraph 18.
[1:36:42] he said now it's a strange thing that
[1:36:45] this
[1:36:45] is so much full of people
[1:36:49] this is a strange thing that this is so
[1:36:51] much the thought of people notice the
[1:36:53] order
[1:36:53] the thought of people they say so they
[1:36:56] think it then they say
[1:36:57] well i'm weak and my faith is not very
[1:37:00] much i'm not a very good christian
[1:37:02] that's just what the devil wants you to
[1:37:04] say
[1:37:06] you're just talking his language right
[1:37:08] then
[1:37:09] see you must never say that don't never
[1:37:12] let your testimony be negative let it be
[1:37:15] positive all the time
[1:37:17] i am saved i have god in my heart
[1:37:20] i believe him with all my heart do you
[1:37:23] believe in divine healing with all of my
[1:37:25] heart
[1:37:26] never permit a negative fault to come in
[1:37:29] your mind if you can help it
[1:37:30] when it starts that then don't entertain
[1:37:32] it amen said you can't stop the thoughts
[1:37:34] from coming
[1:37:35] but you have got the power but deity
[1:37:38] amen to refrain from entertaining those
[1:37:40] thoughts
[1:37:40] well you say i can't help the thoughts
[1:37:42] from coming he said like the farmer with
[1:37:43] the birds couldn't stop him from flying
[1:37:45] over his place but he could sure stop
[1:37:47] him from roosting
[1:37:48] he said see you can't help the thoughts
[1:37:50] when they come
[1:37:51] but don't entertain them just
[1:37:54] pass it on no sir jesus christ is my
[1:37:59] savior
[1:37:59] all things are mine by god and i'm going
[1:38:02] to keep them
[1:38:03] i'm going to testify them and god can
[1:38:05] only bless you
[1:38:06] as you confess he has done for you see
[1:38:09] he's the high priest of your confession
[1:38:13] if you've got a negative thought then
[1:38:15] you'll have a negative word
[1:38:16] which will produce a negative expression
[1:38:18] which is a negative confession
[1:38:21] but if word or positive fault producing
[1:38:24] a past word
[1:38:25] it's going to produce a positive
[1:38:26] expression and you're going to have
[1:38:28] even a positive confession and are y'all
[1:38:31] hearing me
[1:38:32] and you realize there's some people
[1:38:33] let's just let's just preach it for a
[1:38:34] minute
[1:38:35] there's some people that really need to
[1:38:36] get a change
[1:38:40] you ever speak to people and you ask
[1:38:42] them how they're doing
[1:38:45] and about 30 minutes later tonight you
[1:38:46] wish you'd never ask
[1:38:49] are you hearing me i said brother don't
[1:38:50] don't tell me uh i won't call his name
[1:38:52] but his pastor
[1:38:53] he said i went out after service one
[1:38:55] morning i said how you doing says he
[1:38:56] said about an hour and a half later
[1:38:59] he said i thought well i'm sorry i asked
[1:39:02] see amen
[1:39:03] but if you're feeding no negative then
[1:39:05] your words are going to be negative
[1:39:07] then your expression is going to be
[1:39:08] negative then the atmosphere around you
[1:39:10] is going to be negative
[1:39:11] and we have no excuse to be living under
[1:39:14] the negative
[1:39:17] we did not receive a negative message we
[1:39:20] did not have a negative prophet
[1:39:22] we are not reading from a negative bible
[1:39:24] the words we are listening and feeding
[1:39:26] upon
[1:39:27] they are not negative they are positive
[1:39:29] see david would say
[1:39:31] the words of my mouth and the meditation
[1:39:33] of my heart
[1:39:35] be acceptable and i shall lord my
[1:39:38] strength and my redeemer
[1:39:39] he said while they were thinking on
[1:39:40] these things a stranger walked out
[1:39:44] when you go to thinking about him is
[1:39:46] when he appears
[1:39:49] he said see they were talking about him
[1:39:51] when he appeared and
[1:39:53] that's the reason maybe he needs us
[1:39:57] maybe we're talking about trading cars
[1:39:59] or or what kind of soap powder to use or
[1:40:01] listen to the radio or something
[1:40:03] he said batteries he don't appear did
[1:40:05] you ever notice how the angel lord comes
[1:40:09] of an evening at three o'clock when i go
[1:40:11] in i close
[1:40:12] everything out i don't let no one come
[1:40:14] in and just sit there and read the word
[1:40:17] and yield myself until i know he's there
[1:40:20] i can feel it when he's coming
[1:40:22] he comes in and i know he's here oh my
[1:40:24] that's the way you do
[1:40:25] that's the way the disciples did they
[1:40:27] were with one place
[1:40:29] and one accord in a peru and they were
[1:40:31] all up there preaching him
[1:40:33] and all of a sudden are you hearing me
[1:40:35] all of a sudden
[1:40:37] he came in that's the way he does it so
[1:40:39] these people are going along the road
[1:40:40] meditating on him
[1:40:42] talking about him and he stepped out and
[1:40:44] said how'd he do
[1:40:46] he said see why are you so sorrowful are
[1:40:49] you hearing me
[1:40:50] amen now here's the people that that
[1:40:52] should have never been negative
[1:40:56] they should have not you said andrew
[1:40:58] they had just lost
[1:41:01] jesus and their their leader just died
[1:41:04] he had just been crucified amen but he
[1:41:07] left him some positive words
[1:41:10] he left them some positive words and
[1:41:12] they should have been feeding upon those
[1:41:14] words
[1:41:14] amen amen from the time they took him
[1:41:16] away and they hung him up on the cross
[1:41:19] amen and they stretched him between the
[1:41:20] heavens and the earth amen and the blood
[1:41:22] ran out
[1:41:22] they should have been feeding upon you
[1:41:24] destroy this temple
[1:41:25] and in three days i'll raise it up again
[1:41:27] that should have been their food
[1:41:29] they should have been holding fast amen
[1:41:31] but because amen of the atmosphere
[1:41:33] because they were human they began to
[1:41:35] become discouraged and they began to
[1:41:37] come to press
[1:41:38] and here they are walking down the road
[1:41:39] are you hearing me they're walking down
[1:41:41] the road
[1:41:41] and out steps a man don't you thank god
[1:41:44] for a kentucky prophet
[1:41:45] outsteps a man and remembers jesus
[1:41:48] looked at him
[1:41:48] and said how'd he do how'd he do amen
[1:41:52] said he had a smile on his face
[1:41:55] oh jesus he had a smile on his face
[1:41:59] he said my well you why are you so
[1:42:01] sorrowful this morning
[1:42:03] hey why are you so sorrowful this
[1:42:05] morning he said my
[1:42:06] you look terrible
[1:42:12] oh mercy and then let's preach every
[1:42:15] minute you
[1:42:16] your sister's getting ready for church
[1:42:17] you know you go your husband say how's
[1:42:19] this look and
[1:42:21] he don't give you the answer you want to
[1:42:23] hear and it's a little rough right to
[1:42:25] church ain't it
[1:42:26] but but here here is the lord jesus
[1:42:28] looks and says you look terrible
[1:42:30] you look sorrowful why you got a big old
[1:42:32] frown on your face
[1:42:33] remember said they stopped and they
[1:42:35] looked at him and said oh
[1:42:37] amen are you i mean he said you being
[1:42:39] jews why do you look like that
[1:42:41] why aren't you smiling they said why are
[1:42:44] you just a stranger out here
[1:42:46] i guess not he made the heavens and the
[1:42:48] earth how would he be a stranger
[1:42:50] he said are you just a stranger so they
[1:42:52] ask him are you a stranger
[1:42:54] and he was the one that made the earth
[1:42:56] they was walking on
[1:42:57] he was the one amen that was hung up on
[1:43:00] the cross
[1:43:01] that went in the tomb that went in the
[1:43:03] regions of the laws
[1:43:04] that priests of the souls in prison that
[1:43:06] took the keys of death hell and the
[1:43:07] grave
[1:43:08] away from the devil amen and ascended
[1:43:10] back up on high
[1:43:11] and rose on the third day amen and he's
[1:43:14] more happier than they are
[1:43:21] now notice this why are you being jews
[1:43:26] why are you frowning
[1:43:30] what if the word let me just say it this
[1:43:33] way what if jesus was to walk in here
[1:43:35] like that today
[1:43:36] in a corporate body like he did back
[1:43:38] then what if he walked the aisles of
[1:43:39] this church and said
[1:43:41] y'all being message believers
[1:43:44] why are you all so sad why why y'all
[1:43:47] frowning
[1:43:49] why you look so sorrowful have you and
[1:43:52] you know what we would say
[1:43:53] we'd say have you not heard trump didn't
[1:43:55] get reelected
[1:44:00] have you not heard the jobs have you not
[1:44:02] heard are you
[1:44:03] have you not seen we went but he would
[1:44:05] say look amen you should be happy
[1:44:07] because your joy is not coming from this
[1:44:10] realm your joy is coming from another
[1:44:12] realm
[1:44:13] what are you saying i'm saying church
[1:44:15] amen take this frown off your face
[1:44:17] amen yes i'm just like you i hate to see
[1:44:20] this nation going the way it's going
[1:44:21] i hate to see what's going on we
[1:44:25] this you would be different amen but
[1:44:27] let's realize friends we have got more
[1:44:29] than they've got
[1:44:30] there is more with us than there is with
[1:44:32] him
[1:44:33] we have got a word and it's a positive
[1:44:35] word we should take the frown off of our
[1:44:37] face
[1:44:38] listen church i'll say it like this for
[1:44:40] the russell i don't think there should
[1:44:41] be one message believer
[1:44:42] that listens to a tape that i'll have a
[1:44:44] frown on their face
[1:44:45] i don't think there ought to be one
[1:44:47] preacher as much stress as we're under
[1:44:49] i don't think there should ever be a
[1:44:50] time we let that old naked devil
[1:44:53] amen put a frown upon our face because
[1:44:55] no matter how negative things are
[1:44:58] we've got a positive word
[1:45:02] brother andrew don't you realize i'm
[1:45:03] spiritual that's why i frowned
[1:45:05] no you're miserable that's why you frown
[1:45:08] brother andrew frowning a spiritual well
[1:45:10] i'm glad you think that but a prophet
[1:45:12] didn't
[1:45:14] a prophet said god don't want you to be
[1:45:17] frowned and
[1:45:19] god wants you to be happy the human
[1:45:23] heart
[1:45:24] was made to be happy can i read you a
[1:45:26] few here
[1:45:27] i believe that the reason people doesn't
[1:45:29] have the victory in their heart that
[1:45:30] they should have
[1:45:31] is because their thoughts are on other
[1:45:33] things
[1:45:34] the token 1960 1964 why don't you
[1:45:37] identify yourself
[1:45:39] in death to your own thinking tonight
[1:45:42] and let the thought that's in him be in
[1:45:45] you
[1:45:45] let the meditation of my heart be
[1:45:48] acceptable thee oh lord
[1:45:49] let thy word if you abide in me and my
[1:45:52] word in you that is him
[1:45:53] then ask what you will and it will be
[1:45:55] given to you 1962 sirs we would see
[1:45:58] jesus
[1:45:59] therefore we should never speak anything
[1:46:02] but what we believe and understand and
[1:46:05] let it be pure
[1:46:06] and let it be undefiled and let it be
[1:46:10] holy let our conversation
[1:46:13] be clean and pure our faults
[1:46:16] thinking the best things thinking god's
[1:46:18] thoughts stand up on god's program
[1:46:20] and away from the things of the world
[1:46:24] now let me say this a lot of our
[1:46:26] problems could be fixed
[1:46:27] even without medicine
[1:46:31] well they got quite there a lot of our
[1:46:35] a lot of our problems can be fixed
[1:46:36] without psychologists
[1:46:38] a lot of our problems can be fixed
[1:46:40] without psychiatry
[1:46:42] a lot of our problems can be fixed if we
[1:46:44] could get our fault life
[1:46:46] or our thought pattern under subjection
[1:46:48] of the holy ghost
[1:46:50] if we could get the thoughts or thinking
[1:46:52] under the subjection of the holy ghost
[1:46:54] by the filter of god's word which is the
[1:46:57] thank you man's filter
[1:46:58] the promise is one of the most important
[1:46:59] things we must master now remember this
[1:47:02] and especially young preachers and lay
[1:47:04] members alike there's one thing we've
[1:47:05] got to master
[1:47:06] if we expect to fulfill god's desire in
[1:47:09] our life
[1:47:10] that is we have to master the fault
[1:47:13] of human ability
[1:47:17] brother brad i didn't have something
[1:47:18] else we have to master the word like to
[1:47:22] match the expression
[1:47:23] he says you've got to master the fault
[1:47:29] if we ever get to a spot where we think
[1:47:32] we can do with our own intelligence
[1:47:34] and our own abilities we've got to
[1:47:36] master that
[1:47:37] in such a way we can get rid of the
[1:47:39] thing and lay it aside
[1:47:42] so that god can use us notice this let
[1:47:45] me say it like this
[1:47:45] you can only disguise thoughts with
[1:47:47] words and expressions for so long
[1:47:51] you can only because what is thoughts
[1:47:53] thoughts is the root
[1:47:55] is this okay fault is the roots of words
[1:47:59] it's the roots of expression see if you
[1:48:01] don't change the root
[1:48:02] it's going to continue to put forth the
[1:48:04] same fruits and the bible says this for
[1:48:06] as he thinketh in his
[1:48:07] heart so is he or i said first thing
[1:48:10] friends
[1:48:11] is the preparation of the human heart he
[1:48:14] said for years
[1:48:14] they didn't think that god knew what he
[1:48:16] was talking about but they found out
[1:48:18] there was actually mental faculties in
[1:48:19] there
[1:48:20] he said but right in the human heart is
[1:48:22] a little compartment
[1:48:24] in the middle of the human heart that
[1:48:25] doesn't even have a blood cell in it
[1:48:27] it is the occupation
[1:48:30] to the soul he said so man really thinks
[1:48:33] with his heart
[1:48:35] and not with his head
[1:48:39] oh mercy notice this a good man out of
[1:48:41] the good treasure of his heart bringeth
[1:48:43] forth that which is good and an evil man
[1:48:45] out of the evil treasure of his heart
[1:48:46] bringing forth that which is evil for
[1:48:48] out of the abundance of the heart
[1:48:49] his mouth speaketh think of this think
[1:48:52] of this
[1:48:52] remember said it's got to be a change a
[1:48:55] change of heart
[1:48:56] not the physical thing amen but the
[1:48:58] heart of your soul something
[1:49:00] anchors somebody say that with me
[1:49:01] something anchors something anchors
[1:49:04] to your thoughts that way is dull you
[1:49:07] don't see that no more
[1:49:08] you just see the lord jesus you just see
[1:49:10] righteousness and holiness and purity
[1:49:12] and love and grace
[1:49:14] he said what is a convert means to me
[1:49:16] change something over
[1:49:17] and your thoughts your habits your being
[1:49:20] has been changed from a sinner to a
[1:49:23] christian
[1:49:23] first thing you know and in your heart
[1:49:25] then you express it with your
[1:49:27] lips that it materializes and that's
[1:49:30] what you are
[1:49:34] now if you think you're thinking but you
[1:49:36] imagine you're thinking he said see and
[1:49:37] doesn't materialize and you're on the
[1:49:38] wrong road
[1:49:39] look if you imagine you're a christian
[1:49:40] and you speak it out with your lips
[1:49:42] but you find out that you're not you
[1:49:43] better get your thoughts changed
[1:49:45] get your heart changed because it
[1:49:47] doesn't bear the record
[1:49:49] it doesn't bear fruit you're expressing
[1:49:52] something here
[1:49:54] that's not in here
[1:49:58] my you're expressing something in here
[1:50:01] that's not in here now watch this he
[1:50:04] says like this
[1:50:04] david said i fall on my ways and turn my
[1:50:07] feet in our testimonies
[1:50:08] you realize this morning church your
[1:50:10] thoughts are louder in heaven than they
[1:50:13] are up on the earth
[1:50:16] your thoughts right now are crying
[1:50:18] louder in heaven than they are upon the
[1:50:20] earth
[1:50:21] now look what the bible says the bible
[1:50:23] says keep which means guard thy heart
[1:50:26] with all diligence for out of it are the
[1:50:28] issues of life
[1:50:29] the bible said this way he said keep
[1:50:31] your heart right with god
[1:50:33] and everything else comes all right
[1:50:38] keep that spirit right from everything
[1:50:40] from that spirit this
[1:50:41] way of perish whether it's houses land
[1:50:43] homes
[1:50:44] health whatever it may be it's
[1:50:46] perishable and it'll go right straight
[1:50:47] back that spirit again
[1:50:49] and right back in the spirit again keep
[1:50:50] that right no matter what you hear in
[1:50:52] this world
[1:50:53] what you have in god keep your heart in
[1:50:55] tune with god
[1:50:56] if that's right with god he said then
[1:50:58] you may not have houses
[1:51:00] you may not have lands you may not have
[1:51:02] money he said but if your heart
[1:51:03] is right with god he said you'll come
[1:51:06] forth in the resurrection
[1:51:08] as certain as there's a god in heaven
[1:51:12] are you hearing me if it's not right
[1:51:14] with god you're going to take the other
[1:51:16] route
[1:51:16] now see it like this what are you saying
[1:51:18] brother batman gives us instructions i
[1:51:20] hope i'm coming to a close i hope this
[1:51:22] is a help
[1:51:22] remember i'm giving instructions on
[1:51:24] receiving the holy ghost he said i'll
[1:51:26] just keep your hands up
[1:51:27] keep your head praying keep your heart
[1:51:30] filled
[1:51:30] just saying lord i believe you notice
[1:51:34] this
[1:51:34] he takes it all the way in by the bread
[1:51:36] to the receiver the holy ghost
[1:51:38] with the fault word expression he says
[1:51:41] keep your heart
[1:51:42] keep your mind keep your hands up keep
[1:51:45] your head praying
[1:51:47] keep your heart filled amen and see
[1:51:50] amen your heart amen is the source of
[1:51:53] words
[1:51:54] your heart is where the words are coming
[1:51:56] from and he's saying just keep your
[1:51:58] heart saying lord i believe you
[1:52:00] what are you saying church i'm saying
[1:52:02] this if we're going to get out of this
[1:52:04] world
[1:52:04] if we're going to leave here with
[1:52:06] victory we're going to have to have a
[1:52:07] change of heart
[1:52:10] change the negative
[1:52:14] let the positive come in oh mercy
[1:52:18] brother andrew you don't realize my
[1:52:19] family is a negative family we'll change
[1:52:21] it
[1:52:24] well brother andrew you don't realize i
[1:52:25] i'm a negative person well there's a god
[1:52:27] here by the holy ghost who can change
[1:52:29] you
[1:52:31] being negative is not spiritual
[1:52:37] see the human mind was chosen in the
[1:52:39] battlegrounds of the greatest male ever
[1:52:40] fought
[1:52:41] but i said see he said now notice
[1:52:43] there's a few minutes here and i'm done
[1:52:45] he said notice when this great battle
[1:52:46] started on earth there had to be
[1:52:49] a mutual meeting place there had to be a
[1:52:51] place selected
[1:52:52] for the battle to begin and for the
[1:52:54] battle to reach
[1:52:55] and that battlegrounds begin in the
[1:52:57] human mind
[1:52:59] there is where the human mind
[1:53:03] was chosen for the place of the battle
[1:53:05] where it was beginning and that
[1:53:06] is because that decisions are made from
[1:53:09] the mind the head
[1:53:11] see now they never started it from
[1:53:13] organization or from mechanical affair
[1:53:15] therefore the organization can never do
[1:53:17] the work of god he said you've got to
[1:53:19] meet your enemy
[1:53:20] is in your mind you've got to make your
[1:53:22] choice now when brother man preaches the
[1:53:24] greatest bad ever fault have you ever
[1:53:25] noticed how he keeps referring
[1:53:27] to a little girl
[1:53:30] it's an accident it's called the
[1:53:33] greatest believer phone
[1:53:34] he's referring to a little girl he keeps
[1:53:36] saying a little sister
[1:53:37] i want you to keep this in mind he keeps
[1:53:39] referring her he said like miss i want
[1:53:41] this little girl here
[1:53:42] that's very sick to be sure and listen
[1:53:44] out real closely
[1:53:45] notice this why was he doing that
[1:53:47] because he was introducing
[1:53:49] ame i'm coming to close so don't get
[1:53:50] nervous okay he's introducing the key to
[1:53:53] victory
[1:53:54] is the changing of your thoughts
[1:53:58] now we've got to get this certain thing
[1:54:00] fixed he said let this mind be in you
[1:54:02] which was also in christ jesus if this
[1:54:05] church
[1:54:06] right now could be put together and
[1:54:08] knitted together
[1:54:09] with such that every person would be in
[1:54:12] one accord
[1:54:13] with what one shadowed out anywhere
[1:54:14] there would not be a feeble person
[1:54:17] in our midst in another five minutes
[1:54:20] he said yeah there would not be nobody
[1:54:22] here desiring the holy ghost
[1:54:24] but what we're receiving if you could
[1:54:26] just get that certain thing fixed
[1:54:28] now remember it's not christian science
[1:54:32] it's not mind over matter he said the
[1:54:34] mind accepts the life
[1:54:36] which is the word of god and there it
[1:54:38] brings the life just your thought
[1:54:40] doesn't do it
[1:54:41] but the word of god oh god
[1:54:46] but the word of god brought in the
[1:54:48] channel of your thoughts see
[1:54:49] it's not the fault as christian science
[1:54:51] makes it no that isn't it
[1:54:52] it's your mind accepts it and it grasps
[1:54:55] it
[1:54:56] even when it's in your mind controlled
[1:54:57] by your spirit
[1:54:59] and your spirit catches the word of god
[1:55:01] and the thing that's got life in it
[1:55:03] it brings life into you are you hearing
[1:55:05] me amen oh brother
[1:55:06] when that takes place when life comes
[1:55:09] down the channel
[1:55:11] into you the word of god is manifesting
[1:55:13] you if you abide in me
[1:55:14] my words about you ask what you will he
[1:55:17] said see the
[1:55:18] word amen is the spin and the spirit
[1:55:20] your mind
[1:55:21] catches the word and brings it in
[1:55:24] and grasp it what's it do brother it
[1:55:26] gets a hold of it
[1:55:27] amen it lays claim on it and it don't
[1:55:29] turn loose at it he said see it's not
[1:55:31] where your emotions are set
[1:55:33] he said it's where your heart sits you
[1:55:35] all remember the young girl
[1:55:36] the rem said the psychiatrist come in
[1:55:38] and saw her one time he said she
[1:55:39] he come in and he began talking to her
[1:55:41] and he said have you ever been have you
[1:55:42] ever had smoke
[1:55:43] she said no he should have you ever
[1:55:45] drank she said no
[1:55:46] he said you ever been with a boy she
[1:55:48] said no everyone said see he told her
[1:55:50] you're not living life he said you're
[1:55:54] not living my roommate said what he died
[1:55:56] that's what he said
[1:55:56] now him being a psychiatrist he swung
[1:55:59] the girl's mind
[1:56:03] he swung the girl's mind until now
[1:56:07] she's become so evil and so bad till she
[1:56:10] don't even want to hear
[1:56:12] the name of jesus spoke in her presence
[1:56:14] brother russell how
[1:56:15] did she get in that condition because a
[1:56:18] psychiatrist
[1:56:19] amen swung her mind amen at the same
[1:56:22] time
[1:56:22] he said it's because she turned
[1:56:24] [Music]
[1:56:26] her thoughts from christ unto what that
[1:56:29] psychiatrist was moving her mind
[1:56:30] and that's what oh my brother bradley
[1:56:33] said and that's what we're here this
[1:56:34] morning
[1:56:35] he said we're here this morning is to
[1:56:37] move your mind
[1:56:38] and your thinking from the things of the
[1:56:40] world
[1:56:41] under the things of god which is eternal
[1:56:44] and that's what preaching is for
[1:56:45] is to pervert the thinking to a higher
[1:56:48] and better to the place
[1:56:50] where christ is until you become
[1:56:52] converted in your mind
[1:56:54] amen help me somebody then your mind
[1:56:56] reach
[1:56:57] reaches for those things which are above
[1:57:00] let me say this church
[1:57:01] i thank god for this message you say
[1:57:05] blender why do you thank god for this
[1:57:06] message
[1:57:06] because brother russell this message
[1:57:08] amen challenges every thought i ever had
[1:57:11] it challenges every direction or you
[1:57:13] hear me what good would the message be
[1:57:15] if it didn't challenge our preaching if
[1:57:18] it didn't challenge our theology
[1:57:19] this message challenged and it caused us
[1:57:22] amen to begin to reach into our hearts
[1:57:24] it begin to cause us amen to reach into
[1:57:27] the unknown where god is
[1:57:30] what are you saying i'm saying this sure
[1:57:33] he said
[1:57:33] life comes amen that kind of life comes
[1:57:36] when it becomes miserable now notice
[1:57:38] this
[1:57:38] you got a psychiatrist amen i'm gonna
[1:57:40] take a little liberty here
[1:57:41] you've got a psychiatrist a man over
[1:57:44] here swinging a girl's mind
[1:57:45] swinging our ambitions swinging our
[1:57:47] emotions swinging
[1:57:49] in our mind for the wrestle until he
[1:57:51] destroyed that girl's life
[1:57:53] he swung her mind so far and then but at
[1:57:55] the same time
[1:57:56] amen you've got to swing in her mind
[1:57:58] there's a prophet standing
[1:58:00] and saying whether or not this could be

[2:02:31] everything free from you and keep on
[2:02:33] going
[2:02:34] paul says if we hold fast the confidence
[2:02:37] and the rejoice of hope firm unto the
[2:02:39] end another place
[2:02:41] let us hold fast our profession another
[2:02:43] place let us hold fast
[2:02:44] the profession of our faith without
[2:02:46] wavering
[2:02:49] and he said abraham you're old your
[2:02:51] strength is gone
[2:02:53] your arms are withered up your manhood's
[2:02:55] gone
[2:02:56] i'm your mother just take a hold
[2:03:01] are you hearing me church take a hold of
[2:03:03] my promise
[2:03:05] and be satisfied while
[2:03:09] you're waiting be rested
[2:03:13] now that's why everybody for no matter
[2:03:14] how bad the cancer's got you
[2:03:16] how long you've been sitting in a
[2:03:17] wheelchair any of those things
[2:03:20] just if you can grasp that revelation
[2:03:25] from god then be satisfied
[2:03:28] knowing that it's going to happen
[2:03:31] because faith waits patiently for the
[2:03:32] promise
[2:03:33] when god speaks he makes preparation
[2:03:37] for the fulfilling of what he has spoken
[2:03:42] you love him this morning
[2:03:45] god speaks to you you'll see god see his
[2:03:47] power see his resurrection
[2:03:48] if you can feel it way down in your
[2:03:50] heart then accept him and accept his
[2:03:52] word
[2:03:52] if you can feel it way down in your
[2:03:54] heart that is true
[2:03:56] then just go right on make preparations
[2:03:58] because everything's going to be
[2:04:01] all right
[2:04:04] look at this little gross book of the
[2:04:06] night maybe the little ladies you're not
[2:04:07] with a baby
[2:04:08] that had the foot hanging down from zion
[2:04:10] she was so certain this woman was so
[2:04:12] certain
[2:04:12] that the baby was going to walk so she
[2:04:14] went and got her pair of shoes
[2:04:15] and come down for it to be prayed for i
[2:04:17] love this brother brad
[2:04:19] and then when she crossed the platform
[2:04:21] to pray for her she looked at the baby
[2:04:23] tried its foot and
[2:04:24] it was no better so she went down to
[2:04:26] mother's and mother knew i was going out
[2:04:27] to the office so they sent the girl out
[2:04:29] there
[2:04:29] and the little girl came in and i said
[2:04:30] was it you lady that was prayed last
[2:04:32] night
[2:04:32] said yes said but you know the lord
[2:04:34] spoke to me and said for me to bring my
[2:04:36] baby to you and you and you laid your
[2:04:37] hands on my baby it was going to walk
[2:04:39] i said well then that's all it's
[2:04:40] necessary god said it that's all we have
[2:04:42] to do just believe it
[2:04:42] except but the baby's not walking
[2:04:46] i said that don't have anything to do
[2:04:48] with
[2:04:50] if you're certain you won't be
[2:04:52] questioning
[2:04:53] so we prayed and laid hands on the baby
[2:04:55] and i said sister i could stand to do it
[2:04:57] all day now
[2:04:57] if you're certain and you really believe
[2:04:59] it'll happen it'll certainly be that way
[2:05:01] and then when she started out she wanted
[2:05:03] to hear she wanted to hear
[2:05:05] she wanted to hear me say something else
[2:05:07] poor little fella little lady
[2:05:08] are you here not raise your hand if you
[2:05:10] are he said somebody was here the other
[2:05:11] night when she was here
[2:05:13] he said notice she was certainly going
[2:05:15] to heal that baby but she wanted me to
[2:05:17] say something about it
[2:05:18] and then she needed something to hold on
[2:05:20] to he meant well i'd already told the
[2:05:22] brethren here
[2:05:23] i said just won't watch so when this
[2:05:24] went out of the room kind of
[2:05:25] disappointed a little kind
[2:05:26] of crying she looked back a little hubby
[2:05:28] went on out so when she looked back and
[2:05:30] she said reverend branham
[2:05:31] i said yes ma'am she said is it god's
[2:05:34] will
[2:05:34] for my baby to be a she just
[2:05:38] wanted to hear what i was going to say
[2:05:41] pulled it right out i said no ma'am
[2:05:45] it's not and she said thank you sir
[2:05:48] and out the door she went and about a
[2:05:50] week after that
[2:05:51] the little baby's leg come down normally
[2:05:53] and well
[2:05:54] see just hold on to it
[2:05:58] get a hold of something and hold on to
[2:06:00] it
[2:06:01] even the baby was healed the word i'm
[2:06:04] done out here
[2:06:04] if i don't quit austin come tackle me
[2:06:06] are you hearing me
[2:06:07] the word was settled even by his stripes
[2:06:11] that baby was healed that word circled
[2:06:13] for years
[2:06:14] but when that baby's foot was hanging
[2:06:16] ain't then the problem of god prayed but
[2:06:18] it did change
[2:06:19] but that woman needed something to hold
[2:06:20] up she needed something
[2:06:22] that she could fight the devil with and
[2:06:24] i'll sit like this this
[2:06:25] i bet for an entire week every time that
[2:06:27] devil said your baby
[2:06:29] is never going to walk she looked at
[2:06:31] that devil and said but god's prophet
[2:06:32] said
[2:06:33] it's not god's will for my baby to be a
[2:06:35] and about seven days later
[2:06:37] that baby's leg come normal what are you
[2:06:40] saying i'm saying when god
[2:06:42] drops the revelation of anything in your
[2:06:44] heart
[2:06:46] you hold on to it you fight the devil
[2:06:48] with it
[2:06:49] as a good soldier let our music players
[2:06:52] come
[2:06:52] fight the devil with your profession
[2:06:55] with your confession
[2:07:04] brother branham right now in that
[2:07:05] message spoken word original seed
[2:07:08] i was out hunting several months ago now
[2:07:10] this of that tape for brad
[2:07:12] preached on that spokeswoman to see he
[2:07:14] went about the boy i said
[2:07:17] i'm about to go with you you hear me
[2:07:20] this
[2:07:21] when you get something to hold on to
[2:07:23] hold on to it church

[2:07:31] has been proven right it's thus
[2:07:35] something i'm saying right now we've got
[2:07:38] cowards around this message
[2:07:40] that they preached this message and they
[2:07:41] went around the world and they they got
[2:07:43] ministries off this message
[2:07:45] and now they're cowards they've been
[2:07:46] sitting behind youtube
[2:07:48] cameras and screens and putting this
[2:07:51] message on trial
[2:07:52] guy the other day sent me a clip said
[2:07:53] somebody's putting the message on trial
[2:07:55] i said well you tell that brother he's
[2:07:57] about 56 years late
[2:07:58] because william branham himself put his
[2:08:01] own message on trial
[2:08:02] before the entire world about seven
[2:08:05] times
[2:08:05] and every time amen the judge of all
[2:08:08] judges
[2:08:09] come down in the building and said it's
[2:08:11] the truth
[2:08:12] it's the truth it's settled what are you
[2:08:14] saying
[2:08:15] i'm saying this message is settled in
[2:08:17] heaven it's settled upon the earth
[2:08:20] it's settled in my heart i'm a believer
[2:08:22] and i'm gonna hold on to it
[2:08:24] i'm gonna fight the devil with it
[2:08:28] it's the confession of our heart won't

[2:09:16] certain sound
[2:09:19] no matter what happens we've heard
[2:09:23] sound words
[2:09:27] y'all ever heard of a man named
[2:09:28] congressman shaw
[2:09:32] i want to give this to you in the early
[2:09:36] 1900s madison was nowhere where it is
[2:09:38] today
[2:09:39] william upshaw was an 18 year old boy
[2:09:41] when he fell and broke his spine
[2:09:43] and become an inland at the turn of the
[2:09:44] century and that was worse than anyone
[2:09:46] could imagine
[2:09:47] an 18 year old boy had come to terms he
[2:09:50] may never walk again
[2:09:54] the next seven years
[2:09:57] would be spent in a bed
[2:10:00] eventually he would learn to walk again
[2:10:04] with crutches he called his little
[2:10:07] buddies
[2:10:11] he faced challenges
[2:10:14] but he built inner strength
[2:10:18] by holding fast to sound words
[2:10:22] titus said sound speech that cannot be
[2:10:24] condemned that he is of the contrary
[2:10:26] part may be ashamed having no evil thing
[2:10:28] to say of you
[2:10:30] can i can i give you three words three
[2:10:32] three phrases
[2:10:33] you might want to put these in your
[2:10:34] phone or write them down on a notepad
[2:10:36] these were the three phrases that
[2:10:39] william upshaw became famous for
[2:10:42] the first one was let nothing discourage
[2:10:45] you
[2:10:49] let nothing discourage you you know what
[2:10:52] the second one was
[2:10:53] never give up

[2:11:29] set time genesis 21
[2:11:31] amen at this set time in which god has

[2:12:14] amen and he got up and he began walking
[2:12:20] all through those depressing days and
[2:12:22] negative times
