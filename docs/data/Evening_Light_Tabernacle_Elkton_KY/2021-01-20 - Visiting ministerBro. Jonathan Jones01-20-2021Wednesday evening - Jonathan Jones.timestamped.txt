[19:17] y'all know my love for the youth and i
[19:19] see a gift god's placed in her life and
[19:21] you see some of the songs that she's
[19:23] wrote and
[19:24] wrote that was a good one
[19:28] and but you know what god places
[19:32] his gifts in his body and if we let him
[19:35] use them
[19:36] they're a blessing to each every one of
[19:38] us and tell you what i'm just
[19:40] happy in the lord and you said it's
[19:42] inauguration day we got a new president
[19:44] but i still have the same god
[19:46] and he ain't changed from yesterday and
[19:47] he ain't going to change tomorrow
[19:49] and he still promised me a rapture is
[19:51] coming for me and if it takes another
[19:53] president to get me there then bring him
[19:55] on
[19:56] because i'm striving and i'm desiring to
[19:58] go to that heavenly home
[20:00] amen turn in your bibles tonight if you
[20:02] would first chronicles
[20:04] first chronicles 22.
[20:08] there's some of this just trying to come
[20:09] into my mind this evening and
[20:11] sitting in the back room and i pray to
[20:14] be a blessing to you i think
[20:16] we are living in the last day and i
[20:18] think
[20:19] you know sometimes it gets common and we
[20:22] say it too much
[20:23] maybe and it gets common on our
[20:26] minds but we need to open our eyes and
[20:28] realize the hand welding handwriting's
[20:30] on the wall
[20:31] we need to realize the signs of the time
[20:32] are amongst us you need to realize that
[20:35] we're living
[20:35] the day that god promised was coming for
[20:38] his bride
[20:39] i'm not sure exactly the title is laying
[20:41] on my heart
[20:42] god's prayer god's plan
[20:48] god god's battle plan
[20:51] for his bride god's battle plan for his
[20:53] bride
[20:54] i don't believe god goes unnoticed i
[20:57] don't believe he goes surprised
[20:58] i believe he knows what we're facing and
[21:00] i believe he has everything that we need
[21:03] to get out of here and
[21:04] we find in the scripture just to lay a
[21:05] little background first
[21:07] chronic verse 28 did i say 20 what did i
[21:09] say 22
[21:11] then david said this is the house
[21:14] of the lord god and this is the altar of
[21:17] the burnt offering for israel
[21:19] and david commanded to gather together
[21:21] the strangers that was in the land of
[21:23] israel
[21:24] and he sent these masons to whoever
[21:26] wrote stones to build the house of god
[21:29] david prepared iron in abundance for the
[21:31] nails of the door and the gates
[21:33] for the joinings and the brass and the
[21:35] abundance without weights
[21:37] and also cedar trees in abundance for
[21:40] the zeneons and
[21:42] that they detail would brought much
[21:44] cedar wood to david
[21:45] and david said solomon my son is younger
[21:48] and tender
[21:50] and the house that is to be builded for
[21:51] the lord must be exceedingly
[21:54] magnificent a frame and of glory and
[21:58] throughout all countries i will
[21:59] therefore now
[22:00] make preparation for it and so david
[22:03] prepared abundantly
[22:05] before his death and he called solomon
[22:08] his son and he charged him to build
[22:10] a house for the lord god and david said
[22:13] unto solomon my son
[22:15] as for me it is in my mind to build a
[22:17] house for the name
[22:19] of the lord my god let's get down to
[22:21] verse 14
[22:22] and says now behold in my trouble i have
[22:25] prepared
[22:27] for the house of the lord a hundred
[22:29] thousand talents of gold
[22:31] a thousand thousand talents of silver
[22:34] and breasts and iron without weight
[22:36] for it is an abundance timber also in
[22:38] stone have i prepared
[22:40] that there mayest add there too and
[22:43] moreover there are workmen in their
[22:45] abundance
[22:46] hearers and workers of stone and timber
[22:49] and all the manner of cunning men of
[22:51] every manner of work
[22:52] of gold in a silver and a brass and of
[22:56] iron and there is no number arise
[22:58] therefore
[22:59] and be doing that the lord be with thee
[23:02] david also commanded under the princes
[23:04] of israel to help solomon his son
[23:06] saying it is not the lord your god with
[23:09] you
[23:10] for he has not given you rest
[23:14] on every side for he has given the
[23:16] inhabitants of the land of my hand
[23:18] and the land subdued before the lord
[23:20] before his people
[23:22] now set your heart and your soul to seek
[23:26] the lord your god
[23:27] arise therefore and build you a
[23:29] sanctuary of the lord
[23:31] god and to bring the ark of the covenant
[23:33] of the lord and the holy vegetables of
[23:35] god
[23:36] into the house that is to be built in
[23:39] the name
[23:40] of the lord let's just say a word of
[23:41] prayer heavenly father
[23:43] lord we thank you for another
[23:44] opportunity together under your
[23:47] blessing lord under your roof lord that
[23:50] we could hear
[23:50] from your word lord what i believe is
[23:53] we're drawing nigh to the end we need to
[23:55] be encouraged
[23:57] we need to be given into war lord we
[24:00] need to be
[24:01] ready for the battle because it is at
[24:03] hand
[24:04] lord i asked you to touch this lord i
[24:05] asked you to
[24:07] relieve me lord of my duties of what i'm
[24:09] able to do lord and speak through this
[24:11] vessel lord
[24:13] move me aside lord that you may say
[24:15] something to your people
[24:16] lord you know with our needs you know
[24:18] the desires you know their hearts lord i
[24:21] ask you to bless them
[24:22] in your lovely name we pray amen and
[24:25] amen and you'll be seated
[24:27] my thought is try to go back and i don't
[24:30] read the bible as much as i would like
[24:32] but
[24:32] i try to go back and read the bible and
[24:35] and see what is laying in there for us
[24:37] because i believe we're living in a time
[24:40] that god has a battle plan that he has
[24:42] prepared for us
[24:43] he's prepared a battle plan for a bride
[24:45] to go into a rapture
[24:47] he knew that it wouldn't be easy from
[24:49] the beginning but yet
[24:50] he never gets tucked back he never gets
[24:53] took astray that
[24:54] he doesn't prepare what we have need of
[24:57] and as i was beginning to read and we
[24:59] know
[25:00] later earlier we heard that there was a
[25:02] prophecy went forth that solomon would
[25:04] build this
[25:05] point and i began to look as david knew
[25:08] in his heart
[25:09] this was the plan of god that this plan
[25:12] was to
[25:13] build this this sanctuary for the for
[25:15] the word to be stored in
[25:17] but yet he knew solomon had to do it but
[25:19] yet david knew
[25:20] he could prepare the way and he began to
[25:23] prepare
[25:24] all of the wood and all of the gold and
[25:26] all of the silver the iron so much
[25:28] he began to repair it why
[25:31] because there was a battle coming that
[25:33] had to be victorious
[25:35] and a battle don't just pop up and you
[25:37] win there's a training aspect there's a
[25:39] there's a
[25:40] pre-planning of that battle for you to
[25:42] overcome that battle
[25:43] and i believe that david knew all that
[25:46] would come against solomon in building
[25:48] that temple
[25:49] but yet he would prepare him everything
[25:51] that he had need of and god
[25:53] help us to not to see that's why god
[25:55] sent a prophet in our day
[25:57] to prepare us for this battle that god
[25:59] has for us
[26:00] to prepare us everything that we have
[26:03] needed to be able to overcome the devil
[26:05] at his greatest
[26:06] in satan's eating when he's at his
[26:08] greatest tempters of all
[26:10] to be able to overcome and win that
[26:13] battle
[26:13] and i began to think yeah here is david
[26:16] david knew how real it would be
[26:19] he knew how the devil knew that this was
[26:21] the plan of god
[26:23] he knew how david will or the dead the
[26:25] devil would come against solomon in
[26:27] every way
[26:28] and so yet he set out
[26:32] to prepare for the battle he said to
[26:35] prepare for the building of this
[26:36] tabernacle
[26:37] and he set all of these things in place
[26:39] and he said now solomon be of good
[26:41] courage
[26:42] this is what god has for you to do i
[26:44] think oh god
[26:46] in a day we need encouragement to know
[26:48] this is what god has the bride to do
[26:51] god has placed in us to go into a
[26:53] rapture he has placed in us
[26:55] to live in 2021 he has placed in
[26:58] us when the world's fallen apart to be a
[27:01] strong tower
[27:02] for those that don't have the faith he
[27:04] has placed in us
[27:05] to be examples to the world to let them
[27:08] see
[27:08] we are the bride of christ that christ
[27:10] is still living in this world
[27:13] and you know what i believe that god
[27:15] didn't go into this unattended
[27:16] he didn't go into this thinking that oh
[27:18] yeah they're figured out when they get
[27:20] there
[27:21] no he pre-planned this exactly to the t
[27:24] of what we would go through he
[27:26] pre-planned the battles that we would
[27:28] overcome
[27:28] he preparing the character that we would
[27:30] build in ourselves
[27:32] he pre-planned all of this because he
[27:34] knows what we're going to face in this
[27:36] day
[27:36] he knows what we're going to come
[27:38] against in this day he knows the faith
[27:40] that we need
[27:41] he knows the strength that we need and
[27:43] so he laid a battle plan
[27:47] he laid this battle plan out so that we
[27:49] would know
[27:50] you said you believe we're living that
[27:52] we're living in that day now
[27:54] we're living in the day that it's the
[27:56] time for her battle
[27:57] it's the time for a bride to stand up
[28:00] and be recognized for who she
[28:02] is it's time for a bride to recognize
[28:04] who she is
[28:05] and to take action in the fact that god
[28:07] has called her on the scene now
[28:10] i began to think oh god one of my
[28:13] favorite stories from a childhood all
[28:15] the way up was the three hebrew children
[28:17] and the three who were children would
[28:19] come out and that they would stand
[28:21] and they would stand for the word of god
[28:23] and they would stand in the face of the
[28:25] king
[28:26] against all of the critics against the
[28:28] body that looked down up on them
[28:30] but yet when they went to that fiery
[28:32] party god would stand for them
[28:34] but i begin to think oh god
[28:37] it didn't start on the day that they
[28:40] asked him to bow to the image
[28:41] it started years before that it started
[28:44] in pre-planning us
[28:46] as children in school it started as
[28:50] teachers would begin to teach them the
[28:51] scrolls of the bible
[28:53] what the prophets had said what all of
[28:55] this was planning
[28:56] because there was coming a battle one
[28:58] day you know what they never would have
[29:00] overcome it if they wouldn't have
[29:01] listened in sunday school
[29:03] if they wouldn't have listened to the
[29:04] preaching of the word if they wouldn't
[29:06] had an experience of themselves
[29:08] that wasn't their first experience with
[29:10] god helping them out
[29:12] they had been through trials before
[29:13] they've been through you know you know
[29:15] just help me to say this right
[29:16] but you know we get this complexion we
[29:18] get this mental image
[29:20] in our heads that these men in the bible
[29:23] never did anything
[29:25] wrong and was always right in god's eyes
[29:28] no they was human
[29:29] living in situations in their lives they
[29:32] had stubbed their toes they had failed
[29:33] they had made mistakes
[29:35] but they realized that even when they
[29:36] made a mistake god would pick them back
[29:39] up again
[29:40] what was he doing he was preparing them
[29:43] for that oh
[29:44] he was preparing them he said what is it
[29:47] brother madam would say one place
[29:48] he says god is molding your character
[29:51] for what is coming to you
[29:53] what is trying to mold you and get you
[29:55] ready and i could see it's maybe the
[29:57] three children they would go down
[29:59] they had recognized daniel was their
[30:02] prophet
[30:03] so so many of us that's our problem we
[30:05] still don't recognize our prophets
[30:07] we want to say that we believe him but
[30:09] we really don't recognize it yet
[30:11] it hasn't settled in how do you say that
[30:13] because we
[30:14] question what he said what happened in
[30:16] our day we questioned and tried to go
[30:18] against everything that he said
[30:21] no i don't understand how did they come
[30:23] against the man
[30:24] how did they come against a man that was
[30:25] so vindicated of god how did they come
[30:27] against him how did they come against
[30:29] the word
[30:29] because the perverted of the evil one
[30:32] the evil one is always going to come
[30:34] against the prophets
[30:36] so that they stood in daniel's day
[30:38] daniel's the prophet of their day
[30:40] they had to recognize who the prophet of
[30:43] their day was
[30:44] they had to get under his teaching they
[30:46] had to get under his ministry
[30:48] they had to listen to the words that
[30:50] daniel said oh god help us we gotta
[30:52] listen to what the tates is trying to
[30:54] tell us
[30:57] he's trying to prepare us for battle
[31:00] but you know what we get all excited
[31:02] it's kind of like watching a football
[31:04] game we love it when the receiver
[31:06] catches 100 yard touchdown pass and
[31:08] everybody jumps up and down
[31:10] but nobody likes it when that guy's out
[31:12] there monday morning and he's running
[31:13] sprints
[31:14] what is he doing he's preparing for
[31:17] what's coming on his
[31:18] field he's preparing to get ready to do
[31:21] what he's paid to do
[31:22] to do what the talent in his body is to
[31:25] do he don't just show up one day so i'm
[31:27] here now i'm the greatest little man
[31:29] no he's got to prepare
[31:32] he's got a plan he's got to practice
[31:35] he's got to train
[31:36] you know god help us to see the things
[31:39] that we're going through in our life
[31:40] right now
[31:41] it's just the training ground it's just
[31:43] preparing
[31:44] to get us ready for that final battle i
[31:47] wanted to throw him good shooting would
[31:49] have
[31:49] stubbed their toe and set a cuff word if
[31:51] they'd just quit and just walked away
[31:53] and act like nothing had happened
[31:55] that had never been able to finish what
[31:58] god called them to do
[32:00] that had never been able to finish the
[32:02] first time i lost
[32:03] come upon them if they said oh i'm not
[32:05] worthy i can't go on
[32:07] but yet god had called them to a miracle
[32:09] he had coupled them
[32:10] to release them and bring them out of
[32:12] that furry pit
[32:15] what they had to realize this is another
[32:17] trial
[32:18] this is just something i'm going through
[32:20] children of god we got to realize as the
[32:22] bride of christ
[32:23] we are humans in this flesh we are
[32:25] living in these temples
[32:27] that are so craving of the world we're
[32:29] going to have thoughts we're going to
[32:31] have these hearts but there's something
[32:33] on the inside
[32:34] said yes but god said i was his bride
[32:37] even when i fall down i know to roll
[32:40] over on my knees
[32:41] and say god you forgive me of this you
[32:43] know in my heart that's not what i
[32:45] wanted to do
[32:47] what is it it's preparing me
[32:50] for god's battle you know what
[32:54] i don't believe for a second that when
[32:56] lucifer fell from heaven
[32:58] that it surprised god god knew what was
[33:01] going to happen
[33:03] he planned it out and set it up so that
[33:05] he would do it
[33:06] because he knew what was on the intent
[33:08] of the heart of lucifer
[33:11] and he knew that down through the ages
[33:13] it would be a battle
[33:15] every day of the life of god he knew for
[33:18] eternity down to this time not for
[33:20] eternity
[33:21] but all the way down through time he
[33:23] knew that he would battle this spirit of
[33:25] democracy he knew that he would battle
[33:27] this theory
[33:28] of a demon warfare he knew that he would
[33:31] battle this lucifer
[33:32] he would try to desmise all of his own
[33:35] blood
[33:36] but he also knew that he had us
[33:40] beside he also knew that those that he
[33:43] had called and placed in his hand
[33:45] his father said he'd never lose a wand
[33:48] why because he knew
[33:49] he was preparing them for their battle
[33:52] you know what it ain't fun it ain't fun
[33:55] sometimes going through the things that
[33:57] we go through and
[33:58] you know i'm sure if we could look back
[34:00] we could know
[34:01] it wasn't fun on the three hebrew
[34:03] children as they walked through their
[34:04] life being made fun
[34:06] of being mocked being told why do you
[34:08] believe that prophet daniel
[34:10] why do you believe what he says i'm
[34:12] following my king
[34:14] it ain't much different than it is today
[34:16] we get made fun of why do you follow
[34:18] that prophet
[34:19] why do you follow excuse me what is he
[34:21] says he said i'm following this new
[34:24] president
[34:25] no i'm following my god and my god said
[34:28] unto me a prophet for my day
[34:30] and he told me these days were coming
[34:32] and he told me
[34:33] that they would get more evil and evil
[34:35] or every day that we went on
[34:37] and he told me before that first bomb
[34:39] drops i'll call you home
[34:43] what's he doing he's checking my faith
[34:47] he's checking my abilities checking to
[34:49] see if i have what i really say i have
[34:52] i'm going through life and i'm fighting
[34:54] battles and every day
[34:56] just a bed of roses every day look i'm
[34:58] human just like oh
[34:59] i get up some mornings and don't want to
[35:01] work
[35:03] hey man i get up some mornings and
[35:05] wonder if i even love myself
[35:08] come on i get up some mornings you just
[35:11] wanna crawl up in a cage somewhere and
[35:13] everybody leave
[35:14] oh cause i'm human
[35:17] we get on the inside something says why
[35:19] don't you say prayer
[35:21] why don't you lift your hair and tell me
[35:22] you love me why don't you get you
[35:25] to leave for work and drop your hand on
[35:27] this everywhere and say god be with me
[35:29] today
[35:30] god help me today god's truth to me
[35:32] today god i don't know why these
[35:34] circumstances are in my life
[35:35] i don't know why these things but god
[35:37] you're preparing me for something
[35:40] you're preparing me for a battle that's
[35:42] coming
[35:44] god i want to be a good soldier i want
[35:46] to listen to what you have to say to me
[35:49] i want to listen and then even when i
[35:51] fall i can get up and try a little
[35:53] harder
[35:54] or was it babe booth in baseball he
[35:56] struck out more than he hit on runs
[35:59] but that didn't stop him from getting
[36:00] back up and hitting that ball again
[36:02] that didn't stop him getting back up and
[36:04] pouring into that fence and saying it's
[36:06] mine
[36:07] why because there was something in him
[36:08] in his training that he knew what he was
[36:11] capable of doing
[36:12] oh god help us as a bride to see
[36:15] something inside of us
[36:16] that we can see what we're capable of
[36:19] doing
[36:22] what enters god our doubt
[36:26] our disbelief oh god
[36:29] i i just don't think you could do that
[36:31] for me well until you change your
[36:33] attitude he probably won't
[36:36] because he's warned you to say god if
[36:38] you did it for the shin and my woman you
[36:40] could do it for me
[36:42] if you did it for my sister you could do
[36:44] it for me
[36:45] if you could save me you could save my
[36:48] kids if you can save me you can save my
[36:50] family
[36:51] why because you're the same god of
[36:53] yesterday today
[36:55] and forever and you say you look down
[36:58] through time
[36:59] and we ain't got enough time to go
[37:00] through all the notes i jotted down
[37:03] when i walk off and leave them we look
[37:06] down through time and we see
[37:08] each one of these examples in the bible
[37:10] they was given as an example to us
[37:13] but oftentimes we don't go back and read
[37:15] the bible of love
[37:16] to know they had issues we don't go back
[37:20] and read the bible enough to know that
[37:22] it wasn't always right
[37:24] we don't have enough you know you know
[37:27] time is a time thing now nobody has time
[37:29] to do anything
[37:29] look i just used it before i started as
[37:31] an excuse
[37:33] right we all use it but we don't have
[37:35] enough time to go back
[37:36] and read for ourselves that these were
[37:38] men of god
[37:39] that went through struggles that went
[37:41] through trial as god was preparing them
[37:43] for their final war
[37:45] i think of john the baptist here comes
[37:48] john the baptist look john the baptist
[37:50] was dead in his mama's room
[37:51] his life was over before it began but
[37:54] yet at the name of jesus he sprung to
[37:56] life
[37:57] why because god had something for him to
[37:59] do
[38:00] god had a plan for him to fight he had a
[38:03] battle for him
[38:04] to win and nobody else could do it god
[38:06] couldn't raise another man up he had
[38:09] done sin
[38:10] john the baptist the one crying in the
[38:12] wilderness
[38:13] he will announce my first coming it had
[38:16] to be
[38:18] i see the devil sneaks into the womb of
[38:20] elizabeth he kills jesus
[38:22] or he kills john the baptist he says yep
[38:25] got him now he don't have the one crying
[38:27] in the wilderness
[38:29] and god goes yeah watch this devil hey
[38:32] mary go see elizabeth
[38:34] hey mary tell elizabeth you're gonna
[38:37] have a son
[38:38] and you're gonna call him jesus
[38:42] and you know what mary did oh mary had
[38:44] hard times look mary had been made fun
[38:46] of
[38:47] they're pregnant before she was married
[38:49] she'd been made fun of she'd been
[38:50] ridiculed
[38:51] her own husband thought to put her aside
[38:53] privately she had been through her trial
[38:55] she had been through her disappointments
[38:57] she'd been through her problems but yet
[38:59] she had found a redeemer
[39:00] she had found a god she found an angel
[39:03] visitation
[39:04] to let it go i called you for this mary
[39:07] i will give you what you have need of
[39:10] and mary would listen walk to elizabeth
[39:13] and say hey elizabeth
[39:16] heard maybe you're having issues well
[39:19] you know he hasn't moved
[39:20] he's dead in the womb well i'm having a
[39:24] son
[39:25] and god told me to call his name jesus
[39:28] and that baby began to kick in the womb
[39:31] why
[39:32] because there was a plan that god had in
[39:34] mind for john the baptist to do
[39:37] and he had to fulfill that and we see
[39:39] john the baptist is he would come on the
[39:41] scene he would come up and he was the
[39:43] one
[39:43] crying in the wilderness he was the one
[39:45] they didn't want in town they didn't
[39:47] want him city they didn't want nothing
[39:49] to do with him he was an old wilderness
[39:51] man
[39:52] but yet he stood in that river and he
[39:54] says i'm telling you
[39:55] he's coming one day he's coming to one
[39:58] day
[40:00] make fun of him oh it kind of sounds
[40:02] like today
[40:03] if we stand up and say i believe in a
[40:05] rapture my god is coming back for me
[40:08] because i am a part of his bride oh you
[40:10] lunatic
[40:12] yeah there's been a lot of lunatics
[40:14] through time but let me show you the
[40:16] victims that they have
[40:18] because they always come out on top
[40:22] so john the baptist is standing in that
[40:23] river one day and he says you know what
[40:26] he's here he's here amongst us now
[40:29] there's one standing here
[40:31] that his shoes i'm not worthy look
[40:34] he didn't just get there he grew
[40:39] he was a child he become a teenager so
[40:42] he said
[40:42] it was his young people i tried to get
[40:44] to him and to see
[40:45] that you know what john the baptist he
[40:47] was a teenager at one time too
[40:49] he went through things he was a youth he
[40:51] tried to be persuaded to do what the
[40:53] world wanted to do
[40:54] he had friends he had school classmates
[40:57] he had everybody else like we do that
[40:59] tried to take him
[41:00] god taught him to do but yet there was
[41:03] something on the inside of you
[41:05] he recognized his lord and savior he
[41:07] recognized who he was
[41:09] he recognized the battle that was before
[41:11] him
[41:12] and god says i've already created it out
[41:14] i've already planned it i've already
[41:16] prepped you i've already gave you all
[41:17] that you need
[41:19] no i didn't send you to a theologian
[41:21] school i didn't give you the biggest
[41:23] degree in in business that you ever had
[41:25] i sent you to the back side of the
[41:27] desert so i could get along and talk to
[41:29] you
[41:30] i could encourage you and let you know
[41:32] this is what your job is
[41:35] oh god so much of us that's what we need
[41:37] tonight
[41:38] we need a backside of the desert
[41:40] experience we need to get along with god
[41:42] somewhere and let god open our eyes to
[41:45] let us see
[41:46] what god has in store for us
[41:51] you know once god spoke to him he'd
[41:53] become a very bold man
[41:56] it didn't matter how many tomatoes they
[41:57] threw at him it didn't matter how many
[41:59] apples they threw at him it didn't
[42:00] matter
[42:02] how many men they called him he'd stand
[42:05] in that riverbank
[42:06] and said let me baptize you into this
[42:08] man because there's a savior coming one
[42:10] day
[42:11] and one day he come and you this
[42:15] we go down and we find in the scripture
[42:19] that one day john the baptist realized
[42:21] it was over
[42:23] he realized that he had done what god
[42:25] called him to do
[42:26] and he makes a statement and he says now
[42:28] that i must decrease
[42:31] so that he can increase oh god help us
[42:35] to see
[42:35] we had a prophet in this day that
[42:37] brought a message to you and i
[42:39] he brought a message of a rapture to you
[42:41] and i he gave us the preparation
[42:43] gave us the planning he gave us the
[42:45] training he told us you want to get
[42:47] closer to god
[42:48] read your bible and pray he told you
[42:51] every step that you needed to take
[42:52] he knew how to cross the fence at the
[42:55] corner post
[42:56] he showed you how to dress he showed you
[42:58] how to live your life he showed you how
[42:59] to treat your neighbor he told you
[43:01] everything
[43:02] he prepared you he planned you he puts
[43:05] you in training
[43:06] on what you must do why because there's
[43:08] coming a day
[43:09] he must decrease some of the bride can
[43:11] increase
[43:13] why because it's god's plan
[43:17] it's his plan we're improving his word i
[43:20] want to read this brother brenda says
[43:21] i'm proving in his word
[43:23] he says but god he said in the midst of
[43:25] it all he raised up a prophet
[43:28] a son of a priest he's a never he said
[43:31] he went into the wilderness
[43:32] at nine years old he couldn't read his
[43:34] name it was the letter if it was a
[43:36] letter the size of a boxcar
[43:39] why why did he do it he was a prophet
[43:42] he if he had been trained in the
[43:45] education of his father
[43:47] he'd have probably been a pharisee or a
[43:49] sadducee
[43:50] or one of those groups but he had an
[43:53] important job
[43:55] there was to announce the messiah
[43:56] because why god kept his word and he
[43:59] proved it
[44:00] a voice of one crying from the seminary
[44:02] no he says behold i've got my doctrine
[44:04] and screen no
[44:05] he said that might be the old lady's
[44:08] birthday almanac but not
[44:10] in god's word you know it sense of humor
[44:15] you know what he's trying to tell us all
[44:17] of this is a bunch of nonsense that we
[44:19] try to infiltrate in the message
[44:22] all of the you remember if we go back to
[44:24] exodus and we see that the people of
[44:26] israel
[44:27] are captives and their slavery in egypt
[44:29] and it's time for them to leave
[44:31] god tells them don't take nothing with
[44:33] you
[44:34] you can't take nothing from this world
[44:37] with you to where you're going
[44:38] you're going to a promised land you're
[44:41] going to a place
[44:42] that i prepared for you you don't need
[44:44] your things anymore
[44:46] you don't need your ideals and your
[44:47] creeds anymore i have everything
[44:50] in place hold on a bride tonight he's
[44:53] done the same for us
[44:54] he's prepared for the battle ahead of us
[44:57] he's prepared us
[44:58] for the place that we're going to he
[45:01] said everything aside
[45:03] he said little bride forget your
[45:04] denomination ideals forget you didn't
[45:07] humble no priest
[45:08] forget what you think that the world
[45:10] knows forget what business don't you
[45:12] but put your trust in my word
[45:16] because i have what you have need of
[45:20] look one day you're going to stand to
[45:23] the greatest battle of your day
[45:26] and that business degree ain't going to
[45:27] help you fight the devil
[45:30] little guy i've got a degree i'm not
[45:32] throwing off on degrees i've got a
[45:34] degree
[45:35] took me a long time to get it because i
[45:36] ain't smart
[45:38] but i got a degree and i'm pretty proud
[45:41] of it
[45:42] i mean because it took a lot of hard
[45:43] work to get that degree
[45:45] but i promise you when the devil's
[45:47] tempting me with things that i know is
[45:49] wrong
[45:50] it doesn't help me to flash my degree
[45:52] into when i got a business
[45:55] he don't care he don't care how much i
[45:58] know
[45:59] it doesn't prompt me to to flash a quote
[46:02] and say well i believe the prophet
[46:04] he don't care he believes the prophet
[46:07] he believes this message he knows this
[46:10] message is true more than most of us
[46:12] know that it's true
[46:13] he realizes the plan that god has placed
[46:16] against him
[46:16] he knows that he's not going to win
[46:20] but he's a good adversary he's going to
[46:22] keep fighting
[46:24] but i promise you this when i stand
[46:26] there before that trial
[46:28] and i forget my degree and i forget
[46:31] about what i know
[46:33] and i forget about the quotes that i've
[46:34] memorized i forget about the scripture
[46:37] that i've memorized
[46:38] and i forget about the studies that i've
[46:40] done and i say oh god i'll let you speak
[46:43] for me
[46:43] because your scripture says in those
[46:45] times just hush because i'll speak for
[46:48] you
[46:49] and i guarantee you that when i sit
[46:51] there you know what happens
[46:52] god begins to speak through these lips
[46:56] you mean he speaks oh yes he speaks
[46:58] through these lips
[47:00] and the devil knows he's in trouble
[47:03] listening to brother brethren
[47:05] at the end the angel of the lord is
[47:07] there
[47:09] brenham is in in in full mode of of
[47:12] surrender to the holy spirit
[47:15] and all of a sudden god begins to speak
[47:17] through brother branham
[47:19] and he makes the comment this is not
[47:23] william branham why
[47:27] because you know what brother branham
[47:29] come to the point
[47:30] that he laid everything he had aside he
[47:33] laid all of his thoughts aside
[47:35] and he said god would you come in and
[47:37] would you take control
[47:39] and god looked down amongst his people
[47:41] and he saw the battles that they was
[47:43] facing
[47:44] he saw the temptations that they was
[47:46] facing and he said let me speak to him
[47:48] for a while
[47:49] let me tell them like i told moses i am
[47:52] the i
[47:53] am you've noticed moses says i am
[47:56] he wasn't saying i am moses i am the god
[48:00] of moses he begins to speak to us what
[48:03] is he doing
[48:04] he's building our faith he's bringing us
[48:06] to a place
[48:07] that we can now face that battle
[48:11] i think oh god episodes he says we come
[48:14] down to our prophet
[48:16] our prophet in this day come into the
[48:18] land come in
[48:20] born under a sign he cut and born under
[48:22] a light in the room
[48:24] vindicating who he was vindication after
[48:26] vindication
[48:27] he went out to the tree and the world
[48:29] went in the tree his life was surrounded
[48:31] by supernatural things why god had a
[48:34] special gift for him
[48:36] he had something for him to do just like
[48:38] john the baptist
[48:40] he had something for him to do
[48:43] wasn't always easy see that problem he
[48:46] lived in
[48:47] america in kentucky
[48:50] in the 50s 40s 60s and we can remember
[48:53] back
[48:54] wait a second brother brenham had faults
[48:56] well yeah
[48:57] moses had false come on come on john the
[49:02] baptist had false
[49:04] noah had false look they all had faults
[49:07] because they was human
[49:09] but yet they all had the ability to get
[49:11] themselves aside
[49:13] and say but god you have prepared this
[49:15] for me
[49:17] you said in your scripture that can come
[49:19] upon me that can overtake me why
[49:21] because you live inside of me you have
[49:24] in your scripture
[49:25] he that began a good work and you shall
[49:28] finish that work you know god if you've
[49:31] brought me out of denomination
[49:32] it brought me from the drug lords it
[49:37] brought me from the prostitute
[49:42] you're still training me
[49:46] and nobody likes training i know
[49:49] you know often i use the boxer mentality
[49:52] one time as
[49:53] as i did some reading some research on
[49:56] different
[49:57] great boxers of their day and you know
[50:00] you take one of these great boxers and
[50:02] and they know that they've got that
[50:03] fight ahead of them
[50:05] you take an evander holyfield you take a
[50:07] mike toss and you take
[50:09] you do you take different ones and then
[50:11] was in my day whatever was in your day
[50:13] they knew they had a fight ahead of them
[50:16] they were so
[50:17] zeroed in on that fight it didn't matter
[50:21] if a bomb dropped beside their car
[50:23] it wasn't going to bother them because
[50:25] they had a mission to accomplish
[50:27] oh god the bride of christ needs a
[50:29] desire like that
[50:30] we need a mission-oriented mind in our
[50:33] heads in a mission-oriented desire in
[50:36] our heart
[50:36] to say god you sent me for a rapture it
[50:39] doesn't matter what happens around me
[50:42] i'm going to that register
[50:45] why because i'm focused on the battle
[50:49] for me
[50:50] i'm focused on what you have for me to
[50:52] do god i'm focused
[50:54] on what you have for me to overcome
[50:57] i'm focused for the victory that you
[50:59] have for me because i know it myself i
[51:02] can't do it but with you
[51:05] all things are possible
[51:09] you think brother branham that she says
[51:11] his first instance is that he talked
[51:13] about
[51:14] going to the baptist meeting and he had
[51:17] his overalls on
[51:19] and they wanted him to get up and speak
[51:23] why because even them could see there's
[51:25] a gift in that little boy
[51:27] there's something shining out of him
[51:30] he's got something to say and oh god
[51:32] he's got a lot to say
[51:34] but what was it he chucked him down he
[51:36] goes down and god begins to preparing
[51:38] god begins to build him up
[51:40] oh yeah during these times he lied oh
[51:42] yeah he tried to cheat
[51:43] oh yeah he tried to kill somebody he
[51:45] tried to do all of this he was human
[51:48] but yet he was still a prophet sent god
[51:51] and god still had something to do for
[51:53] him
[51:55] we bring him along brother brennan would
[51:58] make one comment talking about the ohio
[52:00] river
[52:00] he said it was one of my greatest one of
[52:02] my first greatest meetings
[52:04] he said he's standing down there in that
[52:05] ohio river and he said that cloud opened
[52:08] up and that angel spoke
[52:09] as john the baptist first fought for him
[52:11] brother and the first coming
[52:12] so shall you four around the second
[52:14] running why because he had that battle
[52:17] for
[52:17] him but yet that wasn't all he was to
[52:20] bring
[52:21] a rapturing message to a bride and you
[52:24] know what if we don't do nothing with it
[52:25] now
[52:26] it would be like the hebrew children
[52:27] walking up to the fire and saying no i
[52:29] don't think i want it
[52:31] and walking away come on
[52:35] it would be like david walking down and
[52:38] picking up the stone
[52:38] stepping across the creeks and helping
[52:40] up he's too big for me
[52:42] and walking away it would be about
[52:46] what's trying to do
[52:48] because god knew we was going to face
[52:49] battles god knew we're going to go
[52:52] through things that's bigger than us
[52:54] that's bigger than what we can
[52:55] comprehend it's bigger than what we
[52:57] could understand
[52:58] i preached a funeral yesterday and and i
[53:00] don't know i i didn't even hardly know
[53:02] the man he
[53:03] married my he was my great-aunt's first
[53:06] husband before i was around with the
[53:08] family and they wanted me to
[53:10] so i tried to help him and be with them
[53:12] and when i preach a few
[53:14] i don't put them in heaven or in hell
[53:15] that's their life they do that
[53:17] but i told him i said you know what the
[53:19] only real peace that i have
[53:22] is in him the only way i don't have
[53:25] answers for your question
[53:26] i don't know why that that all of this
[53:29] had to transpire and you had to lose
[53:30] your daddy you had to lose your mama you
[53:32] had to lose your son your daughter
[53:34] whoever it would be
[53:35] but i know it's in the plan of god i
[53:38] know he's in control
[53:40] i know he won't put nothing upon us that
[53:42] we can't handle
[53:45] i believe that our prophet believed
[53:48] and i believe that's what he tried to
[53:50] teach us he tried to plan
[53:52] he tried to get back away he tried to go
[53:54] back to that cave and meet that angel
[53:57] and see what god had to tell you and how
[53:59] he had to try to tell us
[54:00] that there's a battle coming you're not
[54:02] just gonna just walk away like a breezy
[54:05] little happy two-faced kid
[54:06] and just go somewhere it's gonna be a
[54:09] battle
[54:09] you're going to have to stand for what
[54:11] you believe in you're going to have to
[54:12] stand for what
[54:13] put your trust in you're going to have
[54:15] to say god you've prepared me for this
[54:17] battle
[54:18] i'm willing to take whatever comes
[54:22] why because god
[54:25] has planned this battle he's playing
[54:28] this battle for you and uh
[54:30] and sometimes we as humans just like
[54:33] every example that we could use tonight
[54:35] just like every man in the scripture
[54:37] just like every prophet there's ever
[54:39] been
[54:40] what is it just like each and every one
[54:42] of them there was times in their lives
[54:44] that they may have got distracted
[54:49] oh samson did didn't he oh simpson knew
[54:52] what he was doing
[54:54] simpson knew that nazirite val from his
[54:56] birth
[54:57] he knew exactly what god had called him
[55:00] to do
[55:01] he knew that all of his strength was
[55:03] right there got distracted because of a
[55:07] good-looking woman
[55:09] god help us some of us boys we don't get
[55:12] distracted because of a good-looking
[55:13] woman
[55:15] help us to see these are examples for
[55:17] you and i why
[55:18] because the devil is using the same
[55:21] tactics that he's always used
[55:23] to try to bring your attention
[55:26] away from the word of god
[55:29] i believe all of these men went through
[55:31] times of depression i believe all of
[55:33] these men
[55:34] went through times that they doubted who
[55:35] they was remember we're just quoting
[55:38] scripture
[55:39] it's in your bible john the baptist
[55:44] laying in a jail cell begin to doubt
[55:48] is he really the one did i just mess
[55:51] this all up
[55:53] did i prophesy over one that's not even
[55:55] the christ
[55:58] is is he really the one remember that's
[56:00] what your scripture says
[56:03] he calls his own disciples and he says
[56:05] go seed him
[56:07] see if i'm right i'm so discouraged
[56:10] i'm laying here i'm laying here with
[56:12] burden on me i'm laying here
[56:14] in a trial i'm laying here at a depth
[56:17] door
[56:17] and i don't even know if i'm right
[56:19] anymore
[56:21] let's be honest we'll all get there
[56:22] sometimes
[56:24] we all get oh god the devil sneaks in
[56:27] and puts thoughts on our minds
[56:28] do you really believe this message yes
[56:31] devil i really do
[56:35] but let's be honest we have to fight
[56:37] them battles
[56:39] because them thoughts come brother
[56:40] breton says them thoughts will always be
[56:42] there just don't let them build a nest
[56:45] and become part of you what is it you
[56:46] start dwelling on that
[56:48] no wonder people turned from their
[56:49] prophet in their day no wonder people
[56:52] bowed in an image when they knew that
[56:54] wasn't the word of god
[56:55] no wonder people crucified jesus on the
[56:58] cross
[56:58] no wonder they come down their time
[57:00] doing the same thing
[57:02] they allow a thought to build a nest
[57:07] after you think about it some you know
[57:10] you start reasoning a little bit and
[57:13] yeah you know if i just kept that
[57:16] you know if i go get the new testament
[57:19] version
[57:21] the new english standard it don't even
[57:23] have that scripture in there so
[57:24] i'll just ignore that scripture and we
[57:28] start
[57:28] reasoning the word of god right away
[57:30] from us
[57:31] but if you tell that thought it's
[57:33] thought i have no part in you
[57:35] devil get behind me i'm sure as they
[57:38] could they
[57:39] took their hebrew children and they
[57:40] began to walk towards that
[57:42] the human brain in them told them that
[57:45] fire was hot
[57:47] that they didn't walk into it not
[57:49] knowing what they was walking into
[57:51] they had seen fire consume things they
[57:53] had seen fire
[57:54] burn people they had seen what that
[57:57] blaze could do
[57:58] and then the king just ordered it seven
[58:00] times hotter
[58:01] it's going to be hot
[58:05] they said oh king we're not careful to
[58:07] answer thee
[58:09] our god can deliver us but even if he
[58:13] don't we're going to serve him anyway
[58:16] little bride even if god don't take me
[58:19] in a rapture i'm going to serve him
[58:21] anyway
[58:22] even if god gave me everything that i
[58:25] that i want
[58:26] because that's a problem i want i'm
[58:28] going to serve him anyway
[58:30] even if i don't have the finest house
[58:32] even if i don't have the finest car
[58:34] even if i don't have the finest suit i'm
[58:36] going to serve him anyway
[58:38] because he chose me to worship him he
[58:41] chose me to serve him
[58:44] he chose me for this battle
[58:48] he chose you for this battle
[58:52] and look god don't lose y'all let's be
[58:55] real plain he don't lose
[58:58] yeah i mean you think trump's a sore
[58:59] loser you ain't met god yet
[59:02] he don't know what losing is when he
[59:06] sets out to do something he's going to
[59:07] do it
[59:09] when he tells the devil you know what
[59:10] devil i'm going to let you kill my son
[59:13] but i'm going to use his blood to redeem
[59:15] the earth he's going to do it
[59:18] why because he's god and he never loses
[59:20] a battle
[59:21] he never loses a fight he's always the
[59:24] forefront
[59:24] of everything that we have made of he's
[59:27] looking at you and i tonight
[59:29] and he's saying oh you're everything you
[59:31] know you don't want let's just throw
[59:33] this in here for the fun of it
[59:36] covert ain't nothing but a bunch of fear
[59:39] i didn't say it wasn't real
[59:41] i didn't say it wasn't a sickness but
[59:43] it's trying to
[59:44] attack your minds to get you so scared
[59:48] that you won't even serve god that you
[59:51] put
[59:51] that above reading your bible you put
[59:53] turning the news on above
[59:55] praying to god you put listening to what
[59:57] politics is doing
[59:58] above what's happening right before your
[1:00:00] eyes
[1:00:02] it's nothing but a fear tactic before
[1:00:04] god
[1:00:06] oh my gosh ahead of myself
[1:00:11] oh my let's just give them down you love
[1:00:14] him tonight
[1:00:16] brother brought him in the message
[1:00:17] influence he says now i wonder
[1:00:20] if it would take the same influence on
[1:00:23] us this afternoon
[1:00:25] he said if we'd seen what he promised to
[1:00:27] do in the last days fulfilled
[1:00:29] what kind of influence would he give us
[1:00:31] what
[1:00:33] he said all we have done in these last
[1:00:35] days ought to put us in action
[1:00:37] it sure ought to with reverence and
[1:00:40] humility he said now notice
[1:00:42] he said the pillar of fire should put us
[1:00:44] in action as the pillar of our
[1:00:45] vindicates
[1:00:46] its promise in the last days but what's
[1:00:49] happening
[1:00:50] we're turning our eyes from the word
[1:00:52] we're turning our eyes for the message
[1:00:54] we're turning our eyes from our pastor
[1:00:56] we're turning our eyes from our brothers
[1:00:58] and our sisters we're turning our eyes
[1:01:00] from church
[1:01:01] and we're focusing so much on the news
[1:01:04] we don't see the pillar of fire anymore
[1:01:07] why because the pillar of fire ain't on
[1:01:09] seeing in a fox
[1:01:11] it ain't on capitol hill it's
[1:01:12] inaugurated president
[1:01:15] it ain't in the doctor's office as they
[1:01:17] as they're treating kobe think
[1:01:19] that they're trying to do the best they
[1:01:21] can
[1:01:23] but that's not where the pillar of fire
[1:01:25] is the pillar of fire is in his word
[1:01:28] his filler fire is in his people it's
[1:01:31] sitting there
[1:01:32] saying this battle you shall overcome
[1:01:34] too
[1:01:35] this battle you will be victorious i
[1:01:38] know what's before you
[1:01:39] i know what's coming i prepared a way
[1:01:43] of escape for you
[1:01:47] notice the pillow fire should put us in
[1:01:49] action as the pillar of fire vindicates
[1:01:51] its promise of these last days
[1:01:53] jesus says i come from god and i go to
[1:01:56] god and he said what he would do in
[1:01:58] these last days
[1:01:59] see what is it he's told us everything
[1:02:02] that will transpire
[1:02:04] you know we could be here all night and
[1:02:06] i could scroll down here and i got
[1:02:07] another study in here
[1:02:09] of prophecy for the last days and we
[1:02:11] could go down and we could see
[1:02:12] all the abomination of god we could see
[1:02:15] how the world
[1:02:16] has turned against god we could see how
[1:02:18] government has turned against god
[1:02:20] you can see how this nation turned down
[1:02:22] god back in the 50s
[1:02:24] and they've never been the same since
[1:02:27] and it was all prophesied to us it was
[1:02:30] all
[1:02:30] owed to us by god through a prophet in
[1:02:33] this day
[1:02:34] to let us know don't be dismayed when
[1:02:36] these things happen
[1:02:39] well but i thought that's the problem
[1:02:41] you thought
[1:02:43] see my problem is i thought it's like i
[1:02:45] was sharing with brother david back
[1:02:47] there i've got a couple opinions and a
[1:02:49] couple thoughts
[1:02:50] about what's trend iron but i don't have
[1:02:53] to set the lord on it so i'm not
[1:02:54] speaking it
[1:02:56] as a friend we can talk about it it's
[1:02:58] for me
[1:03:00] but when i come up and minister the word
[1:03:02] of god i don't try to put quotes
[1:03:03] together
[1:03:05] and try to make things appear that
[1:03:07] that's what it is god don't need me to
[1:03:09] fulfill his prophecy
[1:03:10] he just needs me to believe what he said
[1:03:13] he just needs me to go back
[1:03:15] and say god you said through your
[1:03:17] prophet this day would come
[1:03:18] i see it transpiring
[1:03:24] prophecy in the days of daniel of
[1:03:27] handwriting on the wall
[1:03:29] oh a bunch of foolishness there ain't no
[1:03:31] way a hand can appear
[1:03:33] and ride on a wall but then it began to
[1:03:36] happen
[1:03:38] and you know even though it was
[1:03:39] happening if we if we just think on a
[1:03:41] human scale
[1:03:42] even though in that day there was many
[1:03:45] people sitting in the room
[1:03:48] and that hand appeared and began to ride
[1:03:50] on the wall
[1:03:51] there were still those that didn't think
[1:03:53] it was happening sitting right there
[1:03:55] watching it
[1:03:56] oh god help us we got so-called message
[1:04:00] believers
[1:04:02] watching the signs of the time happen
[1:04:05] right before our eyes
[1:04:07] and they're going oh i don't know if i
[1:04:10] believe this or
[1:04:11] not well the problem is you ain't seeing
[1:04:14] the pillar of fire
[1:04:16] because the fire is moving in the
[1:04:18] government it's showing the government
[1:04:20] what he needs them to set up so that he
[1:04:22] can get us out of here
[1:04:24] he's in control oh he said they should
[1:04:26] influence us put us in action
[1:04:28] he said signs of the coming is at hand
[1:04:30] jesus says as it was in sodom just
[1:04:33] before the world was burned the gentile
[1:04:34] world the world would
[1:04:35] turn it should influence us and put us
[1:04:38] in action too
[1:04:40] when we see the word fulfilled that he
[1:04:42] promised it should put us in action
[1:04:45] he should put us in action yeah it
[1:04:47] should make us live better than we've
[1:04:49] ever lived
[1:04:50] it should make us pray more than we've
[1:04:52] ever prayed
[1:04:53] it should make us read our bibles more
[1:04:55] than we've ever read our bible
[1:04:57] it should make us listen to more tapes
[1:04:59] than we've ever listened to
[1:05:01] it should give us a desire to be in
[1:05:03] church more than we've ever been in
[1:05:05] church
[1:05:06] why because there's something on the
[1:05:08] inside that's crying out for the seed of
[1:05:11] god
[1:05:11] it's crying out for that reverence
[1:05:14] that's crying out for that presence
[1:05:16] they can only be felt in the pillar of
[1:05:19] fire
[1:05:21] and you know what no wonder brother
[1:05:23] branham said when it comes to the
[1:05:24] rapture
[1:05:25] when it comes to this last day no wonder
[1:05:28] he says
[1:05:28] it'll take the people to get desperate
[1:05:33] it take us to get desperate
[1:05:37] god help us if not everything's
[1:05:39] happening
[1:05:40] it's turning the true bride back to god
[1:05:45] it's turning the true by deeper to the
[1:05:47] word than she's ever been
[1:05:49] it's turning the true by deeper to
[1:05:51] revelation than she's ever been
[1:05:53] why because our eyes are open to the
[1:05:55] fact that signs of the time are amongst
[1:05:57] us
[1:05:58] the handwriting is on the wall this is
[1:06:01] the time for rapture
[1:06:03] god has pre-planned this whole battle he
[1:06:06] has set it all into play
[1:06:07] and he's prepared us for this battle
[1:06:12] i just don't know how i'm going to do it
[1:06:14] you're not going to do it
[1:06:17] you're going to find a little prayer
[1:06:18] closet somewhere
[1:06:20] when you realize like i said to my woman
[1:06:22] in memphis she done prayed all she could
[1:06:24] pray
[1:06:25] she done did everything for that boy
[1:06:27] that she'd do
[1:06:28] and she realized god where's your lodge
[1:06:31] yet
[1:06:32] because i need you elijah and he shook
[1:06:35] the very foundations of heaven and god
[1:06:38] had to stop a plane in midair
[1:06:40] and send us elijah straight to her
[1:06:42] doorstep
[1:06:43] why because that's what our prayers do
[1:06:47] it'll drive us in desperation until we
[1:06:49] find that prayer closet in our life
[1:06:51] that we get down before god and say god
[1:06:54] i don't know why
[1:06:55] but in my mind i fear this sickness in
[1:06:58] my mind
[1:06:59] i fear this presidency in my mind i fear
[1:07:02] what the government's gonna do
[1:07:03] god i need your elijah in my day
[1:07:07] he sends his holy spirit right into your
[1:07:10] root you begin to feel peace come over
[1:07:11] your body
[1:07:12] why because he's prepared you for this
[1:07:15] day he says if you have not
[1:07:17] because you asked not i asked in prayer
[1:07:20] god
[1:07:22] oh i asked in prayer philippians 4 13 i
[1:07:25] can do all things through christ
[1:07:29] that strengthens me amen i was looking
[1:07:33] for one more
[1:07:34] mark 16 and he said unto them go into
[1:07:38] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:07:39] every creature
[1:07:42] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:07:44] be saved but he that believeth
[1:07:46] not shall be damned and these signs
[1:07:49] shall follow them that they believe
[1:07:51] in my name they shall cast out endeavors
[1:07:55] that's what you can do it doesn't take a
[1:07:58] minister to cast a devil out
[1:08:00] it takes a born again filled with the
[1:08:02] holy ghost son or daughter of god
[1:08:04] that knows who they are knows where they
[1:08:06] stand and knows their god is real
[1:08:09] and knows that no matter that fire is
[1:08:11] seven times the heat
[1:08:12] i have the ability inside of me to
[1:08:15] overcome that flaming fire
[1:08:17] why because my god resides in me
[1:08:20] and when i face that demon when i face
[1:08:23] that devil before me
[1:08:24] and my flesh i make fear in my flesh i
[1:08:27] may know not what to do
[1:08:29] but that inside man of me is going to
[1:08:31] rise up
[1:08:32] and it's going to speak for me and say
[1:08:34] devil get behind me
[1:08:36] because i'm not scared of your tactics
[1:08:39] because i
[1:08:40] have him on the inside they should take
[1:08:44] up servants
[1:08:45] if they drank any deadly thing it shall
[1:08:47] not harm them
[1:08:48] they shall lay hands on their sick and
[1:08:50] they shall recover
[1:08:52] you know i heard brother brennaman this
[1:08:54] just come to my mind i'll just share it
[1:08:55] with you
[1:08:56] listen i think it's three believers i'm
[1:08:58] not sure list 63 three kinds of
[1:09:00] believers or go
[1:09:01] go wake jesus one and brother branham
[1:09:04] begins the sermon
[1:09:06] by saying i've tried and i have failed
[1:09:11] to teach you that you don't have to come
[1:09:14] up here
[1:09:15] and me lay my hands on you for you to be
[1:09:17] healed
[1:09:19] said healing isn't the word
[1:09:23] look look you know and then he said and
[1:09:25] i agree with him
[1:09:26] now we do these things because scripture
[1:09:29] says lay hands upon them
[1:09:31] and they shall be healed he said but he
[1:09:33] don't take that
[1:09:34] what is he trying to tell us he's trying
[1:09:37] to build us up he's trying to prep us
[1:09:39] to know that one day we're going to be
[1:09:41] all alone driving down the road in our
[1:09:42] car
[1:09:43] and we ain't going to know what to do
[1:09:45] we're going to be so stressed out and
[1:09:46] we're going to be so mentally drained
[1:09:48] but yet he's going to tell us what can
[1:09:50] you do i can call on the name of jesus
[1:09:53] i can say jesus come right with me a
[1:09:56] while
[1:09:56] jesus come give me peace like you've not
[1:09:59] given before
[1:10:02] i don't have to run through enough
[1:10:04] physical alter
[1:10:05] i don't have to run and get a minister
[1:10:07] lay their hands on me
[1:10:08] i don't have to do this what can i do i
[1:10:11] can find someone that's got faith that
[1:10:12] agrees with me
[1:10:13] i can find that faith on the inside of
[1:10:16] me and say
[1:10:17] i believe thy word i believe your
[1:10:19] stripes was for my healing
[1:10:21] i can be healed sitting right here
[1:10:24] why because my faith
[1:10:27] is in his word
[1:10:31] oh my is it us now
[1:10:36] we look through god's great battle plan
[1:10:39] and we find down through the ages he had
[1:10:43] a plan for
[1:10:44] every battle and he overcome
[1:10:48] every enemy you say but they hung him on
[1:10:51] a cross
[1:10:52] he had a plan for that he rose him in
[1:10:55] three days
[1:10:57] and he sent him to hell and he stripped
[1:10:59] the devil of all of his power
[1:11:01] why because he had a plan for that he
[1:11:04] said but you don't know my life
[1:11:05] you don't know the situation that i'm in
[1:11:08] you don't know the sickness that is upon
[1:11:10] my family you don't know
[1:11:11] you don't know what the government is
[1:11:13] saying to me you don't know what my work
[1:11:15] is do to me no
[1:11:16] but god does know and he knew before the
[1:11:19] foundation of the world and he's got his
[1:11:21] pillar of fire he's got the holy spirit
[1:11:24] for you
[1:11:26] and he said just ask
[1:11:29] i'm holding the angels back i'm standing
[1:11:32] up here because i'm a gentleman
[1:11:34] and i've got all of the angels behind
[1:11:36] the arms
[1:11:38] children if you would just ask for it i
[1:11:41] would release the angels upon you
[1:11:43] they would minister to you healing they
[1:11:45] would minister to you faith
[1:11:46] they would minister to you peace they
[1:11:48] would minister to you joy
[1:11:52] well let's just be honest and i probably
[1:11:53] need to close
[1:11:55] let's just be honest in the day that
[1:11:59] we're living in it's hard to find happy
[1:12:00] people
[1:12:04] man you you find somebody happy and you
[1:12:05] just won't hang around no more
[1:12:08] look i mean speaking of me i don't like
[1:12:10] to hang around people that's always
[1:12:12] complaining
[1:12:14] all the government's going to do this
[1:12:15] they're going to take my guns they'll
[1:12:17] they're going to do this they're going
[1:12:18] to close the church doors no no i want
[1:12:20] to get around people said
[1:12:22] you don't want my for my yesterday i
[1:12:24] didn't know what to do he told me which
[1:12:26] way to turn
[1:12:27] you know i didn't know how to pay the
[1:12:28] light bill but you know what god sent
[1:12:30] somebody by and gave me what i needed to
[1:12:32] pay the light bill
[1:12:33] i want to be around people like that i
[1:12:36] want to be around people like this
[1:12:37] i thought i was a backslider i thought i
[1:12:39] was going to hell
[1:12:40] but god come into my life and showed me
[1:12:43] i
[1:12:44] am a son or daughter of god that's what
[1:12:46] god done for me
[1:12:49] i want to be around people like that
[1:12:53] i want to strive to be the best
[1:12:57] christian i can be
[1:12:58] i want us to drive to be the best
[1:13:01] example i can be
[1:13:03] i want to strive to holler out to a
[1:13:05] bride and i don't mean to scream it's
[1:13:06] just my nature i just holler and
[1:13:08] carry on like a fool i guess but the
[1:13:11] scripture does say it by the foolish of
[1:13:13] preaching
[1:13:16] but it excites me to see
[1:13:21] oh if i could have a vision like a
[1:13:24] prophet and i could
[1:13:25] slide up and i could look down upon the
[1:13:27] earth
[1:13:28] and i could begin to see maybe as god is
[1:13:31] sitting up there and he's orchestrated
[1:13:33] this whole battle plan
[1:13:35] he's been all in the play he knows what
[1:13:38] tomorrow it's
[1:13:40] i don't but he does that's why i don't
[1:13:43] fear it
[1:13:44] that's why i sing that song i don't fear
[1:13:47] what tomorrow holds
[1:13:49] because i know who it says
[1:13:52] he's sitting up there in his heaven
[1:13:54] sitting on his throne
[1:13:56] and he says yeah i've about got that
[1:13:59] bride where i want her
[1:14:01] i've got this from me
[1:14:04] i've about got her to the place that she
[1:14:06] realizes
[1:14:08] i'm the only one she has need of
[1:14:12] oh and i can see happiness come across
[1:14:15] his face
[1:14:16] he said oh god he said oh i've waited
[1:14:19] for this for so long
[1:14:21] before the foundation of the world i
[1:14:24] knew this
[1:14:26] they would come i knew 2021 would come
[1:14:29] i knew people would be so scared and
[1:14:32] people would be crazy and olympics and
[1:14:34] corruption
[1:14:35] it would just be falling apart but i
[1:14:37] knew also
[1:14:38] that there was a bride called to fight
[1:14:40] that battle
[1:14:41] and i knew that when these things would
[1:14:43] happen she would see the handwriting on
[1:14:45] the wall
[1:14:46] she would see the signs of the time and
[1:14:48] she would say god
[1:14:50] even so come
[1:14:54] quickly even so
[1:14:58] come quickly
[1:15:02] oh god brad
[1:15:05] it's your battle now
[1:15:10] oh i could see maybe days or weeks
[1:15:15] before daniel knew as a prophet what the
[1:15:18] three of her children would go through
[1:15:21] i could see daniel bring him in under
[1:15:23] his arms
[1:15:24] and begin to pray for him
[1:15:28] oh you believe that yeah kind of the
[1:15:30] same way jesus did
[1:15:32] before his crucifixion and he looked at
[1:15:35] peter and he says peter do you love me
[1:15:38] peter do you love me
[1:15:42] what was he doing he was giving him a
[1:15:44] way out
[1:15:46] he knew that peter would deny
[1:15:49] daniel knew this trial was going to be
[1:15:51] hard
[1:15:52] but he also knew the god they served
[1:15:56] and he prepared him for this battle
[1:15:58] little bride
[1:16:00] we could open our eyes tonight and see
[1:16:03] all of heaven has prepared us for this
[1:16:05] battle
[1:16:06] i'm not talking about a physical battle
[1:16:08] i'm not a i'm not a
[1:16:09] terrorist crazy new dick that wants to
[1:16:11] go storm the capitol
[1:16:14] i want to go storm heaven's gates it's
[1:16:16] what i want to go storm
[1:16:18] i want to leave this old flesh body
[1:16:19] behind i want the real me to escape out
[1:16:24] i want the real me to look around and
[1:16:26] see my loved ones that have died and
[1:16:27] going on
[1:16:28] start appearing before me and my mind
[1:16:30] knows that the scripture says the dead
[1:16:32] in christ your eyes first
[1:16:34] it's time to go home
[1:16:38] i want to stand and say even so lord
[1:16:43] you've chose me for this battle no
[1:16:45] matter how hard it is no matter how hot
[1:16:48] them blazes are
[1:16:50] no matter how strong them temptations
[1:16:53] are
[1:16:53] no matter how strong them influences are
[1:16:56] in my life
[1:16:57] i want to stand for you
[1:17:01] why because you called me
[1:17:04] for this battle the man musicians would
[1:17:07] come
[1:17:09] it's wednesday night i'll go on and on
[1:17:11] and on
[1:17:13] why brother brandon says if that bride
[1:17:15] ever recognizes who she is
[1:17:17] she'll become an invincible army
[1:17:21] amen against the devil and all of his
[1:17:24] tactics
[1:17:25] why because he's already saw that
[1:17:29] do you realize how exciting hey look
[1:17:32] some of you
[1:17:33] some of you some of you may be football
[1:17:35] fans okay we got what three weeks four
[1:17:37] weeks whatever it is to the super bowl
[1:17:39] we're down to four teams we have a super
[1:17:41] bowl would
[1:17:42] be nice if you already knew who was
[1:17:44] going to win
[1:17:46] before the game even played but see
[1:17:49] that's how my god is
[1:17:51] he knows that you're going to win he
[1:17:54] has already seen he's already predicted
[1:17:56] it he's already prophesied it
[1:17:58] he's already called it to be his bride
[1:18:00] he's going to win
[1:18:02] she's going to overcome she's going to
[1:18:05] overcome the demonic tactic
[1:18:07] she's going in a rapture she's going to
[1:18:10] be the one that he's called her to be
[1:18:12] and now it's up to you and i to open our
[1:18:14] eyes and say
[1:18:15] oh god that me
[1:18:19] amen amen you've got us all we're seeing
[1:18:22] stand with us you believe that tonight
[1:18:25] but branham says
[1:18:26] that angel come to and says you speak it
[1:18:28] and i'll perform it
[1:18:30] amen amen
