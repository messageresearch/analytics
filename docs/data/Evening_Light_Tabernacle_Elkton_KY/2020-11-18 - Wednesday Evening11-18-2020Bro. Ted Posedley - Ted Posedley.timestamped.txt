[29:27] man i thought it was real good i enjoyed
[29:29] doing songs and so
[29:31] amen we want to introduce brother ted
[29:33] and i was
[29:34] back there thinking of amen brother ted
[29:36] and you know the
[29:39] amen and the things that he's done for
[29:41] the lord you know we could probably
[29:42] stand here and
[29:43] amen and we really couldn't justly
[29:47] mention or even say a lot of the things
[29:49] that he's done but i know he's been
[29:51] very instrumental in going all over the
[29:53] world amen in his lifetime
[29:55] probably preaching twice as many times
[29:57] as i've ever thought of preaching so
[30:00] and so we only have brother ted once a
[30:02] year so how many will save her tonight
[30:03] amen
[30:04] amen i'm going to enjoy it how about you
[30:07] so it's a real privilege to have brother
[30:08] ted with us we appreciate his friendship
[30:10] and
[30:11] amen appreciate the work that he's doing
[30:13] out there in arizona
[30:14] you give him a little church out there
[30:16] and wonderful beautiful
[30:18] group of people out there and so we just
[30:20] really great
[30:21] greatly appreciate our brother amen amen
[30:24] and for all that he's done
[30:25] he's certainly a veteran amen in the
[30:28] message
[30:30] one of those has carried this gospel for
[30:32] many many years
[30:34] spent most probably all of his life just
[30:36] really laboring in the gospel so
[30:38] i think he needs a lot of credit don't
[30:40] you amen and so we just
[30:42] want to say that we love him and
[30:43] appreciate him and want him to welcome
[30:46] to the pulpit tonight amen and take his
[30:48] time and just have
[30:49] to take his liberty amen we sure love

[36:43] we
[36:43] getting weary in the journey as we're
[36:45] seeing so much darkness lord that's
[36:49] uh turning us into uh just causing us to
[36:52] feel depressed and sad but lord

[36:58] ask you for thy glory in the name of the
[36:59] lord jesus christ
[37:00] amen god bless you take your seats
[37:03] happy to reach you from sister myrna she
[37:07] couldn't accompany me but
[37:08] she's here with me right now i can hear
[37:10] her voice almost
[37:12] all the time i hear everywhere i go i
[37:14] hear
[37:16] and uh honey i didn't know you were and
[37:18] it wasn't but
[37:19] yet she's my conscience and uh
[37:22] i did miss her too so i know you would
[37:24] have loved to see her but
[37:25] uh there's coming a day when she'll fly
[37:28] over here without an airplane so
[37:31] and so thank god for that and uh
[37:34] the miles don't get shorter you know if
[37:35] they would just take texas out of the
[37:37] middle of the u.s
[37:39] it wouldn't be so far between us and you
[37:41] right
[37:43] i think we were an hour and a half
[37:44] flying over texas it was beautiful
[37:46] it was beautiful and good things do come
[37:48] from texas by the way
[37:50] thank god god's so good to us but not
[37:52] all the good things come from texas
[37:55] amen some come out of nazareth
[37:58] amen oh you thank the lord you know god
[38:02] is so great in this hour and message is
[38:05] just increasing all over the earth you
[38:06] know even this
[38:07] coved you know this was satan's ploy you
[38:10] know with his corona
[38:12] you know satan trying to make a crown
[38:14] you know corona means crown and
[38:16] and uh and that's what this virus was
[38:19] described as and so
[38:21] it had all these points on it like this
[38:23] but see it's all a lie from satan it's
[38:25] all a lie from satan because he's never
[38:27] he got no crown at all he's trying to
[38:29] steal your crown
[38:31] you're the one that gets the crown
[38:33] because jesus won it for you amen how
[38:35] many believe that
[38:36] so it's all it's all satan's agenda to
[38:39] try to
[38:40] uh manipulate our minds and if you're
[38:42] like me
[38:43] you're still human anybody isn't
[38:46] uh can't help you tonight
[38:50] but if you are we we get we get dragged
[38:53] down real easy by looking around seeing
[38:54] all the darkness and the stuff that's
[38:56] going on we
[38:57] we it's almost like we're i don't know
[39:00] brother uh
[39:01] brian there and different ones in the
[39:02] military uh
[39:04] they get this ptsd i never was in the
[39:06] military but feeling like i'm getting
[39:08] ptsd
[39:08] almost every other day now with all the
[39:11] stress
[39:12] that we're under and don't even realize
[39:14] it but it takes a toll it traumatizes
[39:16] you
[39:17] and it draws some virtue out of you amen
[39:20] so that's why we gather together amen
[39:23] that's why he said if two or three
[39:24] three of you will get together uh then
[39:27] i'll come in there and i'll give you
[39:28] some
[39:28] for this message which is our is the
[39:31] light of the hour
[39:32] and brother man said we the believers
[39:34] our message he said is the light of the
[39:36] day
[39:37] we are the light of the day amen
[39:40] so it's god in human flesh it's not god
[39:42] in heaven anymore it's not god
[39:44] or although that prophet still speaks to
[39:46] us every day
[39:48] all right he speaks to me identity this
[39:49] is our name being called this is the
[39:51] opening up of the book
[39:53] this is god telling us who we are amen
[39:56] and we're not defeated amen we're not
[39:58] losers we're not
[40:00] we're not we're not gonna uh we're not
[40:02] there's no end
[40:03] for us we're gonna just keep on going
[40:05] keep on going
[40:06] this is the only end is for this outer
[40:08] hit thing here
[40:10] and this is my enemy this how many
[40:13] got one of these outer things here um
[40:16] this
[40:16] is our problem this is our enemy but our
[40:18] victory
[40:19] is that light that has come down inside
[40:22] of this body amen not only would you
[40:24] identify that and say that believe that
[40:27] when god brought you into this message
[40:29] light came into your life amen you were
[40:31] walking in darkness how many knows we
[40:33] were born in sin
[40:34] shaping the nick when you all come to
[40:35] the world speaking lies and that was
[40:37] darkness upon us not even our thinking
[40:39] was blind we couldn't see
[40:41] we couldn't understand we couldn't
[40:44] comprehend we just thought well just you
[40:46] know
[40:47] money and trucks and houses and stuff
[40:49] and we still like those things but
[40:51] there's more to it than that now it's
[40:53] something that
[40:54] has drawn us and attached us to a place
[40:57] where there is no darkness amen
[40:59] blessed be the name of the lord we thank
[41:01] god for that so we're talking about
[41:05] a darkness that's covered coming and a
[41:07] squeeze i i was going to talk about the
[41:08] three exoduses
[41:10] the three surrenders and the three
[41:13] squeezes but i'm not going to talk about
[41:14] that tonight because i couldn't fit that
[41:16] i couldn't squeeze that in
[41:17] i don't know what to say amen but the
[41:20] squeeze we talk about the thing going on
[41:22] in the government and stuff and
[41:24] all of that and it looks like it's just
[41:26] i tell the people all the time there's
[41:27] covidon this stuff's going on this
[41:29] election
[41:30] it's not the squeeze but it's getting us
[41:32] ready for the swedes
[41:34] i mean it's a preliminary what's going
[41:35] on and just to push us
[41:37] down or to try to close us down amen
[41:40] and you know brother ben said they they
[41:42] won't close us up god will take us up
[41:45] and so we're if we're going to talk
[41:47] about those things we have to talk about
[41:49] the message and the message
[41:51] is god amen it's like the bible is god
[41:54] if how many have a bible hold your bible
[41:56] i didn't bring mine but i've got my
[41:57] tablet
[41:58] and i got the word of god on my tablet
[42:00] so i'll hold it up
[42:01] this is actually god you're holding in
[42:03] your hand amen
[42:04] but now when you read that when you hear
[42:06] it preaching when something in you says
[42:08] wow that touched my
[42:11] my heart light came into you right then
[42:14] amen
[42:15] you didn't see it i didn't see it we
[42:16] don't have to go around you know taking
[42:18] pictures of
[42:18] pillars of fireballs of fire to know
[42:21] that we
[42:23] have the pillar of fire inside of us
[42:25] today
[42:26] amen now somebody else might never see
[42:29] it but god sees it god knows it's there
[42:31] and you know it's there
[42:32] and you believe it's there amen and
[42:35] that's what that's what exposes the
[42:37] devil whenever he comes to try to
[42:39] rob you how many knows the devil's a
[42:41] preacher how many knows
[42:43] he's a some people say he's a good
[42:45] preacher uh
[42:47] i say he mean he may be qualified as
[42:48] well as a good speaker
[42:50] but he can't be called a good preacher
[42:52] because he's not preaching the truth
[42:54] only a good preacher isn't maybe so
[42:56] qualified as a speaker
[42:58] but he's a good preacher is a is
[43:00] preaching the truth when he does speak
[43:03] amen just like brother man said the
[43:05] early apostles they said they weren't
[43:07] eloquent preachers they were very simple
[43:10] said they were men a few words
[43:12] but boy get them in the pulpit he said
[43:14] just after five ten minutes
[43:16] the presence of god come in the room so
[43:18] what it is is what god is doing is a
[43:21] supernatural
[43:22] light has come in
[43:28] our life today um brother brown said
[43:31] here an uncertain sound he said when we
[43:32] were made
[43:34] and when we were made they found out
[43:35] that your body is full of light
[43:39] they found that out x-ray proves that
[43:41] anybody ever had an x-ray
[43:44] do they see anything yes well how could
[43:47] they see anything
[43:48] because the x-ray doesn't have a light
[43:50] of its own it's taking picture of the
[43:52] light that's inside of you
[43:54] so they prove that proves that um
[43:57] that you have light inside your body
[44:00] right
[44:02] and so this isn't the message on certain
[44:03] sound 1960 the x-ray does not have any
[44:05] light of its own i'm just
[44:06] reading what the prophet said and he
[44:09] says
[44:10] uh it's your light that it uses
[44:13] so i just said that but now i'm reading
[44:15] it directly like he said it
[44:17] all you go back the tapes see anything
[44:19] you hear quotes and stuff
[44:21] and over my
[44:25] i guess i've reached the status of being
[44:27] a veteran according to brother byler so
[44:29] god bless you
[44:30] but over these years and travels 87
[44:33] overseas trips and just going around and
[44:36] by the help of the lord and
[44:37] this whole year has been totally i don't
[44:39] know what i haven't met this is my first
[44:41] time i've
[44:42] gotten on an airplane in a year and
[44:45] and it's just uh really really been hard
[44:48] for me
[44:49] and uh sister myrna now even our son and
[44:52] different ones are saying
[44:53] we're getting used to you just hanging
[44:54] around
[44:56] but you know this this this something
[45:00] that's inside of me doesn't like to just
[45:01] sit around
[45:03] because there's more souls to reach out
[45:05] there there's people hungry there's
[45:07] people calling so
[45:08] as soon as the doors open i'ma fly and
[45:10] go
[45:11] uh we we was recently
[45:14] called the dedicated church over in togo
[45:17] and the brother visited
[45:18] another church that where we preached
[45:20] here about four years ago
[45:22] and that brother we walked in there and
[45:25] as we walked in there
[45:26] oh there were four of us preachers and
[45:28] we walked in there
[45:30] and the people in the village you didn't
[45:32] know it but they were demon worshippers
[45:33] and they were which they had a witch uh
[45:35] a warlock kind of a
[45:37] leader of a man and a wit will woman as
[45:39] well
[45:40] leading them and they were scaring
[45:41] everybody with their lies
[45:44] yo brother uh we might not have uh uh
[45:47] uh uh that kind of
[45:50] the darkness black magic and stuff like
[45:53] that here but we've got
[45:54] politics we got false preaching
[45:58] false preaching we got churchianity we
[46:01] got all this stuff trying to put spells
[46:03] on people
[46:04] we thought we got people telling us that
[46:06] we're deceived that we're
[46:08] crazy brother bram said if i'm crazy
[46:12] leave me alone because first of all
[46:15] that tells me if you're gonna leave him
[46:16] alone that means you can't help him
[46:18] you ain't gonna change him right he
[46:21] leave me alone but he said
[46:22] and another thing is i'm happier this
[46:24] way and i'll do what that was when i had
[46:25] my right mind
[46:27] amen so blessed be the name of the lord
[46:30] if this being crazy paul said in a way
[46:32] that's crazy that's the way i'm going to
[46:34] serve god
[46:35] you know i was going to preach a little
[46:36] sermon called crazy in love
[46:40] that would have been a good one for
[46:41] tonight but i just
[46:43] i just thought it through and i thought
[46:44] you know i don't know i don't know and i
[46:46] seem
[46:47] kind of strange but brother uh if you if
[46:50] you were
[46:51] sitting on the back seat of this in this
[46:52] middle row say of the
[46:54] evening like tabernacle here in elkton
[46:56] kentucky uh
[46:58] uh tonight uh we could maybe that would
[47:00] apply to you that terminology
[47:01] you're crazy in love amen that was you
[47:04] say well i was one time but say what's
[47:06] the matter with the other people been
[47:08] married for 20 years
[47:09] it just gets better and better amen i
[47:12] mean you're still crazy
[47:14] you're still crazy because no matter
[47:16] what they do and how they do
[47:17] how my wife loves me so much no matter
[47:20] how i've disappointed her
[47:22] she's still crazy she lost it she has
[47:24] totally lost it that's what i was going
[47:26] to preach on how simple it is
[47:27] but then you apply that to loving each
[47:29] other maybe i'm going to change my
[47:31] sermon
[47:32] but you know loving each other you got
[47:34] to be crazy to love some of you guys
[47:36] you got gotta be crazy for you to love
[47:38] me it's gotta be like it's totally in
[47:40] ins it makes no sense because we don't
[47:43] make sense
[47:44] one day we're this way one day we're
[47:45] that way one day we're like this one day
[47:47] we're there do that
[47:49] we are so we are so confusing
[47:52] of people do you know what god's people
[47:56] are impossible for anybody to love
[47:59] except god
[48:01] and god's people so don't expect
[48:04] everybody to love you because
[48:06] they for one thing you're crazy to them
[48:08] amen
[48:09] but thank god i'm crazy and loved and
[48:10] i'm crazy i'm crazy for the gospel i'm
[48:13] crazy to tell another soul somewhere
[48:16] amen leave me alone you can't change me
[48:19] amen
[48:20] and i'm happier now uh it's kind of nice
[48:23] to have
[48:24] to have lost your mind and have gained
[48:27] the mind of christ
[48:29] and you know let's see oh so a lot of
[48:31] people don't know they want they want
[48:33] their sound mind you on their sound mind
[48:34] thinks oh yeah
[48:36] oh yeah got to do what they say you got
[48:38] to do what they say you got to do what
[48:39] they say
[48:40] they'll do what they say do you know
[48:41] that this nation was born on civil
[48:43] disobedience
[48:45] i'll tell you what they don't know
[48:46] brother ben said they're going to close
[48:48] our churches down you know that
[48:49] that squeeze comes down it's going to
[48:51] come down on us he said they're going to
[48:52] close our churches down churches like
[48:54] this one
[48:56] you know i always tell the people i said
[48:57] look if when that freeze comes down and
[49:00] your church don't get close you ain't a
[49:01] church like his church
[49:03] i want to be one of these churches amen
[49:05] one of these message churches
[49:07] not only that i want to be one of the
[49:08] message people i want to be one of those
[49:10] message pastors preachers amen
[49:13] i want to be a message husband how about
[49:15] you man you want to be a message husband
[49:18] then you've got to reject all the
[49:20] darkness reject all the lie
[49:22] reject all the hype reject all the fear
[49:25] reject all of satan's lie amen
[49:28] and cling to the truth and love god with
[49:32] all your heart soul mind and strength
[49:34] be crazy in love see i'd be none if that
[49:38] was my sermon for tonight it would be
[49:40] finished
[49:41] but we're going to talk about what makes
[49:43] us crazy
[49:46] is light has come to us now watch when
[49:49] we were born brother brown said you
[49:51] you were born your body is full of light
[49:53] now i said you're born
[49:54] with four rays of light in you so even
[49:58] if you live to be
[49:59] 90 94 or 96 or only 30
[50:03] your light starts going out after
[50:06] he explains it here so some of you
[50:10] you got i'm gonna you know set you in
[50:12] different
[50:13] uh groups here tonight some of you are
[50:17] four light people and
[50:20] because brother brown said when you're
[50:21] born you're born with four rays of light
[50:24] how many believe that
[50:28] uh you mamas know when your baby's born
[50:31] they gotta hold off
[50:33] they gotta the lights don't look very
[50:36] good they're
[50:36] but they're powerful strong powerful
[50:39] strong
[50:40] amen just keep some keep some fighting
[50:43] on amen
[50:44] we thank the lord powerful and you're
[50:45] young when you're young when you're five
[50:47] six years old we never we never were
[50:50] scared about
[50:51] uh sneezing on each other when i was
[50:53] five six years old
[50:55] nobody ever got sick when i was five or
[50:57] six years old we did get sick but it
[50:58] would just last a day or so because
[51:00] lights was inside of the power was
[51:02] inside of us amen
[51:04] couldn't stand it a germ get on a real
[51:07] believer
[51:08] a real young a powerful person full of
[51:10] light and that
[51:11] old germ will get sick and tired of
[51:13] being around there like brother adam
[51:15] when he was
[51:15] devil was telling me he was going to die
[51:17] for eating the bees and onions and a
[51:18] cornbread and he said devil
[51:20] let me have a little talk with your
[51:22] buddy said not buddy but you know devil
[51:24] i guess you have what do you call the
[51:25] devil
[51:26] devil that means tormentor he's no good
[51:29] he'll never be any good why because he
[51:31] rejected the light amen
[51:33] he rejected the light but thank god you
[51:35] accepted the light
[51:36] he said temple i got something to tell
[51:38] you do you like
[51:40] to hear me william branham worship
[51:43] god and the devil said no he said then
[51:46] you better get out of here because
[51:47] that's what i'm fixing to do right now
[51:49] because i've been healed i've been
[51:50] prayed for and i'm not going to die like
[51:52] you think
[51:53] i'm all right amen oh brother that man
[51:56] had light in him didn't he
[51:58] how many believe that thank god for that
[52:01] so we appreciate that so after he
[52:02] said you're born with four rays and
[52:04] after a little while say okay four how
[52:06] many are under 25
[52:10] don't be ashamed of it i know you'd like
[52:14] to be
[52:15] elder or veteran you know like me but
[52:17] you know don't be ashamed to be a young
[52:19] come on
[52:20] that's great i'll trade
[52:25] you you've got you're a foray person
[52:30] and then after a little while about 20
[52:32] 25 one ray goes out so how many is
[52:34] 26 in and be seen between
[52:38] 26 and 35
[52:42] god bless you i'm putting all this down
[52:44] in the book
[52:47] somebody sent me here
[52:49] [Laughter]
[52:51] and you've got to be careful somebody
[52:53] you're going to start infiltrating our
[52:55] church and taking down names and
[52:59] informations about us
[53:04] and you know they'd have to because some
[53:05] of us are so such secret believers i
[53:07] don't know anything about it
[53:11] i'd like our testimony to be shining out
[53:13] there where there's no secret who i
[53:14] am amen there's no secret what i believe
[53:20] i want my light to be very bright amen
[53:24] how many love god so then
[53:27] he said then okay so you're in the goal
[53:30] we saw a couple of hands
[53:32] of the three light category then after
[53:35] about 35
[53:37] uh or 40 another one goes out
[53:41] now how's your minds tonight
[53:45] your arithmetic four minus
[53:49] three
[53:53] so you got one light after he says 45
[53:58] and uh then
[54:02] wait till you get about 65 you really
[54:05] know you only got one light left
[54:09] were you you didn't between 45 and 65
[54:11] you thought you were at your best but
[54:12] not it
[54:13] is not sold because physically
[54:17] you only had four minus three
[54:21] that just leaves one but there's
[54:24] something about that last
[54:25] light there was just god grace and mercy
[54:28] that as he put those lights in the human
[54:30] being they weren't weaker
[54:33] but stronger as they went to that fourth
[54:35] one
[54:36] because you've watched people who are
[54:37] after 65 70 they'll make you wish
[54:40] you could do what things can do what
[54:43] the stamina that they have like they'll
[54:46] they'll say it and i think it's
[54:48] kentucky's saying as well they just
[54:49] don't make them like they used to
[54:52] and you know it's just it's that way you
[54:53] see people rugged tough
[54:55] by laverne wallace for the russell's
[54:56] daddy sister serenity's
[54:58] uh grandpa there god bless you all of
[55:00] you
[55:01] i'm not gonna start calling your names i
[55:03] won't be done before 10 o'clock if i do
[55:05] that
[55:06] because it take me five minutes or ten
[55:09] to remember
[55:11] some of your names but i'll never forget
[55:12] a face
[55:14] we're going to be together forever amen
[55:17] but thank god
[55:18] but you know when on that statement i
[55:21] don't remember like i used to
[55:23] but when i need to i have a memory
[55:27] god quickens us amen how many believe
[55:29] that when you need to do something you
[55:31] can do it because
[55:32] god put light in you that has a
[55:35] capability that you don't have right
[55:37] amen so we find then um
[55:41] that on that last slide i was talking
[55:43] about brother wallace
[55:46] 95
[55:49] or 4. and just fell and broke a hip the
[55:53] other day and
[55:55] well three years ago he broke the other
[55:57] one
[55:59] and you know we keep we keep thinking
[56:02] well
[56:03] he'll that'll be it now he'll just go
[56:05] downhill
[56:06] yeah he got some light you got a
[56:09] powerful light
[56:11] he i think that they took him and did
[56:13] surgery put a rod in there tied
[56:15] the ball and the female bone together
[56:17] had to be tied together with a
[56:19] rod it probably hurts anybody had hip
[56:22] surgery
[56:23] shoulder surgery
[56:26] i would imagine it hurts but somebody
[56:30] told me they saw you the other day and
[56:32] said brother oh poor brother he said
[56:34] poor nothing he said
[56:35] he said i'm all right he's back on his
[56:38] feet
[56:39] going around i said you know it's just a
[56:41] type of something else now
[56:43] it can't be just natural because
[56:46] naturally you'd want to just
[56:48] give up you want to retire you want to
[56:49] get out you want to escape you want to
[56:51] just
[56:52] fold up sit down do nothing wait for
[56:55] your time to come you know live your
[56:57] life out like that but
[56:58] a believer the longer they go in this
[57:01] message the longer they walk in the
[57:03] light
[57:04] the more they surrender to the light
[57:06] that's inside of them
[57:09] the more god has a hold of them and the
[57:12] more they understand that their purpose
[57:14] their purpose is to give light in this
[57:17] dark haze that we live in amen
[57:19] and we are in a dark age and brother man
[57:22] said they're depending on you
[57:24] those heathen out there depending on you
[57:26] and me somebody around here these even
[57:29] around here depending on you and me
[57:31] my brother is that true
[57:35] he said brother said i would witness
[57:37] more but i'm ashamed of my life okay
[57:39] if you didn't if you said that then we
[57:41] need to get something different going on
[57:45] we need to have more power of life but
[57:47] the bible didn't talk about a defeated
[57:50] light
[57:50] did the bible say that the evening light
[57:52] was a defeated light
[57:54] that was a wimpy light there was a weak
[57:56] light that it was
[57:57] unqualified light the bible said it was
[58:00] it was a
[58:01] your light and there was a powerful
[58:02] light and it would it would the glory of
[58:05] god would be seen in your life through
[58:07] that light
[58:08] if i had spiritual eyes i could see a
[58:10] light over every one of you
[58:12] that has that light of god now this is
[58:15] where i'm going
[58:17] because our time is running fast
[58:21] you have four lights and then when that
[58:22] last light goes out
[58:25] you're finished your life goes out of
[58:26] you now some people
[58:28] lose that light through accident or
[58:32] other thing in an untimely way they lose
[58:35] those lights
[58:37] and that light's what's keeping you
[58:38] alive
[58:42] did you ever watch people who some
[58:44] people that just go through life just
[58:45] existing
[58:47] and other people are just living life
[58:50] they're
[58:50] they're not worried about everything
[58:52] they're taking things as they come they
[58:53] they're flexible they're not beat down
[58:55] by everything always complaining
[58:57] they're positive they they're they're
[58:59] high on life
[59:01] you're not going to believe that when i
[59:02] was a hippie in the world and people
[59:04] were getting high
[59:05] and everything and stuff and i met this
[59:07] guy one time
[59:08] and i said i said hi
[59:11] are you high and he says yes i said what
[59:14] are you high on
[59:15] life it cut me to the heart i never
[59:19] thought about that
[59:20] how could you be high on being alive you
[59:23] had to have something to stimulate some
[59:25] stimulant
[59:26] to help you through this traumatic world
[59:27] back in my days it was a vietnam
[59:29] conflict the world was in a mess atomic
[59:31] bomb
[59:31] everybody is worried about the earth
[59:33] blowing to bits and the insanity and the
[59:35] evolution teaching and all this stuff
[59:37] coming on which is a predecessor to what
[59:39] we got now
[59:40] this thing's been coming a long time
[59:42] brother this didn't just drop in on us
[59:44] this has been coming a long time and
[59:47] what it is
[59:48] is satan trying to put down your light
[59:50] my brother but he can't
[59:52] because the darkness cannot overcome the
[59:54] light is that true
[59:56] amen high on life
[59:59] i'm high on god brother i'm i'm
[1:00:03] i'm on my motivation and my strength
[1:00:07] and i can say this honestly today it
[1:00:09] isn't coffee now
[1:00:10] because i only had one cup of coffees at
[1:00:12] four o'clock this morning
[1:00:15] and i ain't running on that one anymore
[1:00:20] so all these preachers say you know it's
[1:00:22] not the coffee that's making me excited
[1:00:24] well
[1:00:24] if they just had one it might be part of
[1:00:27] it right there i guarantee it
[1:00:29] but right now ain't no caffeine left in
[1:00:31] my system
[1:00:33] you didn't slip anything in on me did
[1:00:35] you brother caleb somewhere
[1:00:37] i just had a little bottle of water and
[1:00:38] an apple and i'm starting to feel
[1:00:42] my light getting brighter again i i
[1:00:44] don't know my feelings
[1:00:46] anybody here go by feelings i'll just go
[1:00:48] by reality
[1:00:50] but brother if something if if you're
[1:00:52] depressed
[1:00:53] and all of a sudden you wait no more
[1:00:56] something
[1:00:57] something happened amen listen to the
[1:01:00] name of the lord
[1:01:02] while i was praying somebody touched me
[1:01:05] how did how do you know that brother
[1:01:07] said because i was so down
[1:01:10] i was so troubled and then all of a
[1:01:12] sudden
[1:01:13] i was lifted up again
[1:01:17] you tell me nothing happened something
[1:01:19] happened
[1:01:21] have you ever had something like that
[1:01:22] happen to you
[1:01:25] i'd like it to happen tonight i'd like
[1:01:26] to happen to every day
[1:01:28] i'd like us to realize what this light
[1:01:30] is now we're going to go in and finish
[1:01:32] this
[1:01:33] the help of the lord amen
[1:01:36] so every time he said he said those
[1:01:38] lights
[1:01:39] are just and he talked about x-rays and
[1:01:42] i don't know if you've met people who
[1:01:44] are
[1:01:44] anti-x-ray people in the message and
[1:01:47] there's people who are anti this are
[1:01:49] into that you think brother branham said
[1:01:50] they may take it to an extreme
[1:01:52] anti-doctors or you know they're not
[1:01:55] taking everything brother branham said
[1:01:56] be that
[1:01:57] they're not taking what he said but
[1:01:59] they're trying to make some kind of a
[1:02:00] rule or
[1:02:01] regulation out of the message this
[1:02:03] message is not
[1:02:04] rules and regulations this message is
[1:02:07] light
[1:02:08] and light is power and light
[1:02:11] is ability amen how many love the lord
[1:02:15] because when the darkness you're in the
[1:02:16] dark anybody ever been
[1:02:18] in the dark where you couldn't see
[1:02:20] nothing so dark
[1:02:22] you know so you can't see your hand in
[1:02:24] front of your face so dark
[1:02:26] so dark like that just one little match
[1:02:31] can light up the whole room it's the
[1:02:33] power of the light we can light up the
[1:02:35] room one little promise
[1:02:36] when you're it's so dark in your mind
[1:02:39] so dark in your heart so dark in your
[1:02:42] in your own strength is gone
[1:02:46] one little one little promise
[1:02:50] whoa now i can go now i can live now i
[1:02:53] can serve now i can do
[1:02:55] now i know what i have to do hey
[1:02:58] man what about a blind person not blind
[1:03:00] but a person who's walking in the dark
[1:03:03] and they can't see anything and
[1:03:04] they can't see
[1:03:14] they just they don't know what that is
[1:03:18] they don't know what that is but put a
[1:03:21] little light on
[1:03:25] confidence comes again being confident
[1:03:28] of this very thing the bible said
[1:03:31] where's our confidence going i'm not
[1:03:34] confident in the president i'm not
[1:03:35] confident in the government
[1:03:36] i'm not confident in politics i'm not
[1:03:39] confident in the economy
[1:03:40] i'm confident in god i preached the
[1:03:43] people
[1:03:44] had no economy but they ain't better
[1:03:46] than the princes
[1:03:47] they ate better than the royal family
[1:03:50] because god provided for them
[1:03:51] supernaturally
[1:03:53] i've been in pepto's homes where they
[1:03:55] had a nicer house than the
[1:03:57] mayor of the city because the mayor was
[1:04:00] an idol worshiper in the past was just
[1:04:01] simple on their knees praying all the
[1:04:03] time and god just made
[1:04:04] i don't know how it happened do you ever
[1:04:06] hear the song
[1:04:08] pennies from heaven there's an old old
[1:04:10] son that ages you boy if you

[1:04:15] aged yourself put yourself way

[1:04:29] anymore nobody'll give me any
[1:04:31] offerings or anything else don't worry
[1:04:32] about the god can make the hundred
[1:04:34] dollar bills rain out of the sky
[1:04:36] for me god could lay me on one of your
[1:04:39] hearts and you could
[1:04:40] you could take care of me the rest of my
[1:04:42] life god can
[1:04:45] i don't expect you will but uh listen
[1:04:48] just saying that god can do anything

[1:04:59] amen
[1:05:00] that's why i'm so glad i got here and uh
[1:05:02] we spent we spent an hour together with
[1:05:04] caleb and i brother thomas on the phone
[1:05:05] brother richard and
[1:05:06] steven and all this time and well once i
[1:05:10] got stephen turned away from
[1:05:13] his depression over uh this whatever
[1:05:16] this
[1:05:16] is is this an election no i don't know
[1:05:18] what it is
[1:05:19] but whatever it is our brother said i'm
[1:05:23] in shock i said well okay
[1:05:25] let's talk about something that will
[1:05:26] help you so we start talking about god
[1:05:29] he said that's right
[1:05:30] that's right that's right that's right
[1:05:32] pretty soon
[1:05:33] hey there's no there's no depression
[1:05:35] anymore why
[1:05:36] light came on the scene now you can see
[1:05:38] where you can walk
[1:05:40] what you can do now amen is it all right
[1:05:43] if i preach a little bit
[1:05:45] i mean a little
[1:05:49] and so we're getting to this glorious
[1:05:52] part of this because
[1:05:53] this is sad part because i'm on my last
[1:05:55] light but i'm telling you what this was
[1:05:57] this one about what system emerges honey
[1:06:00] i don't understand you you should just
[1:06:03] rest you've gone too many times overseas
[1:06:07] you've gone across the seas and all my
[1:06:09] life i get to write
[1:06:10] books about those trips
[1:06:14] just like many of those even the
[1:06:16] traveling part of it so
[1:06:17] hard so a brother traveling overseas in
[1:06:20] the military
[1:06:21] that is no glory to all of that stuff
[1:06:24] the glory is knowing you're doing
[1:06:26] something that's helping somebody have a
[1:06:28] better life
[1:06:28] amen so i was telling you about togo so
[1:06:31] we walk in
[1:06:32] there and we walk down to this uh
[1:06:35] village not bandundu that's in the congo
[1:06:38] um well i'll think of it
[1:06:41] when i need it i don't need it for you
[1:06:43] because you wouldn't know it's not even
[1:06:44] on the map this little town in togo
[1:06:47] we walk in there and all the people who
[1:06:50] was into this witchcraft
[1:06:52] they're looking at us
[1:06:58] and they find out we're having a meeting
[1:07:00] we start singing in heaven's i mean they
[1:07:02] all just kind of filter over one by one
[1:07:04] but one by one the whole town turned out
[1:07:05] and
[1:07:06] all the elders there were witches
[1:07:09] and leaders who had kept the people in
[1:07:11] bondage and the
[1:07:12] younger people were the people that had
[1:07:15] been held in bondage by the witchcraft
[1:07:18] and they sat and i they called me up to
[1:07:21] preach and i stood there
[1:07:23] i didn't preach any fancy sermon i'll
[1:07:25] guarantee you
[1:07:26] because i've never been known to do that
[1:07:29] but i just preached the gospel
[1:07:31] and the next thing you know before i
[1:07:33] even stopped they all
[1:07:35] are at the altar 100 people i don't know
[1:07:38] what in the world
[1:07:39] it was something that the light had done
[1:07:42] it was not something that no man had
[1:07:44] done
[1:07:44] it is what the light had done and so i
[1:07:47] prayed over them
[1:07:48] i prayed to them and listen they were
[1:07:51] like in
[1:07:52] unison that they all represented
[1:07:55] one group of darkness and until the last
[1:07:58] one got prayed for they were all going
[1:08:00] to stay up there
[1:08:03] they weren't in exist to go back to
[1:08:04] their seat they were waiting for
[1:08:06] everyone to get prayed for and after i
[1:08:08] prayed last one they gently went back to
[1:08:10] their seats and then i went away
[1:08:13] uh we went away had another meeting or
[1:08:14] two and then i went away
[1:08:16] and i come to find out the brother said
[1:08:18] brother can your church help us to build
[1:08:20] a church because we got
[1:08:22] 100 new converts they said all the witch
[1:08:25] leaders
[1:08:26] all those all those sorcerers uh
[1:08:29] have repented give their hearts to the
[1:08:31] lord and i've baptized them
[1:08:33] and said that they're i'm gonna make
[1:08:35] deacons and preachers out of those guys
[1:08:39] i said praise god i said he said the
[1:08:41] kids they said yeah and you don't have
[1:08:43] to tell them
[1:08:44] that they're immoral or dressing wicked
[1:08:47] you don't
[1:08:47] to tell them that they look like the
[1:08:49] devil himself
[1:08:50] they just know it something came on them
[1:08:53] and then
[1:08:54] he said here's the testimony brother he
[1:08:56] said when you
[1:08:58] brothers walked into the village that
[1:08:59] day and everybody was looking
[1:09:01] they weren't looking at your you just
[1:09:04] because there was a white
[1:09:05] skin color there amongst those people
[1:09:07] they were looking at a light that was
[1:09:09] over top you people
[1:09:10] i said oh god i didn't even feel it
[1:09:13] listen you don't feel it sometime but
[1:09:15] it's there
[1:09:16] you don't know it's there but god put it
[1:09:18] there for a reason to help you
[1:09:21] to make us realize that we're not worthy
[1:09:23] of it because we're not always living
[1:09:25] the best kind of life to where well lord
[1:09:27] i'm worthy of more light you know more
[1:09:29] credit
[1:09:30] i wasn't worthy of what brother byler
[1:09:32] said there i guarantee you that
[1:09:35] but i'm humbled by that but i'm not only
[1:09:37] humbled i'm
[1:09:38] challenged because if somebody said i've
[1:09:41] done things for god
[1:09:43] i want to wonder when i want to start
[1:09:46] doing it now
[1:09:46] that's the way i'm thinking about it
[1:09:48] where am i gonna ever
[1:09:50] let this light have its way in my life
[1:09:53] that's what i want
[1:09:55] how many love the lord
[1:09:58] now i guess back that gets back to being
[1:10:00] crazy in love
[1:10:02] i'm so crazy in love for lord jesus
[1:10:04] christ that
[1:10:08] you you can't stop me until god says
[1:10:10] it's time this is like with all of us
[1:10:13] nobody can take you out of here until
[1:10:15] god says it's your time to go
[1:10:17] brother david those testimonies i love
[1:10:19] those testimonies nobody can take you
[1:10:22] out of here till god
[1:10:23] says it's time for you to go amen
[1:10:27] until that light moves out amen blessed
[1:10:31] be the name of the lord
[1:10:32] so here we're coming down to our point
[1:10:36] four lights in the natural birth right
[1:10:39] he's talking about the natural birth
[1:10:41] you were born with four lights
[1:10:45] and uh then because you're a time
[1:10:48] creature
[1:10:49] time takes the toll on that light and
[1:10:52] you wear out i think it was brother
[1:10:54] david and brother thomas and i were
[1:10:55] there together and
[1:10:56] talking about oh you still look young
[1:10:58] and he said same thing about
[1:11:00] me i think did you you had an
[1:11:02] opportunity
[1:11:05] i said no you probably thought i looked
[1:11:06] 100 tonight being tired not sleeping
[1:11:09] last night and stuff but that's uh
[1:11:10] that's no problem
[1:11:13] the light can make you look young again
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:18] we were all telling each other how good
[1:11:20] each other looked and i said we are all
[1:11:22] lying to each other
[1:11:24] but we believed it you know we said boy
[1:11:26] really
[1:11:28] and that that's what stimulated me to
[1:11:30] preach this sermon i'm going to tell you
[1:11:31] that
[1:11:32] that's what stimulated me to preach this
[1:11:34] sermon i said perfect because
[1:11:36] and then when brother told the testimony
[1:11:38] about the licks of fire from brother
[1:11:40] jason and the pillar of fire that's on
[1:11:41] the believers and then thinking hey
[1:11:43] where am i preaching tonight
[1:11:45] in the evening i said that's my notes
[1:11:47] i've got those notes for this church
[1:11:49] right here amen
[1:11:50] amen so what it is what it is we're
[1:11:53] coming down to the
[1:11:54] the final part of this what it is is
[1:11:57] this
[1:11:58] you're made up of these four lights but
[1:12:01] there are limited lights
[1:12:03] they have a limit like a a a life
[1:12:08] like a battery has so much limited life
[1:12:11] or a light bulb has so much limited life
[1:12:15] amen i don't care what kind of light
[1:12:18] bulb
[1:12:19] if you if you're in a light bulb
[1:12:20] business they know light bulb that's
[1:12:23] going to last forever
[1:12:25] it's got a life expectancy and it might
[1:12:28] go beyond that but it's going to
[1:12:31] sometimes go dark again amen but
[1:12:34] so what's prophet going on talking about
[1:12:36] it and he says
[1:12:38] in the in uh uncertain sound 1960
[1:12:43] but always get ready for a change when
[1:12:46] that word butt comes in there like paul
[1:12:49] said we were
[1:12:50] lost and then we were sinners and we
[1:12:52] were undone
[1:12:53] and under the power of the darkness and
[1:12:55] everything in the book of ephesians paul
[1:12:57] apostle paul said but god who is rich in
[1:13:01] mercy amen
[1:13:03] see what's that like the devil's telling
[1:13:05] us you're gonna you're going down your
[1:13:06] church you're dying you're getting old
[1:13:08] you're losing your power
[1:13:09] losing your strength losing your joy
[1:13:11] losing your testimony losing your zeal
[1:13:14] losing your fire but they haven't heard
[1:13:16] the rest of the story
[1:13:18] but god rich in mercy what's this
[1:13:22] and this is where my subject goes
[1:13:27] i think there is another light brother
[1:13:31] random said
[1:13:33] and that's god and he said god
[1:13:36] is a different light than these cosmic
[1:13:39] lights which is human literal temporal
[1:13:42] physical we
[1:13:45] can weary that eventually go out
[1:13:48] god is a different light and one
[1:13:52] time we listen now
[1:13:56] is brother been talking to us right here
[1:13:57] he's right here
[1:14:01] you don't have to resurrect him call him
[1:14:03] back he's done his ministry put it right
[1:14:04] here
[1:14:07] you know that boy so the first time i
[1:14:09] heard brother brown's voice
[1:14:11] i was a drug addict i was a sinner just
[1:14:13] a crazy crazy i was crazy crazy then
[1:14:17] and darkness but you couldn't have told
[1:14:19] me that i had the answers for it i was
[1:14:21] so smart when i was 18 19 years old i
[1:14:23] knew everything
[1:14:25] some of you were too weren't you now you
[1:14:27] got a few years on you i wonder
[1:14:29] what what happened to me i used to know
[1:14:31] so much
[1:14:34] and i was looking over some of my old
[1:14:35] notes that i did some sermons that i
[1:14:37] preached years ago and i said
[1:14:38] man did i preach that that's way deeper
[1:14:41] than what i preach now
[1:14:43] but yet i'm deeper
[1:14:47] and yet simpler than i was before what's
[1:14:49] happened
[1:14:50] life isn't interested in embellishing
[1:14:53] things
[1:14:54] it isn't interested in just just words
[1:14:57] light is interested in power
[1:15:00] illumination
[1:15:01] lighting up exposing the enemy giving
[1:15:04] you
[1:15:04] power over the darkness amen
[1:15:07] blessed be the name of the lord thanks
[1:15:10] be to god for his love and mercy
[1:15:12] i didn't finish the story about togo and
[1:15:14] as a result of that church there which
[1:15:15] we've built
[1:15:16] and dedicated another brother was
[1:15:19] visiting said i heard about that light
[1:15:21] that was down in that village down there
[1:15:23] that time and i came
[1:15:24] in here and turned these witches into
[1:15:25] deacons and preachers
[1:15:27] and these young people who were under
[1:15:28] the spell look watch young people
[1:15:31] satan wants to get you under the spell
[1:15:33] of music of sin
[1:15:34] of ungodliness immorality filth and
[1:15:37] stuff and
[1:15:38] things like this sin wants to write in
[1:15:41] sin is the darkness
[1:15:42] sin will take you dark it'll put the
[1:15:45] light out of you it'll
[1:15:46] take your joy away anybody ever had joy
[1:15:50] and then lost it
[1:15:51] what what happened darkness came in on
[1:15:54] your joy
[1:15:55] amen satan came in with some believing
[1:15:57] get your beliefs like eve in the gardens
[1:16:00] looking for new light darkness came in
[1:16:02] on her darkness came
[1:16:04] in on her don't welcome everything into
[1:16:06] your life
[1:16:07] reject the evil resist the darkness
[1:16:14] amen absolutely right
[1:16:18] and you have to do that and i guess if
[1:16:22] if we didn't have this gospel to be
[1:16:23] fired up about we'd be fired up about
[1:16:26] civil disobedience we'd be trying to
[1:16:28] start a little march
[1:16:32] i'd be over here starting to trying to
[1:16:35] rouse you
[1:16:35] up and let's merge let's express ourself
[1:16:40] we have a right you know
[1:16:43] but do you think that's gonna work
[1:16:48] because the light said it's
[1:16:52] got to go darker and darker and darker
[1:16:53] over here
[1:16:56] you know i'm kind of kicking myself
[1:16:58] because i dug out a quote where brother
[1:17:00] and i told the church and i keep it
[1:17:01] comes back to me all the time you read
[1:17:03] what brother branham said
[1:17:05] so you can hope you know for uh
[1:17:09] four more years or a a a
[1:17:12] a period of time of liberty civil
[1:17:15] liberties religious liberties and
[1:17:18] um constitutional um
[1:17:22] rights that have been guaranteed to us
[1:17:24] by almighty god
[1:17:26] but when brother
[1:17:30] branham said he said it's honeycomb with
[1:17:32] communism back in the 50s 54.
[1:17:35] and he said and it wants to take over
[1:17:38] and he said and it will take over
[1:17:43] so you know that'll almost make you kind
[1:17:46] of
[1:17:47] depressed again you're fatalistic wow it
[1:17:49] can't get
[1:17:50] better can't get better
[1:17:53] it can't but you can
[1:17:58] you can look at daniel down there in the
[1:18:00] into babylon you know in the hebrew
[1:18:02] children for all years 70 years with a
[1:18:04] heathen nation
[1:18:06] they wouldn't be able to go to church or
[1:18:08] even publicly say praise the lord or
[1:18:10] anything
[1:18:12] that were ridiculed that were persecuted
[1:18:14] they were squeezed when the squeeze come
[1:18:16] down god's got an exodus amen and
[1:18:19] and god's light came over those men and
[1:18:22] enlightened
[1:18:23] the hebrew children in the in the in the
[1:18:25] bird in the fiery furnace and a light
[1:18:27] myth
[1:18:28] unlike met daniel in the lion's den
[1:18:31] this whole message is about light you
[1:18:33] can't talk about this message we're not
[1:18:35] talking about light
[1:18:36] but and we'll look at the audience says
[1:18:37] i see a light over you son
[1:18:39] he said the holy spirit is a light and
[1:18:42] he said it said pillar fights it's
[1:18:43] me my opinion it's the same lord jesus
[1:18:45] christ that brought the children of
[1:18:47] israel out of egypt
[1:18:48] is here now with us the message of the
[1:18:51] hour amen
[1:18:53] i believe that don't you so god is a
[1:18:56] different light but he is a light and
[1:19:00] one day coming back to that quote
[1:19:03] because i want you to believe this
[1:19:06] so you don't take these quotes lightly
[1:19:09] i mean don't play the words
[1:19:12] don't take them like they don't really
[1:19:16] mean what they say
[1:19:18] take them with the weight and the light
[1:19:20] could mean
[1:19:21] bright light visible light or light
[1:19:24] could mean
[1:19:26] not heavy don't take these
[1:19:29] quotes lightly in my sense of
[1:19:32] like it's just some foolish because
[1:19:35] here's what he said he said one day
[1:19:38] we were
[1:19:42] walking in light capital l
[1:19:45] that's got to be god when it's
[1:19:48] capitalized
[1:19:50] there's something in your life that can
[1:19:52] be capitalized
[1:19:54] it's god
[1:19:58] devil you never put a capital d on devil
[1:20:01] i don't even
[1:20:02] write lucifer's name down somewhere i
[1:20:04] never put a capital l on it he wasn't
[1:20:05] worthy of it
[1:20:07] amen
[1:20:11] uh the english teachers you probably
[1:20:13] correct me on that because it's a
[1:20:15] it's a proper noun
[1:20:18] or a name should always be capitalized i
[1:20:21] can't
[1:20:21] i can't bring myself to capitalize devil
[1:20:27] does he deserve that ain't nothing
[1:20:30] capitalized about it maybe nothing
[1:20:31] capital about him
[1:20:33] ain't nothing big about him he's a
[1:20:35] coward to begin with why he's a devil
[1:20:37] he's a coward
[1:20:38] because he rejected the light he walked
[1:20:41] away from the light that made him a
[1:20:43] devil
[1:20:43] lucifer wasn't a devil lucifer was the
[1:20:45] son of the morning he was a light
[1:20:48] but he rejected the light that was
[1:20:51] sharing with him that there was a
[1:20:53] greater being
[1:20:55] coming not just an angel
[1:20:58] but a man in the image of god
[1:21:01] and satan rejected that but i'm telling
[1:21:04] you what there's no greater light that
[1:21:06] god ever had
[1:21:08] than what he put in his own son
[1:21:12] lord jesus christ this was that true
[1:21:15] light amen
[1:21:17] and then in our day we saw a man that
[1:21:19] was so much like jesus christ
[1:21:22] that everywhere he'd go people said i
[1:21:24] saw that light that was following that
[1:21:26] man
[1:21:28] uh where were we is down here in elkton
[1:21:30] right down here in the old uh
[1:21:32] armory uh whatever this building is
[1:21:34] remember we had that meeting down there
[1:21:36] uh brother john you were just smaller
[1:21:40] littler younger you had more lights
[1:21:44] more lights but now we're not talking
[1:21:46] about the spiritual one you got more of
[1:21:48] that now
[1:21:48] [Laughter]
[1:21:51] but we walked up and down inviting
[1:21:53] people and get a brother perry green and
[1:21:54] someone else and there was a brother
[1:21:56] from b springs kentucky
[1:21:58] um lin lineal
[1:22:02] no trying to think of his name but if
[1:22:05] you remember you tell me
[1:22:06] if your light's better than mine
[1:22:10] gates brother gates
[1:22:14] and brother gates got up he said well he
[1:22:17] said
[1:22:18] brother green's over here from arizona
[1:22:19] and different people telling you and
[1:22:21] brother ted's got this little church
[1:22:22] over here this talks about god sending a
[1:22:24] prophet and that
[1:22:25] he was fulfillment of the scripture and
[1:22:28] even time it shall be light and not not
[1:22:30] just a fulfillment but the beginning of
[1:22:32] the fulfillment we could say because we
[1:22:33] are the fulfillment amen
[1:22:35] and he said but he said ah he said i was
[1:22:38] a preacher
[1:22:39] i was a preacher in a nominal
[1:22:42] kind of pentecostal holiness church and
[1:22:45] all my people one day came i'm saying oh
[1:22:47] did you hear william branham's coming to
[1:22:49] town
[1:22:49] you're not going to be in church next
[1:22:50] sunday brother brother gates because
[1:22:52] brother branham's here coming and he
[1:22:55] said i'll tell you truth i got real
[1:22:57] jealous and envious and he said i was
[1:22:58] really mad
[1:22:59] i was really mad that why would another
[1:23:01] preacher come in here and try to steal
[1:23:02] my people away
[1:23:05] no you'd have to be a preacher to know
[1:23:07] what i'm talking about
[1:23:09] but you know you invest a lot of time in
[1:23:11] people's life and you think you own them
[1:23:13] sometimes
[1:23:15] that goes with families too listen we
[1:23:17] gotta the light in you will be able to
[1:23:19] put your children in the hands of god
[1:23:22] you you don't have to save them you
[1:23:24] don't have to save them
[1:23:25] if you could you could have saved
[1:23:27] yourself too but you can't save yourself
[1:23:29] so you can't save them
[1:23:31] but somebody put you in the hands of god
[1:23:34] and god did the saving
[1:23:35] now you do the same thing but anyway
[1:23:36] brother gates he says
[1:23:38] i came to the meeting just out of spite
[1:23:40] because he said i just wanted to see
[1:23:42] what was so
[1:23:44] great about this man
[1:23:49] if i got the story wrong but john you
[1:23:50] straightened me out but you know some of
[1:23:52] the
[1:23:54] your mama would probably remember that
[1:23:56] real well
[1:23:58] one of these days we'll have all these
[1:24:00] things like the whole picture
[1:24:02] on it beautiful and uh then he's
[1:24:06] he says and he said i was just fit to be
[1:24:08] tied
[1:24:09] i was just so angry and you just had
[1:24:12] this spirit on me like all right
[1:24:14] let's just see what this man can do
[1:24:19] and uh he said here came brother bran
[1:24:22] i'm walking out
[1:24:25] a little man with his bottle up like
[1:24:27] this and comes out here and he says good
[1:24:30] evening friends
[1:24:32] and he said and then he began crying i
[1:24:36] could already you could hardly make it
[1:24:37] out we didn't record back in those days
[1:24:38] we didn't record this testimony
[1:24:43] he started crying so bad i couldn't make
[1:24:45] out what he was saying too good but
[1:24:46] like the gist of it or the main part of
[1:24:49] it was
[1:24:52] i thought it was just going to be a man
[1:24:54] but said when that man walked out
[1:24:58] there was someone with him
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:02] and then i understood and he said i
[1:25:05] broke down and cried like a baby
[1:25:08] for days and days and days and when i
[1:25:10] came out of that crying
[1:25:11] i was a believer too
[1:25:14] praise god you don't know light by
[1:25:17] how significant it is or how you could
[1:25:19] describe it you know
[1:25:21] light by what it did what what
[1:25:23] accomplished in your life
[1:25:25] when god this is you can't put it in
[1:25:27] words well or feeling
[1:25:29] you know everybody wants a poetry make a
[1:25:31] poem about no
[1:25:32] your life becomes the poem you become
[1:25:35] the living light
[1:25:36] you become the light walking in human
[1:25:38] flesh how many love the lord
[1:25:41] so this this light this eternal light
[1:25:46] that's what adam lost
[1:25:50] and then he died see if he wouldn't have
[1:25:52] never died adam would have never died
[1:25:54] there wasn't no death there was no death
[1:25:56] but adam died because the lights went
[1:25:58] out
[1:25:59] but he lost that eternal light
[1:26:03] amen but god gave it back to him in a
[1:26:05] promise and it came back in jesus christ
[1:26:07] and now it's come in this last days
[1:26:10] the holy spirit
[1:26:13] the spirit of the living god now brother
[1:26:15] all of our excuses go out the window
[1:26:17] the way i can't do it i can't live the
[1:26:19] life i can't forgive
[1:26:21] i can't i can't quit hating that
[1:26:24] brother or sister i can't overcome my
[1:26:27] temptations
[1:26:28] yeah i can't be a witness
[1:26:32] all those excuses goes out the door in
[1:26:34] the presence of that light
[1:26:36] when that light comes in there's nothing
[1:26:38] can hold you down then because it's not
[1:26:40] you
[1:26:42] it never was about you this message
[1:26:44] isn't about you it's about that light
[1:26:46] that god hold you
[1:26:48] i'm just a light i'm i'm i'm a i'm a a
[1:26:51] vehicle
[1:26:53] uh that has the light in it amen
[1:26:57] i can't see the light in you i didn't
[1:26:59] ask you to if god wants you to you will
[1:27:02] but i know it's there because i've heard
[1:27:04] lots of people i was preaching one time
[1:27:06] and a brother
[1:27:07] was sitting in the congregation and he
[1:27:09] had a bad bad toothache it was terrible
[1:27:11] next thing he knows he sees me walk out
[1:27:14] and there's a light over my head just
[1:27:15] all preachers all christians listen you
[1:27:17] say i don't know
[1:27:18] yes it's there and said
[1:27:22] next thing i know i saw that light i
[1:27:23] said oh jesus next thing i knew i had a
[1:27:25] gold filling in my tooth
[1:27:30] now if i was part of a a black church or
[1:27:32] some kind of
[1:27:33] uh the money lover what's that guy
[1:27:37] the man who loves money dollar
[1:27:40] his name is dollar million dollar
[1:27:43] uh excuse me i shouldn't call names in
[1:27:46] the pulpit
[1:27:48] but the love of money is the root of all
[1:27:49] evil and anybody any preacher loses his
[1:27:52] ministry when he goes after the gold
[1:27:57] and satan come to me and he said look
[1:27:58] you could do that for a ministry you
[1:28:00] could make that's your
[1:28:01] your forte that could be your ministry
[1:28:03] that could be your your best thing you
[1:28:05] put the gold fillings in people's teeth
[1:28:07] and
[1:28:08] and then they'll come around they'll pay
[1:28:10] you for it
[1:28:12] you devils see light exposes the devil
[1:28:15] that's an easy one to pick up on but
[1:28:17] sometimes the devil hides himself real
[1:28:19] good in quotes and things amen
[1:28:21] but when you have a light in you you can
[1:28:23] pick up on that devil and say hi
[1:28:25] you devil with a small d
[1:28:32] amen so
[1:28:36] that's the end of my sermon our fifth
[1:28:39] light
[1:28:40] has come back see the one that adam lost
[1:28:43] jesus brought it back for us
[1:28:48] see if the body lights can go out but i
[1:28:49] got a light that'll bring me up out of
[1:28:51] the grave you've got one too i got a
[1:28:52] light that'll bring me up out of the
[1:28:53] depression
[1:28:54] it'll bring me about a coven it'll bring
[1:28:57] me up out of biden it'll bring me up out
[1:28:59] of anything
[1:29:04] see i know my audience i know you know
[1:29:06] if i you couldn't say that in phoenix
[1:29:11] i wouldn't say that i'm never going to
[1:29:13] say that ever again destroy the tape
[1:29:19] look the devil himself small d could be
[1:29:22] the president of the united states
[1:29:24] as far as as far as we know
[1:29:27] the pope of rome could be the president
[1:29:30] of the united states
[1:29:32] or camilla could be the president united
[1:29:34] states and then if so
[1:29:36] that wouldn't take my life out i
[1:29:39] wouldn't stop
[1:29:40] from telling people about christ and
[1:29:42] living right because
[1:29:43] it ain't me living it was me but it
[1:29:46] ain't me now
[1:29:48] cause this little light of mine
[1:29:51] i'm gonna let it shine i always get the
[1:29:53] feeling when i come here why is it
[1:29:54] brother songs because you're just so
[1:29:56] i love you all so much i feel like i
[1:29:57] preached this last time when i was here
[1:30:01] i know i didn't because this was just
[1:30:03] for you
[1:30:04] tonight and it's over
[1:30:08] and that's the best part to leave you
[1:30:11] with one thing
[1:30:13] that light didn't want to just remain a
[1:30:17] light
[1:30:17] up in the heaven the sky you know just
[1:30:20] shining up brightly like
[1:30:24] that christmas star
[1:30:28] no no that light wanted to become you
[1:30:34] and live in you and walk in you
[1:30:39] if you have that light which you do
[1:30:43] i told you about brother cromie i think
[1:30:44] i know i told you that story but i

[1:32:27] of my same nationality as me a dear
[1:32:30] friend
[1:32:31] and thank god for that so i was telling
[1:32:33] that story in russia
[1:32:34] and then a little girl asked her mama
[1:32:37] said could i ask could you invite
[1:32:39] brother ted's
[1:32:40] to house for dinner tomorrow and uh and
[1:32:42] uh
[1:32:44] and uh and brother dawn and brother ted
[1:32:46] and would you invite them to come over
[1:32:48] and
[1:32:49] talk to me and uh because i want to ask
[1:32:52] him a question
[1:32:54] and she was eight years old a little
[1:32:55] little precious little sweetheart
[1:33:00] those four light categories are real
[1:33:02] precious hey
[1:33:04] three lights are precious too and only
[1:33:07] two light and
[1:33:08] one light are veterans
[1:33:12] they're really precious when they're all
[1:33:14] full of that light and that zeal for
[1:33:16] life and got all these questions
[1:33:17] and they're real moldable that's why he
[1:33:21] said
[1:33:21] except you become like a little child we
[1:33:24] get all stiff and start so we know
[1:33:25] everything
[1:33:26] don't tell me i've been this message 40
[1:33:28] years don't tell me
[1:33:30] i know what the prophet said
[1:33:34] you know i've met baptists that are
[1:33:35] sweeter than some messy people you know
[1:33:38] i think some baptists got more light in
[1:33:40] them than some of them you know
[1:33:41] i want light brother i don't want
[1:33:43] theology amen
[1:33:46] you're not letting me quit some somebody
[1:33:47] here is light is keeping me preaching
[1:33:50] tell your light to stop pulling onto
[1:33:52] here
[1:33:57] no you're not doing you're not helping
[1:33:59] i'm gonna keep on but
[1:34:01] but thomas said it he said i'm a veteran
[1:34:02] and i just preach right
[1:34:05] but i've done many great things he said
[1:34:07] one of the greatest is i'm gonna close
[1:34:09] when i said i'm gonna close
[1:34:10] that's great but i haven't said i'm
[1:34:14] gonna close yet
[1:34:17] but i'm going to close
[1:34:21] i haven't forgotten thank you brother
[1:34:26] but your light and my light agrees
[1:34:30] that's exactly what i'm gonna do
[1:34:33] and uh so we went over for a beautiful
[1:34:35] meal some of the
[1:34:36] people at the church the other day asked
[1:34:37] me brother ted in russia what do they
[1:34:39] eat
[1:34:40] like is it petroleum or
[1:34:43] oil is it is it uh uh
[1:34:46] uranium uh are they starving
[1:34:51] i said no i tell you that they're not
[1:34:53] starving he said if they looked at most
[1:34:54] of us in this church they'd say you're
[1:34:56] too skinny
[1:34:57] your cheeks are gonna be out like this
[1:34:58] you know
[1:35:03] and i said i said
[1:35:06] man no they'll kill your food the food's
[1:35:08] delicious so she gave us a beautiful
[1:35:09] meal
[1:35:11] with a little girl she hadn't slept all
[1:35:13] night
[1:35:15] she's just anxious to ask me a question
[1:35:19] so after the dinner she said now
[1:35:22] brothers i'd like you to come in the
[1:35:23] room my little sweetheart i can't
[1:35:25] remember her name
[1:35:26] i wish i did i can see her in my mind's
[1:35:28] eye
[1:35:29] and uh said i have a little question
[1:35:32] then the interpreter brother vitale who
[1:35:34] was the
[1:35:35] pastor up there in uh not vitali
[1:35:39] uh it was another russian name and he's
[1:35:43] he says she wants to ask you this
[1:35:45] question but she said another tit
[1:35:47] to ask brother ted asked brother ted
[1:35:50] when he was telling a story about his
[1:35:52] friend
[1:35:52] who had the light in his heart oh so
[1:35:55] sweet
[1:35:59] she said do i have that light in my
[1:36:03] heart
[1:36:04] brother ted some of you may remember i
[1:36:07] think i
[1:36:08] told you that once before that's a
[1:36:10] touching stone i was so touched by
[1:36:13] after my eyes were watering for a while
[1:36:16] i said brother dawn oh he was a crybaby
[1:36:19] too
[1:36:21] he was growing oh man this is so sweet
[1:36:25] this is the presence of the lord just a
[1:36:26] little house there
[1:36:28] food was precious one soul it was just
[1:36:31] one little girl you know but
[1:36:33] light is thy light has come that was her
[1:36:36] light she needed to know about her
[1:36:38] light so well i said sister i said
[1:36:41] any interpreting for me it says do you
[1:36:45] love the lord jesus christ die she said
[1:36:48] that's russian yeah yep ah
[1:36:53] you've been baptized in the lord lord
[1:36:55] jesus christ's name you've been
[1:36:57] obedient you identified yourself with
[1:36:59] jesus in the baptism
[1:37:02] you read your bible and pray every day
[1:37:07] you help your mommy around the house
[1:37:09] love to go to church and i asked her a
[1:37:10] few more questions
[1:37:13] next thing
[1:37:16] yes yes my little sister you have that
[1:37:20] same lag in your heart the holy ghost in
[1:37:24] your life
[1:37:25] the sometimes you know it right
[1:37:28] sometimes you don't know
[1:37:30] i've met people i didn't know whether
[1:37:32] they had the holy ghost they said they
[1:37:33] did but i didn't know
[1:37:35] but that time with that little girl i
[1:37:37] knew
[1:37:39] anybody identify with that
[1:37:43] and thank you yeah we're all children
[1:37:46] the like we go through similar things
[1:37:48] we had we agree our lights agree
[1:37:52] because we're all from that big light
[1:37:56] same light and
[1:37:59] so i thought lord and so
[1:38:02] soon as i told her
[1:38:05] she didn't even say die anymore she just
[1:38:08] fell
[1:38:08] sound asleep in everybody's arms
[1:38:12] jed slept all night she just was gonna
[1:38:14] be wanted to know the answer
[1:38:17] now she was okay
[1:38:20] uh couldn't we couldn't that happened to
[1:38:22] us even on a wednesday night service
[1:38:24] sometime or just didn't prayer me just
[1:38:25] some prayer meetings just
[1:38:27] you and god alone sometimes that could
[1:38:28] happen until
[1:38:35] that's about our heads heavenly father
[1:38:42] and it's nice to talk about the light
[1:38:44] you know what how great the light is
[1:38:46] and we'll walk in this beautiful light
[1:38:50] how beautiful the light is
[1:38:51] it's nice to talk about it and try to
[1:38:53] paint word pictures
[1:38:56] which preaching is just painting
[1:38:57] wordpress pictures of
[1:39:00] something that can't even be painted
[1:39:03] really
[1:39:04] but what's even nicer is when it just is
[1:39:07] there you know
[1:39:09] when the light is there right
[1:39:14] and when it's there you'll know it's
[1:39:15] been there
[1:39:17] how will i know brother you'll know
[1:39:25] i want to see that and that's my whole
[1:39:26] life's purpose is to
[1:39:30] carry that light let others see it
[1:39:34] but not just so they could identify it
[1:39:37] with me
[1:39:39] i mean i've showed pictures of brother
[1:39:40] madam with pillar fire over his head all
[1:39:42] over the world
[1:39:43] so the films everything all over the
[1:39:44] world japan and all different languages
[1:39:47] showed brother brahms films and people
[1:39:48] oh i believe i believe
[1:39:50] it's nice to believe that the light was
[1:39:53] with him
[1:39:56] but what's even more significant as
[1:39:59] as i come to a complete close now
[1:40:03] is has the light
[1:40:06] been there in your life is it there
[1:40:12] maybe there'll be somebody to say
[1:40:13] brother ted wow i just i'm thinking
[1:40:14] about this and
[1:40:18] you know i'm putting a lot of shadows
[1:40:20] out here lately
[1:40:21] i'm putting a lot of shadows out that's
[1:40:24] a mixture of light and dark i mean it
[1:40:26] proves there's light
[1:40:27] if you've got shadow it proves there's
[1:40:30] light
[1:40:32] but it's not all light sometimes it's
[1:40:35] more dark
[1:40:38] so the scripture said there'll be coming
[1:40:41] a day there'll be
[1:40:42] kind of mixed lives you know this kind
[1:40:45] of light and then there's dark too there
[1:40:46] mixed with it
[1:40:49] but in the evening time
[1:40:53] there shall be no darkness it'll be all
[1:40:54] light
[1:40:56] so are we there
[1:40:59] maybe somebody here would just raise
[1:41:01] your hand and
[1:41:03] want the old veteran
[1:41:06] chicken that humbles me man i want to
[1:41:09] start serving god now
[1:41:11] i'm tired of not giving my all
[1:41:19] would there be anybody want to raise
[1:41:20] your hand and have us pray for you as a
[1:41:22] close of the service we'll have the
[1:41:24] musicians come
[1:41:25] i'm going to pray and then we're going
[1:41:26] to turn the service over and it's done
[1:41:33] as they come i see our brother's hand
[1:41:35] god bless you brother anybody else want
[1:41:37] to raise your hands your brother i want
[1:41:38] you to pray for me because i
[1:41:40] i don't want mixed signals i don't want
[1:41:42] my life to be shadowy
[1:41:45] i want like god bless you a hand there
[1:41:47] yes and i saw it back there and you
[1:41:49] too oh if i could do it if i could give
[1:41:52] it to you i would but i can pray for you
[1:41:54] that's what i'm gonna do anyone else
[1:41:57] i can give you the light don't expect
[1:41:58] your pastors and preachers
