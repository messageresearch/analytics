the truth is preached lord i pray this your precious name lord jesus christ amen all right and that endure temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any men but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust enticed then and when lusts hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death do not air my beloved brethren um may god that is um a sin syrian word you can be seated there are times when we keep falling down a lot of times it's over and over again and sometimes we feel defeated and feel like giving up if if you can and just keep getting back up again and never quit you have a winning spirit and you and you're destined to overcome because winning isn't always about defeating the enemy it's about how many times you can and fall down and keep getting right back up again and keep fighting and never give up now um now i was i was thinking like um about uh depression and and its effects on us like sometimes even as a christian we go through um depression sometimes and um i've i've been there like more so many times and it's it's not just a um it's not just a um sadness that goes away it's it's a mental illness and um this isn't what um my entire message is going to be about but but i j it just came to my mind since brother aaron's testimony because because it is a real thing and we can't just look down on it like it's it's something that you just it's just a small sadness thing that goes away in a few days it's something that that that can really negatively affect you and and sometimes make you suicidal i looked up on um i looked up online what was the definition of depression it's it's a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel though the way you think think and how you act fortunately it is also treatable depression causes feelings of sadness and or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed now um i've been depressed many times and the longest time i've been depressed was when my girlfriend broke up with me i know what that's like if anyone's um being through depression it's it's a hard time and what what i did was i i began to to try to try to look for help somewhere um without going to any anyone for help and i i went to music now the thing is sure music can can help you through depression but it's the right kind of music i got into rap music and that was and and i'm not just i i actually uh brother bailey probably remembers this i asked i asked him is christian music okay he said um that he said that and you should be careful with that and he said something like um that you shouldn't really listen into that it's it's it's probably a you should stay away from it and well i of course i didn't listen to him but because i was so addicted to it i i listened to this this rapper um nf he's supposed to be a christian rapper he he uh sometimes adds a few christian words in it and and i need to address this because there's some people here that might be listening to um christian rap music stay away from it now now i was i kept arguing with my parents um is it okay like um you know i kept saying you know it's okay because it's christian it's glorifying god and stuff in a worldly manner though see it's well you can't find in the bible but like that plainly saying rap music is is wrong but it's there you just have to be able to see it because yes it's worldly now i'm not i'm not just going to speak about rap music i think i'm but it's it's like sad music and there was a spirit on it i somehow realized that a spirit had got on me and it was it's a wrap spirit and and i was always wearing a hoodie all the time and and uh always always um okay in that that kind of mood and i would um and i i began to to start creating my own music and it was the first thing kind of music and i always try to try to to think i i was glorifying god and stuff with it now i didn't i didn't uh expect to go in this direction with like music and stuff but but it was i got in a bad place because i let that music i listened to it almost every single day at work and listened to an nf and it made me it made it worse and i got a more a more depressed state than i was before thinking it was helping me but it wasn't now um now where was i going with this um my girlfriend broke up with me that that was the saddest day of my life i was i was uh crying it like it and it was it was raining outside it's a good time to be rainy and and i was just crying in the rain and stuff and i was wondering why she she told me well um she she told me she thought and she felt that god was telling her to break up with me and and i i didn't buy it of course because there's a lot of girls that say they think is god that's telling them as an excuse i thought it was just an excuse that she made up but hurt so bad and and i was depressed for months a very long long time and i got down to really a really bad place and i didn't understand it but it but um but now i realize that that god knows best in in his plan and has something much greater in store for me and someone else he wants me to be with because because sometimes we don't understand this when we go through depression and bad things are happening and and when people actually exit your life that that you think will ink uh you wonder why and sometimes it can and really hurt and [Music] you didn't see and he he uh no he knows what's going to happen in the future and it's going to end up worse than than the way that we wanted it to be and [Music] and um and so um the depression is is this kind of um prison and that that sometimes we get we can get trapped in it's a mental prison that's it that's in our mind and and we need we need to to be able to overcome it and and for me i struggled how did how was i going to overcome this trapped in this place listening to the sad music that just kept me in that place and that that's what kept me in that place is because i because i um because i listen to that music i only put myself in a worse place than i was to begin with and and um and it was hard i i really really struggled with the depression and and i'm i'm only um going on on about this because i know there's other people that that struggle with this and and if i can and help people i mean i can't i can't um i can't and tell you how to to overcome depression because i didn't know how i i in fact i don't i don't even know how exactly i got out of it except except i quit listening to that um music and when i did that the things started getting better and i i quit uh with my um i don't know i don't know how as soon as i as soon as i started and gained my focus on on on god that's when when um when and i started getting out of that darkness and and that depression and because i mean it took a long time but if you keep focusing on on this the sad things and stuff then then you're going to stay down okay um i got a story i i'll go back on my first topic um this is a story of two frogs one one frog was fat and the other skinny they had advertently jump into that milk they couldn't get out as the as the sides were too slippery so so they were just swimming around the fat frog said to the skinny frog brother fog there's there's no use pedaling any longer we're just going to drown so we might as well give up the skinny frog replied hold on brother keep paddlings somebody will get us out and they continued paddling for hours after a while the fat frog said brother frog there's no use i'm becoming very tired now i'm i'm just going to stop paddling and drown it's sunday and nobody's working we're doomed there's no possible way out of here but the skinny fox said keep trying keep paddling some something will happen keep paddling and another couple of hours passed the fat frog said i can't go on any longer there's no sense in doing it because we're going to drown anyway what's the use and the fat frog stopped and he gave up and he drowned in the milk but the skinny frog kept on paddling ten minutes later the the skinny frog felt something solid beneath his feet he had turned the milk into butter hopped out of the vat just just hold on just like just like that that that frog that skinny frog he just kept on paddling he didn't know if he was going to get out of there he just kept on going he kept on going within with with his energy he he knew there was some way he's gonna get out of this it's it's seeming like all hope is lost but but there's a light at the end of the tunnel he got out of that that place he got out of that that mess that he thought he would was in they they done messed up by jumping that uh that bucket of milk to begin with but but they only failed to escape because that one gave up that's the only reason he failed and you can't we as believers we cannot fail unless we give up and and that's it that's the only way we can and fail giving up is is the definition of failure because um no one's ever failed without giving up well i guess i guess you could say people's failed without giving up but but you've only really failed when you give up if there's a possible way now um so so just just hold on just hold on on my brother just hold on my sister we've got a long way to go we may have climbed one mountain but we have countless mountains ahead of us just keep going it may be hard but we'll get through this just keep fighting the good fight we're on the hardest path we could be on but it's worth it and easy path leads to destruction so we are blessed people to to be on such a path with hills and valleys highs and lows sometimes sadness and despair but we'll make it through to the other side if we keep fighting now now sometimes like i was saying depression can can get ahold of us even as as believers and and it can be a result of our own decisions or it could be a result of someone leaving us or someone dying or something like that happening and and there is a time to grieve and a time to be happy just like the bible says but if we stay down and we stay and stay down like that then then we'll never um get get to the place where god wants us to be god doesn't want us to stay down and sad and in in a bad mood all the time he wants us to have joy and peace and if we look to him we will have joy and peace and and we will you know if we if we just get through this and and get over the the depression and get over all these anything that's hindering us from from that joy and peace that that god gives us now i was thinking like um in in matthew 18 and 23 well matthew chapter 13 verse 18 to 23. i was on the wrong chapter there sorry um hear you there for the parable of the sower when anyone hear the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then when it catches the way that which was sown in the heart this is he which received seed by the wayside but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that hear the word and and on um with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but during death for a while for when tribulation and persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended there's so many people that that received this message and and uh received the word and but but all of a sudden things start going wrong and things start falling apart and then they give up they say i can't take this anymore things that are going bad for me tribulations have arise and then they give up they say that's it i'm not doing this anymore and they walk away and backside and go back to the world because they couldn't take it and that's these people that didn't have root in them they couldn't hold on when things got tough and in the tribulations came and persecution came by and by they they um they they fell away and they gave up and and and and sometimes it's like that you don't know should i give up i thought about giving up at one point in my life but i was i was um young at the time i was like i think like 13 i thought to myself this is so hard like you know i was in that time i was in the middle of a struggle and and it was the hardest struggle of my life and and to this day i've never witnessed and any kind of and what it was what it was what every single man almost that deals with and that's that's lust i was dealing with um uh pornography and stuff even me in aping so so um even me i struggle with with pornography just like um almost every single i i i'm pretty sure this is there's this statistic like 90 percent of every a boy in in this age has has either um seen it at one time or not in it and i believe that this needed to be addressed and i was thinking it needed to be addressed just like brother brad had said i was thinking before that i was thinking this this got to be addressed because there are so many people that are still struggling with this to this day and it's the hardest thing to overcome because it as like like i was preaching last time that the dopamine and stuff it that's the the most pleasure feeling any anyone can experience almost and and um that that kind of thing it held me down it pulled me down and i couldn't i couldn't hardly escape and i thought should i just give up i i thought about giving up i thought should i just give up and just forget about this whole thing because i i fought battle after battle after battle my entire life and and i'm just i'm still still young and i know there's many battles those to come but as a as a christian i know that that we we have to fight every single day against our own flesh because it's a waging war and we have to overcome the devil we have to to say no we have to we have to pick up the take of the cross and follow christ daily and and i was thinking or i was thinking earlier or today like you can not take up you can't because you're either gonna be holding the burdens or you're gonna be holding the cross either one you cannot hold both so so you have to lay down your burdens and and i i was thinking how how do we do that how do we lay down that burdens like if you have a lot of burdens that that's kind of hard to get rid of because it's it and it is hard and and it it i don't think it's an overnight thing now you can lay down every single bird and at once sometimes it takes it takes throwing out what one burden at a time and one burden at a time it just to um just to to be able to pick up that cross and follow christ and crucify your flesh daily and it is hard especially as a young person and you have to overcome the daily temptations every every single day it's a fight every single day we have to put on the full armor of god and keep fighting because we cannot win the war without without getting rid of our burdens and and following in christ the battles may be hard but we gotta put on a former a full armor of god and keep marching forward and never give up there may be things in our way like sickness just keep marching forward and just believe you overcome it now that's not the easiest thing to do i i know that from experience but and but we we just have to over overcome all doubt and overcome all unbelief and and keep marching forward we might fall into temptation and sin but get back up again you haven't lost it's just when you give up that's when you lose satan knocks you down get right back up again and keep fighting now i've i've um had the the moments that that i i fell down and sinned and i just felt like how could god still love me after all all this i keep falling down and and i i thought i've been and had those um thoughts um like um if you if you send it in willingly then um there's no more forgiveness for sins and then and then that's when satan tried telling me oh you can't be forgiven anymore you're done don't sin willingly well the thing is if you're still fighting and you're stu is still desiring to follow god then and still desiring to do what god wants you to do and get away from this and you desire not to do that then then you haven't sinned willingly it's it's when you you stay down and you say i want to keep doing this i want to keep sinning that's when when you're saying willingly when you walk away from god and don't come back now um losing a battle now it really hurts to lose battle against temptation but but we can't stay feeling guilty about it that that was that was definitely me feeling guilty about it for a long time especially especially if you're really close to god and then you then fall and slip up and fall into sin that's not going to change the past what's done is done move on same with being anxious about the future that's not going to change the future and and and sometimes we get so so anxious about the future like what's going to happen tomorrow and like that's not going to change anything that's going to happen that's just worry spend all your time um being patient and trusting god rather than worrying and now i i got this uh this uh famous speech from from the movie i haven't watched it the movie but here it is um somewhere along the line um you you change you stop being you you let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you're no good and when things got hard you started looking for a big shadow let me tell you something you already know the world ain't all sunshine or rainbows it's very mean and nasty place and i don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you me or nobody's gonna hit as hard as life but it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard and you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take him and keep moving forward that's how winning is done now now if you know what you're worth and then go out and and get it get what you're worth but you gotta be willing to pick the hits and not pointing fingers and saying um you ain't where you want to be because of him or her or anybody cowards do that and that ain't you and and that that is is that's very true i mean in the world and the world is a horrible place and the world will beat you down and and and keep you there if you let it and and and um we we do fall down and get hit down and we feel like oh you know how do i get out of this place i can't escape and and some people they go to to um drugs they go to alcohol and they go to to all these other things and for me i went to music and sometimes you think that the way out of it is is um suicide like and i was just thinking if if aaron and you would have went through it that and you and you would have actually killed yourself i would have showed up to your grave and and i would have wet because you were you were one of my um best friends i would have been really wet i didn't i should have reached out to you and asked what's going on but i didn't i was always busy and stuff but i would have because because you don't realize how how um you you only realize how many people actually love you if you if can you imagine um being um dead and you and uh and god allowed you to to see yourself and all the people around around your grave and weeping for you and i thought about um suicide did cross my mind before but but i never actually i always knew that that uh that was a bad idea and that that and and that one time when i when i almost was killed to when um two i started thinking back to when um you know if you know i started thinking over my life and thinking where would i have gone would i be it would have went to heaven and or would have went to hell i was like i don't know and when you don't know you're not in a very good place in your life and that and that was during a time when i was listening to rap music and and that stuff and i was in a depressed kind of state not even and made worse and and when i got home you know how i'll i'll say this testimony again if anyone forgot i was um riding a a lawn mower and and i went and in front of a um truck and it was pulling a a trailer um with a tractor on it and he almost hit me and he went i didn't realize it until later he came to it to the door and he was like saying how that that um he he was like who's the lucky guy and whatever he was saying like a bunch of filthy words and stuff and i was like well my dad said it was me and i was like hey and then i was like i all of a sudden realize i just had a vision a few days ago of myself being hit by a truck and being thrown far away that nothing like that's ever happened to me being before and that that night i knew something special about that that vision i had because i was constantly shaking awake by a vibration feeling all throughout my body and it was so traumatizing that night i felt like it was a demon that was tormenting me and i was praying like god please take this thing that's uh that's making this happen to me and then and then like i said and i had that vision and then and then i was thinking on the way home from from that um sitting in the back seat i was i was traumatized because because i what just happened to me like i i was supposed to die that day and i didn't and where would i have gone where i've gone to hell or would have gone to heaven i was like you know i didn't i didn't know it was like it was so so traumatic when i got home i wept and i said how i had that vision that night and i was like i was supposed to die that day but i didn't and here i am today still alive because god had a purpose for me and he wasn't gonna let me die because because he had he had something better for me than then to die that day i wasn't going to die that day because because god sells a plan for you if you're still alive if god hasn't and let you die yet he still haven't he still has a plan for you and and i i was gonna die but god didn't let it it happened i was supposed to die many times and i had almost stepped on a a snake in in that one time a big old snake when i was little it was a venomous snake and and it didn't it didn't i um i think i may have even stepped on it but it didn't bite he was caught up in in in that place and there there's been many times when when i i could have died that day but god kept me safe because he still has a he still has a plan for me he's not done with me yet and i say say this then you're still here god ain't done with you so don't give up keep keep going i don't care how tough it gets there it's going to get better and and i was just thinking about this verse if if things are getting tough if if things things are getting really really really bad for you and and if everything goes down like it's said to go down if if if we're put in these these camps and stuff and they torture us and and everything's getting really bad just know this that that in revelations 21 4 says and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things that passed away i say even if even if you're going through the um the worst thing that anyone has ever gone through it's gonna get better if you're if you're a christian we've gotta hope and everything will be better everything will be all right because god has a plan for each and every one of us and if we don't understand it even if we don't understand it it's gonna be it's gonna be okay to just keep holding on keep marching forward don't you give up and just like i was saying just like how um even even william brandon tried to commit suicide he put a gun to his head and he pulled the trigger it didn't go off and then he threw it down and it went off just like that so it was supposed to go off and just like an ordinary gun is supposed to but god didn't let it because god wasn't done with him and god won't let you die until until he's done with you even if you decide to give up just like aaron and here had decided to give up but jesus held back his his hand and god wasn't going to let you give up if if he was if he was just doing it it if he wasn't if he wasn't holding your hand back just for your sake he was holding your hand back just for my sake just for your family's sake because because god knows that that we would be mourning for you right now if if you had done that [Music] brother brother branham once said must jesus by the cross alone and everyone else go free there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me all this isn't a flowery bed of ease just like and just like he said we we've got to to go through these trials it's it's our destiny it's it's we have to but it's our duty it's our duty to keep getting up against our duty to keep marching forward it's our duty to to just keep holding on and hold on and carry the cross and and keep marching forward because we can't give up um god never said we wouldn't go through trials and tribulations in fact he made it clear that we would suffer for a sake remember that parable that jesus talked about if you have built your house upon the rock when you go through things remember you're in the house when the storms arise which they will don't lose hope because your house will stand no matter how rough the wind gets if your house is built on that rock it shall stand and and just like um that song that the anchor holds let's say um you're you're on that ship right let's say let's say you're on that ship you're in in a storm and the captain says lower the anchor because he's the captain knows best if you don't listen the ship might sink but you can't blame the captain because he told you to lower the anchor don't don't think that if if we just lower the sails that'll do it no there's got to be an incur lord otherwise you might drown like that a song anchor holds the anchor holes in spite of the storm but the anchors got to be lowered it's it's no good saying i've got anchor on the ship and not putting it to use and and that that's right if if we don't if we don't lower that anchor what anchor have we got to hold that that anchor we got to be anchored this morning this evening but we got we got to to be anchored now um this is something that brother branham said now before you can have a victory there there has to be a battle and if there is a battle if there is no battles there's no victory we ought to be thankful for the battles and the tryings and it's god giving us the opportunity to have victories and and i was thinking also thinking like christ is a is a healer and if um and it was in him to be healed before the foundation of the world so those that are sick you might wonder why did we get sick because christ is a healer and it was in him to heal people and it was also in him to be a savior that's why and why he he had to to die on the cross for us and there and we had to be lost in order for there to be people to to to save and and some people don't understand this but that's how it is and sorry if i'm not going as as uh good out as i was on on sunday it's just because i'm nervous and also a little bit more tired than on a sunday morning but but i'm trying but um like the the skinny fog that was in that um that bucket we might may feel like like giving up we might feel like a hope is lost it's it's not if you keep going on then then he will get through now um a while ago um i heard about the uss constitution the ship that that's never lost any any battle it was on a saturday not too long ago my uncle showed me a new poster he bought he said it was of the uss constitution a battleship that had been through numerous battles and never lost it's the the oldest ship still afloat i said if i i ever went on that ship in that time i would have a lot of confidence in it if and never lost the battle the the next day well i was just thinking if it never lost the battle that's a lot to do with jesus christ he's never lost a battle and if we're in christ if if we're in christ and we trust in him even though it looks like things are falling apart even if it looks like everything is crashing down he's never lost a battle and we can have confidence in that even if we lose battles even if we fail and mess up and and we we do all these things the stupid things that we do sometimes and mess up and fall and all way to temptations jesus christ has never failed one time and and we we can have confidence in that and know that he will get us through he will get us through the battles if we just trust in him with all all that we got in all of our mind and all of our soul if we just trust in him with everything that we've got we need to just trust in the one that's never lost a battle the next day i started thinking about that we're on the ship that has never lost a battle just like i was saying those there in christ are on the battleship that never lost and with captains that always help us through every storm the ship may be battered but but just keep going the anchor will hold the ship isn't going to sink just hold on don't give up if you're going through a storm right now you're going to make it the storm will pass just be patient god is in control and and i didn't write this entire sermon it wasn't just inspired by what aaron said i wrote this before then and i i do and i just went off of that i was like is that a coincidence that that aaron was about to do that and and i'm not putting any shame on you aaron because and i i forgive you for that man but i've i've been there i know i know what it's like to be in that kind of pressed state and and i i know that that um it can get extremely rough so and you get filled with so much pain and so much agony from what life throws at you and people leaving and everywhere even if all your you lose all your friends and and everyone leaves you you still got christ on your side and and he was the one that stopped you and he's the one that will lead you through the rest of your life just keep trusting in him and he'll get you through everything and get you through all the depression and all the things the world throws at you because he is god and he does care about you the stolen will pass just be patient god is in control in mark 13 13 says and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that that shall endure unto the end this shame the same shall be saved that that's what we got to do everyone we got to endure through the end through every tribulation that will come and it will come it's not going to be all cupcakes and rainbows but we got to keep going and and just just keep marching forward and like like james 5 11 and says behold we count them happy with gender you have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord and that the lord is very pitiful and have tender mercy so even when we we do decide we can't take this anymore god is still full of mercy and holds back our hand from from doing any harm to ourselves and and stops us from from doing anything anything like that or or um bad things that like that might harm us so stop it because because of his tender mercy god will allow bad things to happen sometimes and and um god will uh chastise us sometimes and and the bible says that we and we have to and god builds our character so if we we just think and why is all these these bad things happening why is everything crashing down just know that that um that god is in control and and know that that um and just trusting god every every single day and i know it's it can be hard sometimes but just keep going just keep enduring through the end for everything will will be all right in the end and there will be no more suffering no more affliction [Music] no no more of of this this work this world will be no more eventually and will be in paradise and we don't have to worry about these these things in this world but right now my friend we got to endure we've got to get through it all we've got to make it we got to keep going because because we we have to we have to um endure through what comes our our ways and every day and because uh christ endured the cross and now we have to take up our cross and then dirt will come at us amen so if we if we can and have faith and know that we are anchored that no matter what comes against that ship no matter what happens we'll make it through the storm we'll make it through and and just like them um people that was on the ship uh that uh jesus was on the storms arose and everything felt like it was going to it was going to fall down but jesus was on that ship they didn't realize who was on that ship and and jesus said oh ye little faith because because jesus knew that that um everything was gonna be all right but they didn't trust enough that he was on the ship that everything would be all right and we just gotta keep going and know that there's an anchor that's holding us firm in the end and we have that anchor and then um in closing um musicians if you come now um here's another few things that brother um william brandon said god's covenant with abraham and his seed god doesn't make any difference between his children every son that cometh to god and must first be tried or chastised you get it first be tried your chastised corrected child trained scold everyone and not not one exception every son have you went through trials have you went through tribulation have you suffered persecution then then then you endure these things you you are are real children of god but when you can bear chastisement when the rod comes down heavy and you run off and back into the world the bible said you're an illegitimate child and not the the children of god for for when the man's born of the spirit of god he expects those things and he loves those things and the bible said that the trials that come upon us fiery trials is more precious than gold to us think of it amen so so when when trial come and when when bad things happen and stuff i i didn't realize this when when things things don't seem to go the way we want it to go we we need to just trust in god through it all and endure tribulations trust in god through everything because he's in control he is is the the anchor that holds the ship he is instant our firm foundation we can trust in him and know that he'll hold hold us and and no matter what happens god is in control all right let's pray or stand if you will let's pray father god thank you for keeping aaron alive lord thank you lord for helping us to get through this fire lord and lord continue to help us because i know know that sometimes we feel like giving up sometimes we feel like it's so hard why god why does these things happen to us sometimes we think that lord but we need to understand that you're in control of god you're in control of it all no matter what happens no matter what trials come my way lord no matter what trials come our way you're in control lord god and help us to to be able to overcome every trial every tribulation every temptation that comes our way lord because i know that we fall and we can fall short all the time lord but help us to endure help us to stay strong in the faith lord and overcome all these trials and overcome sickness and overcome all these other things that try to get at us lord help us to overcome these things soar because we have power over them satan is just a bluff he has no control over any of us lord help help us to to know that and understand where our place is lord that that satan is just trying to cause us to to fear him and and think that that we can't make it and think that we we should just give up lord but help us to trust in you lord god help us to trust in you with all that we have with all that which is within us lord help us to trust in you lord god help us lord help us always trust in you no matter what lord i pray this in your precious name lord jesus christ amen if you could play something softly [Music] if if anyone's dealing with sickness or or anything that's going on that that they need need help they need they need some help we should we should be kind to one another and and if if some we're going through trials confess it to to one another not just hold it all inside sometimes we just want to hold it all inside because but the pressure can sometimes explode and and we we we try to escape it somehow we try to get out somehow sometimes simply agent just praying and stuff and trying to fight it alone and what won't work very well if we can just reach out to someone for for help to tell someone i always thought it'd be nice to just be able to tell someone all that is happening and you know and how you feel and everything instead of just saying i'm just fine i'm okay you know sometimes i remember that people would ask are you are you are you okay how are you doing i'm fine [Music] but i'm on a face express a fake expression i would i did that make it look like i'm happy try to try to put on on some fake act make it look like i'm okay when i wasn't and and i know what it's like if you're going through depression god can help you with that in fact he can he can deliver you from depression all together it's just a spirit of sadness is is it's called a medical illness here but i just call it a a spirit it's an evil spirit [Music] if if it's in the form of mourning then then it might not necessarily be an evil spirit but it's a sad thing to to see people suffering with with depression and and things like that and i i want to be able to do my part to try to help but in the end god can only help you with that because i can try to comfort you and and do all the best i can but but god i can help you if you just lay all your burdens down and give it all to him he can and relieve you of those burdens with the depression and stuff it's just it is hard it's very hard [Music] and i have this this story i should have said before but at work there was um there was someone that that had a really bad toothache one day couldn't hardly work and and i was just thinking and i know my god can deliver him from that and and so somehow i felt on my heart i had to go pray for him i asked him if if you would let me pray for you and and so i prayed for him and he he said it just a little better but but um i told him about how that if he had faith [Music] if he he had faith and enough faith he could be healed and so so i decided to pray for him again i had to pray for him again because he still had that toothache even though though it was based on his faith i didn't tell him that the first time so this time i i i felt i felt um inspired to say and i was i started praying i put my hand on his is on his face where his toothache was at and i said in the name of jesus christ you're healed i just that was just such an inspiration that came over me to say that and he said it was it there it was it was healed instantly god can heal instantly i know we can if you had the faith in that moment to believe evie can't [Music] he can't heal instantly and i don't know if i have the gift of healing or not but but i know we can and you you're healed already if you just believe it all you have to do is just accept it just accept the healing and there's been in times sometimes he'll he'll heal you after a while or whatever sometimes it takes time i prayed for different people at work and stuff and and they got healed and and different things like that but it didn't wasn't all instantly but in that that moment i did feel inspired to say that and and i believe because i felt inspired to say that he believed in that moment as well and accepted it so if anyone is is sick is if anyone has anything the author is open if i i do believe in healing i do believe in healing so if anyone be sick you can come and i'll pray for you [Music] amen [Music] we'll just sing that song the anchor holds [Music] is [Music] i have fallen on my knees [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] my knees [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] you you
