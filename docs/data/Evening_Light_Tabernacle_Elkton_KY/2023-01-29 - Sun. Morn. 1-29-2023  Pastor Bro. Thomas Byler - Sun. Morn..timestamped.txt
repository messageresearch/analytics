[0:07] trust in the Lord do good so shalt thou
[0:10] dwell in the land and merely Thou shalt
[0:12] be fed
[0:19] thy way unto the Lord trust also in him
[0:22] and he shall bring it to pass
[0:31] rest in the Lord and Lead patiently for
[0:34] him fret not thyself because of him who
[0:37] prospereth in his way because of the man
[0:39] who bringeth Wicked devices to pass
[0:42] foreign
[1:07] Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth his
[1:09] day is coming
[1:21] your sword shines her into their own
[1:23] heart
[1:25] for the arms of the wicked shall be
[1:26] broken
[1:28] so you may be seated but Braun
[1:36] Warner Brothers and Sisters
[1:40] you know there's a thing the word of God
[1:42] is uh I'm gonna try to print
[1:45] brother cook he's on in the morning on
[1:48] the radio station
[1:51] um he's one of those type of preachers
[1:53] or teachers that takes
[1:58] I mean one of those scriptures your mind
[2:02] will start bringing back other places in
[2:04] the Bible where and it was just some
[2:06] things let me go to this place
[2:08] the eighth verse it says and and I find
[2:11] myself as I get older
[2:13] I don't know if it's part of getting
[2:15] older or not that or it's my father's
[2:17] genes in me I find myself getting angry
[2:20] or quicker not being able to put things
[2:23] away as quick as I used to do when I was
[2:25] a young man but this ain't verse comes
[2:28] I'll start at the seven
[2:31] patiently for him in which they'll be
[2:34] living right now patiently
[2:36] waiting for the Lord to lead and guide
[2:39] you there's so much out there to make
[2:41] you run different directions but
[2:43] Patiently Waiting In Christ for God to
[2:45] show you the way to go and he goes I
[2:48] just lost my place again and not myself
[2:50] because of him who prosper in his ways
[2:54] because
[2:57] the man who bring this last one cease
[2:59] from anger and that really natural
[3:01] coming out of your voice but really in
[3:04] the age of we live in is the thoughts
[3:06] that we are evil
[3:08] you need to spend more time pushing
[3:10] those away if you push those away in
[3:13] your mind and in your heart you won't
[3:14] speak those kind of words to other
[3:16] people or to your family but if you
[3:19] would also I was with charm with me to
[3:21] Isaiah the 54th chapter
[3:26] you know I can spend hours at mine
[3:29] everyone here knows whether that mind of
[3:32] Christ is Christ and the only way that
[3:34] you can have that very mind or have that
[3:36] very experiences I read that this is a
[3:39] short chapter here this morning
[3:42] you know what I was
[3:44] I have something here that I've been in
[3:47] my office you know I'm rearranging you
[3:49] know with me and Jeanette or downsizing
[3:51] and there's a lot of stuff you know over
[3:54] the years you build up things over the
[3:56] years
[3:58] before you realize that you got an
[4:00] office full of stuff that really doesn't
[4:02] mean anything to you anymore
[4:05] and somehow life is a lot of stuff on us
[4:07] that really we shouldn't stuff that we
[4:10] have you know in our lives or I know for
[4:13] myself I need to unload a lot but um
[4:16] I'll read this chapter in Isaiah
[4:20] oh everyone that thirsts has Come Ye to
[4:22] the waters and he that have no money
[4:24] Come Ye and buy and eat and come and buy
[4:27] wine melt without money and without
[4:29] price you know and that it's the same
[4:32] problems for all of us this morning
[4:33] everything that God is going to give you
[4:35] or what you desire to have from the lord
[4:38] it's free all you have to do is come and
[4:40] drink and come and possess it it goes on
[4:42] to say wherefore do you spend money for
[4:45] that which is not bread or your labor
[4:48] for that which sound heart and
[4:51] diligently onto me ee that looks good
[4:54] and let your soul Delight in its in
[4:56] fatness you know that's the very word of
[4:58] God that's the presence of Jesus Christ
[5:00] that the table spirit for for me for any
[5:03] of us this morning it's free it's open
[5:06] and you can come and get as much
[5:09] in a natural way that you
[5:12] 've got to be willing to submit yourself
[5:14] incline your ear and come on to being
[5:17] here in your social to the people
[5:20] in the new Nazis I'll run in unto thee
[5:24] because of Lord thy God for the Holy One
[5:27] riserable and for His Glory by thee seek
[5:33] can be found called I mean that
[5:36] scripture people have it on on plaques
[5:39] in their houses
[5:40] but it doesn't change the truthfulness
[5:43] of that scripture
[5:45] you know this is the time when we need
[5:47] to seek them this is the time where the
[5:50] founders coming a day soon where God
[5:52] won't be found anymore and those that
[5:54] are righteous will be Crystal and those
[5:57] that are filthy will be filthy still and
[5:59] it says let the wicked forsake his way
[6:01] and the unrighteous man's thoughts that
[6:03] goes what I was saying in the beginning
[6:05] you know I
[6:07] you all know that the messages brother
[6:11] Brown and preaches it's your favorite
[6:13] thoughts that speak louder this is your
[6:15] mind kind in your thoughts
[6:18] and you can't hide that from them so
[6:21] whatever those thoughts are that possess
[6:23] you 24 hours a day
[6:25] that's who you really are that's who
[6:28] people abundantly
[6:30] you know that doesn't change God
[6:33] is more than able to meet your need to
[6:36] forgive your sins to if you'll forsake
[6:38] your wives and he goes on to say for my
[6:41] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[6:43] are your ways my way saith the Lord
[6:46] for as the heaven
[6:48] 's are higher than the Earth's sorrow my
[6:50] way is higher than your ways and my
[6:52] thoughts than your time
[6:54] you know the only
[6:56] righteousness that you possess is what
[6:58] God gives you you know you can't make
[7:00] yourself righteous anything good about
[7:03] you or anything righteous about you in a
[7:06] Christian saying doesn't come from your
[7:08] own ways
[7:10] but it comes John tether but the waters
[7:13] the Earth and makers they bring forth
[7:17] to the eater so shall my word be that
[7:20] God forth out of my mouth it shall not
[7:23] return unto me void but it shall
[7:25] accomplish that would I please and it
[7:27] shall prosper in the things where I
[7:29] understand and like I was saying in the
[7:31] beginning as you read that 11th verse
[7:33] you know that you you can go back to
[7:36] John you know from the 8th to the 12th
[7:39] chapter this place is in Matthew you can
[7:41] go was in and then he goes
[7:44] you shall go out with joy and let forth
[7:47] with peace the mountains and the hills
[7:50] shall Break Forth and before you into
[7:52] singing and all the trees of the field
[7:54] shall clap their hand
[7:56] instead of thorns shall come up fur
[8:00] trees instead of an abundance
[8:03] I don't have a lot to say this morning I
[8:06] was just gonna I was going for Sunday
[8:08] school before and this is well I don't
[8:10] know how long this could have been
[8:13] 20 years ago it could have been 15 years
[8:16] ago that's how much paperwork I had in
[8:19] my office
[8:20] but he
[8:22] as it's what what I was reading in the
[8:25] fifth and this uh Isaiah kind of speaks
[8:27] to what brother Brown simply have you

[30:56] before you you know you deliver me
[30:57] completely for medication I got two
[31:00] months old and uh
[31:02] so my nerves a little bit more more
[31:04] nervous I can tell you I know that it
[31:06] the the medication I was on kind of like
[31:09] suppressing adrenaline glands man so I
[31:11] was a drilling donkey saw I'm glad
[31:15] myself you know but I I just uh a few
[31:19] things on my mind I always want to paint
[31:21] a picture to you today I've been staying
[31:23] on God was praying about it yesterday
[31:24] and I didn't really know where to start
[31:25] but you know in my like I said my idea
[31:28] was Faith or fear and my devotional
[31:30] yesterday was titled Faith versus
[31:32] reality I'm like well you know that's a
[31:34] good place as they actually exist as
[31:36] opposed to an idealistic or not God ever
[31:39] is a reality if you haven't met him then
[31:43] for all you that know I could be a pen
[31:45] name
[31:47] I am saying oh I will do
[31:51] and you have the reality that I am real
[31:55] believer Elizabeth faith in God
[31:58] will do what he promised it is on the
[32:00] basis that we continue to walk in the
[32:03] word every day and hoping is coming at
[32:05] the Rapture remember today that you walk
[32:08] in belief Christ is one of their people
[32:10] sitting here tonight that was one
[32:12] wheelchairs a night or two ago they're
[32:14] walking around now and and depending on
[32:17] what what you look at if you're looking
[32:19] at your Affliction you'll never go on
[32:20] influences of God you got that you got
[32:23] the right to ever the bless and God's
[32:25] promises are not as though they were
[32:28] because God said so amen I love that you
[32:31] know
[32:32] I like brother Ron you know brother Ron
[32:35] Spencer was sharing a testimony on your
[32:36] back and you you start grassing that's
[32:38] the way I was and it's growing my
[32:39] relationship deeper with him because I
[32:41] found more ways that he can actually
[32:42] talk to me it seemed like left to here
[32:45] you know and I don't believe you got to
[32:46] be on a deathbed experience to start
[32:47] reaching out for God to start speaking
[32:49] to you in more ways you know that
[32:50] atmosphere God can he'll feel welcome to
[32:52] come and be with you you know and I just
[32:54] love that because me and my friend was
[32:56] talking
[32:57] it was about two months ago before I
[32:59] thought we had to just get prayed for
[33:01] and uh
[33:02] too much stuff and I said you know my
[33:04] family was going to be leaving for
[33:06] weekend and going down to Florida and I
[33:08] was like you know what I was like I mean
[33:10] we know ultimately God is the one who
[33:11] draws a man and Pricks their heart you
[33:13] know that's if he wanted to we could do
[33:14] whatever we can do to just get an
[33:16] atmosphere just started dealing with me
[33:17] I started feeling like you know maybe it
[33:19] was you know I was going to create we're
[33:21] gonna have our own Revival you know and
[33:22] saying
[33:23] everyone wants to call your hand on
[33:25] everything I got up here and shared it
[33:26] myself part of that with the
[33:27] Thanksgiving thanks living testimony oh
[33:30] man it just gets you fired up thinking
[33:31] about
[33:32] so I
[33:34] I want to show the devil where I was
[33:36] standing so anyway this devotional
[33:38] really this is where I started really
[33:39] speaking to me he said uh
[33:42] there's a sergeant Hooper ran into the
[33:44] crossfire to save his uh his Fallen
[33:46] comrade Sergeant Hooper uh later became
[33:48] the most decorated son and women who
[33:51] will be willing to to bring the
[33:52] spiritual there I mean not just slump
[33:54] back in fear of the living but living a
[33:57] life uh
[33:59] slump raising children up in the fear of
[34:02] the Lord Living God and raising the
[34:04] standard on God's word praise the Lord
[34:06] keep fighting a good fight today because
[34:08] our Heavenly our Heavenly reward is not
[34:10] worthy to be accounted for for suffering
[34:12] that we experience in this life stand
[34:15] Toe to Toe with Satan and claim the
[34:16] victory keep fighting that god-given
[34:18] fight the testimony that little boy said
[34:21] you've got to do it you you've got to
[34:23] fight for every inch of ground
[34:25] Mark was Satan it's is that right isn't
[34:28] that right friend it's not a picking
[34:29] about this is right before I quit
[34:31] medication stuff uh he was talking about
[34:33] brother Branham there and you know down
[34:34] guys work so I started dealing with me
[34:36] and you know I was over with my wife
[34:37] there that God had been building my
[34:39] faith up and then and you know in in
[34:40] series events things that was happening
[34:43] in my life here you know in this
[34:46] recent this past year that he's building
[34:48] the faith of you know just like David
[34:50] and Goliath you know and it was molding
[34:52] me you know he didn't just throw him in
[34:54] the fire furnace he built their faith up
[34:56] before they was ready to you know tackle
[34:58] a task like that so you know and and you
[35:02] know I think that uh you know sometimes
[35:04] it's delivering I also I thought you
[35:06] know delivering I thought it might be an
[35:08] instantaneous thing that I would get you
[35:10] know like some other things in my life
[35:12] but you know next thing I know it was
[35:13] like I was speaking to me you know and
[35:15] you know and I say I'm here you know but
[35:17] it was like God speaking to me of like
[35:19] Peter you know he had to take God at his
[35:21] word step right there on that water
[35:22] Peter had to do it Peter had to take
[35:24] that step and you know it was just like
[35:26] you know God would show him and you know
[35:27] I of course I wouldn't encourage nobody
[35:29] to stop their medication about the
[35:30] Lord's leadership I had I had a desire
[35:33] to be medication free completely hope I
[35:35] believe anyone in here that wants to be
[35:37] free from medication or fear anxiety
[35:39] depression to back up doubt drugs
[35:41] alcohol anger yes you hate work you name
[35:43] it just start seeking the Lord praying
[35:45] asking for his Deliverance asking for
[35:47] Revelation taking mind his word you know
[35:49] get on that gospel like Moses said what
[35:51] he said I'm the Lord I got heals all thy
[35:53] disease that's what they had they didn't
[35:55] have no uh
[35:58] my machine's about to actually and
[36:00] everything else man you know but so I
[36:03] started searching the scriptures you
[36:04] know but anyway so that
[36:07] the day before here here's where it
[36:08] really really hit it home for me
[36:11] the guy was speaking to me there's more
[36:13] than a Jawbone laying here with you
[36:15] tonight laying next to you no more to do
[36:17] with it right I claim Jesus Christ's
[36:19] word right live or die I'm right with it
[36:21] that's right Total Line with him claim
[36:23] their god-given privileges everyone
[36:24] hasn't got
[36:26] uh
[36:27] it's a model or I can click on
[36:31] it hasn't got one privilege he hasn't
[36:33] got the legal power over any believer
[36:34] he's stripped and robbed at Calvary
[36:36] Jesus Christ robbed him over everything
[36:38] he had and and gave
[36:41] every believer a checkbook with his name
[36:44] on the bottom of it well so where are
[36:45] you asking my name that will I do it
[36:47] your personal opinion
[36:50] the name of Jesus Christ and use the
[36:52] name of Jesus Christ and stand back
[36:54] Hallelujah the Hallmark of heaven will
[36:55] declare it and I signed that there's
[36:58] second
[36:59] completely medicated aorta healing
[37:01] completely Victory complete Victory
[37:04] completely whole perfect blood pressure
[37:06] no medications and it says anything in
[37:08] John 14 14 if you shall ask anything in
[37:10] my name that will I do it you know so
[37:12] then it was like then I stepped out on
[37:13] God's word you know and and I was
[37:15] walking on the water you know I was
[37:17] streaming and fasting and I got to a
[37:19] point there that I'm like Lord
[37:20] you know I'm passing everything I'm like
[37:23] I don't want to be ignorant here I don't
[37:24] want to be getting out of your time in
[37:25] here this could be life the last time I
[37:27] was there if I ever be obligation he
[37:29] said no because I knew God's word I
[37:30] believe I'm going to be on medication he
[37:32] said you'll never be out medication by
[37:34] God's grace I got two months completely
[37:35] God's word says it I believe it man you
[37:38] know it must be the name of the Lord
[37:40] but anyway I said Lord I'm gonna be
[37:43] being ignorant right now I got a family
[37:44] I want to take care of I got things I
[37:46] want to do for you you know whatever you
[37:47] have me do Lord I just want to serve you
[37:49] because I love you you know and then it
[37:51] was like God he said on the sermon I
[37:54] screenshotted some stuff it says Grant
[37:55] and then
[37:56] ends up a burning punishment trying
[37:58] testing not only does he dick to profits
[38:01] but he does it to his children every son
[38:02] that cometh the God must be chasing and
[38:04] tried tested by his word
[38:06] and and when when he comes into a
[38:09] pension strong time when he faces death
[38:11] are you able to stand there on God's
[38:13] word and say God said God he called him
[38:15] the second man the name Moses a great
[38:17] games now this ain't that like we do and
[38:20] he said sometimes speak to the people
[38:22] and go forward my if there'd be ever a
[38:25] time to look
[38:26] the Lord I don't want to be ignorant and
[38:28] he said there's retreating God for me he
[38:30] said there's no retreat and God go
[38:32] forward the doctor says it's cancer go
[38:34] forward he says it's TB go forward he
[38:36] says it's the devil you can't get us up
[38:38] go forward see man oh Jesus Christ can
[38:42] set you free today I don't care what it
[38:44] is you know he said a brother once told
[38:46] me I said you know I heard this I said
[38:53] he said he said if you notice either
[38:55] ain't nothing on your back because he
[38:56] said there's no retreat in God's Army
[38:58] we're only pressing forward we don't
[38:59] have to look back guys got our back
[39:00] we're going forward you know and there
[39:02] was a thing popped up said we will
[39:03] accept nothing else less than full
[39:04] Victory blessed be the name of the Lord
[39:06] you know looking over my life
[39:08] I'll take take
[39:11] Faith or fear last year for Corporation
[39:14] God visited that that night was dealing
[39:17] with me I opened my friend
[39:20] I needed something else too I loved it I
[39:22] flipped it again and said that my grace
[39:24] alcohol jealousy temper you name it
[39:28] right there blessed be the name of the
[39:30] Lord can't you think about life
[39:31] brother
[39:33] random one the guy coming up to the
[39:34] pulpit he said that's something come
[39:36] over and throw the ball out in the field
[39:37] oh something
[39:39] came over him what was it
[39:41] that I was reading
[39:44] and it was like God just quick
[39:46] ly
[39:48] uh taking God at his word if we can just
[39:50] look at it they can run with it you know
[39:52] it'll give you a piece of past
[39:53] understanding you know you can be
[39:55] you can be completely free from anything
[39:57] that you you're that you're you know uh
[40:00] blessing ain't as well of course but if
[40:02] we can just take it at face value you
[40:04] know and run brother Brown I'm gonna
[40:05] talk about you know pray for Rebel Lake
[40:08] boy it's just boy it changes everything
[40:10] we got to give you a little bit of
[40:11] Revelation you can run with it and just
[40:13] stay online it's just it's just it's
[40:15] live altering you know so that's why I
[40:17] pray pray for Malaysian like you said
[40:18] you know
[40:20] you know and I was just thinking when
[40:21] you think about the Simplicity of it you
[40:23] know he said thank God just think about
[40:24] it for a minute
[40:27] we was on his mind before the foundation
[40:29] of the world we are his thoughts made
[40:31] manifest he said if you abiding me I'll
[40:34] be with you even in you to the end of
[40:36] the world and so right now all we're on
[40:39] is this is proving ground what are we
[40:41] doing we're going back to where we once
[40:44] was huh and when you think and you just
[40:46] take that little bit of a simple thought
[40:47] there I mean this is nothing but fake
[40:50] so alive
[40:52] everything's free and the reason why
[40:54] it's so it's so uh encouraging to know
[40:57] that you know when you're on facing that
[40:59] experiencing perspective you're going
[41:00] through you know so his head your
[41:02] protection will be there and he just
[41:04] gives you something you can stand on to
[41:05] know that I'm going uh thinking about
[41:07] Joe think about Joe when he said uh you
[41:10] know that waste a year of having a
[41:12] servant he told me to do all this but
[41:13] that is knowing that if you are where
[41:15] you are today you're already done all
[41:17] you can do what God allowed him to do to
[41:19] you so you know you know God's got you
[41:21] you know and I really like this brother
[41:23] Lawson deal with the devil you know he
[41:25] decided to come over my shoulder and say
[41:26] you know you ain't you ain't you ain't
[41:28] bro you ain't saved you ain't got the
[41:30] Holy Ghost you know it goes on and this
[41:31] and that and he said you know I started
[41:33] so I started letting him know so I
[41:35] believe all y'all out there can start
[41:36] waving them
[41:40] you start waving and telling him you
[41:42] know I love you you ain't have enough
[41:43] that's why I'm here and I stand on God's
[41:45] word you know I'm thinking about that
[41:47] little story
[41:50] the birds whistling and praising God and
[41:53] just being happy and Lord saying you
[41:55] know they must not have a Heavenly
[41:56] Father Like We Do you know you know and
[41:59] you just think about it and he's like
[42:01] they must not know their Heavenly Father
[42:07] and to and to not fear and to see I wish
[42:10] I could just tell them the scripture
[42:11] right here like Luke 4 Jesus saying he
[42:14] said and he opened the book blessed be
[42:16] the name of the Lord he opened the book
[42:17] to us he from the he found the place
[42:19] Lord as upon me before he had sent me to
[42:22] heal the birdie them that are bruised to
[42:24] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[42:25] he closed the book and gave it again to
[42:27] the minister blessed be the name of the
[42:29] Lord what do we got we got an open book
[42:30] that he's giving us the revelations oh
[42:34] but we're done
[42:36] that's not how many began to say this
[42:38] day in the scriptures filled in your
[42:40] ears huh and I just love that you know
[42:43] he came to set the captives free break
[42:45] all the bonds and he lost sicknesses we
[42:49] no we are free the cross is settled
[42:52] settled it paid every debt you owe
[42:54] you're free you can stand on where God's
[42:56] word so it's God's word I believe it
[42:58] God's Gonna help
[42:59] Sword Fight for Your Life stand on God's
[43:02] promises
[43:03] foreign
[43:14] God admire a man that
[43:16] will step out like that amen toe to Mark
[43:19] the devil
[43:20] it tells you you'll never be off it'll
[43:22] kill you then for you to throw your
[43:24] medication away
[43:25] hey man that's stepping out isn't it man
[43:28] and like he said You Want To Be Inspired
[43:30] of God to do that
[43:31] amen we led by God to do that but if you
[43:35] get a revelation from God you can do
[43:37] that amen
[43:39] probably you know I need to step out I
[43:42] need to just step out and say I believe
[43:43] I'm healed amen just like this diabetes
[43:46] diabetes the devil tries to put on me
[43:48] and stuff and amen and uh you know by
[43:51] God's grace I don't have to take any
[43:52] minute once in a while I will if I eat
[43:54] too much like the wrong thing but I'm
[43:56] believing it's going to get better and
[43:57] better and better and better I'm not
[43:59] looking to just have to do this all my
[44:00] life amen if you don't expect better and
[44:03] different it's never going to be in it
[44:06] so thank you brother Tommy and man God
[44:08] bless you this morning let's stand amen
[44:11] and we'll sing to this missile something
[44:13] oh look
[44:18] I thought it's been good to me now to
[44:20] the Lord isn't it we already encouraged
[44:23] right we already got some from the Lord
[44:26] and I really wanted to do in one service
[44:28] but we're just going to put it in
[44:30] whatever gear one system uh God wants to
[44:33] put it and go uh as long as God wants us
[44:37] to go on this I mean I highly doubt that
[44:40] I can get through with it tonight or
[44:42] just today and then maybe Wednesday and
[44:44] then if it goes longer than that that's
[44:46] fine too amen
[44:48] but uh something that I've wanted to
[44:51] speak on for a few weeks and I've got
[44:52] something else I've been wanting to
[44:54] speak on for a little while and just
[44:55] waiting for the inspiration to do so
[44:58] amen and just the right time I guess
[45:00] waiting on the Lord but this morning I
[45:02] want to take this one thought amen and
[45:05] uh see if the Lord won't just help me to
[45:08] try to bring this to you as I feel the
[45:10] Lord has given it to me amen and I
[45:13] thought about titling this I thought
[45:15] about titling this but patient and
[45:17] subtraction
[45:18] amen
[45:20] but hey man we're going to title title
[45:23] it a little bit something different and
[45:24] call it for you Lord Jesus and once
[45:26] again Lord grateful Lord Jesus to be in
[45:28] your presence Lord and to be at the
[45:30] house of God father to lay aside all the
[45:33] cares of Life Lord and no worry the
[45:35] different things we have to forget about
[45:37] during the week sometimes Lord and just
[45:39] to gather together with your children
[45:40] father we would desire God that you'll
[45:43] have your way into service father help
[45:45] us Lord to be completely surrendered to
[45:47] you so that you can say what you once
[45:49] said father to your people let the
[45:51] spirit
[45:51] speak to the people this morning Father
[45:55] we ask God that Jesus bless every
[45:57] portion of the service now in the name
[45:58] of Jesus Christ amen and amen I want to
[46:02] say it's good to see you brother and
[46:03] sister Martha back again I know they
[46:05] would go on vacation different things
[46:06] amen and brother Troy it's Robin good to
[46:09] see them amen we had to reread
[46:11] introduced this morning brother David
[46:12] did you know
[46:14] but anyways it's good to see them get to
[46:17] have them back and get to see the house
[46:18] full this morning and everybody in amen
[46:21] it's always good I think in this week
[46:23] it's always good to see you sitting in
[46:26] your place amen
[46:28] amen me in my place and then the Lord to
[46:31] come down and shape his molars into his
[46:33] image and what he wants amen and I'm
[46:35] certainly do thank you for your prayers
[46:38] amen for I covet your prayers and for
[46:40] the leadership of the Holy Spirit to
[46:42] lead us and guide us we know we're in a
[46:44] very late hour isn't it right we believe
[46:46] there is rapturing faith in this message
[46:48] amen and we know that God's going to be
[46:51] doing something in our age in our time
[46:52] God's going to be doing something amen
[46:54] and I believe it's going to be getting
[46:56] us ready for his coming amen as that
[46:59] time draws close
[47:01] amen and so I call it the chain of our
[47:04] character but you remember to quote but
[47:07] I'm made about a chain being its
[47:10] strongest at its weakest link
[47:12] amen
[47:13] so we want to speak about that a little
[47:16] bit we want to talk about that weak link
[47:18] but first we want to talk about also we
[47:20] want to talk about the links amen would
[47:22] that be all right we want to look at the
[47:24] links and then we want to see if they
[47:25] have any weak links amen and I certainly
[47:28] believe that it'd be a time when we
[47:30] could repeat what brother bam said about
[47:31] the reason that we come together to get
[47:34] together is not to see our strong places
[47:36] but to see our bad places is that right
[47:38] and to see where we can get closer to
[47:40] God and where we can change a little
[47:41] amen
[47:42] amen so I appreciate that brother Tommy
[47:45] amen certainly appreciate his faith in
[47:47] the Lord if you will
[47:49] uh
[47:51] turn to Second Peter
[47:54] second Peter
[48:00] like I said we could take a sermon on
[48:02] those three thoughts on addition
[48:03] multiplication and subtraction amen
[48:06] because how many knows that it is this
[48:09] life
[48:10] is like going to school
[48:13] amen we're being taught something we're
[48:15] being tutored by a teacher isn't that
[48:17] right amen we have to graduate you know
[48:21] how many believe that we got to graduate
[48:22] we've got to come to the place that we
[48:24] congratulate amen and be ready for what
[48:27] lays amen and getting this ready for the
[48:30] Millennium uh and to be with the Lord
[48:32] Jesus Christ throughout all eternity
[48:35] amen
[48:37] so these links are found if you want to
[48:40] turn to First Peter 1.
[48:43] Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of
[48:46] Jesus Christ to them who have obtained
[48:49] like Precious Faith like you know God
[48:51] loves multiplication he loves addition
[48:55] but he don't tax that out of your life
[48:58] and pretty soon your backslid why
[49:01] because the Devil he's the one master of
[49:04] subtraction but there is some things
[49:05] that we need to need to subtract out of
[49:08] our lives and found in Hebrews where it
[49:10] says lay side every way amen any beliefs
[49:12] we need to lay aside those there's
[49:14] things we need to get rid of Amen get
[49:16] out of here Grace and peace be
[49:18] multiplied unto you through the
[49:20] knowledge of God I like that as you know
[49:24] God and as you get more knowledge in God
[49:26] grace and peace is to be multiplied to
[49:29] you I like that amen verse 3 according
[49:33] as his divine power has given unto glory
[49:35] and virtue and whereby are given done to
[49:38] us exceeding great and precious promises
[49:41] and that by these you might be partakers
[49:44] of the divine nature having escaped the
[49:48] corruption that is in the world through
[49:52] lust amen we'll stop there and let you
[49:54] be seated because I want to just amen
[49:57] pick up on this for just a minute
[50:00] with the help of the Lord amen
[50:02] I mean how many loves the Lord this
[50:04] morning
[50:05] amen God is certainly good and I just
[50:09] will do so when we get in a hurry he
[50:11] says then you'll just ruin the things
[50:13] that you're going to say amen I believe
[50:16] we need to slow down just a little bit
[50:18] amen
[50:20] [Music]
[50:28] how many believe you gotta preach under
[50:30] inspiration be directed by the Holy
[50:32] Spirit and say that we have
[50:36] already of many heard many times but
[50:38] I've just
[50:40] quite a bit I mean a few uh Sunday
[50:43] Sundays to go when we spoke on 20 going
[50:46] forward man he calls it a teaching
[50:48] message and it is kind of you know you
[50:51] know but he goes in these talks about
[50:52] escaping the corruptionist in the world
[50:55] Amen taking us out of the corruption
[50:57] that is in the worlds and besides this
[50:59] because
[51:01] um this has to do this is who God made
[51:05] you because if not you're going to find
[51:07] yourself manufacturing something we're
[51:09] not here to manufacture anything
[51:13] aren't you glad
[51:16] you don't have to be a
[51:18] fake
[51:19] amen coming to the church and feel like
[51:22] you're a hypocrite
[51:23] another because we realized
[51:26] he said you know that perishes the
[51:29] golden God is that Christ's life came we
[51:32] came into the world
[51:34] but naked spiritually we we're not going
[51:38] to leave me you're gonna take something
[51:42] with you amen I mean the character of
[51:45] Christ but even the unbelievable the
[51:48] same as he came
[51:49] when he is he leaves either with uh we
[51:52] as a Christian leave with Christ but all
[51:54] a sinner goes with a whole pile of
[51:57] on him
[51:59] they had a funeral because you're not
[52:01] necessarily caring about how much money
[52:03] that person made how rich they are just
[52:05] think about when they look down at your
[52:07] face they're looking about who you are
[52:09] what
[52:14] that's what we're here for this morning
[52:16] we want to look at what our week
[52:19] because he said and I've got a quote
[52:22] here let me just they're listening ear
[52:27] a chain is its strongest at its weakest
[52:33] oh my may God search us out this morning
[52:51] this morning as I said that no doubt you
[52:54] person had a weak link because what
[52:57] happened

[53:16] are built up if you've got a week so
[53:19] we're gonna start with the help of the
[53:21] Lord let's just start with the first one
[53:23] because realize that the first one that
[53:25] he talks about he says give all
[53:27] diligence
[53:28] now

[53:31] let me go ahead a little bit Tarzan
[53:33] would that be okay there's tens it says
[53:35] where for the rather Brethren give
[53:39] sure for if ye do these things ye shall
[53:44] never fall

[54:00] huh is that baby popular people they're
[54:02] not supposed to fall that was the
[54:04] devil's there to trip you up

[54:16] strengthen that
[54:17] because we all need to be stronger how
[54:19] many is with me
[54:21] be Overcomers

[54:26] that but all the best played on pause
[54:28] and Ephesians but that was you in the
[54:30] morning
[54:34] to do with you because the public God
[54:36] said what
[54:38] I'm glad that a man can live so close to
[54:40] God that
[54:41] to do with you and he knows what your
[54:44] weak link is oh
[54:45] more than you know
[54:48] every time you get to go and as a
[54:50] spiritual Christian if you've got a
[54:51] shortcoming a failure somewhere and used
[54:53] to pull all the devil will abuse you
[54:55] he'll tell you look at y'all weak you
[54:56] know and you'll be there and you'll
[54:58] moping yourself and your depression
[55:02] come on people be honest
[55:09] so Lord help us
[55:11] amen
[55:14] my my
[55:17] foreign
[55:22] again
[55:26] lust for money lust for big things Lust
[55:28] For popularity things prevent to the
[55:31] believer
[55:33] we don't care a tent or a cottage squash
[55:36] I can't live or die sink or drown
[55:41] I mean uh somebody that throws their
[55:43] pills somebody like by the man I'm gonna
[55:45] eat this I don't care if he killed me he
[55:47] didn't give me left he didn't care not
[55:49] gonna take all of these words
[55:53] all right
[55:55] never die say this one that's just fine
[56:00] even brother man's mother died so don't
[56:04] eat that bill
[56:05] I guess the doctor said he's gonna kill
[56:07] him
[56:09] he throwing it up
[56:12] load it up
[56:15] let me let me let me as a pastor Pro
[56:17] evangelist God speaking to you about
[56:19] things you'll never get real victory
[56:21] that it's just a mental it's just an
[56:23] intellectual understanding but the
[56:26] prophet of God says if that's all you've
[56:28] got to go with that
[56:30] repeat it repeat it repeat it repeat it
[56:33] until it becomes a revelation to it amen
[56:38] and on it that's the only way you'll
[56:39] ever get anything from God
[56:42] so he says here all indeed thanks
[56:46] around this is the thing yes let me
[56:50] maintain him of Glory I may believe God
[56:54] 's goal his ambition was I don't care
[56:57] family likes my home likes my my farm
[57:00] likes my this that the other but I don't
[57:02] want Christ to lock in my life
[57:04] he had an impatient he wanted to make
[57:07] sure that Christ was the preeminent one
[57:09] preeminent one in his life how are we
[57:11] that he was with me this morning
[57:13] I'll tell you this right now I believe
[57:15] that this is what causes Us in cool mold
[57:17] as the shape us
[57:19] into being
[57:21] the Rapture because that's really all
[57:23] what we're really concerned about this
[57:24] morning is to be ready it's hard but
[57:27] we're dumber than we ever were
[57:31] I mean come on we don't know what he was
[57:33] when we got I was going to say it people
[57:36] on the Supreme Court and everything else
[57:37] they asked well what is the woman for I
[57:40] don't know
[57:43] if you don't know what a man and woman
[57:45] is
[57:46] you're not very smart
[57:50] whatever knowledge you claim to have it
[57:52] ain't very smart why because the devil's
[57:54] knowledge is is stupidity only one real
[57:58] knowledge and that's a knowledge of the
[58:00] Lord
[58:01] amen
[58:03] anyway that's just a little touch of
[58:05] knowledge
[58:08] anyway
[58:09] s
[58:11] that's right whether I mean any of that
[58:13] oh my
[58:15] God let Christ's virtue his knowledge
[58:17] flow out that I'm not be able to teach
[58:19] those for God has set an attraction to
[58:22] the coming of the Lord
[58:25] praise be to God
[58:27] now notice I even Peter said that these
[58:30] things be in you and about how they'll
[58:32] make you that you're neither unfruitful
[58:34] nor and
[58:36] God you gotta have these things
[58:41] how many believes it
[58:43] we got to happen
[58:45] give all diligence
[58:49] to you your favor Faith virtue now
[58:51] notice the first thing of course we
[58:53] realize faith can we talk about that for
[58:56] just a minute I'm gonna believe that
[58:57] without faith it's impossible to please
[58:59] God
[59:01] I'll even be born again without faith it
[59:04] takes believing God's word for you to
[59:06] get a new birth
[59:10] that's right without so forth It's the
[59:13] evidence of Things Not Seen and without
[59:15] faith it's impossible to please him for
[59:17] you to cometh to God must believe that
[59:19] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[59:22] that diligently seek him we realize that
[59:25] the elders obtained again depart through
[59:27] faith and through faith we understand
[59:29] that the worlds were framed by the word
[59:31] of God
[59:33] there is nothing as powerful as God
[59:37] revealing something to you
[59:41] that's faith
[59:43] how many notes but I've said that faith
[59:45] is a revelation it's something that God
[59:47] quickens to you you can take those pills
[59:50] and you can dump them out you can call
[59:51] them and laugh in the doctor's face if
[59:53] he tells you he's going back
[59:55] if you really have a revelation from God
[59:58] that
[59:59] you're gonna live you want Faith it's
[1:00:02] the very Foundation of Christianity
[1:00:05] it's a foundation I notice here that
[1:00:08] he's only the foundation it's on the
[1:00:10] very bottom it's like the footer of the
[1:00:12] house everybody says it's not a
[1:00:14] Pentecost amen and the faith of God to
[1:00:16] do a work and get out too oh I got it he
[1:00:19] said you ain't got nothing you just got
[1:00:20] started
[1:00:24] and God wants to build all these things
[1:00:25] into US faith
[1:00:27] that our Elder said I want the faith
[1:00:29] that Abraham had you got to have that
[1:00:32] and I do believe that I have it and I do
[1:00:34] not be
[1:00:35] all right
[1:00:49] he loved him just
[1:00:51] more
[1:01:00] to uh
[1:01:04] find it here now we've escaped investing
[1:01:07] this to the church now that's why we are
[1:01:09] here this morning is to find out what
[1:01:10] that way is what is God's requirements
[1:01:13] there's not a person in here that look
[1:01:18] loves God
[1:01:21] but what once
[1:01:23] more like
[1:01:25] Christ
[1:01:28] and you might be
[1:01:30] like Christ
[1:01:32] I am UAV but yet there's you still have
[1:01:36] someone to be in you
[1:01:37] I want to be more like him isn't that
[1:01:39] right
[1:01:40] she says no matter how Christian how
[1:01:42] much you love God you still want to be
[1:01:44] more like Christ and he's laid it out of
[1:01:46] every Christian he says I'm an old
[1:01:48] veteran
[1:01:51] and since your kid here they're probably
[1:01:53] the oldest in the building but if I'd
[1:01:55] ask them what is your
[1:01:58] emergency fire that seem to be closer to
[1:02:01] God
[1:02:02] to be more like him
[1:02:06] yeah when you yearn for Christ there's
[1:02:09] something about it
[1:02:12] amen how many believe that this morning
[1:02:15] it hurts his eye even the brother Joe's
[1:02:17] prayer Lord give us the mind of Christ
[1:02:19] we want to see more like him I may
[1:02:21] believe you're not only can sing like
[1:02:23] him but you got a life like him you can
[1:02:25] have faith to get me like
[1:02:27] yep
[1:02:29] oh my
[1:02:31] God oh praise be to God but as brothers
[1:02:33] calls us we're all just a bunch of
[1:02:36] Sinners born and sin-shaped iniquity
[1:02:39] that kind of condition and that we
[1:02:41] ourselves can prostrate ourselves give
[1:02:43] some not had life out and put Christ's
[1:02:46] life in
[1:02:50] take amen our old Thomas Fowler you
[1:02:53] yourself take yourself out and put God
[1:02:55] in the works that I understand you do
[1:02:57] also don't you have a yearning to see
[1:02:59] that manifest that's them all amen he
[1:03:02] was gonna be a
[1:03:04] burning up learning and I saw to be more
[1:03:07] like him
[1:03:08] less of ourselves and more of him I'm
[1:03:11] gonna see him every day in my life don't
[1:03:13] you every hour than me
[1:03:17] because there's still too much
[1:03:20] or take that transfusion and that's what
[1:03:22] we are
[1:03:23] Amen Let the Lord get you in the good
[1:03:26] old IV right in here all right and
[1:03:29] another one over here where it goes out
[1:03:30] at and get that other old life out and
[1:03:33] put his life on the inside that's what
[1:03:35] we come to church for is to get the
[1:03:37] blood and praise the Lord
[1:03:39] Hallelujah
[1:03:41] Hallelujah
[1:03:42] wisdom patience and all that whenever
[1:03:45] Jerry brat Bell
[1:03:48] preached on this
[1:03:49] 30 some years ago I remember when he did
[1:03:52] I remember when he brought these quotes
[1:03:54] up isn't that right
[1:04:01] he's long gone out life is scattered
[1:04:04] into the Four Winds and everything else
[1:04:06] sad isn't it
[1:04:08] amen
[1:04:10] the devil wants to try to hurt your
[1:04:11] faith by that but it does not a real
[1:04:13] believer
[1:04:14] amen do not go with me yet still will I
[1:04:16] follow
[1:04:18] amen but so he listens to have people
[1:04:21] have a certain part
[1:04:24] does you have you have so many links
[1:04:27] aren't even filled you may be strong in
[1:04:29] one part but you're never going to be
[1:04:31] sure
[1:04:33] just because you're naturally nice
[1:04:35] and kind
[1:04:37] of was it real quick he talks about it
[1:04:38] it's uh you know like putting uh he says
[1:04:41] if you're back where he only displaces
[1:04:43] himself he says better stay a blackbird
[1:04:45] he says when he tries to
[1:04:48] question he just simply all out of and
[1:04:52] I'm gonna say it again
[1:04:54] when we don't possess the things that we
[1:04:55] confess we are nothing but a big stomach
[1:04:59] everybody said to everybody else doubt
[1:05:03] by either believing God
[1:05:06] and that is I noticed even the better
[1:05:08] Bible says you know what the thing that
[1:05:10] we're going to take is take with us is
[1:05:12] what we are I am late so when you get
[1:05:15] over there you're gonna take great faith
[1:05:17] with you you're going to take virtue
[1:05:19] with you you're going to take God's
[1:05:21] knowledge with her had a capsule of
[1:05:23] perfect love
[1:05:25] that's the character of the believer
[1:05:29] I mean I was the same way with the fruit
[1:05:31] of the spirit love
[1:05:33] Joy foolish
[1:05:36] amen
[1:05:40] I just want to say this morning I
[1:05:42] believe that it is time for us to
[1:05:44] strengthen
[1:05:45] that weak link
[1:05:48] that weak link that place where you're
[1:05:50] not where you ought to be
[1:05:52] you can only do that through prayer and
[1:05:54] belief in stepping out off the boat and
[1:05:56] saying I believe God's going to take it
[1:05:57] from me I believe God's going to give me
[1:05:59] a power he's going to give me power to
[1:06:02] take back the time that it takes for me
[1:06:05] to pray because
[1:06:06] the devil had robbed me of it
[1:06:09] huh maybe you don't love the Lord like
[1:06:12] you used to that's your warning more
[1:06:14] than you ever have or less
[1:06:16] I mean believe this
[1:06:17] is
[1:06:20] but that's about it me I'm about you
[1:06:22] don't need a college degree
[1:06:25] he didn't
[1:06:27] it's all what you said to your mind too
[1:06:29] much love to work if you want to get
[1:06:31] into your life anything or you better
[1:06:33] work
[1:06:34] huh would you be lazy
[1:06:38] uh that look that's part of the
[1:06:40] character
[1:06:41] isn't it
[1:06:42] I think that you think about the things
[1:06:44] that you get Domino
[1:06:46] wait
[1:06:47] that's what builds it
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:50] praise be to God
[1:06:53] first find I want you to understand that
[1:06:56] just is one thing
[1:06:58] just this one thing called faith is
[1:07:01] something that has to be
[1:07:03] aren't you glad that
[1:07:06] you talk about Supreme
[1:07:09] it was uh
[1:07:13] because if you don't
[1:07:15] you'll only have an intellectual and if
[1:07:17] that's all it ever is all it ever stays
[1:07:19] huh when God said come on up here I want
[1:07:22] to show you I want to have a
[1:07:23] conversation with you
[1:07:24] you talk about nothing Paul was the
[1:07:27] opposite he was minus he wasn't E minor
[1:07:29] said Paul Paul ourselves forever
[1:07:39] Tommy's experiencing the jailhouse
[1:07:41] you'll never forget that personal
[1:07:42] experiences you forever
[1:07:44] didn't even brother bam says you know
[1:07:45] once you meet Jesus you'll
[1:07:47] never be the same
[1:07:50] and there goes both ways it was with the
[1:07:52] Rich Young Ruler remember he came into
[1:07:54] contact with Jesus he was never to see
[1:07:56] me he got richer and bigger barns but
[1:07:58] his soul was found in hell it was never

[1:22:34] the Capstone
[1:22:35] capping of it all which is God
[1:22:38] himself but he said he had little lines
[1:22:42] drawn all all down through here because
[1:22:46] if you're gonna ever uh

[1:23:19] scriptures as well if you can't see it
[1:23:21] we don't talk about this

[1:24:28] important whether any is the kind of
[1:24:29] character he had so when he preached
[1:24:31] that he knew what he was talking about
[1:24:33] last Friday with his father for our sins
[1:24:35] and our failures Lord Jesus when we're
[1:24:37] still not on fire like we should be and
