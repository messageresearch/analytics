[41:47] destroy that would kill Lord and father
[41:50] to be knowing that our lives are secured
[41:52] back with you father and we thank you

[41:56] sister Perry in a special way that you

[42:00] Lord Jesus from this operation she's had
[42:03] father and give her strength for her

[42:12] we know that every moment and every hour
[42:15] every week every month and every year of
[42:17] our time your children and I we believe
[42:20] God that each step and each moment is
[42:22] ordained of the Lord so tonight as we
[42:25] have assembled ourselves together we ask
[42:27] God that you'll have your way and father
[42:29] that each one of your children would go
[42:30] out here fed and better than what they
[42:32] came in Lord we give you the praise and
[42:34] the honor glory Lord in the name of
[42:37] Jesus Christ amen and everybody said
[42:41] amen turn your bibles if you will to
[42:42] First Corinthians 7 1 Corinthians 7 this
[42:45] is going to be a uh I guess a message I
[42:48] hadn't preached before so
[42:51] amen not in this this way anyway amen
[42:59] all right test test test okay I think
[43:02] that's got it I may have hit my other
[43:04] button here a little bit amen 1
[43:07] Corinthians
[43:09] 7 and
[43:12] verse 22 to
[43:16] 32 but I would have you without
[43:19] carefulness he that is unmar car carth
[43:23] for the things that belong to the Lord
[43:25] how that he may please the Lord but he
[43:27] that is married carth for the things
[43:29] that are of the world how he may please
[43:32] his wife first
[43:38] Peter first Peter
[43:51] 5 verse six humble yourselves therefore
[43:54] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[43:56] EX you in due due time casting all your
[43:59] cares upon Him for he carth for you be
[44:02] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[44:05] the Devil is a as a roaring lion walketh
[44:08] about seeking whom he may devour may God
[44:11] add His blessings to reading of the
[44:12] words you can be seated tonight my title
[44:15] is this amen do we have
[44:18] it all right caring for what you love
[44:25] amen caring for what you
[44:29] love amen praise the Lord and I was
[44:34] originally felt led to preach on uh out
[44:37] of the message he cares do you care but
[44:41] it kind of took a little turn on me but
[44:43] we'll still kind of uh dwell on that for
[44:45] a little bit with the help of the Lord
[44:47] but uh it has it's kind of went to that
[44:50] title caring for what for what you love
[44:53] because if you'll notice here and uh in
[44:57] in Corinthians there where he's talking
[44:58] about the wife and the husband you know
[45:01] an unmarried person cares for the things
[45:04] of the Lord how that he may please God
[45:07] ain't that right why because he loves
[45:09] God right it's not all that hard to
[45:14] do amen how many knows it's not hard to
[45:17] care for what you
[45:21] love amen it's just basically a Instinct
[45:24] it's should I say it this way it's what
[45:27] you're going to
[45:28] do amen you're going to care for what
[45:33] you love amen and so if you have a wife
[45:37] the Bible says here he that is married
[45:40] is going to care for the things of the
[45:43] world Amen how that he may please his
[45:49] wife amen wouldn't it be the same vice
[45:52] versa if you're married and you love
[45:54] your husband don't you wife see how you
[45:57] can please your
[46:00] husband Welly that's really quiet right
[46:05] [Laughter]
[46:08] there amen that's right and you know
[46:11] it's that same way with God first I want
[46:14] to say this how many knows that God
[46:16] cares for us now Peter he sat there
[46:19] casting all your cares upon him because
[46:22] he
[46:23] what he cares for for
[46:27] you amen what was it where could I go I
[46:30] think the first song you all say where
[46:32] could I go or where could I go needing a
[46:34] refuge for my soul needing a friend to
[46:37] help me in the End Amen Comfort we get
[46:40] from God's Own word so we get comfort
[46:43] from God Amen God is our friend where
[46:46] could you go to get cared for we as
[46:50] human beings have one basic one of the
[46:53] basic necessities that we have and
[46:55] people will go through through great
[46:57] measures to try to get and that is
[47:00] comfort care and
[47:03] joy comfort and joy and remember when
[47:06] the Angels Came they brought great
[47:08] Tidings of Comfort and Joy and even
[47:11] Jesus said amen I will not leave you
[47:13] comfortless I will come to you because
[47:15] Jesus know that you need comfort ain't
[47:19] that right amen and you need comfort
[47:22] just as a wife Comforts her husband or
[47:25] husband Comforts his wife and and to
[47:27] comfort one another they take care of
[47:30] each
[47:31] other Amen brother Braham said you know
[47:34] take a little child amen I believe it
[47:35] was somewhere he says you know some of
[47:37] these mothers that don't believe in
[47:38] picking their babies up and so let them
[47:40] cry let them cry and he said grow up to
[47:42] be
[47:43] gangsters why because them gangs give
[47:46] them
[47:47] care they stick together hey you're part
[47:50] of us now you know ain't nobody going to
[47:52] touch you it's all for one and one for
[47:54] all and people have that basic need need
[47:57] to have people to care for them how many
[47:59] in here like to be cared
[48:02] for none of
[48:06] you yeah every one of us loves to be
[48:10] loved we all love when somebody shows a
[48:13] little care we all love when somebody
[48:16] sends us a text amen when you give a
[48:18] call and it's almost gotten to the place
[48:20] to where we thank people when they care
[48:22] about it we say well thank you brother
[48:24] for caring
[48:27] that's right that's about how it is
[48:29] because we appreciate when somebody
[48:31] cares for us aren't you glad that you
[48:33] serve a God I serve a God that
[48:35] absolutely cares about us in other words
[48:38] another place Jesus said don't worry
[48:40] about your clothes and what you're going
[48:41] to eat your food or Raymond take no
[48:43] thought for you Raymond he says for your
[48:45] heavenly father knows that you have need
[48:47] of these things and he cares for
[48:50] you am mean all he ask is that you might
[48:53] may be cared back ain't that right the
[48:57] kingdom of God first and his
[48:58] righteousness and all these things I
[49:00] know you have need of them how many
[49:02] believe you God cares about us more inly
[49:06] inly something like that amen than what
[49:09] you can
[49:10] imagine is that
[49:12] right sometimes maybe we think that we
[49:15] care more about God than God cares about
[49:21] us well I'll tell you what I don't know
[49:23] how I'm going to pay my bills I don't
[49:25] know how I'm going to get through this

[49:30] Sunday and I I do all this and I'm
[49:32] telling you what I'm just kind of
[49:35] downcast maybe I care more about God and
[49:38] God does me no you no don't never think
[49:40] that no God
[49:44] cares amen that's my message tonight God
[49:48] cares and if he cares amen first he
[49:53] loves he loves you and if he loves you
[49:56] he he cares for you he cares about your
[50:00] cares what did he say come unto me all
[50:04] ye who are weary and heavy
[50:06] laden amen and I will give you rest for
[50:10] your souls amen so if you're heavy laden
[50:13] if your cat cares amen and so forth he
[50:15] says just come to Christ cast all of
[50:18] your needs and desires and wants on him
[50:21] he will supply you with what you have
[50:23] need
[50:24] of but you got to care about the
[50:28] carer the caregiver should I say instead
[50:31] of the carer probably ain't in the
[50:34] dictionary amen but that's what happens
[50:35] when you got an eighth grade Pastor
[50:38] amen amen so think about the
[50:41] caregiver is amen just saying come unto
[50:45] me and I will give you
[50:48] rest aren't you glad for that
[50:51] tonight praise the
[50:53] Lord God is good isn't he I got to
[50:57] thinking you know doesn't matter what it
[51:00] is amen if you've got a wife you got
[51:03] children you got a family and you think
[51:05] about these moms with their little
[51:07] babies around here how much care that

[51:12] fellas
[51:14] lots and lots 1:00 2 o00 3 o00 4:00 5 o'
[51:20] care ain't that right all three ton
[51:23] night all during the day it don't matter
[51:27] oh my what's wrong let me get over there
[51:29] and see what's wrong with it you don't
[51:30] try to care for it why because you love
[51:33] it amen oh boy here you go he put the
[51:37] thought in my mind I might as well say
[51:39] it what about us husbands and wives amen
[51:42] we could all say hey I could do a better
[51:44] job of caring about my wife when she
[51:46] gets Snappy and grow and amen because
[51:48] something I didn't do or I needed to do
[51:50] amen we just think oh you just take care
[51:52] of it yourself no maybe if we care a
[51:54] little more maybe our marriage just
[51:56] would be a little bit a
[51:59] better yeah care one for another I
[52:03] guarantee he'd be
[52:05] better praise the
[52:07] Lord hey you I'm I'm the first one to
[52:10] say guilty here
[52:12] guilty that's right I need to care
[52:15] more that's right today today you know
[52:20] today uh uh she covering her face
[52:24] already you know she had uh uh she's
[52:27] been down in her back a little bit for a
[52:29] few days and it's much better now but

[53:08] right how many know that's that's the
[53:10] way God is with you and me those little
[53:12] things amen I believe that if we would
[53:15] have our ears open more to what the Lord

[53:20] know that he cares for us in a greater
[53:23] way than what we do just going through

[56:36] on me and there was these two little
[56:38] swivel chairs and that I can put in my
[56:40] hunting house and it cost a pretty good
[56:43] bit but I'm tired of squeaking my chairs
[56:45] and barely getting up out of my chair

[56:48] I got me a couple of good chairs and we
[56:50] checked out and amen and give her give

[1:07:36] imagine no
[1:07:38] wonder people want to touch brother
[1:07:40] bram's coat tail or grab him or whatever
[1:07:42] it might be because Jesus would use him
[1:07:45] and they would get their
[1:07:47] healing and they were
[1:07:50] grateful even to the vessel that God
[1:07:52] used and brought it through ain't that
[1:07:54] right

[1:08:06] chance he come and he wanted a chance
[1:08:08] what can I do to inherit eternal
[1:08:12] life isn't it something that he wanted
[1:08:16] to do
[1:08:17] something he wanted to do
[1:08:20] something and Jesus said all right you
[1:08:22] want to do something keep all the
[1:08:23] Commandments Thou shalt not Thou shalt
[1:08:24] not Thou shalt not this boy was a good
[1:08:28] boy he said all these things have I done
[1:08:31] from my
[1:08:32] youth imagine talking to Jesus telling
[1:08:35] them I've done all these things most of
[1:08:37] us be
[1:08:39] lying that's right but he could say I've
[1:08:42] done all these things and Jesus said n
[1:08:43] no don't you be lying to me boy he never
[1:08:46] refuted it he was a good
[1:08:48] boy ain't that right but he wanted to do
[1:08:51] something now Jesus could have said well
[1:08:53] believe on me
[1:08:56] Ain that right believe on
[1:08:58] me but since he wanted to do something
[1:09:00] he gave him something to
[1:09:02] do he he knew what his weakness was that
[1:09:06] right he knew what his weakness was and
[1:09:07] that was
[1:09:09] riches riches was his weakness God help
[1:09:13] us don't let Rich just be your
[1:09:16] weakness don't you love money and riches
[1:09:21] don't you care about riches and money
[1:09:23] more than you care about Christ
[1:09:27] CU that's what most people do how manyan
[1:09:30] know we're living in a world that has a
[1:09:32] lot of
[1:09:33] love we're living in a world full of
[1:09:36] love even though the Bible says the love
[1:09:37] of many wood rcks cold there's still a
[1:09:39] lot of love going
[1:09:43] around perilous time shall come for men
[1:09:46] shall be
[1:09:48] lovers they're going to be lovers of
[1:09:52] themselves ain't that right
[1:09:55] everything anything that benefits
[1:10:00] me that's
[1:10:02] right amen but eternal life is living
[1:10:04] for others not about
[1:10:06] you but we certainly are living in a
[1:10:08] world of lovers of themselves caring
[1:10:11] about
[1:10:13] themselves and we're not to do that amen
[1:10:15] we're to care for others
[1:10:19] amen think look at a few of them Rich
[1:10:23] Young Ruler he cared and he said
[1:10:26] go and sell all that you
[1:10:29] got not
[1:10:31] 50% not this that or the other I think
[1:10:35] uh zakas or some of them offered to pay
[1:10:37] back Sevenfold whatever they had done
[1:10:39] wrong this that or the other think think
[1:10:42] about set setting your own terms brother
[1:10:44] Tommy he they you know said I'll pay him
[1:10:47] Sevenfold whatever I've RI somebody off
[1:10:50] he could have said two three four but he
[1:10:52] said seven they set their own terms then
[1:10:55] they had to be you know make it
[1:11:00] good there's two ways of looking at that
[1:11:03] brother bread one of isn't that he was
[1:11:06] crooked and he needs to make him some
[1:11:07] right the other way to look at he wasn't
[1:11:10] crooked so he could say I'll give him 10
[1:11:13] time I'll give him 20 times every time
[1:11:15] because I know I ain't RI nobody off
[1:11:18] huh so I don't know all I know is he was
[1:11:22] going to be right about it he's going to
[1:11:24] do right and Jesus
[1:11:25] new
[1:11:29] amen all
[1:11:31] right but the Rich Young Ruler God asked
[1:11:34] him to give it all give it all away what
[1:11:38] did he do he
[1:11:40] cared or loved his
[1:11:43] riches more than eternal

[1:15:32] denominational church or as a deacon I

[1:15:43] popularity they love their pride more
[1:15:45] than they love
[1:15:48] God my my
[1:15:51] mind the bottom line is
[1:15:55] we can't
[1:15:56] criticize these swine
[1:15:59] men for wanting Jesus not to have a
[1:16:02] Revival there because they loved money
[1:16:05] more than they loved Jesus if we love
[1:16:08] money more than we love Jesus
[1:16:12] amen I don't think anybody here does but
[1:16:15] maybe somebody out there needs to hear

[1:16:59] than one chance look at Israel God loved
[1:17:02] Israel he gave him chance after chance
[1:17:06] after chance after
[1:17:09] chance but would you call when Moses
[1:17:12] went up there get the
[1:17:13] law he was up there a little while and
[1:17:16] they would got tired of
[1:17:18] waiting made him a golden calf and
[1:17:20] worshiped that calf and said this calf
