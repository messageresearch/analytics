[51:23] the way it is this morning. There ain't
[51:25] nothing we can't have this morning. If

[52:44] the house of the Lord. Amen. I feel like
[52:47] I woke up this morning and went outside
[52:49] and back by the back patio and just felt
[52:53] the big old breeze coming up out of that
[52:55] bluff and leaves blowing everywhere and
[52:58] the cold wind. And I says, "Well, f fall
[53:01] finally got here. It's about time. Where
[53:03] you been?" I feel like we're just really
[53:06] been introduced to fall this morning.
[53:08] So, praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[53:13] Usually, I'm in the woods by this time
[53:15] of the year quite a bit, but I haven't
[53:17] even gone out there yet, hardly at all.
[53:19] But maybe in the next week or two, I'm
[53:21] going to try to find time to go out
[53:22] there. Amen. Amen. I really need to
[53:25] climb a tree. I I feel the need to.
[53:27] Amen. Amen. And just watch those animals
[53:30] and watch the beautiful creation of God.
[53:32] Enjoy God's creation. Amen. God bless
[53:35] everybody this morning. Good to see
[53:36] everybody here this morning. Amen. We
[53:39] want to remember. Amen. Continue to
[53:41] remember. We're very thankful that some
[53:43] of us are feeling better. Amen. But
[53:45] Serenity and Haven and SA and Brother
[53:48] Joe and Sister Hannah, I guess they've
[53:50] really had a bad go around of it. Amen.
[53:53] And so whatever it is, it's causing a
[53:54] cough and it's certainly hanging on.
[53:57] Amen. Hangs on pretty long. So we just
[54:00] pray that the Lord will deliver. Amen.
[54:01] Especially Brother Joe and Sister
[54:03] Hannah. Amen. That he'll just live lift
[54:05] them up out of that. Amen. Amen. And so
[54:08] I hope everybody else feeling good.
[54:11] Amen. You're in church this morning, so
[54:12] I trust that. Amen. Amen. Everybody's
[54:15] feeling good. Good to see you. Good.
[54:17] Good to see you, brother Eduardo. And
[54:19] good to see you all this morning. Amen.
[54:21] So, praise the Lord. Just trying to get
[54:24] the feel of it. Amen. God bless you.
[54:26] Let's bow our heads, Lord Jesus, as we
[54:28] come before you, bowing, Lord, to the
[54:30] dust from where we was made, Lord. And
[54:32] father and also we look up in our
[54:35] spiritual eyesight to you Lord Jesus who
[54:37] has created us created the inner man the
[54:40] spiritual man our soul father and this
[54:42] morning Lord we want to feed that man
[54:44] Lord Jesus we're not so concerned about
[54:46] the natural man as we are about the
[54:48] spiritual man father so we ask God that
[54:51] you would just come in a special way
[54:53] Lord and Father you said somewhere in
[54:55] your word I believe it it's you said
[54:58] you'd make your ministers a flame of
[55:00] fire Lord and we certainly can't preach
[55:02] reach without your fire, Lord. So we
[55:04] ask, God, that the great Holy Spirit
[55:06] would just come, Lord, this morning and
[55:07] speak to our hearts, speak to our lives
[55:09] this morning, Lord Jesus, and and give
[55:11] us a timely message, Father. For we know
[55:14] that we're living in a late hour,
[55:16] Father, and and as your prophet, as we
[55:19] listen to a prophet, how that we can
[55:21] remember. How much had he said that it's
[55:24] later than you think? We're at the end
[55:26] time. It's the end. And how much he said
[55:28] that, Father? How much more is that does
[55:31] that apply to this morning Lord and
[55:33] where we are. So we ask God that is
[55:35] Father I feel you've laid a message on
[55:37] my heart to bring to the church. We ask
[55:39] God that you would help me Lord Jesus to
[55:41] get out of the way and that you might
[55:42] deliver what you have to say to the
[55:44] people Lord Jesus and that we would go
[55:46] from here a better Christian that we did
[55:49] when we came through those double doors.
[55:51] Father we believe that's possible God
[55:54] Lord Jesus and we didn't come here to
[55:56] stay neutral. We didn't come here to
[55:57] stay on the same place. But Lord, even
[56:00] as your prophet has taught us, we either
[56:02] leave better or we leave worse. Amen. So
[56:05] we ask God that we would all leave
[56:06] better. Lord, bless the meditation of
[56:09] our heart. Bless your word now as we're
[56:10] about to open your book. We know that it
[56:12] takes you to give us the true
[56:14] inspiration from it. For we ask it in
[56:16] Jesus' name. Amen. And amen.
[56:20] Amen. So my inspiration, this is going
[56:22] to be kind of different, but my
[56:24] inspiration Amen. this morning came
[56:26] from. Amen. Our fall theme. Our fall
[56:30] theme. Amen. And if you will put the
[56:32] title up. I titled this. Amen. Rapture
[56:36] ready checklist. Amen. But in reality, I
[56:40] kind of wanted to put up put up there
[56:42] rapture ready rodeo checklist.
[56:48] And I thought, wow, that that's
[56:50] different. Are you sure you want to do
[56:52] that? And I'm like, well, and I I kind
[56:54] of got away from it. And I said, "Well,
[56:56] Lord, if that's what you want, that's
[56:57] what we'll speak on." Amen. So, that's
[57:00] what I feel like we need to speak on.
[57:02] Amen. And we might mention rodeo a
[57:03] little bit. Amen. Because it's certainly
[57:05] a a spiritual application because Amen.
[57:08] We know that in a rodeo that there's all
[57:11] kinds of races. Ain't that right? Barrel
[57:14] races and bull fighting and all whatnot
[57:16] or bull riding. Some of in some cases
[57:19] maybe somebody get up there and get out
[57:21] there and try to stand in front of a
[57:22] bull or whatever. and and because of his
[57:25] because of his wits and so forth to have
[57:27] a charging bull come right at you with
[57:29] great big horns and to be able to leap
[57:32] up over top of him, you know, and he
[57:33] misses you or you know how they do. You
[57:35] just a little bit of a sweep and the
[57:38] bull runs right by and his horns just
[57:40] grazes him a little bit, you know, and I
[57:43] thought, you know, that's the way it is.
[57:44] And it's a competition for for who's the
[57:47] best or who can take down a calf the
[57:50] quickest.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. And I thought
[57:53] that's about the way it ought to be in
[57:54] the house of God. You know, it's
[57:56] wonderful when the devil comes by and he
[57:57] tries to gore you, you know, and puts
[57:59] thoughts in there and I mean, we're not
[58:01] the champion isn't the one that lets it
[58:03] go in his head and fights with it for
[58:05] two weeks. He's not the champion. But if
[58:07] this morning you can say just get on and
[58:09] buy me bird, let me take this shotgun,
[58:10] blow it out of the air. He's the winner.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So that's right. We
[58:14] can we can have winners. And Paul said,
[58:17] you know, we all run in this race. We're
[58:19] all in a race. Amen. And run in a race
[58:21] and so forth. But anyway, so
[58:24] [sighs]
[58:25] amen.
[58:27] The scripture we want to go to this
[58:29] morning. We want to read about two or
[58:31] three of them to start with. Amen.
[58:32] Because I have several and if I don't
[58:34] read them, I probably won't get to them.
[58:35] So, let's go first of all to Luke. No,
[58:39] let's go to Matthew first and then Luke.
[58:41] Matthew.
[58:43] Amen. And now, if you'll notice here,
[58:46] this these these words, Amen. that we
[58:48] want to speak on for a while. And and I
[58:51] honestly don't think that I'll get
[58:53] through by any means because we do want
[58:54] to have communion this morning. Amen.
[58:57] And there has been times when I would
[58:59] just quit studying because I knew if I
[59:01] would study more, we're just going to go
[59:03] long. Amen. And so we've got enough to
[59:06] last us a while. Amen. And it's cold
[59:08] outside, it's warm inside. You got nice
[59:11] padded pews. It's very comfortable.
[59:13] Right. And everybody's got your bacon
[59:16] and egg sandwich this morning. So you're
[59:18] good, right? Amen. It'd be a while
[59:20] before you get hungry and we only have
[59:22] one service today. So, we got to get
[59:24] crammed two in one. So, you know, we
[59:26] have every reason to not get in a hurry.
[59:28] Is that okay?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's not get in a hurry and
[59:31] just see what the Holy Spirit would have
[59:32] for us this morning. Amen.
[59:36] Amen. Amen. I'll tell you this right
[59:39] now. Amen. I believe we have more to
[59:40] preach about than we've ever had.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have we've got more material.
[59:45] We've got more uh things that we can
[59:48] just keep going and keep going and keep
[59:50] going with. Amen. And just really really
[59:54] have be able at the end of the service
[59:56] to be able to push back from the table
[59:58] and say, "Man, I just ate myself till
[1:00:01] I'm bloated and feel like a tick."
[1:00:05] So, let's let's hope that we are get
[1:00:08] real good and full this morning. Amen.
[1:00:10] Amen. God bless you. Amen. Let your soul
[1:00:14] delight itself in fatness, the Bible
[1:00:16] says. Amen. All right. Matthew
[1:00:22] 24. Matthew 24. A very familiar
[1:00:25] scripture. And we want to start with
[1:00:27] rapture. Amen. Then the next thought's
[1:00:30] going to be ready. Amen. And also we'll
[1:00:34] combine into that checklist. Amen. A
[1:00:37] checklist.
[1:00:39] Amen.
[1:00:45] Matthew 24
[1:00:47] and we'll begin with verse 32. Now learn
[1:00:50] the parable of the fig tree when his
[1:00:52] branch is yet tender and putteth forth
[1:00:54] his leaves. Ye know that summer is nigh.
[1:00:57] So likewise ye when ye shall see all
[1:00:59] these things know that it is near even
[1:01:02] at the doors. Amen. Verily, verily,
[1:01:05] verily, I say unto you, this generation
[1:01:07] shall not pass till all these things be
[1:01:09] fulfilled.
[1:01:11] Amen. How many knows the correct
[1:01:14] interpretation of that? The brother Ben
[1:01:16] Brandham talked about that that fig tree
[1:01:18] was Israel and he said that generation
[1:01:21] that sees, amen, the coming together of
[1:01:24] Israel, that generation would not die
[1:01:26] off until all these things will be
[1:01:30] fulfilled.
[1:01:31] So that is very very relevant to you and
[1:01:35] I isn't that right? Because we know that
[1:01:38] you know those who even those who were
[1:01:40] born let's say in in 1950
[1:01:44] um they're they're going to be like 50
[1:01:47] 75 years old already.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; That was maybe a a year or two after the
[1:01:53] birth. That's as a baby.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So how many knows it's getting
[1:01:58] close? How many believes the hour is
[1:02:01] late?
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; How many believes heaven and earth will
[1:02:03] pass away, but his word won't pass away?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; It's not going to fail.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; So you and I can count on it.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:13] But of the day and the hour knoweth no
[1:02:15] man, not the angels of heaven, but my
[1:02:17] father only. And but as the days of the
[1:02:19] Noah were, so also is the coming of the
[1:02:22] coming of the son of man be. Amen. For
[1:02:25] as in the days that were before the
[1:02:27] flood, they were eating and drinking,
[1:02:29] marrying and giving in marriage, until
[1:02:30] the day that Noah entered into the ark,
[1:02:33] and knew not until the flood came and
[1:02:35] took them all away, so shall also the
[1:02:36] coming of the son of man be. Two shall
[1:02:38] be in the field, the one shall be taken,
[1:02:40] the other one left. Two women shall be
[1:02:41] grinding at the mill, one shall be
[1:02:43] taken, and the other one left. Watch
[1:02:46] therefore, for ye know not what hour the
[1:02:48] Lord doth come. Amen. Amen. Brother Bram
[1:02:51] I in this uh second coming of the Lord
[1:02:54] 19570417
[1:02:57] preached on the second coming of the
[1:02:58] Lord he says you know in that book he
[1:03:00] says that in the last days of Jesus
[1:03:02] which was right here towards the end of
[1:03:04] Matthew you know even though he was
[1:03:06] going to go to Calvary and he was going
[1:03:07] to rise again but Ram said he talked
[1:03:09] more about his second coming than he did
[1:03:12] about his resurrection and going away.
[1:03:14] Amen. And so here's part of that. Amen.
[1:03:19] Two women shall be grinding at the mill.
[1:03:21] The one shall be taken and the other one
[1:03:22] left. Watch therefore, for you know not
[1:03:24] what hour the Lord doth come. But know
[1:03:26] this that if the goodman of the house
[1:03:28] would have known in what watch the thief
[1:03:30] would come, he would have watched and
[1:03:31] would not have suffered his house to be
[1:03:33] broken up. Be therefore be ye also
[1:03:37] ready. There's our other word in our
[1:03:39] Amen. uh title this morning. Ready. I
[1:03:42] like that. Amen. Rapture ready.
[1:03:47] Amen. For in such an hour as you think
[1:03:49] not, the son of man cometh. Who then is
[1:03:51] a faithful and wise? Amen. How many's
[1:03:53] interested in being a little bit smart?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Wise. We call it smarts. You know, let's
[1:03:59] be wise,
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; not unwise. Ain't that right? There's
[1:04:03] two categories of people here in the
[1:04:06] rapture. Amen. Those that are wise and
[1:04:08] the unwise. Amen.
[1:04:15] wise servant whom his lord hath made
[1:04:17] ruler over his household to give unto
[1:04:20] them meat in due season. Blessed is that
[1:04:23] servant whom his lord when he cometh
[1:04:25] shall find so doing. Verily I say unto
[1:04:28] you that he shall make him ruler over
[1:04:30] all his goods. But and if that evil
[1:04:33] servant shall say in his heart, my lord
[1:04:35] delayeth his coming, he shall be and
[1:04:37] shall begin to smite his fellow servants
[1:04:38] and eat and drink with the drunken. The
[1:04:40] Lord of thou s servant shall come in a
[1:04:42] day when he lookth not for him and in an
[1:04:44] hour that he is not aware of and shall
[1:04:47] cut him aunderder and appoint his
[1:04:48] portion with the hypocrites that shall
[1:04:50] be weeping and nashing of teeth. I'm
[1:04:52] going to let you be seated. Amen. At
[1:04:54] this time,
[1:04:57] Amen.
[1:05:02] Amen.
[1:05:14] Amen.
[1:05:16] First of all, first thing I want to say
[1:05:19] is
[1:05:21] that
[1:05:24] not very many people care. The world
[1:05:27] doesn't really care
[1:05:29] about whether they're ready to for his
[1:05:31] coming or not. Amen. Now, how many
[1:05:34] believes the rapture is an appointment?
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; It's something that's going to happen in
[1:05:40] the future
[1:05:42] and it's something that we're either
[1:05:43] going to be ready for or we're not going
[1:05:46] to be ready for it.
[1:05:50] Amen.
[1:05:52] And I believe the people that are going
[1:05:54] to be ready for it,
[1:05:56] there's going to be something on the
[1:05:58] inside of them that really really cares.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz to not care is an insane statement.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; People just don't really care
[1:06:15] and THEY DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE
[1:06:17] MOST VALUABLE thing that they have.
[1:06:22] They place values on the wrong thing.
[1:06:28] What's the most valuable thing that you
[1:06:30] have?
[1:06:32] That's your soul.
[1:06:34] Amen.
[1:06:37] That's your soul. I just thought about
[1:06:40] this. I thought, you know, I'm so
[1:06:41] thankful that God gives us a care.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] about this rapture.
[1:06:51] Amen. Talking about the rapture, I want
[1:06:52] to read it. It says, "I would have not
[1:06:54] you." And you know, it's something about
[1:06:56] how that we use this so many times to
[1:06:58] try to bring comfort at a funeral, but
[1:07:02] amen. But
[1:07:05] I don't know Paul used this for a
[1:07:08] funeral text. He did talk about those
[1:07:11] that sleep, that we sorrow not as those
[1:07:14] who uh don't have any hope.
[1:07:17] But I believe this is is can apply to
[1:07:19] us. Amen. Outside of a funeral setting.
[1:07:25] Amen. [snorts]
[1:07:25] I would not have you ignorant brethren
[1:07:27] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:07:29] you sorrow not even as others which have
[1:07:31] no hope. But if for if we believe that
[1:07:34] Jesus Christ died and rose again, even
[1:07:36] so them also which sleep in Jesus will
[1:07:38] God bring with him. For this we say unto
[1:07:41] you by the word of the Lord, that we
[1:07:42] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:07:45] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:07:46] them which are asleep. For the Lord
[1:07:49] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:07:51] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[1:07:53] with the trump of God, and the dead in
[1:07:56] Christ shall rise first. Now, if you've
[1:07:58] been in the message very long, you know,
[1:08:01] you can go into uh the coming of the
[1:08:03] Lord, the second coming of the Lord, and
[1:08:04] so forth. And brother Brandham going
[1:08:06] through the rapture. I believe it was uh
[1:08:08] the rapture that he preached this on. I
[1:08:10] won't go through it this morning, but
[1:08:13] [snorts] he talks about uh describes
[1:08:15] that this message. Amen. First, there's
[1:08:17] a message that goes forth. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:20] And he certainly makes it sound like the
[1:08:22] message that you and I are in. Amen. A
[1:08:25] message goes forth. Amen. A trumpet
[1:08:28] sounds. Amen. A message goes forth. and
[1:08:31] just how all that is. And if you ask
[1:08:33] five different preachers for different
[1:08:35] interpretations, you might get a little
[1:08:36] bit different. Amen. But this is what
[1:08:39] I'm waiting for. I'm looking for the
[1:08:42] time. Amen. If truly I, you know, I
[1:08:44] wouldn't doubt it that it's the message
[1:08:46] and the trumpet, but there has to be a
[1:08:48] time when speak Jesus speaks. When a
[1:08:51] trumpet blows and Jesus speaks
[1:08:55] AND HE CALLS ALL THOSE THAT ARE DEAD OUT
[1:08:58] OF THE GRAVE. How many believes when the
[1:09:00] role is called up yonder, I'LL BE THERE.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS TO MAKE THAT CALL. But Abraham
[1:09:05] said, if Jesus when at Jesus at Lazarus
[1:09:10] grave, if he wouldn't have said Lazarus
[1:09:13] and he'd have just said come forth,
[1:09:16] didn't brother Bam SAY THEY ALL COME
[1:09:18] FORTH.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. WHY? SO WHEN JESUS
[1:09:22] SAYS THAT, AMEN. WHEN HE SAID WHEN HE
[1:09:25] CALLS THEM ALL [screaming] OUT, AMEN.
[1:09:27] WE'RE GOING TO COME FORTH. AMEN. I don't
[1:09:30] know how he'll do it.
[1:09:33] I don't know that any man will know how
[1:09:34] he do it, BUT HOW MANY KNOWS THAT WHEN
[1:09:36] HE SAYS, "COME HOME MY CHILD." MAYBE
[1:09:40] HE'LL SAY, "MY CHILDREN." CUZ WHEN HE
[1:09:42] CALLS, then how many knows? Not
[1:09:44] everybody's coming up out of the grave.
[1:09:47] Not everybody. Only his elect will come
[1:09:49] up out of the grave. That's why I say I
[1:09:51] don't know just what the words that
[1:09:52] he'll say or what he'll say. But we do
[1:09:54] know that not all of them come at that
[1:09:56] time. Not until after the thousand
[1:09:58] years. And it says then he calls
[1:10:00] everybody up. Everybody see gave up the
[1:10:04] debt therein and everything everywhere.
[1:10:07] Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And it goes a little
[1:10:10] bit into accountability. Talking about
[1:10:12] accountability and Amen. And a
[1:10:15] checklist. And Amen. We want to talk
[1:10:17] about that checklist of the rapture of
[1:10:19] of whether we're ready or not. How many
[1:10:21] believes we need to if you're going to
[1:10:22] if YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT,
[1:10:24] YOU BETTER BE READY FOR that
[1:10:25] appointment.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:30] Amen. I want that's Amen. But let's talk
[1:10:32] about this here. How many believes
[1:10:34] there's going to be a rapture?
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:39] I've been in the message for quite some
[1:10:41] time and I do know that those who were
[1:10:45] into the uh
[1:10:48] [snorts] doctrine of Peruia. Amen. And
[1:10:53] Amen. that they uh made some strong
[1:10:56] statements and you know that the Lord
[1:10:58] has come already. So why are you looking
[1:10:59] for him? Amen. And things like that. Why
[1:11:03] are you looking for him? Amen. And and
[1:11:05] so you know it was kind of Sure. And I
[1:11:09] can show you, brother Bam said that
[1:11:10] Jesus has come into fullness in his
[1:11:13] church, in his spirit, in his people.
[1:11:15] He's come in his fullness.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; He has. But even way back in invisible
[1:11:20] union of the bride. Amen. Towards the
[1:11:23] end. Amen. Uh he said it this way. And
[1:11:26] we are enthused about it. And we know
[1:11:28] that history is closing out. The world's
[1:11:30] history will soon be over. Then we're
[1:11:33] going to step over into a new day to the
[1:11:36] great millennium. Amen.
[1:11:39] Amen. So, uh, that as one believer, I
[1:11:44] believe in a millennium, a millennial
[1:11:46] reign with Christ A THOUSAND YEARS UPON
[1:11:49] the earth, the physical return of the
[1:11:52] Lord Jesus Christ to take a physical
[1:11:55] people glorified by his cleansing blood.
[1:11:58] So you see, no matter how much DO WE
[1:12:00] SHOULD KNOW AND BELIEVE THAT HE'S COME
[1:12:01] SPIRITUALLY, we believe that he's here.
[1:12:04] WE BELIEVE THE PRESENCE OF GOD. PERUIAN
[1:12:06] MEANS THE PRESENCE OF GOD. HOW MANY
[1:12:07] believe we sensed it right right off of
[1:12:10] right off the go get in our service.
[1:12:12] Amen. Our song service, we sense the
[1:12:14] presence of God. HOW MANY BELIEVES THE
[1:12:16] PRESENCE OF GOD is here. The perusia of
[1:12:19] God is here.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; But there will be A PHYSICAL COMING of
[1:12:24] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. to receive
[1:12:27] a physical people and to change us in
[1:12:30] the moment IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AT
[1:12:33] THE LAST TRUMP.
[1:12:35] HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT IS OUR GOAL?
[1:12:38] THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. THAT'S
[1:12:41] our objective.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:48] Amen. And therefore, Amen. Even as
[1:12:51] anyone WHO HAS GOT THAT GOAL, HAS GOT
[1:12:54] THAT AMBITION.
[1:12:55] AMEN. Gets ready. You have to get ready
[1:12:58] because I believe it was even Jesus
[1:13:00] said, "Therefore, be ready for you know
[1:13:03] not the day or the hour."
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Rapture ready. Get ready because you
[1:13:09] don't know just when that'll be. We know
[1:13:11] that the nations are shaking. Uh Russia,
[1:13:14] America, Trump and all of them is always
[1:13:17] they're threatening nuking nuking each
[1:13:19] other. the threat. How somebody knows
[1:13:21] the threat level, the the verbal threats
[1:13:23] with the mouth have really come up.
[1:13:25] Amen. And this thing with the Ukraine
[1:13:27] and the war that's going on and how that
[1:13:30] Putin has warned and warned that if you
[1:13:32] supply them, then you're involved. Then
[1:13:34] you're part of it. Ain't that right? As
[1:13:37] far as I'm concerned, we're at war with
[1:13:38] you, so to speak. Amen. We'll do this
[1:13:41] and we'll do that. And they all kinds of
[1:13:43] threats, you know, and I mean, right
[1:13:44] there at the verge. And brother Benham,
[1:13:46] look what he said after the woman and so
[1:13:48] forth. The next thing he saw was nothing
[1:13:50] but a burnt over America.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But so I believe, how many
[1:13:54] believes it's about time to get out of
[1:13:56] here? It's about time to leave. And this
[1:13:59] morning,
[1:14:01] what we come to church for,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. is to check up.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] the second coming of the Lord.
[1:14:17] He says it this way.
[1:14:21] It's later than we think. Paragraph 5,
[1:14:24] paragraph 54, he says, "We don't just
[1:14:27] come to church to occupy a pew.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; We do NOT COME TO CHURCH JUST TO HEAR A
[1:14:33] GOOD SERMON."
[1:14:36] WE COME to church or come to church just
[1:14:39] to hear good music.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; THEY ALL GOT THEIR PLACE. BUT WHAT WE
[1:14:44] BETTER COME TO CHURCH for is to check up
[1:14:48] with God.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe other places he
[1:14:52] says? You know, we better BE CHECKING UP
[1:14:54] EVERY MONTH. We better check up every
[1:14:56] week. We better check up every day. WE
[1:14:59] BETTER CHECK UP EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY
[1:15:01] DAY.
[1:15:03] THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS
[1:15:05] MORNING. WE WANT TO NOT JUST A CHECK
[1:15:07] CHECK UP FROM THE NECK UP as brother
[1:15:10] Ernie Velinova used to say it.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT A CHECKUP FROM THE NECK DOWN.
[1:15:17] WHY? BECAUSE IT'S NOT SO IMPORTANT
[1:15:19] WHAT'S UP HERE, BUT WE NEED TO KNOW
[1:15:21] WHAT'S IN HERE
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; IN the heart.
[1:15:25] And in order for you to really have that
[1:15:28] light to shine down in your heart, it
[1:15:30] takes the Holy Spirit
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; to do it.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Thank God for people that care about
[1:15:37] their welfare and where they are with
[1:15:39] Christ.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought that was good. This was
[1:15:46] just him kind of beginning to speak.
[1:15:48] Now, let me uh go back and read another
[1:15:52] scripture in Luke that I wanted to go
[1:15:54] to.
[1:15:59] In Luke 15 and8
[1:16:02] he says and I want to kind of go into
[1:16:05] the area of
[1:16:07] checking up now. Amen.
[1:16:10] checking up.
[1:16:13] Either what woman having 10 pieces of
[1:16:16] silver, if she lose one piece, does not
[1:16:19] light a candle and sweep the house, and
[1:16:22] seek diligently till she find it.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; And when she has found it, she callth
[1:16:28] her friends and her neighbors rather,
[1:16:29] saying, "Rejoice with me, FOR I HAVE
[1:16:31] FOUND THE PEACE WHICH I HAVE [screaming]
[1:16:33] LOST." AMEN. How many knows THE CHURCH
[1:16:37] LOST A LOT ALL DOWN THROUGH THE AGES?
[1:16:40] They lost their first love. THEY GOT
[1:16:42] BITTERNESS IN THEIR HEART. THEY GOT
[1:16:43] ALMIGHTY. THEY LOST THEIR FAITH. THEY
[1:16:45] LOST THEIR ADHERENCE TO THE WORD. THEY
[1:16:47] LOST ALL KINDS OF THINGS.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; But we know THAT WE WERE RESTORED IN OUR
[1:16:52] GENERATION. And we're supposed to be
[1:16:54] have been restored back. Amen. But this
[1:16:57] woman, I mean, this is the scripture
[1:16:59] that he reads when he speaks on the
[1:17:01] second coming of Christ in 57. Now, this
[1:17:04] may SEEM LIKE A ODD SCRIPTURE for the
[1:17:06] second coming of Christ, but it's
[1:17:08] speaking of the second coming. And this
[1:17:10] great SUBJECT THAT WE HAVE HERE NOW
[1:17:12] BEFORE US IS THE MOST VITAL SUBJECT OF
[1:17:15] THE ENTIRE RED. HE SAYS, "THERE'S
[1:17:17] NOTHING AS SO IMPORTANT AS THE COMING OF
[1:17:20] THE LORD JESUS."
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'd like for us all to repeat
[1:17:26] that. There's nothing so important as
[1:17:30] the coming of the Lord Jesus.
[1:17:34] There's nothing in your life, nothing
[1:17:37] in your life so important as the coming
[1:17:41] of the Lord Jesus. How many believes
[1:17:42] that?
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; I certainly do.
[1:17:48] Amen.
[1:17:52] Brother Brandham says it this way. Heal
[1:17:54] the sick and the afflicted. We pray
[1:17:57] that. We pray that tonight. his in his
[1:17:59] prayer that you'll give us such a great
[1:18:02] service. May there not be a fe feeble
[1:18:04] person in our midst because of your
[1:18:07] presence. Lord, may our hearts
[1:18:09] continually be set on thee. And we know,
[1:18:13] Lord, that money, property, things of
[1:18:16] the world have no meanings. They're just
[1:18:19] temporal. All of them must go. Our jobs,
[1:18:22] our places, our friends, everything must
[1:18:24] go. No matter how rich or how poor or
[1:18:27] how popular or unpopular that we are, it
[1:18:30] all must go. There's only one thing that
[1:18:33] our being here is centered around. I
[1:18:36] hope I'm speaking to your souls this
[1:18:37] morning. And that's Jesus Christ.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Centered around. And that's Jesus
[1:18:44] Christ. So God, let us lay aside
[1:18:46] everything that's secondary and hold on
[1:18:49] to him. And he is the word, the
[1:18:52] vindicated word of the hour.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; How many believes everything in this
[1:18:58] world is secondary?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] This right here is what we're doing is
[1:19:04] first in your life. First in my life.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; It's first, not second, not third.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we allow it. Amen.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; God don't want it. God don't want him to
[1:19:20] be sec. He don't want to be second in
[1:19:22] your life.
[1:19:25] No. Anything you put before God is an
[1:19:29] idol. Amen. An idol.
[1:19:36] Amen.
[1:19:39] Let's look for a minute before we get
[1:19:40] into this. Let's look at
[1:19:45] those who are not ready.
[1:19:48] those who don't check up,
[1:19:50] those who are not going,
[1:19:52] not going to make it.
[1:19:55] Would that be all right?
[1:19:58] In order to do so, the first one of
[1:20:00] course
[1:20:02] is the one that we just read about in
[1:20:05] Matthew.
[1:20:10] And that is if the servant
[1:20:15] listen. But if that evil servant shall
[1:20:18] say in his heart, "The Lord delayeth his
[1:20:20] coming and shall begin to smite his
[1:20:23] fellow serpent servants and to eat and
[1:20:26] to drink with the drunken and so forth."
[1:20:29] In other words, he gets lukewarm,
[1:20:32] backslid.
[1:20:34] Think that God, well, you know, I've
[1:20:37] heard that before, brother Ber. I've
[1:20:39] heard so much about the coming of the
[1:20:41] Lord, the coming of the Lord, the
[1:20:42] rapture taking place until you hear so
[1:20:45] much until you just become slack and it
[1:20:47] doesn't really mean that much to you
[1:20:49] anymore. You are a prime suspect
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; for being left behind,
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; for being left out.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; You get slack, you drink, you do things
[1:21:01] you ought to do, live wrong. Ain't that
[1:21:04] right?
[1:21:08] And then
[1:21:11] in Romans,
[1:21:14] let's look at this category of people
[1:21:16] here.
[1:21:19] Romans 1
[1:21:22] and these people who professed
[1:21:24] themselves to be wise, became fools, and
[1:21:26] so forth. Way down in verse 29 of
[1:21:29] Romans, he says, "Being filled with
[1:21:31] unrighteousness,
[1:21:33] fornication,
[1:21:34] wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
[1:21:37] envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity,
[1:21:41] whisperers, backbiters, haters of God,
[1:21:44] despiteful, proud, boasters, inventive,
[1:21:47] inventors of evil things, disobedient to
[1:21:50] parents." Amen.
[1:21:54] without understanding, covenant
[1:21:56] breakers, without natural affection,
[1:21:58] implicable, unmerciful, who knowing the
[1:22:00] judgment of God, that they which commit
[1:22:02] such things are worthy of death.
[1:22:07] Over in Revelations 21 and verse 8, it
[1:22:10] says, "But the fearful,
[1:22:13] the unbelieving."
[1:22:15] Huh? You know how terrible a thing it is
[1:22:18] to be fearful and unbelieving?
[1:22:20] [clears throat]
[1:22:22] How many believes that? Let me just I'm
[1:22:24] going to take my time. How many believes
[1:22:25] that God comes to take that fear out of
[1:22:27] our lives?
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Sin brings condemnation. Condemnation
[1:22:33] brings fear.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sin, condemnation, fear. How many
[1:22:40] times he say, "Fear not. Fear not. Fear
[1:22:42] not." Nothing to be fearful. It's
[1:22:44] because they're unbelieving. the
[1:22:46] abominable,
[1:22:48] the murderers,
[1:22:49] whoreongers,
[1:22:51] sorcerers,
[1:22:53] idoltors. Remember, idolatry is to put
[1:22:56] something else before God first.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Whatever you put before God is idolatry.
[1:23:02] Amen. And all liars
[1:23:06] shall have their part in the lake which
[1:23:09] burnth with fire and brimstone, which is
[1:23:12] the second death. So we see those who
[1:23:15] are not prepared. How many know we could
[1:23:17] go into Revelation 3. Amen. Thou sayest
[1:23:20] thou art rich and increase with goods
[1:23:22] and have need of nothing and knowest not
[1:23:24] that thou are miserable, wretched, poor,
[1:23:28] blind, and naked. What did God do with
[1:23:30] them? Spew them out of his mouth.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; How many believe there's many people
[1:23:37] that seem to be very spiritual?
[1:23:40] VERY SPIRITUAL. They can uh heal the
[1:23:43] sick. THEY CAN CAST OUT DEVILS. THEY CAN
[1:23:45] DO ALL THESE THINGS. BUT WHEN THAT DAY
[1:23:47] COMES, WHAT will he SAY? HE'LL SAY,
[1:23:49] "DEPART FROM ME, YOU WORKERS OF
[1:23:51] INIQUITY. I NEVER KNEW YOU." WHY?
[1:23:54] BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAD A deep
[1:23:57] relationship with God.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Brandham, I believe,
[1:24:02] defined that that that I never knew you.
[1:24:04] Amen. Talking about a deep personal
[1:24:07] relationship.
[1:24:08] Amen.
[1:24:10] They had a relationship ON THE FLESH.
[1:24:13] HALLELUJAH. BOY, that feels good. Amen.
[1:24:15] Or in the spirit realm, BUT THEY NEVER
[1:24:18] GOT it in the soul.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. The rain falls on the just on the
[1:24:24] unjust, but it didn't go all the way to
[1:24:26] their soul. So, we see that group of
[1:24:28] people, they're not ready.
[1:24:31] THEY HAVEN'T CHECKED UP. THEY DIDN'T
[1:24:33] CARE.
[1:24:36] How many believes we need to care about
[1:24:38] our soul? We need to care about where
[1:24:41] you at with God.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; It's checking up time. It's always
[1:24:48] checking up time.
[1:24:50] Amen.
[1:24:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:59] All right.
[1:25:00] So again he says when he says it's the
[1:25:04] this great subject that here before us
[1:25:06] is the most vital subjects of the entire
[1:25:10] holy rit.
[1:25:15] There's nothing so important as the
[1:25:18] coming of the Lord Jesus.
[1:25:21] I stopped there and I thought look at
[1:25:23] that
[1:25:26] nothing as important. Why?
[1:25:30] Now, his first COMING WAS IMPORTANT.
[1:25:32] WHAT HE DID ON CALVARY WAS IMPORTANT.
[1:25:36] BUT LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. IF YOU BUY
[1:25:38] SOMETHING AT A STORE and you pay for it,
[1:25:44] Amen. And then you HAVE TO GO TO THAT
[1:25:45] STORE PERHAPS TO PICK IT UP.
[1:25:49] WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR MOST JOYOUS
[1:25:51] MOMENT WHEN YOU PAID FOR IT?
[1:25:54] NO.
[1:25:55] THE MOST JOYOUS TIME IS WHEN YOU GET A
[1:25:58] HOLD OF IT. SAY, "HEY, here it is. THIS
[1:26:00] IS WHAT I BOUGHT."
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE SECOND COMING OF THE
[1:26:03] LORD IS.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; All the way. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT THAT
[1:26:09] BACK BEFORE GOD WAS GONE WHEN HE WAS ALL
[1:26:13] BY HIMSELF,
[1:26:15] all alone. Didn't even have any angels
[1:26:18] yet to worship him. And he takes he HAS
[1:26:21] AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP means God. God had
[1:26:24] you have to have a uh somebody
[1:26:26] worshiping you in order to be a God.
[1:26:29] So way before then there he was
[1:26:33] and he had a DESIRE IN HIS HEART. How
[1:26:36] many believe GOD HAD A DESIRE in his
[1:26:39] heart?
[1:26:41] HE HAD SOME SUBSTANCE, something on the
[1:26:44] inside OF HIM THAT HE WANTED to
[1:26:46] manifest, THAT HE WANTED TO GRAB A HOLD
[1:26:49] OF, that he wanted to be tangible.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING
[1:26:58] THAT HE'S STILL NOT THERE YET.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; GOD IS STILL NOT THERE YET. HE'S WORKING
[1:27:06] ON GETTING THERE.
[1:27:11] [laughter]
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. BECAUSE ALL THOSE SOULS,
[1:27:17] PAUL'S GROUP, IRENEIUS'S GROUP, OUR
[1:27:19] GROUP, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S GROUP, WHERE
[1:27:21] ARE THEY? THEY'RE NOT there in WITH HIM.
[1:27:24] THEY'RE NOT WITH JESUS.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE A STEP BELOW HIM.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; How many knows that even brother
[1:27:32] Brandham wanted to see him and the angel
[1:27:34] says, "No, no, no, no, no.
[1:27:37] Not time yet.
[1:27:39] HE'S UP HIGHER YET. YOU'RE RIGHT UNDER
[1:27:42] THE ALTAR. YOU'RE RIGHT IN HIS PRESENCE.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; You're in THE PRESENCE OF GOD, BUT
[1:27:48] YOU'RE JUST A STEP BELOW. OH, he's in
[1:27:50] another dimension, even higher.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; And he's WAITING FOR THAT LAST ONE TO
[1:27:55] COME IN.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT LAST ONE COMES IN, RAPTURE
[1:28:04] TIME, REMEMBER WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD
[1:28:06] SAID, MAN, I'M TELLING YOU, PAUL'S
[1:28:09] GROUP,
[1:28:11] Ireneius's group.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] H
[1:28:21] should I say it or shouldn't I?
[1:28:24] There was this relative of mine. I'll
[1:28:26] just say that way. Amen. That well I
[1:28:30] can't say it without you know who I'm
[1:28:32] talking about.
[1:28:34] My brother Mooney. I'm going to talk
[1:28:36] about my brother Mooney. He was kind of
[1:28:38] you know he went through a real rough
[1:28:39] time. Mervous breakdown and everything
[1:28:41] and he's had it real hard but he kind of
[1:28:43] got away from uh the message kind of and
[1:28:44] so forth. And I said what do you
[1:28:46] believe? do you believe brother Brandham
[1:28:48] was a prophet yet and so forth and yeah
[1:28:50] I believe you know and he says well he
[1:28:52] was just kind of and says and I says IF
[1:28:54] NOT IF YOU'RE NOT A CONVERT of brother
[1:28:56] Brandham then what group are you going
[1:28:59] to come up with
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; where ARE YOU GOING TO COME UP at
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz how many know BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS
[1:29:05] THEY'RE YOUR CONVERTS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
[1:29:06] YOU BUT I'M not ashamed to say I'm a
[1:29:08] CONVERT TO BROTHER BRANDON NOT ONE
[1:29:10] [screaming] BIT
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; WHY BECAUSE HE WAS A SEVENTH ANGEL HE
[1:29:14] WAS ONE OF THOSE ANGELS THAT HAVE THEIR
[1:29:16] GROUP.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; How many BELIEVES WE'RE PART OF THAT
[1:29:21] GROUP? [screaming]
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SAY IT,
[1:29:26] BUT THEY'LL COME. THAT GROUP OF YOU ALL
[1:29:28] COME AND I DON'T KNOW. I CAN ONLY
[1:29:30] IMAGINE IT BECAUSE THE WAY THAT BROTHER
[1:29:33] BRANDON PREACHED IT, he says, "Man, it's
[1:29:34] going to be like a parade."
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY'LL COME FORTH AND THEY'LL
[1:29:39] COME FORTH AND GUESS WHAT? WE'RE ALL
[1:29:42] GOING TO GET TO CROWN HIM KING OF KINGS
[1:29:44] AND LORD OF LORDS. EITHER ALL OF US DO
[1:29:47] OR NONE OF US DO.
[1:29:50] Thank you, Jesus. [applause]
[1:29:53] THAT'S RIGHT. NOBODY GETS TO SEE HIM
[1:29:55] UNTIL ALL OF US GET TO SEE HIM. OH, I
[1:29:57] WANT TO see him. LOOK UPON HIS FACE
[1:30:00] THERE TO SING FOREVER OF HIS SAVING
[1:30:02] GRACE ON THE STREETS OF GLORY. LET US
[1:30:05] LIFT OUR VOICE. CARES OUR PAST HOME AT
[1:30:08] LAST. EVER TO REJOICE. HOW MANY LOOKING
[1:30:11] FOR THAT DAY? COME ON, PEOPLE. BEGIN TO
[1:30:14] THINK ABOUT IT IN YOUR HEART. LET GOD
[1:30:16] COME DOWN THIS MORNING AND PENETRATE
[1:30:18] YOUR HEART. GET RID OF the worldly
[1:30:21] things. IT'S TIME TO PUT THE PEANUTS
[1:30:23] down [applause]
[1:30:26] and BEGIN TO EMBRACE THE PRESENCE OF
[1:30:28] GOD. AMEN. WE'RE GOING TO BE WELCOMING
[1:30:30] HIM. WHAT SCOTT GOT TO DO? SHUT THIS
[1:30:33] CHURCH DOWN. WHAT'S HE GOT TO DO? BRING
[1:30:35] A PERSECUTION UNTIL WE'LL BEGIN TO CRY
[1:30:38] FOR HIM AND SAY, "LORD, EVEN SO, GOD,
[1:30:41] COME LORD. [screaming] WE'RE READY FOR
[1:30:42] YOU.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. DON'T HAVE TO PERSECUTE ME. YOU
[1:30:46] AIN'T GOT TO PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD. AMEN.
[1:30:48] NO, I'M GOING TO WORSHIP AND SAY, "GOD,
[1:30:50] WE'RE WAITING FOR YOUR COMING. IT'S THE
[1:30:53] MOST IMPORTANT EVENT OF ALL TIME,
[1:30:55] [screaming]
[1:30:56] ALL ETERNITY." IT'S WHAT HE HAD IN HIS
[1:30:58] MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:31:01] [screaming] THAT'S WHY IT'S SO
[1:31:03] IMPORTANT.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; That's why it's such a great event.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; There's nothing so important as the
[1:31:14] coming of the Lord. [sighs and gasps]
[1:31:17] FOR IF HE DOES NOT COME,
[1:31:22] I'm going to SAY BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
[1:31:24] MAKE IT,
[1:31:26] YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING.
[1:31:28] THEN BROTHER BAM SAYS, MAN, YOU CAN'T
[1:31:31] MISS IT. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T MISS
[1:31:34] THAT TIME. YOU GO AHEAD AND YOU LET THE
[1:31:36] HOLY SPIRIT COME DOWN AND CHECK YOUR
[1:31:39] LIFE.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; DO A CHECKUP. MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY TO
[1:31:44] GO.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what we come to the house
[1:31:49] of God for. Not to worm up you. Not just
[1:31:52] to hear another sermon by your pastor or
[1:31:54] brother Brad. No, WE COME HERE TO CHECK
[1:31:56] UP. SAY, "LORD, HERE I AM. HERE, TAKE MY
[1:32:00] HAND, LORD JESUS. I LIFT IT UP. SAY,
[1:32:03] "LOOK, IF THERE'S ANY EVIL WAY IN ME,
[1:32:06] LORD, IF THERE'S ANYTHING I'M DOING, IF
[1:32:08] I'M MADE SOMETHING ELSE AN IDOL,
[1:32:10] [screaming] GOD, TAKE IT AWAY.
[1:32:15] IF I'VE BECOME LUKEWARM, GOD, TAKE IT
[1:32:17] AWAY. IT'S A CHECKLIST. ARE YOU LUKEWARM
[1:32:20] THIS MORNING? GOD, TAKE THAT AWAY." IF
[1:32:23] YOU ARE, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FIRST
[1:32:24] [screaming] LOVE FOR GOD? AMEN. DO YOU
[1:32:26] NOT CARED ABOUT PRAYING ANYMORE? IS IT
[1:32:29] HARD FOR YOU TO PRAY? IT SHOULD be easy
[1:32:31] for you to pray. AMEN. YOU COULDN'T
[1:32:33] STAND TO GO OUT AND WORK. YOU CAN'T GO
[1:32:35] AFTER [screaming] BREAKFAST WITHOUT
[1:32:36] HAVING A PRAYER. GET ON YOUR KNEES AND
[1:32:38] SAY, "GOD, I CAN'T WALK WITHOUT YOU
[1:32:40] HOLDING MY HAND. I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS
[1:32:42] DAY WITHOUT YOU LEADING ME AND GUIDING
[1:32:45] ME." THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. WE NEED PEOPLE
[1:32:47] THAT HAVE GOT THE LOVE OF GOD IN THEIR
[1:32:49] HEART. IF YOU AIN'T GOT THAT LOVE IN
[1:32:51] YOUR HEART, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
[1:32:52] THERE. BUT B SAID, "WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU
[1:32:55] LAY [screaming] ASIDE EVERYTHING UNTIL
[1:32:56] YOU GOT THAT PERFECT LOVE. IT'S TIME TO
[1:32:59] CHECK. SEE IF YOU HAVE THAT LOVE.
[1:33:01] [applause]
[1:33:04] THANK YOU, JESUS. THAT'S RIGHT. GOD,
[1:33:06] GIVE US THAT LOVE. WE LOVE CHURCH. WE
[1:33:08] GOD [screaming] LOVE PEOPLE OF GOD. WE
[1:33:10] LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE MORE THAN HUNTING
[1:33:12] OR FISHING OR ANY KIND OF PLEASURE THAT
[1:33:14] IT MIGHT BE OUT THERE.
[1:33:17] [sighs]
[1:33:19] [panting]
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:28] These days of mediocracy is over.
[1:33:33] [panting]
[1:33:35] Time to be on fire.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Time to let it burn.
[1:33:40] [sighs]
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; CUZ WHEN THE ROLL IS CALLED UP YONDER,
[1:33:47] CHECKING UP IS KIND OF LIKE A ROLL CALL
[1:33:49] IN THE ARMY. HEY, ARE YOU THERE, BROTHER
[1:33:51] JOHN? ARE YOU THERE? BROTHER TRUMP,
[1:33:53] HERE. AMEN. BROTHER JOSHUA, ARE YOU HERE
[1:33:57] PRESENT? WE OUGHT TO HAVE A ROLL CALL on
[1:34:00] Sunday morning.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; AND THEN READ OFF THE ONES THAT'S
[1:34:03] MISSING.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; READ off the ones that are not feeling
[1:34:06] well. Why is this no one not here? WHY
[1:34:08] IS THAT ONE NOT HERE? WHY ARE YOU NOT
[1:34:10] HERE THIS MORNING? ASK YOURSELF THAT
[1:34:12] QUESTION. CHECK YOUR OWN HEART. SEE WHAT
[1:34:14] KEPT YOU OUT OF CHURCH.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; That wasn't on the script, but it was on
[1:34:21] his script, so that's good enough for
[1:34:22] me.
[1:34:25] IS THAT THE TRUTH THOUGH?
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; LORD HELP US.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT YOU
[1:34:34] BETTER HAVE THE WEDDING GARMENT?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE WAS A WEDDING MADE AND AND
[1:34:38] EVERYBODY WAS INVITED and he invited the
[1:34:40] guests AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS MADE
[1:34:42] EXCUSE AND THEY DIDN'T COME. HE SAID GO
[1:34:44] INTO THE HIGHWAYS AND HEDGES AND BID
[1:34:46] EVERYBODY TO COME. AMEN. AND HIS GUEST
[1:34:48] AND THEN AND THEN WHEN HE DID FINALLY
[1:34:50] COME, I WON'T READ THE SCRIPTURES. HE
[1:34:51] SAYS, YOU KNOW, HE COME IN there and one
[1:34:53] of them didn't HAVE THE WEDDING GARMENT
[1:34:55] ON. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE ROBE ON. HE SAYS,
[1:34:58] "WHAT ARE YOU doing in HERE WITHOUT A
[1:35:00] ROBE?" AND THE MAN WAS SPEECHLESS. HOW
[1:35:03] MANY BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU GET OVER
[1:35:04] YONDER, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU BETTER
[1:35:06] BE DRESSED IN THE ROBE OF HIS
[1:35:07] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO BE DRESSED UP.
[1:35:10] BROTHER MAN SAID, "WHEN I COME DOWN TO
[1:35:12] THE RIVER, AMEN. I WANT TO WRAP MYSELF
[1:35:14] IN THE ROBE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND GO
[1:35:16] INTO HIS ARMS. NOT ON [screaming] MY
[1:35:18] RIGHTEOUSNESS, ON HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS."
[1:35:20] YOU BETTER HAVE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE
[1:35:22] HOLY BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IN YOUR
[1:35:24] LIFE. [applause]
[1:35:30] AMEN.
[1:35:31] Praise be to God.
[1:35:38] Listen, many of you, Brother Ram says,
[1:35:41] this is supposed to be my last one, but
[1:35:42] I'm going to read it. Many of you have
[1:35:44] professed Christianity for a long time
[1:35:47] and know that you have FAILED TO TOTAL
[1:35:49] ALIGN WITH GOD. KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING
[1:35:52] THINGS RIGHT NOW THAT YOU OUGHT NOT TO
[1:35:54] DO AND YOU'RE GOING ON [screaming]
[1:35:55] UNCONFESSING OF THEM. HOW MANY believe
[1:35:58] we NEED THE HOLY SPIRIT, AMEN, TO
[1:36:00] CONVICT US?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Whether we're DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD OR
[1:36:05] WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE DOING, GOD BRING
[1:36:06] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO
[1:36:08] CONVICT US WHERE WE'RE WRONG.
[1:36:12] All right.
[1:36:13] Amen.
[1:36:15] Praise the Lord. Unconfessing, just
[1:36:18] loosely floating along with the tide.
[1:36:26] How many for a real believer floating
[1:36:29] along with the tide's just not going to
[1:36:31] cut it?
[1:36:33] Brother Daniel Cl just going along with
[1:36:36] the flow is not gonna do it. I forgot my
[1:36:39] prayer life this morning. I didn't read
[1:36:40] my Bible. I don't really have a
[1:36:42] relationship with God. That's just not
[1:36:44] going to work.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. GETTING SO BUSY THAT YOU DON'T
[1:36:48] HAVE TIME FOR GOD IS JUST NOT GOING TO
[1:36:50] WORK.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; WHY? CUZ IT'S ABOUT TIME TO ROW AGAINST
[1:36:54] THE STREAM. IT'S TIME TO DO A LITTLE
[1:36:56] [screaming] PADDLING CUZ IT'S FLOWING
[1:36:58] THAT WAY. BUT I REFUSE TO KEEP I'M GOING
[1:37:00] TO GET CLOSER TO GOD THAN I WAS
[1:37:02] YESTERDAY. COME ON. LET'S DO [screaming]
[1:37:03] A LITTLE PADDLING. LET'S NOT FLOW WITH
[1:37:06] THE TIDE. LET'S GO UPSTREAM CUZ THERE'S
[1:37:09] A FALL DOWN THERE.
[1:37:11] WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF THE
[1:37:13] FALL. HOW MANY GLAD FOR THAT? [applause]
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:20] AMEN.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; God is very good.
[1:37:27] Amen.
[1:37:30] I like it.
[1:37:44] God is good.
[1:38:04] Today,
[1:38:05] if a woman is married,
[1:38:08] she should wear a wedding ring as a sign
[1:38:10] that she's married. That's to keep other
[1:38:13] men from having anything to do with her.
[1:38:16] They look and they see she's a married
[1:38:18] woman. In those days, they didn't have
[1:38:20] wedding rings. They had a tablet.
[1:38:24] I don't know if I ever read that. I
[1:38:26] think I might have. Remember in Luke,
[1:38:28] did I read that? I think I did. Thank
[1:38:31] you. But this is him explaining it.
[1:38:35] Amen. It says,
[1:38:38] "And that tablet was on their head. It
[1:38:40] had 10 coins and it went around their
[1:38:42] head and it was a sign they were married
[1:38:45] woman. No man was to fool with them. No
[1:38:48] boys was to flirt with them. They were
[1:38:49] married."
[1:38:51] Each one of those can t coins had a
[1:38:54] different meaning.
[1:38:56] Let me bring that down.
[1:38:59] Different meaning. Amen.
[1:39:02] So, I'll I'll pass on that. But listen,
[1:39:04] he says, if you want to look it up,
[1:39:06] Galatians 5, you'll find that that the
[1:39:09] woman represented the church, and the
[1:39:11] church IS A SPOUSE WIFE to Christ. The
[1:39:14] tablet AND THE CHURCH IS SUPPOSED TO
[1:39:15] wear that the church is supposed to wear
[1:39:18] is found in Galatians five, which is
[1:39:20] love and joy and peace and longsuffering
[1:39:24] and goodness and meekness and gentleness
[1:39:28] and patience. THAT IS THE TABLET THAT'S
[1:39:31] SUPPOSED TO BE WORN BY THE CHURCH.
[1:39:33] BROTHERLY KINDNESS, FELLOWSHIP, AND so
[1:39:36] forth. AND IF THERE EVER WAS A TIME THE
[1:39:38] CHURCH OUGHT TO TAKE INVENTORY TO FIND
[1:39:41] OUT IF IT'S GOT ALL THE COINS, IT SHOULD
[1:39:44] be [clears throat] in 2025. I'm willing
[1:39:47] to say, how many believes that this
[1:39:49] morning? IF THERE EVER WAS [screaming] A
[1:39:50] TIME THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INVENTORY
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; to see whether we Well, let me put it
[1:39:56] just THE WAY THAT IT COMES TO see
[1:39:58] whether this
[1:40:01] HAS JUMPED OFF OF HERE [screaming] AND
[1:40:04] LODGED IN HERE. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S
[1:40:07] WHAT WE GOT TO HAVE? WE CAN'T HAVE IT ON
[1:40:09] TAPES ANYMORE. NOT JUST ON BOOKS
[1:40:11] ANYMORE, BUT IT'S GOT TO COME FROM HERE
[1:40:14] TO HERE.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming] AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT
[1:40:17] GOD IS WORKING ON US? WHETHER YOU DON'T
[1:40:19] IF YOU AIN'T GOT PERFECT LOVE, GOD WILL
[1:40:21] SHOW YOU. HE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY CROSS YOU

[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. CUZ THEN YOU THAT'S HOW
[1:40:29] YOU'LL KNOW WHETHER you can love your
[1:40:30] enemies. BUT BAM SAYS THERE'S NOTHING

[1:40:35] WAS THERE. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, I'M
[1:40:37] MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER THAT IT WILL
[1:40:39] TAKE PERFECT LOVE TO PUT YOU IN THERE.
[1:40:44] OH, come on people. HOW MANY KNOWS IF
[1:40:46] YOU AIN'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S HARD
[1:40:48] TO FORGIVE SOMEBODY. IT'S HARD TO
[1:40:50] OVERLOOK SOMEBODY DOING you wrong. But
[1:40:52] if you GOT THE LOVE OF GOD IN YOUR
[1:40:54] HEART, AMEN. YOU CAN FORGIVE THEM. YOU
[1:40:57] CAN'T OVERLOOK THEIR FAULTS.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; IT TAKES, BROTHER BAM SAYS, MAN,
[1:41:01] WHATEVER YOU DO, LAY ASIDE EVERYTHING.
[1:41:03] HOW MANY BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO START
[1:41:05] LAYING SOME STUFF DOWN? AMEN. LAYING THE
[1:41:07] TIME, BRINGING BACK THE TIME THAT WE'VE
[1:41:10] BEEN ROBBED OF BY GOD, BY THE DEVIL. He
[1:41:13] robs us OF OUR TIME. LAY ASIDE EVERY
[1:41:15] WEIGHT
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; AND THE SIN THAT DOES SO EASILY BESET
[1:41:19] US. LET US RUN THIS RACE
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; THIS RACE THAT'S SET BEFORE US.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:28] Let us run. We had barrel racing in this
[1:41:31] rodeo. Is that right?
[1:41:34] Sister Leicia said we didn't bring
[1:41:36] horses because you know somebody might
[1:41:39] get kicked in the head or something. She
[1:41:40] didn't say that. you know, we didn't
[1:41:42] bring horses, so we're going to use
[1:41:43] people. And we had SOME FUNNY LOOKING
[1:41:45] PEOPLE out there, didn't we? Amen.
[1:41:47] Little uh
[1:41:49] Jonathan and and I believe it's Michael
[1:41:52] HOLDING THEM AND THEY WERE RUNNING
[1:41:54] AROUND THEM BARRELS AND BOY, THEY WERE
[1:41:56] JUST GETTING IT. AND I think he fell
[1:41:59] down at the end. It was pretty humorous.
[1:42:03] Thank the Lord he didn't break his arm
[1:42:04] or something. BUT THEY WERE RACING
[1:42:06] TRYING TO GET FINISHED. PAUL SAID,
[1:42:08] "EVERYBODY RUNS IN THE RACE, BUT ONE
[1:42:11] WINS THE PRIZE." HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT
[1:42:13] THAT'S WHAT WE ought to do? Amen. YOU
[1:42:15] JUST DIDN'T FIND THEM OUT THERE
[1:42:16] HALFAPHAZARDLY JUST WALKING ALONG. NO,
[1:42:19] THEY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO WIN. HOW
[1:42:21] MANY BELIEVES THAT'S WHAT YOU AND I ARE
[1:42:22] TRYING TO DO THIS MORNING. WE'RE NOT
[1:42:24] JUST OUT THERE. AMEN. SEEING HOW SLOW WE
[1:42:26] CAN GO. NO, WE'RE HERE TO WIN.
[1:42:28] [cheering] WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS RACE.
[1:42:30] WE'RE GOING TO FINISH THIS THING.
[1:42:32] [applause]
[1:42:35] PAUL DIDN'T TALK ABOUT A SECOND AND A
[1:42:38] THIRD PLACE, DID HE? AMEN. NO, it was
[1:42:40] just the one THAT THE ONLY ONE WINS THE
[1:42:42] PRIZE. WE HAVE GOT ONLY GOT FIRST PLACE
[1:42:45] PEOPLE HERE.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT MAKE THE RAPTURE AND THOSE
[1:42:48] THAT DON'T.
[1:42:52] AMEN. Let's run. Lay aside every weight
[1:42:55] and the sin that does so easily beset
[1:42:57] us.
[1:43:00] Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad that
[1:43:02] you've got the food to give you the
[1:43:05] vitamins to run?
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; How many please? Let's give the Lord a
[1:43:09] hand for sending this message. Thank you
[1:43:11] Lord for sending this message. THANK YOU
[1:43:14] LORD FOR MALACHI 4. THANK YOU FOR
[1:43:17] SENDING US A PROPHET. THANK YOU GOD FOR
[1:43:20] vindicating your word. IT GIVES US
[1:43:23] RAPTURING [screaming] FAITH WHEN WE SEEN
[1:43:26] THAT WORD VINDICATED. YEAH.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; WOO. THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER. VINDICATED
[1:43:36] WORD OF GOD. PROVEN WORD OF GOD.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; DON'T TRY TO TELL ME NOTHING DIFFERENT.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; IT'S A BUNCH OF HOGWASH. THIS IS WHAT I
[1:43:45] LISTEN TO. This is what I believe. This
[1:43:47] is what I go [screaming] by. [applause]
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz this interprets this. [applause]
[1:43:56] IS THIS THE INTERPRETATION of this?
[1:43:58] DIDN'T BROTHER B SAYS A PROPHET IS A
[1:44:00] DIVINE interpreter of the word.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:06] [sighs]
[1:44:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; People going around saying, "Well, you
[1:44:11] can't really believe everything that
[1:44:12] Brother Brandham taught.
[1:44:15] Can't believe everything he taught." I
[1:44:18] do.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he corrected his errors. I
[1:44:22] believe that.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. where you correct his errors. I
[1:44:26] don't believe it.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Where he did, I believe it.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; BUT RAM SAYS, "MAN, IT'S THAT IMPORTANT,
[1:44:33] BILLY PAUL, THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I
[1:44:35] PREACH. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU
[1:44:37] BELIEVE IT.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; We're either message believers or we're
[1:44:40] message unbelievers."
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:50] I'M GLAD THAT YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE RICH.
[1:44:52] YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE POOR. You ain't got
[1:44:53] to be whatever. Amen. IT DON'T MATTER
[1:44:55] WHAT YOU ARE. AMEN. THIS IS SOMETHING
[1:44:57] THAT YOU CAN HAVE. IT'S for you.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; This is something we can put on
[1:45:01] ourselves. A robe of his righteousness.
[1:45:04] [applause]
[1:45:11] How many believes it's lamp trimming
[1:45:12] time?
[1:45:15] Matthew 24.
[1:45:20] Amen. Let's look at that for a few
[1:45:21] minutes.
[1:45:30] Matthew
[1:45:32] 24:5 it says, "Then the kingdom of
[1:45:34] heaven is likened unto 10 virgins which
[1:45:35] took their lamps and went forth to meet
[1:45:38] the bridegroom."
[1:45:40] Remember, we're talking about
[1:45:43] checking, checking up time,
[1:45:47] trimming up time,
[1:45:50] laying aside every weight.
[1:45:53] Amen.
[1:45:54] Five of them were wise, and five were
[1:45:57] foolish.
[1:45:59] And they that were foolish took their
[1:46:00] lamps and took no oil with them. But the
[1:46:02] wise took oil in their vessels with
[1:46:04] their lamps. AND WHEN THE BRIDEGROOM
[1:46:06] TERRIED, they all slumbered and they
[1:46:08] slept. And at midnight there was a cry
[1:46:11] made, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go
[1:46:14] ye out to meet him." And all those
[1:46:17] virgins AROSE AND TRIMMED THEIR LAMPS.
[1:46:23] Now notice THAT EVEN IT DIDN'T SAY HALF
[1:46:26] OF THEM, BUT IT SAID ALL THOSE TRIMMED
[1:46:28] THEIR LAMPS. NOW, HOW MANY KNOWS THE
[1:46:29] REASON YOU TRIM THAT LAMP IS TO GET THAT
[1:46:31] OLD BLACK STUFF, THAT SMUTTING, THAT
[1:46:33] BLACK STUFF OFF. AMEN. And when you GET
[1:46:36] ALL THAT CUT OFF, AMEN. WHEN YOU LIGHT
[1:46:38] THE FIRE, IT'S SO MUCH BRIGHTER AGAIN.
[1:46:42] IT DON'T SMOKE UP AS BAD.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO TRIM OUR LAMPS.
[1:46:47] [screaming]
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Search down in your soul.
[1:46:52] See if you're pleasing to the Lord.
[1:46:55] How many believe and I may not get to it
[1:46:57] this but one of the big checklists that
[1:46:59] we have to have is the same one that
[1:47:01] Enoch had before he was translated. He
[1:47:04] had this testimony because that's what
[1:47:06] you and I are planning on. How many is
[1:47:07] getting plan on translating?
[1:47:12] What is that funeral home up here? That
[1:47:14] new one. Brother Brad
[1:47:16] Todd County funeral home. Thank you. I
[1:47:18] should remember that.
[1:47:20] Don't like to go in that place. Don't
[1:47:22] like that place very much at all. But I
[1:47:25] don't know about you, but I don't I HOPE
[1:47:26] THAT Y'ALL NEVER HAVE TO LOOK AT ME
[1:47:28] LAYING THERE.
[1:47:30] Is
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; that RIGHT? I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO LOOK
[1:47:32] AT YOU LAYING THERE.
[1:47:35] [laughter]
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; I hope one of these days when I jump off
[1:47:38] of there
[1:47:40] THAT BEFORE I HIT THE GROUND, I HAVE A
[1:47:42] BODY CHANGE.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; A MOMENT IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE. I
[1:47:46] HOPE WHEN YOU'RE SITTING THERE, YOU'LL
[1:47:48] HAVE A BODY CHANGE. [applause]
[1:47:51] WOO!
[1:47:53] THAT'S THE TRUTH. AREN'T WE ALL LOOKING
[1:47:54] FOR THAT? BUT LORD, CHANGE MY HEART.
[1:47:57] SEARCH MY HEART. SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY
[1:48:00] IN THERE TO JUST NOT PLEASING TO YOU.
[1:48:02] CUZ ENOCH HAD THIS TESTIMONY THAT HE
[1:48:05] PLEASED GOD. DON'T WORRY ABOUT PLEASING
[1:48:07] YOUR WIFE, YOUR HUSBAND, YOUR PASTOR.
[1:48:09] MAKE SURE YOU PLEASE GOD AND THEN YOU'LL
[1:48:11] DO ALL RIGHT BY ALL THE REST.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. PLEASE GOD. SAY, "GOD, I
[1:48:17] [screaming] WANT TO BE PLEASING TO YOU."
[1:48:20] [applause] And you've got that little
[1:48:21] voice right on the inside of your heart
[1:48:23] tells you whether you're doing it or or
[1:48:25] you're not.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] Praise the Lord. Well, I lost that pair.
[1:48:31] I got another one.
[1:48:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, notice, trim
[1:48:38] their lamps. And the foolish SAID UNTO
[1:48:40] THE WISE, GIVE US OF YOUR ALL, FOR OUR
[1:48:43] lamps are gone out. But the wise
[1:48:47] answered, "Not so, least there be not
[1:48:49] enough for me and you. Go rather to them
[1:48:52] that sell." In other words, go down to
[1:48:55] the altar and find it the way we found
[1:48:57] it. Amen. Go get it the way we got it.
[1:49:05] How many knows they won't never get it?
[1:49:07] You know why? Because they're not
[1:49:08] willing to come the way that you're
[1:49:10] willing to come. They want to still wear
[1:49:12] their clothes, still wear their makeup,
[1:49:14] still wear their earrings, have their
[1:49:15] tattoos, and go to these great big
[1:49:18] stadiums and pack it out 100,000 people
[1:49:21] and worship the Lord with the song, very
[1:49:23] songs you and I sing,
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; worship like you and I wish almost like
[1:49:27] we could. How many knows they can
[1:49:29] worship?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me them people can't worship.
[1:49:32] They can fly worship, but so could the
[1:49:34] devil.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It ain't nothing new for him. HE
[1:49:37] KNOWS HOW TO DO IT BEST.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Hello
[1:49:41] But THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO SAY DIE TO
[1:49:42] THEMSELVES. THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO GIVE
[1:49:44] UP THEMSELVES. THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO
[1:49:46] LET IT GO DOWN IN THEIR SOUL. ARE YOU
[1:49:48] WILLING TO LET IT GO DOWN IN YOUR SOUL?
[1:49:51] THE VERY life that you LIVE IS WHERE GOD
[1:49:54] IS.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? THERE'S ONLY ONE
[1:49:56] THING THAT'S ACCEPTED. BROTHER BENHAM
[1:49:58] SAID THERE'S NOTHING ELSE EXCEPT EXCEPT
[1:50:00] THE LITERAL LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST LIVING
[1:50:03] IN YOU.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; CHECKLIST TIME. IT'S TIME TO CHECK UP.
[1:50:09] THE WORKS THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO ALSO.
[1:50:12] IT'S TIME TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR OF GOD'S
[1:50:15] WORD.
[1:50:19] And
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; I've got a trick question for you.
[1:50:22] When you look at that mirror,
[1:50:25] whose reflection do you see?
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Zoe, do you see yourself?
[1:50:36] Michael John, when you look in the
[1:50:37] reflection of the word, do you see
[1:50:39] yourself?
[1:50:43] Remember, it's a trick question.
[1:50:47] Or should you be seeing the reflection
[1:50:49] of Jesus?
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. IT OUGHT TO YOU OUGHT TO BE
[1:50:52] ABLE TO SEE JESUS. LET THE WORLD SEE
[1:50:55] JESUS IN YOU. WE DON'T WANT YOU. WE WANT
[1:50:58] JESUS IN YOU. THAT PAUL SAID, "THE LIFE
[1:51:00] THAT I NOW LIVE, I LIVE BY THE FAITH OF
[1:51:02] THE SON OF GOD. WHEN I LOOK IN THIS, I
[1:51:05] SEE MY LIFE REFLECTING JESUS.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; That's a good test for us. Check up
[1:51:13] time. See if you see a reflection of
[1:51:15] Christ.
[1:51:20] Amen. Why you think the Holy Spirit
[1:51:22] convicts you when you speak?
[1:51:27] Amen. I'm here to tell you.
[1:51:32] That's right. Just one of those things,
[1:51:34] isn't it?
[1:51:36] One of those things. Brother Brad
[1:51:38] confessed Wednesday. I'll go ahead and
[1:51:40] tell them. Is that all right?
[1:51:43] I would never forget. I'm going I'm
[1:51:45] going to have a little confession of my
[1:51:46] own. Not a long time ago, brother John.
[1:51:49] I was out on the far lane and we was
[1:51:51] going to Russellville, I think, or
[1:51:53] coming from and I was just cruising down
[1:51:55] the road passing somebody and over
[1:51:58] looked down brother John at least and
[1:52:00] John WAVES AT ME. OH, I FELT so bad. I
[1:52:03] felt so bad. I WAS LIKE, "OH, MAN,
[1:52:06] [screaming]
[1:52:07] THAT'S TERRIBLE.
[1:52:09] I'M THE EXAMPLE HERE NOW. HE'S BEING THE
[1:52:12] EXAMPLE."
[1:52:14] [panting]
[1:52:16] Didn't feel so bad when Brother Brad
[1:52:18] told us about the other day passing a
[1:52:21] cop.
[1:52:24] Me and my wife was coming home from
[1:52:26] Owensboro yesterday or day before. We
[1:52:29] just cruising along and we seen a couple
[1:52:30] cops calling on the ramp and we said in
[1:52:32] our lane just kept cruising. Amen. And
[1:52:34] directly here we come and here comes a
[1:52:36] cup passing us and they were just up
[1:52:38] ahead and I said, "Oh, wait." We wait.
[1:52:40] They come over in the right lane and was
[1:52:42] going to pass them cops and I says,
[1:52:43] "Watch this. Watch this. You're going to
[1:52:45] see the brake light." AND SURE ENOUGH,
[1:52:47] THEY CAME UP TO THE COPS AND I SAYS,
[1:52:49] "OH, that's right. That's right." They
[1:52:51] they're saying, "No, no, no. We're not
[1:52:52] passing. I'm just getting in the right
[1:52:54] lane, that's all. No,
[1:52:58] it's something. Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many knows God
[1:53:03] convicts us of those small things?
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; You can't get away from the fact that
[1:53:09] Brother Abraham said, "When you speed,
[1:53:11] you sin."
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure all of us have a struggle
[1:53:17] with that because the cops even let you
[1:53:20] have five miles an hour. It's not It's
[1:53:22] hard not to take that five they give you
[1:53:24] or eight that they give you. WE ALL KNOW
[1:53:27] WHAT NOT TO GO. DON'T GO OVER 80 cuz
[1:53:29] you're liable to get it. But if you're
[1:53:31] under 80, it used to be I'd set mine on
[1:53:34] about 78, brother Red. I might as well
[1:53:35] be honest with you when I'm going on a
[1:53:37] long trip. No, I can almost pass them at
[1:53:39] 78 and not worry. Don't make it right.
[1:53:43] I'm here to tell you it feels a lot
[1:53:44] better when you set it on what you're
[1:53:46] supposed to set it on. Brother Brandon
[1:53:47] would have his fist back at Billy Paul.
[1:53:49] Amen. say, "Nah, he stayed five under."
[1:53:51] I don't stay five under. I'm not brother
[1:53:54] Brandham. I'll stay two under, maybe.
[1:53:58] As long as I'm under or on.
[1:54:03] Amen. But I'm just using that as an
[1:54:05] illustration. How many believes the Holy
[1:54:07] Spirit anything you say to people or do
[1:54:10] or example you said or whatever, the
[1:54:12] Holy Spirit convicts us?
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; He does. He does. He'll talk to us much
[1:54:17] louder than what we realize if we'll
[1:54:18] just listen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Those little things. It's the little
[1:54:24] foxes that spoil the vine. Little foxes
[1:54:27] that spoil the vine. Amen. I thought
[1:54:31] these foolish virgins, what good does it
[1:54:34] do? What good does it do to trim some of
[1:54:37] this stuff off of your life? Well, I can
[1:54:40] dress better. I can keep this beat
[1:54:41] limit. I can do this, that, or the
[1:54:42] other. I I'll start doing these. I'll
[1:54:44] trim these things off. But what's what's
[1:54:46] more important than even that
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; is that you have oil in your lamp.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; You can look righteous, do righteous,
[1:54:54] and be holy and all of that in the
[1:54:55] outward, but you got to have it down in
[1:54:57] here. You have to have oil in your lamp.
[1:55:00] How many's glad?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I'm glad that I've GOT OIL IN MY
[1:55:05] LAMP. HAVE HAS EVERYBODY HERE AT THE
[1:55:07] CHURCH GOT OIL IN YOUR LAMP? IF YOU
[1:55:09] DON'T HAVE OIL IN YOUR LAMP, JUST COME
[1:55:11] TO THE ALTAR. WE'LL STOP RIGHT NOW AND
[1:55:14] WE'LL PRAY FOR YOU CUZ WE WANT OIL IN
[1:55:17] YOUR LAMP. PART OF THE PREACHER'S JOB,
[1:55:21] AMEN, IS TO GET YOU READY. THE FIVE-FOLD
[1:55:23] MINISTRY IS FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE
[1:55:25] SAME. WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE TO SAY
[1:55:27] THESE THINGS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT
[1:55:28] PERFECT OURSELVES?
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. BUT IT'S BEST FOR US TO
[1:55:33] CONFESS OUR OWN FAULTS, OUR OWN
[1:55:34] FAILURES. MAY IT HELP YOU TO REALIZE
[1:55:36] WE'RE NOT PERFECT EITHER. WE CAN BE
[1:55:38] PERFECT. AMEN. AS WE CONFESS OUR SINS
[1:55:41] AND AS WE PUT IT UNDER THE BLOOD OF
[1:55:42] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? THAT'S RIGHT. I
[1:55:47] BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE
[1:55:48] WITHOUT SIN, SPOTLESS, WITHOUT REBUKE IN
[1:55:51] THIS PRESENT WORLD.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; CHECKUP TIME. ARE YOU WASHED IN THE
[1:55:56] BLOOD? ARE YOUR GARMENTS WHITE? ARE THEY
[1:55:59] WHITE AS SNOW? AMEN.
[1:56:02] That's a good time to check. See if
[1:56:04] you're as white as snow. AMEN. ANOTHER
[1:56:07] [screaming] CHECK. ARE YOU JUSTIFIED?
[1:56:10] HOW MANY BELIEVE WHEN THEY GET OVER
[1:56:11] THERE, EVERYBODY? GOD'S GOING TO HAVE A
[1:56:14] CHECKLIST. AMEN. YOU DID THIS, YOU DID
[1:56:16] THAT, YOU DID THIS, YOU DID THAT. OH,
[1:56:18] YOU HAVE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT FOR
[1:56:19] EVERYTHING THAT YOU EVER DID. BUT AREN'T
[1:56:22] YOU GLAD THAT JUDGMENT DOESN'T START
[1:56:24] OVER THERE. IT STARTS RIGHT HERE. THIS
[1:56:27] IS JUDGMENT FOR YOU. AND I SAY, "GOD,
[1:56:30] I'M GUILTY. I PLEAD THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:56:32] CHRIST. FORGIVE ME OF MY FAILURES.
[1:56:34] FORGIVE ME OF MY SINS. FORGIVE ME OF MY
[1:56:36] SHORTCOMINGS. HELP me to overcome.
[1:56:41] [screaming]
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. LET YOUR SINS DROP IN THE
[1:56:44] BLOOD. AMEN. Let the records be erased.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ARE YOU JUSTIFIED THIS MORNING?
[1:56:53] JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE IT IN
[1:56:56] THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming]
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; IF THAT DON'T DO SOMETHING FOR YOU, I
[1:57:02] DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL. TO KNOW THAT YOUR
[1:57:05] SINS ARE GONE. YOUR PAST IS ERASED.
[1:57:07] [screaming]
[1:57:08] [cheering]
[1:57:09] THAT'S RIGHT. CHECK IT. MAKE SURE IT'S
[1:57:11] DONE. IF IT'S DONE, YOU HAVE SOMETHING
[1:57:12] TO BE HAPPY ABOUT.
[1:57:15] I LIKE THAT CHECKLIST.
[1:57:20] [sighs]
[1:57:22] BE READY [screaming]
[1:57:23] FOR YOU KNOW NOT THE DAY OR THE HOUR.
[1:57:26] OH,
[1:57:27] [sighs and gasps]
[1:57:28] I COULD SAY THAT CALMLY, BUT I DON'T
[1:57:30] FEEL LIKE IT. I BELIEVE IT OUGHT TO BE
[1:57:32] SCREAMED OUT. BE READY. IT COULD
[1:57:35] [screaming] HAPPEN ANYTIME. HE COULD
[1:57:37] APPEAR ANYTIME.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; BE READY.
[1:57:43] [sighs]
[1:57:44] [gasps]
[1:57:45] Have checked out. Checked up. Amen.
[1:57:51] Urban and Martha, they go on a lot of
[1:57:53] trips and I'm sure that they check their
[1:57:55] bags. Don't you reckon their clothes?
[1:57:58] Have you got your passport? HAVE YOU GOT
[1:58:01] YOUR WALLET? HAVE YOU GOT YOUR VISA
[1:58:03] CARD? HAVE YOU GOT THIS? HAVE YOU GOT
[1:58:04] THAT? HAVE YOU GOT A CHECK? CHECK CHECK
[1:58:05] CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK

[1:58:11] the airport, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
[1:58:11] ANOTHER CHECKPOINT. THEY'RE GOING TO
[1:58:13] CHECK YOU OUT BEFORE YOU GET IN THAT
[1:58:16] FLIGHT. THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK YOU OVER
[1:58:17] GOOD. THEY'RE GOING TO X-RAY YOU.
[1:58:20] [laughter]
[1:58:22] [screaming] How many believe the Holy
[1:58:24] Spirit maybe is doing a LITTLE X-RAYING
[1:58:26] ON US THIS MORNING TO FIND OUT IF
[1:58:29] THERE'S ANYTHING THERE THAT OUGHT TO BE
[1:58:30] THERE? SOMETHING THAT CAN'T GO ON THIS
[1:58:33] FLIGHT. WOO! BROTHER [screaming] BAM
[1:58:35] SAYS, "MAN, WHEN YOU GO TO PLACE YOU
[1:58:37] WANT TO MAKE RESERVATIONS, MAKE SURE
[1:58:38] YOU'VE GOT A RESERVATION MADE. I WANT MY
[1:58:41] TICKET IN MY HAND. [panting] I DON'T
[1:58:44] WANT TO HAVE TO GO GET A TICKET. I DON'T
[1:58:45] WANT TO HAVE TO GO GET A TOKEN. I WANT
[1:58:47] THE TOKEN IN MY HAND. I WANT TO KNOW
[1:58:50] THAT THIS MORNING I'M FILLED WITH THE
[1:58:51] HOLY GHOST. I'M RIGHT WITH GOD. I'M
[1:58:53] READY TO GO IF HE COMES TODAY.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps]
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; I want the token in my hand.
[1:59:04] [snorts]
[1:59:11] Wish I had my harmonica.
[1:59:14] Play a little harmonica. Make the sound
[1:59:16] of a train. Woohoo.
[1:59:20] It sounds better than that. Woohoo.
[1:59:25] Choo choo. That sounds better. Choo
[1:59:28] choo.
[1:59:30] That's right. BUT SAYS WHEN YOU'RE AT A
[1:59:33] TRAIN STATION, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HEAR
[1:59:35] THE WHISTLE. THE TRAIN IN THE BLOCK. THE
[1:59:38] PLANE'S ON ITS WAY. TIME TO GRAB
[1:59:40] [screaming] YOUR BAGS. TIME TO PUT THAT
[1:59:41] BAG OF PEANUTS DOWN. AMEN. AND GET READY
[1:59:43] TO GO. HOW MANY IT'S TIME TO GET YOUR
[1:59:46] EYES. AMEN. OFF OF THE THINGS OF THE
[1:59:48] WORLD. AMEN. AND START LIFT UP YOUR
[1:59:50] HEADS FOR YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWTH. N
[1:59:53] CHURCH. IT'S TIME TO START LOOKING UP.

[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; START LOOKING up for our redemption
[2:00:02] is drawing nigh.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; The greatest moment.
[2:00:06] BROTHER TOMMY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE
[2:00:08] GOING TO DO. I KNOW ME AND YOU IS GOING
[2:00:09] TO RUN. WE'RE GOING TO JUMP. WE'RE GOING
[2:00:10] TO OH, MAN. AIN'T NO TELLING.
[2:00:13] AMEN. IF WE'RE IN LINE GOING UP THERE,
[2:00:16] WE MIGHT JUST GET OUT OF LINE AND do a
[2:00:18] LITTLE DANCE. AND I DON'T KNOW. AIN'T
[2:00:20] THAT RIGHT? BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE SO
[2:00:22] HAPPY CUZ WE HAVE FINALLY ARRIVED.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO WIN. We're going to yell.
[2:00:27] WE'VE ARRIVED. WE'RE HERE. WE'VE WAITED
[2:00:30] ALL OUR LIFE FOR THIS. AND HERE WE ARE.
[2:00:33] AMEN. WE'RE IN HEAVEN. IMMORTAL, PERFECT
[2:00:36] STRENGTH, PERFECT YOUTH, NEVER NO OLD
[2:00:39] [screaming] AGE, NEVER ENOUGH
[2:00:40] FEELESSNESS, NEVER ENOUGH PRAYER.
[2:00:43] WE'RE GOING TO JUMP, SCREAM, AND SHOUT
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; AND DANCE ABOUT.
[2:00:49] I'M GOING TO HAVE THE TIME OF MY LIFE
[2:00:50] WHEN THE TIME OF MY LIFE IS OVER. I'M
[2:00:53] GOING TO GET CARRIED AWAY WHEN I GET
[2:00:55] CARRIED away
[2:00:58] [sighs]
[2:01:00] [panting]
[2:01:04] [sighs]
[2:01:04] and I won't have to worry about catching
[2:01:06] my breath, brother. We're going to just
[2:01:09] keep on doing it for a while. [panting]
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; It's checking up time. Amen.
[2:01:18] [sighs and gasps]
[2:01:21] Amen.
[2:01:23] It's checking up time, friends.
[2:01:25] [panting]
[2:01:27] If you'll listen to that tape,
[2:01:31] got a few minutes.
[2:01:34] I didn't actually
[2:01:37] print out some of the real heavy stuff
[2:01:41] that Brother Bram said in this message,
[2:01:47] but it was pretty strong.
[2:01:50] So, I'll read some of this other.
[2:01:53] I can't even find my notes anymore.
[2:01:57] All right, I got them folded up.
[2:02:02] But I'm going to go just a little longer
[2:02:04] and then we'll have communion. Is that
[2:02:05] okay?
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; I'll finish try to finish with this.
[2:02:12] He's talking about this woman being
[2:02:15] married to a husband. Ain't that right?
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "Look, the church is lollying.
[2:02:25] The church has no conscience no more.
[2:02:28] You can't hardly wake them up."
[2:02:31] That's the way Brother Brham says, "You
[2:02:32] can't hardly wake the Baptist up, the
[2:02:34] Methodist up, the Presbyterian, the
[2:02:35] Pentecostal. Can't hardly wake them up."
[2:02:38] How many admits sometimes between Sunday
[2:02:40] and Wednesday and Wednesday and Sunday,
[2:02:42] sometimes we get to be a little
[2:02:43] sleeping. It takes a jolt of the Holy
[2:02:45] Ghost TO WAKE US BACK UP. GOD, GET ME
[2:02:48] KEEP ME. GET ME OUT OF THIS WORLDLY CAR
[2:02:49] WORLDINESS, THIS CARNALITY. GET ME OUT
[2:02:52] OF IT. SNAP ME OUT OF IT. TAKES ME A
[2:02:54] while just to get out of it. But he
[2:02:57] couldn't wake him up. But he said the
[2:03:00] Bible said that it would come in like
[2:03:01] that in this in these days they'll say,
[2:03:04] "Lo, he delayeth his coming." Amen. And
[2:03:09] he says, "I believe it was Sunday
[2:03:11] morning when I was preaching on the
[2:03:12] virtues of a woman hless. Who could find
[2:03:14] anything sweeter than to come home tired
[2:03:18] when God has given him a wife, a woman
[2:03:21] and a man is inseparable? They are one.
[2:03:26] Amen. Then he goes explaining in the
[2:03:27] creation, he made took him out of the
[2:03:29] dust of the earth and then made Adam out
[2:03:31] of her rib. Amen. And she's bone of my
[2:03:33] bone and flesh of my flesh. They were
[2:03:36] one heart. And that's A TYPE OF CHRIST
[2:03:38] IN THE CHURCH. GOD DIDN'T take his
[2:03:40] church out of a creed or a denomination.
[2:03:42] He take it out of the heart of Christ.
[2:03:44] How many? Because that's what YOU'RE
[2:03:45] MADE OUT OF. THAT'S WHAT I'M MADE OUT
[2:03:46] OF. AMEN. HE COME OUT OF THE SIDE OF
[2:03:48] CHRIST. WHAT YOU'RE ENJOYING, THE
[2:03:50] PRESENCE OF GOD THAT YOU'RE ENJOYING,
[2:03:52] THE CREATION THAT YOU'RE ENJOYING THAT
[2:03:54] GOD HAS DONE IN YOU. COME OUT OF THE
[2:03:56] VERY SIGHT OF ALMIGHTY C almighty God,
[2:03:58] Jesus Christ. Amen. And we're one. He
[2:04:02] says, could you imagine, I'll skip on.
[2:04:04] Could you imagine coming home of a
[2:04:05] nighttime tired, weary, worn? And if
[2:04:08] you're a farmer, mechanic, or a
[2:04:10] preacher, whatever you do, you come in
[2:04:12] and when you go to your little home,
[2:04:14] you're longing till you can get there.
[2:04:16] You open the door and that sweet LITTLE
[2:04:17] WIFE STANDS THERE. SHE GREETS YOU. She's
[2:04:20] all pretty and cleaned up. She walks
[2:04:22] over and kisses you on the cheek. SHE
[2:04:24] SAYS, "DAD, YOU'RE TIRED." SHE SETS YOU
[2:04:26] DOWN IN THE CHAIR, SETS HERSELF ON YOUR
[2:04:28] LAP. SHE PUTS HER ARMS AROUND YOU. SHE
[2:04:30] PATS YOU. And it just seems like then
[2:04:34] you're not tired anymore. Something
[2:04:36] picks YOU UP. SOMETHING THAT GOD GAVE
[2:04:38] YOU for that purpose. It's part of you.
[2:04:41] Amen. Now, if she's a true wife, Amen.
[2:04:44] How many wants to be a true wife? Don't
[2:04:46] you just love when you can sit on your
[2:04:47] recliner and say, "Thank you, Lord
[2:04:49] Jesus, for giving us a good service
[2:04:50] today. Thank you, Lord Jesus, FOR
[2:04:52] SPEAKING TO MY HEART TODAY. THANK YOU,
[2:04:54] LORD, FOR walking with me today. Thank
[2:04:56] you, Lord, in those things that I did
[2:04:58] AND WORKED TODAY. YOU HELP ME GET THEM
[2:05:00] DONE." AND just put your arms around
[2:05:02] Christ and tell him how much you love
[2:05:04] him.
[2:05:05] How sweet that is. How wonderful that
[2:05:08] How many enjoys the presence of God
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; and walking with him and talking with
[2:05:12] him every day. BUT HE SAYS, "WHAT IF
[2:05:17] those lips has kissed another man that
[2:05:19] day or some other time? WHAT IF YOU'RE
[2:05:21] CONSCIOUS OF THAT? WHAT IF THE MAN'S
[2:05:23] arms has hugged another man?
[2:05:26] What if them arms has hugged another
[2:05:28] man? She's absolutely an abomination in
[2:05:30] your life. That kiss burns like Judas's
[2:05:33] kiss. Those arms, YOU'D RATHER THEY
[2:05:35] WOULDN'T BE AROUND YOU. OH, SHE MAY BE
[2:05:37] PRETTIED UP AND HER HAIR ALL CURLY AND
[2:05:38] HER EYES BROWN AND SO FORTH, cheeks all
[2:05:40] rosy, little skirts may be ironed, BUT
[2:05:44] SHE MAY BE SO PRETTY, BUT IF THAT REAL
[2:05:45] GENUINELY GOD respect and love and
[2:05:48] confidence isn't there, she'd better
[2:05:50] just stay off your lap. You don't want
[2:05:52] nothing to do with her. How many
[2:05:54] believes there's Amen. Marriage can be
[2:05:57] so wonderful and awesome. Amen. But if
[2:05:59] you have the wrong one or something like
[2:06:00] this, Amen. and it's better to stay
[2:06:02] single. Well, amen. Better to be single.
[2:06:04] I don't care HOW PRETTY SHE MAKES
[2:06:06] HERSELF, SHE'S still wrong until she's
[2:06:08] proven to be real, genuine, sweetheart,
[2:06:10] loving nobody but you. No other kiss
[2:06:13] from her lips but yours. No other arms
[2:06:15] must hold her yours. Amen. And you know
[2:06:18] it. What a feeling. What a consolation
[2:06:20] that is husband and wife, which is type
[2:06:22] of Christ in the church. And when you go
[2:06:24] to church, you may have the best pews in
[2:06:26] the city. YOU MAY HAVE THE HIGHEST
[2:06:27] STEEPLE IN THE CITY. YOU MAY HAVE THE
[2:06:29] best pipe organ. You may dress the best.
[2:06:31] You may sing like a MOCKING BIRD, BUT IN
[2:06:33] ALL OF THAT are you kissing and flirting
[2:06:35] with the world. That kiss on the cheeks
[2:06:37] of Christ is a Judas isgary and a kiss.
[2:06:40] He doesn't want nothing to do with you.
[2:06:42] He looks upon your wedding engagement.
[2:06:45] Amen. Ring and he finds the tablets
[2:06:48] has moved. He finds love has gone. It's
[2:06:52] a form. He finds loyalty is gone. You've
[2:06:56] committed fornications with the world.
[2:06:59] Go to Dan just boogie woogie. and what
[2:07:01] else? And which hopefully it's none of
[2:07:03] us for doing that, but maybe we've just
[2:07:04] gotten a little lukewarm. Amen. Listen,
[2:07:07] you're committing adultery with Christ,
[2:07:10] calling him your husband. You say, "I'm
[2:07:11] rich and greased with not I have I'm
[2:07:14] rich and have need of nothing." But
[2:07:16] said, "You don't know that you're
[2:07:17] miserable, poor, blind, and naked. It's
[2:07:20] time to light the candle and to sweep
[2:07:23] the house. The coming of the Lord is at
[2:07:25] hand." You remember Solomon when he
[2:07:27] spoke of it? He says, "Come, my love."
[2:07:29] AMEN. AND LET US WALK THROUGH THE
[2:07:31] POMEGRANATES. LET US WALK THROUGH THE
[2:07:33] garden of spices. Oh, how he said her
[2:07:35] lips looked like rose buds and so forth.
[2:07:37] He loved his little wife. COME, LET US
[2:07:40] GO AND TAKE OUR FILL OF LOVE. AND WHEN
[2:07:42] YOU GET DOWN TO THE ALTAR AND YOU PRAY,
[2:07:45] is your heart so true and your soul so
[2:07:47] unadulterated that you can say, "Lord
[2:07:50] Jesus, Lord God, LET US TAKE OUR LOVE. I
[2:07:53] LOVE YOU." AMEN. As brother Brandon many
[2:07:56] times at the end of his service say, I
[2:07:57] love him. I love him because he first
[2:08:00] loved me. YES, MY LOVER, I LOVE YOU. Or
[2:08:03] have you been committing fornication?
[2:08:04] Have you been flirting with the world?
[2:08:06] Amen. Up there. He said, he said, uh, he
[2:08:12] looks upon your wedding engagement ring
[2:08:14] and he finds a tablet move. He finds
[2:08:16] love. He's gone for his, he finds
[2:08:17] loyalty is gone. Have you committed
[2:08:19] fornication with the world? And so
[2:08:21] forth. And he talks about watching dirty
[2:08:23] television programs. And I thought, you
[2:08:26] know, you got to watch what you watch on
[2:08:27] your phone, don't you?
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be careful. Amen. You watch the
[2:08:31] wrong thing, go to the wrong place, it's
[2:08:32] spiritual fornication. Amen. And then
[2:08:35] when you come to the house of God and
[2:08:36] sing a song, Amen. He feels like you're
[2:08:38] kissing a Judas is Scariot kiss. Ain't
[2:08:41] that right? How many wants to stay pure
[2:08:42] before the Lord?
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. The hour of the Lord is at hand.
[2:08:46] When all these signs and wonders and
[2:08:47] tens of thousands of other things have
[2:08:49] taken place, pointing, every marker is
[2:08:51] pointing, it's getting dark. It's a
[2:08:54] cooling off of the church. Revival seems
[2:08:55] to be over. Amen. The last bit is about
[2:08:58] finished. And here we find ourselves,
[2:09:00] the church in adultery. Amen. And I
[2:09:03] didn't print it out, but he says, you
[2:09:05] know what? If that wife would come home,
[2:09:06] Amen. or the husband, he said, even if
[2:09:08] the husband would come home, been with
[2:09:10] some other woman and this that or the
[2:09:11] other, and have a venerial disease and
[2:09:13] everything else. And he talked about how
[2:09:15] the church has gotten to that place to
[2:09:16] where she comes in his presence and
[2:09:18] she's got a venerial disease. Amen. have
[2:09:21] worldlyism, pants on and everything
[2:09:23] else. Hello. And he was pretty pretty
[2:09:26] rank about it, but it's still the truth
[2:09:28] that when you go in the wrong direction
[2:09:29] and go in that way and the world, they
[2:09:31] think they can dress anyway, do
[2:09:33] anything, and it's a disease to God. How
[2:09:35] many knows he's not coming for that?
[2:09:37] He's coming for a virtuous bride,
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; spotless, without spot, without wrinkle.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with the thought of
[2:09:48] the quote that I read to you at the
[2:09:49] beginning.
[2:09:51] where brother Abraham says that our
[2:09:53] hearts are what? They're not on the
[2:09:55] secondary. Everything that we have out
[2:09:57] here is secondary, but our hearts are
[2:09:59] set on one thing and that's the Lord
[2:10:03] Jesus Christ.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Our minds are set on the Lord. How many
[2:10:06] say, "God, I that's the way I want to
[2:10:07] be." Lord, purify my heart. Stand with
[2:10:10] me this morning. We'll change the order
[2:10:11] of service. [snorts]
[2:10:13] With your heads bowed, I think it's time
[2:10:16] to take a couple minutes to talk to the
[2:10:17] Lord. give you a chance if there's
[2:10:20] anybody that you don't feel like you're
[2:10:23] right with God, whatever it might be for
[2:10:24] whatever reason, the Holy Spirit
[2:10:26] convicts you. You know, I just don't
[2:10:28] know if I'd be ready to go if he would
[2:10:30] come in the next couple of minutes, but
[2:10:31] I want to be ready. I want to check up.
[2:10:34] I'm not where I ought to be. And I'm
[2:10:36] raising my hand. Say, God, purify my
[2:10:38] heart. Lord Jesus, you see my hands. You
[2:10:41] see all the hands up, God. That's right,
[2:10:43] Lord Jesus. When we really see the Holy
[2:10:45] Spirit, you show us our faults. And we
[2:10:48] certainly see the fault, Lord. If we
[2:10:50] can't see it, then I believe the devil
[2:10:52] has blinded us to our own faults. We're
[2:10:54] still human. We still make mistakes. We
[2:10:56] have shortcomings, Lord. But our hands
[2:10:58] are up, Lord, and saying, "God, I
[2:10:59] surrender all. Lord, take my heart. Take
[2:11:02] my life, Lord. I DON'T EVER WANT TO COME
[2:11:04] TO church and sing," Amazing grace, how
[2:11:06] sweet the sound. Or, "I love him. I love
