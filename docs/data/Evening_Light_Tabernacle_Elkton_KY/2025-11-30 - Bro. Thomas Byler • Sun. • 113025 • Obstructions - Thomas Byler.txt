If I say surely the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall be light about me. &gt;&gt; For thou hast possessed my reigns. Thou know thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. &gt;&gt; How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God.

And so we are thankful for the grace of God because we all certainly need it. Amen. Daily basis. Amen. I'm fading out just a little bit. Amen. Amen. Praise. Shall we pray? Lord Jesus, we come before you once again, Lord. Father, assembling ourselves together, Lord. I think of the time when Job and the sons of God came to the house of God to present themselves before the Lord, Lord Jesus. And we believe God that we're doing the same thing this morning for her, Father. We're coming to your house, Lord Jesus. And we pray and present ourselves to you, God. And we ask, God, that you would speak to our hearts this morning, Father, that the spirit would speak, Lord Jesus, that the Holy Spirit would anoint this morning, Father, to say what you would want to say to the people, Father. Not just, Father, some tradition or something that we've been taught or something that we think about, but Lord, what you want to speak to the church this morning, Father, even as you said in your scriptures, Father, him that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches, Father. So, we ask God that you would just get me out of the way this morning, Lord Jesus, as I yield to you, Father. and having studied and having felt led, Father, to go in a certain direction, we ask God that you'll just go, Father, and take it from there, Lord Jesus, and say what you once said this morning, Father, meet the needs of the people, Father. We know that you already know, &gt;&gt; your guidance now in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Let's just get into the word this morning. Amen. Now I want to start with Matthew. Matthew very very perhaps familiar scripture to us. Amen. But amen. It's always something more that we can get out of it. Amen. How believe how many believes that this word heaven and earth will pass away but his word shall never pass away. Word is eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're thankful for that. The solid rock. Matthew 16. Matthew 16. Amen. And we'll begin with verse 24. Then said Jesus unto his disciples, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is it profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Amen. Let's go over to the book of Luke yet. We'll read one more scriptures. One more scripture. Luke 14. Luke 14 verse 15. And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. Then said he unto him, a certain man made a great supper, and bade many. And sent his servant at supper time to say unto them that were bidden, come, for all things are ready, are now ready. And they all with one consent began to make excusing to first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it. I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have bought five yolk of oxen, and I go to prove them. I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. So that servant came and showed his lord all these things. And the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, "Go out in quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city, and bring thither the poor, the main, the halt, and the blind." And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou's commandment, and yet there is room. And the Lord said unto that servant, "Go into the highways and into the hedges, and compel them to come in that my house may be filled. For I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper." May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated this morning. I want to preach this morning on obstructions. Obstructions. Amen. It's quite a thought, isn't it? It's just a thought that came to me. Amen. And so, um, just want to minister what the Holy Spirit want us wants us to say this morning. Amen. And because you know it's kind of peculiar because coming to church for the most part most places probably they're just teaching what that church teaches or uh some tradition or whatever it might be kind of you know and maybe a lot of them a lot of preachers perhaps aren't yielded to the Holy Spirit the way they should be. But you know, really when we think about it, I thought, you know, I was thinking about ministering and being a preacher and being yielded to Christ and and what's really going on is really we're yielded to the Holy Spirit so that God &gt;&gt; can talk to us. &gt;&gt; How many believes that it's about God talking to us? Not just to come up here and preach a sermon or, you know, or or say what we want to say or what it might be, but it needs to be an uncction that comes from God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so you ask yourself, if God would speak to me this morning, what would he say? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because how many believes that he he is still speaking to his church? His spirit still speaks to his church this morning. And so I got to thinking about as we preached on uh turning point turning points. Amen. And how that you know going down this way that God has made. He is the way, the truth, and the life. And how that in this in this path in this road to go there's turns that we make. Amen. And if you don't make those turns with God, brother Brandham talked about how that you know injunctions of time. You know there's there's different different uh um what do they call it? um dispensational changes, &gt;&gt; changes of dispensations. Amen. Amen. And it's uh kind of treacherous times during those times when God wants to turn a corner. Amen. Uh we got to turn that corner with him. That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to go with him. Amen. I think about where I come from, the Schwartzer trooper Amish, the most strictest of all Amish. It's where I come from until I was 14 years old. And I think of how, you know, if they get to just get a motor and a few belts and they get a little bit more than what they had, they're pretty happy. You know, if they have a a washing machine, you know, that it can have a motor or whatever. And they they want to try to pro have progress. They want to try to have a little bit more things so that they can make stuff with whether it's furniture or whether it's wheels or whatever it might be, you know, and if they can just advance a little bit, but boy, they're very very strict in just staying what they have been taught for hundreds of years. Amen. And there's hardly ever any changes. Nothing changes. But we know that that's not how God works. God is always, his church and his people is always getting closer to God. Amen. We know that Luther when he came out that it was hard for the Catholics because he got to stand right in the front of the pope and said, you know, he can't denounce all of those thesis that he had tacked on the wall BECAUSE IT WOULD GO AGAINST HIS CONSCIENCE and he can't do that. The just shall live by faith, not having to pay for indulgences and all these other things. It was wrong. And God was turning a corner and many had died. Many had gotten burned AT THE STAKE FOR DOING WHAT HE DID. AMEN. AND EVEN AFTER HE WOULD be came through, most of the time the cath catholic church would kill people for coming against them and saying what he did. But there was uh different different um uh kingdoms, different different governments that took Martin Luther in and protected him and gave him some protection. Amen. But it was a turning point and you know and and Luther he didn't have all the truth but he just knew that Amen. the just are supposed to live by faith. Not by having to pay for indulgences or their sins or or do penance and all those things. And then along come Wesley. Amen. How many know along come Wesley which was another star of God. Amen. And he began to preach sanctification. It was the age of man and reformation was on and might it be to put go all over the world. It was the face of a man also. Amen. Out of the four different beasts of revelation. But if you'll notice in Revelations 1 and verse 20, it says, "The mystery of well, let me read you a little bit, a little back a little. Jesus says,"I am he that liveth and was dead. And behold, I am alive forever more. Amen. And have the keys of hell and of death. Write thee things which thou hast seen and and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. And the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. And then for the next three chapters he goes on to describing how that they would go through tribulation for 10 days and how they would be killed and so forth. And you can run it back in history and find out that it was during that same age that for 10 years they just slaughtered the Christians and how they died for the cause of Christ in that age. We see THE SEVEN STARS HERE WHERE GOD HAD SEVEN STARS AND GOD WAS GOING TO WORK THROUGH THOSE SEVEN STARS AND THERE WAS ALWAYS A change from one star to the other star to de Martin to Columba to Luther to Wesley to brother Brandham. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the Bible says when the mystery of God shall be finished. Amen. As he has declared unto his servants the prophets and after even after brother Brandham preached his message, he says on the back of the church. Can you imagine me preaching a message this morning and delaying it all out and then all of a sudden at the end of the service, amen, all of a sudden a a fog or a mist or something comes on the back of the WALL AND HE DRAWS IT OUT AND HE DRAWS IT JUST THE WAY THAT THE PROPHET HAD DRAWN IT OUT. VINDICATION that what he has said was the truth. Amen. I was telling MY WIFE THIS WEEK, I SAYS, YOU KNOW, IT'S QUITE SOMETHING HOW THAT WE HAVE A PICTURE THERE, AMEN, of brother Brandham and then we have a picture of the halo. Amen. OR THE PILLAR OF FIRE up there. Amen. Because when there's a big story that behind that again, I want to say it because Amen. There was a critic that wanted to Amen. uh to really be PROUD OF HIMSELF AND AMEN. and and rebuking the prophet SAY THERE'S NO SUCH A thing as healing. God doesn't heal anymore. There's no Holy GHOST AND EVERYTHING. HAD A BIG BEATING about it. Probably wouldn't even go to it. Amen. Until the angel said, "Yeah, go to it." And he sat IN THE BACK. AND WHILE FF BOSSWORTH, OR I believe it was one of him, was it FF Bossworth? AND HE TOOK THAT CRITIC ON. AMEN. And actually, he was having a debate. HE WANTED TO HAVE A DEBATE WITH THE PROPHET. AND HE SAID, "NO, I don't debate. I THE WORD OF God ain't for debating." And one of his friend, I believe it was Evard, WENT UP THERE. AMEN. I'LL TAKE HIM. AMEN. I'll do it. He says, "Well, that's up TO YOU." AND HE WENT UP THERE. AMEN. THIS FIRST MR. BEST WENT, he said, "There's no, you know, that healing and the Holy GHOST WAS ONLY FOR THE 12 DISCIPLES or whatever." YOU KNOW, AND and and healing wasn't for the New Testament. And Bosworth comes up and HE SAYS, "THE SEVEN COMPOUND redemptive names of Jehovah." Amen. Did it they APPLY TO JESUS OR NOT? AMEN. And Jehovah Raphi and Healer and all THESE OTHER THINGS, THEY ALL APPLIED TO JESUS. And he SAYS, "ANSWER ME. DO THEY APPLY?" AND MR. BEST couldn't answer the first question. He couldn't even ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION. HE WAS STUMPED WITH ONE QUESTION. AMEN. AND THEN AFTERWARDS, he had his photographers come up and put his finger up there and everything else. AMEN. AND OF ALL THE PICTURES THAT WERE TAKEN, THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE that came out. &gt;&gt; And Amen. George J. of the FBI, the government came and they inspected and they INVESTIGATED AND FIND OUT WHETHER THAT COULD BE A SUPERNATURAL PICTURE OR NOT. AND AND OUR OUR VERY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID THAT WAS NOTHING BUT A SUPERNATURAL PICTURE. IT WAS NOT DOUBLE EXPOSURE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AMEN. AND SEE GOD HIMSELF, HOW MANY SAID GOD HIMSELF IN OUR DAY, AMEN. I THOUGHT I THOUGHT YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE CRITICAL OF IT. YOU LET A HALO COME ON THE BACK OF YOU. YOU LET GOD STAND UP FOR YOU. MAYBE WE'LL HAND YOUR PICTURE UP THERE. AMEN. BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MAN. IT'S ABOUT THAT HALO. IT'S ABOUT THE PILLAR OF FIRE. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT IS the very HE SAID THAT'S THE SAME PILLAR OF FIRE THAT LED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. AND BECAUSE WE'RE LEAVING THE WE'RE SERVING a living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad that that God IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, and forever? &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT GOD AND WHAT JESUS CHRIST HAS DONE IN OUR AGE, oh my my my Amen. We'll pick that up here in a minute. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. AMEN. AS WE TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT, AMEN. ABOUT OBSTRUCTIONS. AMEN. THINGS THAT KEEP people from BELIEVING THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. THINGS THAT KEEP US FROM SURRENDERING TO GOD THE WAY that we're SUPPOSED TO. AMEN. AND I WE COULD GO BACK JUST TO THE VERY SAME VERY FIRST SCRIPTURE. AMEN. that we read Jesus. AMEN. IF YOU WANT TO COME AFTER ME, you're going to have TO GET SOME OBSTACLES OUT OF THE WAY. AMEN. AND THAT IS FIRST OF ALL YOUR OWN SELF. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT'S YOUR BIGGEST enemy is our own self. It's not the pastor. It's not this, that, OR THE OTHER. YOUR BIGGEST ENEMY IS YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So he says, IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO DIE TO YOURSELF, IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP YOUR OWN LIFE, YOUR OWN IDEAS, AMEN. AMEN. TO FOLLOW ME. YOU'RE NOT WORTHY TO FOLLOW ME CUZ WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR A SOUL? HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT THIS MORNING? AMEN. THAT'S WHY WE COME TO CHURCH. AMEN. WE GO TO WORK TOMORROW SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A LITTLE MONEY TO PUT A LITTLE FOOD ON THE TABLE TO SUSTAIN THIS FLESH. BUT WE COME ON SUNDAY. AMEN. AND WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT WILL FEED OUR SOUL. THAT'S WHAT WE COME TO CHURCH FOR BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT. JESUS SAID, "LABOR NOT FOR THE MEAT THAT PERISHES, BUT LABOR FOR THE MEAT THAT ENDURETH UNTO ETERNAL LIFE." AMEN. AND HIS WORD IS HIS MEAT. This is meat indeed. This is drink indeed. If you eat this, YOU'LL NEVER HUNGER AGAIN. AMEN. EAT THIS RIGHT HERE IN YOUR SOUL. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, OH, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THERE'S A BIG THING. AMEN. THE FIRST THING THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO, UNLESS A MAN IS BORN AGAIN, HE CANNOT SEE THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. So the first thing has to do is you got to die to yourself &gt;&gt; and be born again by what? By the spirit of God, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit. You can repent all you want to, confess all you want to, but when God can accepts that repentance, he accepts that sacrifice and he does something in your life and you have a changing time in your life, a turning point in my life. That's &gt;&gt; right. How many believes there has to BE A CHANGE? &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU WAS BEFORE. &gt;&gt; Not the same man. OH, I'M SO GLAD WHEN I WAS RIGHT AROUND 20 YEARS OLD DOWN IN PINECRAFT, SARASOTA, I SAID, "GOD, I WANT TO GIVE YOU MY LIFE. I GIVE YOU MY ALL. I GIVE ME A FUTURE. GOD, I JUST WANT YOU. I WANT YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. I'M YOURS, LORD." AND WELL, GOD FILLED ME WITH THE HOLY GHOST. WENT DOWN INTO THE CREEK. AMEN. REPENT EVERY ONE OF YOU AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. FOR THE PROMISE IS TO YOUR CHILDREN TO THEM THAT ARE FAR OFF EVEN AS MANY AS THE LORD OUR GOD SHALL CALL. THOMAS IN 2000 SOMETHING 1980 SOMETHING. AMEN. AS MANY AS GOD CALLS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But turning points, when God does something a little different, it's so hard for people to receive it because they've got obstacles in their way. Obstruction. Amen. &gt;&gt; Obstructions. Notice how I read there in Matthew or I I read not in Matthew, but yeah, it was Matthew. Amen. where he talked about how that you know when God made his supper, right? God made a dinner for everybody, got everything ready for everybody. And what did they do? They all with one consent began to make excuses. &gt;&gt; My, it's gonna be sad, isn't it? People that make excuses, &gt;&gt; their excuses are their obstacles, their obstructions. &gt;&gt; Many times Jesus SAID, "THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH SHALL RISE UP WITH THIS GENERATION AND CONDEMN HIM, CONDEMN IT." THE MEN OF NINEVEH ARE GOING TO RISE, BROTHER, I MEAN IN JESUS CHRIST'S GENERATION AND CONDEMN IT BECAUSE ALL THEY HAD WAS A PROPHET COMING OUT OF THE FIFTH AND THEY BELIEVED AND THEY REPENTED. JESUS COME ALONG AND RAISED LAZARUS FROM THE DEAD AND WANTED TO KILL HIM TO GET RID OF THE TESTIMONY. THEY COULDN'T THEY JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something right now. Believing is harder than you think. &gt;&gt; Much harder than what you think. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God &gt;&gt; to get you to believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believes it's hard to believe? &gt;&gt; When God does something that we're not expecting, that you don't expect, that's not the way you're taught, not the way that you have believed it. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; But is it according to the word of God? &gt;&gt; That's the first question. CUZ GOD DON'T ASK YOU. HE DON'T ASK ME. HE DON'T ASK NOBODY. HE SURE DON'T ASK THE POPE. HE DON'T ASK NO DISP. HE DOES WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. &gt;&gt; WE COME. OUR MIND HAS TO FIT HIS WAY. &gt;&gt; NOT HIS WAY. OURS. IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How many believes it's hard to believe? Let me let me just prove that to you. Would that be okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils. AND SHE WENT AND TOLD THEM THAT HAD been with him as they mourned and as they wept. And they when they heard THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND HAD BEEN SEEN OF HER believed not. &gt;&gt; IMAGINE HIS OWN DISCIPLES THAT WALKED WITH HIM. HE SAID EXPEDIENT THAT I DIE. AMEN. I'M GOING TO DIE AND RISE AGAIN THE THIRD DAY. &gt;&gt; HE TOLD THEM WHAT HE WAS going to do and WHEN IT HAPPENED THEY WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. EVEN HIS OWN DISCIPLES FOUND IT HARD to believe. &gt;&gt; It's hard to believe. That's hard to believe. Could God send a prophet? Could he send out Moses? COULD THERE BE ANOTHER NOAH? COULD THERE BE ANOTHER NO MOSES? Could there be another Elijah? I'll send you Elijah to before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. I mean, that was the Elijah of our day. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hard to believe, but it's not whether I say it or not. It's whether God proves it or not. &gt;&gt; You know how many times that this man right here would read John 14:12, he says, you know, the works that I do, Jesus says, shall ye do also, and greater than he these shall he do. And he would preach the gospel. Just heard him wonder the other day. And I'll tell you what, at the end of the service, they were all just worshiping the Lord. He came and he would SAY, "NOW, IF I'VE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH, IF JESUS DON'T COME AND PROVE it and vindicate it and DO WHAT HE DID BEFORE, BUT IF HE DOES DO TO COME AND DOES THE SAME THING WHEN HE WALKED THE SHORES OF GALILE GALILEE, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?" &gt;&gt; AND HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF TIMES NEVER failed that the Lord failed to come and discern the thoughts and intents of their heart. Same way we he did with the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; Amen. The sick were healed. &gt;&gt; THE LAME WALKED. &gt;&gt; AT LEAST 12 PEOPLE OR SO WERE RAISED FROM THE DEAD. &gt;&gt; People raised FROM THE DEAD. BUT STILL PEOPLE WON'T BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT ONLY GOD CAN RAISE THE DEAD, NOT A MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. My what God has done. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Listen to what brother Bam says. The greatest battle. How can you doubt anymore when you see the dead raised UP, THE LAME WALK, THE BLIND SAY, THE DEAF EAR. REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT UNBELIEF. DO YOU REALIZE JOHN THE BAPTIST HAD HIS DOUBTS? &gt;&gt; HE WAS IN PRISON AND HIS EAGLE EYE GOT FILMED OVER. HE SENT SOMEBODY OUT THERE TO ASK HIM IS HE REALLY THE MESSIAH THAT WAS TO COME &gt;&gt; BEFORE HE SAYS BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKETH ANYWHERE IN THE S OF THE WORLD. THIS FLESH AND THIS BODY AND THIS MIND it doesn't really want to believe. &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Is it really real? HOW MANY MEANS? IT'S REALLY REAL. And I believe we got to get past You've GOT TO GET PAST THE OBSTACLE OF UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; It's the BIGGEST OBSTACLE AS THERE IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And let me just say this, &gt;&gt; whether you believe or not in itself will send you to heaven or send you to hell. &gt;&gt; Whether you believe it or whether you don't believe it, we'll send you to heaven or send you to hell. &gt;&gt; A big statement coming from a preacher, but we're supposed to make the truth. We're going to supposed to make a statement. How many like a scripture for it? Sure. I wouldn't say anything. It wouldn't be scripture. Mark 16. Oh, let me let me just go further here. And when they heard that he was alive and seen of her, THEY BELIEVED NOT. AFTERWARDS, HE APPEARED TO in another for two of them as they walked and went into the country. And they went and told it to the residue, and neither did THEY BELIEVE HIM. HEY, I SAW IT. TOMMY, I SAW HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I SAW HIM. HE TALKED WITH US ON THE ROAD TO EMMAS AND HE SHOWED HE DID THIS VERY SAME THING. BREAK THE BREAD. AMEN. AND I KNEW IT WAS HIM. Can you imagine if Tommy tell me said, "No, don't believe you Thomas. Don't believe you. I want to slap you." What do you mean? I'm your friend. I'M YOUR BROTHER. WHY CAN'T YOU BELIEVE ME? I CALL ME A LIAR. I'M NOT LYING. I'M TELLING THE TRUTH, BUT THEY JUST REFUSED. &gt;&gt; Thomas had such a stubborn spirit. He man, when they told him, EVEN THE DISCIPLES SAID, "MAN, I'M TELLING YOU, WE ALL SAW HIM." NOPE. IF I DON'T PUT MY HANDS IN HIS SIDE, AND IF I DON'T FEEL THE SCARS, I AIN'T GOING TO BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for the grace of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. The pastor that led me to Christ and to the message power. Amen. when he his wife was Menanite, they were Menanite and he would throw the books in the river and go and blow his horn outside the church and cause disturbances and he was against it. HE WAS COMPLETELY AGAINST IT. BUT ONE DAY IN THE KITCHEN, GOD BE TO OPEN HIS EYES. HE OPENED HIS UNDERSTANDING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And he believed that that GOD WAS THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; ALMOST BLASPHEMY AGAINST WHAT GOD HAD DONE. But God opened it. How many believes God has to open it? He has to open your mind and your heart. Amen. Obstacle of unbelief. Amen. Neither believe they them. Afterwards he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and araided them with for with their unbelief AND HARDNESS OF HEART. REMEMBER WHEN he uh in another in the other book when he was talking to them on the road to Emmus, ain't that right? AND THEY HAD SAID, "WHY ARE YOU SO TROUBLED? WHAT'S ALL WHAT ARE Y'ALL TALKING ABOUT?" WELL, THEY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MARY SAID THAT SHE SAW HIM AND THEY WENT THIS THAT OR THE OTHER. And then finally HE GOT TO TALKING. HE SAYS, "OH, FOOLS AND SLOW OF HEART TO BELIEVE ALL THAT THE PROPHETS HAVE SPOKEN." CAN WE SAY THAT THIS MORNING? THE WORLD IS SLOW TO BELIEVE. AMEN. THAT GOD DID MORE IN OUR GENERATION THAN WHEN HE WALKED THE SHORES OF GALILEE. He did much MANY MANY MORE MIRACLES WHEN HE WHEN HE WHEN HE IN THIS HOUR THROUGH THE PROPHET'S MESSAGE AND WHEN HE WAS ON THE SHORES OF Galilee &gt;&gt; and when he walked to work he had did many more works &gt;&gt; cuz he said then greater works will you do how MANY KNOWS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED GREATER WORKS EVEN AMEN TO SPEAKING THINGS INTO existence &gt;&gt; speaking to wild animals like bulls that was charging them and said I am a servant of the Lord I know I intrude upon your territory. And he was coming to kill him because he had killed somebody else already. But that bull come charging at him. He wasn't scared. The Holy Ghost come down. He spoke to him, turned around, go back where he come. He come within 10 or 15 yards of him and dug flying and then he dug his hoofs in and stopped. Great big old bull. Stopped. Looked this way. Looked that way. Turned around. Walked back where he was and laid down. Hello. Many many things like that. Many things where the power of God protected him. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let me finish this. So lo. So he said that's araided them for their hardness of heart BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED NOT THEM WHICH HAD SEEN HIM. AMEN. That's what we're trying to DO THIS MORNING. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? TELL THE WORLD, I WANT YOU to believe Jesus. I want you to believe WHAT GOD DID. THAT IS OUR MESSAGE TO THE WORLD that he CAME TO TRY TO GET EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION. THAT'S WHY HE STOOD LIKE ELIJAH DID ON MOUNT CARMEL, CHALLENGED ALL OF THE UH PROPHETS OF BAAL. IF YOUR GOD IS GOD, COME DOWN HERE AND LET HIM BURN YOUR SACRIFICE WITH FIRE. REMEMBER that &gt;&gt; brother Bham God through brother Bandham went to the 30,000 raw heathens over there the Hindu the Buddha and everybody was had taken him to their temples and showed him their belief and all this that or the other all the different religions he said come out to the service the next day and God had showed him that there was a blind man amen had in a vision that was going TO HAVE HIS EYESIGHT RESTORED AMEN HE WAS UP THERE HE SAYS YOU SEEKS YOU JAMES YOU BUDDHA YOU MUHAMMAD IF YOUR RELIGION AND YOUR GOD IS RIGHT. LET HIM COME UP HERE AND OPEN THIS BLIND MAN'S eyes and we'll follow YOUR RELIGION. HE SAID THAT was bunch you ever saw a right and he says no ice can't do it either. Hello. But the Jesus WHO I PROCLAIM, WHO I REPENT, IF HE DON'T COME AND OPEN HIS EYES, YOU PUT A PUT A SIGN ON MY BACK, FALSE PROPHET, AND YOU RUN ME OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But if he does come and do it, and he did. Amen. And people pull on him. And man, those people, oh man, them people over there, they make a god out of you if you do miracles like that. Almost. God come down and open his eyes. 30,000 raw heathens gave their hearts to God in one day. THE BOOK OF ACTS, IT WAS 3,000 THAT HAD AMEN. THAT 3,000 SOULS WERE ADDED ON THE day of Pentecost. BUT HEAR IT WITH 30,000. THAT'S 10 TIMES THE BOOK OF ACTS THAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR GENERATION. HALLELUJAH. NO WONDER THERE'S A SHOUT OF THE KING IN THE CAMP. AMEN. WHY? Because he was going to come and send ELIJAH BEFORE THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD. BEHOLD, THE DAY COMETH THAT SHALL BURN IN OVEN, AND ALL THE PROUD, AND ALL THAT DO WICKEDLY SHALL BE ASHES. THEY SHALL BE ASHES UNDER THE SOLES OF YOUR FEET IN THE day that I do this. That's right. It wasn't the acceptable year of the Lord. No, it was the great and dreadful day of the Lord, he was going to send it one more time. How many believes of all the different religions, all the different churches, all the different ways that there is. How many glad that God came and proved that Jesus is still the way? He is the truth. He is the life. THIS IS THE WAY. IT'S NOT ABOUT JOINING A CHURCH. IT'S ABOUT GETTING joined to Christ. &gt;&gt; By one spirit, ARE WE ALL BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY? THAT'S ON THE CHURCH. THAT'S HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO JOIN the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. I told you a while ago I was going to give you an explanation. And then he says, "And he said unto them, go ye into all THE WORLD AND PREACH THE GOSPEL to every creature." &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, belief will send you to heaven. Unbelief will send you to hell. HE THAT BELIEVETH AND IS BAPTIZED shall be saved. &gt;&gt; And he that believeth not shall be damned. &gt;&gt; That simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I'm glad WE AIN'T GOT TO SACRIFICE A BUNCH OF COWS, A BUNCH OF SHEEP, A BUNCH ALL THOSE THINGS. WE AIN'T GOT TO MAKE NO SACRIFICE. THE SACRIFICE ALREADY BEEN MADE. CHRIST HAS ALREADY PAID the price. All you got TO DO IS ACCEPT HIM. ACCEPT WHAT GOD HAS DONE. All you got TO DO IS LOOK AT THAT CROSS. AMEN. LIKE MOSES. AMEN. GOD SAYS, "PUT A SERPENT UP THERE." AMEN. A SERPENT REPRESENTED SIN. AMEN. ON THAT POLE REPRESENT CALVARY. AMEN. JUDGED. SIN JUDGED. AND ALL THEY HAD to do BACK THEN WAS LOOK AT IT. AMEN. HOW MANY PLEASE JUST OPEN THE EYES OF MY HEART, LORD. Open the eyes of my heart and let me realize that you have already paid the price. All you got to do is believe. Amen. Obstructions. How many knows it's the devil's business? It's his business to get into your mind &gt;&gt; and bring doubt. &gt;&gt; Make you doubt. bring obstructions in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; An obstruction. Notice how these people's obstruction was. They had married a wife. They had bought some land. They had gotten some oxen that they needed to prove. IT'S GOING TO BE A SAD DAY CUZ HOW MANY KNOWS GOD is going to make We're all accountable as human beings. We're all accountable. We're all going to have to give account &gt;&gt; for the air that we breathe &gt;&gt; for the decisions that we've made &gt;&gt; for what we've done. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. It's not at the It's not the end when you die and they put you in the ground. No. Uh-uh. Jesus rose from the dead. How many believes that? And one day he'll call everybody. LIKE HE SAID, HE'LL CALL THE GREAT, THE SMALL, THE DEAD. AMEN. THOSE THAT ARE IN THE OCEAN. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE. HE'LL CALL THEM ALL UP TO THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. AND IT WILL GIVE AN account for what they've done. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're accountable. And on that day, I can only imagine the excuses that people might have. Well, I well, my church didn't believe it that way. I just couldn't see it that way. It was against my religion. All kinds of little excuses. Amen. Mark 10. I'm in Luke. Mark 10. Jesus said to the rich young ruler. Let's look at the rich young ruler. He had some obstructions in his life, didn't he? He came to Jesus and asked him, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus said unto him, "Why callst thou me good? There's none good but one, and that is God. Thou knowest the commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Defra not. Honor thy father and thy mother." AND HE ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO HIM, "MASTER, WOW, this boy was a good boy." To look at Jesus in the face and say, "All these things have I observed from my youth." Never did Jesus say, "Ah, you're lying." Huh? But Jesus beholding him loved him. How many knows Jesus loves you? &gt;&gt; Jesus loves all of you. He loves everybody. The only reason that Putin hasn't pulled the trigger, hello, the nukes haven't gone off is because of the long suffering of Almighty God. Because the debauchery and the immorality, it is fit for another Sodom and Gomorrah burning &gt;&gt; and God will. Many ministers have said, and I say repeating, uh I'm not sure which one it was, but brother Brandham even repeated somebody else that had said it. If God doesn't destroy the world, destroy this Sodom age, these Sodommites, he says he'll he he'll be obligated to raise Sodom and Gomorrah up and apologize. He's a just God. Amen. He's not going to he going to do no apology, but he will reach out his hand. HE'LL REACH OUT HIS HAND. LONG SUFFERING IN THE DAYS OF NOAH 120 YEARS. &gt;&gt; This prophet's been off the scene since 1965. And here we are in 20 2025. It's been a long time, almost half a century. But God longsuffering. STILL HAS PREACHERS OUT HERE TELLING YOU ABOUT CHRIST AND WHAT CHRIST DID. IT'S EASY TO BELIEVE AND ACCEPT THE CHRIST DIED ON CALVARY. BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN WHEN JESUS COMES AND DOES THE VERY SAME THINGS THAT HE DID BACK THEN AND THEN REJECT THAT? THEN SAY, "NO, I don't believe it." You're still rejecting him. &gt;&gt; No matter what you say about the past. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Pharisees, how many know, let me get, let me get I want to talk about the Pharisees next, but here the rich young ruler. And Jesus BEHOLDING LOVED HIM AND SAYS, "ONE THING THOU LACKEST." He looked down in the heart of that rich young ruler &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "GO THY WAY and sell a third of what you have. &gt;&gt; Sell half of what you have." So you still have something. remember Zakius and different ones if they've cheated somebody I'll pay them fivefold I you know they made their own vow I'll pay whatever they wanted to pay and here Jesus could have demanded anything but he said go and sell whatsoever thou hast and give it to the POOR AND THOU SHALT HAVE TREASURE IN HEAVEN AND COME TAKE UP YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW ME. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT EVERY LAST ONE OF US HAS TO DO? BE WILLING TO FORSAKE ALL TO FOLLOW HIM. MOM, DAD, BROTHER, SISTER, AMEN. WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S NOT FOR CHRIST, YOU GOT TO BE WILLING TO FORSAKE ALL. GET THE OBSTRUCTION OUT OF YOUR WAY. NO OBSTRUCTIONS. CHRIST WANTS NO OBSTRUCTIONS. NOT BETWEEN ME, MY SOUL, AND my savior. Let nothing be between. Amen. How many believes Christ wants nothing between you &gt;&gt; and him? That's why he created the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive us. How many clad for forgiveness? Let the blood come down and wash you white, wash you clean, forgive your past. There is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the spirit. I mean after the flesh, but after the spirit. No condemnation to those that are in Christ. He took our judgment. &gt;&gt; God can't judge you because you already got judged in Christ. &gt;&gt; If you are in Christ, you have passed from death unto life. You have passed from condemnation. You have passed from judgment to life. The only way to not be into judgment because the Bible says he comes with 10 thousands of his saints to execute judgment. He comes with his wife in the white throne judgment. Daniel said to judge the world. Even Paul said, "Don't you know that the saints shall judge the world?" &gt;&gt; Amen. AND HE WAS SAD AT THAT SAYING, and then went away grief, FOR HE HAD GREAT POSSESSIONS. Here we get another lesson. Be careful that your possessions isn't what obstructs you from following the Lord holy. Remember the book of Acts? Remember Jesus, he didn't have a place to lay his head and he said, "Father workketh and I work hitherto." Brother Brad, that's my heart's desire is God shows me to do something &gt;&gt; and that's what I do. &gt;&gt; How many is with me? Don't you want to be that way? God shows me and that's what I do. That's all I care about. My meat is to do the father's will. &gt;&gt; All I care about is doing what God wants me to do. &gt;&gt; No obstructions, no ifands, or buts. But this young ruler, he had great possession, and it was the clog that sent him to hell. It was the one thing HE COULDN'T LET GO OF. IMAGINE COMING DOWN TO HIS DEATHBED. One place Jes Jesus talked about the rich man that had to build his barns bigger and all these other things. HE SAYS AND SAYS, "MAN, I'VE GOT SO MUCH NOW AND MY SOUL TAKE YOUR LEISURE. TAKE YOUR REST. YOU'VE GOT IT MADE NOW. YOU'RE READY FOR GOOD RETIREMENT." HE SAYS, "THOU FOOL, knowest not now not that this night thy soul shall be required of thee." Having that heart attack. And he says, "Boy, I sure wish I'd have made THAT CHOICE. I SURE WISH I'D HAVE DONE WHAT HE SAID. I WISH I'D HAVE HAD AN AUCTION. I WISH I'D SOLD IT ALL AND GAVE TO THE POOR. &gt;&gt; But it's too late then. How many knows when you come down to the door to death, it's too late?" Amen. After you take that last breath, there's always a deathbed experience. I don't say there's not that. Hello. But don't wait until that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. get your obstructions out of the way. So, be careful. Be careful of riches. Amen. Let me just finish this scripture here. And Jesus looked around about and said unto his disciples, "How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God?" And his disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answered again and said unto them, "Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, &gt;&gt; Amen, to enter into the kingdom of God? For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, for it than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom. And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, who then can be saved? And Jesus looking upon them saith, with men it's impossible, but with God, &gt;&gt; Amen, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you think about how much Jesus had, the disciples had, wouldn't we all have to say we're rich? &gt;&gt; Got houses, we got lands, we got house, you know, we got refrigerators full of food. &gt;&gt; Closets are overpiled. &gt;&gt; I've got so many shoes. I got to go store them here and there. But I'm one of those that all things are possible. Are you one of those? But with God, all things are possible. That's right. Because you don't worship that. You don't love that. You love him more than you do your stuff. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. talk about the Pharisees. Before we do that, let's just talk about King Agria for a minute, shall we? Let's talk about Agria. Let me see if I can find that right quick. Acts I didn't put my note paper in. Acts 26. remember Felix, I believe it was Fesus, Fesus and the Gri Grippa got together and they uh made Paul come out and you know given a answer for why they wanting to kill him so bad. And whereupon, O king Agria, I was not a disobedient to the heavenly vision. Remember Paul would testify of how that that light struck him down. Same as brother Bannon when he was young, seven years old. He was carrying water for his dad's steel and all and he says there's a whirlwind to come in a tree and it's A WHIRLWIND SPOKE OUT OF THAT TREE AND SAID don't drink, DON'T SMOKE OR DEFILE YOURSELF WITH WOMEN OR DEFILE your body IN ANY WAY FOR I HAVE A WORK FOR YOU TO DO. ONE TIME, BROTHER BANDHAM HAD A WHOLE group of people and ministers, a bunch OF PREACHERS WERE BACK AND BROTHER BANNED TO SAY THAT. HE BEGAN TO GIVE A testimony and he used THAT SCRIPTURE OF BROTHER PAUL OF WHAT PAUL SAID. I WAS NOT DISOBEDIENT. And when he began to say that, a whole back row of ministers walk out. They didn't want to hear nothing about what he claims that God said to him. Why? Oh, they believe Jesus hung on the cross and died for him. But when Jesus does something again just like it, no, I'm walking out on that. Do you think they're going to go guiltless? No, they're not going to walk out guiltless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Paul here was telling him, he says, and he and he he man, he just laid it OUT THAT JESUS DIED AND ROSE AGAIN FOR OUR JUSTIFICATION AND EVERYTHING. NOW, FESUS, he said uh uh that let me just pick the story up. Paul's talking that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto the peoples and to the Gentiles. And as he thus spake for himself, Fesus said with A LOUD VOICE, PAUL, THOU ART BESIDE THYSELF. MUCH LEARNING HAS MADE thee mad. In other words, there was not a lot of faith in Fesus, not a lot of belief in what Paul was saying. You studied too much. But he said, "I am not mad, most noblefastness, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. For the king knoweth of these things before how before whom I speak freely, for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For this thing is not done in a corner." King Agria, believest thou the prophets? I KNOW THAT THOU BELIEVEST the prophets. Then a grippa said unto Paul, "Almost thou persuadeest me to be a Christian." He just had one clog. There's one clog AND IT WAS THE ONE WORD ALMOST. ALMOST. I think we get that song. Persuaded. Almost isn't good enough. ALMOST ISN'T FAIR. IT DOESN'T GET YOU ANYTHING. ALMOST IS NOT ENOUGH. I IMAGINE HE HAD HIS THOUGHTS ON HIS DEATH. BUT OH, I ALMOST DID. Regions of the lost. Almost I believed. ALMOST I ACCEPT IT. But he had that clog of unbelief. He had his prestige. He didn't want to become one of Paul's heretics, what they called crazy man. Hello. See, all Paul did, he's he went around saying what God told him and what God did. That's what the prophet did. Same thing. You know, God commissioned me and the angel commissioned me. Amen. Angel says, "You're going to pray pray for kings and monarchs and potentates and so forth. going to go around the world. Why? Because it's not about brother Brandham. It's about Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's about grace. It's about salvation to this generation. It's about a clear path and without a question so many times. Amen. I love the vindication. Amen. Listen to this. WHERE WHERE THE PHARISEES, WHY WERE THEY BLIND? WHAT MADE THEM SO BLIND? Brother man preached a message called in GOD UNVEILING HIMSELF. HE TALKED ABOUT THE VEIL OVER ISRAEL'S EYES WAS A VEIL of tradition. THEY SAID JESUS WHY DON'T THE DISCIPLES KEEP THEIR TRADITION THEY MADE THEY WASH FOOD THEY EAT WITHOUT WASHING THEIR HANDS. YOU KNOW IT'S BECOME SUCH A TRADITION AS A WASH pots and pans and all these things and Jesus said YOU BY YOUR TRADITION HAVE MADE THE WORD OF GOD OF NONE EFFECT TO THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Pharisees had obstruction. You know what it was? Jealousy. They were jealous of him. They envied him and THEY HAD PRIDE. HOW MANY KNOW THEY HAD PRIDE? HE SAYS YOU PRAY IN THE STREETS AND SO FORTH TO BE SEEN OF MEN. HE LOVED THE UPPERMOST SEATS AND SO FORTH. He liked to BE THE BIG SHOT. HE LIKED TO BE SPEAK SOMEBODY. They had pride and they had murder in their hearts. All these things were obstructions. Why couldn't they accept them? Jesus. Oh boy. He really scorched them. You say, "Why preacher do you have to be hard on churches and people?" I'll tell you why. It's because they reject Jesus Christ. You know who you know who Jesus was the hardest on the Pharisees. He says YOU'RE HE SAID WE'RE NOT WE WE AREN'T uh born of fornication. THEY CALLED HIM BEZIBUB. YOU'RE BEUB. Jesus replied says no you are of your FATHER THE DEVIL BECAUSE MY WORD HAS ITS PLACE IN YOU. SO THE DEVIL IS YOUR FATHER. HE WAS A MURDERER FROM THE BEGINNING. HE FINALLY GOT OUT AND REALLY YOU'RE OPEN SEPARS. YOU'RE OUTSIDE YOU LOOK HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS, BUT INSIDE YOU'RE FULL OF DEAD MEN'S BONES. &gt;&gt; You hypocrites. YOU HYPOCRITES. YOU HYPOCRITES. YOU CLAIM TO KNOW GOD, BUT YOU DON'T. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; First make clean the outside. The inside will claim clean. Is hard on hypocrites. And Jesus was the hardest are the most religious people of his day. &gt;&gt; Religious people. God's ordained people. Ain't that right? Israelites. He was hard on them. He tried his best to get their get them to receive it, but they would not. And then what he said? Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, my heart would have hovered thee as A HEAD OF THE ROOF, BUT YOU WOULD NOT. NOW you are left desolate. When he was going to Calvary, the women and everybody crying and weeping. HE GOING TO CALVARY. BLOOD EVERYWHERE. BLOOD RUNNING DOWN LIKE A BLOODY DEER TRAIL. EVEN MUCH WORSE THAN THAT. JUST BLOOD. COULDN'T GO ANYMORE. YOU AND I would weep. He looked at him in the eyes and he says, "Don't weep for me. Don't weep for me, BUT WEEP FOR YOURSELF. WEEP FOR YOUR CHILDREN. BECAUSE HE KNEW 70 YEARS LATER, TITUS WOULD ENCAMP ROUND ABOUT JERUSALEM. LET HIM THAT'S ON THE HOUSETOP. MAN, DON'T LEAVE YOUR DON'T TAKE YOUR STUFF. GET OUT OF THERE. CHRISTIANS WERE BORN OF THE HOLY GHOST. THEY GOT OUT OF THERE, BUT HE BESIEGED IT. And it was such a terrible thing until they ate each other's bait the bark off the tree. Titus wiped the thing down to where one stone wasn't upon another. Knocked it down. Hello. Because he seen what was going to happen because of their rejecting. But they had they had something that hindered them. They had an obstruction. Amen. Jesus himself was tested and tried of the devil. The devil tried to obstruct Jesus. Amen. the temptation in the wilderness up in ra Matthew 5 when he was up on the mountain the devil comes to him and he says man IF THOU BE THE SON OF GOD you're hungry SAYS AFTER THAT FAST JESUS WAS A hunger I don't know about you but after 40 days I'd be hungry would you be hungry after 5 hours brother I'm hungry let alone three days or a week or a MONTH I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHEN THAT WHEN THAT FAST THING WENT OFF OF HIM I fasted one day three days I guess when life was hard very hard and I was desperate for three days I guess that's probably the longest I hadn't eaten but most of the time when you have a fast even the prophet says you know you don't even get hungry you don't have no desire to eat but when that left when Jesus said he was hungry and the devil come and says make stones into bread all he wanted him to do was obey HIM JUST DO WHAT I ASK YOU TO THEN HE AGAIN, IT WOULDN'T WORK. NO MAN SHALL not live by BREAD ALONE, BUT BY EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDTH OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? YOU CAN'T LIVE JUST BY A DAY GONE BY. YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE BY EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDTH OUT OF THE MOUTH of God. Amen. IF YOU EVER GET THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IN YOUR HEART, YOU'LL BELIEVE EVERY WORD OF THIS CUZ THE HOLY SPIRIT WROTE THIS. WE BELIEVE ALL OF THIS WORD, NOT JUST A PORTION OF IT. &gt;&gt; OH, we believe it, but we DON'T BELIEVE IN FORNOWLEDGE. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN PREDESTINATION. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT OUR NAMES WERE WRITTEN IN THE LAMP BOOK OF LIFE FROM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. THAT'S JUST TOO SCARY. NO, IT'S NOT TOO SCARY. GOD SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT. I DON'T CARE IF IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU OR NOT. HE KNEW BEFORE HE EVER STARTED THIS THING. HE WROTE EVERYBODY'S NAME. HE KNOWS WHO WILL. HE KNOWS WHO WON'T. THAT'S WHY IF YOU BAPTIZE WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IN THE CHRISTIAN, YOU OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD CUZ YOU KNOW AND BELIEVE THAT YOUR NAME WAS ON THAT BOOK. AMEN. And you're willing TO FORGET. AMEN. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE CLOGGED UP BY YOUR PREVIOUS TEACHING. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE CLOGGED UP BY YOUR CHURCH'S TEACHING. NO. THOSE CHURCH TEACHINGS, IT WILL CLOG YOU UP. THE TRADITIONS OF MEN, AMEN, WILL BLIND YOU. IT'LL PUT A A CLOAK IN you believing all of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That veil of tradition. Well, our church don't teach that. I don't care what your church and tell us what to believe and that's his word. &gt;&gt; Your teach Your church teaches one tradition of man that's not according to the word. It's making the word of God of none effect. You're voiding THE WORD OF GOD. IT HAS TO BE ACCORDING TO THE WORD. WHAT I TEACH, WHAT THIS CHURCH TEACHES, IT'S GOT TO BE THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; No adding to it, no taking away from it. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet came. That's why God came and BROUGHT AGAIN US BACK TO WHAT PAUL TAUGHT. IF AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN COME AND TEACH ANYTHING THAT OTHER THAN I PREACH, LET HIM BE A CURSED. BIG PAUL SAID &gt;&gt; that's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; So many things that God the devil will do. Amen. To try to bring an obstruction to keep you from serving the Lord with all your heart, all your mind, all your soul, &gt;&gt; all your strength. Amen. Young people the same way. They'll try to bring in obstruction. Somehow that's his business. It's his business. David, how many knows David was a man of God? He was mighty. He was cruising along real good. He was king. But one day Beth Sheeba come along. Ain't that right? And he yielded to temptation. Yielded to the devil's temptation. And there was a clog in his life that caused him his wives to be ravished, him to be exiled, caused him so much trouble &gt;&gt; cuz he allowed a clog to come in his life. &gt;&gt; How about Samson? He was going along killing heaps upon heaps. Ain't nobody could take him down. No, not a whole. No matter how many armies come. &gt;&gt; It's something. Don't you love God? If God tries wants to do something, he can take one person &gt;&gt; and he can defeat the whole world. &gt;&gt; Sam wouldn't have had to stop at a thousand Philistines. God just chose to do it that way. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Moses, just a man with a stick went down there. Amen. I can't say with just a stick. He went down there with a stick. And the most important part, God. &gt;&gt; GOD'S COMMISSION. GO DOWN THERE AND tell him to let my people go. &gt;&gt; GOD HELP US TO HEAR A VOICE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT SAYING, "LET MY PEOPLE GO. SET THEM FREE." AMEN. BECAUSE WHO THE SON SETS FREE IS FREE INDEED. HOW MANY want to be FREE INDEED? I'VE GOT NO OBSTRUCTIONS IN MY LIFE. I'M AS HAPPY AS A BIRD AND JUST AS FREE. HOW MANY IS HAPPY? HOW MANY IS FREE? Free to serve God WITH ALL OF YOUR HEART. LET GO AND LET GOD HAVE HIS WAY. GET RID OF THE DESTRUCTIONS IN YOUR LIFE. COME ON, WORSHIP HIM A LITTLE. HE LOVES HIS WORSHIP. HE'S WORTHY OF PRAISE. HE'S MIGHTY IN BATTLE. HE HAS TAKEN MY CHAINS OFF MY LEGS AND OFF MY HANDS. THE CHAINS THAT BOUND ME, I'M NOT BOUND ANYMORE. I'M NOT BOUND BY GUILT. I'M NOT BOUND BY SIN. &gt;&gt; How many slad for the freedom &gt;&gt; that comes with Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Once like a prison I dwelt no freedom from my sorrow for I felt and Jesus came and listened TO ME AND GLORY TO GOD HE SET ME FREE. HE SET ME FREE. He set me free. He broke the bond OF PRISON FOR ME. I'M bound his I'm glory bound my Jesus to see for glory to God he said &gt;&gt; me free &gt;&gt; WOO FREEDOM NO OBSTRUCTIONCTIONS MY PAST IS TAKEN CARE OF MY FUTURE SECURE IT'S WOO! GOD, I'M GLAD THAT HE SET ME FREE. I'M NOT GLAD I'M NOT BOUND SOME TRADITION OF PER OF MAN AND SOME CHURCH CREED. I'M GLAD I'M NOT BOUND BY SIN. AREN'T YOU? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise be to God. Moses, Amen. did great. delivered the children of Israel by God's hand. Went out there in the wilderness. Ain't that right? But he had a little problem, a little bit of flesh problem yet. Amen. Amen. And children cried for water. Is that right? And he got a temper and struck drugs ROCK TWICE. BECAUSE of his temper, God said, "Because you promoted yourself, glorified yourself, you're not going to go see the land. I'm going to take you home. I have to take you home on this side. He wasn't lost. Amen. But his temper his way. He had an obstruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother makes a statement. It is as if this church now could be put together and knitted together such that every person would be in one accord. One accord with one shadow of a doubt anywhere. There would not be a feeble person in our midst in the next five minutes. THERE WOULD BE NOBODY DESIRING THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. HOW MANY WANTS TO BE THAT FREE? GOD TAKE EVERY OBSTACLE AWAY. AMEN. IF YOU AIN'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST, RAISE YOUR HAND SAY I ACCEPT THE HOLY GHOST RIGHT NOW. I BELIEVE IT'S MINE. TAKE DOUBT AWAY. FILL ME WITH YOUR SPIRIT, GOD. &gt;&gt; FILL ME with more of your spirit in the next five minutes. Amen. But what would receive it if you could just get that something that certain thing thick? He talks about it. Amen. Sometime Amen. when I was back home and we'd have corn out and so forth and the branch would break off perhaps. Amen. and a it would come down and lean on that stock and that stock would become deformed. Wouldn't grow right, wouldn't produce nothing. Moss perhaps would grow on it. Hello. He says that's the way it is when you let some obstruction come in your life. You're not the kind of Christian that ought to be. That's why we still have uh Christians that with characters and and part of their nature isn't what it's supposed to be &gt;&gt; because something gets in the way. So I close this morning with this thought and this question. Ask yourself because only you know and maybe you don't know what it is that's keeping you from giving your life to the Lord Jesus Christ the way that he said that we're supposed to. Forsake your own life, your own ideas, your own ways. Die to yourself. Amen. So that you can say like Paul says, "Amen." That he died daily and the life that he now lived, he didn't live of himself, but he lived by the faith of the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that faith has no hindrances. There's nothing that hinders faith. Faith comes and wipes every hindering thing out of your life, the past, sin, whatever it might be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I said, maybe you don't know because it takes the Holy Spirit. How many believes it takes the Holy Spirit in your heart to really show you &gt;&gt; where your faults are. &gt;&gt; I thank the Lord every day. Lord, show me where I have a clog. Show me where I'm not where I brother Tommy. Why I still don't reflect Christ the way that I should. Because I'll tell you this right now. We're here as God's temple, as God's &gt;&gt; We're God's hands. We're God's lips. We're God's feet. We're God's actions. Everything we do ought to be Christlike. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christians, we're Christlike. &gt;&gt; Stand with me. Close your eyes and say, "God, I'm taking these next few minutes now. And I want you to shine your light down in my life. Tell me in my mind, in my heart, whether there is an obstruction, show me my obstruction. What is it that hinders me? from loving you the way that I'm supposed to love you. &gt;&gt; From walking with you like Enoch did and did only what pleased you before he left. He had that testimony. We're fixing to go in the rapture any time. The world is fixing to get blown up and burn because that's the last thing that happens after God sent that Elijah. The day cometh that shall burn as an oven. The world is going to experience that oven. But God help them. God save every savable soul this morning. Lord, you see every heart. How in our marriages sometimes God will I mean the devil will come in perhaps bring a quarrel between husband and wife. He'll bring anything that he can to bring an obstruction any way that he possibly can. Anything. But you think about it. Let the Holy Spirit prick your heart. What's keeping you? What's keeping you from fully serving Jesus Christ? From believing him 100%. From surrendering yourself like we started with the song about surrendering. I surrender my all. God, that's what we want. We want to surrender our all. We don't want to like the seed that was cast by the wayside that by and by the devil just comes and the seed that was sewn in the heart. We come to church and we're out of church for a day or two and it's gone because the devil kind of knocked it out. Took it out of our heart, took it out of our minds. or the one that fell by the on the rocks didn't have any ground and because of trials and tribulation and persecution arises by and by we're offended because we get persecuted. We get told that we're in a cult we get told that we're wrong that this is wrong and we can't handle it. Lord help us not to be that way. We don't have that clog. But Lord, I ask God, as you said on the last one, he says, you know, there's another kind that fell. And because of the cares of life, because of riches and the cares of life, the word was choked out. God, help this church. God, help each one, Father, this morning never to get too busy. never to let the cares or the riches of choke out that walk that we have with you, that real love feeling that we have for you, that daily walk of devotion that we have with you, Lord, Father. But let it fall on good ground, deep soil, a predestinated seed that has got deep roots that it doesn't matter what wind blows. Doesn't matter if it's a hurricane category four or five that tree holds because it's rooted in the word, Father. And I pray that that would be each and every person in here, Lord. The winds are blowing, Lord. The temptations are out there. Satan's like a roaring lion coming in like a flood. But Lord, you set up a standard against it. And we pray God this morning if there's anybody in here, Lord, that needs the removal of some of these things that clog them up, Lord, that have obstructions, may they raise their hand and say, "God, I know now where my obstruction is, and I now surrender my obstruction to you." I say, "God, take this obstruction. Take this thing away that keeps me from walking with you like I should. Keep it that takes my joy from me that Lord, I PUTS A FROWN ON MY FACE. GOD, I pray take it away. Let me have that joy unspeakable and full of glory. Lord, you see all the hands. Lord, if your prophet was here, he was gifted with being able to tell what people were thinking, what was wrong with him. And that was not him. That was you. That was you, Lord, doing that. And father, that gave us the knowledge and the understanding that you do know the thoughts and the intents of every one of our hearts this morning. And you see why those hands are raised. And we ask God that you'd be merciful this morning. And that you would remove, Father, when we come back together on Wednesday, Lord, these people who have their hands up, they're not going to be the same as what they came to church this morning. No. Because they've surrendered. out of a better people than what we've come. We're better people to serve you than what we've come. We ask you to forgive us of our shortcomings, our failures. Lord, our sins that we don't even realize, cleanse us, make us white as snow, and set us free. We ask God that you'll take every hand, Lord. Bring us closer to you, Lord. Remove those obstacles, whatever it might be, and especially unbelief. Take it from us, Lord Jesus. Help us to believe all that the prophets have spoken. All that you have said, Lord, we want to believe all of it. Father, receive it into our hearts and to become the kind of Christians that you're one of these days according to your word. We which are alive and remain unto your coming shall not prevent our asleep, but we'll be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye, Father, at the last trump, Lord. And we're looking for that change to take place. We want to be part of that group, God, that goes into rapture to meet all the saints of all the ages to come in the air to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. We ask God that you'd prepare every heart this morning now in Jesus name we ask it. And we surrender ourselves to you. Amen. And amen. God bless you musicians. If you That was fast. One of them anyway. Yeah. Have y'all become? How many loves the Lord? &gt;&gt; And I trust that the Holy Spirit spoke to you this morning. Amen. How many believes Jesus wants that obstruction away from you? He wants to have fellowship with you tomorrow when you're on your job, your home, the afternoon, wherever you are. He wants to speak with you. He wants HE WENT TO CALVARY SO THAT HE could have fellowship with you. so that you could cast all your cares upon him for he carth for you. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. God bless you, church. Amen. The more that I surrender, the lighter my load. The more that I release my cares, the more you take control. And the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. And if the more that I surrender, the lighter my Lord. The more that I release my cares, the more you take control. The more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all the kingoms of my heart. And Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all the kingoms of my heart. Oh Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. The kingoms of my heart. Jesus I surrender. Oh and Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all the king. my heart and his mercy rolled my life. His mercy rero my life and I should have fallen. My soul cast down but mercy rero my life. Oh his mercy rero my life. His mercy rero my love and I should have fallen my soul cast down but mercy preo my Amen. It's been good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. I wonder if just before we go if we could sing, I bless your name. I bless your name. Oh, I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor, give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name in prisoners chains with pleading stripes. Paul and Silus prayed that night and in their pain began to sing. Their chains were loosed and they were free. Oh, I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor. Give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. and some midnight out. If you should find your inner pray in your mind, reach out and praise and defy those chains and they will in Jesus name. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor. Give you praise. You are the life and the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name for you are the life and the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. Amen. Amen. Brother Glenn, would you just dismiss us in prayer this morning as we go? Amen. You're dismissed this evening and we'll see you Wednesday, good Lord willing. Amen. I bless your name.
