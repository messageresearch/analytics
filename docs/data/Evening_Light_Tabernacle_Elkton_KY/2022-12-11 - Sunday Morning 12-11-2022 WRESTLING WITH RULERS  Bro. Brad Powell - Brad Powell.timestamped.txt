[26:17] let's turn to Psalms the 34th chapter
[26:20] and we'll begin with verse 9.
[26:23] down to the end of the chapter
[26:33] Psalms 34
[26:41] verse 9 all begin o fear the lord ye his
[26:45] Saints no want to them that fear Him
[26:56] Amen Let me just stop there for a second
[26:58] I like everybody's kind of getting on
[27:00] the same
[27:01] no amen it's nice when everybody we have
[27:05] to learn as a group to do that right
[27:06] amen and it takes time A lot of reading
[27:09] together but that was good Come Ye
[27:11] children hearken unto me and I will
[27:14] teach you the fear of the Lord
[27:21] thank you
[27:25] keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips
[27:28] from speaking guile
[27:36] the eyes of the Lord are upon the
[27:38] righteous and his ears are open unto
[27:40] their cry
[27:50] righteous cry and the Lord Hearth and
[27:53] delivereth them out of all their
[27:55] troubles
[28:04] many are the afflictions of the
[28:06] righteous but the Lord delivereth them
[28:08] him out of them all
[28:16] evil shall slay the wicked and they that
[28:18] hate the righteous shall be desolate
[28:21] the Lord redeemeth the soul of his
[28:24] servants and none of them that trust in
[28:27] him shall be desolate may God bless you
[28:30] this morning brother David
[28:31] brother Brian I mean
[28:44] brothers and sisters
[28:48] I was actually going to go to
[28:52] Mark the 11th chapter but
[28:56] don't go somewhere else
[28:59] my memory isn't bad
[29:12] has everyone had a good week
[29:17] I asked you all pray for me
[29:20] I have to deal with the Leviathan this
[29:23] week I have to go see the VA again and
[29:25] it's not my
[29:26] for everything I want to do
[29:45] if you tell with me the Corinthians
[29:48] First Corinthians the 13th chapter
[29:51] just pray for Jeanette my better half
[29:53] she's I can tell from the assembly
[29:57] I had the common cold this week and
[29:59] she's suffering with it this morning
[30:03] uh I was just thinking this morning as
[30:05] brother Thomas was reading out of that
[30:07] psalm and I was reading in mark this
[30:11] morning
[30:12] in the in the gospel of Mark you know
[30:17] we have no you know the scripture says
[30:19] in Hebrews we seek a city to come and
[30:23] there is no I'm paraphrasing there's no
[30:25] continuing I'm paraphrasing there's no
[30:27] continuing City here and I hope isn't in
[30:31] the things of this world but in the
[30:33] things to come does it like brother
[30:35] Thomas and brother Branham and all the
[30:37] preachers say does it mean you don't do
[30:39] what you need to do every day to provide
[30:41] for your family and to take care of your
[30:43] children no you keep doing that but
[30:46] that's not our hope our hope is what's
[30:48] to come the thing that God said in his
[30:50] word that he'll provide for us on that
[30:53] day and it's a thing that should keep
[30:55] you stayed in the age and you read that
[30:58] some we just read our whole purpose is
[31:01] to keep away from Evil and just to seek
[31:04] good and do what God desires us to do in
[31:08] the day that we live right now and I was
[31:10] I'll just read this and sit down this
[31:12] 13th chapter and there's other chapters
[31:15] in Corinthians you can go back to
[31:17] chapter five also where uh but if this
[31:21] body be dissolved I have another one
[31:24] waiting it's the hope that lays in us
[31:26] this morning and I'll just read this
[31:29] this morning and I was also thinking you
[31:32] know we're a privileged people you know
[31:34] you hear ministers say that continually
[31:36] we're a privileged people but does it
[31:39] really seep down into your heart and
[31:41] into your life do you do you really
[31:43] believe you're a privileged person that
[31:46] God has asked me in this age that we're
[31:48] living
[31:49] has decided to speak to your heart this
[31:52] morning and speak to you as an
[31:53] individual and put you on a path that's
[31:55] going to take you to
[31:57] Eternity one day you know sometimes we
[31:59] forget who we really are you know like
[32:02] brother Thomas was saying the church is
[32:05] actually living really below its
[32:07] privileges this morning if it really
[32:09] knew who it was or what it was I got to
[32:11] raise my hand sometimes I'm that way too
[32:13] I forget who I am and what God has done
[32:15] for me too we're all human beings but if
[32:18] you could really lay hold of what God
[32:20] has in store for you and how God sees
[32:23] you this morning you would have a great
[32:25] whole brain in your heart and life this
[32:27] morning and let me just read this
[32:31] forgiven my uh nasal voice this morning
[32:34] but let's just read this this morning
[32:36] though I speak with the tongues of men
[32:38] and angels and have not charity I've
[32:41] become the sounding brass or tank horn
[32:43] symbol you know no one gets out of here
[32:45] with Divine without Divine charity the
[32:47] love of God in your heart
[32:49] and though I gift of Prophecy though I
[32:53] have the gift of Prophecy and understand
[32:54] all Mysteries and all knowledge though I
[32:58] have all Faith so that I could remove
[33:00] mountains and have not charity I am
[33:04] nothing so Paul's saying here like any
[33:06] Minister would say I have all these
[33:08] great gifts I've done all these great
[33:10] things with God's help but they don't
[33:12] mean anything if I don't have the love
[33:14] of God in my heart it's no different for
[33:16] you and me this morning
[33:18] and goes on to say here although I
[33:20] bestow all my goods defeat the poor and
[33:22] though I give my body to be burned and
[33:25] have not charity it profit me nothing
[33:27] you know that's a horrible thought you
[33:29] know to live your whole life believing a
[33:31] lie and thinking you're doing the right
[33:33] thing and it didn't matter that's a
[33:36] horrible thing and he goes on to say
[33:38] charity suffering long in His Kind
[33:41] charity Envy if not charity not itself
[33:45] and it's not puffed up so that's the
[33:47] difference between true love and you
[33:50] know just normal Earthly love you know
[33:52] you're always going to prefer people not
[33:54] to say that you're going to let all the
[33:56] time people walk over the top of you but
[33:58] the way you will deal with people will
[34:00] be in a way of love and not in the way
[34:03] of conflict and goes on to himself does
[34:06] not behave itself unseemly sick of not
[34:09] around it is not easily provoked
[34:11] thinking no evil and if you want other
[34:13] chapters that deal with this the first
[34:15] three chapters or Proverbs talk about
[34:18] this principle in this verse if you read
[34:20] those first three chapters and he goes
[34:23] on to say rejoice not in iniquity but
[34:26] rejoice in the truth
[34:28] Earth all things believeth all things
[34:30] hope it's all things
[34:32] adoreth all things
[34:34] she already never faileth but whether he
[34:36] be whether there be prophecies they
[34:38] shall fail
[34:39] whether there be tongues they shall
[34:41] cease whether there'll be knowledge it
[34:43] shall vanish away and we all it's the
[34:45] same for us all
[34:47] unless God raptures us we'll all have an
[34:49] appointment one day and we're not going
[34:51] to get away from it and it goes on to
[34:54] say for we know in part when we prophesy
[34:57] in our but when that which is perfect
[34:59] has come then that which is in part
[35:01] shall be done away
[35:03] and then this is really important when I
[35:05] was a child I speak as a child and I
[35:08] understood as a child and though as a
[35:10] child but when I became a man I put off
[35:12] childless things and that's you know
[35:14] people can say it but you really got to
[35:16] believe it you know people will say the
[35:19] days of playing church are over you have
[35:21] to be a mature Christian you but unless
[35:25] you believe it I mean it'll never take a
[35:27] hold of you in your life and it goes on
[35:29] to say for
[35:31] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[35:34] but face to face I know in part but then
[35:36] so I know even as I am known now abide
[35:39] by the faith hope charity but these
[35:42] three the greatest of these is charity
[35:44] and I know I talked last week about hope
[35:46] you know faith hope and charity those
[35:48] are the three principles we're all weigh
[35:50] on this morning and uh I was just simple
[35:53] to finish with that I thought No One's
[35:55] Gonna Get out of this life without
[35:56] Divine charity without the love of God
[35:58] in your heart and life this morning and
[36:00] that's a great hope that we have this
[36:02] morning that God has given us that
[36:04] ability
[36:05] excuse me to possess that
[36:08] vacuum their very Divine love of God can
[36:11] be in your heart and life this morning
[36:13] I'm not wanting to be repetitive but
[36:15] it's an awesome thought to think this
[36:16] morning
[36:17] that God cared about you enough
[36:20] that he's willing to put his spirit
[36:22] inside you and at the same time with the
[36:25] love of God abiding you so that you can
[36:27] be who he wants you to be in the age
[36:28] that we're living Brother David
[36:31] thank you
[36:43] ignore that this morning
[36:45] what you call short and sweet
[36:47] I mean I enjoyed that this morning very
[36:50] much and
[36:51] sitting back there thinking this brother
[36:53] Brian was speaking and I thought

[1:02:09] last verse means a lot to me my mother
[1:02:11] died June the 6th
[1:02:13] this June will be 21 years
[1:02:16] about two weeks before my mom died my
[1:02:18] dad calls me on a Monday morning
[1:02:21] and he said Dad son he said your mom's
[1:02:23] going to die
[1:02:24] she was eat up with cancer and I said I
[1:02:26] know Dad she's gonna die he said no
[1:02:29] she's going to die today
[1:02:32] and I worked for myself and I had some
[1:02:34] things I had to do and I said well Dad
[1:02:37] she was going to be no he said she's
[1:02:39] gonna die today
[1:02:41] so I had to go take care of some
[1:02:43] business and they kept calling me all
[1:02:45] morning
[1:02:46] they kept telling me where are you at
[1:02:49] and I said what is going on they said
[1:02:51] your mom's gonna die
[1:02:53] I thought Lord of Mercy
[1:02:56] I said I'll be there as soon as I could
[1:02:58] and I was about an hour and 20 minutes
[1:03:00] away from home and they called me the
[1:03:02] last time my brother-in-law did and he
[1:03:04] said David where are you at I said I'm
[1:03:06] fixing to leave Jonesboro
[1:03:08] he said your mom's fixing to die
[1:03:11] so I called a friend of mine it's a
[1:03:13] state trooper and I said Wendell I said
[1:03:15] I told him when I was driving I said I'm
[1:03:17] not going to be crazy but I'm not going
[1:03:20] to be driving the speed limit either and
[1:03:21] I'm going to have my emergency flashers
[1:03:23] on I've got to get home
[1:03:26] so I drove home as fast as I could get
[1:03:28] there and when I got there my family
[1:03:31] from Tennessee was already in Arkansas I
[1:03:34] was the only one that wasn't there
[1:03:36] they had already come over because my
[1:03:38] mom was going to die
[1:03:39] so I come in there and it was hot
[1:03:42] and she'd give me a hug and she said
[1:03:44] where you been I said I had to work mama
[1:03:45] had something I had to take care of
[1:03:48] she said well you're all sweaty

[1:03:52] I said they've been on me all morning
[1:03:54] what's the matter she said I'm fixing to
[1:03:56] go home and Mom was sleeping in a little
[1:03:58] single bed in a little room
[1:04:01] and there was a picture of an Angel up
[1:04:03] there as we began to curb pray and cry
[1:04:06] with her and sing with her she began to
[1:04:08] talk to people that was going over
[1:04:11] she began to talk about them
[1:04:14] well she didn't die
[1:04:16] the next morning I called her and I said
[1:04:18] Mama
[1:04:19] how you doing she said I'm doing great I
[1:04:21] went and seen her and I talked to her
[1:04:22] and I said you remember yesterday she

[1:04:38] verse means a lot to me I'm gonna sing
[1:04:40] it again you can sing it with me well I
[1:04:43] was there The Day My Mama went to heaven
[1:04:50] I held her hands as she closed her eyes

[1:05:02] up Ten Thousand
[1:05:05] Angels take her soul away
[1:05:09] to be crowned the Jesus feet I believe
[1:05:15] and I believe

[1:09:07] morning
[1:09:08] I'll tell you it's uh thank you for
[1:09:10] musicians we appreciate it
[1:09:12] certainly good song service and
[1:09:14] Brother David I just want to let you
[1:09:16] know Jesus is coming soon
[1:09:19] and you know we're one day sooner to his
[1:09:22] appearance
[1:09:23] and people can say well I've heard it
[1:09:25] all my life and like Brother David said
[1:09:27] he heard it since he was a young man
[1:09:29] I've heard it since I was come around
[1:09:31] and and the world's preaching it harder
[1:09:34] than it's ever been for each that Jesus
[1:09:35] is coming
[1:09:37] but he's coming
[1:09:40] and we're one day closer I'm looking
[1:09:42] forward to that day uh turn with me if
[1:09:44] you would into the book of Ephesians
[1:09:50] David called me out I try to be
[1:09:53] organized you know and and when he he
[1:09:55] called my name and I looked down my
[1:09:57] notes and it looked like somebody
[1:09:59] just shuffled them up and they were I
[1:10:03] don't know what happened back there they
[1:10:04] were out of order and so if if we if we
[1:10:07] get the cart in front of the horse
[1:10:10] just forgive me
[1:10:11] Ephesians chapter 6
[1:10:14] we'll try not to keep you long maybe
[1:10:16] just have a little a little Evangelistic
[1:10:18] teaching if that's such a thing uh just
[1:10:21] to by way of remembrance but through the
[1:10:24] word to tell us who we are what we're
[1:10:26] called to do and and how we're to
[1:10:28] conduct ourselves as as Warriors and and
[1:10:32] soldiers of God so Ephesians chapter six
[1:10:35] very familiar scripture we've read it
[1:10:36] many times
[1:10:38] finally verse 10 finally my brethren be
[1:10:43] strong in the Lord
[1:10:45] I like it where it says that it's not
[1:10:47] saying be strong in yourself be strong
[1:10:49] in your pastor be strong in your wife or
[1:10:51] your husband be strong in the Lord and
[1:10:54] in the power of His might put on the
[1:10:57] whole armor of God
[1:11:01] that you may be able to stand against
[1:11:03] The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle
[1:11:05] not against flesh and blood but against
[1:11:07] principalities against Powers against
[1:11:10] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:11:13] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:11:15] places
[1:11:16] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:11:20] of God it's amazing that he says it
[1:11:22] twice right it must be pretty important
[1:11:24] that we're taking on this whole armor of
[1:11:27] God that you may be able to withstand in
[1:11:30] the evil day and having done all to
[1:11:32] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:11:36] gird about with truth and having on the
[1:11:37] breastplate of righteousness and your
[1:11:40] feet shot with the preparation of the
[1:11:41] gospel of peace above all taking the
[1:11:44] shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be
[1:11:46] able to quench all of the fiery darts of
[1:11:50] the wicked and take the helmet of
[1:11:52] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:11:54] which is the word of God praying always
[1:11:58] with a prayer with all prayer and
[1:12:00] supplication in the spirit
[1:12:02] and watching there unto with all
[1:12:04] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:12:06] the saints when it's talking about
[1:12:08] praying there and supplication it means
[1:12:10] supplication means to plead earnestly
[1:12:13] plead it's asking some
[1:12:15] somebody who has power for help
[1:12:17] there's nothing wrong for us as
[1:12:19] Christians to ask God I need help
[1:12:21] that does not mean that you're prideful
[1:12:23] that does not mean that you're weak that
[1:12:25] does not mean that you're arrogant it's
[1:12:26] just mainly mainly saying I can't do
[1:12:28] this on my own I need your help
[1:12:31] man I want to share a little thought
[1:12:32] with you this morning on wrestling with
[1:12:34] rulers let's pray Heavenly Father we
[1:12:37] thank you for your opportunity to be in
[1:12:39] your house this morning Lord and uh
[1:12:41] we're just thankful that we have the
[1:12:44] word the true word of this hour Lord to
[1:12:46] lead us and guide us and to show us so
[1:12:49] that we may be victorious so that we can
[1:12:51] be Overcomers so that we can stand
[1:12:52] against The Wiles of this devil that we
[1:12:55] face on a daily basis and Lord I pray
[1:12:57] this morning that as a minister the word
[1:13:00] that you've laid on My Heart Lord I just
[1:13:03] pray that you allow me to get out of the
[1:13:04] way that it won't be my words but it'll
[1:13:07] be your words through my voice to the
[1:13:10] people and to our hearts Lord to just
[1:13:12] strengthen us and encourage Us in this
[1:13:14] day we're living in we just want to tell
[1:13:16] you we love you and we appreciate you
[1:13:17] and thank you for all you do for us in
[1:13:19] Christ's name amen you can have your
[1:13:21] seats
[1:13:23] I want to share this thought with you
[1:13:24] and I tell you this uh this has been
[1:13:27] uh a thought of mine since I was 16
[1:13:30] years old I guess 16 or 17 and uh
[1:13:34] we took a little trip I I guess it would
[1:13:37] have been brother both meetings church
[1:13:39] we loaded up that bus
[1:13:41] uh that my father-in-law had and we
[1:13:43] loaded up that bus and and we went down
[1:13:46] I guess it I guess it was brother Bo's
[1:13:48] wasn't it and and and I was just young
[1:13:51] and hadn't completely surrendered to the
[1:13:53] Lord and but but yet I was loving what I
[1:13:55] was hearing and I was you know I was I
[1:13:57] was excited and fired up and and we got
[1:14:00] down there and and brother Donnie Reagan
[1:14:02] was preaching the meetings and and he
[1:14:05] come out and he said I'm going to preach
[1:14:07] to you tonight and my message is
[1:14:08] wrestling with rulers
[1:14:10] and I've never forgot that message in
[1:14:12] all of my life and Lord knows I can't
[1:14:15] preach it like brother Donnie I'm not
[1:14:16] going to try to preach it like brother
[1:14:17] Donnie but uh I am going to preach
[1:14:20] through what the lord has laid on my
[1:14:22] heart and it has struck with me for
[1:14:24] years because it made me realize that
[1:14:26] there is a spiritual warfare going on
[1:14:29] and as a young Christian I didn't fully
[1:14:31] understand that I didn't understand I
[1:14:33] thought that you know once you said you
[1:14:35] come to Christ that everything was good
[1:14:36] and everything was pleasant and and it
[1:14:38] would be fine I didn't realize that
[1:14:40] that's where the battle started
[1:14:42] but that's where the Bible starts and
[1:14:44] we're going to look at that today and I
[1:14:46] want to speak to you about the spiritual
[1:14:47] warfare and these rulers that we face on
[1:14:50] a day-to-day basis because I believe we
[1:14:53] need to take this reality seriously
[1:14:56] it's not a fable it's not a fad it's not
[1:14:59] a fairy tale but it's reality
[1:15:01] it's reality and unless we understand
[1:15:03] the nature of this evil and unless we
[1:15:06] understand the reality of it and our
[1:15:08] relationship to it we will not be able
[1:15:10] to stand against it let alone overcome
[1:15:13] it
[1:15:13] so there is more that we have to look at
[1:15:15] because of Life on this Earth can be
[1:15:18] good life on this Earth can be wonderful
[1:15:21] there are many happy times and blessings
[1:15:23] around this world and this life we live
[1:15:25] we look and we have family we have
[1:15:27] friends we have a church family here
[1:15:29] that cares about one another we have
[1:15:31] children some of you have grandchildren
[1:15:32] and all these things we live successful
[1:15:36] lives and that's by the blessings and by
[1:15:38] the grace of God
[1:15:39] but in this all the success and all this
[1:15:42] blessings and all this goodness there's
[1:15:44] evil still present there with us and we
[1:15:47] have to recognize that this evil is
[1:15:49] there and never forget that the evil is
[1:15:51] present in this world because it's real
[1:15:53] good and evil are existing together in
[1:15:56] this universe
[1:15:58] whether we want to believe it or not we
[1:16:00] are facing evil and conflict on a
[1:16:02] day-to-day basis and this war as we've
[1:16:05] said in the past started out we know it
[1:16:07] started out in heaven with Lucifer tried
[1:16:09] to uprise he tried to come and overtake
[1:16:12] an overthrow
[1:16:14] God and His angels because he wanted
[1:16:16] something greater he wanted something
[1:16:18] better and this Rebellion where Lucifer
[1:16:21] comes in and Rebels against God it began
[1:16:23] to set things in motion for the very war
[1:16:26] that we fight today
[1:16:29] that's where it all began from it
[1:16:31] becomes from a rebellious attitude
[1:16:34] and we're going to talk about spirits a
[1:16:36] little bit and we're going to talk about
[1:16:38] some of these things that we that we
[1:16:39] battle and we Face some of our enemies
[1:16:42] that we face on a day-to-day basis
[1:16:44] and in the Garden of Eden when Eve said
[1:16:47] there she was in the Garden of Eden she
[1:16:50] was seduced into disbelieving the word
[1:16:52] of God
[1:16:53] the very word of God that she knew in
[1:16:55] her heart to be true
[1:16:57] did you hear how I said that she knew in
[1:17:00] her heart to be true
[1:17:03] and she was seduced into disobeying the
[1:17:06] word of God and entered into an act of
[1:17:08] pleasure with the serpent and betrayed
[1:17:10] her husband which has led to a lot of
[1:17:13] the chaos in the world today
[1:17:15] that same spirit is going today from
[1:17:18] home to home to home are you with me
[1:17:21] that Spirit didn't die back there in the
[1:17:24] Garden of Eden why are divorce rates out
[1:17:27] the roof why are marriages and broken
[1:17:30] homes happening around our corners
[1:17:33] it's because that spirit that was in the
[1:17:35] Garden of Eden is still here today you
[1:17:38] better learn how to fight it you better
[1:17:41] learn how to combat it you better learn
[1:17:43] how to stand against it and recognize it
[1:17:45] when that Spirit begins to move into
[1:17:46] your home
[1:17:48] it tears homes apart all over the world
[1:17:51] and the Bible clearly says that we are
[1:17:54] the children of God
[1:17:56] but that this world is under the control
[1:17:59] of the devil
[1:18:03] are you with me
[1:18:05] the prophet said understand this that
[1:18:08] the devil controls every nation under
[1:18:10] heaven
[1:18:11] the devil controls the United States
[1:18:14] he controls the government of the United
[1:18:16] States the government of Germany
[1:18:20] every nation under the heavens the devil
[1:18:22] controls them the Bible says he does he
[1:18:25] said read in Matthew chapter 4. I'll use
[1:18:27] this quote here while
[1:18:29] backing it pulled up again to me and
[1:18:31] I've got to look at it in a different
[1:18:32] way but he said Satan took Jesus up to
[1:18:35] the top of the mountain and showed him
[1:18:37] all the kingdoms of the world and
[1:18:39] claimed them to be his
[1:18:41] Satan says this is all mine
[1:18:44] this is all mine and he said I'll give
[1:18:47] them to you if you worship me and that's
[1:18:48] where we were we were dwelling at on the
[1:18:50] time before we were sticking on worship
[1:18:51] but watch what the prophet said he says
[1:18:54] Jesus never looked at him and said you
[1:18:56] lied Satan
[1:18:59] he couldn't call Satan a liar because he
[1:19:02] knew Satan was telling the truth all the
[1:19:04] kingdoms of this world are governed by
[1:19:06] him Jesus knew that he could not say
[1:19:09] this is my kingdom into the millennium
[1:19:11] and so he looked and he had to agree
[1:19:13] with what he was saying
[1:19:17] are you with me don't stumble on that
[1:19:20] but there was there was Satan right
[1:19:22] there and he says this is all my world
[1:19:24] and you can have it and he said you
[1:19:25] never lied Satan
[1:19:28] and so evil abounding around us how we
[1:19:32] how do we win
[1:19:33] how do we win how do we fight this how
[1:19:37] do we overcome this battle brothers and
[1:19:39] sisters we must must start by
[1:19:40] understanding the reality of this evil
[1:19:42] and the world in this evil Place
[1:19:44] controlled by Satan
[1:19:47] none of us uh
[1:19:49] none of us sitting here this morning
[1:19:51] would like to
[1:19:52] think about things being evil we don't
[1:19:55] like to think of wickedness do we
[1:19:57] now now that's scary that's spooky we
[1:20:01] like to leave evil and spooky and wicked
[1:20:03] alone
[1:20:05] but let me tell you evil and wicked and
[1:20:07] spooky is all around us we never wake up
[1:20:11] in the morning and say you know what I I
[1:20:13] I'm Gonna Roll out of bed today and I'm
[1:20:15] gonna say man this is going to be a
[1:20:16] wicked evil day today no we don't do
[1:20:18] that but Paul tells us in the Book of
[1:20:21] Romans listen to the scripture here
[1:20:23] you've heard it many times he said I
[1:20:25] find then a law
[1:20:27] that I when I was the good evil is
[1:20:30] present with me for I Delight in the law
[1:20:32] of God after the inward man so what is
[1:20:35] Paul saying here Paul is telling us that
[1:20:38] he's being honest with the people he
[1:20:39] says hey let me tell you about this law
[1:20:42] I've come to realize in my own life the
[1:20:45] Gentile the messenger to the Gentiles
[1:20:47] and they say let me tell you what I
[1:20:48] found out he said I found out to be true
[1:20:50] that no matter how hard I try
[1:20:53] how many of us how many of us try hard
[1:20:56] we try hard to be to be what God wants
[1:20:59] us to be
[1:21:01] hate our lives and we commit our lives
[1:21:04] and we come to church and we pray and we
[1:21:06] do all these things and Paul says no
[1:21:07] matter how hard I try no matter how good
[1:21:10] I am
[1:21:12] no matter how good I am no matter how
[1:21:15] hard I preach no matter how hard I teach
[1:21:17] no matter how much I encourage the
[1:21:19] Gentiles in this life the law of this
[1:21:21] world says that evil is standing right
[1:21:24] there beside me
[1:21:27] all right
[1:21:28] yeah the evil is standing right there
[1:21:32] beside him he couldn't get away from it
[1:21:34] no more than you and I can get away from
[1:21:35] it
[1:21:37] it's right there beside us
[1:21:39] I heard a message where Robert was
[1:21:41] talking about in the prayer line he said
[1:21:42] he was preaching he was calling people
[1:21:43] up for prayer and he said I felt
[1:21:46] the hairs of the
[1:21:48] devil rub against my arm
[1:21:52] while he is praying for the sick
[1:21:55] while God is healing the blind while God
[1:21:58] is opening the the ears of the death and
[1:22:01] he says I feel the hairs of the devil
[1:22:03] rub against my arm
[1:22:08] present with us there is a law there and
[1:22:10] we have to acknowledge and accept that
[1:22:12] that very same law exists in our day
[1:22:15] just like it did back there in Paul oh
[1:22:18] if we don't we're going to find
[1:22:19] ourselves defeated by the enemy
[1:22:23] we can't ignore it
[1:22:26] we can't ignore it even worse is when we
[1:22:28] accept it in the lifestyle we live and
[1:22:30] we become vulnerable to it
[1:22:33] we allow things to come in
[1:22:37] we don't stand against it brother Parish
[1:22:39] things we didn't used to do now we start
[1:22:42] doing
[1:22:44] things that we used to say was
[1:22:45] unacceptable for a Christian to do now
[1:22:47] it's all of a sudden it's okay
[1:22:50] and we become vulnerable because we
[1:22:52] accept it into the lifestyle we live and
[1:22:54] we've allowed Satan a little bitty crack
[1:22:56] in the door where he can slide right in
[1:22:58] around the corner
[1:23:04] I don't know about you brothers or
[1:23:06] sisters
[1:23:07] but I don't like the feeling of defeat
[1:23:10] there's something in me that competes
[1:23:14] I believe every Christian has it in them
[1:23:16] they're competitors
[1:23:17] they want to win
[1:23:19] they want to they want to fight they
[1:23:21] want to do what's right they want to go
[1:23:23] the extra mile to make things make sure
[1:23:25] things are done the way God wants it
[1:23:26] done
[1:23:28] I can try all I want to take it easy
[1:23:30] when I play a game with somebody I can't
[1:23:32] do it
[1:23:39] Adriana picks on me
[1:23:42] you're gonna win you're gonna try to win
[1:23:43] you better watch it he's gonna win I'm
[1:23:46] gonna try to win
[1:23:47] and I've seen it in you I've seen it in
[1:23:49] your children
[1:23:53] brother you got a granddaughter that's
[1:23:55] gonna win
[1:23:59] I watched her throw at frisbee like a
[1:24:01] rocket she was going to win that game
[1:24:03] she was serious
[1:24:06] there's something in us that competes
[1:24:08] because defeat is miserable nobody wants
[1:24:11] to be depressed do you like to be
[1:24:13] depressed or the Glen do you like
[1:24:15] depression do you like to be oppressed
[1:24:17] do you like the devil holding you down
[1:24:19] no nobody likes that nobody likes that
[1:24:22] kind of Lifestyle
[1:24:24] and it's under these walls that we find
[1:24:27] we're in a miserable place
[1:24:30] and when we look at these Wiles these
[1:24:32] walls are tricks and manipulations
[1:24:36] smoke and mirrors
[1:24:38] tricks and manipulations to get into
[1:24:41] your life they're designed to deceive
[1:24:43] you The Wiles of the devil are clever
[1:24:47] schemes
[1:24:48] and let me tell you he's so slick and
[1:24:51] he's so sneaky
[1:24:54] you may not even recognize them
[1:24:57] you may not even know what he comes
[1:24:59] knocking on your door
[1:25:01] it may be through friends
[1:25:05] well my friend would never mislead me
[1:25:07] really
[1:25:09] where's your friend living
[1:25:12] yeah
[1:25:14] uh it could come from vacillating church
[1:25:16] members
[1:25:19] oh it's all innocent well you know I I
[1:25:21] really enjoy going to church there and
[1:25:24] you know he does a good job preaching
[1:25:26] and they they do good but
[1:25:29] foreign
[1:25:32] Church splits
[1:25:35] over nothing
[1:25:40] um
[1:25:43] be careful
[1:25:44] be careful
[1:25:48] don't get mad at me
[1:25:50] [Applause]
[1:25:53] you can be misled by your husband
[1:25:56] you can be misled by your wife
[1:26:04] that's why it says to put on the whole
[1:26:06] armor you
[1:26:08] you as an individual put on the whole
[1:26:10] armor put on the whole armor of God and
[1:26:13] and these walls are used by Satan too
[1:26:15] and snare us through Temptations through
[1:26:18] threats through intimidation fear and
[1:26:21] deceit
[1:26:22] how many of us has ever had Satan use
[1:26:24] these on us before
[1:26:26] yeah if we're being honest with
[1:26:28] ourselves sure we all have
[1:26:30] that's why there's divorce that's why
[1:26:32] those Church splits that's why children
[1:26:33] are fighting against children
[1:26:36] that's why these things happen because
[1:26:37] Satan is out there working in this and
[1:26:40] Paul instructs us on how to prepare
[1:26:42] ourselves
[1:26:44] Paul gives a very clear plain
[1:26:46] instructions to prepare you and I in
[1:26:48] this evil day we live in
[1:26:51] do you realize it's an evil day
[1:26:56] he says put on the whole armor of God
[1:26:59] that you may be able to stand against
[1:27:01] the walls of the devil the whole armor
[1:27:04] of God brothers and sisters he's telling
[1:27:06] you don't go into this thing
[1:27:07] half-heartedly
[1:27:10] we can't live in a lukewarm condition
[1:27:12] we've been warned and warned and warned
[1:27:15] by the messenger in our day that God
[1:27:17] does not accept lukewarmness he will
[1:27:20] smear you out of his mouth and Paul is
[1:27:22] saying the same thing here don't go into
[1:27:25] this half-heartedly because you won't be
[1:27:27] able to stand against the walls of this
[1:27:28] Devil he's powerful he's given us a
[1:27:31] warning that you better be prepared you
[1:27:34] better be ready to fight that you better
[1:27:36] be ready to stand face to face with the
[1:27:38] devil on a one-on-one battle
[1:27:40] it's you and him mono and mono
[1:27:45] it's
[1:27:46] me and you devil
[1:27:48] are you ready for it
[1:27:50] are you sitting here today as a believer
[1:27:52] of Jesus Christ and a Believer the best
[1:27:54] power can you look the devil in the face
[1:27:56] and say look at me Deb I'm ready for you
[1:28:00] be honest with yourself we're growing
[1:28:02] today but young people listen to me this
[1:28:04] morning you can't defeat Satan young
[1:28:07] people
[1:28:07] because your mom was in church
[1:28:10] you've heard this before but I'm gonna
[1:28:12] tell it to you again because it's the
[1:28:13] truth and I want to bring it to you
[1:28:15] remember you've got to have your own
[1:28:17] experience young people
[1:28:18] you got to get down there and get
[1:28:20] serious before God and say God I'm a
[1:28:23] Christian whether Mama whether daddy
[1:28:25] whether brother where their sister is
[1:28:27] I'm going through
[1:28:29] that's what God is expecting that is
[1:28:32] what scares the devil
[1:28:36] husbands your wives experience on her
[1:28:39] knees and praying is not going to give
[1:28:41] you the experience you need to get
[1:28:44] through
[1:28:45] when you're out on the job site just
[1:28:47] because your wife was at home praying
[1:28:49] before you before you left the work
[1:28:52] and those Temptations come and those
[1:28:55] snares come
[1:28:59] you better have your own experience you
[1:29:01] better have your own set of armor
[1:29:08] brothers and sisters
[1:29:10] I'm thankful this morning
[1:29:12] and I praise the Lord that God has given
[1:29:16] a set of armor
[1:29:19] he given us a complete set of equipment
[1:29:21] and he sends us into battle with
[1:29:23] everything we need at our disposal to
[1:29:26] overthrow Satan
[1:29:29] there's no question about it he doesn't
[1:29:30] give you he doesn't he doesn't give you
[1:29:32] the the worst equipment he can find
[1:29:35] no no no he comes in here and he begins
[1:29:37] to give you the best he's got this Armor
[1:29:39] of God the armor of God did you hear
[1:29:42] what the Bible said
[1:29:43] of God it's not your armor it's his
[1:29:47] armor it's God's own armor
[1:29:52] and we fail some time to realize that
[1:29:54] and we think oh I've got on my armor I
[1:29:56] don't want my armor my armor fails but
[1:29:59] God's armor holds
[1:30:03] it's God's armor
[1:30:06] let me tell you this morning God is
[1:30:08] looking for warriors not wimps
[1:30:11] if you're not ready to stand and be a
[1:30:13] warrior before God you you're a coward
[1:30:17] that's strong that's hard to say but let
[1:30:19] me tell you God needs men and women and
[1:30:21] young men and young women and boys and
[1:30:24] girls he needs every one of us sitting
[1:30:26] here to put on this armor and be clothed
[1:30:28] in God's righteous armor this morning to
[1:30:31] stand The Wiles of the devil but for the
[1:30:34] world so that the world knows those
[1:30:36] people are real
[1:30:41] these Warriors know how to pray they
[1:30:43] know how to fast they know how to trust
[1:30:45] they know how to believe these are not
[1:30:47] cowards they don't just give up and
[1:30:50] surrender
[1:30:51] no they don't surrender their lives to
[1:30:54] the enemy there's nothing that makes me
[1:30:55] matter to hear than to hear somebody say
[1:30:57] well my daddy done it that way and my
[1:31:00] mama they she done and I guess I'll do
[1:31:02] that too
[1:31:06] well I got depression my daddy he
[1:31:08] suffered with it you know and anxiety
[1:31:10] mama had that so I guess I'm gonna have
[1:31:12] to take these pills all my life because
[1:31:13] I
[1:31:15] fight
[1:31:16] stand up and fight I'm not saying you
[1:31:20] don't need medicine don't mistake me but
[1:31:22] I'm just saying fight put on your armor
[1:31:25] and don't accept anything the devil
[1:31:26] throws at you
[1:31:30] many times we're led to believe
[1:31:33] that once we receive Christ and believe
[1:31:35] the truths of this glorious message
[1:31:39] that God Smooths out everything for us
[1:31:44] man it's smooth sailing all you got to
[1:31:46] do is come to the altar repent be
[1:31:48] baptized fill with the Holy Ghost
[1:31:50] life is good
[1:31:52] no that's a lie of the devil if
[1:31:55] somebody's told you that and somebody's
[1:31:56] LED you to believe that they've lied to
[1:31:58] you you've been lied to because that's
[1:32:00] just where where it gets started
[1:32:03] people think because they come and they
[1:32:05] kneel that that blood-covered cross that
[1:32:06] life is going to be so good
[1:32:08] no
[1:32:10] the prophet said he said I think I was
[1:32:12] linking this head in a time of peace
[1:32:14] prepare for war
[1:32:18] yeah that's right that's what he said he
[1:32:21] said that's a good statement and time of
[1:32:22] Peace prepared for war that would be a
[1:32:24] good thing to think about while
[1:32:26] everything is running smooth
[1:32:28] you better get ready
[1:32:31] you better get ready for Satan is going
[1:32:33] isn't going to let it run smooth for
[1:32:35] very long
[1:32:37] he said you're in a convention now and
[1:32:39] everything's good you know we love we
[1:32:40] we're good when we're in church
[1:32:44] and the hallelujahs are and the Praises
[1:32:46] are going forward everything is good
[1:32:49] Satan kind of sets back because he he
[1:32:51] kind of has to kind of watch what do
[1:32:53] these people do
[1:32:54] he said you're in a convention now and
[1:32:56] everything will pour along fine but
[1:32:58] you're going to leave here in a few days
[1:33:01] young people you go to these meetings
[1:33:04] I love these meetings I used to despise
[1:33:07] them can I be honest
[1:33:11] what did he just say
[1:33:14] they used to discourage me
[1:33:17] because many times I've seen people get
[1:33:19] worked up
[1:33:21] they got worked up in Emotion
[1:33:24] they got worked up in a feeling they got
[1:33:26] worked up in a tingle
[1:33:30] let me tell you I'm tingling right now
[1:33:32] but I know where I stand
[1:33:36] young people come up and they cry and
[1:33:38] they pray and they weep and they weep
[1:33:39] and they flood the altar with tears just
[1:33:41] to leave out to do the same thing over
[1:33:44] and over and over never got delivered
[1:33:47] I'm not saying it always happens that
[1:33:48] way I know there's been plenty but
[1:33:50] that's why I say now I begin to realize
[1:33:52] and as I've gotten older I begin to
[1:33:55] understand there is a reality of that
[1:33:57] and we need these meetings we need those
[1:34:00] kind of meetings for the for the young
[1:34:02] people
[1:34:05] because God is going to meet you sir
[1:34:07] Satan is going to meet you somewhere
[1:34:09] rather
[1:34:10] and the prophet said whatever he can say
[1:34:13] he's going to do it
[1:34:15] so be your best dressed all the time
[1:34:21] young people
[1:34:25] have a real experience
[1:34:30] your life may not change
[1:34:32] of 180.
[1:34:34] I think brother Parish testifies in his
[1:34:36] testimony when he was a young man he got
[1:34:37] filled with the Holy Ghost prayed for
[1:34:39] spoke in tongues rise up shouting spoke
[1:34:41] in tongues and he give up everything in
[1:34:43] one day right
[1:34:45] he gave up alcohol he gave up smoking I
[1:34:47] think I've heard his testimony before
[1:34:48] you've heard it but it may not happen
[1:34:50] that way for you
[1:34:52] but put on one piece of armor
[1:34:55] put on some kind of armor and if you've
[1:34:58] got a sin in your life if you've got two
[1:34:59] or three things you're gonna say God
[1:35:01] from this day forward I'm gonna stand
[1:35:03] here and I'm gonna throw the Devil head
[1:35:04] on and I won't do it again
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:14] let me tell you the more
[1:35:18] the more you get into Christ
[1:35:21] the greater your battle becomes
[1:35:27] the more you know in the word
[1:35:30] the hotter the battle gets
[1:35:33] because Satan begins to look and he says
[1:35:35] hey
[1:35:36] this guy's getting somewhere
[1:35:39] this guy's becoming a threat to me when
[1:35:41] he gets up out of bed and puts his feet
[1:35:43] on the floor I don't know what to do
[1:35:45] with it anymore foreign
[1:35:48] he's looking at me and he's giving he's
[1:35:49] becoming a threat to me
[1:35:51] he's becoming more than I can handle
[1:35:54] and that's what God has wanted us to do
[1:35:56] he's want us to get up there and get
[1:35:57] ready
[1:35:58] Revelation and the moral revelation we
[1:36:01] get the more you're gonna have to swing
[1:36:02] your swords you might as well pull it
[1:36:04] out and get ready because as you learn
[1:36:06] get Revelation from God you're gonna
[1:36:08] have to cut through the Demons of hell
[1:36:14] it says for we wrestle
[1:36:16] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:36:18] blood
[1:36:20] what does that mean
[1:36:22] when you wrestle it it means you're
[1:36:24] grappling with somebody
[1:36:26] it means that you've you've locked up
[1:36:28] with an opponent
[1:36:31] sometimes we want to stay away from the
[1:36:33] Devil
[1:36:36] stay away from this guy
[1:36:39] he's ugly
[1:36:41] no that's not what he's saying we're
[1:36:43] gonna wrestle how many is ever with you
[1:36:46] with your kids or with your friends or
[1:36:47] somebody you've locked hands before
[1:36:49] and you locked hands and you try to see
[1:36:51] who can take who down who can turn each
[1:36:53] other's hands and just make them squeal
[1:36:58] I used to do that
[1:37:01] with my boys
[1:37:03] found out I better quit
[1:37:06] didn't want to hurt them
[1:37:13] but Paul is telling us
[1:37:15] you're going to Grapple with this demon
[1:37:18] you're going to Grapple with this enemy
[1:37:21] and wrestling brothers and sisters is a
[1:37:24] challenging sport wrestling takes
[1:37:26] strength
[1:37:28] we gotta have our strength in the Lord
[1:37:31] if you're relying Upon Your Own Strength
[1:37:33] you will not make it
[1:37:36] wrestling takes endurance
[1:37:40] it means being a man or a woman who
[1:37:43] wants you commit your life to God you're
[1:37:45] there through thick through thin through
[1:37:47] rain through sleet through snow it
[1:37:49] doesn't matter
[1:37:51] that you're going to go on with God how
[1:37:53] many times have you seen people they
[1:37:55] don't have the endurance
[1:37:57] they come and they sit down in the Pew
[1:37:59] man they get a good experience they they
[1:38:01] come to the cross and all of a sudden
[1:38:03] the next thing you know the first battle
[1:38:05] that comes along they tuck tail and
[1:38:06] they're gone
[1:38:09] they don't have the endurance but to be
[1:38:11] a child a God and a warrior of God
[1:38:13] you've got to have the endurance you've
[1:38:16] got to have that self-sacrifice that
[1:38:18] says no matter what I go through I'm
[1:38:20] going on
[1:38:22] and these guys they train and they work
[1:38:25] out for hours and hours I'm not talking
[1:38:27] about WWE
[1:38:29] okay
[1:38:30] I'm talking about Olympic and Collegiate
[1:38:33] wrestlers
[1:38:35] that lock up with their opponent and
[1:38:37] they train for hours and they stick to a
[1:38:40] strict diet
[1:38:42] they got to have just the right amount
[1:38:44] of protein just the right amount of
[1:38:46] carbohydrates because they got to show
[1:38:48] up to a weigh-in and see how they weigh
[1:38:49] up against their opponent
[1:38:51] are you with me we have to have a strict
[1:38:54] diet as well
[1:38:57] we've got a strict diet to follow this
[1:39:00] is our food this is the word of God this
[1:39:03] is where we get our energy this is where
[1:39:04] we get our strength this is where we get
[1:39:06] all that we have need of in this book
[1:39:08] the word of God that's our food that's
[1:39:11] our diet
[1:39:13] when you want to Grapple with the devil
[1:39:15] give him the word
[1:39:18] when Satan comes at you with depression
[1:39:20] give him the word
[1:39:23] another thing about this wrestling
[1:39:26] they're constantly trying to figure out
[1:39:28] how to break the opponent's Toe Hold
[1:39:31] and how like how to to break the
[1:39:33] opponent's stronghold
[1:39:37] and they're constantly looking and
[1:39:39] they're studying
[1:39:41] man how can I get out of this
[1:39:44] we've got a way out
[1:39:52] everything you have need of
[1:39:56] do you realize this war I'm talking
[1:39:57] about started in Genesis and it ends in
[1:39:59] Revelations and all those other 64 books
[1:40:02] in between those two there's a war going
[1:40:05] on
[1:40:06] so if you're battling sickness
[1:40:08] there's an answer for you

[1:40:24] there's an answer for you
[1:40:27] find it in the word and live by the word
[1:40:32] you say you're putting a lot on us
[1:40:35] you're putting a lot of responsibility
[1:40:36] on us
[1:40:39] you know when those wrestlers step into
[1:40:40] that Circle
[1:40:45] and they step into that Circle and they
[1:40:47] lock hands
[1:40:48] or they lock arms
[1:40:50] they don't crawl to the corner
[1:40:53] and and tap somebody to come in and
[1:40:55] finish the fight for them
[1:40:57] no
[1:40:58] this is going to be you brothers and
[1:41:00] sisters
[1:41:01] it's going to be your fight it's going
[1:41:03] to be your battle Uncle John is going to
[1:41:05] be here
[1:41:08] it's not his battle your battle is not
[1:41:10] his and his it's not yours
[1:41:12] you may be brothers you may be close you
[1:41:14] may you may be in business ventures
[1:41:16] together you may be doing all these
[1:41:17] things you're both trying to serve the
[1:41:18] Lord but he don't fight what you fight
[1:41:21] my boys don't fight the same battles
[1:41:26] you young girls your sisters you don't
[1:41:28] fight the same battles
[1:41:30] and there's nobody to tap out to you
[1:41:32] can't pass the ball to somebody else
[1:41:34] there's no teammate
[1:41:38] it's you
[1:41:40] and him
[1:41:44] one-on-one
[1:41:47] one-on-one
[1:41:49] so when thoughts come into your mind
[1:41:53] speaking to all of us now not just young
[1:41:55] people
[1:41:56] you owe people you have thoughts come in
[1:41:58] your mind too
[1:42:00] when thoughts come into your mind it's
[1:42:02] you that has to overcome those thoughts
[1:42:05] it's easy when it's easy to tell a
[1:42:07] little white lie
[1:42:10] oh we wouldn't do that we're Christians
[1:42:12] oh come on now
[1:42:13] put those wings up
[1:42:15] sometimes it's just easier to tell just
[1:42:17] a little just a little feel that nobody
[1:42:20] will ever know and it don't hurt anybody
[1:42:22] it don't harm anybody but it's still not
[1:42:24] the truth
[1:42:25] and when it's easy to tell those little
[1:42:27] white lies
[1:42:28] it's you that's got to tell the truth
[1:42:32] when doubt Rises up it's you that has to
[1:42:35] have faith
[1:42:37] when you're feeling weak and tired and
[1:42:39] and weary it's you that has to have
[1:42:41] strength
[1:42:43] now I appreciate all the prayers and you
[1:42:46] should appreciate all the prayers of
[1:42:47] your brothers and sisters in the church
[1:42:49] and the pastor and the pastor's wife
[1:42:52] but it's you that's got to get up and go
[1:42:56] foreign
[1:42:58] the rulers of Darkness he says who ruled
[1:43:00] the world the devil
[1:43:02] certainly all these things going on all
[1:43:04] these ungodly things going on around
[1:43:06] here and the government and so forth
[1:43:08] It's all the devil
[1:43:10] he controls it all the United States
[1:43:12] Germany he controls every nation every
[1:43:14] Kingdom that ever was there ever will be
[1:43:16] until God sets up his kingdom
[1:43:19] is controlled by the devil
[1:43:22] so you know we you hear these uh
[1:43:24] oh I don't get political but you hear
[1:43:27] these liberals and these people say well
[1:43:29] after so and so wins I'm moving to
[1:43:31] Canada we'll just move on to Canada
[1:43:32] because you're going to face the same
[1:43:34] devil up there that you face down here
[1:43:38] he's everywhere
[1:43:45] listen he says I'm going to read some
[1:43:47] quotes to you now
[1:43:50] the greatest battle ever fought brother
[1:43:51] Brown was preaching on this message and
[1:43:54] he goes through and he lays it out about
[1:43:55] as simple as anybody could ever lay it
[1:43:58] out
[1:43:59] and as I'm reading this I do have some
[1:44:01] stuff that I'm going to put in here
[1:44:02] myself some thoughts that came to me and
[1:44:04] I'm going to inject them but most of
[1:44:05] this is right out of his message the
[1:44:07] greatest battle ever fought he says now
[1:44:09] listen All You Soldiers
[1:44:12] who's he talking to
[1:44:14] you all You Soldiers just before we
[1:44:17] start the prayer line take unto you the
[1:44:19] whole armor not part of it but the whole
[1:44:22] armor so that you can withstand this
[1:44:25] evil day he said and that's where we're
[1:44:27] living when you've done all to stand
[1:44:29] stand
[1:44:30] he said amen see he said all you can do
[1:44:33] is stand then stand don't move brothers
[1:44:36] and sisters if we could get it in our
[1:44:38] minds and root ourselves in the gospel
[1:44:41] and in the word of God that we're just
[1:44:43] like that tree planted by the water that
[1:44:45] we're just like that tree planted by the
[1:44:47] water and Satan say Satan I shall not be
[1:44:51] moved say it with
[1:44:54] I shall not be moved
[1:44:57] again Satan I shall not be moved
[1:45:03] if we can find ourselves in that place
[1:45:06] then we can stand and stand therefore
[1:45:08] and we can find ourselves in that place
[1:45:10] we stand in Grace we stand in the gospel
[1:45:14] We Stand encouraged we stand in strength
[1:45:16] and faith and Liberty and unity
[1:45:19] do you see what's happening God is
[1:45:22] building an arm
[1:45:23] man God has been in the army of Warriors
[1:45:27] and soldiers and they'll stand they'll
[1:45:29] stand in the Lord they'll stand perfect
[1:45:31] and complete in the will of God
[1:45:37] it means let me tell you it means you're
[1:45:39] going to be attacked
[1:45:45] if
[1:45:47] if you don't want to fight this battle
[1:45:48] maybe save you gas money gas is high
[1:45:51] right now
[1:45:57] but you gotta fight
[1:46:00] you gotta fight
[1:46:02] stand therefore
[1:46:03] having your loins
[1:46:05] gerd about with truth
[1:46:08] he says what is that what is that truth
[1:46:10] that's the word of God it's the word of
[1:46:12] truth and truth is symbolically laid
[1:46:15] right here around this part of our body
[1:46:17] have your loins gird about you with
[1:46:20] truth this is protecting the one of the
[1:46:22] most vital areas of our body
[1:46:25] and what it also does for the soldier is
[1:46:27] it gathers up their garments so that
[1:46:29] they can fight in battle
[1:46:31] we have to be prepared to fight in
[1:46:33] battle
[1:46:35] these soldiers when they would rest they
[1:46:37] would take that belt off
[1:46:39] and their clothes will be Loosely
[1:46:40] hanging about them but at the sound of
[1:46:42] that horn at the sound of that trumpet
[1:46:44] they would gird themselves around about
[1:46:46] pull up all those loose clothes and get
[1:46:48] themselves ready to fight in a battle
[1:46:51] prepared they don't want nothing
[1:46:52] hindering them nothing holding them
[1:46:54] nothing if the devil could snag
[1:46:56] don't let things in your life let the
[1:46:58] devil grab a hold of things in your life
[1:47:00] and snag you
[1:47:03] ah
[1:47:04] having the breastplate of righteousness
[1:47:07] he says what is that it's to do what's
[1:47:10] right
[1:47:13] that's simple
[1:47:15] it's simple just do what's right he said
[1:47:18] got the word of God in you doing what's
[1:47:21] right that's the breastplate of
[1:47:22] righteousness it's the protect these
[1:47:25] organs
[1:47:29] these very vital organs your heart
[1:47:32] we need to protect our heart
[1:47:34] against the wives of this devil let me
[1:47:37] tell you you're going to have thoughts
[1:47:38] you're going to have feelings you're
[1:47:40] going to have expressions of emotions
[1:47:42] but don't ever let them get down in here
[1:47:44] put on that breastplate of righteousness
[1:47:46] so that you know when you need to do
[1:47:48] right you'll do the right thing
[1:47:52] your feet shot in the preparation of the
[1:47:55] gospel of peace
[1:47:57] he said that means when you go anywhere
[1:47:59] any place anytime your feet are shot
[1:48:02] with the gospel
[1:48:04] foreign
[1:48:06] where I walk I bring good news
[1:48:08] where I walk Jesus Lives where I walk
[1:48:12] Jesus is portrayed
[1:48:14] can we all say that
[1:48:17] sometimes I don't just being honest
[1:48:20] I wish I could I I that's my hope that's
[1:48:24] my prayer that's my desire that's what
[1:48:25] we're here trying to do we're trying to
[1:48:27] get to that place but on a day-to-day
[1:48:29] basis we ought to be able to tell
[1:48:30] ourselves today Lord I'm going to shod
[1:48:33] my feet with the gospel
[1:48:35] when I get out of bed and my feet Hit
[1:48:37] the Floor praise God I'm going to
[1:48:39] represent you
[1:48:41] what is the what is that preparation uh
[1:48:44] the the feet the preparation it's the
[1:48:47] foundation
[1:48:49] the foundation of the soldier if he
[1:48:51] loses his footy
[1:48:52] you've got it
[1:48:54] when these two wrestlers are grappling
[1:48:56] you can watch them they'll wrestle and
[1:48:58] they'll twist and they'll turn and
[1:48:59] they'll spin but if one ever slips
[1:49:02] he's down
[1:49:03] you've got it and that's what we got to
[1:49:06] do we got to make sure our feet are shot
[1:49:07] with the gospel when the Roman soldiers
[1:49:09] put sandals on their feet they were so
[1:49:11] victorious in battle because they drove
[1:49:13] spikes and nails through the sandals so
[1:49:16] that they could grip the ground
[1:49:18] it was a it was a tactic of the Warfare
[1:49:20] and and this illustration is being given
[1:49:23] to us here don't lose your foot
[1:49:25] when Satan comes at you and he's pushed
[1:49:28] at you you dig your toes in
[1:49:30] you dig in and you push don't lose your
[1:49:33] footing
[1:49:36] above all take the shield of faith
[1:49:39] he says what is that that's the one that
[1:49:40] knocks the darts off the shield of faith
[1:49:43] it knocks the darts off that we're able
[1:49:45] to to able to quench all the fiery darts
[1:49:48] of the wicked
[1:49:50] Paul was talking about a shield here
[1:49:52] that's used in battle
[1:49:53] you've probably seen movies the old
[1:49:55] Roman movies the old war movies where
[1:49:58] when the they would come up on a city
[1:49:59] get ready to overtake the city what did
[1:50:01] all the archers do dip their arrows in
[1:50:04] oil and Fire
[1:50:07] and thousands would at the same time at
[1:50:10] the soldiers coming right
[1:50:12] and so these guys would have these these
[1:50:14] soldiers that was coming to take the
[1:50:15] city they would have these shields and
[1:50:17] they would all come together and when
[1:50:19] they saw those fiery darts they would
[1:50:21] all throw their Shields up one right
[1:50:23] beside another and make a huge Shield
[1:50:27] what did that do it kept those fiery
[1:50:30] darts off of them it would hit those
[1:50:32] Shields and deflect off that way they
[1:50:34] wasn't burnt brothers and sisters we're
[1:50:36] the same way get your Shield of faith
[1:50:38] and build it up on that Shield of faith
[1:50:40] and we as believers when we come
[1:50:44] together we can build such a shield
[1:50:46] against Satan this Satan cannot Prevail
[1:50:50] against us
[1:50:54] take the helmet of salvation
[1:50:57] he said what is that that's your soul
[1:50:59] that's your mind that's your head that
[1:51:03] helmet of salvation covers your head he
[1:51:05] said it's your protection it's brass and
[1:51:08] it can't be it can't even be tempered
[1:51:10] it's harder than iron he said it's
[1:51:13] salvation it's knowing that your healing
[1:51:15] comes from God your salvation comes from
[1:51:18] God your experience matches his word
[1:51:23] it's your deliverance
[1:51:28] he says that's right he said take that
[1:51:31] helmet of salvation and go marching
[1:51:34] forward because that's what we're
[1:51:36] supposed to do
[1:51:38] the warrior of God marches into battle
[1:51:41] faces the battle head-on you've heard it
[1:51:44] said and preached many times there's no
[1:51:46] armor on my back
[1:51:49] there's nothing to protect me so when I
[1:51:51] face Satan and I turn and run I'm as
[1:51:53] good as gone
[1:51:55] I have to face Satan head on look at him
[1:51:58] straight in the eyes and say here I am
[1:52:01] look out devil here I come
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:05] sometimes we're afraid to tell Satan
[1:52:07] that
[1:52:09] um
[1:52:09] he says but Satan's Army it brings
[1:52:11] diseases
[1:52:15] yeah do you see this Warfare we're in
[1:52:18] it hits you from all angles
[1:52:22] it can tear your home you can lose your
[1:52:24] job
[1:52:27] you can lose your marriage
[1:52:30] you get sick
[1:52:31] you get a terminal diagnosis
[1:52:35] do you turn and run or do you say no
[1:52:38] this is my god-given
[1:52:39] this is my god-given rights this is my
[1:52:42] god-given gift that God has given me
[1:52:44] I'll fight for my wife I'll fight for my
[1:52:46] children I'll fight for my job I'll
[1:52:48] fight for my life and I'll look Satan in
[1:52:50] the eyes and say my God is greater
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:56] he said Satan brings all this sickness
[1:52:58] death and sorrow frustrations and worry
[1:53:03] how many has ever experienced any of
[1:53:04] those

[1:53:14] of this

[1:53:19] and peace and understanding and love and
[1:53:22] comfort and grace and mercy are you with
[1:53:25] me

[1:53:29] world serves in Satan
[1:53:34] he said but don't don't know he said
[1:53:37] take a little take heed here
[1:53:39] he says there's two great
[1:53:42] forces coming together right now
[1:53:45] I told you I made Satan mad

[1:53:52] right now
[1:53:54] and he said they're battling
[1:53:56] they're battling right here in this
[1:53:58] building
[1:54:01] oh if we could just see the Unseen
[1:54:05] if we could just see how how Angels
[1:54:07] fight for us
[1:54:09] if we could just see how God's Guardians
[1:54:12] are about us and how Satan has to get
[1:54:14] knocked down and gets knocked down and
[1:54:16] gets knocked down by the word of God and
[1:54:19] the angels that encampus about us
[1:54:21] he says they're battling in this
[1:54:23] building right now he said they battled
[1:54:26] day by day
[1:54:30] every force with you
[1:54:37] he said get a good image of this he said
[1:54:40] Satan
[1:54:41] is like that great big kingly Priestly

[1:56:00] he says he'll meet you in the name of
[1:56:02] science
[1:56:04] and I thought boy if that's not the
[1:56:05] truth
[1:56:07] how many times have people been told by
[1:56:09] the doctor you can't be healed
[1:56:11] front row right here

[1:56:23] did you accept that
[1:56:25] no sir he put on his armor and he faced
[1:56:29] him head on listen doctors may tell you
[1:56:31] can't be healed they may tell you it's
[1:56:33] irreversible they make it but God says
[1:56:36] I'm a miracle working God and we can't
[1:56:38] forget that
[1:56:39] [Applause]
[1:56:42] he comes to you with culture
[1:56:45] and this is where he gets a lot of young
[1:56:46] people
[1:56:48] well the world says it's okay to drink
[1:56:51] the world says it's okay it's our
[1:56:53] culture
[1:56:55] everybody's doing it
[1:56:57] it's okay to live with a girl before
[1:56:59] you're married everybody does it
[1:57:03] do you hear me
[1:57:05] it's okay for two girls to like each
[1:57:08] other or two boys to
[1:57:09] like each other
[1:57:12] The Wiles of the devil this is how he
[1:57:15] comes at you with culture
[1:57:21] he'll meet you in all kinds of things
[1:57:23] this that the other whatever
[1:57:26] that's where he wants to meet you right
[1:57:27] there
[1:57:29] and if he could just interject just a
[1:57:31] little bit of doubt in your mind
[1:57:34] just a little bit of Doubt is all it
[1:57:36] took for Eve
[1:57:38] let me tell you young people stay true
[1:57:40] to the word
[1:57:41] you may not have the Holy Ghost
[1:57:44] but I pray that your parents have the
[1:57:45] Holy Ghost over here
[1:57:47] there's been many times I prayed my kids
[1:57:50] many of nights I've laid there and laid
[1:57:53] there and prayed the hands are
[1:57:54] protection upon them that they won't
[1:57:56] make a mistake that's irreversible
[1:57:59] because they're cats
[1:58:11] the kids
[1:58:13] they're young people
[1:58:18] I won't get into great death or detail
[1:58:20] here but how many of us skated through
[1:58:22] as a young person
[1:58:26] thanks for one honest hand brother Glenn
[1:58:31] but for the grace of God
[1:58:34] but for the grace of God where would I
[1:58:36] be but why is it when we see young
[1:58:38] people sometimes fall it's kind of like
[1:58:41] it was coming
[1:58:43] I saw it from a mile away
[1:58:45] how
[1:58:47] we pray Holy Ghost over them until they
[1:58:49] get it theirself that's what we do for
[1:58:52] our young people we pray over them
[1:58:59] Satan's Army brings diseases
[1:59:02] he said God's Army is commissioned to
[1:59:05] cast them out
[1:59:07] you know that's your commission
[1:59:11] that's your duty
[1:59:13] when a soldier goes in they have to take
[1:59:14] a swearing in am I right soldiers they
[1:59:17] put their hand up in the hand on the
[1:59:18] Bible and they swear that they'll
[1:59:19] protect this country they'll do this and
[1:59:21] this and this and they'll do everything
[1:59:22] that it says to do and brother Brown
[1:59:25] says right here when the diseases come
[1:59:27] God's Army is commissioned
[1:59:29] you should have to raise your hand and
[1:59:31] say I'm going to cast these out your
[1:59:33] commission Satan throws anything on you
[1:59:37] God's Army cast him out
[1:59:40] sometimes we lay back powerless and
[1:59:43] defeated
[1:59:45] we found to realize who we really are
[1:59:48] you know the prophet he said when she
[1:59:49] figures out who she is she'll be an
[1:59:51] invincible Army it's time we figure out
[1:59:54] who we are
[1:59:55] because God's method is cast out evil
[1:59:59] he said God God cast down reasoning God
[2:00:03] cast down Superstition cast out worry
[2:00:05] cast out disease cast out sin this is
[2:00:08] what God is doing he said you know he
[2:00:11] said when when you were there in
[2:00:12] Heavenly places
[2:00:15] God dwelling in you and he said when
[2:00:18] those evil things try to get into the
[2:00:19] kingdom what did he do
[2:00:22] cast them out
[2:00:25] he didn't say well Lucifer
[2:00:27] you're a good adversary so I'm going to
[2:00:29] let you I'm gonna let you have a bedroom
[2:00:30] over here
[2:00:33] he said Lucifer you get you and your
[2:00:35] one-third of angels and get out of here
[2:00:37] you have no place amongst the righteous
[2:00:39] you're evil you're Wicked I'm despise
[2:00:42] you you're full of grief and wickedness
[2:00:44] and Evil
[2:00:45] out
[2:00:49] in the Garden of Eden Eden
[2:00:52] out
[2:00:56] um
[2:00:57] his own
[2:00:59] out
[2:01:02] of my presence until I find a way that
[2:01:04] you can come back
[2:01:07] um
[2:01:11] so we understand
[2:01:14] as Christians
[2:01:16] we're going to be fighting in this
[2:01:18] battle
[2:01:21] and we're going to engage in this battle
[2:01:23] and we're going to put on our Spiritual
[2:01:25] armor
[2:01:27] we've come that far
[2:01:30] we got on our Spiritual armor and we
[2:01:32] know that our source from where our
[2:01:33] power and strength come
[2:01:37] is what prayer
[2:01:41] we've got all of this battle armor on
[2:01:44] we've got the word
[2:01:47] where do you get your power and your
[2:01:49] strength
[2:01:51] it's right here
[2:01:53] it's on these knees
[2:01:55] your power your strength your overcoming
[2:01:58] power comes right there when you're down
[2:01:59] there and you're praying
[2:02:01] you pray before God and you get strong
[2:02:04] in the Lord and the power of His might
[2:02:11] this spiritual battle brothers and
[2:02:12] sisters is not one where we strap on a
[2:02:14] 45.
[2:02:16] and we're looking for our enemies as we
[2:02:18] go down the road and just waiting to
[2:02:20] now
[2:02:21] that's not the kind of battle we're in
[2:02:24] our battles are won and lost with our
[2:02:28] prayer life
[2:02:31] and if I'm pointing at you I'm pointing
[2:02:33] a lot back at me
[2:02:36] I need more of a prayer life
[2:02:41] many times I wake up in the middle of
[2:02:43] night and I just lay in bed and I pray
[2:02:44] but I never feel like that's enough
[2:02:47] I I ordered
[2:02:49] put more time and more dedication
[2:02:52] and sometimes you wonder what is it what
[2:02:54] is it even worth it
[2:02:58] I woke up in the middle of night at a
[2:03:00] conference
[2:03:02] 3 A.M in the morning
[2:03:04] just a little bit ago
[2:03:07] November actually
[2:03:09] and a Brother come on my mind that I
[2:03:11] haven't spoke to I haven't heard of I
[2:03:15] haven't even thought about in months and
[2:03:17] months and months
[2:03:19] I couldn't go back to sleep
[2:03:22] I was so troubled that I just laid there
[2:03:24] in the bed for maybe an hour and I just
[2:03:26] said God I don't know what he's going
[2:03:28] through I don't even know why you woke
[2:03:30] me up I'm not that close to this guy why
[2:03:33] did you put him on my mind and I sat
[2:03:35] there and I began to pray and pray and
[2:03:37] pray
[2:03:40] and then I thought that's all I can do
[2:03:44] that's all I can do
[2:03:46] and I I woke up the next morning
[2:03:50] I said what do I do with that
[2:03:52] what do I do with that
[2:03:56] so I've got my phone looked his number
[2:03:58] up I had his number
[2:04:00] hit
[2:04:05] you've done that before huh
[2:04:08] trying to figure out the right words
[2:04:11] Take It All Away
[2:04:14] finally I said brother
[2:04:17] I don't know what's going on with you
[2:04:18] but last night about three in the
[2:04:20] morning God woke me up from a dead sleep
[2:04:23] and you were such a burden on my heart I
[2:04:26] began to pray for you I hope you're
[2:04:27] doing well and I hope by God's grace
[2:04:29] everything is good in your life
[2:04:32] never heard back from you
[2:04:35] so I hope it is
[2:04:37] but you know there's a side of me that
[2:04:39] says why didn't he just answer and say
[2:04:41] thanks brother
[2:04:43] I appreciate the prayers
[2:04:46] that's not for me to decide
[2:04:49] I did my part
[2:04:51] I pulled out my sword I got down on my
[2:04:53] knees I began to pray for him over and
[2:04:55] over and over for maybe like I said an
[2:04:57] hour and it may have just been that
[2:05:00] little prayer at that time that kept him
[2:05:01] from having a Widowmaker heart attack in
[2:05:04] his sleep it could have been a prayer
[2:05:06] right there that kept him from making a
[2:05:07] decision it could have aroused him in
[2:05:09] the middle of the night and said don't
[2:05:10] do what you're about to do
[2:05:12] it could have been that little prayer
[2:05:14] that changed the whole course of his
[2:05:16] life I don't know I'm not saying I'm
[2:05:18] special I'm not saying it means anything
[2:05:21] but for some reason
[2:05:27] we need to pray
[2:05:29] we can we can't advance in a spiritual
[2:05:32] battle if we're not empowered with
[2:05:33] prayer
[2:05:34] we have to have prayer we need prayer to
[2:05:37] protect us from this evil one we need to
[2:05:39] pray that God would guard our moral
[2:05:41] lives
[2:05:43] every one of us
[2:05:44] this world is morally and ethically
[2:05:47] Wicked
[2:05:49] and don't think it don't want you
[2:05:52] it wants you
[2:05:54] it's hunting you
[2:05:59] we need to pray that God protect our
[2:06:02] moral lives protect the people from
[2:06:04] moral failure
[2:06:06] pray God for more in our church
[2:06:11] pray for our pastor pray for his wife
[2:06:14] pray for our song leaders pray for the
[2:06:16] Bible School the Sunday School
[2:06:19] the little things
[2:06:23] a lot of times we're guilty of saying
[2:06:24] well he didn't say nothing
[2:06:29] well how much praying did you do for him
[2:06:34] hey I've I've been guilty
[2:06:37] and I can say that with an honest heart
[2:06:39] I'm ashamed of it but it's easy to do
[2:06:43] maybe you wasn't in tune maybe you what
[2:06:46] didn't get what maybe it wasn't for you
[2:06:47] and your critical side becomes going to
[2:06:49] say man he said nothing in three weeks
[2:06:56] well I'm sorry I'm the only one
[2:07:00] foreign
[2:07:06] but then I look back and I think
[2:07:08] how much time did I spend praying before
[2:07:11] that service
[2:07:13] because you know I found out the hard
[2:07:15] way
[2:07:16] I have found out that if you'll dedicate
[2:07:18] yourself before a service
[2:07:21] if you just give five minutes
[2:07:24] and say God I am weak
[2:07:28] I'm not worthy
[2:07:31] I don't deserve but God I need something
[2:07:34] from you today
[2:07:36] use my pastor use the Evangelist use
[2:07:40] somebody to speak or sing or say
[2:07:43] something that will encourage me today
[2:07:46] it changes the whole course of the
[2:07:49] service you know why because your
[2:07:51] expectation level went up and you're
[2:07:53] looking and you're listening and you're
[2:07:54] anticipating oh man what's he gonna say
[2:07:57] I know it's coming I've asked God he's
[2:07:58] going to bring me just what I need
[2:08:01] and you begin to get excited in the word
[2:08:03] of God and the next thing you know you
[2:08:06] don't care who's sitting around you you
[2:08:08] don't care who's singing you don't care
[2:08:10] who shouting into a place where God can
[2:08:14] speak to your heart
[2:08:25] and then there's those times when you
[2:08:27] pray
[2:08:30] and you pray
[2:08:32] and you pray some more
[2:08:36] and a little more
[2:08:39] and you keep praying
[2:08:42] and you think man I've got to I gotta I
[2:08:44] just it's not gonna happen
[2:08:47] my my needs are not going to be met
[2:08:50] my desire is not going to be fulfilled
[2:08:53] I prayed and I prayed and I prayed I've
[2:08:55] done this for two days in a row
[2:08:59] sometimes we find it hard to pray for
[2:09:01] ten minutes
[2:09:02] we want instant
[2:09:04] let me tell you God don't give microwave
[2:09:06] religion
[2:09:08] you just can't push 30 seconds and think
[2:09:10] all your troubles will vanish
[2:09:13] no sometimes God needs time to get to
[2:09:16] you
[2:09:17] sometimes God's angels are on their way
[2:09:20] and you're just not waiting you give up
[2:09:22] before they ever get there
[2:09:24] you know there was a man in the book
[2:09:25] about in the Bible called Daniel
[2:09:28] and Daniel when you read over in the
[2:09:30] chapter 10 Daniel is an old man at this
[2:09:33] time as you're reading in this chapter
[2:09:34] 10. he's all about 80 years old and he's
[2:09:37] seen some things in his time you know
[2:09:39] who Daniel is
[2:09:40] he's seen God move in Mighty ways
[2:09:45] and so here he is sitting there and he's
[2:09:46] looking now and he's trying to he said
[2:09:48] here and he's looking at the children of
[2:09:50] Israel the Jewish nation and he's
[2:09:52] discouraged in what he sees he's
[2:09:54] discouraged because they've had their
[2:09:56] freedom given to him but yet they're not
[2:09:58] building the Temple their their
[2:10:00] lackadaisical he don't know what's going
[2:10:02] to happen
[2:10:03] with the
[2:10:04] nation and he's worried and it's
[2:10:08] 21 days
[2:10:11] 20
[2:10:12] I don't know how it's looking to you
[2:10:14] 21 days
[2:10:17] and Daniel is mourning it says and he
[2:10:20] says he ain't no Pleasant bread
[2:10:23] he didn't come and know wine to hit his
[2:10:26] mouth he didn't anoint himself for a
[2:10:29] whole three weeks
[2:10:34] I have a hard time fasting from 8 A.M to
[2:10:37] 12 A.M
[2:10:41] and Daniel said no Pleasant bread
[2:10:44] I'm not going to wash myself and bathe
[2:10:46] and anoint myself as custom says but I'm
[2:10:50] going to sit here and I'm going to pray
[2:10:51] and I'm going to pray and I'm going to
[2:10:53] pray
[2:10:55] then all of a sudden it says Behold a
[2:10:58] man stepped out
[2:11:00] clothed in fine linen and it said his
[2:11:03] loins were girded with fine gold his
[2:11:06] body was like barrel and his face the
[2:11:08] appearance of lightning and the lights
[2:11:10] of fire in his eyes
[2:11:12] and his voice was as the multitudes does
[2:11:15] this sound familiar
[2:11:17] you can find it in Revelations
[2:11:19] and his voice is like the voice of a
[2:11:22] multitude and it said Daniel alone saw
[2:11:25] this vision and the rest of the man with
[2:11:27] him they trembled they Quake because the
[2:11:30] earthquake and they hid themselves
[2:11:32] and here is Daniel sitting there looking
[2:11:34] at this and he's laying flat on the
[2:11:36] ground
[2:11:38] trembling at what he saw
[2:11:41] afraid to look
[2:11:45] sometimes
[2:11:46] if you pray long enough you'll get just
[2:11:48] what you're asking for
[2:11:50] God Almighty had moved on to the scene
[2:11:53] of Daniel's life
[2:11:54] and Daniel's sitting there trembling
[2:11:56] with his face down in the dirt and it
[2:11:58] said he come over and put his hand on
[2:11:59] him and he brought him up and he said he
[2:12:01] put him on his hands and his knees and
[2:12:03] that's as far as he could go because he
[2:12:04] didn't have strength to get up he's for
[2:12:06] what he was saying
[2:12:07] and Daniel on his hands and knees now
[2:12:10] trembling
[2:12:12] if they could hold my God
[2:12:16] who is this I I know who this is I've
[2:12:19] seen him before
[2:12:23] he's come
[2:12:25] and he said he said unto him fear not
[2:12:28] Daniel
[2:12:31] listen
[2:12:33] for from the first day
[2:12:36] that thou did set thine heart to
[2:12:38] understand
[2:12:41] listen Daniel
[2:12:43] don't worry because of the from the very
[2:12:45] first day that you begin to pray to me
[2:12:47] Daniel from the very first day that you
[2:12:50] want to understand what was going on
[2:12:51] with the people from that very first day
[2:12:57] I heard the words
[2:13:07] and now
[2:13:09] now Daniel I am come for thy words
[2:13:19] you ever been in a place where Daniel's
[2:13:20] at
[2:13:22] and you're wondering
[2:13:24] well Lord we're in the world have
[2:13:27] have you been
[2:13:31] think about a time in your life
[2:13:33] when things look bleak
[2:13:35] things look grim things look like you
[2:13:38] just couldn't get a
[2:13:40] over the hump
[2:13:41] and you prayed like I said and you
[2:13:44] prayed
[2:13:45] and then finally your answer come you
[2:13:47] think Lord why did it take so long
[2:13:51] the prince
[2:13:52] of the kingdom of Persia
[2:13:56] he withstood me for 20 and one days
[2:14:04] are you with me
[2:14:07] the the prince of the King of Persia the
[2:14:11] king of the Prince of Persia has
[2:14:12] withstood me for 21 days and lo Michael
[2:14:15] the chief Prince he had to come and he
[2:14:19] had to help me fight this battle let me
[2:14:21] tell you Daniel I've been trying to get
[2:14:23] to you I've been working I've been
[2:14:25] fighting I've been grappling with this
[2:14:27] ruler in Persia but he wouldn't let me
[2:14:30] through
[2:14:32] sometimes we think God don't hear us but
[2:14:34] we don't see what's going on
[2:14:37] we don't see the battle that's being
[2:14:39] fought between good and evil and the
[2:14:41] answer prayers that are coming your way
[2:14:44] and he says I have battled and I battled
[2:14:46] and he said and the Prince of Persia has
[2:14:49] held me back why did that Prince of
[2:14:51] Persia hold him back
[2:14:52] the Prince of Persia was wanting to
[2:14:54] protect the evil Kingdom he didn't want
[2:14:57] Daniel the man of God to know and to be
[2:15:00] able to prophesy the good things to come
[2:15:02] for Israel he didn't want him to know
[2:15:04] what was going to happen three
[2:15:06] 100 years down the road he didn't want
[2:15:09] him to know what was going to happen in
[2:15:10] the Book of Revelations and sometimes
[2:15:13] Satan battles our guardian angels and
[2:15:15] the word as it comes to us because
[2:15:17] sometimes Satan guards against your
[2:15:19] healing
[2:15:20] he guards against your overcoming he
[2:15:24] guards against our happiness and your
[2:15:26] joy and your satisfaction in the word
[2:15:30] and all the while this battle is
[2:15:31] happening
[2:15:33] and you're getting down on God
[2:15:38] he said that if he was delayed 21 days
[2:15:40] because of the evil of that land
[2:15:43] yeah what will it be in this day
[2:15:47] oh
[2:15:49] you talk about that endurance we talked
[2:15:51] about the wrestler has to have the
[2:15:53] endurance
[2:15:54] we have to have the endurance he says
[2:15:56] because on you have to have that undying
[2:15:59] faith and that hunger and the desire and
[2:16:01] the human heart that won't say no to God
[2:16:03] but that will hold on to God until he
[2:16:06] speaks
[2:16:10] he says you can't play with this
[2:16:14] listen to this and this I'm going to
[2:16:16] close with this
[2:16:17] two more pages and I'm closing I promise
[2:16:20] he said here some time ago
[2:16:23] he said there was a woman that come into
[2:16:24] the meeting
[2:16:25] and she was back there and he said the
[2:16:27] people back there and
[2:16:30] when when the woman come through and she
[2:16:32] come through the prayer line and she had
[2:16:34] a serious stomach trouble
[2:16:37] very serious stomach trouble couldn't
[2:16:39] eat hadn't eaten weeks and months
[2:16:42] and she was standing there on one of the
[2:16:44] rows during the prayer line
[2:16:46] and he said the the Lord spoke to her
[2:16:49] and said thus saith the Lord he said
[2:16:51] that wasn't me
[2:16:52] he said I wouldn't dares to do that
[2:16:55] but he spoke to her and said thus saith
[2:16:58] the Lord you're healed
[2:17:01] and he said there was a woman sitting
[2:17:03] behind her just the same just right
[2:17:06] behind her and he said that same thing
[2:17:08] was said to her another one said it to
[2:17:10] her thus saith the Lord you're healed
[2:17:13] she had a growth on her neck a hideous
[2:17:15] growth on her neck
[2:17:19] he said she went home
[2:17:22] and she tried to eat supper
[2:17:25] and she almost died
[2:17:28] he says he tried to eat supper she
[2:17:30] almost died and she got sick and days
[2:17:32] passed and she got sicker and sicker
[2:17:36] so you know what she did
[2:17:38] said she went back and she got them
[2:17:39] tapes
[2:17:41] and she began to Play It Again
[2:17:43] and she began to play it again and she
[2:17:45] wanted to hear him say thus saith the
[2:17:47] Lord
[2:17:48] you're healed she began to build upon
[2:17:51] her faith and build herself there he
[2:17:53] said and it was like the Holy Spirit
[2:17:54] spoke to her and several weeks passed
[2:17:57] six or eight weeks
[2:18:02] six or eight weeks passed by
[2:18:05] her husband
[2:18:08] laughed at her
[2:18:09] she said But I'm Healed her children
[2:18:12] laughed at her
[2:18:14] her neighbors laughed at her
[2:18:17] and she said what he they said to her
[2:18:20] said
[2:18:21] what did that man that preacher do to
[2:18:23] you down there
[2:18:24] and you know what her reply was it
[2:18:27] wasn't what he did to me it's what God
[2:18:28] did to me he healed me
[2:18:31] and her not eating for six to eight
[2:18:33] weeks
[2:18:35] and he said all of a sudden he said she
[2:18:37] was sitting there and sent the children
[2:18:39] off to school she was getting ready to
[2:18:40] do the dishes and she said man I'm
[2:18:42] hungry
[2:18:44] he said she hadn't done the dishes yet
[2:18:46] and there said a piece of toast
[2:18:48] one of the kids left on the plate
[2:18:50] and so she picked up that toast and she
[2:18:52] began to eat on that toast
[2:18:55] and she began to do dishes
[2:18:58] she said you know this used to make me
[2:19:00] sick
[2:19:02] I think I'll try some oatmeal
[2:19:05] says she grabbed her a bowl of oatmeal
[2:19:07] that was up there she began to eat the
[2:19:08] oatmeal and she said you know what
[2:19:11] this used to make me sick
[2:19:14] but it don't
[2:19:16] and so she said I'm gonna go out there
[2:19:17] and get extreme I'm going to get me a
[2:19:20] cup of coffee so she began to drink that
[2:19:23] cup of coffee and she began to drink
[2:19:25] that cup of coffee and she said you know
[2:19:27] what they ought to kill me
[2:19:30] but it don't I'm Healed God has moved on
[2:19:34] the scene and I'm Healed since she
[2:19:36] jumped up she run out to the door she
[2:19:38] went down through the neighborhood to
[2:19:40] her friend's house the woman who was
[2:19:42] sitting behind her with the growth she
[2:19:44] busted in her door and that woman was
[2:19:46] screaming and shouting and running and
[2:19:48] said what's wrong with you she said my
[2:19:50] growth is gone
[2:19:52] what was it he said it was God moving
[2:19:56] through the neighborhood
[2:19:58] he said listen God can't come to your
[2:20:00] rescue at every minute
[2:20:02] he said his angels can't come to your
[2:20:04] rescue at every minute but you have to
[2:20:06] wait you have to be there just like
[2:20:08] Daniel for 21 days and pray and prayed
[2:20:12] and prayed
[2:20:15] I thought when I was thinking on this I
[2:20:17] thought what would have happened if
[2:20:18] Daniel would have give up on day 20.
[2:20:22] would it have changed the course of
[2:20:23] history
[2:20:27] would it change the way the words were
[2:20:29] written
[2:20:30] but Daniel didn't have it in him
[2:20:33] he had to pray because he knew where he
[2:20:35] stood and brothers and sisters through
[2:20:38] it all
[2:20:39] we got to know where we stand and we've
[2:20:41] got to be able to pray before God and
[2:20:43] trust in God
[2:20:45] and I just want to say this morning in
[2:20:47] closing
[2:20:48] that no matter what you're going through
[2:20:51] God has called you to a special place
[2:20:55] you young people as you get older this
[2:20:57] may not make sense to you now
[2:21:00] but as you get older you'll realize that
[2:21:02] God has orchestrated every path every
[2:21:05] step of the path of your life
[2:21:08] for a reason
[2:21:12] it's not by chance that you said here
[2:21:15] it's not by chance that you hear this
[2:21:17] kind of preaching
[2:21:19] there's a lot easier preaching out there
[2:21:22] there's a lot easier to hear to maintain
[2:21:25] to follow
[2:21:28] there's a lot easier to follow word out
[2:21:31] there
[2:21:32] I say that with a little W because
[2:21:34] that's not his word
[2:21:37] but you will appreciate someday as you
[2:21:40] get down there and you say God
[2:21:41] through all these battles
[2:21:44] through all this hardship through all
[2:21:46] these things that you've put me through
[2:21:48] to all the things that that I have had
[2:21:50] to fight Satan for over and over and
[2:21:52] over
[2:21:54] I now see
[2:21:56] I'm a Victorious
[2:21:58] Warrior
[2:22:00] let's stand to our feet
[2:22:10] let's just go before the Lord in prayer
[2:22:14] I didn't mean to keep you this long but
[2:22:16] it's your fault
[2:22:24] Lord Heavenly Father
[2:22:27] we bow our hearts before you at the
[2:22:29] close of the service
[2:22:34] and we're trusting Lord
[2:22:37] that these words have encouraged the
[2:22:39] hearts of your people
[2:22:43] the pull of the people is tremendous
[2:22:45] today Lord your people are hungry
[2:22:47] they're pulling on the word
[2:22:50] we all sit here and we we're wanting to
[2:22:52] grow and we groan for that day that's
[2:22:53] coming
[2:22:54] and we want to be victorious in our
[2:22:57] lives as Christians we want to be
[2:22:59] example Believers of the word
[2:23:04] but it's not easy Lord
[2:23:07] we're just being honest with you this
[2:23:08] morning
[2:23:09] the battles we have to face in this evil
[2:23:11] day they're no surprise to you they
[2:23:13] don't shock you
[2:23:15] it's nothing new to you
[2:23:18] but Lord sometimes they catch us off
[2:23:21] guard
[2:23:21] sometimes Satan tries to slip in around
[2:23:24] the corner in a sneaky way that we can't
[2:23:27] quite put our finger on but he gets in
[2:23:29] there and the next thing you know
[2:23:31] we're in a place that we shouldn't be
[2:23:33] we're doing things we shouldn't do we're
[2:23:35] saying things we shouldn't say
[2:23:38] but Lord we stand before you this
[2:23:40] morning and we ask Lord that this whole
[2:23:42] armor of God
[2:23:44] your armor
[2:23:46] not something that I can come up with
[2:23:48] not by my might or my strength
[2:23:52] Jeremiah said in there it's not by not
[2:23:55] by might but it's by you lord it's by
[2:23:57] Your Word
[2:24:00] Lord It's that's the armor we're looking
[2:24:02] for
[2:24:04] that's the armor that we want to Shield
[2:24:06] ourselves with when the enemy shoots
[2:24:08] those fiery darts at us to discourage us
[2:24:11] to depress us to oppress us
[2:24:15] to tell us that we're not going to make
[2:24:16] it
[2:24:17] to tell us we're not worthy to tell us
[2:24:19] we're we're defeated
[2:24:21] it's those darts that we could throw of
[2:24:23] our Shield of faith and deflect those
[2:24:26] darts out
[2:24:30] Lord Jesus
[2:24:34] make us the Warriors
[2:24:36] of your army that you would have us to
[2:24:38] be
[2:24:40] it's our desire to be victorious
[2:24:45] help us Lord
[2:24:47] with our power and our strength through
[2:24:49] prayer
[2:24:50] help us Lord to be more obedient to the
[2:24:53] thoughts of Prayer
[2:24:56] Lord I know myself I fall short so many
[2:24:59] times
[2:25:00] whereas if I would just take it to you
[2:25:01] in prayer the situation would be
[2:25:03] overcome so much easier so much quicker
[2:25:08] so Lord I pray that you would put a
[2:25:10] desire of prayer into our lives
[2:25:13] and as we fight this battle in the days
[2:25:15] to come in the weeks to come or years to
[2:25:17] come however long we have on this Earth
[2:25:20] let us stand and stand therefore strong
[2:25:24] and soldiers and warriors
[2:25:27] of the world
[2:25:29] word
[2:25:31] Lord that's our desire this morning
[2:25:35] build our strength and build our faith
[2:25:36] we ask Lord in Jesus name amen
