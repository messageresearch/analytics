the debt of love oh dear lord i give myself away tis all that i can do boy at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burdens of my heart were rolled away [Music] oh it received my sight and now i am happy all the days amen aren't you thankful for the work he done for us amen wonderful wonderful jesus is to me and amen you excuse me i i was thinking you know and every good thing everything you go through with something good comes out of it a few years ago you know when i had those stints put in my heart my doctor my heart doctor told me i need to drink a lot of water and i i tried and i failed miserably and because i'm pretty well addicted to diet cokes well when i got covered this last time it changed everything i can't hardly live without water now so i guess the lord knew i needed to listen to the doctor so he gave me covet again for it now i drink it all the time but i'm just thankful for his grace you know i was thinking about that and i got some friends of mine in arkansas and my brother was telling me that they'd had colvin they'd been in the hospital and i thought you know we've been blessed as a church just about everyone's had it but none of us has been serious enough that we've had to go to the hospital and i think that's something we would be very thankful for that god has kept his hand upon us and i'm just really i just really appreciate the lord and you know they always say when we get on the other side we'll really see what god has really done for us all throughout our lives and you know and i i i reminisce sometimes and and the when i was young i didn't have a lot of common sense when it come to driving i would raise anything or anybody and i lost most of the time because i had a slow car but the thrill was was racing but i began to think you know i thought lord one of these days we'll begin to see all the goodness and mercy you really have done in our hearts and lives and that's why i believe tonight he's wonderful to me amen well once my heart all my heart sings today it sings for joy and gladness oh jesus says satisfies vanishes my sadness and guilt is gone peace is mine peace like to a river oh jesus is wonderful he's mighty dude delivered and he's wonderful he's wonderful oh jesus says to me he's my counselor prince of peace my dear god is he oh he is saving me me from all sin and shame wonderful is [Music] free from condemnation jesus gives liberty of the past have been all forgiven and my name is inscribed on the book of heaven oh he's wonderful wonderful jesus says to me he's my counselor prince of peace mighty god is he oh he is saving me keeping me from offset and change oh wonderful is my redeemer praise his name and living here with my lord in a holy union day by days [Music] holding sweet communion and oh what change grace has wrought in my lowly station since my soul has received full and free salvation oh he's wonderful wonderful yes jesus is to me he's my counselor prince of peace mighty god is he he is saving me keeping me from [Music] his name oh he's so wonderful wonderful jesus says to me my counselor prince of peace mighty god is he oh he is saving me keeping me from all sin and shame oh wonderful is my repeat versus his name [Music] amen he's wonderful isn't he and i got a text from brother steve avery today and uh they were snowed in up there i guess he lives in maryland and he said he streamed our service sunday and he said it was good to see me and the seat of the troy and brother brian and he said great to see brother thomas still at the top of his game on his preaching his message and he said to greet everyone and he said it's even good to hear brother joe hollering amen every once in a while so brother steve sends his love and so i didn't realize that he was streaming whenever they weren't having church up there and he may be streaming tonight but just appreciate those kind words tonight we miss him but just pray that god will bless him amen brother daniel and brother carson would you come take up the offering tonight and we have some prayer requests like i said brother glenn and sister sherry they're not here and brother parish and sister parish we want to remember them tonight and also sister peggy and uh my my friend brother mark white he's doing something better and uh they just asked that we continue to pray for him tonight so if you haven't made one in your heart you might be known but tonight we're going to ask for the daniel if you pray over offering these needs amen in that city where the lamb is the light page 107. excuse me there's a country far beyond the stormy sky oh there's a city where there never comes a night oh if we're faithful we shall go there in that [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] and here we have our days of sunshine but we know that the sun which shines upon us now so bright will be changed to clouds and rain until we go [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] and [Music] disappointments all the while and our fondest hopes but meet us hitter bright though by night we wake [Music] where the lamb [Music] [Music] [Music] and not a shadow can my blissful solar flight for i know that up in heaven there is room let's stand tonight in that city where the lamb is [Music] no not i am going where the land is the lot singing again is where the thomas comes in that city where the lamb is the light oh in that city where they've come i am going where the lamb is the light god bless [Music] you everybody hey man we uh kind of watch the radar i know some of you is probably a little concerned about the ice storm just west of us here and it's uh not too far from us but it's 50 degrees so maybe it'll melt when it hit the road by the time you know you've got a long way to go so uh yeah you know we don't want anybody stranded so anyway but i think we'll be all right i think we can squeeze it in i hate to miss church don't you so if we can squeeze it in we'll squeeze it in amen praise the lord god is good isn't he i hope you haven't having a good week everybody having a good week amen praise the lord i'll tell you what um it's been good amen i'll tell you what i just after sunday the lord coming down just at an anointing and amen re-surrendering ourselves i don't know if it made a difference for you but it's made a difference for me i mean this week's been a lot better amen and just the closer walk with god amen that's what we desire right a closer walk with god and so amen i just hope that it's amen it may change your life you know the prophet says that and we say it a lot but i mean it's got to be a reality that we either go out there better or we don't right and if we go out there better then let's stay that way amen and that's always a battle because we're in the human body the human body is one of the terrible things to have to fight we have to fight with against it all the way until we get out of it but we just thank god for his mercy amen let's bow our heads kind heavenly father we come before you one more time lord grateful lord jesus that the weather permits this lord to be able to have the service this evening and we just ask god that once again you just come and speak to us along the way and may our hearts burn within his father as you speak to us lord jesus and help me just to be completely surrendered to you lord jesus that i wouldn't say anything that would be human or carnal or something that would be displeasing to you lord so i just ask god help me to get completely out of the way that your spirit would speak to your people father lord you know just how to do it you're so fantastic at it we asked god that you would just speak to our hearts tonight lord and lord you just know to go down avenues and channels and say things lord that i haven't thought of and haven't premeditated and and just to say what we need to hear father we ask god that the audience the congregation lord would be prayed up lord and be ready to hear from the spirit and receive what you have for us we just bless your name we praise you father and give thanks and honor and glory to you for what you have done for us tonight lord and we just ask your blessings upon the reading of the word the meditation of our heart in jesus name amen and amen so i've just been meditating and i've just been thinking about sunday and and and so i have i guess we'll try to put it all together but the lord's just given me several different thoughts a little bit and so we'll just see what the lord will have but it certainly again towards a closer walk with god amen and so if you will turn your bibles go to um i believe it's let me see korean first corinthians first corinthians amen and i know brother steve he'd probably not be tonight but we greet him amen and we miss him amen and pray god's blessing upon him way up there and amen all those out there in radio land may god bless you richly amen god is good amen uh first corinthians six first corinthians six and we'll begin verse 19. what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and ye are not your own you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods begotten is blessing to the green word you can be seated my thought meditation was that i just wanted to speak a little bit of what it's like when you truly are completely surrendered to god amen what it's like to be completely surrendered to god and i got to thinking about how that you know the bible we know that the bible is our map right it's like a map it's like a direction book and we all know that most of the time whenever you're doing anything it's really the best to read the directions and it's probably very very few times that you're going to have directions that mislead you right [Music] very few times you're going to say now those directions are wrong right i mean come from the manufacturer when they put it together they want to make sure that you know you can get it put together right amen and that's the way it is with our lives this bible is a road map it is a book of directions and it is uh you know they have those those maps that are written out but we unfolded for a road map right remember those yeah and because we want to laugh at those now right but you know sometimes our dps will mess us up won't we sometimes you're messing your gps and you kind of wish you had the road map here back to the old way because when they lay those out those aren't supposed to be wrong either right they get those pretty precise but when you're relying on gps and then there ain't no re i don't know why in the world but there will be different reasons why it'll take you the wrong way i get frustrated brother sean whenever i'm going somewhere and i pre-look at where it's directing me on the gps right and then all of a sudden it takes tells me take a left up here okay i'll pull off the road and now look where it goes and i've had him take me over here up and then back on my road and i'm like why would i want to do a little thing like that what in the world's going on here no i'm going to keep going straight right and then and i do that and keep going straight and then all of a sudden it'll self-correct i'll check it again and say okay now that's what you're supposed to do in other words when you get me a certain road the closest route the straightest route keep me on that route and that's where it is with the bible amen i want you to know that there is never i am are you glad there is never a fault in god's direction his gps is right on every time and if we desire to get closer to god how many believes that if we will do what the bible says it will not mislead us i am so glad brother sisters that we have the directions that we know uh through the message of the hour that we can be told exactly what give us more power to live a victorious christian life like brother brad i believe he preached about a week ago talking about stability that you can't find stability anymore it's hard to be stable and not just to have a victorious life but to have a consistent victorious stable life come on folks are you with me because we all know what it's like to get up in the morning and not feel like we did the day before or go halfway through the day and everything that can go wrong will go wrong hello i'ma share a little personal thing here my wife i hope she won't mind but i'm sure that you have experienced it perhaps when you're close to the lord and everything's going good and you know you're gonna let nothing upset you today and just just come to go on and so on and so on all of a sudden your mate something will disturb them and they'll be all upset right that kind of happened to us this week and i talked to my wife look that's you know if the devil can't get to you he'll get to me if he can't get to me he'll get to you amen because he wants to get to you to get to me and the devil will always work on you won't he and so how many has ever experienced that if you've been married very long you know that sometimes both of them aren't pulling together at the same time come on folks that's a big hallelujah amen right there that's the truth ain't it that's right because but you know it's just the devil and you got to encourage each other in those times to speak to each other person at a time let's just kind of encourage them and so forth amen and to get it all pulling together to keep the devil out to keep things going free and good amen praise be to god so we look at this here amen when you are completely surrendered to god that means that you have been bought in other words to commit yourself to god to come to jesus the way he said for you to come love don't love mama daddy better sister no family member to hate hey nobody that you love more than him how he believes you got to surrender all your family got to surrender all your acquaintances you got to surrender your wife or your heart you can't love them more than you love god see folks i thought about this stuff i thought about that i thought about why we don't have fullness of why we don't have fullness of victory but i believe it's there for us are you with me but if there's any fault it's because we're not coming according to the bible we're not coming we're not completely like sunday was so good because he was talking about how that we want to completely surrender ourselves almighty god amen oh god is good isn't he and so that you come so you come completely surrendered to christ you give yourself to christ he's got the directions on how to how to uh how to have a new birth how to really be born again how to really be a christian and i believe it's got to work now this just comes to mind didn't haven't pre-meditated this one but remember when brother ben preached a message called choir to people so toss it out he says you find people that just seem to be on top of the mountain all the time every day then you find people that are just up and down in and out for one day to hallelujah glory to god and maybe run into pews and the next day i just don't think i'm a christian huh and brandon explains it in that message so if you've got that problem go back to that message and listen to why right and then find out the reason why and then repent get right and i tell you what i believe this you can be like that other person amen because if it's good for one it's good for the other it's good for everybody but it's still just our ways that gets messed up into it oh my i like it so i got thinking you know when you come that way you've got to come the right way you've got to come according to the instructions and that is what that is repent turn around 360. you're going to be happy we'll be willing to forsake all to follow him amen and if you do if you come the right way let me say this i don't care if you got cancer i don't care what what your problem is if you come the right way right i mean please it's gonna happen you're going to get to your destination if you come the right way it has to fail it cannot does not fail if there's any failure who is it on you well my pastor just don't preach it right so it's not his fault it's surely your fault maybe you got a revelation that he don't now you got the right path and you got to get what you want i don't care what it is my my husband don't blame nobody else just blame yourself i mean that's all we got to blame is ourself because i believe with all of my heart that when you come with everything on the line and you're willing to give up everything i believe that you've got to be willing to give up everything for the sake of christ and let him have the preeminence long as you hold to one thing you're not gonna be a complete christian now i'm here to tell you because i know it happened to me huh i know when i came to god i don't care if you want me to decline to try to climb to the moon i don't care what god wanted me to do i said i am here whatever you want me to do whatever you want me to be whatever it is lord i am yours how many knows that has to do with that that heifer that they had that could not have a spot or a wrinkle on it right that sacrifice had to be perfect or god would not accept it that's the way with your sacrifice you've got to come and it cannot be with spot or wrinkle or a little bit of this or a little bit it's got to be acceptable by god because when you come the right way you don't even have to wait for it uh people want to tarry and do this out of the other you might have to tarry and labor just to die to yourself but the minute that you accept it and you receive it and you believe it with all of your heart just like cornelius amen in the ninth chapter i believe it is of acts amen they received it when the word was preached they received it immediately the holy ghost fell upon them amen god will consume your sacrifice you'll accept your sacrifice by and how do you know you've got the holy ghost how do you know that god accepts your sacrifice when he fills you with the holy ghost that's the only way that you know that he ex accepted your sacrifice he consumed it and filled you with the holy ghost amen i was thinking also just meditating and i thought you know we get so wrapped up in the things of this world you know i've got a chevy truck i like my chevy truck it's the best nicest chevy truck i've had in a while and everybody likes a nice vehicle how many likes a nice vehicle well mike and i'm eagle and i was thinking you know right now the used trucks are pretty uh you know pretty high you can get a lot of money for them and and so forth and my my front hood is flaking off the paint's coming off i'm like oh man just when i thought i had and i took the paint just supposed to peel enough all the trade it in and buy me a nice forty thousand dollar truck like that come on get control of yourself you don't need no big old nice truck that one there will do you good for a long time huh your flesh always wants better i always want something nice and i'm thinking well i'd be riding one of them nice here i'm cheese you know nothing wrong with doing it if you can afford today oh pray praise be to god i'll dance around the truck with you if you can afford to know that god bless you with ain't nothing wrong with it but you make sure that you're led by the holy ghost and that you don't put yourself in such states you can't come to church huh put you on a bind and maybe all squirming but what i'm trying to say is we get sow our houses everything about it we get so earthly minded amen in our treasure we these things are our treasures right but you know the real tractor why come to find out the real truck and listen some people's treasure is money more money money money money money money become a millionaire do you realize that the millionaire isn't much happier than it was before he wants in another million or you want to be a donald trump and be a multi-billionaire huh and come to find out it doesn't really give him any more joy down in here at all it just gives them more headache and worry probably huh because people would pay billions of dollars they'd pay all kinds of money for just the one thing and that is to have peace of mind to have peace in their heart don't you realize that one of the greatest values in life is contentment to be happy with what you have paul's a godliness with contentment is great day jesus said where your treasure is there will your heart be also the greatest and the most greatest treasures in the world are the things that jesus paid for for you and me on calvary how many believes that's right that's the greatest thing even jesus said the news that labor not for the meat that perishes we labor so much for the things that are perishable that will perish everything gets old everything will perish but he said don't labor for that labor for the things that are eternal what's eternal salvation for one thing just to start amen to know like paul said through faith we have peace with god right we have peace with god what a valuable thing because you couldn't have peace with god unless you could have your sins forgetting forgiven how many believes that one of the greatest treasures is to have your sins forgiven he hath forgiven me my sins have been washed from his memory by the blood of the lamb oh that is so valuable and it's just such a value to know that your sins are gone and now you belong you belong to somebody let me write my notes down okay you belong to somebody now you're wearing this so [Laughter] so how many has heard the phrase sold out to god amen that means you belong to somebody that means you have been purchased somebody bought you nobody says you are bought with a price and you know what the devil don't like that he don't like that sign he don't want you to be sold because he's still trying to buy you you know he don't care how much of a soul sign on there you you have he's still gonna try to offer you stuff huh but we just gotta let the devil know we're sold we're not for sale that means that you're not for sale you can't have me somebody got me you are now god's property to be completely surrendered means that you are now god's property and the devil has no right on your property the devil can't touch you without god's permission remember that nothing can happen to you unless god allowed it if the devil tries to put something on you that's not yours like sickness or whatever it might be are ready to quote this afternoon where brother ram says you know you've got the token has been applied right amen to the devil has no right on your property if he comes and takes something sometimes to get something to take something take your health take your joy take whatever tell them get off this property you ain't got no right to be here another thing about being completely surrounded i want you to know it gives you a right to fill out god's checks you know he's already put his name down underneath them checks in the name of jesus christ he's already signed the checks you've got a whole checkbook full of side checks whatever you need you can have what so everything you ask in my name i will do it but you can't be and i want to go a different direction here you can't just be partially sold the problem is and the other thing is about it being completely surrendered means that you're not halfway anymore halfway you're not lukewarm anymore you're hot for god now it means you're prayed up come on folks how many we you know it's easy to get unprayed up and and to be lukewarm but when you're completely surrendered you surrender your day you get up and commit your day to the lord right every walk every step everything you completely surrendered means you're not lukewarm anymore you're not partial you're not a halfway christian anymore [Music] remember what he said me just people are halfway preachers are halfway folks i'm telling you i know what this flesh does and how that it can get you all droggy brother brad any any preacher knows that you can come up here and preach a good sermon by your intellects huh but when you really get in the spirit you realize i could be so much better huh i could do so much better if i'd just be more surrendered now was it lukewarm you're not going to preach you're too good being a priest or lukewarm yeah you're going to be halfway same way with a christian you're just going to be a halfway christian you could be so much more but it takes a full surrender i believe it was in 64 65 remember brother bam talk preach a message called god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief and why what did he use but abraham he used abraham as an illustration that though yet the covenant though he had an unconditional covenant that god was going to save him and so forth and he was going to have multitudes of people and that wasn't going to change that he's going to do all of this but yet god didn't bless him fully right because he still had a little unbelief in the way he took lot he took his daddy when god said separate himself from everything that's where brother baby says you know that a christian is not fully blessed until he has completely surrendered to god in complete obedience to the word of god i got to thinking today i thought you know it's kind of like somebody that works for you and man i'm telling you he doesn't do what you say he finally you find him sleep on the job he argues with you he fusses with you tries to tell you how to do it and then he don't even do what he's supposed to do huh are you going to promote him are you going to are you going to are you going to bless him and give him a bonus now well that's the same way with god even though he was god's child he did not fully bless abraham until he fully obeyed are you gonna are you gonna promote are you gonna be a blessing are you going to give a guy a bonus that man he does what she said plus more he says yes sir instead of well do i have to how long can i take to do it and then when he does the job it's half done and you have to tell them to do it again [Music] well that's what's with god until you're fully blessed until you to fully obey he can't fully bless you he's not gonna fully bless you you're not gonna really know what it's like to have the full joy of god until you are completely surrendered to god and realize that you are bought with a price that joy let me tell you something that joy and that peace i like that peace because i'm telling you when you're fully surrendered you get the benefits of calvary you get everything you paid for everything that you have need of in this life's journey and when you come down to drawing your last breath you don't have to even be afraid he will take care of you through all of this life and when you come to the end of it and you come to the river and he'll come to the end of the road he'll take you across the river and he promised that over there i've got a place prepared for you already what a blessing we don't have to live below our god-given privileges anymore how many believes that we don't have you don't have to live below those privileges the prophet of god talk about he says christians everywhere are living a million miles below their god-given privileges i believe when you're fully surrendered you live up and you begin to be able to tap in on those resources god begin to give you those things give you that joy give me that power give me that love give me that peace give me that fire huh as long as you're halfway you're gonna be halfway it's gonna make everybody sick can i say that is that all right makes everybody sick when you're halfway not just god but people don't even like it your wife don't like it your husband don't like it your pastor don't like it your children won't like it i don't know if my son's listening tonight but i wouldn't help him out a little bit yesterday i believe it was not micah but i was helping him out you know what he was so worried about you know about me scratching his concrete a little scratch here and and doing this and ripping the cord out of the wall by tripping over it and he's getting on to me and getting on the music what's up i'll just go home he said dad you do that one now you're up at your house i'm like i'm not really particularly about anything but i have been lately from my house ripped out i want to be careful is that the other and i thought about i i left it alone i almost got a little upset i left it alone i said son you are exactly right you're a chip off the old block i said that's how exactly i am i'm sorry you know i'm particular you're predicting i should i should understand that amen how many believes the holy ghost will make you aware of your own faults amen when it's your children you can't blame them for a while they are they got it oh they remind me of that sometimes about that do you know where i got it amen praise the lord you love him oh my when i think about it amen got to thinking that when you're christian when you're fully surrendered matthew 5 matthew 6 and verse 31 is yours matthew 6 31 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where with all shall we be clothed for after all these things to this gentile seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first to keep every thing all these things shall be added unto you let me believe that when you have a complete render light to god god takes care of you 100 percent aren't you glad for that god takes care of you 100 percent he cares about what you get to eat whether you got clothes to wear whether you got a roof over your head whether you got shoes on your feet he cares about every bit of you if you're seeking the kingdom of god remember seek the kingdom first put him first in everything he'll take care of it other than that you don't really have that promise huh you don't really have that promise you have a promise really of being miserable huh poor blind naked lukewarm that's what laodicea was that's what a lukewarmness brought him oh my let's remember this also that we're hot not cold and even our prophet taught us that in the old testament with the children of israel they would come to church they would make the sacrifice they'd do their church thing all the time every time all the time every time until it becomes just nothing but a tradition to them and he said because he got stale because he got common to him god said it's a stench in my nose it really don't mean anything to him anymore we can come to church on wednesday we come on church on sunday we can do this back and forth until it doesn't really have the meaning and it becomes a stench in god's nostrils and it's lukewarmness god don't accept that lukewarmness i believe that it ought to make us like uh make us stable but many times many scripture talks about uh making god establish you and so forth and make you stable and intend for uh you know having done all to stand therefore stand having you learn loyal skirt about amen when you are completely surrendered to god worship doesn't become common amazing grace doesn't become common you don't come in here one sunday and you join in for singing and oh praise be to god and tears flowing down and the next one you come and you're nothing but a spectator huh how many knows being in church is not a place for expectation it's participation in worship certainly makes it easier for the preacher when the people get into it what god what good does it do to have an inspired preacher when a congregation is not inspired an individual is not inspired how many plays he takes both parts amen if the preacher's inspired the congregation's inspired something's fixing to happen god come down and pray inhabits the praise of his people i believe our worship should come from the bottom of our heart all the time constantly consistently and the only way that'll happen folks how many knows and that is if you know how to do like daniel did and have a three times a day prayer life a constant relationship with christ a constant dying to yourself every day amen i wrote down here that you'll be like stonewall jackson what happens when you're completely surrendered to god you become like stonewall jackson you become stable and unmovable hello not up and down and in and out but it becomes stable and not just stable but there's something else about stonewall jackson that made him that way i believe the bible says in everything give thanks now folks i'll be watering my horse trough up as i say thank you lord for this trough of water what just all kinds of different things thank you for this i was coming to town and coming through the red light and i looked and that says boy thank you lord for have a nice smooth road i know russia and some of them places they don't have a very good rose from what i understand the philippines you know it'll take your wheel off come on folks very good and i thank you thank you lord for this new intersection thank you for the turning lanes you know nicer roads and i thought well not just that energy i thank you for this far laying down through here thank you jesus i'm missing everything if you're really surrendered you'll be thankful for everything and you'll grumble about [Music] nothing nothing to grumble about when you're completely in the hands of god you know that he's taking care of you he promised to supply all your needs all your life and he promised to take you through the hard places oh my it's just like a wedding when you take your vows it's for the better for the worse it's for richer or if you're poor it's for sickness or for health as long as you shall live i'm gonna believe that it is another thought what you receive when you completely surrender is those trips give it up for nothing let me just say this i believe you're genuinely born again the further away you get from god there's a serious backsliding in december eight how many of that people people backsliding and can you stop it how do you stop it preach harder explain it harder pray for him yeah but really the only thing that's going to stop him is god it's really the only thing that's going to stop it and whether that person is a child of god or not because if you're a child of god you're elected and god knew what you would do you'll be so miserable you'll be so miserable that you just got to get right no you're not gonna take your own life you should become i gotta get right with god folks and i i believe that most christians that's been a christian any time have gotten that way because it's part of learning it's part of learning to walk it's about learning what to abstain from and stay away from and and so forth even the thoughts that come to your mind you got to stay away from it and that right amen and you'll it'll take you down the road and make you completely miserable and you'll remember where he was if you was like i say if he was genuinely born again if you weren't genuinely born again you just had a taste of it anyway you won't mind going out into that and staying out in it but if you're a child of god you come back those treasures of having that peace of god that's more valuable than any money could ever get in this world it's more fun than any fun that you can ever have i want a resounding amen on that one amen it is more fun than any time you can ever have is to have jesus i'd rather have jesus than worldwide fame pleasure whatever it is i would rather have jesus you find out he's the greatest treasure there is there's nothing more valuable in your life than jesus christ working out his plan his will in your life and then no matter what comes your way most of all that love that you have with him that peace that you have that joy that you have i wrote down here all of our senses we got see taste feel hear smell we got memory we got conscience that can really bother us bad that's why most people coming back from wars and things you know especially if it's not just war and they've killed moms and babies and everything else they come back and it's it can mess you up huh i'm sure it takes the blood of jesus christ and complete forgiveness of god to get that cleared up don't help them with that because a lot of them just have to follow orders and do but there comes a place in time and place and war no doubt that you're gonna say look you're gonna have to shoot me because i'm gonna do that that right and if people aren't willing to die well they're gonna have to do what they're supposed to do your memory huh conscience memory reasoning all of these things all of these things that we have it has to be filled there has to be a satisfaction or doesn't it do you see how the world's trying to get satisfaction look at them they're trying to get satisfaction they want to feel good things bothers them so that's why they go to the bars and drink and smoke and all these other stuff hello things finally try to get their conscience clear to try to forget what they are really like huh all these places has to be filled with god and how many believes he can it can all be brought unto the holy spirit to where you have a free and happy conscience where you can sleep good at night my i don't know about you but i like to sleep good at night i like to feel good do you like to feel good none of us like to feel bad i mean we have feelings god made us with feelings and but those feelings were meant to be operated and felt we're meant to feel god we're meant to feel the holy spirit we're meant to feel peace and love and affection have affection and so forth that's why we were given those things and i treasure the fact that god takes care of all those things your memory when he brings back up your past oh look at my past look at that you can say that's under the blood i know because god has given me peace about it so don't remind me i'm sure everybody in here has to block out thoughts of your past sure so that you can operate you can have peace with god it's the one of the greatest treasures there is peace comes through forgiveness forgiveness comes through a complete surrendered life to god more power if you want more power how many wants more power can i tell you how let me tell you what the prophet said about having more power because i'm sure we all could use a little more holy ghost power right rabbi says and humble thyself i truly believe that brother unveil said what he said is the truth that god will never put his holy spirit in an unholy unrighteous disobedient temple no it's god come in the way of a cleansing of our hearts from all god and iniquity that we might be pure before god and then he might work his holy pure holy spirit through us to bring us to these things bring thee things to pass you know people want power and they don't really know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the way up now amen how many places the way up is down if you really want power see how humble you can be how many knows it takes humility to even surrender when you're wrong it takes humility like i did with my son son you're right hey i'm your dad don't talk to me like that i could have said that i ain't putting up with no but i look that's the truth now i'm gonna humble myself and say look i apologize you're right huh takes humility see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and thinking and humble yourselves before god and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building makes a lot of noise but during the week he just can't control his self huh i put that extra in there but that's basically what he's saying because people can run a little building and they can shout and scream and speak in tongues they still don't got power if they haven't done this next phrase see make a whole lot of noise because you've been able to conquer yourself oh praise the lord it's just never ending the word of god is just never ending what is the biggest battle you'll ever fight think about it that comes easy right the biggest battle you'll ever fight is fighting yourself and i say that because brother banham said your greatest enemy is yourself right if your greatest enemy is yourself and that's going to be your biggest battle and it will also be your biggest victory imagine have so much power by the time somebody comes up and up slaps you upside down huh and to actually let nothing in there riley because our flesh would want to jump real quick they would take the power of the holy ghost to ask one question why did you do that huh why did you do that because i don't like you could you say well i like you can i give you a hug here's the other one smacks your jaws over to the side now can i give you a hug i love you i'm praying for you he wouldn't know what to do with you what is wrong with that guy let me tell you that would be real power the easiest the easy thing must be gone that would be easy wouldn't it the flash should be so easy for the flesh to do that you want to smack me i do bigger stuff than that huh but the flesh always it wants to just rile up but listen wouldn't that be good do you know the lord jesus he would ask what gives you such power how can you contain yourself how can you control yourself what do you think road rage is people can't control their self they have no power over their flesh how many knows we need power over this flesh if you can conquer this listen to what the prophet said then you've got more power you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to god you would say if you smack me jesus said if somebody smacks you turn the other cheek how many knows they smacked him they plucked his beard they spit on him did he ever have one little a little animosity against them no what did he say he says father forgive them he didn't even say look at them and say i forgive you for that because maybe they would think he would be doing something he says father forgive them for they don't know what to do in his heart he wanted them forgiven amen that's and remember after jesus said all these things go the extra mile do all these things the last thing he said be perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect i believe means be perfectly in christ completely in christ amen because if you're not completely in christ you won't be able to do some of those things amen humble yourself before him that's really power you showed me a church that's humble real humble not arrogant folks i've lived long enough to know whether it's me you or anybody in the church you let somebody think they're better than somebody else you let somebody to think they know more about it than somebody else you got trouble on your hands immediate pride is immediate trouble and it's not of god not an arrogant just a sweet humble church and i'll show you a church that has favor and power of god in it that's right 2022 how many would say that's we want that in our church let's have that in our church no pride just humble everybody else is better than you everybody else knows more about it than you and if you have to correct somebody do it in gentleness and in sweetness and in love how many believe that because we want i want the power of god in my life and then i want the power of god in your life we'll only achieve it by following the directions amen so how many kept their foot off the gas pedal this week hey come on there we go tommy yeah one hand come on folks i have my hands up i kept it off you know i said this ain't so hard do you know what i had a sweet thought i had a good thought whenever i was doing it you had kept it off and i thought you know if god asks us you'll should like this if god asks us to do something for him why is it so hard the greatest honor that we can have or do have is to do something that god asks us to do i mean it's doing it for god because why not because that's going to get you to heaven we don't go to heaven by our works but if we say we love god and don't keep his commandments the bible calls us a liar we do it because because he saved us he's given the holy ghost and we want to be like enoch we want to be pleasing to god that's why i do it because i want to be pleasing to god another thought that the lord gave me he says you honor god and god will honor you you want to see god heal you when you're sick you want to do this how well have you got amen because that's how much god's going to honor you then brother ban says above everything love god and love one another and be humble with god and around one another and god will bless it it's hard telling what he will do usually when a church begins to get in numbers and get a little bigger and something like that then they get away from that real thing the real thing not to think not necessarily just a church we got a big church we got a good group god's blessings with a good group of people i mean thankful for a good group of people folks i'm thankful for it and but the thing is that i think about it is god has prospered us how many has prospered god has prospered you he's blessed you god's good to you amen but even those things if you aren't careful right can lead you away from god if you get the soft you begin dirty you get not having that real love anymore not that real zeal for god anymore got a nice warm home and so forth and you got a nice screen and you got a computer and you can just watch church at home now like i say we're in a pandemic in our elderly and so forth i'm not getting on people that should baby be home but anybody that is not sick you're doing just fine here's just lazy you deserve a rebuke it's not pleasing to the lord amen it's not you well you got a long way you're just out of the other but you know you're young and so forth and can do it amen and i'm not preaching to anybody but yet i'm preaching to everybody because i don't want it i don't want it to get that way in this church because it isn't a lot of churches for people just get too lazy and just stay home for no reason bible didn't say to do that come together assemble ourselves together but anyway listen so it talks about that get better things and everything else we get away from that real devotion that dedication that waiting for the lord to come let me just close with this you reap benefits of calvary when you completely surrender yourself to god and you possess the richest things that jesus died on calvary for that is peace it's love it's joy it's salvation it's fellowship protection i mean it's protection a lot of these people have uh you know they're there what do they call it it's private security to watch over them huh how many knows you got private security you got angels watching over you nothing can happen to you them angels protect you amen and this best thing of all is that love of god that's in your heart that relationship and that fellowship that you have it is so precious that you wouldn't want to lose it for nothing now how many knows it was so precious in the dark ages that they would rather be fed to a lion than to give it up and his big claws and ripped me to wreck me apart until i'm dead but i don't want to lose this huh burn me at the stake whatever you want to do but i'm can't let go of this amen how many remember now remember in this laodicea people will forfeit your holy spirit for this little slightest little whim least little thing paul said it this way who shall separate us from the love of god shall tribulation huh shall bad times hard times is this going to separate you not if you're really completely surrendered you know job look at joe a lot what he lost and and and the other person that i i think about is the person that that song it is well with my soul i'm not sure if his two daughters his wife and a couple of his children right went down in the ocean the went down isn't that right from what i understand when he was going across that same spot he wrote that song it's a precious song it talks about when trials come my way and waves like trials like see billows roll amen whatever that was whatever my lot die has taught me to say it is well amen that's family members people that you love so much and then you can still say it's well why because christ is there paul said distress persecution famine nakedness peril sword [Music] and as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the way along we are counted as sheep to the slaughter but nay in all these things i am convinced through all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us if i persuaded that neither death life angels principalities powers things present things to come and aren't you glad for that kind of god for that kind of anchor in your life that all these lukewarmness layouts riches cares of life all these things it's not going to separate me from my love for god how many is with me none of these things are going to separate from me from the way that i love god not things present nor things to come not height not depth nor any creatures shall be able to separate us from the love of god which was in which is in christ jesus our lord amen god bless you let's stand musicians if you'll come mike if you pulled that song up i am weak but thou art strong just a closer walk with thee with our heads bowed so we don't and close your eyes shut your eyes to all the world to think of him now i trust that everybody is getting closer to the lord i hope you feel closer to him than you have in weeks past we must get closer to him there's only one way to do that and that is to dedicate ourselves more humble ourselves more commit ourselves more to the word of god and to please and to be pleasing to him how many would raise their hand and say i just want a closer walk brother i just want a closer walk closer walk god bless you god bless you my hand is up lord jesus you see those hearts you see what's going through their minds you see how they feel about you lord you see the things that they go through in the trials and things lord now i ask in your precious name god that you just continue lord to draw us all closer to you lord jesus help us to separate ourselves from all our unbelief separate ourselves from anything that is contrary to you and to your word lord father our prophet taught us that eve brought us into this condition by disbelieving one word and we have to believe all of the word if we're going to be restored again to the garden of eden and lord that's our desire is to take little by little lord jesus until all unbelief is gone lord we ask god forgive us of our failures and our sins lord wash us by thy blood lord and we thank you lord jesus for the relationship for what you do in our lives lord when we completely surrender to you that we have peace of mind that we have a clear conscience lord that we have joy that we have unspeakable joy and full of glory that we can walk with you and have fellowship with you on a daily basis and no matter what comes our way tribulation or how we would be treated we have mercy and grace that we'd have lord have nothing but the holy spirit living in our lives every way in our lives lord we meet you lord in disguise and jesus name amen and amen i am weak but thou art [Music] keep me from our own [Music] and i'll be satisfied as [Music] oh [Music] is my plea as lord daily [Music] yesterday walking close today yes let it be dear lord let it be [Music] through this world of toilets and if i [Music] check [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh just all with
