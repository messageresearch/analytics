[8:09] Good morning.
[8:11] Uh the children can be dismissed for
[8:13] Sunday school.
[8:17] uh before we open up in prayer, my
[8:19] father-in-law went for the his scan
[8:21] Friday and uh you know, he had prostate
[8:25] cancer, so they wanted to do a scan to
[8:26] make sure that his uh cancer didn't
[8:28] spread. So, we're just going to trust
[8:30] and pray when he goes Tuesday that not
[8:32] only that it wouldn't spread, but they
[8:34] wouldn't be able to find any cancer
[8:35] whatsoever.
[8:37] Uh brother Matt Lingley, would you take
[8:39] that before the church and then open up
[8:41] a prayer, please?
[8:45] Yeah, we all can stand. Sorry.
[9:05] Lord
[9:08] attack
[9:20] us all
[9:22] situ.
[9:32] Amen. If we would, we'll turn to Psalms
[9:34] 34.
[9:56] I will bless the Lord at all times. His
[9:59] praise shall continually be in my mouth.
[10:08] Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us
[10:11] all exalt his name together.
[10:19] They looked unto him and were lightened
[10:21] and their faces were not ashamed.
[10:30] The angel of the Lord encampeth round
[10:33] about them that fear him and deliver
[10:35] them.
[10:42] Oh, fear the Lord, ye his saints, for
[10:44] there is no want to them that fear him.
[10:55] Come ye children, hearken unto me. I
[10:57] will teach you the fear of the Lord.
[11:08] from speaking
[11:09] guile.
[11:15] The eyes of the Lord are upon the
[11:17] righteous and his ears are open unto
[11:19] their cry.
[11:27] The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth,
[11:29] and deliver them out of all their
[11:31] troubles.
[11:40] Many are the afflictions of the
[11:41] righteous, but the Lord deliverth him
[11:43] out of them all.
[11:49] Evil evil shall slay the wicked, and
[11:52] they that hate the righteous shall be
[11:54] desolate. The Lord redeemth the soul of
[11:57] his servants, and none of them that
[11:59] trust in him shall be desolate. Brother
[12:02] Brian
[12:15] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[12:19] I hope you all feel good this morning. I
[12:22] was just wanted to re read that one
[12:24] verse there.
[12:26] You know, it says, and I was reading
[12:28] some of those quotes that were on the
[12:30] back wall as we were waiting for service
[12:32] to start. You know, we were mentioning
[12:36] Brother Wallace, but I know there's
[12:38] several people in this congregation that
[12:40] need a touch from the Lord also. And
[12:43] this verse right here, taste and see
[12:45] that the Lord is good. Taste and see.
[12:48] Well, you have that opportunity this
[12:50] morning. it. You know, the quotes were
[12:52] talking about a God that has flesh on
[12:55] it, a God that you can touch every day
[12:57] of your life, every minute, every second
[12:59] of your life. You don't have to be
[13:01] hindered. He's there for you this
[13:03] morning. And it says, "Taste the Lord
[13:05] and see that the Lord is good and
[13:07] blessed is the man that trust in him."
[13:09] And I was just reading some of them
[13:12] quotes this morning. if you would turn
[13:13] with me to uh John the the epistle of
[13:17] John 1 John and the fifth verse, but I
[13:21] was wanting to read something.
[13:26] I was going to, you know, I can say
[13:28] something here. I'm not afraid to say
[13:30] it. You know, you can come up here for
[13:32] 30 years and you can, it's like you
[13:35] start new every time you come up here.
[13:38] You know, you can you can pray, you can
[13:40] read God's word, but if he doesn't
[13:42] quicken it to your heart and to your
[13:44] spirit, sometimes you just don't you
[13:46] have to walk out in faith. But I was
[13:48] reading um I hope I got the right one
[13:51] here this morning. Yeah, this is the
[13:53] right one. Uh the uh devotional
[13:57] yesterday in the spoken word on their
[14:00] application.
[14:02] I was reading it and I was listening to
[14:04] that message and the really the thing
[14:06] that struck me the out of the theme that
[14:08] I took and I can only speak for myself
[14:10] from the message
[14:12] is he was talking to the congregation
[14:15] and I was just thinking that was I
[14:17] wasn't even born yet when he was talking
[14:19] to the congregation you know that was 66
[14:22] years ago and he was talking about a
[14:25] consecration that the church needed and
[14:27] that was 66 years ago and I'm thinking
[14:30] in the here 2025. Where should we be
[14:34] this morning? How consecrated should we
[14:37] be as believers this morning to the
[14:39] purpose of Jesus Christ? And I'll just
[14:41] read what he brother Brandham had to
[14:44] say. Uh this is the quote. I'm sure some
[14:48] of you've already read it this morning.
[14:50] And this was um
[14:55] this is Yeah, I was one revelation on
[14:59] the sacred sand. This is uh in the
[15:02] message who is this and I listened to
[15:05] this message a couple of times and like
[15:07] I said he was talking about a
[15:09] consecration that the believer should
[15:10] have and we should have that every day
[15:13] where we're putting everything aside to
[15:15] embrace the cross and be closer to Jesus
[15:18] Christ. You know, I as I read the Psalms
[15:21] and, you know, I read the word of God,
[15:24] read the message,
[15:26] God's really asking us to put our whole
[15:29] trust and confidence in him. Uh, you
[15:32] have to live your life every day. I
[15:34] mean, we all have our situations in
[15:36] life, but you should never let your
[15:38] situations put you in a place where you
[15:41] can't fellowship with the living God.
[15:43] You know, sometimes you can let yourself
[15:45] get so burdened but down by whether it's
[15:48] a physical or whether it's a mental
[15:50] thing that you're just not worshiping
[15:52] the Lord the way he needs to be
[15:53] worshiped. You just got to cast it all
[15:55] down and reach out to the cross. And I
[15:58] was let me just I keep I can't every
[16:01] time I start reading it something now
[16:03] one revelation on the sacred sand one
[16:05] time upon the place men can never be the
[16:08] same. So basically once you meet him you
[16:10] can ever be a a man before he should
[16:13] call himself a Christian before he can
[16:15] identify himself he should first have
[16:17] that backside of the desert experience
[16:20] and that's what we all need this morning
[16:22] and not just one time it should be
[16:24] something we're seeing every day in our
[16:26] lives where God is shaving more and more
[16:29] off of us that become more like him and
[16:32] he and I lost my place again before he
[16:36] can identify himself he should first
[16:38] have that backside of the desert
[16:39] experience where he met God face to
[16:42] face. And I hope everyone here this
[16:44] morning has had that experience where
[16:46] you know that you know that God is alive
[16:49] and that he's in your soul, hot and
[16:51] spirit this morning. Forgive the New
[16:54] York accent there. Today you can have
[16:56] any kind of an answer. You can see the
[16:59] Lord perform exactly what he said he
[17:02] would do and smart theologians will
[17:05] explain it away. And that's where we're
[17:07] at this morning. You know, it's so easy
[17:10] to let the world explain away the the
[17:12] the goodness of God. So, you got to be
[17:15] careful what you pay attention to, what
[17:17] you allow to inhabit your soul and
[17:19] spirit. And he goes on there was that
[17:22] was for another day. Well, you hear that
[17:24] every day. It was for this or was for
[17:26] another age or it was wrong. Like I
[17:29] said, Jesus, he is Beloved,
[17:33] the devil. He's a fortune teller. all
[17:35] these things they have an answer. Well,
[17:37] they say the same thing today about this
[17:39] message, but you just disregard it. If
[17:42] you, like I said, if you know that you
[17:44] know God has testified to your heart and
[17:47] spirit that this is the truth for the
[17:49] hour, what do you care what people think
[17:51] about you? Not to say that you want that
[17:54] you're not concerned. You want you don't
[17:55] want to turn your friends away or your
[17:58] family away, but in the end, God's the
[18:00] only thing that matters. I you know as a
[18:03] young man I can I can remember talking
[18:06] to my family as a young man you know not
[18:09] having a family that was ever raised in
[18:11] the message you know there's a period of
[18:13] time when your family will fight against
[18:15] you when you receive the word of God in
[18:17] the message and as I've noticed as life
[18:20] goes on you know they start coming back
[18:23] your way after a while. So you just have
[18:25] to love them. You just got to be close
[18:27] to them and just don't let what they
[18:29] think affect you. And he goes on to say,
[18:31] like I said, Jesus, he's I've lost my
[18:34] but when this man ever came in contact
[18:36] with Christ and seeing him as Paul did
[18:39] and experience him, there's not enough
[18:41] theologians in the world to be able to
[18:43] explain away that experience from a man.
[18:46] And brother Brandham, I'll just finish
[18:49] this quote. And and that's the reason
[18:51] today they don't have the experience.
[18:53] See, it's easy for men and people to
[18:57] want to take education over a revelation
[19:00] or take some type of physical evidence
[19:03] over a real st a real experience in
[19:06] Jesus Christ. And I lost my place
[19:08] against see him as Paul did experience
[19:11] him. There's not enough theologians in
[19:13] the world to be able to explain away
[19:15] that experience away from a man. And I
[19:19] hope that's where everyone is this
[19:20] morning. no matter what they say to you
[19:22] out in the world, what your family says
[19:24] to you, whatever that you know that you
[19:27] know that they can't reason it away from
[19:29] you anymore. And he goes on to say
[19:31] that's the reason today that they don't
[19:34] have an experience. That the reason they
[19:36] can't say they all saying who is this,
[19:39] what is this? Where does it come from?
[19:42] They don't have the answer. Why? Because
[19:44] all they know is theology. some church
[19:46] was made has made not to know theology
[19:50] as life, not to know the Bible as life,
[19:52] but to know him as life. But if you know
[19:55] him, his word testifies to the life of
[19:58] Jesus Christ in it. There you have to
[20:00] have them both together. And he go to
[20:02] know him as your personal savior, as the
[20:05] one who's filled you with his presence.
[20:08] You were there when it happened. There's
[20:10] nobody can take it away from you. And
[20:12] that's where we're at this morning. You
[20:14] either embrace the cross and the word of
[20:16] God and the message of the hour, you'll
[20:18] find yourself walking away from it
[20:20] someday. You got to draw closer to it or
[20:23] you'll find yourself getting further.
[20:25] There's no in between anymore. You
[20:27] either get closer or you're going to get
[20:29] further away. And it goes on. You were
[20:32] when it happened. There's nobody can
[20:34] take it away from you. There's no one
[20:36] that can explain it away for you. When
[20:39] that experience happens to you, you know
[20:41] who he is to me. He is Christ Jesus the
[20:44] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[20:47] I'll just go finish with this thought.
[20:50] And in the in today's devotional,
[20:52] brother Brandham was I'm not going to
[20:53] read that quote. I don't want to take
[20:55] all that time. But he was two things.
[20:58] You have to have an experience. And that
[21:01] experience should bring the love of
[21:02] Christ in your heart and life. You'll
[21:04] always deal with people in love, not in
[21:07] hatred, not in anger. Not to say we
[21:10] don't make mistakes, but the love of God
[21:12] will want you to be at peace with your
[21:14] neighbor, be at peace with your brother
[21:16] and sister. So, I'll just jump here if I
[21:19] didn't lose my place here
[21:22] and lose paper here all over the place.
[21:38] This is the longest I've been quiet up
[21:40] here in a long time.
[21:46] I'm just one of them people. Once I get
[21:48] going, I have a hard time stopping. But
[21:50] I'll just read uh if I read the whole
[21:52] chapter, you'll have to forgive me. But
[21:54] it really speaks to where we need to be.
[21:56] When I feel led to stop, I'll stop. But
[21:59] it really struck me this morning. I was
[22:01] also thinking sitting there this
[22:02] morning. There's two type of people in
[22:05] the world this morning. And I was
[22:07] thinking of the footprints of the sand
[22:09] of time. There's two type of people in
[22:11] that experience. I want to be that
[22:14] person where I see God has carried me
[22:16] through my troubles and my circumstances
[22:19] where I haven't carried I I've got to be
[22:21] honest. I I'm a man. I know who I am.
[22:24] I'm one of them guys that I will run
[22:26] into a wall for a hund times before I
[22:29] ask God to open the door. I know who I
[22:31] am. But I don't want to be that guy. I
[22:34] want to be the guy that looks to the
[22:36] Lord and ask him to open the door and
[22:38] not get frustrated and keep slamming
[22:40] into the door realizing that all you
[22:43] have to do is ask for God's help. I'll
[22:45] just and then about that experience
[22:48] there's always God's always going to
[22:51] carry you over those circumstances and
[22:53] then when your time and your life is
[22:55] over you're going to realize how much
[22:58] God was actually in your life. how many
[23:00] circumstances without even realizing he
[23:02] was pushing you forward in life. And
[23:05] I'll just read what uh brother John had
[23:07] to say here. Whosoever believeth that
[23:10] Jesus is the Christ, it goes to what the
[23:12] quotes were saying up there this
[23:14] morning. Whosoever that believeth Jesus
[23:16] is the Christ is born of God. Everyone
[23:19] that loveth him begottth loveth him that
[23:22] is begotten of him. And I what strikes
[23:25] me here, if you really have the love of
[23:28] God, everything in you will t testify
[23:30] back to the word of God. You can't have
[23:32] one without the other. By this we know
[23:35] that we have loved the children of God
[23:37] when we love God and keep his
[23:38] commandments. For this is the love of
[23:41] God that we keep the commandments and
[23:43] his commandments are not grievous. This
[23:45] goes back from all the way back from the
[23:47] 13th to the 17th chapter also of the
[23:50] gospel of John. You can find these same
[23:52] scriptures all the way back there. And
[23:54] whosoever is born of God or overcometh
[23:57] the world, and this is the victory that
[23:59] overcometh the world, even our faith, he
[24:03] who is he that overcomemeth the world,
[24:05] but he that believeth that Jesus is the
[24:07] son of God. And this is the same that
[24:10] came by water, blood, and even Jesus
[24:12] Christ, not by water only, but by water
[24:15] and blood. As it is the spirit that
[24:17] beareth witness, because the spirit is
[24:19] truth. For there are three that bear
[24:23] record in heaven, the Father, the Word,
[24:25] and the Holy Ghost. And these three are
[24:27] one. And there are and there are three
[24:30] that bear witness in the earth, the
[24:32] spirit, the water, and the blood. And
[24:33] these three agree on if we receive the
[24:35] witness of men, the witness of God is
[24:38] greater. And he's talking about if we
[24:40] see what the apostles and all the holy
[24:43] men of God have said about of God. For
[24:45] this is the witness of God. We have
[24:47] testified his son. He that believeth on
[24:49] the son hath the witness in himself. And
[24:52] he that believeth not that God made him
[24:54] a liar because he believeth not the
[24:57] record that God gave his son. And I'll
[24:59] finish there. I don't want to read. But
[25:01] if I had a simple thought for this
[25:03] morning,
[25:05] as we see that I won't say it this way
[25:08] as we as we start every day a new I
[25:11] think that God is calling. I can only
[25:14] speak for myself. It's calling for me as
[25:16] a Christian or as a believer to be more
[25:19] consecrated to the word of God. It's a
[25:21] late hour. We see it's a late hour and
[25:25] we're like I said, as I said earlier,
[25:27] we're going to go two directions. You're
[25:29] either going to get closer or you're
[25:30] going to get further. And the more you
[25:32] play out there in the things of the
[25:34] world and the things that have no no
[25:36] foundation, no meaning, you're going to
[25:38] find yourself waking up one day and
[25:40] you're going to say, "I ran after the
[25:43] wrong thing." I want to wake up one day
[25:45] and know that I followed the right
[25:47] thing. Brother Josh,
[26:07] is it good to be here this morning?
[26:09] Amen. Just want to say a quick welcome
[26:11] to all our visitors. Some I know, some I
[26:13] don't, but it's good to have you here.
[26:14] We just feel welcome this morning. Amen.
[26:17] Let's sing that song. I will bless thee,
[26:19] oh Lord. I will bless the Lord. Give F
[26:21] this morning.
[26:23] Amen. That's what we're here to do. Just
[26:24] bless his name. With my hands lifted up.
[26:32] Oh, and my mouth filled with praise.
[26:38] And with a heart of thanksgiving,
[26:45] I will bless thee, oh Lord, with my
[26:48] hands lifted up. Oh, with my hands
[26:52] lifted up
[26:56] and my mouth filled with praise
[27:02] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[27:05] [Music]
[27:08] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[27:11] [Music]
[27:14] Oh, I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[27:20] I will bless thee, oh Lord,
[27:26] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[27:31] I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless
[27:35] thee, oh Lord.
[27:38] [Music]
[27:42] Oh, I will bless thee, oh Lord,
[27:49] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[27:54] I will bless thee, oh Lord, with my
[27:58] hands lifted up. With my hands lifted up
[28:06] and my mouth filled with praise
[28:11] and with a heart of thanksgiving.
[28:17] I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless
[28:21] thee, oh Lord. I will bless thee, oh
[28:25] Lord.
[28:27] [Music]
[28:29] Oh, I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[28:32] [Music]
[28:39] Oh, I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[28:44] [Music]
[28:46] Amen. It was a great thing that he did
[28:48] for me.
[28:51] The Lord has brought me
[28:55] through all of my trials.
[28:59] And when I fail him,
[29:03] he didn't cast me away.
[29:07] He stood right by me.
[29:11] Through all of my troubles.
[29:14] When I was lost, he didn't let me go
[29:19] astray.
[29:22] He took my sins
[29:24] [Music]
[29:26] and he saved my soul.
[29:30] He cleaned me up
[29:33] and he made me whole.
[29:37] My Jesus died on Calvary
[29:42] so the whole wide world could see. It
[29:46] was a great thing
[29:48] that he did for me.
[29:52] Oh, it was a great thing
[29:56] that he did for me.
[30:00] Oh, it was a great thing
[30:03] when he set me free.
[30:08] Jesus died on Calvary
[30:12] and so the whole wide world could see it
[30:16] was a great thing
[30:19] that he did for me.
[30:22] And he's been my doctor.
[30:26] He's been my lawyer.
[30:30] He's never left me.
[30:33] He's been my friend.
[30:37] He's been my comforter.
[30:41] When I was lonely
[30:44] and when I was lost,
[30:47] my Jesus took me in.
[30:52] And he took my sin
[30:56] and he saved my soul.
[30:59] He cleaned me up.
[31:03] and he made me whole.
[31:06] Oh my Jesus died on Calvary
[31:11] so the whole wide world could see. It
[31:15] was a great thing that he did for me.
[31:22] It was a great thing
[31:25] that he did for me.
[31:29] It was a great thing
[31:32] when he set me free.
[31:36] And Jesus died on Calvary
[31:40] so the whole wide world could see. It
[31:44] was a great thing. Let's sing that
[31:47] second verse one more time.
[31:50] Oh yes, he's been my doctor
[31:54] and he's been my lawyer.
[31:58] He's never left me.
[32:01] He's been my friend.
[32:04] [Music]
[32:05] He's been my comforter.
[32:09] When I was lonely.
[32:12] When I was lost,
[32:15] my Jesus took me in.
[32:20] He took my sin
[32:23] and he saved my soul.
[32:27] He cleaned me up
[32:30] and he made me whole.
[32:34] Oh my Jesus died on Calvary
[32:38] so the whole wide world could see. It
[32:42] was a great thing that he did for me.
[32:49] Oh, it was a great thing that he did for
[32:54] me.
[32:56] Yes, it was a great thing when he set me
[33:01] free.
[33:04] Jesus died on Calvary
[33:08] so the whole wide world could see. It
[33:11] was a great thing
[33:14] that he did for me.
[33:18] Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise
[33:20] this morning.
[33:22] Lord, we thank you for what you've done
[33:23] for us this morning. I thank you, Lord,
[33:26] for opening our eyes this morning. Amen.
[33:29] Let's sing. Who I am, Lord, who I am.
[33:33] Oh, glorious victory.
[33:37] That day he set me free.
[33:42] And he made my heart
[33:45] [Music]
[33:46] his very throne.
[33:50] My life is no longer mine.
[33:55] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[33:59] And now I live
[34:02] [Music]
[34:03] to praise his name.
[34:06] [Music]
[34:07] Oh who I am, Lord.
[34:12] Who I am.
[34:16] I can see now
[34:20] who I am.
[34:23] I'm a part of my savior.
[34:27] I'm a part of his word.
[34:31] It's a revelation
[34:35] of who I am.
[34:39] And on Calvary
[34:42] he died to redeem his lost bride.
[34:47] The King of Kings
[34:51] became my Savior.
[34:55] This is God's great mystery
[34:59] of love expressed to me that Christ and
[35:05] I
[35:07] might be made one.
[35:11] Oh, who I am, Lord.
[35:15] Who I am.
[35:18] [Music]
[35:19] I can see now
[35:23] who I am.
[35:26] I'm a part of my savior,
[35:31] a part of his word.
[35:34] It's a revelation
[35:37] [Music]
[35:38] of who? Let's sing that second verse one
[35:40] more time. For on Calvary,
[35:44] he died to redeem his lost bride,
[35:50] the King of Kings.
[35:54] He became my savior.
[35:58] This is God's great mystery
[36:02] of love expressed to me that Christ and
[36:07] I
[36:10] might be made one.
[36:13] Oh, who I am, Lord.
[36:18] Who I am,
[36:21] who I can't see now.
[36:29] Oh, I'm a part of my savior,
[36:33] a part of his word.
[36:37] It's a revelation
[36:39] [Music]
[36:41] of who I am.
[36:46] Amen. Can we sing? Let the worshippers
[36:48] arise this morning. Amen. Brother Brad
[36:50] sent me a a verse that we're going to
[36:52] try this morning. I think I said brother
[36:54] Tim Puit wrote the Yeah, brother Tim
[36:56] Puit wrote some extra verses to this
[36:58] song and it's really a blessing. Says,
[37:00] "Father, I see a bride in power with
[37:02] full authority. She is claiming every
[37:04] promise and believing what she speaks.
[37:06] Every weapon formed against her has
[37:08] fallen at her feet. Oh, hear her praise.
[37:10] The King of Kings." Amen. So, let's just
[37:13] sing this morning. Give the Lord praise
[37:14] and worship. Walking in victory this
[37:16] morning. Oh father, I see that you are
[37:21] drawing
[37:23] a line in the sand. I want to be

[37:35] kingom come.
[37:38] Let it live in me. This is my prayer
[37:45] and this is my plea.
[37:48] Let the worshipers arise.
[37:53] [Music]
[37:55] Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing.
[38:01] [Music]
[38:03] I'm surrendering
[38:05] my all.
[38:11] I surrender to the king.
[38:19] And father, I hear it growing louder.
[38:25] The song of your redeemed as the saints
[38:29] of every nation
[38:32] are awakening.
[38:34] The sing from our hearts there comes an
[38:38] anthem. Oh, hear the heavens ring. This
[38:43] is our song.

[40:45] that third verse one more time. Father,
[40:47] I see a bride in power.
[40:50] When Father, I see a bride in power
[40:55] with full authority.
[40:58] She is claiming every promise
[41:02] and believing what she speaks. Every
[41:06] weapon formed against her has fallen at
[41:11] her feet. Oh, hear her praise.
[41:14] [Music]

[42:06] victory this morning? Amen. Before we go
[42:08] to prayer, let's sing, "Blessed be the
[42:10] Lord God Almighty."
[42:12] Amen. If you have a need on your heart,
[42:14] Amen. He's here to meet your need this
[42:15] morning. And let's just sing this for a
[42:17] prayer. Father
[42:20] in heaven,
[42:22] we love you.
[42:27] We lift your name in all
[42:31] the earth.
[42:35] May your kingdom be established
[42:40] in our praises.
[42:44] as your people
[42:46] declare your mighty works.
[42:51] Blessed be the Lord
[42:55] God
[42:57] Almighty
[43:01] who was and is and is
[43:05] to come.
[43:08] Blessed be the Lord
[43:12] God
[43:13] Almighty
[43:17] who reigns
[43:19] forever
[43:22] more
[43:25] and father of mercy be exalted.
[43:33] May Jesus name be lifted
[43:38] high
[43:41] before his sacrifice of love has won my
[43:46] pardon
[43:49] and his resurrection
[43:52] power gives me life.
[43:56] Blessed be the Lord
[44:00] God
[44:01] Almighty
[44:02] [Music]
[44:05] who was and is and is
[44:09] to come.
[44:12] Blessed be the Lord,
[44:16] God
[44:17] Almighty,
[44:21] who reigns
[44:23] forever
[44:25] more.
[44:26] [Music]
[44:29] Amen. You may be seated this morning as
[44:31] we go to prayer. Amen. Just wonderful
[44:34] atmosphere here this morning. We just
[44:36] have one written prayer request,
[44:38] excuse me, from Sister Becky. We want to
[44:39] remember sister Laura, Sarah, and Tori.
[44:42] They're not feeling well this morning,
[44:44] and they'll be streaming. Amen. Brother
[44:45] Danny, brother Michael John, and brother
[44:48] Glenn, if you'd come for the offering
[44:49] this morning.
[44:51] [Music]
[44:54] Amen. Brother John Wade, if you just
[44:56] stand and take us for the Lord this
[44:58] morning.
[46:28] Brother Matt, did you have a song for us
[46:29] this morning?
[46:32] Okay. Amen. As he comes from prayers,
[46:34] listening, I'm amazed that you love me
[46:36] this morning.
[46:38] Oh, I'm amazed
[46:42] [Music]
[46:43] that you love me.
[46:48] Bless you. Good to see you.
[46:52] How you care
[46:54] [Music]
[46:56] through your preious
[47:00] blood I found pardon
[47:05] and my sins
[47:08] are washed.
[47:10] They're all washed away. All my sins
[47:16] are washed
[47:18] away.
[47:20] [Music]
[47:24] Amen. So, if everybody take your book,
[47:26] well, you probably got the words, I
[47:28] would not be denied.
[47:30] And uh the songs we've been singing this
[47:32] morning have been awesome leading right
[47:34] up to this. Goes right along with it.
[47:38] So, when we sing this song, we're not
[47:39] just singing an old hymn that some dude
[47:41] wrote a long time ago, right?
[47:43] So, if he was anointed by the Holy
[47:45] Spirit to write this, these words are
[47:48] for us even today.
[47:50] And if we're God's children, we have
[47:52] God's seed in us. And that's why when
[47:54] we're going through things, it's not
[47:56] like,
[47:57] I don't like what's going on. I don't
[47:59] like the trial, so I'm going to say some
[48:01] words and just say, I refuse to submit.
[48:03] Like the world pushes this whole thing.
[48:06] Just rise up and you can be whatever you
[48:08] want to be.
[48:10] Well, that's missing the revelation of
[48:11] who you are. That's the most they can do
[48:14] because they're not God's seed. But if
[48:16] you're God's seed, you can't be denied.
[48:19] And no matter what's going on in your
[48:20] life, there's just something that just
[48:22] can't accept it. So anyway, let's just
[48:24] sing a song and let's just enjoy
[48:26] worshiping Jesus about it.
[48:29] I've got no clue what I'm singing in. U
[48:33] excuse me. When pains of death seized on
[48:38] my soul, unto the Lord I cried.
[48:44] Till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[48:50] would not be denied.
[48:54] Yes, I would not be denied.
[49:00] I would not be denied.
[49:05] Till Jesus came and made me whole, I
[49:11] would not be denied.
[49:16] Now Jacob in the days of old I wrestled
[49:24] with the Lord.
[49:27] Oh, but in an instant we will a courage
[49:32] b I stood upon his word.
[49:38] Yes, I would not be denied.
[49:43] Yes, I would not be denied
[49:49] till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[49:56] would not be denied.
[50:01] No, Satan said that my Lord was gone and
[50:07] would not hear my prayer.
[50:11] Oh, but praise the Lord. His work is
[50:16] done and Christ my Lord is here. Yes, I
[50:24] would not be denied.
[50:28] Yes, I would not be denied
[50:34] till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[50:41] would not be denied. Stand up. Let's
[50:45] sing that again. I would not be denied.
[50:51] I would not be denied
[50:57] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[51:03] would not be. Let's sing that third
[51:06] verse again.
[51:08] Now old Satan said, "My Lord was gone
[51:14] and would not hear my prayer." Don't he
[51:18] say that? But praise the Lord for the
[51:23] work is done and Christ my Lord is here.
[51:30] Yes, I would not be denied.
[51:37] I would not be denied
[51:42] till Jesus came and he made me whole.
[51:48] I would not be denied.
[51:53] Yes, I would not be
[51:59] I would not be denied
[52:04] until Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[52:11] would not be denied.
[52:16] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[52:18] praise.
[52:20] Amen. We appreciate that, brother Matt.
[52:22] Thank you so much. Amen. We're just
[52:24] going to turn the service right over,
[52:25] brother, at this point. And Amen. Let's
[52:27] just sing that song as an anthem. Let's
[52:29] just sing it again as he comes morning.
[52:31] Just have it on our lips. I would not be
[52:33] denied. And let's just press into the
[52:34] kingdom this morning. Amen. Oh, I would
[52:38] not be denied.
[52:41] Oh, I would not be denied.
[52:48] Till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[52:54] would not be denied.
[52:59] Lord Satan said my Lord was gone and he
[53:06] would not hear my prayer.
[53:11] I praise the Lord. The work is done and
[53:18] Christ the Lord is here
[53:22] and I would not be denied.
[53:28] Oh, I would not be denied
[53:34] until Jesus came and he made me
[53:41] would not be
[53:45] [Music]
[53:58] morning. All right, I've got it on now.
[54:01] Amen. So, praise. Good to see everybody.
[54:04] Amen.
[54:06] God is good. We certainly enjoyed
[54:07] yesterday. I guess you get to fellowship
[54:09] one with another. Amen. I thought, you
[54:11] know, I believe that the believer ought
[54:13] to love one another enough so much that
[54:16] if it came down to it, we'd die for one
[54:18] another. Ain't that right? Amen. And
[54:20] that's how much love I believe that we
[54:21] ought to have one for another. Amen. So
[54:24] I greet you in the name of the Lord.
[54:25] Let's just bow our heads, play something
[54:27] softly while we pray, Sister Becky, our
[54:30] precious Lord and Savior, as we come
[54:32] before you this morning, Lord. Father,
[54:36] knowing Lord Jesus that we can't do
[54:37] anything in ourselves and we certain not
[54:40] relying on ourselves.
[54:43] We're relying on your spirit Lord this
[54:45] morning to come Lord Jesus and speak to
[54:48] hearts this morning, Father.
[54:50] Lord, you know how to touch hearts. You
[54:52] know how to touch lives,
[54:54] Father. And you know what's beneath
[54:55] every heart this morning, Lord, and
[54:57] every need that's represented
[54:59] this morning, Father. And so we come
[55:01] humbly before you, Lord, thanking Lord
[55:04] for the opportunity to be able to come
[55:06] together with your children, Lord, and
[55:08] to minister to the blood bought of your
[55:11] blood, Lord Jesus. Those who you have
[55:13] purchased, Lord, with your own blood,
[55:16] Father. And we ask, God, that you'd help
[55:18] us to say something that would bless,
[55:20] that would be a blessing, would benefit,
[55:22] Lord Jesus, and draw us all closer to
[55:24] you, Lord Jesus. We just want to tell
[55:27] you that we love you, Lord. And we ask,
[55:29] God, that you'd just be with those
[55:30] streaming today, Lord, wherever they
[55:32] are, Father, and bless them, Lord Jesus,
[55:34] with a walk with you and the healing and
[55:37] anything they have need of also, Father,
[55:39] it's for them, Lord. And Lord, it's just
[55:41] a real honor to be able to minister your
[55:43] word this morning. So, be with us now.
[55:45] we ask in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen.
[55:49] Praise the Lord. Amen. If you will turn
[55:52] your Bibles, we'll just get right into
[55:53] the word.
[55:55] Amen.
[56:01] Once again, we want to try not to get in
[56:03] too much of a hurry. Amen. I know that
[56:06] I've been pretty busy here the last few
[56:08] days and didn't know just what I was
[56:11] going to speak on. Amen. most of the day
[56:13] yesterday, but the entire evening I just
[56:16] felt like the Lord laid on my heart.
[56:18] Amen. To which kind of which direction
[56:20] to go and so uh we want to just kind of
[56:24] continue on with where we were. Amen.
[56:27] What we had started with Wednesday. We
[56:29] certainly didn't get done with that, but
[56:32] Amen. There's of course no ending to it,
[56:34] but there's just some other things that
[56:35] I thought that you may enjoy. Amen. I I
[56:40] certainly do. How many's glad for uh
[56:42] stored up food in spiritual food in due
[56:45] season?
[56:46] Amen. Amen.
[56:49] Amen. All right. Well, we'll tell you a
[56:53] story here in a minute. How better how
[56:55] dedic.
[57:00] Amen. If you will turn your Bibles,
[57:02] we'll go to the book of Philippians 2.
[57:06] Philippians 2.
[57:11] we do have a couple baptisms this
[57:13] morning. And I thought, well, how long
[57:16] are you going to go before you do that?
[57:17] You know, and there you're already
[57:19] trying to programming the Holy Ghost.
[57:20] And I thought another thought come says,
[57:22] you know, you got to just go as long as
[57:25] as you feel led to go. Amen.
[57:27] However long it is, because we always in
[57:29] our mind put a time frame on it. I don't
[57:32] believe Paul put a time frame on it when
[57:34] he went half the night and people fell
[57:36] out of the balcony and died and
[57:38] everything else.
[57:40] Amen. And so, you know, we just don't
[57:43] need to limit God. Amen. And so, praise
[57:46] the Lord. Amen.
[57:50] Philippians 2 verse one. If there be
[57:53] therefore any consolation in Christ, if
[57:56] any comfort of love, if any fellowship
[57:58] of the spirit, if any bowels of mercies,
[58:02] fulfill ye my joy. Amen. That ye be
[58:07] likeminded, having the same love, being
[58:09] of one accord, of one mind. Amen. Amen.
[58:14] How many knows we're speaking on the
[58:15] power of the mind? The power of the
[58:18] mind. What a powerful thing it is. And
[58:21] then and uh Amen. Let nothing be done
[58:24] through strife or vain glory, but in
[58:27] loneliness of mind. Let each esteem
[58:31] other better than themselves. Amen. Look
[58:35] not every man to his own things, but
[58:37] every man also on the things of others.
[58:39] Let this mind be in you which was also
[58:43] in Christ Jesus, who being in the form
[58:46] of God, thought it not robbery to be
[58:48] equal with God, but made himself of no
[58:51] reputation, and took on upon him the
[58:54] form of his servant, and was made in the
[58:56] likeness of men. Amen. And being found
[58:59] in the fashion of a man, he humbled
[59:01] himself and became even obedient even
[59:04] unto death, even the death of the cross.
[59:07] May God add his blessings to the reading
[59:09] of the word. You can be seated this
[59:10] morning. Now this morning as I begin to
[59:14] think about this, the Bible says that
[59:16] we're supposed to have the mind of
[59:18] Christ. And one thing I didn't get to
[59:20] and I wanted to say Wednesday was
[59:23] was that in every situation
[59:26] that you have, no matter what comes up,
[59:30] Amen. How many believes you should
[59:32] always seek the mind of Christ?
[59:36] Ain't that right?
[59:38] If we can do that, we'll be a lot better
[59:40] off.
[59:41] If you can find the mind of Christ in
[59:43] whatever comes your way, Amen. You'll do
[59:46] all right.
[59:48] Because Amen. Because there's two
[59:50] there's there's there's really two
[59:52] minds. You've got two minds.
[59:55] That's heavy right there, isn't it?
[59:58] Amen.
[1:00:00] All right. Well,
[1:00:03] that's right. Because Paul said, "For to
[1:00:05] be carnally minded
[1:00:08] is death."
[1:00:09] Is that right?
[1:00:11] But to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:00:13] peace.
[1:00:15] Amen. Because the carnal mind is emnity
[1:00:18] against God. It is not subject to God
[1:00:22] and neither in to the law of God and
[1:00:24] neither indeed can be. In other words,
[1:00:26] you just can't take your natural way of
[1:00:29] thinking. Amen. And think the thoughts
[1:00:32] of God.
[1:00:34] It's not subject to the laws of God. It
[1:00:36] says you've got to have a different
[1:00:38] mind.
[1:00:39] Amen. Wasn't it said, you know, say,
[1:00:41] "Well, they say that you've lost your
[1:00:43] mind." Yeah, that's right. Praise the
[1:00:45] Lord. And I got the mind of Christ.
[1:00:48] Amen. I might have lost my mind, but
[1:00:50] I'll tell you what, leave me alone. I'm
[1:00:52] happier this way than I was the other
[1:00:54] way.
[1:00:55] How much is happier this way with the
[1:00:58] spiritual mind than what you had with
[1:01:01] God? Brother Bam said in and I didn't
[1:01:04] not going to read read all the quotes of
[1:01:05] Wednesday, but he says your mind that
[1:01:07] battle the battle. Amen. The frontline
[1:01:10] battle of the whole warfare is is in
[1:01:12] your mind. That's the front line. That's
[1:01:15] where it all starts at what you let in.
[1:01:19] Ain't that right? But the thoughts that
[1:01:21] you allow to become, you know, I don't
[1:01:22] care the serial killers and all of them.
[1:01:25] They let certain thoughts take control
[1:01:26] of them and that's why they became
[1:01:28] serial killers. Amen. Hitler, he became
[1:01:32] what he did because of the thoughts that
[1:01:34] he allowed to come in and the prejudice
[1:01:36] and so forth that he had against the
[1:01:38] Jews.
[1:01:41] Isn't it something how that he hated the
[1:01:43] Jews and then he conveyed it to his
[1:01:44] generals and to the whole nation. Amen.
[1:01:48] So our mind is a very very important
[1:01:51] part of us. Amen. Very powerful thing.
[1:01:54] Amen. I say powerful. You may well we
[1:01:56] know that the whole power of the Holy
[1:01:57] Ghost is more powerful than the mind and
[1:02:00] everything else. But when you think
[1:02:01] about how that everything you become,
[1:02:03] everything that you are starts here. So
[1:02:06] it's very important what you let in.
[1:02:10] Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to just
[1:02:14] start with saying this. Brother Brandon
[1:02:16] was praying. He says, "Lord, I am
[1:02:18] grateful to be living in this day
[1:02:22] because this is the greatest day." He
[1:02:25] talks about, he says, "Paul the apostle
[1:02:27] long to see this day." Great men of old,
[1:02:30] the saints of all the ages long to see
[1:02:33] this day. I believe brother Bannon said
[1:02:35] one place if God would have asked him,
[1:02:37] "What age do you want to be in? Where do
[1:02:39] you want to live? And what age do you
[1:02:40] want to live?" He said, "I don't want it
[1:02:42] to live right here.
[1:02:45] [Laughter]
[1:02:47] Woo. How many know we don't realize it?
[1:02:49] You don't realize time. We let the wy
[1:02:51] wsy woos get up the better of us. And we
[1:02:54] don't realize that you're living in the
[1:02:56] best time of all of Christianity. You're
[1:02:59] living in the best hour.
[1:03:01] This is the best time to be a Christian.
[1:03:04] This is the greatest time to be a
[1:03:06] Christian of all the ages.
[1:03:11] Amen. I was thinking about this earlier.
[1:03:13] I thought about brother Tommy and and
[1:03:15] different ones of us and a lot of us
[1:03:17] maybe that are just a little bit uh over
[1:03:19] the top so to speak, you know, and I
[1:03:22] truly do believe, brother Tommy, that if
[1:03:24] we'd have been back there, if we'd have
[1:03:25] been in Paul's age, if we'd have been in
[1:03:27] that sacrificial age, the age of the ox.
[1:03:30] Hello. I don't been ashamed. We'd have
[1:03:32] come out in that arena. He says, "Where
[1:03:34] is that lion at?" Come on, do your best
[1:03:37] cuz you ain't afraid of
[1:03:40] because God gave them that. They did it
[1:03:44] with gratefulness and parents and mom
[1:03:46] and dad taught their children don't you
[1:03:48] whine, don't you cry. Hello. You go to
[1:03:52] your Amen. We're a Christian and we
[1:03:55] don't bow to the devil.
[1:03:58] To tell your own Christian and then to
[1:04:00] die with them and gather your children
[1:04:02] together. Amen. We're going to give our
[1:04:04] lives today.
[1:04:08] But we're grateful you ain't got to do
[1:04:10] that.
[1:04:11] Hallelujah. No, we're living in an hour
[1:04:13] at the coming of the Lord. We're living
[1:04:16] an hour. Hello. How many knows? We're
[1:04:18] living in the brightest day that there
[1:04:20] is spiritually since the time of Jesus
[1:04:22] himself and Paul while he was here on
[1:04:24] the earth.
[1:04:26] Amen. It shall be light in the evening
[1:04:28] time. Amen. The gross darkness is going
[1:04:31] to be upon the people, but rise and
[1:04:33] shine for your light has come.
[1:04:36] You have been given everything that you
[1:04:38] have need of, man. And you and I have
[1:04:41] now given a whole storehouse. We have
[1:04:43] got a full seven course meal. We've got
[1:04:46] the message of the hour.
[1:04:49] God, help us to grasp what that message
[1:04:51] really is. Amen. When we talk about it's
[1:04:54] food that's stored up.
[1:04:57] It's a seed that's sown. But the B says
[1:04:59] three seeds were sown. Billy Graham, all
[1:05:01] Robertson, he says, "And the word has
[1:05:03] been sown
[1:05:06] and the rain is going to come." Amen.
[1:05:08] Sooner or later, the rain is going to
[1:05:10] come. But the Bible says every seed has
[1:05:11] its season.
[1:05:13] So I don't know matter how much you want
[1:05:15] the rapture to come and and happen, it's
[1:05:17] not going to happen till it's the right
[1:05:19] time.
[1:05:22] Amen.
[1:05:25] All right.
[1:05:28] Well, y'all, a wonderful crowd. Amen.
[1:05:32] I'm proud of this church. Amen. The way
[1:05:35] that you pull, the way you love the
[1:05:38] Lord.
[1:05:40] Amen.
[1:05:44] Thus saith the spirit, you're not babies
[1:05:47] anymore,
[1:05:48] but Joe, you're not babies anymore.
[1:05:50] We're not babies anymore.
[1:05:52] We're grown. Amen.
[1:05:54] Amen. Praise be to God. I don't say that
[1:05:56] there's different people maybe in
[1:05:58] different brackets, but for at this
[1:05:59] church as a whole, man, we've got people
[1:06:01] here that are grown. Amen. and that are
[1:06:04] not babies anymore. I'm thankful for
[1:06:06] that. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:09] Hallelujah. So, I thought that was good.
[1:06:11] Brother Abraham said he'd want to live
[1:06:12] right in this hour. Amen. So, I that's
[1:06:15] my vote this morning. Lord, if you'd ask
[1:06:17] me, when do you want to be? I'd say I
[1:06:19] don't want to be right here because this
[1:06:20] is when you want me to be here.
[1:06:23] Amen. How many believe God put you here
[1:06:25] at this time, he's going to put you
[1:06:27] something in you to overcome in this
[1:06:30] hour?
[1:06:33] How many glad to be overcomers?
[1:06:36] Amen. I'm not here to tell you that you
[1:06:38] ain't going to overcome. Amen. And
[1:06:40] you're going to have problems after
[1:06:41] problems. I'm here to tell you you're
[1:06:42] more than able to overcome.
[1:06:46] You can live a life of victory.
[1:06:49] You can have the thrill of victory in
[1:06:51] your life.
[1:06:53] If you don't, it's still too much of
[1:06:55] yourself in there. If you don't, it's
[1:06:58] still too much of yourself in there. If
[1:07:00] you don't instill too much of yourself
[1:07:02] in there, we need to understand that.
[1:07:05] Don't blame God.
[1:07:08] Got to blame oursel.
[1:07:09] It's your own fault.
[1:07:13] Amen. With the help of the Lord, I want
[1:07:15] to talk to you about not just this. This
[1:07:17] How many knows that the the food that we
[1:07:19] eat becomes weapons?
[1:07:22] It becomes a weapon against germs and
[1:07:24] disease. Isn't that right? The doctor
[1:07:26] will tell you now you can eat this and
[1:07:28] this and this. Don't eat this, that, and
[1:07:29] the other. Amen. You become
[1:07:31] malnutritioned. Ain't that right? Then
[1:07:33] disease sets in. But if you're a good
[1:07:36] healthy plant, like brother Bam says,
[1:07:37] you get plenty of water, you get plenty
[1:07:39] of vitamins, it'll keep the bugs off.
[1:07:42] Amen. Our food becomes a weapon against
[1:07:44] the devil.
[1:07:46] And how many believes that the food that
[1:07:48] we eat, it's richer than Luther's,
[1:07:50] richer than Wesley's, richer than
[1:07:52] Pentecost. Ain't never been rich food
[1:07:55] like this.
[1:07:56] [Applause]
[1:07:59] Let your soul delight itself in fatness.
[1:08:04] Amen.
[1:08:06] A smile to come over across your face.
[1:08:09] That's right.
[1:08:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:15] Amen.
[1:08:18] Brother Benham, once again, I want to
[1:08:20] repeat it. He says, "You're not feeding
[1:08:22] on a man.
[1:08:24] You're not feeding on a man. and man,
[1:08:26] his words will fail. But you're feeding
[1:08:28] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:08:31] God.
[1:08:32] How many believes that this is God?
[1:08:35] And when you feed on God, guess what?
[1:08:38] You're going to get the life of God.
[1:08:40] It's going to change you. It's going to
[1:08:42] make you like God.
[1:08:46] God speed today that sons and daughters
[1:08:48] of God will be sons and daughters of God
[1:08:51] and realize they are. Amen.
[1:08:55] Amen.
[1:08:57] Praise the Lord. You're not feeding on
[1:08:59] just anything. You're feeding on the
[1:09:01] body word. Jesus says, "Unless you eat
[1:09:03] my flesh and drink my blood, you have no
[1:09:05] life in you."
[1:09:08] Amen.
[1:09:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:13] Brother Bam says, "No wonder Elijah laid
[1:09:15] his body upon a dead baby that'd come to
[1:09:17] life." He says it was God in that man.
[1:09:20] He says he was anointed and every
[1:09:23] prophet of the Old Testament was
[1:09:24] anointed with the Holy Ghost. They were
[1:09:26] they were lesser lights. He was the
[1:09:29] fullness of God being Messiah. Amen.
[1:09:32] They was messiahs then smaller messiahs.
[1:09:36] Good morning Miss Messiah.
[1:09:42] Good morning Miss Messiah. How many
[1:09:44] believes you're a messiah?
[1:09:47] That's right.
[1:09:49] I'm looking at messiahs.
[1:09:54] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:58] That's right. Smaller messiahs. For they
[1:10:00] were anointed with the same spirit that
[1:10:03] he was anointed with. Only he had it in
[1:10:06] fullness.
[1:10:07] And every man today that's received the
[1:10:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost is anointed
[1:10:12] with that same spirit that Jesus of
[1:10:14] Nazareth was. They went about doing good
[1:10:17] and healing the sick. Oh my, that makes
[1:10:19] me feel good to know that he lives
[1:10:20] today. See, there's something about a
[1:10:23] man
[1:10:26] or a woman. He was made to be a god.
[1:10:34] Didn't he say, Adam, you were supposed
[1:10:37] to have dominion over all the earth?
[1:10:40] A dominion. He was supposed to be have
[1:10:42] dominion. He was supposed to be a ruler.
[1:10:45] God is the God of heaven. Adam was
[1:10:47] supposed to be the God of the earth,
[1:10:51] a ruler.
[1:10:54] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:58] All right. So, listen.
[1:11:00] That's right. He was his purpose here on
[1:11:03] earth was to be a God to have a dominion
[1:11:06] over everything in the earth. Oh my.
[1:11:10] Don't let that stagger you. He says, "I
[1:11:12] got more scriptures wrote down on that
[1:11:15] here." The other night I saw a telecast
[1:11:17] of a man. He says with psychic mental
[1:11:20] faith, he says, "Set a glass of water
[1:11:24] and stood back and kept concentrating on
[1:11:26] that glass of water till it bursted just
[1:11:29] by concentration."
[1:11:32] Amen. But Abraham said to a woman one
[1:11:35] time, "If you've got if you've got real
[1:11:36] faith, then make that certain thing go
[1:11:38] round and round. Stop it and then go
[1:11:39] around the other way and go sideways. If
[1:11:41] you really have faith, you can do it.
[1:11:45] I thought about bringing a little
[1:11:46] dingling up jingling up here. Right.
[1:11:50] And tell you, I can make that thing
[1:11:52] spin. I can take that thing and I can
[1:11:54] make it spin with my mind.
[1:11:57] That's right. With a little help with my
[1:11:58] finger, cuz my mind tells my finger to
[1:12:01] spin it.
[1:12:03] That's about the only way I know of.
[1:12:06] That's about how much faith I got in the
[1:12:08] power of my mind.
[1:12:13] But how many knows if you if I was
[1:12:14] inspired of God, I don't care what it
[1:12:16] was.
[1:12:17] That's a whole different story cuz
[1:12:18] that's what I'm relying on. I'm not
[1:12:21] trying relying on my own power like
[1:12:22] perhaps this man was.
[1:12:24] But we rely upon the power of God.
[1:12:27] Hallelujah. Amen. God is good. That's
[1:12:30] right. That's what we were. Amen. So
[1:12:32] listen. So he That's right. He broke it
[1:12:34] just by concentration. Watching that
[1:12:36] glass of water and that glass cracked
[1:12:38] and the water ran out just pure memo
[1:12:40] concentration. Why? That's his fibers.
[1:12:45] That's his makeup.
[1:12:49] Oh my. If he's got a power in him by
[1:12:52] mental thinking that can break glass of
[1:12:55] wa a glass of water and him being a
[1:12:57] sinner, it shows that there's something
[1:12:59] made in the man. He's fallen perverted
[1:13:02] condition. But if that man can only get
[1:13:04] back to God
[1:13:06] and let God into him, why that power
[1:13:09] turned loose in the kingdom of God? What
[1:13:11] could he do?
[1:13:13] Amen. Let a man with that faith in that
[1:13:15] conductor of the word of God. Let that
[1:13:17] come and he can raise the dead. He can
[1:13:20] cleanse lepers, cast out devils. Amen.
[1:13:23] Because he's fashioned like a god. How
[1:13:25] many believes he can say stun stand
[1:13:28] still
[1:13:29] moon say where you are
[1:13:31] and then obey him
[1:13:34] if he's connected to a conductor. Now
[1:13:35] brother Ram said this man he was just
[1:13:37] like it was like let me see he said he
[1:13:40] just splattered this guy he just was
[1:13:42] like a shotgun he didn't have a
[1:13:43] conductor he just splattered it every
[1:13:45] way.
[1:13:47] Amen. But if that man's spirit could
[1:13:49] ever get converted and put Christ in
[1:13:50] there where he's a conductor. Amen. So
[1:13:53] you see folks, how many believes that's
[1:13:55] what we're working on? Saying, "Lord,
[1:13:57] help us to be a conductor." Amen. To get
[1:13:59] it in our mind so that God can have the
[1:14:03] preeminence.
[1:14:04] Paul said, "For the weapons of our
[1:14:06] warfare are not carnal but mighty
[1:14:08] through God to the pulling down of
[1:14:09] strongholds."
[1:14:11] Yes,
[1:14:11] sir.
[1:14:13] Amen. In other words, those machine gun
[1:14:16] nests,
[1:14:17] that right, of Germany, concreted,
[1:14:20] forfeited uh concrete reinforced places
[1:14:24] where they just can't get in and they
[1:14:25] got to fight their way up there and
[1:14:27] throw a grenade in or whatever it takes,
[1:14:30] place of fortification,
[1:14:33] pulling down of strongholds.
[1:14:36] You see, he said casting down
[1:14:39] imagination.
[1:14:43] Reasoning.
[1:14:46] That's what God wants us to do. Cast
[1:14:48] down imagin, cast down reasoning.
[1:14:52] How much better the devil would have
[1:14:54] been before he become the devil when he
[1:14:56] was in heaven, an angel, if he' throwed
[1:14:58] those thoughts out. Well, I want to be
[1:15:00] like the most high. I want a little
[1:15:02] pride, too. I'm somebody. How much
[1:15:04] better off he'd have be today if he'd
[1:15:07] just shove their thoughts out.
[1:15:09] How much better off we'd have been this
[1:15:11] morning if Eve would have just not
[1:15:13] listened to that one word.
[1:15:16] Thou shalt surely die. Thou shalt not
[1:15:18] surely die. Just the not. If she'd have
[1:15:21] just had, Amen. had protected herself
[1:15:23] against that.
[1:15:26] What a different world we'd be living
[1:15:28] in.
[1:15:30] Adam would have went on and spoke the
[1:15:32] seed into her and we'd have been come
[1:15:34] the way that God meant for us to come
[1:15:37] by the spoken word seed. How many knows
[1:15:39] that's how we were supposed to come
[1:15:41] by him speaking it and so forth. But now
[1:15:43] we come through sexual desire, born the
[1:15:45] wrong way and we got to do it again.
[1:15:48] Unfortunately, we have to be born again.
[1:15:52] Amen. Why? Because we didn't get born
[1:15:54] the right first time. That's why we got
[1:15:56] to do it again. Hallelujah.
[1:16:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:03] Born by what? Born by the word of God.
[1:16:07] That's right. Casting down imaginations
[1:16:10] and every high thing that exaltth itself
[1:16:13] against the knowledge of God. How many
[1:16:16] knows that he said he would exalt his
[1:16:18] throne above the stars of God. I will be
[1:16:21] like the most high. Abraham said when
[1:16:24] man went for the reasonings of man, he
[1:16:27] said they exalted the devil to where he
[1:16:30] wanted to be. In other words, the stars
[1:16:33] of God are the messengers of God.
[1:16:36] Amen.
[1:16:37] And whatever they say, they want to
[1:16:39] come. He the devil wants to come against
[1:16:41] that
[1:16:42] because if he can get you to believe
[1:16:44] something different than what his stars
[1:16:46] brings, well, he just exalted himself.
[1:16:50] Amen. And we're cast to cast everything
[1:16:52] down that exaltth itself against the
[1:16:55] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:16:58] captivity
[1:17:00] every thought to the obedience of
[1:17:02] Christ. I believe right there a lot of
[1:17:04] us ought to have some times of jubilee.
[1:17:09] Maybe the devil tempts you with a
[1:17:11] thought or this that or the other and
[1:17:13] you shrug it off. You say, "Woo, thank
[1:17:15] you Lord Jesus. I just captiv I just
[1:17:19] captivated that thing and cast it out.
[1:17:22] And I've got victory because I didn't
[1:17:23] let it come into my mind.
[1:17:26] I'll tell you what, a brother did me
[1:17:28] wrong, a sister did me wrong, and I just
[1:17:29] wanted to get mad. I just wanted to be
[1:17:31] angry, but guess I cast it out and I
[1:17:33] didn't let that fester in my life for
[1:17:36] weeks on end.
[1:17:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:40] You ought to be happy. And that's what
[1:17:41] God is, Paul was telling us.
[1:17:45] Bringing every thought
[1:17:47] captive to the word of God.
[1:17:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:57] But Abraham says, "Man,
[1:17:59] he's made up to have great faith."
[1:18:05] Brothers, sisters, God made you and he
[1:18:08] wants you to have great faith.
[1:18:13] How many is open? How many comes with an
[1:18:15] open mind this morning?
[1:18:16] My mind is open, Lord.
[1:18:18] I want to have great faith because
[1:18:20] that's what you made me for.
[1:18:24] Mustard seed faith.
[1:18:27] Amen. Not just mental faith, but mustard
[1:18:30] seed faith.
[1:18:33] Mustard seed does not mix with anything.
[1:18:38] You can't mix your conscience, your
[1:18:40] path. Amen. When the devil brings up
[1:18:42] your past and oh, I don't know if I
[1:18:45] don't. No, it don't mix. God said so.
[1:18:48] That settles it.
[1:18:49] I believe it. That's the way it is.
[1:18:51] Don't mix with nothing. It don't mix
[1:18:53] with doubt.
[1:18:55] It don't mix with your symptoms. It
[1:18:57] don't mix with how you feel.
[1:19:00] No, it don't mix with anything. It says
[1:19:02] God's word is true.
[1:19:05] Amen.
[1:19:06] It believes it and brings it to pass.
[1:19:09] Let me talk about the power of the mind
[1:19:11] for a minute.
[1:19:13] A chaplain told me some time ago in the
[1:19:15] army that he was called into a tent one
[1:19:17] night. A great officer had been machine
[1:19:19] gunned across his chest one place he
[1:19:21] said and bullets cut through him. He was
[1:19:24] dying, bleeding out and someone had told
[1:19:26] him to go over there and he said to the
[1:19:28] man, "Sir, are you a Christian?" He
[1:19:30] said, "I once was." He says, "How long
[1:19:33] how long have you been backsliden?"
[1:19:35] Said, "Well, I don't know." He said,
[1:19:37] "You once knew Christ." "Yes, sir."
[1:19:40] Said, "Where did you leave?" And he was
[1:19:42] struggling in the blood filling up in
[1:19:44] his lungs. And he says, "You better
[1:19:46] think fast."
[1:19:49] Can you imagine?
[1:19:50] The preacher come when you're dying. He
[1:19:52] says, "Where did you leave him?" And
[1:19:54] tell you to think quick.
[1:19:57] Use that mind of yours and begin to
[1:19:59] think quick.
[1:20:02] Where did you leave him?
[1:20:10] Let me think.
[1:20:12] Let me think.
[1:20:14] Nothing can be done for you. You better
[1:20:16] hurry. You better think quick.
[1:20:20] He was struggling. Blood filling up his
[1:20:21] lungs. He says, "You better think fast."
[1:20:24] And he said, "What can I do?"
[1:20:27] Uh he said, "What can I do?" And he
[1:20:29] said, "Go back to where you left him and
[1:20:32] begin right there."
[1:20:34] Amen. That's where you'll find him. It's
[1:20:36] where you left him.
[1:20:38] Oh, church. Anybody backslid this
[1:20:40] morning, go back and look at where you
[1:20:42] left him. Amen. You better begin to
[1:20:44] think. Think about where you left him,
[1:20:46] cuz that's where you'll find.
[1:20:53] I'm here to tell you, there's people
[1:20:54] that won't do that. They just want to
[1:20:56] leave the past behind. They think,
[1:20:58] "Well, just forget all of that, you
[1:21:00] know." No. God says, "Go back where you
[1:21:01] left him because I ain't just going to
[1:21:03] smooth things over. You're going to have
[1:21:04] to make it right. You're going to have
[1:21:06] to get right. And you needed to start
[1:21:07] where you left off.
[1:21:14] Amen.
[1:21:17] That's right.
[1:21:18] Go back. Think about where you left him
[1:21:21] and he laid there a few moments as he
[1:21:22] was struggling
[1:21:24] and a smile come across his face and he
[1:21:27] says, "Now I remember."
[1:21:31] He said, "Start right there, sir." The
[1:21:34] chaplain did. Start right there. He
[1:21:37] says, "Now I lay me down to sleep. I
[1:21:41] pray thee, Lord, my soul to keep. If I
[1:21:45] should die before I wake, I pray the
[1:21:47] Lord my soul to take." And when he said
[1:21:51] that, he lifted his hands and smiled and
[1:21:54] went to meet God.
[1:21:57] Amen. Ain't that awesome?
[1:21:59] Why?
[1:22:01] That's where he left him. He quit his
[1:22:03] nightly prayer of going to bed. Quit
[1:22:05] praying.
[1:22:07] That's where he left him.
[1:22:09] And he began to repeat that prayer.
[1:22:12] Now I lay me down to sleep. How many
[1:22:15] believes Jesus Christ came and he did
[1:22:18] the work
[1:22:19] just like that
[1:22:20] cuz he had a smile on his face. He was
[1:22:23] happy
[1:22:24] and went to meet the Lord.
[1:22:26] Amen. How many is glad for the grace of
[1:22:29] God,
[1:22:30] for the mercy of God?
[1:22:35] Amen. And this thought I remembered
[1:22:38] brother Bram saying something like that
[1:22:39] in Ephesians the Ephesus church.
[1:22:42] Remember it says remember
[1:22:45] where thou has fallen from. Ain't that
[1:22:46] right? He said evidently something had
[1:22:48] left their minds. They had forgotten
[1:22:51] something. He told them to turn back in
[1:22:53] their minds to their point of origin.
[1:22:56] The origin of the first age was
[1:22:58] Pentecost and they had fallen from it.
[1:23:01] They had forgotten the glory and the
[1:23:03] wonder of it and it was time to go back
[1:23:06] in mind
[1:23:09] and then in reality
[1:23:12] I've got another quote here somewhere
[1:23:14] where brother Bram mentions that. Amen.
[1:23:16] Where people that have lost have gotten
[1:23:20] away from their first love.
[1:23:25] How many believes we need to have that
[1:23:26] first love?
[1:23:28] Don't lose that first love.
[1:23:33] Amen.
[1:23:35] Praise the Lord. Here it is right here
[1:23:37] in front of me.
[1:23:40] Remember the message called why? Why do
[1:23:42] you go to the God of Akaron and all
[1:23:44] that? Then he says, in other words,
[1:23:47] he says, ain't there enough joy in the
[1:23:50] church? Why do you stay home on
[1:23:52] Wednesday night to watch television? Is
[1:23:55] there no joy in the church anymore?
[1:23:58] Nothing in your heart that longs to hear
[1:24:01] the word of God
[1:24:03] more than it likes to see we love Lucy
[1:24:07] or ever what them things are that you
[1:24:08] stay home for. What's the matter? Amen.
[1:24:11] How many of us maybe this morning need
[1:24:13] to say, "God, I have lost that real
[1:24:16] enthusiasm.
[1:24:18] I've lost that intimate walk that I had
[1:24:20] with you at the beginning. How many
[1:24:23] believe God is here this morning to give
[1:24:25] you that if you don't have it?
[1:24:29] That's right. He's here.
[1:24:31] Oh, this morning's message for Amen. and
[1:24:33] especially that message on why. Amen.
[1:24:35] When God had provided everything that we
[1:24:38] have need of and people didn't receive
[1:24:40] it, how many believes it's made and it's
[1:24:42] ready. God is real. He's the same
[1:24:45] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:24:50] And
[1:24:51] and he's here.
[1:24:54] How many believes he's here? You got to
[1:24:57] believe that he is here and that he has
[1:25:00] supplied everything that you have made
[1:25:02] of.
[1:25:03] He has given us the food that we need to
[1:25:05] give us strength to fly above all these
[1:25:08] things,
[1:25:09] to fly above lukewarmness,
[1:25:12] mediocracy, and just hum drum along.
[1:25:16] No. Uh-uh.
[1:25:18] It's not the way we want to be.
[1:25:22] Amen.
[1:25:24] Praise the Lord. Now, as I said a while
[1:25:27] ago, I had a good example that I wanted
[1:25:28] to give you of something.
[1:25:36] All right. Where's the top? Here it is.
[1:25:42] I'm just going to read this quote. Is
[1:25:44] that okay? I'm I'm I'm hopping and
[1:25:46] skipping already.
[1:25:49] If that love of God isn't above
[1:25:51] everything else, that your heart when
[1:25:53] them church bell rings, your heart just
[1:25:55] burns. Amen.
[1:25:58] Amen. And he says, "Now, we've poured
[1:26:00] out the medicine this week as hard as I
[1:26:02] know how to pour it out and just as
[1:26:04] straight as I know how to bring it."
[1:26:07] Amen. And if you don't receive it, then
[1:26:08] God's going to say, "Why?"
[1:26:11] Someday the Bible's going to be closed
[1:26:15] on the pulpit.
[1:26:20] Someday the Bible is going to be closed.
[1:26:24] On the pulpit.
[1:26:30] Amen.
[1:26:31] The preacher's gonna
[1:26:34] pray
[1:26:35] his last prayer.
[1:26:40] The taps will die out from the bugle.
[1:26:43] The sun will set its last time over the
[1:26:46] hill. Then God's going to ask you to
[1:26:48] give a reason.
[1:26:50] When the ones that rejected the message
[1:26:52] is going to be asked to give a reason.
[1:26:56] Amen.
[1:26:59] How many believes God's going to take
[1:27:00] those tapes, God's going to take those
[1:27:03] books, and he's going to ask this
[1:27:04] generation, "Why didn't you believe
[1:27:06] this?"
[1:27:09] I gave you the greatest greatest proof
[1:27:12] that there was. There was no greater
[1:27:14] proof.
[1:27:15] We call it vindication,
[1:27:17] but it's proof.
[1:27:19] I mean, you could see it with your own
[1:27:21] eye.
[1:27:21] You could see the people walk that were
[1:27:23] lame, the blind, and everything else.
[1:27:25] Amen.
[1:27:26] And he's going to ask this generation,
[1:27:28] why?
[1:27:29] Why didn't you receive it? Why did you
[1:27:32] sit in the pews
[1:27:34] and not receive it?
[1:27:36] Listen. Listen to what he says. Like I
[1:27:38] said, brother Brandham says it best.
[1:27:41] Listen. And God's going to ask you to
[1:27:43] give a reason. One of the ones that
[1:27:45] rejects the message is going to be asked
[1:27:46] a reason why. What then? What then?
[1:27:51] I hope this resounds all down through
[1:27:54] everybody listening. There's going to
[1:27:56] come a time when God is going to ask for
[1:27:59] you to give a reason why. Then what are
[1:28:02] you going to do? You're going to come to
[1:28:04] this moment to where you're going to
[1:28:06] say, "Well,
[1:28:09] man, I sure wish I would have." What
[1:28:12] then? What are you going to do then?
[1:28:14] When you're asked the reason,
[1:28:16] Amen. How many? Amen. When that great
[1:28:19] book is open, what then? When the ones
[1:28:21] that rejected this message tonight is
[1:28:23] going to be asked to give a reason. What
[1:28:25] then? You've attended this revival.
[1:28:30] God has done everything that's in the
[1:28:32] book for you. Proven it.
[1:28:35] Amen.
[1:28:37] As long Oh, people's received the Holy
[1:28:39] Ghost. They've been filled with God's
[1:28:41] spirit, young and old. They've repented
[1:28:43] of their sins. They got joy in their
[1:28:45] heart.
[1:28:47] Amen. We've seen divine healing take
[1:28:50] place. People with heart trouble,
[1:28:52] different diseases healed. We've seen
[1:28:54] the angel of the Lord come down, go
[1:28:56] through the building just as he did
[1:28:58] before the coming of the Lord would be
[1:29:01] discerning the spirits and things like
[1:29:03] that. That prophetic utterance went
[1:29:05] forth. People spoke in tongues,
[1:29:07] prophesied, and vindicated the word back
[1:29:10] and forth. You've seen it and said,
[1:29:13] "Which
[1:29:15] you choose tonight?" Which you choose
[1:29:16] tonight. What what are you going to
[1:29:18] choose tonight? Hollywood or holy
[1:29:21] heaven?
[1:29:22] Are we going to choose our own way or
[1:29:25] are we going to choose God's way?
[1:29:29] Amen.
[1:29:30] You're going to be asked to give a
[1:29:31] reason someday. What then? Amen.
[1:29:36] Now, let me go turn it just a little bit
[1:29:40] and I want to read you a story about
[1:29:42] what we got.
[1:29:45] the treasure that you and I have. One
[1:29:48] time there was an old woman here in the
[1:29:49] country and she was dying. She was
[1:29:51] starving to death, povertystricken.
[1:29:54] So somebody turned her into the
[1:29:55] authorities, the charity, and they went
[1:29:58] to this woman and they said to her, "We
[1:30:01] coming to investigate your case. We want
[1:30:03] to know what's wrong." Said, "Haven't
[1:30:04] you got no relation?" She says, "Oh,
[1:30:07] I've got a lovely son." They said,
[1:30:09] "Where?" He's a businessman. Where's he
[1:30:11] at? In India. Why? She said, "Is he a
[1:30:14] businessman?" Yes. So said, "Why didn't
[1:30:18] he send you something? Why don't he send
[1:30:20] you something?" Said, "How long has it
[1:30:22] been has he been over there?" "Oh, about
[1:30:23] 10 years. He's a very prosperous
[1:30:26] businessman." Said, "Well, why don't he
[1:30:29] help you?" Said, "I just can't ask him.
[1:30:32] I just can't do it." Said, "He's such a
[1:30:34] sweet boy." And said, "I just can't ask
[1:30:37] him for it." He says and said, 'I write
[1:30:40] him letters and he writes me the
[1:30:42] sweetest letters that any boy could
[1:30:44] write his mother and tells me how much
[1:30:46] he loves me
[1:30:49] but said I just couldn't ask him for it
[1:30:51] and said well you ought to tell him and
[1:30:54] said I just can't do it and tell my own
[1:30:56] son that I'm povertystricken of things
[1:30:57] and said I just can't do it but he sends
[1:31:01] me these
[1:31:03] he sent me the prettiest pictures
[1:31:07] that I've ever seen
[1:31:16] [Applause]
[1:31:26] God sends us the prettiest pictures.
[1:31:32] He was with me before the foundation of
[1:31:34] the world.
[1:31:36] He was always a part of me. Thank you,
[1:31:38] Lord.
[1:31:39] Amen. I've got you in the palm of my
[1:31:41] hand. What the beautiful pictures.
[1:31:43] I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake
[1:31:45] you.
[1:31:46] When I think about the beautiful
[1:31:48] pictures when I see him hanging on that
[1:31:51] beautiful picture of him hanging on
[1:31:53] Calvary,
[1:31:55] all my debt.
[1:31:58] Oh, I was so deep in debt. I was up to
[1:32:00] my neck, over above my nose in debt.
[1:32:04] You was too.
[1:32:06] And he paid it all. What a beautiful
[1:32:08] picture.
[1:32:10] What a beautiful picture.
[1:32:15] Jesus paid it all.
[1:32:18] Amen. And he give you his word.
[1:32:21] So rich, I'll never leave you. Neither
[1:32:24] will I forsake you.
[1:32:26] Everything that's mine is yours. We're
[1:32:28] joint hes.
[1:32:30] How many believe you're rich?
[1:32:32] Amen. God has made you rich. I was poor
[1:32:34] and he's made you rich. Amen.
[1:32:37] Amen. He sends me the prettiest pictures
[1:32:41] that I've ever seen in my life. Said,
[1:32:42] "Oh, well, what kind of pictures? Let me
[1:32:46] see these pictures." Where you got them
[1:32:48] at? Where have you got them?
[1:32:54] Amen.
[1:32:58] Oh, pretty little pictures about that
[1:33:00] big square.
[1:33:06] Amen. Said, "May I see one?" Said,
[1:33:10] "Where have you got them?" She said,
[1:33:11] "Oh, I keep them in my Bible." So,
[1:33:13] across the floor went the old mom. She
[1:33:15] picked up the Bible and began to lay
[1:33:17] them out. Lay them out. And the
[1:33:19] investigator looked at them.
[1:33:22] She was a rich woman.
[1:33:24] She was a rich woman. I believe we got a
[1:33:27] rich woman here.
[1:33:28] Amen. God's wife is rich.
[1:33:32] If we could just grasp that it's not
[1:33:34] just a pretty picture. It's not just
[1:33:35] words. Amen. It's life to us.
[1:33:38] Amen. It's yours.
[1:33:42] When you're sick, he'll heal you. If you
[1:33:45] have a need, he knows the fault of us.
[1:33:47] No. He provides us. He provides you your
[1:33:50] job. He gives you your home. He gives
[1:33:53] you your money. He gives you your
[1:33:55] health. He gives your breath. He gives
[1:33:57] you everything.
[1:34:05] Church, you're rich. You're rich in God.
[1:34:10] He's given you his best. How many
[1:34:12] believe if God could have done something
[1:34:14] greater? Amen. That send us Malachi 4
[1:34:16] and prove himself. Come and vindicate
[1:34:19] himself. There's something greater he
[1:34:21] could have done. He would
[1:34:23] cuz he wants to catch your attention.
[1:34:26] He wants you to know that
[1:34:33] that whatever you have need of that it's
[1:34:36] already done.
[1:34:38] It's already done.
[1:34:40] Not have to try to muster it up. He did
[1:34:43] it. He paid for it. It's already there.
[1:34:45] All you have to do is get it. Just go
[1:34:48] grab that one and go to the bank and buy
[1:34:50] your food. Whatever you have need of.
[1:34:52] Whatever you have need of. If you'll
[1:34:54] have faith this morning, if you'll have
[1:34:56] faith right now, I don't care what it
[1:34:58] is, in the next five minutes, you won't
[1:35:00] be desiring it. You'll have what you
[1:35:02] want. If you'll just have faith, he's on
[1:35:04] the throne. He's still on the mercy
[1:35:06] seat. He hasn't left. He's still there.
[1:35:10] Cash that check in. Write your name on
[1:35:13] it. Cash it in right now.
[1:35:17] You want more of the Holy Ghost? Get
[1:35:18] more of the Holy Ghost. You want victory
[1:35:21] in your life? Get it right now.
[1:35:25] right now. You want more joy? Get more
[1:35:28] joy. We don't have to go to the God of
[1:35:30] Beg to get joy.
[1:35:34] Oh, that's what I wanted to sing. Oh,
[1:35:36] there's joy in the house of the Lord.
[1:35:38] There's peace in the house of the Lord.
[1:35:40] There's salvation in the house of God.
[1:35:44] There's deliverance in the house of God.
[1:35:51] Oh, there'll be preaching in the house
[1:35:53] of the Lord.
[1:35:54] There'll be singing in the house of the
[1:35:56] Lord.
[1:35:58] Is there no joy?
[1:36:01] Is there no jumping that you got to go
[1:36:02] to the ball games? Ain't there any
[1:36:04] screaming in the house of God? You got
[1:36:06] to go scream about a ball.
[1:36:10] Amen. Jumping up and down. We ain't got
[1:36:12] to go out there. Our pleasure not out
[1:36:14] there. This is where we come to have our
[1:36:17] fun, to have our pleasure, right here.
[1:36:22] This is it. This is where we have our
[1:36:25] joy.
[1:36:26] This is where we get our medicine. This
[1:36:29] is where we get our drugs. Woo!
[1:36:34] This is where we get our opium from the
[1:36:36] lily that was crushed. The lily of the
[1:36:39] valley,
[1:36:41] the bright and morning star.
[1:36:48] Amen.
[1:36:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:52] Oh, there's joy in the house of the
[1:36:54] Lord.
[1:36:56] There's a heavenly atmosphere
[1:36:58] in the house of the Lord.
[1:36:59] There's an anointing here
[1:37:01] in the house of the Lord.
[1:37:05] Amen.
[1:37:12] Elijah laid his body on that dead boy in
[1:37:15] that right way because he was anointed
[1:37:17] and raised him back up again. Let me
[1:37:20] tell you something. If there's a sinner
[1:37:21] in here, the anointing ought to be so
[1:37:23] heavy that it would cause somebody to be
[1:37:25] quickened. Amen. And to die to
[1:37:27] themselves.
[1:37:29] Amen. And get raised up in newness of
[1:37:31] life.
[1:37:39] Amen.
[1:37:41] God is good.
[1:37:43] God is good.
[1:37:45] I
[1:37:47] don't like to talk too much about
[1:37:48] myself, but I about my this testimony
[1:37:51] comes to my mind. I'm going to give a
[1:37:53] little testimony. Is that all right?
[1:37:55] Here. About a month ago, brother Brad
[1:37:58] knew, my wife knew.
[1:38:02] I felt like I really needed to go to
[1:38:04] doctor because I had some pains in my
[1:38:07] gut that was just not normal, not right.
[1:38:12] And it had me worried.
[1:38:15] I say worried, but concerned.
[1:38:19] It wouldn't go away. Wouldn't go away.
[1:38:22] Amen.
[1:38:24] Now, I'll be honest with you. I was
[1:38:26] trying to get a a life insurance policy
[1:38:30] through before I do because you can't
[1:38:32] get them afterwards.
[1:38:36] So, I was trying to get and I'm still
[1:38:37] waiting.
[1:38:40] Still waiting. Still got to go in the
[1:38:41] hospital having no kind of testing,
[1:38:43] nothing run. But, uh, anyway, I was
[1:38:46] like, man, I'm just And then yes, I
[1:38:48] think Friday, last Friday, I called I I
[1:38:51] I or did I even call? I was fixing to
[1:38:54] call. Make me in a doctor's appointment.
[1:38:56] Amen. Just go ahead and go do it. But I
[1:39:00] know brother Brad prayed for me. My wife
[1:39:02] prayed for me and I believed.
[1:39:05] But since last Sunday, since last
[1:39:07] Sunday, I have not hardly had a pain at
[1:39:10] all. So just Amen. Feeling good. Praise
[1:39:16] the Lord.
[1:39:18] Amen. So I thank God. He's a healer. I
[1:39:22] tell Don, I don't know what happened,
[1:39:24] but it must have been the Lord. Must
[1:39:27] have been him. You don't know how many
[1:39:28] times that he heals you. Hallelujah.
[1:39:31] That he heals you. And we don't
[1:39:33] recognize it. I believe he touched me,
[1:39:36] brother. Hallelujah. God is good. Amen.
[1:39:40] I feel good.
[1:39:43] Hallelujah.
[1:39:45] Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:48] God is good.
[1:39:52] Thank God for my wife's healing.
[1:39:55] Amen.
[1:39:56] Thank God for my wife's healing.
[1:40:02] Thank God for Sister Sherry's healing.
[1:40:04] Thank God for Sister Janette's healing.
[1:40:07] Thank God for everybody's healing. You
[1:40:09] can all be healed right now. Right now.
[1:40:13] If you just say, "God, I don't feel
[1:40:15] good. I've got a knee ache." Whatever
[1:40:17] your pain is, say, "God, I'm claiming it
[1:40:19] right now. It's mine. You send me that
[1:40:23] letter. You send me that beautiful
[1:40:25] picture. By my stripes, you are healed."
[1:40:36] How many is glad for his beautiful
[1:40:38] pictures?
[1:40:39] He's worthy of praise. People,
[1:40:42] you want to get healed, just start to
[1:40:44] praise him.
[1:40:47] Oh my.
[1:40:50] I'm going to have to stop long enough to
[1:40:51] take a swig.
[1:41:12] I heard brother Megan Bannon make a
[1:41:14] statement.
[1:41:15] the sister before she felt anything,
[1:41:18] knew everything, she began to praise God
[1:41:20] for it anyway. He commended her for it.
[1:41:23] He says, "And I believe that's the way
[1:41:24] it ought to be before you feel it.
[1:41:27] Before anything happens, we believe him
[1:41:29] anyway.
[1:41:32] We're not waiting to feel better, feel
[1:41:34] right." No, we take him at his word
[1:41:36] anyway.
[1:41:42] Amen. Praise the Lord. But it's only 12.
[1:41:45] I got a few more minutes, don't it?
[1:41:49] That was at least four hours work right
[1:41:51] there. I got four left.
[1:41:58] All right, let's talk about our mind
[1:42:00] again for a minute. So important. It
[1:42:04] opens up, Brother Bam says, when you
[1:42:06] open up your mind and receive the word
[1:42:08] of God into your heart, it opens up all
[1:42:11] the flu, your conscience, memory,
[1:42:13] everything. It opens it up to God and he
[1:42:16] shuts everything off to the devil.
[1:42:18] Amen. And you become a real fellowship
[1:42:21] with God and become a son and daughter
[1:42:23] of God.
[1:42:27] So the question that I had was
[1:42:33] and somebody raise your hand and I'll
[1:42:36] pick one of you.
[1:42:38] What did brother Bham say will bring
[1:42:40] every promise of God to pass?
[1:42:45] Sit your hand.
[1:42:47] Right. The right mental
[1:42:51] attitude.
[1:42:54] Right. Wow.
[1:42:57] Every promise of God can be brought to
[1:43:00] pass if you've got He didn't say
[1:43:03] spiritual, he said mental. You've got
[1:43:06] the right mental attitude.
[1:43:09] How many that's what God is looking for
[1:43:11] in his people, the right attitude. God
[1:43:13] hates the wrong attitude.
[1:43:15] He hates an attitude of non-gratitude.
[1:43:19] [Applause]
[1:43:22] I don't care what condition Paul is. I
[1:43:24] have learned to give God glory in
[1:43:26] everything. In all things give thanks,
[1:43:28] and everything give thanks. Have an
[1:43:31] attitude of attitude.
[1:43:36] Brother Bam says we always get what we
[1:43:38] expect. When people expect anything,
[1:43:40] well then usually they get what they
[1:43:41] look for. It's the mental attitude that
[1:43:44] they have. Remember this and never
[1:43:46] forget the right mental attitude towards
[1:43:49] any promise of God will bring it to
[1:43:52] pass.
[1:43:54] Hallelujah. How many's glad for that?
[1:43:56] It's the mental attitude that you have.
[1:44:00] Woo.
[1:44:03] I'm not going to go down the left the
[1:44:06] road of the left too far, but it would
[1:44:08] have been such a different story for
[1:44:10] Achen if he had had the right attitude
[1:44:12] and wouldn't allowed that thought to
[1:44:13] come in. Amen. About getting that wedge
[1:44:16] of gold and so forth and stealing that
[1:44:18] thing. Isn't that right? He allowed the
[1:44:20] wrong thing to come into his mind. Jason
[1:44:22] and Cart, they wouldn't have been
[1:44:23] swallowed up by the earth if they' have
[1:44:25] blocked, if they'd have watched their
[1:44:27] mind.
[1:44:28] Don't let the wrong thought come in.
[1:44:30] Have the right attitude.
[1:44:34] Amen.
[1:44:40] I've got several here
[1:44:42] in the
[1:44:44] who had the right attitude.
[1:44:47] The three Hebrew children,
[1:44:49] Shadrach, Mach, and Abnego.
[1:44:53] Amen.
[1:44:57] Those names are forever edged.
[1:45:02] in eternity. Is that right?
[1:45:06] Because those guys, they said, "We don't
[1:45:08] know if God will." Is that right?
[1:45:11] We don't know if God will. We're believe
[1:45:13] he will.
[1:45:15] But there's one thing we know.
[1:45:17] And that is that we're not going to bow.
[1:45:20] Even if he does, we're not going to bow.
[1:45:22] God loves their attitude.
[1:45:25] We don't know what God's going to do.
[1:45:26] We've trust him. We know that he can.
[1:45:29] And we're not going to bow to the devil.
[1:45:30] Anyhow, we're not going to have doubt.
[1:45:33] God is more than able. That's the right
[1:45:35] attitude.
[1:45:38] Joshua and Caleb, remember? Amen. When
[1:45:40] those spies came back, the 10 said,
[1:45:42] "Man, we're likeers. We'll never be able
[1:45:44] to." Oh, they were, "Oh, man. I'm
[1:45:47] telling you, why did you bring us here?
[1:45:49] We're just going to die. They're going
[1:45:51] to kill us. The sons of Anoch are
[1:45:52] there." They were, boy, they're way
[1:45:54] down. They brought a negative report.
[1:46:00] But Joshua and Caleb, they had the right
[1:46:02] attitude. This is what are you talking
[1:46:04] about? Are you completely stark
[1:46:06] breathing, man? God has delivered you
[1:46:09] out of the Red Sea, brought you out of
[1:46:11] Egypt. He's done all these things. He
[1:46:13] fed you. He watered you. He's more than
[1:46:15] able. We are more than able.
[1:46:20] That's what God wants to see out of us.
[1:46:22] You're more than able. Oh, you'll never
[1:46:24] make the You'll never make the rapture.
[1:46:26] You'll never be goodness. Get behind me
[1:46:28] today, devil. We're more than able to
[1:46:30] make it,
[1:46:34] devil. I'm more than able to make it.
[1:46:52] I'm at least going to open it up. Is
[1:46:53] that all right?
[1:46:57] more than able to do it.
[1:47:06] The attitude that God's looking for.
[1:47:08] Woman came up to him. Hound at Jesus.
[1:47:12] Heal my daughter. Heal my daughter. Heal
[1:47:14] my daughter. He ignored her. Ignored
[1:47:16] her. Is that right? Kept going on. Get
[1:47:19] rid of this woman. She kept haing him.
[1:47:22] Kept haunting him.
[1:47:24] That's right.
[1:47:26] And he says, "It's not meat to give the
[1:47:28] children's bread to dogs."
[1:47:35] But this is a great lesson. This is a
[1:47:38] great lesson. For the prophet of God
[1:47:40] said that not even God could stop her.
[1:47:45] Not even Jesus could discourage her by
[1:47:48] calling her a dog.
[1:47:50] He said, "How many Pentecostals would
[1:47:51] have busted the doors open getting out
[1:47:53] of there?
[1:47:55] Huh?
[1:47:56] Call me a dog, will you?
[1:48:00] Acknowledged that what he said was the
[1:48:02] truth.
[1:48:10] She acknowledged that what he said was
[1:48:11] the truth. Yay, Lord. But even the dogs
[1:48:15] eat the crumbs from the master's table.
[1:48:18] And God says, "Great is your faith. be
[1:48:21] it unto you according to your attitude,
[1:48:24] according to your faith.
[1:48:26] How many believes that's us this
[1:48:28] morning? According to your faith,
[1:48:30] whatever it is, you're only going to
[1:48:32] have what you get because of your faith.
[1:48:37] So God, help us
[1:48:40] to have faith. Whether we see it,
[1:48:42] whether we feel it,
[1:48:44] whether we think it, doesn't matter. We
[1:48:46] believe his word is true.
[1:48:48] Amen. had it right. Had the right
[1:48:51] attitude when he got finished talking
[1:48:53] about squirrels
[1:48:56] coming into existence and everything
[1:48:58] else. Ain't that right? It might have
[1:49:00] sound crazy when you tell people about
[1:49:02] the possum. To some people that sounds a
[1:49:04] little crazy. You tell them about the
[1:49:06] polar bull in the field. You tell them
[1:49:08] about the hornets. I don't care. That
[1:49:09] don't sound crazy to me.
[1:49:13] She said that's nothing but the brother
[1:49:15] Vanom. Amen. And God loved that. He
[1:49:18] loved it so much. She said, "You tell
[1:49:20] her that whatever she wants, she can
[1:49:22] have."
[1:49:24] You talk about a open checkbook from
[1:49:26] thus sayeth the Lord, if he don't get
[1:49:28] it, I'm a false prophet.
[1:49:31] Woo. Can you imagine open check whatever
[1:49:34] she desired? Because she had the right
[1:49:36] attitude. I want you to know this
[1:49:38] morning, how many this morning would
[1:49:39] say, say with me, amen, this message,
[1:49:43] this message that God has sent us is
[1:49:45] nothing but the truth.
[1:49:48] Every bit of it is nothing but truth.
[1:49:52] Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:58] She had the right attitude. She had the
[1:50:00] right word. She said the right thing.
[1:50:04] We can sure say the wrong thing
[1:50:05] sometimes, but she said the right thing.
[1:50:09] And she got the right reward
[1:50:12] because of it. Praise the Lord.
[1:50:20] The centurion,
[1:50:22] Roman centurion, he had the right
[1:50:24] attitude.
[1:50:25] Come and pray for my servant.
[1:50:29] No, he didn't say come and pray for my
[1:50:30] servant. He says my servant is sick. I
[1:50:32] believe it was. You know,
[1:50:36] and isn't it funny if I I think if you
[1:50:38] go back and read that Jesus offered to
[1:50:41] come, I'll come and pray for him.
[1:50:48] Jesus is so smart.
[1:50:51] I mean, at least Jesus is so smart.
[1:50:56] Did the the Pharisees, remember, they
[1:50:58] ask him about keeping the law. They ask
[1:51:00] about a a woman if she's married and her
[1:51:02] husband dies, how many, you know, and
[1:51:04] then whose wife is she going to be in
[1:51:05] heaven? And they ask him a bunch of
[1:51:07] questions. So much so until the last
[1:51:10] questions that they ask him afterwards,
[1:51:12] it says that they dare not ask him any
[1:51:14] more questions. Woo! Why? Because he's
[1:51:17] the fountain of all knowledge. He made
[1:51:19] the alphabet.
[1:51:21] He made the ABCs. He made everything.
[1:51:24] And you want to come up against that?
[1:51:30] Praise the Lord. You ain't so dumb
[1:51:32] yourself, folks. I mean, we ain't so
[1:51:34] dumb ourselves. She says, "When you get
[1:51:36] up and you get drawn up before the
[1:51:38] magistrates and so forth, don't even
[1:51:39] bother getting in your mind about what
[1:51:41] you're going to say because it's going
[1:51:43] to be given to you at the minute that
[1:51:45] you need it. I'm a witness of that." God
[1:51:48] has done that through me many times. I
[1:51:50] didn't know what to say, but he said the
[1:51:52] right thing.
[1:51:54] Why? Cuz he'll think your thoughts.
[1:51:57] He'll tell you how to think.
[1:51:58] He'll tell you what to say.
[1:52:02] Don't you love that?
[1:52:06] Amen. God will do that. Just rely on
[1:52:12] him.
[1:52:14] Just rely on him.
[1:52:18] Amen.
[1:52:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:33] And the centurion
[1:52:36] Jesus liked it so well. His attitude,
[1:52:41] he had an attitude of humility.
[1:52:44] Lord, you are such a great person that
[1:52:47] I'm not worried that I have you come
[1:52:48] under my roof.
[1:52:52] I have great respect for you. He says,
[1:52:55] "And I'm a centurion. I guess that's
[1:52:58] over what, a hundred soldiers or
[1:52:59] something like that. I'm not too sure
[1:53:01] what it is, but he's has a lot of
[1:53:03] soldiers on him. I say to this one, go.
[1:53:07] And he goes, I say to this one, come.
[1:53:09] And he comes. And I know you're a man of
[1:53:11] authority. If you'll just say the word.
[1:53:15] If you'll just say the word. I know
[1:53:18] it'll be.
[1:53:20] Man, I haven't found this kind of faith
[1:53:22] anywhere. How many believe that's why
[1:53:24] it's so important when the word goes
[1:53:26] forth, let the Holy Spirit speak to you
[1:53:29] and it'll be done right there. It's his
[1:53:32] word.
[1:53:34] If you feel like God is speaking to you,
[1:53:36] say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[1:53:38] That's me. That's me, Lord. I receive
[1:53:41] it."
[1:53:46] Amen.
[1:53:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:53] That's right.
[1:53:54] God is good.
[1:53:58] One more. One more. We'll close.
[1:54:03] The woman came to the unjust judge.
[1:54:06] Ain't that right?
[1:54:09] Unjust judge. And she kept knocking.
[1:54:14] Do me justice, judge. Ain't that right?
[1:54:16] Do me justice. Do me justice. He got
[1:54:19] wearied of it. He says, "I'm going to do
[1:54:21] it just because she's that persistent.
[1:54:24] She don't quit. She won't give up."
[1:54:29] So, whatever you're wanting, that's what
[1:54:30] I'll do. That's why I love that song. I
[1:54:33] even had wrote down to sing at the end
[1:54:35] of the congregation at the end of Amen.
[1:54:37] When pains of death seize over my soul,
[1:54:40] unto the Lord I cry. Till Jesus came and
[1:54:43] he made me whole. I would not be denied.
[1:54:47] God loves the attitude. I won't quit. I
[1:54:49] won't give up until I get it.
[1:54:52] That's the kind of attitude God wants us
[1:54:54] to have. I ain't quitting. I will not be
[1:54:56] denied.
[1:55:00] Hallelujah. I want more of God and I'll
[1:55:03] have more of God. I want more prayer
[1:55:05] time. I'll have more prayer time. I want
[1:55:07] more power in my life. I want more joy
[1:55:09] in my life.
[1:55:12] Whatever it is, he likes that attitude.
[1:55:15] That's why he told those stories.
[1:55:19] so that you'll know what kind of mental
[1:55:20] attitude that you're to have
[1:55:24] before anything ever happens.
[1:55:26] You don't worry about whether it happens
[1:55:28] or not.
[1:55:29] You just worry about you believe God
[1:55:31] with all of your heart without one doubt
[1:55:34] and be expecting it to happen anytime.
[1:55:38] Hallelujah.
[1:55:40] God can heal. God can save. God can fill
[1:55:43] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:45] But you've got to want it.
[1:55:49] [Applause]
[1:55:51] Brother Tommy was telling me while we're
[1:55:53] fishing talking about how that people,
[1:55:54] man, you just can't hardly shove it down
[1:55:56] their throat. No matter how much you try
[1:55:57] to give them, they just don't want it.
[1:55:59] And you know, and I'm like, you know,
[1:56:01] that's the that's the idea is we want
[1:56:03] people to have what we have. We want you
[1:56:05] to have it. So, you got to have this.
[1:56:09] Hello. How many believe that, man? How
[1:56:11] who wouldn't want this?

[1:56:37] come to Christ, you're insane.

[1:56:46] don't have the Holy Ghost, you're not
[1:56:47] riding your my mind by mine.

[2:17:08] know, it's not worth so much if it isn't
[2:17:10] in the hands of God. Ain't that right?
[2:17:12] It would have been better for somebody
[2:17:14] not to have been born. The Bible says,
[2:17:16] if you uh don't come to the knowledge of
[2:17:19] the truth. We thank God for what has
[2:17:22] happened in Brother Sea's life. Amen.

[2:17:26] we've seen in his life, the change and
[2:17:28] the moving of the spirit. Amen. Over the
[2:17:30] last several years. Amen. As we did with
[2:17:33] brother Glenn and Sister Sherry and and
[2:17:35] Patty and how grateful we are for that
[2:17:37] second row back there. Amen.
[2:17:39] So, we really appreciate them. And Amen.
[2:17:42] And uh so we're just going to baptize
[2:17:44] him this morning in the name of the Lord
[2:17:45] Jesus Christ. In Acts two, when those
[2:17:48] Israelites when they were pricricked in
[2:17:50] their hearts, the Bible says, "Amen."
[2:17:52] They said, "Men and brethren, what shall
[2:17:53] we do?" And Peter said those famous
[2:17:56] words. He says, "Repent every one of you
[2:17:58] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:18:00] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[2:18:02] sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
[2:18:04] the Holy Ghost. For the promise is to
[2:18:06] you, Amen. to those that are down
[2:18:08] through the dark ages all the way to the
[2:18:11] end. As many as the Lord our God shall
[2:18:13] call." Amen. Come on.
[2:18:17] [Applause]
[2:18:19] Amen. We now baptize you in the name of
[2:18:22] the Lord Jesus
[2:18:22] Christ.
[2:18:26] [Applause]
[2:18:42] Hallelujah.
[2:18:45] That's right.
[2:18:51] [Music]
[2:18:53] Precious name of Jesus.
[2:18:55] Amen.
[2:18:56] Precious name. How many knows it's a
[2:18:57] precious name.
[2:18:58] Amen.
[2:18:59] Amen. It says Patty the same way. Amen.
[2:19:04] We're very thankful for the work of the
[2:19:06] Lord that he's done in her life also.
[2:19:12] Amen. Come on over here.
[2:19:14] Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we just
[2:19:16] come before you, Lord. We thank you,
[2:19:18] Lord, for brother Sean and sister Patty.
[2:19:20] Lord, as we're about to baptize her now,
[2:19:22] Lord Jesus, Father, we believe that
[2:19:24] she's already received the baptism of
[2:19:26] your spirit. Even as Peter said in Acts
[2:19:28] 10 there, he says those who had received
[2:19:30] the Holy Ghost, then he commanded them
[2:19:32] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:19:34] Christ. And Lord, we ask God that you'll
[2:19:36] bless her life, but Sean's life, Lord
[2:19:38] Jesus, and help them to walk in your
[2:19:40] foot.
[2:19:55] [Applause]
[2:20:10] Oh, thank you. Thank you, Lord, for
[2:20:14] saving me.
[2:20:19] Oh, thank you. Thank you Lord for
