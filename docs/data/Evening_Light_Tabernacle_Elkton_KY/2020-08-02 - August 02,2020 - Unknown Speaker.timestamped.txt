[16:05] here that we're going to ask him if

[16:09] also i just noticed that's ashton right
[16:12] yeah i'm good i don't know her husband's
[16:15] name but god bless you it's good to have
[16:16] you all here with us this morning
[16:26] good morning saints sanctified ones
[16:31] this little song he leadeth me and hold
[16:33] him but it was on my heart a few months
[16:34] ago really
[16:35] quite a lot because my son had taken a
[16:37] study with the young people on the
[16:38] monarch butterfly and it's the first
[16:40] time
[16:41] i'd kind of heard a little bit about it
[16:42] but i didn't you all may already know
[16:44] all about it
[16:45] but it's quite striking that how god
[16:48] leads that little monarch butterfly and
[16:50] if you don't know all i can tell you
[16:52] really briefly here but they leave
[16:54] mexico
[16:56] in the spring in the uh spring and head
[16:59] to canada it's 3 000 miles
[17:01] and it takes them i think four
[17:03] generations
[17:04] going to canada from mexico along the
[17:07] way they stop and
[17:08] the butterfly lays eggs and then she
[17:10] dies off and then those eggs
[17:12] become caterpillars right and then they
[17:14] cocoon and come into the butterfly
[17:16] and then they continue their journey and
[17:18] then along the way they stop again and
[17:20] that happens four
[17:21] times i believe so now the fifth
[17:24] generation which is the great
[17:25] great grandchildren of that original
[17:27] butterfly are the ones that arrive in
[17:29] canada and then in the fall that fifth
[17:32] generation
[17:33] that great great grandchildren
[17:36] of that original leaves canada
[17:40] and goes back to mexico in one flight
[17:42] it's three thousand miles
[17:44] and goes all the way and goes back to
[17:47] the same they say it's the same
[17:48] 40 acres and oftentimes the same tree
[17:51] that their great
[17:52] great grandparent was cocooned in go
[17:55] back to that very
[17:56] same tree and there's no explanation for
[17:58] it and but i always i look at it like
[18:00] the scripture says the
[18:02] fool has said in his heart there's no
[18:04] god just that little example
[18:06] of that butterfly four generations later
[18:09] that can find its way back to the very
[18:11] same tree it's supernatural
[18:13] and that's why they say it's a mystery
[18:15] it's not a mystery it's supernatural
[18:16] it's
[18:17] it's just god there's no other way to
[18:19] explain it but then we look at it like
[18:21] this so this is just the animal kingdom
[18:22] right these are butterflies like the
[18:24] scripture says
[18:25] five sparrows fall to the ground but
[18:27] it's just the animal kingdom not
[18:29] created in god's own image but now we as
[18:32] sons and daughters of god
[18:34] created in the very image of god if god
[18:36] will lead that little butterfly then
[18:38] how much confidence can we have that god
[18:41] would lead us as sons and daughters with
[18:44] eternal life
[18:44] created in the image of god that he'll
[18:47] lead us and it's not always mountaintops
[18:49] and you look at king david he
[18:51] he didn't he was anointed he didn't god
[18:53] didn't take him straight to the throne
[18:54] if you look he was 10 years
[18:57] running for his life and hiding in caves
[18:59] and living like a dog with saul trying
[19:01] to kill him
[19:02] before he ever went to a throne but yet
[19:03] god was leading him
[19:06] amen he leadeth me what a beautiful
[19:09] thing to be led of god
[19:14] i think it's evil just try and see
[19:17] [Music]
[19:20] he leadeth me o
[19:24] blessed thought o
[19:28] words with heavenly
[19:31] comfort fought whatever i do
[19:37] wherever i be
[19:40] still tis god's hand
[19:44] that leadeth me
[19:48] he leadeth me leadeth me
[19:54] by his own hand
[19:57] he leadeth me
[20:01] his faithful followers
[20:06] would be for by
[20:09] his hand he leadeth me
[20:15] sometimes mid scenes
[20:18] of deep gloom
[20:22] sometimes where eden's
[20:26] flowers bloom
[20:28] by waters calm
[20:32] over troubled sea
[20:35] still tis god's hand
[20:40] that leadeth me he
[20:43] leadeth me as he
[20:46] leadeth me by his
[20:50] own hand he leadeth me
[20:55] and he is faithful a follower
[20:59] i would be for by
[21:03] his hand he leadeth me
[21:09] lord i would clasp
[21:13] thy hand in mine nor
[21:16] ever murmur
[21:20] nor complain
[21:23] content whatever lot i
[21:28] see since tis
[21:31] my god that leadeth me
[21:36] and when my task
[21:40] on earth is done
[21:43] when by thy grace
[21:46] the victories won
[21:50] even death's cold wave i
[21:54] will not flee since god
[21:58] through jordan leadeth me
[22:04] he leadeth me
[22:06] [Music]
[22:08] leadeth me by his own hand
[22:14] he leadeth me
[22:17] his faithful follower

[30:39] we sell nuts and bolts for manufacturing
[30:42] companies and
[30:43] and i had a i have a customer down here
[30:46] i think it's in
[30:47] glasgow or somewhere close to maybe
[30:49] close to bowling green
[30:51] and i was driving down from the meeting
[30:53] and
[30:54] and uh it just seemed like the lord
[30:57] impressed something on my heart
[30:58] about maybe getting in touch with a
[31:01] few different churches in kentucky and i
[31:04] thought about brother tom and i don't
[31:06] know all the different places i
[31:08] talked to brother daniel andy's he was
[31:09] telling me different ones and
[31:11] i was writing down the names and
[31:12] addresses and and uh
[31:14] some time went by against several months
[31:16] maybe six or so
[31:18] months and just couldn't get away from
[31:20] it just kept feeling something my heart
[31:22] the lord pressed me to to god bless you
[31:25] brother
[31:25] john is that right hey god bless you
[31:27] brother john and so i'm just pressing my
[31:29] heart
[31:30] but i needed to get in touch with uh
[31:32] brother tom and
[31:34] and i normally wouldn't do that to call
[31:36] somebody but i just
[31:37] felt in my heart that the lord wanted me
[31:39] to to come here
[31:41] and i don't believe it's it's it's a
[31:43] person but i believe that the lord cares
[31:47] as the brother was um speaking in the
[31:49] song service about that message he cares
[31:52] do you care
[31:52] it's just really really impressing that
[31:55] message on my heart
[31:56] last night i was praying and listening
[31:58] to that message on the road
[32:00] coming down here today he cares he cares
[32:03] for each and every one of us
[32:04] he cares for you this morning he's a
[32:06] real god
[32:08] he's the god that created the world he's
[32:10] the god that created the trees the
[32:11] streams the rivers the birds the
[32:13] butterflies
[32:14] but he's the god that created you and me
[32:17] the bible says he didn't come in the
[32:19] form of the angels
[32:20] he didn't come in the in the form of an
[32:22] animal or something like that but he
[32:24] came
[32:24] like his brothers that he could be one
[32:27] of us
[32:28] that he could go through the things that
[32:29] we go through he could go through the
[32:31] trials and the temptations and the
[32:33] hardships of life that we go through
[32:35] that he could be a faithful high priest
[32:38] that he could help us in this road of
[32:40] life so i just want to
[32:42] preach along those things this morning
[32:44] just to be that the lord would speak to
[32:47] you
[32:47] and encourage you the things that god's
[32:49] laid on my heart i pray that i can
[32:51] communicate it in a way that
[32:52] that it would be effective to your life
[32:54] this morning let's stand together
[33:00] i would like to read over in first
[33:01] corinthians chapter nine
[33:05] and um i don't i don't travel a lot
[33:08] a lot preaching normally helped
[33:11] my dad out at home leading the songs
[33:13] there brother william helps out
[33:15] and with the song service and we kind of
[33:18] work together and
[33:19] and minister at home but when the lord
[33:23] lays it in my heart
[33:24] i i know i have to be obedient to that
[33:27] and i feel i know i get in trouble if i
[33:28] want if i won't do that
[33:30] so but by god's grace we just want to
[33:33] make it don't we
[33:35] amen first corinthians chapter 9
[33:40] and i want to start reading on verse 24
[33:50] know ye not that they which run in the
[33:53] race
[33:53] run all but one receiveth the prize
[33:59] so run that you may obtain
[34:03] and everyone every man that striveth for
[34:05] the mastery is tempered in all things
[34:09] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[34:11] crown
[34:12] but we an incorruptible i therefore so
[34:16] run
[34:16] not as uncertainly fight i not
[34:20] as one that beateth the air but i keep
[34:22] under my body and bring it into
[34:24] subjection
[34:25] lest that by any means when i have
[34:27] preached to others i myself should be
[34:30] cast away i would like to take my
[34:33] thought this morning
[34:34] run that she may obtain i want to read
[34:38] also in hebrews chapter 12
[34:43] and verse 1 2 and 3.
[34:55] we're foreseeing we are also we also are
[34:58] compassed about with so
[35:00] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[35:03] aside
[35:04] every weight and the sin which doth so
[35:07] easily beset us
[35:09] and let us run with patience
[35:12] the race that is set before us looking
[35:15] unto jesus
[35:16] the author and finisher of our faith
[35:19] for the joy that was set before him
[35:21] endured the cross
[35:23] despising the shame and they set down
[35:26] at the right hand of the throne of god
[35:30] can we say these three words together
[35:32] for consider
[35:34] him can we say that for consider him
[35:37] that endured such contradiction of
[35:39] sinners against himself
[35:41] lest we be wearied and faint in our
[35:45] minds
[35:46] amen you can be seated my dad's been
[35:49] preaching a series
[35:51] he just finished back home on galatians
[35:53] chapter six
[35:54] about not not fainting and and not being
[35:58] weary and well doing and uh this morning
[36:01] the lord laid in my heart
[36:02] about this thought run that she may
[36:04] obtain
[36:07] and uh i haven't haven't preached
[36:08] anywhere else that i know of
[36:10] specifically this this title but i just
[36:13] felt it impressed in my heart to speak
[36:14] with you this morning
[36:16] about running the race that we may
[36:18] obtain
[36:20] and we sing a song that says uh many
[36:22] have started in the race
[36:24] but with the light refused to keep pace
[36:27] others accepted it
[36:28] because it was new but not very many
[36:31] expect
[36:31] to go through but i'm going through i'm
[36:34] going through how many feel that way
[36:36] this morning
[36:36] you say many have started the race but i
[36:39] am determined to go through
[36:41] that paul said for we know in whom we
[36:44] have believed
[36:45] and we are persuaded that he is able
[36:48] to keep that which we've committed to
[36:50] him against that day
[36:51] for we know who we have believed and
[36:54] here in hebrews 12
[36:55] 1 he said consider him consider jesus
[36:59] christ
[37:00] the one who has gone before us our elder
[37:03] brother amen we know who we have put our
[37:05] trust in
[37:06] we know who we believed in and i might
[37:09] refer to several scriptures or a few
[37:11] things in the message of brother branham
[37:12] this morning and
[37:13] uh i just want to kind of i don't want
[37:15] to get going too fast
[37:17] i want to go kind of a little bit slower
[37:19] if i can to get started and then we see
[37:20] how the lord leads
[37:22] but here we read here he said let us run
[37:26] with patience and i've been thinking on
[37:28] that late in the last several
[37:30] months about weeks and even running with
[37:33] patience what does he mean to run with
[37:35] patience
[37:37] you know and uh i i looked up this word
[37:40] what about patience and and what he's
[37:42] saying is to run
[37:44] with as an endurance that's not this
[37:47] race there's different types of racism
[37:49] when i was young i used to
[37:50] run a a mile race and it was about how
[37:53] fast could you run a mile
[37:55] and it was more of a sprint type race
[37:58] but this race of life that we're in it's
[38:01] the race to to to the rapture and the
[38:03] race to see jesus
[38:04] it's a race that it's an endurance race
[38:07] it's
[38:08] something that you're in for the long
[38:09] run it's not you get up one day in one
[38:12] month and then
[38:13] and then you just you put everything
[38:14] into it and then you fall by the wayside
[38:16] and you're right you're out of breath
[38:17] and and
[38:18] you can't catch your breath and you fall
[38:19] down it's like lord you know i got
[38:21] started good but then i've lost
[38:23] track no it's it's an endurance race
[38:26] it's something that it's every day
[38:28] like brother brown said it's an everyday
[38:30] rugged life living for god
[38:32] in the message man run from the prince
[38:34] lord remember he talked about
[38:35] responsibilities and he said
[38:37] christianity is an everyday
[38:39] rugged life living for god every day
[38:42] getting up sometimes you don't feel like
[38:44] getting up out of bed every how many
[38:45] ever feel that way
[38:46] sometimes you don't feel like getting
[38:48] out of bed you know but sometimes you
[38:50] don't feel like going to work
[38:51] you don't feel like taking care of your
[38:53] kids or taking care of the farm or
[38:55] whatever you got to do
[38:56] sometimes you just don't feel like it
[38:58] you feel weary in your body
[39:00] you feel weary in your mind and your
[39:02] spirit and you go through trials and you
[39:04] go through troubles in life and it and
[39:06] it puts pressure on you and you just
[39:07] sometimes you
[39:08] feel like giving up but we have to keep
[39:11] our eyes on jesus
[39:13] because the bible teaches us that he
[39:15] endured
[39:16] all things like a man he was tempted in
[39:19] every way that we are tempted
[39:21] he was tempted with giving up he was
[39:24] tempted at the guard and he said father
[39:26] that not my will the lord if it could be
[39:29] possible
[39:30] may i not have to go through this life
[39:33] he didn't want to go through it he
[39:35] didn't want to go through those things
[39:36] and
[39:37] brother branham he came through these
[39:38] trials in his life where
[39:40] we felt like lord if i could just if you
[39:42] just take my life
[39:44] but god wouldn't allow it to be i think
[39:46] of elijah
[39:47] after he had gone through a great
[39:49] victory on mount carmel
[39:51] and then he was he was running from the
[39:53] lord and
[39:54] running into a place of hiding and he
[39:56] said lord just take my life
[39:59] how many have ever felt like that lord
[40:01] and you don't have to be afraid to say
[40:03] just open confessions lord sometimes i
[40:05] feel like i wish i wasn't alive
[40:08] but that's a natural p that's the next
[40:10] this whole natural body
[40:12] but but we serve a god that is
[40:14] supernatural
[40:15] and we need supernatural strength to
[40:17] make it through this hour
[40:19] we need the reality the power of god
[40:22] we it's a god that they they can change
[40:25] the situation
[40:26] a god that that opened the red sea the
[40:29] god that that brought the pillar of fire
[40:31] into the lion's den
[40:33] the god that appeared in the in the when
[40:35] the hebrews and the fourth man
[40:38] we need that in our life we need prayer
[40:41] in our life
[40:42] we need consecration to a supernatural
[40:45] god
[40:46] amen we're living in dark trying evil
[40:49] times and we need the lord
[40:52] to make himself real to us the bible
[40:54] teaches us in the book of ezekiel he
[40:56] said i'll be your god
[40:58] that's a personal god brother sister we
[41:01] need that personal god
[41:03] like the brother sing the song lord lead
[41:06] me
[41:06] he said the holy spirit would be a guide
[41:09] he would be a leader he would be
[41:11] somebody that could lead us
[41:13] and guide us he said i'll go away i'll
[41:15] send the comforter
[41:17] john chapter 14 15 16 you read it he
[41:20] said i'll be a comforter to you
[41:23] i'll be a guide to you i'll bring all
[41:25] things to your remembrance whatsoever
[41:27] i've commanded you
[41:28] we need that hallelujah lord bring to my
[41:31] remembrance
[41:32] bring to my remembrance the things that
[41:34] you have done for me
[41:35] the testimonies that god has done for us
[41:38] oh i'm all over the place but in the
[41:40] book of psalms
[41:42] david said lord he said i'll turn my
[41:45] feet to thy testimonies
[41:48] he said i'll turn my feet to that
[41:50] testimonies that's what we need
[41:51] sometimes saying to god
[41:53] when we get down for prayer it's so easy
[41:55] to say lord please help me with this
[41:57] please help me with that
[41:58] but when you begin to turn your feet
[42:01] your eyes
[42:02] your direction to the testimonies of god
[42:04] and look back and say lord god you did
[42:06] this for me and you did this for me
[42:08] and you did this for me and you come to
[42:10] a place like david did
[42:12] in psalm 124 he said if it had not been
[42:15] for the lord
[42:16] it was on my side he said then the
[42:18] enemies would have come and overtaken me
[42:21] but if it had not been forgotten it was
[42:23] on my side
[42:24] where would i be saints of god we could
[42:26] say that this morning if it wasn't for
[42:28] god brother that picked you up
[42:30] in your lowest place then the devil
[42:33] would have overtaken your life
[42:35] but you're here this morning because god
[42:38] the bible says god is for me
[42:40] the bible says in the book of psalms he
[42:43] had given commandment
[42:44] to save me he said you're my rod and
[42:47] your staff
[42:48] they comfort me hallelujah he said you
[42:51] prepare a table for me
[42:52] when there's nothing to eat lord god
[42:54] prepares a table for you
[42:56] in the presence of your enemies he said
[42:59] i'll anoint your head with oil
[43:01] he said your couple run over and the
[43:03] greatest party said surely
[43:05] surely how many can sit with me surely
[43:08] goodness
[43:09] and mercy shall follow you
[43:12] all the days of your life and you'll
[43:14] dwell in the house of the lord forever
[43:18] oh praise be to god can you say thank
[43:20] you lord this morning
[43:22] if it had not been to the lord brother
[43:24] rand preaching a message god rich and
[43:25] mercy he said what if it had not been
[43:27] for the mercy of god
[43:29] what if it had not been for god oh
[43:32] we could say thank the lord this morning
[43:34] and when you turn your feet to the
[43:36] testimonies of god
[43:37] and you see you look back and you see
[43:39] god you did that
[43:40] and that was supernatural god you did
[43:43] that and that was supernatural
[43:46] hallelujah this is how joshua and caleb
[43:48] felt
[43:49] when they came up to the jordan river
[43:51] and they looked back
[43:52] and they had been traveling there with
[43:54] the children of israel 40 years in the
[43:55] wilderness
[43:57] and people complaining and people
[43:58] falling away and you had core and data
[44:00] and you had different ones
[44:02] that they they began to doubt and they
[44:04] began to to be afraid
[44:06] and they began to spread these things
[44:08] throughout the camp
[44:09] oh what a day of fear that we live in
[44:12] everywhere you walk
[44:13] there's just fear all around you said
[44:15] you look at your fellow americans you
[44:16] would have thought how could it be that
[44:18] americans would be in such fear
[44:20] in such terror and would just bend down
[44:22] their knee to
[44:23] anything everybody tells them put a mask
[44:25] on do this do that
[44:26] god forgive us there is a virus we know
[44:29] that but but
[44:30] but there's we're not given a spirit of
[44:32] fear
[44:34] but yet we live in this time the bible
[44:35] teaches us that in the last days
[44:37] men's hearts are failing them for fear
[44:42] and because iniquity abounded the love
[44:44] of many wax cold
[44:48] but oh my if we could just keep our eyes
[44:51] on the christ
[44:52] keep our eyes on the testimonies of god
[44:55] and look to what god has done
[44:57] for us then we can see like joshua and
[45:01] caleb
[45:01] now they look back and they could say
[45:03] look he's brought us through the red sea
[45:05] he did the mighty miracles he did all
[45:07] these things
[45:08] and when god spoke to joshua what did he
[45:10] say he said joshua he said moses my
[45:13] servant is dead in joshua chapter one
[45:15] he said but be thou strong and very
[45:19] courageous
[45:20] for the lord god is with you wheresoever
[45:23] you go
[45:24] oh my that's all we need to hear god
[45:26] speak to us this morning
[45:28] brother sister be strong and be very
[45:31] courageous
[45:32] for god is with you for he has said i
[45:34] will never leave thee
[45:35] and never forsake thee hebrews chapter
[45:38] 13 that you may boldly say
[45:40] the lord is my helper hallelujah can you
[45:44] say that this morning

[45:51] friend that's that's been called along
[45:53] to help me
[45:55] hallelujah we need that oh what a friend
[45:57] we have in jesus
[45:59] this song says oh what peace we often
[46:01] forfeit
[46:03] oh what needless pain we bear
[46:06] all because we do not carry everything
[46:09] to god in prayer
[46:11] oh my that's the place where god takes
[46:14] your burdens
[46:15] at calvary we must meet him in calvary
[46:19] every day
[46:20] and say lord i cast my burdens on you
[46:23] today
[46:24] i cast my cares on you today
[46:27] we're carrying so many weights and
[46:29] burdens and cares
[46:30] because we willingly do this we should
[46:33] play them at the feet of jesus
[46:35] and say lord you were tempted like i was
[46:38] tempted today
[46:39] father you were tempted to give up
[46:41] father you were tempted with depression
[46:43] he went through sicknesses he he took on
[46:46] him the iniquity of us all
[46:49] oh that's when we know to do good and
[46:50] we're honoring we don't do it
[46:52] oh he he carried those iniquities he
[46:55] carried those sorrows he carried
[46:57] everything for us
[47:01] hallelujah saints of god he was
[47:04] manifested in this last day the bible

[47:10] hallelujah god
[47:11] was made flesh for me and you hallelujah
[47:14] i don't know but i choose to believe it
[47:16] i choose to believe that i was in god's
[47:18] mind before the world was ever made
[47:21] the bible said in revelation that he was
[47:23] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[47:25] the world

[47:29] the bible says
[47:30] i don't know a whole lot about english
[47:32] but i know when it says he was
[47:33] wounded that's a past tense word he was
[47:36] wounded for our transgressions
[47:38] in god's mind here's the prophet isaiah
[47:40] hundreds of thousands years before
[47:42] christ ever came
[47:43] and is saying that he was already
[47:45] wounded for our transgressions
[47:47] he was already bruised for our
[47:49] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[47:52] was upon him because in god's mind he
[47:54] was a lamb already slain
[47:56] a sacrifice away brother away already
[47:59] prepared
[48:00] for you to make it through this evil
[48:02] time god's already made the way
[48:05] god's already prepared the way god's
[48:07] already made a way of escape that you
[48:09] can be able to bear it
[48:10] he said i won't put you on put on you
[48:12] anything more than you can bear
[48:14] but with the temptation he will make a
[48:17] way of escape oh we must look to god
[48:21] we must pray to him we must look to
[48:23] christ for the answer we sing the song
[48:26] christ is the answer for all i need
[48:29] christ is the answer he's the savior
[48:32] baptizer hallelujah
[48:35] he's everything we have need of
[48:38] oh praise god so they look back they're
[48:41] saying
[48:42] god you brought us through these many
[48:43] temptations in the wilderness you
[48:45] brought us through the red sea brought
[48:46] us through all these things

[49:50] about a little dog
[49:52] if god cares about a little dog god
[49:54] cares about you and me
[49:56] the bible said that he each cares about
[49:57] the spell
[49:59] he said about the lilies of the field
[50:00] they don't toil they'll spend
[50:02] but yet your heavenly father careth

[50:10] hallelujah oh god cares
[50:13] he understands in the book of psalms
[50:17] 139 the bible says that he knows our
[50:19] downsetting
[50:20] and he knows our uprising he
[50:24] understandeth
[50:25] hallelujah my bible says thou
[50:27] understandeth my
[50:29] thought afar off oh we sing a song back
[50:33] home hide thou me
[50:34] o rock of ages hide thou me when life's
[50:38] dark veil i wonder
[50:40] far far from thee then i cry o
[50:43] rock of ages hide thou me the bible says
[50:46] when the righteous cry
[50:47] the lord heareth and delivereth him out
[50:50] of all of his troubles
[50:51] do you believe it this morning that when
[50:54] you cry
[50:55] out to god it doesn't matter if you're
[50:57] possessed of a demon spirit
[50:59] because there was a man that was
[51:00] possessed by a demon spirit one day
[51:03] and god said i gotta go over this this
[51:05] this waterway
[51:06] i gotta go find that man and there was a
[51:09] man crying
[51:10] out in the tombs he was crying what he
[51:13] was bound
[51:14] and chased but crying out to god and the
[51:17] bible says if the righteous cry the lord
[51:19] heareth and delivereth and out of all
[51:21] their
[51:22] troubles are you willing to cry out it's
[51:25] not necessarily yes with your voice
[51:26] you cry you speak but with your heart
[51:29] the heart also cries
[51:31] the bible says that the lord is nine to
[51:34] them that are of a broken savior such as
[51:36] be of a contrite spirit
[51:39] oh that's the problem today we get so
[51:41] lifted up in pride
[51:42] that we think we can do it we think we
[51:44] can make it but the song says that i
[51:46] can't even walk without him holding my
[51:48] hand
[51:49] jesus said in john chapter 15 he said
[51:52] without me
[51:54] you can do nothing without him we can do
[51:57] nothing
[51:58] hallelujah oh we need god don't we
[52:01] we need to look to him hallelujah i have
[52:04] a source of strength
[52:05] when i am weak brother sister do you
[52:07] know what that source is
[52:08] look to the hill whence cometh your help
[52:11] david said my help cometh from the lord
[52:14] which made heaven and earth look to
[52:15] calvary this morning look to the place
[52:18] where he said he is finished where he
[52:20] said it's all finished for you today
[52:23] hallelujah i want to keep my eyes
[52:25] focused on the one who has the keys
[52:28] who has the keys who has the keys of
[52:30] death hell in the grave

[52:56] and the keys that they lost the keys
[52:58] they couldn't find them anywhere
[52:59] and they went all up and down that beach
[53:01] can you imagine being at a beach
[53:02] and the keys they were just running all
[53:04] up and down the beach with the kids and
[53:05] the keys were
[53:06] anywhere in the sand trillions and
[53:09] trillions of particles
[53:11] of fine sand where are the keys
[53:15] she prayed she believed that god could
[53:17] do something that god could
[53:18] show her where the keys were she said
[53:20] she started walking she went over to the
[53:22] place
[53:22] and she just she just pushed her foot
[53:25] like that and exposed the keys
[53:26] underneath the sand underneath the sand
[53:31] buried but let me tell you friends that
[53:34] god knows where we are
[53:36] god knows exactly where we are he came
[53:38] in this day to show us
[53:39] to tell us that he knows our name he
[53:41] knows our address he knows our condition
[53:43] he knows the very thought and the
[53:44] intents of our heart
[53:45] the very thought and the very intent of
[53:48] your heart before you think the god
[53:50] he knows the intent of your heart

[54:01] god revealed what he thought
[54:03] god knows god cares god understands
[54:07] he knows you're down sitting he knows
[54:09] your uprising hallelujah
[54:12] oh my david said if i take the wings of
[54:15] the morning if i go to the
[54:16] the sea he said even there shall they
[54:18] hand lead me
[54:20] he said my substance was not hid from
[54:22] thee
[54:23] jeremiah he said before i formed you in
[54:25] the belly i knew you
[54:26] brother do you believe that this morning
[54:28] that god knew you in your mother's belly
[54:31] he knew you that as david said i was
[54:33] conceived in sin i was born in sin
[54:35] hallelujah lord help us

[55:22] this
[55:22] is been affected by such a thing what is
[55:25] it
[55:25] brother brown said that god's nature is
[55:28] to always
[55:29] warn man before judgment message
[55:32] warning and judgment to warn a nation
[55:35] before judgment and so forth
[55:37] he always gives his warning
[55:40] and notice this he said he always gives
[55:43] his warning
[55:44] a reminder to we of a responsibility
[55:48] the warning that god has given is a
[55:50] reminder
[55:51] of a responsibility to god's people
[55:56] he said we are responsible and god has
[55:59] put us here on the earth for a reason
[56:01] and that reason that he has put us here
[56:03] for and we are responsible to him
[56:06] for that reason now that comes down to
[56:09] each and every one of us this morning
[56:10] that god has put us on earth for a
[56:13] reason
[56:14] and the warning the warning that we've
[56:16] had this morning called coughing or
[56:18] whatever it is called
[56:19] that god has created and allowed this
[56:21] warning to go over the whole
[56:23] world and what is it the prophet said
[56:25] the warning
[56:26] is a reminder to us of a responsibility
[56:30] that god puts you on this earth for
[56:34] hallelujah he said and you should go to
[56:37] him
[56:38] and find out what he wants you to do

[57:07] that a righteous man hath it
[57:10] it's greater than the treasures of many
[57:11] wicked friends we live in an hour where

[57:14] all force is on us amen trying to get
[57:18] people sidetracked to go here to go
[57:19] there why because we're at the end of

[58:34] the bible says first peter he said he
[58:37] said you're not saved
[58:38] by silver and gold but by the precious
[58:42] blood of christ
[58:43] hallelujah saints of god there's nothing
[58:46] in this world that can redeem us
[58:48] but there's one thing and that's the
[58:49] precious blood of jesus christ
[58:52] for as much first peter chapter 1 verse
[58:55] 18 for as much as you know
[58:57] that you were not redeemed with
[58:59] corruptible things
[59:00] as silver and gold and from your vain
[59:03] conversation received by tradition from
[59:06] your fathers
[59:07] but with the precious blood of christ
[59:10] as of a lamb without blemishes without
[59:12] spot
[59:13] who verily was for ordained
[59:17] before the foundation of the world but
[59:19] was manifest
[59:20] in these last times for you
[59:24] amen brother sister there's no job that
[59:26] can redeem us there's no promotion
[59:28] there's no demotion there's nothing paul
[59:31] said there is neither height
[59:32] nor depth nor any other creature that
[59:35] can separate you
[59:36] from the love of god jesus said if i be
[59:39] lifted up i will draw all men unto me
[59:41] that's what we need we need to lift up
[59:43] christ he was already lifted up on
[59:45] calvary and the bible says that we must
[59:48] always
[59:48] bear in our body the dying of the lord
[59:51] jesus
[59:53] for i am crucified with christ that not
[59:55] i
[59:56] not i but christ who live within me
[59:59] by whom though the world is crucified
[1:00:02] unto me and i am crucified unto the
[1:00:04] world
[1:00:04] paul said i died daily all saints that's
[1:00:08] what we need
[1:00:09] because every day now every day now that
[1:00:12] with this time that we live in this last
[1:00:14] moment of the
[1:00:15] race the devil's trying to throw
[1:00:17] everything he can
[1:00:18] every roadblock could trip you up every
[1:00:21] little thing
[1:00:23] it may be some sickness trying to keep
[1:00:25] you out of church whatever it is stay
[1:00:26] with the word of god
[1:00:29] prophet said in christ revealing his own
[1:00:30] word he said stay with the word
[1:00:32] stay stable put the stabilizer on your
[1:00:35] ship
[1:00:36] because we're we're seeing great big
[1:00:37] clouds around us we're seeing communism
[1:00:40] the prophet told us that
[1:00:41] uniting time and sign communism it's
[1:00:43] uniting what is
[1:00:44] it's the spirits of this world the
[1:00:46] spirits of politics
[1:00:47] the spirits of of the finance and
[1:00:49] everything they're all uniting
[1:00:51] what is a united oh my spoke about world
[1:00:55] council of churches
[1:00:56] you know we have a council of churches
[1:00:57] in the state of kentucky and they've
[1:00:59] they have they have gotten together with
[1:01:00] the governor of the state and they've
[1:01:02] talked about what they're going to do
[1:01:04] everything he spoke about it's true
[1:01:06] everything brother brahm taught us is
[1:01:07] true
[1:01:08] he said in this message warning then
[1:01:09] judgment when god warned he doesn't
[1:01:10] always strike when he warned
[1:01:12] he said a prophet lifted real high he
[1:01:15] said he sees real far off
[1:01:17] he sees what's coming down the road and
[1:01:19] now we see it
[1:01:20] now we're living in the fulfillment
[1:01:21] these messages is more up to date than
[1:01:24] reading our own
[1:01:25] news this is it right here saints of god
[1:01:27] god has sent us
[1:01:28] a prophet he sent us a vindicated word
[1:01:30] of god for this day
[1:01:33] hallelujah he said the warning is a
[1:01:37] reminder of
[1:01:38] irresponsibility that god has put each
[1:01:40] and every one of us here for
[1:01:41] responsibility
[1:01:42] it doesn't matter if you're single it
[1:01:44] doesn't matter if you're married it
[1:01:45] doesn't matter if you're young it
[1:01:46] doesn't matter if you're old
[1:01:48] it doesn't matter if you're living if
[1:01:49] you're breathing and you're hearing the
[1:01:51] sound and the voice of god
[1:01:52] and trying to follow god god as you're
[1:01:55] here for a purpose
[1:01:56] god had pharaoh for a purpose and he
[1:01:59] fulfilled his purpose
[1:02:00] god has a president for a purpose he's
[1:02:02] fulfilling his purpose everybody they're
[1:02:04] all recognizing their position
[1:02:06] brother brown said that that russia is
[1:02:08] recognizing its position
[1:02:09] and this country's recognizing but what
[1:02:11] about god's people recognizing
[1:02:13] their position brother baron said
[1:02:15] recognize they failed to recognize the
[1:02:17] awakening of the bride of christ
[1:02:19] why because he said i'll send a shout
[1:02:22] the shout is a message
[1:02:24] it's a message to get ready because the
[1:02:25] bridegroom is coming
[1:02:27] jesus said in luke 21 he said well you
[1:02:29] see all these things come
[1:02:31] begin to come to pass what'd he say he
[1:02:34] said look up
[1:02:36] lift up your fence for your redemption
[1:02:38] is coming down here it
[1:02:39] comes and first he sent a shout what we
[1:02:41] should be so in tune
[1:02:42] with the word of god in this day that
[1:02:44] our hearts are being united psalms 86

[1:04:38] reaction in the body
[1:04:40] there's a chemical called epinephrine
[1:04:42] it's called adrenaline how many have you
[1:04:44] ever heard of it
[1:04:45] many people when they get in urgent
[1:04:46] situations they're able to lift vehicles
[1:04:49] off of
[1:04:49] off of crushed bodies and they're able
[1:04:51] to do all kinds of things why
[1:04:53] because this chemical that's released in
[1:04:54] their body what does it do
[1:04:56] it shuts down all non-essential
[1:04:58] functions and drives the blood flow to
[1:05:00] the essential muscles and
[1:05:02] and the essential awareness of the body
[1:05:04] so your keen eyesight
[1:05:05] you may not have your peripheral but you
[1:05:07] got your you can see
[1:05:09] you can see straight you may not have uh
[1:05:12] all different non-essentials but but you
[1:05:14] got more blood flow to those core muscle
[1:05:18] groups why because you're at the you're
[1:05:20] in a sense you're in a place of urgency
[1:05:22] that's what we need we need to lay aside
[1:05:25] every way brother sister we need to lay
[1:05:26] aside every weight
[1:05:27] every trouble everything that would
[1:05:29] weight you down in this last mile it's
[1:05:31] paul said lay aside every weight think
[1:05:34] about what this colbit has done
[1:05:35] stay at home stay at home
[1:05:38] there's never been a time that we could
[1:05:41] ever remember we can search through
[1:05:42] history books that they said stay at
[1:05:43] home but all over the world
[1:05:47] but all over the world what did god tell
[1:05:50] hezekiah
[1:05:51] he said hezekiah set your house in order
[1:05:55] set your house in order what does it
[1:05:57] mean stay at home maybe set your house
[1:05:59] in order
[1:06:00] oh if we can't see that the blind man
[1:06:02] could hit that ball out of the park as
[1:06:03] the brother
[1:06:04] said stay at home i mean set your house
[1:06:06] in order if there was ever a time that
[1:06:08] we should be setting our house in orders
[1:06:10] now
[1:06:11] but lebron said i'm gonna let i'm gonna
[1:06:12] take the church
[1:06:14] to a higher place in 1963 breaks the
[1:06:16] token
[1:06:17] he said the tokeny sigmund kicked the
[1:06:19] trash out
[1:06:20] if there's ever a time to set the house
[1:06:22] in order now is the day brother sister
[1:06:24] if there's ever a time for you to lay
[1:06:26] aside the non-essential things that have
[1:06:28] taken your time
[1:06:29] the bible's in the book of ephesians
[1:06:31] redeem redeem it means take back your
[1:06:34] time
[1:06:35] can you say that with me this morning
[1:06:36] take back the time
[1:06:38] for the days are evil hallelujah
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:43] set your house in order for the coming
[1:06:45] of the lord
[1:06:47] hallelujah oh my we ought to be setting
[1:06:49] our house in order
[1:06:51] he said lay aside every weight i
[1:06:53] prepared a little illustration for you
[1:06:55] this morning
[1:06:56] i remember the very first sermon the
[1:06:57] lord inspired my heart to preach i was
[1:06:58] 19 years old
[1:07:00] used to cut grass out neighborhood and i
[1:07:03] was out cutting grass one day and this
[1:07:04] scripture kept coming to me over and
[1:07:06] over again hebrews 12 1
[1:07:08] lay aside every wave lay aside every way
[1:07:10] how many remember the story of elijah
[1:07:12] when he went to elisha
[1:07:14] and he threw the mental on him didn't
[1:07:15] say anything just put the mantle on him
[1:07:18] right but then
[1:07:21] elijah he went back and he burned the ox
[1:07:24] he burned the card he burned it all and
[1:07:26] he followed he just laid it aside
[1:07:28] he just laid it aside peter and andrew
[1:07:30] they were down by the
[1:07:31] by the sea one day fishing and jesus
[1:07:33] came by and said follow me the bible
[1:07:34] said and immediately
[1:07:36] they left their nets immediately they
[1:07:38] left their nets
[1:07:39] and jesus said in the book of i believe
[1:07:41] it's in matthew chapter 16 he said if
[1:07:44] you're going to follow me
[1:07:45] he said you got to take up your cross
[1:07:47] and follow me
[1:07:48] matthew chapter 16.
[1:07:53] he says here if any man will come after
[1:07:58] me
[1:07:58] let him deny himself and take up the
[1:08:01] cross
[1:08:02] and follow me brother
[1:08:05] sister there is no other way
[1:08:08] there is no other way we don't have to
[1:08:11] be emotional about it we just read it
[1:08:13] say lord you said take up the cross and
[1:08:14] follow you he told nicodemus he said
[1:08:17] nicodemus he said you must be born again
[1:08:21] if you're going to enter into the
[1:08:22] kingdom of god he said you must be born
[1:08:24] again
[1:08:25] why because he goes on to explain in
[1:08:26] john 3 he said that which is born of the
[1:08:28] flesh
[1:08:28] is flesh that which is born of the
[1:08:32] spirit
[1:08:33] is spirit he said in galatians chapter 6
[1:08:35] what did he say
[1:08:36] if you sow to the flesh of the flesh
[1:08:40] you'll reap corruption if you sow to the
[1:08:43] spirit
[1:08:44] of the spirit you'll reap life
[1:08:45] everlasting galatians 6
[1:08:47] how can you sow to the spirit unless you
[1:08:49] be of the spirit
[1:08:51] amen he said you must be born again you
[1:08:53] must have the spirit of christ
[1:08:55] you must have something supernatural
[1:08:57] romans 8
[1:08:58] he said romans 8 said if if the same
[1:09:00] spirit that raised jesus from the dead
[1:09:02] dwelling you it will make you alive paul
[1:09:06] said that there's nothing that matters
[1:09:07] but a new creature
[1:09:10] old things passed away behold all things
[1:09:12] become new saints of god that's the
[1:09:14] problem with the church today
[1:09:15] we have too many flesh born children
[1:09:18] sitting in the pew
[1:09:19] and very few spirit born children
[1:09:21] sitting in the pew
[1:09:23] because he'd never been born again
[1:09:26] brother brown said in the message you
[1:09:28] must be born again i don't have it here
[1:09:30] this morning but he said there's an
[1:09:31] approach to this birth
[1:09:32] what is the approach john chapter 12
[1:09:34] verse 24 jesus said accept
[1:09:37] something die it cannot live again
[1:09:40] right i mean if anybody a farmer here
[1:09:42] except that corn of wheat
[1:09:44] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[1:09:47] alone in the bag on the shelf at the
[1:09:48] supermarket
[1:09:49] but if it falls into the ground and that
[1:09:51] that old corruptable thing dies around
[1:09:53] it
[1:09:54] and the seed is exposed to the power of
[1:09:56] god
[1:09:57] to the spirit to the word of god then
[1:09:59] something is quickened something comes
[1:10:02] to life
[1:10:03] hallelujah praise be to god when i was
[1:10:06] 18 years old i was laying there
[1:10:08] raised in church slept underneath the
[1:10:10] pews growing up but i remember being in
[1:10:12] the presence of god
[1:10:14] i remember being in services where where
[1:10:17] god was making the stone
[1:10:18] and speaking of one brother came he uh
[1:10:21] and another brother a preacher come and
[1:10:22] they didn't even know the man
[1:10:25] two brothers two preachers and this
[1:10:27] other man came they didn't even know him
[1:10:30] and that morning that sunday morning
[1:10:32] spoke out in tongues once spoke out in
[1:10:34] tongues the other interpreting told
[1:10:35] exactly that man's life
[1:10:36] from the top to the bottom exactly what
[1:10:38] he was doing
[1:10:39] coming against the ministry and
[1:10:41] everything else god exposed it directly
[1:10:45] we had one brother that that came and
[1:10:47] and he was living in some committed some
[1:10:48] act
[1:10:49] and and that he shouldn't have committed
[1:10:51] and his sister spoke out in tongues
[1:10:52] interpreting called out his name
[1:10:56] praise be to god one day we the angel
[1:10:58] came in a man dressed in in blue jeans
[1:11:01] and a flannel shirt came back sat in the
[1:11:02] back and listened to the whole service
[1:11:03] we played a message of brother branham
[1:11:05] he walked out we had the picture of the
[1:11:06] pillow fire
[1:11:07] he pointed at it he said is this man a
[1:11:08] prophet my dad couldn't tell he was
[1:11:11] asking a question or making a statement
[1:11:12] he tried to put money in his pocket he
[1:11:14] said where you living he said oh just
[1:11:15] here there
[1:11:15] he went out of the threshold of the door
[1:11:17] he stepped out and completely
[1:11:19] disappeared just like that we had an
[1:11:20] angel visitation
[1:11:23] i grew up under this was supernatural
[1:11:25] you have grown up
[1:11:26] seeing hearing about the supernatural
[1:11:28] power of god
[1:11:29] brother baron said the message why
[1:11:31] christ speak he said muslim good enough
[1:11:33] for moses
[1:11:34] to be taught moses had to meet the
[1:11:36] reality that light
[1:11:38] that brought the word of god to reality
[1:11:41] and unless you met
[1:11:42] god and had your own personal experience
[1:11:44] with god or not just you praying to god
[1:11:47] but god speaks back to you when god
[1:11:49] speaks back to you
[1:11:50] paul said to be known of god to know god
[1:11:53] or rather to be known of god
[1:11:56] when god knows you brother when god
[1:11:58] places his seal
[1:11:59] of circumcision upon your life then the
[1:12:02] womb is conceived
[1:12:03] and there's no room for anything else to
[1:12:05] come in brother
[1:12:07] said the womb is closed by
[1:12:08] predestination it's shut off
[1:12:10] nothing can come in hallelujah
[1:12:14] why because the bible says the holy
[1:12:16] ghost overshadowed mary and he was
[1:12:18] conceived of the holy ghost
[1:12:20] and you must be conceived of the holy
[1:12:22] ghost
[1:12:24] and that old life must die it's very
[1:12:27] simple the gospel is very simple in
[1:12:29] first corinthians 15
[1:12:30] paul said he said i showed you the
[1:12:32] gospel where
[1:12:33] christ had died and is buried and rose
[1:12:36] again
[1:12:38] first corinthians 15
[1:12:41] he said in another place there's no
[1:12:43] other gospel
[1:12:44] he said moreover i preach i declare unto
[1:12:46] you the gospel which i preached unto you
[1:12:48] which also you have received and wherein
[1:12:51] you stand
[1:12:52] we stand in this gospel praise god the
[1:12:55] gospel is the good news
[1:12:57] what we were all born and said the bible
[1:12:59] said the soul that sinneth
[1:13:01] it will die forgive me if i'm talking
[1:13:02] too fast this morning
[1:13:04] oh my i can't even have time to turn to
[1:13:06] the scriptures i trust you can catch it
[1:13:07] this one is something you can catch
[1:13:09] but it's very simple jesus died
[1:13:13] he was buried and he rose again
[1:13:16] and brother sister paul said he said
[1:13:19] you've received this gospel you stand in
[1:13:20] this gospel
[1:13:21] he said by which also ye are saved if
[1:13:24] you keep in memory
[1:13:25] what i have preached unto you unless ye
[1:13:28] have believed in vain
[1:13:30] for i delivered unto you first of all
[1:13:32] that which i also received
[1:13:34] how that christ died for our sins
[1:13:37] according to the scriptures
[1:13:39] it was according to the scripture see
[1:13:41] that he died he was sent for a purpose
[1:13:43] he came to do what god told him to do
[1:13:46] hallelujah
[1:13:47] and that he was buried in the third and
[1:13:49] rose again the third day according to
[1:13:51] the scriptures he said this is the
[1:13:53] gospel
[1:13:54] he said keep it in memory oh we must
[1:13:57] die with him there at calvary
[1:14:01] peter said repent of death to self he
[1:14:04] said be buried you must be buried in the
[1:14:06] name of jesus christ
[1:14:07] he said for the removal of your sins
[1:14:11] and not take your name jacob what is
[1:14:13] your name oh we are deceivers
[1:14:15] we are shysters paul said what is paul
[1:14:18] what is apollos he said paul he said i'm
[1:14:21] the least of them all
[1:14:22] he says i was a pharisee i was a rascal
[1:14:25] i was this it was that
[1:14:26] oh but i am what i am by the grace the
[1:14:29] grace of almighty god
[1:14:32] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:14:35] and
[1:14:35] and it's not of yourself it's the gift
[1:14:37] of god
[1:14:39] hallelujah saints of god we gotta
[1:14:41] remember who we have believed
[1:14:43] we gotta remember who we have believed
[1:14:47] and we gotta be persuaded that he is
[1:14:49] able
[1:14:51] hallelujah paul wrote to the hebrews he
[1:14:54] said he that cometh to god
[1:14:55] you must believe jesus said if you
[1:14:58] believe
[1:14:59] you can be passed from death unto life
[1:15:02] oh there's so much doubt
[1:15:03] there's so much unbelief in this world
[1:15:05] that we live people run to the doctor
[1:15:06] they run to their wallet they run
[1:15:08] everywhere but jesus christ
[1:15:13] why because it's rich increased with
[1:15:15] goods but one of these days there's
[1:15:17] going to come a reckoning
[1:15:18] there's coming reckoning since god we're
[1:15:20] receiving a warning now
[1:15:22] set your house in order be ready for the
[1:15:24] coming of the lord
[1:15:27] oh my it's a time to lay aside every
[1:15:30] weight as i'm mowing the grass and this
[1:15:31] this verse could come to me lay aside
[1:15:33] lay aside lay aside
[1:15:35] so i'd do this little illustration for
[1:15:37] you this morning
[1:15:40] i trust that you'll never forget it i
[1:15:42] don't know maybe something has seen it
[1:15:47] well the bottle would be all right if i
[1:15:49] go down there
[1:15:50] okay well maybe you can't see it there
[1:15:54] we tried
[1:16:02] oh okay we'll try
[1:16:05] so i have some water here i have some
[1:16:06] cups and i have some rocks
[1:16:09] and we're gonna take this water and
[1:16:11] we're just gonna
[1:16:12] pour it into this cup and you know this
[1:16:15] is like a good
[1:16:16] revival meeting you go somewhere and you
[1:16:19] feel the presence of god like you felt
[1:16:20] god here this morning
[1:16:22] and you get all filled up you get all
[1:16:24] filled up you feel really good brother
[1:16:26] you feel like you could just take a
[1:16:27] drink of that water you feel like you
[1:16:29] could give it to somebody else the next
[1:16:30] day you say brother and sister look what
[1:16:32] god done for me
[1:16:33] god does something supernatural for you
[1:16:34] all you just want to tell somebody
[1:16:37] oh my what peter when he raised that
[1:16:39] lame man from the gate
[1:16:41] what did he do the bible says he went
[1:16:42] walking and leaping and praising god
[1:16:45] i'm afraid that that's the problem these
[1:16:47] days i'm afraid the problem is we
[1:16:49] haven't seen and witnessed the
[1:16:50] supernatural of god in our life that we
[1:16:53] have no testimony
[1:16:54] but saints of god let me tell you the
[1:16:56] bible says that while you was yet a
[1:16:58] sinner
[1:16:59] christ died for you that in your lowest
[1:17:02] place is when god came to you
[1:17:05] oh you may look at the situation you may
[1:17:07] look at somebody look at your family and
[1:17:08] say oh i'm not going to talk to them
[1:17:10] anymore

[1:17:17] gracious attend to mercy the bible's
[1:17:19] still in lamentation

[1:17:23] compassions they fail not
[1:17:24] great is thy faithfulness hallelujah
[1:17:28] that in our lowest place is when god
[1:17:31] came looking for us
[1:17:33] oh jesus gave a parable one day about a
[1:17:35] shepherd
[1:17:36] he said he had a hundred sheep but one
[1:17:38] of them was lost
[1:17:39] let me tell you about this little lost
[1:17:41] lamb how many know have many ever seen

[1:18:02] these sheep they won't do that

[1:22:05] back to the illustration but you get all
[1:22:07] filled up
[1:22:08] but you know the devil brother branham
[1:22:11] said
[1:22:12] in the message overcome he said
[1:22:14] overcoming means you also have to
[1:22:16] recognize the devil
[1:22:18] you have to recognize your adversary you
[1:22:21] got to recognize that he's against you
[1:22:23] or sometimes we just laugh and all the
[1:22:25] we just make fun
[1:22:26] you know we just make fun of this or
[1:22:28] make fun of that that's the age we live
[1:22:30] in
[1:22:30] that's the age we live in the bible said
[1:22:32] that moses had respect
[1:22:35] moses had respect to the recompense of
[1:22:38] the reward
[1:22:40] we need to have respect to god in this
[1:22:42] hour
[1:22:44] forgive the rebuke but we have to
[1:22:45] respect to god that he died for you
[1:22:48] do you respect the fact that god gave up
[1:22:50] all glory and came in flesh and died for
[1:22:52] you brother
[1:22:53] do you have respect that god said i have
[1:22:56] borne your iniquities
[1:22:58] do you have respect for god that he said
[1:23:00] if you confess your sins i am faithful
[1:23:02] and just to forgive you or your sins and
[1:23:03] cleanse you from all unrighteousness
[1:23:05] you have respect to god that there is
[1:23:07] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:23:10] that are in christ jesus
[1:23:12] do you have respect to his holy spirit
[1:23:14] just to that there's no other way for
[1:23:16] you to get in christ but to be baptized
[1:23:18] by one spirit into one body
[1:23:22] i wonder if we have respect for god i
[1:23:24] wonder if we have respect for the
[1:23:25] prophet of god do we have respect for
[1:23:27] the bible do we have respect for the
[1:23:28] church do we have respect for the gifts
[1:23:30] of god
[1:23:30] the evangelist the prophet the pastor
[1:23:32] the teacher do we have respect for god
[1:23:34] in this hour
[1:23:36] do we take time for god brother brown
[1:23:38] said if you god will take what you give
[1:23:40] him
[1:23:40] the bible says if you have opportunity
[1:23:42] do good unto those of the household of
[1:23:44] faith but we don't take the opportunity
[1:23:46] but we have the opportunity
[1:23:49] oh my we got brothers this morning that
[1:23:51] are over in china locked up in jail

[1:24:03] demons forsaken me and this man's
[1:24:06] forsaken me but god bless
[1:24:07] this man because he hasn't forsaken me

[1:31:28] yourself together
[1:31:29] even the more so as you see the day
[1:31:30] approaching but we see people

[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:07] jesus said it like this he said in luke
[1:32:09] chapter 14
[1:32:10] he said and accept you can forsake your
[1:32:12] father except you can forsake your
[1:32:13] mother

[1:32:15] your brother and your own life also you
[1:32:18] cannot be my disciple brother brandon
[1:32:21] taught us in the message that you're a
[1:32:22] perfect man
[1:32:23] he said that there's a first step the
[1:32:24] first step is to have faith and be born
[1:32:27] again
[1:32:27] he said this is the problem that we see
[1:32:29] so many who run the race
[1:32:31] and then you look alongside the road and
[1:32:33] you see like you drive down the road you

[1:32:55] look for out for the other man we don't
[1:32:56] bear the burdens of others
[1:32:58] because he said it's an automatic thing
[1:33:00] if the life of christ in you it's an
[1:33:01] automatic thing we don't have the life
[1:33:03] of christ

[1:36:06] it is of the lord's mercies that we
[1:36:09] are not consumed
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:13] it is of the lord's mercies that we are
[1:36:16] not consumed
[1:36:18] because his compassions
[1:36:21] they fail not
[1:36:24] hallelujah said they are new every
[1:36:27] morning

[1:36:36] the lord is my portion saith my soul
[1:36:40] therefore i hope in him
[1:36:44] the lord is good unto them that wait for
[1:36:47] him
[1:36:48] to the soul that seeketh him
[1:36:53] it is good that a man should both hope
[1:36:58] and quietly wait for the salvation of
[1:37:01] the lord for the lord will not cast
[1:37:07] off forever but though he calls
[1:37:11] grief oh sometimes he puts rocks in our
[1:37:14] bed brother what is it
[1:37:16] it's the mercy of god some
[1:37:19] god sometimes god will put you down on
[1:37:21] your back so that you get down on your
[1:37:22] knees
[1:37:24] what is it it's the mercy of god
[1:37:27] sometimes god will cause you to lose
[1:37:28] your job
[1:37:29] so you'll run to the one who's the
[1:37:31] provider
[1:37:33] he'll get you sick he'll allow you to
[1:37:35] get sick so you'll run to the healer
[1:37:38] and sometimes he'll cause everything
[1:37:42] to fall apart
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:45] so that you realize you can do nothing
[1:37:48] without him
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:54] we must humble ourselves but abraham
[1:37:57] said this is how you overcome
[1:37:59] by the word of god humility
[1:38:05] this is how we overcome we said lord i
[1:38:08] am nothing
[1:38:11] isaiah you saw the great king uzziah
[1:38:13] lifted up
[1:38:14] on his throne but then he died
[1:38:18] god had to take him out of the way to
[1:38:21] where everything that he had put his
[1:38:22] hope in come crashing down
[1:38:24] oh we've put our we put our sights on
[1:38:27] this one or that one and god has
[1:38:29] we've seen like like we've seen a little

[1:38:40] seen people that we thought brother
[1:38:41] brandon said the kernel
[1:38:42] of sincerity but they're not the colonel
[1:38:44] anymore

[1:39:24] mercies

[1:40:12] out and come back to the altar
[1:40:16] brother we've been taught these things

[1:40:38] time to get
[1:40:39] back in the race tonight oh my john
[1:40:42] chapter one verse john he says
[1:40:44] he said if you confess your sins he is
[1:40:46] faithful
[1:40:47] and just to forgive you your sins and
[1:40:50] cleanse you
[1:40:51] from all unrighteousness he said we have
[1:40:54] an advocate
[1:40:55] a high priest oh praise be to god
[1:40:59] he's a faithful high priest he's touched
[1:41:03] by your feeling this morning i wonder
[1:41:06] you're going through a trouble you're
[1:41:08] going through trial
[1:41:09] it touches it touches god
[1:41:13] would you have faith to stand on your
[1:41:16] feet
[1:41:16] and say lord god whatever i'm going
[1:41:18] through i'm going to stand on my feet
[1:41:19] and i'm going to look to calvary that
[1:41:21] paid for it this morning i'm going to
[1:41:23] look to calvary that paid for my
[1:41:24] encouragement and paid for my strength
[1:41:26] that paid for
[1:41:27] everything i have need of and you'd
[1:41:29] stand on your feet as a symbolism that
[1:41:31] you're gonna dump
[1:41:32] out those burdens brother you're not
[1:41:34] gonna carry that no more
[1:41:35] you're gonna leave this place this
[1:41:37] morning free of that burden
[1:41:39] free of that care oh just take that
[1:41:43] little
[1:41:44] cup and dump it upside down and say lord
[1:41:46] take it from me
[1:41:48] he said cast your gears on me he said i
[1:41:50] care for you
[1:41:51] oh brother he he cornered in the song
[1:41:53] service this morning
[1:41:54] he had me listening to it on the way
[1:41:56] down here and now we've preached it
[1:41:57] again
[1:41:58] that's three witnesses that god cares
[1:42:01] but do you care
[1:42:17] [Music]
[1:42:26] foreign i
[1:42:28] am the lord i speak to thee this morning
[1:42:32] i have given my witness my word is true
[1:42:35] three places have i told me now i care
[1:42:39] for thee i care for thee will thou cast
[1:42:42] thy cares upon me now
[1:42:44] and i will prove to thee that i care
[1:42:48] and i will show you i will make a way
[1:42:51] hallelujah thus saith the lord
[1:42:54] you say god can't speak god can speak he
[1:42:56] can speak through prophecy he can
[1:42:58] speak through his word but let me tell
[1:43:00] you something this morning god is here
[1:43:03] he cares for you brother sister
[1:43:06] you say oh
[1:43:10] lord i can see now
[1:43:14] i can see that you care for me lord
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:18] you know jesus prayed for blind men one
[1:43:20] day and he said lord i can see
[1:43:23] i see ministries walking jesus prayed
[1:43:25] for him again
[1:43:26] and when he prayed for him again he
[1:43:28] could see clearly
[1:43:30] that's what the problem is sometimes we
[1:43:32] come into church we get a little touch
[1:43:33] from god
[1:43:34] we get a little something and we think
[1:43:36] that's it but brother sister we
[1:43:38] need to lay it all down at the feet of
[1:43:39] jesus that we can see clearly
[1:43:43] there's a place where you can walk that
[1:43:45] you're free
[1:43:46] in the spirit of god
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:51] is there someone this morning you're
[1:43:53] saying lord
[1:43:55] i just want to be free if two or three
[1:43:59] agree as touching anything the bible
[1:44:03] says we can have what we ask
[1:44:06] if you're willing and you care this
[1:44:08] morning i'm gonna challenge you
[1:44:10] to take the promise of god and say
[1:44:12] brother let's agree
[1:44:13] let's pray together is there someone
[1:44:15] they said no don't lay hands on me
[1:44:17] the bible said lay hands on the sick and
[1:44:19] they shall recover

[1:44:23] sick in body
[1:44:25] just invite you now if you want prayer

[1:44:52] flesh body this morning he would say
[1:44:54] brother this brother sister this your
[1:44:56] name is this your name is that i care
[1:44:57] for you

[1:45:09] then don't come forward but cast your
[1:45:11] cares on christ

[1:45:15] answering god
[1:45:16] i believe there's somebody in this
[1:45:18] church that's been praying
[1:45:20] somebody's been praying because the
[1:45:21] bible says he hears the cries of the
[1:45:24] righteous

[1:45:30] to your cry

[1:45:51] had this brother preaching like noah

[1:45:55] brother here he's had him preaching
[1:45:57] that god sent many gifts he's sent many
[1:45:59] he sent many opportunities and here's
[1:46:01] another opportunity this morning
[1:46:04] will we take advantage of god's
[1:46:06] opportunity this morning
[1:46:08] paul told timothy said don't lose the
[1:46:10] urgency we may not have another
