[36:19] home lord we just ask that your full
[36:22] uh physician ability would come down and
[36:24] touch their body lord
[36:26] we just want to tell you we love you and
[36:27] appreciate and dedicate the remainder of
[36:28] the service into your hands
[36:30] in christ's name amen if you would turn
[36:32] in your
[36:33] bibles to revelations chapter 3
[36:37] remember to hold up those that are sick
[36:40] i found out this past week just through
[36:42] annual blood work that
[36:44] that i had had coveted so we're clear of
[36:47] it now so
[36:48] the antibodies are are in the system so
[36:50] hopefully we'll be able to fight it off
[36:52] next time
[36:53] but it's it's a bad little it's a bad
[36:55] little virus
[36:57] if you haven't had it i hope you don't
[36:58] get it if you do get it
[37:01] i i hope that i hope it don't hit you as
[37:05] hard as it
[37:06] does some i know one of the side effects
[37:08] that i seem to be
[37:10] or the symptoms that i seem to still be
[37:12] holding on to is shaking
[37:13] and so i talked to the doctor about that
[37:14] it's just like i mean just my hands
[37:16] shake it's not that i'm
[37:17] i mean i am nervous but i'm not that
[37:19] nervous and uh
[37:20] you know so my legs they just quiver and
[37:24] so they said it two months or two weeks
[37:26] to two months it can linger on like that
[37:28] so
[37:29] uh pray for each other pray for those
[37:31] that have it and trust that they get
[37:32] over it soon
[37:34] i want to look at the more this morning
[37:36] on the subject the overcomer
[37:39] and brother brown was speaking about the
[37:41] overcomer he was speaking about someone
[37:44] he said who was living in revival
[37:47] he said we should never let the spirit
[37:49] of revival
[37:50] die we've got to keep in revival
[37:54] constantly revived every day paul says
[37:57] we have to die
[37:58] daily that christ so the christ could
[38:00] live
[38:01] and that we must never let that revival
[38:03] die
[38:04] within us revelations chapter 3
[38:08] verse 20 for our scripture reading
[38:13] behold i stand at the door and knock
[38:16] if any man hear my voice and open the
[38:18] door
[38:19] i will come into him and what's up with
[38:21] him and he with me
[38:23] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[38:25] sit with me
[38:26] in my throne even as i also overcame
[38:29] and am sat down with my father in his
[38:32] throne he that hath an ear led him here
[38:34] with the spirit saith unto the churches
[38:36] you can have your seats this morning god
[38:38] bless you my lord has blessed us to the
[38:39] reading of the word
[38:40] and we look at the word overcomer and we
[38:43] see with the word overcomer it says it
[38:45] is a person
[38:46] who overcomes something one who succeeds
[38:49] in dealing with or gaining control of
[38:52] some
[38:53] problem or difficulty another word you
[38:56] can look at for overcomer is someone who
[38:58] conquers
[38:59] someone who defeats someone who
[39:01] overthrows
[39:03] reduces or subdues and vanquishes their
[39:05] enemy so
[39:06] we as believers we have to find
[39:08] ourselves in that place that we
[39:10] are overcomers we have to be able to
[39:12] identify ourselves as
[39:14] an overcomer uh we're looking at this
[39:17] brother brandon said when you look at
[39:18] the scripture reading
[39:19] it says did you ever notice it says he
[39:21] sat with me in my throne
[39:24] not on my throne but in my throne he
[39:27] said that is his
[39:28] domain see christ is the ruler
[39:32] the complete domain of god he said so
[39:35] the bride will be
[39:36] with him in his throne in the
[39:40] entire domain not on my throne but in my
[39:43] throne
[39:44] where is his domain reaches he said a
[39:47] throne is over a domain
[39:48] and the domain reaches just as far as
[39:51] the boundaries does
[39:52] and this is from eternity to eternity so
[39:55] brothers and sisters
[39:56] we see that the bride of jesus christ
[39:59] and christ himself are becoming so close
[40:01] together
[40:02] that they're not sitting on the throne
[40:04] again they're together
[40:05] on that throne he said he's not in that
[40:07] throne but they're on that throne
[40:08] together
[40:09] so they're so close so equal that
[40:12] anything i want you to know that
[40:13] anything that god
[40:15] has overcome you can overcome do you
[40:18] think about it that way
[40:19] i was just reading a story just the
[40:21] other day i was looking at some
[40:22] some quotes and some thoughts for a
[40:24] future message there
[40:26] and it come to me and brother brandon
[40:27] was talking about the bride
[40:29] of jesus christ and christ and he was
[40:31] talking about
[40:32] he said i have conducted marriages
[40:35] before
[40:36] and he said when i conducted those
[40:37] marriages he said i i see that man
[40:40] and that woman and they come there and
[40:42] they begin to take their vows
[40:43] and he said when they take their vows
[40:45] it's just like christ
[40:46] and the bride their hearts start to beat
[40:49] as
[40:50] one our hearts have to beat
[40:54] as one listen to what he says
[40:57] we're here this morning we're here to
[40:59] see where our shortcomings are
[41:01] if we're going to overcome anything we
[41:03] kind of have to know what we have to
[41:04] overcome right
[41:05] so he says we have to see where our
[41:07] shortcomings are how can we get from
[41:09] where we are today
[41:10] to where we ought to be how many wants
[41:13] to be better than tomorrow than you are
[41:15] today
[41:16] we all want to be in a place that we say
[41:18] god i want to grow in you i want to
[41:20] develop in you i want to be closer to
[41:21] you
[41:22] i want a relationship just like that
[41:24] marriage is that our
[41:25] our hearts beat as one
[41:30] he says overcoming
[41:34] you've got to overcome something
[41:37] and he's talking about the laotia church
[41:39] age
[41:40] so let's look at this for just a few
[41:42] minutes we're going to get into some
[41:43] characters here in a minute
[41:44] but just to lay a foundation the
[41:46] laodicea
[41:48] he says it had to be rebuked because
[41:50] they were different
[41:51] towards christ he said they had put
[41:54] christ
[41:55] on the outside in their age
[41:58] we see that today we see that christ is
[42:00] on the outside brothers and sisters
[42:02] christ has been put on the outside of
[42:04] the church
[42:04] he's been put on the outside of the
[42:06] christian world he's been put on the
[42:08] outside of society
[42:10] people don't want christ you say well
[42:13] there's a bunch of churches there's a
[42:15] lot of people that claim
[42:16] christianity a form of
[42:19] a form of christianity not all but some
[42:22] have a form of christianity
[42:24] he says but there is christ he's on the
[42:26] outside knocking
[42:28] you heard our scriptures he's knocking
[42:30] on the door trying to get himself back
[42:32] in
[42:32] he does not give up on those people
[42:34] christ is not going to give up on people
[42:36] he keeps knocking and knocking and
[42:37] knocking
[42:38] and the prophet said that is love that's
[42:41] god's love he said after he'd been put
[42:43] out of his own house
[42:45] after he'd been put out of his own house
[42:47] and trying to get back in
[42:48] if they will open the door he'll come
[42:51] back in
[42:54] are you thankful for that this morning
[42:56] how many has ever been in a place to
[42:58] where you feel like you've maybe put
[42:59] christ on the outside of your life
[43:01] and thank god he knocked on the door and
[43:03] he knocked and knocked and knocked until
[43:05] you opened back up and said
[43:06] come back in lord i need you
[43:13] brothers and sisters it couldn't be any
[43:14] clearer in the hour that we're living in
[43:17] when you see the corruption around us
[43:21] you see the corruption that we live in
[43:23] in politics
[43:24] our government in education and in
[43:27] church
[43:28] morals
[43:31] when you look at this we're talking
[43:32] about a battle
[43:34] we go through our day-to-day life we
[43:36] think about mostly us and our family
[43:39] but when you look at it through a big
[43:40] picture through god's eyes
[43:42] when you look at what's going on there
[43:44] is a major battle going on between good
[43:47] and evil there is a spiritual warfare
[43:50] that is going around all around us and
[43:52] satan is trying his best to remove god
[43:54] from anything and everything that he can
[43:57] that's why he hits the political side so
[43:59] much because he knows
[44:01] the countries are founded upon god on
[44:04] the principles of christianity
[44:05] so if he can remove them from the
[44:07] governments he's got a leg up
[44:09] he goes in and he tries to remove them
[44:11] from our from our educational systems
[44:15] they don't teach your kids about god in
[44:16] public school
[44:18] they're not going to they may teach some
[44:20] kind of
[44:21] of homosexuality they may teach
[44:24] transgender
[44:30] well that's the truth anyway when they
[44:32] allow boys who wants to claim that
[44:34] they're girls
[44:35] to go play on soccer teams and
[44:37] basketball teams
[44:39] there's a problem god has been removed
[44:42] from that system
[44:43] and satan is just attacking and
[44:44] attacking and attacking
[44:46] there is a moral decay that's around the
[44:48] churches
[44:51] it don't stop it it don't stop in the
[44:53] government it don't stop in
[44:56] in the educational systems it goes on
[44:58] into the churches
[45:04] homosexual marriages
[45:07] that's a common thing now that is a
[45:10] common thing
[45:15] your vice president my vice president
[45:18] was the what married the first couple in
[45:20] california
[45:23] she performed that marriage of same-sex
[45:25] marriage the first one ever in
[45:26] california
[45:29] government churches people
[45:32] education satan is hammering hammer and
[45:34] hammer and trying to get to that
[45:36] and the people are so blind to it
[45:40] we've got to be careful we've got to be
[45:43] careful with what we do with our lives
[45:45] because the the satan has used such a
[45:48] foundation of technology
[45:53] everybody got a phone everybody can
[45:55] probably get on social media if they
[45:57] want to
[45:58] you can get on a different website you
[46:01] can browse whatever
[46:02] we used to think 20 years ago 40 years
[46:04] ago that the television
[46:06] was a television that is a toothache
[46:09] compared to what we have today
[46:11] the television is a two thing it was
[46:13] just a precursor of what was to come
[46:15] now we see technology coming in and
[46:17] hitting and hammering and hammering and
[46:18] hammering and hammering
[46:20] at people you think well it's just
[46:22] innocent
[46:23] is it because the technology world
[46:26] i'm kind of getting off on this but the
[46:28] technology world is controlled by people
[46:31] those people are controlled by something
[46:33] it's a spirit
[46:34] it's either a christian spirit or it's
[46:36] an evil spirit and if you control
[46:38] what goes out among the amongst the
[46:40] people
[46:42] they're being led by something so what
[46:44] are they saying what are they engraving
[46:46] what kind of ads are being promoted at
[46:48] us and our children
[46:58] he's like man how do we do it how do we
[47:01] overcome
[47:02] how do we overcome when everything is
[47:04] being put against us
[47:06] how do we overcome when satan is
[47:07] constantly we're in this battle
[47:10] you don't even realize sometimes you're
[47:12] in a battle
[47:13] but brothers and sisters there will be a
[47:15] little group of people
[47:17] a little small group of people as small
[47:20] as it may be just a few
[47:22] just a handful they won't succumb to
[47:25] satan
[47:25] they won't succumb to the things that
[47:27] he's coming they will be mighty in
[47:29] spirit
[47:30] they will be mighty in spirit in such a
[47:33] way that they will overcome the enemy of
[47:35] this evil age
[47:42] so brother brown was talking about
[47:43] laodicea we're living there
[47:46] and he's talking about leo odyssey and
[47:48] he says she has this rebuke coming to
[47:50] her
[47:52] she needs a sharp rebuke from god
[47:57] so where is she going to get this rebuke
[48:01] well it should start right here
[48:05] but listen to what happened in the world
[48:07] this is what brother brown said now
[48:09] he's talking about the church world
[48:12] when our clergy gets so soft and dirty
[48:19] now
[48:21] you know how i feel about uh about uh
[48:24] the politics and so forth some
[48:26] somewhat you know we talked last time
[48:28] i'm a patriot i i love our country i
[48:30] want to see our country do good
[48:32] and you know we want to see it do good
[48:34] in such a way
[48:35] and i tell you during the whole election
[48:36] process i told my wife and i'll confess
[48:39] right here
[48:39] i said i think the churches have failed
[48:42] the government
[48:44] because men will stand up and say what
[48:47] should be said from a political way
[48:49] they don't stand up and say there
[48:50] shouldn't be homosexuality
[48:54] there shouldn't be same-sex marriages
[48:56] there shouldn't be those things going on
[48:58] there shouldn't a child should not be
[49:00] able at the age of four or five
[49:02] to tell his parents i want to be a girl
[49:06] that's not that's not thinking
[49:09] that's not right
[49:11] [Music]
[49:12] but the doty soft clergy
[49:16] he said they think that they're they
[49:17] treat them like it's a grandfather to
[49:19] their grandchildren
[49:20] and everything that the kids do is
[49:23] perfect
[49:25] that's why you don't have no sin that's
[49:27] why there's no
[49:28] wrong because they have taken god and
[49:31] put him in such a way that he's such a
[49:32] good god
[49:34] that you can do no wrong
[49:39] they make a big dirty grandfather he
[49:40] says but he's not
[49:45] he is a father and a father of
[49:48] righteousness
[49:49] and correction and he says his love is
[49:52] always corrective
[49:53] no matter how bad it hurts it's still
[49:57] correct
[49:59] we can't take this and start tearing
[50:02] pages out that we don't like
[50:04] we can't take this and start adding
[50:06] pages to make it say something that it
[50:08] don't say
[50:09] we have to stay right with what the word
[50:11] has been
[50:12] for years you cannot change god
[50:15] he don't change but the world has tried
[50:17] to take it and say well
[50:18] this don't mean this about a woman
[50:22] this doesn't mean that a woman can't
[50:23] preach
[50:25] well i'm gonna get with hit with this
[50:26] one is this online i hope it's not
[50:36] but a real mother and a real dad
[50:40] will correct their children when you
[50:42] don't get correction at home
[50:44] if none of you ever corrected your kids
[50:46] it would be so loud in here right now
[50:48] you wouldn't be able to stand it
[50:49] we would have a little it would be like
[50:50] renegades running around everywhere and
[50:52] that's what's happened in the church
[50:53] world
[50:54] they don't get correction from the
[50:55] pulpit so they're allowed to do whatever
[50:58] they want to do and it continues to get
[50:59] worse
[51:00] and worse and worse and worse until we
[51:02] see this age we're living in and we
[51:04] think my goodness
[51:06] my goodness how do we even how do we
[51:07] even get out in the world
[51:13] brother branham's talking he said i was
[51:16] crossing an old log the other day
[51:18] down a wash we call it a holler
[51:21] and he says i jumped up on this log on
[51:24] the outside it looked good
[51:27] it was a big old beach log he said i
[51:29] jumped up on it
[51:30] but a great big chunk fell off of it it
[51:33] was real
[51:34] rotten and doty he said that is the way
[51:37] that christians
[51:38] are becoming they've been dead in sin
[51:41] and trespasses so long
[51:44] to their doty they don't even realize
[51:48] that the sins and the trespasses and the
[51:49] things that they're going through
[51:51] is making them weak and doughy and
[51:54] rotten
[51:55] they've been come to a place that they
[51:56] just continue to go on that way and they
[51:58] don't even realize it
[51:59] he said they can hold they can't hold
[52:01] any weight
[52:03] he said they don't know what overcoming
[52:05] means
[52:08] so how do we overcome he says listen
[52:11] this is good
[52:11] he says at the beginning of the text he
[52:14] says overcome
[52:16] means to keep life in you
[52:20] keep life in you so this big tree that
[52:23] once stood mighty up in the forest has
[52:25] now fallen across
[52:26] into this holler and he said the water
[52:28] run over it and it began to run over and
[52:30] over and over
[52:30] and it made it dirty and rotten what
[52:32] happened what made that tree rot
[52:34] it lost its roots in the ground it lost
[52:37] its position
[52:38] in life and the life came out of it so
[52:41] we have to be able to keep the life of
[52:43] christ in us
[52:45] we have to live in such a way pray more
[52:47] read more give more to god
[52:49] expect more from god and give more to
[52:51] god
[52:52] keep that life burning on the inside he
[52:56] says you take a christian
[52:57] that's supposed to be a christian you
[52:59] let the life of god
[53:00] go from him the experience
[53:03] and the joy of serving christ
[53:06] and he said that living church where is
[53:08] such a going he said it will
[53:10] rot twice as quick
[53:15] it will rot twice as quick when you let
[53:19] the experience go
[53:21] or the joy of serving christ
[53:24] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[53:28] why is that god god gives us those kind
[53:30] of messages so that we can hold on to
[53:32] something
[53:33] we need the life of christ in us we need
[53:36] that union
[53:38] the hearts beating as one it's got to be
[53:40] there
[53:50] listen to this i hate to read quotes but
[53:53] this this
[53:53] this was just so good as i followed
[53:56] through this message
[53:56] it was so good he said if we're trying
[53:59] to follow the message of the hour
[54:02] we should live constantly in the life of
[54:04] christ
[54:05] because if it don't you lay around
[54:10] and the things that you're supposed to
[54:12] do and don't do it
[54:14] the bible says he that knoweth to do
[54:15] good and doeth it not to him
[54:17] it's sin he said then you become doty
[54:20] and
[54:20] rotten when you're separated from the
[54:23] life of god
[54:24] so strive with all that's in you
[54:28] strive with all that's in you to stay
[54:31] in the life of christ that you be
[54:35] fruit bearing it's not good enough that
[54:38] you're just a christian
[54:40] it's not good enough that you just go
[54:41] through life and you you've claimed god
[54:43] you claim christianity you've been saved
[54:45] you've been baptized
[54:46] and you're living for christ but god
[54:48] wants to see some fruit from us
[54:50] the overcomers will bear fruit
[55:00] this lay ought to see a church age he
[55:02] says it's the grandest of all church
[55:04] ages and he chose us
[55:07] he chose us in the grandest of all
[55:09] church ages
[55:11] because it's the ending of time and the
[55:12] blending of eternity
[55:14] now when you're talking about blending
[55:16] something those two have to be pretty
[55:18] close
[55:19] so if you're going to be an eternal
[55:20] being and you're going to blend on into
[55:22] eternity
[55:23] you better be doing eternal things now
[55:26] getting yourself ready he says blending
[55:28] in of eternity
[55:29] and he says and then it's the greatest
[55:33] sinful age
[55:37] it's more sin in this age than there's
[55:40] ever been
[55:41] the powers of satan is many times
[55:45] harder to fight against than it was in
[55:48] any
[55:48] other age the powers of satan
[55:53] are harder to fight in this age than any
[55:56] other age
[55:57] that we've lived in you think about this
[56:02] brothers and sisters preachers have
[56:04] preached this message
[56:06] since the prophet was on the left scene
[56:09] right
[56:09] you've heard these quotes your whole
[56:11] life a lot of us
[56:12] right and you've heard these quotes
[56:16] and you believed them all along but if
[56:18] you think about it now
[56:20] these quotes are more than just thoughts
[56:22] they're more than just words that you're
[56:23] hearing
[56:24] now you can feel these quotes
[56:27] you go out into the world and you begin
[56:30] to feel
[56:30] these quotes physically mentally
[56:34] you can feel the corruption of the
[56:37] people around
[56:39] and i hate to be it sounds ugly and i
[56:40] don't mean it that way but you go out
[56:42] into the world and you begin to hear
[56:44] the vulgarity that people people smell
[56:47] and you begin to feel and you can just
[56:49] oh you carry it
[56:50] you can feel it's almost like you can
[56:52] feel demons brushing against you
[56:54] they're more than just quotes on a paper
[56:56] it is a time and an
[56:58] age that we're living in
[57:02] how did god trust us for that
[57:05] why do you ever think about it why did
[57:07] he choose me
[57:09] to live in this age why did he choose me
[57:12] to be a person
[57:13] that can they can overcome the wiles of
[57:15] the devil they can go out into the
[57:17] into the into the world and go out there
[57:19] and brush shoulders with these things
[57:20] and overcome it because a lot of people
[57:24] can't do it
[57:25] a lot of people can't overcome the
[57:27] temptations
[57:29] but he chose you
[57:33] he says back there in the early ages a
[57:36] christian
[57:37] for his profession of in a church
[57:39] belonging to christ would be
[57:41] beheaded for it he'd be killed he'd be
[57:44] put out of his misery
[57:46] and go to meet god quickly
[57:50] but now we're in an enduring process
[57:53] nobody's going to behead you
[57:56] it's not going to happen i don't think
[57:59] nobody's going to come after you because
[58:00] of what you believe
[58:02] they may throw darts at you they may
[58:04] throw stones at you
[58:06] figuratively speaking but nobody's going
[58:08] to come after you
[58:09] you're not going to be put out this
[58:11] quickly
[58:13] you're going to endure to the very end
[58:15] you are going to have to endure
[58:17] and overcome satan and all of his
[58:19] trickery
[58:20] up until the blending of time until
[58:23] eternity
[58:25] how are we going to do that how are we
[58:28] going to do that
[58:29] this is the age he says of a personal
[58:32] life
[58:32] of christ and he goes there talking
[58:35] about how the chemical of his body
[58:42] when you think about the holy ghost and
[58:44] what the holy ghost is
[58:46] when you think about what it means to
[58:48] have the holy ghost brothers and sisters
[58:50] when you look at that
[58:50] and you see that there was justification
[58:53] there was sanctification
[58:54] and then now there's baptism of the holy
[58:56] ghost what happens is
[58:57] that everything that god was as
[59:00] everything he will ever be is he took
[59:03] and he
[59:04] poured that all right down into you that
[59:06] day you said god
[59:07] fill me with the holy ghost
[59:10] there's your overcoming there's your
[59:12] overcoming right there
[59:14] that's how we're going to do it god has
[59:16] overcomers he has had overcomers in
[59:18] every age
[59:23] he said in every time every age there's
[59:24] been on earth god has always had
[59:26] somebody
[59:27] that he could put his hands on
[59:32] so let me put my hands on you you're an
[59:34] overcomer
[59:35] he said somebody that he could put his
[59:37] hands on as a witness
[59:39] on the earth because he's never been
[59:42] without
[59:42] a witness he said man how do i know we
[59:45] hadn't missed it because we're still
[59:47] witnessing
[59:48] we're still here we're still witnessing
[59:50] wanting more and more of god we're still
[59:52] walking through this
[59:53] and wanting more of god
[59:59] the bible says he that believeth on me
[1:00:02] has everlasting life
[1:00:04] and shall not come into condemnation or
[1:00:06] the judgment but has passed from death
[1:00:08] unto life do you believe
[1:00:13] you see where you're starting to
[1:00:14] identify do you see how you begin to
[1:00:16] identify as an overcomer
[1:00:18] it's all in the scriptures
[1:00:23] let's look at a few overcomers
[1:00:27] in noah's time
[1:00:31] we look at noah and we look at this
[1:00:33] andaluvian world
[1:00:34] that the prophet talks about and he said
[1:00:37] there was perhaps
[1:00:38] millions of people millions of people
[1:00:42] but there was eight overcomers
[1:00:46] do some do some math millions of people
[1:00:50] but eight overcomers there was eight
[1:00:54] real genuine overcomers
[1:00:58] he said that was uh noah's sons their
[1:01:01] wives and noah and his wife
[1:01:03] eight overcame eight entered the ark at
[1:01:06] the appropriate time
[1:01:07] how did they do it they listened to the
[1:01:09] word of god
[1:01:13] simple it's real simple
[1:01:16] it's simple to be an overcomer if you
[1:01:17] just do what god says
[1:01:19] listen to what i have to say he said
[1:01:21] they wasn't called on the outside of the
[1:01:22] door
[1:01:23] they wasn't calling the outside door
[1:01:25] they were on the inside
[1:01:27] but there was millions millions there
[1:01:30] that had good intentions they had good
[1:01:33] intentions they said oh maybe someday
[1:01:36] if this happens or that happens then
[1:01:38] i'll go up there and i'll see brother
[1:01:39] noah because he's a fine fella
[1:01:41] he said but there was only eight on the
[1:01:43] inside
[1:01:48] 120 years 120 years
[1:01:54] the echoes of warnings across the land
[1:01:57] think about it 120 years constantly the
[1:02:00] warnings echoed over and over and over
[1:02:02] but it wasn't taken seriously they
[1:02:05] didn't take the warning seriously
[1:02:07] they played it off as an unbelievable
[1:02:09] event
[1:02:12] an unbelievable event now
[1:02:15] now i'm talking to believers i'm talking
[1:02:17] to overcomers
[1:02:19] but you think about this how easy it
[1:02:21] would be
[1:02:22] to play this off as an unbelievable
[1:02:25] event
[1:02:26] he's building a ship up on top of a
[1:02:30] mountain
[1:02:30] that's never seen rain and he's telling
[1:02:34] them that this ship is going to float
[1:02:36] in the water and it's the only refuge
[1:02:38] now
[1:02:39] think about that now let me tell you
[1:02:42] something else
[1:02:48] me tell you another story
[1:02:51] god is going to come down from heaven
[1:02:55] and catch away a group of people
[1:02:59] and the twinkling in the moment in the
[1:03:01] twinkling of an eye
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:03] now to us that sounds good i'm ready
[1:03:08] but to the world that is an
[1:03:11] unbelievable event they can't even
[1:03:13] imagine they can't
[1:03:14] fathom the thought of that happening
[1:03:17] that's the same thing that happened back
[1:03:18] during the andalusian destruction
[1:03:21] they needed to be sealed in with god and
[1:03:23] they wasn't
[1:03:24] brothers and sisters we're in a ceiling
[1:03:26] time we have to be sealed the holy ghost
[1:03:29] find ourselves in a place that nothing
[1:03:31] sounds unbelievable because god is still
[1:03:33] a miracle-working god
[1:03:35] god is still an overcomer god is still
[1:03:38] doing things that he done
[1:03:39] years and years ago
[1:03:43] i was reading i was reading about
[1:03:46] i like to look up songs and things in
[1:03:48] the history of songs and different
[1:03:50] different things church songs i like to
[1:03:51] know where they come from
[1:03:53] and you know we sing the anthem amazing
[1:03:55] grace over and over
[1:03:58] it's the anthem of christianity around
[1:04:00] the world
[1:04:01] it was written by john newton in 1772
[1:04:07] 1772 and he's out there on a slave
[1:04:11] trip ship i should say he's a slave
[1:04:13] trader
[1:04:14] and he's out there and he begins to he's
[1:04:16] beginning to search for god
[1:04:18] well during the search of god here comes
[1:04:20] this storm that comes upon
[1:04:22] the ship and the ship begins to get
[1:04:23] battered and battered and battered and
[1:04:25] it begins to take on water
[1:04:27] and they're out in the middle of the sea
[1:04:28] 1772
[1:04:30] they didn't have technology it was life
[1:04:32] or death
[1:04:33] and he begins to fall down his age and
[1:04:35] he prays to god
[1:04:36] because something god can you save us
[1:04:38] and this the story
[1:04:40] goes that when he began to pray the
[1:04:42] cargo
[1:04:43] and the ship shifted directions and
[1:04:46] sealed
[1:04:46] where the ship was busted
[1:04:50] that's a miracle that's a miracle
[1:04:52] working god and god can still
[1:04:54] do that today for us don't ever
[1:04:57] underestimate or unbelieve what god can
[1:04:59] do for us
[1:05:05] he said brother branham how do i know
[1:05:08] i'm in there
[1:05:10] you wanna know how you know you're in
[1:05:11] there how do you know in your heart that
[1:05:14] you are the believer
[1:05:15] how do you know you're the bride of
[1:05:16] christ how do you know that you're the
[1:05:18] overcomer
[1:05:19] how do i know i'm sealed in that ark
[1:05:24] he said just watch the kind of life
[1:05:27] you're living look around
[1:05:31] just see if it's just lived out of you
[1:05:34] automatically
[1:05:37] he said or do you have to strain and
[1:05:40] pull
[1:05:41] and see what you're doing he says but
[1:05:43] don't do that
[1:05:44] did you ever try it don't he says just
[1:05:47] look at your life and see
[1:05:48] is is the life of christ living out of
[1:05:50] me automatically
[1:05:52] are the words that i speak on a daily
[1:05:54] basis are they pleasing to the ears of
[1:05:56] god
[1:05:57] we can all ask that question we get
[1:05:59] called up around you know in
[1:06:01] conversations and sometimes maybe we say
[1:06:02] things
[1:06:03] off the cuff and things we shouldn't
[1:06:04] have i'm probably the biggest one
[1:06:06] that i know of that can put my foot in
[1:06:08] my mouth quicker than anybody
[1:06:11] trying to say something that maybe is
[1:06:13] just a little cute or a little funny
[1:06:14] but then you realize maybe i shouldn't
[1:06:16] have said that
[1:06:18] maybe i shouldn't have said that they
[1:06:19] could have hurt somebody's feelings
[1:06:21] and i don't want to do that i don't want
[1:06:22] to portray that but he says just
[1:06:24] automatically see if it's living
[1:06:26] automatically of you
[1:06:30] he tells the story you know the story he
[1:06:32] tells about the baby
[1:06:33] and trying to put the baby's arm in the
[1:06:35] sleeve hole
[1:06:36] he said you can try to put that baby's
[1:06:38] arm in the sleeve hole he said he's
[1:06:40] up and down he's over here he's
[1:06:41] everything he can't do it he says put
[1:06:43] your coat on honey
[1:06:45] he says he can't do it his little arms
[1:06:46] is up and down and around and it takes a
[1:06:48] steady hand
[1:06:51] he says oh i'm glad that i can just
[1:06:54] yield my hand to the father
[1:06:56] the lord jesus christ and can get in
[1:06:58] there you help me
[1:07:00] you put the coat on me i'll quit
[1:07:03] trying and let you do it
[1:07:06] if that little baby keeps trying he says
[1:07:09] oh i can do it
[1:07:10] i can do it you sing a little kids i can
[1:07:12] do it mama i can do it he said he's just
[1:07:14] everywhere because he can't do it
[1:07:17] neither can you
[1:07:19] or i neither can you or i but if we just
[1:07:22] hold still and let him do it
[1:07:24] yield to him here lord here i am just
[1:07:28] let me be nothing
[1:07:29] i yield put my hand in the right place
[1:07:34] he says that's the victory that's your
[1:07:36] overcoming brothers and sisters how many
[1:07:38] here today would say lord
[1:07:39] put me in the right place today put my
[1:07:42] family in the right place today
[1:07:43] put my children in the right place today
[1:07:46] let our young people find the right
[1:07:47] partner in life
[1:07:48] let them live a right kind of marriage
[1:07:51] we need god
[1:07:52] to put us in the right place
[1:08:02] the thing you have to do is overcome
[1:08:05] yourself
[1:08:07] your idea and surrender yourself
[1:08:10] he overcome for you he knows the way we
[1:08:13] don't
[1:08:18] let's look at daniel for a minute
[1:08:22] talking about the days of daniel
[1:08:26] in noah's age there was eight
[1:08:29] in daniel's day there was four
[1:08:34] that's a little bit that makes you think
[1:08:37] a little bit doesn't it
[1:08:39] i'm glad we got millions and millions of
[1:08:41] people in the world today
[1:08:44] that makes us look a little better
[1:08:48] here's daniel
[1:08:52] another reason another way that you know
[1:08:54] you're an um
[1:08:55] that you know that you're a believer and
[1:08:57] that you know that you are an
[1:08:58] overcomer is you're going to be tested
[1:09:03] how many has ever been tested how many
[1:09:06] has ever been put through the trial
[1:09:07] and you think my when is this going to
[1:09:09] stop you've been put through the test
[1:09:12] he that cometh to god must be tested
[1:09:16] the prophet said that is a true sign of
[1:09:18] a child of god when he's tested
[1:09:20] when he's tested it's the greatest thing
[1:09:22] that's ever happened to you
[1:09:27] how many of you has ever said i just had
[1:09:29] the greatest thing ever happened to me
[1:09:31] today
[1:09:33] the greatest thing has happened to me
[1:09:34] today i i lost my job
[1:09:39] i run over nails and flattened all my
[1:09:41] tires
[1:09:44] run out of gas in the furnace it's going
[1:09:47] to be 20 what
[1:09:48] zero tonight maybe i just had the
[1:09:51] greatest thing happen to me
[1:09:53] you won't believe it now
[1:09:56] we don't look at it that way when we're
[1:09:57] going through it we don't look at the
[1:09:59] trials
[1:10:00] and the test as the greatest thing as
[1:10:03] precious as gold as the bible says i
[1:10:05] think peter said is this your trousers
[1:10:07] are as precious as gold
[1:10:09] we don't look at it that way when we're
[1:10:11] going through it
[1:10:12] but we will be tested and we will be
[1:10:14] tried here was daniel
[1:10:16] a prophet of god a man of god
[1:10:22] and he's sitting here and they look at
[1:10:24] daniel and they put him
[1:10:27] in a trap here's daniel
[1:10:30] he's in captivity and he's sitting here
[1:10:33] in captivity
[1:10:34] and he's been praying to god daily daily
[1:10:37] daily
[1:10:37] and somebody comes and says king darius
[1:10:40] we think you need to put a prohibition
[1:10:43] on uh praying to god
[1:10:47] we've got to stop daniel from seeking
[1:10:49] out his god
[1:10:50] because when he talks to god things
[1:10:52] happen for him
[1:10:53] and we need to stop it so for 30 days
[1:10:57] darius i think you need to just
[1:10:59] completely
[1:11:00] let there be no prayer to any gods
[1:11:03] outside of us and darius kind of like
[1:11:07] daniel
[1:11:08] but he was caught he had to do what the
[1:11:11] people said so he says okay for 30 days
[1:11:14] nobody prays nobody can turn towards the
[1:11:16] temple and get on their knees
[1:11:18] and pray to god
[1:11:23] so what does daniel do what's daniel
[1:11:27] going to do with this challenge
[1:11:29] so here's daniel in a trap
[1:11:32] never missed a day of praying in his
[1:11:33] life but knows if he goes to pray
[1:11:36] he'll be thrown right into the lines
[1:11:38] then
[1:11:40] death is imminent
[1:11:43] but the prophet said daniel wasn't
[1:11:46] afraid of them spies
[1:11:48] they were sitting there watching and
[1:11:49] waiting ready to pounce on him as soon
[1:11:51] as he prayed the prophet said that
[1:11:52] daniel went and
[1:11:54] threw up those shades he threw back the
[1:11:57] shutters
[1:11:58] and he got down on his knee throwed up
[1:11:59] his hands to god and prayed
[1:12:02] live or die i'm gonna have the victory
[1:12:06] live or die i'm gonna be an overcomer
[1:12:09] live or die they the lions can't eat me
[1:12:14] he stood beside god he knew who he was
[1:12:18] he was victorious and as the story goes
[1:12:20] and i read
[1:12:21] some stuff on it and on the internet
[1:12:23] some ancient writings and stuff
[1:12:25] that daniel was about 70 years old we
[1:12:27] think of him as a young person
[1:12:28] but he was about 70 years old down in
[1:12:31] the lion's den and one writer
[1:12:33] wrote that it was just like a man coming
[1:12:35] home to his dogs
[1:12:37] and they licked and wagged their tails
[1:12:42] and these are ferocious lines and they
[1:12:44] come up to a 70 year old man of god
[1:12:47] and licking him in the face and wagging
[1:12:50] their tails
[1:12:52] that's another one of my believable
[1:12:53] stories
[1:12:55] but it happened because god always sees
[1:12:58] his believers through
[1:12:59] god will always see his overcomers
[1:13:02] through
[1:13:08] shadrach meshach and abednego same thing
[1:13:12] here they're going to be challenged now
[1:13:14] on their faith by the fire
[1:13:19] they didn't fall they were so solid
[1:13:23] and so overcome they said man if the
[1:13:25] lions couldn't eat daniel
[1:13:26] the fire can't burn me so they stood
[1:13:29] there and
[1:13:29] initially they went in there it was
[1:13:31] thrown in there and the fire
[1:13:33] just licked them nothing
[1:13:40] the days of lot that was four
[1:13:43] the days of lot there were three
[1:13:49] you know brother brown said it'd be one
[1:13:50] in a million
[1:13:53] in the days of lot there were three to
[1:13:56] overcome
[1:13:58] lot and his two daughters
[1:14:02] you got two angels coming down into
[1:14:05] gomorrah two angels come down and lost
[1:14:09] sitting at the gates of the city
[1:14:10] and these two angels come down and come
[1:14:12] down they begin to speak to him and they
[1:14:14] warn him
[1:14:15] of what's to come fire is fixing to
[1:14:18] reign upon your city
[1:14:19] you need to get you and your family out
[1:14:21] of here
[1:14:23] so he goes back and he begins to to tell
[1:14:25] the family and he's feeding the
[1:14:26] the two uh the angels and he's feeding
[1:14:30] them in their house of course we know
[1:14:31] what happens the men come and they knock
[1:14:33] on the door and they want the two men
[1:14:36] for perversion they want the two men
[1:14:39] a lot offers them a daughter they this
[1:14:41] all falls apart or falls in place and
[1:14:43] god gets his family and begins to flee
[1:14:45] the city
[1:14:46] and as he's fleeing the city they're
[1:14:48] going out and he
[1:14:50] the angels told them do not look back
[1:14:53] do not go back to the old ways don't
[1:14:56] look back to your old city
[1:14:58] don't look back to your old job don't
[1:15:00] look back to the old desires of your
[1:15:02] life
[1:15:02] keep pressing on so here's a lot and
[1:15:05] he's pressing on and his two daughters
[1:15:07] are pressing on but here's lot's wife
[1:15:09] you know she's not even named in the
[1:15:10] bible
[1:15:12] not even named in the bible but she's
[1:15:14] walking along and the problem said she
[1:15:16] had desires that she couldn't get rid of
[1:15:19] she had desires that was hanging on to
[1:15:21] her from the world
[1:15:22] and she looked back and just like that
[1:15:26] turned into a pillar of salt
[1:15:32] why was that she started out on the
[1:15:35] right track
[1:15:37] she started out to go to be an overcomer
[1:15:39] she started out to go into a place that
[1:15:41] she could say i'm going on with god
[1:15:44] but in walking the journey she couldn't
[1:15:49] couldn't hold back from looking back at
[1:15:51] the old lifestyle she lived
[1:15:54] prophet actually said she won't go get
[1:15:56] her hair cut
[1:15:58] that's what she wanted to do
[1:16:05] couldn't get rid of the old things of
[1:16:06] the world couldn't overcome
[1:16:10] and the prophet said that satan finally
[1:16:13] overthrowed her
[1:16:18] there's no time to be looking back
[1:16:21] we've all agreed that we're in the most
[1:16:23] corrupt time the most evil age that
[1:16:25] there could possibly be so there's no
[1:16:26] time to be looking back
[1:16:28] it's time to keep our eyes focused on
[1:16:30] calvary to be looking
[1:16:31] to calvary to be looking for the
[1:16:34] unbelievable
[1:16:39] israel started out 2 million strong
[1:16:44] 2 million strong
[1:16:48] there was two we went from eight to four
[1:16:52] to three to two
[1:16:56] we're getting pretty close to that one
[1:16:58] brother jill
[1:17:00] israel started out two million strong
[1:17:04] he said they saw the manifestation of
[1:17:06] the spirit in egypt
[1:17:08] now we we know the children of israel
[1:17:10] and egypt let's think about their story
[1:17:11] for just a minute
[1:17:12] you want to talk about an unbelievable
[1:17:14] story how could they not
[1:17:16] follow on into the promised land after
[1:17:19] all that they had seen
[1:17:20] you think about these these people they
[1:17:22] were the very ones that saw all the
[1:17:24] plays
[1:17:25] they saw moses come in they saw moses do
[1:17:28] all the things that he did they saw the
[1:17:30] plagues happen
[1:17:31] they saw the the token put up on the
[1:17:33] lentils they were the people that put
[1:17:35] the
[1:17:36] put the token on the lentil that was
[1:17:38] those people
[1:17:40] but yet here they come now and they they
[1:17:42] go up to the red sea
[1:17:44] and they see moses speak and park the
[1:17:46] red sea
[1:17:50] think of what they saw think of the
[1:17:54] what they live but yet here they come to
[1:17:56] a place
[1:17:57] that they could not overcome because the
[1:17:59] prophet said it wasn't
[1:18:01] in their heart
[1:18:06] people seen a lot of stuff there's
[1:18:09] people around this message that could
[1:18:10] tell you things they saw
[1:18:13] but it's got to be in your heart it's
[1:18:16] got to be dwelling down
[1:18:17] deep into your heart there was two
[1:18:20] there was joshua and caleb and brother
[1:18:24] brown said when it come down to the
[1:18:25] showdown
[1:18:26] to the obstacles to where they looked
[1:18:29] like grasshoppers
[1:18:31] they said we can do it we're
[1:18:34] more than able we can do it i don't care
[1:18:37] what the enemy looks like
[1:18:38] how big your mountain is today we are
[1:18:41] more than
[1:18:42] able through christ who strengthens me
[1:18:46] that's all they can stand up on was god
[1:18:49] they were overcomers
[1:18:59] brother brown said those men had the
[1:19:00] word of the lord
[1:19:02] and they stayed with it they went over
[1:19:06] not that he that's not he that starts
[1:19:08] but he that finishes
[1:19:14] and you know what brother branham says
[1:19:16] it kind of it's almost like he's
[1:19:19] testing you testing your thoughts
[1:19:21] testing where you're at
[1:19:22] he says you weren't defeated
[1:19:26] none of us in here were born as an
[1:19:29] overcomer
[1:19:30] you're born defeated you're born
[1:19:33] defeated
[1:19:34] you're born into a place that birth
[1:19:36] can't bring you life you may be alive
[1:19:40] but there's no life until christ comes
[1:19:43] into your heart
[1:19:45] you're in a defeated world our world's
[1:19:48] defeated
[1:19:51] you're amongst defeated people this
[1:19:54] world's
[1:19:55] people the people this world are
[1:19:56] defeated he said you're amongst the
[1:19:58] defeated creeds and denominations
[1:20:01] he says you've got to come to victory
[1:20:02] some way
[1:20:05] and then he goes into talking about the
[1:20:07] lily
[1:20:10] and he said there's that little lily
[1:20:11] where did they come from
[1:20:14] when you look out upon that pond and you
[1:20:15] see those beautiful lilies out there
[1:20:17] and you see them they're just as pretty
[1:20:19] as they can be where did that lily come
[1:20:21] from
[1:20:21] he said it came from a little seed down
[1:20:24] at the bottom of that muddy
[1:20:26] murky stagnant
[1:20:29] water he said yet that little seed and
[1:20:32] all the radiance that was
[1:20:34] ever in it that'll ever shine
[1:20:37] was in it right at the bottom of that
[1:20:40] pond
[1:20:41] so there he was he was born in a
[1:20:43] defeated world
[1:20:44] but yet there was a seed inside of you
[1:20:46] that god said one of these days
[1:20:48] this little guy right here is going to
[1:20:49] shine one of these days
[1:20:51] i'm going to put my hands on him and he
[1:20:53] is going to be an overcomer in the last
[1:20:56] day
[1:20:56] one of these days he's going to prove to
[1:20:58] the world that i live
[1:21:01] so here's this little lily down at the
[1:21:03] bottom of this black dirty murky slimy
[1:21:06] pond this is what it was brothers and
[1:21:09] sisters
[1:21:10] we need more of the sun in our life
[1:21:13] so that we can express fully what we are
[1:21:16] we've got to have god to come down in
[1:21:17] our life
[1:21:18] and find out exactly how he can use us
[1:21:22] and and that we can prove ourselves to
[1:21:25] be overcomers
[1:21:29] he said he brought this little seed
[1:21:32] predestinated
[1:21:33] seed he brought it to life and it's
[1:21:35] present itself
[1:21:37] he said that's the over he overcome the
[1:21:39] mud
[1:21:41] he overcome the things of the world and
[1:21:43] now he
[1:21:44] freely gives himself out so ask yourself
[1:21:48] are we freely giving ourselves
[1:21:49] out to god are we freely doing what god
[1:21:52] has called us to do
[1:21:53] are we freely doing everything that he
[1:21:56] wants us to do
[1:21:58] if it is like i said you'll be able to
[1:22:01] see it just
[1:22:02] naturally radiating out of you it won't
[1:22:05] be hard
[1:22:06] it comes easy when that little lily
[1:22:07] sprouted forth and it
[1:22:09] sprung itself open and sprouted itself
[1:22:11] brother branham said there was a certain
[1:22:12] radiance about it
[1:22:14] he said that the little bee come over to
[1:22:15] it and said wow
[1:22:17] that's a pretty perfume
[1:22:20] now do you think that lily smelled like
[1:22:22] that at the bottom of that murky
[1:22:24] salami pond no
[1:22:28] but the life that was within it began to
[1:22:30] come forth brothers and sisters that's
[1:22:32] why it's so important
[1:22:34] that we as believers as overcomers
[1:22:37] it's so important that we have the life
[1:22:39] of christ
[1:22:40] living inside of us that we don't take
[1:22:42] this message lightly
[1:22:44] that we don't take the things of this of
[1:22:46] this the
[1:22:47] words and the quotes and the message and
[1:22:49] the things that god is doing in this
[1:22:50] late hour
[1:22:51] open our eyes
[1:22:54] because we get called up and i'm
[1:22:56] speaking to myself
[1:22:58] we get so caught up with the things
[1:23:00] around us
[1:23:01] that we fail to realize we're a part of
[1:23:04] the finish
[1:23:06] that we are a part of the finished work
[1:23:08] that we're the ones that's going to sit
[1:23:10] over there
[1:23:10] someday we're going to sit side by side
[1:23:13] with joshua
[1:23:14] and caleb you are
[1:23:17] as an overcomer you're going to sit
[1:23:19] there and you're going to ask noah
[1:23:21] how did you do that how did you do that
[1:23:24] for 120 years
[1:23:26] being mocked and ridiculed and laughed
[1:23:28] at and scorned
[1:23:30] and made fun of for 120 years how did
[1:23:32] you do that noah
[1:23:35] he says there was just something inside
[1:23:37] of me something inside of me that just
[1:23:39] made me kept pressing on
[1:23:42] daniel how did you know that those lines
[1:23:44] wasn't going to eat you
[1:23:45] up there was just something inside of me
[1:23:48] there was something inside him there was
[1:23:49] a life on the inside telling me you
[1:23:51] can't be defeated you're an
[1:23:53] overcomer how do you know that
[1:23:58] you're here today
[1:24:06] how many wants to express god in all his
[1:24:09] glory
[1:24:10] like that little lily you want to
[1:24:12] express god and all his glory
[1:24:14] as the musicians come
[1:24:18] i've got a few few scriptures i want to
[1:24:19] read to you
[1:24:21] as an encouragement to you i think
[1:24:23] you'll enjoy these
[1:24:24] because it's speaking about you it's
[1:24:27] speaking about you
[1:24:28] the overcomer it's speaking about the
[1:24:30] believer in the last day
[1:24:32] first john 5 4 says whatsoever for
[1:24:35] whatsoever is born of god
[1:24:37] overcometh the world how many is born of
[1:24:39] god how many have been born again you've
[1:24:41] been saved you've been baptized you're
[1:24:43] filled with the holy ghost
[1:24:44] you can overcome the world you will
[1:24:46] overcome the world
[1:24:48] the scriptures tell us over and over he
[1:24:50] says john 16 33
[1:24:52] these things have spoken unto you that
[1:24:54] in me might have peace
[1:24:56] that in the world you shall have
[1:24:58] tribulation but be
[1:24:59] of good cheer i have overcome
[1:25:03] the world james 1
[1:25:06] 12 blessed is the man that endureth
[1:25:09] temptation
[1:25:10] for if he has tried leave a crown of
[1:25:12] life
[1:25:14] more precious than gold for what the
[1:25:17] lord has promised
[1:25:18] to them that love him romans 8 37
[1:25:21] nay and all these things that we were
[1:25:23] more than conquerors through him
[1:25:24] that loved us does god love you it's
[1:25:27] been proven to me over and over that god
[1:25:29] loves me because he didn't
[1:25:30] he didn't let me go he pulls me back
[1:25:32] into his flock
[1:25:33] he pulls me back in every time i want to
[1:25:35] go a different direction god will turn
[1:25:37] me back
[1:25:40] john 1 5 5 who is he that overcometh the
[1:25:43] world
[1:25:44] but he that believeth that jesus is the
[1:25:46] son of god
[1:25:48] we believe that that's speaking to us
[1:25:52] john 1 4 4 ye are of god little children
[1:25:56] and have overcome them because greater
[1:25:59] is he that is in you than he
[1:26:03] that is in the world let's stand to our
[1:26:06] feet
[1:26:12] i just know i want to be at a place that
[1:26:15] when i come when we come down to the end
[1:26:17] when that moment and the twinkling of an
[1:26:19] eye happens
[1:26:20] and i think about that moment and a
[1:26:22] twinkling of my eye i don't ever want
[1:26:23] there to be moments
[1:26:24] or minutes of doubt in my mind
[1:26:28] i want to know that i have just let god
[1:26:31] live through me in such a way that when
[1:26:33] he comes
[1:26:33] it it's no question we don't need it
[1:26:36] this is not a time of questions in our
[1:26:37] mind
[1:26:38] this is a time to say god i need more of
[1:26:41] you
[1:26:42] i want to be closer to you god i want
[1:26:45] that feeling of the holy ghost i was
[1:26:46] what you have
