[10:46] Psalms 91 if you will let's turn to
[10:49] Psalms 91 for our scripture reading this
[10:51] morning
[11:04] all right
[11:09] he that dwelleth in a secret place of
[11:12] the most high shall abide under the
[11:15] shadow of the Almighty
[11:23] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[11:26] Snare of the Fowler and from the noise
[11:28] of pestilence
[11:40] Thou shalt not be afraid for the tear by
[11:42] night nor for the error arrow that
[11:45] flyeth by day
[11:51] fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy
[11:54] right hand but it shall not come nigh
[11:57] thee
[11:58] because thou has made the Lord which is
[12:01] my Refugee Refuge even the most high thy
[12:05] habitation
[12:13] he shall for he shall give his angels
[12:16] charge over thee to keep thee in all thy
[12:19] ways
[12:26] Thou shalt tread upon the lion and Adder
[12:28] the Young Lion
[12:30] and the dragon shall thou trample under
[12:33] feet
[12:44] together he shall call upon me and I
[12:48] will answer him I will be with him in
[12:52] trouble I will deliver him and honor him
[12:55] with long life will I satisfy him and
[12:59] show him my salvation amen praise the
[13:02] Lord amen you can be seated dismissed
[13:06] for Sunday School
[13:09] foreign
[13:18] brothers and sisters
[13:21] you know when you read things like that
[13:22] what do you have to worry about
[13:25] what do you I mean if you're trusting
[13:28] and truly believing you really have
[13:30] nothing to worry about I know that's an
[13:32] easy thing to say it's a harder thing to
[13:35] believe
[13:36] if you would uh come with me to Hebrews
[13:39] the third chapter
[13:42] foreign
[13:48] worth the time change I was down in my
[13:50] office for hours this morning but
[13:53] before I get started you all know what
[13:55] we're doing about
[13:56] section off some of the land
[13:59] so that we can pay off the principal of
[14:01] the church loan so when I went to the
[14:04] bank on Tuesday I wasn't able to go on
[14:07] Monday
[14:08] the amount that we owe is about fifty
[14:10] eight thousand and sixty two dollars and
[14:13] there's some change there
[14:15] so with the offer of 36 000 that would
[14:19] bring it down to twenty three thousand
[14:21] dollars and change but the I'm going to
[14:24] be making a church payment before the
[14:27] 10th before Thursday I'll be making a a
[14:30] church payment so when it's all said and
[14:33] done
[14:34] but depending on when all this is done
[14:37] if it's before this December payment
[14:41] uh we'd actually instead of 22 would be
[14:44] down to twenty one thousand dollars
[14:46] worth of principal and I told the banker
[14:49] we wouldn't renegotiate the payment we'd
[14:52] just stick with the payment that we have
[14:54] and
[14:55] that that would mean if if we didn't
[14:58] have any major expenses that the church
[15:01] should be paid off within 18 months a
[15:03] year and a half so and that's making the
[15:06] regular payments that we have every
[15:09] month so
[15:11] the Lord's being faithful and blessing I
[15:14] I'm like any of you business let's just
[15:17] you can pay it off with the the way
[15:20] things work out there in the world the
[15:21] better off we are with not having to
[15:23] have a big church payment but turning
[15:26] changing everything here going to
[15:28] Hebrews the third chapter and and I was
[15:31] just reading this morning going
[15:32] different places in that Psalm this
[15:34] morning was in that devotional for today
[15:37] in the that devotional that brother put
[15:39] together for the message that Tom was
[15:42] the
[15:43] the scripture reading one of the
[15:45] scripture readings for this morning
[15:47] but I'll just go to this third chapter
[15:50] our mom was about to use an acronym I I
[15:53] stopped myself well let me read here
[15:56] wherefore holy brethren partakers
[15:59] of the Heavenly call and consider
[16:02] the Apostle and high Priests of our
[16:04] profession Jesus Christ excuse me Christ
[16:07] Jesus and um so Paul's telling us here
[16:11] to really think about our profession
[16:13] first I didn't pronounce that right but
[16:16] he goes on to say who was faithful to
[16:18] him that appointed him as also Moses was
[16:21] faithful in all his house
[16:23] so he whether you believe it or not God
[16:26] is faithful Christ is faithful just like
[16:29] Moses was Faithful over the house of
[16:31] Israel and I just wrote down some other
[16:34] people that you can go through the Bible
[16:35] that were faithful in the house that God
[16:38] gave him to be faithful but let me read
[16:40] a few more of these scriptures
[16:42] for this man was counter-worthy of more
[16:45] Glory than Moses and so much
[16:48] as he who hath builded the house had
[16:50] more honor than the house
[16:52] for every house is built by some man but
[16:55] he did buildeth all things as God
[16:57] and he goes on to say and Moses verily
[17:00] was faithful in all his house as a
[17:03] servant for the testimony of those
[17:04] things through this word to be spoken
[17:06] after him
[17:08] and I just got some examples uh we all
[17:11] know that Jesus Christ of Christ Jesus
[17:13] was faithful completely in what God
[17:16] intended him to do and is still faithful
[17:18] this morning bringing about
[17:20] administering to us as the saints of God
[17:23] and then we know that Abraham
[17:26] ought to be faithful he was faithful at
[17:28] all
[17:30] as an example for us as Believers
[17:33] Believers that we should follow just
[17:36] just mention most
[17:38] Moses was faithful and all that God gave
[17:41] them to do but as a Gentiles we have an
[17:45] example we can look back to and Paul was
[17:47] faithful in all his house when God gave
[17:49] him to do while he was opening the
[17:52] church to the to the world and you could
[17:55] say the same thing for the message to
[17:57] the our brother Branham was faithful and
[17:59] all the things that God had him to do in
[18:02] the age that we lived this morning but
[18:04] let me read I hope I didn't lose my
[18:06] place here
[18:07] some of these other scriptures I'm not
[18:09] going to read this whole chapter this
[18:11] morning
[18:12] um and he goes on by Christ as the son
[18:15] over his own house whose house are we If
[18:18] We Hold Fast the confidence and the
[18:21] rejoicing of the Hope firm on to the end
[18:23] and you know that's where we're at this
[18:26] morning in the world that way are you
[18:28] going to hold on to the end he that
[18:31] endures to the end will be saved are you
[18:34] gonna hold
[18:35] that God gave you this morning no matter
[18:38] what's going on out those four walls
[18:41] this afternoon or this morning
[18:43] whatever's going on are you going to
[18:44] hold faithful to the promises God gave
[18:46] you that by Christ that's the son over
[18:49] his own house whose house are we If We
[18:52] Hold Fast the confidence and then
[18:54] rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end
[18:57] wherefore as the Holy Ghost say today if
[19:00] you will hear my hear his voice Harden
[19:03] not your heart says in the propagation
[19:05] in The Temptations in the wilderness and
[19:09] I'll stop there because it goes on
[19:10] talking about how the children of Israel
[19:13] weren't faithful and that they chose a
[19:16] different path but I'm just going to
[19:17] read some Iraq
[19:20] that word Faithful is pretty pretty
[19:22] strong word but I was I was going
[19:26] through a dictionary and I'll just these
[19:29] are some of these are some of the
[19:33] of the synonyms for that word
[19:36] not being I'm not I don't even qualify
[19:40] to to know the English language so I
[19:42] won't try to be an English teacher here
[19:44] but um but basically someone that is
[19:47] faithful or faith is is consistent
[19:51] also he's Resolute if you're faithful
[19:54] you're going to be Resolute and that's
[19:56] with the promises that God gave you and
[19:59] the calling he put you in you're going
[20:01] to be Resolute you're not going to
[20:03] question what God wants you to do you're
[20:06] going to be a staunch believer you're
[20:08] not going to let the things you're not
[20:10] going to be flighty you're not going to
[20:11] be moving left or right you're going to
[20:13] stay firm on the path that God gave you
[20:16] and you're going to be steady and true
[20:19] dependable and that's a
[20:21] to be faithful you got to be dependent
[20:23] upon and you all know out there in the
[20:25] world you can't Outsiders
[20:29] trust in people you got to trust people
[20:30] but you know dependability is a hard
[20:33] trait to find anymore out there and he
[20:35] goes on to say reliable a faithful
[20:39] person will be reliable if you give
[20:42] someone a promise whether it's here in
[20:44] church or out there in the world you're
[20:46] going to be reliable you're going to
[20:48] hold fast to the promises you give
[20:49] people it goes on to say a tribe A
[20:53] faithful person has been tried
[20:55] trustworthing
[20:57] affectionate devoted loving and well
[21:00] they're just using other examples but
[21:03] the one thing I thought was kind of
[21:04] funny uh your antonym or the opposite
[21:08] the negative thing about being faithful
[21:10] the one word that really struck to me
[21:13] the reading the dictionary was
[21:15] treacherous so if you're if if you have
[21:19] all the opposite values of being
[21:21] faithful the one thing that struck me
[21:22] this morning was being someone who was
[21:24] stretched us basically you're not no one
[21:27] can count on you whatever you say you
[21:30] don't know if you're telling someone the
[21:31] truth or not but I was just going to
[21:33] read a few of these scriptures in the
[21:35] Bible in my thoughts and chain reference
[21:37] Bible not want to take a lot of time
[21:39] this morning
[21:40] and um I'll the different chapters but
[21:43] it's on page 14 14 if you have a
[21:46] Thompson Chain reference Bible knowing
[21:49] therefore the Lord thy God he is God
[21:52] that's uh in Deuteronomy the seventh and
[21:54] the 9th first
[21:56] and faithful God who keepeth Covenant
[21:58] and mercy with them that love him and
[22:00] keep his and keep his Commandments to a
[22:03] thousand Generations so that's a
[22:06] promising word right there what God
[22:08] promised 2 000 years ago what God
[22:11] promised yesterday is all the same in
[22:13] the eyes of God and he goes to say in
[22:16] First Kings the eighth chapter and the
[22:18] 56th verse blessed be the Lord that hath
[22:21] given rest on To His People Israel
[22:23] according to all that he promised there
[22:25] hath not one fell one word of all those
[22:29] good promises which he promised by the
[22:31] hand of Moses his servant and you can
[22:34] take a scripture like that and just
[22:36] bring it completely through all the word
[22:38] of God and God whatever that promise is
[22:41] God will bring it about and he goes in
[22:44] Psalms 36 chapter and the fifth verse
[22:46] the mercy of the Lord is in the heavens
[22:49] and thy faithfulness reaches on to the
[22:51] clouds and then Psalms 89 and 1 I will
[22:55] sing of the mercies of the Lord forever
[22:58] with my mouth will I make known by
[23:00] faithfulness to all generations and then
[23:03] jumping up into the New Testament here
[23:06] uh First Corinthians the first chapter
[23:09] ninth verse again talks about it God is
[23:13] faithful by whom you were called unto
[23:15] the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ
[23:17] Our Lord you know
[23:20] it's when we read the word of God or
[23:23] when I read the word of God it's just
[23:25] words
[23:26] until you pray and meditate over it and
[23:30] God
[23:31] vindicates you to your heart and life
[23:33] it's just words a lot of times unless
[23:35] God makes it real to you but you have to
[23:37] be in a place in your life where you're
[23:39] actually reading it and trying to apply
[23:42] it into who God reveals it to you and
[23:44] then in Hebrews the sixth chapter and
[23:46] the 18th verse and this is really
[23:48] important I'll finish with this one here
[23:50] there are two immutable things in which
[23:53] it was impossible for God the line but
[23:56] we might have strong consolation who
[23:59] have fled for The Refuge to lay hold
[24:03] on the hope that set us before us to our
[24:06] circumference thought you know this
[24:07] morning no matter where you're at you
[24:10] walk or where you're at in in your life
[24:12] that God can't live he made a promise to
[24:14] us or made a promise to you God's going
[24:17] to bring it about I I know your enemy
[24:19] out there in the world out there is
[24:21] trying to shake the promises of God out
[24:23] of your heart and out of your life but
[24:25] God is more than able to bring about
[24:27] those promises and everyone's heart
[24:29] alive here this morning brother David
[24:34] amen loving with all your heart this
[24:37] morning

[27:32] well I want to tell you
[27:35] how good our God is this morning one
[27:37] more time
[27:38] we've been praying for my sister-in-law
[27:40] Joanna
[27:41] she blacked out the other day and her
[27:43] blood pressure just been through the
[27:44] roof on the bottom
[27:46] she went home from the doctor from the
[27:49] hospital
[27:50] her blood pressure is normal
[27:53] they don't know why it did why it did
[27:56] they think because she was born with a
[27:58] hole in her heart she's I better tell
[28:01] how old she is well she's 53 and they
[28:04] said most time people this is after a
[28:07] stroke all this happens no stroke
[28:09] everything normal
[28:12] blood pressure no more pills no nothing
[28:16] but they said we're going to have you
[28:18] wear a heart monitor for 30 days she
[28:20] said okay
[28:22] just how awesome our God is and we had
[28:25] that prayer cloth for little Nolan
[28:28] his mother's she doesn't go to church or
[28:30] anywhere
[28:31] the other day and me and Jan was talking
[28:34] about it we don't know what it is
[28:35] they've sent it off to the doctor this
[28:37] little boy he's one-year-old he coughed
[28:39] up three piles of some yucky looking
[28:42] stuff all bloody
[28:46] they're sending off to see what it is
[28:47] God is moving in his midst
[28:51] and he's the little kid he's a year old
[28:53] he's got all kind of problems I just
[28:55] thought I had problems but he's one year
[28:57] old and I thought Lord
[29:00] let let this be a light to them
[29:03] let it let them see how good you really
[29:05] are
[29:07] you know
[29:08] and you know they look at Janet at work
[29:10] and they see her and she's different
[29:12] because she her mom they don't dress and
[29:15] act like the rest of the people do said
[29:17] Lord let them see the light The Shining
[29:19] in their day
[29:22] and then you know I talked brother
[29:24] Truman last night and up at brother
[29:26] Nathan Brian's Church they've had six
[29:27] people that the enemy has thrown cancer
[29:30] on
[29:31] the last one was sister Jeannie Hoover
[29:34] and he said they went through everything
[29:36] and he said Brother David he said they
[29:38] have decided after all this and prayer
[29:41] he said it's just in one little spot and
[29:43] they can contain this no big deal
[29:46] I said what an awesome God
[29:49] I said How's sister Carol done he said
[29:51] she's feeling better every day so she
[29:53] goes back in December so but she's
[29:55] getting her straight back so she feels
[29:57] good he said God has moved
[30:01] I said what announced from God we served
[30:03] this morning
[30:04] and I don't know about you but I'll tell
[30:06] you it just makes me want to just run as
[30:08] hard as I can
[30:10] because he is so faithful
[30:13] and so many times for the bread I
[30:15] failing I fail to pray I'll get up from

[56:55] Lord and Lord we pray if there's any

[57:07] Jesus Christ we ask these things for
[57:09] your glory amen amen if you have your
[57:12] Bibles let's turn to Nehemiah chapter 8
[57:17] Nehemiah chapter 8 and uh
[57:25] we'll start at uh
[57:28] what does read from verse 12 down to the
[57:30] end of the chapter this is after
[57:32] Nehemiah I build the wall
[57:35] and restored their form of worship the
[57:38] way they had it before uh you know they
[57:42] went in into captivity and all those
[57:43] things and uh
[57:45] in the first part of the chapter they
[57:46] brought
[57:47] they brought the book to the priest to
[57:50] read
[57:51] and I believe it's a perfect time of uh
[57:53] of the age that that we live in so I
[57:56] want to pick up a verse 13 for the sake
[57:57] of time
[57:58] on the second day
[58:01] were gathered together the chief of the
[58:02] fathers of all the people the priests
[58:05] the Levites unto Ezra describe even to
[58:08] understand the words of the law
[58:11] for they found written in the law which
[58:13] the Lord had commanded by Moses that the
[58:15] children of Israel
[58:17] should dwell in booths in the Feast of
[58:20] the seventh month and that they should
[58:23] publish and Proclaim in all their cities
[58:25] and in Jerusalem saying go forth unto
[58:29] the mount and fetch all the branches and
[58:31] pine branches and Myrtle branches and
[58:33] palm branches and branches of thick
[58:35] trees to make booths as it is written so
[58:38] the people went forth and brought them
[58:40] and made themselves booths everyone up
[58:43] on the roof of his house and in their
[58:45] courts and in the courts of the house of
[58:47] God and in the streets
[58:49] Street of the Watergate and in the
[58:51] street out the gate of Ephraim and all
[58:54] the congregation of them that were come
[58:56] again out of the Captivity made booth
[58:59] and sat onto the booze for since the
[59:01] days of Joshua the son of none undo that
[59:04] they had not the children of Israel done
[59:07] so and there was a very great gladness
[59:10] also day by day
[59:13] from the first day until the last day he
[59:16] read in the book of The Law of God and
[59:18] they kept the feast seven days
[59:20] and on the eighth day was his solemn
[59:22] assembly according unto the manner God
[59:26] bless the reading of his word you can be
[59:27] seated this morning I want to title it a
[59:30] solemn
[59:31] a solemn meeting place
[59:34] a solemn meeting place I went on
[59:37] uh we you know this the scripture
[59:39] reading here we understand the Old
[59:42] Testament is all you know it's it's
[59:44] types and shadows of what is to come and
[59:46] uh and uh we understand that there's a
[59:49] day of the seventh Church age
[59:52] which is the Feast of the seventh month
[59:55] and uh you know I hope these things
[59:58] don't get old to us that you know seven
[1:00:00] we we hear it from for we've heard it
[1:00:02] for many years you know what a seventh
[1:00:04] day to seventh month and all these
[1:00:05] things but you know if we if we look at
[1:00:07] it we stop and look at it and think
[1:00:09] about it you know is is seven is
[1:00:12] completion
[1:00:13] and uh so after seven there's nowhere
[1:00:18] else to go
[1:00:19] and uh and that's why in the seventh
[1:00:22] Church age I mean God had restored
[1:00:25] everything and so these scriptures here
[1:00:28] are a type the age and the time the hour
[1:00:30] that we are living in amen the problem
[1:00:33] of God said that we are that uh that
[1:00:37] that the the Feast of Tabernacles was
[1:00:40] the last feast or the seventh Feast he
[1:00:43] said we are worshiping now under the
[1:00:45] Feast of Tabernacles the sevens Church
[1:00:48] age it is that in the Millennium will be
[1:00:50] worshiping under the Feast of
[1:00:52] Tabernacles again because that is the
[1:00:54] seventh day because no man has ever
[1:00:56] taken that seventh day did you realize
[1:00:58] that amen God said in the day you eat
[1:01:02] thereof that day you shall die and
[1:01:05] nobody has lived A Thousand Years yet
[1:01:08] amen but we will take it amen so that is
[1:01:11] the seventh day where we live and
[1:01:13] worship under
[1:01:15] that Seven's Feast again but we are now
[1:01:19] worshiping under the Feast of
[1:01:20] Tabernacles in the church age
[1:01:22] on the spiritual side of it is that
[1:01:24] right amen so and and I I I I think we
[1:01:29] should all know that we are are most
[1:01:31] certainly in
[1:01:32] the seventh Church age the last and not
[1:01:35] not only in the seventh Church age but
[1:01:37] that we are at the very end
[1:01:39] all of the seven of the short Change
[1:01:41] at the closing of the world's history
[1:01:46] we are living here brother Brad amen God
[1:01:49] bless you good to see you amen we are
[1:01:51] living in the closing of and I know it's
[1:01:55] hard for us to even grasp a hold of that
[1:01:57] but that we are living in the closing of
[1:02:00] the world's history but I think if we if
[1:02:03] we look around a little bit and just on
[1:02:06] a world stage I don't want to spend any
[1:02:07] time in that but if you just take a
[1:02:10] glance on the world station and if you
[1:02:12] ever if you ever even open your iPad or
[1:02:15] whatever or look at headline news you
[1:02:17] don't even have to read the story The
[1:02:19] the actual story
[1:02:21] just read the headlines and it'll tell
[1:02:24] you we are at the end time
[1:02:25] everything is about destruction and hate
[1:02:28] and War and and even in the Sports World
[1:02:31] you see headlines you know and it's a
[1:02:33] constant it's like every week or every
[1:02:35] day or whatever you know people don't
[1:02:37] just play sports anymore they they get
[1:02:40] in the fights
[1:02:42] they can't people can't hold their
[1:02:45] tempers
[1:02:46] they can't hold their emotions but
[1:02:49] that's on the world side but that lets
[1:02:51] you know the condition
[1:02:53] where the world is in right now that
[1:02:57] they have come into a place where they
[1:02:59] have they have literally have lost their
[1:03:02] minds and their emotions are completely
[1:03:04] out of control you know there was a time
[1:03:07] in this country where you could have a
[1:03:09] different viewpoint on politics and you
[1:03:11] can still get along but now you you
[1:03:14] almost have to keep your beliefs and
[1:03:16] Secret
[1:03:18] you know if you don't want to have an
[1:03:20] argument you know we have to back home
[1:03:22] uh thankfully we have a neighbor right
[1:03:24] across the street they actually they're
[1:03:26] they're uh they definitely don't have
[1:03:29] the same viewpoints that we do as far as
[1:03:31] when it comes to politics but we get
[1:03:33] along just fine I can call them but I'm
[1:03:35] aware that you know if we're all out of
[1:03:38] town I can call them and say I have a
[1:03:39] package coming from Amazon you know if
[1:03:41] it comes can you go get it and put it in
[1:03:43] your house you know Wonderful neighbors
[1:03:45] you know but that's something you don't
[1:03:46] see very often anymore you know a lot of
[1:03:49] a lot of a lot of places they won't even
[1:03:51] speak to you if you have a different
[1:03:52] viewpoint but you know that's out there
[1:03:54] but you know those spirits come into the
[1:03:57] spiritual realm also comes into the
[1:04:00] church where if you have a different
[1:04:02] Viewpoint to somebody else you won't
[1:04:04] even speak to one another
[1:04:06] I think it's a shame that we claim to
[1:04:08] have the greatest message that ever has
[1:04:10] come to the Earth amen a place which
[1:04:13] really is our subtle meeting place is
[1:04:16] under the message of the hour but yet if
[1:04:18] I meet somebody and they have a
[1:04:21] different Viewpoint we can't even speak
[1:04:23] to each other sometimes
[1:04:24] we ought to be able to wrap our arms
[1:04:27] around one another say God bless you
[1:04:28] amen I might have a different Viewpoint
[1:04:31] than you do but the old brother sister
[1:04:33] let's press on to the to the end road to
[1:04:36] the end of the goal amen we're not going
[1:04:39] to stay here and you know we can
[1:04:42] everything we're going to go to heaven
[1:04:44] together let's just get along here right
[1:04:46] I'm not talking about compromising on
[1:04:48] the world I'm not talking about that
[1:04:50] because we should never compromise on
[1:04:52] the word you understand but amen there
[1:04:55] is hey yo when it comes to human beings
[1:04:57] and we all are human beings yet when it
[1:05:00] comes to human beings we are going to
[1:05:01] have different viewpoints on certain
[1:05:04] things but a lot of things that we argue
[1:05:06] and fuss about have nothing to do with
[1:05:08] salvation
[1:05:10] there's a lot of honestly there's a lot
[1:05:13] of uh you know
[1:05:16] viewpoints and arguments and things that
[1:05:18] take place in the ranks of the message
[1:05:21] that are are really only because of
[1:05:23] legalistic views
[1:05:26] come on Church we've become so
[1:05:28] legalistic that we can't hardly move
[1:05:31] I tell you I'm learning sisters I came
[1:05:33] out of a system like that and I don't
[1:05:35] want to go back in but I want to say
[1:05:37] this morning this message is not rules
[1:05:39] and regulations and orders and but yet
[1:05:42] God has an order we understand that God
[1:05:44] has a word that we have to follow
[1:05:47] and we love him Jesus said if you love
[1:05:50] me keep my Commandments is that right so
[1:05:53] so there is the law of God there is a
[1:05:55] word of God that as Christians we want
[1:05:58] to keep but a lot of little things that
[1:06:01] we're arguing first about you're just
[1:06:03] like the Pharisees full of time you know
[1:06:04] back in the days of Jesus Christ you
[1:06:06] know you're argue about I'll find your
[1:06:09] hats and how wide they're going to be
[1:06:10] the Garment should be and all that stuff
[1:06:13] and none of it is in the Bible
[1:06:19] I'm so happy this morning that we are
[1:06:21] free from those things that we are free
[1:06:24] from the dominationalism and I would say
[1:06:26] this morning let's not go back to
[1:06:28] denominationalism let's stay away from
[1:06:31] it God has brought us into a meeting
[1:06:33] place with him let's stay free
[1:06:36] free in the spirit free to worship they
[1:06:40] may not bow by any man's ideas not bound
[1:06:42] by a certain Church
[1:06:44] God has brought us into a fellowship
[1:06:47] amen so you know John and and John
[1:06:52] chapter 7 verse 37
[1:06:55] uh the Bible says in the last day that
[1:06:58] great day of defeats Jesus stood and
[1:07:01] Christ saying if any man thirsts I hope
[1:07:04] we still have a thirst If any man thirst
[1:07:06] let him come unto me and drink he that
[1:07:09] believes on me he that Believers on me
[1:07:11] as the scripture has said out of his
[1:07:14] Bellagio four rivers rivers of Living
[1:07:17] Water listen this message is not just a
[1:07:20] little Supernatural trigger and it's a
[1:07:23] river of water it's a it's full of
[1:07:27] blessings
[1:07:28] it's full of joy amen if you don't have
[1:07:32] the joy of the Lord in your heart this
[1:07:34] morning it's because you did something
[1:07:37] you are not where you ought to be God
[1:07:40] doesn't lack the joy God doesn't like
[1:07:42] the supernatural God is full of joy and
[1:07:45] full of blessings and full of Correction
[1:07:50] but if you don't love that correction
[1:07:52] you don't you can't get into the spirit
[1:07:54] of the hour the spirit of the word and
[1:07:57] the joy what God has given to you you're
[1:08:00] just Bachelor that's all I don't know
[1:08:01] what to say I don't know what to say
[1:08:04] Jesus said he that thirst let him come
[1:08:07] unto me
[1:08:08] and then as the scripture has sent out
[1:08:11] of his belly shall flow rivers in other
[1:08:14] words there's plenty of it
[1:08:17] we don't have to drink sparingly
[1:08:19] you know it's just like brother bam said
[1:08:21] about a little fish on the oldest
[1:08:22] brother Paul he said yo a little bit of
[1:08:25] fish out in the ocean he said I'd better
[1:08:26] drink sparity up this water I'm not run
[1:08:28] out one day
[1:08:30] you know how foolish that is well it's
[1:08:33] just as foolish when you think that you
[1:08:35] don't want to ask God for big things
[1:08:36] that you might exhaust God's blessings
[1:08:39] you could never exhaust His blessings
[1:08:41] you're going to never exhaust his
[1:08:43] miracles you could never exhausted
[1:08:46] salvation
[1:08:47] Hallelujah you never exhaust is healing
[1:08:50] hey man listen if we believe that there
[1:08:53] are salvation then we have to believe
[1:08:54] there's healing
[1:08:56] healing and salvation are in the same
[1:08:58] atonement
[1:09:00] Hallelujah I'm going to get on the nice
[1:09:03] service but amen I I I believe God's
[1:09:07] still alive Billy Joe
[1:09:09] hey man so amen Jesus said in the last
[1:09:12] day the great day of the feast so he
[1:09:14] made it Jesus made it specific that that
[1:09:17] the last day was the great day of the
[1:09:20] feast was the last day
[1:09:22] is that right hey Miss oh it's not just
[1:09:26] any day listen the hour you're living in
[1:09:29] brother Brian is not just any day
[1:09:32] what do you recognize it or realize or
[1:09:35] not you are living in a special day
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:40] oh my we are living in a time that Enoch
[1:09:43] was our type
[1:09:45] where one man took a body change
[1:09:48] oh you're living a day where it's going
[1:09:50] to be more than one
[1:09:52] I don't know about you but I'm gonna be
[1:09:54] changed though so they're sure
[1:09:57] one more now surely one more besides me
[1:10:00] right and then you got to believe it the
[1:10:03] same way
[1:10:04] amen so you're living in a special day
[1:10:07] amen that God will not just take one man
[1:10:09] and allow him to walk into that next
[1:10:11] Dimension without tasting death that's
[1:10:13] going to be a group
[1:10:15] and I don't know how big that group's
[1:10:17] gonna be but it doesn't matter how big
[1:10:18] we know that every predestinator seed is
[1:10:21] going to be there and I'm going to
[1:10:23] believe that I'm one of them
[1:10:26] yo when I first come to the message from
[1:10:28] the title remembers very well yo one of
[1:10:31] the main songs we always sing I'm so
[1:10:32] glad I can say I'm one of them you know
[1:10:35] what I tell you after 30 some years I'm
[1:10:37] still glad I can say I'm one of them
[1:10:40] my I can't believe it's been that long
[1:10:43] but your ability is that it's well I
[1:10:45] guess I I I'm gonna have my 40-year
[1:10:47] anniversary
[1:10:49] in September
[1:10:51] 1982 September 26th so I baptized name
[1:10:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ if I'm doing my
[1:10:56] math right it's 40 years right I gotta
[1:10:58] check with other people a lot of times
[1:11:00] amen amen but I'm still I slide to
[1:11:04] actually I'm more glad about it today
[1:11:07] I'm happy about it today because I can
[1:11:09] look back at all that time and all the
[1:11:11] struggles and all the things I went
[1:11:13] through it all the times when you feel
[1:11:14] like you can't take another step and yet
[1:11:16] I can look back and I say well here I am
[1:11:19] so I'm happy about it today than the
[1:11:21] evil was because now I understand more
[1:11:24] about it than I did then you know when
[1:11:26] when you first come to the Lord yo
[1:11:28] you're you're saved you're enthused
[1:11:30] you're happy but really honestly you
[1:11:32] don't know much about what you're happy
[1:11:34] about
[1:11:36] is that right you just know something
[1:11:38] happened you know something changed you
[1:11:40] you know something delivered you from
[1:11:42] your habits
[1:11:43] that's all you know we know water
[1:11:46] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:48] Christ we knew that but that's about all
[1:11:50] we do modern baptism serpency you know
[1:11:53] the great Harlot but now we can look
[1:11:56] back and we say my it wasn't just those
[1:12:00] fundamental doctrines yet you gotta have
[1:12:03] that as a foundation but now we can see
[1:12:06] where we are today as the Bride of Jesus
[1:12:08] Christ that God has called us not just
[1:12:11] called us but he's called us and brought
[1:12:13] us into a place a solemn meeting place
[1:12:17] God never called you to a church
[1:12:21] he called you to himself
[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:26] amen he said let him come unto me
[1:12:30] he didn't say let him come under the
[1:12:32] church
[1:12:33] let him come unto me too many people
[1:12:36] have a church experience but don't have
[1:12:38] a Christ experience
[1:12:39] is that right I want a Christ experience
[1:12:43] amen so Jesus was speaking directly and
[1:12:46] distinctly that this great feast was the
[1:12:50] last feast and if you notice Jesus
[1:12:53] showed up
[1:12:56] on the last they are the feast I mean
[1:12:59] you remember early on in the chapter uh
[1:13:02] uh John chapter 7 amen uh he said that
[1:13:06] he was not going to go up
[1:13:08] then when you go up to the feast he said
[1:13:10] no I will not go here you go up I will
[1:13:13] not go up because my time is not yet
[1:13:17] so I would ask you did Jesus tell a
[1:13:20] story
[1:13:21] thank you
[1:13:23] he said I I will not go my time is not
[1:13:26] yet but then he went
[1:13:29] yo if you are a really good critic you
[1:13:32] could say well Jesus said something that
[1:13:33] wasn't true
[1:13:35] he said I'm not going out
[1:13:38] but he did
[1:13:40] oh I'll tell you there's some things
[1:13:41] about God you just cannot explain
[1:13:43] amen but amen he went to the feast and
[1:13:47] he he he cried out at the feast let him
[1:13:50] as the stars come unto me but you you if
[1:13:53] you go back and read the story I won't
[1:13:55] go there but but if you go back and look
[1:13:57] at it the people didn't know who he was
[1:14:01] as a matter of fact when Jesus came to
[1:14:03] the feast and he made that statement
[1:14:05] amen it caused a division the Bible says
[1:14:09] there was a division because of him
[1:14:13] Hallelujah Jesus causes division
[1:14:16] sometimes
[1:14:18] amen not that he wants to but just by
[1:14:20] speaking the truth because what they
[1:14:23] didn't know who he was
[1:14:25] and though and they were they one of us
[1:14:28] yeah they're trying to say away it's not
[1:14:30] this that Prophet from Galilean oh no
[1:14:33] Prophet comes out of Galilee and he
[1:14:36] argued about it finally that do you also
[1:14:38] Come From Galilee or they were just
[1:14:39] fussing at one another and all of this
[1:14:42] they didn't understand who Jesus Christ
[1:14:43] was
[1:14:45] but the invitation had gone out
[1:14:49] amen he that has thirsty let him come to
[1:14:52] me that's all yo listen Jesus is not
[1:14:55] looking
[1:14:57] and I know he's his contrary to probably
[1:15:01] 98 of the churches in America or the
[1:15:04] world but Jesus is not looking to save
[1:15:07] the world
[1:15:09] [Music]
[1:15:11] I know I know you know he didn't believe
[1:15:15] it and you know I I know I know all
[1:15:16] those things we argue about but but
[1:15:18] bring it back to the Bible and look at
[1:15:20] the if Jesus is looking to save the
[1:15:23] world what did Jesus say I don't even
[1:15:25] pray for them
[1:15:27] but in John 17 I believe it is he prayed
[1:15:31] for you
[1:15:32] Hallelujah he said I pray for them
[1:15:36] I pray that they will be
[1:15:39] that they will have the same position as
[1:15:41] I had with the father I pray that
[1:15:43] they'll have the same place
[1:15:48] so Jesus prayed for us he prayed for the
[1:15:51] predestinated
[1:15:53] but he didn't pray for the world
[1:15:55] yo people become so
[1:15:58] upsetting yo when you say that the
[1:16:00] problem of God made the statement he
[1:16:02] says I don't even pray for America oh
[1:16:04] how terrible
[1:16:06] but you know God even told I believe it
[1:16:10] was uh Jeremiah or a seagull I forget
[1:16:13] which exactly right now but he told them
[1:16:15] he said don't even pray for them
[1:16:18] so it's exactly the scripture why
[1:16:21] because they have turned down the gospel
[1:16:25] they've turned down the supernatural
[1:16:27] message that God has sent and because
[1:16:30] this country in the world has turned it
[1:16:33] down judgment is coming upon the world
[1:16:36] and once you cross the line and the
[1:16:39] prophet of God said that she did cross
[1:16:41] the line
[1:16:43] now when you cross the line when they
[1:16:46] when a nation crosses the line they
[1:16:48] never come back across the line again
[1:16:51] right and when you as an individual
[1:16:54] cross the line
[1:16:56] between mercy and judgment you'll never
[1:16:59] come back to Mercy again
[1:17:02] is that right
[1:17:03] amen but don't let the devil lie to you
[1:17:06] and tell you that you crossed the line
[1:17:08] when you didn't
[1:17:10] thank you
[1:17:11] ah listen I I know the same devil you
[1:17:14] know
[1:17:16] personal confrontations with him
[1:17:18] sometimes I tell you I got I got
[1:17:20] conversations in my mind with him
[1:17:22] sometimes I just Mandy go on forever
[1:17:25] amen you know but I I always come out
[1:17:29] the winner
[1:17:32] not because I can out talk him but
[1:17:35] because I can go back to the book
[1:17:37] I go back to the Bible says all right
[1:17:40] you might have a good argument Satan but
[1:17:42] really it's not good enough because this
[1:17:44] is who I am and the Bible says greater
[1:17:47] is he that's in me and he that's in the
[1:17:50] world so get away from me
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:54] greater he that's in you than he that's
[1:17:56] in the world who's the world Satan
[1:18:01] sickness
[1:18:02] lies
[1:18:04] everything contrary to the word is the
[1:18:06] world
[1:18:08] so if you have the Holy Spirit greater
[1:18:11] is he that's in you
[1:18:13] so don't let the devil lie to you say
[1:18:15] well you have crossed the line listen uh
[1:18:18] let me um
[1:18:20] I won't get through anything else I'm
[1:18:22] just going to quit at some point but but
[1:18:24] uh listen
[1:18:26] there's a difference between a
[1:18:28] predestinated seed
[1:18:30] and a non predestinated seed that can
[1:18:34] blaspheme
[1:18:36] right
[1:18:37] now I'm not predestined this he can
[1:18:40] blaspheme
[1:18:41] and never have a chance
[1:18:43] you married a woman that made the
[1:18:45] statement and said I wouldn't let my cow
[1:18:47] follow your religion
[1:18:48] what happened to her but what did
[1:18:51] Apostle Paul say I who was before a
[1:18:54] blasphemer
[1:18:56] figure that one out
[1:19:00] because Paul was a predestinated servant
[1:19:04] to the first church age
[1:19:06] and it is ignorance he said it
[1:19:10] but you know when that I know I know
[1:19:14] that just doesn't seem fair
[1:19:18] how could one blaspheme and yo never
[1:19:21] have a chance again but another guy can
[1:19:23] look Paul Paul was not
[1:19:26] Paul was not your favorite
[1:19:29] theologian
[1:19:31] he was feared
[1:19:33] amongst the church I'm talking about the
[1:19:36] Believers the Believers were afraid
[1:19:38] which at that time you saw
[1:19:41] right they were afraid of him
[1:19:45] but that seed was in him and no matter
[1:19:48] what he did
[1:19:51] and even so much that when when he met
[1:19:53] the light he had letters in his hand
[1:19:58] to take people like you and I and commit
[1:20:01] them to prison or do whatever he wanted
[1:20:03] to do
[1:20:04] he had the power he had the letters from
[1:20:07] the high priest
[1:20:09] and he was on his way to cause more
[1:20:11] trouble for the church
[1:20:13] and God said okay that's far enough Saul
[1:20:17] that says as long as my leash will go
[1:20:21] amen and Saul come the end of his Legion
[1:20:24] God said
[1:20:27] it's kind of like fishing you know
[1:20:29] you are you I might get a big one you
[1:20:32] let him go for so long but fine you know
[1:20:34] if it's a real big one and you yo you're
[1:20:37] coming to the end of the line
[1:20:40] say okay I gotta put the brakes on a
[1:20:42] little harder we're coming to the end of
[1:20:44] the road y'all want to just lock it up
[1:20:46] real quick
[1:20:48] go a little slows it doesn't break the
[1:20:50] line but finally come to the end of it
[1:20:52] amen anywhere
[1:20:56] you're wearing a little devil out but I
[1:20:58] guess the fish is not a devil but you
[1:21:00] know justify to the spirits like hey you
[1:21:02] wear that Old Devil out you know and
[1:21:04] then you know listen Saul Saul was
[1:21:09] Saul was so mean
[1:21:11] but he was religious
[1:21:14] I did that himself should tell you I you
[1:21:17] know I I think we all have met people
[1:21:19] like Saul
[1:21:22] religious as could be but mean as could
[1:21:25] be
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:27] go to church
[1:21:29] have a good time at church
[1:21:32] but in their heart they're full of evil
[1:21:38] but so amen was acting like
[1:21:44] a non predestinated seed
[1:21:49] but that's not what he was
[1:21:51] Hallelujah he had a seat on the inside
[1:21:55] that was predestinated that came from
[1:21:57] the mind of God before the foundation of
[1:22:00] the world and God says today it's your
[1:22:03] day
[1:22:04] this is as far as you want to go I'm
[1:22:06] going to reel you in
[1:22:08] amen and he was on his road down in God
[1:22:11] and he met that Pillar of Fire and
[1:22:14] brother Madison knocked him off his high
[1:22:15] horse
[1:22:17] anything you wander around in the dirt
[1:22:20] for a while because you lost his eye
[1:22:22] that that light blinded him
[1:22:26] oh Hallelujah
[1:22:28] May that light blind us to the things of
[1:22:31] the world
[1:22:32] amen may have blind us to all the
[1:22:35] carnelly around us
[1:22:36] amen and the boy says soul Soul what
[1:22:41] persecutes thou me
[1:22:44] now him being a Hebrew he knew that the
[1:22:47] light had to be Jehovah
[1:22:50] laughs
[1:22:52] oh he said Lord who are you
[1:22:57] all the prophet of God said that that
[1:22:59] that scholar saw me in a store he would
[1:23:02] never he would have never called I mean
[1:23:05] he knew that Delight
[1:23:08] he knew that that had to be the Lord
[1:23:10] Lord who are you
[1:23:13] and to his surprise
[1:23:15] to his surprise the boys came back says
[1:23:18] I am Jesus
[1:23:22] now put yourself in salt choose from it
[1:23:25] you imagine if you were Saul and you
[1:23:29] were persecuting those people that were
[1:23:31] trying to tell you that there was a man
[1:23:33] in the land by the name of Jesus he was
[1:23:35] a prophet he did all these things and
[1:23:36] you're trying to
[1:23:41] you're trying to stab all that nonsense
[1:23:44] you're trying to put those people in
[1:23:46] prison you're trying to get rid of those
[1:23:48] Fanatics that taught all those things
[1:23:50] and then the voice comes back and says
[1:23:52] I'm Jesus
[1:23:55] but you know what it was
[1:23:58] too late for Saul to do anything
[1:24:00] different than what he did
[1:24:03] because you're ready at calling Lord
[1:24:08] but then the boys come back says I'm
[1:24:10] Jesus
[1:24:13] and it's hard for you to kick against
[1:24:15] the pricks
[1:24:16] Hallelujah and you know the rest of the
[1:24:19] of the story but what was it Saul was
[1:24:22] predestinated
[1:24:25] amen and even though he was breathing
[1:24:29] out threatening God says today is your
[1:24:33] day maybe you're here today and maybe
[1:24:35] you're just sick and tired of it I just
[1:24:38] can't take anymore of this all I do is
[1:24:40] preach this and preach that and I just
[1:24:42] and God says today is your day
[1:24:46] amen why don't you ones meet the pillar
[1:24:49] of fire meet that same light that Saul
[1:24:52] met and it changed him
[1:24:54] and not only changed him but it changed
[1:24:57] his name Saul to Paul and at the same
[1:25:01] time I'm way over my notes now but at
[1:25:03] the same time God spoke to a man named
[1:25:07] ananias
[1:25:10] he said I want you to go to so and so
[1:25:13] and and pray for a certain man named
[1:25:15] Saul
[1:25:16] and I said oh wait a minute Lord
[1:25:22] you know I know we are the message
[1:25:25] church and we we have the truth and we
[1:25:27] we know well we know that you've raised
[1:25:31] from the dead and you send them a high
[1:25:32] and you send back the Holy Spirit and we
[1:25:35] are these Brave message Believers but do
[1:25:38] you know who you got
[1:25:42] Lord do you know who you're talking
[1:25:44] about can you imagine saying that
[1:25:46] he didn't exactly say those words but he
[1:25:48] didn't question
[1:25:49] Lord we have heard many things about
[1:25:51] this man
[1:25:53] but God said
[1:25:55] don't worry about it
[1:25:58] don't worry about it I have ordained him
[1:26:03] oh and then and now look look at that at
[1:26:07] the change of attitude with ananias
[1:26:10] well he went down there and he met Saul
[1:26:12] he goes brother Saul
[1:26:16] no more you're my enemy or I'm afraid of
[1:26:19] you oh I I know I don't know if my
[1:26:22] brother's all
[1:26:23] God has spoke on both ends
[1:26:26] is that right and got it listen I don't
[1:26:29] believe and you'll think about it you
[1:26:31] know maybe uh uh maybe Saul had
[1:26:33] committed some of ananias's family to
[1:26:36] prison
[1:26:38] maybe yeah committed young to death I
[1:26:40] don't know what he did
[1:26:41] because they all knew each other
[1:26:43] you understand so maybe uh somebody
[1:26:46] anodized his family was imprisoned
[1:26:48] because of Saul
[1:26:50] I tell you it'll take the Holy Spirit
[1:26:53] the wrap your arms around us always say
[1:26:56] God bless you brother
[1:26:58] amen but I'm here to tell you if you
[1:27:01] have the Holy Spirit you can do it
[1:27:04] you can't forgive one another they might
[1:27:06] have mistreated you yo whatever stole
[1:27:09] from you cheated you in business
[1:27:10] whatever it might be but if you have the
[1:27:12] Holy Spirit you can say God bless you
[1:27:15] brother
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:17] you know what we're coming to communion
[1:27:19] aren't we
[1:27:21] ah it's not my place to preach those
[1:27:23] things I guess I'm not the pastor here
[1:27:24] but you know and we're coming to the
[1:27:27] Lord's table let's come with a clear
[1:27:29] mind
[1:27:30] let's come with no no ought against one
[1:27:34] another
[1:27:35] God has brought you into a solemn
[1:27:37] meeting place a place of worship that he
[1:27:40] has chosen
[1:27:42] Hallelujah God chose the place of
[1:27:45] worship and the place of worship is not
[1:27:47] easy like Tabernacle but it's Jesus
[1:27:50] Christ
[1:27:50] [Applause]
[1:27:53] he's at the place that I choose to put
[1:27:56] my name and he chose to put his name in
[1:27:59] Jesus Christ oh I'm so glad that God
[1:28:02] sent us a message today amen that has
[1:28:04] taken us away from thinking that we have
[1:28:06] to belong to a certain Church
[1:28:08] and then but we've been called through
[1:28:10] Jesus Christ
[1:28:11] amen but listen let me tell you
[1:28:14] something if you call to Jesus Christ
[1:28:16] you will go to church somewhere
[1:28:19] oh yeah I think yo I catch those Spirits
[1:28:22] I'm dying well bless God that's right
[1:28:24] brother Bill I'm just Christ I need the
[1:28:27] fellowship with nobody Church
[1:28:30] do you imagine brother
[1:28:33] Parish I thought so like I'll be it was
[1:28:35] right there he just pulled it out but yo
[1:28:38] I claim to have the Holy Spirit he
[1:28:40] claims to have the Holy Spirit but I'm
[1:28:42] never going to fellowship with him I'm
[1:28:45] called the Christ I don't need your
[1:28:46] fellowship
[1:28:48] can you imagine we need one another
[1:28:52] that's right and if you if you yo uh
[1:28:55] I don't want to ruin the service anyhow
[1:28:56] but but uh you know if you have the Holy
[1:28:59] Spirit it will go the extra mile
[1:29:06] with the same spirit
[1:29:09] that's what people go to sports uh uh
[1:29:12] things you know because
[1:29:14] and you know the thing about going to uh
[1:29:17] doing sports event is you know when you
[1:29:20] go there you know that every person
[1:29:21] there wanted to be there
[1:29:26] at least I hope so you know why would
[1:29:29] you pay the price why would you buy a
[1:29:30] ticket if you don't want to be there
[1:29:31] just tell your friends I don't want to
[1:29:33] go so you know when you go to the sports
[1:29:36] event they all wanted to be there it's a
[1:29:39] little different than Church
[1:29:42] because when you come here you don't
[1:29:44] know for sure that everybody wanted to
[1:29:45] be here
[1:29:50] oh Hallelujah say Amen anyhow because
[1:29:53] there's always somebody that really is
[1:29:55] going to be here I'm just here because
[1:29:58] or let me just say even if you are just
[1:30:00] here because God can still save you this
[1:30:03] morning
[1:30:05] and the reason I said save you because
[1:30:07] if you don't want to be here you're
[1:30:08] probably not saved
[1:30:14] I'm sorry but the gospel is the gospel
[1:30:17] of truth is the truth if we claim to
[1:30:19] have the spirit of God we're going to do
[1:30:21] what things do to have this the people
[1:30:22] who have the spirit of God
[1:30:25] how can I say I love the Lord but I'm
[1:30:26] not going to do what the word says
[1:30:29] so if you don't like coming to church
[1:30:31] you know it is yeah it's a drag to come
[1:30:34] here just get saved it'll be all right
[1:30:39] I better go on
[1:30:42] oh my but you know Jesus said uh and yes
[1:30:46] I said we're in the last Church age
[1:30:48] right
[1:30:49] Jesus said
[1:30:51] in Revelation 3 20 behold I stand at the
[1:30:54] door
[1:30:56] so if he's standing at the door that
[1:30:58] means he's
[1:31:00] probably on the outside
[1:31:02] right because the scripture goes on and
[1:31:06] says
[1:31:07] if you open it he'll come in so he's on
[1:31:09] the outside
[1:31:11] he's knocking
[1:31:12] and this is the only church age that
[1:31:15] Jesus was outside the church
[1:31:19] now stop and thinking about that you
[1:31:21] know we we uh you know as as message
[1:31:23] Believers we've gotten so used to these
[1:31:25] scriptures and things we don't think
[1:31:27] much about sometimes but think about
[1:31:29] really what that scripture means if he's
[1:31:32] standing outside the church then that
[1:31:35] means that the church I'm just speaking
[1:31:36] not not individual churches now but I'm
[1:31:38] speaking of the church age in general
[1:31:40] that that Christ is not in the church
[1:31:44] age
[1:31:47] therefore most of your churches that are
[1:31:49] gathering today to have church are
[1:31:52] gathering without Jesus
[1:31:55] oh come on I I know we don't like that
[1:31:58] we but but that's the truth he's not in
[1:32:00] there
[1:32:01] he's outside and he's calling not to a
[1:32:04] church but to the individual
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:08] right
[1:32:10] he that hears what my voice
[1:32:13] and his voice is the word
[1:32:16] [Applause]
[1:32:17] he that hears my word
[1:32:20] and Believers on him that sent me has
[1:32:23] everlasting life
[1:32:26] right so he that hears my voice amen and
[1:32:30] opened the door that's why that's why
[1:32:32] there was no handle on the outside of
[1:32:34] the door that the art is painted
[1:32:36] you remember the story he said there's
[1:32:39] just one flaw with your pain there's no
[1:32:41] handle on the outside it's all that's
[1:32:44] the purpose of the painting that's the
[1:32:46] main point of it is there's no handle
[1:32:48] you have to open it
[1:32:50] oh Hallelujah I can't open the door for
[1:32:54] you I can't open it here come on in
[1:32:58] no you have to open it when Jesus calls
[1:33:01] out come unto me are you that labor and
[1:33:04] are heavy laden I'll give you a rest
[1:33:07] even Jesus himself will not force the
[1:33:10] door open
[1:33:11] could Jesus open the door yes
[1:33:15] sure he could he can go through the door
[1:33:17] he wanted to the dog would even have to
[1:33:19] hold me and just go through it
[1:33:21] right but he wants you to open it he he
[1:33:26] wants to call to you and let you respond
[1:33:29] back
[1:33:32] oh yeah and as soon as you open that
[1:33:36] door he's ready to come in
[1:33:38] you remember those those two
[1:33:41] um
[1:33:42] in uh Luke chapter 24 on the road to
[1:33:46] Emmaus and he went on the journey you
[1:33:48] remember and Jesus stepped out walked
[1:33:49] with them and it started talking down
[1:33:51] and they had no idea who it was like a
[1:33:54] lot of church people crossing me right
[1:33:56] in the midst speaking to you and a lot
[1:33:57] of people don't even recognize who it is
[1:33:59] finally finally after all they're
[1:34:02] they're talking the things they finally
[1:34:04] Jesus at all fools
[1:34:07] didn't you like your pastor to call you
[1:34:09] fool
[1:34:12] fool this love heart you believe all
[1:34:15] that the prophets have spoken
[1:34:18] all night Christ have suffered first he
[1:34:20] goes on and he starts he starts
[1:34:22] revealing himself what by the scripture
[1:34:25] he could just come out and said look
[1:34:27] guys I am the Messiah I race from the
[1:34:29] dead here I am
[1:34:31] but he had to take the word and the
[1:34:33] Bible say he went back and he began at
[1:34:35] Moses
[1:34:38] amen and brought up all the prophecies
[1:34:41] and the things that was concerning
[1:34:44] himself
[1:34:46] I like it he wasn't preached about
[1:34:48] somebody else he was preaching about
[1:34:50] himself
[1:34:51] and then when we preach about the end
[1:34:53] time message and the word that God has
[1:34:54] said we're preaching about ourself
[1:34:57] what God has done for us I mean I don't
[1:34:59] mean are you you understand what I mean
[1:35:00] amen we're preaching about this day the
[1:35:03] word speaks about me
[1:35:06] the Bible said I'm an overcomer
[1:35:10] I'm preaching about me you're preaching
[1:35:13] about you is that right and then when it
[1:35:15] comes to the end of the journey
[1:35:17] where they were going
[1:35:19] he made as though he would go on
[1:35:23] why he Jesus Christ is always the same
[1:35:26] in character every age
[1:35:30] I stand at the door and knock you have
[1:35:33] to open I won't force my way in they
[1:35:36] come to the end of their Road he acts
[1:35:39] like it's going to go on and they said
[1:35:40] oh Master abide with us
[1:35:43] he had to be invited
[1:35:46] and brother man said Jesus always goes
[1:35:49] where he's invited
[1:35:50] [Applause]
[1:35:51] oh that's why sometimes he would even go
[1:35:54] to places amen where the Pharisees would
[1:35:58] never go
[1:36:00] he talked to people at the Pharisees
[1:36:01] would never talk to aren't you glad
[1:36:06] he talks to prostitute
[1:36:10] drug addicts
[1:36:12] the woman at the well that's not that's
[1:36:16] what she was she had too many husbands
[1:36:18] how do you explain any other way
[1:36:20] anymore a woman
[1:36:22] and Jesus knew
[1:36:26] how his disciples were thinking he knew
[1:36:30] what they would think if they would
[1:36:31] catch him talking to a woman like that
[1:36:33] so if the Bible said he sent them away
[1:36:36] to get food
[1:36:40] and while they're away getting food he
[1:36:43] talks to the woman what
[1:36:46] he didn't finish the conversation quick
[1:36:48] enough they came back and caught him
[1:36:50] [Music]
[1:36:50] [Laughter]
[1:36:53] Hallelujah they come back the trip was a
[1:36:57] little quicker than than well not I
[1:36:59] Jesus knows all things so he of course
[1:37:01] knew but but they come back quicker than
[1:37:03] expected maybe
[1:37:05] they come up and they they hear the
[1:37:08] conversation they see the woman they
[1:37:11] know who she is
[1:37:13] they know she was
[1:37:15] and her master was talking to them
[1:37:20] yo even the decide people boss just
[1:37:26] couldn't believe it
[1:37:28] their master
[1:37:31] talking to a person like that
[1:37:34] and so they listened to the conversation
[1:37:36] for a little bit
[1:37:38] and uh
[1:37:39] he said
[1:37:40] he says go get your husband
[1:37:46] you know they they knew the story of the
[1:37:48] woman right
[1:37:49] so they're like oh my and then she says
[1:37:53] I have no husband
[1:37:57] young Johnson maybe to Peter is
[1:38:05] Wheaton told everybody that our masters
[1:38:07] never wrong
[1:38:08] that discernment that discernment is
[1:38:11] never wrong
[1:38:12] go get your husband I have no husband
[1:38:16] oh
[1:38:18] deflated
[1:38:20] like a balloon
[1:38:24] but I said you remember the next words
[1:38:26] oh I'm so glad there's always another
[1:38:29] word it's also written that's another
[1:38:33] word
[1:38:34] amen he says you have said the truth
[1:38:42] you have five
[1:38:44] and the one you're with now is not yours
[1:38:47] oh my listen that discernment never
[1:38:51] fails
[1:38:53] you remember a story
[1:38:55] about brother Brandon I'm in a meeting
[1:38:56] call out a lady
[1:39:00] and he said you live at so-and-so place
[1:39:02] and her friend that came with her to the
[1:39:04] meeting
[1:39:06] yo she knew
[1:39:08] no she don't live in she don't live at
[1:39:11] that address
[1:39:13] and she's like oh
[1:39:15] what do I do now
[1:39:17] he missed it
[1:39:19] but what you didn't know
[1:39:21] even her friend didn't know
[1:39:24] I tell you God is up to date
[1:39:27] the holy spirit is up to date
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:33] her friend didn't know that she had
[1:39:35] moved
[1:39:38] but the Holy Spirit knew it
[1:39:42] I wrote a tape this morning I believe it
[1:39:45] was preaching Cleveland Tennessee
[1:39:47] and he's come to the end and he started
[1:39:49] calling people out he he had talked
[1:39:51] about the angel that came
[1:39:55] Abraham had his back turned so he turned
[1:39:58] his back to the audience
[1:40:00] he starts talking to the people and he
[1:40:02] says think about this
[1:40:05] he's got his back to the audience and he
[1:40:08] says there's a man to my right I'm
[1:40:10] looking right at him
[1:40:12] huh
[1:40:13] there's no mirror up there
[1:40:15] right I'm looking right at him and he
[1:40:19] says you have you have such and such
[1:40:24] he says you are in Mennonite
[1:40:28] your name is Reverend Mr Miller
[1:40:31] you know I would like to ask the critics
[1:40:34] of this day that have left the message
[1:40:35] and try to tell us it's false I would
[1:40:38] like to know why out of the thousands of
[1:40:40] times
[1:40:42] that somebody on the tapes didn't raise
[1:40:44] up that that you could hear it and say
[1:40:47] ah brother Branham that is absolutely
[1:40:50] false
[1:40:53] I challenge you go look for a place
[1:40:55] where you ever hear that
[1:40:58] you will never hear it but what you will
[1:41:00] always hear is your reaction that what
[1:41:03] he told them was right
[1:41:06] and if you ever pay attention to some of
[1:41:08] those discernments in one person he
[1:41:12] sometimes names as much as 15 different
[1:41:14] things
[1:41:15] and one discernment that there's no way
[1:41:18] he could have known that
[1:41:22] that oak tree was on the left side of
[1:41:25] the driveway
[1:41:28] see we don't think about it because well
[1:41:30] I see you live here on the road curves
[1:41:32] this way and there's a tree over here
[1:41:34] the house sits over here and if you
[1:41:36] really pay attention to what he's saying
[1:41:37] there's just one thing you have to know
[1:41:38] they have to know they have another how
[1:41:40] did he know
[1:41:41] and surely if he was guessing him
[1:41:46] he's going to get something wrong
[1:41:48] probably all of it
[1:41:55] God has brought you into a place
[1:41:58] a solid meeting place
[1:42:00] God didn't call you the brother Branham
[1:42:03] he called you to himself
[1:42:07] and then Christ is our solemn meeting
[1:42:10] place
[1:42:11] hallelujah amen this message is more
[1:42:15] than justice social Gathering or just to
[1:42:18] Gathering other people together listen
[1:42:20] we're not starting another church age
[1:42:24] we are at the end of the ages of the
[1:42:27] Seven Ages and were
[1:42:29] do we go from here
[1:42:33] amen
[1:42:35] there's only seven days in a week
[1:42:38] right
[1:42:40] the Bible speaks of an eighth day
[1:42:45] oh I know we got people trying to tell
[1:42:47] us that we're now in the Eighth Day
[1:42:51] um I'm very sad to disappointed we are
[1:42:54] because I expected the age day to be
[1:42:56] something different than what the
[1:42:57] seventh was
[1:42:58] because the Bible calls this day a holy
[1:43:01] convocation
[1:43:03] you say well what's he talking about
[1:43:04] then brother Bill it's talking about
[1:43:07] eternity
[1:43:09] right
[1:43:11] Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[1:43:14] Friday Saturday
[1:43:15] what's the next day after Saturday
[1:43:18] oh we're back to the first day
[1:43:21] you know Jesus raised on the first day
[1:43:24] of the week Monday's not the first day
[1:43:26] of the week
[1:43:29] right Jesus raised on the first day of
[1:43:32] the week which was Sunday that's why we
[1:43:34] have church on Sunday to honor the
[1:43:37] resurrection and the Holy Ghost came
[1:43:39] back on the day of Pentecost
[1:43:41] right on the first day of the week
[1:43:45] that's why we have church on Sunday not
[1:43:47] Saturday
[1:43:49] amen is for us and you know what one day
[1:43:52] the Jews will recognize that
[1:43:54] but right now you haven't recognized it
[1:43:56] yet but you have been called into this
[1:44:00] holy
[1:44:01] convocation
[1:44:03] our reality a message amen
[1:44:07] listen when Jesus was at the feast amen
[1:44:10] there was very few that recognized who
[1:44:13] he was and I'll say today that is very
[1:44:16] few in this generation in this church
[1:44:18] age that recognize what this message is
[1:44:22] foreign
[1:44:24] to a lot of people it's just another
[1:44:27] you know
[1:44:29] we have our favorite scriptures you know
[1:44:31] Revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 no it's more
[1:44:35] than that
[1:44:36] yo when when Nehemiah had built the wall
[1:44:39] and and you know the wall was restored
[1:44:43] that in this chapter they come back they
[1:44:45] gathered together and they bought they
[1:44:47] brought the book
[1:44:49] yeah
[1:44:51] they brought the book part two the
[1:44:55] priests that they might read it and the
[1:44:58] Bible said that what are they going to
[1:45:01] read
[1:45:02] they went back to the law of Moses
[1:45:06] and then because that was their
[1:45:08] foundation and their worship had been
[1:45:10] restored as it was in that day but when
[1:45:14] when the wall was torn down and all that
[1:45:16] happened the Bible says that they hadn't
[1:45:19] worshiped that way since the days of
[1:45:20] Joshua
[1:45:23] but now the wall has been built up under
[1:45:25] much opposition and you are still
[1:45:29] pressing on under much opposition
[1:45:33] the world doesn't like you
[1:45:37] you realize
[1:45:39] what you believe
[1:45:40] is absolutely not politically correct
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:45] and if the world this generation
[1:45:49] especially
[1:45:50] ever really get a hold of some of the
[1:45:52] things that brother Branham said
[1:45:56] it might end it might send us to jail
[1:46:01] but good if you don't believe that I say
[1:46:06] you haven't heard very many tapes lately
[1:46:08] because everything he preached
[1:46:12] toward this church age apart
[1:46:17] the signs of the time
[1:46:20] he preached many times and shows it
[1:46:23] sounds like he preached it yesterday
[1:46:27] Hallelujah
[1:46:30] we
[1:46:32] are a rare breed
[1:46:36] hahaha
[1:46:38] Hallelujah you are a special people
[1:46:42] why because you you have been brought
[1:46:45] together up to hear the law once again
[1:46:50] in time I'm not speaking of this day
[1:46:53] your eyes have been opened what to
[1:46:55] receive the Seven Seals
[1:46:58] Amen brother Brandon said that the Seven
[1:47:00] Seals to us or or rather the law to
[1:47:04] Israel was what the Seven Seals are to
[1:47:06] us
[1:47:07] it was God's provide away when Moses
[1:47:10] gave the law that was their Foundation
[1:47:12] that was their teaching that was gospel
[1:47:14] right away
[1:47:17] and that's what brought them when Nicki
[1:47:20] Minaj the wall and brought them back
[1:47:21] that's why he went back to Moses
[1:47:24] yo people laugh at us cause oh you're so
[1:47:26] quoting that Prophet aren't you
[1:47:28] yeah which one Moses about random
[1:47:32] I'll quote both of them Paul Paul was
[1:47:35] two thousand years ago
[1:47:38] you see if it's a true prophet
[1:47:43] and take this the way I mean it if it's
[1:47:46] a true Prophet what he preaches is as
[1:47:48] good as what's in the Bible
[1:47:52] where you say that something to tell you
[1:47:55] you know what people really think you
[1:47:56] know we're not pleasing by the random
[1:47:58] above anything but if it's a war listen
[1:48:01] the word comes to the prophet
[1:48:04] and
[1:48:05] not just because we say so but because
[1:48:09] God Vindicated it okay
[1:48:12] and we are ordained to stay with the
[1:48:15] vindication
[1:48:17] because the Vindication was not just for
[1:48:19] real talking about all these things to
[1:48:21] happen but it brought us back to the
[1:48:23] word just like Nehemiah and when they
[1:48:25] read the law and everything was
[1:48:27] distorted there the name was revealed to
[1:48:30] them what tribe they they come from all
[1:48:32] these things was restored under
[1:48:34] nehemiah's Ministry Why by reading the
[1:48:37] law
[1:48:38] by reading Moses
[1:48:41] a man Moses was a man
[1:48:45] right but the word he gave was true for
[1:48:48] every generation for Israel
[1:48:50] and if you notice one of your your best
[1:48:53] known scriptures in the message Malachi
[1:48:55] 4 what does it say
[1:48:57] remember ye the law of Moses
[1:49:02] why God is getting ready to turn us back
[1:49:08] not getting ready I'm speaking you know
[1:49:11] past tense when the message came what to
[1:49:15] turn our hearts back she says Remember
[1:49:17] You The Law of Moses
[1:49:20] my servant which I commanded him in
[1:49:23] horror
[1:49:25] right and then he goes on and do I will
[1:49:28] send you lie to the prophet
[1:49:30] in other words the word will come up
[1:49:32] through every generation
[1:49:35] just like Jesus came unless and still
[1:49:38] stood up on the last day of the feast
[1:49:41] we are in the last feast
[1:49:44] and Jesus has stood up amongst us
[1:49:47] and showed himself Jesus Christ the same
[1:49:49] yesterday today and forever
[1:49:53] hallelujah we're worshiping under the
[1:49:56] Feast of Tabernacles
[1:49:59] we're worshiping under the last
[1:50:01] church-aged message
[1:50:03] and when this ends up we'll go into then
[1:50:07] we'll go into the Eighth Day spiritually
[1:50:09] speaking
[1:50:11] is that right
[1:50:13] Hallelujah God has brought what he has
[1:50:16] restored it back
[1:50:18] the word convocation means a a calling
[1:50:22] out
[1:50:24] a calling out
[1:50:28] that we've been brought to a holy
[1:50:30] convocation oh
[1:50:34] try to get a hold of it that you're not
[1:50:37] just coming to evening light Tabernacle
[1:50:40] you're not just going to a church and
[1:50:42] hearing somebody preach and yell at you
[1:50:44] and whatever or or Shake somebody's hand
[1:50:46] you've been called
[1:50:48] to a holy convocation you've been called
[1:50:52] to a place
[1:50:55] of worship
[1:50:57] reverence
[1:50:59] the presence of the Lord will bring
[1:51:01] reverence
[1:51:03] it's not the holy people
[1:51:06] it wasn't the holy God on the mountain
[1:51:11] I mean what's the holy God rather it
[1:51:14] wasn't the Holy Mountain it was the God
[1:51:15] on the mountain
[1:51:18] Hallelujah and it's not the only people
[1:51:21] it's God in the people it's the holy
[1:51:24] ghost in the people
[1:51:26] hahaha
[1:51:28] Hallelujah
[1:51:30] and man we're nothing we're dirt
[1:51:34] but saved by grace
[1:51:36] Hallelujah
[1:51:40] oh
[1:51:42] the Holy Ghost in power and it's keeping
[1:51:45] me alive it's keeping me alive I don't
[1:51:50] even know the song but it's still
[1:51:52] keeping me alive
[1:51:54] amen I know something has kept me
[1:51:57] amen what is it God
[1:52:01] God
[1:52:02] amen has come amongst us
[1:52:06] amen I'm just going to bring it to a
[1:52:07] closer I'll never get done but I know we
[1:52:11] got communion in the service just
[1:52:13] shortly after again but let me just say
[1:52:15] this morning
[1:52:16] you
[1:52:18] are called
[1:52:21] to a special place
[1:52:24] and that special place is in Jesus
[1:52:26] Christ
[1:52:28] and if you're in Jesus Christ as I said
[1:52:30] before you will do the works of Christ
[1:52:33] you'll live for Christ
[1:52:36] you'll dress like you're a Christian
[1:52:39] come on
[1:52:41] oh it's still the truth it don't matter
[1:52:43] how old he gets don't matter how few
[1:52:45] people do it it's still true
[1:52:47] you know we can we we can preach these
[1:52:49] things and you know because we can read
[1:52:50] it in the message
[1:52:52] so it's a little bit easier for us to
[1:52:54] say it because somebody already said it
[1:52:55] but you go back and put yourself in the
[1:52:58] shoes of brother Branham
[1:53:00] and what he was preaching the opposition
[1:53:02] he faced to say those things
[1:53:07] but that message opened up the way for
[1:53:09] us I say this morning God help us
[1:53:12] to stay with what he brought
[1:53:15] help us not to compromise amen young
[1:53:19] people you are an overcomer
[1:53:22] don't let the devil say you can't make
[1:53:24] it by the grace of God by the problems
[1:53:26] of God you've already made you say well
[1:53:28] I just don't feel like it I don't I feel
[1:53:30] like a loser who doesn't feel like a
[1:53:32] loser sometimes
[1:53:34] we've all felt like a loser but I don't
[1:53:37] care what we rise above the feelings and
[1:53:42] the emotions in our flesh
[1:53:44] all because greater's he that's in meat
[1:53:46] and he that's in the world is flesh
[1:53:48] there's something on the way that Jesus
[1:53:51] on the inside working to the outside
[1:53:53] making a difference
[1:53:56] if Jesus doesn't make a difference in
[1:53:58] your life you have not met him
[1:54:00] when he met the woman at the well it
[1:54:03] changed her life
[1:54:07] it changed his life
[1:54:09] One Moment In His presence and Zacchaeus
[1:54:13] said I'll make everything right whatever
[1:54:16] Iraq take it illegally up pay it back
[1:54:19] fourfold
[1:54:20] showing that he was a Jew that believed
[1:54:23] the law
[1:54:24] because that was the requirement
[1:54:27] and he immediately went up on meeting
[1:54:29] Jesus he says I will repay everything
[1:54:34] which also shows that he knew that he
[1:54:36] had he had cheated some people
[1:54:40] all right otherwise why would he be
[1:54:42] sorry oh I'll repair it he just admitted
[1:54:45] I'm guilty
[1:54:47] yeah you ask people down to a certain
[1:54:49] question you know what uh me uh what are
[1:54:52] you talking about
[1:54:55] do you know what I'm talking about
[1:54:56] you're guilty
[1:54:57] that's why you're already that's why
[1:54:59] you're acting so innocent
[1:55:02] you're covering up
[1:55:05] listen there's only one thing
[1:55:07] that will cover
[1:55:10] your sin and that's the blood of Jesus
[1:55:13] Christ
[1:55:14] how do we get him up our hands because
[1:55:17] you remember Jesus is on your hands
[1:55:20] how do you get them off
[1:55:22] by accepting them in your heart
[1:55:26] couldn't wash it off
[1:55:28] he tried to wash his hands
[1:55:30] there's no water
[1:55:33] there's no worldly entertainment
[1:55:35] there's nothing there's no religious
[1:55:37] spirit there's nothing that can wash the
[1:55:40] blood of Jesus off of your hands
[1:55:42] it's only one way to get it off
[1:55:45] say Lord I accept it in my heart
[1:55:50] hey man let's stand together don't you
[1:55:51] want to do that this morning
[1:55:53] let's accept him in our heart
[1:55:57] because he's on your hands if he's not
[1:55:59] in your heart he's on your hands

[1:57:11] them make them completely pure then that
[1:57:15] blood is still in their hands but may
