[15:10] this
[15:16] my brothers and sisters has asked us our
[15:18] please stand
[15:22] breath brad would you open us in prayer
[15:24] please
[15:58] so
[16:08] and my
[16:09] children can be dismissed with something
[16:12] ask us to open our bibles to first john
[16:15] 4.
[16:19] we'll read that whole chapter first john
[16:23] 4.
[16:36] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[16:39] the spirits whether they are of god
[16:41] because many false prophets are gone out
[16:44] into the world
[16:54] and every spirit that confesses not that
[16:56] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[16:58] not of god and that and this is that
[17:01] spirit of antichrist whereof ye have
[17:04] heard that it should come and even now
[17:06] already is in the
[17:16] world they are the world therefore speak
[17:20] they of the world and the world heareth
[17:22] them
[17:35] love
[17:36] let us love one another for love is of
[17:39] god and everyone that loveth is born of
[17:42] god and knoweth god
[17:48] and this was manifested the love of god
[17:51] toward us because that god sent his only
[17:53] begotten son into the world that we
[17:55] might live through him
[18:06] we love this god so loved us we ought
[18:09] also to love one another
[18:20] hereby know that we do well in him and
[18:23] he and us
[18:24] because he hath given us his spirit
[18:35] whosoever shall confess that jesus is
[18:37] the son of god god dwelleth in him and
[18:40] he
[18:42] and god
[18:53] aaron is our love made perfect that we
[18:55] might have boldness in the day of
[18:57] judgment because as he is so are we in
[19:00] this world
[19:11] we love him because he has first loved
[19:14] us
[19:26] last one together
[19:28] and this commandment have we from him
[19:30] that he who loveth god loveth his
[19:34] brother also brother brian
[19:49] if you return with me to romans the 13th
[19:51] chapter you know that chapter we were
[19:53] reading
[19:55] if you know if you just meditated in
[19:58] that
[19:59] chapter for days on end you would i can
[20:02] only speak for myself you would find a
[20:04] lot of the things that you hold to
[20:07] you probably wouldn't hold to them
[20:08] anymore but uh before i get started
[20:12] uh since the
[20:14] youth anklet is over and we're coming
[20:16] out of the summer i thought i hadn't
[20:18] done this in a while
[20:20] so
[20:22] i the way i do this
[20:24] i do keep some cash
[20:26] uh ready cash because i have to pay some
[20:28] instant bills and i have to give money
[20:30] to people that
[20:32] won't be able to write a check out but
[20:34] so if i were to the total available
[20:37] in the general fund as of this morning
[20:40] including that ready cash is nine
[20:42] thousand four hundred and eleven dollars
[20:44] not talking about since
[20:46] but we have some obligations out of that
[20:48] money where people have put money in
[20:50] their account for like missions and
[20:54] stuff like that cleaning and things like
[20:56] that obligations so when you take those
[20:59] obligations out that leaves right now
[21:01] the balance
[21:03] seven thousand three hundred and eleven
[21:05] dollars
[21:07] so um
[21:08] then we have a building fund that has
[21:10] about three thousand dollars in it that
[21:13] i make the building payment out as of
[21:16] this morning
[21:18] uh i figured
[21:20] principle lies in the church we have
[21:23] on left on the loan 85
[21:26] 668
[21:27] now the bank my defer with me a few
[21:30] pennies this way or that way but that's
[21:32] what's left to pay
[21:34] on the principal
[21:35] [Music]
[21:36] and as of this morning the two
[21:38] outstanding bills that i have to pay
[21:40] between now and when it gets really cold
[21:43] is uh i have to pay the insurance and i
[21:45] got the insurance bill and it's actually
[21:47] a couple of
[21:49] last year was like thirty nine hundred
[21:50] dollars this year it's actually uh
[21:53] thirty seven hundred dollars and that's
[21:55] everything that's uh the building fire
[21:58] and damage and hail and all that other
[22:00] kind of stuff and plus the liability
[22:02] insurance both on this building the
[22:04] property and the fellowship that's
[22:07] thirty seven hundred dollars for the
[22:08] year
[22:10] and then uh figuring fuel that we used
[22:12] last year i have a balance from the
[22:15] summer you know you prepay for the
[22:17] summer i have a balance of like 246
[22:21] dollars in the church account i
[22:23] i haven't met i have until the 30th of
[22:25] september to deposit money
[22:28] in that account for them to come by and
[22:30] fill the tanks up now
[22:32] last time i checked we were almost at 80
[22:34] on the big tank i hadn't checked the
[22:36] little tank in a while
[22:38] um
[22:39] but so we're starting with
[22:41] enough so i'm thinking i'll only have to
[22:43] add about 2 000 to that we should be
[22:46] right where we need to be
[22:48] if we don't have an extremely cold
[22:49] winter but the new boiler seems to be a
[22:52] little more efficient and uh it's not
[22:55] using as much fuel as the previous ones
[22:58] did
[22:59] but because of what we have in the
[23:01] general fund the seven thousand dollars
[23:04] i am not going to pay the i'm not going
[23:06] to pay them all the insurance i'll pay
[23:09] it into installments
[23:11] until the general fund builds up and
[23:13] then i'll probably pay it off
[23:15] i just don't want to
[23:17] pay that kind of money and get low in
[23:19] the general fund so i'll probably pay
[23:21] that in installments
[23:23] and then the fuel
[23:25] i'll probably add some to the fuel
[23:26] account by the end of the month so we
[23:28] have something to start the year with so
[23:31] if you got any questions
[23:33] don't be afraid to come up and ask me um
[23:36] like i said the principal is
[23:38] you know we've gone from
[23:40] our actual matu from when we started the
[23:42] loan we've gone again from
[23:45] two hundred thousand dollars down to
[23:46] eighty five thousand dollars in less
[23:48] than probably
[23:49] 2021 probably 14
[23:53] probably 16 years the loan went active
[23:56] on me i believe don't hold me to this
[23:59] because it took so long to build a
[24:00] building i think it went active like on
[24:02] 2005
[24:04] we went from a construction loan to a
[24:06] building loan so that's not really too
[24:08] bad for the amount of money
[24:09] that we had uh invested in it
[24:12] i said if you got any questions don't be
[24:14] afraid to ask me
[24:15] kind of switching here to romans 13. i
[24:17] was thinking this morning you know
[24:20] i know i don't mean to say things a lot
[24:22] the older you get i guess time goes
[24:24] faster i
[24:25] i can only testify to that you know i
[24:27] used to laugh at old men when they told
[24:29] me when i was 20 years old you wait
[24:31] until you get to be 60. i used to you
[24:33] know just like any young man i used to
[24:35] giggle when they told me that but you
[24:37] know as you get older you realize that
[24:38] they weren't lying to you and they were
[24:40] telling you the truth
[24:41] but uh
[24:43] let me turn you to the 13th chapter of
[24:45] romans
[24:47] you know that
[24:48] the world that we live in right now is a
[24:50] crazy place i don't have to tell you
[24:52] that you experience every day
[24:54] when you get out there you don't you
[24:56] don't become them but you have to be
[24:58] around them that's there's a big
[24:59] difference between the two but it's hard
[25:01] not to see the way the world is going
[25:04] and i was thinking this morning
[25:06] i'm gonna read this chapter here but
[25:09] what happened
[25:10] after rome fell in in the third century
[25:14] happened in a certain area which was the
[25:16] mediterranean area the whole world went
[25:18] into darkness after rome fell because
[25:21] there wasn't a central government to
[25:23] maintain the roads and to maintain the
[25:25] things that the romans did so the world
[25:28] went into darkness in a in that area but
[25:30] now we're in 2021
[25:33] and scripturally it's not just that area
[25:36] the whole world
[25:38] when everything falls is going to go
[25:39] into darkness and it's it's pretty
[25:42] pretty
[25:44] painful for those that are going to be
[25:46] in that darkness with what's happening
[25:48] you know
[25:49] you know it only took a few german
[25:51] tribes to collapse the whole roman
[25:53] empire and we're doing it to ourselves
[25:55] internally so let me read this chapter
[25:58] here
[26:00] it starts starting at this first verse
[26:02] it says let every soul be subject on to
[26:04] the higher powers for there's no power
[26:06] but of god the powers that be are
[26:08] ordained of god and whosoever therefore
[26:11] resists the power resists the ordinance
[26:13] of god
[26:14] and they that resist shall receive to
[26:17] themselves damnation and i was thinking
[26:19] what's going on out there in the world
[26:22] is there pulling people to the left
[26:24] they're pulling them to the right
[26:26] so they don't trust authority anymore
[26:28] they don't have any confidence and
[26:30] authority and the minute you use you
[26:32] know like the brother browner said that
[26:34] you lose confidence in your pastor then
[26:36] you're in a pretty bad place because you
[26:38] don't know if you're being told the
[26:40] truth
[26:40] you know you're in a bad spot well it's
[26:42] the same thing in a national sense if
[26:45] you don't have any confidence in your
[26:46] government and the people that lead you
[26:49] then you don't then it's a bad place to
[26:51] be and it goes on to say for rulers and
[26:54] not a terror to good works but to the
[26:56] evil both thou now not be afraid of
[26:59] power do that which is good and thou
[27:00] shalt have praise of the same so as we
[27:03] start every morning you know brother
[27:04] brown told us the scriptures tell us no
[27:07] matter what the situation out there in
[27:09] the world is
[27:10] it gives me no right to treat people in
[27:13] a bad light or in a bad way you always
[27:15] have to treat people the way you would
[27:16] want to be treated and he goes on for he
[27:19] is the minister of god
[27:21] for to thee for good but if thou do thou
[27:23] which is evil be afraid for he beareth
[27:25] not the sword in vain
[27:27] for he is the minister of god or revenge
[27:30] to execute wrath upon them to do with
[27:32] evil
[27:33] wherefore you must need to be subject
[27:35] not only for wrath
[27:37] but also for conscience sake
[27:39] now you can look at this in two
[27:40] different ways it it does deal with us
[27:43] as christians that we should be in
[27:45] subjection to the holy ghost and into
[27:48] the rule that god puts over us but also
[27:51] in the other sense
[27:52] christians shouldn't be carrying guns
[27:54] and trying to overflow their government
[27:56] also at the same time and it goes on
[27:59] today for this cause pay you tribute
[28:00] also for they are god's ministers
[28:03] attending
[28:04] continually upon this very thing
[28:06] render therefore to their duties tribute
[28:09] to which tribute is due custom to its
[28:12] custom fear with whom fear honor to whom
[28:15] honor oh no man anything but love one
[28:18] another for he that loveth another are
[28:20] fulfilled with law
[28:21] for this thou shalt you know i think i'm
[28:24] not trying to be funny here i think of
[28:26] this scripture right here and and
[28:28] our country right now they're you know
[28:30] that that is
[28:33] is totally opposed to that scripture
[28:35] even even jesus and paul said if you
[28:38] don't work you shouldn't eat you know
[28:40] the whole concept of what we have out
[28:42] there in the world has just gone totally
[28:45] crazy
[28:46] and he goes on to say for this thus will
[28:48] not commit adultery thou shall not kill
[28:50] thou shall not steal thou shalt not bear
[28:53] false witness thou shalt not covet if
[28:55] there be any other commandments it is
[28:58] briefly comprehending this saying namely
[29:01] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[29:04] and you know that's a golden rule this
[29:05] morning
[29:06] if you can't love yourself how can you
[29:08] love someone else and the only way you
[29:10] can love yourself and i say this a lot
[29:13] is that you have a relationship with
[29:15] jesus christ if you don't come into a
[29:17] relationship you're going to always
[29:18] question your character you're always
[29:20] going to question what you're doing or
[29:22] what you're not doing and he goes on to
[29:24] say here love worketh no will to his
[29:27] neighbors therefore love is fulfilling
[29:29] the law
[29:30] and and that knowing the time that now
[29:33] is not high time to wake out of sleep
[29:36] for now our salvation is nearer than
[29:38] when we believed you know that kind of
[29:40] speaks to what brother thomas was
[29:42] talking about on wednesday night brother
[29:45] brother luke and all the ministers that
[29:47] you know it's a it's later than we think
[29:49] right now i mean the world and the
[29:52] darkness that out there keeps thinking
[29:53] you have another week or another year
[29:56] but the scripture says something
[29:58] different
[29:58] the night is far spent and the day is at
[30:01] hand let us therefore cast off the works
[30:03] of darkness and let us put on the armor
[30:06] of the light let us walk honestly as in
[30:09] the day not in rioting and drunkenness
[30:11] not in chambering unwantedness not in
[30:13] strife and envy
[30:15] but excuse me but if you
[30:18] but if
[30:19] but put ye on the lord jesus christ and
[30:21] make not provisions for the flesh to
[30:24] fulfill the lust thereof and i was going
[30:26] to jump over here
[30:31] i could read titus 2 but i'll just jump
[30:33] over and sit down in these few
[30:35] scriptures my point being this morning
[30:39] is that the only thing we have
[30:40] confidence in this morning
[30:42] is the word of god
[30:44] if you're trying
[30:45] i know i say that a lot i don't mean to
[30:47] say things a lot
[30:48] but you know uh being in the old soldier
[30:50] i am it's always the fundamentals that
[30:53] people forget and it's the same thing
[30:55] for christians you have to know your
[30:56] fundamentals you have to you have to do
[30:59] your fundamentals every day of your life
[31:01] to be successful if you forget your
[31:03] fundamentals
[31:04] then you're not going to be successful
[31:06] and brother branham gave us those
[31:08] fundamentals the abc's always believe
[31:11] christ
[31:12] read your bible and pray every day those
[31:14] are simple fundamentals that you have to
[31:16] do read your bible a plot you know you
[31:19] can just read it all you want but you
[31:20] have to apply it to your life because
[31:22] god leads you you have to apply it and
[31:25] let me
[31:27] go here and i'll read a few of these
[31:28] scriptures is in my
[31:30] chain reference bible you know
[31:32] years ago the guy i used to drive my
[31:34] guys crazy because that's how the kind
[31:36] of guy i was
[31:37] you know if they weren't doing the
[31:38] fundamentals we stopped everything and
[31:40] they'd say well we're well past that
[31:42] well if you're not dealing with the
[31:44] fundamentals you're not doing the right
[31:45] thing at the right time then all this
[31:47] big stuff you want to do doesn't mean
[31:49] anything you still have to do the same
[31:52] thing every day and read your bible pray
[31:55] and always believe christ
[31:56] and uh
[31:58] some of the scriptures that deal with
[32:00] this
[32:01] are psalms 34 the 14th verse depart from
[32:04] evil and do good seek peace and pursue
[32:06] it and then it goes to what brother
[32:08] thomas was saying and what the 119th
[32:11] psalm says
[32:13] you know if you're going the wrong
[32:14] direction you got to turn around and go
[32:16] back the other way it's pretty simple
[32:18] and psalm 37 and 3
[32:21] trust in the lord do good and thou shalt
[32:24] dwell on the land and verily thou shall
[32:26] be fed and luke the 6th chapter and the
[32:29] 35th verse
[32:31] but love ye your enemies
[32:33] and do good and and lend hoping for
[32:36] nothing again for your war shall be
[32:38] great and you shall be the children of
[32:41] of the highest and
[32:44] for for he is kind on to the unthankful
[32:46] and to the evil you know that's
[32:48] sometimes hard for us to fathom you know
[32:50] when we see evil people getting good
[32:52] things i mean it shouldn't bother a
[32:55] christian but sometimes that bothers
[32:57] people when they see evil people good
[33:00] things happening to them but god said
[33:02] right here he sends goodness to the lead
[33:04] and the tariffs at the same time
[33:06] you shouldn't struck we don't meet a
[33:08] struggle over that we just need to do
[33:10] what god tells us to do and then in
[33:12] hebrews the 13th chapter and the 16th
[33:15] verse but do but do good and communicate
[33:18] forget not for which
[33:20] such sacrifice god as well please
[33:23] and then james therefore to him that
[33:25] knoweth to do good and dealth it not to
[33:28] him it is sin and we don't want to be in
[33:30] that place this morning
[33:32] when brother david comes up like i said
[33:34] if you got any questions
[33:36] about the general fund don't be afraid
[33:38] to ask me
[33:40] brother david
[33:56] you love him with all your heart let's
[33:58] stand and sing that more than ever

[1:09:26] amen and amen
[1:09:28] amen let's turn if you will
[1:09:30] to matthew 16
[1:09:33] amen matthew 16
[1:09:40] actually 19 go to 19th chapter
[1:09:43] matthew 19.
[1:09:50] amen want to speak on kind of a
[1:09:54] basic a basic lesson this morning but
[1:09:57] it's just what i felt like the lord laid
[1:09:59] on heart to speak on so that's what
[1:10:01] we'll do amen
[1:10:02] you never know you know we may have
[1:10:04] heard something
[1:10:05] a half a dozen or dozen times but maybe
[1:10:08] maybe maybe there's somebody that needs
[1:10:10] it right and so you just never know what
[1:10:12] the lord will do it's always just to
[1:10:14] follow the leading of the spirit isn't
[1:10:16] that right
[1:10:17] matthew 19 and we'll begin with verse
[1:10:20] 16.
[1:10:24] and behold one came and said unto him
[1:10:27] good master
[1:10:28] what good things shall i do that i may
[1:10:31] inherit that i may have eternal life
[1:10:35] and he said unto him
[1:10:37] why call us down me good
[1:10:39] there is none good but one that is god
[1:10:42] but if thou will enter into life keep
[1:10:44] the commandments
[1:10:46] and he said unto him which and jesus
[1:10:49] said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt
[1:10:51] not commit adultery thou shalt not steal
[1:10:54] thou shalt not bear false witness
[1:10:57] honor thy father and thy mother and i
[1:10:59] shall love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:11:02] the young man saith unto him
[1:11:04] all these things have i kept from my
[1:11:06] youth up
[1:11:08] what lack i yet amen amen another
[1:11:13] question we could all ask ourselves
[1:11:15] amen what do i like lord amen
[1:11:18] you might not like what he tells you but
[1:11:21] i think it's a good question amen
[1:11:24] and jesus said unto the unto him if thou
[1:11:27] wilt be perfect go and sell it thou has
[1:11:29] and give to the poor and thou shalt have
[1:11:31] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[1:11:34] me
[1:11:35] but the young man heard that saying and
[1:11:37] he went away sorrowful for he had great
[1:11:39] possessions down in verse bubble picked
[1:11:42] up maybe 27 a little bit later may god
[1:11:44] had his blessings to the reading of the
[1:11:46] word you can be seated brother branham
[1:11:48] he used this message here when he uh
[1:11:50] preached on investments amen and he
[1:11:53] talked about this young businessman
[1:11:55] and this no doubt but that he had gotten
[1:11:58] rich this was a rich young ruler and so
[1:12:00] forth and he was no doubt as the prophet
[1:12:02] said he was a businessman he was used to
[1:12:05] making deals used to trading and and so
[1:12:08] forth and so he knew what it was like to
[1:12:12] uh you know but he had this thing in his
[1:12:14] heart to where he realized that all of
[1:12:16] these things
[1:12:17] you know they're all temporal the law
[1:12:19] passed away and he really desired to
[1:12:22] have one more thing and that is eternal
[1:12:24] life
[1:12:25] amen
[1:12:26] eternal life and so he was
[1:12:29] you know he was trying to figure out
[1:12:30] just how he might get it
[1:12:32] and it was quite something he said what
[1:12:34] good thing must i do that i may have
[1:12:38] eternal life
[1:12:40] and
[1:12:41] jesus finally you know and it's quite
[1:12:44] something that jesus went down through
[1:12:46] this here and i don't think he mentioned
[1:12:48] all of the ten commandments but he
[1:12:50] mentions a lot of them and no doubt but
[1:12:52] jesus knew exactly
[1:12:54] what to say amen and what kind of a
[1:12:57] answer to give him and say do this and
[1:12:59] this and this maybe maybe let's presume
[1:13:02] maybe this morning that maybe there was
[1:13:04] a few of them that he uh uh didn't keep
[1:13:08] but these here that he mentions
[1:13:10] this young man can say ah you know i
[1:13:13] kept every one of them
[1:13:15] you know i kept all of them i've done
[1:13:17] all of that
[1:13:18] you know and then
[1:13:20] then he says you know there's one one
[1:13:22] more thing all the things of a dot but
[1:13:25] this one more thing that you like
[1:13:28] and then he says go and sell all that
[1:13:32] you have give to the poor
[1:13:34] amen and i shall have treasure in heaven
[1:13:38] so jesus was basically making him a deal
[1:13:41] pack and now he was making a deal and
[1:13:43] when you think about it you know uh you
[1:13:45] know it doesn't matter whether it's
[1:13:46] business how many knows that no matter
[1:13:49] what avenue or channel that you're
[1:13:52] talking about whether you're talking
[1:13:53] about a boss when you're talking about a
[1:13:55] master when you're talking about a
[1:13:57] businessman
[1:13:58] jesus god
[1:14:00] is the master of it all
[1:14:03] he's a master businessman he's a master
[1:14:06] deal maker amen
[1:14:08] amen and so he says here
[1:14:10] he knew where his problem was he knew
[1:14:12] that his the things that he possessed
[1:14:15] mean meant more to him
[1:14:18] than uh that than eternal life
[1:14:22] now
[1:14:23] let me tell you something this young man
[1:14:25] he did
[1:14:26] you know
[1:14:27] that was not can we say this that was
[1:14:29] not
[1:14:30] a good deal that he did
[1:14:33] this young man was a very he made a very
[1:14:35] foolish deal
[1:14:38] very foolish deal to think that his
[1:14:40] possessions were worth more than eternal
[1:14:44] life
[1:14:46] not very smart businessman is he
[1:14:48] not very smart businessman amen
[1:14:52] different times talking about amen
[1:14:54] insurance assurance and selling
[1:14:56] insurance and different ones you know
[1:14:58] because people do want an assurance of
[1:15:00] eternal life
[1:15:01] it meant this man wanted and he wanted
[1:15:03] eternal life but you know he was not
[1:15:06] willing to give what he was supposed to
[1:15:08] give it was a can we say it was a good
[1:15:10] deal
[1:15:11] i don't know about you but i don't care
[1:15:13] if i would be completely broke i don't
[1:15:15] care if it costs my farm i don't care if
[1:15:17] it costs me everything i possess i would
[1:15:20] gladly say you can have it
[1:15:25] are you with me this morning you can
[1:15:26] have it
[1:15:28] because there is nothing as valuable as
[1:15:31] what
[1:15:33] your soul
[1:15:35] your soul there is nothing of equivalent
[1:15:38] that's worth as much of what your soul
[1:15:40] is we sit here folks and we just take so
[1:15:42] much for granted amen of what we possess
[1:15:45] the most valuable possession that you
[1:15:47] and i have
[1:15:49] is your life
[1:15:50] it's your soul
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:55] i want to read another one
[1:15:57] over in matthew 16 now
[1:16:00] and uh
[1:16:09] jesus says this this way in uh
[1:16:11] verse 24 of chapter 16.
[1:16:16] let's go back to 24 yeah then send jesus
[1:16:18] unto his disciples
[1:16:20] he said if any man will come after me
[1:16:24] let him deny himself
[1:16:26] take up his cross and follow me
[1:16:30] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:16:33] lose it
[1:16:34] i want to talk about making trades
[1:16:37] we'll talk about
[1:16:38] making trades all right
[1:16:40] and whosoever will
[1:16:42] lose his life for my sake shall find it
[1:16:45] amen
[1:16:46] for what is it it profited
[1:16:49] if he shall gain the whole world and
[1:16:53] lose his own soul
[1:16:55] in other words what kind of deal is if
[1:16:58] you
[1:16:58] gain the whole world but you lose your
[1:17:02] soul
[1:17:04] oh my we're going to talk about that for
[1:17:07] a minute the value of our soul the value
[1:17:10] of our life
[1:17:15] amen
[1:17:16] folks i don't care if you flip
[1:17:18] motorcycles upside down three or four
[1:17:20] times i don't care if you go to the x
[1:17:22] games due to all these things if that's
[1:17:23] what you want to do
[1:17:25] but one thing you do before that is make
[1:17:27] sure your soul is secure
[1:17:32] because uh you know otherwise you are
[1:17:35] very very very very foolish right
[1:17:38] because your risk in your very life
[1:17:41] amen just a temporal life and that
[1:17:43] temporal life if you haven't surrendered
[1:17:45] that to god that's all it is you're
[1:17:47] going to lose even that temporary life
[1:17:50] but if you are forfeit your temporary
[1:17:53] life this life that we have god always
[1:17:56] calls for a sacrifice
[1:17:58] god is not going to give you something
[1:18:00] now we know that
[1:18:02] salvation is free but he still has many
[1:18:04] requirements that he requires of us if
[1:18:07] we're going to receive what he's already
[1:18:09] paid for
[1:18:11] it don't come cheap it don't come free
[1:18:14] don't kid yourself it don't
[1:18:18] oh my
[1:18:19] folks how many knows how many live long
[1:18:21] to know that when somebody tells you
[1:18:23] someone tries to tell you something for
[1:18:25] free you know i just back away you lying
[1:18:28] i just don't believe it hardly at all
[1:18:32] why because oh you can go on this freeze
[1:18:34] cruise and you can throw in this free
[1:18:36] desk yeah right
[1:18:38] you know it ain't free that's gonna cost
[1:18:40] you but listen and with salvation with
[1:18:43] christ he already said many places if
[1:18:45] you're not willing to forsake your own
[1:18:48] life also then there's not gonna be no
[1:18:51] deal
[1:18:54] no deal
[1:18:56] we wouldn't talk about because the devil
[1:18:58] made a deal with jesus
[1:19:00] the devil's made a deal with jesus jesus
[1:19:02] had to make a deal with it you know
[1:19:04] whether he had made a deal he didn't he
[1:19:06] didn't make a deal with him but he was
[1:19:08] offered a deal by the devil
[1:19:12] amen so we see this and here he says
[1:19:14] listen what is it prophet and that's
[1:19:15] just to sum the whole thing up if the
[1:19:18] man
[1:19:19] prospers this rich man if he has
[1:19:21] everything brother down one place he
[1:19:23] says you know if jesus come down and he
[1:19:25] told me look i'm gonna turn you back to
[1:19:28] a 20 year old man and then you're going
[1:19:30] to be in the prime of your youth that
[1:19:32] will make you the king of the whole
[1:19:34] earth for a ten thousand years
[1:19:42] i'm quiet because i want that to sink in
[1:19:46] perfect 20 years old
[1:19:48] the prime of your life the king of the
[1:19:50] earth and he says everything go good not
[1:19:53] like it's gone nowadays we wouldn't want
[1:19:54] to be the king
[1:19:57] oh my we'd resign quickly
[1:20:00] who's going to be the president i
[1:20:02] wouldn't want to be the president for
[1:20:03] nothing
[1:20:05] huh
[1:20:06] folks i'll tell you what
[1:20:08] you ought to be happy
[1:20:10] you have got to deal with all that i
[1:20:12] pity our congressman don't you i pity
[1:20:14] all them guys
[1:20:15] they ain't a terrible body they got
[1:20:18] terrible jobs
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:23] but listen so you think about this we
[1:20:25] think about this young man we think
[1:20:26] about how did he have all these worldly
[1:20:28] possessions and where is he today
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:33] he's somewhere saying boy i was stupid
[1:20:37] well that was a terrible deal that i
[1:20:38] made i made many deals that i prospered
[1:20:41] i got rich i had to build bigger barns i
[1:20:43] had to do all of
[1:20:44] that huh
[1:20:48] so my thought and my my
[1:20:51] title is this morning is on exchanges
[1:20:54] exchanges
[1:20:57] we have to make an exchange
[1:21:00] how many believes yet you have to make
[1:21:01] an exchange
[1:21:03] god wants to make an exchange with you
[1:21:07] he wants you to candid your old tattered
[1:21:10] garment am i right and he'll give you a
[1:21:13] robe of pure white
[1:21:15] give him a give him a life of serving
[1:21:18] the devil now how many knows that when
[1:21:20] it comes to a boss and a master and so
[1:21:23] forth and amen we know that if you serve
[1:21:25] god it's one way if you serve the devil
[1:21:29] he rewards you too
[1:21:32] but most of the time he'll reward you
[1:21:35] with be ending up in the gutter
[1:21:37] somewhere
[1:21:39] and dying in a gutter somewhere and
[1:21:42] he'll leave you laying there and laugh
[1:21:44] at you as you're laying there
[1:21:46] that's how the devil rewards you
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:52] but god
[1:21:54] amen he lifts you up out of all of that
[1:21:58] if any man come after me you know let
[1:22:01] him deny himself take up his cross and
[1:22:04] follow me jesus said if a man come after
[1:22:07] me and hate not his own father mother
[1:22:09] brother sister he is not what worthy of
[1:22:12] me
[1:22:17] unless you're willing to you've heard
[1:22:19] you've heard the phrase saying that you
[1:22:21] know what we need to do is to sell out
[1:22:26] to sell out completely to god
[1:22:29] you know this morning i'm convinced no
[1:22:31] doubt when i look at this i look at
[1:22:33] myself and i look at the congregation
[1:22:35] here and i see where we're at and i
[1:22:37] thank god for the for the progress that
[1:22:40] i've seen here with every individual in
[1:22:42] here
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:47] that's right because a lot of you you'll
[1:22:49] call me you'll text me you'll do this
[1:22:51] out of the other and i can tell by those
[1:22:54] things of whether or not god is working
[1:22:56] in your life
[1:22:57] and which way you're going and whenever
[1:22:59] i see that people are progressing and
[1:23:01] getting closer to god i thank god for
[1:23:03] that
[1:23:04] if it wasn't for that it'd be real
[1:23:06] discouraging
[1:23:09] isn't that right
[1:23:11] but to see that people are getting
[1:23:13] closer to god and i mean they're not so
[1:23:15] much worried about the things of the
[1:23:16] world
[1:23:19] they made character is being built
[1:23:22] to see our character that we're not the
[1:23:24] characters god forbid
[1:23:26] that we used to be
[1:23:29] oh boy
[1:23:31] i mean as we look back we thought 15 20
[1:23:34] years we said my lord i was a character
[1:23:37] back then
[1:23:40] hey i'm the first one i was a character
[1:23:44] you know
[1:23:46] if i didn't like you i'd invite them
[1:23:48] double doors to swing open and don't let
[1:23:50] the door hit you on the way out
[1:23:55] but i've kind of you know tried to be a
[1:23:56] little more patient than that with
[1:23:57] people nowadays
[1:23:59] realizing maybe sometimes i ought to be
[1:24:00] doing the walking dead amen
[1:24:04] but listen folks let me just tell you
[1:24:05] how many knows that we're saying god
[1:24:07] help us
[1:24:08] keep exchanging amen ourselves for him
[1:24:11] is what we want
[1:24:12] this man was not very smart he was not
[1:24:14] very wise
[1:24:16] god has been making deals with people
[1:24:18] the whole time he's the best businessman
[1:24:20] ever was

[1:24:31] i'll accept you is that a deal
[1:24:34] no right and cain because of his
[1:24:37] jealousy and his hatred didn't want the
[1:24:39] deal

[1:24:44] could be in heaven with cane
[1:24:50] y'all agreed now
[1:24:52] we could be in heaven with cain
[1:24:57] he was made the offer all he had to do
[1:24:59] was take it

[1:25:05] why because he had treated man he wanted
[1:25:08] to people love their anger they love
[1:25:10] their jealousy they laugh they hate to
[1:25:12] turn somebody else they don't want to
[1:25:14] get rid of it
[1:25:16] he didn't want to get rid of it he sure
[1:25:17] wasn't going to repent he didn't want to
[1:25:19] say i was wrong i know
[1:25:21] people
[1:25:22] lots of people go to hell because they
[1:25:24] never want to say i'm wrong

[1:25:33] that right

[1:27:20] there is an afterlife
[1:27:24] yeah
[1:27:26] oh my too late to tell me now
[1:27:28] we've done bad people go over there come
[1:27:30] back and tell us how it is
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:34] we've had people going to the reasons of
[1:27:35] the loss tell you whatever you do don't
[1:27:38] go down that way
[1:27:39] [Music]
[1:27:42] don't go there
[1:27:44] it's atheism it's what it is
[1:27:47] somebody put another sign up further
[1:27:49] down the road
[1:27:51] disregard the first sign it's a lie
[1:27:53] there is a life after death
[1:27:58] that's right
[1:28:02] aren't you glad though
[1:28:04] man if we only had hope in this life
[1:28:06] we'd be of all people most miserable
[1:28:09] ain't no way that this great god and
[1:28:11] what he is and how he has created
[1:28:12] everything amen that you put it down
[1:28:14] here like a bunch of dogs and cats and
[1:28:17] animals without a soul that just died
[1:28:19] that's all there is to it that's not how
[1:28:20] it is
[1:28:22] aren't you glad that the lord saved you
[1:28:25] that he showed you that oh you know
[1:28:27] because if it would have been up to them
[1:28:28] we'd all think that we come from a bunch
[1:28:30] of monkeys
[1:28:32] evolution and so forth
[1:28:35] oh my
[1:28:37] but people will sell their soul
[1:28:42] for riches
[1:28:44] they'll sell their eternal life
[1:28:48] their very soul that's the most
[1:28:50] treasured thing that we have
[1:28:52] is the fact that god chose
[1:28:54] you to life
[1:28:58] how many knows i'm just glad that god
[1:28:59] chose you
[1:29:00] to live
[1:29:04] and that's the most valuable valuable
[1:29:06] possession
[1:29:08] that you have
[1:29:12] and sometimes we'll go to a restaurant
[1:29:16] i'll never forget to go on pizza hut
[1:29:19] i think it was brother bruce
[1:29:20] and a pizza hut with brother bruce and
[1:29:23] he pulled up something out of that
[1:29:24] cheese and it was a used band-aid
[1:29:30] that's pretty bad ate it
[1:29:34] because you know me i just threw that
[1:29:35] piece out later on
[1:29:39] i'm lying to you
[1:29:41] we need to eat no more after that right
[1:29:43] you knew i wouldn't do that
[1:29:46] that's right that's it right ain't gonna
[1:29:48] eat no more that and we'll listen we're
[1:29:51] so careful about what we feed this body
[1:29:55] but then we're not so careful about what
[1:29:57] the devil puts in our head
[1:29:59] puts in our mind puts in our heart
[1:30:02] and how we feed on god
[1:30:05] i only ask you something how many knows
[1:30:07] come unto me all ye
[1:30:08] no it's a uh
[1:30:10] uh talk about
[1:30:12] let me see here just a minute
[1:30:15] let me read the scriptures here
[1:30:25] um hold on a second
[1:30:27] i'll find it here
[1:30:31] john six yeah i'm in the wrong book
[1:30:34] john six
[1:30:40] we just
[1:30:41] are so careful i don't know about you
[1:30:42] but i am
[1:30:43] i don't like to eat just anything
[1:30:45] if i can possibly help it and jesus said
[1:30:49] listen
[1:30:50] he said
[1:30:53] in verse 26 of saint john 6 he said
[1:30:55] jesus answered them and said very very
[1:30:58] verily i say unto you you seek me not
[1:31:01] you seek me not because you saw the
[1:31:03] miracles but because you did eat of the
[1:31:05] loaves and were filled
[1:31:08] i mean those are so many people that are
[1:31:10] just there
[1:31:11] to get the natural things the natural
[1:31:13] blessings of god
[1:31:15] but jesus says labor not for the meat
[1:31:17] which perishes
[1:31:19] but for the meat which endureth unto
[1:31:21] everlasting life which the son of man
[1:31:24] shall give unto you
[1:31:26] amen muhammad believes that god has
[1:31:28] bread for us to eat
[1:31:31] he has meat for us to eat our spirits
[1:31:35] now i want to ask you a real
[1:31:38] stickler of a question
[1:31:40] how many knows that revelation is the
[1:31:42] believer's food
[1:31:44] broadband said pray for revelation more
[1:31:46] than anything else in the world
[1:31:48] i mean we'll come to church a pastor
[1:31:50] will have a revelation he'll have
[1:31:51] something that he feeds the people and
[1:31:53] you'll go out and say what wasn't that
[1:31:54] good i really enjoyed that
[1:31:57] but they're the last time you enjoy it
[1:31:58] until you come back next sunday or
[1:32:00] wednesday
[1:32:01] huh are you with me my question is when
[1:32:04] if jesus and we know that god wants to
[1:32:06] feed us spiritually
[1:32:09] and that right he wants to feed us
[1:32:11] spiritually i believe just like i said
[1:32:13] that the lord talks to us all the time
[1:32:16] but we don't hear him
[1:32:18] i believe jesus wants to feed us all the
[1:32:21] time
[1:32:22] but we aren't
[1:32:24] hungry don't raise your hand but in my
[1:32:27] heart tell me if you don't need a fresh
[1:32:30] revelation from god
[1:32:32] if you don't need some fresh meat from
[1:32:34] god to say the lord spoke with me about
[1:32:37] this he spoke to me about that or
[1:32:39] whatever it is that that you need
[1:32:41] talking to and then he showed me this
[1:32:43] and i'm feeding on the spirit of food
[1:32:46] that god has for me
[1:32:48] remember the spiritual food wasn't just
[1:32:50] startup it meant to put in a freezer for
[1:32:54] the same storage it was meant for us to
[1:32:56] feed on to eat
[1:32:58] to feed our soul
[1:33:02] amen how many beliefs we need more of it
[1:33:04] i believe every one of us could admit i
[1:33:06] need more of that spiritual food how
[1:33:09] many needs more of that spiritual food
[1:33:13] amen
[1:33:15] we need more spiritual food in due
[1:33:17] season amen
[1:33:20] praise the lord you love him this
[1:33:21] morning
[1:33:24] all right we're going to take our time
[1:33:26] this morning
[1:33:27] i hope that's okay with you amen
[1:33:33] let's read another one in luke 12. in
[1:33:36] luke 12
[1:33:39] jesus had a couple people come to him
[1:33:40] and
[1:33:42] so forth and wanting to want to want to
[1:33:44] have a
[1:33:45] mediator
[1:33:47] for dividing their inheritance so forth
[1:33:50] in chapter 12 verse 14 and he said unto
[1:33:53] him man
[1:33:55] all right
[1:33:57] first time i heard jesus talk about his
[1:33:59] man
[1:34:00] man who made me a judge or a divider
[1:34:04] over you
[1:34:05] and he said unto them
[1:34:07] take heed
[1:34:08] and beware
[1:34:10] of covetousness
[1:34:13] how many believes that something we got
[1:34:15] to do here in this layout is the age
[1:34:16] every one of us you have to be careful
[1:34:20] of covetousness
[1:34:23] like i said wednesday there is
[1:34:25] everything out there all the dainties
[1:34:27] and the delicious things and all that
[1:34:30] there is is out there
[1:34:32] before you know it you can want those
[1:34:35] things and your soul lusts after those
[1:34:37] things
[1:34:38] more than it longs after god
[1:34:40] gets so busy with covetousness until
[1:34:43] your
[1:34:44] your soul
[1:34:45] amen is skinny
[1:34:47] no hallelujah no amen no praise no no
[1:34:50] preach it brother preach it brother luke
[1:34:53] there's no zeal there anymore
[1:34:57] folks i try to when i try to when i say
[1:35:00] it i try to get into the service
[1:35:02] hey man i don't come here just to
[1:35:04] spectate
[1:35:05] and then when he says something worthy
[1:35:07] we all clap we all ain't been clapping
[1:35:10] that's a that's a receiving that's the
[1:35:11] truth brother
[1:35:13] amen
[1:35:16] that's right but we guess we could be so
[1:35:18] we can be have to be careful of
[1:35:19] covetousness
[1:35:22] for a man's life consists not in the
[1:35:25] abundance of things which he possesses
[1:35:30] your life has got nothing to do with
[1:35:34] what you have
[1:35:37] are you with me this morning
[1:35:39] your life is whether or not it is sealed
[1:35:41] in god and preserved in god
[1:35:44] for eternity
[1:35:50] that's what he came to do remember i
[1:35:52] came to give my children eternal life
[1:35:55] and to raise him up at the last
[1:35:57] day the purpose of christ's coming was
[1:35:59] that he we might have eternal life
[1:36:04] how many knows a lot of times we trade
[1:36:05] the holy ghost
[1:36:07] we'll trade the holy ghost for a temper
[1:36:10] we'll trade the holy ghost for gossip
[1:36:14] we'll trade to go holy ghost because we
[1:36:15] just simply don't have time to pray
[1:36:18] too much interest in other things
[1:36:20] amen
[1:36:23] exchange it we exchange it
[1:36:25] ma
[1:36:27] so now notice does not not of the
[1:36:29] abundance of things she possesses and he
[1:36:32] spake a parable unto them saying
[1:36:36] a certain age was rich if i may re-read
[1:36:40] this a little bit
[1:36:41] a certain ground of a certain rich man
[1:36:44] brought forth plentifully
[1:36:46] and he thought within himself saying
[1:36:48] what shall i do because i have no room
[1:36:50] where to bestow my fruits
[1:36:52] and he said this will i do i will pull
[1:36:54] down my barns i will build greater and
[1:36:56] there will i bestow all my fruits and
[1:36:59] all my
[1:37:00] goods
[1:37:02] i will say to my soul soul
[1:37:04] that's much good laid up for many years
[1:37:07] take that ease
[1:37:09] and be merry
[1:37:11] for god's and god said unto him thou
[1:37:14] fool
[1:37:15] huh
[1:37:17] this night thy
[1:37:19] soul shall be required of thee
[1:37:21] then who shall those things be which
[1:37:23] thou has provided
[1:37:26] so is he that layeth up treasure for
[1:37:28] himself and is not rich towards god
[1:37:33] therefore i say unto you take no thought
[1:37:35] for your life
[1:37:37] what you shall eat or for the body of
[1:37:39] what yes you shall put on
[1:37:41] now here's the point i want to get to
[1:37:43] the life is more than meat and the body
[1:37:47] is more than raiment
[1:37:50] amen it's not about what you have and
[1:37:53] it's not about the clothes that you wear
[1:37:56] but it's what's down
[1:37:59] in here that's important
[1:38:01] that's what jesus was saying think about
[1:38:04] this down here
[1:38:06] oh my people don't
[1:38:09] people don't think about it
[1:38:11] our thinking of of god and all that he
[1:38:14] is and how that he has created
[1:38:15] everything and how that the people
[1:38:17] nowadays are worshiping
[1:38:20] the creation
[1:38:22] more than the creator
[1:38:24] if we aren't careful we will get caught
[1:38:27] up and we will like what he has made
[1:38:30] and worship it
[1:38:32] but put it before god if we aren't
[1:38:34] careful
[1:38:35] that right
[1:38:36] we put we put the things that he has
[1:38:39] made the things that we have to have
[1:38:41] before god
[1:38:43] i don't know about you but i believe he
[1:38:45] is worthy when we come to church we come
[1:38:47] here to worship him in spirit and in
[1:38:51] truth we come to i love him and adore
[1:38:54] him
[1:38:56] i thought about that i was singing that
[1:38:57] song when i was thinking about this this
[1:38:59] this message of the great greek creator
[1:39:02] became my savior
[1:39:05] and all god's fullness dwelleth in him
[1:39:09] what condensation bringing us redemption
[1:39:13] amen
[1:39:14] but the great creator it's that's we're
[1:39:16] supposed to worship him
[1:39:18] not his creation look at the world out
[1:39:21] there i don't believe that the church
[1:39:22] does i don't believe you do but we still
[1:39:24] have to be careful they out there they
[1:39:27] do they actually worship the creation
[1:39:29] more than the creator
[1:39:32] gets so caught up in the things of this
[1:39:34] world
[1:39:35] all right
[1:39:36] more than ravens and so he goes on and
[1:39:38] talks about that listen
[1:39:40] my how many knows better than he says
[1:39:42] you know i wouldn't extradite my
[1:39:44] experience for nothing
[1:39:47] how many does that feel that way this
[1:39:48] morning i wouldn't trade
[1:39:51] my experience with god for nothing
[1:39:55] we sing that song i wouldn't take
[1:39:57] nothing for my journey now
[1:39:59] i gotta make it to heaven somehow
[1:40:01] now though the devil tempts me tries to
[1:40:04] turn me around
[1:40:05] though he's offered everything that's
[1:40:07] got a name all the wealth i want the
[1:40:09] world of fame
[1:40:10] well it may not be all the wealth and
[1:40:12] worldly fame but he'll offer you
[1:40:13] something
[1:40:15] he'll try to get you to take something
[1:40:17] to stop you on your journey but i
[1:40:20] wouldn't take nothing from my lord i
[1:40:22] wouldn't take nothing for my experience
[1:40:25] folks i remember when i was without god
[1:40:28] amen and i said god if you'll just save
[1:40:30] me if you'll just help me lord i'll
[1:40:32] serve you it doesn't matter my future
[1:40:34] amen i want it to be completely in your
[1:40:36] hands
[1:40:39] because the devil ain't worth serving
[1:40:42] i don't care how much dope you smoked
[1:40:44] how high you got how much blood why you
[1:40:46] drew drink i don't care how much
[1:40:47] pleasure you had amen it all ended up
[1:40:50] with zero and all that
[1:40:52] me meant that you were empty inside
[1:40:56] an emptiness that i didn't like
[1:40:59] oh i'm so glad that i was not wasn't
[1:41:02] made to be empty he wasn't made to be
[1:41:04] empty
[1:41:05] he wasn't made to be robbed by the devil
[1:41:07] there's got to be something more than
[1:41:09] that
[1:41:10] amen
[1:41:13] and then boy i'll tell you what ever
[1:41:15] since he picked me up
[1:41:16] he's become my provider
[1:41:19] he's your provider he's our sustainer if
[1:41:22] you need deliverance from something he's
[1:41:23] your deliverer
[1:41:26] amen if you have a battle amen i'll tell
[1:41:29] you what he becomes your warrior
[1:41:32] he fights your battles for you why would
[1:41:34] you want to exchange that for
[1:41:36] getting in trouble and the devil not
[1:41:38] helping you out a bit
[1:41:42] the devil will take your joy he'll turn
[1:41:45] it into sorrow
[1:41:48] and you ask the devil for joy do you
[1:41:50] think you're going to get any no you're
[1:41:52] not going to get any oh brother man like
[1:41:55] he said he said they'll take another
[1:41:56] drink they'll go get drunk again try to
[1:41:58] forget the blues and the next time
[1:41:59] they're twice as miserable as they were
[1:42:01] before
[1:42:02] it just adds up and gets worse all the
[1:42:04] time
[1:42:06] till they put a gun to their head does
[1:42:07] he try to talk him out of it no he don't
[1:42:11] he sits back and says that's what i
[1:42:13] wanted
[1:42:14] he's the one that tells him to go do it
[1:42:16] there's a voice that told me just to go
[1:42:18] end it
[1:42:19] that was the devil talking to him
[1:42:22] that was the bad master talking to him
[1:42:27] aren't you glad to be a christian
[1:42:30] or i would rather be a christian than
[1:42:32] anything i know i'd rather be than the
[1:42:34] president of the united states or king

[1:42:38] christian

[1:42:49] lord trade in your sorrow

[1:43:14] christian i don't care if it gets so bad
[1:43:16] until you don't know which way to go how
[1:43:18] to turn and what to do you can fall on
[1:43:20] your knees and you can maybe not get
[1:43:22] over and pondered around that but this
[1:43:25] god will take you through
[1:43:28] i'm a witness somebody else's witness

[1:44:15] best deal you'll ever do
[1:44:17] it's the best deal you ever make trade
[1:44:20] in your life
[1:44:23] this is what we like folks this is where
[1:44:25] some of us especially like that and that
[1:44:28] is to completely give up yourself
[1:44:32] notice jesus didn't sell unless you and
[1:44:34] he didn't say unless you deny something
[1:44:36] else he said unless you deny yourself
[1:44:39] because he knew where your biggest enemy
[1:44:41] is
[1:44:42] you are your own biggest enemy
[1:44:45] if you deny yourself god can control you
[1:44:50] no
[1:44:54] let me tell you what the devil will
[1:44:56] offer he'll offer us the same thing he
[1:44:57] offered christ
[1:45:00] he made him an offer he made him a deal
[1:45:03] the devil was a businessman
[1:45:05] and he made him a deal in matthew 4 took
[1:45:07] him up into a high mountain that right
[1:45:10] first he offered him said he tempted him
[1:45:12] and said if you're if you are
[1:45:15] make these bread into stones and disown
[1:45:17] into bread
[1:45:18] and so on and so on but the last
[1:45:20] temptation was he took him into a high
[1:45:22] mountain and he offered him all the
[1:45:24] kingdoms of the world
[1:45:27] now i took a prophet to say he offered
[1:45:29] america he offered russia he offered

[1:45:33] kingdom of every world all the wages

[1:46:06] we fear god and god god will respect
[1:46:08] anybody any nation that fears him but
[1:46:12] when you turn from god

[1:46:33] because god don't bless sin god don't
[1:46:35] bless you backslid

[1:46:41] now look how it is he says now you watch
[1:46:43] sin go to the core
[1:46:46] my goodness
[1:46:48] decor is the president
[1:46:52] that's the core right he's the leader of

[1:46:58] now a homeless explanation we know it's
[1:47:01] gotten rotten all the way down
[1:47:04] ah that's exactly all the way down
[1:47:07] and now to me it seems like it's going
[1:47:09] further than the core
[1:47:11] they don't know where to end it's still
[1:47:12] going
[1:47:13] and it's going to keep going until it
[1:47:15] burns up
[1:47:17] amen
[1:47:18] oh my
[1:47:22] so don't
[1:47:23] expect anything good
[1:47:25] out of any country or nation
[1:47:27] that is run by the devil
[1:47:31] don't expect anything good from people
[1:47:33] that are run by the devil amen
[1:47:37] only
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:41] all right let's talk about a couple more
[1:47:44] is that all right
[1:47:46] we had david
[1:47:49] nathan was doing okay right
[1:47:52] until
[1:47:53] nathan wanted to be somebody
[1:47:56] and he said moses you're not the only
[1:47:58] holy one around here
[1:48:01] all right
[1:48:02] and he wanted to be popular
[1:48:05] huh
[1:48:07] he wanted popularity he wanted
[1:48:08] recognition
[1:48:10] let me tell you something evening like
[1:48:12] tabernacle any church any people you
[1:48:14] have got a problem in your church when
[1:48:16] there's somebody in that church wants to
[1:48:18] be a somebody
[1:48:20] you got a problem
[1:48:22] you got a serious problem because god
[1:48:23] don't like it at all
[1:48:26] huh
[1:48:28] you don't upset at all
[1:48:30] is it god or is it the devil
[1:48:32] it's the devil
[1:48:35] that makes thomas byler want to think
[1:48:36] he's anybody or make you want to be
[1:48:38] anybody or somebody special you ain't
[1:48:40] nothing special i ain't nothing special
[1:48:43] outside of the grace of god we're just a
[1:48:46] sinner saved by grace
[1:48:50] you're not greater than me i'm not
[1:48:51] greater than you we're all on the same
[1:48:53] level
[1:48:54] are you with me we're brothers and
[1:48:56] sisters
[1:48:58] oh my and the prophet of god remember
[1:49:01] he says don't call me doctor don't call
[1:49:02] me you don't have to call me reverend or
[1:49:04] whatever what do you say if you love me
[1:49:06] call me
[1:49:08] brother just call me brother
[1:49:12] oh that's that's humility
[1:49:16] and to us
[1:49:17] it was the mightiest prophet ever sent
[1:49:24] just like brother luke said jesus had
[1:49:26] more success ten times more success in
[1:49:29] his ministry than his own he was on the
[1:49:31] earth
[1:49:33] his jesus ministry even in acts acts two
[1:49:35] amen there was a uh what was it three
[1:49:37] thousand souls in one day
[1:49:40] thirty 000 in his meetings in one day
[1:49:43] down in africa where those africans they
[1:49:45] seen the power of god blind men opened
[1:49:48] their eyes and and so forth and they
[1:49:49] would take their idols and throw it down
[1:49:51] and the dust would come up
[1:49:53] they'd give their heart to god
[1:49:57] one of the brothers said no no that's
[1:49:59] just accepting their healing and so
[1:50:00] forth that's all it was the brother bam
[1:50:02] says how many was that for except from
[1:50:04] the lord jesus christ and they raised
[1:50:07] their hands
[1:50:08] one just for healing it was for
[1:50:09] accepting the lord jesus christ
[1:50:13] that's what we think
[1:50:15] there's people here on the message go
[1:50:17] too far and they made him jesus christ
[1:50:19] he says i'm coming off the field and
[1:50:20] you're responsible
[1:50:22] for every soul that would have come
[1:50:24] you're gonna pay for if you don't shut
[1:50:25] that up
[1:50:26] i am not jesus christ
[1:50:28] i know it looks a lot like it
[1:50:30] just like it
[1:50:32] huh because it was his eyes he was using
[1:50:38] brother bram says i have to go back and
[1:50:39] play the tape see what i said
[1:50:41] to me when i never heard that before i
[1:50:43] thought for sure he knows everything he
[1:50:45] said but brother bannon wouldn't even
[1:50:46] know what he was saying a lot of times
[1:50:48] god would be using his mouth in that
[1:50:49] major
[1:50:52] because whenever he would discern his
[1:50:54] lady's thoughts and the tongues of her
[1:50:55] heart and says your address is so-and-so
[1:50:58] and that her friend afterwards come to
[1:50:59] her and says that's not your address he
[1:51:01] was wrong
[1:51:05] and she says i'm sorry but yeah i moved
[1:51:07] and that is my new address
[1:51:10] hello never fall never fails
[1:51:13] amen
[1:51:15] let me tell you something to people you
[1:51:17] know why we're in this darkness let me
[1:51:18] tell you why we're in this darkness
[1:51:20] because people traded light for darkness
[1:51:22] they would rather go in the basement and
[1:51:24] say no none of that is real the sun
[1:51:26] ain't really shining jesus isn't making
[1:51:28] it manifest like that
[1:51:30] and they
[1:51:31] meant they traded their own
[1:51:33] understanding they lead to their own
[1:51:35] understanding above the vindicated and
[1:51:37] proven word of god
[1:51:41] huh
[1:51:42] people would rather stay with their
[1:51:44] church and the way that they were taught
[1:51:46] than the proven word of god
[1:51:49] in this generation that's why we're in
[1:51:51] darkness that's why it's as bad as it is
[1:51:53] because people receive darkness except
[1:51:56] the darkness
[1:51:57] rather than light and jesus said they
[1:51:59] would
[1:52:00] amen
[1:52:02] people love darkness more than they
[1:52:06] love life
[1:52:08] folks whenever you come in a message
[1:52:10] you've got to realize one thing
[1:52:12] that this is this is the word of
[1:52:13] everything has to line up with this
[1:52:17] everything i was told that is an amish
[1:52:19] boy that you gotta wear a hat you gotta
[1:52:20] wear a black coat you gotta wear a bar
[1:52:22] drive drive a buggy
[1:52:24] hey folks let me tell you some folk they
[1:52:26] all think a lot of them folks that you
[1:52:28] are english and you are they do not
[1:52:30] believe you're saved
[1:52:33] you gotta drive a horse buggy to be
[1:52:34] saved you gotta wear black clothes to be
[1:52:37] saved
[1:52:38] huh
[1:52:40] i have to forget
[1:52:42] you've got to forget everything wrong
[1:52:44] that you understand about the scripture
[1:52:47] to accept the vindicated truth to
[1:52:49] receive this
[1:52:53] well there might be you might think it's
[1:52:54] a contradiction matthew 28 28 18 says
[1:52:57] boy into all the world uh baptizing them
[1:53:00] in the name of the father son of the
[1:53:01] holy ghost
[1:53:03] acts 2 says he went out and baptized in
[1:53:05] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:53:08] we might not understand that but a
[1:53:09] prophet come along and said that is the
[1:53:11] name of the father son and the holy
[1:53:12] ghost
[1:53:14] it's perfect
[1:53:16] it's just our understanding need to
[1:53:18] clear up
[1:53:19] we i like it shake brother tears steve
[1:53:22] he's uh you know people think he can
[1:53:24] come shake their hand the preacher's
[1:53:25] hand join the church and they're saying
[1:53:28] no that ain't good enough
[1:53:30] he says by one spirit are we all
[1:53:31] baptized into one body you come come to
[1:53:34] church here every day of your life and
[1:53:36] never fail one bit
[1:53:38] but that still don't put you in the
[1:53:39] church of christ
[1:53:41] only one thing that puts you in god's
[1:53:43] church and that is the new birth
[1:53:45] amen you must be foreign again jesus
[1:53:49] said
[1:53:50] born of the spirit of god
[1:53:52] but people will trade it
[1:53:54] for the slightest little thing
[1:53:57] can you imagine
[1:54:00] jesus christ coming and proving himself
[1:54:02] alive and people will still go say no i
[1:54:04] don't think it's real
[1:54:05] people call it telepathy
[1:54:08] mind reading
[1:54:10] huh
[1:54:13] now jesus says whenever i discern your
[1:54:15] thoughts in terms of the heart you call
[1:54:16] that be elderly above the devil i'll
[1:54:17] forgive you for that but when the holy
[1:54:19] ghost has come and he does it through
[1:54:21] the church and you call it the devil it
[1:54:24] won't be forgiving you in this world or
[1:54:25] the world to come
[1:54:29] you know people might think we know it
[1:54:31] was just terrible of the pharisees and
[1:54:32] the scribes and
[1:54:34] and those jews for killing jesus the
[1:54:37] very messiah how could they accept a
[1:54:40] barabbas when pilate i believe he says
[1:54:42] you know i'm gonna have to release a
[1:54:44] prisoner to you which one do you want me
[1:54:46] to release jesus or somebody else
[1:54:48] they didn't want to let jesus go
[1:54:51] they accepted barabbas and said let
[1:54:53] barabbas go but kill this guy
[1:54:57] you say well we would never do that the
[1:54:58] gentile church did just that
[1:55:02] they did the exact same thing
[1:55:05] they accepted their own ways the
[1:55:07] traditions of man they didn't want to
[1:55:09] let go of their churches
[1:55:12] how many believes the message of this
[1:55:14] hour from god is this
[1:55:17] god has sent a prophet
[1:55:20] behold i behold i will send you elijah
[1:55:23] the prophet before the great and
[1:55:24] dreadful day of the lord that's our
[1:55:25] proclamation
[1:55:27] god said it back then but now we
[1:55:29] proclaim god has done this god is saying
[1:55:31] malachi
[1:55:33] he ascended i will send you lies in the
[1:55:35] prophet god has been a prophet you hear
[1:55:37] so much god's in the prophet god said
[1:55:38] well that's the message of the hour
[1:55:40] that's what god did
[1:55:41] and he'll turn the hearts back to the
[1:55:43] father he'll bring us back to the bible
[1:55:44] where we ought to be
[1:55:46] amen
[1:55:48] how many believes that you know what
[1:55:49] else is the message for this hour
[1:55:51] another message to this hour is
[1:55:53] that you can't stay in them churches
[1:55:55] anymore
[1:55:57] brother again there ought to be a whole
[1:55:58] lot of folks following you
[1:56:00] this place ought to be full of people
[1:56:02] that are leaving them to denominational
[1:56:03] churches
[1:56:04] because the message is come out of her
[1:56:06] my people
[1:56:08] that you partake not of her sins that
[1:56:10] you receive not
[1:56:12] of the plagues that god is going to
[1:56:13] bring down upon him
[1:56:15] the only way to escape god's wrath is to
[1:56:17] come out of them churches because now
[1:56:19] she has absolutely accepted a lie lead
[1:56:23] to her own understanding over the
[1:56:25] vindicating word she has swapped
[1:56:27] traditions
[1:56:30] for the vindicated proven word god
[1:56:32] and took
[1:56:34] plunged the whole human race
[1:56:37] into darkness
[1:56:39] amen there's only one thing to do is
[1:56:41] come out of her
[1:56:43] do you realize it would read different
[1:56:46] there's a different place it says i gave
[1:56:47] her space to repent
[1:56:50] does it say and she repented
[1:56:53] no the bible says and she repented not
[1:56:56] of her sins
[1:56:58] she is the mother of
[1:57:00] harlots
[1:57:02] catholic church is the mother but she
[1:57:04] has children
[1:57:05] harlots
[1:57:08] claim to be married to christ
[1:57:11] huh
[1:57:13] christ says
[1:57:14] it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair
[1:57:17] let her be covered let her have long
[1:57:19] hair
[1:57:20] ah that doesn't matter i can do it
[1:57:22] anyway let me listen to another man and
[1:57:26] i'll cut my hair and
[1:57:27] do all of those things spiritual
[1:57:29] fornication
[1:57:31] when you do one thing contrary to what
[1:57:32] god has said you're committing spiritual
[1:57:34] fornication
[1:57:37] folks i didn't have this in the script
[1:57:39] but is that all right
[1:57:41] he did
[1:57:42] amen you love the lord
[1:57:45] i just thought about that back in the
[1:57:46] office talking about i was thinking
[1:57:48] about malachi 4 thinking about you know
[1:57:50] behold i'll send you elijah the prophet
[1:57:52] great and dreadful there lord he'll turn
[1:57:54] the hearts back and then they reject
[1:57:56] they actually accepted a barabbas
[1:58:00] except that something that'll take him
[1:58:01] to death
[1:58:03] over
[1:58:04] the word of god
[1:58:06] oh my
[1:58:08] quite all age no wonder the tribulation
[1:58:10] period is setting in no wonder our
[1:58:13] government is in the condition that it
[1:58:15] is in
[1:58:16] because the church is let down
[1:58:19] the church has opened it up
[1:58:21] now they're going to have to vote
[1:58:22] whether they have homosexuals or not
[1:58:25] they're going to have to decide all
[1:58:26] these things oh we're way past the women
[1:58:29] wearing skirts that are way too tight
[1:58:31] and
[1:58:32] and wearing pants and and preaching and
[1:58:35] way past all of that we're all the way
[1:58:37] up in the homosexuality realm now
[1:58:41] won't be long they'll probably have to
[1:58:43] uh
[1:58:44] you know figure out whether they'll let
[1:58:46] members that are having a sex change
[1:58:48] stay in their church
[1:58:51] huh
[1:58:54] that's right
[1:58:58] i haven't with just what i want to say
[1:59:00] about that yet but it ain't going to be
[1:59:01] good is it
[1:59:03] huh
[1:59:04] you don't know what kind you're of
[1:59:07] huh
[1:59:09] our goal my anyway
[1:59:11] we're getting really down home now is
[1:59:13] that all right
[1:59:14] but people absolutely
[1:59:16] trade
[1:59:18] their soul for the slightest
[1:59:20] little thing let's make sure
[1:59:22] that we don't treat our experience that
[1:59:23] we don't treat the holy spirit ain't
[1:59:25] made for an unclean spirit for any
[1:59:28] reason notice how that jesus
[1:59:31] was offered all the kingdoms of the
[1:59:34] world
[1:59:35] with what with no sacrifice
[1:59:41] to us
[1:59:42] you can just stay the way that you are
[1:59:45] and yet you can be a deacon you can be a
[1:59:47] preacher
[1:59:49] you can call yourself a christian but
[1:59:50] you don't have to get rid of this you
[1:59:52] don't have to die to yourself
[1:59:54] you don't have to go to no caliber you
[1:59:55] don't have to die to yourself
[1:59:57] that's the offer that the devil makes to
[1:59:59] everybody
[2:00:01] huh that you don't have to change
[2:00:05] he wasn't requiring anything of jesus
[2:00:08] he didn't want to go to calvary he
[2:00:09] wanted to make him an offer
[2:00:11] i'll give them all to you right now all
[2:00:13] you got to do is worship me
[2:00:16] huh
[2:00:18] boy i'll tell you what the devil will
[2:00:20] offer you the holy ghost he'll on your
[2:00:21] flesh
[2:00:24] be a church member go to church do this
[2:00:27] out of the other but just don't die to
[2:00:29] yourself
[2:00:33] stay alive a little bit of yourselves
[2:00:35] keep doing it your way
[2:00:38] boy i hope this goes down deep for all
[2:00:40] of us
[2:00:41] keep thinking the way you want to think
[2:00:44] keep living the way you want to live
[2:00:46] but keep going to evening light
[2:00:48] tabernacle
[2:00:51] and i've got you
[2:00:53] why because when you come to christ you
[2:00:55] don't get to think the way you want to
[2:00:56] think
[2:00:57] you don't get to do the way you want to
[2:00:59] do
[2:00:59] act the way you want to do
[2:01:01] live the way you want to live
[2:01:04] uh-huh
[2:01:05] you don't get to when you come to christ
[2:01:08] now you want to do what he wants you to
[2:01:10] do
[2:01:11] you'll want to live the way that he
[2:01:13] wants you to live
[2:01:15] how many this morning need an
[2:01:17] improvement in your life in this area
[2:01:22] i believe it i believe from the pastor
[2:01:25] there's no little one from the least to
[2:01:27] the greatest there's no such but still
[2:01:29] every one of us i believe needed i know
[2:01:30] i need it
[2:01:31] my heart's open this morning lord show
[2:01:33] me
[2:01:35] well lord show me what i like yet
[2:01:39] show me where i'm still living a little
[2:01:41] bit of my life doing it my way thinking
[2:01:43] my thoughts
[2:01:45] and still claiming to be a preacher and
[2:01:47] a pastor
[2:01:49] huh
[2:01:50] it gets hard for me
[2:01:52] and i believe it needs to get hard for
[2:01:53] every one of us
[2:01:55] because we're getting down home close
[2:01:56] now we're getting close folks
[2:01:58] and i believe the holy spirit is honing
[2:02:00] down in our art he's honing right down
[2:02:02] to where we live
[2:02:03] he's pointing it right out to us
[2:02:06] if there's still too much of ourself
[2:02:08] because he don't want to take that him
[2:02:09] he's not going to take that up there
