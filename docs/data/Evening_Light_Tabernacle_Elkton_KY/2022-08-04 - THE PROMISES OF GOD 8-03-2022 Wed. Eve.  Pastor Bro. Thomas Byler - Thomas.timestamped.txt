[35:56] Heavenly Father we come before you Lord
[35:58] Jesus grateful once again Lord to be in
[36:00] your house Lord
[36:03] with your children assembled together
[36:05] Lord Jesus
[36:07] and father no doubt but that you thought
[36:09] about this meeting when you spoke to
[36:10] disciples and when he was speaking to
[36:11] him and said wherever two or three are
[36:13] gathered together there I will be in the
[36:15] midst Lord and we truly thank you Lord
[36:17] Jesus that you are still in the midst
[36:19] Lord father we ask God that you just
[36:21] help me Lord to get out of the way Lord
[36:23] Jesus to be able to minister your word
[36:25] say what you once said father things
[36:27] that would take hold on people's lives
[36:29] they would anchor they would stabilize
[36:31] they would strengthen each and every one
[36:33] of us Lord and then we ask God for the
[36:34] congregation Lord that their hearts and
[36:37] their minds would be in the place Lord
[36:38] that it could come down into their ears
[36:40] and then to be able to hear with the
[36:43] Heart Lord Jesus and that it might bring
[36:44] forth a hundredfold that it might
[36:47] accomplish that's that which it was sent
[36:50] out to do we ask these blessings in
[36:52] Jesus name amen we want to speak tonight
[36:55] with the help of the lord it's going to
[36:56] be kind of a part two of inheritance
[36:59] amen
[37:00] inheritance when we kind of speak on
[37:04] God's promises amen talking about God's
[37:07] promises
[37:08] praise the Lord
[37:11] amen so if you will let's turn our
[37:13] Bibles to the Book of Revelations and I
[37:16] mean that's kind of uh kind of a
[37:19] big thing we said Sunday wasn't it amen
[37:23] about inheriting everything
[37:26] all things belong to you everything amen
[37:29] I was thinking on the way to church I
[37:31] said you know what if that really got
[37:33] dropped down on it really really grabbed
[37:36] a hold of us you know man what would
[37:38] what what kind of a reaction would that
[37:40] do down in here you know amen and so
[37:43] just think about it praise be to God and
[37:47] there's one more scripture that I
[37:48] thought about that I didn't speak on
[37:50] Sunday and
[37:52] um you know that I wanted to mention and
[37:53] and talking about just you know making
[37:56] sure I like I don't want to preach my
[37:58] thoughts or my ideas we're not here to
[38:00] do
[38:01] that I want to make sure that every
[38:03] thought I have everything I speak is the
[38:05] word of God
[38:07] I mean it's with me on that that it's
[38:08] the word of God that it can be backed up
[38:10] from Genesis to revelation all the way
[38:13] through and it'll be accurate amen and
[38:15] so there's one scripture and that's what
[38:17] we're going to start off with amen the
[38:19] night with the help of the Lord amen I
[38:21] also wanted to say you know I don't uh I
[38:24] hope I didn't get out of hand on Sunday
[38:26] but I was just loving worshiping the
[38:28] Lord amen and you know I thought you
[38:31] know
[38:32] uh God is great and he is greatly to be
[38:35] praised
[38:36] amen I thought he healed me big so I'm
[38:39] Gonna Worship big
[38:40] [Laughter]
[38:42] amen praise the Lord you know sometimes
[38:45] hey I'm going to keep you standing here
[38:48] too long but sometimes you know we get
[38:50] sick we get better and we say well I
[38:52] just got sick and got better no that's
[38:54] not all it was
[38:55] God allows you to get sick to let you
[38:58] know that he is your healer it was one
[39:01] of those attributes that he displaced to
[39:03] us that he was in him before the
[39:05] foundation of the world and I believe
[39:07] you ought to have some kind of reaction
[39:09] in US amenada caused us to worship Him
[39:12] and praise Him amen say thank you Lord
[39:14] for my healing amen because you know
[39:16] we're always going to run around scream
[39:18] shout and and praise God for saving us
[39:20] amen well all these other things he does
[39:23] for us we need to worship and praise him
[39:25] for amen Revelations 21-1 and I saw a
[39:29] new Heaven and a new Earth
[39:31] for the first heaven and first Earth
[39:32] were passed away and there was no more
[39:34] sea amen
[39:37] and I John saw the holy city the New
[39:40] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[39:42] Heaven prepared as he bride adorned for
[39:44] her husband and I heard a great voice
[39:46] out of Heaven saying behold the
[39:48] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[39:51] will dwell with them and they shall be
[39:53] his people and God himself shall be
[39:57] God himself shall be with them and be
[40:00] their God amen
[40:03] amen as we go down through here just
[40:05] look at the big picture here look at the
[40:07] scope of it amen
[40:12] and God shall wipe away we're crying
[40:15] amen and they're shout and I want you to
[40:17] notice this word shall also because
[40:19] tonight a lot of a lot of this word
[40:21] we're going to use his word a lot this
[40:23] word shall amen because it's in that
[40:25] promise or a covenant or what we would
[40:27] call it a contract and whenever you
[40:29] write a shell in there that's the way it
[40:31] must be amen
[40:33] shall be no more pain for the former
[40:36] things are passed away and he that sat
[40:38] upon the throne said behold I make all
[40:40] things new and he said unto me right
[40:43] for these words
[40:45] are faithful and true and he said unto
[40:48] me it is done
[40:50] I'm the alpha I'm the big Amiga I'm the
[40:53] beginning and I and the end and I will
[40:55] give unto him that is the thirst of the
[40:58] Fountain of Life of the Water of Life
[41:00] freely
[41:03] listen to the conclusion of the matter
[41:05] to the believer
[41:07] this is the last thing he says until he
[41:10] begins to talking to the unbeliever and
[41:12] so forth he that overcometh
[41:15] shall inherit
[41:16] all things
[41:19] shall hear it after the scope of the
[41:22] doll he says this is what's going to
[41:23] happen
[41:25] Hallelujah
[41:27] all things and I will be his God and he
[41:29] shall be my son may God add His
[41:32] blessings to the reading of the words
[41:33] you can be seated tonight
[41:36] I just want to say I believe that
[41:38] there's so many so many promises that
[41:41] God made
[41:43] there's so many blessings that God
[41:45] bestowed upon us that what I would call
[41:47] external
[41:49] kind of external promises such a a place
[41:52] to live uh you know a home a heaven the
[41:56] creation the new Heavens a new all these
[41:58] things that he's going to make for us
[42:00] you know and we could kind of maybe say
[42:02] that's external but you know the one
[42:04] thing
[42:04] that Jesus really came for is that if
[42:07] you give us the internal
[42:10] amen the internal the thing that's on
[42:12] the inside is what he really came along
[42:15] with everything else but what's
[42:16] important is John 3 16 for God to love
[42:19] the world that he gave his only begotten
[42:22] son that whosoever should believe in him
[42:23] should have ever lasting life because
[42:28] anything external but this one here this
[42:31] is what's really really important your
[42:34] life that eternal life is what's really
[42:36] really important and amen and we praise
[42:40] that because as I think about uh what
[42:42] brother bam said of mechanics and
[42:44] dynamics of a car you know because I'll
[42:46] tell you what you might not have a
[42:47] fender you might not have a hood and it
[42:49] would look really bad if you didn't have
[42:50] fenders and hoods on your vehicle it'd
[42:52] be bad if you'd have enough a trunk the
[42:53] lid was off you know the bumper was
[42:55] hanging on dragging down the road or
[42:57] something you know but I'll tell you
[42:58] what if that when you turn that key and
[43:01] it cranks and it purrs that's very
[43:03] important but that's not all that's
[43:05] important the other part of the mechanic
[43:07] it's important when you pull that gear
[43:09] down and you wouldn't put that
[43:10] transmission in because I can have all
[43:12] the engine you want but if it don't move
[43:14] it don't do you any good but as long as
[43:16] that engine as long as that transmission
[43:17] is working good guess what it'll get you
[43:19] from point A to point B amen now I'm
[43:22] here to tell you if you've got the Holy
[43:23] Ghost you got every promise everything
[43:25] else is taken care of Amen the Holy
[43:28] Spirit the power amen and I could go a
[43:31] little bit deeper no matter how much
[43:32] engine and so forth no much how much gas
[43:34] we know that without that fire because
[43:36] somebody knows a car runs on fire
[43:42] it has to have fire the gas has to
[43:44] explode combust you'd have to burn
[43:46] without that you ain't got nothing and
[43:49] that is the way it is with the Christian
[43:50] tonight no matter how much you say well
[43:52] I'm a Christian I'm gonna believe it
[43:53] that that's wonderful I like to hear all
[43:55] that that's all external but there has
[43:57] to be a fire
[43:59] in your heart
[44:00] burn
[44:02] amen that's what's very important
[44:04] because I'll tell you what without that
[44:06] you gotta hunk of junk it ain't no good
[44:09] absolutely no good without that praise
[44:11] the Lord so tonight we want to go and
[44:13] kind of transition for talking about
[44:14] what's ours and inheritance and so forth
[44:16] over also into the promise of God
[44:20] but bam he makes a statement when I got
[44:22] saved brother I took this old Treasure
[44:24] Book
[44:25] amen
[44:26] I don't know about you but just lately I
[44:29] don't know and I've always this has
[44:31] always been a real treasure but I like
[44:33] when the Lord makes this real to me
[44:37] I like to be able to look at this as a
[44:40] treasure book and if you I'll tell you
[44:43] what if you got a real treasure you're
[44:44] not going to put it on the Shelf
[44:46] somewhere and it's going to get dust on
[44:47] it
[44:48] amen and this is this is oh my I believe
[44:52] truly believe that we could probably
[44:53] speak of a thousand years of sermons on
[44:57] just what this book is
[45:02] ah just what this book is because
[45:04] without this right here I mean you've
[45:07] got nothing to stand on you've got
[45:09] absolutely nothing
[45:11] amen this is the rock that we stand on
[45:13] on Christ the solid rock ice sand all
[45:16] over the ground is sinking sand you can
[45:19] have no confidence I can't have anything
[45:21] really without this here right here
[45:25] and God send us his word isn't that
[45:27] right
[45:28] amen and God sends his word and we're to
[45:30] believe it amen
[45:32] and so
[45:34] oh my so he says this Treasure Book of
[45:38] God and I looked through it to see what
[45:40] I possessed
[45:42] amen
[45:43] I find out that every blessing that's in
[45:46] this Bible belongs to me
[45:48] now I like that he said blessing
[45:51] because you know not every promise is
[45:53] yours
[45:55] not every promise in this book is yours
[46:00] huh
[46:02] yeah it doesn't pertain to you
[46:05] amen he that believeth not shall be
[46:08] damned it will be damned that's a
[46:10] promise of God
[46:12] that don't apply to you
[46:14] it's a promise of God but that belongs
[46:16] to another people amen
[46:18] he that believeth and he's baptized
[46:21] shall
[46:22] be saved
[46:26] praise be to God that belongs to you
[46:28] that's your promise
[46:30] whosoever believeth on me shall not
[46:33] perish
[46:35] shall not
[46:37] amen you know we could take all the
[46:40] shells and I wanted to take a lot of the
[46:41] shells in the Bible and maybe talk to
[46:43] you about the shelves and sits make sure
[46:45] it's absolute and so forth and really
[46:47] make sure it's really concrete but you
[46:48] know when it comes right down to it
[46:53] every
[46:55] last
[46:56] word
[46:58] every jot every Tittle every Cross of a
[47:02] t and every dot of an eye
[47:04] is a promise
[47:08] are you with me
[47:10] it's sure
[47:13] it's absolute
[47:15] amen
[47:18] amen
[47:19] the more I think about this and realize
[47:22] and begin to see what's really in here
[47:28] the more
[47:29] it creates an appetite for me to want to
[47:32] see more I was with you I want to have
[47:35] an appetite to see what's more what's
[47:37] mine
[47:42] foreign
[47:50] amen so let's start till we go into
[47:54] Rapture is that right
[47:55] amen I'm just looking forward to that
[47:57] amen
[48:00] now and I hope hopefully I'll get to it
[48:02] tonight but we want to talk about how
[48:04] that it takes the arm of faith
[48:07] huh to cut these promises loose that's
[48:10] the prophet put it to receive them unto
[48:12] ourselves
[48:13] and he mentions how there's a lot of
[48:15] people that can cut out salvation but
[48:18] can't cut this out can't cut that out
[48:20] some of them have enough faith for
[48:21] deliverance and perhaps justification or
[48:24] sanctification or have so much Faith but
[48:27] we want to have
[48:28] as much as possible isn't that right to
[48:31] cut out every promise that we have and
[48:33] I'm here to tell you hopefully by the
[48:35] time we get down here tonight I want you
[48:37] to understand that there's a lot of
[48:40] promises huge promises in here that
[48:44] belongs to you that's yours as a
[48:46] believer
[48:47] you can't who knows you can't claim any
[48:49] of that as unbeliever no you have to be
[48:51] a believer and that's the number one
[48:52] thing that's the only thing that brings
[48:54] you into this is
[48:56] through faith or belief you don't
[48:59] believeth
[49:00] amen
[49:03] every blessing that's in this Bible
[49:05] belongs to me and it belongs to every
[49:08] believer yes sir praise be to God every
[49:13] promise in the book he says is
[49:15] yours he says this is like a great
[49:18] arcade of God's economy belongs to every
[49:21] believer and by one Spirit we're all
[49:23] baptized into that and everything in
[49:26] here
[49:26] belongs to you
[49:32] Hold Steady
[49:34] think about it doesn't that do something
[49:36] to you think it all belongs to you
[49:40] let that sink in it's yours
[49:44] if you can believe it
[49:47] a scripture or something wasn't that uh
[49:51] the man that came to Jesus with his
[49:54] daughter that was you know really bad
[49:55] shape and so forth and
[49:57] and he says you know he says you know
[49:59] believe is thou that she can be wild or
[50:01] whatever he says you know help them I
[50:03] believe he said
[50:04] Lord I Lord I believe help thou my
[50:06] non-belief he says you know if thou
[50:08] can't believe
[50:10] all things are possible
[50:13] Anything is Possible
[50:16] to them that can believe
[50:19] and I if I was to say anything tonight
[50:22] and challenges on anything I believe
[50:24] that the problem with each and every one
[50:27] of us
[50:29] is how to get to that place
[50:33] to be able to receive that and to be
[50:35] able to handle that much
[50:37] huh
[50:38] anything is possible all things are
[50:40] possible
[50:42] anyway I'm getting ahead of myself all
[50:44] right
[50:45] so he says belongs to every believer and
[50:49] everything that it belongs to us and
[50:52] we're Heirs of all things
[50:57] every promise of God Amen
[51:00] then I read a little something a little
[51:02] further down that I liked he says in our
[51:04] soul rests solemnly upon his word or his
[51:09] promise
[51:10] how many knows that's the truth every
[51:12] day we live if you come down to the
[51:15] doord up as you live your life you are
[51:17] completely your soul is completely
[51:21] standing on what God Said
[51:26] that's where we're standing
[51:29] as we go no matter what you go through
[51:32] you stand on God's word
[51:35] that's the only thing you have to stand
[51:37] on
[51:38] I thought about that song and I asked
[51:40] brother Josh maybe you sing it at the
[51:41] end Standing on the Promises of God
[51:47] praise the Lord standing on I want to
[51:49] think that we're walking on the promise
[51:52] of God we're living on the promise of
[51:54] God we're breathing and having our being
[51:58] hey all because of what God Said
[52:03] that's what it's all about it's about
[52:04] what God Said
[52:09] this book
[52:11] like I said every word every jot every
[52:14] title everything is true right it's all
[52:16] a promise
[52:18] let's look at another scripture follow
[52:20] me
[52:23] let's go to Matthew 6.
[52:41] all right
[52:45] that is not the one I was looking for
[52:48] it's Matthew 24.
[52:52] let's hope that's the one
[52:58] yeah
[52:59] this is the one
[53:03] and let's go with
[53:09] 29. immediately after the tribulation of
[53:12] those days shall the sun be darkened and
[53:15] the moon shall not give her light the
[53:18] Stars shall fall from Heaven and their
[53:20] powers of Heaven shall be shaken and
[53:22] then shall appear to sign up the sign of
[53:24] the son of man in heaven amen
[53:27] and then shall all the tribes of the
[53:30] earth mourn and they shall see the son
[53:32] of man coming into clouds of heaven with
[53:34] power and great Glory now again as I
[53:38] said in the beginning there were
[53:39] Revelations if you notice Revelation 21
[53:41] God describes a new Heaven and the new
[53:44] Earth and wiping away all their tear all
[53:46] of that even has a big picture there and
[53:49] there at the end he talks about and you
[53:51] shall inherit on all things now follow
[53:53] this as he begins to talk about the moon
[53:55] not giving her light the big things that
[53:57] are happening as we come to the
[53:59] conclusion of what we want to try to say
[54:01] verse 30 and it shall appear to sign of
[54:03] the son of man in heaven then shall all
[54:04] the tribes of the earth mourn and they
[54:06] shall see the son of man coming in
[54:08] clouds of heaven with power and great
[54:09] glory and he shall send forth his angels
[54:12] with a great sound of a trumpet and they
[54:13] shall gather together his elect from the
[54:15] Four Winds from one of end of Heaven to
[54:17] the other I'll learn a parable of the
[54:20] Fig Tree when his branches yet tender
[54:22] and puteth forth his lead you know that
[54:24] summer is nine amen we understand that
[54:27] as Israel coming been becoming a nation
[54:29] she's always been to Victory
[54:31] amen so likewise ye when ye shall see
[54:34] all these things no that is nearer even
[54:38] at the doors keep that in your heart
[54:41] every day that you live we are right at
[54:44] the door
[54:45] we are right at the time don't get
[54:48] lukewarm sloth floor in this hour
[54:50] I mean how many believe it's high time
[54:52] to be on our prayer bones
[54:54] amen
[54:56] amen what would you
[54:58] give you anything you want what would
[55:00] you say what would you say you'd want
[55:03] think about it you have to think about
[55:05] what you'd ask my desire is Lord have me
[55:08] ready have my family ready and my loved
[55:10] ones ready
[55:11] and keep me ready amen because in the
[55:14] hour that you're living in in the world
[55:16] that we're living in it's so easy
[55:19] really
[55:21] and I'm here to tell you it's gonna
[55:23] take a special prayer or a special
[55:24] person special seed something in there
[55:27] to keep you on track folks
[55:29] amen so likewise now notice
[55:32] barely verily I say unto you not verily
[55:36] verily but single verily on that one
[55:38] doesn't matter one merrily's good enough
[55:40] for me
[55:41] right
[55:42] all right this generation shall not pass
[55:46] not from what I understand what message
[55:48] starts is the generation that sees
[55:50] Israel become a nation will not die off
[55:53] they could live a hundred years
[55:55] huh but it won't all die until this is
[56:00] done
[56:01] amen
[56:02] till all these things be fulfilled
[56:05] amen Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[56:10] but my words
[56:12] shall not
[56:13] pass away
[56:15] it doesn't matter what God ever said he
[56:17] always means it
[56:18] it's always true
[56:21] right be the guy can I say something if
[56:24] the whole world could just believe that
[56:27] it all behaved
[56:29] that what he said he said true and if
[56:32] they could genuinely believe it they 'd
[56:34] all be saved
[56:36] wasn't it Abraham that believed God and
[56:38] it was imputed to him for righteousness
[56:40] all God asks is for you to believe
[56:43] believe it with all of your heart you
[56:46] got to believe it
[56:47] not so long ago I listen to brother Adam
[56:49] he says you know when a person genuinely
[56:51] repents
[56:53] genuinely repents and give their heart
[56:55] to God and get baptized in the name of
[56:56] Jesus Christ God is obligated to give
[56:59] that person the Holy Ghost
[57:01] for the promises to you to your children
[57:03] to never fall even as many as the Lord
[57:04] Our God shall call amen
[57:08] amen because God said so if you truly do
[57:12] that I believe God backs his word up I
[57:15] believe God keeps his word
[57:18] amen
[57:20] I'm sure that a lot of us have and if we
[57:22] haven't let's
[57:24] make sure that when we get like the
[57:26] children of Israel like the three Hebrew
[57:29] children when they were put into the
[57:30] test of whether God would keep his word
[57:32] or not uh I went ahead and they were
[57:35] going to Forfeit their lives but they
[57:37] were going to believe God
[57:38] and they see God keep his word amen
[57:41] they've seen God
[57:43] praise the Lord all right so my point
[57:45] here is
[57:48] that heavens and earth
[57:50] will pass away
[57:52] but my words if you'll notice the word
[57:54] shall
[57:56] amen they shall not
[57:59] pass away
[58:00] amen we find over Revelations Heaven and
[58:03] Earth has passed away right they had
[58:06] passed away
[58:09] um
[58:12] here this is the quote I just now
[58:13] thought of so I'll read it now we're
[58:16] supposed to be Abraham's seed
[58:18] spiritually speaking being in Christ now
[58:21] we should take a hold of every promise
[58:25] of God and cherish it as though it was
[58:29] already done
[58:34] hey man how many times Brother Brad pray
[58:37] for somebody said now go believing
[58:39] go believe in accepting it I think it's
[58:42] already done John Ryan right it wasn't
[58:45] done even bond is a back telling
[58:47] everybody I'm Healed I can see I can see
[58:50] yeah so much oh another thing about this
[58:53] another point about this whole thing is
[58:55] that every promise in the book you have
[58:58] to fight for every inch of it
[59:00] you have to fight for every inch wide
[59:02] what do you got to fight unbelief
[59:04] you got to fight your own mind you got
[59:06] to fight every thought that comes into
[59:08] there
[59:09] yeah man you gotta battle through that
[59:11] get rid of that once you can get through
[59:13] all of that
[59:14] it's yours
[59:16] yours amen
[59:18] praise be to God
[59:20] so he says put it and cherish it
[59:23] although it was already done for when
[59:25] God has spoken he can never take it back
[59:30] I like the thought of when God speaks a
[59:33] little bit because we know that
[59:35] half the time I gotta think maybe even
[59:39] up here of how I'm gonna say it and
[59:40] maybe in the middle of a sentence stop
[59:42] and rephrase just a little bit you know
[59:44] you know and you wanted to have it the
[59:46] right effect and so forth and and
[59:48] especially if you're trying to figure
[59:50] things out or doing a job or whatever
[59:52] you got to think five six times God
[59:55] don't have to ever think twice
[59:59] perfect thought the first time and when
[1:00:01] he speaks it it's perfect
[1:00:03] it's Eternal it's forever and you can
[1:00:06] hang yourself believe that you can hang
[1:00:08] your soul on any of the word of God
[1:00:11] and you are hanging your soul on every
[1:00:13] word of God
[1:00:16] I believe there's another place that
[1:00:17] said man shall not live by bread alone
[1:00:20] but by every word that proceeded out of
[1:00:25] the mouth of God
[1:00:27] that's why we live by every word so when
[1:00:29] you hear a church say well my
[1:00:31] predestination our church don't believe
[1:00:33] that our church don't teach that
[1:00:35] Bible teaches it
[1:00:38] you got a problem
[1:00:40] you've got a problem when you don't
[1:00:42] believe that
[1:00:43] Eve brought us into this
[1:00:45] chaos by disbelieving one word
[1:00:49] just one word the prophet of God said
[1:00:51] we're not getting back unless we believe
[1:00:53] every word
[1:00:56] amen how many beliefs every word
[1:01:03] folks I don't care what somebody reads
[1:01:05] to me and it may seem like it uh you
[1:01:08] know just like the Bible says I create
[1:01:10] evil
[1:01:12] that's what the Bible says
[1:01:14] well you know when you go to think and
[1:01:17] be kept don't think that's what the
[1:01:19] Bible says I believe it
[1:01:21] huh
[1:01:24] he did create the devil
[1:01:26] how did all that come about
[1:01:28] huh everything had to come from
[1:01:31] God he put him put that evil out there
[1:01:33] so you can take your choice
[1:01:35] make your choice
[1:01:40] praise be to God you know what a miracle
[1:01:42] is I'm looking at however many are here
[1:01:45] I'm looking at this many miracles
[1:01:47] you have free will you can do whatever
[1:01:48] you want to
[1:01:50] but here you are in church and you want
[1:01:52] to love the Lord you want to serve him
[1:01:54] you don't want nothing with the devil
[1:01:56] you want to get the devil devil get
[1:01:58] behind me isn't that right
[1:02:00] get away from me I want to serve God
[1:02:02] that's a miracle right there
[1:02:05] I'm his
[1:02:06] we're working out looking at miracles
[1:02:10] because look at the world
[1:02:13] amen
[1:02:15] I was looking at somebody at a gas
[1:02:17] station or somewhere they were all
[1:02:18] tattooed up
[1:02:20] you know what I thought sister Becky my
[1:02:24] thought was
[1:02:25] them folks I'm telling you right now
[1:02:27] them folks are really thirsty
[1:02:30] they're thirsty for satisfaction
[1:02:33] they have need of having their first
[1:02:35] quenched and they don't know what else
[1:02:37] to do and everything but even brother
[1:02:39] bam taught it in thirst he says you know
[1:02:40] they go uh cheating on their wives they
[1:02:43] go drinking beer they could do all of
[1:02:45] these things because there's a there's
[1:02:46] found there
[1:02:48] in there there's because of thirst
[1:02:49] that's unquenched
[1:02:52] I suppose you wouldn't do that if you
[1:02:53] were satisfied
[1:02:55] isn't that right so when I see a
[1:02:58] tattooed person I see maybe that's the
[1:02:59] Son of God I don't know who it is but
[1:03:01] that person is thirsty I should hand
[1:03:03] them a book
[1:03:05] are you with me
[1:03:07] say here this will satisfy you
[1:03:13] how many can confess Lord I'm not near
[1:03:14] bold enough
[1:03:16] I need to be bolder
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:23] all right
[1:03:26] Hebrews 4 says in verse 12.
[1:03:30] he says that uh
[1:03:33] faith is what holds the sword there's
[1:03:35] nothing can hold the sword of people but
[1:03:38] faith in God that's what yield wields it
[1:03:42] you might have a week with your arm and
[1:03:45] faith maybe you can just cut out
[1:03:46] justification or whatever it might be
[1:03:48] enough to join Church
[1:03:50] but a good strong arm of faith can cut
[1:03:52] through to the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:55] Spirit
[1:03:56] amen
[1:03:58] it can cut through all of the Divine it
[1:04:02] can cut out Divine Healing cut through
[1:04:04] to gifts miracles signs and wonders
[1:04:09] hey man how many wants to see more of
[1:04:10] that in your life
[1:04:12] praise the Lord
[1:04:15] in Joshua 1 it says everywhere The Souls
[1:04:17] of your feet sets that means possession
[1:04:19] that's the way it is today everywhere
[1:04:22] the soul of your feet sets it's
[1:04:23] possession just keep walking
[1:04:26] Footprints means possession
[1:04:29] amen
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:41] but abandonment praying for people and
[1:04:42] so forth and he was talking about a job
[1:04:44] Jawbone of a mule that I believe it was
[1:04:47] uh
[1:04:49] Samson grapped you know to kill all the
[1:04:51] Philistines he says let's forsake all
[1:04:53] these old cots stretchers wheelchairs
[1:04:56] crutches and say it belongs to the devil
[1:05:01] amen I mean no that's what the devil
[1:05:04] wants to do
[1:05:05] he wants to put you in a wheelchair he
[1:05:07] wants to put cot he would make you sick
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:12] I don't know if I can say it it just
[1:05:14] comes to mind now but I'm thinking of a
[1:05:16] song Lord Lord Lord you surely been good
[1:05:20] to me
[1:05:21] amen you saved my soul when I was lost
[1:05:24] you healed my body when I was
[1:05:26] sick it surely been good to me
[1:05:31] I made a song to The Devil I said devil
[1:05:33] devil devil you've surely been bad to me
[1:05:36] devil devil devil you sure they've been
[1:05:38] bad to me
[1:05:39] you made me sick when I was well you
[1:05:42] surely been bad to me
[1:05:44] huh
[1:05:45] now get thee behind me
[1:05:48] Satan amen
[1:05:51] amen praise the Lord
[1:05:53] all right
[1:05:54] so when we talk about a promise God's
[1:05:57] promises
[1:05:58] it's like a covenant right a covenant
[1:06:02] or a contract
[1:06:09] and you all know brother branham's
[1:06:10] description so I'll read it I'm gonna
[1:06:12] read it he says the Covenant has always
[1:06:14] been a strange thing he says in China
[1:06:16] when they make a covenant one with
[1:06:17] another they take a little salt and
[1:06:19] throw it on one another that's a
[1:06:21] covenant a promise so something's going
[1:06:24] to confirm it when we make a covenant
[1:06:26] with one another we shake on it we shake
[1:06:29] hands
[1:06:31] how many can say those days are pretty
[1:06:34] much gone
[1:06:36] yeah yeah you better not
[1:06:40] all right unless he's a genuine believer
[1:06:42] Maybe
[1:06:45] put her there that's a covenant but in
[1:06:47] the Easter Orient during this time when
[1:06:50] they made a covenant they went and
[1:06:51] killed a beast and split it open and
[1:06:53] stood between the dead beast and they
[1:06:55] wrote out their Covenant hereby say a
[1:06:58] certain certain thing and they write a
[1:06:59] covenant their agreement and they take
[1:07:01] this agreement and tear it in two this
[1:07:03] is hidden too much much it carried in in
[1:07:07] two P two pieces one piece is given to
[1:07:09] one and the other one is given to the
[1:07:11] other one amen when this contract and
[1:07:14] they're taking oath over this deadbeats
[1:07:16] and say let my body be as this dead
[1:07:17] Beast if I don't keep my Covenant
[1:07:21] Hallelujah
[1:07:22] now watch God in his Spirit how God
[1:07:25] would be tore apart on the day of
[1:07:27] Calvary God was made flesh and dwell
[1:07:29] Among Us the Lord Jesus the Emanuel
[1:07:32] there are Calvary the Covenant God wrote
[1:07:34] with us he took Christ the calvary and
[1:07:37] tore him apart soul and body and he took
[1:07:39] his body up and set it at the right hand
[1:07:41] of his majesty and sent back his soul
[1:07:44] here his spirit
[1:07:45] on the earth to make a covenant to carry
[1:07:48] out that gospel amen
[1:07:51] and that same Dove that has same
[1:07:53] dovetail power that Jesus had he's the
[1:07:56] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:07:58] church has been given that Covenant
[1:08:00] through the baptism and of the Holy
[1:08:02] Ghost
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:06] I want to look at another
[1:08:08] uh that contract is John 3 16 whosoever
[1:08:13] believeth
[1:08:14] let's make a contract isn't that right
[1:08:16] and you make that contract and when you
[1:08:19] truly believe and you receive the
[1:08:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost you are
[1:08:23] receiving that other half of him
[1:08:26] how many believe that he tore himself
[1:08:29] apart he separated himself on the day of
[1:08:31] on the day of Pentecost and he went down
[1:08:33] to everyone that was believing and when
[1:08:35] you have that contract
[1:08:37] amen that's what we have
[1:08:40] and also not just
[1:08:42] uh
[1:08:45] John 3 16 but also in Saint John 4
[1:08:51] 14 and 12. very familiar scripture would
[1:08:54] that be that we want to bring he says
[1:08:56] verily verily I say unto you
[1:08:59] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:09:03] do shall he do also
[1:09:06] and Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:12] because I go to my father
[1:09:15] man
[1:09:19] Mark 16 says go into all the world and
[1:09:22] preach the gospel to Every Creature he
[1:09:24] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:09:27] saved
[1:09:29] and he that believeth not shall be
[1:09:31] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:09:34] that believe now most people as we know
[1:09:36] don't believe this part
[1:09:38] they don't believe in laying out enough
[1:09:39] hands and so forth
[1:09:41] casting out Devils taking up serpents
[1:09:43] and if they lands on the sick day
[1:09:45] shall recover
[1:09:48] Faith be to God how many knows we will
[1:09:50] need that we certainly need that in age
[1:09:52] that we're living in
[1:09:53] all right Greater Works than these shall
[1:09:55] do you because I go to my father because
[1:09:57] I go to my father and whatsoever you
[1:09:59] shall ask in my name
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:04] that will lie
[1:10:07] do
[1:10:09] praise the Lord that will I do
[1:10:14] amen if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:10:17] so if you'll notice what he's saying
[1:10:19] here
[1:10:20] if you truly believe on him and you
[1:10:23] receive that spirit
[1:10:24] you're going to do the very same things
[1:10:26] that Jesus Does
[1:10:29] and especially here in the message let
[1:10:31] me tell you especially in the message
[1:10:32] the church world can't identify with
[1:10:35] this
[1:10:36] amen God is not going to be partakers
[1:10:40] with a prostitute somebody denies their
[1:10:43] word right
[1:10:45] Panic the latest the greatest the most
[1:10:49] authentic Pentecostals back in 1960s two
[1:10:54] three and so forth
[1:10:55] got to the place after the seals as you
[1:10:58] know
[1:10:59] after the seals were opened and he
[1:11:01] preached denominationalism is the mark
[1:11:04] of the beast
[1:11:06] denominations are the mark of the beast
[1:11:09] he said because they rejected Christ
[1:11:12] and when he said that guess what
[1:11:13] happened
[1:11:14] the Pentecostal says if anybody goes up
[1:11:16] the brother bannon's meeting where Jesus
[1:11:18] is coming down Healing The Sick
[1:11:20] Discerning the thoughts of the body of
[1:11:22] the mind and so forth the same thing he
[1:11:24] does if we'll kick him out we'll take
[1:11:26] your name off the book
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:29] huh now you tell me that brother Brandon
[1:11:32] wasn't right
[1:11:34] exactly right because those that were in
[1:11:36] those denominations got to hate him for
[1:11:38] saying that because it was the truth
[1:11:41] because denominations do not dovetail
[1:11:45] with Christ
[1:11:46] they're going to believe what they want
[1:11:48] to believe no matter what the scripture
[1:11:49] says
[1:11:51] and right there
[1:11:52] you damn yourself
[1:11:55] people that just want to go their own
[1:11:57] way they damn themselves
[1:12:01] you want to do your own thing go ahead
[1:12:03] you might even be spiritual you might be
[1:12:05] able to speak in tongues and whatever
[1:12:06] but in the end you're going to be lost
[1:12:08] God then I'll just have that I'm not
[1:12:10] going to receive it
[1:12:12] amen what I want what you want to do on
[1:12:15] a daily basis is think the thoughts of
[1:12:17] God
[1:12:18] think the way that Jesus would think
[1:12:20] talk the way Jesus would talk act like
[1:12:22] Jesus without
[1:12:25] oh my
[1:12:26] and don't look too hard at yourself
[1:12:28] because you'll find where all your
[1:12:30] mistakes are where you haven't
[1:12:31] but look to him and say Lord From This
[1:12:33] Night on from this Wednesday night on
[1:12:35] right here some of those things that I
[1:12:38] know is not Christ like I want to shed
[1:12:39] it I want to see God take that away from
[1:12:41] me
[1:12:42] because I can't identify with John 4 14
[1:12:44] to 12. amen the same Works did I do
[1:12:48] shall you do also I tell you what I
[1:12:51] don't believe I don't care if it's
[1:12:52] sisters or whoever it is you got the
[1:12:54] power to walk on water like Peter did
[1:12:56] all the powers are to you just like any
[1:12:58] other believer
[1:13:00] amen doesn't have no variance between
[1:13:03] man or woman no it all belongs to you
[1:13:06] and if you could believe it
[1:13:09] don't you know people live how many know
[1:13:11] people live here in this world and in
[1:13:13] this country and they're happy living
[1:13:14] underprivileged
[1:13:17] you know and just a just an old you know
[1:13:20] drinking and just not a life at all
[1:13:23] hardly you know and they seem to be
[1:13:24] happy with that
[1:13:26] amen we don't want to be like that we
[1:13:28] don't want to be just well I'm a
[1:13:29] Christian I go to no no I want the full
[1:13:31] powers of God
[1:13:33] I want to be everything I can be in
[1:13:35] Christ Tommy's with me tonight
[1:13:37] it's about climbing higher in Christ
[1:13:40] going higher
[1:13:42] and well I'm gonna tell you something
[1:13:43] like just come to mind again forget your
[1:13:46] past
[1:13:47] forget your past
[1:13:49] look to the Future always every day
[1:13:51] look to the future I don't care what
[1:13:53] happened yesterday I don't care if it
[1:13:55] happened a couple hours ago see God I
[1:13:57] put it under the blood
[1:13:58] huh we're going forward
[1:14:01] I'm climbing higher
[1:14:04] how many months go higher
[1:14:06] if you're an eagle who hired in any
[1:14:08] other bird
[1:14:10] amen
[1:14:12] praise the Lord
[1:14:15] so what I did
[1:14:17] just to give you an example of a
[1:14:19] covenant they would take that paper and
[1:14:21] they would sign it and they would write
[1:14:22] their contract on it and they would rip
[1:14:23] it in half isn't that right
[1:14:28] they'd rip it in half
[1:14:31] praise be to God the works that I do
[1:14:34] shall ye do also in that right so I take
[1:14:37] a paper here
[1:14:41] I made a little Mark and I hope you all
[1:14:43] can see better than
[1:14:45] whatever but right here
[1:14:47] all right right there couple little
[1:14:49] scribble lines that's pretty close right
[1:14:50] look good
[1:14:52] see this is the groom and this is the
[1:14:54] bride this is Christ on the throne and
[1:14:56] this is you and I and when he went to
[1:14:58] Calvary when he went up North
[1:15:01] to heaven
[1:15:02] even up to heaven not North but anyway
[1:15:05] um he came back he sent his Spirit back
[1:15:08] down
[1:15:09] up north
[1:15:10] right send it back on the earth he
[1:15:13] stayed up there
[1:15:15] I can't I still can't figure it out
[1:15:18] just how he can be up there in his body
[1:15:19] be there because his body's there
[1:15:21] somewhere right
[1:15:22] you know yet his spirit is down here
[1:15:24] he's interceding for us you can only
[1:15:26] imagine but maybe somebody the gallery
[1:15:28] but
[1:15:29] set this back on the earth and when he
[1:15:32] comes back now notice in the final of a
[1:15:34] contract when the contract is finished
[1:15:36] those pieces come together and say all
[1:15:38] right it's done
[1:15:40] now we're talking about brother randomly
[1:15:42] that when the Rapture comes guess what
[1:15:44] that'll be the rapture
[1:15:45] when the contract is finished when he
[1:15:48] comes back to receive a bride is that
[1:15:51] right it's going to be like him the
[1:15:53] Bible says we're flesh of his flesh bone
[1:15:55] of his bone Spirit of his Spirit
[1:15:56] thinking of me thinking can I say
[1:15:59] acting always acting life of his life
[1:16:03] it has to be the same
[1:16:07] now what if he comes back and we take a
[1:16:10] paper like this
[1:16:12] and put it together
[1:16:15] huh somebody tell me what the problem is
[1:16:23] do the lines line up
[1:16:26] not the Lions don't line up things don't
[1:16:29] line up
[1:16:30] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:16:32] they shall recover well the days of
[1:16:34] Miracles is past
[1:16:36] doesn't fit
[1:16:38] there's a Miracles it don't it don't fit
[1:16:40] to try to say the days of Miracles just
[1:16:42] fit a a past
[1:16:44] if you'll notice it's not the right
[1:16:46] color it's a different thickness of
[1:16:48] paper it's not even the same texture of
[1:16:50] paper it's just nothing like it
[1:16:53] huh
[1:16:55] I wrote on here well our church don't
[1:16:57] believe that that's what this here is
[1:16:59] our church don't believe that
[1:17:01] tell somebody the word of God God sent a
[1:17:04] problem I don't believe uh come on oh
[1:17:06] I'll send you a milli to the prophet for
[1:17:07] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:17:09] huh
[1:17:12] whenever signs and wonders were done and
[1:17:14] very same thing oh boy I've been
[1:17:17] listening to some message where brother
[1:17:18] Brandon has really condemning the world
[1:17:20] in the church world for not accepting
[1:17:22] Christ and what he was doing
[1:17:24] in his ministry
[1:17:26] wasn't him he was his mouth how can you
[1:17:28] not see it amen because it was a
[1:17:30] terrible thing to reject Christ that way
[1:17:34] all right
[1:17:35] that's right
[1:17:38] call it mental telepathy
[1:17:41] don't line up Jesus said you call this
[1:17:45] you know they called him Beelzebub
[1:17:47] because because he discerned the
[1:17:48] thoughts and tens of the hearts that he
[1:17:50] was the chief of devil telepathy now
[1:17:52] they call it the Lefty which is also a
[1:17:54] devil that don't line up you know call
[1:17:56] it the telepathy and so forth the devil
[1:17:59] that don't lie well well let's try this
[1:18:01] one look at this here this is
[1:18:03] looking pretty close
[1:18:06] we got
[1:18:08] all the lines and everything there but
[1:18:10] you know but we're not looking at that
[1:18:11] side we're looking at this side
[1:18:13] all right so it's wow that's pretty
[1:18:14] close
[1:18:15] right but the other little John I said
[1:18:19] what's that are you guys trying to draw
[1:18:20] a comb here or something did you have a
[1:18:22] big calm brother about it no
[1:18:25] so anyway you look at that and say
[1:18:27] that's closer
[1:18:30] but guess what this is this is still
[1:18:32] everybody else's way
[1:18:33] huh
[1:18:35] this is where Matthew 24 44 I believe
[1:18:39] said that it would be so close that it
[1:18:41] was possible it would deceive the very
[1:18:43] leg
[1:18:45] I hate to say this but that's Among Us
[1:18:48] that's Among Us
[1:18:50] because we're the elect
[1:18:52] ORS not they're dead already
[1:18:55] so close that if you aren't careful
[1:18:56] it'll deceive the very elected he'll
[1:19:00] look closer but seal won't quite line up
[1:19:03] and guess how you can tell
[1:19:05] how can you tell
[1:19:08] by the fruits you shall know them
[1:19:11] amen
[1:19:13] praise the Lord
[1:19:16] when he comes back he wants somebody to
[1:19:18] say I believe every word
[1:19:22] [Applause]
[1:19:23] amen my spirit punctuates every word of
[1:19:26] God
[1:19:29] that's the truth I believe every word
[1:19:34] it'll not jump perfectly you'll have to
[1:19:38] say
[1:19:39] that Jesus had you'll have the same
[1:19:42] Spirit you'll have the same thinking
[1:19:46] and I think that's the word tonight we
[1:19:48] need to say Lord fill me with more of
[1:19:50] yourself
[1:19:52] fill me with more of that spirit because
[1:19:54] that's what he's coming for
[1:19:56] amen
[1:19:58] husband and a wife have to think alike
[1:20:00] they have to think it's amazing I just
[1:20:03] love it a lot of times a man sister
[1:20:05] Donna she'll I'll say sister my wife
[1:20:08] anyway she'll say something and I'll
[1:20:11] have been thinking the very same thing
[1:20:12] or it's like vice versa I believe that's
[1:20:14] the way it is with Jesus Christ we will
[1:20:16] think do it
[1:20:18] man shall not live by bread by a lot of
[1:20:22] pre-churchers can't say that
[1:20:24] a lot of churches say well it doesn't
[1:20:26] really matter
[1:20:28] huh
[1:20:29] it doesn't mean that
[1:20:32] huh
[1:20:33] it means this let me tell you something
[1:20:36] a preacher back here is at a worse place
[1:20:39] than anybody I know of when it comes to
[1:20:42] saying this is what it means
[1:20:44] you got to be careful with that I may
[1:20:45] know that you better have the correct
[1:20:47] meaning
[1:20:48] amen you can't miss place this uh the
[1:20:51] Bible or the word you can't misquote it
[1:20:54] amen you can't just believe it you got
[1:20:56] to be careful when you go to saying this
[1:20:58] is what it means because amen
[1:21:01] you know
[1:21:02] that's why I try to you'll hear me a lot
[1:21:05] of times and save it but the prophet God
[1:21:07] said amen
[1:21:09] there's a lot of New Revelations a lot
[1:21:10] of good things out there maybe sound
[1:21:12] good but it's better go with the prophet
[1:21:14] said it better go with the Bible said
[1:21:16] and you know something else I thought
[1:21:17] about while I was thinking on this I
[1:21:19] thought you know where brother Brandon
[1:21:20] went beyond a curtain of time and he was
[1:21:22] selling he was told that he was going to
[1:21:23] have to give an account for all of this
[1:21:25] you know and and so forth he said really
[1:21:27] he said well Paul we'll fall into it
[1:21:31] brother Brandon wasn't afraid he knew
[1:21:33] what he did
[1:21:34] he said well Paul that was his question
[1:21:36] to the angel will Paul have to give an
[1:21:38] account for what he did
[1:21:40] Angel says yes sir he was going to have
[1:21:42] to give him the cow well brother man
[1:21:43] about had a cheap leaping Joy he says
[1:21:45] well praise God
[1:21:47] if his makes it mine will make it
[1:21:50] amen because I taught what Paul taught
[1:21:54] how many believes that
[1:21:57] and where do we Rejoice on this side and
[1:21:59] those people over there we're resting I
[1:22:01] want to say we're standing on that
[1:22:04] we're resting on that we know that
[1:22:06] that's what it was we're resting we're
[1:22:07] standing on it
[1:22:09] amen praise be to God
[1:22:12] why because they stayed with the word
[1:22:16] stay with the word
[1:22:21] amen
[1:22:22] this is so full of nuggets
[1:22:26] so full of treasure so many things we
[1:22:29] can't even begin to almost name some of
[1:22:32] the great things that God that promises
[1:22:34] that he's made
[1:22:36] he has promised listen he says many are
[1:22:39] the afflictions of the righteous we're
[1:22:41] not promised the flowery bit of ease
[1:22:44] but we are promised that God will
[1:22:47] deliver them out of them all is that
[1:22:49] right
[1:22:50] God is always with us
[1:22:53] amen let your conversation I believe
[1:22:55] Paul said in Hebrews the last chapter be
[1:22:57] without covetousness and be thankful for
[1:23:00] such things as you have
[1:23:01] Fred the scripture says I will never
[1:23:05] leave you I was in perfect quote close I
[1:23:08] will never leave thee thee and neither
[1:23:11] will I for safety
[1:23:15] amen how many plan
[1:23:17] God Thomas never to leave us I don't
[1:23:19] care how bad it gets out there I don't
[1:23:21] care what the Curt and how bad yes God's
[1:23:24] never going to leave it's one of his
[1:23:25] child children
[1:23:27] can we go just a couple couple others
[1:23:29] yet
[1:23:31] John 10.
[1:23:35] and John 10 is another great promise
[1:23:40] foreign
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:47] if you'll notice I spoke Sunday on 10
[1:23:50] and 8 about all that ever came before me
[1:23:52] with thieves and robbers and so forth
[1:23:55] there's a lot of them that come around
[1:23:56] but over here
[1:23:59] but the sheep hear them not amen now
[1:24:02] verse 27 says my sheep
[1:24:04] hear my voice and I know them and they
[1:24:08] follow me
[1:24:10] and I give unto them eternal life and
[1:24:14] they shall never
[1:24:18] perish
[1:24:22] Glory I like that that's a promise of
[1:24:25] God that if you are his sheep
[1:24:28] he has promised that you'll never perish
[1:24:35] that's good enough for me but he's going
[1:24:37] to give you a little more is that okay
[1:24:38] you want a little more
[1:24:40] and neither shall any man pluck him out
[1:24:45] of my head
[1:24:49] oh praise be to God you talk about some
[1:24:53] good old-fashioned Baptist preaching
[1:24:56] huh
[1:24:58] because they believe in eternal security
[1:25:01] they believe this scripture and I'm
[1:25:04] saved I'm always saved God I'm gods I
[1:25:08] don't care how many cigarettes I smoke
[1:25:09] and how much drink beer I drink
[1:25:13] huh
[1:25:15] but are they right
[1:25:18] no they're not right
[1:25:21] why because if you truly are his God
[1:25:24] will wash you from all that stuff
[1:25:27] when you do know things it's against God
[1:25:30] you remember it shows you're not his
[1:25:33] man if you wish truly is you'd be a
[1:25:37] sheep and you'd act like a sheep
[1:25:39] not like a goat not like a sinner not
[1:25:42] like a smutty person from hell
[1:25:45] no it doesn't work that way
[1:25:48] just because you say your sheep don't
[1:25:50] make your sheep just because you say
[1:25:52] you're one of God's an eternally secure
[1:25:54] doesn't make you that way it has to be
[1:25:56] something that God did on the inside of
[1:25:59] you
[1:26:00] not words not your mind it has to be God
[1:26:03] it has to be something he has done in
[1:26:06] your life
[1:26:09] I'm about to jump on this open folks
[1:26:16] why am I
[1:26:18] myself
[1:26:22] when I think about
[1:26:26] where I started
[1:26:30] and what he's brought you through
[1:26:33] and he's brought you through and brought
[1:26:36] you through and brought you through it
[1:26:38] shows he's done the work he has begun to
[1:26:41] work
[1:26:42] and he will perform and it's a promise
[1:26:45] for
[1:26:46] oh my I wish I could fly
[1:26:49] he promised he would perform but he'd do
[1:26:51] it
[1:26:55] you want to get away from God as a child
[1:26:57] of God all I can say is good luck
[1:27:00] you're gonna need it
[1:27:04] because you're dealing with God's hand
[1:27:06] folks
[1:27:08] yeah you ain't getting away from him oh
[1:27:11] you'll be the most miserable creature
[1:27:13] and
[1:27:15] you'll come crawling in them doors say
[1:27:17] God I can't handle it anymore
[1:27:20] go ahead
[1:27:24] amen I believe in eternal security
[1:27:28] I don't believe that God Saves you to
[1:27:30] lose yeah
[1:27:32] now I don't believe so
[1:27:35] amen
[1:27:37] and he says my Father which is greater
[1:27:40] than me is greater than all no man is
[1:27:43] able to pluck them out of my father's
[1:27:45] hand
[1:27:46] and one by the way
[1:27:48] he's right here
[1:27:49] he's in me he said I am my father are
[1:27:52] why
[1:27:54] do you realize that's the very reason
[1:27:55] that the Jews took up stones to Stone
[1:27:57] Jesus is because he made himself God
[1:28:01] yeah
[1:28:02] of God he says you make yourself God
[1:28:07] oh I'd like to preach them Pharisees
[1:28:10] huh I said he is God
[1:28:13] how many times Jesus preached to him but
[1:28:15] he still wouldn't listen
[1:28:17] I am a father alone you know and so
[1:28:19] forth
[1:28:20] praise be to God I love this promise
[1:28:24] shall never perish

[1:28:29] him out of my hands your mind
