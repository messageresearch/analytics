to see everyone tonight can be seated for just a little bit if you'd like invite my mother to come my mom is with me tonight and uh if you'd like to know where the singing in my comes from right there's the guilty amen and uh i wanted to come and and sing a song with me if she will and so by the help of the lord we're gonna just enjoy the word of god tonight and i'm certainly thankful to be here as always we're so thankful to brother tom for allowing time and uh i just really my feeling i just feel like it's just a real blessing of the lord to be here with you i sure love you folks and appreciate you and i want to ask you to pray for a little situation uh i had a boy today that for the last several days has been trying to do a little contract and work there at the house and real bad shape he's on drugs and he showed up today high eyes bloodshot and all kinds of things carrying on cussing throwing things hollering i had to ask him to leave and just take his tools and go home and after a few hours of him carrying on he's in my backyard and i'm trying to pray them through the lord jesus he's crying asking god for mercy pray for this boy will you his name is russ harris i want you to hold him before the lord god don't put people like wait for no some help he needs some real help so pray for him if you will evidently he's um got himself in some trouble with the law of drugs you know and things and so next week he may be committed incarcerated for a bit i don't know he's talking about maybe having to go to jail but i stood there by him and as i listened that his story i thought about the lord jesus when he come up on that woman at the well and him standing there like that looking at her and i thought now wouldn't this be almost the same kind of picture if jesus was standing here like this and then it hit me he has no hands but our hands he has no eyes but our eyes no ears but our ears and i told the young man i said listen i said if the lord jesus was here he might look at you and say go and sin no more lest a great thing might come on you later on time but uh i said jesus is here he's just standing here with my hands and my eyes and my thoughts well there's a little bit much for him to handle but he said there's something about you he said i know that's different i said well i'll tell you what's the different part i said a little piece of god living right here and that's what you're wanting you need that but you don't know how to get there and then he started crying you're right he said i'm completely out of control he said i don't have power or anything and uh just real sad to see people bound like that so if you would just hold him up in prayer i think maybe his uh he told me one thing he said that everywhere he looks he sees demons like this and just while we were standing there i thought well when people get into drugs and things like that they hallucinate and see things i kindly felt in my spirit like he might be being tormented by evil spirits as well might be why you're seeing that so i've used this expression for a long time now my brother brown with them prayer lines and them demons saw they needed help they started crying brother joe help me help me get him to disbelieve and i've used the remark i stole it from a friend of mine but i use the remark on time demons had enough sense to be able to call for help when they got in trouble saints ought to be able to do the same thing and just like you folks when you prayed for me when i was in the hospital i didn't have faith enough for myself i knew god was gonna bring me out but i didn't i couldn't pray for myself and those situations like that you know how it is it's hard to pray for you hard to believe for you and saints of god were rallying around me and believing for me well let's do this with man just believe god will do something for him let's he ain't got the faith so let's have it for him and pray for him if you would and i know you don't know him and as far as knowing him from adam you wouldn't know him at all but if you trust me and you trust that i got a good judgment then you just trust me when i say he he needs help so we love you god bless so nice to be back in the house of the lord and i want my mama to come and sing you'll have to walk all the way upstairs i know it's a it's a journey [Laughter] you grab that rail well you want a mic down there you just won't come by me okay all right thank you brother thank you you're not that old he said here brother david's got your mic right here mama 85 years young my mama [Applause] all right thank you for praying for my baby when he was so sick i appreciate that [Music] too many miles behind me too many trials are true [Music] too many tears [Music] there's too much to gain to lose to me [Music] [Music] rivers on my [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and i've crossed the heart [Music] struggling in the right room [Music] [Applause] [Music] is one word i don't use amen because [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's too much [Music] too many treasures are waiting over yonder there's too much [Music] hallelujah can you say amen to that oh praise the lord i think all of us can honestly say that there is too many things behind us i can honestly say that we're at a stage now if we're not we should already be that there's more behind us than there ever will be before us we've crossed so many rivers and things behind us if the devil tried to get you to turn back now hopefully at this part of your journey there's something inside of you that says are you kidding me i've come too far to turn around now hallelujah amen i like this little course now this is a congregational but i want to sing it it says like this i'll stand for jesus let the world [Music] he will supply we'll walk together my lord and i stand for jesus and let the world go by i'll stand for jesus second if you know it and let the world go by i'll claim his promise he will supply we'll walk together my lord and i will stand for jesus and let the world go by we'll stand for jesus and let the world go by man i'll claim his promise [Music] he will supply we'll walk together my lord and i how about it we'll stand for jesus and let the world go by stand for jesus and let the world pass by acclaim his promise amen he will supply willow walk together my lord and i will stand for jesus and let the world go by we'll walk together my lord and not for jesus and let the world go by let it pass on life how many feels that way shout amen praise the lord and hallelujah all right tonight stand with me stand with me samuel let's get right into the word of god if you have your bible philippians chapter 2 and how appreciative we are surely enjoyed all of the music the singing and everything and it just so happened sister had the song i wanted right open on that page over there so i like that spiritual people look for spiritual things and i don't think that's a coincidence amen hallelujah you love the lord really really really do you i i i'm kind of guessing at this point i want you to convince me one time do you really love him yeah i know that sounded like believers i know he knows and amen all right philippians chapter 2 verse 5. i want to speak to you this evening the lord helping us upon overcoming by the cross overcoming by the cross all right let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god now watch this first brother brown talks about more faith this word form immorphy god changing himself from one thing to another to another to another but made of himself no reputation he ain't like our guys today the kingdom bill jesus had no interest in that and he took upon him what the form of a service now we've got two forms you have one man standing here in the form of god and same man standing there in the form of a servant so he immorphed himself or changed his form into this cross right here he crossed himself with man and god y'all got a big cross here usually you've got some in the church you've seen the old rugged cross symbols if if we had one to point to like this let's pretend it's here hey oh that's a good one yeah thank you that's that'll work normally we'd say something like this is the cross that saved me let's close i'm going to do my best to get you so riled up before we even start i don't have to worry about working you up right now that's not the cross that saved me many men died on the cross just like that brother tom matter of fact there were two thieves on either side of him when he died the death of the cross brought forth life but it's not the what it's the who because the real cross that saved me was the cross between god and man indictment message brother brahman says like this who is that hanging on that old rugged cross the prince of life the lord of glory it wasn't just a man hanging there it was almighty god in a form of a god in a form of a servant he crossed himself and that's what saved me let's pray together for the word lord jesus what a privilege it is to stand here in your presence lord we are at ready on the edge of our seat to hear from you our hearts are wide open and we are receptive oh god thank you for this beautiful people tonight lord i love preaching to him so much of all my evangelistical journeys lord i just appreciate the honest spirit that's amongst this little body come in this place tonight lord and minister to all of us be included don't leave a one of us out lord if we need healing give it to us we pray if we need deliverance may you visit us with it whatever we have need of tonight god let that be the thing that you give to us we ask for it as you would bless your word and the speaker and the listener and all of this together in jesus name and the church said amen may be seated may the lord bless you now notice this next part when he says that he took upon him the form of a servant it was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man everybody say as a man very good he humbled himself and became obedient unto death on even the death of the cross now he's talking about this cross here he became obedient to the death of the cross you know jesus could have chose to die god i should say could have chose for jesus to die in any way it didn't have to be crucifixion he could have let him die in a car accident he could let him be assassinated he could have let any kind of death take place all it would have had to be is for the prophets to prophesy about what kind of end that the son of god would come to but the reason we know that god chose this way is because the old rugged cross will become a symbol of salvation for the entire world thank god it is because this symbol represents everything that we hold dear in christianity but let's not stop there remember the prophet of god said that many men as he said i quoted to you a moment ago he said many men died upon there but how we know that jesus was who he said he was was because after he had died after he had been buried within three days before corruption could touch one holy cell he rose again in the resurrection amen listen i am in the easter seal and in the easter seal messages he says that proved what calvary was all about hallelujah showing that it wasn't just a man being put by corporal punishment this would be the equivalent in their modern time as somebody going to an electric chair or somebody being executed by lethal injection this was capital punishment for the romans and it wasn't the what you see catholics and these people they get so hung up on the what they sell crosses and they you know they put them on the market and they have rummage sales and little crosses every which away and in their mindset that cross that cross this old rugged cross these two pieces of wood represented deliverance and salvation for the entire world but it wasn't those two pieces of wood to save me hallelujah no and it wasn't it wasn't that cross that brought me redemption it was the who that was hanging on that wood hallelujah that brought redemption to you and i it was that cross between god and man all right now i'm about to get in trouble brother tom i love you and i'm about to get in trouble here here we go i'm going to preach a little god head to you tonight all right now we need to talk about jesus who he was first of all let me get this out of your mind because if i start heading the direction i'm heading immediately you might start thinking well two lord i don't believe in a trinity and i don't believe in a trinity all right i don't believe in two gods but there's a thing that we have to understand about the lord jesus in order to get the godhead right because if we don't see the godhead correctly we cannot see ourselves correctly you believe that say amen in order for us to see our correctly we've got to be able to identify this cross because there'll be a part of you that ain't nothing but man nothing but you that that's uh humanity and whatever more soaked in sin and all that but there'll be a part of you that's god and that god part is absolutely not an heir with this human part by no means and what we have to kind of take into our human spirit is that in order for us to receive salvation the only way that we could be saved is when god would then take upon him the form of a servant now we know how this goes when jesus was the birth of the lord jesus was coming it was upon this wise mary being found with child of the holy ghost all right now we're not oneness people we do not believe that the flesh of jesus christ was the holy ghost he was conceived by god god was his father that's your cue to save man god was his mother come on now help me amen and god was the one that brought that body amen into its creative conception of state where mary then brought it to birth somebody said to me one time but brother ben if if mary then by the umbilical cord fed that body that didn't she also contribute her human part into that body i said no i said the fella i was talking to he was a dog raiser and i said when you raise your dogs do you feed them he said of course i do i said right i said but when you feed your dog some kind of a little certain you know conglomeration or whatever you give to them does that turn that dog into a chicken or change it into a rooster or change it into a into a into is it absolutely not i said why because the cells that made it a dog in the beginning all you did was feed those cells amen come on somebody amen so jesus was a created body jesus was not born eternal jesus was not born the holy ghost the holy ghost proceeded from jesus after death burial and resurrection but jesus's flesh was not the eternal spirit god amen i might have to do the amen and two while i'm preaching for a little bit but that's all right i don't mind you listening that's good i want you listening in church now pay attention to this next remark because this is where we have to get it straight many many years ago and i could call some brothers names and you'd know who they are and they preached the two lord and the two god and they got it all mixed up that jesus was no more than just your elder brother that jesus was just you know the son of god but he wasn't god himself now many of these brethren by the time when they first started this back in 1991 i had just started on the field myself and i traveled and listened to these brothers preach some of them were close personal friends of mine for many years and one brother started in on this whole thing that you know jesus was not spirit god and jesus was separate from the holy ghost and jesus was this and jesus was that and i called him on the carpet so to speak when he was on the steps of the church i said brother i said please listen to me i said everything you are saying about the lord jesus is absolute correct until you come to that resurrection and when you come to the resurrection if you don't make it body spirit and soul god all the way through it you've got a trinity an idolatry you've got a trinity amen you got two and i said in order for you to get it right you've got to take that body and make it all god after the resurrection i said or you're a heathen plain and simple before the resurrection the son could say the son the body does nothing but what he first sees the father do the things that i do he said is not of me he said but the father that dwelleth in me you can't keep that state the same way after the resurrection because we don't have a son of god sitting up on the throne and the holy ghost running down like a little wild man and dodie old god grandfather up here at the long beard sitting on the throne next to him john when he looked on that holy spirit when jesus ascended back up his body his spirit is so all that he was transformed back into that pillar of fire paul met him on the road to damascus amen when he saw him out there and he called that light lord and that light that recalled lord spoke back brother joe and said i am jesus whom you persecute he put him right back together at the resurrection prior to his death and his burial and resurrection jesus had a time he started amen everybody all right she ain't gonna pass out anybody need a break for a heart pressure or heart blood pressure building amen blood pressure all right are you doing good all right notice before the resurrection he could feel pain he could feel temptation before the resurrection the lord jesus could stand right there and be made fun of and ridicule and his feelings could get hurt he could experience what it meant to feel cold stifling across his body to feel sickness enter into his human temple but after the resurrection they're not a demon or demon power or demon diseased germ that could ever touch him again once he was glorified brother batman said god became god again all of it put together now i know your question you might be thinking to yourself yeah but what about when he sees her sees him in the uh when mary or martha which one was it mary i think met him in the garden one and mary or martha one of them and he says i think it was mary and and he said don't touch me don't touch me yet remember that he said i haven't ascended yet he said but you go tell my disciples i go to your god and i go to my god i go to your father and i go to my father and one fellow said to me now see there two of them speaking i said pardon me i said but your argument is weaker than the broth made from a shadow of a chicken starred half to death i said anybody knows what god means god is an object of worship and jesus the created being had a father that's the mystery of the godhead and how we got saved is that father spirit god created a body that he could cross himself in so he could experience what we experienced humankind it was jesus of worship who do you all think he was praying to when he said father hallowed be thy name he was worshipping god just like you and i worship god praise the lord who was his father almighty god we don't believe we had two fathers now we don't believe he had two fathers remember a spirit cannot die a spirit can't feel pain a spirit cannot feel loss a spirit cannot be overcome with sickness or depression or oppression or fear or nervousness spirit god had no understanding of what it meant for a king to live in this hellhole that we live in so god said i'm going to create a body so i can cross myself with them so i can understand what it is they're going through that ought to make every one of you shout hallelujah and praise the lord right now notice when jesus was then conceived now let me read to you a statement here at the church age but where brother i'm talking about this body he said it could not have been god he said crossing himself i'll just put it in my language here in other words he said it couldn't have been god using her egg he said to cross himself with i'm just paraphrasing to save time i don't want to get too late on us but in other words if it would have been her human ovum that the holy ghost would have taken a seat of life a germ cell or a sperm cell and mixed it with that human ovum that human ovum from mary would have been absolutely sinful mankind producing another body because it would have been a god cell and a fallen hybrid cell crossing itself up together and folks that's what put us here in the first place was crossing them two things up in the beginning amen tree of knowledge of good and evil in anybody that's what brought us here in the first place there's an expression in the world is what brought us to the dance amen you probably heard that one amen that's what got us in this condition in the first place was that god a holy pure cell amen was taken a woman that was created by god as a byproduct and under that holy veil she mixed herself with the serpent that's what put us in that state in the first place amen and the only way that god could have changed that he couldn't have took one cell not one chromosome not one speck of dna from any human being on this planet if you would have done a dna test on jesus christ you would have never found not another living relative on this planet but you would have found a relative if you'd have looked at spirit god because jesus was a direct descendant from almighty god in so much he called himself equal with god god crossing himself taking the form of man and taking the form of god and he crossed them together and that's where jesus comes from now let's let's look at something in the beginning then now when you pick this up and you i'm going to say a couple things here now this may sound a little a little rough but all right talks in condemnation by representation about eve he said eve was the mother of high breeding he said miss the human race when she had this affair with the serpent which was not a serpent the bible said he was most supple of all the beasts of the field he said science now trying to find the bones of some creature between a monkey and a man you see that all the time these gigantic skulls and these jobs and all of these things and they think they found the missing link the bible tells us where that mr link was at he said trying to apply it to the colored race we would say today the black race african-americans he said they're as ignorant as they can be the serpent was a man praise god the blood of an animal won't mix with the blood of a human no sir but this species was so close until he did mix with eve now look at what that low down good for nothing rotten low down devil did he saw an opportunity to enter into the human race he saw this creature that was so close to adam that he looked like perhaps just as much of a man as a man would look like today but brother bradman when you read the serpency message you think yourself he talks a lot about the serpent you think well what was the mystery of the serpency he didn't even get down to the affair and he didn't get down to the sin of it he just kept talking about serpent hello hello that was the key of it that was the guy that caused all the problem in the beginning because he was a vehicle that the devil used to enter into the human race he was smart enough to know the devil was smart enough to be able to look at that woman and how that the rest of creation would bring forth it meant through sex reproduction and all of a sudden a thought hit his mind i wonder if i could get control of this man he tried it one day no doubt brother talked about how satan will enter into animals and things like that i wonder if there was a beast going through the garden of eden and the devil tried to influence and he found out hey i can do something here you know maybe she was going through the garden of eden and saw the serpent going through the field and the devil said let's take a test run yay eve and he hears the serpent repeat it back yay eve and he thought oh we got something here no telling how many moments or years or days or months or centuries or whatever it might have been had passed before satan made his move because remember he told us that the serpent had a place for a soul but he had no soul so satan took his soul you say has a soul thou hast sin thy soul has sinned why are they falling from heaven or lucifer he tells him how his soul had sinned so he took his soul of what he was placed it in that serpent and took possession of that creature once the serpent and eve had crossed their dna naturally it was the serpent seed created but spiritually satan crossed himself into the human race and it produced death every ambulance you ever hear every funeral you ever tend every year somebody sneeze or wipe their nose it was because of that cross right there that god sent the memory in and folk i want to tell you something there is not enough message books there's not enough message churches or message preachers to separate that sin from your dna no matter how long you wear your dress or how much you don't cut your hair sister brother no matter how much you behave yourself and and act like a gentleman as this boy told me today well i'm a good person i said there's what you're failing none of us are good the bible said all have sinned and come short of the glory of god you'll never separate this from your dna it's a part of you now the difference between you and i was are you and jesus i mean to say between me you and jesus i'm trying to say is that jesus was influenced externally lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life you and i have it internal and external you ever do anything and then say to yourself why in the devil did i do that what did i do that for do you know that they have even proved in science that a little piece of your ancestors no matter how far back it goes every ancestor you've ever had you got a little piece of them inside of you so if your great-great-great-great-grandfather if he was a a flander and and maybe they had a smart like attitude don't let it surprise you too bad when them things just pop out they're hiding in there brother joe they're hiding in there all of that amen is crossed up in your dna somebody say amen that's what put us in this mess in the first place she hybrid us and satan entered into the human race by way of spirit and the evil okay let's look at it now here you have cain and abel standing at the altar right a message called true and false vine 3 11 56 the prophet of god said cain and abel came to the altar with the same faith both boys believed god both boys were not communists he said they came as believers swallow that one for a little while that'll tell you why message people need the holy ghost right there you can be a believer all day long but you must be born again you can't just sit in church and pretend this message you've got to have it living inside of your heart by new birth amen help me somebody and the prophet said they build their altars right at the spot in eden where they were kicked out abel is standing at the altar with a dead lamb on his altar cain has got the fruits of the garden you know the story he's got everything decorated standing there you know he might have been one of these guys yeah yeah that's the catholics if you don't know what i'm talking about he might have had incense burning ain't no telling it must have been a real sign now watch whenever god looks down now you heard me quote this before but when the bible said he had respect on the eighth abel's offering that means that fire proceeded from god and licked up that offering and now cain sees god except abel and he gets mad huh mad anger where'd that come from and now not only is he mad but he's jealous huh i wonder where that come from now you're looking at cain from the outside probably tall like his daddy probably good looking like his daddy religious like his daddy but now all of a sudden something comes out of this boy and watch how god does this folks watch when god reveals it to abel it is a personal revelation to abel but when he tells cain how to get right he don't reveal it personally to cain he says do like your brother there and you shall be accepted that's what god wants to do with you tonight he wants to make you a billboard he wants to give you such a revelation in your heart amen and shake you before the world and tell sinners you want to get right do like my boy and my girl right here and you'll get right he never come to cain personally he said do like your brother he pointed to the manifestation of abel's revelation and said do like him and you'll be all right goes to prove that only god can reveal it to his own oh why don't that make you shout louder it ought it ought to make you cry and scream because you know how many tens of thousands of people will go on their pillow tonight and go to sleep and god ain't never talk to them not the way he talks to you come on somebody help me now not the way that he did abel when he revealed it when he was sitting back here on that pastor no doubt as i heard brother teach him one morning how they said maybe abel was laying back up against the rock and he said we'll think maybe he said he looked over them sheep and he saw him bringing forth in the springtime i've never forgot this little example you used he said he was laying up against that rock and he said all of a sudden one of them lambs went and it struck him i bet that's how we got here you imagine what the conversation the dinner table might have looked like adam eve cain and abel maybe a little abel mama how would get here they get past the skies blue after a while if you all don't know that just hang on it's coming why is the sky blue why is it so i remember years ago when elizabeth was a little girl and the sun was setting and she said where's the sun going mama where's it going we had a friend in australia that time and she said going all straight to see our friend but eventually that little conscious of theirs that little god part inside of them that sensitivity of that holy spirit touch that's birthed in all of us starts asking the question how'd i get here you imagine what it must have been like when abel looks at adam and eve and say why is my brother so much bigger than me remember the prophet of god said that serpent was ten foot tall where the giants come from y'all men of renown in the days of genesis the sons of god sees the daughters of men and that day dwelt giants cain's people smart people i don't mean just because you're smart you're the lineage of cain having a good brain doesn't necessarily mean that you're influenced by evil things frankly i wish we'd be baptized a bit more a good brain in these days i could use a few more doses but artificers of brass and instruments some of the first people to create musical instruments were canes now you've got cain looking at abel and now he's angry to the point he wants to kill his brother does somebody please tell me where did that murderous ungodly filthy spirit where did that ever come from in that boy satan had crossed himself into the human race and now that sin visits generation after generation after generation after generation until 6 000 years later we become the dumping bucket for all of their past sins brother if this doesn't reveal to you why you need the holy ghost and why you need to be born again you're blind as a bat this is why you'll never overcome on your own steam this is why you'll never overcome just by memorizing a bunch of quotes come on somebody this is the reason why you'll never get any farther without jesus on the inside working to the outside because you ain't just fighting you you're fighting years of sludge years of sin years of things like that oh you said brother ben do you fight listen jesus lived 33 and a half years and never made a mistake i can't go 33 and a half seconds without doing something wrong why is that i'm hanging on a tree tonight the tree of knowledge of good and evil i'm hanging on that tree and every time my heart beats i get a little bit closer to its final destination the fruit of it is death thereof look at how paul described it he said a wicked tree jesus even said the same word emulation wrath strife heresy seditions where does all of that come from it didn't come from just one man walking in the garden called serpent it was when the devil crossed himself with that serpent and then planted all of that right down in the womb of eve and then all of this on the other side because of the law of god the soul that sinner shall die you can have your token over your kids you can have your token of your family all that does is you're claiming them you're earmarking them for god to do something in their lives without that token there's not another person that's planning to ever pray for you're the ones that hold that ear mark over their lives that god can deal with them but if they're not willing to let the holy ghost separate from them the sin that easily besets them amen not all of our our people will be saved no noah had three sons one of them was an absolute devil his name was ham some people think ham is still the devil hope you get that joke anyways we're moving on [Laughter] but when you look at what he was look at him he's the very reason why we have the tower of bible ham comes out the very first thing they start doing they come out with religion because folk satan is a religious creature satan is not a drunk hanging in an alley or a gutter in a bar room the devil that's sin sort of that sin but that ain't the sin that's going to deceive the world the world ain't deceived by budweiser hello come on talk to me the world ain't deceived by marijuana i didn't say right then the world ain't deceived by none of that kind of stuff the world is deceived by religion all whose names were not wrote on the land's book of life they fell down and worshiped the beast the false prophet and so on so forth they took the mark of the beast this is why religion is still today the most deadly force on the face of this planet a preacher and platform can do more damage to the souls of mankind than all the beer joints in the nation because that's the thing that's been bred into us see religion without the holy ghost now you see the way that that this goes you see the direction of this now listen to these words now the prophet of god thank you jesus oh i just i love it don't you now the prophet of god said that mary then brought this holy child to birth now remember the immaculate conception says that mary was so holy that she could give a part of herself to the holy ghost to produce the body of jesus christ with what i just described to you how in the world could she have ever crossed herself with god and produced the holy body of jesus christ that blood was created by god right it the blood cells of jesus was not brought here by the tree of knowledge of good and evil you believe that's amen right there said that would not have produced the last man adam god not mary provided that body oh but how the devil liked it believe it would have been you see because satan knew how we got here he knows what it looks like you imagine when mary was brother carol you see his example a lot he said you know a woman be standing there at the stove cooking sausage and smell him she has to grab her mouth like in morning sickness you know and maybe she was standing there at the stove one morning and all of a sudden she turned green as we say the devil said i've seen that before then they go down through a process of time or belly of course now i'm beginning to swell because the body is beginning to grow and somebody walks over and says hey you you got a child satan says yeah seen all that before normal same as always she comes through the process where she's getting ready to give birth and she hits what they call braxton hicks false labor her body is preparing itself for the deliverance of this child so she's standing in the market one day and a pain shoots through ah get joseph i remember the first time that pain hit samantha we were standing in a walmart i thought she was going to climb the shelves i'm not laughing at her cause it's funny it just amen but the devil looked down and said i've seen that before now they're coming to the time of the burst he breaks the water the blood is coming forth and jesus comes forth a crying baby there's a placenta and there's an umbilical cord did you know adam didn't have a belly button because adam had no mother god was his mother he wasn't tied to the earth like you and i are our belly button is proof that we're connected to that tree of knowledge of good and evil and when jesus was born and the umbilical cord is connected to the placenta which is the little center where the woman uh sends in the new the nutrients and so forth for the baby to receive his food and things and the devil looked said it's got a belly button it's got a placenta it's got an umbilical cord i know it was born off the tree of knowledge of good and evil this is why matthew 4 he said if thou be the son of god you wonder how could he have ever doubted it because when he looked at the natural birth it looked exactly like every other baby that was born oh but nanny nanny devil that was the secret that was the mystery that was hiding underneath this birth think of it friends why did isaiah prophesy a virgin shall conceive watch you have to be a virgin because the other part was what gave us the cross that's what crossed us up in the first place so the only way that jesus could uncross us was to create another cross praise god this is why in luke 9 23 jesus said if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me now my cross may not look like yours your cross may not be like mine and my cross may not be like this one or that one and vice versa around but if i'm going to follow the lord i've got to take up my cross you see i got my daddy's nose and my mama's forehead but i've also got their temper i've also got their impatience whatever was passed to them is also passed down to me it was an inheritance in the natural birth oh jesus that tree is what put me in this cross in the first place did you know that brother brown said even drinking and gambling is a strain in a person's life it's passed through families down to other people i had a man just the other morning in indiana had come and he asked for prayer and he said brother ben he said i did good with alcohol i stayed alcohol free i was delivered he said then my wife was cooking in the house and had a little bottle of wine sitting on the table and was cooking with it he said i got that bottle and took a sip and i was hooked again i said you know why i said because that stuff was born in your cells i want you to listen to me carefully when you got saved there were certain things that god took from you immediately you know why i did it he did it because he knew you couldn't whip it on your own but there were also things that were left in you the bible calls it superfluity if you study that it means carryover or residue there were things that were left in you y'all want an example pride stubbornness it's usually a complex he said that causes this i've watched it by discernment thousands of those that had that complex he said and they inherited it from their mother and their father so when you were a cigarette sucker any suckers in here you were an alcoholic or whatever you were womanizer manizer that's not the right one but you get my boy and you come to the altar and you got yourself right with god and god just took him things from you but when you receive the holy ghost he could not separate that temper from your dna you know why he left it there if he took the one because he knew you couldn't whip it then he left the other because he knew you could [Laughter] whoo somebody preached to me he left it in you because he knew you had the ability to whip it if my temper would have never been a thing that i could have ever overcome god would have fixed me in a way i'd have never had another temper again as long as i live but the very fact he let that cross through me is evidence god says i know you can whip it don't worry about it i i know you can overcome it don't worry about it just keep eating that word just keep drinking from the waters of life amen my grace will be sufficient for you you see friends that this is not i'm not against an older call but this is why we've got to get in our mind we've got to understand coming to an altar and beating and screaming and hollering and crying that's good but until you start recognizing the very thing that's tormenting you is in this dna and you're never going to separate it the only thing you can do is get someone in there that knows how to overcome it [Music] is it any wonder why the bible said greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world the cross that's what put me in this condition my mother not that one but mother eve she entered she introduced all kinds of things watch now romans chapter 8 verse 1. you got your bible turn there with me romans 8 1. i'm about to perform a miracle tonight i'm getting ready to close [Music] oh god some of y'all holiday man i heard it no i'm just kidding i mean about that part not the closing part i am getting very close romans chapter 8 verse 1. now notice the lead up to this the build up to this romans 7 romans 7 is where paul is speaking about the duality of man the good i would that's the things i don't do the things i don't want to do that's the things i find myself doing now a lot of people put themselves in a condition when they read that chapter to say well see there ain't nothing i can do about it the problem with most folks is they never read far enough down you ever take a medicine all of a sudden it does a little something to you and you're wondering how in the world it happened but the problem was you only read that part of the bottle you didn't read the rest of it same thing here you can't read half the prescription believe me you got to keep going to romans chapter 8 verse 1 because once you understand that in your flesh dwells no good thing once you understand that combination that mixture that cross once you understand that your body is going to be that black dog until the day it's changed and it ain't never going to change no matter how much make it live right no matter how much you take it to church or drag it to a prayer closet make it pray you can never separate this from dna there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus this word condemnation right here you know what it means it means that the judge has carried out his final sentence he has swing the gavel and he has carried out his final sentence i learned that when a person is justified do you know what real justification of the law is when you're dealing with a dead man if he's dead you can't hold anything against him you can't charge him with anything you can't find him with anything you can imprison him he's dead that's what's called justification of the law hallelujah and praise the lord when you got the holy ghost you became dead in christ and there's no charges against you oh but you say i still have the holes in my ears and the tattoos on my arm but there's no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus i might have been born in this brother joe but i am not tied to it by the way of my soul hallelujah and praise the lord who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now see we got real revival preaching until we read these next parts they hear a lot of times people say my choice my choice i chose let me show you about your worthless good-for-nothing choice the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh so you know how we like to brag around this message about what we chose and what we didn't choose and what we anybody here on sunday say you're going to go to mexican and wound up in chinese anybody let me tell you about your choice if you think your choice is what made you saved what you need to know is that you were just anointed or smart enough i don't even know the right word for it but enough happened where god could jam his foot in the door and take over and do the rest because you're sitting here looking at me the same way i'm looking at you i tell god i want to serve him today something bad comes along and i resign from christianity come on don't look at me like that preach to me your choice don't even mean that you wake up in the morning you say i'm gonna have ham and eggs and now i'm gonna have ham and eggs and one on the heart isn't getting a biscuit at the end of the day brother if you think your choosing is so important then i want to ask you a question now i'm not saying that any important don't misunderstand me but if you think it's soul prime at the top of the list and it must be there i'm going to ask you one question why did abraham stand before god and hear god say the words because i don't trust you and i don't trust any other human i can swear by no greater so i'm going to swear by myself so y'all don't mess this up because you know why you'd say yes to god today and in a month from now you're saying no i wish that i never said it come on somebody be honest with me tonight our choice yeah it's weak through the flesh folks it's weak it's the weakness of the law mind you brother david when god visited me i had to say yes sure i had to accept it right i had to say amen yes lord i want it thank god somehow i hit the sweet spot i still really know how to describe the thing because the more i study this the more i think man it is a miracle that i even said yes oh the halos are a shiner tonight for each brother ben come on it's a miracle that i even stopped long enough to say oh yes lord here i am come on sir we got ourselves so pumped up in this method i made the choice no you didn't god chose you before the world began and if it hadn't been for that choice you would have never been able to say yes the words would have never even come out of your mouth hallelujah the fact that he chose me brother was the very reason his anointing could fall on me just long enough for jam his foot in the door don't worry joe i'll take over from here the lord jesus was a new cross brother ma'am i got quotes laying up every time then beginning creation of god it was a new creation listen be careful we're going to go home the first creation now if you go to the book of peter future home the old world and the new world right the old world was built eve all the rest of them was built with a weakness in them so they could fall all of it the tigers the bears the lions oh my few smiles all right there are some wizard of oz watchers in here all of that was built so it could fall botany life trees wood fibers anything you want to think of it was built so it could fall brother john eve was predestinated he said listen to those words she was predestinated so she could fall the weakness was already built into them oh but i love this makes me want to dance when god recreated this bride and he changed her in this new thing where old things pass away and all things become new i am so born again a god that not even god can break the seal over my soul because once i am sealed he can't take it back and us that are virgin born by his holy spirit even our bodies will be changed to not even ever reflect this weakness that was built into us when brother brown went beyond the curtain of time he said then women come hugging him he said now look any man a woman hugging on him like that's gonna have thoughts and think things or whatever have a sensations the way he put it sure because he said there were beautiful women hugging him over there but you know what the difference was the tree of knowledge of good and evil had been taken from his body he was looking at that old tree sitting on the bed next to him but he already entered into a new cross hallelujah to god and thank you jesus he had already entered into a new situation and in this new body will be completely absolutely separated from the tree of knowledge of good and evil it's a cross god crossed himself with mankind so what the weakness of the law could not do because you see you get born again today anybody ever felt like giving up two eye blinks three head nods three hands went up ah let's try again let's try i know we could do better i've got faith you could do better anybody ever felt like giving up so so did god listen to your choice that's right brother thank you lord it goes to prove that my choice only aligned momentarily to his will and when my choice aligned to his will then god was able to fire everything he had at me if my name was on the lamb's book of life if i was a predestinated gene seed in his mind if i was a thought before the world ever began what's the second and all it takes is a second that my will aligned with his he could just launch in you see this is where legalist if you're of a legalist type nature you i'm not saying that you shouldn't be rules and regulations that's a part of service to god too but if you're of a legalist nature you need to get this thing out of your spirit it's only going to harm you walk with god because if you ain't careful you're going to take the power of who you are into your own hands and you have no control over who you are i am fearfully and wonderfully made someone made me i didn't make myself thank you lord it's a cross because once he crossed himself with mankind you see when he goes to the river jordan the holy ghost enters into this body right without measure you'll never find one scripture in the bible anywhere that said jesus was full of the holy ghost until after he walked out of that river then jesus being full of the holy ghost to the wilderness be tempted people get this wrong on their mind they think jesus received the holy ghost sure did but he didn't do it as a center that needed salvation he was a seed paul said not of seeds of many but a seed and we all know that a seed needs water quickening power god was simply quickening the messiah sign the messiah seed the messiah life so he could enter into his ministry to be washed killed buried and to be resurrected don't separate god from him but you also can't make that body 100 spirit god it was pained when they hit him when people lied on him and hurt his feelings brother joe like it does me like it does you when that roman soldier walked up there and smacked him in the face and ripped bits of his beard out and they put that bag over his head and they hit him and said now prophet tell us who prophesied tell us who tell which one of us did i could only imagine what it might have been going through his mind but because of his blood and what kind of tree he was born off of with his hands stretched out in agony father forgive him they just don't know what they're doing i can't do that with this blood this blood makes me hate listen to me this blood makes me have anger this blood makes me envious jealous but the holy spirit inside a man's heart changes what tree he's on one more scripture be going home jesus said a good tree bringeth forth good fruit and an evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit happily that whatever cross whatever tree you're hanging on because see jesus come from the tree of life he come directly to us theophany that's genesis 1 26 let us make man in our own image see that man up there is plural that ain't just one man adam that's every man every theophany every child of god was contained in that pillar of fire including jesus and we know that because when he's standing on earth he said father glorify me with the glory we had before the world ever began when the sons of god shouted for joy and the morning starts saying together so when he come to this earth he remembered he had perfect recall of what it was like but you and i [Music] up here we're so clogged i mean that we can't hardly remember anything but once jesus puts a little spiritual drain on those lines and it burns out some of that old stuff things you've been taught things you've learned yourself things you read on the internet some book or website you got into somebody preached something to you and all of a sudden the man of god comes brings the word of god in such a plain way have you ever been in church and all of a sudden it's like something goes ah i see it you got a line clear that's what happened and all the goodness of god come running right into your soul to let you know where you come from and who you are have you ever seen a preacher get happy and shout spiritual drano he's claiming he's cleaning out all of them clogged plumbing hey listen you may think i'm saying that i mean that sacrilegious but that's a quotation i'm actually quoting to you brother brahm said the reason we don't know who we are he said because we're clogged up he called it one place spiritual amnesia i just don't remember who i am but one of these days brother that little white button that entered into me he's gonna grow under my hands growing up my feet growing in my mouth my eyes growing in my mind and my soul all through me and one of these days i'm going to be standing on this earth and it's going to strike me in such a fashion i'm a king's son can you imagine brother branham that all them years seen all the miracles traveled all the millions of miles only to come to 12 12 65 last message he ever preached 12 12 65 and he said i now realize i am no longer the son of charleston hello branham when are we coming there that moment going to strike us to the son of god i'm a daughter of i could ever get my lines unclogged maybe i'd see a whole lot more see this is why you come to church spiritual plumbing because sometimes you might be connected with the t when you need to be connected with a lie or sometimes you might be running downhill when you should be running uphill only you plumbing folk understand a word i'm talking about in other words everything's all muddied up why you were born on the wrong tree and you were crossed up but remember what saved us wasn't the what it was the who who is he he said the prince of life the lord of glory i i'm going to spare you the reading of it i won't belabor it but up there brother brahms i got a statement where brother bram said that once you realize that you've come through this blood cell of christ he called it he said then you realize you've got a piece of his dna inside of you that's not here no you ain't got god right now here in this flesh no that's that part inside that soul that's what makes you live right that's what makes you want to live right that's what makes you crave to read the bible and go to church and love people even though you've got a right to slap the time out of them something inside of you says you know what i'm going to love you anyways you ain't getting me like that you ever just get so aggravated just like gonna shake somebody what's the matter with you oh god here come the halos again what is it in your heart that makes you say lord i'm a human being too i get upset and angry too i forgive them what makes you do that if you follow the bible nothing in the bible ever declares that you and your flesh could ever say them words it's like raising my hand to find gravity what makes me defy this it's that cross between god and man because when god become a man he became me that i could cross myself with him and become him this is why i said rise of the son she is him no matter how you see the river jordan okay people debate this all the time i don't really care it's not important no matter what the debate of it is at the end of the day jesus had to have the father enter into his heart at some point because as a man a created man without the anointing all he could do was quote and debate now listen close we're going home when he was 12 years old he quoted and debated find me one miracle finally one dead person he ever raised finally one person in scripture during that time where jesus ever went in there and opened a blinded eye all he could do before the anointing came was debate quotes why people in the condition because until that anointing moves under that little seed of god all they've got is a debate of quotes that's why this message is more than a debate stand with me i told you'll be going home give me but here we are i know because i usually preach along to you a little different tonight just slowing down and talking a little bit this is what i felt led to do because i feel like in my heart that that we really need to understand this relationship i don't know about you but i find that the more i live in this whole body right here i find that number one the devil i've come to realize this he's not really my worst and i'm not really trying to fight against the devil so much but it's keeping me in subjection to what is true what is right the greatest struggle of your life is going to be bringing this subject to the word of god again i don't care how you see the river jordan one thing you've got to take away from that is jesus was not able to enter into his full ministry until the anointing came upon that seed and activated you see when he went into the wilderness and come out of there and stepped into his ministry whatever was laying in those prophecies was activated when that dove came out of heaven and said this is my beloved son in whom i well pleased to dwell in it activated lord of god and here you walked on the floor as a baby you crawled mama said oh it's so beautiful look how beautiful when you was a little bitty a toddler you got little sticky hand prints all over everything i said oh it's mama's angel when you've got a teenager you was in trouble got in one trouble after another oh that boy he's driving me crazy that girl i don't know what to do with her and all along there was that little speck of god hiding in there your first cross brought you into lying and being deceitful and everything else did anybody have to teach you how to do it no it was automatically in you this is why if you've really genuinely truly got the holy ghost nobody has to teach you how to live right or be a christian it's automatically in you that's not to say we don't need instruction that's not not to say that we don't need help in figuring things out but there should be an automatic something that comes out of a believer's life you may not know how to identify it you may not know how to describe it you may not know how to put it into words but if you've got god in there you ought to be able to love and not explain why you're even doing it if you've got christ in there you ought to be able to forgive and not even have an explanation for why you can do it it's just automatically overcoming by his cross let's pray together lord jesus thank you for your word tonight lord we're so thankful for what you've said to us and lord i am so grateful for the old rugged cross i'll never stop singing about it but lord help us realize that lord jesus that's not the real cross that saved us had not you come and took our stock and crossed yourself with mankind with humankind lord had not you done that we have still been sin in sin and sinners and death is the fruit thereof oh god thank you tonight lord thank you tonight for allowing us to have something that will reverse this process in our lives hallelujah thank you for the holy ghost and the birth thereof i pray for this congregation tonight lord i pray for this group of people if there's one in here lord that doesn't know you may the power of your spirit go right to them right now grab ahold of their heart i pray and let them crack the door open enough lord that you can jump in there and take over and lord for the record i'm thankful that i don't have to depend upon my everyday choosing because those days when i don't feel like serving and i don't feel like living and get so discouraged you feel like quitting lord every one of us have walked there i want to say to you tonight sir thank you for having made the choice for me that if i was your son i was always going to be your son and i am your responsibility and i want to thank you for taking care of me lord thank you for not relying upon me to make the grade there be any backslid tonight lord jesus move on god if there be christians in here tonight troubled by things of the world things of the flesh thorns in the flesh help them see the reality of how to whip it this is why lord jesus surrender is the greatest weapon that we have in our toolbox glory to god to be able to surrender this is really the only weapon we have help us lord to see it [Music] in jesus christ's name while your heads are bound for just a moment i just feel led to do something will there be one in here that the lord's pricked your heart tonight you just like to say brother ben in my spirit my soul my heart down in me i feel the lord talking to me that i'm not saved and i want to get right with god but you just slip your hand up to the lord i'd like to pray for you the lord sees you god bless you very much anybody else you as well the lord bless you praise
