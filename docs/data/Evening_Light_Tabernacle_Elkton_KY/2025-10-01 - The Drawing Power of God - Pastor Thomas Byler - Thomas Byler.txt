TRANSCRIPT
========================================
But I happen to believe that until we take our last breath, until the rapture takes place, Amen, the real church of God is going to be getting closer and closer and closer to him. Every human being has this certain amount of draw in him. Isn't that right? Cuz brother said God had put those thirst in every soul. Africa. No matter where you go, go out there where they never had no civilization. They'll be worshiping something. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they have a thirst. They have something in their hearts to tell them they come from somewhere. Something made me. Amen. And even if you don't come to God, even Jesus says uh come unto me all ye who are weary in heaven laid laden. Revelations the last chapter says the spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; Everybody's saying come come unto me come to God come come. Drawing pulling. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can be like the critics, the unbeliever, because he says there's always people that want to make fun, come to criticize. But guess what? The Bible says that if you're in the depths of the sea or if you're in death or if you're in hell, when he calls, you'll answer. I mean, come to him one of these days. You'll be drawn to him one day. Let's hope that it is before judgment day &gt;&gt; cuz every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. So I'm thankful this morning. Brother Bandam, he says it this way. One day I was talking to the wife, one of the first meetings that we ever had, and she says, "All those people come." He says, "And I said, the gospel is the greatest drawing card the world has ever had." Amen. If I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto myself again. And he says, "And I certainly am grateful to God for what he's doing in these last days." how that he's drawing men from everywhere to serve him and made his great drawing power. It's the greatest drawing power the world has ever known. Again, he says because Jesus said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto myself." How many knows down through the age, it has been the greatest drawing power for 2,000 years, especially think about in our generation in the 40s, the 30s. Amen. During this revival, this end time revival we had, you'd never hear of a half a million people gathering together, truckloads upon truckloads of CS and stretchers and people shutting the whole city down. Would to God Elton would get shut down, brother. Shut down, brother Tom. Because if everybody Amen. walking the streets praising God, singing only believe, only believe, all things are possible. It's a drawing power. How many believes it's the greatest drawing power there ever was? Why? Because it's the greatest thing that there ever was.
