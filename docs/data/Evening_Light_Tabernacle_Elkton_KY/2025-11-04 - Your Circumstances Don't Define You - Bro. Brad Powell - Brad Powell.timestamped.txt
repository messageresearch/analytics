[0:00] But we're going to get into it here. So
[0:01] we we look at the life of Job here and
[0:05] immediately when we begin to think about
[0:07] Job, immediately what comes into our
[0:09] minds where we think, "Oh no, poor
[0:11] pitiful Job. Poor pitiful Job." And and
[0:14] our mind goes to a place of trials. Our
[0:16] mind goes to a place of hardships and
[0:19] heartache and pain and remorse and
[0:21] agony. But those I want you to realize
[0:23] tonight, brothers and sisters, those are
[0:25] just words for the result of the
[0:27] circumstances in his life.
[0:30] It does not describe the kind the
[0:32] character of the man Job. It does not
[0:35] describe anything about the life of Job.
[0:38] Because brothers and sisters, Satan may
[0:40] say a lot of different things about the
[0:43] and use words to describe what you're
[0:45] going through.
[0:47] He will come to you and he will begin to
[0:49] throw words at you based on the
[0:51] situations and where you're at in your
[0:53] lives. You take a person that loses
[0:56] their job. Satan may come to them and
[0:58] say, "You're a failure."
[1:01] You take a You take a person that that
[1:02] that that's been falsely accused. He may
[1:05] come to you and say, "You're angry."
[1:09] You take a person where things aren't
[1:11] going well in their life, and he may
[1:12] come and he may look at you and say,
[1:13] "You're depressed. You're depressed.
[1:16] You're stressed. You're overwhelmed." Do
[1:18] you see what I'm saying? These are
[1:19] descriptive words of a circumstance for
[1:22] things that we're going through in our
[1:24] lives. There may be times when Satan
[1:26] even looks at you and says, "You are a
[1:28] lost cause.
[1:31] You are hopeless.
[1:35] Don't even try.
[1:38] Quit."
[1:40] These are the kind of words that he
[1:42] throws out at us. But brothers and
[1:43] sisters, when God SPOKE OF JOB, GOD DID
[1:46] NOT USE ANY of those words of
[1:48] negativity.
[1:50] He knew what Job was GOING TO GO
[1:52] THROUGH. HE DID NOT use any words of
[1:54] doubt, but he said, "Listen, there is
[1:57] nobody on earth like him."
[2:01] There is nobody on earth like him. He is
[2:03] perfect and he's upright. He fears me.
[2:06] He is a man that is skeweth evil.
[2:08] Brothers and sisters, the devil may call
[2:09] you a lot of things in this life. HE MAY
[2:13] CALL YOU A LOT OF THINGS, BUT GOD calls
[2:15] you my son. He calls you my daughter. HE
[2:18] CALLS YOU MY CHILD. HE CALLS YOU MY
[2:20] LOVE, my sweetheart. He calls you
[2:22] forgiven.
[2:25] He calls you He calls you saved. And he
[2:27] calls you sanctified. He calls you
[2:29] filled with the Holy Ghost. THAT'S WHAT
[2:31] GOD'S calling you today. Perfect and
[2:34] upright through God.
[2:38] You say, "How do we get perfection?"
[2:40] Through God.
[2:43] Don't ever make a mistake about the
[2:44] circumstances. Don't let them the the
[2:46] the circumstances tell you who you are
[2:49] because the circumstances don't define
[2:51] you. It's the word of God. It's the life
[2:56] we live. It's the songs we sing
[3:01] that defines us.
