You may be seated. God bless you. Uh, I always say that unlike brother Brian, I don't mean to keep you standing and but sometimes we just do. But it's just good to be in the house of the Lord and all of our visitors and Amen. You know, and I I've got a brother Glenn had asked me the other day about turning a prayer request in for a lady. She's works at a restaurant they eat at and her fiance has cancer and his name is Tony. Well, it's one of those times that I forgot, but the Lord doesn't forget. And so, they went in there and ate the other day and they asked how Tony was doing cuz they had been praying for him and different ones had been. I'm sure brother Shauna and them had. And uh she said, she said, "We're just praising the Lord." Said, "His tumor just keeps getting smaller, smaller, and smaller." Amen. That's how great our God is. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise tonight. He's an awesome God. And Amen. And you know, he he paid a debt for us tonight, you know, and I'm glad he paid my debt. And Amen. Let's sing that that song tonight. It come on my heart. And I was praying today and I got to find my song book. You know how I am. Amen. The reason all this is is because at the cross, at the cross, that's where I first saw the light. And that's where everything was paid for for me. Wasn't it you? Aren't you glad for that tonight? Amen. Alas, did [music] my savior bleed and did my sovereign die? Or would he [singing] devote that sacred head for such a worm as I. Oh, at the [singing] cross. At the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens [singing] of my heart were rolled away. [music] Well, it was there [singing] by faith. I received my sight and now I am happy [singing and music] all the day. Was it for crimes [music] that I had done? He groaned upon the tree. Amazing [singing] be [music] the grace unknown and love beyond degree. [music and singing] Oh at the cross at the cross [singing] where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away. [music] It was there by [singing] faith I received [music] my sight and now I am happy all the day. [singing] Well might the sun in darkness hide and shut [singing] his glories in. When [singing and music] Christ the mighty, the maker died for man, the creature [music and singing] sin. Well, at the cross, at the cross [music and singing] where I first saw the light and the burdens of way. [music and singing] Well, it was there by faith. I received [music] [singing] my sin and now I am happy [music] all the day. [singing] But drops of grape [music] can repay the debt of [singing] love. Oh dear Lord, [singing and music] I give myself away. Take all [music and singing] that I can do. Oh, at the [music and singing] cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens [singing] of my heart rolled away. Well, it was there by faith. [singing] I [music] receive my sight and now I am happy [singing] all the day. [music] Amen. Are you thankful for the cross tonight? Amen. Brother Michael and brother John Hersburgger and brother Caleb, would you come take up the offering tonight? We have some prayer requests tonight we want to take to the Lord in prayer. And brother Troy, would you make your way up here, please? Amen. And uh want to continue to remember Sister Parish and Sister Peggy tonight also. And uh McCagan and the and the and Paulie and Palmer. I haven't heard any upgrade on how they're doing, but we just want to pray that God will continue to be with them. And of course, most all of you know that Josh and Aaliyah have a beautiful little girl. and just pray that God will continue to give them strength. And also, I talked to brother Josh today and he said Hi May was feeling a lot better. So, we want to thank the Lord for that and continue to remember her in prayer. And also, it says, "Please pray for Mansky. She has been in a lot of pain." And also our employer uh Justin, he has I believe that's cancer. Is that correct? Okay. All right. They they write better than I read, I guess. So, we want to remember those. Brother Troy, would you take these needs to the Lord in prayer tonight? We just bow our heads. Dear Lord, we come before you tonight, dear Lord, knowing, dear Lord, that you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever. Dear Lord, we sure are glad, dear Lord, that it's written in in your word, dear Lord, that it's not possible if we feel it, but it's possible if thou can believe. And we're just putting our little licks of faith together tonight, dear Lord, believing, dear Lord, for these different needs, [music] dear Lord. You heard every one of them. You know every one of them, dear Lord. Just like David testified, even if we forget, dear Lord, or forget the names that [music] were read, dear Lord, you know all about them. your arm's not short, dear Lord. You're more than able to take care of every situation. And even now, dear Lord, we ask that you just go and you just be with these needs, dear Lord. We ask that you just touch the lives of these people, dear Lord. Ask that you work, dear Lord, your work in them, dear Lord. And we know, dear Lord, your scripture, scripture says, dear Lord, that you work everything for the good that them that love the Lord, dear Lord. And we pray, dear Lord, that you be with these needs, dear Lord. We pray that you move on the scene, [music] dear Lord. For the ones that are sick, dear Lord, are recovering, dear Lord. We ask that you just move even tonight, dear Lord, that they can see the situation getting better and better, dear Lord. The ones that need you, dear Lord, in their life, dear Lord. We ask that you just come in a mighty way, dear Lord, and show yourself to them, dear Lord, that they'd have an experience, dear Lord, that they'd never be able to walk away from, dear Lord, but you'd change your life forever, [music] dear Lord. We love you. We ask that you be with the remaining of the service now. be with with brother Tom, dear Lord, as he comes, dear Lord. Anoint the speaker, dear Lord, to speak and dear Lord, anoint our ears to be able to hear what you'd have to say to us. We ask these things in your precious name, Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, he paid a debt. He did not. Oh, I owed a debt. I couldn't [music] pay. I needed someone to [music] wash my sins away. [music] And now I sing a brand new [music] song. Amazing grace. All day [singing] long. Christ Jesus [music] paid a debt that I [singing] could [music] never pay. Oh, [singing] he paid a debt [music] at Calvary. He cleansed my soul and set me free. I'm glad that Jesus did all my sins raised. Well, I now can sing a brand new [singing] song. Amazing grace [music] all day long. Christ [singing] Jesus [music] paid a debt that I could [singing] never pay. This is the best part. And one day he's [music and singing] coming back for me to live with him [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; eternally. Won't it be glory just [music] to see him on [singing] that day? Oh, [music] I [singing] then will sing a brand new song. [music] Amazing [singing] grace. All day [music] long, Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could [singing] never make. Let's sing it again. Girls, y'all want to come and sing. One day [music] he's come back for me [singing] to live with him [music] eternally. Won't it be glory [music] just [singing] to see him on that day? [music] I then [singing] will sing a brand new [music] song. Amazing grace all [singing] day long. Christ [music] Jesus paid a dead &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; This Best. From [singing] the beginning, you've been [singing and music] unchanging. age to age you stay. You're constant. You [singing] remain [music] every mystery. [music] The questions [singing] I've carried are safe within [singing] your will. &gt;&gt; So [music] I'll trust you. Even still, I [singing] believe you are who you say you are. You'll do [singing] what you say you'll do. You'll come through. You are aable, [singing] I believe. You've already made a way. So I'm [singing] running through [music] parted waves straight [singing] to you. You are always faithful. Jesus, you're for me, holding [singing] me steady. [music] Every word [singing] you speak is a [music] promise that you keep. [singing] This firm foundation [music] cannot [singing] be shenen. [music] My God, you never fail, [singing] never was, you never will. [singing] I believe you are who you say you are. You'll do what you [singing] say you'll do. You'll [music] come through. You are the same. I believe you've already made [music and singing] a way. So I'm running through parted ways straight [singing] to you. You are always faithful. [singing] Believe. [music] Oh, [singing] I believe. Oh, [singing] that on the cross your [singing] blood was spilled and by your stripes I have been healed and every promise you fulfilled. [singing] I believe I believe [music] that you [singing] rose again in victory and [music] that same power [singing] lives in me. I'm born again. I've been made free. I believe I believe [singing] that the gates of hell will not prevail. Your church is [music] still [singing] alive and well. This goel truth I'll [singing] live to tell. I believe. I believe that one [singing] day soon you'll split the skies. You're coming for a spotless [singing] bride. Until my faith has been made sight. [singing] I believe. I believe. I believe. You are [singing] who you say you are. You'll do what you say you'll do. You'll come through. [singing] You are always able. I [singing] believe you've already made a way. So I'm running through parted ways straight to [singing] you. You are always faithful. [singing] I believe. [music] Oh, [singing] tonight on that day I'll run my [singing] race. I'll finally see you face to face. And nothing [singing] then will separate. I believe. I believe I'll join with every [singing] tribe and tongue [music] and bow before the [singing] lamb of God singing holy, holy, holy [singing] one. I believe. I believe. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you believe tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give him another hand. That was awesome, wasn't it? Amen. [applause] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. Let's stand and we ask brother Thomas to come and and uh pray the song service been a blessing to you and sure enjoy that special. Amen. Let's just sing that little chorus as Brother Thomas comes. Fill my cup, Lord. Is that your desire tonight that he'd just fill your cup? Amen. Oh, fill my cup, Lord. I lift [singing] it up, Lord. Come and quit. for this thirsting of my soul. Bread of [singing] heaven. Oh, feed [music] me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make [singing] me once again as brother Tom comes tonight. Oh, fill my cup Lord. I lift it up Lord. [singing] Oh come and quench. Oh, this [singing] thirsting of [music] my soul. Oh, bread of heaven, feed me. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; You too. &gt;&gt; Here's my cup. [music] Fill [singing] it up and make me whole. One more time. Oh, here's my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. [music] Come and quench it thirsting of my [singing] soul. Bread [singing] of heaven, feed [music] me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and [singing] make me whole. [music] Amen. And I could just bask in that moment right there for 10,000 years. Amen. Don't you just love to worship him? Isn't it just nice just to bask in his presence? Amen. God bless you. Good evening, everyone. Amen. Praise the Lord. Good to see you, sister. God bless you. Amen. And you be kind Joyce there. Lord bless you. Amen. I had to open the door so he was singing. Amen. So, praise the Lord. God bless each and every one of you. Amen. And I think that'll be all for the music tonight. Amen. Last service of the year. Amen. Last service of 2025. I was thinking, you know, one of these days it'll be the last service. &gt;&gt; Amen. The last special will be sung. Amen. The last sermon will be preached. Last prayer will be prayed. Amen. All the struggling, all the pain, all the sorrow, all the crying will be wiped away. &gt;&gt; All death will be wiped away. Aren't you looking for that day? &gt;&gt; I love that. Amen. I mean, that's God's promise. That's right. John saw that holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And he heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and shall be, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God." &gt;&gt; Don't expect him to be your God there. and not him be your god here. &gt;&gt; Amen. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. There shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain. For for the former things are passed away. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he that sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And he said unto me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful." He said unto me, "It is done. I am the alpha, the amigga, the beginning, and the end. And I will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of water of life freely. Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. How many believes that you have to be a little hungry and a little thirsty on this side if you're going to drink from that fountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you're not thirsty here, you probably wouldn't be thirsty for that one. &gt;&gt; But if you thirst, God will quench your thirst. God bless you. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, as we come before your throne of grace tonight, once again, this side of eternity, in all of struggling humanity, in the peak of evil, and uh Eden of Satan, in the climax of all evil that we are in the midst of, we pray tonight, Lord, that you would just as we have gathered together this one more time in this one year of 2025, And we certainly stand here questioning and wondering if 26 will bring you back, Lord. And we're believing that it will. We're expecting for you to come. Amen. Perhaps even yet before the first, but Lord, if not, we'll be expecting you in 2026. And because of that, Lord, we come into your house. deem it a grand privilege and a great necessity and of a dire need, Father, to come together, Lord, to examine ourselves, Lord Jesus, to allow the Holy Spirit to speak to our hearts and to bring us closer to you, Lord. And if there's any evil way in us, that you would take it away, Lord, and that you could do your work that you have begun in our hearts. Father, we truly believe Lord Jesus that you're finishing the work. We ask God that you would just bless the meditation of my heart, my thoughts, and Lord, in the direction that I feel, Lord, you've led me to go. That you'll just bless my mouth, the words that come out of my mouth, my meditation of my mind. Lord, may it be used of you to give these people tonight what we have need of. those listening, bless them, Lord, as they listen, Father, Lord Jesus, out there. We ask, God, that you would bless them with your word and with your presence, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. We want to preach on part two of the father's business tonight. So, if you will turn to Matthew. Amen, Matthew. And um once again, thank you for your prayers. I feel like as I study, Amen. Um, Amen. I'm a little overwhelmed. Amen. I, you know, with what the Lord just kind of brings to me. And, and so I've got a lot wrote down. I've got a lot of scriptures. Amen. And I just ask you to pray for me that the Lord will direct me in the way that he wants me to go. Would that be okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we always want to be led by the spirit, not by our own head, by our own mind, or our own ability. Amen. Because it's him that doeth the works. Amen. So, in Matthew 2, I believe it is. No, I'm sorry. I apologize. It's not Matthew. It's Luke 2. Luke 2. And it's funny. I read that scripture in Revelations. I had no intent of reading that, but it'll certainly go along with what we want to minister on this evening. Amen. Luke 2. And it's the story of Joseph's parents going up every year to the feast of the Passover and so forth. And they had went there and then they went back a day's journey. And they thought that he was with them, but he wasn't. So they had to go back for a whole day to find him and they found him. Amen. We'll begin with verse uh 46 of chapter 2 of Luke. And it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. And when they saw him, they were amazed. And his mother said to him, "Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father, and I have sought thee sorrowing." And he said unto them, "How is it that ye sought me? Wish ye not that I must be about my father's business?" And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated. Amen. We took a little thought Sunday on Amen. The father's business. And I want to and I kind of in my own way titled it God the businessman. God the businessman. In other words, Jesus said that his father had a business. Isn't that right? I must be about my father's business. Doing what his father did. And I think it's in Galatians 5. I'm going to go ahead just go there. Didn't intend to do it, but I think I can find it in a pretty quick way and maybe just read a little bit of it. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Galatians. All right. Must be Colossians. If it isn't Colossians, well, Huh? Well, well, well. It's where uh it talks about being brought up under tutors and governors and so forth. Amen. I thought for sure it was Galatians, but I guess not. Oh, there it is. Galatians 4. Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, differth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all, but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. Even so we, when we were children, were under bondage under the elements of the world, when the fullness of time was come, God sent his son forth his son made of a womb, made under the law. Amen. Amen. Verse seven. Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if his son than an heir of God. But now this point that I want to start out with is we as bornagain sons and daughters of God are under the tutorship of the Holy Spirit. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. The tutorship of the Holy Spirit. Because as we know most of the times a child will take on his father's business, take over his father's business. Brother Banham of course preached on that and talking about how that you know how that that tutor how that he it's actually a teacher that brings reports back to the father and how that he says how he gives a report of how his child's doing. Ain't that right? Of how he's doing, how he's progressing. Amen. And you know that's what God is working on us with to see how we're acting. See what our actions are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that if we had the spirit of Dillinger or something that we probably carry guns and so forth. And I thought about how if we had the Holy Spirit or if we had the spirit of let's say Elvis Presley or one of those, you know, we might be singing about I don't know what what I don't know what some of call on songs about hound dogs and everything else, you know, go out there and we'd act like that. If we had a spirit of Michael Jackson, we'd sing like a girl. And I don't know about you, but I I've got a problem when a I can't when a guy singing it sounds like a girl, you know. I just don't know about all that. But anyway, but if we have the spirit of Christ, Amen. guess what? We're going to act like the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "The works that I do will you do also." SO, HOWEVER THE FATHER does is how we are to do &gt;&gt; recapping a little bit. We brought it up and all that Jesus did while he was in his ear earthly ministry and and uh I think it was Luke the third chapter or fourth chapter somewhere in there where he's pick up the Bible or the scriptures and he talk and it said that you know that that he was sent to preach uh to the brokenhearted and and so forth. Isn't that right? to bring bring uh freedom to captives and all that he was to do. And that was what I believe truly was his business in setting the captives free, healing the sick, OPENING THE EYES OF THE BLIND. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S NOW BEEN GIVEN OVER? BECAUSE JESUS COULD JUST DO THAT. He could only do that in a limited sense. He had maybe 12 disciples that would go out and they would heal the sick. They would do this and that and the other, but you know, THEY COULD HAVE PREACHED THE GOSPEL ALL THEY WANTED TO, BUT the baptism of the Holy Ghost was not available. A nature change was not available yet. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER CALVARY, NOT UNTIL ACTS 2:38 when the fire of God came back that they could GO OUT AND PREACH AND THE HOLY GHOST WOULD COME down and he would sanctify the people and IT WOULD FILL THE PEOPLE. AMEN. And then HE WOULD BE A a a a Jesus. so to speak because he separated himself. Amen. In the FORM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. AND I will be with you even in you to the end OF THE WORLD. AND TRULY WHAT GOD WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE, he is achieving through his people or his bride or his church now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. He's achieving now through the church. Amen. Hallelujah. So this evening I want to maybe go just a little bit different direction. Amen. Because we want to look at God. Amen. As a builder or as what you might call a contractor. How many believes that God is a builder? Amen. He's in the building business. Now we we're going to take we're going to take some time on this because we'll never cover a lot of it. that and I'm just feeling trying to feel which way the Holy Spirit wants me to go. But um because there is just so much so much Amen. when we talk about the father's business. Now let me just say uh that God is a contractor. But Abraham says he's a builder. Listen real close. He says God way back yonder. He says now we're going to take the chronological idea of it. God 100 billion years ago when he was going to make a world. Amen. Well, he just started and he got an idea in his mind. Amen. Now he said contractor but I want to also bring in the fact that God is not only a contractor but he's a architect. God is a architect. What does an ARCHITECT DO? HE DRAWS UP PLANS. We had to have a statecertified architect to dry up draw up this plan. say in inspector had to approve it and everything to make sure that everything about the building was sound. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is this architect. I want to say he's he's the contractor. He's the builder. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's everything. &gt;&gt; He's everything. &gt;&gt; And he had something in his mind. Like I said, Sunday when you have an architect when you're building something and I think even with Micah's house when you know we there was just some numbers didn't jive didn't add up. So you have to do whatever you want to do or whatever you can do change it or whatever but this architect he don't never have to change anything. &gt;&gt; Now how many believes this is drawn up perfectly? his plan, his will, his plan, and his will. See, wherein Ephesians said, "Wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to the GOOD PLEASURE WHICH HE hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things that are in Christ." Amen. both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him. How many know is that in the fullness of time he will do that he will gather together everything that is in Christ &gt;&gt; the rapture he'll gather his children home like that magnet remember the story the magnet and the great uh in this great factory where they had all kinds of shavings and all kinds of things on the floor but in the evening they bring that great magnet across and everything THAT WASN'T BOLTED DOWN IT but take it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bam talking about how that's the way the believer is. If you are not bolted down to something, Amen. And if you're MADE OUT OF THE RIGHT MATERIAL, YOU'LL be pulled up. &gt;&gt; In the same way we are, Amen. the dispensation of he'll gathered together in one all things which are in heaven and which are in on earth, even in him. Now notice, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who WORKKETH ALL THINGS after his plan or the council of his will, ACCORDING TO WHAT HE HAS DRAWN UP. HOW MANY KNOWS everything is working just according to plan? Don't think that things are out of cater and it's a turmoil and it's a mess. NO. BEFORE GOD PUT THE FIRST STAR OUT THERE, he knew exactly the condition that this world would be in at this time. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly THE CONDITION THAT YOU would be in. He knew what you would be up TO AND WHAT YOUR PROBLEM would be. Amen. See, in this great architect and this great builder, especially this architect, I love this scripture BECAUSE I READ IN REVELATIONS 21 WHERE HE WAS, and I love this because he said, "I am the alpha and the omega." That's the A and the Z. I am the beginning and I am the end. How many KNOW THAT GOD KNOWS ALL THINGS? &gt;&gt; He knows everything. &gt;&gt; He knew how much how many knats there would be, HOW MANY TIMES IT WOULD BAT ITS EYE, HOW MUCH TALLY IT WOULD MAKE. THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. HE KNEW EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; And tonight, THAT'S GOING TO BE MY FOCUS. MY FOCUS IS ON WHAT GOD IS, &gt;&gt; what his plan is, &gt;&gt; AND HIS HOLDING POWER. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY'S GLAD FOR GOD'S HOLDING POWER? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; Oh, he is so good. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So he said he was the beginning and the end and that we read pretty much uh I like this because in Revelations there he said he said uh I really like this. He is the beginning and he is the end. Now in Hebrews some some one place it says although the works were done from the foundation of the world. Now when we talk about the works being done from the foundation of the world we're talking about when God says anything it's as good as done. &gt;&gt; How many believe that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away. &gt;&gt; So even the Bible talks about the works being done from the foundation of the world in the mind of God they're done. And so that's why you could say way over in Revelation and he said unto me it is done. &gt;&gt; Remember in CALVARY HE SAID IT IS FINISHED. &gt;&gt; We have COME TO THIS PL THIS PART NOW and it's done. &gt;&gt; I imagine there's going to be some enthusiasm when we sit there and we hear HIM SAY IT'S NOW FINISHED. IT'S OVER WITH NOW. &gt;&gt; THE LAST SERMON'S BEEN PREACHED. THE LAST SERVICE YOU HAD. THE LAST TRAVELING IN THE NIGHT YOU'VE DONE, THE LAST SACRIFICE YOU'VE MADE, THE LAST FUNERAL THAT YOU'VE WENT TO, &gt;&gt; the last time you've BEEN SICK, IT'S ALL OVER NOW. LET ME WIPE THE TEARS FROM MY EYES. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE NO MORE DEATH. THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE END. THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT OF FROM THE VERY START. THIS IS WHAT I WANTED. THIS WHAT I HAD IN MY MIND FROM THE VERY START. GLORY. &gt;&gt; How many glad that he's got a plan? &gt;&gt; Let's go deep. Let's go real deep. The prophet of God, he made a statement saying that, you know, you were really never saved on any certain day. is pretty strong. Never saved on any certain day. You was in the mind of God always saved. Come on now. Is it 12 and 8? Come on. I just had it earlier tonight. All right, I'm going to put y'all on the spot. Well, never mind. I found it. I'm still going to put you on the spot. What scripture is this found in? Where's this found about? And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Anybody know where that is? &gt;&gt; Yep. But I tried. I thought I could remember it. I thought it was like 8:13, but at 138 being twisted over after 60, you know. 138. Revelation 138. Amen. And to really How many knows that if you ever was there, your name was not put on at A CERTAIN TIME. IT WAS PUT ON THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; Many times in uh St. John 17, I believe it is, HE SAYS, "FOR THE FATHER LOVED ME FROM THE FOUNDATION of the world." HE KEPT TALKING ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD WAY BACK THEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord. It's strong, but it's true. &gt;&gt; How many is glad to be a part of God's plan? &gt;&gt; To be a God to be a part of God's plan. Amen. Now, let me just read a quote to kind of relay lay a foundation. Bam says he said, "May I stop here just a moment and realize I'm facing clergymen and smart men, but I just like to say this. I believe this and I know it. Jesus never went to the cross and died for some haphazard affair. Perhaps somebody might feel sorry because he died in such a terrible way and they'll come and get saved." No. God doesn't run his business like that. God runs his business by forn knowledge, &gt;&gt; knowing before the world was ever formed. I hope I didn't leave it back there. He makes a statement again. If you've got eternal life, in other words, if you know that you're saved, &gt;&gt; you can't really say this if you don't if you aren't really saved. No, you won't know it. But if you have eternal life, if you got eternal life, Bam says, then you always were. Because there's only one form of eternal life, HE SAYS, AND THAT'S GOD'S OWN LIFE. AND HE ALWAYS WAS. &gt;&gt; How many KNOWS THAT THAT HOLY GHOST in you always was. &gt;&gt; And you being in the mind of God, being in the thoughts of God, you was with God. YOU WERE A PART OF GOD. &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD HAD THOSE THOUGHTS AND HE SPOKE THE WORD and they materialized. No, I'm not here to preach my own message. I'm not here to say something the Bible don't say. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, let's just see what the Bible says about it. See what he says about this. Amen. Now, I read a little bit and I didn't read as much as I'd like to, but I already read where he said, "He workketh all things according to the purpose and counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ." Now in Ephesians 1:3 it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in CHRIST IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; How many believes this word? Now not everybody can believe that. A lot of churches don't believe that. But if you don't, then you deny God's word. You How many believe you? You deny. You say God's a liar. No. Or Paul's a liar. No. It happened before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, God's not like me. I'll get a foundation together and I'll put the all the flooring down or whatever and I'll say, "Honey, let's come up here and let's design this house. Let's see where the bathroom's going to be, all where this is going to be and that's going to be, uh, you know, after we get so many of the walls up, well, I'm not sure how the roof's going to be. Just go ALONG AS FIGURE IT OUT AS YOU GO. SOME PEOPLE THINK GOD IS LIKE THAT. GOD'S NOT LIKE THAT. NO. God has the perfect plan. HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE BEFORE HE EVER STARTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. How many knows THAT WAY BEFORE UH uh the little children Herod was killing all the children, there was a scripture wrote of Rachel. weeping for her CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY WERE not &gt;&gt; hundreds OF YEARS BEFORE HE PROPHESIED THAT HE WOULD DO THAT. &gt;&gt; And when the time came, and I don't know about you, but can you imagine your twoyear-old? How old's charity now? Seven already. Unbelievable. ain't two or three anymore. Time goes so fast. We don't have any two-year-olds. We got a new one. Salem, maybe SA, but she's not a boy, so that don't count. [clears throat] But anyway, THERE THE THE BOYS FROM HOW MANY KNOWS FROM TWO YEARS AND DOWN. CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING YOUR LITTLE BOY RIPPED OUT OF YOUR ARMS AND thrust through with a sword right in front of you? That'd be horrible. But they did it all through the land. Amen. But what DID THE ANGEL TELL JOSEPH AND MARY? FLEE. GO ON UP HERE. GET OUT OF HERE. What was it that uh I love that special y'all saying? You have already made a way. There was a phrase in there, you have already made a way. All right, we're going to go down this trail right here for just a minute in 1 Corinthians 10. 1 Corinthians 10. 1 Corinthians 10 10 and verse 13 says, "There has no temptation taken you, but such is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be uh tempted above that you are able, but will with THE TEMPTATION ALSO MAKE A way of escape that you may be able to bear it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad that when God designed his thing that he ALWAYS MADE A WAY? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT QUESTION COMES UP. NO MATTER WHAT TRIAL OR TEMPTATION OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO CALL IT A TEST, NO MATTER WHAT COMES UP, GOD HAS A AVENUE OF ESCAPE, HE'S GOT AN ANSWER FOR IT. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. It don't matter what it is. See the first Adam, how many knows that he took us all into death? He took us all into death. But what did God do? &gt;&gt; Amen. HE BROUGHT US A SECOND ADAM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Here it is. Brother Bam said, "Now you're going to say, WELL, IF HE'S SUCH GREAT, so great, Brother Bam, HOW DO YOU HOW DID HE EVER PERMIT THE devil to make sin?" Well, he says, "He knew before the devil was ever created that he would be a devil." &gt;&gt; Oh, now glory. He says, "I feel religious now." HE KNEW BEFORE THE DEVIL, AMEN, WAS EVER A DEVIL THAT he would become a devil. No, he didn't. Oh, really? You reckon it was a surprise to God? Man, this guy just jumped up on my congregation and man, I don't know. Let me see what WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? Nothing surprises God. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing surprises God. He knows WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FACE TOMORROW, THE NEXT DAY. HE KNOWS WHAT'S COMING IN 2026. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE DON'T. [screaming] BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WORLD, LET ME TELL YOU WHO WE'VE WORKED FOR. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY BOSS. MY BOSS HAS EVERYTHING IN CONTROL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO WHATEVER COMES UP, HE'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF. HE'S A GOD THAT ALWAYS MAKES A WAY. &gt;&gt; MAKES A WAY OF ESCAPE. &gt;&gt; He knew that that devil WOULD BE A DEVIL. HE KNEW ADAM AND EVE WOULD FALL. HE knew Eve would fall. &gt;&gt; Sure he did. What I'm trying to say tonight is this. that no matter how devil the devil is, NO MATTER HOW DEVILISH THE DEVIL IS, NO HOW MUCH EVIL THE WORLD IS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH SIN that there is. AMEN. THERE'S A GREATER POWER THAN THE DEVIL. THERE'S A GREATER POWER THAN SIN. THERE'S A GREATER POWER THAN HEALING, I MEAN, THAN SICKNESS. [applause] GOD HAS MADE A WAY. [cheering] WHY? BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE THAT DREW IT UP. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE PUT IN ISAIAH THERE. AMEN. and by his stripes we are healed. &gt;&gt; SO MANY TIMES JESUS SAID, "WHATEVER YOU ASK IN MY NAME, I WILL DO IT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN YOU, YOU CAN ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT." HOW MANY BELIEVES WE'RE ON THOSE BASIS? THAT'S THE ARCHITECT OF ALMIGHTY GOD IS TO GIVE US AUTHORITY AGAIN THE WAY THAT ADAM HAD IT BEFORE THE FALL. HOW MANY BELIEVE TONIGHT THAT WE CAN BE AS HAPPY AS ADAM AND EVE WERE BEFORE THE FALL? &gt;&gt; THIS BODY IS THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE WAITING ON FOR A CHANGE. THE INSIDE HAS ALREADY BEEN CHANGED. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ALREADY BROUGHT US BACK TO HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; HAS LOST CHILDREN. HE'S ALREADY BROUGHT US BACK TO HIM. HE'S ALREADY FORGIVEN US IN HIS GREAT DESIGN. HE KNEW WE'D BE IN A SINFUL CONDITION. THAT'S WHY [screaming] IN HIS MIND HE KNEW, AMEN, THAT HE WOULD GO DOWN INTO HIS SON AND THAT HE WOULD GO TO CALVARY, THAT HE WOULD [screaming] DIE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD, &gt;&gt; THAT HE WOULD PAY FOR YOUR SINS. THAT HE WOULD MAKE A BLEACH THAT WOULD ERADICATE YOUR SIN, &gt;&gt; ERADICATE YOUR GUILT, &gt;&gt; NOW WE CAN LIVE IN SUCH A WAY. LET ME TELL YOU, WE CAN LIVE IN SUCH A WAY AND SO CLOSE TO GOD THAT you can die in peace. Have you ever heard that said about Oh, they died peacefully. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know of men that have said, "Hey, who's dying here? Raise them curtains. PLAY ME SOME MUSIC HERE." AMEN. Who's dying here? He's ready TO GO HOME. FOSWORTH. NO, BROTHER BEN. I'M NOT DYING. I'M JUST GOING HOME. WHAT WAS THE GREATEST TIME OF YOUR LIFE? THE SADDEST TIME OF OUR LIFE IS TO WATCH SOMEBODY DIE. HELLO. But he said, "THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT I'VE BEEN LIVING FOR. THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IS TO GO INTO HEAVEN, GO INTO HIS PRESENCE, and died without fear, shaking hands of loved ones. Can you imagine? Can you imagine somebody getting up out of their deathbed off after they've been in a coma for a while and just get up out of the bed, start shaking everybody's hands, shaking people's hands, shaking people's hands, shaking people's hands. Only you don't even see him. Boy, he's really went in a coma. That's what we think. He's He's way out there. But it was real &gt;&gt; of people he led to Christ. &gt;&gt; How many's glad that God has made it in such a way &gt;&gt; that you don't even have to be in fear of death. &gt;&gt; Don't have to be afraid. &gt;&gt; You can die in peace. Paul said, "Oh, death, where's your sting?" I don't know if he did, but oh death, WHERE'S YOUR STING? &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; OH, GRAVE, WHERE'S YOUR VICTORY? WOO! [screaming] BUT I THANK CHRIST WHO GIVES US THE VICTORY. &gt;&gt; I don't imagine he does give us the victory, I guess. &gt;&gt; NO, HE GIVES US THE VICTORY THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD. HOW MANY IS GLAD THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN DEFEAT? You can live in VICTORY BECAUSE IT'S IN THE DESIGN. [cheering and screaming] [applause] THE ARCHITECT drew it UP SO THAT YOU COULD LIVE VICTORIOUS. &gt;&gt; SO YOU COULD HAVE FULLNESS OF JOY SO YOU COULD HAVE COMFORT TO THE UTMOST. &gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT. COMFORT TO THE UTMOST. &gt;&gt; THE UTMOST. COMFORT. COMFORT TO THE UTMOST. Wonderful com. Wonderful comfort. Mhm. That's right. Brother Bram said that's what they used to do the Pentecost that they lick their lips. It's honey in the rock. It's so good. Now I know what he's talking about. Makes you feel like licking your lips a little bit. Mhm. That's good stuff. How many's laugh for good stuff? &gt;&gt; I'm beginning to wonder about y'all. Y'all in this it so much until you begin to lick your lips. God is good. &gt;&gt; We'll do it for other things. YOU'LL GET A GOOD OLDFASHIONED SOMETHING kind of good food and you'll lick your lips. That was good. You might lick your fingers. That that barbecue rib was good. How many knows that? Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good is what the Bible says. OH, TASTE AND SEE THAT THE LORD IS GOOD. &gt;&gt; How many KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT? IT'S ABOUT GOD COMING DOWN AND MAKING A WAY FOR US. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY. &gt;&gt; IT'S [screaming] ALREADY DONE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES IT'S ALREADY DONE? &gt;&gt; GOD SAID IT. THERE'S GOING TO BE A RAPTURE. IF YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE IN IT AND THE PART OF GOD, THEN IT'S ALREADY AS GOOD AS FINISHED. IT'S ALREADY DONE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO GET HEALED, YOU HAVE TO TESTIFY THAT IT'S ALREADY DONE. WOO! [screaming] THE BEGINNING, THE END, IT'S ALREADY DONE. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID [screaming] IT, IT WILL BE. SO, IF YOU ARE A PART OF THAT PLAN, YOU CAN'T MISS IT MORE THAN NOTHING. &gt;&gt; WOW. BROTHER B SAYS YOU CAN'T NO MORE PASS AWAY THAN GOD CAN PASS AWAY IF YOU'RE PART OF HIM. &gt;&gt; NO, YOU CAN'T THAT THAT THOUGHT CAN'T BE DEVIATED FROM. &gt;&gt; I've been a Christian since 20 years old. And I'm here to tell you something. I didn't do the hanging on. &gt;&gt; I didn't do the hanging on. &gt;&gt; You didn't DO THE HANGING ON. HE DID THE HANGING ON. AMEN. WHEN YOU BACKSLIDE, HE DOES THE HANGING ON. HE HANGS ON TO YOU. HE WON'T LET YOU GO. [screaming] HE WON'T LET YOU GO. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; Crazy free training. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; Got to be myself, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm glad we can be happy with our religion. &gt;&gt; How many glad for a heartfelt religion? &gt;&gt; You feel it down in your soul. It's not just in my head. It's down here. &gt;&gt; That's what I WANT TO LIVE FOR. THAT'S WHAT I LIVE BY. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO PREACH BY. WHAT'S DOWN IN HERE? &gt;&gt; This isn't THE GREAT ONE. THAT'S THE GREAT ONE. THE ONE THAT'S IN ME. GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME THAN IN ME THAT IS in the world. &gt;&gt; It don't hurt to give HIM A LITTLE CLAP AND SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD, FOR 2025. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US THROUGH 2025. THANK YOU FOR HOLDING US TOGETHER AS A CHURCH IN 2025. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME CLOSER TO YOU IN 2025. AND IN 2026, YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET. [applause] WOO! [cheering] We're getting CLOSER TO THAT PLACE. WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO HOME. AND THE CLOSER WE GET TO HOME, THE MORE WE'RE GOING TO RUN, &gt;&gt; the louder we're going to scream, &gt;&gt; the more we're going to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Cuz when we get over there, it's going to sound like thunder. &gt;&gt; That great voice OF A MULTITUDE SOUNDED LIKE THUNDER, SAYING, "HONOR AND GLORY AND POWER AND STRENGTH BE TO HIM THAT SITS ON THE THRONE HAS REDEEMED US BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; that allowed us to get lost so he can find us. All that the father has given me will come to me and I will lose none of them. I give them them eternal life and they shall never perish. &gt;&gt; Not about those that just get a touch of the anointing just to deeper that or the other. But if God saves you, you're a saved person. &gt;&gt; How many slad for that? &gt;&gt; Woo. [screaming] If he's kept me this long, HE'LL KEEPING ME. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE I'M A PART OF THE PLAN. HOW MANY GLAD TO BE A PART OF THE PLAN? HALLELUJAH. THIS IS HIS WILL &gt;&gt; AND YOUR NAME IS IN THE WILL. [applause] Wouldn't you be shocked, Sister Mary Jane, Jessica, y'all back? Wouldn't you be shocked some guy in a black suit come back in here, come with his briefcase, set it on that last pew, open that briefcase, come over and hand y'all a letter. So, here you go. You're here is a a statement that you are part of an inheritance. You have received an inheritance. We might say, Donald Trump, you were in his will. You were in his will. And you hold that envelope. WE ARE. WE'RE PART of him, you know. Let me rip that thing open. Let me tap that thing down so I don't rip the paper. And rip the end open. Open. Well, how much? Open it up. Amen. You have inherited $2 billion. Brother Thomas and have to close church. All right, folks. We're just going to do what the Bible says and rejoice. told to rejoice the rest of the night. All right. Cuz there ain't going to be nothing else going on. Amen. But how many KNOWS WE'VE GOT OUR NAME IN HIS WILL AND WE WILL INHERIT THE EARTH. AND WE'RE SO QUIET [applause] when he said, "YOUR MEEK SHALL INHERIT THE [screaming] EARTH. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; ONE PLACE HE SAYS SHALL INHERIT ALL THINGS. PAUL SAID ALL THINGS ARE YOU YOURS. WHETHER THINGS PRE PRESENT, LIFE, DEATH, AMEN, EVEN DEATH, EVERYTHING IT'S YOURS. &gt;&gt; PRINCIPALITIES, POWERS, IT'S ALL YOURS. HOW MANY KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE A PART OF GOD, GOD OWNS IT ALL. &gt;&gt; GOD OWNS THE CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HILLS. YOU OWN THE CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HILLS. YOU'RE A JOY. AMEN. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; HE OWNS HEALING. YOU OWN HEALING. SAY, "HEALING IS MINE. SALVATION IS MINE. HAPPINESS IS MINE. JOY IS MINE. HEALTH IS [screaming] MINE." The architect said, "So, the builder is making it happen." Oh my. Told myself I'd quit at 20 after and sing a couple songs. Let you out early. So, ready? Time's quick. &gt;&gt; Time goes fast when you're having fun, didn't it? [panting] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more? &gt;&gt; Troy and Robin didn't come all that way just to be cut short, right? We're going to make sure you get that apple pie and a little bit of dessert now, right? Appreciate those who travel far. Amen. And near. Praise the Lord. But let me just say this, maybe take this in closing perhaps on a more negative thought. Don't like the negative. I don't like to close on a negative, but I'm going to do this. He says, brother Bam, illustrated. He says, you know, and talks about if a if a contractor or a bu, let's say somebody wants a house built, he hands the plan. He hands the plan because uh remember Paul talked about, you know, that Paul built something, Jesus being the cornerstone and the foundation. Isn't that right? Uh I'm not going to go to it, I don't think, but in Ephesians, it talks about all the whole uh building fitly framed together being built upon the apostles and prophets and so forth. Ain't that right? How God is building this building? And he also another scripture talks about now if anybody built wood or stubble or whatever, he says, "And if it DOESN'T HOLD UP, IT'LL BE BURNT." Ain't that right? SO WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING THIS BUILDING AND YOU GIVE IT TO A CONTRACTOR TO BUILD, AMEN. THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONTRACTOR HAS TO BUILD IT THE WAY THAT the design and THE ARCHITECT HAS DRAWN IT UP. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO? WE GOT TO BUILD IT THE WAY THAT THE ARCHITECT IS DRAWING IT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "SO HE GOES OFF TO FLORIDA AND HE SAYS, "BUILD MY HOUSE AND WHEN I COME BACK IN A FEW MONTHS, I WANT IT ALL DONE." HE COMES BACK AND IT'S DONE. AND THEN HE FINDS OUT THAT GUESS WHAT? THAT BAY WINDOW ISN'T IN THE KITCHEN LIKE HE WANTED. NO, THEY FOR SOME REASON THOUGHT IT WOULD FIT better and do better in the bedroom, you know, AND THEY MADE THE PORCH JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. And what is one of them wind things that you put on top of a roof called a wind something? Wind? &gt;&gt; Well, you know your little box on top and it has north, west, east, south. Thank you. That's what I was looking. A weather vein. THAT'S RIGHT. HE COMES UP AND HE LOOKS ON HIS HOUSE AND HE'S BEING A WEATHER vein and HE SAYS, "I DON'T SEE THAT ON THE PRINT. WHY? WE THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK GOOD." WELL, WE JUST THOUGHT THE BAY WINDOW WOULD BE BETTER OVER HERE. HOW MANY KNOW SOME PEOPLE THINK, AMEN. ACTS 2:38, HE SAYS, "GO YE." AMEN. And wait A MINUTE. PETER SAID TO THEM, "REPENT EVERY ONE OF YOU, AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS, AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST, PROMISES TO YOU, TO YOUR CHILDREN, TO THEM THAT ARE FAR OFF." THAT'S THE BLUEPRINT. JESUS SAID, "GO INTO ALL THE WORLD, PREACH THE GOSPEL, TEACH ALL NATIONS, BAPTIZING THEM IN THE NAME OF, NOT THE TITLE OF FATHER, NOT THE TITLE OF SON, NOT THE TITLE OF THE HOLY GHOST, BUT I WANT YOU TO USE THE NAMES OF THE TITLE." SOMEBODY SAYS, "YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S JUST BETTER that we do what Jesus said instead of Peter said, and we'll just use the titles." Nobody ever was baptized in the Bible ever one time under the titles of fathers on the Holy Ghost. Not one person. Everybody was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Do you think they had it right? But no, you can tell people that and they don't care what you say. THEY DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU SAY, "NOBODY WAS EVER DONE THAT WAY." THEY THEY STILL WANT TO BUILD IT THEIR WAY. &gt;&gt; NO, WE'RE STILL GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY. GO AHEAD, &gt;&gt; GOD. But we're HERE TO TELL YOU WHEN THE MASTER COMES, HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE PRINT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, LET'S LET'S GET PEOPLE. I THINK IT'D BE NICE, MUCH EASIER." THIS IS PART OF THE REASON THEY SPRINKLE PEOPLE, PEOPLE THAT WERE UH MAYBE in wheelchairs or in inlet AND SO FORTH. AND AND MAY IT BE EASIER. LET'S JUST TAKE A CUP OF WATER AND SPRINKLE THEM. NOW, let me tell you something. There's a big different interpretation of sprinkling and baptizing. &gt;&gt; Baptizing means getting to the water and immersing. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And they COME UP WITH JUST SPRINKLING AND USING THE WRONG TITLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE OR PUT JUST SHAKING THERE. LET THAT LET'S JUST GET A BOOK TOGETHER AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS CHURCH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN OUR CHURCH BOOK. And if you aren't A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH BOOK, YOU'RE NOT SAVED. WELL, the Amish may not have a book, but they many churches think, well, if you're not a part of them, they're not saved. Hello. What do we believe here? [snorts] You're not saved because you go to this church. &gt;&gt; No more saved than a than a than a a pig is a sheep. &gt;&gt; No. Not one bit does where you go to church have whether you're saved or not. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, we will give you the right recipe. We will tell you according to the print that you've GOT TO BE BORN [screaming] AGAIN. YOU'VE GOT TO BE BORN BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. NOW, HE THAT HATH NOT THE SPIRIT OF GOD, PAUL SAID, IS NONE OF HIS. AND BY ONE SPIRIT ARE WE ALL BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY AND MEMBERS IN PARTICULAR. I MEAN, THAT'S HOW WE BECOME MEMBERS. BY GETTING SAVED, BY GETTING THE HOLY GHOST ON US, THEN YOU BECOME A PART OF THE BODY UNIVERSAL. &gt;&gt; Don't deviate on the plan. Boy, I'm here to tell you, look around. Some people can have a tractor, but you got to put steel wheels on it. And I'm here to tell you, you're going to go through great expense and making them little ribs all around on every wheel and try to make them worthwhile something. Just throw a tire on it and put the hammer down and enjoy IT LIKE THEM OLD LADIES do flying down the road, will you? THAT'S RIGHT. WHY? ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE, ALL THESE DIFFERENT IDEAS PEOPLE HAVE, ALL THESE DIFFERENT THE CHURCHES HAVE. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A DEVIATION. JESUS SAID, "YOU MAKE BY THE WORD OF GOD OF NONE EFFECT BECAUSE OF THE TRADITIONS THAT YOU HAVE PUT IN THERE. BY YOUR OWN TRADITIONS, YOU MAKE THE WORD OF GOD OF NONE EFFECT." &gt;&gt; You got TO STAY WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Got to be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's glad for the architect that is promised? He that hath begun a good work in you &gt;&gt; will perform it. &gt;&gt; I want to go on but I won't go too far. according he has chosen us and him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according TO THE GOOD PLEASURE of his own will he does what he wants when he wants with who he wants. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let me just cap this off or so to speak drive the nail in. Romans 8 says, "For whom he did forno." Remember, God runs his business by fornowledge. He solves the problem before he gets there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean knows he makes the way. You don't think he knew that Israel would come down to the Red Sea? Sure. And he would have the chariots of Israel coming right at him and listened to just what they hear them coming. He wanted them to hear it coming. He wanted him. He wanted it to roar. man. Here, listen. That scared the liver out of those Israelites. Some of them, not all of them. But he wanted to test them. He wanted to try them. Amen. It doesn't matter how dead end you are, God will open up the sea and he'll make a way. How many's glad to serve a God like that? When you come to a dead end, you can't GO NO MORE. GOD WILL MAKE A WAY. BUT HE JUST wants you to give it to him. Say, "God, I'm giving IT TO YOU, LORD. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ANYMORE. I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO. SO, I'M TRUSTING YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; Take me through." &gt;&gt; God takes every Christian, every child and son and daughter, God of his, he takes them all to that place to see whether you'll lean to your own understanding or whether you're going to lean on him &gt;&gt; and trust in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, we're going to stop right there. We'll pick it up Sunday morning, Lord willing. How many loves him? &gt;&gt; Amen. How about How many thankful for the year that we've come through? &gt;&gt; The Lord's been good to us this year. &gt;&gt; He's been very good to us. Amen. And he deserves our deepest devotion, our deepest sincerity. How many would How many would like to get closer to God? &gt;&gt; You want me to tell you how to do it? One way. One way. This is your first step. Be more sincere. You got to be more sincere about it. Don't wait till you're in a hospital or in some dire. No, God. Now, you know, I was praying about tonight's service. I said, God, I'm not just going to have another church service. I'm not just going for a Wednesday night. Lord, I want this to be you, Lord. I want you to COME AND SPEAK. LORD, COME AND DO SOMETHING. LORD, I'M DESPERATE. I'M SINCERE. LORD, how many? That's the way we need to be more. God, I need a closer walk with you. Help me to be more sincere &gt;&gt; because you'll be more sincere about your prayer, more more sincere about your Bible reading your Bible. But the number one thing is you got to be more sincere. Amen. We'll bring probably one more New Year's message again. Amen. Sunday morning, stand with me, musicians, if you'll come. Amen. Brother Nick, was you Nick, was you wanting to be prayed for tonight? You are. Come on up. Come on up. And if our deacons would come up, some of our elders, brother Brad, we're going to get around, talk to you about what you have need of, and we'll we'll ask the Lord. You believe God's going to answer your prayer, our prayer, and grant you what you have need of, [snorts] we're going to believe with you. So, what is it that I haven't even heard? My hip is pretty much the hip. Well, God is able to do it. Amen. His back trouble and also his hips [music] giving him trouble. Now, we're going to pray. We're going to lay our hands on him. But how many Amen. out there will also pray. Pray with us and believe that God is going to touch his back and he's going to touch his hip and he's going to be able to use it much better tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Little by little or immediate, however God wants to do it. But he said, "They will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Whatever you would agree on, two or three of you, I will do it." Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we come before you, Lord. And Father, we know that nothing's too great for you. Nothing's too small for you, Lord. And Lord, we have Nick here, Lord Jesus, that has a need, Father, of [snorts] being healed, Lord. Father, we've seen you do it time and time again. Do miracles, Lord. And we know though that you can't if we'll just believe. And we believe with Nick, Father, tonight we ask God that you'll just touch his hip, that you'll touch his back, Lord, and he'll be able to use it in a much greater way. And we rebuke the enemy that wants to give him pain and that makes wants to make him suffer, Lord. [snorts] Lord, I know God that you want us to be in health and that we want you want us to prosper. We ask God as in the name of Jesus Christ as we bind together, Lord, and we ask in Jesus' name because you said, "Ask anything in my name and I will do it." Lord, may he go from here and it doesn't matter what it feels like. Lord, let him denounce it. Let him raise his hands and say, "God, I believe, Lord, that you have healed me." We ask in Jesus name. Amen and amen. Go and believe. But God, we're [snorts] looking for a testimony. Amen. God bless you. Only believe all things are possible. Only worship him now. Only believe. Yes. Only Billy that all things are possible. Only believe &gt;&gt; only is here. [music] Jesus is and all [singing] things [music] are possible. Jesus is he. Oh Jesus is [singing] he. Jesus is he and all. Lord, we come before [singing] you, Lord. &gt;&gt; As sister Jana has mentioned already, Father, by her sister and her husband, [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, the devil that wants to tear him apart, we rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ. [singing] And we ask, God, that you would get between them, Father. And Lord, that you'll tug, Father, on the one and that you'll tug on the other. And Lord, that you'll bring them together once again, Lord. Father, that Lord, the devil wouldn't be able to bring them apart anymore, Lord Jesus. We ask, God, where they are, where they are, Father, bring conviction. Lord, rekindle their love, Father. Whatever it is that separate them, separate them, separated them, we ask, God, that there'd be forgiveness there, Lord Jesus. There be mercy there. There would be repentance on each one of their parts, Lord Jesus. Bring a heart of repentance. Bring a heart of sorrow, a sadness for where they're wrong and what they've done wrong. May they confess their wrong, Lord Jesus, and come back together. We look for it now in Jesus [singing] name. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Oh, believe all things [singing] are possible. Oh, &gt;&gt; Father. And I know, Lord Jesus, that you can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity. Lord, just a choice, God, tonight. Lord, her arm has been keeping her. It's been hurt. And Lord, our heart goes out, Lord. We cry out to you tonight, Lord, and believe, God, that [music] you're the intercessor, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Father, you are the high priest of our profession, God. And we believe, Lord Jesus, [music] that by your stripes, she is healed. Jesus is the Lord. God bless you. Oh my Jesus is [singing] here and all things are possible. Jesus [music] is here. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus [music and singing] is here. Oh Jesus [music] is here. All things are possible. [singing and music] Jesus is here. Amen. You believe he's here. Amen. How many's been healed this year? &gt;&gt; Amen. What God has done, he's in our midst, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. We love him with all of our heart. And Amen. And just want to thank him so much for his goodness. He's been good to us, has hadn't he? And Amen. We we sing a song here. And uh, Brother Joe, he likes us to sing it every once in a while. But it goes like this. He's an ontime God. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. He may not come when you want him, but guess what? He'll be right on time. Amen. Let's sing it with all of our heart tonight.

And before I forget, uh, Brother John asked me, or not, Brother John, Brother Austin, they're having the gym in Trenton tomorrow night at from 6 till 10 p.m. And I guess just text him or call him, Brother Austin, since he's not here tonight. So, let him know if you plan on being there. And uh if not, we'll see you next year. How's that? God bless you as you go. Let's sing it again. Well, he's an on time. You're dismissed. Yes, he is.
