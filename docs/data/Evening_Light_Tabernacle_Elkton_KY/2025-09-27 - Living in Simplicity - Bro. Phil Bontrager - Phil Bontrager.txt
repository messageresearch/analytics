========================================

So we're going to read out of Mark 10 and verse 13. We must become simple ourselves. We have to also become simple. Verse 13, 10:13. And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. His disciples rebuked those that brought them. And when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased. He said, "Don't don't stop those young people, those kids from coming to me." and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for such is the kingdom of God.

You know, another three-year-old comes up and says, and he said, you know, my my daddy said that the the the moon is made of green cheese. Well, my daddy said it's made of yellow cheese. Well, why do you believe that? Daddy said so. It's that simple. Why do you believe the crazy things that people could do? How can you believe the things you believe? Daddy said so. &gt;&gt; Let it be that simple. God said, "So, it's enough.
