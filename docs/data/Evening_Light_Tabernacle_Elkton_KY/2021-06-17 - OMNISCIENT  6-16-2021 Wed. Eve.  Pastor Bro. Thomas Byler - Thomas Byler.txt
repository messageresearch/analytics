if we could tonight and amen just appreciate each and everyone that's out tonight and just looking forward what god has for us by the way of his word and we don't have any uh written requests tonight which we're always thankful for that and we finally got the results back yesterday and i guess it was yesterday my day's all run together it was tuesday or wednesday i talked to janet's doctor and all the blood work and everything and her kidneys her liver and her everything was good and he said everything's just good and and they'd done uh some kind of test on her heart and everything was good with that and so we just got a lot to be thankful for and appreciate your uh prayers very much and we still got a long ways to go but we're thankful for god's uh healing power tonight and what he's done for her so she's not here tonight and some of that medicine she takes and when it hits her she's she she's kind of she sleeps a lot sometimes and but just continue to remember her in your prayers and i don't know how many of you had seen on facebook we had a prayer request here while back and forth terry tidwell and sister vicky had to ask everyone to pray sister vicky was having some complications and it reminded me of brother branham saying the cat back at the door scratching wanting in and they had posted today that all her tests had come back everything was good and the cancer she had some symptoms of it and and she said everything was good and they just wanted to thank everyone and i wanted to pass that along to the church and i thought you know just whenever it might look dim god is always there and i always think of that song that brother austin likes he's an on-time god yes he is it doesn't always happen when we want it to but when it's his time there's nothing can stand in the way so we appreciate that and just continue to remember them in prayer he's think of a brother in arkansas that had cancer in his blood and and he told me he said brother david every time that i testify of god's goodness and mercy and what his healing power has done for me he said the next day i can almost count on the symptoms trying to come back and i thought you know we have to bear a burden sometimes we have to carry a cross but we're so thankful that we serve a god it is so awesome tonight it's just it's just awesome how our god is and i'm just so thankful tonight to serve him and and his mercy and sure don't deserve it brother glenn but i'm thankful for his goodness and mercy tonight so if you have need on your heart you might let it be known but uplifted hand tonight and

and on and on amen how many believes that tonight god bless you thank you musicians amen good evening everybody it's good to be back in the house of the lord amen for midweek service see what the lord will have for us amen i trust you're having a wonderful week amen god bless you amen let's just bow our heads kind heavenly father we come before you lord once again thank the lord jesus to be able to assemble ourselves together in your name knowing father that you're here in our midst lord jesus and you will never leave us nor forsake us even to the end of the world and father we look forward to seeing you lord jesus and as we come father to honor you and to lord present ourselves before your father and just desire god that you'll speak to us along the way minister to our hearts tonight father and just help us lord jesus as this seems to be the subject father that you've laid upon my heart to speak on so i ask god that you would help let it go on to good ground father and bring forth a hundredfold we ask these blessings in jesus name amen and amen amen i'm going to talk to you about an old subject amen the oldest subject there is i guess we've heard it many times in this message amen but i want to just speak to you again amen so is that all right amen god bless you amen so amen um amen may god has added blessings to the reading amen so let's turn our bibles if you will to the book of job we'll start with the book of job amen and we're going to speak on omniscience this evening omniscience amen god is all knowing isn't that right and that's what we're going to talk about for a while amen to be honest with you i've been speaking to somebody in the church here about this subject for a little bit and it just got me really stirred up and i began to have a few things that just i felt like were fresh to me amen so i trust it'll be a blessing to you amen so over in the book of job this was the last scripture i had to just look up just before coming out amen because i really wanted to find that and with the help of the lord and a good computer i got to be able to pick it up real quick amen by just punching in the right words amen so i tell you what you know it used to be we'd come up here with four or five different books six books maybe for our quotes and you'd have to study that whole book by the dale potter i think he was a good one for that he he'd read the books you know and he didn't know how to operate a computer but ever since you can pull up you know on your computer both the bible and the message you can find something pretty quick if you want amen so all right job 38 job 38 how many knows that job perhaps he suffered very much in that right even though he was the most perfect man in the land yet god had uh you know he had he challenged basically he challenged the devil if i'm not right if i'm not wrong uh satan came into the congregation you know and it was god that said to satan said you know have you considered my servant job amen and so he says yeah but you know you keep a hedge around him you protect him and everything's always going good and we know how humans are as long as everything's going good well they'll praise god and bless god hallelujah right but he says you know but take your hand upon his things and so forth once and he'll curse you he'll curse you to your face that was the uh that was a proclamation that satan had it's still cursed yet and of course after the first round we realized that after all of his children died and all the things that he had was lost that he worshipped god saying the lord gave the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord he worshiped god that way amen and again god challenged us and said so have you considered mr job he said yeah but i've what is it skin for skin or something like that but if you touch his body then he'll curse you and he didn't touch his body just don't take his life and job became perhaps the most miserable person amen i mean boils and things that were just made him cursed and dated he was born and made of stars not shine and all of these things you know you know it's just terrible and so forth but in the end even after his wife said boy honey you are so miserable you know why don't you just curse god and die and he said thou speakest like a foolish woman amen like one you're you're my sweetheart and you're not foolish but you're just talking one like one right now right and so you know in all of that he wouldn't curse god you know and so the day came that god revealed himself to him amen in chapter 38 and verse one through seven then the lord answered job out of a whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge give up the lion loins now like a man and i will demand of thee and answer thou me amen that's something amen uh you know it's kind of like us as a dad saying hey come on boy be a man you know that's what god was telling job come on now gird it up gird up your loins like a man and i will demand of thee an answer thou me where was thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou has understanding who had laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon the foundations thereof are fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when this morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy amen may god had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated i want to go to i've got a lot of scriptures here this evening and i want to just start but as we begin to think about god's omniscience his all-knowingness amen now you know atheists and different people that really don't want to believe in god and so forth it's it's it's true that just to the carnal mind to believe that there is actually a creature or should i say a god like god is in the universe that actually created all of this it does take amen it takes faith amen let me know that otherwise he he made it plain enough to know to be able to look around and know that there is a god right but just in that fact itself and we know it without question is that there has to be a god and that he is omniscient he's all-knowing uh that he knows everything and so forth it's uh it is well not just not that part so much as it is just knowing that he made everything how many knows that the bible says that without him was not anything made that was made everything that was was made by him in the scripture i'm going to just go to as i think about it i believe it's found over in revelations 4 and verse 11 it says thou art worthy all the elders fall down say thou art worthy or law or lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created he did it for his own good pleasure amen amen and also over in revelations the first chapter in verse eight you know he says you know he says i am the alpha and the omega i am the beginning and the ending all right so we know that he is the start and he is the finisher right he started this and he is ending this amen and so the beginning and the ending look at the beginning what is the beginning the bible says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth isn't that right so we see that in the beginning he is the very beginning over in saint john the first chapter i believe it was he said that um in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god isn't that right amen verse chapter one he says the same was within the beginning with god and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and then down in verse 12 verse 13 he says i'm sorry 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth another place in revelation chapter 1 verse 11 says i am the alpha and omega amen that's the second time he says it now within three or four verses alpha of course being the a of the alphabet and the being the z of the alphabet i mean he is the first and he is the last amen i like that because over revelation we begin to we as we know that the biblical revelations has been opened to us and we know now that he is not just the beginning amen not only is he the beginning but he is also the end amen so we look at god and we look at his foreknowledge we look at his knowledge period his omniscience knowing that there is not anything that he doesn't know how many believes that nothing that he doesn't know and whatever he did he did where where did he do it before he actually anything ever happened was before the first start us was made for his first hour before the first thing ever was created amen he had thoughts isn't that right he had his thinking amen amen and so i began to think about that how that you know his thinking is what the is the bible you know the bible was manifested through prophets and all scripture is given by inspiration of god amen so god wrote the bible so we know that this here is exactly what god was thinking before he made the first stardust before he ever created the first thought amen and isn't it something that's what's what i really like about it is that job god asks job in his distress amen he asks him he said now where was you right you know before i laid the foundation of the world where was you declared to me where he was now i don't know if job knew exactly what god was trying to tell him do you he may not have understood it but you and i are understanding it now and that right because of the opening of the seals because of the opening of the book of revelations and so forth we see that god amen wasn't even god at one time and maybe because it's god means an object of worship amen so way back according to the scriptures we find that before anything happened it happened first in the mind of god praise the lord amen and just to make a long story short let me just read you something would that be all right now remember the statue that you are in this morning brother bam says if you wasn't in his thinking then then you're not now there's some part of you that was it that's eternal and that eternal only belong to god and in god was his thinking of you sitting right where you are now oh praise be to god you know when i got to thinking about how that if you are and that's what we desire in our lives all right is to be in his perfect will now this is permissive well because because i you know his permissive will that's an even a completely another subject altogether because god has this is what i want you to do huh but how many know that even if you get out of his perfect will and you get into his permissive well god knew that you would do that there isn't nothing that god didn't know before it ever started i mean that's what that man i'm telling you what that that's this is not everybody can believe this not everybody wants to believe this amen because we'll show you scriptures where even the works were finished before the world began amen so let's look at first of all for one thing we realize that it all works according to the work uh to his will who worketh all things after the council of his will i mean believes that he does that let's go and i like that because he works all things after his will and and we get into this and this is real this is real touchy because it's teaching teaching is equally dividing the word of truth amen it's trying to make a puzzle fit and if you aren't careful and then you'll have a cow up on top of a tree eating grass it just don't work that way it all has to fit and there's a lot of scriptures a lot of things that look like it meant that he could contradict like the bible could contradict itself now right but we know that can't be because god is too infinite to do that there's not a contradiction if there's it looks like a contradiction it's not a contradiction it is something in our mind that isn't coming into the place that that'll be and with this we go into for the nation we go into predestination and then we go into free will and free of moral agency amen and a lot of times whenever i preach on predestination and foreign knowledge and things like that you know people kind of get to tend to be quiet amen because for one thing most of the time when we talk about those subjects we think that it's something that god all right that god uh you know dictates or so forth or makes do but all all predestination is let me tell you what predestination is according to the prophet predestination the word heart is hard amongst people because now notice he says predestination always looks back to for knowledge that right so we know and foreknowledge looks to destiny and god being infinite in the beginning knew the end from the beginning and therefore he knew the people who would what people would do now he didn't how many knows he didn't come on calvary god didn't come on calvary down in his son amen just have people pity him oh isn't it sad what he did he didn't run his business that way he came for those and he died for those that he knew what they would do this is what excites me this is what really got me on this is the foreknowledge of god knew what you would do what your choice would be see it ties it in perfectly ties it in perfectly it doesn't make it uh separated or confusing amen so if you'll notice that's right amen all right let's go to a scripture and talking about how that first of all for knowledge now for knowledge that's just what it says but it's not really you don't really have to get a dictionary to get that one up you know the little kids might not know what it is but that's knowledge that you had beforehand for knowledge you know earlier knowledge previous knowledge knowledge beforehand all right four knowledge not all that hard something that he knew way back then amen and then he would use what he knew right to cause people and to cause destiny to come into existence right now just imagine if you was in that kind of a position that you knew everything and not only now this is the part that people don't get is that god knows everything and he also has the power to move things around the way that he wants it to work all right praise be to god according to how he wants things to work amen because i believe that uh the scripture talks about haru he got it god works all things after the counsel of his will amen which i think we'll get into all right so let's go next here amen we'll go over to the book of ephesians that's all we go book of ephesians ephesians 1. now notice in chapter 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according after he has chosen us in him before the foundation of [Laughter] [Applause] that is so self-explanatory does everybody understand that isn't that real simple it's real simple it's not hard to understand at all that god chose us in him isn't that something how that god can choose us well why would he choose you now why did he choose you because he knew what you would do his foreknowledge it's all about his foreknowledge he knows exactly what you would do amen because i don't believe that god puts something in you to send you to hell huh no we're based on free moral agency isn't that right we all make a choice god never wrote the first name down until he knew what you'd do that's how he could write your name down before the foundation of the world he could write your name down and in that how many knows that there's also a group of people who have their names taken off according to yeah one thing's for sure is you can't just dump something you don't want well i don't want i don't believe in the names not taken on all your names there forever decided the other well there's names that are going to be taken off the book and you know who those is what kind of category you want to see what kind of category those people is and it would take a whole service but over in the old testament if you know this that moses one time he says you know the people have sinned and they were there they fell down before golden calves and everything else amen and moses said i pray thee blot out my name he said lot my name out of the book your book on behalf of them and god says i'll tell you what whose names i'm going to blot out is those who sinned against me he said those and i think dan and benjamin or ephraim one it might have been ephraim and dan and then those two got their tribes they got blotted out because they worshiped idols one of them was for idol worship that they got the names blotted out all right so one of them is for idolatry and here's another reason that your name removed amen and i know that judas was one of those who had their names on the book because he was chosen amen and he was a part of the ministry and everything but he had his name removed because he didn't go on all the way i notice in verse 19 chapter 9 verse 19 of the last chapter of revelation he says if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life in other words if i thomas byler add my own idea in this if i add to this word or if i take away from this word that is grounds for having my name removed so how many knows it's kind of important to try to get it right amen you got to get it right you hear people say well now the bible says this but it don't mean that because you better be careful you'll have your name taken out don't say it doesn't mean what it says because it says what it means it means what it says that right amen and the preacher especially is on thin ground he has to be careful that he uh that he says exactly what the word says it has to all dovetail amen it all has to come together praise be to god all right so out of the now notice take his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written therein so he'll have his part taken out if he takes amen and adds in his word or doesn't interpret it right praise the lord let me ask you a question tonight if you was to take the advice if you was to believe what a denominational church out there just some church whatever church it is there's many different ones out there if you just believe what they said what would your chances be of being right be pretty slim wouldn't it all right now the prophet of god said we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth you know why he said that we ought to be because we have god come down and come down in the platform and when the preacher says something go out there and vindicate it every time as long as the man lived jesus would come and he could prove that this is the right interpretation this is the truth what is your chance of being right by believing the gospel the bible and the message of this hour i'll tell you this your chances are pretty good because jesus proved it and vindicated and stood behind it amen hey i guarantee you if i sit up here and say no if i tell you the truth if jesus don't come and vindicate that he's here and then it's really him the resurrected christ you ain't got to believe it and if he he come and do that wouldn't you be convinced but see he came already and vindicated this message this vindicated message don't have to be vindicated anymore it's already been vindicated for 33 years god vindicated it i already i believe it amen i still believe god does miracles amen amen but i'm not in a position of a prophet and god reveals his secrets to his servants the prophets amen the prophet it means a divine interpreter of the word of god only really only a prophet has a right to interpret it because he speaks directly with god amen all right and so as long as we preach what that message says what the bible is according to about we're going to be fine it's going to be safe other than that you're not safe at all because there's so many different interpretations amen where was me book of ephesians right i kind of got sidetracked a little bit praise be to god ephesians ephesians chapter one all right according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love now the first half of that sentence is telling you when we were chosen and who we were chosen and the second part tells us what condition that we were predestinated to be in and that is to be holy and without blame before him in love but the work was done when when we said when was your chosen to be without blame and holy before the foundation of the world god picked you he chose you one in there something out of jesus will say well whosoever will let him come another place he'd say you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordains you is that right amen because i'll tell you this long before you chose him he chose you already he chose you before the foundation's world now i want to say this that we are based on free moral agents we are free moral agents all human beings are from all ages judas was a female agent and cain was a free moral agent and jesus and god himself went out of his way to try to get cain to do right didn't he he sure did same with any same with the pharisees same with the sadducees he says whosoever will let him come the colleagues anybody that wants to come come on god is not willing that anybody pay he's not willing but he sure does know who he's gone and who doesn't he is the beginning and the end he he knew how you know even the even the raptures already wrote the destruction of the worlds already wrote amen even the new millenniums already wrote the new having a new mirth it's all predestinated isn't that right sure it's all predestinated listen to this now notice let's go over to verse 11. in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated all right according to the purpose of him who worketh once in a while something after his will do you think there's anything out there that is not according to what his will is no there's people that's absolutely lost now children that god knew it's going to go that way who worketh all things after the counsel of his will praise be to god in 111 and then also 14 all right down through 14 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom he also trusteth after you have heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believe you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of god so he's saying there the baptism of the holy ghost is the earnest money it's the down payment so to speak amen praise be to god you know seeing the things if you look carefully if you look in the mirror you'll see who you are it's like looking in that mirror with a little boy you'll recognize who you are amen and just as jesus talked to the pharisees and the scribes and they claimed that they were abraham with their father and everything you know but they simply couldn't hear his words you know he that is of god hears god's words if it's the truth you hear it amen you'll come to it just as sure as anything but then he went back and says no you're not abraham's children but you are of your father the devil and his works will you do pretty strong amen like i said we've heard it before but for some reason god seemed to want me to go down this road is that all right amen maybe i should just go ahead and go a little further while i'm at it would that be okay because we not we know that jesus taught he says you know the world is like a field and the good sower went forth and he sowed good speed and then at the tares there's another one came in so tares amen and then he went to explaining what the wheat and the tares were he says the tares are the children of the wicked one and that what he says and then in saint john 3 somewhere of 312 or somewhere not as cain who was of that wicked one this is what scares people to death is the fact that they're children of god and there is children of that serpent in this world there's two kinds of people in this world and the people that are of the devil i don't care how much he preached to him i don't care uh if you prove to them you prove to them without any question huh remember that uh preacher that came to brother branham he says you know i don't believe in divine healing now you couldn't get me to believe it and so forth you know and and he says i'll give a thousand dollars to anybody that can prove that there's any divine healing and brother and went and got an absolute affidavit from a doctor stating that he was absolutely a miracle he showed it to him he said well i got to go to texas this side or the other let me get a child and cut her hand and you heal it then i'll believe but the man says when you're shown something like that and then you still don't believe he says election's off elections off in other words no other gods that's pretty strong in it because a real child of god down in here when the prophet said from down in your heart somewhere even as a child you knew there was something about it in there there was a call there there was something there i could bear witness of it i am a witness that even when i was in sin i already knew that there was something down in there that was different i didn't know what it was until i stumbled into in a good old service and come across the gospel the gospel i shine on here and i found out who i was and what i was amen that's exactly right we know that this gospel is what brings us to our recognition we know that we weren't saved uh we were actually saved before the foundation of the world even jesus said that the works were done amen before the foundation of the world that jesus was even crucified before the foundation under the war and everything else amen you might say we're just going through the motions we are just going through the emotions as far as god's concerned because it's already written he already knows so there's no surprises to him whatsoever there's nothing new to him but what are we doing we're playing our part so to speak isn't that right we find out in this life amen and the choice that we make we find out who we really are you've heard the phrase amen that a man is defined by the the choices that he makes is that right we bear our fruit you can tell a person by the life that they live but what choices they make tells you who you are amen that's why i believe every son of god i choose god i choose god i might i give my god my uh my heart and my all what is it that causes you to do that something down in here called the seed germ of god everybody else can hear it know it and everything else and just walk away and there was millions that saw the power of god in our generation like never can i say this like never in all of those stars and all the last 2000 years never was such a display of god world over at all it was in germany it was in england it was certain places but this was world over that god manifests himself to challenge the hindu the buddha that seeks to change all of them say if your god can open this blind man's eyes i will follow your religion anybody come on come on up that's what he said do it but in my lord jesus who i represent not him being jesus but who i represent who i proclaim to you the resurrect resurrected jesus christ that died two thousand years ago died for our sins he is here today if he'll open this blind man's eyes how many will receive him huh and how he knows god opened his eyes and thirty thousand received it it's not what you did with jesus yesterday it's what you do with jesus the truth today amen praise be to god amen all right shall we go a little further all right ephesians romans is another one romans 8. for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose now we know that many are called right but jesus said few are what chosen by who chosen us unto salvation when before the foundation of the world god did the choosing amen why because he knew what you would choose he knew what you would do his foreknowledge causes them to be able to do that how many knows we serve a big god and we cannot we can never try to bring god down to our thought our idea our doctrine or anything we have to open up our mind to what god is what he thinks the way he thinks and what he has said amen praise be to god all right to the according to his purpose for whom he did for no that's pretty simple all right he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among men and brethren moreover who he predestinate them he also call praise be to god and whom he called them he also justified whom he justified them he also glorified amen praise be to god how many knows that this was all done before one star was created we experienced it in our life in that right by experiencing salvation justification sanctification and also glorified our prophet explained to us that we have a theophany waiting for us if we would die and drop dead before this service is over huh there's another body waiting according to paul if this earthly tabernacle of this house will be dissolved we have one already waiting for us in heaven you know right we've won that's our glorified body is already over there so we are already glorified amen praise be to god now notice and what shall we say then these things if god before us who can be against us [Music] praise be to god who can be against us amen verse 9 chapter 9 verse 11. all right verse 11 he says it this way well let's go back a little bit shall i let's go to ten and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by one father isaac for the children being yet not born neither having done any good or evil for the that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it said unto her the elder shall serve the younger and it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated before they had done amen says this way god could say he so have i hated jacob ever loved because he foreknew what they would be amen because he knew how esau would be amen amen praise be to god what shall we say that is their unrighteousness with god and that's where people think there's unrighteousness with god they think that god makes you do this god makes you do that let me tell you something i thank god for everything that he has predestinated in my life you know why because so many times before i even pray for something before i even ask for something i have a need of something and god will just supply it right there how many has ever been there you say boy that couldn't have worked out better you know and that or you'll pray for something and it almost happened instantly what is it god knows what you have need of the bible says before you even ask if you're a son of god or daughter of god he supplies your niece he'll take care of you he knows that you have need of clothing and food seek first the kingdom and all these things shall be added unto you not if you beg for him first no he shall be added unto you god is watching out for our lives aren't you thankful for that and i don't know about you but my heart's desires lord just help me to find that perfect will that you have in my life and i believe i'm where i'm god wants me to be i believe i'm serving this purpose i'm happy with that amen sometimes i think well i'd assure the like i've been a missionary go out there you know and really have to stretch my faith and you know and see god do great things out there and so forth and i was like what did i ever do more missionary work why didn't i go out there and do more then i think baby well isn't that what god wanted you to do you're doing what god wanted you to do amen that's why i think sometimes listen if god is blessing you where you're at and you believe that you're in god's will be your lord i thought dear lord stay right where you are because well i'll tell you you get out of that will and you can get into chaos if you get in the permissive will of god you watch god's hand come down on you because lord his child and he isn't an old granddaddy yeah uh he isn't no grandfather no he is a daddy he is he will whoop you amen aren't you glad for that though straighten your back up bring you right back in line praise be to god all right let's go a little further all right for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion there's people that think they can tell god what to do let me tell you something ain't nobody going to tell god what to do ain't nobody going to tell god that he's unjust he knows exactly who to have mercy on on and who not to have mercy on because they know what they'll do and so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but god that shows mercy for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this purpose have i raised thee up that i might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth god knew that pharaoh was going to be a rascal he know that pharaoh was stubborn isn't that right he knew that he would never let him go he knew what was in pharaoh's heart he says i'm telling you what i'm going to make you and even he even hardened pharaoh's heart there was no injustice in that because he already knew exactly what pharaoh would do and how he would therefore hath he mercy on whom we will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth praise be to god thou wilt say then unto me why does he yet find fault for who has resisted his will but no man who art i that replies against god shall the thing form say unto him that formed it why hast thou made me thus had not potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor amen sure he does praise the lord let's go to another scripture talking about before the foundation of the world did i read the one in first corinthians let's go to first corinthians 1. huh i'm gonna try second corinthians because that's not the right one if that's not it we'll move over to the next one nope that's not it either i don't know why i've got that wrote down but we'll go to second timothy go to second timothy with me would you second timothy 1 8 and 9. be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of the me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began let's give the lord a hand praise be to god hallelujah and you know what else you know why i believe that's why jesus said so much he says blessed are your ears if they can hear blessed are your eyes of understanding because they can understand blessed are you many prophets and different ones look to seedy things and have not seen them but blessed are you if you listen to think about this if you have given your heart unreserved absolutely signified back to you that he has accepted you that you are a part of him that you have given your life to him you've been baptized in his name fills you with the holy ghost you know what that means that means that you were in his thinking and that you've got your name written on that book of life and you ought to be the happiest person on the face of the world you might say well you made your choice yeah you did have the how many knows we all got a choice we all have to come you all have to accept that amen and god knew who wouldn't that's why it's a different subject but listen you tie that in and it's exactly god knew you would and if you did you are ought to be the happiest person in the world to know that not just he know that before the foundation of the world but he knows that you would be saved and he would actually lead you he would guide you how many has ever had uh sure we've had times where we just have to decide well do i want to move here or don't i want to move here do i want to get this job or do i want to do this and we don't get confused don't we all sometimes and then we finally do something right but to think that god knew that you'd have that and then he knew what choice you would make and the big thing about it is if you're a son and daughter of god you got down on your knees and say god what do you want me to do amen and god guides you right into what you're supposed to do amen he blesses you and he keeps you right there isn't that right how many is glad for that amen so god is never confused we get confused sometimes when we think well i made this choice but let how many knows you don't want to lead yourself no sheep have to have a leader they have to have a shepherd we as children of god we have to have a separate lord lead me amen that's why we say lord lead us into all truth how in the world are can they gonna say whosoever will let him come and another place talk no man come come unto me my father draw him many are called but few are chosen isn't that right over there it talks about their name put on the lamb book of life from the foundation of the world many places am i right all wander after the beast whose names were not put on that lambo because god knew and he wrote that name down but they still have to play that part out they'll still wonder if their names aren't there please be aren't you glad to serve a god that has it together then the prophet says nothing's out of cater he said look there's going to be a age called the laodicea age people are going to be rich and they're going to have a bunch of junk in other words they're going to have a bunch of goods rich and increased with goods you know what the world over folks i don't care what country it is there's no doubt all of them just increased with goods and they have their attitude they have need of nothing my and no it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor unhappy folks just go to walmart grocery pickup and you'll find how miserable people are people are miserable they have no joy they have no smile they have no happiness they have all that stuff but they're miserable why because they are blind and they're naked wretched poor and don't know it he prophesied that's how the age would be and that's what we see but praise be to god there's a group of people getting ready to leave this world who heard another cry come out of her [Applause] come out of that misery come out of that denial systems come to a pure unadulterated word of god come unto me we heard that eagle scream it's brought us out it's leading us day by day i get up of the morning i say lord what do you want me to do today huh lord whatever you want me to do that's what i want to do amen how many is with me how many just wants to be led by god he knew you before the foundation of the world you made the choice for him he knew that he wrote that name down and he's got the rest of your life planned out aren't you glad for it amen all right we're going to close amen we won't keep you but god the great god if you've got eternal life then that germ of eternal life to him that hath to him shall be given to him that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he had got to have the germ of eternal life was in you at the beginning and you were there you were in his thinking your name and all another place he says he knew how you would look he knew what your name would be he knew everything about you i mean come on people think about it if you knew everything there's just nothing he didn't know that's right in your parents conception he was chosen by him out of a million to live in the first place aren't you glad for that your name and all and he by foreknowledge ordained you to see this and you that would that was not ordained you'll never see it another place the prophet of god said he says those predestinated ones are really the only ones that's even considered in redemption because that's the only ones that's going to accept it that's the only one that's going to be redeemed is the one he's written that name on and when that last name is redeemed because remember redeem means to bring something back that was lost amen a part of god that was lost when adam and eve fell amen but even now god still has his children that he has that he had in his thinking for the foundation of the world i'm so glad for that i'm glad by god's grace that i am in fellowship with him that you're in fellowship with him and you can know that if you ever and the prophet put it this way he says if you have eternal life if you have it then you always was with god amen because you was a part of god and it shows you it shows you that you was a part of god from the very beginning amen but you can't really say that if you don't have eternal life you don't know yet who you are or what you are but once you have that eternal life then you know that you are a part of him and you can no more pass away then god can pass away you love him god bless you let's stand this evening musicians if you'll come two thoughts i had on and that is lord jesus i am so thankful that i have made my choice to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus no turning back no turning back because that choice that i made showed that i was in his thinking showed that my name must have been on that book god must have known that that's the way that i would choose because those pharisees and so forth man even though lazarus rose from the dead it still didn't convince them they wanted to go kill address get rid of death what kind of unbelief darkness that they're living in rejecters of jesus christ rejected of the vindicated word shows who they really are that they were not god's children but they were of the devil their father and to know tonight each one that has gotten the new birth experience to know that your tomorrow is in god's hands your whole future he has planned already whatever is coming your way he's already got it all fixed up for you all things work together for good to them that love god them who are called according to his purpose lord jesus we bow our heads in adoration to you tonight knowing god of how wonderful and how great you are lord and how that you have touched each one of our lives lord jesus and lord i truly believe that as you have said all that the father has given me will come to me and i will lose none of them we believe that we're in your hands lord jesus and that you love us and that you take care of us lord even as you spoke in your prayer about the love that god has for us is the same love that he had for you before the foundation of the world lord tonight we ask god that you help each and everyone here both in the virtual audience and in lord jesus the immediate audience god we ask god that you help us to stay in your perfect will we don't want your permissive will we want you to have the complete preeminence in our lives we want to surrender and say god lord don't let me go wrong don't let me go the wrong way don't let me falter or fail but lord keep me in what you have thought that i'm supposed to be in lord before the foundation of the world walking in your purity in your holiness walking in your peace and in your joy and in your love father i just ask god that you just help us to understand lord jesus appreciate even trials that come our way it's what you allow hardships is for our molding it's for our making it's all for our good we ask god that you'd help us lord jesus to be molded into your image as you have predicted destinated us to be in jesus name amen and amen aren't you glad that you have made him your choice amen how does that sound go
