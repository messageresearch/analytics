[33:04] preeminence in every aspect of the

[33:41] Jesus to speak your word father what you
[33:43] would have to say to the people tonight
[33:45] we ask it in Jesus name amen and
[33:50] amen turn if you will to Revelations
[34:00] The Book of
[34:03] Revelations
[34:05] 3 Revelations
[34:09] 3 and
[34:11] uh we'll read verse 20 behold I stand at
[34:17] the door and knock If any man hear my
[34:20] voice and open the door I will come into
[34:23] him and will s with him and he with me
[34:28] may God add His blessings to the reading
[34:29] of the word you can be seated this
[34:36] evening
[34:39] amen amen tonight service I do feel like
[34:44] amen uh is certainly a message that'll
[34:48] help us if you're really interested in
[34:50] drawing closer to the Lord amen how many
[34:53] is interested in drawing closer to the
[34:55] Lord and we're going to learn how just
[34:57] how to do that with the help of the Lord
[35:00] amen and so I want to maybe just start
[35:05] kind of where I've uh felt led to begin
[35:08] with amen because we know that first of
[35:11] all that Jesus is the door he is a door
[35:14] now brother Brandon preached I think
[35:16] five messages on uh I think I counted
[35:19] about five message on the door to the
[35:21] heart door to the heart and of course he
[35:23] would always go when he spoke of that he
[35:25] would talk about even Hitler he would
[35:27] talk about Hitler if Hitler would come
[35:29] to your door knocking and how how what a
[35:32] privilege that would have been amen now
[35:35] I'm sure that would be scary after you
[35:38] found out what he really was right I
[35:40] mean afterwards now maybe before when
[35:42] you still had respect for him you know
[35:45] you could maybe you know give him honor
[35:47] and so forth but certainly not after you
[35:49] find out what he was able capable of and
[35:52] what he's done amen you wouldn't want
[35:54] him at your door a so amen amen but uh I
[35:59] mean he also talked about Caesar and
[36:01] different ones you know that come to the
[36:02] door but we realize the one great door
[36:05] that we've been privileged amen uh to
[36:08] have and that is the door of Jesus Amen
[36:11] and over uh I believe it was way over in
[36:14] Genesis over in
[36:16] Genesis when uh Adam and Eve had eternal
[36:20] life and they forfeited that eternal
[36:23] life by disobeying what God Said and it
[36:26] says in verse
[36:28] uh chapter 3 and: 22 and the Lord said
[36:30] behold the man is come as one of us to
[36:33] know good and evil and now least he put
[36:36] forth his hand and take also of the tree
[36:37] of life and eat and live forever
[36:40] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[36:44] from the Garden of Eden to till the
[36:47] ground from when he was taken so he
[36:50] drove out to man amen and he placed at
[36:53] the east of e Garden of Eden cherubims
[36:56] and a flaming sword
[36:58] which turned every way to keep the way
[37:01] of the Tree of Life in other words to
[37:03] keep them from actually receiving
[37:05] eternal life so he basically closed the
[37:09] door the door become shut now how many
[37:12] knows this is the most tragic thing that
[37:14] we could have ever imagined because it
[37:17] was the fall of
[37:18] humanity right it was the fall of
[37:21] humanity was the separation of Adam and
[37:24] Eve and the fellowship that they had
[37:26] with Almighty God it was the end of a
[37:29] perfect life it was the end of speaking
[37:31] the word and uh you know that word being
[37:35] confirmed moving trees moving mountains
[37:37] and whatever you wanted to it was the
[37:39] end of that and it was beginning of toil
[37:41] it was beginning of sweating starting to
[37:44] have to work for everything that you do
[37:45] that we experience today isn't that
[37:48] right and I did a a a pretty long study
[37:52] about that but I I really want to go in
[37:54] a different direction before we run out
[37:56] of time tonight
[37:58] but I feel to just maybe pick this up
[38:00] because this is kind of what uh the
[38:03] direction that I kind of want to go with
[38:04] there at first amen and so
[38:11] amen amen how many loves the Lord
[38:13] tonight can we just take our time amen
[38:17] this time I have set this to only shut
[38:20] down every 15 minutes so hopefully we
[38:23] won't struggle with it quite as much
[38:26] amen
[38:28] now we're going to go way back
[38:30] here amen and of course we know that
[38:34] those those those
[38:36] cherubims uh you know that protected all
[38:39] four sides amen of the garden of Ed four
[38:43] different sides that they and brother
[38:44] bam talked about it representing the
[38:46] four uh the 12 tribes of the children of
[38:49] Israel is that right the 12 tribes
[38:52] there's four can't I don't have it here
[38:53] but there's four tribes on each each
[38:56] side that guarded the throne isn't that
[38:59] right where where the throne is where
[39:01] God is also it come down into the New
[39:05] Testament representing Matthew Mark Luke
[39:08] and John now I'm not going to go into
[39:10] great DET detail of this but Revelations
[39:13] chapter when he brother Brandon preached
[39:14] Revelations chapter 4 part three is
[39:17] where he explains all of these things
[39:20] everything from uh you know uh Dan and
[39:24] Ephraim and Reuben I believe it is and
[39:27] all of
[39:27] different the the heads of the tribes
[39:31] like Ruben and Dan and I think Dan was
[39:33] the face of a man and uh and and I can't
[39:36] remember just what all of them were but
[39:38] they all all represented the four powers
[39:40] of Revelations okay those four those
[39:43] four and also Matthew Mark and Luke
[39:45] represented those same things amen so
[39:48] Matthew Mark Luke and John became the
[39:51] four guards or cherubims so to speak
[39:54] that protected the way of life only with
[39:57] these it was not anymore keeping people
[40:01] out isn't that right but this Matthew
[40:03] Mark Luke and John amen uh pointed to
[40:06] one thing and they guarded the book of
[40:08] Acts how many knows because the book of
[40:10] Acts was the door or the Gateway back to
[40:14] God how many believe that acts 238 is
[40:16] the door to God repent every one of you
[40:19] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[40:21] Jesus Christ for remission of your sins
[40:22] and you shall receive the gift of the
[40:24] Holy Ghost the promise is to you to your
[40:25] children to them that are far off this
[40:27] was the key that Peter had amen that God
[40:30] gave to Peter that whatever he locks his
[40:32] lock whatever he unlocks he gave him the
[40:34] keys to the kingdom and he was unlocking
[40:36] so to speak this
[40:38] door amen and Matthew Mark Luke and John
[40:42] brother Brandon when he was speaking is
[40:43] in Revelation chapter 4 part three where
[40:46] he spoke greatly and he was trying to go
[40:47] into many different scriptures but amen
[40:50] I thought of that same I was thinking of
[40:51] the same thing where Matthew he talked
[40:53] about going into all the world teaching
[40:55] them to observe all things whatever I
[40:56] have command Ed you amen is that right
[40:59] he says baptizing them in the name of
[41:00] the father Son and the Holy Ghost Luke
[41:02] also at the end of his chapter he says
[41:04] you know and then open he their
[41:05] understanding that they might understand
[41:07] the scripture thus it behold Christ to
[41:09] suffer and to rise from the dead the
[41:10] third day and that repentance and
[41:12] remissions of sins should be preached
[41:14] should be preached in his name among all
[41:16] nations beginning at Jerusalem so all of
[41:19] those guards all they pointed all
[41:21] pointed to that gate amen amen but the
[41:24] book of Acts actually shows exactly
[41:26] where that gate was amen and that was
[41:29] amen repentance amen and accepting of
[41:32] the Lord Jesus
[41:33] Christ so he says it this way he says
[41:37] now instead of the cherubims now I want
[41:39] you to I want you to I want to say
[41:41] something instead of those cherubims
[41:42] guarding this Throne they're out here
[41:45] seeking trying to run people amen trying
[41:49] to bring people through the gate back to
[41:52] the tree of life again that they might
[41:55] take this Jesus said I am the bread of
[41:57] life that come down from heaven Amen in
[41:59] other words in another place brother bam
[42:01] says he says we know that he would guard
[42:03] it the way we know that Jesus said that
[42:05] I am the way the truth and the life so
[42:08] it guarded it from becoming to Christ
[42:10] amen and receiving eternal life but here
[42:13] they're pointing to Jesus Christ and now
[42:16] not only are they trying to drive people
[42:18] in and drive the people to come and and
[42:20] we think of the scripture he says where
[42:21] he says go out into highways and H
[42:23] Hedges and compel them to come in amen
[42:26] so there we're compelling trying to get
[42:28] our best to get people to come
[42:31] in cuz how many knows there's another
[42:33] door that want to talk about how many
[42:35] knows that there's a door what we call
[42:37] the door when Opportunity
[42:40] Knocks when Opportunity Knocks amen
[42:43] sometimes it's best to take it amen and
[42:45] amen opportunity is a great door amen
[42:50] privilege is the door amen we're are
[42:53] privileged people how many how many
[42:54] times brother B said that we are
[42:56] privileged people
[42:57] as long as Jesus is sitting on that
[42:59] Mercy Seat we are a privileged people
[43:04] ain't that right to be able to come into
[43:06] that door one of those that one day that
[43:09] door will be shut there will be no more
[43:11] privilege there will be no more
[43:13] opportunity for people to come amen how
[43:16] many knows this opportunity that we have
[43:18] to come to Christ is only in this world
[43:21] and in this realm Catholics try to tell
[43:24] you that they have a Purgatory they can
[43:26] pray you out if you have 100 Grand 150
[43:28] Grand well you know you might be able to
[43:31] help your ancestors
[43:32] [Music]
[43:34] out or we can sell you a bridge on the
[43:37] Sahara
[43:41] somewhere they're selling something a
[43:43] that right there somebody something and
[43:46] they're getting rich doing it too is
[43:48] that right oh my I don't want to go
[43:51] there but we know in the Dark Ages
[43:52] Luther me one of the thesis was man he
[43:54] says this thing about at during that
[43:57] time they were actually giv people uh
[44:00] you know if you paid the priest so much
[44:02] he would write a writing and let you
[44:04] have
[44:06] indulges isn't that right indulge in sin
[44:09] and you'll be pardoned you'll be
[44:11] forgiven wow he's really hungry for
[44:14] filthy lucer isn't he yeah but he gets
[44:17] the goal of the
[44:18] world but anyway so much for that but uh
[44:23] anyway so yeah so there's no there's no
[44:25] after this life is over this is the time
[44:28] that we're privileged we have a very the
[44:31] opportunity the door of opportunity and
[44:34] I thought you know just like anybody any
[44:36] one of us if we had a had a had a um
[44:40] maybe a company that would call us and
[44:43] offer us $50 an hour to do something
[44:45] pretty simple and easy and my you got a
[44:48] great retirement you got a 401k that in
[44:50] 20 years or 15 years you're going to
[44:53] have $10 million in the bank how many
[44:56] take it probably
[44:58] yeah yeah yeah yeah I would I would do
[44:59] that you're going to be able to retire
[45:01] in 10 years cuz surely you're smart
[45:04] enough to take 10 million turnning
[45:05] around and make another 10 or so is that
[45:08] right and just live off the interest or
[45:09] something right but anyway yeah you
[45:12] would you know and so there' be benefits
[45:14] that come along with that amen be with
[45:17] that privilege how many knows that it's
[45:18] a absolute uh a privilege to boy this
[45:22] glasses man take them
[45:25] away amen it's a it's a privilege and an
[45:28] honor to know the Lord Jesus Christ to
[45:31] serve him I'm glad to be serving him
[45:34] amen we're not worried about 10 million
[45:36] we're not worried about that worried
[45:37] about we're about the worried about the
[45:39] benefits that we're going to receive at
[45:41] the end of this life of having a new
[45:44] body amen why do I say new body oh we're
[45:48] there going to have joy unspeakable
[45:50] we're going to have peace we're going to
[45:51] have love of God it's going to be all
[45:52] great and hungry no all of those things
[45:55] you already possess the only thing you
[45:57] you ought to need tonight is a body
[45:59] change why because you're already
[46:01] redeemed brother benam said you already
[46:03] have the joy of the Lord we all have
[46:05] peace that pass this understanding
[46:06] already we all ought to already have the
[46:09] peace of God in our hearts we should all
[46:11] have the love of God in our hearts
[46:13] already not all over there amen when we
[46:17] come into Christ we receive the benefits
[46:19] of almighty God before I preach my
[46:22] sermon can I talk about those benefits
[46:24] for just a minute I thought about those
[46:26] benefit benefits that we get from God
[46:28] and and David he said it in Psalms
[46:31] 105 103 103 he says you know bless the
[46:35] Lord oh my soul and all that is with me
[46:38] within me bless His holy name bless the
[46:41] Lord oh my soul and forget not all of
[46:44] his
[46:45] benefits how many knows it's just
[46:48] awesome to be inside of this
[46:51] door I'm glad to that Jesus is the door
[46:55] and that you don't try to clim CL up
[46:57] some other way but we come in the way
[46:59] that he said to come there's a lot of
[47:02] people trying to climb up some other way
[47:04] but there's only one
[47:06] way amen and we're in that by God's
[47:10] grace we can say hopefully everybody man
[47:12] woman and child is in that in
[47:18] Christ amen how many knows that when you
[47:21] were in Christ you have escaped the
[47:24] corruption that is in the world
[47:27] oh my I want to tell you so much all at
[47:29] once and I can't let me go on getting
[47:32] out all these benefits who forgive us
[47:35] all thine
[47:36] iniquities how many know that's one of
[47:39] the benefits when you come to God when
[47:42] you accept him you get your iniquities
[47:46] forgiven that's right all of your
[47:48] iniquity is
[47:49] gone sometimes we have a hard time
[47:52] forgiving ourselves or thinking that God
[47:54] will forgive us because perhaps of the
[47:56] all the Fai that we have but I'm here to
[47:58] tell you that God is rich in
[48:01] Mercy and he is more willing to forgive
[48:03] the times in what where we willing to
[48:05] forgive ourselves your servant of God
[48:07] that tells us to forgive each other 490
[48:09] times a day amen our God is a very
[48:12] forgiving God come on open up the
[48:14] benefits a little bit and realize he's
[48:16] there to forgive you of all your
[48:22] iniquities
[48:23] hallelujah amen all right I'm going to
[48:26] bring this while I'm at
[48:28] it brother B makes a statement he says
[48:32] he said uh the power he says and the
[48:35] power that will raise us up is right in
[48:39] us now we are now in Heavenly places we
[48:43] are now in the power we are now in the
[48:47] power of the
[48:49] Resurrection see and if there wasn't a
[48:51] law to Faith to that Sons and Daughters
[48:54] of God would create them World out here
[48:57] and go live a private life on
[49:02] it
[49:03] amen you have the power in you to do it
[49:07] if you have one shadow of the power of
[49:09] God in you you got the power of God to
[49:13] do it because God is omnipotent you
[49:16] could speak a world into existence and
[49:19] go live on it amen now I said that
[49:23] because I and and I wrote down here that
[49:26] I might make some controversial
[49:28] statement here but you bear with me
[49:33] amen I'll get back on the thought here
[49:36] praise the Lord
[49:41] listen you
[49:46] know talking about creating a world and
[49:49] living on
[49:52] it I've got wrote down here we can't
[49:56] change
[49:57] the
[49:58] world that we live
[50:01] on but we can change the world that we
[50:03] live
[50:04] in how many believe
[50:13] that let me see
[50:15] here see let me finish the quote that's
[50:19] what power is in the church now but it
[50:22] is controlled by law and that law is not
[50:25] keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a
[50:26] La of Faith Jesus said all things are
[50:28] possible to them that believe if you can
[50:30] believe it whatever God will lead you
[50:32] your soul to believe it's
[50:35] yours wow so brother Bram says you know
[50:38] if there wasn't a law to amen the
[50:40] benefits that you have been given of
[50:44] faith we talk about how that all things
[50:47] are possible them they believe we
[50:49] believe in amen casting out cancer and
[50:51] whatever it might be a't that right
[50:53] anything's possible stopping the sun and
[50:56] the moon like like Joshua
[50:59] did am mean now brother B says here if
[51:02] there wasn't a lot of your faith you
[51:03] could create a world and go live on it
[51:05] and I've got wrote down here you know
[51:07] but God don't give you the faith to do
[51:09] that cuz I am happy with the fact that
[51:13] Jesus said I go to prepare a place for
[51:15] you that where I am there you can come
[51:18] how many believes he's creating that
[51:22] world
[51:24] Amen praise the Lord
[51:27] now the reason I brought this in was
[51:29] that when you come into Christ and you
[51:31] receive these benefits amen your whole
[51:34] world
[51:38] changes
[51:40] amen I think it was in Arnold
[51:42] Schwarzenegger and I think whenever they
[51:44] uh what was it I forget what it was but
[51:48] it was some movie called where he went
[51:49] into the future ain't that
[51:52] right he went into the
[51:55] future and they would try to change the
[51:57] future and then and that would change
[52:00] the present if and they come back from
[52:02] the future and try to change something
[52:05] isin that right and then that that would
[52:07] change the whole universe or the way
[52:09] that everything
[52:10] went be an
[52:12] alternate
[52:14] universe an alternate
[52:17] universe another another different
[52:23] course what about where in the world are
[52:25] you going with a big big old fch of old
[52:28] movies
[52:31] well I'm I think of when you come into
[52:35] Christ I think of when we come into
[52:38] Christ how did it change us your
[52:43] Universe it changes the world that you
[52:46] live on or not on but in how many know
[52:50] we all live in the world those Sinners
[52:52] out there those dope addicts they live
[52:55] in their own world
[52:57] brother bam said that Jesus lived in the
[52:59] world to himself amen and he had the
[53:02] faith he lived by the faith of God he
[53:04] lived by the love of God that's the
[53:06] world that Jesus lived
[53:08] in how many know the devil he lives in a
[53:11] different world Sinners live in a
[53:12] different world so to speak amen than
[53:14] what a Christian does and when you come
[53:17] into Christ wo I'm so glad that I did
[53:22] when I was young because I'm telling you
[53:24] what my universe and my world it ain't
[53:26] no telling what I would be no telling
[53:29] what you would be you might be a
[53:32] murderer ain't no telling what we would
[53:34] be Brother
[53:38] Brad because the world of this flesh and
[53:41] the world of the spirit are two
[53:43] different
[53:46] worlds
[53:48] amen or univers is as you might want to
[53:51] put
[53:52] it
[53:53] amen all right now let's go on with this
[53:57] thought that's right he
[54:00] forgives all of your iniquities Health
[54:04] all of your
[54:09] diseases praise the
[54:11] Lord I want to say that you might we we
[54:14] can both change our
[54:17] future we can change our
[54:20] past and we can change our
[54:24] present those are the the statements I
[54:26] really meant to make in first place took
[54:28] me a long time to get to
[54:30] it think about it isin't that something
[54:33] how many things you can change your
[54:36] past how in the world can you change
[54:39] your
[54:41] past and how can you change your future
[54:44] haven't we all
[54:45] said that the choices you make today
[54:48] will determine where you are in 5 years
[54:50] from now you are here because of choices
[54:53] you made in the past you're future will
[54:57] depend hey how many knows in the in this
[54:59] world every preacher preaches it that
[55:01] this is where you make your choice where
[55:03] you're going to spend
[55:05] eternity so you can change that future
[55:08] from Hell going Hellbound to
[55:12] heavenbound why it's all by the blood of
[55:14] Jesus Christ of course it's not by your
[55:16] own power but because that we're
[55:18] benefits we have access to the benefit
[55:20] of actually changing our
[55:24] future that's right and then the past
[55:26] how do you change your past well he
[55:29] forgives you all of your iniquities

[55:32] justified by
[55:35] faith and I can remember my past you can
[55:38] remember your past but brother brandham
[55:39] said that when God's eyes it's as though
[55:42] you've never done it in the first
[55:45] place you change it why by the blood of
[55:49] Jesus Christ he takes a ntion says it
[55:51] never happened in the first place W
[55:54] that's how we change it yeah aren't you
[55:57] glad that you can change your past you
[55:59] can erase your past brother bam said he
[56:02] says there's only one way to stop that

[56:06] that amen and get the blood of dip it in
[56:08] the blood of Jesus

[1:01:50] door to the
[1:01:51] heart and as you know he talked about
[1:01:54] the artist that that painted that
[1:01:55] picture of Christ ain't that right with
[1:01:59] no door

[1:02:05] critics looked at and say hey what no
[1:02:07] what what's this there's no knob on the
[1:02:09] door brother B makes a statement he says
[1:02:12] that's the way it is with the church God
[1:02:14] is painting a picture of a beautiful
[1:02:16] holy church but before it can ever be
[1:02:18] taken from the
[1:02:20] Earth to the Hall of Fame in the Palace
[1:02:23] of God it must first pass down the line
[1:02:26] of
[1:02:27] critics amen how many believe
[1:02:30] that blessed are you when men shall
[1:02:32] revile you and cast your name out as
[1:02:34] evil and see all kinds of manner of evil

[1:02:46] great big world has there's been many of
[1:02:48] them that has exist existed has knocked
[1:02:50] on doors and he's thinking of Caesar how
[1:02:53] when he would come down to a door of a
[1:02:55] peasant knocked on on the door when the
[1:02:57] peasant opened that door he could have
[1:02:59] seen who it was knocking he would have
[1:03:01] probably prostrated himself on the floor
[1:03:03] and said welcome Cesar just come into my
[1:03:06] house and honor me with you honor me
[1:03:09] with your coming into my humble abode
[1:03:12] and whatever you find in here whatever

[1:09:29] open that door of your
[1:09:34] conscience he's sensitive the holy
[1:09:37] spirit is sensitive so sensitive that

[1:09:42] here now don't go to the
[1:09:44] bathroom don't get up and walk around he
[1:09:46] don't like that it distracts him I don't
[1:09:49] understand that that's pretty

[1:10:01] Snoopy I say because God Amen he's
[1:10:04] interested in the most detail of your
[1:10:09] life and he will go into your conscience
[1:10:12] a lot of times and he'll say well what
[1:10:14] about
[1:10:15] this
[1:10:17] wony what about
[1:10:23] that amen
[1:10:25] you judge yourself on what it
[1:10:29] is but if you want to I'm going to say
[1:10:31] this if you want a closer walk with God
[1:10:33] you're going to have to open more
[1:10:36] doors you're going to have to open them
[1:10:38] doors we say that you know when you're
[1:10:41] wanting healing or you want something
[1:10:43] from God and and then you got to go and
[1:10:45] you got to sweep the house or you got to
[1:10:47] amen uh get all the skeletons out of the
[1:10:50] closet so to speak ain't that right you
[1:10:52] want to make sure that there's nothing
[1:10:54] hid down in your life that's going to
[1:10:56] hinder your
[1:10:57] healing you got to open that door you
[1:11:00] got to open that closet and say God
[1:11:02] search me search me all the way to the
[1:11:05] back little corner of the closet and
[1:11:07] find out if there's anything that I need
[1:11:10] to make right and if there is I'll make
[1:11:12] it
[1:11:16] right cuz I'm convinced there's a lot of
[1:11:19] people cuz it's hard one of the hardest
[1:11:21] things to do is when the Holy Spirit
[1:11:23] tells you using your conscience using
[1:11:25] your uh
[1:11:27] memory going into the door of your
[1:11:29] memory and knowing that you did somebody
[1:11:31] wrong and you never want to make it
[1:11:33] right you don't want to apologize
[1:11:35] because you just don't have it in you to
[1:11:37] apologize I thought about this while I
[1:11:39] was studying this and I hope everybody
[1:11:41] hears that but a real good medicine for
[1:11:44] your soul a real good healing for your
[1:11:47] soul a real good Deliverance for your
[1:11:50] soul is for you to say I'm sorry
[1:11:56] or I'm wrong or I was wrong will you
[1:11:58] forgive me that's one of the best
[1:12:00] medicines there
[1:12:04] is
[1:12:07] amen cuz just as the devil can use your
[1:12:10] conscience if you w don't watch he'll
[1:12:13] try to use your memory and your
[1:12:14] conscience to convict you of things
[1:12:16] you've done wrong that you've made right
[1:12:18] and it'll still bother you and you've
[1:12:19] got to say devil I'm slamming this door
[1:12:22] shut cuz it's under the blood but at the
[1:12:25] same time you've got to say to the Lord
[1:12:28] this door is open Lord how many would
[1:12:30] say to my conscience is open
[1:12:34] Lord if I need conviction convict
[1:12:38] me Snoop down into my soul Snoop into
[1:12:42] every area of my
[1:12:45] life see if there's any wicked way in me
[1:12:48] anywhere if there is take it out I want
[1:12:50] you to be Snoopy I want you to meddle in
[1:12:53] my affairs
[1:12:56] God loves to meddle in your
[1:12:59] Affairs we don't like when preachers
[1:13:01] meddle in your Affairs
[1:13:04] huh well he
[1:13:07] does Jesus
[1:13:09] does and every one of us got to be open
[1:13:13] and don't be having no Pitchfork
[1:13:14] religion with this oh I know so and so
[1:13:17] and I know so and
[1:13:19] so you better check your own
[1:13:23] house how many know
[1:13:26] if you have a business that first thing
[1:13:29] in your business is the Lord Jesus
[1:13:31] Christ amen I don't care what you have I
[1:13:35] don't care what it is and if Christ
[1:13:36] ain't first something else is and he's
[1:13:41] knocking hey you're putting something
[1:13:43] else in front of
[1:13:46] me
[1:13:48] amen and if you do that's actually what
[1:13:51] you love more that's where your treasure
[1:13:53] is and it's an idol
[1:13:59] that's right no matter what it is
[1:14:01] brother Brandon he would go into your
[1:14:03] private life he would talk about your
[1:14:04] self life uh and things like that I
[1:14:06] chose to go kind of into the direction
[1:14:08] of our our inlets of our uh see taste
[1:14:12] feel hear and smell
[1:14:15] amen that's
[1:14:18] right praise the Lord don't meddle in my
[1:14:21] business or my Affairs but God's going
[1:14:25] to do it he even checks the drawers the
[1:14:28] closet no matter what it
[1:14:31] is your feelings is another
[1:14:37] door brother banam when he preached on
[1:14:39] the inlets and when he preached on these
[1:14:41] different things he preached on the
[1:14:43] greatest battle ever fought and he
[1:14:44] talked about that's your
[1:14:46] universe that's your world how many
[1:14:48] knows this that that's the world that we
[1:14:50] have now I wish I'd have it but I don't
[1:14:54] try to I'm going to have have to try to
[1:14:55] get it organized a little better but we
[1:14:57] know he brother bam said draw three
[1:14:59] circles one is the body second one is
[1:15:02] the spirit and on the inside it's the
[1:15:04] soul body see taste feel hear and smell
[1:15:07] conscience region imaginations
[1:15:09] infections and so forth and memory and
[1:15:12] then on the
[1:15:13] inside is your soul that's controlled by
[1:15:16] one thing or other Faith or doubt isin't
[1:15:19] that right now I say controlled by but
[1:15:23] later in brother Brand's Ministry and I
[1:15:25] just read it before we come out he says
[1:15:27] that soul in there has to be a seed germ
[1:15:31] of God that is where your anchor is
[1:15:34] because people can do everything in the
[1:15:36] spirit realm and so forth but he says
[1:15:37] that soul that seed has to be of God
[1:15:42] Amen and he talks about how that how
[1:15:44] that the the Holy Spirit has to come in
[1:15:46] and he has to be the guard of each one
[1:15:48] of those places everything has to be
[1:15:50] scoured out all of those things have to
[1:15:52] be scoured out is that right or should I
[1:15:55] say protected by the Holy
[1:15:57] Ghost cuz if it isn't protected by the
[1:15:59] Holy Ghost and if it isn't cuz it's like
[1:16:02] I said it's a Inlet it comes in and we
[1:16:04] have a feeling and we all got
[1:16:07] feelings man how how how we can in our
[1:16:12] memory we all love good feelings we love
[1:16:15] to feel
[1:16:17] good but I wrote down here how can you
[1:16:20] feel
[1:16:21] good when you have condemnation in your
[1:16:24] conscience
[1:16:26] if your conscience condemns you how can
[1:16:28] you really feel
[1:16:29] good it don't matter if you marry a boy
[1:16:32] or boy marries a girl and you think that
[1:16:34] they're going to be a lot happy if
[1:16:36] you're married if you're not happy
[1:16:37] before you're probably not going to be
[1:16:39] happy afterwards why because that peace
[1:16:42] and that happiness has got to be in here
[1:16:47] first amen if you're relying on that
[1:16:50] it's not going to fulfill
[1:16:52] it why do you think there's so many
[1:16:54] divorces
[1:16:55] my husband just don't make me happy my
[1:16:57] wife just don't make me happy I'm he
[1:17:00] just does hasn't you know been what I
[1:17:03] expected him to be this that or the
[1:17:05] other you aren't happy in the first
[1:17:07] place in in the first
[1:17:11] place how many's glad to feel good amen
[1:17:16] feeling bad is a horrible thing feeling
[1:17:19] bad is a I hate to feel
[1:17:22] bad the only way you'll feel good is by
[1:17:24] having the Holy Spirit In Your Heart
[1:17:27] amen praise the Lord how many's glad for
[1:17:29] that amen now listen so he says so you
[1:17:34] can come in but don't you dare open that
[1:17:37] door
[1:17:40] amen don't you go in this one you stand
[1:17:44] right there why you would feel very not
[1:17:47] feel very welcome that's the way it is
[1:17:48] with some church members just let him
[1:17:50] come in oh I want you to be my savior
[1:17:53] but he wants to be your lord Lord Lord
[1:17:56] is rulership Jesus says why do you call
[1:17:58] me Lord and don't do the things say the
[1:18:01] do the things that I say or I command
[1:18:04] how many believe that Jesus wants to be
[1:18:06] the Lord of all the kingdoms of your
[1:18:11] heart you know I can say this for the
[1:18:13] church here when I talk about past when
[1:18:16] I talk about forgiveness even brother
[1:18:19] Andrew Glover really brought it in right
[1:18:21] after the next service after I had
[1:18:23] preached on it y all re see that and and
[1:18:26] and brought it to where hey you know
[1:18:28] you've got to make sure that that past
[1:18:29] is Forgiven that you don't hold grudges
[1:18:32] of the past and so forth it because
[1:18:33] it'll affect you not them and all of
[1:18:35] that I hope that's the case here with
[1:18:37] all of us I believe it is I don't know
[1:18:39] anybody here that's got that we've given
[1:18:41] forgiven anybody of any other path ain't
[1:18:44] that
[1:18:45] right that's right so I want to say that
[1:18:48] I believe when God opens that door when
[1:18:51] he knocks on that door the door of your
[1:18:52] past a't that right hey is everything
[1:18:55] taken care
[1:18:57] of

[1:19:50] and I want to be right with the Lord and
[1:19:52] I said well I maybe you all pray for me
[1:19:54] cuz I want to be on Thursday and Friday
[1:19:55] I want it to be every
[1:19:59] day this is what come to my heart
[1:20:01] brother Brandon was so surrendered to
[1:20:03] God until he he obeyed the speed limit
[1:20:06] how many he
[1:20:08] did amen I ain't going to get nobody to
[1:20:12] raise your hand
[1:20:13] but the Holy Spirit does convict you of
[1:20:16] every little
[1:20:17] thing amen Lord help us that's right
[1:20:22] because why he wants to be the Lord how
[1:20:25] many likes when he rules how many wants
[1:20:27] him to rule every aspect of your life
[1:20:30] why because if you rule it you're going
[1:20:32] to wreck it you ain't going to run it
[1:20:35] right it's not going to be blessed
[1:20:37] anyway so let God have
[1:20:39] control let God have control of every
[1:20:42] area of your life let him open up every
[1:20:45] door let him be snooping let him medle
[1:20:47] let whatever he wants Lord but you've
[1:20:50] got to have a sensitive conscience so he
[1:20:52] can talk to you because that's how he
[1:20:53] talks some people men yeah I'm a
[1:20:56] Christian with makeup and shorts on and
[1:20:58] everything else brother bam says you
[1:20:59] ain't got no more conscience more a
[1:21:01] snake has hips he was pretty hard about
[1:21:05] it he ain't got no conscience Bible says
[1:21:08] their conscience is seared with a hot
[1:21:11] iron
[1:21:13] amen well don't Am I Wrong Brother Brad
[1:21:16] or is as hot iron searing something
[1:21:18] would take the feeling out of it right
[1:21:20] it would take the feeling out of it so
[1:21:23] Lord help us tonight to have our
[1:21:25] conscience open to the holy
[1:21:27] spirit because it's important your
[1:21:30] seeing is
[1:21:32] important your understanding is
[1:21:34] important one of the greatest things one
[1:21:36] of the greatest one of the greatest
[1:21:38] things that I can think of is is is as
[1:21:42] far as when it comes to a door is your
[1:21:44] mind the door of your
[1:21:45] mind how many has heard the phrase you
[1:21:48] got to have a keep an open mind you got
[1:21:51] to keep your mind open to what God has
[1:21:54] cuz brother baham says he says it first
[1:21:56] comes down through the womb of your mind
[1:21:58] and then it goes down into your soul and
[1:21:59] you receive the word of God it comes
[1:22:01] down in there amen it becomes a
[1:22:04] revelation it becomes real brother bam
[1:22:06] says and the power of God comes down
[1:22:08] there and that's what gives you power
[1:22:10] it's not mind over matter but it's mind

[1:22:14] it but now that door also has to be
[1:22:16] closed how many knows the birds can fly
[1:22:18] over your head but you shut that
[1:22:20] door amen how many would agree that
[1:22:23] there's a lot of sin

[1:23:22] door young people remember that your
[1:23:26] minds is
[1:23:29] important I don't know I hope you you
[1:23:31] kids don't ever come to the place and
[1:23:34] I'll tell you this sometimes your mind
[1:23:37] tries to get the better of you you
[1:23:40] battle with your mind and your battle
[1:23:41] with your mind and I trust that you
[1:23:43] don't I'll tell you when you're your
[1:23:46] battle and your torment of your mind's
[1:23:49] going to come if
[1:23:50] you stay on the fence with things

[1:24:43] amen Lord help us the door of our
[1:24:48] thoughts

[1:24:54] there's a lot of things that you want to
[1:24:55] slam the door shut on when it comes to
[1:24:58] the devil because it starts with the
[1:25:02] mind and it comes down into
[1:25:05] here just like with feelings if you have
[1:25:08] been hurt by somebody
[1:25:13] hello and you hold that you're going to
[1:25:16] have a grumpy face I don't trust people
[1:25:19] I don't like
[1:25:20] people can I say something

[1:25:30] Christians if they live in the flesh and
[1:25:32] are selfish are very
[1:25:38] ugly very
[1:25:41] ugly I'll say this they're worse than
[1:25:44] the sinner because the sinner you know
[1:25:47] what you're dealing
[1:25:48] with brother Braham says there's no
[1:25:51] bigger stumbling block in the world than
[1:25:53] a professor with without a confession
[1:25:56] you better have
[1:25:57] it but BR place I'm going to say this
[1:26:00] this is a little strong but it's the
[1:26:01] truth some people ought to just not
[1:26:03] claim to be
[1:26:04] Christians they'd be better off not
[1:26:06] claiming to be a Christian if they're
[1:26:08] living completely and all the time
[1:26:10] contrary to
[1:26:12] it even brother brandham said that get
[1:26:15] an experience get the Holy
[1:26:18] Ghost and if you are I believe if you
[1:26:20] are a Christian you'll go to the corn
[1:26:22] field you'll go in the wood you'll go
[1:26:24] somewhere and say God I got to have this
[1:26:26] I got to have what I profess I don't
[1:26:29] want to live a hypocritical
[1:26:31] life
[1:26:33] amen I want to be exactly what I say
