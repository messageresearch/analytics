[44:56] foreign
[45:00] good morning everyone
[45:03] um stand with me if you will
[45:05] dismissed to Sunday school
[45:10] we'll be turning to
[45:14] Proverbs three but before we do I'm just
[45:17] going to ask brother Glenn if you would
[45:19] open the service and word of Prayer
[45:25] [Music]
[45:40] tell us
[46:03] proverbs
[46:05] three and will
[46:08] and the adverse 14.
[46:13] my my son forget not my law and let
[46:17] thine heart keep my Commandments
[46:26] let not Mercy In Truth forsake thee bind
[46:30] them about thy neck write them upon
[46:34] the table of thine heart
[46:43] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[46:46] and lean not unto thine own
[46:47] understanding
[46:54] be not wise in thine own eyes fear the
[46:57] lord and depart from evil
[47:04] honor the Lord with thy substance and
[47:06] with the the first fruits of all thine
[47:08] increase
[47:17] my son despised not the chastening of
[47:20] the Lord neither be wary of his
[47:23] correction
[47:24] thank you
[47:31] happy is the man that findeth wisdom in
[47:34] the man that geteth understanding and
[47:36] this last one together
[47:37] for the merchandise of it is better than
[47:40] the merchandise of silver the game
[47:42] thereof and fine gold and you may be
[47:45] seated brother Brian
[47:56] brothers and sisters
[48:00] you know if you just read that Psalm
[48:02] every day and applied it to your life
[48:03] things would be I think I know in my own
[48:06] life be different if you would uh turn
[48:09] to uh Romans the 13th chapter
[48:15] you know the scriptures that were up
[48:18] there I think they were I'm not sure but
[48:20] that one quote brother Brian had they
[48:23] had up there of brother Branham
[48:25] I think I was just noticing the date it
[48:27] was uh 9 11 1965 well that was a long
[48:32] time ago and uh basically it's telling
[48:35] us that it's no different for us this
[48:38] morning you have to
[48:40] truly if you're truly predestinated and
[48:43] truly a son and daughter of God the word
[48:45] of God is the only thing that really
[48:47] matters in our lives that's the only
[48:49] thing that really matters nothing
[48:50] outside of that not to say that there
[48:53] aren't things important that you have to
[48:55] do as an individual in your life
[48:57] but outside
[48:59] the word of God everything else that
[49:01] doesn't seem important anymore whether
[49:04] you're young or old what feeble or sick
[49:06] or healthy it doesn't make a difference
[49:08] you have to project a word of God in
[49:10] everything that you do and every say and
[49:13] I was just thinking
[49:15] this morning I'll I'll just read this
[49:16] after I don't know if I have a lot to
[49:18] say this morning
[49:20] but I I take to heart the one thing
[49:24] that's
[49:24] in this age that we live in this morning
[49:27] you know the scripture they were reading
[49:30] there from Hebrews or the Hebrews also
[49:32] says that we have no continuing cities
[49:34] in this life but we look for one to come
[49:37] so we don't really
[49:39] not that we we don't enjoy the things we
[49:41] do in this life that we don't benefit
[49:43] from them but our desires and our hopes
[49:46] are
[49:47] I'm not on those things they're in the
[49:50] greater thing in Salvation and what
[49:52] we'll get on the other side but we don't
[49:54] do it to get something we do it because
[49:56] we love him and eat we care
[49:59] that he cares about us most of all um
[50:02] I'll just read this chapter here this
[50:04] morning
[50:05] but I I was I was reading in uh
[50:09] and Joshua I was at the later chapter
[50:12] you know where
[50:14] where God was telling Joshua you're
[50:16] getting old and feasible
[50:18] and they were
[50:20] as much land still to possess and um and
[50:24] that was where the children of Joshua
[50:26] went off I swear the children of Israel
[50:28] fell they didn't fully possess the land
[50:30] they didn't drive out all the amalekites
[50:33] and all all the amorites like they
[50:35] should have but I'll just read what this
[50:37] quote this quote is from this morning in
[50:39] the devotional
[50:41] and uh and then I'll read out of the
[50:44] 13th chapter of Romans and
[50:48] it's better set here than anything I
[50:50] could say
[50:51] let me just give you a little twister
[50:54] just for a minute and I'll say how many
[50:56] has the holy ghosts and of course
[50:58] everyone would raise their hand because
[51:00] they wouldn't want to be singled out
[51:02] all right I'll see you have the Bible
[51:04] said that they have the Holy Ghost
[51:06] Inside and cried day and night for the
[51:09] Abomination done in the city
[51:11] and this goes back to the chapter in
[51:13] Ezekiel 9. but I'm I'm really what I was
[51:17] thinking about was further down now how
[51:20] many hands would go up how many of you
[51:22] can't rest at night and he's talking
[51:25] about how many of you saw in the for the
[51:27] things that go on in the country and in
[51:30] the church in the world so the full joy
[51:32] and power of God so and so sad for
[51:35] people that are lost
[51:36] and that's just as true today as it was
[51:39] back in this day that I lost my place
[51:42] day and night You Weep and cry for the
[51:44] Abominations
[51:45] who would be in that City how many of
[51:48] that's in the church that's what the
[51:50] Bible said the Holy Spirit evidence was
[51:54] yeah basically you caring about your
[51:56] brother and sister the man next to you
[51:58] the woman next to you care about them
[52:00] you don't just put yourself first in
[52:02] everything you do you care about people
[52:04] and how many of that is the church and
[52:07] the Bible said holy spirit evidence was
[52:10] and he told the ceiling angels and
[52:12] that's Ezekiel 9 that's what I said go
[52:14] throughout the city instead of Mark upon
[52:16] those
[52:17] to sign cry for the Abominations did in
[52:20] the city and and rest and the rest of
[52:23] them let the destroying Angels destroy
[52:25] them no matter how much members they was
[52:28] and how many things they've done so he's
[52:30] saying it's
[52:31] it's not on how much money you've spent
[52:33] how much your church membership none of
[52:36] that counts is in your heart what do you
[52:38] care about what are the things you put
[52:39] first and a man with an ink horn
[52:43] I lost my you have to how much members
[52:47] was how many of those things done in men
[52:49] with an acorn dressed in white which
[52:52] represents the Holy Spirit came forth
[52:54] and put a mark upon it all all them that
[52:56] saw it and cried for the Abominations
[52:58] done in the city I watched he said
[53:01] there's also slay orderly little
[53:04] children old women babies kill them all
[53:05] little children yes
[53:07] and then this is what I was thinking
[53:09] about this morning about sometimes in
[53:11] our lives we don't destroy those things
[53:13] that are in our lives or in our family
[53:14] and before you know it they keep
[53:17] creeping up again and again the same old
[53:19] issues that we have in our life to keep
[53:21] creeping up creeping up in our lives and
[53:24] if you don't kill that
[53:26] Spirit to kill that devil who'll be
[53:28] fighting you until the day you die right
[53:30] this is what brother Brandon had to say
[53:32] here
[53:32] so when Joshua entered the land of
[53:34] Canaan he said don't let one of them
[53:37] live if it's a cute little baby a little
[53:39] amalekite or a little Amorite killer you
[53:42] remember he
[53:43] grow up to be in a malachite and heal
[53:46] pollute your can so that little double
[53:48] you're playing with in your life the one
[53:50] that you don't kill one of these days is
[53:52] going to grow up and it's going to
[53:53] consume you
[53:54] he'll pollute the camp and those little
[53:57] things come back like the disagreeing
[54:00] with the word of God get rid of
[54:02] that thing I don't care what the
[54:04] nomination it belongs to you know you
[54:07] could take that in our day and age
[54:08] whatever it belongs to if it's contrary
[54:11] to the word of God you need to cast it
[54:13] off you say Well they're good I don't
[54:15] care how good people they are
[54:18] if they're contrary to the word that
[54:20] goes what that scripture was saying that
[54:22] brother Branham was talking about that
[54:24] predestinated seed oh we always
[54:27] puts the word first in everything it
[54:29] does
[54:30] get the thing out of you it's a growing
[54:32] little amalekite looks cute looks
[54:34] innocent looks like it's all right but
[54:36] you don't have anything to do with it
[54:38] you stay away from it well brother
[54:41] random I'll go down there because well I
[54:43] don't you just remember any amalekite
[54:45] anything that denies the word stay away
[54:47] from it and that's the world we're
[54:49] living it's a word denying world that we
[54:51] live in they don't believe the word of
[54:53] God they laugh at you when you talk
[54:55] about the word of God
[54:59] doesn't mean that you don't have to be
[55:01] around them you just don't have to
[55:02] receive what they're giving it denies
[55:05] words stay away from it have nothing to
[55:06] do with it at all how many beliefs
[55:08] that's the truth sure is see stay away
[55:10] from it who sang cry for the
[55:12] Abominations that did in the city
[55:15] where do you see that I can show you ten
[55:17] thousand speaking in tongues to one
[55:19] that's really burden for sin
[55:22] I gotta raise my hand sometimes I'm not
[55:24] like this in my own life
[55:26] I I cannot I can speak for myself here
[55:29] they can't even pray an hour you know
[55:31] and I notice the age of the spirit that
[55:33] we live in it it tries to get you to do
[55:35] everything else other than pray and read
[55:37] your Bible That's the age we're in right
[55:38] now and he goes truth
[55:41] uh lost my place who cry for an oblation
[55:44] that did in the city where you see that
[55:46] I can show you ten thousand and speak in
[55:48] tongues to one that really burdened for
[55:50] sin they can't even pray an hour
[55:53] but do you know the Bible said to Mark
[55:55] only those who sign and cry for the
[55:56] Abominations in the city how many have
[55:59] already sure that's what the Holy Spirit
[56:01] come forth to Mark people and said to
[56:04] this destroying Angel go forth and
[56:06] destroy everything that doesn't have the
[56:08] mark upon it the mark of God is the Holy
[56:11] Ghost and the Seal of God and I sure
[56:13] hope my desire this morning is to have
[56:16] that Mark on me but I'll just read a few
[56:19] of these scriptures this morning you
[56:21] know I was also looking at that
[56:23] scripture
[56:25] you know uh I was just I'm I'll stop
[56:28] there I was gonna say something but I'll
[56:30] just read what God's word has to say
[56:32] like I said what my opinion about
[56:34] anything doesn't mean anything it's what
[56:37] the prophet of the age says and what the
[56:39] God's word says that's the only thing
[56:41] that really you can have I could have an
[56:43] idea but that doesn't mean anything
[56:45] what what the word of God says that's
[56:47] the only idea we need to hold to and
[56:49] that's what a Believer will hold too is
[56:51] the word of God above all things whether
[56:54] your father will do it whether your
[56:56] mother will do it whether your wife will
[56:57] do whoever it is people you work with
[57:00] you'll hold to it no matter what
[57:01] pressure comes against you and I'll just
[57:04] read here
[57:05] and this 13th chapter let every soul be
[57:08] subject to the higher powers for there's
[57:10] no power but of God
[57:12] the powers that are ordained of God and
[57:14] you can take that scripture and run
[57:16] through the Bible and you'll know what
[57:17] it's talking about there I don't have
[57:19] time whoever therefore resists the power
[57:22] resists the ordinance of God they that
[57:24] resist them shall receive to themselves
[57:26] damnation
[57:28] for the rulers are not a charred to Good
[57:30] Works so if you've got the Holy Ghost
[57:32] and you're serving God when you know
[57:35] sometimes corrects when correction comes
[57:37] I got to raise my hand it's not always
[57:39] the easy thing to receive but it's good
[57:42] for your soul just like in that problem
[57:44] where we you know correct you it'll keep
[57:47] you straight on the way and it goes on
[57:48] for rulers are not Authority good works
[57:50] but the evil without them be afraid of
[57:53] the power to do that which is good then
[57:55] thou shall have Praise of the same
[57:57] for he's the minister of God to thee for
[58:00] good but if thou do that which is evil
[58:02] be afraid for he beareth not the sword
[58:04] in vain for he's a minister of God a
[58:07] Revengers to execute wrath upon them
[58:10] that that doeth evil and this is more
[58:12] for us now in our day and age this is
[58:15] really spiritual this morning
[58:18] wherefore you must need be subject not
[58:21] only for wrath but for also conscience
[58:23] sake for this cause pay ye tribute also
[58:27] for for their God's ministers attending
[58:29] continually upon the very things and I
[58:32] was I was just thinking this morning you
[58:34] know that's the thing about men
[58:37] you know everyone wants a opinion
[58:39] everyone wants to be able to tell
[58:41] everyone else what to do and where to be
[58:45] or whatever but actually the only thing
[58:47] that matters is what God is leading
[58:50] the church the Jew through the word of
[58:52] God that's my ideas I don't mean I know
[58:54] I've said this a lot this morning but my
[58:56] ideas my opinions they don't they don't
[58:59] mean anything the only thing that
[59:01] matters is what the prophet of the age
[59:03] that in the word of God says for us to
[59:05] do and I'll just finish reading rendered
[59:07] therefore to their views tribute to whom
[59:09] tribute is due accustomed to who custom
[59:11] Fear To whom fear honor to whomano oh no
[59:15] man anything but love one another for he
[59:17] that loveth another have fulfilled the
[59:19] law and that's what this age needs it
[59:21] there ain't very much love out there in
[59:23] the world
[59:24] I mean there's phony love I mean if you
[59:28] rub people just
[59:29] right they'll treat you right but soon
[59:31] as you say something they don't like
[59:33] then they're just like the cat for this
[59:35] Thou shalt not commit adultery thou
[59:37] shall not kill thou shall not steal thou
[59:39] shall not bear false living thy neighbor
[59:41] as thyself
[59:43] and love worketh no will to his
[59:45] neighbors therefore love is the
[59:47] fulfilling of the law and I know I need
[59:49] more of that in my life sometimes and
[59:51] and that knowing that the time that is
[59:54] now High time to awake out of sleep and
[59:57] that's really true for now is our
[59:59] Salvation there than we believe you know
[1:00:02] and by that quote come from 1965 we're
[1:00:05] in 2023 how much closer are we are I
[1:00:09] know people have said that for years
[1:00:10] we're closer today than we were tomorrow
[1:00:12] and then as you live your life you're 40
[1:00:15] years further down the road but it
[1:00:17] doesn't change the truth of that fact
[1:00:19] that we're closer today than we were
[1:00:21] yesterday and you don't want to be
[1:00:23] slothful and he goes on to say the night
[1:00:25] is far spent day is at hand let us
[1:00:28] therefore cast off the works of darkness
[1:00:30] and let us put on the on the armor of
[1:00:33] light let us walk honestly as in the day
[1:00:35] not in rioting and drunkenness not in
[1:00:38] clamoring not wanting us not in strife
[1:00:40] and envying and that's that last
[1:00:42] sentence it's right there pastor.com and
[1:00:45] that's the age we're in it's trying to
[1:00:47] make you be at Strife make you envy it's
[1:00:51] that's its sole purpose to get you off
[1:00:52] the word of God and and this last verse
[1:00:55] here the 14th verse but put ye on Jesus
[1:00:59] the Lord Jesus Christ make no brush and
[1:01:02] fulfill
[1:01:04] the Lost thereof and then it goes
[1:01:07] further down but I would just say this
[1:01:09] morning that for myself like I said I
[1:01:11] can only speak for myself
[1:01:15] I'd want this pure in his word this
[1:01:17] morning
[1:01:18] he doesn't want any doubt in us we don't
[1:01:21] want any doubt or anything in our hearts
[1:01:23] and lives and the only way I've ever
[1:01:25] found to keep all that out
[1:01:27] is to stay with the word of God this
[1:01:29] morning brother
[1:01:32] not to say brother Dave but Brother John
[1:01:46] stand this morning

[1:30:47] Sunday morning Saturday night at six
[1:30:49] o'clock amen so we're looking forward to
[1:30:51] having brother Andrew here we haven't
[1:30:53] had him for a while amen
[1:30:55] all right Proverbs one
[1:30:58] amen you know before I start you know we
[1:31:02] love to preach to the bride of Christ we
[1:31:04] love to preach to believers but
[1:31:06] sometimes we also preach to the
[1:31:08] unbelievers amen
[1:31:10] and so this here kind of is centered
[1:31:13] towards preaching to a non-believer
[1:31:16] not orders in probably
[1:31:18] verse 1 and verse 23 3 it says turn you
[1:31:22] at my reproof behold I will pour out my
[1:31:25] spirit unto you I will make known my
[1:31:27] words unto you because I called and you
[1:31:30] refused I stretched I have stretched out
[1:31:33] my hand and no man regarded but you have
[1:31:36] said it not all my counsel and with none
[1:31:39] of my reproof I also will laugh at your
[1:31:42] Calamity I will mock when your fear
[1:31:43] cometh
[1:31:44] and when you fear cometh that's
[1:31:46] desolation I mean yeah desolation and
[1:31:49] your destruction cometh as a whirlwind
[1:31:52] when distress and anguish cometh upon
[1:31:55] you then shall they call upon me but I
[1:31:58] will not answer they shall seek me early
[1:32:01] but they shall not find me
[1:32:03] for they that hate for that they hated
[1:32:05] knowledge and did not choose the fear of
[1:32:08] the Lord they would none of my counsel
[1:32:10] to despise all my reproof therefore
[1:32:13] shall they eat of their fruit of their
[1:32:14] own way and to be filled with their own
[1:32:17] devices may God add His blessings to the
[1:32:19] reading of the word you can be seated
[1:32:22] amen I felt like there was just a real
[1:32:24] simple thought that the Lord laid on my
[1:32:26] heart I mean kind of quickened it to me
[1:32:28] this week Eminem as I was working as I
[1:32:31] was doing different things and and it
[1:32:33] came to me
[1:32:34] amen about the Power of Choice the power
[1:32:39] of choice amen
[1:32:42] praise the Lord
[1:32:43] amen and so it is of course something
[1:32:46] that we've heard a lot before but if
[1:32:49] you'll notice here that it says that
[1:32:51] they did not choose the fear of the Lord
[1:32:56] and I think in this scripture we find
[1:32:58] that there was a uh a lot of it he's
[1:33:02] talking about that they wouldn't isn't
[1:33:05] that right I called but he refused I
[1:33:08] stretched out my hand and none regarded
[1:33:11] it
[1:33:12] amen there's a lot of things actually
[1:33:14] that when we talk about choice of course
[1:33:16] when we know talk about toys we know
[1:33:18] that we're talking about something that
[1:33:20] God planned a day upon and that's free
[1:33:23] moral agency
[1:33:26] free moral agency
[1:33:28] the ability to choose
[1:33:31] and then you know I was just thinking
[1:33:34] about I was thinking about that you know
[1:33:35] because think about it if you if if you
[1:33:38] could only go One Direction in no other
[1:33:40] direction you would have no choice
[1:33:43] that right but choice
[1:33:46] choice is the ability to go in a
[1:33:50] different direction
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:55] it's the ability to go into a different
[1:33:58] direction it's like the steering wheel
[1:34:00] on a car
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:03] choice and now I want you to know we
[1:34:05] want to talk about it or not on on a
[1:34:09] small scale where there's just two
[1:34:10] choices then we want to also talk about
[1:34:13] how that we have multiple choices amen
[1:34:17] and and it's just like having a steer
[1:34:19] the choice is like a steering wheel
[1:34:22] whichever way you choose that's the way
[1:34:25] it goes
[1:34:26] whether you end up in a ditch or whether
[1:34:28] you stay on the road or whether you get
[1:34:30] over any other one's lane or whether you
[1:34:32] kind of keep a straight line it's
[1:34:35] totally by what you choose is the
[1:34:37] direction that you're gonna go amen it
[1:34:40] gives you your direction Choice does
[1:34:43] amen now this is a step down from
[1:34:46] predestination for the nation it is a
[1:34:48] step down from the revelation of uh uh
[1:34:51] the seed being in you and so forth
[1:34:53] because I want to try to bring in uh a
[1:34:56] few different thoughts amen with the
[1:34:57] help of the lord we want to just really
[1:34:58] dwell on choice because I want you to
[1:35:00] know that every day we don't realize
[1:35:02] that every day
[1:35:04] you make thousands of choices
[1:35:08] you make thousands of choices every day
[1:35:11] amen right from the time you get up and
[1:35:14] on but I want to first talk about I want
[1:35:16] to first talk about perhaps and I wanted
[1:35:18] to call this good choices and bad
[1:35:22] choices
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:25] amen and we know through the prophet of
[1:35:27] God that that in heaven the first place
[1:35:30] that if we ever found free moral agency
[1:35:33] or that we found the ability to choose
[1:35:36] was in heaven
[1:35:39] in heaven was the first place that they
[1:35:42] had the ability to choose
[1:35:48] amen and I'm just going to throw
[1:35:51] something out there kind of a a
[1:35:53] presumption if that's okay if the
[1:35:56] question I should I put it this way it
[1:35:58] begs the question that when we get over
[1:36:01] there will we still be on free moral
[1:36:03] agency will there still be free moral
[1:36:05] agency
[1:36:07] question just a question I I don't know
[1:36:12] but I do know the first place they did
[1:36:14] have a choice was in heaven
[1:36:16] and the first bad real bad choice that
[1:36:21] was made was made in heaven
[1:36:28] now notice in Isaiah 14 and verse 12 it
[1:36:31] says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh
[1:36:33] Lucifer son of the morning how about
[1:36:35] that cut down to the ground which did
[1:36:37] streak in the Nations for thou has said
[1:36:40] in thy heart now how may know Satan one
[1:36:42] time was God's right-hand man so to
[1:36:45] speak he was right there with God
[1:36:48] himself
[1:36:50] and it's hard to imagine but this guy
[1:36:52] here this is what he said in his heart I
[1:36:54] said in thy heart I will Ascend into
[1:36:57] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[1:37:00] stars of God
[1:37:02] do you see the stars
[1:37:04] the god
[1:37:06] Revelations of first three chapter God
[1:37:08] has seven stars and he's right in that
[1:37:11] he used for the last seven or two
[1:37:13] thousand years Martin Luther John Wesley
[1:37:15] Paul irenius and so forth and Samara he
[1:37:18] was going to exalt his throne above
[1:37:21] God's Messengers or God's Stars above
[1:37:24] the stars of God anything they teach you
[1:37:27] whatever is going to be on the word of
[1:37:28] God and he wants to get people to do
[1:37:31] something different than What God Says
[1:37:34] isn't that right so the devil and I also
[1:37:37] beg the question sometimes I wonder
[1:37:39] sometimes if the devil regrets his
[1:37:41] decision
[1:37:45] there's one thing we do know that he is
[1:37:47] a miserable creature
[1:37:50] he is miserable and misery loves company
[1:37:53] that's why he tries to get this many to
[1:37:56] go with him as he possibly can because
[1:37:57] misery loves company and I want you to
[1:38:00] know he can just stay in his little
[1:38:01] corner I have no interest in being
[1:38:04] miserable with the devil and these poor
[1:38:06] choices
[1:38:10] very bad vision
[1:38:13] can we say something else not only did
[1:38:15] he make it a bad choice but a third of
[1:38:19] the Angels me the bad choice
[1:38:23] the first place that there was gossip in
[1:38:25] the church was in heaven
[1:38:28] he whispered his little secrets and his
[1:38:30] lies and and his this that's the first
[1:38:32] place there was a discontent was in
[1:38:36] heaven
[1:38:38] he wasn't contented he wanted he wanted
[1:38:41] to be like God
[1:38:43] second Thessalonians he wanted to be
[1:38:45] like God he will represent himself as
[1:38:48] God isn't that right because he wanted
[1:38:50] to be a god
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:55] and he took two-thirds he preached this
[1:38:57] gospel his discontent his gossip let me
[1:39:00] tell you something that's why you got to
[1:39:02] be careful who you listen to
[1:39:05] how many how that's why God hates
[1:39:08] discontent what does this content the
[1:39:10] first place that there was murmuring was
[1:39:13] in heaven
[1:39:15] well we don't like the way things are
[1:39:17] here
[1:39:20] better watch that word
[1:39:24] don't like the way things are here
[1:39:26] the devil didn't like the way things
[1:39:27] were there
[1:39:29] two-thirds of the Angels didn't like how
[1:39:31] things were
[1:39:34] and they took sides with the Devil
[1:39:38] isn't that right to think that that was
[1:39:40] that many
[1:39:46] don't you want to shake the Angel's
[1:39:47] hands when you get over to heaven the
[1:39:50] ones that did make the right choice
[1:39:53] the ones that said nah you just take
[1:39:56] your gossiping self and get away from me
[1:39:58] you just take your bright ideas and get
[1:40:01] away from me I'm happy where I'm at
[1:40:03] that one right there that's gone that
[1:40:05] way like that's God you're not God
[1:40:11] two-thirds of them stayed with God
[1:40:15] why do you think God puts you on me on
[1:40:17] female agency
[1:40:19] you don't like to just drive you to
[1:40:21] stuff and push you to stop even though
[1:40:22] sometimes he does
[1:40:24] but he wants you to make a choice based
[1:40:27] on what you want to do
[1:40:28] [Applause]
[1:40:31] God loves good choices
[1:40:36] I hate bad choices
[1:40:43] amen we've all made them
[1:40:47] too many
[1:40:48] amen so I got on here trying to express
[1:40:51] it in one of these days I'll get
[1:40:52] together on this be able to put this up
[1:40:55] on the board again but this is uh I put
[1:40:58] a why like a y
[1:41:01] it didn't sound like this why here all
[1:41:03] right
[1:41:05] it represents right here I got in the
[1:41:08] middle a crossroad
[1:41:10] all right and for two thousand four
[1:41:13] thousand years for four thousand years
[1:41:15] this straight line man didn't really
[1:41:18] have a choice
[1:41:20] foreign
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:26] when it came to uh not uh to be free
[1:41:30] from sin
[1:41:32] is that right
[1:41:33] whether it was David whether it's
[1:41:35] Solomon they had that first nature and
[1:41:37] they couldn't get away from it
[1:41:40] in other words that they didn't have a
[1:41:43] different way they could go all they had
[1:41:45] was a substitute of killing goats and
[1:41:47] sheep and so forth that God would cover
[1:41:49] their sin and forgive them but their
[1:41:51] nature would never be changed
[1:41:54] no matter how much they wanted to be
[1:41:56] spiritual David or whatever you still
[1:41:58] end up messing up with special Sheba
[1:42:00] why do you think that if somebody that
[1:42:02] claims to be a Christian it isn't really
[1:42:03] born again you're still gonna mess up
[1:42:08] but it's like this wine for 4 000 years
[1:42:11] I want to say there's a lot of things
[1:42:12] that we don't have a choice in
[1:42:17] amen
[1:42:18] like our birth being born you really
[1:42:20] didn't have a choice did you I mean
[1:42:22] those kids nowadays are suing their
[1:42:24] parents because they didn't ask to be
[1:42:26] here
[1:42:28] now I gotta have a job now I gotta get
[1:42:31] up in the morning
[1:42:33] now I got a pay rent you put all this
[1:42:35] struggle on me
[1:42:38] huh
[1:42:40] don't work that way does it no he didn't
[1:42:42] have a choice in that matter but one
[1:42:44] thing's for sure you have to make some
[1:42:46] decisions now
[1:42:48] as a human being you're forced to make a
[1:42:50] decision
[1:42:52] you got to make a decision when the
[1:42:54] supernatural is done when the gospels
[1:42:56] preached to you
[1:42:58] folks you'll be making decisions right
[1:43:00] here this morning as you hear the word
[1:43:02] you're gonna have to decide whether you
[1:43:04] believe it or whether you don't
[1:43:08] I'm here to tell you there's absolutely
[1:43:11] uh
[1:43:12] it is unlimited to what you could do if
[1:43:16] you would just accepting believe it and
[1:43:18] choose to believe
[1:43:22] if you can choose to believe the Bible
[1:43:24] says
[1:43:26] we thought we've got nothing shall be
[1:43:28] impossible
[1:43:30] all things are possible to them that
[1:43:32] believe
[1:43:37] you see that was after the crossroad you
[1:43:39] couldn't say that before but now that
[1:43:41] we've reached the why we've reached the
[1:43:43] crossroad because that's what all
[1:43:45] decisions are they are at a Crossroads
[1:43:49] a decision is because you got to go this
[1:43:51] way or you got to go that way you gotta
[1:43:53] act like this or you gotta act like that
[1:43:56] you gotta think like this or you gotta
[1:43:58] think like that
[1:44:00] every thought that comes in your mind
[1:44:01] you have to decide whether you want to
[1:44:03] think that's odds or whether you want to
[1:44:04] cast that thought out
[1:44:09] when the cross came we came to a
[1:44:12] Crossroads
[1:44:14] things were gonna be different now you
[1:44:16] have a choice but whether you want to be
[1:44:19] a sinner or not now you have a choice of
[1:44:22] whether you want to be guilty or whether
[1:44:24] you want to be natural and carnal and
[1:44:26] amen hateful and mean and everything
[1:44:28] else you got a choice now
[1:44:32] man that's one of the greatest things
[1:44:35] that we can have this choice
[1:44:37] because if I didn't have a choice you'd
[1:44:39] have to go in whatever Direction you're
[1:44:41] going
[1:44:42] but you got the choice
[1:44:46] any look I'm telling you young people
[1:44:48] it'll make your whole world
[1:44:51] your whole world is going to be created
[1:44:53] by the choices that you make
[1:44:58] you're sitting here this morning because
[1:45:00] you made a chore but
[1:45:03] said I'm going to go to church this
[1:45:04] morning
[1:45:05] you're sitting
[1:45:07] because you decided hey this is where I
[1:45:09] want to miss it we make choices all the
[1:45:11] time
[1:45:14] now who knows how hard you had to fight
[1:45:17] whether you was going to go to church or
[1:45:18] not
[1:45:20] huh
[1:45:21] isn't that right we're filled with
[1:45:23] choices
[1:45:25] but praise be to God
[1:45:27] now notice how many knows in the Old
[1:45:30] Testament without the cross of Calvary
[1:45:32] we all kept going on the same road that
[1:45:36] we were on when we really didn't have a
[1:45:38] choice
[1:45:39] and that straight road that Broad Road
[1:45:42] keeps going right straight if you keep
[1:45:43] going straight that way and you don't
[1:45:45] bear off of that road you're gonna end
[1:45:47] up I rode up in here this road leads to
[1:45:49] hell
[1:45:50] it leads to destruction
[1:45:52] it leads to Everlasting punishment in
[1:45:56] the separation from the presence of
[1:45:57] almighty God
[1:46:01] it going straight
[1:46:04] I mean
[1:46:07] you got to make a change
[1:46:11] oh
[1:46:13] oh
[1:46:15] when I thought about the car hey you
[1:46:17] know what I can sit here and I could
[1:46:18] have a bad attitude I can be depressed
[1:46:20] or I can decide I'm not gonna be
[1:46:24] thank God that you have the ability to
[1:46:26] say I'm not gonna be
[1:46:30] my
[1:46:34] praise be to God let's talk more about
[1:46:36] bad choices people that made bad choices
[1:46:39] and they're people that make good
[1:46:40] choices
[1:46:41] people that made bad choices and that
[1:46:43] could actually be redeemed from those
[1:46:45] bad choices people who make bad choices
[1:46:47] and never was redeemed for making those
[1:46:50] choices
[1:46:51] I'll just say this right off the go get
[1:46:53] real quick like as long as you're in
[1:46:55] this world
[1:46:56] you have a choice
[1:46:58] but that when you take that last breath
[1:47:00] all that choice stuff's over
[1:47:03] there's no more Choice over on the other
[1:47:04] side you are what you are
[1:47:07] amen
[1:47:09] on this side and on that side you'll
[1:47:12] already judged on what you did with what
[1:47:15] God gave you
[1:47:16] amen
[1:47:19] see
[1:47:21] we want to talk a little more about the
[1:47:23] cross but see Jesus when he said he says
[1:47:24] whosoever will
[1:47:26] let him come
[1:47:27] who knows that
[1:47:29] at the Garden in the Garden of Eden they
[1:47:32] were turned out and says don't you come
[1:47:34] back get out of the garden don't you
[1:47:36] take up the tree of life and live
[1:47:37] forever they were refused they couldn't
[1:47:39] come take up that tree but when Jesus
[1:47:41] come along he says whosoever will let
[1:47:43] him come honey believe that that same
[1:47:45] spirit is still calling the people calm
[1:47:49] all you who are weary and heavy ladies
[1:47:52] that you want to come
[1:47:59] aren't you bad that you can make that
[1:48:01] choice to come that oh my just a simple
[1:48:04] preacher Italian in the Bible can
[1:48:07] determine where you'll spend eternity
[1:48:12] just a simple choice
[1:48:14] amen
[1:48:17] notice how he puts it on us
[1:48:19] God puts it on Humanity
[1:48:22] don't he
[1:48:23] because we know when he said it was
[1:48:24] finished
[1:48:26] at Calvary it was all done he had done
[1:48:28] his part now it's your turn
[1:48:31] now it's my turn
[1:48:37] did not choose to fear of the Lord well
[1:48:39] let me tell you something I mean those
[1:48:40] there are people who do Choose
[1:48:43] You know what I like about choosing
[1:48:46] Christ because I chose Christ
[1:48:50] that's what I remember I want to choose
[1:48:53] you God I choose you dumb take my heart
[1:48:55] take my life amen I realize that I chose
[1:48:58] him because he chose me
[1:49:01] before I chose him he had chosen me
[1:49:04] because he knew what I would do
[1:49:08] he knew what everybody would do that's
[1:49:11] how he could write people's name on the
[1:49:12] book before the foundation of the world
[1:49:13] because you knew what everybody would do
[1:49:15] he knew what they would do what their
[1:49:17] choice would be
[1:49:20] oh my
[1:49:22] aren't you glad
[1:49:24] that should cause us to almost have us a
[1:49:27] run thing fit
[1:49:30] to think that you're you want what God
[1:49:32] wants you want everything
[1:49:33] yes for you
[1:49:35] you choose him it shows you that he
[1:49:38] chose you
[1:49:39] because even Jesus says you've not
[1:49:40] chosen me I've chosen you
[1:49:42] praise be to God
[1:49:44] oh my
[1:49:47] God no that was the first place was in
[1:49:49] heaven murmuring complaining discontent
[1:49:52] division
[1:49:54] first in heaven that stress of division
[1:49:56] was first in heaven
[1:50:00] because Satan chose the wrong path the
[1:50:03] angel chose the wrong path they chose
[1:50:06] the wrong thing
[1:50:07] listen to the wrong thing
[1:50:10] amen the next time that we hear of this
[1:50:13] what's an Eden
[1:50:15] right
[1:50:17] Eve made a bad choice
[1:50:22] she really did
[1:50:24] and plunged us into heaven getting old
[1:50:28] having to get sick having to have
[1:50:30] funerals all the hospitals every
[1:50:33] ambulance every dead animal on the road
[1:50:35] everything was caused because Eve made a
[1:50:39] bad choice
[1:50:42] what is it that church Eve chose to do
[1:50:48] Eve chose to open up her mind
[1:50:53] she had to make a choice
[1:50:58] I've concluded that before you can get
[1:51:00] mad before you can have a temper before
[1:51:02] you can uh fuss before any adult thinks
[1:51:05] you have to choose that that's what
[1:51:06] you're going to do
[1:51:07] you come right up to it and say well I'm
[1:51:09] about to lose it
[1:51:12] and then you can either let go or you
[1:51:15] can say no that ain't gonna happen here
[1:51:20] first it has to happen in the minds
[1:51:23] and he had to open up the womb of her
[1:51:25] mind too well maybe he's right
[1:51:28] she should have never thought that she
[1:51:31] should have cut that thought out slapped
[1:51:33] him in the face good and large and said
[1:51:35] get away from me serpenters
[1:51:38] you're the most subtle Beast to the
[1:51:41] field you're a beast of the field you
[1:51:42] ain't no snake
[1:51:43] good looking no doubt handsome and all
[1:51:45] of that
[1:51:47] she said get away from me you're lying
[1:51:49] trying to give me this food off of the
[1:51:51] tree of knowledge of good and even
[1:51:52] telling me that I'm going to be like
[1:51:54] God's knowing good and evil God told me
[1:51:57] to stay away from you not even to touch
[1:51:59] you
[1:52:00] huh
[1:52:02] but you made a bad choice and where did
[1:52:04] it bring it into death isn't that right
[1:52:08] my bad choice that it was given
[1:52:11] amen and for four thousand years we've
[1:52:14] had
[1:52:16] to deal with that
[1:52:18] but thanks be to God
[1:52:20] amen
[1:52:23] that God chose to come
[1:52:26] and to redeem us and to pay the price at
[1:52:28] Calvary
[1:52:29] for our sins
[1:52:31] amen so that you wouldn't have to be
[1:52:33] under the bondage
[1:52:35] of guilt
[1:52:38] uh aren't you glad that you don't have
[1:52:40] to feel guilty anymore
[1:52:43] you can know that your heart is right
[1:52:45] and all sins are under the blood of
[1:52:47] Jesus Christ
[1:52:51] my my my
[1:52:54] praise be to God
[1:52:57] no coming back for the devil and his
[1:52:59] angels is there not even a hope
[1:53:02] no hope for him all those uh that he
[1:53:05] went that Jesus went to preaching the
[1:53:07] souls in prison amen he went down in the
[1:53:10] regions of the Lost in the days of Noah
[1:53:12] and all of them
[1:53:13] there was no hope he told him I am the
[1:53:15] one
[1:53:16] that he said that was to come and you
[1:53:18] didn't believe it
[1:53:20] believe us but I'm here
[1:53:21] but there's no hope for him
[1:53:24] I think that's what's going to make hell
[1:53:25] hell that's what's going to be so bad
[1:53:27] for her to regions of the laws is there
[1:53:29] is no hope
[1:53:31] amen no chance not even a chance of you
[1:53:34] getting out of it
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:40] I mean those choices are privilege why
[1:53:42] do you think everybody wants to come to
[1:53:44] America you can choose what you want to
[1:53:45] do
[1:53:46] work and there's so much privilege here
[1:53:49] amen
[1:53:52] praise the Lord
[1:53:54] let's talk about David let's talk about
[1:53:57] a little bit uh actually let's talk
[1:53:59] about redeemable bad choices redeemable
[1:54:02] bad choices
[1:54:04] and I believe God's children we as God's
[1:54:07] children
[1:54:08] sometimes
[1:54:09] bad choices
[1:54:12] choose the wrong thing go the wrong path
[1:54:17] answer was an example of a man who could
[1:54:20] say a thousand Philistines and have all
[1:54:22] of the all of Israel platform oh that's
[1:54:25] our Samson our deliverer
[1:54:27] isn't that right
[1:54:31] and he was
[1:54:33] pretty smart for a good long while
[1:54:36] he would never tell Delilah the true
[1:54:38] Secret
[1:54:40] I mean those as long as he didn't tell
[1:54:42] her really what it was he could get up
[1:54:45] and tear those chains and whatever it is
[1:54:48] and keep on slaying them
[1:54:50] they couldn't do anything as long as
[1:54:52] they didn't do that
[1:54:54] but one day he opened up his mind
[1:54:56] because Delilah said it just that way
[1:55:00] well you don't love me
[1:55:02] honey you don't love me if you really
[1:55:05] love me
[1:55:06] huh
[1:55:12] is that slicker
[1:55:14] and God did you do you open his mouth
[1:55:15] okay all right
[1:55:17] amen and he made a big mistake
[1:55:20] he chose to tell her and he told her
[1:55:23] and guess what he ended up being in the
[1:55:26] pit of despair in the grinding wheel his
[1:55:28] eyes gouged out serving his Enemy being
[1:55:32] made fun of and he was at that grinding
[1:55:34] wheel of grinding and he was backsliding
[1:55:36] he was away from God and oh my the
[1:55:38] consequences of his mistake
[1:55:41] was unparable
[1:55:43] isn't that right
[1:55:45] but there was Redemption for him because
[1:55:47] his hair grew back
[1:55:49] he could feel the locks and he said just
[1:55:50] once more Lord let me feel it again just
[1:55:53] once more and he killed more on that day
[1:55:55] the big shots and the big up and ups and
[1:55:58] the whole clan hey man he got a hold of
[1:56:00] those pillars
[1:56:01] somebody showed me the video that's
[1:56:03] something I want to see them big old
[1:56:05] face crack
[1:56:07] almighty God come back on him how many
[1:56:09] batteries you as a child of God you
[1:56:11] might get away from God you might not
[1:56:12] you might make a bad decision but
[1:56:15] God is the only one that can get you out
[1:56:17] of it
[1:56:21] I'm thankful for that aren't you
[1:56:25] but he paid dearly I want you to
[1:56:27] understand something every time you make
[1:56:29] a bad decision you pay for it dearly
[1:56:37] maybe if I have time I want to talk to
[1:56:39] you about
[1:56:40] that we ought to do like Moses said he
[1:56:43] chose by faith of Moses
[1:56:45] amen chose not to be called Pharaoh's
[1:56:49] son
[1:56:50] choosing rather to accept the
[1:56:51] afflictions of Israel than to enjoy the
[1:56:54] pleasures of sin first season he chose
[1:56:56] by faith
[1:56:59] Faith be to God now just say this if I
[1:57:01] don't
[1:57:02] when you make a choice by faith it's
[1:57:04] always good
[1:57:06] by faith that's why you got to get down
[1:57:08] on your knees and say Lord what do you
[1:57:09] want me to do here
[1:57:10] what do you want not what I want
[1:57:13] every time let me kind of say something
[1:57:14] every time you make up she's
[1:57:17] decision on your carnality and flesh
[1:57:19] it's always a bad choice
[1:57:22] folks you don't never want to be led by
[1:57:24] your flesh
[1:57:25] you will lose every time
[1:57:31] amen
[1:57:33] David it was another one
[1:57:34] man after
[1:57:38] he saw Bathsheba and he opened up his
[1:57:41] mind hey
[1:57:42] you know what I'd like to have this girl
[1:57:45] I want this girl right there he made his
[1:57:47] mistake
[1:57:48] when he allowed that thought to come in
[1:57:50] he didn't have the power to turn his
[1:57:52] head and say it huh somebody go down
[1:57:54] there into the house down below my
[1:57:56] kingdom and tell Bathsheba not to bathe
[1:57:59] in the public not the base where I can
[1:58:01] see her all right
[1:58:02] make sure you have curtains as you're in
[1:58:04] private and in secret amen
[1:58:06] corrected or that would have been good
[1:58:09] the story would have been a lot
[1:58:11] different for David Absalom wouldn't
[1:58:13] have got killed
[1:58:14] oh he wouldn't have been running for his
[1:58:16] life and that oh my all kinds of chaotic
[1:58:19] mess that came because she disobeyed
[1:58:21] because he made the wrong choice
[1:58:25] amen
[1:58:26] his firstborn of of Bathsheba died amen
[1:58:31] no matter how much he cried and wept
[1:58:34] you have to wonder how much he really
[1:58:36] meant it
[1:58:37] because the second that he heard that he
[1:58:38] was dead he got up and cleaned himself
[1:58:40] up and he was done crying
[1:58:42] they asked him well why are you stopping
[1:58:44] crying now he says well while he was
[1:58:46] still living there was hope now it's
[1:58:47] dead now there's no hope
[1:58:50] well anyway but God had told him it
[1:58:53] would die isn't that right God don't
[1:58:55] change his mind how many of those
[1:58:57] choices are very powerful
[1:59:01] we talk about the power the spirit the
[1:59:03] power to all kinds of power but let me
[1:59:04] tell you something
[1:59:06] choice is one of the most powerful
[1:59:08] things there is in the universe
[1:59:10] amen it will determine your Eternal
[1:59:12] destination sure God chose you but you
[1:59:15] still have to make that choice of
[1:59:16] whether you're going to believe what he
[1:59:17] did on Kev on for you on Calvary
[1:59:20] you still have to believe whether you
[1:59:21] believe the truth or not
[1:59:23] you have to make a choice it's all a
[1:59:25] choice
[1:59:26] amen
[1:59:28] praise the Lord
[1:59:29] the Rich Young Ruler
[1:59:31] he made a bad choice didn't he
[1:59:34] amen he chose not to sell all that he
[1:59:36] had but ma'am said later in life you
[1:59:38] find hey man he found his soul down in
[1:59:40] Hell amen he called Abraham common hurt
[1:59:43] me let somebody bring a touch of water
[1:59:46] like that song says now a strip drop of
[1:59:51] water is all he'll ever need amen bad
[1:59:55] choice
[1:59:55] Choice stop forever in that place
[1:59:59] cause he made it bad choice
[2:00:01] the Pharisees I mean the Pharisees
[2:00:03] didn't mean about that the Jews they
[2:00:05] were forced to make a decision
[2:00:08] God has made himself folks that all of
[2:00:11] humanity is forced to make a decision
[2:00:13] you've got to decide what you're going
[2:00:14] to do with the word of God
[2:00:17] you must
[2:00:18] you must decide where you're going to
[2:00:21] spend eternity
[2:00:26] and let me let me tell you something on
[2:00:27] the small scale
[2:00:30] there's really when it comes to your
[2:00:32] destination there's only two choices
[2:00:34] only two places
[2:00:37] not a bunch that's not purgatory and
[2:00:39] this that or the other over here to the
[2:00:41] left you gotta Veer off
[2:00:43] another path that leads to destruction
[2:00:46] the one they had been going on for a
[2:00:48] long time and you got to get over here
[2:00:49] on Heaven's Highway
[2:00:51] amen you better get off that road
[2:00:54] amen only two Jesus said no man can
[2:00:58] serve two masters
[2:01:01] two masters either God or the devil that
[2:01:03] you'll serve one of them
[2:01:06] no glory aren't you glad this morning
[2:01:09] that you're not serving the devil that
[2:01:11] you're serving God God and you know
[2:01:13] you're serving God
[2:01:16] you want to do without which pleases the
[2:01:18] father
[2:01:20] amen
[2:01:21] you ought to be happy
[2:01:24] we ought to be happy
[2:01:26] Hallelujah
[2:01:30] all right let's talk about
[2:01:32] other
[2:01:34] other choices that are made sometimes
[2:01:38] we have to make choices
[2:01:41] when we're
[2:01:43] in the middle of things that we did not
[2:01:45] choose
[2:01:47] there's things that God allows to come
[2:01:49] on you
[2:01:50] that you have no power you know no power
[2:01:54] over it like job
[2:01:57] joke didn't bring that upon himself
[2:01:59] because he made a bad choice
[2:02:02] God allowed it to come upon job isn't
[2:02:04] that right
[2:02:05] he allowed it to come upon Joe but he
[2:02:07] got all the way down to where he was
[2:02:08] just all of the most miserable creature
[2:02:10] lost all of his finances and everything
[2:02:13] else and now he lost his health
[2:02:16] and he was so miserable until any one of
[2:02:19] them would have said man he would be
[2:02:20] better off dead
[2:02:24] like we say sometimes of our loved ones
[2:02:26] well there at least their suffering is
[2:02:28] over
[2:02:29] and his own wife come to him and says
[2:02:31] man why don't you just Curse God and die
[2:02:32] because that was the challenge that the
[2:02:34] devil had made to God
[2:02:36] first place he says you know you know
[2:02:38] he'll curse you to your face he'll curse
[2:02:41] you if you do this or that or the other
[2:02:42] he says no he won't
[2:02:44] go ahead and do what you want
[2:02:46] he come right down into that hard place
[2:02:49] that really hard
[2:02:50] he wipes it
[2:02:54] and job had to make a decision
[2:02:57] huh
[2:02:58] is she right do I listen to her
[2:03:00] what do I do
[2:03:05] I want to make a statement that is God
[2:03:07] forces these these things Upon Us makes
[2:03:11] us make a decision he said the prophet
[2:03:13] of God said is to show what's inside of
[2:03:16] you
[2:03:18] to show what's down in there
[2:03:23] I want to talk about what's down in
[2:03:24] there in a little bit
[2:03:26] but what's really down in there job said
[2:03:29] don't have to think about that too long
[2:03:32] you speak like a foolish man woman feel
[2:03:35] his man foolish woman the Lord
[2:03:39] the Lord taken away blessed be the damn
[2:03:41] it loud
[2:03:43] he worshiped him
[2:03:45] he made a choice to do it
[2:03:49] folks I'm here to tell you whether
[2:03:50] you're happy or whether you're sad
[2:03:53] it's all up to you
[2:03:55] whether you're saved or whether you're
[2:03:57] lost it's all up to you
[2:03:58] it's your choice what do you want
[2:04:01] you're on a free moral agency and God
[2:04:03] loves free more agency
[2:04:05] brother Brandon if you all remember he
[2:04:07] come down God took his wife took his
[2:04:09] child he wasn't understanding he come
[2:04:11] right down to it he said so you know if
[2:04:13] God's going to be like that the devil
[2:04:14] was trying to tell him God don't love
[2:04:16] you
[2:04:17] and if he's going to be like that and
[2:04:18] then thoughts were coming and they had
[2:04:20] to make a choice
[2:04:22] and no I rebuke that thoughts and I
[2:04:24] believe that God has given God takes
[2:04:27] away blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:04:30] I'm glad that us as Christians amen we
[2:04:32] love God so much that we can say even
[2:04:35] though he kills me
[2:04:38] I'll still love him
[2:04:41] though he slay me yet I'll trust him
[2:04:48] yeah that's right folks he's that good
[2:04:53] God is that good that even though he
[2:04:55] kills you
[2:04:57] you love him anyway
[2:05:00] 68 million Christians down through the
[2:05:03] Dark Ages because of Catholicism gave
[2:05:05] their lives they were burnt they were
[2:05:07] fed to Lions God allowed it
[2:05:10] amen
[2:05:11] they didn't mind dying for him even
[2:05:14] Jesus said Don't Fear the man that can
[2:05:16] kill your body
[2:05:18] but fear him that can destroy both body
[2:05:20] and soul in hell
[2:05:23] aren't you glad you chose the fear of
[2:05:25] the Lord
[2:05:26] you have to choose the fear of the Lord
[2:05:29] we humans I'll tell you what we make a
[2:05:31] lot of choices based on on uh
[2:05:36] survival
[2:05:38] circumstances come and we'll make this
[2:05:40] choice that choice in order to survive
[2:05:42] keep going man
[2:05:44] but God doesn't always want us to be it
[2:05:46] that way he wants you to make a choice
[2:05:48] like the Rich Young Ruler was he had
[2:05:50] everything he needed he wasn't hurting
[2:05:51] for nothing he just wanted eternal life
[2:05:54] and Jesus gave him the option just do
[2:05:56] this here and you'll have it
[2:05:59] and I guarantee you he is
[2:06:01] he's regretting it we know how he feels
[2:06:04] about it isn't that right
[2:06:05] we don't know whether the devil's
[2:06:07] regretting or not but we know that rich
[2:06:08] young ruler in Hell lifted up his eyes
[2:06:10] and he says can't get to somebody go
[2:06:12] tell my brothers
[2:06:14] this man got concerned in those realms
[2:06:18] he got concerned that he's about he's
[2:06:20] got to come there
[2:06:23] I always thought that's a perfect story
[2:06:25] for all of humanity look at what the
[2:06:28] Bible said
[2:06:29] and he's and Abraham says no they have
[2:06:32] the law all the prophets
[2:06:34] he says because they I believe it was
[2:06:36] him that Abraham said you know even
[2:06:38] though one would raise from the dead
[2:06:40] they still wouldn't believe
[2:06:43] because if they don't if you don't
[2:06:44] believe the Bible if you don't believe
[2:06:46] this story you just don't believe
[2:06:50] amen I don't know about you but I take
[2:06:53] that story to Heart
[2:06:54] I don't want to wait till I get down to
[2:06:56] the regions of losses hey maybe I should
[2:06:58] have done that this is your chance
[2:07:00] you still got plenty of money
[2:07:02] everything's still going good
[2:07:04] it won't be long and they'll put the
[2:07:06] squeeze on you on that money
[2:07:08] you won't buy or sell unless you belong
[2:07:10] to that left and all that wicked stuff
[2:07:14] hello
[2:07:15] but I want to make my choice this
[2:07:17] morning now Lord I want to serve you
[2:07:18] with all my heart
[2:07:20] you don't have to bring me to
[2:07:21] desperation you don't have to put me on
[2:07:23] the hospital before I begin to say God
[2:07:25] Amen bring me to a closer walk with you
[2:07:28] oh let me tell you something man you
[2:07:31] have to choose to take culture to God if
[2:07:33] you want to be closer to God but the
[2:07:35] Bible says he said draw an eye to God
[2:07:37] and God would all neither you
[2:07:40] Hallelujah you want more of God you
[2:07:43] gotta choose that we want more of God
[2:07:49] that's what he said
[2:07:51] Jesus God is waiting on you and I to do
[2:07:54] something he did his
[2:07:59] he's provided us with everything that we
[2:08:02] have need of
[2:08:04] how many believe that
[2:08:07] provided us with everything that we have
[2:08:09] need of David One More Story before I go
[2:08:11] on but David when he was in the in the
[2:08:13] in the tent of despair
[2:08:16] when when the enemy had come and got
[2:08:18] their children and their wives and so
[2:08:20] forth when David came back with all of
[2:08:23] his men his whole family and everything
[2:08:25] the enemy had taken away you remember
[2:08:27] that
[2:08:28] and his men sought to kill him
[2:08:34] his men sought to kill him
[2:08:37] damn it stare in the pit of despair no
[2:08:41] David said he strengthened himself in
[2:08:44] the Lord
[2:08:46] when you're down at the bottom of the
[2:08:47] bottom you gotta choose hey where do I
[2:08:49] go from here amen there's only one way
[2:08:51] to go and let's back up
[2:08:55] you gotta choose
[2:08:58] God loves those choices
[2:09:02] three Hebrew children
[2:09:04] we don't know whether God's Gonna
[2:09:06] Deliver us not but this one thing and we
[2:09:08] know we're gonna take a stand
[2:09:10] we're not bound
[2:09:12] I love it so
[2:09:15] much he loves
[2:09:18] he loved let an angel come down and
[2:09:19] flood that place with water
[2:09:21] there was no typhoon can you met just
[2:09:24] typhoon or the water that's seven times
[2:09:25] hotter he could have brought a rain
[2:09:27] cloud over top and dumped him up enough
[2:09:29] water to douse the whole thing

[2:18:33] for you until you first accept that what
[2:18:35] he's done that he's done it for you
[2:18:37] already
[2:18:40] I was looking at this pulling up some
[2:18:42] quotes on it he says you know if you
[2:18:44] need healing
[2:18:46] whatever it is that you need
[2:18:51] just begin to confess it believe it with
[2:18:53] all of your heart he says I mark my
[2:18:56] words after 30 years of preaching he
[2:18:58] said if you'll receive it into your
[2:18:59] heart if you'll accept but he has
[2:19:01] already done and then leave it there and
[2:19:03] go and act as though it's already done
[2:19:06] he said
[2:19:07] act like it's already done
[2:19:10] God's going to come on the scene
[2:19:13] God honors faith
[2:19:15] [Music]
[2:19:17] praise be to God
[2:19:18] what did he say oh my they shall seek me
[2:19:22] early but they shall not find me right
[2:19:24] they'll knock and they're not gonna have
[2:19:26] it open
[2:19:27] that's what he come alive crossword he
[2:19:30] says
[2:19:30] shall find not and it shall be opened
[2:19:33] unto you ask and you shall receive
[2:19:40] I like that don't you
[2:19:42] all you gotta do is accept and receive
[2:19:44] it in the mind
[2:19:45] say I choose I am accepting it now
[2:19:48] choosing is to accept choosing to
[2:19:50] believe
[2:19:52] amen what he said is the truth
[2:19:56] praise be to God
[2:19:58] Paul
[2:20:00] he says you know
[2:20:02] I know how it is to suffer need and I
[2:20:04] know how it is to abound
[2:20:06] this one thing have I learned
[2:20:10] he says I know how to abound and I know
[2:20:11] how to suffer need but in him I can do
[2:20:14] all things through Christ with which
[2:20:17] strengthens me
[2:20:19] Paul was one of those people he believed
[2:20:22] that all things are possible
[2:20:25] I can go through anything
[2:20:27] you can go through anything
[2:20:30] if he's there
[2:20:33] doesn't matter what comes to go
[2:20:34] sometimes you can't control amen you're
[2:20:36] not you're not in control of your
[2:20:38] situation as far the things that God
[2:20:40] allows to come your way the trials that
[2:20:42] come your way you you have no power over
[2:20:44] it sometimes the only Power the only
[2:20:46] strength you have is the kind of
[2:20:47] attitude that you kind of have in the
[2:20:49] midst of them that is something that you
[2:20:51] can choose
[2:20:53] how many believe that
[2:20:55] what kind of attitude what kind of
[2:20:57] thought pattern because it forms us how
[2:20:59] many knows our choosing forms us
[2:21:01] the things that you allow to go into
[2:21:03] your mind
[2:21:06] we've heard the story
[2:21:08] that you can't keep the birds from
[2:21:09] flying over your head you can't keep you
[2:21:11] can't control the thoughts of entering
[2:21:13] into your mind

[2:22:56] every thought captive to the word of God
[2:22:59] the thought that comes in here amen you

[2:23:31] you can
[2:23:32] by the grace of God you can do all
[2:23:34] things God has given us every spiritual
[2:23:37] blessing that we might dwell in Heavenly

[2:24:42] and we're living in the hour folks that
[2:24:44] you have to guard every minute of every
[2:24:46] hour of every day you got to be on guard

[2:24:50] phone and look at anything better on

[2:25:02] protected by the Holy Ghost the Holy
[2:25:03] Ghost will protect you amen
[2:25:07] praise be to God
[2:25:08] Lord help us aren't you glad to be
[2:25:10] privileged to be able to make a decision
[2:25:12] to decide
[2:25:14] and to decide by the Holy Ghost the Holy
[2:25:17] Ghost makes such great choices
[2:25:21] I mean he makes such great choices Peter
[2:25:23] and them no they had a terrible no Paul
[2:25:25] he had a terrible and guess what when he
[2:25:27] get over on the other side he says I I
[2:25:30] suppose that the spread the sufferings
[2:25:32] of this present time are not to be
[2:25:34] compared with the glory that is to be
[2:25:36] revealed
[2:25:38] all those who suffer for Christ gave
[2:25:40] their lives for Christ
[2:25:41] deem not their lives precious but give
[2:25:43] it to him give it to the Lord Jesus
[2:25:45] Christ to have reserved to themselves
[2:25:48] an ending
[2:25:49] unending life
[2:25:51] it's hard to Fathom sometimes that you
[2:25:54] when you have
[2:25:55] eternal life you are as Immortal as God
[2:25:59] is immortal
[2:26:00] you're as Eternal as God is eternal
[2:26:05] then Jesus comes and you might have
[2:26:07] eternal life
[2:26:08] there's only one form of eternal life
[2:26:11] that's God's own life
[2:26:18] people don't understand the godhead and
[2:26:19] how God can be up here and Jesus here
[2:26:21] and the dove come down into Christ
[2:26:24] if that's so how to understand how about
[2:26:26] trying to understand that God can
[2:26:28] replicate himself into many many many
[2:26:29] many many many many bodies bodies
[2:26:32] and then what he did on the day of
[2:26:34] Pentecostal the Bible says the Holy
[2:26:35] Spirit come down and it divided itself
[2:26:39] the Holy Ghost divided himself and 3 000
[2:26:43] perhaps
[2:26:44] a thousand now all over the world
[2:26:47] God can divide himself off to however he
