[57:29] for the multitude of fishes therefore
[57:32] the disciples that disciple whom Jesus
[57:34] loved called said unto Peter is it it is
[57:38] the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that
[57:41] it was the Lord he GT his Fishers Fisher
[57:44] coat about him for he was naked and did
[57:48] cast himself into the sea and the other
[57:51] disciples came in the little ship for
[57:54] they were not far from land but as it
[57:58] were 200 cubits dragging the net with
[58:01] fishes as soon as they came they were
[58:03] come to land they saw a fire of coals
[58:06] there and fish laid there on and breed
[58:09] and Jesus said unto them bring of the
[58:12] fish which ye have now caught Simon
[58:15] Peter went up and Drew the net to the
[58:17] land full of great fishes 150 and three
[58:21] and for all there were so many yet was
[58:25] not the net broken and Jesus saith unto
[58:27] them come and dine and none of the
[58:31] disciples darest ask him who art thou
[58:35] knowing that it was the Lord amen and
[58:37] then cometh then Jesus then cometh and
[58:40] taketh bread and giveth them and fish
[58:42] likewise amen may God add His blessings
[58:44] to the reading of the words you can be
[58:46] seated tonight amen we know that there's
[58:49] a several times that Jesus quite
[58:52] literally amen fed the people isn't that
[58:54] right fed to
[58:57] people amen and the other time of course
[58:59] we know it was when in St John 6 or five
[59:02] in that area where you know he took
[59:05] those uh fishes and Loaves couple fishes
[59:08] and Loaves and turned it and fed
[59:10] 5,000 I guess that was men and I'm not
[59:13] sure what the great number was I think
[59:14] brother Brad said what it was 20,000
[59:17] maybe with all the children and
[59:18] everybody a lot of people fed him then
[59:20] took a bunch of basket full up am mean
[59:23] that's what happens when God goes to
[59:24] cooking there's plenty left over amen
[59:28] amen plenty left over and here he was
[59:31] cooking for them and I can only imagine
[59:33] that it was good amen now how many knows
[59:35] that when it comes to cooking and amen
[59:37] and and food and and things that make
[59:40] you feel good and vitamins and
[59:42] everything like that of course we know
[59:43] he's the creator of it all and you know
[59:46] when you and I go to a restaurant we uh
[59:49] most of the time and we know you know
[59:51] there's some of them that you might call
[59:54] well they're just kind of slopping the
[59:55] Hogs or or something you know a that
[59:58] right so there a couple of us you know
[1:00:00] kind of think that you know no but
[1:00:02] anyway it's just have a mass bunch of
[1:00:05] food and it don't taste very good and
[1:00:07] it's not the best but you go old
[1:00:08] Charlies or somewhere like that you know
[1:00:11] and somewhere where the food's good and
[1:00:13] you know you're not going to find your
[1:00:16] salad you know all wilted and a little
[1:00:18] brown on it and
[1:00:20] slimy e right you nobody wants slimy
[1:00:24] salad right and so but anyway you know
[1:00:27] when you think about that how that we
[1:00:29] love good food you know and God we do
[1:00:31] and amen and God just knows how to bring
[1:00:34] things about and and talk about eating
[1:00:37] amen and talk about uh eating we know
[1:00:39] that all the way back in Genesis you
[1:00:42] know that God said told Adam and Eve not
[1:00:44] to do could that they could eat of every
[1:00:46] tree but not of the tree that's in the
[1:00:49] midst of the garden ain't that right but
[1:00:51] don't eat of that tree because that the
[1:00:53] day that you eat that that's the day
[1:00:56] you die you know there's two essential
[1:00:59] things in our lives two things that
[1:01:01] you've got to do got to have amen not
[1:01:05] maybe on a daily basis but you should
[1:01:07] have if you're going to be healthy
[1:01:08] that's food and
[1:01:09] water amen amen food and water that's
[1:01:13] the thing two things you got to have and
[1:01:15] it types the spiritual is that right it
[1:01:18] types the spiritual but we know that
[1:01:20] Adam and Eve of course they took up that
[1:01:22] tree amen of the knowledge of Good and
[1:01:24] Evil amen and we know that because of
[1:01:27] that they got poisoned they got death
[1:01:30] amen death set in because they ate of
[1:01:33] the wrong
[1:01:34] fruit amen and we know in Genesis 1 and
[1:01:38] 3 and verse 22 he says it this way and
[1:01:40] the Lord said now behold man has become
[1:01:43] as one of us to know good and to know
[1:01:45] evil and now least he put forth his hand
[1:01:48] and take also of the tree of life and
[1:01:51] eat and live
[1:01:54] forever so how many know there a Tree of
[1:01:56] Life there also that if you could
[1:01:57] partake of that you could have eternal
[1:02:02] life
[1:02:03] amen praise the
[1:02:05] Lord so ever since the dawn of humanity
[1:02:11] it's been about what we eat amen what
[1:02:16] you eat and I certainly don't mean it
[1:02:20] naturally because I think even the
[1:02:22] disciples got come to Jesus and they
[1:02:24] said you know to Jesus well they don't
[1:02:25] you don't they don't eat the right thing
[1:02:27] you don't wash their hands and so forth
[1:02:29] he says but it's not what goes into the
[1:02:31] mouth and goes out into the draw that
[1:02:33] defiles a man but it's what comes out
[1:02:36] amen but this eating that we're talking
[1:02:38] about of course we know that when e e
[1:02:41] partook of this tream she partook
[1:02:43] actually of what the devil had to
[1:02:46] say a't that right she agreed she agreed
[1:02:51] with what the devil was saying so out of
[1:02:54] this sermon I got today I said be
[1:02:56] careful who you agree with that's
[1:02:59] right amen because that means you're
[1:03:02] believing what they're saying and what
[1:03:05] they're saying is certainly better be
[1:03:07] right it also brings into EMP emphas
[1:03:11] emphasis amen how important it is that
[1:03:14] you have a Right leader leadership it's
[1:03:18] vitally vitally
[1:03:20] important even around this message look
[1:03:23] at the the different different doctrines
[1:03:26] that went out and man you know talk
[1:03:28] about inspiration and anointed like you
[1:03:31] ain't never seen folks amen but they yet
[1:03:34] they would preach perusia hello or
[1:03:37] Thunders and if you didn't belong to
[1:03:39] that well I don't you know they didn't
[1:03:41] think you was
[1:03:43] in you know and we find out you got to
[1:03:45] be careful ain't that right because
[1:03:47] everybody has a version you know
[1:03:49] everybody has a way to bring it out and
[1:03:51] you got to make sure that it's according
[1:03:53] to the word so it's very very vital and
[1:03:56] how many know that's why it was so vital
[1:03:59] amen and when you're following the
[1:04:00] prophet of God Amen how many know it's
[1:04:03] very vital of whether you do or whether
[1:04:05] you don't if he's false you better
[1:04:09] not but if he's true you
[1:04:12] better amen it's vital amen because we
[1:04:16] find that this type of eating was
[1:04:18] partaking coming in through the womb of
[1:04:19] the mind so to speak amen amen your mind
[1:04:23] goes to feeding on things and she she
[1:04:25] believed that the devil when he said
[1:04:27] Thou shalt not surely die right there
[1:04:29] when she pered that believed that she
[1:04:32] committed adultery against almighty God
[1:04:34] before the natural act ever taken place
[1:04:37] there was already a spiritual light that
[1:04:38] had taken place amen amen and she take
[1:04:41] of that tree and she brought death until
[1:04:43] now here we see a tree standing amen
[1:04:46] that was said that if you eat of this
[1:04:48] tree you'll live
[1:04:51] forever amen praise the
[1:04:54] Lord you know I'll just read this it's
[1:04:56] in front of you you know even pet I mean
[1:04:59] uh James Peter John Paul David there we
[1:05:02] go you know David said thou preparest a
[1:05:06] table before me in the presence of my
[1:05:09] enemies amen thou anointest my head with
[1:05:11] oil my cup runneth over now I want to go
[1:05:14] to oh New Testament chapter U another
[1:05:18] another scripture in the New Testament
[1:05:20] where Jesus talks about
[1:05:23] um amen
[1:05:27] this is in St Luke I'm sorry St Luke 14
[1:05:31] St Luke 14 if you want to go with me I'm
[1:05:33] going to read this here whole
[1:05:42] thing and when uh verse
[1:05:46] 15
[1:05:48] and when one of them that sat at meat
[1:05:51] with him heard the
[1:05:53] things he said unto him
[1:05:58] blessed is he that shall eat bread in
[1:06:03] the kingdom of God that's what Jesus
[1:06:05] said amen blessed is he that shall eat
[1:06:08] bread in the kingdom of God then said he
[1:06:11] unto him a certain man made a great
[1:06:14] supper and B
[1:06:15] many and sent his servant at supper time
[1:06:18] to come and to say to them that were
[1:06:20] bidden come for all things are now ready
[1:06:27] amen praise the Lord and they all with
[1:06:30] one consent began to make excuse and the
[1:06:32] first one said unto him I have bought a
[1:06:34] piece of ground and I must needs go see
[1:06:37] it I pray thee have me excused and
[1:06:40] another said I have bought five Yol of
[1:06:42] oxen I must go prove them I pray that
[1:06:44] you have me excused and another said I
[1:06:46] have married a wife I therefore cannot
[1:06:49] come so that servant came and showed his
[1:06:51] Lord these things then the master of the
[1:06:53] house being angry said to his servant go
[1:06:55] out quickly into the streets and into
[1:06:57] the lanes into the of the city and bring
[1:07:01] hither the poor the Mame the Halt and
[1:07:03] the
[1:07:04] blind amen praise the Lord why you
[1:07:07] reckon they all needed to come to the
[1:07:10] supper huh why because at this supper
[1:07:14] they're liable to get their eyes open
[1:07:18] they're liable if they're lame to be
[1:07:19] able to walk again praise the Lord
[1:07:22] that's the kind of dinner I'm talking
[1:07:24] about
[1:07:25] praise the Lord now notice and the
[1:07:28] servant said Lord it is done as thou
[1:07:30] Hast commanded and yet there is room and
[1:07:34] the Lord said unto that servant go out
[1:07:36] into the highways and the hedges and
[1:07:38] compel them to come in that my house may
[1:07:42] be filled how many believe that Jesus
[1:07:45] has a table spread where the saints of
[1:07:47] God are fed he invites his chosen people
[1:07:51] come and D come and D the master call us
[1:07:53] come and D you may Feast at Jesus tle
[1:07:57] all the time amen and there's always
[1:07:59] more
[1:08:01] room how many believes God is a more
[1:08:03] room hey there this table isn't full yet
[1:08:06] there's still room for
[1:08:10] more how glad tonight to be feasting at
[1:08:14] this
[1:08:15] table you're not one of those that have
[1:08:17] made an
[1:08:18] excuse no people get all kinds of
[1:08:21] excuses not to come
[1:08:25] and it's sad
[1:08:27] too because the Lord said unto the
[1:08:29] servant go into the highways hedge and
[1:08:31] compelled them to come in that may my
[1:08:33] house may be filled for I say unto you
[1:08:35] that none of those men which were bid
[1:08:37] shall taste of my
[1:08:42] supper
[1:08:44] glory amen if you don't come you'll
[1:08:47] never taste of his
[1:08:51] supper praise the Lord
[1:08:56] how many believes that the Lord the Lord
[1:08:58] himself can be
[1:09:01] tasted in Psalms 34 and8 says oh taste
[1:09:06] and see that the Lord is
[1:09:11] good amen blessed is the man that
[1:09:14] trusteth in
[1:09:19] him Revelations 22 the very end of the
[1:09:22] whole Bible when it's almost wrapped up
[1:09:24] within the few verses of the very end
[1:09:27] the spirit and the bride say come in
[1:09:29] verse 17 the spirit and the bride say
[1:09:32] come and let him that's here say come
[1:09:35] and let him that a thirst come fill my
[1:09:38] cup Lord come and quench the thirsting
[1:09:41] of my soul how many believe blessed are
[1:09:45] they which do hunger and thirst after
[1:09:50] righteousness woo Glory just to have
[1:09:54] that thirst you're a blessed
[1:09:56] person remember what what we read
[1:09:58] earlier blessed is he that shall eat in
[1:10:01] the kingdom of God praise the Lord eat
[1:10:05] bread in the kingdom of God come and who
[1:10:10] and let him that is a thirst come and
[1:10:12] whosoever will let him come and take of
[1:10:15] the Water of Life

[1:10:23] my wife on the way to church I said give
[1:10:25] me that phone I want to remember the
[1:10:27] thought you know and and I said you know
[1:10:30] I spoken to the phone I says you know
[1:10:32] that scripture says in Revelation there
[1:10:34] let him come let anyone he bits
[1:10:36] everybody to come anybody that's a
[1:10:38] thirst come but you know you can bring a
[1:10:41] horse to
[1:10:43] water but you can't make him
[1:10:46] drink they got a big neck you
[1:10:50] know right anybody ever grab of a hold

[1:11:11] ride is that right why because he's so
[1:11:14] much stronger amen but that's the
[1:11:17] problem the problem is that people
[1:11:20] aren't thirsty people aren't
[1:11:24] hungry they're not hungry after
[1:11:27] righteousness they're not worried about
[1:11:29] whether they're right or not with God
[1:11:32] they don't want to be right with God but
[1:11:34] that's why you said here that's why I

[1:11:38] to come on a Wednesday night to say Lord
[1:11:40] if there any be any unrighteousness me

[1:12:53] to accept that
[1:12:58] I have learned through me and my wife's
[1:12:59] experience that as long as you're still
[1:13:01] hoping for it you don't got the faith to
[1:13:03] have
[1:13:06] it cuz if you're looking for it to
[1:13:08] happen and saying Lord I'm looking for

[1:18:31] that's what a lot of people ought to be
[1:18:32] doing is Lord give me this water I want

[1:18:36] water and what does he do he begins to
[1:18:39] discern her thoughts and intensive her

[1:18:48] and they that worship Him must worship
[1:18:49] Him in spirit and in truth and the woman
[1:18:52] saith unto him I know the Messiah cometh
[1:18:54] which is called Christ and when he has
[1:18:55] come he will tell us these things Jesus
[1:18:57] saith under her I that speak thee am he
[1:19:00] is that right and she left her water pop
[1:19:03] and ran into the City and said to the
[1:19:05] men of the city because she said we know
[1:19:06] the when the Messiah comes he'll tell us
[1:19:08] the thing he says man look what they've
[1:19:11] done and the man of the city came and
[1:19:12] believed on him because of that woman's
[1:19:16] report
[1:19:18] why she knew more about what the Messiah
[1:19:20] was than this generation of
[1:19:23] people all right let's let's look at
[1:19:25] what's on the table let's look at the
[1:19:26] table y'all want to look at what's on
[1:19:27] the table to eat what's on the table
[1:19:30] that we can
[1:19:33] eat St John 6 will begin and then we'll
[1:19:38] get right to our point in chapter
[1:19:41] 7 now right after he had caused the men
[1:19:47] to sit down in the grassy place and he
[1:19:50] gave him all those fishes and Loaves
[1:19:52] after all those things the multitude
[1:19:55] followed him in a ship chapter 6 and
[1:19:58] verse 26 says and Jesus answered them
[1:20:02] and said verily I say unto you you seek
[1:20:05] me not because you saw the Miracles but
[1:20:07] because you did eat of the Loaves and
[1:20:09] were filled then he says labor not for
[1:20:12] the meat which perishes but for the meat
[1:20:14] which endureth unto everlasting life
[1:20:17] which the son of man shall give unto you
[1:20:19] for him hath God
[1:20:21] sealed let's go on down to verse 30
[1:20:24] there said therefore unto him what sign
[1:20:27] showest thou then that we may see and
[1:20:29] believe thee what do thou
[1:20:32] work my goodness he had just showed him
[1:20:36] you know about the Loaves and the
[1:20:39] fishes n our fathers did eat Mana in the
[1:20:43] wilderness as it is written he gave them
[1:20:45] bread from Heaven to
[1:20:48] eat then Jesus saith unto him verily
[1:20:51] verily I say unto you Moses gave you not
[1:20:54] that meat from heaven but my father
[1:20:56] giveth you the true
[1:20:59] bread amen the true bread for the bread
[1:21:02] of God is he which cometh down from
[1:21:04] heaven and giveth life his life unto the
[1:21:08] world they said unto him Lord ever more
[1:21:10] give us this bread Jesus said unto them
[1:21:13] I am the bread of
[1:21:15] life he that cometh to me shall never
[1:21:18] hunger he that believeth on me shall
[1:21:21] never
[1:21:22] thirst amen so what is it this hungering
[1:21:26] this feeding this taking in of Jesus is
[1:21:31] by believing him by receiving him by
[1:21:35] receiving his
[1:21:37] word that's what it all hinges on
[1:21:39] whether or not you receive that word
[1:21:42] into your heart that's the true eating
[1:21:45] of God is believing
[1:21:50] God Amen
[1:21:56] over in the same chapter over in
[1:22:01] verse 48 again he says I am the bread of
[1:22:07] life your fathers did eat Mana in the
[1:22:10] wilderness and are dead but B says that
[1:22:14] man that dead means eternally separated
[1:22:17] from
[1:22:18] God he didn't say Sleepless or anything
[1:22:20] like that are dead and this is the bread
[1:22:23] which cometh down from heaven that a man
[1:22:26] may eat

[1:22:59] of almighty god for death means

[1:26:56] God thank you

[1:27:01] back he had a table spread he said he
[1:27:05] did made a great supper invited
[1:27:10] everybody oh
[1:27:17] my when I think about what God Did In
[1:27:20] Our
[1:27:21] Generation through the prophet of God
[1:27:24] open up the eyes of the blind things
[1:27:25] that hadn't been done for 2,000 years
[1:27:28] hello opened the eyes of the Blind and
[1:27:31] healed the sick and infallible proofs
[1:27:34] and stayed right with the word took us
[1:27:36] right back the word of God ain't that
[1:27:43] right and then people make
[1:27:46] excuse I manyan those people that make
[1:27:48] excuses they're going to regret making
[1:27:50] excuses one day they're going to make
[1:27:54] going have serious regrets having make
[1:27:56] it excuses not to come to God not to
[1:28:01] accept what he before before this before
[1:28:06] this Earth completely
[1:28:10] Burns God was so
[1:28:13] merciful that he even had his own
[1:28:16] picture taken with the
[1:28:17] prophet the pillar of fire was seen
[1:28:20] multiple times the power of God was
[1:28:23] demonstrated by like never at any other
[1:28:26] age how many knows he went what seven
[1:28:29] times over ain't that right over and
[1:28:31] over and over and over and over the
[1:28:33] world Amen mercy and mercy and mercy and
[1:28:36] mercy and mercy God reached out his
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:41] hand to save
[1:28:45] people amen he's not going to burn it
[1:28:47] without giving everybody a warning
[1:28:49] without giving everybody every chance
[1:28:50] that you could possibly
[1:28:52] have according to the prophet but God's
[1:28:54] word was enough God said it there's your
[1:28:57] chance but then God does is merciful he
[1:29:01] comes and does signs and wonders how
[1:29:03] many knows the healing the healing of
[1:29:05] people when brother bam was Discerning
[1:29:07] the thoughts and intents of the people
[1:29:08] that was not for their
[1:29:11] healing he said that was to build their
[1:29:13] faith that God is there that God is real
[1:29:16] and then accepted now will you believe
[1:29:19] that you are
[1:29:20] healed why because that it get inspires
[1:29:23] their faith of course if he had a vision
[1:29:26] of them being healed he would say it and
[1:29:28] so forth but a lot of times he would say
[1:29:30] now you're so and so from so and so your
[1:29:32] name is so and
[1:29:35] so it's also kind of so strange that the
[1:29:38] angel said if you can get the people to
[1:29:39] believe
[1:29:40] you how many times you you
[1:29:44] know how many times this seems to be on
[1:29:47] the side here but maybe somebody needs
[1:29:49] it how many times he would Des he would
[1:29:52] he would uh he would say now do you
[1:29:55] believe me to be his
[1:29:59] servant because how many believes if
[1:30:02] your pastor preached for you if your
[1:30:04] brother Brad prays for you you've got to
[1:30:07] believe that he's a servant of God and
[1:30:08] when he lays his hands on you that
[1:30:11] you're going to be healed otherwise you
[1:30:13] might as well sitting in your
[1:30:15] seat but on the case of brother bandham
[1:30:18] he said if he could get the people to
[1:30:20] believe not even cancer would stand in
[1:30:22] their way
[1:30:24] amen one woman I y'all remember I read
[1:30:27] it just about a week or so ago it's
[1:30:29] because she did not believe it now he
[1:30:31] told her get dick either crutches or
[1:30:32] something not take your crutches off and
[1:30:35] go she says I've been on these all my
[1:30:38] life and you're going to tell me I he
[1:30:40] said because you didn't believe you'll
[1:30:41] stay on
[1:30:43] them she didn't get her healing because
[1:30:45] she did not believe what he told her he
[1:30:47] told her to do it if she tells you to go
[1:30:49] and take it that's exactly what she
[1:30:50] should have done but she doubted I've
[1:30:53] been on the this for all my life you're
[1:30:55] going to tell me that I just take up it
[1:30:57] was doubt speaking wasn't good how many
[1:31:00] know doubt is never good amen why God do
[1:31:03] you take doubt into your heart you
[1:31:05] disbelieve he that believeth not shall
[1:31:07] be damned go you into all the world and
[1:31:09] preach the gospel he that believeth and
[1:31:11] is baptized shall be saved simply by
[1:31:14] eating it and believing it you will be
[1:31:17] saved don't have to have any works just
[1:31:19] believe you ain't got to crawl on your
[1:31:21] knees you ain't got to do a rosary you
[1:31:23] ain't got to do all all this other stuff
[1:31:25] just believe this
[1:31:27] Bible whosoever believeth in me shall
[1:31:29] not perish but have everlasting
[1:31:32] life ain't that right the simple Faith
[1:31:35] just take it and believe
[1:31:40] it
[1:31:45] amen
[1:31:51] amen I am the living bread verse 51
[1:31:53] which came down from heaven if any me
[1:31:55] man eat of this bread and he shall live
[1:31:58] forever for the bread that I will give
[1:32:00] he give is my flesh which I will give
[1:32:03] for the life of the world the Jews
[1:32:06] therefore strove among themselves saying
[1:32:07] how can this man give us his flesh to
[1:32:10] eat then said Jesus unto them verily
[1:32:13] verily I say unto you except you eat the
[1:32:16] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[1:32:19] blood you have no life in

[1:40:59] that I'm packing the message I have no
[1:41:00] more to do with it than nothing how many

[1:41:16] the will of the father that I declare to

[1:41:21] one that appeared on the Ohio River I
[1:41:22] wasn't only standing in where he appears
[1:41:25] I'm not the one that performs these
[1:41:26] things and foretells these things that
[1:41:28] happens as perfect as they are I'm only
[1:41:30] the one that's near when he doesn't he
[1:41:33] just uses my mouth God help us

[1:41:37] to be so close to us that that's all we
[1:41:39] do is he just speaks through our mouth
[1:41:41] he just loves through our hearts he just
[1:41:44] has compassion through our
[1:41:46] lives I was only the voice it wasn't
[1:41:49] what I knew it's just what I surrendered
[1:41:51] myself to he spoke through through me it

[1:45:28] Ephesians the book of
[1:45:33] Ephesians that he might sanctify he said
[1:45:37] husband loves your wives even as Christ
[1:45:39] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:45:41] for it that he might sanctify it and
