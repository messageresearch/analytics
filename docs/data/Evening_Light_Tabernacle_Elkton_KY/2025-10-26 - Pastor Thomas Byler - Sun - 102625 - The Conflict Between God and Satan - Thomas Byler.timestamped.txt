[0:00] the Lord. Thank you. [applause]
[0:02] Amen. Let's bow our heads
[0:06] once again. kind heavenly father, we bow
[0:08] our heads, Lord Jesus, to the dust from
[0:11] whence we came, Lord Jesus, our physical
[0:13] bodies, Lord, and we just look up to
[0:16] you, Lord Jesus, our heavenly father
[0:18] that's created our spirits, created our
[0:20] souls, Father, and has put in our
[0:22] hearts, Lord Jesus, a place, Father, for
[0:25] the abode of the Holy Spirit and put a
[0:27] thirst in there so that we would have a
[0:29] hunger and a thirsty after
[0:31] righteousness, Lord. And [snorts] we
[0:33] have come into your house this morning
[0:34] once again, Lord. Father, with our hands
[0:37] lifted high, Lord Jesus, our hearts,
[0:39] Father, under expectation, Lord Jesus,
[0:42] uh Lord, of what you would have for us
[0:44] this morning, Lord, and so that we could
[0:46] go better, go from here a better people
[0:48] than what we've come, Lord, and that you
[0:50] would change us from glory to glory. We
[0:52] thank you, Lord Jesus, for touching each
[0:54] and every one of the sick people, Lord,
[0:56] not feeling well, Lord, for the prayers
[0:58] that were made. We believe, God, that
[1:00] you'll answer each and every one of
[1:01] them, Lord, for you are that kind of a
[1:03] God. We ask God that you'll just bless
[1:06] the reading of the word, the meditation
[1:07] of our heart and our study. Father, we
[1:09] pray Lord God that it would be right in
[1:11] the center of your will, Lord. Help me
[1:13] to get out of the way that you might
[1:14] just speak now, Father, and the ears of
[1:16] the hear, Lord Jesus, if there's any
[1:18] impediment, Lord, something that would
[1:20] cause them not to be able to receive
[1:22] your word, Father. We take every spirit
[1:24] under our control for the glory of God.
[1:27] And we ask, God, that you'd have the
[1:28] liberty.
[1:35] in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn your Bibles if you will.
[1:40] We'll just get right into the word.
[1:43] Certainly is good to be in the house of
[1:44] the Lord. Amen. I don't know what you do
[1:47] for having a good time. Amen. But I
[1:50] believe there's joy in the house of the
[1:52] Lord.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; There's joy in the house of the Lord.
[1:55] Amen. Amen. So if you want to go
[1:57] somewhere where there's joy, Amen. I
[2:00] believe you won't find any better place
[2:02] in the house of God.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Kind of a thought that the Lord
[2:06] just laid on my heart. Amen. Can you
[2:09] bring that title up before we even read
[2:10] this morning? Amen.
[2:16] Amen. The conflict between God and
[2:19] Satan. Amen. Amen. That's the thought
[2:22] that came to my mind when I first begin
[2:24] to meditate on this. That's just a
[2:27] thought that came in my mind. And then
[2:29] um Amen. I remembered brother Brandham
[2:31] preaching something on that order and it
[2:33] was called
[2:35] the the conflict
[2:40] the contest message he preached was
[2:43] called the contest. Amen. A good message
[2:45] to listen to preached in Jeffersonville
[2:47] in ' 62. Amen. Amen. So he had some
[2:51] quotes there that I really liked. Amen.
[2:53] And so we're going to Amen. take a
[2:56] journey again. this morning. Amen. We'll
[2:59] go as far as we can, but we're going to
[3:01] start, Amen. in heaven and we're going
[3:03] to try to end up over on the other side
[3:06] of tribulation period. Amen. So, we got
[3:08] a long way to go, don't we? Amen. From
[3:10] Genesis to Revelations. Amen. Amen. I
[3:14] think maybe we'll start with
[3:17] uh perhaps Isaiah. Let's just go to the
[3:20] book of Isaiah
[3:26] 14.
[3:28] Isaiah 14.
[3:32] If you'll notice and think about it,
[3:34] realizing that a lot of times a conflict
[3:37] can be called a conflict. Amen. Or
[3:39] should we say that a war is that right?
[3:42] Might call it Amen. Russia and so forth.
[3:46] And they're having a conflict over
[3:47] there. Isn't that right?
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, a conflict or a battle or a
[3:53] war.
[3:54] Amen. So
[3:57] Isaiah 14 verse 12, how art thou fallen
[4:02] from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the
[4:04] morning? How art thou cut down to the
[4:05] ground, which did weaken the nations?
[4:09] For thou has said in thine heart, I will
[4:10] ascend unto heaven. I will exalt my
[4:13] throne above the stars of God. I will
[4:16] sit also upon the mount of the
[4:18] congregation in the sides of the north,
[4:21] and I will ascend above the heights of
[4:23] the clouds. I will be like the most
[4:26] high. Amen. Amen.
[4:33] Over in second Thessalonians,
[4:38] 2 Thessalonians,
[4:49] second chapter. We beseech you,
[4:52] brethren, by the coming of the Lord
[4:54] Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
[4:56] together unto him,
[4:59] that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or
[5:01] be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by
[5:03] word, nor by letter as from us, as that
[5:05] day of Christ is at hand. Let no man
[5:08] deceive you by any means. For that day
[5:09] shall not come except there come a
[5:11] falling away first. And that man of sin
[5:14] be revealed the son of predition who
[5:17] opposes and exaltth himself above all
[5:19] that is called God or that is worshiped
[5:22] so that he as God siteth in the temple
[5:24] of God showing himself that he is God.
[5:27] Verse seven, when for the mystery of
[5:30] iniquity does already work, only he who
[5:32] now leth will let until he be taken out
[5:34] of the way. And then shall that wicked
[5:37] be revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[5:38] with the spirit of his mouth, and shall
[5:41] destroy with the brightness of his
[5:43] coming, even him whose coming is after
[5:45] the working of Satan with all power and
[5:48] and signs and lying wonders, and with
[5:51] all deceivleness of unrighteousness in
[5:53] them in them that perish, because they
[5:55] received not the love of the truth, that
[5:57] they might be saved. Amen. The God of
[6:00] this evil age, and also lean not on to
[6:02] your own understanding. Brother Benham
[6:04] goes into great detail about this about
[6:08] they will not receive the vindicated
[6:10] word of the hour. They will not receive
[6:12] the truth. Amen. Then it says verse 11,
[6:16] for God shall send them strong delusion
[6:19] and that they should believe a lie that
[6:21] they might be damned who believe not the
[6:24] truth but have pleasure in
[6:26] unrighteousness. May God bless you.
[6:27] Bless the reading of the words. You can
[6:29] be seated. You can get comfortable. Sit
[6:32] down and relax. Chill. We're going going
[6:37] for a little while. Amen.
[6:39] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's right. We
[6:42] know that the world in which we are
[6:44] living in is described by Jesus when he
[6:47] said, "Behold, Amen. I sent you forth as
[6:51] sheep among wolves." How many believe
[6:53] we're living in a world of wolves?
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; I didn't bring it out here. Forgot it.
[7:00] But this morning I was looking at Fox
[7:02] News and they were uh I believe it's
[7:05] Nigeria and how that they said the front
[7:08] page was a was a large number. But when
[7:10] I looked at the details it talked about
[7:12] since 2009 how 50,000 Christians have
[7:16] been killed.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Millions displaced and so forth.
[7:21] The number the first number was higher
[7:23] than that. I'm thinking it was 125,000
[7:27] of of the persecution that's going on.
[7:29] Amen. How many days? There is truly a
[7:31] persecution. Amen. Coming on to the
[7:34] Christian. Amen. Especially out in that
[7:36] part of the world. So we live in quite a
[7:39] world. Amen. We live in Satan's Eve.
[7:41] Isn't that right?
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just kind of lay a
[7:45] foundation. Amen. Brother Brandon when
[7:46] he was because it's the direction I want
[7:48] to go. Amen. Brother Brandon was pre
[7:50] preaching on the contest, he says it
[7:52] this way and he read the scripture about
[7:54] spiritual wickedness in high places. He
[7:57] says, "I'd like to draw a little
[7:58] 10-minute 15minute context." This was a
[8:01] 1962 midnight service right around 12:00
[8:04] midnight when they were going, Amen.
[8:06] into 1963.
[8:09] Amen. So, he just wanted to speak for
[8:10] about 10 15 minutes. He says, "I want to
[8:13] call it the contest." The contest is a
[8:15] test of strength. Amen. Amen. Where we
[8:19] have a test strength. Amen. It used to
[8:23] be the Indian used to put a fire and
[8:25] they would put so many on this side of a
[8:27] rope and so many on that side they'd
[8:29] have a tug of war. The contest of
[8:31] strength would pull the losing party
[8:33] across that fire. Amen. We know there's
[8:36] many things. Amen. And we could base
[8:39] upon for a few minutes now the contest
[8:40] but I want to speak for a few minutes he
[8:42] says quickly upon the greatest contest
[8:45] there is between the church and Satan.
[8:48] The great strength of Satan. And we want
[8:50] to speak on the great strength of God in
[8:54] his church.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother B says, "Now this contest
[9:00] has been going on for many years. It
[9:03] started Amen. in Eden."
[9:06] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; I was going to ask y'all. Amen. It
[9:10] didn't start in Eden, did it?
[9:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Sin did not originate in Eden. Sin
[9:16] started
[9:18] &gt;&gt; in heaven.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Hard to fathom, but it started in
[9:21] heaven.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; That's where the first Amen. contest, so
[9:26] to speak, or the first conflict, Amen,
[9:30] began was in heaven. I don't know about
[9:33] you, but Amen. We uh, you know, I'll
[9:36] just say this, it comes to mind. Amen.
[9:38] This is a cruel world we're living in
[9:40] with a lot of hardships, a lot of
[9:42] struggles.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we try to teach our children,
[9:45] I don't know if Paul, have you ever been
[9:47] told, but Paul,
[9:49] Daddy, you got to be tough.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Is that what we teach our children, hey,
[9:54] you got to be tough.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody says something about it,
[9:59] something bad about you. I mean, you got
[10:02] to be strong.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, forgive them. If you're weak, get
[10:07] up there and punch them.
[10:10] But you got to be strong. say, "Well,
[10:12] God forgive him." Ain't that right?
[10:14] &gt;&gt; It takes a lot more strength to restrain
[10:17] than it does just to fly out.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we teach our children, you
[10:21] know, especially where me and Brother
[10:24] David and and where I come from. Hello.
[10:27] A lot of times, you know, you start on a
[10:29] crew and you start working somewhere and
[10:31] people are mean and pull this and pull
[10:33] that. They would just want to see how
[10:34] tough they are.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; You have to be tough to make. Why?
[10:39] because they know it's a it's a cruel
[10:41] world. Amen. And you can't be a
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We get won't get very far. Amen.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's right. So it's a test of
[10:54] strength. Amen. This it's listen. It
[10:57] started in heaven and Satan was kicked
[11:00] out into the earth and then become the
[11:03] enemy of God's people. Is that right?
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Since then, he used all his
[11:08] strength and and his strategy to pull
[11:11] GOD'S PEOPLE ACROSS THE fires into his
[11:16] fires.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I like sometimes uh you know
[11:24] what does the Bible say? That he's able
[11:26] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[11:28] that we are able to ask or think.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. More than what you can even think.
[11:34] I like to imagine sometimes.
[11:37] Maybe, brother Troy, maybe someday we'll
[11:40] get up there and we'll ask for a rewind.
[11:44] Lord, can you show us a rewind of what
[11:46] happened up here? We'd like to see this
[11:49] conflict.
[11:51] We'd like TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE
[11:53] devil all OF A SUDDEN DECIDED THAT HE
[11:55] WANTED TO BE A GOD. He wanted to be
[11:58] above the stars of God.
[12:02] the battle that WENT ON WITH MICHAEL AND
[12:04] HIS ANGEL and Lucifer. Isn't that right?
[12:06] &gt;&gt; And there was a war that went on up in
[12:10] heaven.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let me ask you this. Let me
[12:15] just read this quote before I before I
[12:17] say it, but I like this here. He says,
[12:19] "And we know and we know right after
[12:23] into his fires, he says, "And we know
[12:26] who has the most power."
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:32] Amen.
[12:35] Who has the most power? God does.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:42] [applause]
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. That he has the most
[12:46] power.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; He's more POWERFUL THAN THE DEVIL. HE
[12:51] THE DEVIL is not a creator. God is a
[12:55] creator.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:01] You hear preachers say, "Stupid devil."
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Well, when you really think about it, he
[13:07] ain't too smart.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Now, don't get me wrong, he outsmarts
[13:12] millions and billions of people.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; He does.
[13:17] And can we truly say that your wits
[13:20] don't match his?
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's right.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; No, your wits don't. BUT GUESS WHAT?
[13:28] God's good. That's it.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; God's good. That's why say you don't
[13:35] stand a chance against the devil if you
[13:37] ain't GOT THE HOLY GHOST.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. That's right.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, IF YOU AIN'T GOT
[13:41] THE HOLY GHOST, HE'S ALREADY GOT YOU.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; So that's WHY YOU GOT TO HAVE THE WISDOM
[13:47] OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE
[13:49] LED BY THE HOLY GHOST, YOU CAN BE LIKE A
[13:53] David and say, "Who do you think you
[13:55] are?
[13:56] I don't care how BIG YOU ARE. I DON'T
[13:59] CARE WHAT KIND OF A BIG old tree you
[14:02] look like you are. I KNOW MY GOD AND YOU
[14:06] AIN'T NOTHING.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; The reason I brought up stupidity and I
[14:14] didn't have this in my notes, but I
[14:16] begin TO THINK ABOUT WHY THE DEVIL IS SO
[14:19] THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT HE is no match for
[14:21] God.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. He knows that he he all
[14:25] the devil CAN DO IS PERVERT, BUT GOD CAN
[14:28] CREATE.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; So, this morning, we're going to we're
[14:38] going to talk this morning about how how
[14:41] uh successful
[14:44] and how marvelously
[14:46] successful the devil is.
[14:52] We always say the devil's a loser.
[14:56] Yeah, he is a loser,
[14:58] but he's also marvelously successful.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; The devil has not won many wars.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. No, I'm going to rephrase that.
[15:12] The devil has won many battles.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; Many battles. The first battle, the
[15:19] first conflict was in heaven. He lost.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; HE GOT THROWN OUT. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? The
[15:27] second battle, WE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS
[15:29] CAST down into the earth. And then he
[15:31] began to talk to Eve. Isn't that right?
[15:34] Began to preach to Eve and started to
[15:36] work on Eve and it worked.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. GOT EVE TO FALL.
[15:45] GOT UP AND out of the fall. GOT HIM TO
[15:47] STEP OUT FOR HIS LIFE, plunged the whole
[15:50] creation into death. Can you imagine the
[15:53] joy bells and the dancing and the her
[15:56] and the har that was going on in the
[15:58] regions amongst the devils?
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; MANY MANY BATTLES THE DEVIL HAD WON.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear a preacher say that
[16:09] too much. Going
[16:10] &gt;&gt; be a little bit different this morning.
[16:12] God admit it.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[16:18] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. One, but you know,
[16:24] now let me let me stop there. Come back
[16:27] and realize that some people says,
[16:29] "Well, I don't know about the Bible and
[16:31] I don't know about God and and so
[16:34] forth." But we know that butterham said
[16:37] in the greatest battle ever fought and
[16:39] first of all let me let me say this that
[16:42] in the contest says we need to learn the
[16:44] devil's tactics when you're fighting
[16:47] somebody and when you're coming up again
[16:49] in a contest when you're in a contest
[16:52] with somebody especially boxing which is
[16:54] what brother Brandon knew he would
[16:55] mention how you know maybe he'll have a
[16:59] good left hook or something or a right
[17:01] jab or whatever it is and you'll learn
[17:03] just what that opponent will do so that
[17:06] you can block that when he comes. And he
[17:07] says, "That's what we need to do. That's
[17:09] what we've got to do is learn the
[17:10] devil's tactics,
[17:12] &gt;&gt; learn his jabs, learn how he works,
[17:15] &gt;&gt; right?"
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I thought, well, you know,
[17:17] that that that that's telling me what I
[17:19] need to do, but that's not really
[17:21] telling me all that much because I need
[17:23] to wonder what these tactics are. What
[17:25] are his jars? Not just, you know,
[17:28] because we got to get into detail about
[17:29] it. You know the good part about it is I
[17:32] don't have to come up with it. I mean
[17:34] God already told us
[17:36] &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE PROPHET OF GOD when he
[17:37] preached the greatest battle ever
[17:39] fought.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; He told us there OF HOW THAT WE ARE our
[17:42] own greatest enemy. Isn't that right?
[17:44] How that the devil will use you. You
[17:46] have your feelings, your emotions, your
[17:48] oh my all kinds of those things that
[17:50] that's where THE DEVIL COMES IN. HE'LL
[17:52] COME IN a bruise. He'll come in a in a
[17:54] fight in a in a battle or in an
[17:56] argument. to come in a hurt somewhere
[17:59] and all of these different things, 10
[18:00] senses and all THAT THAT YOU GOT TO KEEP
[18:03] GUARDED cuz if you don't your reasoning
[18:06] your imaginations because that's what
[18:08] you use on evil was our reasoning. Now
[18:10] is it reasonable?
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Rab called lean not to
[18:15] your own understanding. Said the you
[18:17] know the that the the churches of this
[18:19] age has taken the lead to their own
[18:21] understanding their own ideas
[18:23] &gt;&gt; right
[18:23] &gt;&gt; above the vindicated word of God and put
[18:25] the devil where he's always wanted to
[18:26] be.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; So let me establish this. He says you've
[18:32] heard of wars and rumors of wars and if
[18:36] your stands we'll have plenty more wars.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; I believe we're going to have more wars.
[18:41] Yep.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; You're going to have another battle with
[18:44] the devil.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're not done yet until we're
[18:48] done.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; UNTIL WE'RE OUT OF HERE. You'll have
[18:51] battles.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THERE'S ONLY TWO powers
[18:55] in the universe? No. You can't EXCLUDE
[18:58] YOURSELF. YOU CAN'T GO OFF AND JUST
[19:00] DISMISS YOURSELF FROM THE WHOLE THING.
[19:02] You're one or the other. of all of our
[19:06] differences in the nations, DIFFERENCES
[19:08] BETWEEN EACH OTHER AND EVERYTHING. It
[19:10] all amounts to two powers. Two powers is
[19:13] there's only two powers in two kingdoms.
[19:16] Amen.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; All the rest of just minor things that
[19:19] connected with either one either one of
[19:22] those powers,
[19:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[19:24] &gt;&gt; How many BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT
[19:26] YOU is connected to one or the other?
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; You are a part of one or you are a part
[19:35] OF THE OTHER. YOU ARE EITHER POWERED BY
[19:38] the devil this morning or you're powered
[19:40] by God this morning. Period.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO NEUTRAL GROUND. IF YOU THINK
[19:47] YOU'RE ON NEUTRAL GROUND, YOU'RE ALREADY
[19:49] ON THE DEVIL'S SIDE CUZ GOD don't have
[19:51] you on no neutral ground.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; You got to stand on one side AND THE
[19:57] OTHER. SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL MAN UP AND
[19:59] STAND UP AND FIGHT.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. B DECIDE WHOSE POWER, WHO
[20:05] IS GOING TO CONTROL YOU BECAUSE THAT'S
[20:07] THE GREAT CONFLICT IS NOT IN HEAVEN
[20:10] ANYMORE. AMEN. It's not in Eden anymore.
[20:13] AMEN. IT'S IN HUMANITY NOW. THAT'S WHERE
[20:16] THE BATTLE COMES. JUST LIKE NORTH KOREA,
[20:18] JUST LIKE VIETNAM, WE WERE FIGHTING
[20:20] COMMUNISM. FIGHTING COMMUNISM.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? I THINK IN THE KOREAN
[20:25] WAR AND NORTH KOREAN WAR, I'm not sure
[20:27] WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE. I THINK AROUND
[20:28] 67,000 OF OUR SOLDIERS gave their lives
[20:31] and lost.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Huh.
[20:35] Had to get out of there. It's either
[20:36] Vietnam or Korea. One of those. Amen.
[20:40] Sad, ain't it, to think, oh my thought,
[20:44] IT'S TERRIBLE. IT'S TERRIBLE TO LOSE WAR
[20:46] BECAUSE EVERYBODY THAT FOUGHT AND DIED
[20:49] AND FOUGHT FOR NOTHING.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Died simply for trying.
[20:55] That's why you want to die and fight for
[20:56] a good cause.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But anyway, SO THAT'S THE WAY IT
[21:01] IS. THEY USE THEY USE THESE CONVENTIONS.
[21:04] They use those people. THEY WOULD ARM
[21:06] THE VIETNAMESE. THEY WOULD ARM NORTH
[21:08] KOREA. THEY WOULD OR SOUTH KOREA. THEY
[21:10] WOULD ARM THEM. THEY WOULD EVEN ACTUALLY
[21:11] GO IN THERE AND MAYBE PUT AMERICAN
[21:14] soldiers in there. BUT IF THEY WOULDN'T
[21:15] have to, they wouldn't.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; But let me TELL YOU SOMETHING. GOD AND
[21:19] THE DEVIL ARE AT CONFLICT with one
[21:21] another today. Amen.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; This morning
[21:26] &gt;&gt; right here in this church
[21:29] &gt;&gt; that's right.

[21:32] &gt;&gt; Nobody else maybe can hear, but we do
[21:35] get it on where people listening.
[21:39] You're in a battle, brother.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; And you're on one side or you're on the
[21:44] other.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's only two.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. every disorder, everything
[21:51] that comes along, it's either controlled
[21:53] by God's power or Satan's power because
[21:56] that's the only two powers there is. And
[21:58] if that gets the power of life and the
[22:01] power of death, there's only two. Amen.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Satan's power, his
[22:08] power is got, he's a perverted power of
[22:10] God. It isn't no real power. IT'S A
[22:13] PERVERSION OF GOD'S POWER.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord. Amen. How many
[22:19] believes that listening? We're sitting
[22:20] today here and one or the other power is
[22:24] going to control us.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; So, LET'S CAST THE EVIL ONE OUT. HOW
[22:29] MANY THINGS THAT YOU and I have made to
[22:33] cast out?
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.

[22:43] power. I want to be able to witness in
[22:45] my heart. Yeah. That's right. I don't
[22:47] know what you're talking about, but
[22:49] there are thousand.
[22:51] The devil's power AIN'T GOT NO POWER IN
[22:53] ME ANYMORE. WHY? Because the power of
[22:55] the Holy Ghost is up in the earth.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to pull you over on the
[23:02] fire of depression. Amen. And a big old
[23:04] long face and sadness, DEPRESSION, FEAR,
[23:08] AND ANXIETY. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
[23:10] WE'VE GOT A BIGGER HOME. WE'VE GOT A
[23:12] BIGGER ROCK AND WE GOT A BIGGER POWER to
[23:14] be a jerk TEAM OUT THERE. YOU GET
[23:17] CONFESSED, DEVIL, BECAUSE you're not,
[23:19] you have sin. And if you have guilt,
[23:22] you're the ONE UNDER CONDEMNATION. DON'T
[23:24] PULL me over on your condemnation.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Don't pull me over in the sin and
[23:28] depression. [applause]
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[23:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not just here to be a wall.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; I'm here to send the DEVIL WHERE HE'S
[23:54] SUPPOSED TO BE. UNDER my feet.

[24:55] 100% successful.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. in his ambition.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; In his DESIRE OF WHAT HE WANTED. That's
[25:04] &gt;&gt; right.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; He has succeeded.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; That's why I wanted this kind of online.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; I'll be glad people need to hear this.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:29] Satan's now he said THAT HE WOULD EXALT
[25:32] HIMSELF ABOVE THE MOST high that he
[25:36] would ex ascend above the clouds and THE
[25:39] STARS
[25:40] THAT HE would sit there LIKE GOD AND BE
[25:43] ABOVE THE MOST HIGH.
[25:46] He has succeeded
[25:50] around say he has succeeded in carrying
[25:55] out his strengths.
[25:57] HE HAS CERTAINLY HAD A marvelous
[25:59] [screaming]
[26:00] success. [sighs]
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Don't do that much.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Right. HE'S HAD A MARVELOUS SUCCESS,
[26:12] brother Ram SAYS, IN CARRYING
[26:14] [screaming] OUT HIS threats
[26:18] by the people letting him explain away
[26:21] in every age the value of God's promised
[26:24] word to that age.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, he says, "Satan has
[26:32] succeeded in perverting and taking over
[26:36] this world and making it his kingdom
[26:39] that men was put on here by free agency,
[26:42] the Jews."
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; See, you notice the people, they exalt
[26:51] him above all that's called God. Didn't
[26:54] Thessalonians say that they would? the
[26:57] authority of a denominational church to
[26:59] people believing that denomination more
[27:02] than they believe God
[27:06] &gt;&gt; and GOD IS HIS WORD. THEY'LL BELIEVE
[27:08] THEIR DENOMINATION or creed above the
[27:10] word which exalts him above all that's
[27:13] called God. And there's only one God and
[27:16] that's the word.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[27:21] SO HE AS GOD SITS IN THE CHURCH OF GOD
[27:23] proving that he is God because he's got
[27:25] the people worshiping him. See God is
[27:28] the WORD AND HE EXALTS HIMSELF ABOVE ALL
[27:31] THAT'S CALLED GOD. AMEN.
[27:35] See the God of this age has exalted
[27:37] himself above the true vindicated word
[27:41] of God. Above all is CALLED GOD SO THAT
[27:44] HE HAS SITS IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD. AMEN.
[27:48] TEMPLE OF GOD WITH AUTHORITY. milk and
[27:51] he's praised for it. Oh, let the people
[27:54] of people God see that reception. He is
[27:57] praised for it AND SOLEMNLY BELIEVED BY
[28:00] THE PEOPLE OF THIS EVIL AGE. NOW, do you
[28:04] see the God of this and his servants of
[28:06] this evil age? Oh my.
[28:12] Listen, now let's watch it be
[28:14] manifested. He says he's making a better
[28:17] world for them to live in by his
[28:19] knowledge apart from the never failing
[28:21] word of God. But by his coming together
[28:23] in denominational and creeds and
[28:25] intellectual and science and so forth,
[28:28] he says he says he's making a better
[28:29] world for men to live in and ignoring
[28:32] the promise of God, then the only time
[28:35] the world will be fit in to live in is
[28:36] in the millennium. It's my opinion. He's
[28:38] making the world better world to sin in.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice what he did. illegalized
[28:45] sin, whiskey drinking, cigarette smoke
[28:48] them. Church has legalized women can be
[28:49] a member of their church with short
[28:51] hair. Oh, may I stop here a minute? She
[28:54] can wear shorts and wear paints and
[28:56] still long as fruit, WHICH IS CONTRARY
[28:59] TO THE WORD OF GOD. HE SAYS IT'S ALL
[29:01] RIGHT TO KNOW. What's that got to do
[29:03] with the just the same as the FORBIDDEN
[29:05] FRUIT IN THE BIBLE? She believes him.
[29:08] She loves him for it. Oh, I like this
[29:10] church. They let me do this and they
[29:12] don't let me do that. A preacher, he
[29:14] never preaches on Amen. Women wearing
[29:16] pants, wearing make preacher never
[29:19] preaches on those things.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's exactly
[29:24] right.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, people.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, they like it. They like being able
[29:29] to go to church in their pants and their
[29:31] shorts and their everything else.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe it's Satan's
[29:36] eating?
[29:37] &gt;&gt; He's eating it.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for something real good?
[29:43] AND THEN A LOT of times the devil the
[29:45] devil beats us. He loves us.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been defeated out of
[29:53] &gt;&gt; heaven?
[29:55] Let me shake your hand and get heaven.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; He tries to beat you every day.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Try to knock you out here. Knock you
[30:03] down there. HE'LL KNOCK [screaming] YOU
[30:04] DOWN. YOU GET DEFEATED ONCE.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; I can do a flip right now. Amen.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; He might WIN THE BATTLE. SOMETIMES he
[30:16] wins many battles.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M HERE to tell you, he won't win
[30:21] the war.
[30:23] Where the war
[30:26] I lose, but I'll get back up and I'm
[30:29] going to fight you. And I know how this
[30:31] war ends.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; And it ends UP WITH ME HAVING THE
[30:36] VICTORY. You having the victory.

[30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I love about it.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Sure, he wins battles.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; You'd be stupid, ignorant, not to say
[30:49] this to say, you know, he does.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; But this war ain't over.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; This battle is over.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; He whooped Samson.
[31:04] They wrapped your eye on the Philistines
[31:06] and they whooped him.
[31:09] Yeah.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Booked him. That's why he was there IN
[31:13] THE GRINDING MILL. HIS EYES GOUCHED out
[31:16] going around to the ground day after day
[31:18] after day. That's right.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; God helping somebody this morning is
[31:23] enough for y'all. Man, the devil got me

[35:01] So, you won this one.
[35:04] You won this round. But I want to tell

[35:08] The Lord said to the serpent, "Because
[35:10] thou has done this, thou art cursed
[35:12] above all cattle and above all beasts of
[35:14] the field."
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.

[36:54] ready. HIS SOLDIERS READY.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD that he gave us every
[36:59] message that he g us.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's the armor. It's the
[37:03] shield. IT'S A SWORD
[37:06] in there.
[37:12] Perfect.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Put on the whole armor of God. WE GOT
[37:17] THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. We got a nuke.
[37:25] We don't have to just boot the devil.
[37:27] Come on.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Uhoh. Here we go. Boo devil. Boo devil.
[37:33] Boo devil.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Let it get smaller and smaller and
[37:39] smaller. You know what I like to do? I
[37:41] like the wood. But what I like to do
[37:43] better is brother Bam says that we have
[37:46] got an atomic bomb.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; We don't have just some little 22 rifle.
[37:52] We ain't just got no machines on
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Like the North Korean leader. What's his
[38:02] name?
[38:05] Anyway, he said, "I've got I've got a
[38:08] butt. I've got a nuke button." Trump, I
[38:11] got a nuke butt.
[38:13] You remember that? What did Trump say?
[38:16] He says, "Yeah, he might have one, but I
[38:20] got a bigger one.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Works
[38:25] out.
[38:27] He got a box, but I
[38:30] work
[38:32] [applause]
[38:40] him. I want to see the hide in the I
[38:43] want TO SEE THE FELATE."
[38:45] AMEN.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; I see LUKEWARMNESS DISINTEGRATE. I see
[38:49] depression disintegrate. [cheering]
[38:52] [applause]
[38:57] &gt;&gt; From
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; What are we doing? I don't know about
[39:09] you, but I'm enjoying my God-given
[39:14] privileges. Thank you, Jesus.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Having the devil under my feet.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Having Satan under my feet. Having fear
[39:22] under my feet.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Having worried.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Good worry. Brother, I like that. I
[39:34] wrote that down.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; You that want to be successful, he wants
[39:40] you to be successful.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. God wants you to be successful.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that what he told uh
[39:46] David, not David, but Joshua,
[39:49] &gt;&gt; meditate day and night, then thou shalt
[39:52] have good success.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Even better said, God doesn't want his
[39:57] children going around dark, hot, down
[39:59] hardened.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; He don't want you ALL SAD. GOD LOVES TO
[40:03] HAVE YOU HAPPY.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Don't you love it
[40:06] &gt;&gt; when your children are happy?
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my skip around and happy and
[40:11] all might just happen. That's how you
[40:12] want your children.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; That's how God wants you.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; And we're living a time that we live up
[40:19] to our God-given privileges
[40:21] &gt;&gt; of having Satan under our feet.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; God is more powerful than the devil.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. I love Samson's comeback.
[40:30] Don't you?
[40:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. He was there for a while.
[40:32] He was defeated, but this war was not
[40:35] over. Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Jehoshaphat when the
[40:42] enemies wrote him a letter. Don't you
[40:43] trust your God? All these other nations
[40:45] trusted in their God and I defeated
[40:47] them. Best for you to surrender.
[40:51] Amen. Now Joseph I believe wasn't
[40:53] dressed in Santa Claus and ashes and
[40:55] call upon God. God said don't you worry.
[40:58] Amen. These enemies that you got
[40:59] tomorrow is going to be gone. And
[41:01] overnight I believe that one ANGEL
[41:03] KILLED 70,000 MEN OR SO.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; One angel goes through the temp.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; These two powers this contest has raged
[41:18] on for a very long time already.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a few stories this
[41:29] morning.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[41:33] &gt;&gt; all the way back in uh if you want to go
[41:36] Exodus, if you want to pull it up, you
[41:38] can. Exodus 14. I don't know if I gave
[41:41] you this one or not. Maybe
[41:43] Exodus 14,
[41:48] remember when Pharaoh and the Egyptians,
[41:54] man, were marching, coming after Israel
[41:56] after they were stuck in the Red Sea.
[41:59] They got down there to a dead end,
[42:01] didn't they?
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Daryl, after all,
[42:15] I just want to say this.
[42:19] Whatever you do, make sure you're not on
[42:22] the wrong side.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Make sure you're not on the wrong side.
[42:28] Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're in the on the wrong side,
[42:32] &gt;&gt; you're in for real disappointment,
[42:35] &gt;&gt; defeat.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many know that Judas went over
[42:39] to the wrong side?
[42:40] &gt;&gt; He was on the right SIDE FOR A WHILE,
[42:42] BUT THE DEVIL GOT INTO IT. The devil had
[42:44] been put into the heart of Judas, his
[42:47] right. He went over to the enemy's side.
[42:49] WHAT DID HE END UP DOING? AMEN. WANTED
[42:51] TO MAKE SOME MONEY.
[42:57] And he ended up being so miserable he
[43:00] went and hung himself.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Bows gushed out. Hung himself. He was so
[43:05] miserable. He ended up in defeat.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:11] But Moses, if you'll notice in chapter
[43:14] 14, and we'll begin with verse
[43:18] 12. Well, let's go 11. And they said
[43:21] unto Moses, "Because there was no graves
[43:23] in Egypt, has thou taken us and died in
[43:25] the wilderness? Wherefore hast thou
[43:27] dealt thus with us to carry us forth
[43:30] from Egypt?
[43:33] Is it is not this the word that we did
[43:37] tell thee in Egypt, saying, "Let us
[43:38] alone that we may serve the Egyptians,
[43:42] for it had been better for us to serve
[43:44] the Egyptians than that we should die in
[43:46] the wilderness."
[43:48] Amen. What a what a terrible thing for
[43:50] them to say.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; And Moses said unto the people, "Fear
[43:54] not. Fear you not.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; How many pleasure when you're a child of
[43:58] [screaming] God,
[43:59] &gt;&gt; you got to get the fear out.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Get the fear out.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And stand still.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; And see the salvation of the Lord.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Which he will show you today. For the
[44:16] Egyptians whom ye have seen today, you
[44:19] shall see them again no more forever.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. [clears throat]
[44:25] WHY? BECAUSE THE LORD, VERSE 14, THE
[44:28] LORD SHALL FIGHT for you
[44:31] &gt;&gt; and [applause] you shall hold your hand.
[44:33] So just sit back and watching.
[44:38] That's what we got to do.
[44:44] And every aspect of our lives, it's not
[44:47] your fight. It's [screaming]
[44:49] [cheering]
[44:50] not a devil.
[44:53] Yes.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only way we God has never
[44:56] lost, but man loses when they get away
[44:58] from God.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Eve lost once you got away from the
[45:01] word.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; You get out from away from God and
[45:04] you're going to lose.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; You're going to lose. You fight God and
[45:15] his people.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; You better be very
[45:19] &gt;&gt; worried.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:22] You see, think about he said, "Stand
[45:25] still and see the salvation." You know
[45:27] what brother preach? Stand still. We get
[45:30] so anxious about things. Troubles comes
[45:32] our way, we get so anxious, we get
[45:34] upset. We get disturbed.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; But you got to just hold still.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; The battle belongs to the Lord.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Your battles belong to the Lord, people.
[45:48] Another
[45:51] one in Deuteronomy.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 1.
[45:59] We'll start with 27
[46:02] [sighs] when he came up to Kish Barnea
[46:05] after all that God had done for him.
[46:07] Ain't that right?
[46:10] Verse 27. and you murmured in your tents
[46:12] and said, "Because the Lord hated us, he
[46:14] hath brought us forth from the land of
[46:16] Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the
[46:18] Amorites to destroy us. Whether shall we
[46:21] go up? Our brethren have discouraged our
[46:24] heart." Remember, they came back with
[46:26] evil report.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The people is greater and taller
[46:31] than we. The cities are great and walled
[46:33] up to heaven. And all that we have seen
[46:36] there, the sons of Ana there. Amen. But
[46:41] like cancer, cancer likes to scare the
[46:43] liver out of us
[46:45] &gt;&gt; or these other diseases. Don't let it
[46:47] scare you. It might look bigger. Oh, I'm
[46:49] going to die. Don't you be believe.
[46:51] Amen. That that devil is bigger than
[46:53] God. I don't care how big he is.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; The sons of Anoch are there. Then said I
[46:59] unto you, dread not neither be afraid of
[47:02] them. THE LORD YOUR GOD FORTH before
[47:05] you. He shall fight for you.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. or according to all he did for you
[47:10] in Egypt before your eyes. He's the one
[47:14] that turned the water into blood. He's
[47:15] the one that brought fleas and made the
[47:17] Egyptians miserable. He's the one that
[47:20] did it. I want you to know, aren't you
[47:21] thankful? When you come through a trial,
[47:23] when you come to the tribulation, God
[47:25] has brought you through just commit
[47:28] yourself to God. Whatever you're going
[47:30] through, God going to take you through.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Why? because he fights your battles for
[47:37] you.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; OH, THOMAS B IS A WITNESS THAT GOD
[47:41] fights my battles for me.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; He fights you. He takes you to
[47:50] &gt;&gt; get your grubby hands out of it.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Can't stand Christians that's going to
[47:54] try to make the church this, try to do
[47:56] this and that and the other move things
[47:57] around. Why don't you follow the
[47:59] leadership of the Holy Ghost? Get your
[48:01] grubby hands out of it.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Quit making the mess out of things.
[48:04] Amen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Get your hands off of your own life.
[48:12] Why? Because your life is not your own
[48:14] anymore. The life that we now live, we
[48:16] lived by the faith of the son of God.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:25] I like that he goes before you. Amen.
[48:30] Like he did do, he'll do again.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, here we go. Another good one.
[48:36] I'm just going to mention this one.
[48:39] Well,
[48:41] maybe not. There was a day when the sons
[48:45] of God came to present themselves before
[48:46] the Lord, and Satan came also among
[48:49] them. And the Lord said unto Satan,
[48:51] "Where comest thou?" And Satan answered
[48:53] the Lord, "From going to and fro ON THE
[48:55] EARTH, AND FROM WALKING up and down in
[48:57] it."
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Satan's like a roaring lion walking
[49:01] about. What? seeking whom he may devour.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; That's what he does.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; I like it. Here the devil is in the
[49:11] congregation sitting.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Maybe he's sitting right there watching
[49:18] Danny. Brother Danny Julie. Maybe he
[49:21] turns back and looks at Brian.
[49:23] Sister Mildred looks at you looking at
[49:27] everybody.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Wonder who I can devour.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Uh oh.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Wonder what who's having a problem.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[49:37] &gt;&gt; who's having the issue?
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Who's having the feelings? This, that,
[49:40] or the other.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Right. And
[49:42] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden, the Lord says, "Hey,
[49:43] devil.
[49:45] Hey, devil.
[49:47] How you doing, buddy?
[49:50] &gt;&gt; We've had a conflict for a very long
[49:51] time now, haven't we? We've been at each
[49:53] other for a long time. What you been
[49:56] doing?" Oh, I've been going to and for
[49:58] the earth. Amen.
[50:01] He said, "Well, how about that?" Walking
[50:03] up and down and Lord said to Satan, "Has
[50:06] that considered my servant Joe?
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Look at him OVER THERE. LOOK AT HIM BACK
[50:13] THERE. LOOK AT MY SERVANT." HUH?
[50:16] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; I believe that the devil's looking at
[50:20] you.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Devil's looking at you.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Sure is.
[50:26] I WONDER IF GOD could say that about us.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Have you considered my servant Tommy?
[50:31] Have you considered my servant Urban, my
[50:33] daughter Martha? Paul, Daniel, have you
[50:37] considered Troy?
[50:41] Oh, he considered Troy.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, he sure did.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; God says go out.
[50:51] Devil went at him.
[50:54] Devil went out at most of us.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know. There's
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Caleb,
[51:01] Lisa,
[51:04] Deon, since all you young Christians, be
[51:08] ready.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; You're still young Christians.
[51:12] God may put you through something. I
[51:13] hope you don't. But every Sunday comes
[51:16] to God. You come to the place to where
[51:17] you want to give up
[51:19] &gt;&gt; or you don't know which way you go.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right,
[51:23] &gt;&gt; folks. It'll bring you get to the place
[51:25] sometimes where you get TO THE PLACE YOU
[51:27] DON'T REALLY KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO. YOU
[51:29] KNOW WHAT TO DO. You just stand still.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Just stand still. JUST BE STILL. WATCH.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; MAY NOT happen overnight. The overnight
[51:40] healing and deliverance is easy.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Troy went for A LONG TIME AND
[51:44] IT'S BAD.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; I went 10 years.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Many years.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. my battle.
[51:55] Boy, you don't want to hear it again,
[51:56] but I'mma say it. I had that song. How
[51:59] long? How long? How long? How long till
[52:03] the end of this valley?
[52:05] That was my favorite song. It encourages
[52:07] me to keep pressing down this alley. I
[52:10] was reading yesterday. I was studying
[52:11] this and the and the Israelites, you
[52:14] know, they were camped up on the on the
[52:16] mountain. Amen. and they'd come down and
[52:19] uh and fight the Philistines in the
[52:21] valley. So that is the the Philistines
[52:24] withdrew and they went back and said,
[52:27] "Let them come down to THE VALLEY
[52:28] BECAUSE THEIR GOD IS THE GOD OF THE
[52:30] MOUNTAIN, not of the valley." And so God
[52:34] said to the prophet, I BELIEVE IT WAS
[52:36] SAID, "NOW NOW YOU GO AHEAD AND GO DOWN
[52:38] IN THE VALLEY BECAUSE BECAUSE WHAT?
[52:40] BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT I'M the God of
[52:42] the mountain, not of the valley."
[52:45] [screaming]
[52:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [cheering]
[52:51] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[52:56] &gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; He's got everywhere.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; He got it. No matter what your situation
[53:01] is,
[53:04] &gt;&gt; I like to stay cold, but that excites
[53:06] me.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; To think that no matter what your
[53:08] situation is,
[53:10] &gt;&gt; he's the God.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; That takes us through. All right.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; We ought to be the most excited people
[53:16] on the face of the earth. We [cheering]
[53:17] ought to be the happiest people on the
[53:19] face of earth.
[53:21] That is
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering]
[53:28] [applause]
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me
[53:36] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] This is one place that God challenged
[53:42] the devil. Is that right?
[53:46] Oh my.
[53:50] Boy, Job went through it.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; But God gave him a revelation
[53:58] that though the skin worms destroy my
[54:00] flesh,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; yet in my flesh I shall see my God.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; My redeemer liveth.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And I know in the last days I shall see
[54:07] him.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know. He said, let preach your
[54:11] message on I know.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; How many knows?
[54:15] &gt;&gt; I know that I know that I know.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost. I know. So,
[54:22] now I hope so.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe so. So, so no, I know so.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; God [screaming] knew before he ever made
[54:32] that challenge to the devil. Wouldn't it
[54:35] have been sad? It'd be kind of a sad
[54:37] story if Job would have been defeated.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the end of this story?
[54:42] Job finally says after his wife says,
[54:44] "Why don't you just curse God and die?"
[54:45] Because the devil said, "Man, I'll make
[54:48] him curse you to your face."
[54:50] You know, you know, you take everything
[54:52] from him that you bless him with, take
[54:54] the hedge away.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Let anything go wrong that can't go
[54:59] wrong for a longer period of time.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; I know.
[55:06] and he'll curse you to your face. It was
[55:08] so miserable and so terrible until his
[55:10] wife said, "Why don't you just go ahead
[55:11] and curse God and die?"
[55:18] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you the devil was standing
[55:22] right there by his wife.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; You're standing right there. What's he
[55:25] going to say?
[55:26] &gt;&gt; What's he going to say?
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Why don't you curse God and die?
[55:30] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:33] Say it. Say it. I'm a woke God. I'm a
[55:35] woke him.
[55:38] That's right. I told him that I may cuss
[55:40] him to the face. Say
[55:45] to the Lord, "Come on. Come on. Pull him
[55:48] over with that depression.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; You're so miserable. Just come on and
[55:52] say it. Come over to my side.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Just do what I want you to do."
[55:57] &gt;&gt; But Job says you like a fool as you
[56:03] &gt;&gt; woman.
[56:06] Oh baby say baby he was nice honey you
[56:09] speak like a woman huh said woman you
[56:14] speak well he didn't say woman first the
[56:17] scriptures he said thou speakst like you
[56:22] know brother said that he didn't call
[56:23] her a foolish woman
[56:25] &gt;&gt; right
[56:25] &gt;&gt; he didn't call her a foolish woman now
[56:27] you sisters would have probably took it
[56:29] that way call me a foolish
[56:32] said that uh you No, he didn't. He says,
[56:35] "You've talked like one."
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Like,
[56:38] &gt;&gt; he said, "Speak like one."
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he said, "Thou speakest." I
[56:44] can see the pull. I can see the road
[56:46] coming. Don't you? AMEN. THE DEVIL
[56:48] DRAGON. OH, MAN.
[56:52] PRESS.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's where we want the
[56:55] devil to drive and defeat it. [applause]
[56:59] We want it. We want it.
[57:03] We don't want it happening. We don't
[57:05] want it dancing. We don't want you
[57:06] camped.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; We want the pillars to come down and
[57:11] crush your belts.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; To torment you, take your eyes out, try
[57:17] to take your joy away from you.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; When you go out those buildings, when
[57:22] you go to work, the devil will go to
[57:24] work and try to get you a frown on your
[57:26] face
[57:27] &gt;&gt; to depress you. Yeah.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; To bring fear upon you. Oh, am I going
[57:31] to make the rapture? Am I really
[57:33] forgiven for this or for that or the
[57:34] other? Hello. Is my sins really erased?
[57:38] Is my past gone? You trying to do
[57:40] everything he can,
[57:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Get in behind me, devil. You belong back
[57:45] there and down here.
[57:54] Now, let's look at a case where and how
[57:58] many knows it didn't end so well for
[57:59] Lindell.
[58:01] Nope. He was defeated.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:06] This little conflict ended up with God.
[58:12] Now, let's talk about the devil
[58:14] challenging God.
[58:17] How about the devil challenging God? in
[58:20] the story. One of my favorite stories,
[58:22] baby.
[58:27] Let me see here.
[58:32] I think it's way back here. Chapter 17,
[58:34] first Samuel. It says, "And the
[58:36] Philistines said, I defy the armies of
[58:42] Israel this day.
[58:44] Give me a man that we may fight
[58:47] together.
[58:49] When Saul and all Israel heard those
[58:51] words of the Philistines, they were
[58:53] dismayed and greatly afraid. I believe
[58:57] brother Ron Spencer many times takes his
[58:58] Philistines, this big old giant as being
[59:00] like a cancer trying to intimidate you.
[59:04] You ain't going to get healed of this.
[59:06] This is too big for you.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Huh? Well, of course it is for you, but
[59:11] with God, it's just Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Saul and Israel heard these words of the
[59:23] Philist. They were dismayed and greatly
[59:26] afraid. Now, how many know that? That's
[59:28] one thing THAT GOD TOLD JOSHUA NOT TO
[59:30] BE. DON'T BE DISMAYED. Don't fear. I
[59:34] will be with you.
[59:36] That's
[59:36] &gt;&gt; right.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Oh, if you're
[59:39] surrendered to God the way you should
[59:41] be, you put him first day and night and
[59:43] you put him first in everything, you
[59:46] don't have to be afraid.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; If you get away from God and if you
[59:49] don't stay in line with God, you have
[59:51] reason to believe that you can perhap
[59:54] easily be defeated.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to tack him up.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Not that he won't let you He will He'll
[1:00:01] bring you around again if you're his
[1:00:02] child again. I'm not talking about being
[1:00:04] lost, but you talk about letting the
[1:00:06] devil come loose on you.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; You backslide. Brother says, "You'll
[1:00:10] pay."
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Turn the devil loose on make you make
[1:00:12] you so miserable, you'll come running
[1:00:14] back. Say, "God, what's the problem with
[1:00:16] me?
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, forgive me."
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; How many would say, "Lord, do it. DO IT
[1:00:23] TO ME. IF I get back to you, if I get
[1:00:25] away FROM ME, YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
[1:00:27] You bring me back."
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; You hear Aaron? Aaron back there
[1:00:37] raising. Amen. That's right. Why? Cuz
[1:00:39] that's what he did for a bit.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; We're thankful to have him back in
[1:00:42] church, aren't we?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:00:49] Amen. We love y'all's family. Remember
[1:00:51] that. Don't let the devil tell you any
[1:00:52] different.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Okay.
[1:00:58] So let's look at this challenge. 95. Oh
[1:01:02] boy. Shouldn't have said it.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't have done it.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:09] Then a lot happened. Of course, David
[1:01:10] was sent down there and he went to Saul
[1:01:12] and you know, and he told him the story
[1:01:15] of his keeping his father's sheep and
[1:01:16] all that. He tried all the armor on.
[1:01:19] Amen. Many good lessons there. But he
[1:01:21] tried all the armor on. Saul scientific
[1:01:24] knowledge and understanding and so
[1:01:26] forth. No.
[1:01:33] But he says, "Let me go with what I have
[1:01:35] proved."
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; LET ME GO WITH WHAT I KNOW WORKS.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I like that. Don't you? I like to
[1:01:43] use what works. Let me read here. And
[1:01:46] the Philistines said to David, "Come to
[1:01:48] me.
[1:01:50] I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of
[1:01:53] the air, and to the beast of the field.
[1:01:58] So we have a conversation now between
[1:02:00] Goliath and God's man David.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Philine says, "I'm feeding your flesh to
[1:02:08] the beasts of the field."
[1:02:10] David said,
[1:02:13] "Oh, really?"
[1:02:15] Remember, he was this crowny little guy.
[1:02:16] Maybe he had a speaking voice. I don't
[1:02:18] know.
[1:02:22] said, "Thou comest to me with a sword,
[1:02:24] and with a spear, and with a shield, and
[1:02:28] with a baby sounding voice,
[1:02:32] scared the liver out of anybody."
[1:02:34] Well, I'm not much to look at.
[1:02:37] I'm little puny. All right,
[1:02:40] I'm ready,
[1:02:42] brother. Call him a shrimp. Little
[1:02:44] [clears throat] shrimp of a f.
[1:02:47] Yeah. Come with me at me with a sword
[1:02:50] and a shield.
[1:02:52] But I come to you in the [screaming]
[1:02:54] Lord of all. [applause]
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; It's not me THAT
[1:03:04] this morning. It's not you.
[1:03:09] [applause]
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] I come to you in the name of the Lord of
[1:03:15] hosts,
[1:03:17] the God of the armies of Israel.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. whom thou has defiled.
[1:03:24] This day will the Lord listen. This day
[1:03:28] will the Lord.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that. David put the Lord
[1:03:35] first.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; TODAY [screaming]
[1:03:39] I'M GOING TO USE MY skills and I'm going
[1:03:41] to bring you down
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; so that I can be a hero.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; No, no,
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; no.
[1:03:48] He said, "This day the Lord will deliver
[1:03:52] thee
[1:03:54] into my hand."
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And I will smite thee
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; and take thy head from thee, and I'll
[1:04:02] give the carcasses of the hosts of the
[1:04:07] Philistines this day unto the fowls of
[1:04:11] the air.
[1:04:13] In other words, they're going to come on
[1:04:14] down to all of you guys that are killed.
[1:04:16] And the crows are going to have
[1:04:18] themselves a nice eyeball supper.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; They going to feast on them eyeballs.
[1:04:31] [screaming]
[1:04:33] They
[1:04:36] taste so good.
[1:04:40] That's right. Listen to the fowls of the
[1:04:43] air and to the wild beasts of the field
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; and all that on the earth may know that
[1:04:52] there is a God in heaven.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Don't you like that?
[1:05:03] AND SO THERE'S GOD IN THE MIDST of
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like what I heard brother man say
[1:05:09] the other day and then the church that
[1:05:11] leads to the signs and the wonders and
[1:05:13] God performing miracles and all the new
[1:05:15] things that HE'S DOING. HE SAYS THAT
[1:05:16] BEYOND THE CHURCH YOU WANT to
[1:05:20] [applause and cheering]
[1:05:21] use that we want to church
[1:05:25] around
[1:05:27] for church and miracles pass
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; God only did it through brother Brandon
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; no
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; he don't do it anymore
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; no
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; aren't you glad you belong to the church
[1:05:42] of God
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; not this church,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; but to the church of God. Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; You've been born again by the Holy
[1:05:49] Spirit.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; This church of God is a universal
[1:05:52] church. This is just a part of that
[1:05:54] body.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; It's a universal body.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:03] I hope I don't forget my ending. All
[1:06:06] right.
[1:06:08] That's right.
[1:06:15] that there is a God in Israel. And all
[1:06:19] this assembly also shall know
[1:06:23] that the Lord saveth not by your wisdom
[1:06:25] and by your smarts and by your
[1:06:27] intellectual
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; and by you making it happen. No, that's
[1:06:31] not how God does things. HE DON'T SAY
[1:06:34] WITH THE SWORD AND THE SPEAR, FOR THE
[1:06:37] battle is the Lord's.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] [applause]
[1:06:42] The battle is the Lord's. The battle is
[1:06:47] the Lord's. The battle belongs to the
[1:06:49] Lord.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Stand back. Stand still and watch God
[1:06:55] work.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Let's watch God.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; You just be so surrendered to God
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; that you can have 100% confidence
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; that you ain't got to worry about it.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; God do that. Whatsoever we ask in his
[1:07:08] name, he will
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; do it.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] For the battle belongs to the Lord.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we all ready? Let me just read
[1:07:21] the rest of it. We got to read the
[1:07:22] story, can't we?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; And he will give you into our hands, he
[1:07:28] told him.
[1:07:30] Let this assembly know. So apparently he
[1:07:34] was still talking to the Philistines. Is
[1:07:37] that right?
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; And he will give you because he's
[1:07:40] talking here to this guy. Amen. I'll
[1:07:44] feed you to the thous of the air. Let
[1:07:46] all this assembly know. Let all the let
[1:07:48] the enemy know that God doesn't save by,
[1:07:52] you know, by sword and shield.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many know is that Israel and
[1:07:56] the Egyptians poor poor Pharaoh? All in
[1:08:00] his army drowned in the sea.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; They thought their spears and their
[1:08:04] chariots and all. No, God just had him
[1:08:06] come on in.
[1:08:08] Come on in.
[1:08:12] Maybe Moses was saying, "Come, come,
[1:08:15] come on. You think you can do what we do
[1:08:17] with the God that we serve?"
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; No. [clears throat]
[1:08:20] the seven sons of SA remember they
[1:08:22] thought they could he cast out devils
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; you know because the believer Paul could
[1:08:26] no no
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; don't try to follow Amen
[1:08:31] and it came to pass when the Philistine
[1:08:32] arose and came and drew nigh to meet
[1:08:34] David hast ran towards the army to meet
[1:08:36] the Philistine David put his hand in his
[1:08:38] bed and took fence stone and slang it
[1:08:40] and smoked the Philistine in his
[1:08:42] forehead that the stone sunk into his
[1:08:45] forehead and he fell upon his face to
[1:08:47] the earth so David prevailed over the
[1:08:49] Philist things with a sling and a stone.
[1:08:53] Amen.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to put in there, but God.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God. And smoke the Philistine
[1:09:01] and slew him. But there was not a sword
[1:09:04] in the hand of David.
[1:09:06] Think about this. And David ran and
[1:09:08] stood upon the Philistine and took his
[1:09:10] sword and threw it out of its sheath.
[1:09:12] The giant didn't have chance to draw.
[1:09:15] You talk about quick draw,
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; right? David was quicker. Maybe he's
[1:09:20] coming at him. Philistine looking at
[1:09:22] him. David trying.
[1:09:24] Maybe he was grabbing for his sword.
[1:09:28] Didn't even get it draw. Didn't even get
[1:09:30] his tongue right. How many know that's
[1:09:32] God?
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:09:39] I like that.
[1:09:41] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:44] I like this. And David ran and stood
[1:09:46] upon him and so forth. And he cut off
[1:09:49] his head therewith. When the Philistines
[1:09:51] saw their champion was dead, they fled.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I trust that there's all any
[1:10:00] spirit that is not of God will flee.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; But you've been defeated. Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Not like this. And the men of Israel
[1:10:10] that were scared, remember it says they
[1:10:12] were scared.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. and hindered God. The men
[1:10:15] of Israel arose and shouted.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; How many know? And then after our enemy
[1:10:24] is defeated, after we see him defeated,
[1:10:26] we get the
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; shout.
[1:10:33] [applause]
[1:10:38] [screaming] It's over with. I'm now
[1:10:40] filled with the bapt.
[1:10:43] Amen. I STRUGGLE WITH MYSELF AND I'm
[1:10:45] filled with God's spirit. Hallelujah.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; That battle it out.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; And I've overcome like Abraham did when
[1:10:53] he met me Belchesc and he served in
[1:10:56] fellowship communion.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. info.
[1:11:03] Yeah.
[1:11:05] Brother man said that
[1:11:08] the devil has been had had a marvelous
[1:11:13] success in achieving his goal.
[1:11:20] He's worshiped by millions and billions
[1:11:24] of people.
[1:11:42] I think one of the turning points was
[1:11:44] when brother Brad preached on lean not
[1:11:45] to your own understanding the god of
[1:11:47] this evil age and he had said that
[1:11:50] because they lean to their own
[1:11:51] understanding and they've taken the word
[1:11:53] of a denomination over the word of god
[1:11:56] anything that's anti
[1:11:58] is against Christ.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; It's antichrist.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they had turned him away.
[1:12:05] Brother Bam says here he says and today
[1:12:08] the church world has turned Christ out
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; in these last days.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; How many at one time brother Ben would
[1:12:15] say go into him. Go to church. Find your
[1:12:17] church.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; How many knows later in his ministry
[1:12:19] says come out.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; You can't be part of a demand- made
[1:12:22] denomination be brought to Christ. Come
[1:12:24] out of it. Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; That the enemies come out of it. Why?
[1:12:26] Because of this right here.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Because he as if they have turned him
[1:12:30] out
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; just exactly like the book of Revelation
[1:12:33] says that they would do.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The other day up on the mountain I
[1:12:37] was standing. I said, "Lord, I got one
[1:12:40] open door in the whole nation."
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; I got one open door in the whole nation.
[1:12:46] Remember this is Jesus working through
[1:12:48] brother Ben.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus had one open door in the whole
[1:12:53] nation. And as far as I know, that's
[1:12:55] Phoenix, Arizona. It's the only one that
[1:12:58] I got. And I started down off the
[1:13:01] mountain and just as plain as I ever
[1:13:02] heard anybody speak said, "What's that
[1:13:04] today? Follow thou me."
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Follow me. God wasn't surprised. He knew
[1:13:10] that the Leysia would put him out.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; And they took they went into death.
[1:13:16] Ain't that right? The church world went
[1:13:18] into death. They chose a Barabus
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; instead of Christ.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice the biblical scriptures
[1:13:26] tied themselves together in every age.
[1:13:27] Notice when the church world would not
[1:13:29] have the word of God to rule over them,
[1:13:32] they accepted a murder rabbis. What does
[1:13:34] this do? Notice he's talking about the
[1:13:36] present evil age that we're living. What
[1:13:37] does this do? It exalted Satan, the god
[1:13:39] of this evil age, to the place that he's
[1:13:42] always wanted to be.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, Satan not spoke of being a
[1:13:48] god of any other age, but he is exalted
[1:13:50] to the place that he wants to be. How
[1:13:52] many know this is going to be his world
[1:13:54] for a little bit longer? He's going to
[1:13:57] push you and I out. Amen. That's right.
[1:14:01] Squeeze coming down. Amen. Shutting
[1:14:03] church doors and whatever.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; He's having his fall,
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; A better world to sin in perversion and
[1:14:11] everything else.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; But how many knows tonight that yes, HE
[1:14:16] CAN SAY I HAVE SUCCEEDED.
[1:14:18] I have won.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. THE DEVIL CAN SAY, EVEN THE
[1:14:24] PROPHET SAID IT WAS A MARVELOUS SUCCESS.
[1:14:28] A marvelous success in DECEIVING THE
[1:14:31] WHOLE WORLD. [screaming] The Bible SAYS
[1:14:32] HE TOOK OVER THE WHOLE WORLD.
[1:14:37] But boy, if we was on the internet, we
[1:14:41] would say,
[1:14:42] "But it's not over.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; You have won the war." And not the not
[1:14:48] the one, BUT THE BATTLE. YOU MAY
[1:14:50] [screaming] HAVE GOTTEN WHERE YOU WANT
[1:14:52] TO BE. But you need to read a little
[1:14:54] further
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; cuz I read of the stone that was cut out
[1:14:59] of THE
[1:15:02] Jesus Christ. He's going to come and
[1:15:04] he's going to crush
[1:15:08] devour every nation and he's going to
[1:15:11] come and he's going to take over.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; You and I are going to be with him.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; So let it be known devil. You think you
[1:15:20] succeeded. Yeah, maybe you have. But
[1:15:22] it's going to be a shortlived success.
[1:15:29] shall success
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; cuz the Bible says that the meek
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; shall inherit yours.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; You're going to be defeated. The
[1:15:44] scripture says that we're going to take
[1:15:45] you to the side of the pit. We're going
[1:15:48] to kick you off into the pit.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; We're going to chain you up for a
[1:15:51] thousand years. We're going to have a
[1:15:53] thousand year millennium.
[1:15:56] Yes.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you a whole thousand years
[1:16:01] with Christ. WE OUGHT TO BE EXCITED
[1:16:03] about that.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; How many's looking forward? Oh, I'm
[1:16:05] watching and I'm waiting for the video
[1:16:08] when the Lord should come and take it.
[1:16:09] WAITING RIGHT AWAY.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; OH, HE'S COMING BACK TO earth again.
[1:16:14] Yes, our Lord is coming back to earth
[1:16:16] again.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:22] God bless you this morning.
[1:16:29] Thank you Jesus.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; I just want to say thank you.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; for your goodness Lord to me.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Lord help me to surrender myself to you.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; When I get to places I can't get over, I
[1:16:45] can't get around, I'm really struggling
[1:16:46] with. Just get to your knees and commit
[1:16:50] it to God and say, "God, take me through
[1:16:51] this." And I guarantee you he'll come on
[1:16:53] the scene. Amen. And he'll open up red
[1:16:57] seeds for you.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; He'll quench the violence of fire for
[1:17:01] you. He'll stop the mouths of lions for
[1:17:04] you.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, can I go just for another thought?
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Just a little bit. We only have one, so
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; we uh make it worthwhile.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you when we did have two.
[1:17:19] Nothing wrong with two, but sometime I
[1:17:21] would rather go a little long and just
[1:17:22] get a little bit more. You know, cuz
[1:17:25] otherwise we got to get started again.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; If we get him started, Pence's not
[1:17:28] stopped right away.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; See, what could I say more? For the time
[1:17:39] would fail me of Gideon and Aar and
[1:17:42] Samson and Jeffy, David also, Samuel and
[1:17:45] the prophets. Paul was talking about it,
[1:17:47] right?
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; He was talking about the the faith
[1:17:50] chapter. These great warriors of faith.
[1:17:54] who believed in God and God worked
[1:17:55] through. How many believe these are
[1:17:57] names that are immortal than in the
[1:18:00] Bible?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who through faith subdued
[1:18:05] kingdoms? Moses. Ain't that right? More
[1:18:08] powerful than Pharaoh, wrought
[1:18:11] righteousness, OBTAINED PROMISES,
[1:18:13] STOPPED THE MOUTHS OF LIONS, QUENCHED
[1:18:15] THE BOTTLES OF FIRE, ESCAPED THE EDGE OF
[1:18:17] THE SWORD. OUT OF WEAKNESS WERE MADE
[1:18:19] STRONG. WAXED VALIANT AND FIGHT. TURN TO
[1:18:22] FLIGHT THE ARMIES of the aliens.
[1:18:25] Hallelujah.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; I thought, you know, one of these days
[1:18:28] when we get over there, NO DOUBT THEY'LL
[1:18:31] SAY, "WHAT CAN I SAY MORE? WHAT CAN I
[1:18:34] SAY MORE? LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT HERMAN
[1:18:36] AND MARTH AND TOMMY AND TAMMY." AMEN.
[1:18:39] JOHN AND DEBBIE WAYNE. LET ME TELL YOU
[1:18:40] ABOUT JOE AND HANNAH AND THE battles
[1:18:42] they fought. Look at the warriors they
[1:18:44] are. Look at brother Brian Janette.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; They were quiet.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe your names are
[1:18:51] going to be in heaven?
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; People all of you in the middle of ALL
[1:18:55] OF YOU AND MAY your names be written IN
[1:18:57] HEAVEN AS MIGHTY conquerors who overcome
[1:19:00] Satan by faith in Jesus Christ.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because theirs is written.
[1:19:08] We all have a testimony, don't we?
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Of coming up against the adversary.
[1:19:13] Amen. We have had faced our Goliath.
[1:19:17] We've had to conquer many things. Amen.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; The contest
[1:19:29] goes on.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad to be on the
[1:19:34] winning side?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Nice to be on the winning side.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. We lose a battle or two. We do
[1:19:41] that sometimes. It happens. Nobody's
[1:19:44] perfect. But we get back up.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz guess what? When this war is over,
[1:19:50] guess where the devil's going to be?
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Nonexistent.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; How many believe non-existent?
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; How many believe ALL THOSE THAT SERVE
[1:20:01] THE DEVIL WILL one day become
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; nonist?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. Non-existent.
[1:20:08] Brother said annihilated.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Annihilation means completely gone.
[1:20:16] while you and I
[1:20:18] get rid of our gray hair.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Get rid of our old age.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Get rid of our fearfulness in our old
[1:20:27] age.
[1:20:29] And we'll be in the youth.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that that's not just
[1:20:36] Thomas Ber telling you some fictional
[1:20:38] story, but that's the word of God. And
[1:20:41] in a million years from now, you'll see
[1:20:44] [applause]
[1:20:53] God bless you. We love you all. Amen.
