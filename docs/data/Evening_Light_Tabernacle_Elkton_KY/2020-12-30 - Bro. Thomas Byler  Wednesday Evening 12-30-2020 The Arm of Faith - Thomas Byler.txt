dark wednesday night lord jesus and cause the light to shine lord from your word down into our souls and into our hearts to give us warmth lord jesus and to light the way fathers that we might be able to walk this path that you have set us upon lord jesus and not have to stumble in the darkness that's all around us lord father we ask god the blessed reading of the word the meditation of our heart our gathering together and everything every effort that was made lord to get us together and to assemble together lord may you bless each one father lord and may you look at each heart lord you know what every need is father and and lord you know how to minister just to that need father we ask god that you'll just have the preeminence tonight father we ask in your precious name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will to the book of matthew the book of matthew amen just a little thought tonight for a little bit amen matthew 9. i'd like to go ahead and read three stories three stories the first one is in chapter 9 of matthew verse 20. and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind and touched the hem of his garment for she said within herself if i may but touched his garment i shall be whole but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort that faith has made behold and the woman was made whole from that very hour i think there's another place and one of my must be on one of the other gospels where it said that he said who touched me amen and then the disciple says what he means who touches you everybody's touching you am i right he says no virtue has went from me am i right so anyway uh he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith has made thee whole then in verse 27 and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus said unto them believe ye that i am able to do this they said unto him yea lord then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you and their eyes were opened and jesus straightly charged him saying see that note that you that no man know it what i want you to get from both of these stories is that jesus in both cases told them that it was according to their faith in that right he said thy faith has made the whole he says according to your faith be it unto you amen one more uh over in matthew 15 and 22 matthew 15 and 22 down to verse 28 i believe it is and behold a woman of canaan came out of the coast of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cried after us but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel then came she and worshiped him saying lord help me but he answered and said it's not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee according as thou wilt and that daughter and her daughter was made whole from that very hour may god it is blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight amen tonight i want to speak on faith for a little bit but i called it the arm of faith the arm of faith amen and so i want to read you a quote here actually two quotes to just uh kind of start here said in hebrews the fourth chapter verse 12 it says that the word of god is sharper than a two-edged sword he says now there's only one thing that can hold this sword and that's the hand of faith all right the hand of faith is the only thing that can you can wield he said yield but wield this sword of the word now you might have a weak arm all right you might have a weak arm just enough to pick up for justification you're so weak maybe that's all you can cut through but this sword of the word will cut free every promise that god made in it if they got a good strong arm of faith holding it there amen he says god made the promise and faith holds this sword he says in it'll cut her out of the rock yonder every promise of god can be cut free by the word of god for it's a sword another place he says our faith is an arm our faith is an arm a mighty arm that holds a sharp two-edged sword of god and that sharp true edge his sword will cut out every promise free if that arm of faith is able to yield that sword some people has very weak muscles trouble and they can just maybe cut off a little scratch maybe just enough to join church others can come into justification some can go all the way to the baptism of the holy ghost amen a strong arm holding this bible can cut every promise free that's right so be strong in the lord amen all right you can go home well maybe not quite yet isn't that something to think that amen so i thought about this and that's really what caught my attention and what really brought me to this message and to the thought is what he said about the word of god and what it actually takes and how that some people can just cut a little bit out of it some people can cut more out of it amen but we know that jesus said different places he saw he talked about that one man you know he had a believer he he had uh his son i believe was fixed with the devil and so forth he says you know help them on unbelief because he says no if thou canst believe all things are possible to them that believe amen another place he says with you nothing shall be impossible amen whatsoever things you ask and believe you can help somebody knows it oh my god just keep getting excited already here when you just think it just let it let it stink that into your mind like it is mine right now when you think about this you know because somebody knows that then you can live you can read every book you want you can read every philosopher and all the good stories but this is a book amen and this truly is what we would call the living bible i mean this book is alive it's real it's not fictitious it's not history it's not good philosophy amen god backs his word up and like he said every promise is in here how many knows the rapture is in here heaven is in here everything is in here but it's all according to your faith it's all according to what you can believe as thou has believed so be it unto you i got to thinking about that and i thought about the word of god first of all let me let me read you one more scripture over in ephesians about what the word is okay now the word is the sword it's been found in ephesians 6 and he talks about be strong therefore in the lord and the power of the might in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil the shield of faith you know the sword of the word and all the things that we're to be equipped with and then to properly fight the devil but down in verse 17 just to kind of uh uh you know show you what it what it is he says and take this helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit what is the sword of the spirit because you know if you've got the spirit but no sword you've got to have a sword with this with the spirit and the sword of the spirit spirit because you know what one person sometimes told brother about hey you know if you can believe you know you can touch that post out there and get healed what did he say he said no because that's not according to the word of god it still has to be according to the word amen so you know we could you can believe anything that ain't will make a soul it has to be according to the word of god for god to honor so now here it says take the sword of the spirit which is the word of god the sword of the spirit is the word of god praise the lord so that sword is the word and only uh depending on how big a muscle you have it's how hard you can strike and how much you can cut and what you can receive from god it's all according to your faith and i like that because that stands for every one of us right here now if you want to talk about the power when we talk about the power of the word of god the word of god is quick and it's powerful and it's sharper than any two-edged sword and so forth on down and we know that it was actually in the beginning god spoke and created the heavens and the earth so we know that the word is so powerful that the voice that i have the words that i speak me standing here every bit of that was created by the word of god you are hearing amen breath you're hearing amen something that god created by his word you're standing on what god created everything you look at god created our bodies our minds our hearts everything got everything that was ever created the bible says without him there was nothing created that was created it was all created by the word of god praise the lord so i mean it was it's very very most powerful thing in the universe why do you think over in revelations 19th chapter when he comes back right beyond the heart what do you think written which is called the word of god amen so the word is powerful amen very the most powerful thing in the universe is god's word amen and this is why i say it's living because it's still as alive as it ever was one of these days the skies are going to catch fire the heavens are going to catch on fire all right it says the heavens are going to be on fire the earth is going to melt with fervently the elements of the earth everything's going to melt with fervent heat it's all going to be a great big giant boom like you ain't never heard in your whole life it's all going to pass away it's all going to become nothing but the bible says but my word shall not pass away everything else is going to pass away but this will not pass away do you see how ignorant it is it'll never pass away no matter how many people try to make it null and void whatever it is it'll never pass away if he says that you're gonna be a judgment every tongue shall confess every knee shall bow and every tongue shall come free said jesus christ is lord still this is going to happen amen but now the problem is and i want to talk a little bit for a little while with the help of the lord about weak faith and strong faith how many blades that knows that the bible says that abraham not being weak in faith abraham was not weak in faith 25 years it didn't matter he wasn't weak in faith he knew god said it he knew it was going to happen he hung on to it and it didn't matter how long of a time that it was so how many can say tonight know that amen real genuine strong faith endures time no matter how much time goes by real genuine if you've got real genuine faith you're not going to fall off in 20 30 years 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 years or 120 like noah i mean knows noah was not freaking fake he went 120 years and he was just building that r huh and that's the same way with you and me i was 20 years old when i come to the lord i'm almost 6 59 and i say 60 i just saw giving myself a few years always to make myself feel better but anyway you know and you know you know look at that time frame if you have genuine faith i mean time is not of the essence there's something down on the inside of it amen so you look at that um think about think about what faith what faith in the word it's it's the only thing that makes makes this work huh how many knows that's the first thing that for this work the first thing to access the power of this word the only thing the thing you gotta have is faith revelation by god himself for god reveal it to you you can conjure it in your mind and you can try and try and try you'll never get any power like that but when god comes down and he reveals it to you it makes it real to you in your life and in your heart when god grants you that faith for we are saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves it's the gift of god when you get that faith faith folks i'm here to tell you it causes you to tap into this and to know that it'll absolutely take you over the flames of hell huh let me tell you something this is going to carry us right over the atomic bombs that's coming this place is going to get blowed up it could be nothing but ashes but this faith in this word is what's going to pick you up in the rapture and take you right above it while that happens down here gonna carry you over the flames of hell and the tribulation period amen this word right here is what changes this from one day to the other it's what uh changes our character it molds us it shapes us into the image of christ huh does all kinds of things we could be here all night y'all ready for all night i ain't done almighty brother brad or a midnighter like paul hey man so just think about it isn't that awesome just to think about the power so the power of this word we realize that for one thing you think about what it's done people with strong faith in this word have literally quenched the violence of fire they heated up the oven amen that they were getting thrown into seven times hotter than they originally were gonna do they were just gonna make the fire hot enough to burn the guys but after they defied the king they said make it seven times hotter i believe it was so hot that the people that were dragging them boys up there over the edge got killed by the heat huh them boys are gonna get they're gonna die but can you imagine them guards they were doomed either way if they didn't go throw them in they're gonna get killed and if they go throw them in they'll get killed horrible devil to serve isn't it yeah that is bad but dad they had to go through some guys in and they went and throwed them in and they because of their faith in the word of god and in god it's quenched the violence of fire and they walked around in the fire walked around in a fire because of strong faith daniel walked among lions hey folks i'm here to tell you it ain't like these guys that raised the lions and pitted them and were all nice to them you know no these lions they were very hungry huh they were wild terrible lions didn't like humans a whole lot because if we found that out right after uh you know god saved daniel from the lion's mouth and so forth then they throw those other guys in i'm not sure just how it says it but it talks about they were ripped bone to bone before they ever hit the ground from what i understand my lines did a job but think about it think about what it does let it soak in that you let me let me just say this the next thing that it brings the next thing the one thing that this word of god will do for every one of us tonight make you invincible invincible yeah hey shamgar right shamgar got fed up with being pushed around by the devil because that's what the devil loves to do the devil loves when you just get a little bit of faith when you just get a little bit going he loves to just knock you right back down huh and chamgar every year they would come and he would have a weak harvest and he would you know he would probably try to hide some wheat for his family they'd find his in wheat probably and he was in a bad shape he got so fed up with it he says that they ain't got no right i'm an israelite and i have a right to my this is our land and faith kicked in i'm gonna kill him i don't believe that we never mattered i don't believe it would have mattered if it's a hundred or 200 i don't know about you but jeff but i wouldn't take 10 guys on with a sword can you imagine 10 guys yeah let alone 100 or 200 or 300 or 400 or 500 it was 600. and he killed all of them come on let's get the lord ahead thank you invincible unstoppable he got the spirit of god believing and trusting in god same way with samson is that right don't matter if it's a thousand or ten thousand and as i've done it before and told you before i don't believe any man that i know or could ever think of that could go on a battlefield and have enough energy to kill a thousand in a day now you would you'd run out of energy before you get that far but not him i think he does talk about afterwards she was weak and go really red and so forth yeah i'd take a zap right out of it but the power of invincibility amen not only in the old testament there but didn't jesus say with you nothing's going to be impossible huh faith in this word strong faith in this word will give you the ability to walk on water huh weak faith when you look at circumstances like peter did if you look around a little bit huh well i don't know if i got there you go down right there i don't know if i can do this i tried this before boy the devil just fill you up with it because even peter not just not just jesus walked on water but peter walked on water but i'm glad for a helping hand sometimes when you get a little weak in faith jesus reaches down picks you up say come on up here come on up here amen how many knows these people that we read about in the bible huh the woman that touched the hem of his garment she said if i can just touch him if i can just touch him and just and no doubt a lot of people weren't she had to push do some shoving she had to push around a little bit to get to where jesus was and she touched him amen and jesus and she was instantly healed isn't that right and jesus realized she has gone out of me strength that's gone out of me somebody touched me somebody got healed i guess jesus will have to tell us whether really he knew who it was or wasn't right maybe he didn't know i don't know but he said who touched me and the woman admitted he's with me and he said your faith is what did it your faith is what did it same way with the blind people he didn't say well i heal you he had oh he could how many knows jesus can heal everyone so high everyone's stew whether you've got faith in that you can do it he can do what he wants but he says this was your faith this was your doing huh you did this it was your faith that did it why because they had strong faith the one woman as we know he even called a dog a gentile i guess not me to give the children's bread to dogs lady some people are would never be that humble called me a dog ain't no dog ain't nobody called me a dog yeah i'm dog i'm a worm the bible calls us worms somewhere right but a worm ain't nothing compared to god she says yes that's true lord it is not the good to get take the children's bread out of their plate and give it to the dogs no but she was pretty wise she had faith she had determination i believe brother brandon preached on perseverance she was perseverant i mean his faith is perseverant it's going to happen it's got to happen i ain't worried about nothing else like the queen of sheba how many of us she had real genuine faith because she went and loaded her camels up and she just had a small a bunch of arms around her but she had a lot of gold she had all kinds of valuables and she wasn't worried about all of them deserts and all of those uh criminals on their desert that would have taken him so far so you didn't think about all of that just get me up there i want to see solomon i want to see this she didn't worry about everything else sometimes a person with real genuine faith they act crazy to the world but if you have genuine it is persistent perseverant amen it makes it so praise the lord gives you invincibility unstoppability and i believe that even death shouldn't scare us even death itself shouldn't scare us it has no power over us not even death how many knows it makes you brave now how many of those that uh peter and all of those when they were in the upper room waiting for the holy ghost to come they were worried they were scared up there from what i understand they were a little worried that hey they're fixing to come they can come anytime they can find us and they could crucify us like they did our master huh and they were up there but after the holy ghost came in there right when that spirit comes down and that faith bubbled up the rams as they come up out of their room they were preaching the gospel and they says where is that devil at we ain't afraid no more they took the fear out they went out preaching the gospel everywhere didn't care if they got thrown in jesus into prison they didn't care if they got crucified or whatever happened they did get crucified they get killed and everything else but they had genuine faith in god amen strong faith peter brother bannon preached on perfect faith he talked about how that peter had perfect faith isn't that right amen when that uh crippled man it was crippled and so forth amen he was going to the temple and he was begging for alms and peter come up to him and and talk to him for a minute perhaps and and he asked him for gold silver gold peter says i ain't got no money i ain't got no silver no gold but the bible says that peter perceived that he had faith to be healed now something must have come over peter right something must have told him hey say that to him tell him to get up rise up in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk i'm up i'm up i believe that he had faith and he rose up and walked see all these different stories brothers and sisters tears stories to tell you that it doesn't matter if you're in lion's eye or what kind of a fire you're in if god is with you and you have faith in god god will take you through it i'm just glad for that the same power and that faith comes by hearing that's why we're talking about these lords because it gives you faith make you realize the very same god oh my how brother brandon preached a message different message upon uh uh god the unchangeable god the unchangeable god that never changes he is not the i was but he is i am the i am and he still is as much as he ever was as powerful as he ever was now we know that the prophet taught us how to do this generation this is the age of hybriding this is the age when people hybrid everything people hybrid or try to hybrid this word huh called a hybrid religion they try to mix something else into it and what does it produce huh same thing that a horse and a donkey will produce in that right a mule and he can never reproduce himself again same as a grain of corn that's hybrid it can never reproduce itself again and it basically makes the word of god to them of non-effect it is of not affected them it doesn't have the power that it's supposed to have because they hybrid it they mix their own ideas their own thoughts and so forth in it why do you think jesus said if you had faith as the grain of a mustard seed huh the reason he said a mustard seed because from what i understand a mustard seed will not mix with anything else it is so pure it won't mix with nothing so if you have that kind of faith you could say to a mountain ah i'm stupid but i believe you literally meant mountain i believe you've set a mountain he meant the mountain he just said a tree he demanded a tree but he set the mountain be plucked up look at that mountain pop up go over into the ocean being a big spot with it can i say something else a little crazy tonight i'm surprised somebody ain't done it already yeah if he said it was possible i'm surprised it ain't happened somebody just ain't got the right faith yet amen because i believe i believe if god give you faith in water i believe that don't you i believe you could walk on water i believe you could quench the violence of fire lions huh you think that's a little much thomas that's a little much getting a little big here yeah we even started why joshua i'm not joshua had perfect and and one people i'm praying let me see if i can have enough faith to believe that this boy can walk huh and believes it it's already prayed up it's already in tune with god just like it was he didn't have to pray about it but he was in a battle and his son was going down over the trees and they were starting to win they were starting to get the other upper hand we're starting to push them but in a half hour it's gonna be dark and it's gonna be all over and tomorrow we're gonna have to do the same thing again huh he probably didn't do like this what am i going to do what am i going to do he looked up and said son stand still [Applause] moon stay where you're at until we fight this battle and god hearken and stop the universe i don't think that's exaggerating to you stop the world stopped it all can you i can't i don't know if we're going around 1000 miles an hour or something if we would stop we'd all go flying off how do you ever explain this whole thing stopping when everybody flying out i don't know i can't explain it all i know is god did it joshua sweated it happened huh so it can happen now we're talking about faith now we're talking about strong faith amen shame god one time weak faith and his faith got strong because he got tired of the devil pushing him around we need to get sick and tired of the devil pushing us around you got a smile on your face right you get happy praise the lord tomorrow i'm going to happen right this world is so full of the negative that bam says you know that's what this world is it has so much negative has so much positive it's not all good it's not all bad not right but anytime the devil can he'll try to rob you he'll try to take your joy he'll try to take your happiness he'll try to take your peace that you have yes you will you get the holy ghost you get right with god and never try anything out in this book we try to rob you of that but you know how many knows that at calvary that the devil was stripped of every one of his powers he had every one of them stripped in other words he's only got whatever power we give him whatever power you give him is the power that he has in order for him to have power over you you have to reject god and his word and his power you basically have to say devil here i am i give up that's what you got to do how was it the prophet said uh you can't walk in darkness until you refuse the light huh because the light is shining so the only way you can really walk in darkness is to refuse the light amen and this is the light this is the truth huh and let me tell you something else about what this is do you realize this is an absolute affidavit this is a stamped notary repub public or whatever it's been notarized it's been officially made it's got the stamp of god on it that every person on earth is pardoned huh every sin that anybody ever committed or ever will commit is forgiven it's a complete pardon right here for god to love the world that he gave his own begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen it is a stamp of approval that everybody can live eternally the only reason everybody doesn't because they're weak in faith they don't believe it they don't believe it because if you believed it huh how many knows that's the same way with the holy ghost well i want the holy ghost believe god the right way and god will give it to you instantly don't have to come to the altar it can be in your car can be on the job can be wherever you actually get that faith that you're supposed to have when god accepts that faith and you receive that faith god will give it to you instantly peter was preaching at the house of cornelius isn't that right 11th chapter i believe it is of acts and while he was yet speaking these words the holy ghost fell on because he believed what he said can i just say what comes to my that's mind same way with this gospel do you realize that when this gospel is preached you can receive the baptism the holy ghost right there you can receive the holy ghost by believing what the preacher says if it's the truth and if you reject it what do you get and what do you receive mark of the beast mark of the beast has always been to reject the truth it's the mark of unbelief the mark of cain that's kind of strong in it but it's the truth go ye into all the world and preach the gospel he that believeth and his baptize shall be saved he that believeth not shall receive the mark of the beast or be down amen okay brother bob says satan has no power the only thing he can do is bluff with it if he can bluff you into it all right that's right you'll have to have it but legally he has no power at all every power that he had was taken from him at calvary that's where the price was paid amen that he has nothing but a bluff if you want to listen to his blood well all right but you don't have to you are free tonight he has made you free oh i wish that would echo into anybody's heart that isn't truly free you're free he made you free if you want to be free but how many knows a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon it is absolutely no good if you don't have faith to believe it for without faith it is possible to please him impossible to please him for he that cometh the god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him well brother brother i've tried not you hate tried hard enough huh right if you diligently seek him you'll find him if you really mean it go out in that cornfield and let us find your bones out there if you don't get the baptism of the holy ghost you'll come back and say brother about it i got it i got it y'all you got to have no funeral for me huh if you serious enough about it i believe god i don't believe god will let you be out there and die do you i think god honors faith amen praise the lord that's why you can be free now if there's something in the word that can make you realize that you are free by his grace or if something you realize that he says and the word makes you to understand some act of god that it included you it includes us all then you accept it on those basis and you're free also you don't have to feel any different you don't have to feel anything at all it's not based on feelings it's based on did you believe it do you believe it amen so many people rely on feelings how many knows i believe something happens when something comes down in here you will feel something i believe the holy ghost when i got it i felt something i felt my sins go i felt my life i found myself get lighter i knew that in my heart i was right with god something had happened maybe something's got to happen sooner or later something's going to happen but you don't wait for that to happen to believe well i'm waiting for something to happen and i'll believe no you believe and then god will honor that belief and something will happen it'll change you for all eternity amen i just believe tonight that we are getting closer and closer to having that perfect faith in god amen because we're going to have to have perfect faith perfect love be one with the word of god amen if you anybody wants to listen to a good tape oneness of unity oneness of unity amen talking about how that man and god becomes one and how that we have to become this word how many believes that through faith by faith you eat this word you believe this word and we become this word amen that's right praise the lord amen so don't let the devil push you around it's just a bluff he takes your victory i can't over don't you talk the devil's language no not i don't care how many times you fail you get up you say i believe i'm victorious i believe i'm a son of god i believe god's word devil you are a bluff because that's all he is amen it bluff acts like he's got something he doesn't really have amen i don't know cards but i know there's aces and kings and queens and all of that stuff i guess you know and there's a full deck i guess or something like that been a long time since i played those and it'll be a long time before i relate that but there's a good hand there's a bad hand when you're gambling money huh you put a bunch of money down right and make everybody fold i'm full i'm out i'm out that guy's gotta have a good day and you know and come to find out you might just be a bluff isn't that right but let me tell you something that's what the devil is he really doesn't have a good hand at all now i don't know what the best hand is but there's a hand that you can get that is no better right a perfect top of the line nobody can beat that's god he's got the best hand he's got the perfect hand he ain't got to worry about nobody else because everybody else is is a bluff is lower than what he's got that's what the devil is he's nothing but the bluff god's word is not a i'm glad this is not a bluff this is fact this is true this is real amen and i believe that the bride is coming to perfection you believe she's coming to perfection i believe she's come to that perfection and that is perfectly in christ you don't think your own thoughts don't speak your own words when you do it's like man i need to shut up huh oh my and it gives you courage i'm i'm not going to go along tonight but let me just read you this one more would that be okay i was reading the other day where a man said the devil got before him and he was just a little bitty old devil and this devil said boo so i jumped back and he said boo and i jump back again every time he hollered boo i'd jump back and hit it bigger and i would get smaller huh isn't that about how the devil is every time he whoops yeah every time he scares you i mean it seems like the devil is just so big he's just so big how am i ever going to do it huh and he said he just kept saying boo said i got smaller each time and i jump back and he'd get bigger so i know i had to fight him after a while and said i looked around i thought i found the word of god and i said i'll hold it in my hand and the devil i said boo i said the devil said boo and i said boo back aaron you're not the devil but let me use the illustration all right say boot to me huh that's what you got to do back he said that right right that one goes boom and you go you boo here here you know be like that's right that's what he says boo back scare him why because you know he's a bluff you know i wish there's somebody in here but anyway because it's just like just like david right you know david was a little bitty fella and goliath how does that song go david was oh so small and a giant oh so tall you know and uh so there they were what did uh who talked first i think it was goliath booed and my dog that you sent this little guy out here to fight me you know who am i and so forth he says today i'll do this i'll take your head i'll i'll feed you to the files in the air i'll pick you up by the end of my spear and feed you to the birds huh david said [Music] you come to me with a sword and a spear goliath i'm not afraid of you why because the god that delivered the bear into my hand and the lion in the mind you fight any of them lately goliath bet you did but i did and god delivered me from the potter line and the pawn for the bear he's gonna deliver you into my hand you come with me as with a sword and a spear but i come to you in the name of the lord of hosts the armies of israel that's why i come to your hand now let's do this amen got to meet him face to face with the brahman says sometime you're going to have to fight him huh so everybody ask yourselves tonight both here on the streaming world where does the devil intimidate you at because that's where your battle is going to have to be you're going to say i'm not going to be intimidated by the devil anymore we're going to say boo back huh we're going to meet him face to face in other words let's do this but about says faith has got muscles on his chest and he says every time that reasoning comes and oh i don't know if you can do it i don't know if you can do it he says you let faith come and say shut up reasoning sit down reasoning and brother bram says it goes back over into the corner sits in a little chair in the corner somewhere because faith makes it so you meet the devil you say devil this is where the line is drawn amen if he's robbed you of something go get it back no that alley he's down and that dark place that he's down that he's got you down it isn't as scary and as spooky as it looks because way down in that alley way in that dark place he is just a bluff he's just a little devil running around and when we listen do you realize the bible says that when we get down to the pit when we get down to the pit where the devil is going to get thrown into isaiah 14 i believe it is you will be brought to the sides of the pit i hope i can remember this and they who look upon you narrowly look upon you will say is this the guy is this the devil are you the guy that brought down nations are you the one that give us all this trouble you know i thought you was a big bad guy you aren't as much as what i thought she was isn't that right that's the way i read it anyway narrowly look upon him and say is this the guy that i was scared of that i let push me around huh but i grant you this one thing you'll never do it on your own you'll never do it without the holy ghost you have to have god on your side don't never try to meet him like the seven sons of siva did they didn't have the holy ghost they wanted to go cast some devils out you know right they were going to go cast out them some devils out they got up in that house and they got into this place and they were saying we adjure thee by jesus christ that paul preaches wow had it right not bad yeah jesus christ paul's god oh yeah you got it right but they didn't know him personally isn't that right it's somebody else's experience you know what paul's doing my mom's experience dad's no no no you know they had to have an experience like paul had the holy ghost wasn't there they weren't being backed up and can we say the devils were probably in here too and what happened yeah they got loose the devil got loose they turned loose peter they turned loose on them seven sons and they barely escaped with their lives does it say something about their their clothes were ripped from them why because they didn't do it by the word of god do you realize that the nations nowadays that fight the nations russia china north korea all of these guys all the fighting that goes between them that's just devils that are jealous of each other huh it's just a bunch of devils fighting that's why we have wars yeah and everything else is because the devils are truly they battle each other over jealousy and hatred and money and all these other things but i don't know about you but i pray tonight as i close that each and every one of us is asking ourselves how is my faith if your faith is where it should be you're saved if your spirit should be you're filled with the holy ghost if it is where it ought to be you've conquered the biggest enemy of all and that is your old self the old man that second person that paul talked about that gets in god's way and you have learned to yield yourself to god you've conquered yourself brother bram said amen you've whipped yourself out you've said lord i can't do anything but i know with you i can do anything because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world how many tonight would say increase my faith lord increase my faith i want strong faith because if i don't have strong faith i'm just dragging some people can't have enough arm hardly to pick the sword up but bram says sometimes we just scratch it a little bit well i'm going to church she's scratching a little bit i go to church huh i'm pretty good no is every word called spoken by the holy ghost is every day that you live live by the holy ghost every action that you have by the holy ghost hello that's what you want to cut out cut big chunks out don't just barely drag this order along sometimes we don't have faith enough to for a toothache how are we going to go into rapture i'm looking for faith that one day these very atoms huh them wrinkles will tighten back up i told my wife i wish i knew the words my wife complimented me the other i said look honey i'm getting really old get up in the morning just took care of us i'm looking and she's get over here and sit down i want you to know you're a more beautiful man than you ever i don't know what all she said she really piled on me and i was like honey i sure love you you're sweet because i sure don't see it i'm getting wrinkly old and i'm looking for a new body one of these days it'll change in the very atoms but how many knows beliefs truly i'm here to tell you something if you expect to go in the rapture huh you better let god do work in here because there's going to be a lot of people that's not going to make a rapture they're not going to be ready you have all the faith you want not claim to have all the faith you want but if god isn't doing a work in your life now getting you ready for that time you're not going he's only taking those who are going to be ready for him and i don't know about you but i hope that you can believe that if the only one coming from this church you're going to be that one all right because why because god's working on you one thing i thank god for and that is that i know for a fact that god is working on this heart right here i don't know about you but i know he's working on this daily and i want him to keep working on it like david sings a lot he's still working on me and to make me what ought to be don't judge me yet there's an unfinished part amen that's right the lord's still working on us we still got some unfinished parts but i'll tell you what when you're ready when that time comes here this is the good part god is working god is getting us ready he really is while we say we're getting ourselves ready it is the holy spirit working in our hearts goodness ready building our faith up more and more more so start with your toothache start with something little then build up build up build up build up until it's giants until it's uh goliaths till it's quenching the violence of fire until it's stopping the sun and the moon perhaps worlds that you think could never happen things that you'd think could never happen watch them happen how many please say all things are possible to them to believe how many believe this is as true as it ever was how many believes that it's according to your faith it's gonna work for you this is gonna work for you according to your faith amen stand with me we'll close with that thought amen with our heads bowed lord jesus we humbly come before you lord once again so grateful father that we can come together that we can assemble ourselves together in the name of jesus christ and to know that thomas spiler he's not the one speaking the holy spirit is speaking it is you in your church father lord the people that has come the people that's out there that's filled with your holy ghost lord it's not them it's you and we ask god tonight that you would help us lord jesus to realize that this word is so powerful father it'll do just about anything we have need of it'll supply all it'll do so much but even jesus speaking directly to people when he was here on earth walking in flesh told them that be it unto you according as thou has believed thy faith has made thee whole lord jesus if there's any that is not whole if there's those which i know there is those who don't need healing tonight we ask in jesus name that you would touch them lord and they would believe the lord that by your stripes they are healed whatever their ailment whatever the sickness lord we believe that by your stripes we are healed there's any any out there lord father that doesn't have the baptism of the holy ghost that don't know you in a personal way don't know what it's like to go to work come home to work work during the day with you in their hearts i asked god tonight that you would give them that peace that they would find you that they would surrender their life to you unreservedly and say god here i am i'm yours lord no matter what comes or what goes the most important thing in my whole life is that i know and have a personal walk with you there is nothing else as important as that lord you have promised that you would supply all our need if we just seek your righteousness first we ask god increase our faith anyone listening increase their faith and help us to have faith in you in the way that we should we love you with all of our heart and ask god that you'll bless this message tonight to every heart and that you will increase our faith help us not to be weak but to be strong in the lord and in the power of his might that we might put on the whole armor of god that we might be able to stand having done all to stand and that we can stand and stand and stand in this evil day in jesus name we ask it amen and amen enjoy that night we've got power in the name of jesus oh we've got
