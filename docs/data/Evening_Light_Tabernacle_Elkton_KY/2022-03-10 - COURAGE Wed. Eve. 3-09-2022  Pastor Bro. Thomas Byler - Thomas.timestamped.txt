[22:58] could never pray too much and
[23:00] you know that's what the enemy wants is

[23:06] to pray and when i do help me to be
[23:08] thankful
[23:09] not always ask but be thankful for what
[23:12] you've done
[23:13] for the strength and health and

[27:13] jesus christ's name
[27:15] amen and amen
[27:17] turn your bibles if you will to the book
[27:19] of psalms
[27:22] 23 a very familiar scripture
[27:25] psalms 23
[27:29] and i think i may want to try to read
[27:30] about four scriptures just to
[27:34] lay our foundation about four scriptures
[27:36] one is in psalms 23.
[27:41] amen
[27:49] verse 4 yea though i walk through the
[27:51] valley of the shadow of death i will
[27:53] fear no evil
[27:55] for thou art with me thy rod and i staff
[27:58] they comfort me
[28:00] turn over to the book of joshua the
[28:01] first chapter if you would
[28:03] joshua 1.
[28:12] and i want to read 5 6 and 7 and also 9
[28:16] 5 6 and 7 and then 9
[28:22] and there shall not any man be able to
[28:24] stand before thee all the days of thy
[28:26] life and as i was with moses so will i
[28:28] be with thee
[28:29] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[28:32] strong and have a good courage
[28:34] for unto this people shalt thou divide
[28:37] the inherit for inheritance to land
[28:40] which i swear unto their fathers to give
[28:42] them
[28:43] only be thou strong and very courageous
[28:45] that thou mayest observe to do according
[28:48] to all of the law
[28:49] which moses my servant commanded thee
[28:51] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[28:53] the left that thou mayest prother
[28:55] prosper whither ever so i thou goest
[28:58] verse 9 for have not i commanded thee be
[29:01] strong and of good courage be not afraid
[29:04] neither be dismayed for the lord thy god
[29:06] is with thee with whether so ever
[29:08] thou goest
[29:10] amen we're going to stop there and let
[29:12] you be
[29:13] seated
[29:14] amen and i want to talk about courage
[29:17] tonight would that be okay
[29:19] let's talk about courage there's another
[29:22] aspect that's as much of this as i've
[29:24] been gathering going over and so forth
[29:27] about the lord and his commandments so
[29:29] forth you know i would just meditate on
[29:31] the lord and this word came to me about
[29:33] courage you know and how that courage
[29:36] has uh such a major bearing in our life
[29:40] amen
[29:42] you know the other word i guess opposite
[29:44] of courage
[29:46] would be coward
[29:50] either have courage
[29:52] or you're a coward one or the other amen
[29:55] to not have courages to be afraid is to
[29:57] be scared
[29:59] amen
[30:00] and i want to read uh i'm going to read
[30:02] now philippians 1 i want to read this
[30:04] yet philippians and we're going to look
[30:06] at paul here for a minute philippians 1
[30:08] and verse 2 beginning with 20
[30:11] it says
[30:12] according to my earnest expectation and
[30:15] my hope
[30:16] that in nothing i shall be ashamed amen
[30:20] but that with all boldness
[30:23] right
[30:24] how many knows that's what courage is
[30:27] it's boldness
[30:30] that's what paul's saying here with all
[30:33] boldness as always
[30:35] so now also christ may be magnified in
[30:39] my body
[30:40] whether it be in life or whether it
[30:42] being death
[30:44] for me to live is christ
[30:47] and to die
[30:48] is
[30:49] gain
[30:50] praise the lord romans 1 and 16.
[30:59] romans 1.
[31:09] i'm trying to think but i believe
[31:11] there's a scripture somewhere about
[31:13] jesus talking about if you're ashamed of
[31:15] me i'll be ashamed of you and that right
[31:18] so a lot of times cowardness and
[31:21] uh and so forth has to do with being
[31:24] ashamed you know and especially when it
[31:25] comes to christ people are ashamed to
[31:27] confess him and so forth okay chapter
[31:30] one
[31:31] and let me see here 1-16 romans 1-16
[31:36] paul says it this way
[31:39] all right
[31:44] for i am not ashamed of the gospel of
[31:47] christ for it is the power of god unto
[31:50] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[31:52] the jew first and also
[31:54] unto the greek amen so we see here paul
[31:57] talking about being ashamed he wasn't
[31:59] afraid
[32:00] he had no fear i mean those paul did not
[32:03] hesitate to stand up uh you know in
[32:06] whenever he was taken captive and so
[32:08] forth and certain gates certain places
[32:10] he was never ashamed
[32:12] of what he had been ashamed of before
[32:16] now we look we know that of course our
[32:19] fear and our scaredness and so forth
[32:23] our cowardice came after the fall
[32:26] amen there was a time when adam wasn't
[32:28] afraid of anything not right but after
[32:31] the fall we find that adam would begin
[32:33] to hide himself in the uh you know
[32:36] behind the trees and so forth you know
[32:38] in the in the garden and he was scared
[32:41] when he heard the voice of the lord
[32:42] isn't that right and then something
[32:44] that's the first place that fear
[32:46] came into the human race when man was
[32:49] separated from god
[32:52] when he had actually uh committed sin
[32:55] and fell from grace and so forth and he
[32:57] was away from god away from fellowship
[32:59] now
[33:00] fear set in
[33:01] you know and people might not think that
[33:03] they're you know that they were that
[33:05] they're scared but you know even brother
[33:07] bam said that our americans even
[33:09] americans are scared
[33:12] that right
[33:13] and how you can tell it's like a a young
[33:16] man that is going by a graveyard perhaps
[33:18] and he'll whistle
[33:21] you know i'll never forget we had a
[33:23] graveyard close to where i was born and
[33:24] raised and as i was growing up i would
[33:26] be scared to come up over this one hill
[33:29] right beside the woods
[33:31] and come up over this hill and in these
[33:33] woods there was a graveyard i remember
[33:35] making all talking or making all kinds
[33:37] of noise doing just what he said because
[33:39] you know i was just letting everybody
[33:40] out there know i am not scared
[33:46] you know and you know you know the truth
[33:48] of it there is you're making noises
[33:50] because you are scared
[33:52] you know and he says that's it that's
[33:54] how america is with all of these uh uh
[33:58] people what do you call them comedians
[34:00] and all of these jokes and everybody's
[34:02] laughing it has
[34:04] comedy and just everything to laugh
[34:06] everything's a joke he says all that is
[34:08] is you know going by a graveyard
[34:10] whistling because they know they got it
[34:12] coming
[34:14] they know they got it coming you know
[34:16] you know there's a god and i don't care
[34:18] who it is every man amen that is born of
[34:21] a woman and so forth born in sin they
[34:23] have that fear in them their word
[34:25] they're scared people are scared
[34:28] people are worried and they have right
[34:30] reason to be you know why they're
[34:31] worried because in their minds they know
[34:34] for the most part they know there's a
[34:36] god
[34:38] god made us that intelligent you know
[34:41] the cows may not know the horses may not
[34:43] know all the animals they may not know
[34:46] that there's a god but human beings know
[34:49] that there's a god
[34:51] now brother bam said that religion means
[34:53] a covering and that's why you'll find
[34:55] that in whether it was the indians or
[34:57] whether it's down in south africa
[34:59] wherever you go you find even the
[35:01] heathens are worshiping something
[35:05] in that right because they know that
[35:06] there's a god somewhere
[35:08] and they have this thing in them and
[35:10] they'll do all kinds of things to try to
[35:12] cover that scarce cover that fear up
[35:17] amen and we find it here in america
[35:20] think about it
[35:21] you know how many people know that the
[35:23] church they're going to is not right but
[35:25] they'll keep going because they're
[35:26] worried
[35:27] they want to cover up they want to go to
[35:29] church on sunday just to make themselves
[35:31] feel a little better
[35:33] and people on the other hand they get so
[35:35] busy with doing all kinds of things so
[35:38] they never sit down and like david said
[35:40] to meditate
[35:42] you know as i thought on my ways
[35:45] you know if people would begin to just
[35:46] think a little bit it would be scary
[35:51] think about it
[35:53] it would be scary if people would just
[35:55] begin to think about what they're doing
[35:57] where are they going to end that up at
[35:59] what's going to happen their lives
[36:03] i don't care if it's hollywood i don't
[36:04] care any of they all know they're coming
[36:06] down to that door of death
[36:09] amen they know that
[36:11] but tonight i am thankful
[36:15] aren't you thankful to know that you
[36:17] don't have to be scared
[36:21] jesus told me he told everybody he told
[36:25] moses that to be courageous have some
[36:28] courage
[36:30] don't be afraid how many times he said
[36:33] fear not
[36:35] and then what he said when
[36:36] when they woke him up on the scene he
[36:38] says fear not
[36:40] i am with you
[36:42] another
[36:43] all over the place over in the book of
[36:44] revelations he told john fear not i am
[36:47] the first and the last
[36:50] and i have the keys of death in
[36:52] hell and uh to think about it all the
[36:55] way down even it is even that we're even
[36:58] at a place where you don't have to be
[37:00] scared
[37:02] of death itself
[37:05] honestly for that
[37:07] you ain't got a thing
[37:09] to be scared about
[37:11] if you're a christian
[37:13] but that's if you are a christian you
[37:15] have absolutely nothing not even death
[37:18] itself didn't the prophet say ever since
[37:20] that he went over beyond the curtain of
[37:22] time he has never feared death
[37:28] amen
[37:29] you know
[37:30] and i may not have went beyond the
[37:32] curtain of time and seen all that but i
[37:34] believe that prophet
[37:37] i believe he was there i believe he saw
[37:39] those people and therefore i believe
[37:42] that i can be
[37:44] a beneficiary
[37:45] of that same fearlessness that i don't
[37:48] have to be afraid of death because i
[37:50] know what's over there
[37:54] didn't better damn say he says you know
[37:55] in his younger days he also also and
[37:57] i've seen it i've seen it on tape i've
[37:59] seen it in the quotes where he says you
[38:01] know now you won't be able to shake each
[38:03] other's hand
[38:05] you know and so forth because he says
[38:07] youth were like a cloud and he didn't
[38:09] know for sure just you know how we're
[38:11] going to be able to hug each other or
[38:12] shake hands or anything
[38:15] you know and and that's what it kind of
[38:17] kind of what it conveys because we're
[38:18] just a ghost
[38:20] but you know later on after that he
[38:22] realized no you do touch you do feel
[38:26] is they are real is what he said
[38:29] just beyond that last breath
[38:33] amen he's the most glorious place you
[38:35] could ever know
[38:38] amen
[38:40] my
[38:41] we think about
[38:43] the great heroes of the bible
[38:46] the great things that they did
[38:50] right
[38:51] how fearless they were
[38:55] right
[38:57] now the first scripture we read he says
[38:59] though i walk through the valley of the
[39:01] shadow of death david said
[39:04] now there are some things i'm scared of
[39:05] did he say that
[39:08] no david said i will fear no evil
[39:14] david had gotten the place he wasn't
[39:15] scared of any evil
[39:20] amen because no doubt he's had the
[39:22] experience with the lord
[39:25] and having slain a bear right
[39:28] and slaying a lion that was his enemy
[39:31] took his sheep and he says give me back
[39:33] my sheep
[39:35] he went and guarded from that bear went
[39:37] and got it from that lie and killed that
[39:39] lion
[39:41] let me ask you something
[39:44] let me just make the statement
[39:46] a true believer
[39:48] has the courage
[39:50] of a lion
[39:55] did you ever see lions on top of
[39:57] hippopotamuses and they'll get on top of
[40:00] a giraffe if they can they don't care
[40:02] what it is they think they're the
[40:03] biggest and the baddest in all of the
[40:04] jungle
[40:07] huh
[40:08] you're just about afraid of nothing and
[40:10] that's the way david was david you know
[40:12] he said i will fear no evil
[40:15] for what thou art with me
[40:18] and that makes the difference
[40:21] three things i want you to notice that
[40:23] makes a man fearless
[40:25] faith
[40:26] right faith
[40:29] and love
[40:32] there's another thing that actually
[40:34] brings you into a place of
[40:36] fearlessness and i i'll say this because
[40:39] i believe it's in fellowship
[40:43] fellowship
[40:44] with christ
[40:46] when i begin to think about courage even
[40:49] in our modern day we know george
[40:51] washington what did the prophet say he
[40:53] prayed all night
[40:55] before he got on that water went over
[40:57] there they attacked the enemy they had
[40:58] been defeated time and time and time
[41:00] again and that was one of our first big
[41:03] victories
[41:04] after somebody prayed all night how
[41:06] about daniel he prayed three times a day
[41:08] prayer will bring you to fearlessness
[41:15] i mean please
[41:16] it's about that fellowship that you have
[41:18] daniel that he wasn't afraid of those
[41:20] lions the three hebrew children they
[41:22] become fearless because of their
[41:24] relationship with almighty god
[41:30] they were so bold
[41:32] they didn't uh go up there and say well
[41:35] now we apologize for saying this king
[41:37] but no they said
[41:39] cake we are not careful about how we
[41:41] talk to you about this
[41:45] oh my
[41:48] he uh had a good way of putting it
[41:51] he says you know it puts me in mind of
[41:52] something that i was telling to people
[41:54] the other day
[41:55] he says i was getting to the spot to
[41:57] where i need more faith that's why i'm
[41:59] home for now and so forth god so looks
[42:02] like that when we pray for people that
[42:04] you apologize you say mr devil would you
[42:06] please just move over and get out of
[42:08] here please
[42:10] he said no nothing like that face got
[42:13] muscles and hair on his chest
[42:17] amen when it speaks everything else
[42:20] shuts up
[42:22] don't go in there and apologize for this
[42:24] and apologize for that
[42:26] faith don't apologize
[42:29] faith makes it so it's not a wishbone
[42:34] it's got hair on each other it's muscle
[42:36] little oh my what did it do to goliath
[42:40] who is the bigger man
[42:44] that he was the little silly little
[42:45] bitty fellow
[42:46] he didn't look like the bigger man but
[42:49] he was the bigger man
[42:53] did he go up there and say now mr
[42:55] goliath i'm sorry that i got to do this
[42:57] to you
[42:58] no
[42:59] first the goliath took looked at david
[43:02] right and he threatened him he told him
[43:04] what he was going to do
[43:06] then david said yeah you come to me with
[43:08] a sword and a spear
[43:12] you know
[43:12] but that ain't nothing all right that
[43:14] ain't no it going it isn't going to help
[43:17] you any today
[43:21] because i come to you
[43:23] in the name of the lord of hosts
[43:26] he knew what it was like to have god on
[43:28] his side how many sad to have god on
[43:30] your side you ain't got to be afraid of
[43:32] nothing when you've got god on your side
[43:36] you are an invincible oh my isn't that
[43:39] what the problem of god said when you
[43:40] realize where you are you'll be an
[43:41] invincible army
[43:44] you're an invincible person if you've
[43:46] got god on your side you don't need a
[43:47] big great army
[43:50] oh my
[43:52] all you need is god moses found that out
[43:56] he didn't need any of the children in
[43:57] israel to rise up and rebel
[44:01] huh
[44:02] now i want all of you these rights to
[44:04] join me and tomorrow we're going to
[44:05] rebel and we're going to get sticks and
[44:07] saves we're going to get you know spears
[44:09] where we can we're going to no he didn't
[44:10] need any help
[44:13] it was just him and god
[44:16] went into pharaoh and guess what like
[44:18] believing the prophet said you know you
[44:19] didn't go down the fair and say would
[44:21] you please let my people go we've been
[44:23] down here doing this long enough
[44:26] no he says i tell you phil let my people
[44:30] go
[44:31] in the face of pharaoh would have the
[44:34] ability in a human way of thinking he'd
[44:36] have the ability to have him killed
[44:38] instantly
[44:39] huh
[44:43] but what i love about god
[44:46] is that he can go into anybody's mind
[44:50] and he can make him think how they need
[44:52] to think
[44:54] isn't that right
[44:56] i was shocked the other day when i when
[44:58] i read that about in deuteronomy where
[45:00] all the kings and all of them rose up
[45:03] they said that the army was like the
[45:05] sand of the sea
[45:09] and then later it says god put it in
[45:11] their minds to fight him because he was
[45:13] going to punish him for what they had
[45:14] done
[45:19] you see
[45:20] did you ever wonder why god would take
[45:22] and
[45:22] tell seoul to go down into the
[45:24] philistines into the army and so forth
[45:26] and go into a certain city and kill
[45:28] every man woman and baby
[45:30] take the babies and smash their heads up
[45:32] against the wall
[45:34] huh
[45:37] that's right genocide take the whole
[45:40] thing out
[45:41] you don't know how many times god dealt
[45:43] with them people
[45:45] isn't that right
[45:46] god knows he's god
[45:48] he's a just god
[45:50] i never questioned god
[45:52] but that's what it said with all these
[45:54] armies god was going in there and he was
[45:56] he he made them put it in their heart
[45:58] put it in their minds to do it even the
[46:00] bible says that he hardened pharaoh's
[46:02] heart to not let him go
[46:04] so there'd be more fleas more fires more
[46:06] everything all the way down to the
[46:08] firstborn being killed
[46:11] amen so how many glad to have a god
[46:14] that can take and make your enemy think
[46:16] the way that he wants them to think
[46:18] you've got nothing to worry about
[46:21] i don't care if it's a business deal i
[46:23] don't care if it's a job i don't care
[46:24] what it is god open source god closes
[46:27] doors
[46:29] when you're in god's
[46:31] care he watches out for you you've got
[46:34] no wonder jesus kept telling don't fear
[46:38] he even told his desire fear not what
[46:40] man can do to your body
[46:42] they may be able to burn you at the
[46:44] stake feed you like don't worry about
[46:46] what they can do to the body you worry
[46:48] about him that can kill both body and
[46:50] soul in hell fear him
[46:54] fear him that's the one to fear
[46:59] but in the new testament how many knows
[47:00] the disciples and everybody they were up
[47:02] in the other room and they were scared
[47:04] that maybe they were going to get
[47:05] dragged out too and
[47:07] and so forth but after the holy ghost
[47:09] came
[47:12] after the holy ghost came they became
[47:14] brave
[47:17] they became didn't they don't work
[47:18] cowards anymore
[47:21] listen how many of those brother that
[47:23] god hates a coward even brother bound
[47:25] that he don't like a coward somebody is
[47:27] always scared to do anything
[47:31] oh my
[47:33] is that all right
[47:36] oh
[47:39] that's right
[47:41] listen
[47:42] i admired that eagle
[47:44] because he was brave
[47:46] i do not like a coward they come to
[47:48] church and they act like christians then
[47:51] they go out in the streets and they
[47:52] don't even testify of jesus
[47:57] hear sinful men cursing
[48:00] and afraid to call them down for that
[48:08] uh now you know what to do when somebody
[48:09] curses
[48:12] how many know sometimes you just let it
[48:14] go sometimes you're better off maybe
[48:16] but when the holy spirit tells you to
[48:18] say something you say something i don't
[48:20] appreciate you using my lord's name and
[48:22] name like that
[48:25] huh
[48:26] god can't use a man like that he's got
[48:28] to have somebody that's brave
[48:32] how many believes that
[48:35] why do you think that's why uh god kept
[48:37] telling joshua don't be a coward don't
[48:40] don't be a coward be courageous
[48:43] amen
[48:46] another place for the bible says he read
[48:47] an old proverb or an old quote he says a
[48:49] coward dies 10 000 deaths
[48:53] when a hero never dies
[48:56] the coward's always scared running from
[48:58] every little thing as we would call it
[49:01] afraid of every little shadow and so
[49:04] forth
[49:05] but he says that's the way that's the
[49:07] way with the man who comes and professes
[49:10] that he has faith and is spooked at
[49:12] every little scarecrow devil that can
[49:13] put before him oh my he thinks i'm not
[49:17] any better after getting paid for
[49:19] i just don't i don't feel as well as i
[49:21] did yesterday what difference does it
[49:23] make
[49:24] if you've got real faith in your heart
[49:26] god's gonna keep his word all the hurts
[49:29] all the eggs all the pace all the
[49:31] shadows cannot amount to anything
[49:34] because you believe it with all of your
[49:36] heart
[49:37] i mean those symptoms are the worst
[49:39] thing for us a lot of times
[49:41] our worst enemy is the symptoms that we
[49:43] have after we get prayed for
[49:46] after we try to believe everything will
[49:48] go wrong we can't think we can't go
[49:49] wrong but don't be a coward
[49:51] another place he says you know god give
[49:53] you a checkbook to sign whatsoever
[49:55] things you ask in my name i will do it
[49:58] he says but are you afraid to fill it
[50:00] out
[50:02] don't be a coward
[50:04] god is more than willing to give it to
[50:06] you amen
[50:08] oh my
[50:09] praise the lord
[50:11] so we look we look at these men
[50:14] of the bible how many knows that
[50:23] faith the way that we faith comes by
[50:25] hearing right
[50:27] hearing the word of god
[50:31] like
[50:32] joshua like david
[50:36] amen
[50:37] not afraid to go up there and face that
[50:39] big life not afraid of the bear no fear
[50:42] there
[50:44] to me not to not be afraid what oh what
[50:47] a wonderful thing
[50:49] not afraid of hell not afraid of dying
[50:51] why because you have a fellowship with
[50:54] almighty god
[50:56] how many is glad for that tonight
[50:58] i certainly am
[51:01] we're living in a world brothers and
[51:03] sisters that
[51:06] you aren't really you can't you can't
[51:08] really not be afraid
[51:10] unless you are a child of god unless you
[51:13] are born again of the spirit
[51:19] i believe it says those that do wrong
[51:20] and sin he says there's a fearful
[51:23] looking for of the judgments and the
[51:25] wrath of almighty god
[51:28] they fear they're scared
[51:30] why do you think people are doing and
[51:32] acting the way they do
[51:34] amen
[51:36] listen to what
[51:38] i wanted to read a quote that you're
[51:39] really not right
[51:41] you're not right in your spirit you're
[51:43] not right as far as fear or any of those
[51:45] concerns
[51:47] now now they say too much religion will
[51:49] make you crazy
[51:52] you know we people have been told that
[51:54] don't read too much of that bible
[51:57] you know you'll get confused
[51:59] don't read too much bible
[52:01] it'll make you
[52:02] crazy huh
[52:06] too much of the wrong thing is what will
[52:08] make you crazy but the religion of jesus
[52:10] christ
[52:11] if you are crazy it'll put you in your
[52:14] right mind
[52:16] i mean these christ brings us back to
[52:18] the state that adam was
[52:22] see but you're not right until you're
[52:24] born again you're not mentally right
[52:28] until you are born
[52:30] again how many believe that you can't
[52:33] even think right
[52:36] unless you got the holy ghost
[52:40] folks i'll tell you what just get away
[52:41] from the holy ghost you lose your temper

[52:47] you get mad it's temporary insanity
[52:50] that's right you don't think what you
[52:51] ought to think you don't say what you
[52:53] ought to say you don't act like you are
[52:55] that
[52:58] the second you lose your temper
[53:00] because you can't lose the temper until
[53:02] the holy ghost first because it ain't
[53:03] the holy ghost and all that
[53:08] come on folks
[53:09] man is not right unless the holy ghost
[53:12] is there
[53:14] and i got to thinking about the
[53:16] conditions that our world's in a man is
[53:18] not in his right condition also he says
[53:21] until he's born again he's a beast at
[53:24] his heart
[53:27] isn't it something folks that
[53:29] 75 years i guess
[53:33] right around 75 76 77 years
[53:37] i think it was around 1945 that was the
[53:40] end of the second world war
[53:43] 75 years later we're still slaughtering
[53:46] each other
[53:49] civilization modern civilization i don't
[53:53] know if you watch the news or not but
[53:54] i've watched some of that uh ukrainian
[53:56] and so forth and see these old grandmas
[54:00] going out there with a big bag
[54:02] all they can carry and somebody on the
[54:04] other side trying to get them there's a
[54:05] big guard rail just like they have a
[54:07] guard rail you know and she can't get
[54:09] over it so she crawls under the guard
[54:12] we've got grandmas running for their
[54:14] life having to crawl on the guardrails
[54:16] mama's with their babies strollers are
[54:18] left
[54:19] people getting slaughtered left and
[54:21] right why
[54:23] because
[54:24] i don't care if it's america or if it's
[54:27] russia
[54:28] they're not born again they're still a
[54:30] beast
[54:31] in their heart
[54:32] they can still do those type of things
[54:34] they're capable of those type of things
[54:37] if they're not born again
[54:40] huh
[54:41] you think civilized what did let him say
[54:44] about civilization there's nothing
[54:45] there's gonna be a civilization that's
[54:48] not civilized that's not civilized
[54:51] is it
[54:52] war is not civilized
[54:58] and i know how many knows america ain't
[55:00] got much to say
[55:02] we've been fighting all along
[55:05] we're just as bad
[55:07] that's right
[55:10] amen
[55:11] but not in his right condition the world
[55:13] is not why can't how can we expect
[55:15] anything else
[55:17] blood test how many know if there's war
[55:18] it's going to be wars and rumors of wars
[55:21] all the way to the end
[55:24] because see people are brute they're
[55:25] beasts
[55:27] amen they have no fear of god in their
[55:29] lives they're not born again
[55:32] but i'm glad
[55:33] for the grace of almighty god aren't you
[55:37] how many know that paul
[55:40] paul at one time he was ashamed of
[55:42] christ he persecuted christ and
[55:45] everybody that claimed to be a christian
[55:48] and then god or the lord jesus christ
[55:49] struck him down on the road to damascus
[55:52] and said he was great
[55:56] set him straight
[55:58] and what it must have been for paul
[56:02] to begin to testify because really what
[56:04] my focus is tonight is that we should be
[56:07] less ashamed to testify
[56:10] of the lord jesus christ
[56:13] because let christ come and do something
[56:15] in your life let him do something in
[56:17] your life
[56:18] i guarantee you you won't be ashamed
[56:22] ever since i got born again i wanted to
[56:24] tell the world of how good christ is and
[56:27] what it's really all about
[56:30] not a shame
[56:35] that's right
[56:36] just to tell just you want to share you
[56:38] want to tell the world
[56:41] and it gives you that courage to do so
[56:46] let's look at a couple cowards for a few
[56:47] minutes
[56:49] people who were religious cowards
[56:52] one of them was nicodemus
[56:56] right he was a christian and he wanted
[56:58] to talk with jesus and no doubt he
[57:00] wanted to you know
[57:02] have a conversation with him but when
[57:03] did he go to when did he go see him at
[57:06] night
[57:08] in private
[57:10] folks if you're a christian
[57:12] you know you're not a private christian
[57:17] but he went at night to talk to jesus
[57:19] and so forth at least he did that much
[57:22] right
[57:24] but he came to at night he was ashamed
[57:26] he was saying to them the other one is
[57:28] that family that couple whose son was
[57:31] healed jesus you know laid his hands on
[57:33] him and he was completely healed
[57:35] when the pharisees come down and put
[57:37] pressure on him
[57:40] to say who is it that healed him
[57:43] because anybody that confessed christ
[57:45] during that time was excommunicated and
[57:48] what did they say they said he is of age
[57:52] ask him
[57:54] because say they were cowards they
[57:56] didn't want to be excommunicated
[57:58] and i've said before my goodness if my
[58:00] son was blind that whole time wouldn't
[58:01] you want to say i'll tell you and i
[58:03] ain't careful about how i'm telling you
[58:05] this i'm here to tell you this guy that
[58:08] y'all hate so much that's who it was
[58:11] his name is jesus christ
[58:15] i wouldn't be ashamed with you
[58:17] no you wouldn't want to be but yet they
[58:19] were ashamed
[58:21] they were not 150 committed
[58:25] my
[58:27] they were ashamed
[58:30] praise be to god
[58:32] you know and many times this bravery
[58:37] this having this courage that comes with
[58:39] the holy ghost
[58:40] can get you killed
[58:44] huh
[58:45] i mean it was down in the dark ages in
[58:47] the catacombs of rome when those people
[58:49] would be hiding down there
[58:51] hey
[58:52] if they wanted to just end it they come
[58:54] up and they confess they're a christian
[58:56] am i right and they'd have to give their
[58:58] lives 68 million that were not cowards
[59:03] they were not cowards
[59:05] they gave their life
[59:08] because of their courage
[59:11] amen
[59:12] how many believes we got to be bold paul
[59:15] said pray for me that i can that i'll be
[59:17] bold
[59:18] to speak what jesus has done
[59:22] so is it in this day
[59:24] when it comes to the message of the hour
[59:25] there's a lot of people that just kind
[59:27] of keep it quiet just kind of
[59:29] come around the edges of it well we
[59:31] can't believe no
[59:33] not just kind of i believe he was a
[59:35] prophet of god
[59:36] i believe jesus christ manifested
[59:38] himself through him
[59:39] like in no other age
[59:44] amen
[59:46] praise the lord
[59:48] think about it think about those who are
[59:50] so bold
[59:52] and john the baptist let's start with
[59:53] john the baptist john the baptist was
[59:55] one that was
[59:56] he he wasn't
[59:58] he wasn't afraid he was in prison how
[1:00:00] many remembers he was in prison
[1:00:03] and he came out before herod i believe
[1:00:06] it was
[1:00:08] and
[1:00:08] as the prophet of god said the lie
[1:00:10] everybody was saying don't say nothing
[1:00:12] don't say that don't preach on marriage
[1:00:14] and divorce now
[1:00:15] because he was married to his brother
[1:00:17] philip's wife and it wasn't lawful
[1:00:21] and what was it right in front of all of
[1:00:23] them john the baptist went up and said
[1:00:24] it's not lawful for you to have her
[1:00:31] and i don't remember just who it was it
[1:00:33] was uh there was another
[1:00:35] there was another woman to remember and
[1:00:37] it was i wish i would never remember i
[1:00:38] should have studied just
[1:00:40] suddenly a little bit closer but i
[1:00:41] forget just who it was it was a a woman
[1:00:44] and he got to dance with her daughter
[1:00:46] and she asked for her he said give ask
[1:00:49] for whatever she wants for her i guess
[1:00:51] to the half of the kingdom and she asked
[1:00:54] he said will you give it he said yeah
[1:00:55] i'll give it to you
[1:00:58] because of that woman she says i want
[1:01:00] the head about john the baptist
[1:01:03] and he went and chopped his head off
[1:01:06] so his courage
[1:01:08] got his head chopped off
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:15] paul i mean knows paul
[1:01:17] because of his courage and boldness
[1:01:19] and not being ashamed
[1:01:21] ended up costing him his head
[1:01:25] right that's how job
[1:01:27] i mean paul was decapitated
[1:01:29] his head cut off
[1:01:32] peter
[1:01:33] he was brave
[1:01:35] he was bold
[1:01:37] i believe it was in uh acts of i'm not
[1:01:40] sure which chapter i've got it here even
[1:01:42] maybe we'll go to this one
[1:01:44] but in acts 4 and 13 says it this way
[1:01:49] after peter said neither is there
[1:01:50] salvation in any other for there is none
[1:01:53] other name under heaven given among men
[1:01:55] whereby we must be saved
[1:01:58] now when they saw the boldness of peter
[1:02:01] and john and perceived that they were
[1:02:03] unlearned and ignorant men they marveled
[1:02:07] and took knowledge of them
[1:02:10] that they had been with jesus
[1:02:13] how many know it's outside you'll never
[1:02:15] i mean you'll never be the
[1:02:18] same you're still looking at the effects
[1:02:21] brother tommy we're still looking at the
[1:02:23] effects of somebody that's met the lord
[1:02:25] jesus christ and it has changed my life
[1:02:28] forever
[1:02:29] to my dying day i will be a different
[1:02:32] person
[1:02:33] to my dying day i won't be ashamed of
[1:02:35] the gospel of christ
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:40] and peter they had take knowledge of him
[1:02:43] that they had been with jesus so peter
[1:02:46] had boldness
[1:02:50] and what was he but crucified what
[1:02:52] upside down
[1:02:55] you know maybe i get to know peter a
[1:02:57] little bit more but he was one of these
[1:02:59] outspoken guys wasn't he
[1:03:02] he'd stick his foot in his mouth more
[1:03:04] times and he was it was good for him
[1:03:06] that right
[1:03:07] because he says you know thou shalt
[1:03:09] never go and be crucified and so forth
[1:03:11] he says get thee behind me satan thou
[1:03:13] savior is not the things that be of god
[1:03:15] foot washing he says you know don't just
[1:03:17] wash my you will never wash my feet
[1:03:21] you're the you're the you're the king
[1:03:23] you know and when you i ain't gonna wash
[1:03:25] you're not gonna wash my feet then he
[1:03:26] says if i don't watch it no you're not
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:33] peter and his last breath
[1:03:36] was the same way he says well he was he
[1:03:38] was crucified straight up do me upside
[1:03:40] down
[1:03:42] huh
[1:03:45] but jesus loved him didn't he
[1:03:48] he loved the character of peter he was a
[1:03:50] different character but god loved him
[1:03:53] he says christmas crucify me upside down
[1:03:55] and they did from what i understand amen
[1:03:58] gave his life like that song
[1:04:00] you know they gave their life's blood so
[1:04:02] that this god's book could shine
[1:04:05] it's dripping with blood
[1:04:08] it's dripping with blood this holy ghost
[1:04:10] gospel it's dripping with blood
[1:04:14] brother brahm said he had dave had a gun
[1:04:16] on his
[1:04:17] sided on him
[1:04:20] and that right he didn't but he said he
[1:04:21] wasn't worried
[1:04:23] i'm not scared
[1:04:25] he wasn't worried
[1:04:28] he would gladly die he'd gladly die for
[1:04:30] the gospel's sake
[1:04:32] and he knows it's one thing they're not
[1:04:33] going to pull that trigger you're not
[1:04:35] going to pull the trigger unless they
[1:04:37] get permission first
[1:04:40] and that's from their headquarters from
[1:04:43] my headquarters
[1:04:46] isn't that right aren't you glad that
[1:04:48] the devil can't touch you until he gets
[1:04:50] permission first
[1:04:52] aren't you glad that no matter what
[1:04:53] happens no matter what trial you have it
[1:04:55] has to have permission before it comes
[1:04:57] upon you
[1:04:58] so that no matter what evil no matter
[1:05:00] what comes you don't have to be afraid
[1:05:05] i will never be afraid god is my rock
[1:05:08] god is my refuge let me please that will
[1:05:10] never be i have to be afraid you never
[1:05:12] have to fear
[1:05:17] amen i'm glad for that aren't you
[1:05:20] praise be to god that you don't have to
[1:05:22] be afraid
[1:05:23] as long as you know jesus christ
[1:05:26] amen
[1:05:29] another thing
[1:05:31] that really
[1:05:34] that's through faith let's talk about
[1:05:35] love for just a little bit
[1:05:39] sometimes people
[1:05:42] mistake courage
[1:05:44] for love
[1:05:48] in other words
[1:05:49] they think it's courage when it's love
[1:05:51] it's not really courage
[1:05:54] yet it is
[1:05:57] how about
[1:05:58] in army in the military brother bryan
[1:06:00] would probably know this as well as
[1:06:02] anybody but from what i understand the
[1:06:03] bad thing that happens a lot of time is
[1:06:05] in a military is it's called a unit
[1:06:08] right
[1:06:10] a group of men group of people that get
[1:06:12] to know each other and they get each
[1:06:14] other's back they fight for each other
[1:06:16] they fight to keep each other alive
[1:06:20] and if you love your unit if you love
[1:06:21] those on your unit guess what
[1:06:24] this let's say especially i believe it
[1:06:26] was a story brother daryl told many
[1:06:28] times and talking about being in the
[1:06:29] army and
[1:06:31] and what a man getting hit out there he
[1:06:33] was out there in an open fire
[1:06:35] and he was down
[1:06:38] and one of them says i'm going to get
[1:06:39] him they said no you can't go out there
[1:06:41] no you can't go out there i'm going out
[1:06:43] there
[1:06:44] huh
[1:06:46] and he went out there and grabbed him
[1:06:49] and come back and says drop him dropped
[1:06:50] him he's too heavy he's too heavy
[1:06:53] he says no he's not too heavy he's my
[1:06:56] brother
[1:06:58] see with so much love
[1:07:01] his love for his family
[1:07:03] it's love for your unit it's love for
[1:07:05] your brothers and sisters
[1:07:07] that gives you courage
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:11] but it's love how many knows love is
[1:07:13] more powerful than anything
[1:07:16] more powerful that's why paul said
[1:07:18] you know it's maybe not not so much
[1:07:21] courage as it is love he said what shall
[1:07:23] separate us
[1:07:24] from the love of god so tribulation
[1:07:27] persecution
[1:07:28] famine
[1:07:29] sword peril
[1:07:31] huh
[1:07:32] what's going to separate us it's not so
[1:07:34] much love but love produces it just
[1:07:37] gives you courage it's just there with
[1:07:38] it
[1:07:39] but it's love that it's the main force
[1:07:43] you all remember the story of the mother
[1:07:46] and the child
[1:07:47] the daughter that came back from college
[1:07:50] i believe it was and she was ashamed to
[1:07:51] show her friend
[1:07:53] her mom because her mom's face was
[1:07:55] terribly ugly
[1:07:56] y'all remember that
[1:07:58] and the train conductor after they got
[1:08:00] off and she was trying to shy away from
[1:08:02] mom
[1:08:03] right
[1:08:05] acting like she didn't know herself she
[1:08:06] just grabbed her by the arm and gave her
[1:08:08] what for isn't that right
[1:08:11] oh my
[1:08:14] told her you know i remember when your
[1:08:16] mom was twice as pretty as you are
[1:08:20] and when you was young when you was just
[1:08:22] a baby and the house was on fire
[1:08:25] and your mama to save you she loved you
[1:08:29] she went up through the flames
[1:08:33] through that fire came back completely
[1:08:36] and ended up disfiguring her
[1:08:39] but that baby lived
[1:08:41] how could that daughter ever be ashamed
[1:08:43] of her mom
[1:08:45] folks i don't know about you but that
[1:08:46] girl should have long before they ever
[1:08:48] came to a stop with that railroad she
[1:08:50] should have told her the story of her
[1:08:53] awesome greatest mother in the world
[1:08:58] so that when they got there the daughter
[1:09:00] says oh
[1:09:01] my goodness
[1:09:04] that is a hero right there
[1:09:07] look she did that for you
[1:09:09] go up to and shake her hand god bless
[1:09:11] you may you have a long life
[1:09:15] for loving your daughter that much
[1:09:17] i wish i had a mom like that
[1:09:19] huh
[1:09:22] so how many believes it's the love of
[1:09:24] god in the heart
[1:09:25] that pushes us that drives us
[1:09:28] that makes us not ashamed of the gospel
[1:09:31] gives us courage to witness other people
[1:09:33] around us
[1:09:35] about what god has done
[1:09:36] how many here will admit be honest that
[1:09:39] you've held back a lot of times
[1:09:41] when something in your heart said you
[1:09:43] should have spoke
[1:09:45] you should have given him a book
[1:09:47] brother branham's main main question to
[1:09:49] people was are you a christian
[1:09:54] why because he was concerned are you a
[1:09:56] christian are you a christian concerned
[1:09:58] about whether people are a christian or
[1:09:59] not
[1:10:00] his main concern was not to be afraid
[1:10:02] but look at an angle to be able to
[1:10:04] witness the people
[1:10:06] he said whether he's a picking pig
[1:10:07] farmer or a chicken farmer right
[1:10:10] or the atheist living up on the hill
[1:10:12] talk about the apple tree
[1:10:14] any way to try to witness to them and
[1:10:15] try to lead somebody to christ
[1:10:18] lord help us tonight to give us bravery
[1:10:20] give us courage not to be ashamed to
[1:10:22] reach out there and and put it out there
[1:10:24] and say jesus loves you
[1:10:26] god has said as a prophet in this
[1:10:27] generation
[1:10:29] i myself repent tonight say god help me
[1:10:32] there's many times that i've neglect
[1:10:34] that i haven't you know witnessed when i
[1:10:37] should have when i could it would it
[1:10:38] came into my mind you know maybe you
[1:10:39] should ask maybe you should tell that
[1:10:41] person about it
[1:10:42] i believe you have to be divinely led i
[1:10:44] do that
[1:10:45] but at the same time we need to have
[1:10:47] courage
[1:10:49] and not hold back
[1:10:51] amen
[1:10:53] because i believe we are the light of
[1:10:54] the world we are those that are supposed
[1:10:56] to be the witness
[1:10:57] to this world
[1:11:01] amen you think about all those who ended
[1:11:03] up it ended up costing their life
[1:11:08] i'll tell you this the homosexuals and
[1:11:10] all of them people they're not ashamed
[1:11:12] are they
[1:11:13] when they ought to be ashamed
