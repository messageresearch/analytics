[44:01] way it's just under 90. well anyway
[44:04] there you go 190 prop that's pretty
[44:07] widespan ain't it
[44:09] it's a wide span that in those days when
[44:13] the king of hazarus sat on the throne of
[44:16] his kingdom which was in shoes and the
[44:18] palace in the third year of his Reign he
[44:21] made a feast to all his princes and his
[44:23] servants the power of Persia and Mead
[44:27] media notice but I'm talking about this
[44:30] and this is the now this was way back in
[44:33] the times of the Persians and the medes
[44:35] amen the medes and the Persians we
[44:38] probably just know it by word we don't
[44:39] know that much about it unless of course
[44:41] you're a historian but during that time
[44:44] there was a time that they were like
[44:45] Russia and America and you know their
[44:48] superpower so to speak
[44:50] amen and the Nobles and the princes of
[44:53] the promise promises being before him
[44:55] when he showed the riches of his
[44:57] glorious Kingdom and the honor of his
[44:59] Excellency excellent Majesty many days
[45:02] even in 104 score days amen and when
[45:07] those days were expired the king made a
[45:09] feast unto all that were present in
[45:12] shushan the palace both unto the Great
[45:14] and the small seven days in the court of
[45:17] the garden of the king's Palace amen now
[45:19] I'm going to let you go ahead and be
[45:20] seated
[45:21] hey man so we see here that this king is
[45:25] quite something because I want to I want
[45:28] to bring it up a little bit because
[45:30] brother Branham talked about this and he
[45:31] typed this and there's a couple types
[45:33] that are made and I think it's quite
[45:35] something how that of course we know
[45:37] that probably a large portion of the
[45:39] reason that God chose to actually write
[45:42] a book of extra and become a Bible and
[45:45] to record a king of Persian and so forth
[45:49] uh and have all of this in here was
[45:52] because amen that we would even today
[45:55] take the things that are said as an
[45:57] example
[45:59] amen because I truly believe that even
[46:03] though the Bible is a history book
[46:07] a book of History should we say Amen the
[46:10] book of the past showing the past that
[46:12] doesn't mean that it's not still
[46:14] anointed
[46:19] amen it'll go on and on and on through
[46:21] all of eternity I believe it'll be real
[46:23] amen and so it's still anointed and God
[46:25] puts this in here amen
[46:28] and a for a reason
[46:31] my goodness gracious the old Devil's
[46:34] trying to get all up in my throat amen
[46:36] give me a sore throat or something we
[46:38] rebuke him amen praise the Lord but I
[46:41] thought about that I thought you know
[46:42] some there's a reason there's always a
[46:44] reason why God does things praise the
[46:46] Lord and he's the reason that he wrote
[46:47] this now I'm gonna I'm gonna skip over
[46:49] and Skip on down a little bit because I
[46:51] want to get to the moral of the story
[46:52] but notice he says for seven days they
[46:55] had a special Feast around the palace
[46:58] now the king had a palace now the next
[47:00] few verses talk about uh bash Thai how
[47:03] did she also had a feast in her house
[47:05] isn't that right all right and then uh I
[47:08] believe it was down in verse
[47:12] uh let's go to yeah let's go on down to
[47:15] verse 10. and on the seventh day well
[47:18] yeah vashti was on the ninth verse
[47:20] talking about having a having a feast at
[47:22] her house and on the seventh day when
[47:24] the heart of the King was Mary with wine
[47:26] he commanded
[47:29] oh boy I gotta print I just put a mark
[47:32] there he commanded then down at the end
[47:36] of the verse it says the seven chamber
[47:38] Chambers
[47:41] uh chamberlains
[47:43] the presence of hazarias the king all
[47:47] right so he commended his seven
[47:49] chamberlains to bring mashed out of the
[47:52] queen before the king with the Crown
[47:54] Royal to show the people and the
[47:56] princess her beauty for she was fair to
[47:59] look on
[48:00] but the queen Ash star refused to come
[48:04] at the king's commandment by his
[48:06] chamberlains therefore was very Roth and
[48:10] his anger burned in him but mentions he
[48:14] said that he got angry and that he was
[48:16] humiliated to the point that his face
[48:18] turned red
[48:20] amen but now whether humiliation or
[48:23] whether it's anger he got a little hot
[48:25] under the collar didn't he
[48:27] amen because his own wife wouldn't come
[48:29] when he called amen amen and so then of
[48:33] course we find in verse 13 the king said
[48:36] to the wise men which knew the times and
[48:38] the laws and the King's Men Are Stars
[48:39] all that knew the law and judgment so
[48:42] forth they said what shall we do unto
[48:44] the queen of Asha according to the law
[48:45] because she had not performed the
[48:47] Commandment of the King has arised
[48:52] by the chambermen chamberlains amen and
[48:55] so now notice here in uh verse 17 and
[48:58] for this deed of the queen shall come
[49:01] abroad unto all
[49:04] all the men all the women so that they
[49:07] shall despise their husbands in their
[49:09] eyes when it shall be reported the King
[49:11] has arised command that match died a
[49:13] queen to be brought before him but she
[49:15] came likewise shall the ladies of Persia
[49:18] Anita say this day unto all the king's
[49:21] princes which have heard of the deed of
[49:24] the queen thus shall there arise too
[49:26] much contempt and wrath and he pleased
[49:29] the king Let There Go a royal
[49:32] commandment from him and let it be
[49:35] written among the laws of Persians and
[49:37] the medes and that it be not altered
[49:40] that Ash die come no more before the
[49:42] King has arised and let the King give
[49:46] that her Royal Estate unto another that
[49:49] is better than she amen now I want to
[49:53] type ashtai with the denominational
[49:55] systems of this age
[49:58] amen and Esther of course she's going to
[50:01] be a virgin she's going to be God's
[50:04] chosen or God's elect is that all right
[50:07] praise the Lord and we're gonna actually
[50:09] bring you quotes and scriptures on that
[50:11] and of course now I'm gonna go on down
[50:13] to verse two if you would
[50:15] chapter two and after these things when
[50:17] the Wrath of the King has arised was a
[50:20] peace he remembered bastard and when she
[50:22] had and what she had done and what was
[50:24] the degree against her then said the
[50:27] king's servant administered on to him
[50:29] let there be a fair virgins be fair
[50:31] Merchants sought for the king and let
[50:33] the king appoint officers in all
[50:35] Providence of his kingdom that they may
[50:37] gather together all the fair young
[50:39] virgins to shushan the Palace to the
[50:41] house of the women unto the custody of
[50:43] haggai the king's Chamberlain Keeper of
[50:46] the women that let their things be be
[50:50] purification be given to them now notice
[50:54] in verse 7 and he brought up a hadash
[50:58] the that is Esther his uncle's daughter
[51:02] for she had neither father nor mother
[51:05] nor and the maid was fair and beautiful
[51:08] who Mordecai when her father and mother
[51:11] were dead took her as his own daughter
[51:13] and they came to pass it when the Kings
[51:15] commandment and his decree Was Heard and
[51:18] when many maidens were gathered together
[51:20] unto shushan the palace to the custody
[51:22] of hagai that Esther was brought also
[51:25] into the King's house to the custody of
[51:27] hagai Keeper of the women and the Maiden

[51:52] will try to go back and pick a few
[51:53] thoughts up here but and she obtained
[51:55] kindness of him and he speedily gave her
[51:58] things for purification

[52:04] denominational Waters we're Washed by
[52:07] The Wonder of the word amen this King

[53:30] now notice and Esther and I know there's
[53:32] Mercy Loudon he says in Mordecai walked
[53:35] every day now Mordecai is kind of like
[53:38] early Asia right somebody that kind of
[53:40] watched over us or kind of tutored her
[53:43] make sure that she was on the right path
[53:44] and so forth I mean even at any age it
[53:47] was kind of a person that brought
[53:49] Rebecca to Isaac isn't that right they
[53:52] meant just kind of like our prophet and
[53:54] our generation has introduced us not to
[53:57] some man not to himself but he has
[53:59] pointed us to him isn't that right
[54:02] amen kind of Mordecai like Ellie had
[54:05] walked every day before the court of the
[54:07] women's House of novias Esther's did and

[56:00] month Tibet in the seventh year of his
[56:03] Reign and the King loved Esther above
[56:06] all the churches I mean women
[56:10] how many believe that there's churches
[56:12] churches Brides Brides brides churches
[56:15] but there's one
[56:16] there's one that God really has his eye
[56:19] on there's one that God really favors

[56:53] all the versions so that he said the
[56:56] Royal Crown upon her head and made her
[56:59] Queen instead of vashtag Amen
[57:04] my notice in verse verse 19 that last I
[57:11] come no more before the King has arise
[57:14] and let the King give the Royal Estate
[57:16] unto another that is better than her
[57:21] oh
[57:22] praise be to God first of all
[57:25] make an example because I like it I like
[57:28] the way that the prophet put it when he
[57:30] said that uh with this example
[57:33] that Vash die had made it was a bad
[57:36] example
[57:37] I mean it was it it was a bad example
[57:39] amen then and according to the
[57:42] scriptures that we find out that amen
[57:44] that all the other women are going to go
[57:46] to act me like cheetahs
[57:48] Amen in one place I believe brother bam
[57:50] said that you know he says you know the
[57:52] women are going to get the attitude that
[57:54] when your husband ask them something
[57:56] that they're going to just say well
[57:58] let's go jump in the room
[58:01] amen why don't you fix me a sandwich
[58:03] honey would you fix me a sandwich or
[58:05] this out of the other amen well you know
[58:07] where the bread is you know what a
[58:08] sandwich is this morning I'll tell you I
[58:10] asked my wife I said honey you think I
[58:12] can have some I feel like some bacon and
[58:13] egg sandwich this morning yeah
[58:16] in a little while I was upstairs and she
[58:19] says honey your breakfast is ready I
[58:21] come down and making eggs and
[58:24] so forth and she even had some of my
[58:25] brother Steve's cucumbers and squash
[58:28] fried up and I had me a good Jubilee
[58:30] time
[58:31] and I thought my life ain't ruined she's
[58:34] not a vast eye hey man she don't tell me
[58:36] to go jump in a river
[58:40] and then isn't that the truth about
[58:43] what better man say about the women
[58:45] nowadays running things he says you know
[58:47] you better get out there and do that and
[58:48] you better get out there and do this
[58:51] too many bad guys
[58:54] oh my praise the Lord let me begin let
[58:57] me just begin with this
[58:59] amen because I want to talk about the
[59:01] bride's food
[59:03] amen this all comes from a little bit
[59:04] about the bride's food the bride's
[59:06] clothing dressing and so forth but about
[59:09] it makes a statement you're not feeding
[59:11] on the man man's words will fail but
[59:14] you're feeling on the unfailing body
[59:15] word of the son of man and if you
[59:18] haven't fed fully on every word to give
[59:20] you strength to Fly Above these
[59:22] denominations and things of the world
[59:24] well you at this time do so if man I'm
[59:28] at least it's time to fly a little
[59:30] higher by eating the right food we don't
[59:34] know how privileged we are and I hope we
[59:36] can get to express somehow just a little
[59:38] bit of how privileged the people we are
[59:40] to have the unadulterated word of God
[59:44] the way that we do
[59:47] amen
[59:49] amen the pure word of God the saith the
[59:53] Lord
[59:55] what denomination can say look our
[59:58] preacher when he gets done preaching he
[1:00:00] does if Jesus don't come do what he did
[1:00:02] with the woman that dwell and show him
[1:00:04] Life Alive like that you ain't got to
[1:00:05] believe what I said
[1:00:07] and then he comes down every time never
[1:00:09] fails and does it
[1:00:12] all I can tell you is this belief that
[1:00:15] you'll go to hell
[1:00:17] brother bam says because if you
[1:00:19] disbelieve now he is
[1:00:21] that is sin
[1:00:23] that is true unbelief
[1:00:26] if you see it happening it's absolutely
[1:00:28] Vindicated and then for you to
[1:00:30] disbelieve that's sin
[1:00:32] amen oh my
[1:00:34] brother Anthony questions and answers he
[1:00:36] was talking about how that you know
[1:00:38] people used to not love him and indeed
[1:00:40] and not look and look at him and just
[1:00:42] you know uh he'd go along and they'd be
[1:00:45] talking if he'd say hello they wouldn't
[1:00:46] even say hello to him on the streets and
[1:00:48] so forth he was he just meant nothing
[1:00:50] his family name was nothing is dead you
[1:00:52] know of course it was what he was and so
[1:00:54] forth and everybody looked down on him
[1:00:56] and so forth but you know towards the
[1:00:58] end of his end of his life he said he
[1:01:00] says you know people just didn't love me
[1:01:02] at all nobody had any use for me and he
[1:01:05] got to talking about how that even David
[1:01:06] one time was a sheep herder and so forth
[1:01:08] and God had taken him from the Sheep
[1:01:10] coat and so forth all the way and made
[1:01:12] him a great king and so forth and he
[1:01:13] says now look what God has done and you
[1:01:16] know even in my life people wouldn't
[1:01:17] love me or anything he says but now he
[1:01:19] says I gotta people pray for me and
[1:01:21] businessman's prospered by the people
[1:01:23] we've been in and all these other things
[1:01:25] that God has done because of what God is
[1:01:27] doing through the prophet and he always
[1:01:29] said it's not me amen but it's God
[1:01:32] people didn't love me at all nobody had
[1:01:34] any huge for me and now by the help of
[1:01:37] God I I believe that I am directing the
[1:01:41] Bride of Jesus Christ

[1:01:45] actually not just think that he was
[1:01:47] thinking he was without question

[1:01:59] it come to my mind and then directing
[1:02:01] the bride of Christ when I pulled that

[1:03:31] that'll compare it with the message that
[1:03:33] we have
[1:03:36] is there anywhere anybody that can even
[1:03:39] compare with the message of the hour
[1:03:42] there's no comparison there's nothing
[1:03:44] out there
[1:03:47] there ain't nothing like the message of
[1:03:50] the hour
[1:03:52] oh my
[1:03:54] I don't know half the quote but just
[1:03:56] before Brother Bear I'm about to talking
[1:03:57] about Mordecai he got talking about this
[1:03:58] and so forth he says you know you know
[1:04:00] that the Mordecai he had to be kind of
[1:04:02] kind of become ashamed or whatever and
[1:04:04] that's the way people people black you
[1:04:07] know I wonder how Jesus must feel and
[1:04:09] you know when he was sitting there
[1:04:10] having his teeth washed he wasn't
[1:04:12] welcomed
[1:04:14] kind of like a king man he was he didn't
[1:04:16] feel too good he was humiliated
[1:04:19] that's the way Jesus must feel living
[1:04:21] after God is done there he sits with
[1:04:24] dirty feet people pay him no attention
[1:04:26] when you come to church when you're at
[1:04:28] home and you're your car how about
[1:04:30] entertaining him a little bit
[1:04:36] amen praise be the God all right let me
[1:04:39] go on here I'm trying to
[1:04:43] show you
[1:04:45] that what we eat on is
[1:04:47] spiritual food in these seasons I mean
[1:04:50] he's glad for spirits of food
[1:04:52] and it's in due season right the right
[1:04:56] time
[1:04:57] amen oh my of course our brothers here
[1:05:01] and some of them having little churches
[1:05:02] but where would you go to to find it
[1:05:04] show its comparison anywhere you go
[1:05:08] right out there into denominational
[1:05:10] Creeds is all you got
[1:05:12] is that right horse and buggy cars these
[1:05:16] are all kinds of crazy all kinds of
[1:05:18] things like that
[1:05:19] oh my
[1:05:23] now notice
[1:05:25] what comparison you'll go right out
[1:05:27] there in the uh
[1:05:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ remember
[1:05:32] what place he says I didn't call you
[1:05:34] miss Jesus Christ
[1:05:37] how many believe that I I'm Mordecai has
[1:05:40] introduced us to our King Lord Jesus
[1:05:44] Christ
[1:05:45] you'll go right away from these other
[1:05:47] things he and here's where the food's
[1:05:49] been stored up well one message that I
[1:05:52] preached here to you all look I've been
[1:05:54] preaching from one to six hours to you
[1:05:57] on a message
[1:05:58] I know that the spoken word is the
[1:06:00] original
[1:06:01] seed
[1:06:03] about six hours long how many land to be
[1:06:06] able to Feast on that
[1:06:08] I got a quote out of there tonight I
[1:06:09] want to read to you oh I I take a week
[1:06:12] to take just a little bit here and a
[1:06:14] little bit there
[1:06:16] ah see because it's been stored up
[1:06:20] it's on tapes it
[1:06:22] wide on the tapes for people in their
[1:06:24] houses them temps will fall into the
[1:06:27] hands of the predestinated of God he can
[1:06:31] direct his work
[1:06:34] hey God's Gonna direct that word how
[1:06:37] many of us can say you know I heard a
[1:06:39] message I've listened to a tape and
[1:06:41] that's what caught my attention
[1:06:45] the way that he preached the truth that
[1:06:47] he sold
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:51] our Mordecai
[1:06:52] amen praise be to God
[1:06:56] that's right he can direct that word
[1:06:59] he'll direct everything just exactly to
[1:07:01] his course
[1:07:03] that's the reason he has sent me back
[1:07:05] here to do this
[1:07:06] starve up the food here and he forbid me
[1:07:10] even to go overseas
[1:07:12] store up food how many beliefs it's
[1:07:14] important
[1:07:16] my
[1:07:17] I don't want to go down here too far
[1:07:19] because I want to get to my message but
[1:07:21] think remember that when a woman that
[1:07:23] didn't have any food in that right and
[1:07:25] Elijah comment on he says you know give
[1:07:28] me a drink give me a food and give me a
[1:07:29] cake and so forth and then go make
[1:07:31] yourself one
[1:07:32] obey the word at first is what the
[1:07:35] prophet said when you come into
[1:07:36] obedience amen then that Chief AA for
[1:07:40] amen three and a half years he talked
[1:07:42] about there'll be a little group little
[1:07:43] elected lady amen that when everybody's
[1:07:46] starving to death She's gonna have us
[1:07:49] five seven course meal
[1:07:51] you can be eating good when the whole
[1:07:53] world's dying churches are dying people
[1:07:55] are dying but you can eat good
[1:08:02] amen you're going to eat something
[1:08:05] that's going to put you in a rapturing
[1:08:07] condition
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:10] oh praise the Lord
[1:08:14] hallelujah amen all right
[1:08:18] I get excited and I just kind of Amen
[1:08:20] get off my course but anyway
[1:08:23] praise the Lord now let's just look here
[1:08:27] so now notice and I want to compare
[1:08:30] this scripture with a New Testament
[1:08:32] scripture if I may
[1:08:33] Matthew 22
[1:08:35] and Jesus answered and spake unto them
[1:08:37] again by para old bulls and said the
[1:08:40] Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a
[1:08:42] certain King which made him marriage for
[1:08:43] his son and he sent forth his servants
[1:08:46] to call them that were bitten to the
[1:08:48] marriage or the wedding and they would
[1:08:52] not
[1:08:53] go ahead
[1:08:55] come
[1:08:56] they would not
[1:08:58] come
[1:09:00] and he sent forth other servants saying
[1:09:03] tell them which are bad and behold I
[1:09:05] have prepared my dinner
[1:09:08] he made a face how maybe God has made us
[1:09:11] a feast
[1:09:13] amen I gotta I I don't think I'll get to
[1:09:15] it tonight but I've got wrote down all
[1:09:17] all the things that are on that table
[1:09:19] that we can Feast on Amen
[1:09:21] some of the things
[1:09:22] prepared my dinner it ain't talking
[1:09:25] about taters and beans and steak it's
[1:09:28] talk about spiritual food amen
[1:09:31] my oxen and my fotlings are killed and
[1:09:33] things already come unto the marriage
[1:09:36] but they made light of it and went their
[1:09:37] ways one to his farm and other to his
[1:09:39] merchandise I'm in a note that
[1:09:41] tight regret it what you
[1:09:46] what she had positioned she lost her
[1:09:48] place
[1:09:50] he put her away
[1:09:53] and last I took her place not that side
[1:09:55] but Esther took her place somebody that
[1:09:58] was better
[1:09:59] than her
[1:10:02] now notice
[1:10:06] now we know brother bam says in them he
[1:10:08] says now we know that the little book of
[1:10:10] Esther how did Mordecai his uncle had a
[1:10:13] daughter and it was during the times of
[1:10:15] the Reigns of the meats and the Persians
[1:10:17] it's a very beautiful type there the
[1:10:20] king one of the greatest kings in the
[1:10:23] world of that day he had a great feast
[1:10:26] and he called the queen to come to set
[1:10:28] by it but she wouldn't do it she refused
[1:10:32] to do it
[1:10:35] now notice he's talking about a type and
[1:10:38] so what did he do he was so humiliated
[1:10:41] he didn't know what to do that
[1:10:45] That was supposed to come
[1:10:48] isn't that exactly what happened in our
[1:10:50] day
[1:10:51] God gave all those churches he gave oh
[1:10:53] he gave him last time so to speak a
[1:10:55] chance to come and sit by my side we
[1:10:58] didn't many times lay it down your
[1:11:00] denominational differences and come to
[1:11:02] the word
[1:11:10] but they would not
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:14] they wouldn't do it
[1:11:16] you know the thing of it is how many
[1:11:18] believe that
[1:11:19] God has actually
[1:11:21] uh not just them but he's given the
[1:11:23] whole world
[1:11:25] the invitation
[1:11:26] to come
[1:11:30] listen if you're sitting under the sound
[1:11:32] of my voice you hear me say Jesus said
[1:11:34] come unto me all ye who are weary and
[1:11:36] heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:11:41] amen whosoever will let him come
[1:11:46] when you hear that that is your
[1:11:48] invitation to come to Christ
[1:11:51] what you do with that depends on where
[1:11:53] you'll end up at
[1:11:55] you can't just turn down his invitation
[1:11:57] and do not be consequences
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:03] there is consequences when you turn down
[1:12:06] oh the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:12:09] through the ministry
[1:12:13] oh man I'm I'm scared to death for
[1:12:16] people
[1:12:18] one day you know when the very fire of
[1:12:21] God comes forth the ministers preach
[1:12:22] what the Holy Spirit puts on their heart
[1:12:25] and people say nah that's just brother
[1:12:27] Wilder that's just that preacher I don't
[1:12:29] have to leave I'm not going to listen to
[1:12:30] that I know he's just playing that at me
[1:12:34] you go ahead and think that and see
[1:12:35] where you end up at
[1:12:37] huh
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:41] praise the Lord
[1:12:43] now notice I want to bring something
[1:12:45] else up before I go on on this story
[1:12:47] now notice
[1:12:49] he says you remember in the Bible this
[1:12:52] was in marriage and divorce you remember
[1:12:53] in the Bible the king Mary Esther
[1:12:55] married Esther because the queen refused
[1:12:59] he just got him another one what
[1:13:01] happened when she refused to come out to
[1:13:04] the king to obey him the same thing it
[1:13:06] is with a woman that refuses to be wife
[1:13:09] to her husband
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:12] notice he says now notice
[1:13:17] and so is it with the church that
[1:13:18] refuses to become pregnant in the age
[1:13:21] that we are now living to bring forth
[1:13:23] children not to this age
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:29] I'm gonna stop on that quote and pick up
[1:13:31] another notice he can put her away but
[1:13:33] she cannot put him away he did it
[1:13:36] he's a loser Wesley Pentecost when they
[1:13:39] refuse to become the further part of him
[1:13:42] by having sexual
[1:13:44] spiritual sexual Affair to become
[1:13:47] pregnant with further part of the word
[1:13:50] in other words you just can't say where
[1:13:52] you're at you gotta keep growing
[1:13:55] you gotta go further and further in
[1:13:57] Christ when you stop and put a period
[1:13:59] for where you were at
[1:14:01] huh and you refuse to go further with
[1:14:04] God God has a right to put you away
[1:14:07] now notice Luther when he did to Wesley
[1:14:09] in Pentecost and they refused to become
[1:14:12] for the part of him now notice
[1:14:15] you understand she refused the Lutheran
[1:14:19] Church refused for Christ to have any
[1:14:21] more Desire with her loser refused it
[1:14:23] and let me say this you're going to call
[1:14:25] me something anyhow
[1:14:27] oh is it today with every one of them
[1:14:30] they'd failed to take that word they
[1:14:32] refused Christ
[1:14:35] and any woman that refuses a man his
[1:14:37] child has no right to be a wife to him
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:42] amen
[1:14:45] now notice
[1:14:47] now we're not lutherans we're not with
[1:14:49] this and neither are we Pentecostals
[1:14:52] we've got to be the children of this age
[1:14:54] through the pregnancy of the word of God
[1:14:57] to bring forth a child of this age
[1:15:01] how many believe is that
[1:15:03] amen
[1:15:05] now notice
[1:15:06] the sea child
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:09] my
[1:15:16] I'm going to stop and pick that back up
[1:15:18] there's another quote that I want to
[1:15:20] bring out how many remembers the spoken
[1:15:22] word is the original seat
[1:15:24] and brother Braham talks about uh uh the
[1:15:28] three different seeds that's been sown
[1:15:30] you know and the last one of course was
[1:15:32] his own Ministry he said he was a
[1:15:34] dentist seemed like to be the deadest of
[1:15:36] all of them
[1:15:37] but now notice
[1:15:39] he says notice now
[1:15:42] we believe that we're in the end time do
[1:15:44] we do we believe that before you have a
[1:15:46] crop now you have to plant a seed do you
[1:15:49] see why I've let the churches turn me
[1:15:51] out tell me everything call me all kinds
[1:15:54] of names and everything else and just
[1:15:56] stay right there with that word see
[1:15:58] there's a plan the seed's been planted
[1:16:01] it's already been planted friends it's
[1:16:05] already done
[1:16:16] oh that's one of the things that's on
[1:16:18] the table for us to eat is that seed
[1:16:20] amen it's got some seed on it that if
[1:16:23] you eat it you'll become it by the word
[1:16:26] aren't you glad you're not a
[1:16:27] denominational see you're not a
[1:16:29] Pentecostal seed you're a message sheet
[1:16:32] you're a word seed
[1:16:36] listen it won't it won't produce out
[1:16:39] there just in the middle there it's got
[1:16:41] to be in your heart
[1:16:43] that's where it's got to fall that
[1:16:44] seat's got to fall in somebody's heart
[1:16:46] somebody's got to believe that word
[1:16:48] accept that word into their heart
[1:16:52] amen aren't you thankful Lord help me to
[1:16:54] take that seat in
[1:16:57] let me let me just read you a little
[1:16:59] more is that okay
[1:17:02] my
[1:17:07] isn't it something how that
[1:17:09] Not only was this woman a type of a
[1:17:13] woman that would not go on and be with
[1:17:15] her husband
[1:17:17] but she actually a type of being
[1:17:20] pregnant with another man
[1:17:22] I'm listening oh there's a plan it's
[1:17:25] been sown
[1:17:27] it's already it's already done I love
[1:17:29] that it's already done I can say it now
[1:17:31] it's over
[1:17:34] she's done been
[1:17:36] planted
[1:17:40] what do you reckon is happening around
[1:17:42] the message
[1:17:43] what's going on
[1:17:46] I'll tell you what's going on
[1:17:49] we may not see the full effect of it it
[1:17:51] may not be the way that we think it is
[1:17:52] but I guarantee you one thing this seed
[1:17:54] is coming to maturity
[1:17:57] there is going to be a crop from this
[1:17:59] message
[1:18:00] there's going to be a group of people
[1:18:02] that is The Virtuous unadulterated
[1:18:04] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ that he's
[1:18:06] coming for
[1:18:08] because this message when we're talking
[1:18:09] about it is about getting ready for the
[1:18:11] Rapture folks
[1:18:12] it's Harvest Time amen and that seed has
[1:18:15] to come into you oh man here we are
[1:18:18] blessed be the Lord we come to the body
[1:18:21] to be the bride of Christ now to be
[1:18:23] flesh of his flesh bone of his borrow
[1:18:25] bone amen I mean please Spirit of his
[1:18:28] spirit
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:32] now notice listen
[1:18:33] what about these rains back here that
[1:18:35] y'all had claiming having to rain this
[1:18:37] down if it's on coming then it's over do
[1:18:40] we believe it like it was in the days of
[1:18:42] Noah long shopping he's getting his
[1:18:43] bride ready why didn't these Reigns why
[1:18:46] didn't you Pentecostals back there a few
[1:18:48] years ago when you started 40 or 50
[1:18:50] years ago why didn't you bring Christ
[1:18:52] the bridegroom to the bride I'm gonna
[1:18:56] let that soak in a minute why
[1:18:58] because you pregnant it yourself with
[1:19:01] your denomination
[1:19:10] word of God
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:14] that's exactly what you've done and he
[1:19:17] won't marry hard
[1:19:22] last time poor Vash time this hour
[1:19:25] how many knows she actually he was
[1:19:27] outside her door knocking
[1:19:30] she may have put him out but he put her
[1:19:32] out
[1:19:33] amen she pronounced her dad back in 1962
[1:19:37] the prophet of God said Pentecostals are
[1:19:39] dead
[1:19:41] amen
[1:19:42] Church of God all of them denominations
[1:19:44] are dead they have rejected God it
[1:19:46] doesn't matter how much that Turtle
[1:19:47] snaps his mouth after his head stopped
[1:19:49] off he's dead
[1:19:53] don't know it
[1:19:56] but the fruit of it has really come to
[1:19:57] fruition hasn't it
[1:19:59] oh I'm gonna let that soak in he won't
[1:20:01] marry her he will marry a virgin
[1:20:03] it's flat but that's the truth you know
[1:20:06] you'll know it in the flat way you don't
[1:20:07] have to wonder I don't stumble around
[1:20:10] about it amen listen we've got to be the
[1:20:14] children of this age through the seed
[1:20:16] that's been brought I hope you
[1:20:17] understand couldn't be pregnant no so
[1:20:20] what did he do he put her away in
[1:20:22] divorcement that's right
[1:20:24] but she dares put him away he put her
[1:20:27] away and he went right on revealing his
[1:20:29] word to the body and vindicating his
[1:20:31] saying by himself his children oh is
[1:20:35] this you
[1:20:36] his children uh began to kind of look
[1:20:40] more like him because it's fully Midori
[1:20:44] I mean it could say that's right I'm
[1:20:47] back I'm acting a little more like
[1:20:48] Christ lately I'm acting more like the
[1:20:50] one I've got more of a thirst for the
[1:20:52] word I've got more of it desire to have
[1:20:55] the same passions that Christ had and
[1:20:57] that it pleased the one that has sent me
[1:21:01] we should be acting a whole lot more
[1:21:05] like that seed word
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:08] praise be to God oh my
[1:21:11] to now notice that's right
[1:21:16] fully maturing or they
[1:21:19] they become the children of the word
[1:21:23] not children of the church
[1:21:25] Children of the word
[1:21:28] the bride will be a lovely lady of the
[1:21:31] word I'm not not not touched by man's
[1:21:35] organization
[1:21:36] any man-made Theory shall be purely
[1:21:39] unadulterated Bride of the word amen and
[1:21:43] amen I hope you get that out there in
[1:21:45] New York in the air she'll be
[1:21:46] impregnated daughter of God I mean
[1:21:49] that's what his table and that's what
[1:21:51] his church is in this hour we are
[1:21:52] pregnant by the word of God our womb is
[1:21:55] posed up and we ain't got no rules
[1:21:57] for men's ideas man theology wrong
[1:22:00] doctrines something contrary with the
[1:22:03] Buffett in the Bible says
[1:22:04] hello
[1:22:06] that's I don't know if this church or
[1:22:08] any church that's another God that's
[1:22:10] man-made

[1:22:25] part of
[1:22:26] I wonder what God is in it amen
[1:22:30] praise the Lord hallelujah so that's the
[1:22:33] part
[1:22:34] that I wanted to get
[1:22:35] if you'll notice
[1:22:37] how that they refused
[1:22:39] to go on
[1:22:41] they refuse to go further in Christ just
[1:22:44] like vashti refused when she refused not
[1:22:49] only the denominations refused but they
[1:22:51] took the seat man can you imagine how
[1:22:53] disappointing it was for Adam
[1:22:56] when he found out
[1:22:59] hey his little baby don't look like me
[1:23:03] looks more like the serpent

[1:25:02] beautiful women throughout the kingdom
[1:25:04] in Providence and he was over which was
[1:25:06] the greatest in the world
[1:25:08] and it came across this little Jewish
[1:25:10] girl she was kind of an outcast because
[1:25:12] like the Gentile see she was a outcast
[1:25:15] off to the side she had no father mother
[1:25:17] but Mordecai
[1:25:19] and she had to qualify
[1:25:22] amen folks I'm here to tell you God's
[1:25:24] not just going to take everything into
[1:25:26] the rapture
[1:25:28] no

[1:25:31] going to have to come up to the
[1:25:32] conditions you're going to have to come
[1:25:34] God's way I mean God has a provided way
[1:25:36] he has made it provided right for us
[1:25:39] today and he we have to come in that way
[1:25:42] oh and I don't know about you dumb more
[1:25:44] and more I said Lord take me deeper into
[1:25:46] your word Lord help me to understand
[1:25:48] more father
[1:25:50] amen
[1:25:52] I don't know about you but I'm on a
[1:25:53] closer walk with God
[1:25:55] how many always these eyes are closer
[1:25:56] walk with I would you like to stay long
[1:25:58] enough for me to just tell you how to
[1:26:00] have a closer walk with God tonight I
[1:26:02] want to tell you how to call what
[1:26:03] brother bam said you know this food
[1:26:05] that's on the table amen that this
[1:26:07] little virgin is eating this you know oh
[1:26:10] my
[1:26:11] and she had to go to qualifying so what
[1:26:14] they did they had to take these girls
[1:26:15] for a purification for many months and
[1:26:17] they had them perfume them and all kinds
[1:26:19] of adorning and fix them all up so that
[1:26:22] they could go before the king and that's
[1:26:23] just about the way the world wants to
[1:26:25] fix the church today Adorn it with the
[1:26:28] world
[1:26:29] huh
[1:26:30] Adorn and I looked up that adorned
[1:26:34] she was a door and Esther was adorned
[1:26:37] but she wasn't the door all the things
[1:26:43] how many believes the bride of Christ
[1:26:45] has an adornment
[1:26:50] amen
[1:26:53] in Philippians I guess it is
[1:26:58] no first Peter 3 and 1-4 likewise you
[1:27:01] wives being subjections to your own
[1:27:03] husbands that if any obey not the word
[1:27:05] they also May without the word be won
[1:27:07] but a conversation of the wives while
[1:27:10] they behold your Chase conversation
[1:27:12] coupled with fear
[1:27:13] who is adorning let it not be the
[1:27:16] outward adorning of the plating of the
[1:27:18] hair or the world or the putting on of
[1:27:20] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[1:27:23] the heart in that which is not
[1:27:26] corruptable even the ornament of a Meek
[1:27:29] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[1:27:31] of God a great price
[1:27:34] isn't this something that this King amen
[1:27:37] looked at Esther and it wasn't the
[1:27:39] perfume it wasn't the gold it wasn't the
[1:27:41] silver she didn't put all of that on
[1:27:43] but you had something down in there that
[1:27:46] he liked
[1:27:48] I'm gonna tell you right now when she
[1:27:50] bought herself before the king it wasn't
[1:27:51] by the adorning of the world and when
[1:27:53] you bring yourself to Christ it isn't
[1:27:55] that dawning of the greatness of a
[1:27:57] wonderful preacher you are a great
[1:27:59] church you have or whatever it might be
[1:28:01] it's gonna be what's not on the inside
[1:28:06] oh Hallelujah
[1:28:08] that's what God sees just like that rich
[1:28:10] young uh man that come from Chicago I
[1:28:13] believe he'd come out west you know to
[1:28:14] find him a wife and men that had a big
[1:28:16] dance and all of these other things and
[1:28:18] he went out and take a break from the
[1:28:19] dance went out behind the building and
[1:28:21] look at the little girl throwing out
[1:28:22] though schweiner in your bare feet and
[1:28:25] your dirty clothes
[1:28:26] but he liked her
[1:28:28] he looked at her and said no that's the
[1:28:30] kind of wife that looks like a real girl
[1:28:31] he went up to her and I'll tell you what
[1:28:34] she didn't do like all the other girls
[1:28:35] and come right up in the face and then
[1:28:37] just get off walked in everything else
[1:28:39] no she was a little shy and bashful
[1:28:44] huh but there was a character about her
[1:28:47] that she he liked that's the way it is
[1:28:50] with you and I it is not the outward
[1:28:51] adorning of things but it's what's down
[1:28:54] on the inside
[1:28:55] that makes a difference
[1:28:57] it isn't what we are on the outside it's
[1:29:00] what he is what he sees on the inside of
[1:29:02] us amen listen to pattern after the
[1:29:06] things of the world trying to get more
[1:29:08] members taking in anything for
[1:29:10] Fellowship it's a pitiful thing one
[1:29:12] organization trying to beat the other
[1:29:14] one that's all worldism
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:19] so it was to become a bride so she
[1:29:22] didn't want a none of this adorning of
[1:29:24] the world she wanted to go into the king
[1:29:26] just like she was
[1:29:29] in my hands no price I bring simply
[1:29:32] through thy cross I cling I am realizing
[1:29:35] I am nothing but Lord I just I'm a Meek
[1:29:38] and quiet and speaking quiet spirit is
[1:29:41] what she had
[1:29:42] which was in the sight of God a great
[1:29:45] price
[1:29:47] amen how many believes that the king got
[1:29:49] him a good wife
[1:29:51] he got a good woman
[1:29:53] amen
[1:29:56] nothing as good as a good wife
[1:29:58] praise God she adorned herself listen
[1:30:01] she adorned herself like the
[1:30:03] Pentecostals women ought to with a Meek
[1:30:05] and humble spirit
[1:30:07] amen and with all these fancy first
[1:30:10] ladies come by with their new Fang
[1:30:12] dangle things and the King looked at
[1:30:14] them and put them in the chamber with
[1:30:16] the concubines but when disaster come
[1:30:18] into his side he got a glimpse of that
[1:30:21] sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's
[1:30:25] hard
[1:30:26] go get
[1:30:28] the crown and put it on her how many
[1:30:30] knows there's a showdown coming when God
[1:30:32] is gonna put that Crown of Life on you
[1:30:34] and I take his interactions and this is

[1:31:42] you it'll give you strength it'll change
[1:31:46] your character it'll mold you into what
[1:31:49] you need to be that the king can look
[1:31:52] down on you and say that's what I'm
[1:31:55] looking for
[1:31:56] amen now before I really go into this
[1:31:59] vashtag thing I was really seeking Lord
[1:32:01] say Lord just give me something really a
[1:32:04] deeper walk with you and this is what it
[1:32:06] gave me so I hope you enjoy it is that
[1:32:07] all right
[1:32:08] let me see if I let me see if I can just
[1:32:11] close this up
[1:32:12] now notice like yesterday was the hidden
[1:32:14] man of the in the heart that hidden man
[1:32:17] the meekness and gentleness of the
[1:32:18] spirit in the human heart not the glory
[1:32:21] and class of the world as I've always
[1:32:24] said the gospel glows
[1:32:27] amen Hollywood shines but the gospel
[1:32:30] glows and it's a million miles apart the
[1:32:33] Church of Christ glows with loveness and
[1:32:36] softness and sweet and kind that's right
[1:32:39] amen
[1:32:42] praise the Lord
[1:32:43] Lord Jesus help us tonight to get to

[1:33:00] can I really get deeper you know deeper
[1:33:04] in you

[1:33:08] you know what he told me the same thing
[1:33:09] he always gonna tell you the way up is
[1:33:13] down
[1:33:15] because remember God is not into glamor
[1:33:17] he's not in big things
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:21] because Us in the message have to watch
[1:33:23] for that a little bit
[1:33:25] people liking big fancy things and
[1:33:27] everything else
[1:33:29] amen
[1:33:30] I don't think preachers are I think I've
[1:33:32] listened to a lot of preachers here more
[1:33:34] than I have and until lately until my
[1:33:36] son encouraged me to do it I hadn't
[1:33:38] hardly listened to any preachers but
[1:33:39] lately I have and I'm here to tell you I
[1:33:42] am amazed by the time I'm Amazed
[1:33:46] same things that we're preaching
[1:33:52] I mean whether it's thirst and and you
[1:33:54] know whole everyone the first Common
[1:33:56] drink of the fountain without money
[1:33:58] without price that and I could just
[1:34:00] mention a lot of stuff I'm saying well
[1:34:01] that's that's what that's right because
[1:34:03] I'll tell you right now folks that we
[1:34:04] used to man we'd have preachers come up
[1:34:06] here and preach the next guy to come up
[1:34:08] here beat you under the boy that was
[1:34:10] completely different from what
[1:34:12] yeah that guy said
[1:34:15] you're like but when you hear and you're
[1:34:18] hearing the same thing
[1:34:19] amen but we're all getting ready it's
[1:34:21] harvest time this is the Harvest time
[1:34:23] it's time to get ready to leave here
[1:34:25] folks
[1:34:26] amen
[1:34:28] oh my
[1:34:30] God so now notice
[1:34:32] let me see here
[1:34:34] he says God took Paul and made his slave
[1:34:36] out of him he says he bound him to
[1:34:39] himself and sent him to the Gentiles
[1:34:41] which he hated but you see he had to be
[1:34:43] loose from his ecclesiastical power to
[1:34:46] be bound to the power of God he had to
[1:34:49] lose his strengths and become weak and
[1:34:52] nothing in order to receive strength
[1:34:54] from God to be bound to God to do what
[1:34:57] God would tell him to do
[1:34:59] how many believes when you want a closer
[1:35:01] walk with god listen to this that's what
[1:35:03] we have to do today that's what we need
[1:35:06] that's what every man needs it's a loss
[1:35:09] of himself
[1:35:11] lose loss of his ability loss of what he
[1:35:15] is that he might have a complete healing
[1:35:17] to the Holy Spirit
[1:35:20] the housewife feeds it the Schoolboy
[1:35:23] needs that we all needed even our
[1:35:25] children need it
[1:35:27] all across the board
[1:35:30] amen the pastor needs on it
[1:35:34] no my
[1:35:36] now notice God said to Paul my strength
[1:35:39] is made perfect in your weakness
[1:35:43] we always seen how great we can become
[1:35:45] or you know a mighty and strong and this
[1:35:48] that and the other
[1:35:49] and Paul he was weak he says at least I
[1:35:52] be exalted of measure through the
[1:35:54] abundance of the revelations that's
[1:35:56] given to me in other words
[1:35:59] oh he Paul wanted to fly high he wanted
[1:36:01] to go way go way up there God says he
[1:36:05] says God has given me an infirmity in my
[1:36:07] flesh
[1:36:09] and now it just makes me weak instead of
[1:36:11] being big and powerful and great deep
[1:36:13] Revelation here I am just oh man
[1:36:16] I'm tired all the time I'm weak I can't
[1:36:18] see right I'd love to be able to read I
[1:36:20] gotta write and pick letters and so
[1:36:22] forth his eyes bothering him isn't that
[1:36:24] right
[1:36:27] God had a way of perfecting his strength
[1:36:31] in and through weakness amen
[1:36:35] now notice my my strength become more
[1:36:38] perfect as you become more weaker
[1:36:42] foreign
[1:36:48] you got to forget about your education
[1:36:50] let me tell you something me or anybody
[1:36:53] else when you ever think you got this
[1:36:55] you've heard to say you got this i got
[1:36:58] this
[1:36:59] you better watch that statement
[1:37:02] amen
[1:37:04] you know what we ought to be saying
[1:37:06] he got this
[1:37:08] he's got this I sure don't I ain't got
[1:37:11] this he's got this
[1:37:15] because you exalt yourself in the little
[1:37:17] bit and you exalt yourself just a little
[1:37:19] bit you think you got this you watch out
[1:37:23] amen God will show you you ain't got
[1:37:25] this
[1:37:27] praise the Lord
[1:37:29] oh my
[1:37:31] now notice
[1:37:34] and before I go actually uh
[1:37:37] into a little bit more of this I want to
[1:37:39] I I just had a few strength you know
[1:37:43] a few few things I want to point out to
[1:37:44] you
[1:37:46] but everyone says here's something to
[1:37:47] console us here's something that
[1:37:49] encourages out of weakness and humility
[1:37:51] God chooses the people to build his
[1:37:53] kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven
[1:37:55] if we ever stand in the presence of God
[1:37:57] with his church we'll stand in a bunch
[1:38:00] of people that's been weak and rejected
[1:38:02] and cast out by the world never Byram
[1:38:05] said Esther was kind of an outcast
[1:38:09] that's who God chose wasn't it David he
[1:38:12] was kind of an outcast can you imagine
[1:38:13] if David his brothers when they were
[1:38:16] growing up you're just a shrimp in the
[1:38:18] family you're just a shrimp get out of
[1:38:20] the way
[1:38:23] huh
[1:38:24] they all thought they were the great
[1:38:25] ones
[1:38:26] there's one thing that David learned is
[1:38:29] that not to lean on his own strength
[1:38:31] isn't that right and not his own ability
[1:38:35] oh my I hope we get this I know I've
[1:38:38] said it before this is about I've said
[1:38:40] I've said before I want to say it again
[1:38:41] listen Rick and reject and cast it out
[1:38:44] by the world and a bunch of go with
[1:38:47] nothings
[1:38:52] that wasn't even properly that's not
[1:38:54] even proper English yeah that probably
[1:38:55] isn't but it's the sweetest words that
[1:38:58] you'll ever hear
[1:38:59] because when you get to realize and you
[1:39:01] don't know so much it's when we think we
[1:39:03] know something is when we get in trouble
[1:39:05] when we get a whole bunch of knowledge
[1:39:06] up here we get ourselves all messed up
[1:39:10] oh he ought to be doing that and I know
[1:39:12] better than that and this I didn't look
[1:39:14] out
[1:39:15] huh
[1:39:17] not a bunch of know-it-alls
[1:39:20] but you got to come to the place where
[1:39:22] you realize you don't know nothing
[1:39:25] how many knows Jesus said without me you
[1:39:27] can do
[1:39:29] nothing so without him you're nothing so
[1:39:32] that makes you nothing
[1:39:34] it makes him what
[1:39:36] everything
[1:39:40] oh let's go
[1:39:42] praise be to God we can we mess
[1:39:45] ourselves up don't we
[1:39:47] amen as I've often said don't never be

[1:42:21] become nothing not a know-it-all not a
[1:42:24] great somebody but a nobody

[1:44:34] we don't need Revival of the flesh we
[1:44:37] need death death to the flesh
[1:44:43] we need God to the fudge the spirit is
[1:44:47] what we want to revive because it's him
[1:44:50] that we push out that we push away that
[1:44:52] we ain't got no time for on the
[1:44:55] Wednesday on a Sunday he gets back
[1:44:58] Christ it is revived it's the holy ghost
[1:45:02] that we need to revive
[1:45:04] my prayers say God I need a Revival the
[1:45:07] spirit needs a Revival this flesh don't
[1:45:09] need Revival
[1:45:15] how many believe that
[1:45:19] amen
[1:45:21] listen all of these campaigns brother
[1:45:23] Brown says and all that all of these
[1:45:24] Preachers did he said he didn't do no
[1:45:26] good
[1:45:27] he says what do did it do nothing and
[1:45:30] it'll never do any good until every
[1:45:32] person that professes to be a Christian
[1:45:33] will forget his own abilities and yield
[1:45:36] himself to God then God can achieve his
[1:45:39] purpose by sending not a Revival
[1:45:42] my brother but what he needs to send
[1:45:45] first is a killing I like that let that
[1:45:49] flesh die don't let the flesh revive
[1:45:54] Let It Die
[1:45:57] if we really want the Spirit Revival
[1:45:59] then we have to have a death to the
[1:46:02] flesh first even brother Bannerman is
[1:46:04] overages that's what we need that's what
[1:46:06] all of us need he said
[1:46:08] here and in the tape world everybody
[1:46:10] listening to this
[1:46:13] it'll change to a husbands treat their
[1:46:16] wives
[1:46:17] treat their husbands children their
[1:46:19] obedience
[1:46:20] every aspect of your life will change a
[1:46:23] little bit more than what you got
[1:46:24] tonight
[1:46:26] if you will die more to yourself
[1:46:31] amen my granddaughters they were arguing
[1:46:34] and fuss they like to argue and fuss
[1:46:36] they didn't want me to tell this
[1:46:39] they were in the pool and we were up
[1:46:40] they were jumping off the railing they
[1:46:42] had two rails to jump off into the pool
[1:46:44] they couldn't get along they weren't
[1:46:45] happy with that no I want that side no I
[1:46:48] want that
[1:46:49] I just switch sides I said yeah girls
[1:46:53] come here I want to teach you something
[1:46:54] I don't think I've told Grace this but I
[1:46:56] said I want to teach you something first
[1:46:58] of all let me tell you something you
[1:46:59] know how not to argue
[1:47:00] let me teach you how you really ought to
[1:47:02] do it you ought to have preference and
[1:47:04] and this is why we preach all the time
[1:47:06] about dying to yourself why don't you
[1:47:07] die to yourself and ask what the other
[1:47:10] person would like ask Evelyn ask her
[1:47:12] which side do you want to climb on
[1:47:17] them like yeah I want to climb up that's
[1:47:19] I know amalon now you ask Elena which
[1:47:23] side do you want to climb on
[1:47:26] huh
[1:47:29] and they say well okay we'll ask that
[1:47:32] and then then what is the conclusion now
[1:47:34] what do you really do what should the
[1:47:36] outcome I said the outcome be is you
[1:47:39] should say look whichever side you want
[1:47:41] you go on there okay because I you go
[1:47:43] ahead and take that side because I know
[1:47:44] you want to climb the wide side
[1:47:46] huh

[1:47:57] thank you
[1:48:01] everyone
[1:48:03] oh boy if that'll work but anyway I
[1:48:06] thought it was funny

[1:48:13] oh my death to ourselves right I said
[1:48:16] that's what we teach about girls it's
[1:48:17] about dying to yourself

[1:48:49] what good did it do it'll never do any
[1:48:51] good until every person that professes
[1:48:52] to be a Christian will forget his own
[1:48:53] abilities he yield himself to God God
[1:48:55] will achieve by sending another Revival
[1:48:57] brother but what he needs to send is a
[1:48:59] killing first so that we can revive he

[1:53:18] where you get together what you do
[1:53:20] brother say with us saith the Lord I
[1:53:23] want some of them to come and tell me
[1:53:24] where that's wrong what he's teaching
[1:53:26] show me in the word where God word of
[1:53:30] God where that's wrong yeah they won't

[1:53:48] picks the nobodies then he makes them
[1:53:50] somebody's for him amen maybe not even
[1:53:53] in this life but in the world to come
[1:53:56] how many knows we don't care if we're

[1:54:06] evening

[1:54:21] Christian but I just don't have time to
[1:54:23] pray uh oh there you go right there
[1:54:26] you're too busy with yourself
[1:54:28] to give God your time is that right
[1:54:31] there's so much of our self that's
[1:54:34] what's keeping more of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:35] away how many is guilty of in one manner
[1:54:38] or the other of keeping God out because
[1:54:41] you're still too much centered on
[1:54:44] yourself you're not quite dust yet amen
[1:54:48] or and that's the easiest thing in this
[1:54:51] life to do because as long as we're
[1:54:53] drawing breath there's a chance for this
[1:54:55] thing to revive ain't that true this
[1:54:57] thing will revive maybe we possibly can
[1:55:01] amen
[1:55:02] but we got to keep ourselves down there
[1:55:04] and realize
[1:55:06] that it's only
[1:55:08] God in us
[1:55:11] that's anything
[1:55:13] it's powerheads
[1:55:15] Lord Jesus we come before you tonight
[1:55:18] and
[1:55:19] Lord by going over time I feel like
[1:55:22] we're just dying to ourselves a little
[1:55:23] let's forget about our precious time
[1:55:26] and the time that we would quit but Lord
[1:55:28] we want to take a few minutes now Lord
[1:55:29] and talk to you
[1:55:32] to search our hearts Let each person in
[1:55:34] here search their heart
[1:55:37] do you want a closer they want they want
[1:55:39] perfect strength you want God to have
[1:55:41] his strength perfect in you
[1:55:44] he said to Paul my my strength is made
[1:55:46] perfect
[1:55:48] when you're weak
[1:55:51] Lord sometimes you have to bring us to
[1:55:53] those places of weakness sickness
[1:55:56] troubles
[1:55:58] Red Seas
[1:56:00] that's all things that you do to bring
[1:56:02] us to break us down and to crush us to
[1:56:05] the dirt to make us realize hey there's
[1:56:07] this is something that you can't deal
[1:56:09] with
[1:56:10] this is something that you ain't got
[1:56:12] this
[1:56:13] you need me I got this
[1:56:16] and help us to realize that as David did
[1:56:18] he never gave the glory to himself for
[1:56:20] the lion the bearer or Goliath he gave
[1:56:22] you the glory Lord
[1:56:24] Lord as have we asked God tonight that
[1:56:26] you help each person in here tonight
[1:56:28] Lord
[1:56:29] that you'd look at their hearts
[1:56:31] they'd look at their hearts look at
[1:56:33] their life
[1:56:36] we all desire to have a closer walk with
[1:56:39] you that's my desire God and you've
[1:56:41] already shown Us hall and I truly
[1:56:42] believe tonight that you're just taking
[1:56:44] us back to the Simplicity of your word
[1:56:46] Lord
[1:56:47] we ask God tonight that as we raise our
[1:56:49] hands and surrender us to you we ask God
[1:56:51] that you would kill us
[1:56:53] you would kill
[1:56:55] the flesh Lord we raise our hands in
[1:56:58] surrenderance
[1:57:00] so to speak put it in that Inferno the
[1:57:03] fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:05] and let it cremate ourself
[1:57:08] let that self die as the prophet God
[1:57:12] said not just die but rot
[1:57:16] Lord Jesus be gone let people not see
[1:57:19] these people that are here tonight
[1:57:21] anymore but let people see Christ
[1:57:24] reflected in their lives
[1:57:27] Lord we ask in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:29] that you would take this Wednesday night
[1:57:30] service Lord and help everybody to go
[1:57:34] out those doors more determined than
[1:57:35] ever to serve you on a greater measure
[1:57:38] than what they have when they came in
[1:57:40] tonight Lord more dedicated to you more
[1:57:43] dead to their self more consecrated to
[1:57:45] you to think about you day and night to
[1:57:48] keep their hearts and Minds centered on
[1:57:50] you realizing God that you have chosen
[1:57:54] us you have put something in us that
[1:57:56] makes us want to be that way we would
[1:57:59] never want to be that way in ourselves
[1:58:01] it's you that has put this desire in our
[1:58:03] hearts and we thank you God for that
[1:58:06] wonderful desire that you have put in
[1:58:08] these people's lovely hearts Lord Jesus
[1:58:10] to assemble themselves together Lord
[1:58:12] Jesus to hear your word
[1:58:14] to chasten this Lord to correct this
