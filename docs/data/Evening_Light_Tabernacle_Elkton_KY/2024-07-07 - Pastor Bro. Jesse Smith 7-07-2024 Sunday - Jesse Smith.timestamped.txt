[1:00:14] bride so father God just have your way

[1:00:22] thankful that you created us for your
[1:00:23] pleasure and we only want to do that we
[1:00:26] only want to live for your pleasure God
[1:00:28] may we please you this morning in Jesus
[1:00:30] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[1:00:32] God bless you as you're being seated
[1:00:34] praise
[1:00:37] God one of the brothers helped me on my
[1:00:39] uh my dates last night when I was
[1:00:41] talking about how my daughter was you
[1:00:43] know writing prayer requests for that
[1:00:44] brother that got saved she was only two
[1:00:47] or three years old Caris and she would
[1:00:48] raise her hand at our church I'll say
[1:00:50] now who has a public prayer
[1:00:52] request and my daughter was two or three
[1:00:55] years old Caris and she'd say pray for
[1:00:57] brother Austin to come
[1:00:59] back cuz she couldn't write yet so we
[1:01:02] talked about that and then as she got
[1:01:04] older you know almost every service her
[1:01:06] little hand would go up pray for brother
[1:01:08] Austin to come back and God heard a
[1:01:10] three-year-old's Prayer by God's grace
[1:01:12] church it don't matter what age you are
[1:01:15] Hallelujah God uh God is glorified God
[1:01:18] hears your prayers and and God God is
[1:01:21] faithful Hallelujah God wants him
[1:01:23] himself to be real to the littlest child
[1:01:25] amen and to the the most uh mature Elder
[1:01:29] we'd say right the most mature message
[1:01:32] believer God wants to be just as real to
[1:01:33] the most mature message believer as the
[1:01:36] most humble little
[1:01:37] child because Jesus said you got to
[1:01:39] become like a child to enter in the
[1:01:41] kingdom of
[1:01:42] God hallelujah so I'm going to try not
[1:01:45] to look at the clock you know I got I
[1:01:47] got a long drive back tonight by God's
[1:01:48] grace I think it's seven hours in 20
[1:01:50] minutes that's without
[1:01:51] stops and we got some events we got to
[1:01:54] take care of but we'll trust the lord to
[1:01:55] bless BL today Hallelujah so the word uh
[1:01:58] praise here uh means to make a boast
[1:02:01] about
[1:02:02] accomplishments so in the Hebrew when it
[1:02:04] says praise His name it means boast on
[1:02:08] God's
[1:02:09] accomplishments so see when we know
[1:02:11] we're praising God when we're saying
[1:02:13] look what God did not what I did look
[1:02:16] what God did that's really praising God
[1:02:20] hallelujah and then uh name means
[1:02:24] reputation fame or glor Glory Hallelujah
[1:02:27] so we're we're we're boasting on we're
[1:02:29] praising boasting on God's
[1:02:31] accomplishments for his Fame to make him
[1:02:34] more famous to make him receive more
[1:02:37] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah and of
[1:02:40] course you know Jehovah uh means the
[1:02:42] existing one so Lord God you know praise
[1:02:45] the name of the Lord God Lord God means
[1:02:47] Jehovah Elohim or the existing one or
[1:02:50] the strong one Hallelujah so we praise
[1:02:53] him and then the Bible said Praise Him
[1:02:55] in the the dance
[1:02:56] now uh in Psalm chapter 150 verse1 it
[1:03:00] says praise ye the Lord praise God in
[1:03:02] the sanctuary Praise Him in the
[1:03:04] firmament of his power praise him for
[1:03:06] his mighty ex Praise Him according to
[1:03:09] his excellent greatness praise him with
[1:03:11] the sound of the trumpet praise him with
[1:03:13] the Sury in the harp praise him with the
[1:03:15] timberl and dance praise him he says
[1:03:19] with string instruments and organs
[1:03:21] Praise Him upon the loud symbols Praise
[1:03:23] Him upon the high sounding symbols let
[1:03:25] everything that ha breath praise the
[1:03:27] Lord Praise ye the
[1:03:29] Lord amen but I I love these chapters
[1:03:33] these these two chapters are like twins
[1:03:35] you know like they just go together
[1:03:37] Hallelujah uh brother Ram said faith and
[1:03:40] grace are twins he said they're sisters
[1:03:42] because you can't have uh faith without
[1:03:44] grace and grace without faith amen you
[1:03:46] got to have both and uh so but it the
[1:03:49] Bible says let them praise His name in
[1:03:52] the dance in Psalm 149:3 let them
[1:03:56] so we have to look at uh something here
[1:03:58] you know uh we have to let them so that
[1:04:00] means let means
[1:04:02] allow we have to allow them to praise
[1:04:05] God with a
[1:04:06] dance right because someone's trying to
[1:04:09] forbid them from
[1:04:11] dancing who's trying to forbid people
[1:04:13] from praising God who's trying to forbid
[1:04:16] people from dancing for Jesus well I
[1:04:18] think we all know the answer to that
[1:04:21] Lucifer Satan that old serpent that
[1:04:24] Dragon Hallelujah
[1:04:26] right praise God s God's enemy right so
[1:04:31] we have to allow people to praise him in
[1:04:33] the dance because Satan wants to forbid
[1:04:36] us from worshiping God hallelujah but
[1:04:39] God commands it he says let them and
[1:04:42] then he says praise them he didn't say
[1:04:44] if you want to he said Praise Him in the
[1:04:46] dance so this is the holy spirit saying
[1:04:49] praise me with the dance praise me with
[1:04:52] the timberl praise me with the string
[1:04:54] instruments God wants us to praise Him
[1:04:57] hallelujah oh my scripture makes it
[1:05:00] clear that we are to boast on God's
[1:05:03] accomplishments and give more and boast
[1:05:06] on the fame of God and the word dance
[1:05:09] did you know this in the Hebrew the word
[1:05:11] dance means to twist or
[1:05:14] twirl so it doesn't mean what the world
[1:05:17] thinks it does it just means to twist
[1:05:19] your body or to twirl around like this
[1:05:21] just a Twist in a circle I looked up
[1:05:24] online and uh the Jews even the the the
[1:05:26] Jews today have all these they have
[1:05:28] three or four different dances that they
[1:05:29] do together and one of them is they just
[1:05:31] dance like this another one they join
[1:05:33] hands you know women with the women and
[1:05:35] they just dance in a circle like this
[1:05:38] and they're fulfilling what the Hebrew
[1:05:39] says the Hebrew says you're supposed to
[1:05:42] twist in a circle and give God glory the
[1:05:46] Bible commands it God said you're
[1:05:48] created for it Hallelujah God says I
[1:05:52] take pleasure when you do it so right
[1:05:55] here like like this God takes pleasure
[1:05:56] in me Dan I got plenty of room to dance
[1:05:59] up here amen hallelujah remember that
[1:06:02] one preacher said you ain't got enough
[1:06:03] room for me to preach up here there's
[1:06:06] plenty of room to dance and preach up
[1:06:08] here hallelujah thank God
[1:06:10] Amen we were created for this purpose
[1:06:14] let them allow them to praise God in the
[1:06:17] dance
[1:06:19] Hallelujah Satan is trying to stop your
[1:06:22] dance Satan's trying to stop your praise
[1:06:25] Hallelujah and so we've got to if you
[1:06:27] don't have your dance you've got to get
[1:06:29] it
[1:06:30] back if you've never had a dance you got
[1:06:33] to find
[1:06:35] it is that right you no you you're
[1:06:38] telling me Oh Brother Jess I can never
[1:06:39] you're telling me they could dance under
[1:06:41] the blood of bulls and goats that could
[1:06:43] never take away sin but you and I are
[1:06:47] the devil trying to makes us not dance
[1:06:49] when we have a perfect blood of a
[1:06:52] perfect lamb a perfect sacrifice that
[1:06:55] doesn't cover sin he abolishes
[1:06:59] sin he we got a bleach brother brand
[1:07:02] said a bleach that sends it back to
[1:07:05] Satan
[1:07:06] Hallelujah the bleach of the blood
[1:07:09] Hallelujah you're telling me they could
[1:07:11] dance under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:07:12] but we can't dance for the sinless Son
[1:07:15] of God who gave his life for us died on
[1:07:18] the cross and then he rose amen the
[1:07:21] Bible said he rose for our justification
[1:07:25] that means he declares you righteous as
[1:07:27] you wish to be
[1:07:30] Hallelujah I think you see where I'm
[1:07:32] going today by God's grace oh my when I
[1:07:36] first became a Christian I wasn't in the
[1:07:37] message I told you that story last night
[1:07:40] I was in a uh kind of like a mega church
[1:07:42] it's like a presbyterian Baptist
[1:07:44] Church and when I first got saved I was

[1:08:00] soon as I went to church I wanted to
[1:08:01] praise God there was something brother
[1:08:03] Danny there was something in me bubbling
[1:08:04] I want to praise God but we were in a
[1:08:06] mega church that didn't really encourage
[1:08:08] it so I would look around and as long as
[1:08:11] somebody else was raising their hands I
[1:08:12] go like
[1:08:13] this now inside I wanted to go like

[1:11:24] things and for all these things they
[1:11:26] were created for God's pleasure
[1:11:28] Revelation 4:11 Colossians 1:16 and then

[1:13:00] hallelujah now friends Romans 9:25 I
[1:13:03] don't think I gave this to the brother
[1:13:05] but Romans 9:25 said as he saith in
[1:13:07] Hosea I will call them my people which
[1:13:10] were not my people and her beloved which
[1:13:14] was not
[1:13:15] beloved and it shall come to pass and
[1:13:17] the place where it said unto them ye are
[1:13:19] not my people they shall be called the
[1:13:21] children of the Living God friends God
[1:13:24] has made us God cut off Israel to graft
[1:13:27] us into the holy tree we're living on
[1:13:30] the life of the Holy
[1:13:32] tree I am grafted in I'm living on the
[1:13:37] life of Jesus
[1:13:39] Christ and he calls me three things I'm
[1:13:42] his beloved his people and his
[1:13:45] child what else could I want my life
[1:13:48] other than to be beloved of
[1:13:51] God what else would I want I'm his I'm
[1:13:54] his I'm a sweetheart we're a sweetheart
[1:13:56] praise
[1:13:58] God that's what he's made
[1:14:00] us we we weren't that before how many
[1:14:03] remember when you weren't you you were a
[1:14:05] sinner how many still remember your life
[1:14:07] as a
[1:14:08] sinner
[1:14:10] Hallelujah we we weren't we were we were
[1:14:12] the Bible said we were far from the
[1:14:14] Covenant far from the promises but the
[1:14:16] blood of Jesus Christ has brought us
[1:14:19] nigh to these promises amen now we're
[1:14:22] the Beloved of God enjoying the
[1:14:25] blessings of This Promise that's
[1:14:26] Covenant to us hallelujah amen I want
[1:14:30] you to see what brother bam called
[1:14:32] dancing I'm just going to look at this
[1:14:33] for a moment brother Bram says this in
[1:14:34] basis of Fellowship 1961 I preached on
[1:14:36] this last
[1:14:37] night brother talking about a songwriter
[1:14:40] he said William cper was his name he
[1:14:43] said as soon as the inspiration left him
[1:14:45] he was there and he he wrote the song
[1:14:48] and when he was in such a high key where
[1:14:50] the people don't know nothing about it
[1:14:52] just to sing and shout and dance so you
[1:14:55] see that a man who write who writes
[1:14:57] songs or a woman who writes poems
[1:14:59] brother said they get lifted up in such
[1:15:01] a spot where they can sing and they can
[1:15:03] write songs and they can do all these
[1:15:05] things and dance he says that's in the
[1:15:08] spirit all right he said but it's the
[1:15:10] Spear of
[1:15:12] Joy do you catch that Spirit of Joy so
[1:15:16] for somebody to dance in the spirit they
[1:15:19] got to be empowered to do it if you're
[1:15:22] going to dance you need the spirit of
[1:15:24] dancing yeah brother said if they want
[1:15:26] the spirit of the world they got to play
[1:15:27] The Rock and Roll they got to play the
[1:15:30] rap they got to get under that Spirit
[1:15:32] they're getting under the Spear of
[1:15:34] Destruction for the tribulation we're
[1:15:36] getting under the spirit of the Rapture
[1:15:37] praise God Amen we're getting the spirit
[1:15:40] of joy and victory and promises and
[1:15:44] God's faithfulness
[1:15:46] Hallelujah you just got to get in the
[1:15:49] spirit of joy and brother said that
[1:15:52] produces
[1:15:53] dancing that produces songs that
[1:15:56] produces worship
[1:16:00] Hallelujah Exodus 15:20 and Miriam the
[1:16:04] prophetess the sister of Aaron took a
[1:16:06] timberl in her hand and all the women
[1:16:08] went out after her with timberl and
[1:16:13] dances this is the first recording of
[1:16:16] dancing if you start chronologically at
[1:16:18] the front of the
[1:16:20] Bible Miriam picks up a tambourine now
[1:16:23] why was she dancing
[1:16:26] Hallelujah she got the victory praise
[1:16:28] God they were being chased down by the
[1:16:31] world's greatest army they were cornered
[1:16:35] Moses cries out God would you do
[1:16:37] something he said speak the word
[1:16:40] hallelujah Don't Cry To Me Speak the
[1:16:42] word amen hallelujah and yet we what do
[1:16:46] we often do it just helps us out we
[1:16:48] always cry out to God too why why why
[1:16:50] God said speak the word son speak the
[1:16:52] word daughter just speak God's word
[1:16:54] hallelujah
[1:16:56] Hallelujah and then you know the story
[1:16:58] Moses stretches out the rod they all
[1:17:00] walk through on dry ground praise God
[1:17:03] and then once they get through Moses
[1:17:05] takes the rod down all the waters fall
[1:17:07] and all their past sins all their past
[1:17:11] uh C task Masters all the bondage and
[1:17:14] slavery was done
[1:17:17] for I've got no more slave masters amen
[1:17:21] I'm not a slave to anybody anymore no
[1:17:23] wonder and 85y old woman how old are you
[1:17:28] sister 75 she has awesome testimony you
[1:17:32] too by God's grace he was Glenn was
[1:17:34] blessing me with that testimony last
[1:17:36] night I was like Hallelujah man I'm more
[1:17:38] blessed for just coming here praise God
[1:17:40] she's 75 but an 85 year old woman saw
[1:17:43] all that and she said sisters follow
[1:17:51] me come on I'm 85 years old sisters come
[1:17:54] on
[1:17:56] an 85y old woman she wasn't some spring
[1:17:59] chicken
[1:18:00] now but she was so moved by the power of
[1:18:04] God that's the first time God recorded
[1:18:06] dancing
[1:18:08] Hallelujah and what does that symbolize
[1:18:10] that symbolizes you repenting of your
[1:18:13] sins oh that represents you getting
[1:18:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:20] Christ amen and all your past sins have
[1:18:24] been buried in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:18:28] hallelujah oh
[1:18:31] my
[1:18:33] Hallelujah read 1 Corinthians 10 they
[1:18:35] were all baptized under Moses that
[1:18:37] represents the Waters of baptism how

[1:19:03] without rebuking Colossians chapter 1
[1:19:05] the Bible said forgiven all your
[1:19:10] trespasses you are forgiven all your
[1:19:13] trespasses I have an awful past I I did
[1:19:17] so many wicked things I wasn't raised in
[1:19:18] the message but when I read that verse I
[1:19:21] condemn because when I was baptized God
[1:19:23] forgave all of it praise God now I can
[1:19:26] twist now I can twirl for God's pleasure
[1:19:32] Hallelujah that's right
[1:19:35] amen Satan will try to remind me of that
[1:19:37] like they say remind him of his future

[1:19:42] let me remind you of your future
[1:19:44] Hallelujah that's
[1:19:46] right brother BR was a young Pastor you
[1:19:49] probably remember this he was doing a
[1:19:51] New Year's Eve service he said he
[1:19:53] preached uh three hours on the return of
[1:19:55] Jesus and he took a break about three
[1:19:57] hours or about half an hour and a half
[1:19:59] into it he was drawing the Rapture on a
[1:20:01] chalkboard remember this at brandom
[1:20:05] Tabernacle he sat down for an
[1:20:07] intermission some sisters got up there
[1:20:09] to play a special and they started
[1:20:11] playing there's going to be a meeting in
[1:20:15] the air in that sweet sweet by and
[1:20:21] by and brother Ram said one of those
[1:20:23] censors had a thimble and she had a
[1:20:27] washboard and I did this at my church I
[1:20:29] brought a washboard in and a thimble
[1:20:31] okay talk about embarrassing myself I'll
[1:20:33] do anything for
[1:20:35] Jesus I don't care if God calls me to do
[1:20:39] it he'll back it up

[1:20:45] said he said shame they're making my
[1:20:49] they're making my uh Church a Tavern he
[1:20:51] said now look at his attitude towards
[1:20:54] dancing he said I was surely against

[1:20:59] church turned and looked at the pastor
[1:21:00] what are you going to do about it Pastor

[1:21:04] said he said you're turning my church
[1:21:07] into a Tavern we don't believe in such
[1:21:10] stuff as this but then he said the Holy
[1:21:12] Spirit told him where did that come from
[1:21:15] is that in the Bible that's a good
[1:21:17] question see you know the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:20] working on you when you ask you is that

[1:25:52] you see it through the scripture it's
[1:25:53] undeniable
[1:25:54] I preached eight sermons on this at our

[1:26:07] through battles but you know a few
[1:26:09] months later after preaching this you
[1:26:10] know it kind of died down the Holy Ghost

[1:26:53] mark all around our tiny little
[1:26:55] Sanctuary you know how small it
[1:26:56] is hallelujah that's the freedom that's
[1:27:00] what God wants if brother was here he
[1:27:02] asked you did you ever get that much
[1:27:03] Victory

[1:27:17] watching Remember church this is a
[1:27:20] scriptural command Praise Him in the
[1:27:22] dance amen
[1:27:25] and what did it take on that first dance
[1:27:27] it took a humble 85y old woman so none
[1:27:31] of us can say well I couldn't do it uh
[1:27:33] you know I couldn't be the first one to
[1:27:35] get in the
[1:27:37] spirit if a 85 year old woman could get
[1:27:40] in the spirit surely you can amen and
[1:27:43] she didn't even have the baptism of the
[1:27:45] Holy Ghost in the
[1:27:46] soul she just had an anointing on the
[1:27:49] spirit she doesn't even have what you

[1:29:12] thought I would dance over all around
[1:29:14] the churches I never thought that but
[1:29:16] God makes you do things you don't think
[1:29:18] you'll
[1:29:19] do to Humble you that's why he does it
[1:29:21] to give him glory and humble you
[1:29:26] [Music]
[1:29:28] I was never on a dance floor in all my
[1:29:30] life but I guess I did it all
[1:29:33] right how many wish they could have seen
[1:29:35] brother R dance do you know another time
[1:29:38] he told a story he got so under the
[1:29:40] anointing while preaching he sat on top
[1:29:42] of of the pulpit and swung his legs off
[1:29:45] the front preaching and then he said if
[1:29:47] this is okay he pulled up his his sleeve
[1:29:50] to about there he said he pulled it up
[1:29:51] for some reason look it up
[1:29:54] and he said why did I pull up my my my
[1:29:56] sleeve on my
[1:29:58] pants you think that's not very good
[1:30:00] church maners brother R said it was the
[1:30:01] Holy Ghost
[1:30:04] manners I was so lost in the spirit God
[1:30:08] will humble you that's what God's trying
[1:30:10] to do humble you of your pride
[1:30:12] Hallelujah you're so prideful and
[1:30:15] brother said stiff and starching I'm
[1:30:17] talking about me I'm talking about all
[1:30:18] of us praise God all of us message
[1:30:21] believers
[1:30:22] [Applause]
[1:30:24] amen you know we just want to obey the
[1:30:25] word we just want to be true uh we just
[1:30:27] want to be faithful we don't want to get
[1:30:29] deceived we don't want to be over
[1:30:30] emotional we don't want to be under
[1:30:31] emotional but here the Bible gives us
[1:30:34] there's anointings of Joy there's time
[1:30:36] to praise God that's what God wants
[1:30:45] hallelujah
[1:30:47] [Applause]
[1:30:49] hallelujah how many believe the message
[1:30:51] came to restore us the whole Bible well
[1:30:54] then why aren't people preaching about
[1:30:55] dancing that's that's in the Bible we've
[1:30:57] heard about the anointed ones the end
[1:30:59] time the godhead the water baptism all
[1:31:01] these Church ages Seven Seals All these
[1:31:03] great things what about dancing when is
[1:31:05] that going to be preached well right now
[1:31:07] is when it's going to be preached how
[1:31:09] many know God's timing is
[1:31:13] perfect so now we can see there's at
[1:31:15] least four or five reasons to dance I'm
[1:31:17] going to read them through you for the
[1:31:18] scriptures here the first is because you
[1:31:20] were baptized in the water baptism like
[1:31:23] Miriam was bapt AP ized in the Red
[1:31:26] Sea all your past is under the
[1:31:29] blood all the slavery of the past is
[1:31:32] under the blood you got a fresh start
[1:31:35] you're free in Jesus
[1:31:38] Christ
[1:31:41] Hallelujah the second is the one of the
[1:31:43] most well they're all awesome but 2
[1:31:46] Samuel 6:14 and David danced before the
[1:31:49] Lord with some of his might
[1:31:54] now I'm just starting to sweat brother
[1:31:56] Thomas I'm just starting to sweat but
[1:31:58] David danced with all I haven't give all
[1:32:02] my might I've given some of my might I
[1:32:05] can jump pretty high for
[1:32:07] Jesus David dancing with all and and now
[1:32:10] here I just did this at our home church
[1:32:12] too if I'm going to dance with all my
[1:32:13] might I got to jump with all I got so
[1:32:16] David danc he jumped his high as he
[1:32:18] could
[1:32:19] dance not not some of his might the
[1:32:22] Bible said all of his might
[1:32:25] did you ever get that much Victory where
[1:32:28] you dance with all of your mind
[1:32:31] Hallelujah that's what Jesus is supposed
[1:32:33] to make you do sometimes get so happy so
[1:32:37] much joy you just give him praise and
[1:32:39] you dance
[1:32:42] Hallelujah and I know this pastor would
[1:32:44] agree to you dancing Hallelujah he's a
[1:32:46] real Holy Ghost filled man
[1:32:48] Hallelujah that's right there's a time
[1:32:50] and season for everything
[1:32:52] amen now you won't see see me dancing I
[1:32:54] had my identity stolen a few months ago
[1:32:56] you didn't see me dancing during that
[1:32:57] boy I was stressed
[1:32:59] out you ever have uh thousands of
[1:33:02] thousands of dollars ever vanish right
[1:33:03] before your eyes I was watching it
[1:33:06] vanish vanish I'm like oh God have mercy
[1:33:08] on me now thank God I got it all back
[1:33:10] except a little bit I'm still working on
[1:33:11] that by God's grace you know AT&T had a
[1:33:14] data leak a data leak right well brother
[1:33:16] Jesse was one of those man my stomach
[1:33:19] was in knots for months you got to reset
[1:33:22] all your passwords you got to call
[1:33:24] everybody you gotta you might have to
[1:33:25] reset your social security number all
[1:33:27] these things now thank God it didn't go
[1:33:28] that far but church when I got out of
[1:33:30] that I found a reason I found a new
[1:33:33] season this is a season to dance and
[1:33:36] rejoice it's just like David and zlac
[1:33:38] David had all that taken away but he got
[1:33:41] it all back Hallelujah and I'm going to
[1:33:43] dance I got most of it back I believe
[1:33:45] the rest is coming hallelujah praise God
[1:33:49] Amen I lost thousands and thousands but
[1:33:52] God gave it back he keeps giving it back
[1:33:54] I've got a Reason To Praise Him
[1:33:57] Hallelujah and Satan thought it was
[1:33:58] going to do the opposite he thought he
[1:34:00] was going to cut off my praise not
[1:34:03] forever no no no not forever Church
[1:34:06] Hallelujah we'll go through difficult
[1:34:09] times we'll go through mourning we'll go
[1:34:11] through uh uh Temptations
[1:34:14] sorely but God will restore our dance
[1:34:17] how many believe
[1:34:20] that Glory verse 16 and as the Ark of
[1:34:24] the Lord came in the city of David
[1:34:25] Michael Saw's daughter looked through a
[1:34:27] window and saw King David leaping and
[1:34:29] dancing before the Lord and she despised
[1:34:31] him in her heart brother raham said that
[1:34:32] was that was him Michael was despising
[1:34:36] uh David brother Ram said I was like
[1:34:38] Michael despising those sisters dancing
[1:34:41] but see Church you don't have to remain
[1:34:42] that way that's the beauty of the story
[1:34:45] a man who used to condemn dancing became
[1:34:48] the
[1:34:50] dancer the ones that used to make fun of
[1:34:52] the speakers and tongues you might
[1:34:54] become a speaker in
[1:34:55] tongues the one who used to make fun of
[1:34:57] Divine Healing you might receive Divine
[1:35:00] Healing oh my Hallelujah God loves to do
[1:35:03] that God loves to take people off the
[1:35:05] enemy's side and bring them to his side
[1:35:08] hallelujah
[1:35:09] [Applause]
[1:35:12] amen Oh
[1:35:15] Glory so this is the second reason the
[1:35:18] first reason you might have been B you
[1:35:20] baptized and you appreciate all that God
[1:35:21] has done for you forgave all your sins
[1:35:24] the second reason is brother tells us
[1:35:26] why David danced anybody
[1:35:29] remember David rejoiced and dance in the
[1:35:32] spere around and around and around why
[1:35:35] now notice
[1:35:36] around around and one more around
[1:35:41] twirling that's the Hebrew definition
[1:35:43] Church David danced around and around
[1:35:46] why brother ROM says he saw the word
[1:35:49] back in its place
[1:35:53] does anybody remember when the word was
[1:35:55] in its place where was the word in its
[1:35:57] place on Mount Mariah and Mount Zion
[1:36:00] before David
[1:36:02] H I guess we have to dig in the
[1:36:03] scripture to find that Ah that's right
[1:36:06] we go back to Genesis
[1:36:07] 14 yeah Genesis 14 when the word mezc
[1:36:12] met Abraham there in Jerusalem king of
[1:36:16] Salem king of
[1:36:18] Jerusalem oh it was about 890 or 900
[1:36:23] years earlier the word was in its place
[1:36:27] Abraham met mzc right there in Jerusalem
[1:36:30] praise God and David recognizes it it's
[1:36:33] 900 years later and mzc is back but he's
[1:36:37] here in a different form he's here in
[1:36:39] the form of the Holy Ghost in the Ark of
[1:36:41] the Covenant carried on the shoulders
[1:36:44] near the the heart of the priest and
[1:36:46] David recognized the word is back Jesus
[1:36:49] Christ is back in his provided place of
[1:36:52] worship Hallelujah
[1:36:58] this was stunning to David remember even
[1:37:00] Joshua if you read Joshua 1563 even
[1:37:04] Joshua couldn't drive out the jebusites
[1:37:06] out of
[1:37:07] Jerusalem did you know
[1:37:09] that if you read it read in your Bible
[1:37:11] Joshua 1563 The jebusites couldn't drive
[1:37:15] I'm sorry the jebusites couldn't be
[1:37:16] driven out look Satan had taken a stake
[1:37:19] on that mountain that Holy Mountain why
[1:37:21] because that was God's Mountain
[1:37:24] great is the Lord and greatly to be
[1:37:25] praised the city of our God the mountain
[1:37:28] of his Holiness beautiful for situation
[1:37:30] the joy of the whole earth yeah is Mount
[1:37:34] Zion on the sides of the north the city
[1:37:37] of the great
[1:37:39] king
[1:37:41] Hallelujah so Satan refused to give that
[1:37:44] up through the jebusites Joshua tried
[1:37:47] they you know I'm sorry the people of
[1:37:48] Judah the Judah the Judah tribe couldn't
[1:37:50] drive them
[1:37:52] out think about that Joshua was a mighty
[1:37:55] conqueror but God saved it for David God
[1:37:58] saved uh the Holy Mountain being brought
[1:38:01] back by David because David was a type
[1:38:03] of Christ David was a prophet priest and
[1:38:08] king and the church said he was a
[1:38:10] prophet he wrote about God he prophesied
[1:38:12] of God he was a priest he put on the
[1:38:15] ephod he put on the ephod and he was
[1:38:18] dancing there before the Lord he was
[1:38:20] prophet priest and now he's anointed
[1:38:23] King it's a beautiful type of Jesus
[1:38:26] Christ is Prophet priest and King son of
[1:38:29] man Son of God Son of David
[1:38:33] hallelujah oh maybe that didn't strike
[1:38:36] you like it struck me so hope it was a
[1:38:37] blessing by God's
[1:38:39] grace so even 450 years after Joshua
[1:38:43] Jerusalem had never been taken until
[1:38:46] David took it remember they did it
[1:38:48] through the Waterway they did it through
[1:38:49] a secret passage underneath the city
[1:38:52] right and what what is it what is that
[1:38:53] that type all the secret things secret
[1:38:55] fasting secret prayers secret
[1:38:59] almsgiving how many know that gets a how
[1:39:01] many know that gets a reward from God
[1:39:02] when you fast pray and give alms in
[1:39:05] secret boy y'all really quiet on this
[1:39:08] one okay Hallelujah well that means
[1:39:10] you're thinking about it amen that's
[1:39:12] what my wife says she says I don't like
[1:39:14] when uh preachers say why aren't you say
[1:39:15] Amen she said I'm thinking about
[1:39:17] it I said well good that's what I want
[1:39:21] y'all to think about it amen
[1:39:24] so think about that am I praying in
[1:39:26] secret are you fasting in secret are you
[1:39:29] giving an alms in secret that's how the
[1:39:31] enemy's Camp is sacked
[1:39:37] Hallelujah that's how you defeat what
[1:39:39] seems to be like an
[1:39:42] insurmountable enemy it was
[1:39:45] insurmountable for 800 years Joshua
[1:39:48] couldn't get in there nobody could get
[1:39:49] in there but David got in there through
[1:39:51] the secret I think it was joab he
[1:39:53] crawled through that Waterway and they
[1:39:55] did a surprise attack and God and David
[1:39:57] made job uh the the leader of all the
[1:39:59] Mighty Men after that the leader of the
[1:40:02] arms forces because he went the secret
[1:40:04] Way Church Jesus said go in your closet
[1:40:06] and
[1:40:08] pray and brother Ram said that was part
[1:40:10] of the third poll brother R said what's
[1:40:12] that little tent mean and the angel said
[1:40:15] didn't our Lord say go pray in the
[1:40:17] closet and the church
[1:40:19] said how many want third pole power okay
[1:40:23] well now you know how to get it pray
[1:40:26] pray he said the angel is always
[1:40:29] scriptural that's what I love about this
[1:40:31] message amen the angel points us back to
[1:40:33] the Bible Hallelujah brother R's message
[1:40:36] points us back to the Bible
[1:40:39] Hallelujah Glory Glenn knows what I'm
[1:40:42] talking about
[1:40:43] amen hallelujah I was raised in church I
[1:40:47] I saw Miracles my mom was healed of
[1:40:49] cancer when I was 8 years old in in
[1:40:51] denominations Supernatural of cancer I'd
[1:40:55] seen Miracles our church had speaking in
[1:40:56] tongues but I never seen anything like
[1:40:58] the message because it was the word of
[1:41:00] God it's the word restored plus the
[1:41:06] supernatural it's the revelation of the
[1:41:08] word plus it's a supernatural word of
[1:41:12] God didn't brother B say Mark 11 always
[1:41:15] struggle always stumbled me if you say
[1:41:18] to this
[1:41:19] mountain it'll be cast in the sea if you
[1:41:22] don't doubt in your heart
[1:41:24] brother said that was always a puzzling
[1:41:25] scripture to
[1:41:26] me but then the Lord said how many
[1:41:29] squirrels do you
[1:41:30] want is that
[1:41:32] right and brother said I didn't ask to
[1:41:35] speak squirrels God told me to speak
[1:41:38] them that's how you know God using you
[1:41:41] in the third pole God will tell you to
[1:41:43] speak
[1:41:45] something I've seen it probably four
[1:41:47] five times in my
[1:41:49] Ministry one time I had a cooworker
[1:41:51] she's no longer at our school her name
[1:41:52] was Nikki we did Bible she was Barren
[1:41:54] her and her husband couldn't have
[1:41:55] children they're not in the message
[1:41:57] they're
[1:41:58] Catholics but she asked me would you
[1:42:00] help me we want to have a child they're
[1:42:01] doing all these procedures nothing
[1:42:03] worked I had a Bible study one morning
[1:42:05] Saturday morning I was praying I was
[1:42:06] looking out at this the the window just
[1:42:08] like that and something came on me
[1:42:10] brother uh and I said in the name of
[1:42:13] Jesus Christ I speak to that mountain of
[1:42:15] infertility and I command to move in the
[1:42:18] name of Jesus Christ I was crying I went
[1:42:22] upstairs I told told my wife I said
[1:42:23] honey I think I might have just
[1:42:25] prophesied I I'm afraid to tell anybody
[1:42:27] else cuz that's never happened to me
[1:42:28] before a couple days later I'm out
[1:42:30] pushing my children on the swings you
[1:42:32] know probably Caris back there I got a
[1:42:34] text from her and she sent a picture of
[1:42:36] her and her husband with a positive
[1:42:38] pregnancy test were finally
[1:42:41] pregnant nine months later the baby was
[1:42:45] born because if you say well I can't say
[1:42:49] I don't have any power of my own but
[1:42:50] when God gives us what to say then we
[1:42:52] can speak the word and that is thus
[1:42:55] sayith the Lord that will come to pass
[1:42:58] amen
[1:43:00] hallelujah praise
[1:43:02] God then in 2020 one of my our brothers
[1:43:05] in the church van he's a founding member
[1:43:07] his dad had a stroke and died but they

[1:43:25] three scriptures on my mind the last one

[1:43:42] has a stroke and as soon as he said that
[1:43:46] that scripture came to my mind there's

[1:43:49] tongue I said brother hold on let me go

[1:50:15] what we need brother that's what that's
[1:50:16] the kind of church we need Church where
[1:50:19] people lose their pride and they just do
[1:50:21] what the Holy Spirit spirit says do and
[1:50:24] I'm not saying dance every service I'm
[1:50:26] just saying dance once in a while praise
[1:50:28] God whenever God leads you to do

[1:50:44] pride I don't care what anybody says I'm
[1:50:47] doing what God tells me to
[1:50:50] do I'm not a servant of man Paul said if
[1:50:53] I was a servant of man I couldn't be a
[1:50:54] servant of
[1:50:56] Christ you and I are here to serve Jesus
[1:51:00] Christ so let's lose all of our pride
[1:51:05] amen it takes it takes you in other
[1:51:07] words it takes humility to dance for the
[1:51:10] Lord it takes humility to shout and
[1:51:13] praise

[1:51:20] afford it I can do it I can do this I
[1:51:22] can do that we can do that I can do it

[1:51:25] it's it's being humble it's being led by
[1:51:27] the Holy Spirit praise God I can't do
[1:51:30] nothing without
[1:51:32] Jesus brother B said I'm a failure
[1:51:35] without him amen he said I'm always a
[1:51:37] failure and he says I'm not saying that
[1:51:39] to be humble praise God he said I'm a
[1:51:42] sinner saved by grace not fit to live he
[1:51:44] said that the seven
[1:51:46] seal
[1:51:48] Hallelujah he said put all this grace on
[1:51:51] Jesus Christ
[1:51:54] how many believe God used brother
[1:51:55] brandom okay now put that Glory put that
[1:51:58] Grace on Jesus Christ that's what
[1:52:01] brother Braham
[1:52:03] said
[1:52:05] Glory brother Braham said Mary when she
[1:52:07] danced on the day of Pentecost brother
[1:52:09] manam said this he said she had to wait
[1:52:11] up there till she lost all of her
[1:52:12] dignity and
[1:52:15] pride so if you want the Holy Ghost you
[1:52:17] have to be free from pride and dignity
[1:52:21] well I'm just going to be the most
[1:52:22] staunch person here I'm going to be the
[1:52:24] most controlled PE person here I've got
[1:52:27] everything under under control I'm
[1:52:30] making sure everybody's in order but are
[1:52:31] you making sure you're doing what the
[1:52:32] Holy Ghost tells you to do that's really
[1:52:35] what
[1:52:36] matters Hallelujah and brother and said
[1:52:39] if you want to be like David if you want
[1:52:40] to be like these men of God in the Bible
[1:52:42] lose all your pride and dignity praise
[1:52:44] God I think that's why God's made me so
[1:52:47] reject in the message because I just
[1:52:48] done lost all my pride it forced me to
[1:52:50] lose all my pride and dignity I don't
[1:52:52] care about a small church I don't care
[1:52:53] if I'm a a church of with a a small
[1:52:55] church with a pastor it doesn't matter
[1:52:57] I'm a servant of Jesus
[1:52:59] Christ this is not about money
[1:53:01] popularity or women this is about the
[1:53:04] kingdom of
[1:53:07] God this is about getting Souls saved
[1:53:10] this is about getting the bride filled
[1:53:12] with the Holy Ghost the bride has made
[1:53:15] herself ready hallelujah
[1:53:18] amen and if God can use me in a humble
[1:53:20] little way then I want to be used in
[1:53:22] that come a little
[1:53:25] away Hallelujah I love this quote I got
[1:53:28] this from some
[1:53:30] uh some Bible commentator guy I forget
[1:53:34] his name it might have been Matthew
[1:53:35] Henry I love I love those guys you know
[1:53:37] they had some do false doctrines but
[1:53:38] they were good guys but man said they
[1:53:40] they preached and wrote like nobody ever
[1:53:41] did in the history of the world he said
[1:53:42] that in the church age book they were so
[1:53:44] anointed on that man age but Matthew
[1:53:46] Henry said the problem with maau now
[1:53:48] this is this is something that we may
[1:53:50] feel sometimes right some of us are not
[1:53:51] maau but we might act like it for a
[1:53:53] little bit like well I'm too good to
[1:53:54] dance well I I'm too good to speak in
[1:53:58] tongues brother uh Matthew Henry said
[1:54:00] Mall's problem was that she was looking
[1:54:03] at
[1:54:04] David she should not have been looking
[1:54:06] at David she should have been looking at
[1:54:08] the
[1:54:09] ark that's what always gets us in
[1:54:11] trouble we look at the man preaching we
[1:54:15] look at the sister singing we look at
[1:54:17] all these other things instead of
[1:54:19] looking at we what we should look at we
[1:54:21] should look at Jesus Jesus cuz when you
[1:54:24] see Jesus you see a savior you see a man
[1:54:27] who died who Rose and and and he gives
[1:54:30] you power he gives you power on high to
[1:54:32] be a witness unto Elton to Kentucky to
[1:54:36] akan Ohio to the ends of the world
[1:54:39] Hallelujah that's what he does
[1:54:44] Amen so let's look at the word don't
[1:54:46] look at brother Jesse jumping as high as
[1:54:47] he can I'm 43 I can't jump that high
[1:54:50] much
[1:54:51] longer I'm getting older by God's
[1:54:55] grace don't look at a man look at the
[1:54:58] word of God
[1:55:01] hallelujah now if you got your Bibles go
[1:55:02] to Jeremiah
[1:55:04] 31 here's where this can help you
[1:55:08] Church did you ever get that much
[1:55:10] Victory brother Bram
[1:55:12] said Jeremiah 31 and this ties in
[1:55:16] perfectly the last night doesn't it you
[1:55:18] get victory over sin that separates you
[1:55:21] from God's presence right
[1:55:25] and when you have victory over sin now
[1:55:27] the death is out of your life and what's
[1:55:29] left if death is gone what's there life
[1:55:31] I mean there's only one only two options
[1:55:34] there
[1:55:37] Hallelujah Jeremiah
[1:55:43] 31 now I'm going to skip down here look
[1:55:46] at verse three the Lord hath appeared of
[1:55:47] old unto me saying yay I have loved thee
[1:55:49] with what church what kind of love did
[1:55:50] God love you with ever
[1:55:53] somebody ought to say Amen on
[1:55:55] that if God loved Israel with an
[1:55:57] everlasting love what about
[1:56:00] you under the blood of Jesus
[1:56:04] Christ therefore with loving kindness
[1:56:06] have I drawn thee how did God get you to
[1:56:08] the message it was his love that Drew

[1:56:13] love you God bless you
[1:56:15] Sister God's love Drew you into the
[1:56:19] message yes it that's what it was for me
[1:56:21] I was happy in my denomination but I
[1:56:23] always looking for something deeper I
[1:56:24] was going to this preacher and then John
[1:56:26] Piper I was trying to get a little bit
[1:56:27] deeper and then Simon brought the
[1:56:29] message I like this is it this is what
[1:56:31] I've been thirsting for all these years
[1:56:33] it's the word it's the revelation of
[1:56:36] Jesus Christ

[1:57:12] your hands but how many of you have ever

[1:57:27] I'm sure our pastor would take that
[1:57:28] dance oh that's the only dance you could
[1:57:30] do or maybe it's just all I can do is
[1:57:31] turn around but for some reason the
[1:57:33] trials of life and the tests and the
[1:57:35] cares of the world you lost your dance
[1:57:38] but God said I will visit you and make
[1:57:41] you dance

[2:06:18] Lord did you know one time brother
[2:06:21] brandom uh sister Dolores she was the
[2:06:23] youngest of 10 I think
[2:06:26] uh she said she was in a meeting in 1959
[2:06:29] I want you listen
[2:06:32] this she said the holy brother man said
[2:06:34] the Holy Ghost fell in the building last
[2:06:36] night and look what Satan was telling
[2:06:39] Dolores Dolores came up to brother
[2:06:40] Brandon her older brother right so first
[2:06:42] and last first and last youngest and
[2:06:43] oldest interesting Alpha and Omega
[2:06:46] interesting I just caught that I don't
[2:06:48] know if there's anything to it
[2:06:50] but and dores said brother BR the devil
[2:06:53] had come in around the people saying
[2:06:55] don't listen set still so this is what
[2:06:58] the devil does when your pastor's
[2:06:59] preaching this is what the devil does
[2:07:01] when I'm preaching the devil will say
[2:07:03] don't listen sit still
[2:07:07] what stop listening so let your mind
[2:07:10] look at the preacher but out there
[2:07:11] you're doing some maybe you're cleaning
[2:07:12] at home or maybe you're looking for the
[2:07:13] deals in
[2:07:15] Walmart maybe looking for that next
[2:07:17] truck to buy with 4x4 I don't
[2:07:20] know I'm not outo door guy I don't know
[2:07:23] for me it might be I'm looking at a new
[2:07:24] a a new iPad or a new something like
[2:07:26] that to do better
[2:07:27] teaching but see Satan says don't uh uh
[2:07:31] Satan says don't move and don't listen
[2:07:33] to him That's what Satan comes to do in
[2:07:36] our services don't listen and don't move
[2:07:40] listen Church you shouldn't be sore from
[2:07:41] sitting after church you should stand up
[2:07:44] and praise God sometimes you should just
[2:07:46] stand up and say Glory I believe it and
[2:07:50] then just sit back down
[2:07:52] or just you know stand up and say
[2:07:53] hallelujah that's right brother keep
[2:07:55] preaching that's
[2:07:58] true but Satan says don't listen and sit
[2:08:03] still my sister said bill I was so happy
[2:08:07] anybody happy this
[2:08:08] morning I'm so happy while you were
[2:08:11] preaching I felt like I could raise up
[2:08:13] and jump through a wall now this is what
[2:08:15] Dolores said I felt like I could raise
[2:08:17] up and just jump right through the wall
[2:08:19] anybody ever felt like that I felt like
[2:08:21] that
[2:08:24] before and look what look look what she
[2:08:26] says brother bam said well I said raise
[2:08:29] up and jump that's
[2:08:31] all but then she said but when but when
[2:08:35] uh she said then the people began
[2:08:37] shouting so the people started shouting
[2:08:39] before she jumped up she wanted to be
[2:08:41] the first one to jump up and
[2:08:43] shout right and there's nothing wrong
[2:08:45] with that uh there's nothing wrong with
[2:08:46] one to be the first one to move in the
[2:08:48] spirit yeah that's what Miriam did yeah
[2:08:51] there's nothing wrong with wan to be the
[2:08:53] first one who stands up and pray there's
[2:08:54] nothing wrong with that but Dolores got
[2:08:56] discouraged because she wasn't the first
[2:08:59] one and she said Bill the people began
[2:09:02] shouting and that I just felt like I was
[2:09:04] an old
[2:09:06] nothing so she wanted to raise up and
[2:09:08] run through the wall she wanted to raise
[2:09:09] up and jump but other people started
[2:09:11] shouting first and I said I felt like I
[2:09:13] was nothing let's see what brother bam
[2:09:15] tells her to
[2:09:17] do I said that's the devil yeah
[2:09:22] the devil will say your worship doesn't
[2:09:24] mean nothing so tell the devil shut up
[2:09:28] devil like what do they say boo devil I
[2:09:30] don't really say that too much but is
[2:09:31] that what people say boo devil shut up

[2:09:44] God's children praise
[2:09:46] God but said that's the devil that's
[2:09:50] Satan
[2:09:51] now look at brother braham's advice I
[2:09:53] love this look at what a prophet advises
[2:09:55] his sister when she wants to do
[2:09:57] something he says when he comes to do
[2:09:59] that I said then you should have raised
[2:10:02] up
[2:10:06] anyhow if you feel so happy in service
[2:10:10] and Satan's trying to tell you to stop
[2:10:11] you should just do what the Holy Ghost
[2:10:14] is telling you to
[2:10:16] do Satan wants you to sit still and do
[2:10:19] nothing and say nothing God God Made You
[2:10:21] To Worship
[2:10:23] Hallelujah Glory if somebody else stands
[2:10:26] up that's okay you stand up
[2:10:30] too you didn't come here to be a bump on
[2:10:32] a pickle you came here to be part of the
[2:10:35] body of Jesus
[2:10:37] Christ
[2:10:38] yeah that's right praise
[2:10:43] God you're here to worship
[2:10:47] God tell Satan
[2:10:49] no Satan get be behind me the name of
[2:10:52] Jesus
[2:10:55] Christ that's a prophet's advice to his
[2:10:58] own
[2:10:59] sister when you feel happy follow the
[2:11:02] leading of the Holy Ghost
[2:11:05] Hallelujah I'm trying to close here let
[2:11:07] me try to close now usually that means
[2:11:09] 15 or 30 minutes we'll
[2:11:11] see that's what my wife tells me back
[2:11:14] home you know Lamentations chapter 5
[2:11:17] says when you sin it stops your dance
[2:11:21] like we saw last night when you let
[2:11:23] something die in your life if you don't
[2:11:24] clean it up it'll stop all your worship
[2:11:26] you won't feel God's presence you won't
[2:11:28] go into God's presence anymore you want
[2:11:30] to have fellowship with
[2:11:32] God that's right sometimes brother like
[2:11:34] I said last night sometimes people will
[2:11:37] sit there and they'll chew their nails
[2:11:38] through the whole service I'm like how
[2:11:39] do they have any nails
[2:11:41] left instead of chewing that they should
[2:11:43] actually lift that up and say praise
[2:11:48] God right I thinking m it's already been
[2:11:51] an hour when they start chewing their
[2:11:53] toenails they're probably done with
[2:11:54] their
[2:11:56] hands now please don't take off your
[2:12:01] socks you see how people they they're
[2:12:04] not even thinking they're not I know
[2:12:06] it's it's funny it's reality I'm like
[2:12:09] how can these people be moved by the
[2:12:10] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is telling
[2:12:12] you to trim your nails during church I'm
[2:12:14] not trying to be a legalist but you
[2:12:16] understand the point yeah right what are
[2:12:18] we doing in church brother used to be
[2:12:21] heing for the Holy Spirit to raise up to
[2:12:24] praise God this Bible should make us so
[2:12:27] happy we should praise God
[2:12:32] Hallelujah at the least take notes or
[2:12:36] something save your toenail or finger
[2:12:38] trimming for
[2:12:39] home right that's good one time brother
[2:12:42] Brook said I was chewing my nails he's
[2:12:44] like that looks pretty good can I have a
[2:12:45] bite of that you he was just trying of
[2:12:46] being funny he so sometimes I'll say
[2:12:48] that in church well that looks pretty
[2:12:49] good can I have a bite taste of that
[2:12:50] there service can I take a taste of
[2:12:53] that no I'm just joking but you
[2:12:55] understand I mean we should be so in
[2:12:58] love with God that these little things
[2:13:00] should just pass
[2:13:01] away I'm here to Worship the Lord I'm
[2:13:04] glad some you get a good chuckle out of
[2:13:05] that that made me chuckle too
[2:13:08] Lamentations chapter 5 look at verse 15
[2:13:12] the joy of our heart is ceased our dance
[2:13:14] has turned into the
[2:13:16] mour and this is because the
[2:13:17] Lamentations because the Kings and all
[2:13:19] the people had let down on God's word
[2:13:21] and all the idols came into the city so
[2:13:24] there's no joy in Jerusalem it's the
[2:13:25] city of Joy this supposed to be the
[2:13:27] House of
[2:13:29] Joy but sin had caused no dancing and no
[2:13:33] real worship and
[2:13:36] singing that's what sin does sin takes
[2:13:38] away your praise sin takes away your
[2:13:41] dance how many believe though God can
[2:13:42] bring it back he's the master of
[2:13:45] bringing things back
[2:13:47] Hallelujah he's the master of turning a
[2:13:49] new page start a new chapter of your
[2:13:52] life amen he's the master of restoring
[2:13:56] all the years the Palmer worm the
[2:13:58] caterpillar the Locust Hallelujah all
[2:14:00] the years God's the master of I will
[2:14:03] restore sayi the Lord
[2:14:06] [Applause]
[2:14:07] hallelujah Oh Glory
[2:14:13] Hallelujah
[2:14:16] now just so you know the the Bible says
[2:14:19] clapping is a is a sign clapping and
[2:14:21] shoutings are songs of are signs of
[2:14:23] Triumph when you're clapping and
[2:14:25] praising God shouting that's a sign
[2:14:27] you've got the
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:32] victory Psalms 47
[2:14:36] verse1 a psalm for the sons of Kora clap
[2:14:39] ye Hands All Ye people shout unto God
[2:14:42] with the voice of
[2:14:44] Triumph see instead of chewing on those
[2:14:47] start clapping with
[2:14:49] those Hallelujah
[2:14:54] it's
[2:14:55] plain God Specializes in turning your
[2:14:58] mour into
[2:15:02] dancing go to Isaiah 61 the spirit of
[2:15:05] the Lord is upon me because he anointed
[2:15:07] me to preach the Good Tidings of the
[2:15:08] meek now go to the verse three to
[2:15:10] appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to
[2:15:13] give them Beauty for
[2:15:15] Ashes the oil of joy for Mourning
[2:15:21] the Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[2:15:24] heaviness you know what heaviness is
[2:15:26] depression you ever looked that
[2:15:28] up Church we've all been depressed
[2:15:30] sometimes I don't have to ask you to
[2:15:31] raise your hand we've all been depressed
[2:15:34] you know the greatest depression ever
[2:15:35] was in the Bible was the Govern gemy how
[2:15:37] do we know because he there was so much
[2:15:39] depression blood was coming out none of
[2:15:41] us have ever had depression like
[2:15:44] that and yet he went through that the
[2:15:47] Bible brother said that was him
[2:15:48] overcoming that's when he overcame in
[2:15:51] prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane he
[2:15:53] prayed until he overcame
[2:15:57] depression and the Bible said Jesus
[2:15:59] Christ will take your mourning and turn
[2:16:02] it into
[2:16:03] dancing he will take that depression
[2:16:06] from you brother man says if you just
[2:16:07] hate it you have to hate your sin expose
[2:16:10] the devil and not love it
[2:16:12] anymore remember brother said he
[2:16:14] couldn't cast that devil out because a
[2:16:15] man loved that he worshiped that Spirit
[2:16:18] up there in Windsor was clinging onto
[2:16:19] his feet remember he said he's not free
[2:16:22] because he loves that Spirit that's why
[2:16:24] we got to hate our
[2:16:27] sins you start loving sin you are in a
[2:16:29] you're in a bad
[2:16:31] spot but Jesus can turn the page
[2:16:34] Hallelujah Jesus can bring you to a new
[2:16:36] chapter praise God and I hope somebody
[2:16:39] or many people here get a new chapter
[2:16:41] starting today
[2:16:43] Hallelujah God will give you the spirit
[2:16:45] of
[2:16:46] Joy Hallelujah instead of the spirit of
[2:16:49] heaviness he'll give you a garment of
[2:16:51] praise amen put on your preaching
[2:16:53] clothes put on your church
[2:16:55] clothes put on your glory clothes amen
[2:16:59] the Bible says you got to put it on like
[2:17:01] clothes you all got up this morning look
[2:17:02] really nice that's what the Bible said
[2:17:04] spiritually put on your
[2:17:06] praise I got to put on my dancing shoes
[2:17:09] this morning is that
[2:17:10] right I can dance for the Lord I can
[2:17:13] give God praise I the Bible says you got
[2:17:15] to put on the Garment of Praise
[2:17:18] Hallelujah that's the anointing brother
[2:17:20] brother said the spirit of
[2:17:24] joy and friends let me tell you this
[2:17:26] this is what helped me out a
[2:17:29] lot when I was battling this years ago I
[2:17:31] realized this Satan's going to try to
[2:17:34] condemn you either way whether you dance
[2:17:37] or whether you
[2:17:39] don't right how many ever dance here
[2:17:41] before the Lord anybody ever spoke in
[2:17:43] tongues I've never but I've asked God
[2:17:45] I'm still waiting on God if he'll let me
[2:17:47] speak in tongues it's just a small thing
[2:17:48] it edifies you right
[2:17:52] but here the Bible says you know either
[2:17:54] way whether you know before I dance
[2:17:56] Satan says see you never dance you're
[2:17:58] too you're too
[2:17:59] ashamed well then after our dance Satan
[2:18:01] said well you just dance for yourself
[2:18:03] either way he's going to try to condemn
[2:18:04] me so how do I win that argument brother
[2:18:07] take him back to the
[2:18:08] word take Satan back to the word just
[2:18:12] like Jesus brother said Jesus could
[2:18:14] defeat Satan any time any place anywhere
[2:18:17] with thus sayith the Lord it is written
[2:18:21] Hallelujah it is written yes
[2:18:25] hallelujah it's written I'm to praise
[2:18:27] him with the dance it's written I'm to
[2:18:30] clap my hands it's written I'm to shout
[2:18:33] songs of praise
[2:18:36] Hallelujah that's the only way you
[2:18:38] defeat the Devil
[2:18:40] anyway is by the word of God and my
[2:18:43] Bible says there's no condemnation to
[2:18:47] them that are in Jesus Christ
[2:18:51] Romans
[2:18:52] 81 Satan says oh you're condemned you're
[2:18:55] selfish you're just doing this for
[2:18:56] yourself you're just doing this uh so
[2:18:59] people can see you say shut up devil I
[2:19:01] there's no condemnation for
[2:19:04] me you can't condemn
[2:19:07] me if you haven't read Romans 8 in a
[2:19:09] while go read
[2:19:11] that that will make you feel like a Sky
[2:19:13] High Christian you'll be walking on the
[2:19:14] clouds after that there's no
[2:19:17] condemnation for me all things work
[2:19:20] together for good to them that love the
[2:19:21] Lord
[2:19:23] hallelujah who can lay any charge to
[2:19:27] God's elect
[2:19:28] Hallelujah it is God that justified you
[2:19:32] sister hallelujah it's God who justifies
[2:19:36] you Satan cannot lay any charge to your
[2:19:39] account because Jesus already dropped
[2:19:42] the charges
[2:19:44] hallelujah oh yes take Satan right back
[2:19:49] to the word of God
[2:19:51] God it is written
[2:19:56] Satan
[2:19:58] Hallelujah and then he ends the chapter
[2:20:01] with there's nothing that can separate
[2:20:04] me there's nothing that can separate you
[2:20:07] from the love of
[2:20:10] God
[2:20:11] oh no PO no principalities no demons no
[2:20:16] temptation even
[2:20:19] death nothing can separate you from the
[2:20:22] love of God which is in Christ
[2:20:28] Jesus so what can Satan tell me
[2:20:32] now what can he tell you now he can't
[2:20:35] tell you nothing you're walking in
[2:20:37] Victory I like how you're stand up
[2:20:38] brother that's
[2:20:39] good don't sit still say you know Satan
[2:20:41] says sit still and God says don't sit
[2:20:43] still amen give God some
[2:20:47] praise and if you get depressed brother
[2:20:49] R said every time time I get a little
[2:20:51] blue I go to Romans chapter 4 where it
[2:20:54] said Abraham staggered not at the
[2:20:57] promise of God but was strong in faith
[2:21:00] giving God the
[2:21:02] glory huh brother Brandon got depressed
[2:21:05] yes and he went to Romans chapter 4
[2:21:09] Abraham called those things not as
[2:21:11] though they
[2:21:12] were
[2:21:14] Hallelujah Abraham didn't stagger he was
[2:21:17] strong in faith giving God glory we need
[2:21:20] some strong people in faith this morning
[2:21:22] that will give God some Glory
[2:21:29] Hallelujah I'm about worn out
[2:21:33] here either way he's going to condemn
[2:21:35] you so you might as well obey the word
[2:21:38] of
[2:21:39] God and just tell Satan a little bit of
[2:21:41] this it's written I'm supposed to praise
[2:21:44] him I was born to praise
[2:21:48] him I was born to
[2:21:51] dance why cuz he danced
[2:21:54] first Hallelujah because he danced first
[2:21:57] because he lives I shall live also
[2:21:59] because he dance I shall dance
[2:22:01] also Oh Glory
[2:22:05] Hallelujah let me close with this go to
[2:22:07] Psalms 148 I am going to try to close I
[2:22:10] can't preach my whole eight sermons in
[2:22:11] one sermon
[2:22:14] here I love you so much though I just
[2:22:16] want to give you as much as I can to
[2:22:17] strengthen local church to strengthen
[2:22:19] the pastor and the associate I just want
[2:22:21] to strengthen the people of God the best
[2:22:22] I
[2:22:30] can Psalm
