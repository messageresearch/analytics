[24:44] good morning brothers and
[24:46] sisters if we'll just all stand this
[24:51] morning just bow our heads before the
[24:54] Lord and maybe brother Joe will open us
[24:55] in prayer this morning
[25:26] ch
[25:29] are
[25:59] said
[26:28] we
[26:58] you
[27:54] BL
[27:58] amen the children can be dis dismissed
[28:00] for Sunday school so good to be in the
[28:03] house of the Lord this morning if we'll
[28:05] go in the Psalms Psalms
[28:09] 130 just a few verses
[28:12] here Psalms
[28:20] 130 out of the depths have I Cried unto
[28:24] thee Oh Lord
[28:31] if thou Lord should us Mark iniquities
[28:34] oh Lord who shall
[28:40] stand I wait for the Lord my soul doth
[28:43] wait and in his word do I
[28:54] hope let Israel hope in the Lord for
[28:57] with the Lord there is Mercy and with
[28:59] him is plenteous
[29:01] redemption and he shall redeem Israel
[29:04] from all his iniquities God bless you
[29:06] may be
[29:07] seated brother
[29:24] Brian Lord bless you all
[29:31] I was that U forgive me here that one
[29:35] verse I'm used to hold in a mic that one
[29:37] verse where it said we were reading in
[29:41] 130 if the Lord should Mark my iniquity
[29:44] the Lord who shall stand and that's a
[29:45] pretty pretty awesome statement there
[29:48] you know it's if we actually realize who
[29:51] we really are if it wasn't for the grace
[29:53] of Jesus Christ this morning we'd be in
[29:56] trouble this morning and the scripture
[29:57] like that that tells you that your only
[29:59] hope is to cllean closer to Jesus Christ
[30:02] this morning that your iniquities would
[30:04] be forgiven if you would turn with me uh
[30:07] back to uh the 15th
[30:10] Psalm I was reading that this morning
[30:14] doing the while I'm well ahead in the
[30:16] daily
[30:17] devotional but
[30:19] um I'll give you a chance to get there I
[30:21] know I once I start I don't stop but uh
[30:25] if you'll turn to the 15th Psalm this
[30:27] morning
[30:31] I never give you all a chance to get
[30:33] there and it's a short one too and it
[30:37] says Lord who shall abide in thy
[30:39] Tabernacle and who shall dwell in thy
[30:42] Holy
[30:43] Hill and then I of course as all good
[30:46] Christians as you are you're saying me
[30:48] in my heart I will because God has
[30:50] touched me and he that walketh uprightly
[30:53] and walketh righteousness worketh right
[30:56] righteousness and speaketh the truth in
[30:58] his heart so you're not deceived in your
[31:00] own Spirit you know who you are you know
[31:03] what you are and you know what you need
[31:05] need to do daily to be there on that day
[31:08] and he goes on to say here he that
[31:11] backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth
[31:14] evil to his neighbor nor taketh up
[31:17] reproach against his neighbor he lives
[31:20] those Christian virtues basically when I
[31:23] read a passage like that I think of
[31:26] those Christian virtues you you live you
[31:28] live those Christian virtues again I I
[31:32] would say that but without the Holy
[31:34] Ghost and without the presence of Jesus
[31:36] Christ can you live those virtues
[31:38] probably not but once you have that
[31:40] presence in your heart and life you're
[31:42] more than able to re live those virtues
[31:45] do you not fall sometimes yes of course
[31:47] you're going to fall but you get right
[31:49] back up again and you keep walking
[31:51] forward you know that's the difference
[31:52] between a good fighter and a bad fighter
[31:55] is a good fighter will always get back
[31:57] up again and get back in the fight a
[31:58] weak man would just stay there and lay
[32:01] out and the worst thing about a weak man
[32:03] he's the guy that hides behind the tree
[32:05] and he's the guy that hides behind the
[32:07] cover when everyone else is engaging
[32:09] forward and we aren't those kind of
[32:11] Christians here this morning you're
[32:12] going to be in the thick of the battle
[32:14] fighting against the enemy of yourself
[32:17] and the enemy of your brothers and
[32:18] sisters and he goes on to say here in in
[32:22] whose eyes in whose eyes a vile person
[32:26] is condemned but he honth therein fearth
[32:30] the Lord Heath sarth to his own hurt and
[32:33] CH and changeth not now when I read that
[32:36] that's what I was reading this morning
[32:38] what it has to say about when a man or a
[32:40] woman gives a vow this is what he said
[32:43] here he that sth to his own hurt so if
[32:45] you make a promise to the Lord or you
[32:48] make a promise to your
[32:50] family you make a promise to your
[32:52] brothers and sisters you will do
[32:54] whatever you promised even though you
[32:56] know it'll hurt your yourself might hurt
[32:59] you financially might hurt you
[33:01] physically when you give a vowel when
[33:03] you say you're going to do something
[33:05] you'll do it no matter what it costs you
[33:07] you're going to do it and it's you can
[33:09] take it back into salvation again
[33:11] whatever it cost you you're going to
[33:13] cast it all the s side so you can
[33:15] embrace the cross and Jesus Christ this
[33:17] morning and and the last verse it says
[33:21] who putteth not his money to user nor
[33:23] taketh reward against the
[33:25] innocent he that doeth these things
[33:28] shall never be moved and it re really
[33:31] was striking this morning I'm going
[33:33] to if you would turn with me uh to if I
[33:38] didn't lose my place this morning to
[33:40] Galatians the 5th chapter when when I
[33:43] read a scripture like that or when I
[33:46] read the Psalms that brother Choy read I
[33:49] go to in my mind in the Bible I go to
[33:52] places
[33:53] that that second that opinion or second
[33:57] those
[33:58] thoughts that reinforce those thoughts
[34:01] this morning and I am totally off what I
[34:03] was going to say this morning but
[34:07] um Paul had to say this uh this is where
[34:12] the negative is and the positive is I'm
[34:14] I'm going to read the positive I won't
[34:16] we all know what the negative is but
[34:18] this is what Paul had to say and it and
[34:20] it has to do with our lives and I'll
[34:22] start at
[34:24] about uh about the U sixth verse for if
[34:28] Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[34:30] prevaileth anything or
[34:32] uncircumcision but Faith which worketh
[34:34] by love so everything we do by faith is
[34:37] in love this morning and it goes on you
[34:40] did run well who did hinder you that you
[34:43] should not obey the truth so Paul you
[34:45] know I I say this a lot Paul's Ching
[34:48] talking to a church that is already
[34:50] starting to fall already people are
[34:53] contending with each other church is
[34:56] already starting to contend even in this
[34:58] day and he goes on the truth this
[35:00] persuasion cometh not of him that
[35:02] calleth you it doesn't come from Jesus
[35:04] Christ it comes from man's Wisdom and
[35:07] man's ways um little 11 uh a little 11th
[35:12] the whole lump I have confidence you
[35:15] through the Lord that you will be none
[35:17] otherwise minded that he that troubles
[35:19] you shall bear his judgment whoever
[35:22] whoever so he be and I Brethren if I yet
[35:26] preach C circum decision you do I yet
[35:30] Surfer persecution then is the offense
[35:32] cross ceased I would not even cut off
[35:35] trouble you for Brethren you have been
[35:37] called on to Liberty only not use your
[35:40] Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but
[35:42] to love and serve one another and not
[35:44] thinking of circumcision here just
[35:46] thinking of all the things the world is
[35:48] trying to put on you and force you to do
[35:52] that have nothing to do with walking a
[35:54] Christian Life this morning and
[35:56] basically Paul's saying anything any man
[35:58] any organization anything that's trying
[36:01] to take you away from the cross and from
[36:03] the true word of God you just got to
[36:06] cast it all away this morning and I lost
[36:09] my place there I would then even cut off
[36:12] when you Trav for bre and you have been
[36:14] called onto Liberty only use not that
[36:16] Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but
[36:20] love and serve one another for all the
[36:22] law is fulfilled in one word even this
[36:25] Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor as thyself
[36:29] and I I'm G to and it says if you bite
[36:31] and devour one another take heed least
[36:34] you be consumed one another and that's
[36:36] what goes out there in the world it
[36:38] shouldn't be among the Church of Jesus
[36:40] Christ but out there in the world that's
[36:41] what's going on right now but I'm going
[36:43] to jump past the bad part and finish at
[36:46] the started at about the 22nd verse this
[36:49] morning but this is the fruit of the
[36:51] spirit this is what should be in my life
[36:53] should be in our lives this morning not
[36:55] the bad stuff it should be the good
[36:57] stuff this morning but the fruit of the
[37:00] spirit is love joy peace
[37:03] longsuffering gentleness and gentleness
[37:06] is something I I got to raise my hand as
[37:09] I get older Janette tells me all the
[37:11] time she sees a little bit of my father
[37:13] in me and I try to keep that
[37:15] away uh gentleness goodness Faith
[37:18] meekness Temperance against such there
[37:21] is no law as long as God abides in your
[37:24] heart and life this morning in the
[37:25] spirit of Christ these things will will
[37:27] manifest thems from you and if you don't
[37:30] see these things manifesting then you
[37:32] just got to go back to the beginning
[37:34] again and I lost my place there is no
[37:37] law and they that are Christ have
[37:40] crucified the flesh with the affections
[37:42] and lust and if we live in the spirit
[37:45] let us also walk in the spirit let us
[37:48] not
[37:49] be my pronunciation desirous of vain
[37:52] Glory provoking one another to eving one
[37:56] another that's one thing that shouldn't
[37:58] be in the Church of God is we shouldn't
[38:00] be envying another man's what another
[38:02] man has or what another man doesn't have
[38:06] but I was going to jump over here I
[38:09] think I got the right
[38:11] place you don't have to turn to it but I
[38:13] was reading this morning over
[38:16] there and it it this Parable really
[38:19] speaks to the day and age that we living
[38:21] this morning and then I'm going to sit
[38:23] down this is in the uh 13th chapter of
[38:26] Matthew it's the 45th
[38:28] verse and it says and again the Kingdom
[38:31] of Heaven is liken onto a merchant man
[38:34] seeking Godly pearls who when he was
[38:37] found one pearl of great price went and
[38:39] sold all that he had and bought it so
[38:43] that really speaks to us are we willing
[38:44] to sell everything that we have this
[38:46] morning are we willing to cast off
[38:49] everything that we have this morning to
[38:51] possess that Pearl and we all know what
[38:53] that Pearl is that's the very presence
[38:55] of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost in our
[38:57] hearts and lives are you willing to give
[38:59] up everything for it this morning and
[39:01] then it goes on to say I'll just read a
[39:03] few more voice verses here again that
[39:06] the Kingdom of Heaven is likened onto a
[39:08] net that was cast into the sea and
[39:10] gathered of every kind and this is the
[39:13] gospel net you can't change people you
[39:16] can't make people be who they're not you
[39:18] just got to let God do it he goes on to
[39:20] say kind which when it was full they
[39:22] drew it to the shore and sat down and
[39:24] gathered The Good Into The Vessel and
[39:26] the cast The Bad away and so shall it be
[39:29] at the end of the world when the Angels
[39:30] shall come forth and S the wicked from
[39:33] among the just and she I'll just finish
[39:36] that verse this morning and it should
[39:38] never discourage you you know to
[39:40] encourage people to be better than they
[39:44] are I I don't I've always had problems
[39:47] with people that tell well if you're not
[39:49] going to do right just be worse i' I've
[39:51] never like that type of attitude in our
[39:54] lives we should always encourage people
[39:56] to be better than they are to be better
[39:58] Christians just to be better people and
[40:01] I was just I'm not trying to be funny in
[40:03] the world that we live in this morning
[40:05] it's going to change you one way or the
[40:07] other it's it's not getting any easier
[40:10] every day we just go further down this
[40:12] course that we're in this morning and
[40:16] it's choosing time like they say and God
[40:19] you're going to find out who you really
[40:20] are and I was just thinking as as an
[40:22] older man you know I was thinking of
[40:25] what Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Isaiah had
[40:28] to say you know you can be a righteous
[40:30] man for 40 or 50 years and if you make a
[40:34] mistake and you don't repent of that
[40:35] mistake your righteousness isn't going
[40:37] to do you any good on that day so
[40:39] whether you're a new believer or an old
[40:42] believer the you have to hold on to that
[40:44] profession of Faith until the end or
[40:46] it's not going to do you any good and as
[40:49] I see this age coming about I just I
[40:52] would just hope that God will keep
[40:54] working on me so I'll be there on that
[40:56] day and then of course Christian will
[40:58] reach out in faith and say God has
[41:00] accepted me so I'll be there on that day
[41:03] Brother

[41:48] have in my heart to to just see God just

[1:14:35] amen the fish are biting Mike and

[1:14:41] bass right Micah so about 50 bass they
[1:14:45] caught out there course they're pretty
[1:14:46] good at it I guess so you might want to
[1:14:49] cut that in half unless you're good you
[1:14:51] know anyway at least I would have to
[1:14:55] amen but still amen so looking forward
[1:14:57] to it amen how many's looking forward to
[1:14:59] fellowshipping together amen I trust
[1:15:01] everybody will be able to make it and so

[1:15:12] praise the Lord so amen let's I can't
[1:15:15] think of any other announcements or
[1:15:16] anything so let's just bow our heads and
[1:15:18] go before the heavenly father we come
[1:15:21] before you Lord and we want to thank you
[1:15:22] Lord Jesus for this opportunity again
[1:15:24] Lord Lord of being able to assemble
[1:15:27] ourselves together Lord Jesus and to be
[1:15:29] able to yield ourselves to you father
[1:15:31] that you might use us to speak and also
[1:15:33] Lord that you might be with the ears of
[1:15:35] the hearer Lord and help each one to
[1:15:37] receive what you have for us this
[1:15:38] morning Lord father we just ask God that
[1:15:41] as we look at your precious promises and
[1:15:43] open your word God that you would lead
[1:15:45] us guide us and help us in everything
[1:15:47] that we say and do now in Jesus name
[1:15:50] amen and amen praise the Lord so amen
[1:15:55] we want to have a part two of Wednesday
[1:15:58] if that's okay amen praise the
[1:16:03] Lord
[1:16:05] amen called releasing the power of God
[1:16:09] amen amen and then I had a subtitle amen
[1:16:12] I believe it was called about letting go
[1:16:15] amen and I want to just touch on some of
[1:16:17] that a little bit more amen I was
[1:16:19] thinking when I was thinking about this
[1:16:21] I says you know whenever you go to a
[1:16:23] restaurant amen and they serve you
[1:16:24] you're real good and the steak's just
[1:16:26] right and amen everything's just real
[1:16:29] good youen go back to that restaurant
[1:16:31] don't you you want some more amen amen
[1:16:34] Longhorns and some of them places that
[1:16:36] try to get it to you right every time
[1:16:38] amen unfortunately we some some
[1:16:40] sometimes we might not get it to you the
[1:16:42] same every time but we do want to
[1:16:44] surrender to God and hopefully it'll be
[1:16:47] a good again this morning amen amen
[1:16:49] because we just don't realize sometimes
[1:16:52] amen that we're privileged people how
[1:16:53] many believes we're real real privileged
[1:16:55] people amen amen and uh so if you will
[1:16:59] we'll turn to Proverbs amen we'll just
[1:17:01] stem from a a scripture amen a scripture
[1:17:05] that I had that came to my mind amen
[1:17:07] that I want to try to build off of with
[1:17:09] just for a little bit with the help of
[1:17:12] the Lord and also then we want to read
[1:17:14] the quote basically that we feel like
[1:17:17] amen was inspired to us from the service
[1:17:20] couple of times ago
[1:17:23] amen amen
[1:17:27] Proverbs
[1:17:28] 23 Proverbs
[1:17:38] 23 and I just want to read half
[1:17:46] uh well we'll read the whole scripture
[1:17:49] there verse seven for as he thinketh in
[1:17:53] his heart so is he
[1:17:56] amen eat and drink saith he to thee but
[1:17:59] his heart is not with thee amen may God
[1:18:02] add His blessings to the reading of the
[1:18:03] word you can be seated this morning amen
[1:18:06] I'm thinking there's another scripture
[1:18:08] and I may be wrong but I thought there
[1:18:10] was a scripture that says as a man
[1:18:12] thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:18:16] amen as a man thinks in his heart so is
[1:18:21] he amen quite a statement amen and we
[1:18:25] want to with the help of the Lord just
[1:18:26] see and and go a little bit further amen
[1:18:29] as deep as we can with that let me see I
[1:18:32] want to I'm going to go ahead and read
[1:18:33] you another one in Matthew 15 and I
[1:18:37] believe it's verse 11 as you know
[1:18:42] um in verse 8 it says 15 and 8 says this
[1:18:48] people draweth nigh unto me with their
[1:18:50] mouth and honth me with their lips but
[1:18:53] their heart is far from me but in vain
[1:18:56] do they worship me teaching for
[1:18:58] doctrines the Commandments of men and he
[1:19:01] called the
[1:19:02] multitude and said unto them hear and
[1:19:08] understand not that which goeth into the
[1:19:11] mouth defileth a man but that which
[1:19:14] cometh out of the mou out of his mouth
[1:19:17] this defileth a man
[1:19:20] amen then came his disciples and said
[1:19:22] unto him knowest thou that the Pharisees
[1:19:24] were offended after they heard this
[1:19:26] saying amen and he answered and said
[1:19:30] every plant which my heavenly father ha
[1:19:32] not planted shall be brooded up let them
[1:19:35] alone they be blind leaders of the blind
[1:19:38] if the blind lead the blind both shall
[1:19:40] fall into the
[1:19:44] ditch he didn't change his tune much did
[1:19:47] he he offended him and I'm sure that if
[1:19:51] they found out what he said about him
[1:19:54] they'd have been off Ed a little bit
[1:19:56] more that right but he said don't worry
[1:19:59] about them they're blind leaders of the
[1:20:03] blind amen and if the blind lead the
[1:20:05] blind they'll both fall into the ditch
[1:20:08] how many knows that Jesus always has a
[1:20:11] way of just kind of telling it how it
[1:20:13] is amen he just he tells it how it is
[1:20:17] and that's what he was doing
[1:20:22] amen then answered Peter and said unto
[1:20:25] him declare unto us this Parable and
[1:20:27] Jesus said are ye also yet without
[1:20:30] understanding do you not yet understand
[1:20:33] that whatsoever entereth into the mouth
[1:20:36] goeth into the belly and is cast out
[1:20:38] into the
[1:20:40] draw now here's where we want to get to
[1:20:42] but those things which proceed out of
[1:20:44] the mouth come forth from the
[1:20:49] heart amen so how many believes it's
[1:20:53] very important what's down in our
[1:20:57] heart

[1:21:05] so is he and another another way you
[1:21:08] know we could look at this is as a man
[1:21:11] focuses and as the goals that you have

[1:21:40] to think about is what you
[1:21:43] become amen and we're privileged people
[1:21:46] this morning that this can apply to
[1:21:50] Christians that as you think in your
[1:21:52] heart that's what you become
[1:21:57] now how many knows when brother B
[1:21:58] preached on Samson and Delilah and he
[1:22:01] talked about you know how that he was
[1:22:02] backslid and so forth amen just once
[1:22:05] more many times he preached on just once
[1:22:07] more Lord Samson had gotten in the
[1:22:10] backslid state amen and he says at the
[1:22:13] end of the most of those service he says
[1:22:15] now we know that Samson knew that in his
[1:22:18] backslid State he was not Amen in the
[1:22:22] condition to meet the challenge of the
[1:22:29] power how many beli that we've got a
[1:22:31] challenge in our
[1:22:34] day and you are going to have to have
[1:22:37] more than the Pentecostals did or the
[1:22:39] Baptist or any other church or anybody
[1:22:45] else amen because we've got a challenge
[1:22:48] amen and that
[1:22:49] challenge is the rapture it's a showdown
[1:22:53] the brother R said
[1:22:55] you're either going to be left here or
[1:22:58] you're going to be raptured and in order
[1:23:00] to be raptured you're going to have to
[1:23:02] be ready for a Rapture and if you're
[1:23:05] ever going to have a body change changed
[1:23:07] in very
[1:23:10] atoms what is it going to

[1:23:44] because you can be as you think in your
[1:23:52] heart I don't always think this say evil
[1:23:55] and all of that amen if Jesus applied
[1:23:57] this to evil thoughts that defile a man
[1:24:00] then guess what when you got good
[1:24:03] thoughts coming for something else is
[1:24:06] going to take
[1:24:07] place your whole being your whole

[1:24:12] of the thoughts that you think the
[1:24:14] thoughts that you allow to come into
[1:24:17] here ain't that right is what you become
[1:24:20] because you through the womb of your
[1:24:21] mind is amen everything that comes comes
[1:24:23] through the Bo of your

[1:25:39] saved on any certainty he said everybody
[1:25:42] that ever got saved got saved when he
[1:25:45] died on

[1:44:06] about two
[1:44:07] Millennia since Jesus died on the cross
[1:44:10] and his word has never
[1:44:13] changed the power of the word has never
[1:44:17] lost one drop of
[1:44:21] power but is waiting for somebody to

[1:44:39] everything I got amen we got to get to a
[1:44:43] place where we are like brother Brandon
[1:44:45] was amen he had to believe it he was
[1:44:47] sick and him and he couldn't eat nothing
[1:44:48] he says if I'm going to die I'm going to
[1:44:50] die and he eat that food and that right
[1:44:53] threw it up and ate it again God help us
[1:44:56] he got his healing shamgar and them they
[1:44:59] were some Mighty Warriors weren't they
[1:45:01] shamgar he didn't have no double second
[1:45:03] thought about it when he grabbed that Ox
[1:45:05] goat up amen he was oh afraid in himself
[1:45:09] I can't handle one of them Philistines
[1:45:11] I'm no Warrior but when he got that Ox
[1:45:12] guard and got a little bit of Faith amen
[1:45:14] and they yield himself to the power of
[1:45:17] God he took out 600 of
[1:45:20] them I don't know if there was any left
[1:45:23] I don't know about Tommy if he left one
[1:45:24] man to go back to tell the story or not
[1:45:27] or if he just simply escaped but I'll
[1:45:28] tell you what if it had been 1,00 2,000
[1:45:31] it wouldn't have
[1:45:34] mattered that's the kind of Faith you
[1:45:36] and I mean like the three Hebrew
[1:45:39] children sometimes you don't know if
[1:45:41] God's going to do it or
[1:45:43] not we don't know but we know this one
[1:45:47] thing we are
[1:45:48] 150% sure that he's
[1:45:51] able we know he's real we know that he's
[1:45:54] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:45:57] this morning all things are possible if
[1:45:59] you will believe that he's the same
[1:46:00] right now as he ever
[1:46:05] was oh my we had cripples in here this
[1:46:08] morning you ought to jump up and say I
[1:46:10] believe he's still a
[1:46:17] Healer no matter what it is if you can
[1:46:20] have faith in the word of God you can
[1:46:21] have it
[1:46:24] it's a finished work
[1:46:27] folks yeah I got say well I got saved in
[1:46:30] 1982 no that's when I accepted what he
[1:46:33] had done for me that's when I recognized
[1:46:36] hey that is for
[1:46:38] me but not only done and we he know that
[1:46:42] he could have never redeemed us outside
[1:46:43] of that shed blood that's why he says he
[1:46:46] you were saved them but in the aspect of
[1:46:49] God's mind it's as good as done when God
[1:46:50] thinks it
[1:46:53] way before the foundation of the world
[1:46:56] so when the devil tries to tell you no
[1:46:57] you're not gonna make it you just take
[1:47:00] the word go back and take that one
[1:47:02] barrel amen take that word amen where
[1:47:04] brother B says if you ever made it you
[1:47:05] already made
[1:47:07] it I many believes that he also said you
[1:47:11] can no more pass away than God can pass
[1:47:13] away because you were part of his
[1:47:15] thinking and his thinking is eternal
[1:47:17] that's what brings
[1:47:20] power that releases
[1:47:25] the power that comes out of that right
[1:47:28] side of that
[1:47:30] shotgun a't that right their devil their
[1:47:35] devil eat on that
[1:47:38] Buckshot
[1:47:45] huh
[1:47:47] amen praise the
[1:47:50] Lord do you want me to give you
[1:47:53] intellectual preaching just stuff that I
[1:47:56] can come up with and say in my mind
[1:47:58] because sometimes it seems that way just
[1:48:00] preaching from my intellect or preaching
[1:48:04] by
[1:48:05] inspiration amen by the power of the
[1:48:08] Holy Ghost I got notes but folks if the
[1:48:11] Lord wants to go completely down a
[1:48:13] little alley somewhere ain't that
[1:48:17] right like when I preached on hope I
[1:48:19] couldn't figure out why in the world I'm
[1:48:20] preaching on Hope amen but until sister
[1:48:22] Janette said that was for
[1:48:24] her and if I'm not wrong I said maybe
[1:48:26] it's just for one person maybe I don't
[1:48:28] know cuz I didn't think about it
[1:48:31] amen but God knows how to come down your
[1:48:34] alley don't he Lord help the preacher to
[1:48:37] get out of the
[1:48:38] way Lord help each
[1:48:41] hearer to be able to hear what the
[1:48:44] spirit is saying to the
[1:48:47] church cuz if you have a blessed ear
[1:48:50] blessed are those ears that hear
[1:48:53] and
[1:48:55] understand you can receive eternal
[1:48:58] life and be set
[1:49:01] free how many believe the power of God
[1:49:04] is to set you
[1:49:10] free we ain't barely got enough freedom
[1:49:13] to laugh or to
[1:49:17] smile

[1:49:42] us that God doesn't want a bunch of wowy
[1:49:44] wowy Woos he wants his children full of
[1:49:47] joy Full Of Love full of power God hates
[1:49:53] a powerless
[1:49:55] Church ain't got enough power to say

[1:54:39] than able to take the Rapture we're more
[1:54:42] than able to come to Perfection we're
[1:54:44] more than able to be without spot and
[1:54:46] without Rael and without blemish at the
[1:54:48] coming of the Lord we're more than able
[1:54:51] to let the five-fold Ministry bring us

[1:56:47] such things he raised the death through
[1:56:49] the prophet opened the eyes of the blind
[1:56:51] healed the sick he wasn't afraid because
[1:56:53] he knew the power of God how many knows
[1:56:57] at the church we as people listen we
[1:56:59] want to see the power of God Paul said I
[1:57:02] don't come to you enticing words of
[1:57:04] man's Wisdom that your faith would rest
[1:57:06] in the wisdom of man but I come to you
[1:57:09] in the power of the holy spirit so that
[1:57:11] your faith will rest in the power of
[1:57:16] God that's what we want to rest on
[1:57:19] completely
[1:57:22] Trials come your way tests come your way
[1:57:25] you can say well that ain't nothing that
[1:57:28] ain't nothing for God my God not to be
[1:57:30] able to handle but how many knows we all
[1:57:33] know what it's like that when you think
[1:57:35] about your own self of how you can
[1:57:37] handle it it gets
[1:57:39] scary oh I don't know if this is gonna
[1:57:43] this is going to be all right
[1:57:45] amen is that right brother Troy knows
[1:57:49] brother R and sister Martha didn't know
[1:57:51] what it's like
[1:57:52] well is Troy going to be okay is this
[1:57:54] going to be all right

[1:58:04] but he's here let's give the Lord a hand
[1:58:08] brother Troy made it God took him
[1:58:11] through some sometimes we can't get over
[1:58:14] it can't get around and we try
[1:58:15] everywhere to go just hold still just
[1:58:19] wait on God how many know sometimes
[1:58:21] patient patience is a real release amen
[1:58:24] of power patience those who through
[1:58:27] patience inherit the promise don't get
[1:58:30] in a hurry you know sometimes I thought

[2:01:24] a little bit higher than what we
[2:01:26] are our heart has to become the very

[2:20:11] can doubt your
[2:20:14] doubts is that right well I don't know I
[2:20:18] don't know that if I can do it
[2:20:21] I doubt that thought I don't believe
[2:20:24] that
[2:20:26] thought I said one more one more quote
[2:20:29] but I want to read you
[2:20:34] this getting almost two wet up here amen
[2:20:37] listen to
[2:20:46] this oh my
[2:20:51] listen when the church disbelieves Satan
[2:20:55] and believes the spiritual the spirit's
[2:20:58] revelation of the word the Gates of Hell
[2:21:01] cannot Prevail against
[2:21:05] her
[2:21:06] disbel the devil amen disbelieve what he
[2:21:10] says and accept God and His word the
[2:21:14] Gates of Hell will never Prevail against
[2:21:17] us Satan knows that the original church
[2:21:19] at Pentecost with the power of God not
[2:21:23] your
[2:21:25] power I I I hate repeating myself 10
[2:21:28] times but let me say it
[2:21:31] again emptying out and letting go is
[2:21:33] about you getting rid of your onean
[2:21:36] power and become a thousand horsepower
[2:21:40] so to speak a million horsepower
[2:21:44] unlimited there you go now we're getting
[2:21:46] right unlimited not a th000 not 10,000
[2:21:49] but you go from a very very limited
[2:21:52] power to
[2:21:54] unlimited
[2:21:56] power all of the hosts of Heaven all of
[2:22:00] the power of God is with you when you
[2:22:04] can let go of yourself and the hardest
[2:22:07] thing for any of us to do is to let go
[2:22:10] of our s our Ambitions our goals our
[2:22:14] plans is that
[2:22:16] right every one of us should say this
[2:22:18] morning well you know
[2:22:21] whether it's Wesson going to college
[2:22:22] this that or the other and no matter
[2:22:24] what it
[2:22:25] is maybe you've got a business you want
[2:22:28] to start maybe this that or the other
[2:22:29] just remember say God I want your plan
[2:22:32] in my life whatever your plan is that's
[2:22:36] what I want whatever your will
[2:22:42] is the disciples came back bringing food
[2:22:45] back to Jesus and and they ask him have
[2:22:47] you got any meat he says you know he
[2:22:48] says I'll tell you what my meat is I'll
[2:22:50] tell you what my food is my food and my
[2:22:53] my food is to do my father's will ain't
[2:22:57] that right that's the way we should feel
[2:22:59] my meat is to do the father's
[2:23:01] will whatever that
[2:23:05] is praise the
[2:23:09] Lord
[2:23:11] amen Satan hates
[2:23:14] Revelation he hates when you get a real
[2:23:16] revelation of God how many knows that
[2:23:19] I'm GNA I'm going to stop here here in a
[2:23:24] minute he knows assuredly that the
[2:23:26] original Church of Pentecost with the
[2:23:28] power of God Mark 16 in action is the
[2:23:31] true church that Jesus comes and claims
[2:23:33] for his
[2:23:37] own I just want to say evening light
[2:23:40] Tabernacle Saints we're starting to look
[2:23:43] a little bit more like the book of
[2:23:48] Acts and I'll tell you what come comes
[2:23:50] to my mind the reason I say that is
[2:23:53] because of how much brother brother bam
[2:23:55] emphasized that it's not he said it's so
[2:23:58] important that those original Saints
[2:24:00] amen they were not led by man or Bishops
[2:24:03] and this out or the other but the
[2:24:05] original church was led by the Holy
[2:24:08] Ghost how many believes that's what we
[2:24:10] got to be led by is by the power of the
[2:24:12] Holy Ghost each individual in the church
[2:24:14] has to be led by the Holy
[2:24:17] Ghost and we'll see amen his power his
[2:24:20] in him in action amen
[2:24:25] listen The Book of Revelation shows that
[2:24:28] the Antichrist Spirit would come in to
[2:24:30] the church defile it making it look
[2:24:35] warm
[2:24:37] formal and
[2:24:44] Powerless second Timothy 3 it says you
[2:24:46] know that there be lovers of pleasure
[2:24:48] more than lovers of God and he and high
[2:24:50] minded and traitors and all these things
[2:24:52] and
[2:24:53] having a church a form of godliness but
[2:24:58] denying the power
[2:25:02] thereof how many knows the power of God
[2:25:05] makes you act different live
[2:25:08] different it'll make you cut your hair
[2:25:10] different or not cut your hair it'll
[2:25:12] make you wear dresses that are not too
[2:25:15] tight it'll make you men amen not wear
[2:25:17] shorts out there in public and
[2:25:18] everything else hello
[2:25:21] it'll make you conform to the word of
[2:25:24] God
[2:25:27] hallelujah and you won't be formal it
[2:25:30] ain't going to be
[2:25:32] formality Oh I thought about this and it
[2:25:34] scared me and I as I was studying I
[2:25:36] thought maybe I should ask everybody you
[2:25:39] should ask yourself do I just come to
[2:25:42] church as a
[2:25:43] farm cuz that's scary and that's
[2:25:46] dangerous just to come no I don't just
[2:25:49] come to come I come to worship God I
[2:25:52] come to praise God I come to get
[2:25:54] something for God and if you leave that
[2:25:56] the same come to same and leave like
[2:25:58] almost seeming the same all the time
[2:26:00] maybe it's just formal don't deceive
[2:26:03] yourself you're not going in that
[2:26:06] condition you better get hot for God and
[2:26:11] have some power about you amen oh
[2:26:14] Revelation exposes Satan attempt at
[2:26:17] destruction of God's people and
[2:26:18] discrediting of God's word right down to
[2:26:20] the time that he's cast into the Lake of
[2:26:22] Fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[2:26:25] he knows if the people get a true
[2:26:26] revelation of the true
[2:26:28] church how many knows if you really get
[2:26:31] a revelation of who you are the devil
[2:26:34] will be powerless in front of you Jesus
[2:26:36] what what it about him he knew who he
[2:26:42] was now if I was to ask everybody does
[2:26:45] the devil sometimes cast doubt in your
[2:26:47] mind about who you are because that's
[2:26:49] his business
[2:26:51] if he does he's doing his job trying to
[2:26:54] get you to wonder whether you're really
[2:26:56] a son and daughter of God he's about
[2:26:59] that business you just slap him right

[2:27:58] came to his own and his own received him
[2:28:00] not but as many as believed gave he the
[2:28:03] power to become Sons and Daughters of
[2:28:08] God
