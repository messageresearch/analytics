[8:24] right morning
[8:57] uh
[9:28] [Music]
[9:32] psalms 39.
[9:45] almost 39.
[9:57] all the way
[10:03] [Music]
[10:12] is
[10:29] every man
[10:47] is
[11:11] is
[11:14] sure
[11:33] foreign
[12:00] you really think you are sometimes
[12:03] not according to the word of god
[12:07] you see that a lot of two men and women
[12:09] that
[12:10] put their all open their riches or the
[12:13] things they know how to do and don't put
[12:15] their hopes in anything else and
[12:17] you see them one day and they're
[12:18] everything time and yesterday their
[12:20] whole life
[12:21] falling apart put their trust trusted
[12:23] the wrong thing
[12:24] if you would turn with me to you uh
[12:27] john first john the fourth chapter
[12:32] i was thanking you
[12:35] you know there's a lot going on in our
[12:36] world but
[12:39] there's a lot of noise out there
[12:41] a lot of bad information you know
[12:47] i guess what you can see out there in
[12:49] the world in the natural sense
[13:02] there's so much this information out
[13:04] there in the world you know but i think
[13:06] of it this way
[13:09] if all the lying that has been done to
[13:11] us the last few years
[13:14] had been done 20 years ago you wouldn't
[13:16] have any other place to go to other than
[13:18] the source of
[13:19] all sources of information
[13:21] you had 30 years ago so you wouldn't
[13:23] know what the truth is or you wouldn't
[13:25] be able to find
[13:26] because there would have been no
[13:28] internet let's say or whatever we used
[13:31] to get our information so
[13:43] information about whether it's coded or
[13:45] anything else going on in the world
[14:00] you know we shouldn't be that way but
[14:03] the church has gone through the same
[14:04] thing essentially jesus wanted the same
[14:07] thing
[14:08] but all the different
[14:11] government scriptures on this fourth
[14:12] chapter
[14:21] believe not every spirit but try the
[14:23] spirits whether they are of god because
[14:25] many false prophets
[14:27] have gone out into the world and hereby
[14:30] we know the spirit of god every spirit
[14:32] that confesses that jesus christ is
[14:34] coming the flesh
[14:36] of god
[14:37] and you know that real revelation right
[14:39] there that's a true interpretation of
[14:41] the whole bible that you know who jesus
[14:44] christ is and what he means to you or
[14:47] to the world and then he goes on and
[14:49] says
[14:50] i never swear that confesses not to
[14:52] jesus christ has come into the flesh not
[14:54] of god
[14:56] and that is of antichrist wherever they
[14:58] have occurred that should come even now
[15:00] it's already in this in the world
[15:04] and here
[15:06] excuse me you're a year of god and
[15:08] little children
[15:09] and have overcome
[15:38] him
[15:39] i'll just read the first ten verses and
[15:42] you know there came a man of god out of
[15:44] jesus by the word of the lord on the
[15:46] battle jeroboam
[15:49] he made us
[15:51] he did a brainstem in
[15:53] at that time because he told his people
[15:55] to go worship here at this place
[15:58] when it was supposed to worship he goes
[16:00] on to burn inside
[16:03] and he cried against the altar in the
[16:05] word of iran and said oh although
[16:21] and he gave a sign the same day saying
[16:23] this
[16:24] spoke to hope
[16:26] the altar shall be read and the actual
[16:28] farmer shall be poured out
[16:30] it came to pass from king carabao and he
[16:33] heard the sayings of the men
[16:49] up the prophet told them that this was
[16:51] no good you know they burnt the offer
[16:53] and they consumed it they destroyed it
[16:56] but i'll jump down this is when the
[16:57] father was told not to go any other way
[17:00] and then another problem came from
[17:02] instead was
[17:16] he
[17:29] that god told you to do something
[18:00] he was just as important as moses was
[18:03] and he caused people to sin
[18:05] uh nathan was the same way there were
[18:07] numerous examples where people were
[18:09] given were given false information out
[18:11] for the people of god and it was as
[18:14] wrong but what i was thinking this
[18:16] morning the most important thing
[18:19] is that you do the right thing i i have
[18:21] a i think
[18:22] brad read this last week
[18:24] but if you go into your classroom this
[18:27] morning
[18:31] and it says
[18:33] it says keep you risen with christ this
[18:36] is the third shot for washington i mean
[18:38] i have numerous examples
[18:53] he chose to believe the false
[18:55] information knowing that elijah had told
[18:57] him that justice was coming to him
[19:00] because maybe he the word of the lord
[19:02] in the days of elijah the things they
[19:04] chose to believe that lie in scripture
[19:08] they told him what
[19:28] and that's really important
[19:29] that everything
[19:31] we are dependent upon having a
[19:33] relationship with jesus
[19:37] of jesus christ
[19:39] and it's reflecting now to the world
[19:40] when josiah is saying
[19:42] when christ who is our life shall appear
[19:44] and then shall you also appear with me
[19:47] in love and glory
[19:49] mortify therefore in your members which
[19:51] are upon the earth
[19:53] and it says our fornication and
[19:56] uncleanness and northern affection evil
[19:59] forgive my pronunciation commonness and
[20:02] covetousness which is a daughter
[20:04] for which say the wrath of god
[20:06] comes on the children
[20:08] and the thing i was thinking this
[20:10] morning
[20:11] you know everything out there in the
[20:12] world
[20:16] you know everything you'll see out there
[20:17] in the world will even
[20:31] [Music]
[20:33] this is what needs to be in the heart
[20:35] like the message of the hour of our
[20:37] bible because just by your saying this
[20:40] is the true word of god and if this is
[20:42] abiding in the heart meaning the life
[20:44] when you see all those things that are
[20:46] conquered by
[21:17] jesus christ
[21:31] this morning
[21:47] amen i'm standing in that little course
[21:50] all my hope is in jesus this morning if
[21:52] we could
[21:53] amend
[21:58] is in jesus

[22:21] been washed by
[22:24] the blood once again this morning
[22:27] and all
[22:29] my hope is it
[22:32] jesus

[22:39] yesterday's gone

[22:46] my sins are forgiven

[54:08] hope you're our strength
[54:10] your future lord your everything
[54:12] to us
[54:13] we ask god that you'll bless the reading
[54:15] of the word the meditation of our heart
[54:16] father bless the scripture as we read it
[54:18] lord we trust god that we'll just be
[54:21] right in line with what you want us to
[54:22] speak on this morning say what you once
[54:24] said lord come and do what you want to
[54:26] do father lord we welcome you just here
[54:29] this morning in our hearts and in our
[54:30] lives and we do thank you lord jesus for
[54:32] the covert seemingly kind of being over
[54:34] with amen and kind of seems to be in the
[54:36] background so lord we do thank you
[54:38] father for that thank you for everybody
[54:40] that's feeling well touch those that
[54:42] don't feel too good this morning ask god
[54:44] for healing bless the reading of the
[54:45] word now and lord as we try to expound
[54:48] father which i feel lord you've laid
[54:49] upon our heart to minister to your
[54:51] people this morning we asked lord jesus
[54:53] that you had opened my mouth lord to say
[54:55] the things that they need to hear and
[54:57] may the word father find a good ground
[55:00] may that seed find good ground lord
[55:02] jesus and bring forth a hundredfold we
[55:05] ask it in jesus christ's name amen and
[55:08] amen if you will turn your bibles if you
[55:10] will to the
[55:11] uh book of
[55:14] we'll go to
[55:16] the book of corinthians i think it's
[55:18] first corinthians
[55:22] amen with what's going on in the world
[55:25] today i just feel that to kind of go
[55:27] this direction and then we know that the
[55:29] world is certainly un
[55:32] it's kind of on edge isn't it it's just
[55:34] being shaken amen even the nato and the
[55:37] different countries all put together
[55:39] they really there's not too much they
[55:41] can do because everything's so
[55:43] interlocked that if they do something to
[55:45] russia
[55:46] they end up hurting themselves so they
[55:48] don't want to hurt themselves so they're
[55:50] not going to do anything you know and so
[55:52] it's had a real pickle so to speak you
[55:54] know
[55:55] and so anyway we
[55:57] i mean we just know that uh the world
[55:59] may be all shook up we but we don't have
[56:01] to be
[56:02] amen because we know that uh we we
[56:06] receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken
[56:08] everything that can be shaken will be
[56:10] shaken
[56:11] amen but we receive his kingdom by god's
[56:14] grace that can't be shaken so first
[56:16] corinthians 11.
[56:19] verse 25 after the same manner also he
[56:21] took the cup and when he had sub saying
[56:24] this cup is the new testament in my
[56:25] blood this two years after she drink it
[56:28] in remembrance of me for as often as you
[56:30] eat this bread and do drink this cup you
[56:33] do show the lord's death till he come
[56:34] wherefore whosoever shall eat of this
[56:36] bread and drink of this cup of the lord
[56:38] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[56:40] and blood of the lord
[56:42] but let a man examine himself and so let
[56:44] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[56:46] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[56:48] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[56:50] to himself not discerning the lord's
[56:52] body for this cause many who are weak
[56:54] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[56:56] if we would judge ourselves
[56:58] we should not be judged but when we are
[57:00] judged we are chastened of the lord that
[57:02] we should not be
[57:03] condemned with the world may god had his
[57:05] blessings to reading the words you can
[57:06] be seated this morning
[57:08] amen so we
[57:10] find this morning and amen it just it
[57:12] goes to show you that
[57:14] you know something i really love that
[57:16] the prophet has told us and that is that
[57:18] you know the word of god is just eternal
[57:20] and it all ties together isn't that
[57:22] right
[57:23] it all ties together and you can take
[57:25] well i'll take with a thought from this
[57:28] this morning and just see what the lord
[57:30] will have for us but just to show you
[57:32] that
[57:33] amen god is god is eternal and so is his
[57:36] word i want to take my thought out of
[57:38] the 28th verse this morning
[57:40] let a man but let a man examine himself
[57:44] and so let him eat of that bread and
[57:46] drink of that cup
[57:47] now down in verse 31 also it says for if
[57:51] we would judge ourselves we should not
[57:53] be judged amen
[57:56] and i want to talk about examination
[58:00] examining
[58:02] ourselves
[58:04] that okay
[58:05] you can say amen it's all right it's not
[58:06] going to hurt my feelings amen that's
[58:08] how it works right you got to crank me
[58:11] up now
[58:12] amen praise the lord but examining
[58:15] ourself i like that not only examining
[58:18] ourselves but judging ourselves
[58:23] hey man you know what i i just maybe for
[58:27] a little sense of humor this morning the
[58:29] only thing i remember about you know
[58:31] taking an examination and you know you
[58:34] know most of time when you have an
[58:35] examination deal doctor i have wanted
[58:37] like a stethoscope right
[58:39] and then i had to tell my ass my wife
[58:41] this morning now a stethoscope is that
[58:42] but they listen to your heart with right
[58:45] yeah that's what that is okay so we got
[58:47] a stethoscope you know and then i
[58:49] remembered that the only time i remember
[58:51] ever buying a stethoscope is when i was
[58:54] uh
[58:54] i was i played a doctor for just a
[58:56] little while
[58:58] all right
[58:59] and i bought a static scope and all
[59:01] these other things and me and my wife
[59:03] when we were young and a little bit
[59:04] crazy we just had to have our kid at
[59:06] home we're gonna have a child at home
[59:08] forget about doctors right
[59:10] and so i bought this you know they
[59:14] taught me like i knew about the
[59:15] heartbeat i guess i wanted to hear the
[59:17] baby's heartbeat or something you know
[59:19] but anyway you know baby was fine and so
[59:21] forth and and you know it
[59:24] ended up i was you know i delivered the
[59:26] baby right well i'll tell you what let
[59:28] me tell you something no man never know
[59:30] deliver no baby she delivered baby
[59:33] i would just there would come right
[59:35] amen but anyway so i thought well you
[59:39] know
[59:40] it's just something else but listen and
[59:41] then what what's the second thing that
[59:43] happens another thing that a doctor do
[59:46] is you'll put this thing around your arm
[59:47] right and he'll check your blood
[59:48] pressure because how many knows that
[59:50] life stream it has to do with your life
[59:52] stream tommy i mean that the live stream
[59:55] is very very important and that's what
[59:56] we want to deal with and dwell on a
[59:58] little bit is that live stream i'm
[1:00:00] talking about the blood we know that the
[1:00:02] life is what in the blood now even your
[1:00:04] blood pressure doesn't tell you
[1:00:05] everything but if they really want to
[1:00:07] know what what what is wrong with you
[1:00:09] what do they do
[1:00:11] they will draw blood right
[1:00:13] because in that blood you'll find almost
[1:00:15] anything that's wrong with you or that
[1:00:17] you need or that you like it's all in
[1:00:19] that blood it depends on what's in that
[1:00:21] blood
[1:00:23] but now so you notice and i want to get
[1:00:25] into that for just a little bit because
[1:00:27] uh this is first of all i just want to
[1:00:29] kind of start out here with this thing
[1:00:31] about examination we know that we should
[1:00:34] examine ourselves and that that's what
[1:00:36] we come to church for isn't that right
[1:00:39] i believe it was in job that in job's
[1:00:42] time it says that israel and so forth
[1:00:43] that
[1:00:45] god to present themselves before the
[1:00:48] lord
[1:00:50] amen and so when we come to the house of
[1:00:52] god amen we come and we so to speak look
[1:00:55] in the mirror
[1:00:57] right this is god smear for us we look
[1:01:00] at ourselves and see what we look like
[1:01:03] see what we're like
[1:01:07] because this is our when i believe
[1:01:11] that it's very important that we examine
[1:01:15] ourself
[1:01:17] it's what we call my checking up time
[1:01:20] brother joe
[1:01:21] i may believe that it's checking up time
[1:01:24] and i thought about this scripture here
[1:01:26] it's the second scripture i thought
[1:01:27] about but uh you know i thought this is
[1:01:30] this is uh
[1:01:32] timely because even the prophet said
[1:01:33] that each month you know when we take
[1:01:35] this every time that we take the
[1:01:37] communion
[1:01:39] it is a time that you got to examine
[1:01:41] yourself
[1:01:42] we take it once a month so uh let me put
[1:01:45] this down a little bit micah
[1:01:47] so once a month we get to really search
[1:01:49] our heart you
[1:01:51] as we bow our heads and as we close our
[1:01:54] eyes
[1:01:56] and we begin to think about whether
[1:01:58] we're worthy to take of that cup
[1:02:01] whether we have lived a life worthy
[1:02:04] of drinking from that cup and drinking
[1:02:05] of that bread because if we drink
[1:02:07] unworthily we drink damnation to
[1:02:10] ourselves
[1:02:12] and it's a time that we take a good look
[1:02:14] at ourselves now let me just say this i
[1:02:17] truly believe that
[1:02:18] you know in all the faults that we have
[1:02:20] because even the prophet of god said
[1:02:22] every day we fall short
[1:02:24] every day we sin
[1:02:26] and if you just think about beginning to
[1:02:28] look at your faults it's a scary thing
[1:02:29] sometimes right
[1:02:31] you begin you could if you really get
[1:02:33] serious you just take a good look at
[1:02:35] what you really like right
[1:02:37] who you really are and what your life
[1:02:39] really brings and sometimes it can be
[1:02:41] scary
[1:02:42] you know because simply because perhaps
[1:02:44] you're not witnessing like you should or
[1:02:45] you're not on fire like you should and
[1:02:47] and so forth not that you're just suing
[1:02:49] outright sin but you're still falling
[1:02:51] short of really reaching out to souls
[1:02:54] and
[1:02:54] and doing what a lot of the gospel asks
[1:02:56] us to do
[1:02:58] amen and i like i'm i'm thankful for
[1:03:01] this that when you do look at yourself
[1:03:03] amen and you see your own faults and you
[1:03:05] see where you might the devil would try
[1:03:06] to tell you well you ain't no christian
[1:03:11] huh
[1:03:12] or you're not really worthy to go in the
[1:03:14] rapture
[1:03:16] you're not really raptured material and
[1:03:18] you're not really fit to live in heaven
[1:03:20] or or whatever whatever it might be the
[1:03:22] devil will give you all kinds of
[1:03:23] thoughts
[1:03:24] right
[1:03:25] but then you gotta take and you gotta
[1:03:27] begin to look and you gotta see
[1:03:31] where your lord brought you from
[1:03:33] you got to have an experience i mean
[1:03:35] you're going to have to have a place
[1:03:37] like a place where you drove down that
[1:03:39] stake and you made that commitment to
[1:03:41] god and god come and he changed your
[1:03:43] life he changed your desires
[1:03:47] amen now i don't know if everybody can
[1:03:48] do that but i can take you to the time
[1:03:50] and i can take you to the place where
[1:03:52] the lord saved me by his wonderful grace
[1:03:55] and i see how god has brought me through
[1:03:57] and has always carried me through how
[1:03:59] he's always been there and always in
[1:04:01] miracle after miracle i look at that and
[1:04:03] i realize lord i'm not what i want to be
[1:04:07] huh
[1:04:08] you know what our testimony would be
[1:04:09] this morning you can say amen
[1:04:12] are you not where you want to be
[1:04:15] you're not what you want to be you're
[1:04:16] not what you should be but thank god
[1:04:18] you're not what you are
[1:04:24] amen aren't you glad that you're not not
[1:04:26] what you was and that's what's happening
[1:04:28] and listen so let me just say this
[1:04:31] not just once a month we shouldn't just
[1:04:33] examine ourselves once the month
[1:04:38] what if you only took a shower once a
[1:04:39] month
[1:04:41] you just think like some of those folks
[1:04:43] that don't and you'd be like take a
[1:04:45] shower right
[1:04:51] and that's for our lives too isn't that
[1:04:53] right we can't stand stench on our life
[1:04:56] if you really do have something down
[1:04:58] here
[1:04:59] that wrong in you irritates you
[1:05:02] that wrong in you bothers you if it
[1:05:05] doesn't you're in a lot of trouble
[1:05:09] that means that you really aren't in a
[1:05:11] place to even examine yourself people
[1:05:13] don't like to examine themselves
[1:05:17] we are awesome we are 20 20 envisioners
[1:05:21] and examiners of others
[1:05:26] oh my let me just say this the devil
[1:05:28] will give you 20 20 vision when it comes
[1:05:31] to taking that some kind of a microscope
[1:05:34] and seeing everybody else's fault
[1:05:41] and it's only after the holy ghost comes
[1:05:44] that that fault of everybody else's
[1:05:46] blurs
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:48] you can't really see everybody else's
[1:05:50] faults and all of a sudden your own
[1:05:52] faults get really big
[1:05:54] really
[1:05:56] magnified
[1:05:58] the holy ghost will show you

[1:06:33] there's a lot more pointing at you than
[1:06:34] what there is that the other person
[1:06:36] that's what god will do for you that's
[1:06:38] what all the holy ghosts will do for you
[1:06:41] amen
[1:06:43] let me talk about the time for just a
[1:06:45] little bit let me just read you a quote
[1:06:47] here like i wanted to
[1:06:49] brother baby makes a statement he says
[1:06:51] you remember church that you're living
[1:06:53] in the best day
[1:06:54] that you will ever live in
[1:06:59] right now until jesus comes
[1:07:03] it will gradually not gradually but
[1:07:05] rapidly get worse and worse
[1:07:09] folks haven't we seen that in the last
[1:07:11] eight years or so
[1:07:12] we've things you think go rapidly worse
[1:07:15] and worse
[1:07:17] huh
[1:07:21] think about it
[1:07:23] communism isn't over in russia
[1:07:26] it's our in our congress
[1:07:29] they want communism is what they want
[1:07:32] they want to let all our wicked
[1:07:34] prisoners out murderers they want them
[1:07:36] on the streets
[1:07:38] they don't want you to arrest nobody
[1:07:39] they want to let everybody go again
[1:07:41] don't take all the police away they
[1:07:43] don't want no police what what is that
[1:07:45] that is desiring destruction of that
[1:07:47] civilization
[1:07:51] huh
[1:07:52] where is all our other congressmen and
[1:07:53] so forth up there being a man like
[1:07:55] brother benham says
[1:07:57] stick up for something don't just be
[1:07:59] wishy-washy well if i say this about
[1:08:01] this person you know this this will
[1:08:03] happen no say what you need to say
[1:08:05] say what needs to be said
[1:08:08] amen but look this is the word we're
[1:08:11] living in and it'll rapidly get worse
[1:08:14] and worse this was in 57 the coming of
[1:08:16] the lord when russia goes down there to
[1:08:19] get that oil look out
[1:08:22] amen now i don't know if this is what
[1:08:24] this is i have no idea whether this is
[1:08:26] what this is all about but we know
[1:08:27] russia's on the move right
[1:08:31] and putin's mad right
[1:08:34] he's furious can you imagine
[1:08:36] uh atheistic nation as the prophet of
[1:08:39] god said a bunch of sinners
[1:08:42] your destination and a nuclear war is in
[1:08:45] their hands
[1:08:48] huh
[1:08:49] oh my look at the uncertainty look out
[1:08:52] that's all she needs that's what the
[1:08:53] prophet said it'll do we're really in
[1:08:56] for it then amen
[1:08:58] we're really in for it then so it's so
[1:09:00] much changing who knows what this will
[1:09:01] evolve into
[1:09:03] right we don't know
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:08] aren't you glad though
[1:09:11] that brother bam says you have that
[1:09:13] if those missiles are coming up and they
[1:09:15] get up into the air
[1:09:17] huh
[1:09:19] but i've never said that you would be
[1:09:21] gone before those missiles would be
[1:09:23] launched
[1:09:25] he said they would you would be gone
[1:09:28] before they would crack he uses the
[1:09:30] words
[1:09:31] before they'll break open hallelujah how
[1:09:34] many sad for that amen
[1:09:37] and as you know everybody's getting edgy
[1:09:41] everybody's getting trigger happy
[1:09:45] you know what happens before a fight is
[1:09:47] they begin to threaten each other
[1:09:49] huh
[1:09:51] when you begin to threaten look out
[1:09:54] oh my
[1:09:55] and so we're just on the verge how we
[1:09:57] made it this far how we got to 20 and 22
[1:10:00] is it i don't know
[1:10:04] all i know is there must be another name
[1:10:06] written that has to get redeemed
[1:10:09] i mean somebody else has to come in
[1:10:12] because when that last one comes in the
[1:10:14] rapture is going to take place
[1:10:17] christ is going to come
[1:10:20] remember this folks there is absolutely
[1:10:23] no hope for the financial world there
[1:10:25] ain't no hope for nothing down
[1:10:28] here amen that's why i like the sunday
[1:10:31] school brother brian talking about amen
[1:10:33] set your affections on things above
[1:10:36] not on things below
[1:10:41] because there is no hope for this
[1:10:42] there's only one hope only one goal that
[1:10:45] you and i have
[1:10:48] how many know that there's only one goal
[1:10:50] and that is just watch the skies part
[1:10:53] and christ to come back and to receive
[1:10:55] us to himself
[1:10:59] and i don't believe that that's going to
[1:11:00] be seen at all by the world out there
[1:11:03] you will receive a body change and
[1:11:05] you'll see him on a glorified cloud
[1:11:07] because she gets caught away and
[1:11:09] snatched away like a thief in the night
[1:11:12] we have to get changed to see him
[1:11:16] amen but there will come a time when
[1:11:17] everybody is going to see him
[1:11:20] but he's going to take us out
[1:11:22] that's our goal how many knows it that's
[1:11:23] our goal
[1:11:25] so it's checking up time
[1:11:27] and i got to think about how this is
[1:11:29] shaking up time and i really wanted to
[1:11:31] speak on what really began to lead me
[1:11:32] into a direction i wanted to go was want
[1:11:34] to talk about
[1:11:35] that which is real
[1:11:38] and that which is a substitute
[1:11:41] right
[1:11:42] amen because the devil offers all kinds
[1:11:44] of substitutes and things amen
[1:11:47] but let me just say this how many know
[1:11:49] so we're looking we don't know exactly
[1:11:51] everything but we know
[1:11:53] that the coming of the lord draws close
[1:11:57] it's getting close
[1:12:00] so he says right after that we're ready
[1:12:02] for it then so church
[1:12:04] get ready to meet christ
[1:12:08] get ready to be christ he's sending
[1:12:10] great revivals and meetings stirring the
[1:12:12] full gospel people signs and wonders
[1:12:14] appearing everywhere
[1:12:16] gave great wanderers to draw his people
[1:12:18] together and one day he will come
[1:12:21] praise the lord
[1:12:24] one day
[1:12:26] he will come
[1:12:28] now turn will with me again to second
[1:12:31] corinthians if you will
[1:12:34] we'll try to
[1:12:36] just take our time in the lord this
[1:12:38] morning is that all right
[1:12:40] beautiful sunshine nice and warm and
[1:12:43] i just like
[1:12:44] the warmth of the holy spirit
[1:12:47] this is the best time of your whole week
[1:12:49] isn't it when we get together and
[1:12:51] worship the lord in spirit and truth
[1:12:54] okay
[1:12:56] let me see here
[1:13:04] second corinthians 13
[1:13:14] 13-5
[1:13:16] paul says examine yourselves
[1:13:20] whether you be in the faith
[1:13:23] prove your own selves
[1:13:27] amen
[1:13:29] no you're not
[1:13:30] your own selves and i like that i got to
[1:13:32] think about that examine ourselves you
[1:13:34] know there's really nobody that knows
[1:13:36] you better than you
[1:13:39] right
[1:13:41] because sometimes we hide things
[1:13:45] right
[1:13:46] you would probably never tell even your
[1:13:48] wife or your husband sometimes the
[1:13:50] thoughts that go through your mind
[1:13:55] i got some nods here yeah some people
[1:13:57] honest
[1:13:58] because i'm telling you what you let
[1:14:00] this ghost just a little bit you just
[1:14:02] let it go a little bit and buddy it'll
[1:14:04] go think thoughts that you should have
[1:14:05] never thought
[1:14:08] whether it's uh uh uh against somebody
[1:14:11] or somebody did you wrong and
[1:14:14] man man if i had the chance what you
[1:14:15] would do to him
[1:14:18] and you have to bring that thought now
[1:14:19] what in the world you want to think like
[1:14:21] that for get right how many's got to do
[1:14:23] that to yourself
[1:14:25] that's right you have thoughts and know
[1:14:27] it's just all kinds of things you know
[1:14:28] and the world we live in all kinds it
[1:14:30] has to bring
[1:14:31] be brought captive
[1:14:33] and you have to examine you know
[1:14:35] yourself
[1:14:37] in every aspect of your life you should
[1:14:39] know
[1:14:40] what you like
[1:14:42] isn't that something that paul both
[1:14:44] times says examine yourself i may not
[1:14:46] see it you may not see it
[1:14:48] i may not see it in you you may not see
[1:14:50] it in me
[1:14:51] but you know it in yourself
[1:14:53] that's why you gotta examine yourself
[1:14:59] prove
[1:15:01] your own self
[1:15:02] right
[1:15:03] prove yourself
[1:15:10] i will say this
[1:15:13] many
[1:15:14] will come to him in that day
[1:15:17] now right
[1:15:18] and say haven't we done this and haven't
[1:15:21] we prophesied in your name
[1:15:23] all right
[1:15:26] and done many mighty works in your name
[1:15:30] right
[1:15:35] have we cast out devils in thy name done
[1:15:39] many wonderful works
[1:15:42] ma
[1:15:44] can we say that
[1:15:46] they call him lord lord
[1:15:48] haven't we prophesied
[1:15:50] spoke in tongues haven't we prophesy
[1:15:55] how many knows
[1:15:57] brother manhattan talked about
[1:15:59] matthew 24 and how there'll be many
[1:16:01] false christs rise and false prophets
[1:16:04] and do great signs and wonders and so
[1:16:05] much and so much that if it was possible
[1:16:08] it would receive the very elect
[1:16:13] and he pointed to the prophet pointed to
[1:16:15] the pentecostal church
[1:16:18] because they could prophesy and it would
[1:16:19] come to pass and all these things and
[1:16:22] speak in tongues and they say that's the
[1:16:24] evidence that you got it
[1:16:27] huh
[1:16:29] the prophet says look i've seen witch
[1:16:31] doctors speaking unknown tanks have pen
[1:16:33] writing
[1:16:34] tongues and everything else
[1:16:37] just because you can speak in tongues
[1:16:38] don't mean you got it
[1:16:41] so don't rely on gifts as we begin to
[1:16:43] examine ourselves this morning we don't
[1:16:45] rely on what you've done don't rely on
[1:16:48] on the gifts that you have thomas paula
[1:16:50] can't rely on the fact that he's giving
[1:16:53] him a gift to preach that's got nothing
[1:16:54] to do with me
[1:16:57] that's i gotta examine way down in here
[1:16:59] i gotta dig deeper than that that don't
[1:17:01] make me right that don't make me a
[1:17:03] christian just because i've got the
[1:17:04] ability to preach
[1:17:08] huh
[1:17:09] just because somebody can prophesy and
[1:17:11] speak it down that don't mean it because
[1:17:13] even doing many mighty works
[1:17:16] even having faith to do things
[1:17:21] because remember it'll be very very
[1:17:24] deceiving people will deceive themselves
[1:17:27] because they know closely examine
[1:17:30] themselves
[1:17:33] [Music]
[1:17:34] and it's sad that they have to wait
[1:17:36] until on the day of judgment to be told
[1:17:39] you missed it
[1:17:41] you didn't have it
[1:17:45] huh
[1:17:51] there's only one interest that i have
[1:17:54] that is to be ready
[1:17:58] only one thing goal that i have in 22 as
[1:18:01] a pastor
[1:18:03] and that is to have you ready
[1:18:08] i want you ready and if you're not going
[1:18:10] to be ready it's not going to be on me
[1:18:14] because that's my job
[1:18:16] it's a minister for the edification of
[1:18:19] the body of christ to bring us to the
[1:18:21] unity of the faith to the stature of the
[1:18:23] fullness of christ
[1:18:25] all right that's my job god help me to
[1:18:27] do my job
[1:18:29] that's my goal is to be ready because
[1:18:31] he's going to come when people are not
[1:18:34] looking for it he's going to come at an
[1:18:35] unexpected time
[1:18:41] but not for those that are watching
[1:18:43] because jesus said blessed are those
[1:18:45] that watch and they keep their garment
[1:18:47] that that they will not come to you as
[1:18:49] he thinks
[1:18:54] oh i don't know about you but i want to
[1:18:56] live every day the prophet of god when
[1:18:58] he spoke on souls in prison now he
[1:18:59] talked about man maybe it's already
[1:19:01] passed maybe we're already preaching to
[1:19:03] the total lot he was on the complete
[1:19:05] expectation for christ to come anytime
[1:19:10] and listen you might say well look how
[1:19:12] long this went it don't matter how long
[1:19:14] until it goes you should be ready and
[1:19:16] expecting him every day
[1:19:20] [Music]
[1:19:22] right how many believe that not once a
[1:19:24] month not once a year every day you
[1:19:26] should say i'm expecting him to come i
[1:19:28] am living today like he's gonna burst
[1:19:30] through those cards for me anytime
[1:19:33] because when he does i am not going to
[1:19:35] be disappointed
[1:19:37] i'm going to be there ready and waiting
[1:19:39] for him
[1:19:41] because jesus said blessed are those
[1:19:43] that are found watching
[1:19:46] blessed are those that are ready when he
[1:19:48] comes watch therefore jesus said
[1:19:52] how many believes that
[1:19:54] watch
[1:19:56] oh therefore for you know now what hour
[1:19:59] the lord does come
[1:20:02] amen
[1:20:04] listen therefore be also ready for him
[1:20:06] such an hour as you think not the same
[1:20:07] man cometh who then is he wise and
[1:20:09] faithful servant whom his lord shall
[1:20:11] make him ruler over all his house to get
[1:20:13] them meet in due season
[1:20:16] blessed is that servant amen
[1:20:19] aren't you glad for that
[1:20:22] oh my
[1:20:24] praise be to god i'm thankful for that
[1:20:28] jesus
[1:20:30] um
[1:20:34] spoke more
[1:20:38] he brought the prophet to bring this to
[1:20:40] light
[1:20:41] amen
[1:20:46] but the jesus christ when he was fixing
[1:20:48] to go to calvary
[1:20:50] sure he told him told his children
[1:20:54] he says uh
[1:20:56] that you know the son of man must be
[1:20:58] betrayed fall into the hands of sinful
[1:21:00] men and so forth and to rise from the
[1:21:02] third day
[1:21:04] but look at all these chapters in
[1:21:05] matthew 24 and all these different
[1:21:07] things that learn the parable when the
[1:21:09] fig trees and all these other perils we
[1:21:11] spoke more about that second come
[1:21:13] because that's what's so important
[1:21:16] so after the opponent was made after
[1:21:19] amen he went to calvary and everything
[1:21:21] now the focal point is going to be that
[1:21:23] second coming
[1:21:26] i i i can't i can't hardly fathom how
[1:21:29] god does
[1:21:31] but it seems that god hides himself to
[1:21:33] the world he hides himself in such
[1:21:36] simplicity he hides himself in such
[1:21:38] humility that everybody's looking some
[1:21:40] great fantastic thing when god is in
[1:21:43] humility and simplicity
[1:21:45] right
[1:21:47] i mean folks he could how many know god
[1:21:48] could have the whole world on their
[1:21:50] knees
[1:21:53] he could create it in such a way or show
[1:21:55] himself in such a way until everybody
[1:21:56] just spend it all fall in their knees
[1:21:59] and say yeah your god
[1:22:01] but he don't want to do it that way he
[1:22:02] wants you to believe him though you
[1:22:04] can't see him
[1:22:06] but then on the other hand if they
[1:22:08] wanted to see him all they had to look
[1:22:10] at what he did in this generation
[1:22:12] world over seven times did miracle after
[1:22:14] miracle after miracle sign after sign
[1:22:18] to get the people to know that god
[1:22:19] really is real
[1:22:24] if this message
[1:22:26] doesn't make christ and god more real in
[1:22:29] your heart
[1:22:30] from day to day
[1:22:33] then it ain't the message fall it's not
[1:22:34] christ's fault it's your fault
[1:22:38] this ought to be a real reality to us
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:43] folks i'm building an addition trying to
[1:22:45] finish the edition on the house and so
[1:22:46] forth i've got earthly goals and things
[1:22:49] that i said that i want to do
[1:22:51] but
[1:22:52] i want to just testify when i turn my
[1:22:55] eyes on jesus look full in his wonderful
[1:22:57] faith then the thing that this earth did
[1:23:00] just grow strangely dim
[1:23:03] in the light of his glory and grace
[1:23:06] when i think about this house it'll
[1:23:08] probably be taken from me
[1:23:10] they'll probably you know
[1:23:12] do something like that you don't have no
[1:23:14] guarantee of keeping your property
[1:23:16] nah
[1:23:22] he got no hopes down here
[1:23:24] but when you think about
[1:23:26] what you got over there
[1:23:28] the less you think about this world and
[1:23:30] the more you think about what christ has
[1:23:32] in store for us the happier you'll be
[1:23:37] the less we focus on the things of this
[1:23:39] world the less i
[1:23:40] focus on the things to do more i feel
[1:23:42] because on the things of god the more
[1:23:44] joy you'll have
[1:23:47] we're not a downcast depressed
[1:23:50] sad forsaken
[1:23:52] doomed
[1:23:54] no that's not the believer that's the
[1:23:57] unbeliever
[1:23:58] they're sad they're glued they have no
[1:24:00] hope
[1:24:03] they have no control of it they have no
[1:24:05] joy
[1:24:06] they have no peace
[1:24:09] amen
[1:24:13] amen
[1:24:15] another place just comes to mind the
[1:24:17] prophet says you know you just watch it
[1:24:18] get worse and worse and worse you watch
[1:24:22] sin get worse and worse until the skies
[1:24:24] catch on fire
[1:24:27] amen no hope for this world
[1:24:30] praise be to god
[1:24:33] amen
[1:24:36] so we find brothers and sisters and i
[1:24:37] want to let's talk about this over here
[1:24:40] matthew 25
[1:24:46] we find another oil
[1:24:48] talking about oil
[1:24:49] i like talking about oil
[1:24:52] not the oil that russia wants
[1:24:54] or that the world wants
[1:25:00] but that the bride wants
[1:25:04] matthew 25
[1:25:06] after he talks about
[1:25:08] cutting the hip or quick
[1:25:09] with the portion of the hypocrites
[1:25:11] they'll be weeping and washing of teeth
[1:25:13] then shall the kingdom of heaven be like
[1:25:14] unto ten virgins who took their lamps
[1:25:17] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[1:25:21] and five of them were wise and five
[1:25:23] foolish they that were foolish took
[1:25:25] their lamps and took no oil in them
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:29] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:25:32] now notice it doesn't really talk about
[1:25:33] having it lit
[1:25:35] it just talked about they got that oil
[1:25:38] right
[1:25:39] and while the bridegroom tarried they
[1:25:41] all slumbered and slipped and at
[1:25:43] midnight there was a crime made behold
[1:25:45] the bridegroom cometh go ye out to me
[1:25:48] him
[1:25:49] i can't help but believe that there's a
[1:25:51] parallel between that and revelations
[1:25:53] where it says come out of her my people
[1:25:58] that you receive not of her plagues
[1:25:59] partake not of her sins
[1:26:02] come out of her
[1:26:04] come out come out to meet him
[1:26:07] remember the screaming of the prophet
[1:26:10] when he said that come out
[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:14] get out of there
[1:26:16] get out of that lukewarm church
[1:26:23] i never finished my story comes back to
[1:26:25] me but
[1:26:26] brother bam talked about the
[1:26:28] pentecostals i guess i did finish but
[1:26:30] talk about the pentecost and how
[1:26:31] deceiving it was it looked like the real
[1:26:33] thing
[1:26:35] it looked like that's what it was
[1:26:37] but the very people speaking in tongues
[1:26:39] and interpretation tongues and all the
[1:26:40] power to do what they did
[1:26:42] rejected christ and put him outside the
[1:26:44] door
[1:26:47] that's exactly
[1:26:48] right you go to brother branham's
[1:26:51] meetings and you watch christ discern
[1:26:52] the thoughts and the tense of the heart
[1:26:54] just like the messiah did with the woman
[1:26:55] at the well and we'll excommunicate you
[1:26:57] do you think that's going to go
[1:26:58] unpunished
[1:27:00] no
[1:27:02] what kind of bed are they going to get
[1:27:04] thrown in
[1:27:05] they're going to get throwed in a bed of
[1:27:07] death
[1:27:09] a bit of tribulation
[1:27:11] i will kill her with death
[1:27:14] they're dead
[1:27:16] oh my at midnight there was a crimea
[1:27:19] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[1:27:21] to meet him then all those virgins rose
[1:27:24] and trim their lamps how many believe
[1:27:27] that's what it's time for
[1:27:29] trim
[1:27:30] your lamps in other words let the light
[1:27:33] burn a little brighter
[1:27:35] how many with me this morning lord help
[1:27:38] me to let my light burn a little
[1:27:40] brighter
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:42] make sure all the dross is out of my
[1:27:44] life
[1:27:47] amen
[1:27:49] don't ask me why i'm preaching this ask
[1:27:51] the lord we must need it right
[1:27:57] i believe the lord speaks to us he
[1:28:00] brings us to these things for a purpose
[1:28:01] he does me
[1:28:04] amen
[1:28:05] all right
[1:28:07] so he says
[1:28:09] and they trim their lamps and the fully
[1:28:11] said unto the wise give us of your
[1:28:14] oil
[1:28:16] for our lamps are going out but the wise
[1:28:18] answer saying not so least there be not
[1:28:20] enough for us
[1:28:22] and you but go you rather to them that
[1:28:24] sell and buy for yourselves
[1:28:27] while they went to buy the bridegroom
[1:28:29] came and they that were ready
[1:28:31] hey man are you with me this morning
[1:28:34] those that were not getting ready they
[1:28:37] were ready
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:41] oh yeah are you ready should the master
[1:28:44] call today
[1:28:46] you don't make it home this afternoon
[1:28:49] are you ready
[1:28:50] yes
[1:28:52] amen
[1:28:54] and then that were ready went in with
[1:28:57] him to the marriage and the door was
[1:29:00] shut
[1:29:01] afterwards also came the virgins saying
[1:29:04] lord lord open unto us
[1:29:07] but he answered and said verily i say
[1:29:08] unto you i know
[1:29:10] you not
[1:29:14] huh
[1:29:16] let me see here
[1:29:19] isn't that the same word that he used
[1:29:21] over here
[1:29:24] yeah
[1:29:25] back in chapter
[1:29:27] 7
[1:29:29] after they said i prophesied in your
[1:29:31] name and all these then will i profess
[1:29:32] unto them
[1:29:34] i
[1:29:35] never
[1:29:36] knew you
[1:29:38] over here it says i know
[1:29:41] you
[1:29:41] not
[1:29:43] they did not have an everyday intimate
[1:29:46] relationship with jesus christ
[1:29:51] now let me ask you what happened here
[1:29:56] what happened here
[1:30:01] 15 8-9
[1:30:07] i'll tell you what happened here
[1:30:09] what happened here was john
[1:30:11] 10.
[1:30:13] john 10 he happened here
[1:30:24] and matthew 22
[1:30:37] all right verily verily i say unto you
[1:30:40] he that entereth not by the door
[1:30:44] into the sheepfold but climb it up some
[1:30:46] other way the same is a thief and a
[1:30:50] robber
[1:30:51] how many knots they had to try some
[1:30:54] other way
[1:31:01] in other words a substitutional way
[1:31:05] a way that they thought they could get
[1:31:07] in
[1:31:08] how many knows we got to watch that
[1:31:13] because the devil offers substitutes
[1:31:16] he's the one that is a copier
[1:31:18] he's an impersonator
[1:31:21] amen
[1:31:23] he looks like it but he isn't
[1:31:27] oh
[1:31:28] my remember not all that say lord lord
[1:31:31] shall come in and shall enter in
[1:31:34] so he climbed up some other way now i
[1:31:36] believe it's in matthew 22
[1:31:39] this is also
[1:31:41] them
[1:31:42] matthew 22
[1:31:49] 11-13
[1:31:52] go into the highways and hedges
[1:31:57] verse 9.
[1:31:59] good therefore into the highways in as
[1:32:01] many as you shall find bid to the
[1:32:02] marriage
[1:32:03] so those servants went out into the
[1:32:04] highways and gathered as many as they
[1:32:07] found both bad and good and wedding was
[1:32:08] furnished with guests
[1:32:10] and when the king came in to the guests
[1:32:12] he saw there a man which had not a
[1:32:15] wedding garment
[1:32:18] and he said unto them friend how came us
[1:32:20] down in hither not having a wedding
[1:32:22] garment
[1:32:24] oh my think about it trying to get some
[1:32:27] other way without having the dress of
[1:32:29] christ what's the dress of christ it's
[1:32:31] the blood of jesus christ washed in his
[1:32:33] blood amen having on the robe of his
[1:32:36] right
[1:32:39] but i'm here to tell you the church
[1:32:40] world today
[1:32:42] they think they can come some of their
[1:32:43] way
[1:32:45] they can wear their clothes they can be
[1:32:46] robed the way that they want to be robed
[1:32:48] and come in god says that's not going to
[1:32:50] happen
[1:32:52] he's going to be thrown out
[1:32:57] let's examine ourselves
[1:32:59] remember how many knows
[1:33:02] they don't think they have to come by
[1:33:03] way of malachi 4.
[1:33:06] luke 17 3 they don't come god says
[1:33:09] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[1:33:11] an oven
[1:33:12] and all the wickedly and all the power
[1:33:14] there shall be stubble under the soles
[1:33:15] of your feet
[1:33:16] but behold i send you lied to the
[1:33:18] prophet before the great and dreadful
[1:33:20] day of the lord what's he going to do
[1:33:23] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:33:25] the faith of the fathers
[1:33:28] but they don't accept that way no we
[1:33:30] ain't got to do that
[1:33:32] go ahead and try it
[1:33:35] go ahead and try you're going to be
[1:33:36] disappointed
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:40] amen
[1:33:42] some other way some substitutionary way
[1:33:46] amen
[1:33:47] this is what the prophet says what's the
[1:33:49] matter with people today what makes
[1:33:51] people drink and lying steal commit
[1:33:53] adultery and do they act the way they do
[1:33:55] it's not because they haven't got
[1:33:57] something to satisfy
[1:33:58] huh
[1:34:00] it's because that
[1:34:01] take a substitute instead of the real
[1:34:03] thing
[1:34:06] people don't want the real they don't
[1:34:08] want the truth
[1:34:11] even jesus says you know he says they
[1:34:14] love darkness rather than
[1:34:16] the world's got a love from people got a
[1:34:19] love problem
[1:34:21] like i said wednesday night love not the
[1:34:23] world nor the things of the world
[1:34:25] because if you love the world and the
[1:34:27] things of the world the love of god is
[1:34:29] not even in you
[1:34:34] and what is the love of the world what
[1:34:36] is the world the world is the lust of
[1:34:38] the flesh the lust of the eye and the
[1:34:40] pride of life
[1:34:42] if you love when you satisfy and you let
[1:34:44] your flesh do what it wants you remember
[1:34:46] you're not in love with god
[1:34:52] oh my
[1:34:55] how many believes that
[1:34:57] god ain't god ain't in your heart if you
[1:35:00] don't

[1:37:18] battles

[1:37:21] much you serve your flesh

[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:37] amen
[1:40:39] praise be to god
[1:40:41] another one
[1:40:43] and we'll start our message this morning
[1:40:46] luke 15
[1:40:47] luke 15.
[1:40:53] he says either white woman having 10
[1:40:55] pieces of silver
[1:40:57] if she lose one piece does not light a
[1:41:00] candle and sweep the house and seek
[1:41:02] diligently till she find it
[1:41:05] and when she has found it she called her
[1:41:08] friends and her neighbors together and
[1:41:09] reached saying rejoice with me
[1:41:12] for i have found
[1:41:14] the peace which i had
[1:41:16] lost now i didn't know the true meaning
[1:41:19] of this but i have a lot of confidence
[1:41:20] in our prophet don't you
[1:41:22] and brother branham reads this very
[1:41:24] scripture
[1:41:25] about having this woman with 10 pieces
[1:41:27] of silver
[1:41:28] he says now it may seem like an odd
[1:41:30] strange scripture for the second coming
[1:41:32] of christ
[1:41:33] it's speaking of his second coming and
[1:41:35] this great subject that we have here
[1:41:37] before us is the one of the most vital
[1:41:39] subject of the entire holy writ
[1:41:42] there's nothing more important
[1:41:44] as the coming of the lord jesus
[1:41:46] how do you believe that
[1:41:48] well by the way you preach i'm taking up
[1:41:50] and all so much
[1:41:52] yeah we all preach it every sunday
[1:41:55] why because it's shaking up time not
[1:41:57] just every hour the prophet said but
[1:41:59] every minute of every hour it's checking
[1:42:01] up time
[1:42:03] every minute you should be asking
[1:42:05] yourself am i ready am i ready am i
[1:42:07] ready am i ready am i ready
[1:42:10] you should ask how many please you gotta
[1:42:11] ask ourselves that question a lot you
[1:42:14] wouldn't have to worry about the pastor
[1:42:15] getting on to you you come to church and
[1:42:17] say that's right protobot that's what
[1:42:19] i've been doing praise be to god
[1:42:21] hallelujah instead of hold me
[1:42:24] boy i better straighten up
[1:42:26] huh i like that you're nodding the
[1:42:29] that's nice
[1:42:31] amen because that's the truth isn't it
[1:42:35] vital subject
[1:42:37] oh my
[1:42:42] listen
[1:42:43] in the old testament there was many more
[1:42:45] scriptures in the old testament
[1:42:46] pertaining to the second coming of
[1:42:47] christ even then there is in the first
[1:42:49] coming everything the human race now
[1:42:52] after atonement was made rest solemnly
[1:42:54] upon the second coming of christ now
[1:42:57] talking about this woman the way he puts
[1:42:58] it he says in those days they didn't
[1:43:00] have wedding rings
[1:43:02] they had a tablet
[1:43:05] and they put that on their head all
[1:43:07] right
[1:43:07] and it had ten coins and then it went
[1:43:10] around her head and that was a sign that
[1:43:12] they were a married woman and no man was
[1:43:15] a fool with them
[1:43:16] no boys wants to flirt with them they
[1:43:18] were married
[1:43:20] hallelujah how many believe that's what
[1:43:22] you are to christ this morning you're
[1:43:24] married to christ
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:26] and christ doesn't want you flirting
[1:43:29] with the world
[1:43:31] he don't want you to flirt with anything
[1:43:33] else but him
[1:43:36] he wants you to have your love to no
[1:43:38] other man and no other thing but him
[1:43:41] i believe that's what he's telling us
[1:43:43] this morning
[1:43:44] amen
[1:43:46] praise the lord and each coin meant a
[1:43:49] certain virtue for that woman the first
[1:43:52] meeting her love for her husband love
[1:43:54] second pledge to virtue and live clean
[1:43:56] for him the third and the fourth and the
[1:43:58] fifth and so forth he didn't go through
[1:43:59] all of them
[1:44:00] if you want to look it up in galatians 5
[1:44:02] you'll find that that woman represented
[1:44:04] the church the churches and his spouse
[1:44:07] wife to christ and the tablet that the
[1:44:09] church is supposed to wear
[1:44:11] is found in galatians 5 which is joy and
[1:44:14] peace long serving goodness meekness
[1:44:15] gentle pain
[1:44:17] that is the tablet that's supposed to be
[1:44:18] worn by the church by the love kindness
[1:44:21] and fellowship and this
[1:44:23] woman it must have been along about dark
[1:44:26] and she realized that she had lost one
[1:44:28] of these coins
[1:44:30] and oh if there was ever a time the
[1:44:31] church ought to take inventory to find
[1:44:34] out if you've got all the cards on
[1:44:39] how many bleeds i believe this morning
[1:44:41] it's time to look
[1:44:44] huh
[1:44:46] time to check make sure that you've got
[1:44:48] all the fruits of the spirit
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:53] amen
[1:44:56] you see before jesus said that about
[1:44:58] many will come to me and say in that day
[1:45:00] haven't we done this out of the other he
[1:45:01] says a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[1:45:04] fruit neither can a trump tree bring
[1:45:05] forth eat good fruit
[1:45:07] every tree that bringeth forth thy good
[1:45:09] fruit is tuned down and cast into the
[1:45:10] fire wherefore by their fruits you shall
[1:45:14] know them
[1:45:16] i want to rephrase it and give it
[1:45:18] another scripture by your fruits you
[1:45:20] will know yourself
[1:45:23] that's why jesus paul said judge
[1:45:25] yourselves because if you would judge
[1:45:28] yourselves you would not be judged
[1:45:31] why why would you not be judged because
[1:45:33] you would judge yourself you would
[1:45:36] repent make it right before god and god
[1:45:38] wouldn't have to look the tire out of
[1:45:40] you
[1:45:41] to get your attention to let you know
[1:45:43] you're doing wrong
[1:45:46] but if you don't judge yourself
[1:45:48] at you he says that's good because to be
[1:45:51] good just of god to be punished or
[1:45:53] chastised he said but god is good
[1:45:55] because at least that way you are coming
[1:45:58] with the world
[1:46:02] oh how many smarties in the interested
[1:46:05] in not being condemned in the
[1:46:07] tribulation period with the world

[1:46:14] world that's why i come to church this
[1:46:16] morning not to have pitchfork religion
[1:46:18] and see how everybody else copes up with
[1:46:20] the word but to see how i look compared

[1:54:45] ministers today are having such a hard
[1:54:47] time getting people out for friends
[1:54:49] tonight prayer meeting
[1:54:53] amen they love television programs
[1:54:56] they love amusements
[1:54:59] they're too busy to come to church

[1:55:07] they don't want to come to church on
[1:55:08] sunday many of them they tell me the
[1:55:10] ministers and the church pews are empty
[1:55:15] let me get a
[1:55:16] some kind of a quartet even in the
[1:55:18] gospel quartet or anything entertaining
[1:55:22] and the locals and people fill this
[1:55:24] place up probably wouldn't they
[1:55:26] but you preach the gospel and you get
[1:55:28] people examining themselves and having
[1:55:30] to look at themselves and
[1:55:32] they're not going to come
[1:55:35] they don't want to do that
[1:55:38] listen
[1:55:39] the world offers them so much other
[1:55:42] things
[1:55:43] tensile things of the world and people
[1:55:45] fall for that that shows that at the
[1:55:48] beginning you didn't have nothing to
[1:55:50] start with
[1:55:58] thank you better joe

[1:56:18] didn't really want to go to church but
[1:56:20] it was because i was backslid but the
[1:56:22] one thing for sure is i can't stay that
[1:56:25] way
[1:56:28] if you have something to start with you
[1:56:31] will not stay that way

[1:56:42] climb the roof or the church to get it

[1:56:45] hold of god and you'll get right with

[1:57:03] around and giving glorifying god and
[1:57:05] magnifying god
[1:57:08] nothing will make you feel better
[1:57:11] people want to feel good come to church
