[38:47] worthy to be compared with the glory
[38:50] which shall be revealed in us for the
[38:53] earnest expectation of the creature
[38:55] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[38:58] sons of God may God add His blessings to

[39:12] ourselves also which have the first
[39:13] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves

[39:19] adoption to wit the Redemption of our
[39:21] body amen that's sounding better here

[39:27] Amen to with the Redemption of our body
[39:29] amen this evening we want to once again
[39:31] speak on Amen the Chris and I believe I
[39:37] uh called this
[39:40] amen
[39:44] um amen fighting for every inch fighting
[39:48] for every
[39:50] inch amen I like that you know I mean
[39:53] you talk about not just a mile but for
[39:57] every inch amen fighting for every inch
[40:00] now I read this here because amen we
[40:03] talked amen of course Sunday about how
[40:06] that we're heirs Heirs of God Amen and
[40:09] that everything that belongs to Christ
[40:13] belongs to us also a that right so every
[40:16] promise in the book Is Ours amen amen
[40:19] everything Paul said it all belongs to
[40:21] you is that right whether Life Death no
[40:24] matter what it is amen it's all yours
[40:28] amen and we like that because of Amen
[40:30] especially where it says that everything
[40:32] it's all ours you know and when we say
[40:34] well it's mine you know we are talking
[40:37] about us as the bride is't that right
[40:40] it's ours it's all belongs to God's
[40:43] Church God's people that he has redeemed
[40:46] amen that he's done a work of redemption
[40:48] in amen amen so I want to go into
[40:51] category and into Direction a little bit
[40:54] about once you become a son once once
[40:56] you are a son amen what God does with
[40:59] you after that amen isn't that right
[41:02] amen where you go from there and how
[41:04] heyen we're going to go about trying to
[41:07] uh am mean get some of these promises
[41:09] that God has had now you know because
[41:12] it's actually a process amen it's
[41:15] something you know just like just like
[41:17] it was with the children of Israel he
[41:19] said the land is yours let us go up and
[41:21] possess it go up and possess it a't that
[41:23] right amen and so we find out they would
[41:26] fight one battle after the other amen
[41:29] first the walls of Jericho then the
[41:31] children of AI I believe it was and then
[41:33] on and on and on from one battle to the
[41:36] other to the other to the other amen
[41:40] amen there was a process it was a
[41:42] process and as you think about that
[41:45] process you know uh I want to first of
[41:47] all talk about you know because we know
[41:51] that the word of God how many knows the
[41:53] word doesn't need uh doesn't need any uh
[41:57] Reformation not Reformation but um what
[42:00] do you want to call it restoration amen
[42:03] or bringing back I want to talk first a
[42:04] little bit with the help of the Lord
[42:06] about talking about how that things
[42:09] always evolve amen things evolve brother
[42:13] bam said when he he he talked about
[42:15] Evolution and he says I believe in
[42:16] evolution not in the way that man
[42:19] teaches it about you know going from one
[42:21] species to the other but he talked about
[42:24] you know when God begin to create things
[42:26] and the the pot as the calcium and be
[42:28] begin to brood over the Earth and how
[42:31] began with the jellyfish and and then he
[42:33] went to the frog or Tad pulled and on
[42:36] down and on up I mean until he become
[42:39] until he come all the way to humanity
[42:41] now he also explain serpent seed in
[42:44] there amen and me and talking about how
[42:47] that science and different ones have
[42:48] been digging and
[42:50] trying to find what they call the
[42:53] missing link is that right and but
[42:56] clearly tells us what that Missing Link
[42:58] was was that serpent that was the only
[43:00] link between the chimpanzee and Humanity
[43:03] that they lost that they just couldn't
[43:05] TI together amen because animal blood
[43:08] and so forth it won't mix with human
[43:09] blood but there was one animal one Beast
[43:12] amen that actually could that Beast was
[43:14] that serpent is that right now this
[43:16] Beast was the most sub the Beast that
[43:18] serpent was the most sub Beast amen of
[43:21] the field and it would actually mix and
[43:23] so you know we find out that they even
[43:25] and all of that that he was cursed down
[43:27] to be a snake amen so far that they
[43:29] can't never find it but he talked about
[43:31] the evolution of creation the next is of
[43:34] course the evolution of humanity amen
[43:37] evolving amen or or and I look what that
[43:40] evolving means talk about am me it means
[43:42] changing from one to another or
[43:45] progressing basically progression amen
[43:48] or change amen and we know that Humanity
[43:51] has evolved as far as knowledge is
[43:54] concerned isin't that right and then we
[43:56] went all the way from the horse and
[43:57] buggy Age and and so forth all the way
[44:00] up into the space age and we have
[44:03] certainly amen gone uh well we've gotten
[44:06] gotten tapped so much into the world of
[44:09] knowledge and and thank so much that we
[44:12] have the power to destroy the world many
[44:16] times over the prophet of God said to
[44:18] where there wouldn't even be one blade
[44:21] grass
[44:24] anywhere that's the evolution of mankind
[44:27] but I already also wrote in here but you
[44:29] know we've also devolved when it comes
[44:32] to morality and our mind and so forth
[44:35] boy we have really devolved amen even
[44:38] though we have evolved so to speak in
[44:40] science and knowledge and so forth
[44:42] Humanity as a whole brother bam says you
[44:44] know we go up so high and then they flip
[44:46] over amen mean it all it all has to do
[44:50] with uh in the cycle of death amen
[44:53] because you know and I'll tell you what
[44:56] you know I won't go down there but we
[44:58] know that man even Christians a lot of
[45:01] times he'll uh allow pride and different
[45:04] things you know to come in and then
[45:06] Pride always comes before a downfall we
[45:09] look at the church ages and look at the
[45:10] churches and the way that they have went
[45:12] especially the Pentecostals and the
[45:14] different ones you know they came up so
[45:16] far and they wouldn't go on they
[45:18] wouldn't keep evolving so to speak in
[45:20] God ain't that right amen but they
[45:23] become stagnant somewhere and they died
[45:25] right there they quit growing quit
[45:28] growing on but the bride of Christ amen
[45:31] we are amen so to speak evolving so to
[45:34] speak from what we are amen amen into
[45:37] something greater and greater and
[45:38] greater and greater amen so look here we
[45:43] see a nature now one one thing about
[45:46] brother bam says that nature itself amen
[45:48] you take the trees you take the birds
[45:50] and he says you know the birds they
[45:52] still make their nests the same way as
[45:54] they always did all of nature doesn't
[45:56] evolve they don't change you might say
[45:59] well you know a a a deer or an animal
[46:03] would get smarter and smarter you know
[46:05] they're limited I don't care how big a
[46:07] bucket is I don't care how smart the
[46:09] animal is they're limited and we can
[46:11] outsmart them at any time at any place
[46:15] amen why because we can check their
[46:17] nature and and study their nature and
[46:20] they have they're they're limited they
[46:21] they're just they got what God gave them
[46:23] amen and sure they may adjust they may
[46:26] do this that or the other but they go
[46:28] all to the limitations of what God has
[46:30] given like brother baham said though the
[46:31] birds man they still make their nest the
[46:33] same they do it year after year after
[46:35] year amen it's handed down their
[46:37] children their children their children
[46:39] their children their children you would
[46:41] think that they would get smarter and do
[46:42] it better and better and better and
[46:43] better but they don't humanity is the
[46:45] only one amen that does that that gets
[46:48] does better and greater and greater and
[46:50] greater and greater amen and it shows
[46:52] the prophet of God said that we have
[46:53] fallen from something we've come from a
[46:57] fallen State and we're driving back and
[46:59] then we're actually striving for
[47:01] Perfection we want to do it better get
[47:02] it you know do it better and so forth
[47:04] and and I don't know about you but I I
[47:06] I'm glad to live in the age that I live
[47:09] in amen it used to be you know we had a
[47:12] gravel parking lot out there right now
[47:14] it's nice to have payment is it right
[47:16] well we know that 6880 at one point in
[47:18] time it was money to go up and down 60
[47:20] 8080 and they drive horse and Buggies no
[47:23] doubt years ago amen up and down the
[47:25] road all they had flinging mud well now
[47:29] we get to oh
[47:31] my now we get to drive in nice fancy
[47:34] cars nice cars and cruise on I don't
[47:36] know about you but when I'm driving down
[47:37] that black top Road I'm says thank you
[47:38] Lord I can drive on this vehicle on
[47:40] Black Top Road you know I don't have to
[47:42] be out
[47:43] there amen I'm gonna I'm going to stop
[47:45] here for a minute and I want to give God
[47:47] a glory and testimony but me and my wife
[47:50] we was about this close and me to go to
[47:53] the hospital
[47:54] tonight
[47:56] I mean it's it's just God that we're
[47:58] here not in the hospital cuz we coming
[47:59] to church and and uh 106 out there where
[48:03] sometimes that water goes across the
[48:05] road you know that curve and and you go
[48:07] up that road well we was coming from the
[48:08] other side down and we was traveling 55
[48:11] pretty much and we come around that
[48:12] curve and here a car was coming at us
[48:15] and she we all the way over in our
[48:17] lane and boy I slammed on brakes but we
[48:20] was going to hit each other head on and
[48:23] I just and there was a rock wall over on
[48:25] the right and a ditch and I I knew he
[48:27] was going to hit the rock wall or
[48:29] something I did not expect us to get out
[48:31] of it something was going to happen and
[48:34] I pulled over as far as I could not to
[48:36] hit him and I went into ditch and I knew
[48:37] it would hit axle and everything and
[48:39] probably just pull me in but the Lord
[48:41] help us there was just enough gravel
[48:44] there there was just enough gravel there
[48:47] God help us amen and we pulled all the
[48:50] way over they pulled over just far
[48:52] enough to give me my half of the ditch
[48:55] and it pulled back up and it pulled back
[48:57] out but it was very close to head on
[49:00] Amen so I thank the Lord amen how many
[49:03] believes that God watches out for us
[49:05] that's the closest to a wreck amen that
[49:07] I that I've been in a while amen amen I
[49:10] I know Jess been in a wck and amen and
[49:13] so I thought I might have to get me a
[49:15] new truck but
[49:18] anyway no I I did not think that we
[49:21] would come out of it without hitting the
[49:23] wall or something bad happened because
[49:25] that was a big ditch amen but by God's
[49:27] grace there was just enough gravel there
[49:29] to hold that thing and bring us back out
[49:32] and uh we tried to catch them to find
[49:35] out you know because I thought maybe
[49:36] there was some damage done in my truck
[49:38] because of it but they were long
[49:42] gone amen all right I figured it was
[49:45] probably texting or something amen all
[49:49] right praise the Lord so we think about
[49:50] it brothers and sisters I just I thank
[49:52] God Amen all right so now notice we talk
[49:56] about that the message amen talk about
[49:58] Christian and in Christianity next next
[50:01] thing that we look at as far as uh
[50:04] Evolution even Christianity has evolved
[50:07] hasn't
[50:10] it
[50:12] Christianity has
[50:14] evolved that's right Luther
[50:17] justification Wesley
[50:20] sanctification Pentecost the baptism of
[50:22] the Holy Ghost isin that right m and
[50:25] isusa Street it looked like the real
[50:28] thing like the original Pentecost like
[50:30] and it was Pentecost I mean as it was
[50:33] the work of the Holy Ghost that all be a
[50:35] whole group of people there and then
[50:38] they come out of that Pentecostal system
[50:40] and so forth Pentecost amen that'll be
[50:42] saved they're laid away and they'll be
[50:44] over in glory but we know that they
[50:46] denominated just like the others did and
[50:49] that right am man denominated and they
[50:52] begin to say that speaking in tongues is
[50:55] the the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen
[50:57] and but says you know the Holy Ghost the
[51:00] gift of the Holy Ghost made way for
[51:03] something isn't that right for the Holy
[51:05] Ghost himself I mean know so The Giver
[51:08] of all those gifts and Tong all of a
[51:10] sudden The Giver of those gifts shows up
[51:14] through Malachi 4 Ain that right the
[51:17] very one that gives them and he speaks
[51:19] to him begin to earn Des earn the
[51:21] thoughts of the heart and I think we had
[51:23] it here uh up here it says something
[51:25] about you know these things haven't been
[51:27] done for since Paul's age some of these
[51:29] things haven't been done till then and
[51:32] here God is again bringing the perfect
[51:35] how many not a perfect word for bride
[51:39] that's going to come to
[51:41] Perfection so it has evolved
[51:44] Christianity has evolved we have to
[51:47] evolve and let me say our Revelation and
[51:50] understanding of the word has
[51:54] evolved
[51:57] now I put it that way because I can't
[51:59] say that the word
[52:02] involved because that's not
[52:04] true the word never has to
[52:08] evolve it never has to
[52:11] change in other words we have such the
[52:14] word is so complete until he wrote in
[52:17] there if anybody adds to or takes away
[52:20] his heart will be taken out of the book
[52:22] of
[52:23] life even better B one play said that it
[52:25] was like having a complete body all five
[52:28] fingers and then you add something to it
[52:30] well you're going to have six fingers or
[52:32] six toes or two heads or something like
[52:36] that amen so you can't add to the word
[52:39] of God the go word of God does not need
[52:42] Evolution it don't need to progress it
[52:45] don't need to be the only thing that we
[52:47] need as Believers is to understand what
[52:51] that word really
[52:54] is cuz that word to butter bam says you
[52:57] know real genuine faith is an atomic
[53:02] bomb huh you don't need anything greater
[53:06] than atomic bomb it doesn't get any
[53:08] bigger butam says where was it I don't
[53:11] know which maybe might have been in the
[53:14] greatest battle ever fought he might
[53:15] have talked about you know a Gatlin gun
[53:17] or a muzzle loader or a pistol you know
[53:20] or a a person bringing a knife to a
[53:23] gunfight can you imagine last
[53:25] guy with I don't care if you got a
[53:27] machete if I got my glock 16 or 20 or
[53:29] whatever it is I'm not going to be
[53:31] worried about your machete unless you
[53:33] can throw it real
[53:35] good huh and that's how it is the
[53:38] devil's little old knife can never
[53:41] compare to God's
[53:44] word that real genuine faith if we can
[53:47] back get back our understanding to the
[53:49] word of God isin that right then we'll
[53:52] have the same it'll have the same effect
[53:54] that it always did
[53:59] amen and that's what we're working
[54:03] towards we're evolving I believe we're
[54:06] evolving so much until one of these days
[54:08] we're kind
[54:10] of let me just say this
[54:13] way brother bam said that there was
[54:15] rapturing faith in the
[54:18] message now I want to say something can
[54:21] I add a little something to
[54:22] that oh you got I got your attention
[54:26] now if there's rapturing faith in that
[54:29] message then there is rapturing
[54:32] preparation in that message ain't that
[54:35] right because if you're going to go in a
[54:36] Rapture you're going to have to be ready
[54:38] for that
[54:39] Rapture how many believes it's the
[54:41] clothing this this message is the dress
[54:44] that we're putting
[54:45] on we are putting these things on we're
[54:48] putting on faith putting on virtue
[54:50] putting on knowledge putting on
[54:52] Temperance putting on patience putting
[54:54] on God godl putting on brotherly
[54:56] kindness putting on the Holy Ghost and
[54:58] putting on perfect
[55:00] love ain't that right we got to have
[55:02] those things you got to be dressed we're
[55:04] dress we're getting dressed we are
[55:06] dressing to meet
[55:09] him and if there's rapturing Faith then
[55:12] there's also things in the message
[55:13] that's going to have you
[55:16] ready aren't you glad for that it's
[55:19] bringing us higher it's much higher than
[55:21] the age before us
[55:24] was
[55:26] and that is what God is working on now
[55:28] when you become the Son of God Amen so
[55:31] now notice here now he says if we're uh
[55:34] if if we're children then heirs Heirs of
[55:37] God and notice how the expectation of
[55:40] the creature waited for the
[55:41] manifestation I'm moving it down a
[55:43] little bit amen wait is for the
[55:45] manifestation of the sons of God the
[55:48] whole world is
[55:50] looking for the sons of God to be
[55:54] manifested
[55:59] amen let me just say this that I believe
[56:02] that the prophet of God said that there
[56:03] in the end time that there would be the
[56:05] Son of God there would be a sheath wave
[56:08] waved over the
[56:09] people is that right sheave wave waved
[56:13] over the
[56:15] people amen and what that sheave wave
[56:17] was is usually back in the old days in
[56:19] the uh in the Old Testament whenever or
[56:23] something like that would be coming to
[56:24] maturity they would take a sheath isn't
[56:26] that right amen it was fully matured and
[56:29] they'll bring it in and they'd wave it
[56:31] around say hey this is the first fruits
[56:33] that's come to
[56:34] maturity
[56:36] amen when I think about the prophet of
[56:39] God how I believe that amen if the whole
[56:41] world is waiting for the manifestations
[56:43] of the sons of God a person to come to
[56:46] maturity tell me who who better
[56:48] exemplify that than the prophet of
[56:50] [Music]
[56:52] God and if he if he came to maturity
[56:56] what about the message said he preached
[56:58] what about his
[57:01] [Laughter]
[57:02] followers oh you're one of them brand
[57:05] followers you better believe
[57:08] it yeah D ain't ashamed a bit to tell
[57:11] you I'm a follower of a brother
[57:14] Brandon am mean no more than i' would
[57:16] have been ashamed when Paul said follow
[57:18] me as I follow Christ if I didn't in
[57:20] Paul day I said I'm a Paul follower I
[57:23] follow Paul because He follows Christ
[57:29] am that's
[57:33] right
[57:38] amen oh
[57:40] my so let's get started shall
[57:44] we
[57:46] now if you'll notice in
[57:52] Galatians we're going to take off now
[57:54] from the back back side of the desert
[57:56] you become a Son of God now you're an
[57:59] air everything belongs to
[58:02] you
[58:04] but there's a butt but yeah what in the
[58:09] world what why do we have to hear things
[58:12] like
[58:13] this brother blam says every promise in
[58:17] the book of The Great Shepherd is to his
[58:19] sheep but I didn't even realize that was
[58:23] in there but he said but
[58:25] but brother he will never come down and
[58:28] just drive it all away from you you got
[58:30] to fight for every inch of that
[58:34] promise but it's yours it belongs to you
[58:37] just like God he told Israel way down
[58:39] there in Egypt I've given you Palestine
[58:42] now he could have just went in there and
[58:44] run them all out of there with a plague
[58:46] kill them all
[58:49] off he could have went up there sent
[58:51] fear among them and drove them all out
[58:53] of the country he said Israel and it's
[58:54] yours you go get it but they had to
[58:57] fight for every inch of ground that they
[59:00] stood
[59:01] on how many knows it oh boy we're going

[1:00:16] for the Holy Ghost once

[1:00:21] slobbering and spitting and yelling and
[1:00:24] screaming and I enjoy it Amen brother R

[1:00:50] faith the preacher spits on you just
[1:00:52] claim your healing I'm Healed
[1:00:55] wouldn't be that far out the
[1:00:58] line that's a new one never know what
[1:01:02] the Holy Ghost gonna say do
[1:01:04] you all
[1:01:08] right you love the
[1:01:11] Lord amen God is
[1:01:15] good so we have to try to look at this
[1:01:19] but brother you have to
[1:01:21] fight amen he told Joshua every place
[1:01:24] the sole of your feet Treads that I have
[1:01:27] given you Footprints means
[1:01:32] Victory you know you've heard the phrase
[1:01:34] be careful what you ask for we're going
[1:01:37] to address that a little bit tonight if
[1:01:39] that's all right let's first of all look
[1:01:41] at something here that just because
[1:01:44] you're a son doesn't mean you're an
[1:01:48] heir whoa now that's
[1:01:51] different I mean if you're an adopted
[1:01:54] son
[1:01:55] yeah but you got to come to adoption
[1:01:59] don't worry I got it I got it right
[1:02:01] here notice in Galatians it says for ye
[1:02:04] are all the children of God by faith in
[1:02:08] Jesus Christ for as many of you as have
[1:02:11] been baptized into Christ have put on
[1:02:13] Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek
[1:02:17] there is neither Bond nor free neither
[1:02:19] male nor female you are all one in
[1:02:21] Christ Jesus and if you are Christ then
[1:02:23] you are able Abraham's seed and hirs
[1:02:26] according to the promise now I say that
[1:02:30] the heir as long as he is a child differ
[1:02:34] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[1:02:37] of
[1:02:38] all W so if you're going to be a Son of
[1:02:41] God and you're just going to stay a baby
[1:02:44] God will never be able to trust you with
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:47] checkbook you can't stay a spiritual
[1:02:50] baby right you've got to go through
[1:02:53] something things and you got to prove
[1:02:55] yourself a Son of God before God hands
[1:02:58] you that kind of
[1:03:01] authority you got to go through a
[1:03:03] process you got to
[1:03:06] evolve man you can't St in the same
[1:03:11] place you got to keep growing keep
[1:03:14] growing keep
[1:03:17] growing I'm going to challenge your
[1:03:19] faith
[1:03:21] tonight
[1:03:23] amen though he be Lord of all but is
[1:03:25] under tutors and governors till the time
[1:03:28] appointed of the
[1:03:31] father amen
[1:03:33] my praise the
[1:03:36] Lord all right now we're going to stop
[1:03:38] there and we're g to address this here
[1:03:40] in a minute let me just tell
[1:03:44] you brother Braham says now remember
[1:03:46] when a man is saved this much I don't
[1:03:49] know like this button here I don't have
[1:03:52] any buttons button here becomes eternal
[1:03:56] life in your heart that's God and as
[1:03:59] you're able to push out all the roots of
[1:04:02] bitterness then God begins to spread in
[1:04:04] you then you become a Son of God whoa
[1:04:09] how many knows it's about becoming a Son
[1:04:11] of
[1:04:14] God for whom he did predestinate them he
[1:04:18] them who he forew he also did
[1:04:21] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:04:23] image
[1:04:25] of his son that he might be the
[1:04:27] firstborn among many
[1:04:30] Brethren how many believes that the
[1:04:32] Bible wants Sons and Daughters of God to
[1:04:36] be like
[1:04:40] him it just comes to mind remember God
[1:04:43] had wanted a family of his own church
[1:04:44] age book amen and now God will train
[1:04:47] them to be conformed to the image of his
[1:04:49] son sometimes he'll have to take that
[1:04:51] son and thoroughly break him down again
[1:04:55] huh if God don't if you oh my I don't
[1:04:59] want to say if God don't get it right
[1:05:01] the first time you'll do it again but if
[1:05:03] you're stubborn and you are you've got
[1:05:06] ways that God don't like he may have to
[1:05:08] put you on your back he may have to I
[1:05:10] don't know what all God is going to have
[1:05:11] to do but sometimes he has to completely
[1:05:13] break us down right completely take us
[1:05:17] back to The Potter's House we're gonna
[1:05:19] start this over
[1:05:21] again I don't know about you but we've
[1:05:23] all had probably another start a new
[1:05:25] start God I need another start I need a
[1:05:28] refreshing I need a
[1:05:31] refilling
[1:05:32] amen oh my that's right see a man was
[1:05:37] made to be a god did you know that he is
[1:05:39] in the image of God he's the son of God
[1:05:41] he's like him amen oh my here he is
[1:05:45] among the church today made flesh in
[1:05:48] this church certainly Elohim oh now if
[1:05:51] you could only realize that you men you
[1:05:53] were made to to be an amateur God you're
[1:05:56] a Son of God you're an heir of God you
[1:05:58] have a domain how many believe
[1:06:01] that oh
[1:06:03] my you have a been given the domain he's
[1:06:06] a king God and where he got his fall he
[1:06:10] could speak amen where he got his fall
[1:06:13] he could speak to the trees be changed
[1:06:15] be plucked up move over here the winds
[1:06:18] would obey be still and it stopped he's

[1:06:32] person that could speak things into
[1:06:36] existence speak squirrels into existence

[1:06:43] bull and he'll go back and lay
[1:06:48] down amen can we say that isn't just
[1:06:52] meant for him
[1:06:54] that's meant for every Son of God every
[1:06:57] daughter of

[1:09:33] and say preach is more brother we're
[1:09:36] just getting
[1:09:37] started create an atmosphere how many

[1:09:47] you people should want to sit at your
[1:09:49] table I want to go sit by this guy I
[1:09:52] want to sit by this person
[1:09:54] person man they got such good things to
[1:09:56] say some positive things to
[1:10:02] say I might as well say
[1:10:04] it not so long ago I sat around some
[1:10:08] preachers sat down sat around some
[1:10:10] preachers man all we could talk about
[1:10:12] all all people begin to talk about is
[1:10:14] the questionable stuff and the things
[1:10:16] around the message I'm like I don't
[1:10:17] really want to go
[1:10:19] there
[1:10:21] huh I don't want to talk about all these
[1:10:23] other stuff let's talk about something
[1:10:24] positive let's say where the bride is
[1:10:26] going here see we talk about what the
[1:10:28] God is
[1:10:29] doing amen the Revival that's certain
[1:10:32] among God's
[1:10:34] people the work that the holy spirit is
[1:10:37] doing in our young people and our older
[1:10:39] people let our middleaged people talk
[1:10:42] about something positive not
[1:10:47] negative
[1:10:50] amen oh
[1:10:52] my praise is the
[1:10:54] Lord that's
[1:11:01] right
[1:11:03] so that's the beginning when you get
[1:11:06] born
[1:11:07] again you got about that much of
[1:11:10] God about that much wow that's not a
[1:11:14] whole
[1:11:21] lot sometime ago the critics said that
[1:11:24] God certainly made a mistake when he
[1:11:26] said as a man thinketh in his heart so
[1:11:28] is he but later they found out that God
[1:11:31] was right they said the man had no
[1:11:33] mental faculties in his heart and that
[1:11:35] perhaps God meant in his head but God
[1:11:38] doesn't make
[1:11:40] mistakes how many glad oh he don't make
[1:11:45] mistakes when he said his heart he meant
[1:11:47] his
[1:11:48] heart just like he does with all the
[1:11:50] other statements and they are perfect
[1:11:52] and they need no TR ations they're just
[1:11:55] the way God said them amen not another
[1:11:58] age not another time but whosoever with
[1:12:00] all times for God's word is perfect it's
[1:12:03] Everlasting Eternal as he is eternal how
[1:12:07] many believe that God's word am me this
[1:12:10] word is so
[1:12:12] perfect and when Luther could just get a
[1:12:14] revelation that the just shall live by
[1:12:17] faith I don't have to pay for this I
[1:12:19] don't have to pay for that there's no
[1:12:21] Indulgence and all of that other mess in
[1:12:23] here
[1:12:24] he got a revelation of it that's what we
[1:12:26] need more of I'm here to completely I'm
[1:12:28] here to tell you by the time we realize
[1:12:30] that we're the children of Abraham amen
[1:12:32] we've got the faith of Abraham he CAU
[1:12:35] those things as though that were not as
[1:12:37] though they were who again so believed
[1:12:39] and hoped that's
[1:12:42] right oh this bride is going to have the
[1:12:45] faith of Abraham we're going to call
[1:12:47] things that aren't as though they
[1:12:50] are how many believe that you got a body
[1:12:53] ch change coming I believe his body's
[1:12:55] going to change I don't care how it
[1:12:57] looks brother Glenn your hair is going
[1:12:59] to turn they're going to come back first
[1:13:01] and then they're going to turn
[1:13:05] back how many glad they're going to come
[1:13:09] back then they going to turn back we
[1:13:13] believe that with all of our heart it
[1:13:15] don't matter how much time goes by if
[1:13:18] you got the faith of Abraham that's how
[1:13:20] it's gonna be that's the kind of belief
[1:13:22] that you have
[1:13:26] amen why because God put something down
[1:13:29] in
[1:13:30] here let's finish our story so about
[1:13:33] four years ago up in Chicago I was
[1:13:35] reading a great headline in a paper
[1:13:36] where the Medical Science had found a
[1:13:39] little compartment in the heart of the
[1:13:41] human being that did did not even have a
[1:13:43] cell in it and it is not found in the
[1:13:46] animal life it's only found in the human
[1:13:49] body the human heart and they said it
[1:13:53] must must be the dwelling place of the
[1:13:56] Soul Glory how many believe that that's
[1:13:59] he got a soul down on the inside of the
[1:14:02] inside oh my so then man does think with
[1:14:05] his heart you look with your eyes but
[1:14:07] you understand with your heart see when
[1:14:10] God made man he made him thus he made
[1:14:14] him this little certain compartment in
[1:14:16] the man for his own Throne his control
[1:14:22] tower wants to lead man and I want to
[1:14:25] finish with
[1:14:26] that tonight about
[1:14:31] 12:30 oh my that's right listen he wants
[1:14:35] to lead man but man wants to lead
[1:14:37] himself so God put that in there for a
[1:14:40] contr how many believe you got a control
[1:14:43] tower I'm thankful for that control
[1:14:45] tower praise the lord we don't want to
[1:14:47] get too much into that but that's just
[1:14:48] kind of to lay out a little bit
[1:14:50] something
[1:14:51] amen praise the Lord
[1:14:54] you know man hasn't changed very
[1:14:59] much he's still wondering about in the
[1:15:01] world seeking pleasure Restless Never
[1:15:03] Satisfied never coming to any kind of
[1:15:05] conclusions never finding rest he's just
[1:15:08] about the same condition that he was
[1:15:10] when he left God In the Garden of Eden
[1:15:12] and went out to shift for himself he's
[1:15:15] been shifting ever since and he finds
[1:15:18] that way to
[1:15:22] go
[1:15:24] how many believe that before you were
[1:15:25] born again it was a rough way to go amen
[1:15:30] out there it's a rough way to go it's so
[1:15:34] rough many put a gun to their
[1:15:38] head how many know
[1:15:42] that the solution to the Palestinian
[1:15:45] problem you know they all get on these
[1:15:48] news and say h what's the problem what's
[1:15:49] the news and some of them say hey kill
[1:15:51] as many as you possibly can and make it
[1:15:53] realize hey they going to pay the price
[1:15:55] reckon that's the
[1:15:56] solution no but everybody the people are
[1:15:59] selfish is what it is they've got no
[1:16:02] love in their hearts not appreciation
[1:16:04] for what they have what they need is God
[1:16:06] they need the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:16:09] solution amen all
[1:16:12] right but listen he's got a rough way to
[1:16:15] go I notice he says man was made up in
[1:16:21] the beginning not to try to shift for
[1:16:23] himself man was made to rely completely
[1:16:27] on God that's the reason we're likened
[1:16:30] unto sheeps a sheep cannot lead himself
[1:16:32] he has to have a leader and the holy
[1:16:34] spirit's supposed to lead
[1:16:38] us
[1:16:40] amen praise the Lord the holy spirit is
[1:16:45] here and supposed to lead
[1:16:49] us now let's go for a little bit I'm
[1:16:52] talking about how to possess these
[1:16:54] things that brother baham said that
[1:16:56] you've got to fight every inch of ground
[1:16:59] to
[1:17:01] possess I've gotten to the place to
[1:17:04] where I like when the preacher when he
[1:17:06] says look you got to fight for every
[1:17:08] inch well try to describe a little bit
[1:17:11] what that's all
[1:17:12] about amen amen what does that mean well
[1:17:16] first of all we realize that we have
[1:17:18] every promise brother Bram says every
[1:17:20] promise in that book belongs to you
[1:17:23] but you got to
[1:17:25] fight and the way that you fight is God
[1:17:28] allows trials to come your
[1:17:31] way ain't that right he puts tests on
[1:17:35] you and tries you and and he gets things
[1:17:38] out of your
[1:17:41] life as you're able to get rid of things
[1:17:45] he can come in cuz I don't want God just
[1:17:48] in my heart just just a TI of a
[1:17:51] thumbnail how many would say tonight I
[1:17:53] want God to fill every fiber of my body
[1:17:57] I mean my toe down at the end of my toe
[1:18:00] I want him into every little hair I got
[1:18:03] I want him in every part of
[1:18:06] me I want him to oh I just want him I
[1:18:09] want to be so full of God until he oozes
[1:18:11] out until my cup runs
[1:18:13] over how many believe you can be there
[1:18:16] you can do it but he takes a committ to
[1:18:19] almighty
[1:18:21] God have to accept the leadership of the
[1:18:25] Holy
[1:18:27] Ghost amen and allow
[1:18:30] him to work on
[1:18:33] you to work on
[1:18:36] me amen amen see tutors and governors to
[1:18:42] find out how you're doing
[1:18:47] amen now notice better bam says now
[1:18:49] there's where the Pentecostal Church
[1:18:50] failed when they became so Sons they
[1:18:54] settle down and said well can we say to
[1:18:56] the message well I'm a message
[1:18:59] believer but yet you got all this stuff
[1:19:01] in your life that shouldn't be
[1:19:06] there didn't the prophet of God of a
[1:19:10] perfect man and God can't never really
[1:19:12] fully use you until you have all of
[1:19:14] these things in
[1:19:17] you do you realize those things are the
[1:19:20] great and precious Promises of God
[1:19:26] the fruit of the spirit those are the
[1:19:28] great and precious Promises of God
[1:19:31] that's rightfully
[1:19:36] yours
[1:19:39] amen they're
[1:19:41] rightfully
[1:19:44] yours amen
[1:19:50] notice let's go to uh Galati
[1:19:55] well I'm going to skip some of
[1:19:58] this let's go to Hebrews
[1:20:01] [Applause]
[1:20:06] 12 Hebrews 12 verse 7 says if you endure
[1:20:11] chastening God dealth with you as with
[1:20:16] sons now how many know that that Jo that
[1:20:19] that tutor that brother B talked about
[1:20:21] the Bible talks that we're under tutors
[1:20:22] anden he's watching what you do he's
[1:20:25] supposed to teach you things and brother
[1:20:27] says that's the Holy Ghost amen that's
[1:20:29] teaching us things correcting us
[1:20:33] chastising us as many as I love I rebuke
[1:20:37] and
[1:20:41] Chason
[1:20:48] my no in now if you endure chastening
[1:20:51] God deals with you as with sons for what
[1:20:54] son is he whom his father chasteneth
[1:20:58] not amen amen this is where I've wanted
[1:21:01] to go since the beginning of this series
[1:21:04] talking about how that God works on his
[1:21:10] children would it be okay brother John
[1:21:12] to say that any imperfections in our
[1:21:14] life God's got his eye on
[1:21:19] it sometimes we get to a place where we
[1:21:21] don't we we come so far and we stop we
[1:21:24] don't overcome this God can't take us
[1:21:26] any further until we deal with that
[1:21:31] right sometimes we battle with things
[1:21:34] battle with things battle with things
[1:21:36] battle with things hello it throws us
[1:21:39] down we get back up throws us down we
[1:21:41] get back up we're like the children of
[1:21:43] Israel sometimes it takes a long time to
[1:21:46] overcome it to conquer it to possess
[1:21:50] something that the enemy has and you
[1:21:55] wanted
[1:21:57] amen now notice that's
[1:22:00] right who what father what son comes to
[1:22:03] God that doesn't get chastisement gets
[1:22:05] correction gets
[1:22:12] training but if ye be without whereof
[1:22:15] all our partakers and are ye basers and
[1:22:18] not
[1:22:20] Sons now notice
[1:22:23] so the Pentecostal set it down and said
[1:22:25] this is it we've got our church we've
[1:22:26] got our denomination we'll just keep
[1:22:29] adding on adding
[1:22:31] more no that isn't it listen we'll build
[1:22:35] a better building that's good add more
[1:22:37] to the church that's good but God made
[1:22:40] you a son to give you a
[1:22:44] trial to see how you're going to act
[1:22:47] with
[1:22:48] it
[1:22:50] amen remember brother says we pray for
[1:22:53] this that or the other and the best
[1:22:54] thing God can give us is a
[1:22:58] trial didn't Paul say you know if we
[1:23:00] suffer with him we'll also Reign after
[1:23:02] telling us that we're an heir and so
[1:23:04] forth he says we're going to suffer with
[1:23:06] him how did how did Jesus come to
[1:23:08] Perfection according Bible says he
[1:23:09] through sufferings he became
[1:23:13] perfect how many knows that our trials
[1:23:16] and our tests they mean more to us than
[1:23:18] what we
[1:23:20] realize brother B didn't just say that
[1:23:22] for
[1:23:25] anyhow I'm going to go ahead and go to
[1:23:27] the next one let's go to
[1:23:31] James no not James
[1:23:35] Peter First Peter
[1:23:42] 1 he says to an inheritance
[1:23:45] Incorruptible and undefiled and that
[1:23:47] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[1:23:50] you who are kept by the power of God
[1:23:51] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:23:53] revealed in the last time wherein ye
[1:23:55] greatly Rejoice though now for a season
[1:23:58] if need be ye are in heaven is through
[1:24:00] manifold temptations that the trial of
[1:24:03] your faith being much more precious than
[1:24:05] of gold that perishes though it be tried
[1:24:07] with fire might be found unto praise and
[1:24:10] honor and Glory at the appearing of the
[1:24:13] Lord Jesus Christ James says it this way
[1:24:16] chapter one one page back or so in your
[1:24:18] Bible my brethren chapter 1 verse two my
[1:24:21] brethren count it all all
[1:24:23] joy when you fall into diverse
[1:24:29] Temptations I was studying today and
[1:24:31] brother Bram comes across he says you
[1:24:33] know when the devil really really really
[1:24:35] tempts you at something and you just
[1:24:37] pass it on by he says oh it feels so
[1:24:40] sweet doesn't it just feel so sweet when
[1:24:43] Temptation come you just pass it on by
[1:24:46] amen and you feel like Samson did amen
[1:24:49] when he killed that Lion and the
[1:24:51] honeybees made a big old honey n and he
[1:24:53] come back and he sat down and enjoyed
[1:24:56] some good oldfashioned victory honey out
[1:24:58] of the lion that's the way the believer
[1:25:02] is counted all
[1:25:05] joy oh we're just getting s listen we
[1:25:09] ask we might say you better better uh uh
[1:25:12] uh be careful what you ask for but I
[1:25:14] want a restatement don't be careful what
[1:25:16] you ask
[1:25:19] for because if you want the promises
[1:25:22] you won't get him any other way than
[1:25:24] claim it and believe
[1:25:27] it a
[1:25:30] chicken be careful what you ask
[1:25:34] for huh if you're a chicken then just be
[1:25:37] careful what you ask
[1:25:40] for you might you might not be able to
[1:25:42] handle what's
[1:25:45] coming because it's the
[1:25:49] truth now how many knows one of the
[1:25:54] one of the fruit of the spirits is
[1:25:55] patience that's right is that right Paul
[1:25:59] said tribulation work with
[1:26:02] patience oh you got to fight through
[1:26:04] tribulation you got to fight through
[1:26:06] hard things to get
[1:26:08] patience you got to fight just to have
[1:26:12] faith brother Tommy knows different one
[1:26:15] know you got to doubt your doubts no I
[1:26:18] refuse to believe that I'm oh I don't
[1:26:21] think I can
[1:26:22] I'm huh oh I don't believe I can be
[1:26:24] healed doubt that oh I doubt that I
[1:26:28] believe I can be healed doubt your doubt
[1:26:30] you got to fight for every inch there's
[1:26:32] a battle that comes with it God allows
[1:26:34] to get you in a battle to give you what
[1:26:37] you have want and what you
[1:26:42] desire how many believe
[1:26:44] that so why would James say this count
[1:26:47] it all
[1:26:48] joy knowing this that the trying of your
[1:26:52] Faith woo the trying of your faith Peter
[1:26:56] said it's more precious than gold when
[1:27:00] you get tried no wonder the public can
[1:27:02] say man God give you the best thing you
[1:27:04] good get put a trial on you put a test
[1:27:07] on
[1:27:08] you folks if I go to the Dodge
[1:27:10] stealership and he's got a Dodge R and
[1:27:12] they'll tell you what the front wheels
[1:27:14] will come up off of this thing anden
[1:27:17] when I get out on the road I want to be
[1:27:18] able to trumpet and I want the FR Wheels
[1:27:20] to come off that thing
[1:27:24] huh I don't want to go out there the
[1:27:27] next neighbor man the old lady and the
[1:27:30] little little whatever Nissan whatever I
[1:27:34] don't I not Nissan but some
[1:27:37] neon passes me up I'm gonna go back and
[1:27:41] say I'm going to
[1:27:45] heavy or
[1:27:47] Ford but I think a Dodge has a good
[1:27:50] vehicle brother Steve be all right
[1:27:58] amen think about it when there's if
[1:28:01] you're a Christian you say you're a
[1:28:04] Christian you're a
[1:28:06] Christian God's gonna put you to to
[1:28:09] test to see if you
[1:28:11] are you want Faith I'll give you faith I
[1:28:16] just got to go to this
[1:28:18] scripture oh
[1:28:21] my
[1:28:30] being justified by faith we have peace
[1:28:31] with God through the Lord Jesus CHR
[1:28:33] Christ by whom also we have access by
[1:28:35] faith into this grace wherein we stand
[1:28:37] and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God
[1:28:40] and not only so but we also
[1:28:43] glory in
[1:28:46] tribulations brother Paul did didn't he
[1:28:49] in Tribulation that knowing and I didn't
[1:28:51] even realized this was in here like this
[1:28:53] but knowing that tribulation worketh
[1:28:55] patience there he says it with
[1:28:58] James oh my and patience experience
[1:29:03] experience hope and hope maketh not
[1:29:06] ashamed the end is that you are not
[1:29:10] ashamed to take to the world I want you
[1:29:13] to know if you can't get over it if you
[1:29:15] can't get under if you can't go around
[1:29:17] it completely commit yourself which by
[1:29:20] said with the most powerful weapon the
[1:29:22] church is personal is a complete
[1:29:24] commitment to God Amen and watch God
[1:29:27] take you
[1:29:29] through let the leadership of the Holy
[1:29:32] Ghost so satate you I want you to know
[1:29:34] tonight I believe that we got to come to
[1:29:36] the place that the prophet of God was
[1:29:38] amen that he had such a voice on the
[1:29:39] inside he followed the holy spirit in
[1:29:42] such a
[1:29:44] way that he isn't the one that spoke to
[1:29:46] the bull he wasn't the one that spoke to
[1:29:48] the storm it was God said you speak
[1:29:51] first God told him to do it it wasn't
[1:29:54] him doing it in
[1:29:55] himself let me tell you something if you
[1:29:57] want to come to adoption if you want to
[1:29:59] come to the place of power of God don't
[1:30:01] do anything in
[1:30:04] yourself
[1:30:08] huh if God don't do it don't do
[1:30:13] it God don't say it don't say it but say
[1:30:17] the bride has th sayth the Lord or she
[1:30:19] keep
[1:30:20] still wait for God to do it how many
[1:30:24] wants to be at that
[1:30:28] place CU you got to come to a certain
[1:30:30] place that God can trust you
[1:30:37] amen I don't know where I put him that's
[1:30:40] why I keep a
[1:30:43] spare you love the
[1:30:46] Lord now that child in the Old Testament
[1:30:48] he never had any inheritance why the
[1:30:51] father couldn't trust him in any with
[1:30:52] anything what kind of fellow he would be
[1:30:55] but he couldn't trust him he's always a
[1:30:57] son but he didn't have any
[1:30:59] inheritance and if you don't watch
[1:31:02] Pentecostal church that's going to be
[1:31:04] our
[1:31:05] lot
[1:31:08] inheritance
[1:31:15] huh Pentecostal thought hey this is it
[1:31:18] we got here you know what he said hey
[1:31:20] we're settled down we this is said we
[1:31:22] got it no now it's time now you got the
[1:31:26] baptism the ho now you're Son of God now
[1:31:29] it comes time to train you it comes time
[1:31:33] for you to go and begin to get take
[1:31:35] possessions of these
[1:31:37] things

[1:31:45] like a
[1:31:46] man oh
[1:31:49] my have some love some brotherly
[1:31:52] kindness but the Pentecostals didn't
[1:31:54] have any
[1:31:56] love didn't have any
[1:31:59] love that's right one thought that he
[1:32:01] was coming on the cloud the other
[1:32:03] thought he was coming on a horse and
[1:32:04] they started the different Church split
[1:32:09] churches come on folks about like
[1:32:12] message people well seven seal is open
[1:32:14] the other is not sealed it's not a split
[1:32:19] churches now I'm starting to go down
[1:32:22] this road and I'm going to go for a
[1:32:24] little bit is that okay can I have a
[1:32:25] little extra
[1:32:27] time one of the first things that you
[1:32:29] want to possess is the fruit of spirit
[1:32:30] is been and that is love how many
[1:32:33] believe we want love how many wants love
[1:32:34] oh I want the love of God well like they
[1:32:37] say careful what you ask how are you
[1:32:40] going to get any love until you
[1:32:42] over hate first people got to do you so
[1:32:46] wrong until you oh maybe hate hate hate
[1:32:48] until you get so tired of it you say I'm
[1:32:50] tired of this huh that's exactly don't
[1:32:54] we all we've all we've all got that way
[1:32:56] stayed up at night oh man I hate that
[1:33:00] guy until you can get down on your knees
[1:33:02] I need the love of
[1:33:04] God I need joy in my life oh you're
[1:33:07] miserable that way if you want the
[1:33:09] promise of joy in your life you realize
[1:33:11] you got to have forgiveness in your
[1:33:14] heart that's right you got to forgive
[1:33:16] cuz you won't never be justified in the
[1:33:18] sight of God until you have yours
[1:33:19] forgiven and Jesus said if you don't
[1:33:21] forgive other their trespasses neither
[1:33:23] will you father forgive you of your
[1:33:24] trespasses you got to be forgiven if
[1:33:26] you're going to have joy and when you
[1:33:28] get that true joy and you have that
[1:33:30] battle and you overcome all those
[1:33:33] thoughts and all those feelings then you
[1:33:35] have joy that's
[1:33:38] right people say this about you calls
[1:33:41] you Bells you bu call you this that or
[1:33:42] the other I read today where brother
[1:33:45] says man somebody will do something
[1:33:46] wrong to you or whatever and you want to
[1:33:47] tell them back he says go ahead if you
[1:33:49] tell them back he says you're fighting
[1:33:51] your own fight and God can't fight your
[1:33:53] fight for you you're fighting your own
[1:33:55] battle I'll tell that person go
[1:33:59] ahead huh how believe you got to follow
[1:34:02] the follow the principles this is where
[1:34:04] this fight that we're talking about
[1:34:06] every inch of ground that you gain every
[1:34:08] possession of every promise that you get
[1:34:10] you're going to have to fight for it in
[1:34:12] other words if you you wouldn't have to
[1:34:14] fight whether any of you wasn't in the
[1:34:16] battle that's right so if you got to
[1:34:18] fight that means you're in a battle
[1:34:20] you're in a trial you're in a test a't
[1:34:22] that right first thing God did when he
[1:34:25] brought the children of Israel out is
[1:34:27] put them under test put them in a
[1:34:29] battle Amen to see what they would
[1:34:34] do he wanted them to have faith so he
[1:34:38] made a situation arise to where they
[1:34:40] couldn't go across and the and the
[1:34:42] Egyptians were coming and the dust was
[1:34:44] flying and the horses and man I can only
[1:34:46] M I can only imagine the sound of those
[1:34:49] chariots and those Egyptian W we're

[1:34:56] go and we gonna bring them back they
[1:34:58] heard them for Miles screaming and all
[1:35:00] oh boy they're psyched up they gonna get
[1:35:02] us

[1:35:24] there's a lake in front of us I don't
[1:35:25] care if we can't go backwards I can't go
[1:35:27] sideways can't go
[1:35:30] forward God puts you in places you don't
[1:35:32] know where to go just to make sure that
[1:35:34] you actually have
[1:35:37] faith so that you can say like Paul you

[1:36:04] longsuffering if you have a battle that
[1:36:06] is
[1:36:09] long that person just won't quit doing
[1:36:12] that this trouble just won't

[1:36:19] god'll take me through right I take give
[1:36:22] me long

[1:38:01] how many knows I don't care if last one
[1:38:03] of them dies that is not going to shake
[1:38:06] my faith that God Is A
[1:38:08] Healer Billy Paul dies well where's the
[1:38:11] shark I don't care where the sharks are
[1:38:13] I know God's Prophet was a God's Prophet
[1:38:15] don't even come with all that huh
[1:38:18] doesn't shake my
[1:38:19] faith God is still a
[1:38:22] Healer doesn't matter how many brother B
[1:38:24] says I don't care if I pray for 500 they
[1:38:26] all
[1:38:27] die I don't want to any of them to die
[1:38:29] you understand that but I'm saying just
[1:38:31] because people die doesn't mean that God
[1:38:33] is Not A
[1:38:34] Healer God has a purpose in
[1:38:37] it folks if I brother if I pray for
[1:38:40] something and believe for something and
[1:38:41] ask God for something and God still does
[1:38:43] the opposite I say thank you Lord
[1:38:46] because I don't care who you are right
[1:38:48] even Jesus himself had to pray I'd like
[1:38:51] have it this way but not my will father
[1:38:53] let thy will be
[1:38:57] done
[1:38:59] amen he doesn't always tell us what his
[1:39:02] will is as a matter of fact a lot of
[1:39:04] time we don't understand what in the
[1:39:06] world this is all about
[1:39:09] [Applause]
[1:39:10] why
[1:39:12] huh
[1:39:15] amen but if you want joy you got to
[1:39:18] fight for it if you want meekness well
[1:39:21] guess what God's going to have to really
[1:39:24] humble you maybe where you become Meek

[1:42:00] the divine nature of almighty
[1:42:03] God now I don't know about you but
[1:42:05] that's what everybody in here needs it's

[1:42:55] how that all works I don't know but I
[1:42:56] know that You' got to have the character

[1:43:29] Holy Ghost in our hearts in our lives
[1:43:33] amen amen closing with

[1:44:17] and they had not notice if they'd write
[1:44:20] checks anything that boy did it was just
[1:44:22] as good the name just as good on a check
[1:44:26] as his fathers after that adoption amen
[1:44:30] he was air after the adoption well
[1:44:34] that's where the church needs to be
