========================================

is nothing so when the devil tries to bring fears on you know whatever it might be you shake them off God has the whole world in control he's not going to lose none of them if if I go it was my time to go so I don't have to fear that there's only peace with him he's the Prince of Peace you know stimulation by Revelation I said you give a lord a round of applause huh come on I might get fired up up here uh Luke 10 9 what do you say uh 19 he said bold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you and I was standing in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject into you but Rejoice rather that you're names are written in heaven and in the spirit in the hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank thee oh Father the Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed it unto babes and such as you know that's that's just another thing right there it's just such a blessing that we've got a prophet that he sent us a prophet message of the hour to open our eyes and to be able to grow closer in fellowship with the Lord you know closer than any other thing out there you know just makes the word more real to us you know if he is the word he said I'll be with you in you into the end of the world then we are the word being manifest we're walking talking word written pistols read of all men we should be seeing the same signs of Warriors fall in our life you know hello father for so it seemed good and that's like all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and and he to whom the son revealth him and he said he turned them to them his disciples and said privately blessed are your eyes which they see and that the things that you see and you know that just ties right in together and then I just wanted to add one more before we get going here this one just came to me last night in Revelations 12 9 he's sitting uh 12-7 and there was a war in heaven Michael and his archangels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and they prevailed not neither was their place found any more in the heaven and there was a great drag cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out uh but who will he not deceive the Bride of Jesus Christ he was cast out of the whole Earth uh and and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and Kingdom of our God the power of Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused us before night and day before God night and day but they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony blessed be the name of the Lord I just love those scriptures you just take them you know just like brother Davey showed me that I mean you can stand on that you stand on that word of God huh and he was preaching that too and I I originally when I started thinking about this I was thinking about doing it the Wednesday before Thanksgiving because that would be the year actual that day it would be well that Wednesday last year this this year will actually be Thursday but needlessly but then we wouldn't have in service but I was going to call it thanks living you know not Thanksgiving thanks be to God I'm here you know by God's grace and uh so but I hope it's just an encouragement to y'all to get you know uh to get out of your comfort zone for Jesus you no I you know it's worth it'll be worth it all to you all the growing and the growth that you'll have in the fellowship with him he's our best friend he'll help you overcome everything the devil throws at you he will never fail you you just pray for some more Revelation more stimulation by Revelation too pray for more faith you know and uh he stopped right here uh yeah I I got a few other things let me add here uh but I was thinking about as my fellowship's grown with God you know as we start walking in the spirit as healing Spirit we can start seeking him in different ways and and he can talk to us you know I have devotionals and things that he can it feels like he's speaking straight to me just when I'm seeking for answers he knows exactly what to get to me when I need to I believe that's just some fellowship with him he knows how to do it and he can use whatever he has so you know brother Ron Spencer was up there preaching up here at them Louisiana meetings he was up here he said he seen brother Tim Hewitt up here uh with his iPad he said he was sitting back here and he said the iPad started scrolling going in clicking coming in going in all by itself was going in clicking and clicking it like picked out the uh part of the sermon brother Brown on pre-stone for him and he kept on going he didn't know what was happening but it was what was it the spirit of the Lord he's in there doing all that so he can work through them things you know and and you know just get you going you know and uh just like I sent you this morning you know part of the one of my devotionals said that oh Lord thou cat thou has pleaded the cause of my soul thou has redeemed my life that thanks living a grateful Spirit should you know a grateful heart I should give back with gratefulness I should you know be grateful for what God's done for me A Grateful Spirit ever cultivated by the Christian especially after deliverances we should prepare a song for our God you know I was like you know so he started speaking to me like you know you know Lord You're On Track we can be a fool for Christ you know uh I was like that's part of that's in here too I started talking about you know we talk about being a fool for Christ but when do we put it to practice so so we get to practice you know and I was even thinking you think it says fear not uh for perfect love casts out fear so I was like okay you know so if we're overcoming fears we're for trying to perfect love but uh he said all the Earth should be filled Temple filled with the songs of grateful Saints and every day should be a century of smoking sweet in a sense of Thanksgiving up to the Lord uh and then uh this popped up uh the lifeline ever more every Sunday morning we'll put a new audio up and this was brother Brown this morning [Music] for sure [Applause] [Music] [Music] talk to God [Music] [Applause] [Music] amazing foreign [Music] you know we get fellowship with him you know I mean what does he long for from the very beginning before the foundation of the world we had this on his mind he longed to have the fellowship with us you know so I'm just here to give a praise report of my own my growing with the Lord words can't describe you know what the Lord's what the Lord this trial is meant to make God literally made my trial a blessing I know the scriptures say our trials are more precious than gold and silver but in the middle of the storm you you can't see it but I'm here to tell you no matter what you're going through God can make your child a blessing you only believe in trust in him he's one of one of the biggest trials for me before this one was I was locked up and Tammy mailed me this song and don't mind if I could if you if you don't know it I'd like to share it with you says I've just come into a valley one like I've never been before I keep searching for a way out seems like padlocks are on the doors oh there must be another sunrise or another Sunset I'll see God will make this child a blessing that's the love he has for me I was not the first one to come into this place you see every child of God this test he must face it is here that God will mold you and make you what you ought to be God will make his trial a blessing just be patient you will see now I'm standing on the Mountaintop looking back I can see when I was in the lowest Valley his strong hand was leading me always good to see the sunshine and sweet they Sweet Victory God has made my travel a blessing and that's the grace he gives to me and God will make this trial a blessing though that sends me to my knees though my tears fall like a river and in him their sweet relief there's no need to get discouraged there's no need to talk defeat God will make his trial a blessing in the whole wide world will see just blessed to be the name of the Lord man he knows how to do it all you know and uh I said you know sometimes it's a God he'll lay us on our back you know the prophet says sometimes God last on her back say where our great blessings come from you know when you when you have the Enemy at the gates and trying to kill you and the doctors and the devil and everything online trying to to get me to you to to get tell me I got to get used to the new me get used to the new you pretty much felt like my life was over with the way everything they had described to me and what they had said and that it would never fall holy heal it was a really dark situation but God was rich in Mercy spared me and gave me Grace to reflect on my life I had a lot of regrets and made a bunch of promises to the Lord from all my years of being stagnant and complacent on God no Victory barely any kind of relationship just one-sided but his anchor was holding me and after all that God's Grace has saved me from and delivered me from drugs and alcohol in the back and spared my life countless times I still didn't have enough fire to testify for my king or stand and overcome fears for him not but not me done he's worthy to be for me to lay aside all my fears and got on my comfort zone you know whether it's clapping praising God singing no matter what you're doing if you're making a little effort he'll see it and we just give our comfort zone if we got things that we need to overcome you know just take that step towards him get rid of it take it towards him lean on his word and try to try to get some devotionals do them things like I was saying that would draw you closer to him and to walk in the spirit as he's in the spirit the more spiritual you get the better off you'll be and and that he I said uh here I was like if we get off our comfort zone like he did I'm sure he was a little bit uncomfortable going to the cross and being put to death for something he didn't do oh my when you think of it the Amazing Grace but what because I had no Victory I hadn't I had an addiction to YouTube Instagram TV and just being plain old lazy on God in hindsight 2020 I can see that the main thing was I I've heard it preached a million times we don't we don't see the fire in the church because I ain't doing what I'm supposed to at home and that's the truth because I had put everything before God I didn't have a good fellowship with the prince of peace and so when I came to church with convictions instead of Victory I had hardness because of it was snowballing you know walking in the spirit I wasn't feeding the spirit I wasn't cooked I couldn't walk in the spirit because I wasn't feeding the spirit like I should have been but the Lord it was just like a revolving door not feeding that you know it was that that black dog was coming robbing me in my food that I was forfeiting by poor forfeiting him that and that poor poor me poor me mentality steps in you know and so many many uh man can get wore out trying to feel that thirst still with emptiness Tammy said we should pretty much it out it's an awesome spot uh man can get wore out trying to feel that thirst and still with emptiness but when he said come unto me all you that are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you for my yoke is easy and my burden is life see he wanted to bear that load with us you know uh we're battling an enemy that we can't defeat without him the devil in ourselves but as dark as it it can get in the hospital room Jesus Christ stepped in and turned the lights on gave me some stimulation my Revelation that I'd be healed I took him at his word and I got out and I've been I've been believing in going on God's worked more miracles in my life since then but the main thing I wanted to show is just how awesome and mindful the Lord is and how he's changed my devotion to him and it's transformed my life more of him I pour the more of me I pour out the more him he pours in and back and forth the more I pour him out the more I testify him like he said that stimulation boy you start even just talking about the praising God you started he didn't have he just started they start firing up don't they huh it just gets you fired up that's what you just want to pour out more because he can pour more in there you know um but uh uh I see yeah I said this was pushing behind me you know he's the life Giver pushing though pushing that that fire that Zeal from God Almighty he inhabits the pros as people he gives the joy unspeakable and full of drawer it comes it's a piece that passes understanding and it comes from an ongoing growing fellowship with a prince of peace he loves us and just Longs for our fellowship that's where we were on his mind before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and how he's so mindful of us and another little testimony down there in Louisiana you know and uh you know I I'd have to think too on things you know because God's word says it I believe it but you know we got examples like you know let's say brother bring them his stomach problem you know I mean we've he worked millions of Miracles you know but just because he didn't get it immediately he kept believing pressing the Mark we keep believing it anyhow you know so just because but anyway I'm down there they was having a little prayer line down there at the Louisiana thing and uh I wasn't even gonna go up and I'm like well I'll go ahead and go because I'm like you know because part of you if you're going to go up and get prayed for you almost think well I'm doubting you know because this word done says it I believe it I receive it but you know still no you can still go get prayed for it but so I went ahead and was it up here and uh I think it was brother Timothy Pruitt he came behind me and started praying and then Ron stepped over and he put his hand on my heart and he started praying and he was saying something and then it was like he was saying you know and brother Ron he's had you know visions and different things y'all know and it was like I thought you know because you know the chaos of the prayer line you know everything that was being said I got out I was like I'm pretty sure like he was saying that you know that uh I was gonna receive my healing but I was like man I I wanted so bad go back and ask him you know because I'm like you know well anyway the next day uh I was out there always out there I was talking to him and stuff and I never asked him you know I didn't think nothing of it then we was going back in about an hour early to get in and get our seats you know and I'm like man if he's still out there I'd like to ask him you know and plus the anointing of someone in the prayer line he may not even know what he said you know but but I was like if he's still out there maybe I'll ask him you know just see if he's saying something and uh I go back out there he wasn't there I'm like Lord I mean you know you already know it's already written I already believed it anyway I don't have to have that if you was trying to tell me something you can get him to say something to me you know I heard whatever and then in the middle of that service he called me out he stopped and called me out and uh said you know you thought you come down here you was making a table for someone and you thought you was coming down here and deliver a table but because the Lord showed him that because you've done something for a servant of the Lord uh you're gonna have a hard job you know and you know that was just him being mindful of me I believe just give me that encouragement to just keep pressing the mark don't doubt just keep believing keep pressing on and it was just real encouraging just because you know I mean I already had his word like I said we already have this Revelation right here it's already done you know we're just waiting for it to just completely done that way we can have a Vindicated miracle that way we can come just slaying Devil's heads off what you got now just like wrote runs but you said boo devil you didn't have enough you know I love when he does that gets all part of you know he doesn't went through all kinds of stuff too but you know uh and truly I believe that his his word and power to be it's our weapons to overcome all things as he did you know it's that our means that we have we're more than conquerors through Christ you know I must decrease so he can increase and he that began the good work and we will finish it honored to hold this sword the word the prayers here my prayers here lately has been what I told you it's been you know isn't more skillful than us here because of it because if we're the bride of Christ we are able to speak the spoken word and we should get that revelation and I wish just take it as it is it says it I believe it we can't emphasize on that enough you know it just that's the stimulation about Revelation because blessed be the name of the Lord get me fired up thinking about it just talking about it praise God all right y'all can amen y'all can amen hallelujah you want to uh you know and you know brother Brian she said why cry speak what's he talking about speak the spoken word no taking him you know we already both face any giant anything that we have using this word we should be able to see results by using this word if we doubt not and only believe you know and uh it says uh fear not be only this man you know how can we not boldly stand on that in the face of our enemy and the fears that we have whatever that it might hinder the praise of our King of Kings can you imagine Little David saying I ain't good enough to sling that stone I ain't no good he didn't look at that he didn't look at that he looked at God and where his help come from what about in Joshua and Caleb you know they go out there well there's like nah man we all right covers we can't do it nope we can bust the devil in the mouth and be like brother Ron Spencer like I said boo devil you didn't have enough we'll say it again you know because what we're gonna do we can go together all of us we can be on a head hunting Mission together uh to hunt every devil down snuff them out in our lives we got them all around us trying to defeat us but there's more of a scenarios of them blessed be the name of the Lord you know Lord he's worthy of all praise we can Praise Him in spirit and Truth let us walk in the spirit walk higher and higher until we just walk on out of here as mature mature bride of Christ you know if God before us who can be against us now I have this you know I have a revelation that neither like Paul did neither death nor anything that was separated from the love of God blessed be in the name of the Lord foreign myself a bunch of times when using guys work more effectively you know and I'd prayed you know like I said you know for Lord you know all my life I had you know the way I grew up I had TV in my life all my life you know and I remember after I was out of the hospital I'm like you know I think like you know brother Tom and other people and I'm just like I don't know what y'all do it without TV you know I've had TV all my life so it's just like man I'm praying Lord I don't know where you do it but you know God just started taking my desire from it taking my desire from I'm like you know and I so I then you kind of have a little bit more idle time you know you read your Bible and you pray but you still got a little bit of that relaxed time you want to relax you know and you know I still watch YouTube some stuff but I ain't got that addicted mentality like I did you know you can control it you know and TV's all right if you use it for a good thing you know we can watch sermons we can watch good stuff on there but you know I ain't sitting here but anyway yeah uh the whole point is that's when I started kind of picking up a little guitar I was like you know if I just stuck with it a long time ago maybe I could do something but I was like you know I can get out here in the basement just make a joy of noise for the Lord you know it gives me some clean uh hobby to do and uh well the Lord started dealing with me I ran up on this verse and said sing unto him a new song played with play for him skillfully with a loud noise you know and then I sit here uh be a fool for Christ you know when we practice that if I was a good singer it wouldn't be much of a sacrifice to get up here you know what I'm saying but uh you gotta have something to overcome and and this is where he really started dealing with me is the lifeline devotional that day that the sermon was titled so whatever he says to you do it and then he and there is on the lifeline it says if you if you there's no battle then there's no Victory but if you have to you have to have a battle to have the victory if it was just given to you it wouldn't be no wouldn't be no Victory but he that overcometh is the one who has the victory so Jesus came to the Earth and had a battle he won the Victory and tonight we have a battle and with Christ we can have the victory that was that and then the verse was like I was like I don't know but oh a song sing unto the Lord of no song for he had done marvelous things in his right hand and His holy um that's when I started thinking Lord you know I'm like nah you know hey I ain't there yet you know what I'm saying I ain't ready to sing but then all of it then he starts speaking to me and then you even preaching there and uh you had made the comment about healing healing coming by music you know and you start talking about letting the worshipers arise you know and uh Tammy sent me this one and said the she just sent me she didn't know the Lord had already started dealing with me a little bit about this but he said shame on you people who don't believe in strange music no wonder he was just brother Brown no no wonder evil spirits never like it they they have to get away David cast out Devils by playing on a string instrument that's what the scripture says that's right when David will begin to play the evil spirit would leave Saul is that right so this little boy was born for the world for a purpose you believe that and uh so so and then you start talking about that you know and so I felt like that thanks living testimony you know and sacrificing and myself to get up here and sing a song to magnify the god it seemed fitting for the time and season you know I said I'm not I'm not a singer I'm not I'm I sit up here and try to make a Joyful Noise for the Lord I want it to be more kind of more like that woman what what is what is she uh what was it the woman that gave she gave all she had she was poor but she gave off she had and they gave out of the bones of her heart but he said she gave more you know I'm saying I might not have ten thousand dollar boys but if I got a penny voice I want the Lord Bell to say he gave all he had with what he had you know if we can do that for the Lord I believe he'll be happy with it you know and uh so if we can just make it Lord proud that's all that matters and uh but I seen it I've seen it felt see I felt like singing another song after it you know as y'all could probably see if y'all know how I am I kind of go over the top with things you know overdo things or you know the next thing I know in my mind I'm like you know we can sing this song we could do the singing victory after that and actually bring everybody into it I was picturing football you know I'm like then I was playing with Joshua then when I started singing I'm like that's just in my mind it sounded really cool we got some years of practice guys maybe one of these days we'll get there but not yet we ain't there yet so so uh we're gonna play a little bit I had the in my devotional I I did scratch that idea for playing the Sea of Victory we are gonna do a little tail end of it because I just thought you know it's super awesome if you know the song you know it it says the nerd you know you take what the enemy meant for evil and you turn it for good what do you do here you know devil won't take my life but turn it for greatest blessing of my life you know and it says I'm gonna see a victory why because I'm gonna say a victory you know you might very well see it today Jesus Christ here you know but then I was praying I started kind of hitting on me with uh with us with Grace with Amazing Grace because that's my first Christian song I learned and I'm you know down there in my basement I can play pretty good by myself but you know you get up here nervous in front of everybody your Lord willing to just help me but uh so that's where the devotionals the saying I'm talking about I'm like okay Lord if if you're thinking you want me to play Amazing Grace too uh let my devotional when I go up early in my quiet time devotional uh let it have something about Grace and then this is what it had and like maybe it's a coincidence so I'll flip back like I don't know 10 15 pages there wasn't no Grace nowhere I'm like well okay maybe maybe that's what you're telling me this is now Faith is a revelation from God now Faith is a revelation there's where I want to stay just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed this to you by his grace and it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself into faith if you ever had faith it was given to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation the whole Church of God is built upon Revelation and that sermon is titled works is Faith expressed so we should be able to say our works manifesting our faith blessed be the name of the Lord and uh I was going to say yeah yeah can you pull the song up Micah I was just going to give you a little song that I've been working on the song had kind of uh I had started with one little verse in my mind I broke the line down I started with a line and uh uh I might have went on for a while actually I found another song I kind of started taking some chords from and uh uh yeah so if you see the course one all I want to do is glorify you and think on things honestly true uh that's where I started that and I don't know it just went just a little piece at a time I had no notes wasn't ever really trying to go anywhere with it but by the time I was done you know the main the main idea was you know you think in the battlefield of our mind we've we've been we we learned all kinds of bunch of junk we get scarred in our minds you know we've been taught wrong things and we have all this stuff but you know and we can raise a child up in the way we should go but without a new birth experience and God giving you some revelation you know we don't even know and so that's what my prayer was always or just you know teach me what to think you know you know I just want to think on things that are just honest and good report you know pure you know and think on them things so that was the kind of the inspiration of the course and that and and you know when you when I say that part I don't I know now what I didn't know then is you love me for the foundation you know that was because I didn't know how he longed so much to have that fellowship with me you know and when you you know a lot of that right there you can see it's pretty self-explanatory but but uh when uh I said I need you more I need you more I need you more Lord when I did I was broken you know that was because once you get the revelation of what you're up against the devil and your enemy and yourself we realize I need him more today than I did yesterday every day I need more of him you know because that battle increases we need more him that's kind of where where the thoughts came from with that and uh yeah it's just uh and Lord it's all it's all it's not me it's all you it's amazing grace all the way through that come from uh you know he chose us for the foundation in the world he had us on his mind you know so it wasn't nothing I done he started to work I mean he's gonna finish it so that's kind of just the gist of the story of the song let's get it yeah y'all pray for me yeah has some mercy and Grace in your hearts okay beautiful can you hear me now can you can you do any sound effects I want you got Amazing Grace we're gonna start with Amazing Grace first [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] it was Graceland on my heart to fear and Grace my fears really our precious did let your grace of fear the hour I first believed through many dangerous storms and snares I have already gone it was grace

Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed unto you but my Father which is in heaven and I send you thee that upon that thou art Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so here we see in Genesis where he says your seed and we are the Seed of Abraham this morning if we are believers is that right he said we'll possess the gates of our enemy and then Jesus said I'm going to build my church on Revelation and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against that so this morning I want to speak on the thought of the gates of hell the gates of hell and we'll find out what they are and how it is that we can withstand their attack on us and possess those Gates I'm just going to tell you right off how you do it second Corinthians 10 and 3 it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down the strongholds casting down imagination every High thing that exalts itself against the God and bring a new captivity every thought to The Obedience of God so friends we have Gates that we fight our battle is in the mind right and so what Satan wants to do is he wants to come into our mind and affect us through these Gates we have five gates into your mind their imagination memory affection reasoning conscious these are the Gates of Hell friends because when the Satan when Satan possesses those Gates he makes your life hell he makes your mind stressed he does all kinds of sexes to get us disbelief but when we possess the gates and we can hold those thoughts out and we can't hold them up but we can we can overcome what he throws against us that's the way we ever overcoming life is because we deny Satan's thoughts that he's thrown into our mind the battle is in the mind don't ever forget that don't ever let Satan tell you it's something else everything else is just creating an atmosphere so that when he throws a thought into your mind you will believe his thought all we we contact this world with our five senses uh Tay's field to touch all that kind of stuff and smell and in sight but friends that's not the battle when you walk in that brother you walk down the street you see some sexy dressed woman that's not the battle the battle is what you think about it it's not a sin if someone walks through in front of me and I happen to look at her and you know and I just gonna look away but if I continue it because my mind says I want to look now I'm losing the battle but the battle is in your mind it's not the stuff you see around you when you're sick well you get cancer that's not your battle is how you think about it it's what you take you take Satan's thought about your cancer or you take God's thought about it there's your there's your your battle right there and you win or lose according to how that works out whether that kept the cancer what was your approach to it that's the whole battle and anytime Satan can get us looking at something else well this brother is my problem no he's not your spouse is not your problem your kids are not your problem your job is not your problem it's the way you think about it is your problem that's where you either lose or you win and Satan throws those thoughts into your mind every hour of every day and you fight that battle constantly it's never done so you say well who wins well according to who you believe it's according to who you believe you either believe Satan's thought about it or you believed God's thought about it and they're both preaching their own gospels and you have Satan's gospel and anything against God's word is Satan's gospel everything against his word and he brings everything he can and sometimes it seems so innocent it seems like well that's nothing wrong with thinking that but if you look at what it's going to lead to yes there might be something wrong with it so don't be deceived because he brings some word or he has a quote or a scripture because Satan uses those against you to justify what you he what you your own nature wants to do that's why we have so many denominations and people believe on all kinds of stuff because Satan gives them a word out of the Bible says well you can do this and you can believe that and you can do that God is love right then any kind of love is of God well we know that's not true there's a lot of perverted love out there that has nothing to do with God so we find out Satan gets to know you really well when you're really young he starts he starts observing you when you were born and he sees your grandparents your parents your siblings your uncles and aunts and he sees how all this stuff is affecting you and what kind of personality you have and then he decides how to attack you according to that personality and he starts immediately and he starts putting things in your mind he starts causing trauma he's just causing addiction he starts causing complexes he starts getting to be setting sins when you're just a two or three-year-old kid he's already laying the foundation for it and you get up to the age of accountability look around and you start thinking man I got problems because he started at a young age and I think some of you will be able to to witness with me on this you find out see here's the same does he looks at you to see how spiritual he thinks you might be he looks at you to see how if you are this seed of God and he don't know that but he will look for a certain character heuristics to determine if you are a seated God and if he thinks that you are one of gods he's going to give you special attention and he's going to do all he can to have you so messed up by the time of the time to give your heart to the Lord that you just don't even know what to do and you might have tried to serve God kind of like a five-year-old eight-year-old whatever but when God starts dealing with you Satan starts dealing with you and next thing you know you see so many of these young people running out here and running there and doing all kinds of crazy stuff you think well they must be the spawner saying and it's not true at all because Satan's been attacking them extra and when you you call this witness to this you are not a normal child when you were growing up you are different than your peers you always didn't fit in or you had something weird about you and you might have some kind of Oddball something and even you're you're different than your sibling sometime and all it was but there's something inside of you that was looking for satisfaction and your friends and your siblings and whoever else they could find satisfaction from Satan's satisfaction but you couldn't find it because that seed inside of you would never be satisfied with anything less than the word of God that's why you were weird I'm speaking for myself that was a strange kid I look back and say man feel it's amazing you even survived it's true hey this is what the prophet said about you I'm not making this up the prophet go look like he said he said your eyes different you never could fit in there you know what other kids could you you couldn't do it I tried to do it some of us tried to do it and you find out it just didn't satisfy aren't you glad of that praise the Lord what if you would have been normal he might not be here this morning I'm not saying you're not normal you're normal believers but this is what Satan does and the next you know you have this complex you say why do I fat this inferiority why do I have to control why do I have this be setting sin what to do that and you can trace it back into your mind and Satan has strong holds in your mind that he put that when you were just a kid and you're completely innocent what he was doing and now you're 15 years old you have to start overcoming and then your next thing you know you're 60 years old you're still fighting that same battle it doesn't go away friends but you can defeat those strongholds I'm saying the battle don't go away but I'm here to tell you this morning by the time I'm done if you don't believe you can do tear down that stronghold you ain't been listening to what God's trying to tell you because right now this morning you can get rid of those strongholds if you desire to [Applause] you know what it takes you stop believing Satan's gospel and start believing God's gospel that's all it's that simple friends it really is and here's what Satan does he will give you a complex then he'll turn around and offer you the cure for it yeah people have to be in control you see people who call them control freaks right I don't know that's a really good term but people always have to be in control very they'll use anger they'll use pouting to use everything to control the people around him that's a complex and so they had this complex they feel like they're out of control so what do they do go to anger there's something you need to get mad you need to control this with your anger because you can force these people you can intimidate them into being what you want them to be he uses a lot of things what's your weakness that's where that's where your Escape is signal off you and Escape The Escape into this Escape into that try you know go off and buy yourself you know that person alike you know that person this person at church treats me bad right I'm just gonna go with this right and so if he don't shake my hand or you know he says something that kind of gets on me he kind of picks at me a little bit and I walk away I said well you know what I don't need him anyways I don't need his Fellowship who is he I'm escaping into Satan's Escape because that's not the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit never told me to have that attitude towards that person it's Satan's stronghold amen so who wins whoever you choose to believe because see to believe Satan takes Faith also when Satan tells you something you have to have faith in what he's saying otherwise you won't do it when God tells you something you have to Faith what he's saying or you won't do it Satan tells a young kid he says you know what life is just unbearable why don't you kill yourself as takes faith in Satan's word to commit suicide it really comes down who do you believe that's all it is you choose you choose who to believe I'm gonna read something out of church but probably the most preached on or quoted scripture in the whole message but it's just amazing he says this have you ever noticed how Satan hates the two books of the Bible more than all others see liberal theologians a pseudoscientist he has always attacking the Book of Genesis and Book of Revelations both these books we find Satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction so this morning I hope we're going to see his awful ways this is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed this morning we're exposing Satan and his awful works [Music] he hates those books he explodes exactly what he is Jesus said about Satan he has no pardon me I have no part in him see Satan will tell you I got a part of you he said because of your own nature and I can affect you I can get in your mind and make a fight then I have a part of you but see what happened at Calvary is he said I paid the price you will no more long have you no longer have a part in my people because I have paid that off you have nothing to say he said but I still have this old nature you do have that and that's why we still have the fun the battle but for the real you he has no part in that because that is absolutely a part of God he has no pardon God then if you are born again he has no part in you you're just living in this battle in this body that he can still fight with and because of that is molding your character that's the only thing is for friends the reason we had these battles the Reason God allowed you to have that complex is to mold your character that's what it's about God allowed you to have that he allowed that sickness he allowed that temper he allows that be setting sin you say you can't do anything to you that he doesn't have permission from God to do ain't that amazing we give him too much credit way too much credit you do what you want to do that hurts my feelings I said God I don't want to do this and I do it anyways he says it's because you want to oh yeah but if you're born again you don't want to a party you've done your own nature does go ask what Paul said about it go back and read what part he said when I would do good and evil is with me that was the born-again church age messenger called Paul he struggled with that you think we're not going to since Satan country said if you were really born again you wouldn't have that desire if you knew what you're talking about you wouldn't be Satan friend without the Temptation we live perfect lives we don't need the blood anymore we don't need Christ anymore I'm just Zippy to do that through life because I have no more Temptation because all my desires are to serve God that's just not reality if you're trying to receive the Holy Ghost and you think you can get to that point where you don't ever struggle with those flesh anymore you're living in a fantasy world that's not gonna happen Jesus himself was tempted if Jesus was tempted how about us stop listening to Satan's lie and say Well if you really wanted to serve God you wouldn't have this problem or you wouldn't struggle with that or if you were really born again you wouldn't have these desires and you wouldn't fall into this and you wouldn't fall into this let me tell you something the most born-again person was still gonna make mistakes every day and the only way you can make a mistake is you believe Satan's life for at least a half a second you can't make a mistake without believing what saying told you to do I drive down the road you know and this happened man I'm driving down the road and I get a thought well so-and-so said this about me Maybe but what if he did and 20 minutes later I have worked myself up into a tizzy and I stop I look what are you doing Phil because I had all peace I had peace in my heart everything's fine I get a thought I stopped playing with that thought and whatever it is and 20 minutes later I'm all tore up and I stop and say you're tore up about and lie that never happened damn you know what I'm talking about some of you probably don't some of you are above that but we get tore up about nothing what if that person thinks that about me oh my goodness and then pretty soon I don't want to talk to that person well I got an attitude well why because well two weeks ago driving down the road and the thought came that maybe he thought this about me you ever do that my makes me feel so weak he has no part in me I have no pardon him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all I can to destroy confidence in the word he's trying to destroy your confidence in the word so when you come to church and brother Thomas is preaching he's telling you something but you have a memory or you have an imagination or you have a conscience or something and it's still just kind of like holding you back from believing and it causes doubt and that's all he has to do and just plant seeds of God in there yeah but is it really you yeah but could it really happen to you yeah but are you really sure what about that preach you left the message what about that person who did this and he tries to get you so you all tore up so your mind just be I believe what you're saying amen but is it but but because we had a little bit of Doubt Satan throws in there instead of extinguishing it right away we just kind of hold on because we're hedging our bets you know what that means hedge hedge is like like a you know like if you you put a hedge around your garden or your yard to keep people out like a Bounder right you gotta trim your Hedges right well there's something called a hedge fund and if you're into if you know anything about finances you can you can invest your money into your main investment over here but over here you put a hedge fund something that you know is not going to fail in case you lose all this over here you still have this to fall back on how many people have hedge funds when it comes to serving God I believe you Lord I know you're going to heal me but just in case just in case let me just hold on to this little something over here let me hold on to this doubt over here let me just don't want to be okay what if I'm a fanatic what if I go and claim I'm Healed and I die oh my goodness what will people think about me at that point I doubt if you're worried about what they're going to think about you but friends we're we don't you know we don't want to be too loud with our testimony we don't want to be too open with it because you know just in case that's Satan 's lie that's his thought he threw in there and you accepted it and it's got a nice little pretty potted plant growing there called Satan's lies you need to get rid of that thing yeah you need to get rid of it he says when the church disbelieves Satan and believes his spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her it is foreign you're going to pay for it friends God never sat there and said oh you're gonna get it your dad in my mind mom might have said that but God never said that to you he will bring the word and heal you he said yeah there's you know you report your soul but he doesn't sit there and try to bring some kind of threat you better be good come on it's not the way he treats his bride the only Power Satan has over you is when you accept his gospel any time when you have to accept it in order to have a bad attitude you have to accept it in order to get mad the wrong way in order to to to lie or anything that you do to be lazy these addictions you have to accept his life that that addiction is going to make you happier than God you have to believe that and when that stronghold has been put in there and Satan has access through that into that gate of your mind it's you have to have a deliverance from God because that can be so strong you can't overcome it in your own ability I'm not telling you that but God is here to tell you I have made this way for you and that's I'm going to reveal the word because he said the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the revealed work and so when God comes to you and says I have set you free and you believe that Revelation then you are free that's all it is friend it's just that simple you just believe what God said about you and that might not happen right away you might have to walk for the next week a month or a year or however long it takes but all you do is confess like God said about it and after a while that's gonna come to pass and it might happen immediately it might happen two years down the road but you're a Believer and so Saiyan goes down after doubt after doubt he says you're not healed yet you still have that complex you still have that complex you have to copy and all you do is say Saint I'm still healed shut up [Music] that's all you have to do friends it's really that simple anything else you're just complicating it it's not Christ Christ is known through simplicity he said remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit we're coming to the church and defile it making a lukewarm formal Powers how does he come into the church through thoughts the Antichrist Spirit can come right here and stand right there in the aisle he's totally powerless and he accepts his thought he ain't nothing to be afraid he not a book hey man he's a bluff all he is is the bluff because he cannot force you to take what he's got to sell you it's your choice it exposes Satan revealing his Works which is attempt to destruction God and the discrediting of God's word I don't Minister a couple days ago he said that attempted destruction he said we can't even accuse we cannot even bring charges against Satan for murder just attempt and murder because he can't destroy you he can't kill you he can't destroy you he can't drag you out of this church he can't force you not to be a believer well you're not a Believer well if I believe I am Satan shut up it's that simple you decide say he doesn't decide if you're a Believer or not you do right down to the tiniest cast in the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand he knows that the people gifted people get the true Revelation the true thank you church and what she is what she stands for she can do the Greater Works she'll be an invincible Army friends you are invincible Army when you deny Satan's his life brother Brian said that you are omnipotent he said we always bothered on everything he said don't you know you're omnipotent how do you do that if I believe and you get you let the word come in and you clean all those Gates out all those flus of the word in your mind and then the Holy Spirit can Express himself the way he wants to if they get the true Revelation the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit how do you just withstand it you just you just deny his thoughts just disbelieve him I'm gonna say it a hundred times today all you have to do is disbelieve Satan you want to walk out of here a Victor you just start right now by disbelieving Satan that's all you have to do I didn't feel anything he just say you're gonna feel anything do you believe him or not stop being a feeler be a believer he said when we just stand Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he'll be definitely forwarded to death Christ as soon as they're effort to get a power room in the desert Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation Our Lives against the hell cannot Prevail against him but we will prevail against them all you have to do friends is take God's word that he's revealed to you and stand on that that's all it takes it's all it takes it's really that simple foreign that word if you can get everything out of the way all conscious all senses and just let the word come in that word will produce just exactly see what it's covered over with you say well these conscious and senses so forth they don't have anything to do with their brother Branham certainly it does but if you let the word come in and cover it over with conscience then it can't grow what's he talking about condemnation you made a mistake yesterday didn't you if someone says no you just lied because we all made mistakes yesterday we answered it was nothing more than entertained Satan's thought for a while you know that thought comes in you can't help that thought come and then you don't have to entertain it you can recognize that Satan's thought and just ignore it it's like a rattlesnake just let it go and walk away it can't hurt you that's all and you just ignore it you walk away but probably some of us yesterday we entertained the wrong thought for a while and then what you had to do you had to repent you just said God I'm sorry unaccepted here's something else just a side note have you ever tried to convince God to forgive you oh if I praise this God please forgive me please he said Son you're wasting your time I already forgave you all I need you to ask for and accept it and move on you accept just forgiveness you accept his healing you accept it God says I all can do is point your Calvary God please forgive me he says there's Calvary remember the blood is still in effect do you still believe it do you accept I believe then why do you still begging me to forgive you for yes you have to ask for forgiveness but then you accept it because he cannot forgive you any more than he already has it's done the work is done my got off on that he said if you let the work come in and cover it over with conscious then it can't grow let me just read something here First John 3 20. it says if your heart condemn us God is greater than a heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God so when we accept the Forgiveness that God has for us then he comes and we can walk in confidence without that confidence you can't have faith in what God's doing for you care faith in God's word because that condemnation is barring it that condemnation is giving you doubt but when you're not walking in condemnation you can have faith towards God that everything is right between you and him you can't live with condemnation he said brother Phil I would be setting sin I do this over and over I had this problem over and over I can't seem to get over it well welcome to the human race we all struggle with those things friends brother Branham struggle with those things he said not the prophet oh please let him be a human being he had the same problems we have friends you're gonna have problems you got things you struggle with and God allowed that to happen for you to overcome for you to learn how to fight for you to learn how to resist Satan for you to grow up and to be someone he can trust with his word that's what it's for but what what happened so many times we let that condemnation just drag us right out of church and well I'm so backslid well why who are you listening to who did you have faith in you had faith in Satan's word that you can't overcome that you can't live good enough that you're just always going to be this so you always going to have problems you have Satan in his word why don't you turn around have Satan in God's word that says that's already taken care of yeah that's all he's asking for he said if it cover it over the conscience it can't go to be a deformed word do you ever see a good grain of corn planted in the ground let it stick fall over it grows crooked anybody anything that grows up will be will become something that has handed it because something has hindered it and friends you can look around and your brothers and sisters in church and you can see deform see I know this sounds terrible I'm not saying go on picking oh this person's got a problem you're not doing that at all but friends you can see people who are not walking in faith because they've been deformed they've been hindered by something in their life you're seeing they're afraid to raise their hand and praise God they're afraid to shine their prey to sing they don't want to con oh I'll be it I feel like a hypocrite if I start praising God if you just knew the problems I had if you knew the things I struggled if you knew what I did last week and yeah I can't just go to church and just praise God like everything is okay you know why you can't because you still believe Satan's lie you better believe you can come to church and if it makes you feel like a hypocrite that's okay go ahead and do it anyways because even the Hypocrites should serve God they should worship God let them do it friend I don't care because he's worthy to be praised and one day everybody's gonna kneel and worship him so you might as well go ahead and do it now stop letting Satan rob you because once God's wanted to do he said I want to set you free but when you're walking in that God of fear I can't do anything for you you have to confess my work because then I can be a high priest of your confession and if you had a horrible thing you did yesterday and you feel so wrong and you feel so condemned and you repent and you come to church and you raise your head I'll accept your praise because now you're working in faith you're walking in faith not in some kind of condemnation Satan's throwing at you stop walking in that condemnation that's your own self-pity that's your wrong idea your your Catholicism well I had to do some kind of penance I had to feel bad for a while you will feel bad and you should feel bad and at the same time you should repent and raise your hand and worship God because he's still worthy to be worshiped I don't care if you feel like a hypocrite or not you're not a hypocrite if you're doing it in faith stop listening to Satan's lies friends it keeps us it keeps us from our victory well when I start living good enough I'll start coming to church that's just that's criminally stupid friends you come to church this is the hospital this is where the healing takes place and you can come to the hospital but if you're an accepted the remedy the doctor gives you you're going to leave sick praise the Lord but if you will come and you accept what he's given which is the word preach to you you can walk out of here well you can walk out of your healed you cannot walk out of here delivered but you have to accept what's saying and Satan said well that's not for you well you know you're just gonna have a problem with you claim your field you claim your delivery you claim all this and kind but you know you go out and do it again you know what you say so what I'm still a believer there will come a time Satan when my foot will be on your neck and you will be done [Applause] you will be done that stronghold will be gone because I took God's word at it where am I at that's what matter what he said that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal faith today let me just tell you that's what's the matter with the message Believers faith today we let too many things hinder it the faith we've been taught the Holy Spirit that's been living in us we let too many things looking at somebody else the devil is always trying to point you to somebody's fair but he tries to keep away from the real testimony at genuine he had a testimony this morning the genuine when he was sent out I said man that goes right along with my notion by the way who was that I don't even know who God bless you both let me ask you something you who have been going here for last 20 years 10 years whatever what if you had to sit down and write up in a book all the things God has done in this congregation the Miracles Deliverance the healings the bap atisms all the stuff God has done and that you have a book that thick you can look at all the people that you're sitting here that you're going to go into church with for years I remember God did something in her life some of his life some of his life and again and again and again and you in your own life you'll have so many things that God has done you could write another book of Acts couldn't you is exactly right friends another book of Acts and it's right here and yet it's done so simple and so under the radar that would just go week to week week to week oh praise God God did this for that person praise God next oh God and now we're praying for this person and two weeks later oh God did that for that and then we just keep going we just keep going to Satan just gets that out of your mind so you don't dwell on those things but you know what we talk about uh brother so-and-so's back so they're not in church again today oh I'm just having a rough day your own confession friends Satan gives you thoughts God gives you thoughts but until you put him towards those thoughts are kind of powerless in a lot of way now they can have effect on you but if you don't put them to words there's a lot less power to it because God's coming to your confession not to your thought now you can confess it in your mind that's fine I'm not saying that but when you start confessing Satan's word it's like this let's say I get up this morning let's pretend I'm late for work I miss my my uh alarm didn't go off and my wife I'm not married I said pretending my wife kicks me out of bed just like go to work I hit the floor and on the way down I hit my head on the net and I stand up cabinet right so I got a bump on my head I got an ad because my wife came out of bed I go to go go out to my car my dog bites me I jump in my car on the way to work I get 185 speeding ticket I get to work I go through I'm five minutes late and I go through the front door and my boss just chews me up because I'm late for work and I go now I sit on my desk what a day and someone comes by says watch out man this is just a bad day it's only 8 35 in the morning I read it through the whole day away My Confession yeah I expect to be bad well plan on it your own confession is pretty much going to happen because you decided it's going to be a bad day you've read it through the rest of the day away because you had a rough morning but you know what you do as a Believer you walk in and you sit down you say all right let's get going here someone comes up to you man the boss was mad at you what's going on oh I had this oh my God my wife picked me out of bed I got a speeding ticket and all that but this is going to be one of the best days of my life yeah what a difference and you know why that person looks at you you're weird you say I've known that since I was 13. it's true we're throwing away we take Danville you know something bad happens well okay there it goes just throw it away God's sitting there thinking I will make this the best day of your life if you would just let me and you know what happens when that person needs something they come back they see something's wrong about that brother or that that man or whatever and then they have a problem they say hey excuse me can you pray could you pray for me could you have your church pray for me why because they saw something real they saw something they said how do you get so happy after that because I know Jesus Christ that's what it is and he makes a difference and that and that word goes to the office yeah he's kind of weird but at least he believes what he says he believes they see something real and it just might be that that person sitting over that corner of that Cube over the corner wherever you worked in that other machine they got something inside their heart that's looking for satisfaction and one time you're walking out of work and they kind of come up beside hey can I talk to you a minute you seem like you really well you know what you believe of you know being a Christian you seem like you got something real can you talk to me about that it's true friends that's the effect of the Holy Spirit through the bride shining a light mine then it's believed with the heart it comes through here friends and if those those of those channels are blocked off it can't come in and it can't come back out it's blocked off then the word of God becomes a reality when it's believed in the heart every sense of soul and body just scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up that nothing can come in the memory say well I remember Miss Jones try to trust God Miss don't try to trust God for healing with time and she failed but if that channel has been cleared out and then purged men filled with the inside on the inside of the holy spirit that don't even come in memory no matter how about Miss Jones she did it's you and God together nobody else but you two there you are they're your battle it's not what happened to your church that's not what happened to this person it's not what they're doing it's not what your mom or your dad or your husband your wife or anybody else said it's what God said to you and it's between you and him and nobody else is involved it's an individual walk and whatever he says to you that's what you believe and everything Satan brings against you to counteract that you dismiss that and that is your battle that is your battle brother bran says simple like this he's talking to someone I remember I don't remember the quote it up it was like this he said do you your back's like do you want to be back with God yes you're back wait a minute but what about what about what what about what Satan what else do you want me to try to do I've accepted that God done this for me I am no longer backslid and everything else is Catholicism friends penance there is penance done Jesus done all that on the cross he's paid for it he said kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his tracks and then how long you make the war linger and stop it right now if you'll come you'll keep their memories unconscious everything well I might fail it might not be right don't you do that you throw everything aside and open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet I cannot fail because I'm taking your word the old brother sister it's that simple you I don't care if you're 10 years old or 100 years old God speaks to you and you take his word and that's what makes a Believer and the gate to hell cannot Prevail against that faith if you will hold on to it Paul said if you hold your profession to the end Stand Fast in what God has said let that word grow he said what's the matter you have to open the Channel first you got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront to take God's word he has a word he stands there there's nothing going to stop it then there's nothing can every one of the other channels is cleared out how do you get incurred out you take the word against what Satan's saying you say but I have this complex that has nothing to do with you being a believer foreign let me say that again your complex has nothing to do with whether or not you're a Believer it's just a place where Satanist assaults you through you get in that gate and that that gate has worked you can get people he can get through there but when you take that gain you get that warp out of it and it's got to seal around it and you stand there and say it comes against you he can still throw that thought in there he can throw that in there but you let it go by you it's like throwing a snowball into hell it might it melts exactly a perfectly immediately it's that rattlesnake and you don't mess with it it's completely gone immediately because it can't hurt you if you don't mess with that thought foreign like an old boil where the flu stopped up you put a fire to blow your thing up that's a matter of so many so-called blowed up Christians they don't clean their channels out they're hedging their bets well I'm gonna go and listen to the pastor imma believe what he says you know I'm gonna say Amen but what if he's a little wrong what if this well what if I say that no what if what if I go ahead and try to be friends with this brother who don't want nothing to do with me and he just rejects me foreign what's that have to do with you you're not responsible for his attitude you're responsible for your own you're the problem not him that hurts my feelings I like to blame other people that's right that's right grow up that's what I tell God's saying Phil you need to grow up take responsibility for yourself stop blaming someone else yeah you got to clean it conscious memory thoughts laying aside everything coming from the inside out with the unadulterated word of God that's the truth no matter how ten thousand died on this side trusting listen to this if ten thousand died on this side today trusting ten thousand died on that side tomorrow trusting trusting that has nothing to do with me I'm the individual I'm the one that's trusting I'm the one that believes it brother Branham said a different time he said if one person you know one person out of your city is going into Rapture you have to know it's you that's got to be more than just something up to hear it's got to come from here because you see the word manifest through your life and you say this is Christ and me he can't take the pride without taking me because that's Christ that's the word we see back down and we if we went open though and say if we want to open up our channels and if we can see we find this one and that one this one that one thousands of them testifying but the devil tried to come right back see if he could get in there at all he's got your army rather than he's got your senses see taste feel smell here they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word imagination conscious memory reason affection they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it you both flew right quick your affection doesn't agree with the word let me just get a little bit personal for some of you young people you're looking for a mate someone to marry maybe as you get older if you're affection for that person doesn't go agree with the word get rid of her get rid of him if he's not a born-again Christian if she's not a born-again Christian you have no business even talking to that person about anything more than just trying to get him to Christ because you're going to find that that affection gets really strong really quick and the next thing you know you're having problems there's too many people in here can testify to that we all can we all can where am I at here here's the thought this is the key to the whole thing he only can attack you with a thought what is a thought Define it it's I mean can you hold it it's like like Brothers It's a seed that goes in there but it's just a thought it's just an idea it's not even a vapor you can't see it floating through the air it's just an idea that comes into your mind that's all he has he cannot force you to do anything he has no power over you except you accept that thought and act on it all he can do is stand aside and hurl thoughts into once you you possess that gate he can just throw thoughts in there and all you do is you just ignore him or if it's a strong something it's unlike like a a a addiction or something you take the word against that and you withstand that thought that's all he's got he can't make you do anything and yet we walk around like oh Satan's really got me going he's got me depressed he's got me down I'm sure having a bad day well yeah you are you accepted his thoughts I'm not saying to be some kind of Pollyanna oh everything's fine I never have a hard time of course you do friends everybody has hard times but what's your attitude going through that hard time because that's when you're molding your character because friends as long as you still take a do you know how attitude well I'm just going to get over here and pout and I'm gonna talk to them anymore you're not growing up very fast he gives you those things to go through to materials to bring us to a place where he can trust us with his word [Music] the authority of the word is incredible he's trying to get us to that point this these thoughts are not even a substance they're just something that it says like brothers said it's a seed but if you don't accept that seed it's not going to grow it's going to land use weed that thing out and let it go it's going to die they're only as powerful as we allow them to be Satan tells us something if you don't speak it and you just let it go powerless powerless say it again and again if you don't accept that thought it's powerless but when we have an addiction or we have a complex or something where he has a strong hold in there and we allow that to come in there then it becomes powerful that's what we need friends we need to get rid of those addictions we need to get rid of those strongholds we need to give those complexity because that's where he has access into our spirit realm and he makes health for us there that's right God wants to be free so how to go about possessing this am I about all the time let me let me take a few more minutes thank you this was quoted earlier for God hath not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and his sound mind that's a scripture God gave me years ago personally because I struggled with fear my whole life ever since I was a five-year-old kid I still do and I'm still free [Applause] he didn't give you a spirit of fear he gave you a spirit of power to overcome that to what is that power I might cast out Devils just start with his thoughts don't worry about casting demons out of someone else start with his thoughts in your own mind cast those out he gave the spirit of love because love casts out fear and a sound mind that means he'd give you a spirit to get rid of all those complexes and all that junk going on in there President says this I find out one of the greatest hindrances that the church has got today is they're scared to death and what are you scared of that's what I'm wondering he said what are you scared about that's what I'm wondering if you'll just only realize who you are you don't know who you are you don't know who is sitting next to you oh my this is good you say that's my neighbor I know him all right but he's a Son of God adopted by Jesus Christ into the family that's a daughter God's sitting next to you and who are you you are a Christian believer you're a son or daughter of God why are you scared about no need to be scared there's nothing to be afraid of if you realize who you are that's why he's constantly telling you you're the bride of Christ you're the bride of Christ look at the evidence look at the evidence that God living and you changing you making it to what you're supposed to be that's the Christ to this day that's the light of this world and then Satan comes along and get us some thought of fear and we latch on to that fear we forget Who We Are because he has so much evidence to back it up he gives all this evidence against you he gets thought thought and then he drops that in yeah but what if it's not really you you know if the Rapture went today you'd be in a bad place wouldn't you not near as bad as you Satan he said no need to be in being devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then friends he's got you when he has you scared that's all he has to do and as all the thoughts up here that bull came out brother Brown he changed his sons the Holy Spirit came he and love was projected and that bull went away friends when that said when those Devils come against you and that fun and that a dictionary thing if you would just focus y'all your your belief on God and hold on to that what he's revealed to you friends without thinking what could die and go away but here's what you have to do you have to Just Surrender it to God it's like God take this from me take this besetting sin take this away and believe he's going to do it and here's here's the problem this is where we had your best friend is because they take it away from me take it away from me but you you know I'll probably probably won't how many times you've prayed about that thing how many times have you come up in your pastor prayed about that thing how many times you've gone to God about that thing and yet you still struggle with it and what happens is I prayed and prayed God but I still struggle well how are you supposed to believe God when she has all that evidence against you who are you you can take Satan's evidence against that and say you know you're right I probably never overcome this I sure struggle with it God's gonna have to come down and just really smite me or do something no no you just start believing What God Says and you get to the point where you want to be set free you will surrender that thing to God without holding on to it you will God will bring it to that point and you'll surrender and you'll mean it and you'll know you will know I'm speaking from experience you will know when you really surrender that thing or not because when you don't you pray God I really don't want this I really don't want this but you're still holding on to part of it this is a personal thing when Jesus rose up he said fear not I am he that was dead in his life forevermore had the keys of death and hell he has the keys to your gate friends he already has it he said there's one of the greatest interesters in the church today among other people everywhere is fear love perfect love casteth out fear the reason you're fearful is going to hurt your feelings the reason you're fearful is because the right Temperance of love has never entered yet it's a lack of maturity friends we're still green we're still Junior High kids nothing against Junior High kids the one-year-old you know serving God you got to get past that when there's real love all fear passes away when you really love the Lord he says I'm not condemning you I'm only trying to bring something to life that you could look at he's not condemning us he said it's finished to be in the Christian church today that the greatest hindrance the Christian church has is fear just a Triad Christianity is not a trial it's a no-so it's something that is real you're not going to just try well I'm gonna try to overcome this I'm gonna try to pray through them no it's something that God has revealed to you it's a no-so and you just take God's word about that no matter what Satan comes against you you struggle with this for your whole life you've had this problem you've had that problem and yet you know the word of God and you claim the word of God over that thing and every time you fall to it you you claim the word of God until you quit falling to it there is Deliverance friend I'm not saying that oh you're going to have it for a long time you have these problems you're gonna fight these for a long time and you're going to have struggle with these things but their deliverance and even when that still is a weakness brother and sister you still are overcomer I'm gonna tell you something you might like to hear this about your profit your Prophet had a complex remember he said I developed a complex why because he said the people we're rejecting what I was saying he said I was going to go up into the Northwoods Canada Alaska and be a Trapper a God and then when God gave me a message to come back and say go back up there what's he trying to do escape from the people where did that come from as a kid he had been rejected nothing he did wrong but his name he had a bad name so no one wanted to be his friend he had a complex built up and when it happened all these years through this his ministry Satan was constantly hitting with that remember he said he walked through the parking lot one morning he saw all the license plates for all the different places people had come for he said now Satan if it's true nobody likes me why are all these people here he was finding a complex that God had that God had a lot to get into his mind as a very young kid when he was rejected for being a Branham and when he got older and the people were rejecting him what did he do he did this he did the same thing Samuel did when he was rejected he took it personal remember they wanted to claimer we want a king Simon was all tore up God said they didn't reject you Sam what they're rejecting me but Santa took it personal and when the people rejected brother Brown's message he took a personal in his mind and he's trying to have a feeling towards the people he said I lost my feeling towards the people I don't like hearing that about the prophet let him be a human being aren't you glad he had mistakes aren't you glad he was human what if he lived as Flawless and infallible as a lot of message Believers think he was where would that put you and I it's true friends this is who he was and then what did he say he preached he got on he told us all that right and after he said he said God said if you follow that your plan you're going to lose everything including your wife and he had learned obedience when he lost his first wife and yet what did he say then he said and I still have that feeling towards the people I still don't feel right towards the people so just because you know something is wrong doesn't mean that that complex or that stronghold is gone it's still there he said I need God to do something to get me back where I had that right feeling towards the people yeah it takes the supernatural work when there's a stronghold it takes God to do something like that he said pray for me that God will do this for me he did so every one of us probably this morning I hope God if you don't have any strongholds or complexes God bless you you're wonderful praise God but if you do friends God wants to set you free he wants to give you his word and he might give you the word that is going to take a week or two weeks or a year to get rid of it he might want to do it this morning I don't know and maybe you don't know but all he wants you to do is when that word comes he wants you to grab a hold of it and he speaks to you personally say that's for me that's all he asks you to do believe his word but Father Phil I prayed and prayed about this that's doubt when you had that excuse I prayed and prayed you're listening to Satan's doubt it's all it is and it extinguishes the faith God throws that word there believe what I'm telling you this morning he said I tried to believe before you can be free this morning I thought it was free before and with that attitude friends you will never be free because you're always giving credibility you're still believing Satan's gospel over God's gospel that's all addiction is Satan says I can make you happier than God follow this addiction follow this Addiction coming out like people think drugs friends there is addiction to Greed money power lust religion there's thousands of addictions to your own self there's lots of addictions the internet provides plenty brother said TV cell phones oh boy everyone runs to the altar yes I'm addicted to my cell phone dealt with kids was suicidal because their mom took their cell phone away this is real friend brother man said each age had this pressures for example a great burden of this last stage is a pressure of riches soft-living and nervous tension in a complex age we seem unfitted to live in he said that back in the 1960s what would he say today he's preaching he said how many of you are bound through the pressure of the enemy raise your hand if you feel the pressure enemy and your Abraham's seed he said raise your hand like this say brother Brandon I'm bothered with the nervousness he said oh there's about 80 of you with that in 1964. nervous tension that's Hearts failing for fear you see it all around you see people running to getting all kinds of medication and everything to drive deal with the stress that we're under let me go back to Second Corinthians though we walk in the flesh we do not walk with war after the flesh friends you cannot take to say well I'm going to do that I'm going to do it brother Phil I'm going to do it I'm going to reduce no you're not no you're not you're going to go to God and say God you promised this because you might go out of here and every time Satan throws a thought in your mind the rest of the day you get rid of it tomorrow morning you're weaker by tomorrow night your your complex is stronger than ever that stronghold stronger because you tried in your own ability to overcome you can't overcome Satan in your own thoughts he's been doing this for thousands of years he knows how to attack you he knows how to set up the situation where you're not going to be he said well you say I have to believe you do disbelievable but you also recognize it's the Holy Spirit you're taking God's word against the Holy Spirit has to do this friends you have to allow him to do it by believing in God's word you're not going to overcome Satan with your own ability he's going to try to get you to he's going to say you know what just try harder brother you just got to be more dedicated be more sincere you just got to pray more you just try it you find yourself defeated your own ability won't get you anywhere it's the holy spirit in you but when you recognize the holy spirit is in you you bring that Soldier say God I'm struggling with these thoughts right now I believe what you said I need you to come and take care of this and I can tell you from experience that Holy Spirit will never say throw that away get rid of that get rid of that and it will work and the way he deals with me on this is different than the way he deals with you and the way he deals with you and you and you because he deals everyone different with this because we're all individuals so you had to find out what works for you and how you're supposed to walk your own relationship with Christ for weapons of a Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down on the strongholds casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted this out against the notch of God bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ the Bible says you can bring into captivity every thought that means you can get rid of your complexes your fears your doubts you can get rid of all this and bring it all into captivity to The Obedience of Christ he said well well that's the way it is why don't God just do it right away why don't he just come and just get rid of all this stuff for me because this is what you have to overcome he's not going to let you just walk into this look friends when you're when you're flu when your gates are all in your possession you're standing there and you possess those days the the how do I say this your omnipotence is right there at hand there's nothing to hinder your faith you can do anything you want you have unlimited power at your fingertips because there's nothing to bring doubt and if he does that brother Graham said power without character is satanic and he just gave us that before we have to carry to handle it we've been doing all kinds of terrible stuff we've been doing all kinds of things with the power of God you see people out there they work this you see like the the prosperity gospels and all that and they work this to an extent but brother sister we got as a bride of Christ we had the very word a very creative work in our fingertips it's on our heart and what we speak God will bring it to pass we have the saith the Lord or we keep still and here's why we keep still without it because we are the character to only do what he asks us to do we had the same testimony Jesus said I always do that which pleases the father and that's why sometime it takes a while to take God allows these things to go on because he's more than our character so that when he does clear that out and all your gates are completely in possession he says now whatever you say I'm going to bring it to pass that's our that's what we get friends that's what it means to be a bride in this age that's why we had the pure work is to affect that and abide because we had to have rapturing faith that's greater Faith than ever ever before this is Who We Are this is what God is doing for us he said God's provided place of safety God said the name of the Lord is the mighty tower the righteous run into Twitter safe as the time is in a time of sickness when sickness strikes the doctor says there's nothing I can do about it don't build up pressure let off the pressure call your pastor let him anoint you in oil and pray over you pray your face shall save the sick run off the pressure Satan says oh you got cancer you're gonna die you take the word says well if God wants me to die I'll die but if it's not his will I won't die and Satan you have nothing to say about it what do you do you go to God you find out what's his perfect will he says see to he says by my struts you're healed you're healed and you walk out of there and you tell everyone in the world I'm Healed and you're laying on your deathbed you take three more breaths and you're gonna be die and they say you have anything like to say I'm still healed because God said so careless Satan says that's just the atmosphere to see if you're gonna believe or not oh my let the pressure off quit listening to Satan's sauce that's what bring the pressure God never told you let me finish with this God never told you you need to worry the Holy Spirit never tells you you need to stop worrying about this you better start worrying you better be fearful he never did that and he spared that comes to you says that is a liar it's a Satan spirit and said that was trying to get you to lose your faith that's all it is I think I'm done friends praise the Lord yeah there's a sister for you you just said what other people were thinking thank you Jeremiah in 29 says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord lots of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end those are the thoughts God has for you anything against that is a lie well God's going to make you suffer this God's make it yeah you're going to suffer you're going to have tests you're gonna have trials but he has good thoughts towards us he's going to use that he's going to use those trials he's going to use all that to bring you to an expected end there's a purpose he's not the author of confusion he doesn't just throw trials out there just to have you suffer he says I have expectation for you I have something for you go ahead and Stan I'll read another quote here that was read earlier someone mentioned it finally Brethren whatsoever things are true what certain things are honest whatever is just pure horrible things of good report if there have been a virtue if there'd be any praise think on these things Satan can fill our mind with all kinds of junk sin could fill our mind with all kinds of fears and doubts things of the world some of you say well there's nothing wrong with it I'm not saying it's always wrong brother brother sister it's not always wrong but does it take your mind does it interfere with your relationship with Christ because that can be just as bad because you think it's okay and for one one person maybe what I'm doing is okay with me and another person for them to do it would be an idol because it's an individual thing it's an individual walk just you and God you can't look at someone else and judge yourself by how this person's serving God or how that person's serving God or what this person allows or that person allows it's your own walk and when you're honest with yourself which is hard to do sometime you know what's interfering with you and God between well I'm just playing basketball but Phil there's nothing wrong with playing basketball I used to love to play basketball unless it's interfering with the time you should be praying it's just the way it is friends you have to this is your walk personal walk this is just you and him but he's called you to this he didn't come this morning to condemn you he didn't come this morning to beat you down and say well you're just weak you're just a kid you're not mature he didn't come to do that but at all he come to tell you that you are his and he wants to set you free and all he's asking you to do is believe what he has for you to believe that person standing beside you they're a part of the body of Christ they're a child of God they have faith to believe you have faith to believe Satan likes to get in in our midst and and cause division get me thinking this about that person that sister about that person anything to call it division because then you have Strife you have all this this problems in the church but when you're in unity he has nothing to fight through brother Brandon said when someone comes into your church and starts causing problems don't take sides with them just love each other all that much more because Satan is easy to point out all the problems all the weaknesses we have when someone comes and says well you know this brother here you know I saw him get down at Walmart the other day you should have seen what he was doing I don't care what he was doing he's my brother in Christ if I need to pray for him I'll pray for him besides that don't expect you to throw a division between us I'm like oh my god you're kidding he did that that's just Satan there you stand this morning there stands the Church of the Living God I don't care what anyone else says what the doctor says what anything what the unbeliever says we're more than a match for anything that comes along do you believe that this body of Christ you're more than a match because individuals in it have a relationship with Christ you're not more than a match as a body with everyone just kind of joining the church but when you as an individual have your own relationship with Christ then you put that person with that person and that person you're more than a match for anything Satan throws against you we are Abraham's seed and we shall posestigate our enemy no matter what the enemy is God gave the promise that was theirs their possession healing is your possession salvation is our possession the Holy Ghost is your possession there's great thousands of preachers and so forth and glad today that says that's not so there's plenty of people say the message isn't true there are plenty of people say that word called there's plenty of people saying that we are completely deceived are you that's your own your testimony you and God your reason United to see you know you're not deceived because of Jesus Christ is revealed to you who you are otherwise you might be he said the way that the Seed of Abraham knows it so they Wade right in and possessed the gate to the enemy weighed right in and possess it go forward draw your sword and go fight start cutting up the devil just take God's word and go for what you have need of God said they would they believe it because it's a promise his seed shall possess the gates of the enemy then he says now you'll go to testings and trials you're testing at trials is to prove who you are friends if you don't have any tests to try to overcome you won't know who you are you wouldn't know what God has has planned for you wouldn't know who what what God wants to do to your life and so through the testing and trial you realize who you are and it gives you greater faith the brother earlier he went through a horrible hard test and look at what faith he's up here just testimony testifying and just having a big time the test is the greatest thing friends is that all right amen let's pray brother sister God got put on my heart to come and speak this and he put on my heart that he wants to set someone free this morning I'll just tell you what I don't know who it is I don't know what it is but he wants someone to take a hold of this word and be set free if you are that person then reach out you could come in the front we'll pray with you if you want to just reach out whatever God leads you to do God is here to take care of whatever you need his friend into your mind right now he's saying yeah but yeah but well this is not yeah but but you tried or you prayed or whatever but friends there's a time when you can reach out on faith and grasp a hold of it it becomes yours there's a time when you can reach out and say I believe it right now and that word is quickened to you and this is your day of Deliverance this is your day of healing this is your day when you can walk out of here completely free from that thing this is what you can do friends Lord G Jesus we're just grateful that you would come and bring your word we're just thankful that you would be so real that you would come and that just just the battles that we Face Lord Jesus every day we go through these things and we sometimes we feel so alone sometimes we feel that we're so weak we feel like oh Satan's just going to kick us over to the curb just any time and then you come with your word and you strengthen us you say hallelujah we say praise the Lord this is what God is doing in my life it's With God all along how we thank you for this Lord Jesus we bless your name We Praise You Lord we accept what you have said to us we see the the word in action in our lives and we look around we see it in action other people's lives around us [Music] we know that you are real we know that your word is real and all you ask is to do is only believe that's all we lost we ask you to do this Lord Jesus [Music]
