Let's sing Psalms 34 this evening. I sought the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from every fear. Those who look on him are radant. They'll never be ashamed. They'll never be ashamed. And this poor man cried. And the Lord heard me and save me from my eneies. The son of God surrounds his saints. He will deliver them. He will deliver them.

We certainly count it an honor to be here with you tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Come on, church. Don't be scared. I know I'm more than just a pretty face. So, we just we're we're glad to be back with you. It's been a few months, but we we count this as our second home. And it's always great to be here to to share what God has done and what God is doing. And we want to thank brother Thomas for the invitation to be back among you tonight and this week. And we bring greetings from our pastor, brother Tim, and the believers there at Evening Light Tabernacle. And so we just we look forward to what God has in store for us tonight. So before we turn to the word, let's just go to him in prayer. So, Father, we just bow before you tonight and want to say thank you for your grace to us, Lord. Lord, I believe each and every one of us tonight as your children, as sons and daughters of God, Lord, we can just trace our life, Lord, and look back over every step and know that God, you have been there each and every step of the way. You've never left us. You never failed us. You never forsaken us. You never abandoned us, Father. But you have been the one who has kept us by your grace. Lord, we just ask tonight you would just come, Lord, and remind us of the great things of God. What you have done, Lord, in our lives, in our families, in our church. Speak to us through the word tonight, God. May you just refresh us, encourage us, inspire us, Father, we ask it now in Jesus name. If you have your Bibles tonight, we want to look here in 2 Timothy 4 and verse 6. We're going to read down through verse eight. And I want to speak to you on just just shortly here just for a little bit tonight. Uh reflecting back but looking forward. Reflecting back but looking forward. Now that that kind of sounds difficult, doesn't it? But it's not really. So we're just going to see how the Lord will lead tonight. It says, 'For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.' This is Paul speaking to Timothy. He says, "I have fought a good fight. I finished my course. I have kept the faith. Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them that also love his appearing." God bless you. You can have your seats. Tonight I taken a part a portion of this thought tonight and I'd actually spoken on our New Year's night and Lord had given it to me. But since then we kind of added some some some other things that God had kind of directed us as far as looking back over our lives but also looking back with a purpose of moving forward. And I think it's it's crucial for us as believers, as Christians to to look back to see what God has done for us. And we find here Paul, he has had a long ministry and he's looking back over his life and he's coming to the time where he's ready to cross beyond the curtain of time. and he begins to reflect back over the things of his life to you know the ups and downs to the many victories and no doubt he would recall the time brother Josh where he sat at the feet of Galia the great teacher and learned the wonderful things of God when it comes to maybe the denominational viewpoint or you know Paul were to reflect on maybe some difficult times where he persecuted the church and you know the times where he was in errand he failed the seed of fulfillment of the word he he missed Jesus's coming because he was perseccuted cuting the body of Christ. And no doubt he thought of many of battles just like we fight battles. And some of his battles he had chains on his wrist. Other battles he had were hidden places of his heart because of things that laid in his past. And Paul WOULD BEGIN TO REFLECT BACK OVER his life and you know where where he had come from. But he wouldn't just stay in the past. And we find that a lot of us, not maybe not us here tonight, I hope not, but a lot of people seems like they can't move from past failures or past mistakes. And it seems like the only thing that they CAN RECALL IS WHAT'S HAPPENED in the past. But you NOTICE WE'RE NOT TO DWELL IN THE PAST. WE'RE NOT TO LIVE IN THE PAST, BUT WE CAN REFLECT ON GOD OF THE PAST. GOD SAW ME THROUGH THAT VALLEY. GOD LIFTED me through THAT TRIAL. GOD HEALED ME FROM THAT SICKNESS. GOD DID THESE WONDERFUL THINGS IN MY PAST, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LIVE IN MY PAST. I'M MOVING FORWARD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SAME GOD THAT WAS IN MY YESTERDAY IS GOING TO BE THE SAME GOD THAT'S IN MY NOW. HE'S GOING TO BE THE SAME GOD IN MY TOMORROW. SO, I'M REFLECTING BACK TO MOVE FORWARD. &gt;&gt; PAUL PREACHED roughly 33 to 34 years since his conversion. And no doubt in that time frame he had a lot of experiences, a lot of ups, brother Tommy, a lot of downs, you know, a lot of victories and a lot of disappointments. You know, he he too experienced the hurt of men walking away from him. &gt;&gt; He dealt with church splits. We think about the great Apostle Paul. He didn't have to deal with that. But notice we find he dealt with church splits within the Corinthians there where members of they ALIGNED THEMSELVES WITH DIFFERENT FACTIONS LIKE A PAUL AND I'M AN APOLLOS AND I'M A PETER and they WERE CREATED QUARRELS ABOUT WHICH ONE WAS THE GREATEST AND WHICH ONE WAS THE ANOINTED AND WHICH ONE WAS THIS AND WE SEE THAT THEY BEGIN TO PULL TO THE SIDE AND INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING WITH the the promised word of their day &gt;&gt; but he also experienced the joys of new converts men and women grabbing hold of the message that he preached on fire for God. Taking this word that Priscilla and Aquilla and moving on and preaching the gospel and spreading the good news of what God has done and what GOD IS DOING. PAUL KNEW ALL ABOUT THOSE THINGS. And I want YOU TO KNOW TONIGHT, WE CAN ONLY KNOW WHERE WE are by looking to where we have been. by reflecting back where our journey started. And I'll say this tonight, whether you're a young person, whether you're an old person, you must have a starting point. &gt;&gt; Gideon, you're not on the front row tonight. Mom and Daddy wouldn't let you come up here, huh? I'm not even going to call you out tonight. But we find that we all must have a starting point. And it does us good, church, to look back over that initial moment where you started your walk with the Lord. That Christian journey of yours, it's filled with many facets, good days, bad days, ups and downs. But through them all, brother, God remains constant. &gt;&gt; I recall when I first got saved, I wondered, how in the world am I going to be like that brother there or that sister there? How are the fruits of the spirit going to flow out of my life? I know some of you got your wings. You're sitting on them right now. &gt;&gt; Well, some of us didn't have wings when we were born. &gt;&gt; Oh, you had a temper. You had aggression. You had hostility. YOU HAD A UNGODLY NATURE. AND I JUST THOUGHT TO MYSELF, HOW AM I EVER GOING TO CONFORM AND BE THIS PERSON? BUT I REALIZED, BROTHER TOMMY, THE MORE I SAT THERE, THE MORE I READ MY BIBLE, THE MORE I PRAYED, THE MORE I WENT TO CHURCH, THE MORE I SURRENDERED TO GOD, AND I WOULD REFLECT BACK A YEAR LATER AND I WOULD THINK, "MY GOODNESS, LOOK WHERE I HAVE COME. THESE THINGS THAT USED TO TROUBLE ME, THESE THINGS THAT USED TO HINDER ME, THEY'RE NO LONGER HINDRANCE IN MY LIFE. GOD HAD MOVED ME PAST THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; I WAS UNAWARE OF WHAT GOD HAD DONE. BUT BY REFLECTING BACK, I CAN SEE THAT GOD WAS IN IT. GOD BROUGHT ME THROUGH THE VALLEYS. GOD BROUGHT ME THROUGH THE TRIALS. GOD BROUGHT ME THROUGH THE UNGODLY NATURE AND THE CHALLENGES THERE. &gt;&gt; And he BEGAN TO MOLD AND FASHION AND SHAPE AND CREATE A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; GOD DOES THESE THINGS. AND I CAN LOOK BACK OVER 26 YEARS OR OF MINISTRY AND YOU KNOW 29 TO 30 YEARS OF BEING A CHRISTIAN AND I CAN SAY TO YOU TONIGHT, I'M NOT WHAT I USED TO BE. &gt;&gt; LIKE THAT OLD COLOR SISTER, SHE SAID, I I'M NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE. I'M NOT WHAT I OUGHT TO BE, BUT I SURE AIN'T WHAT I USED TO BE. AND I HOPE YOU CAN SAY THAT TONIGHT. I MAY NOT BE WHAT I SHOULD BE. I MAY NOT BE WHAT I OUGHT TO BE, BUT BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. I'M NOT WHAT I USED TO BE. GOD HAD BROUGHT US TO THIS PLACE. WOO. And I don't WANT YOU TO JUST THINK THIS PLACE, BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT GOD HAS DONE here at ELT. &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD HAS DONE PERSONALLY in your life, in your family, in your marriage, with your children, in your church. &gt;&gt; That's right. SEE, YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT GOD DOES IN OTHER FAMILIES, BUT WHAT HAS GOD DONE IN YOUR FAMILY, in your life, in your ministry, reflecting back with the purpose of going forward. So, it's a nice thing to be able to look back and see that God had been there. And maybe some of you may be here tonight and maybe you've hadn't had that initial booster or start to your Christian walk, but look around. You see men and women who used to be exactly where you are pondering, is it for me? &gt;&gt; Can I live it? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You know, am I am I the one that's really called to live this message? and you know, believe this. I'm going to tell you now. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The answer is yeah. &gt;&gt; Just go ahead and put the DEVIL ON. NOTICE THE ANSWER IS YEAH. BUT I NOTICED THE THINGS THAT I USED TO STRUGGLE WITH, my nature, my temper and the aggression and hostility. My some of those things don't just all of a sudden fall off overnight. But by looking back to years and years and years of from my conversion, I can realize and I can say I'm not that. &gt;&gt; AND WE FIND IN 2 CORINTHIANS 11 and verse 24, PAUL NOW HERE HE'S BEGINNING TO look back over some of the hardships of his life and he would tell us OF THE JEWS FIVE times received I 40 stripes save one. Thrice was I beating beaten with rods. And once was I stoned. And thrice was I shipwrecked. At night and day have I been in the deep. In journeyings OFTEN IN PERILS OF WATERS, IN PERILS OF ROBBERS, in perils of my own countrymen, in perils of the heathen, in perils of the city, in perils of the wilderness, in perils of the sea, AND IN PERILS AMONG FALSE BRETHREN, in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness, and besides ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE WITHOUT, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches, So I looked it up. How many churches did Paul establish? He established somewhere between nine to 14 different churches and he had to care of all of them that they wasn't going off here and astray here. You know a pastor has enough headache with just one church. But Paul had churches spread out all through Asia Minor. And he says, "WHO IS WEAK? I AM NOT. WHO IS OFFENDED? I burn not. If I must needs to glory, I will glory in the things that concern my infirmities. SO WE FIND PAUL looking back and he realizes, we think, man, he's the first church age messenger. What it have been to been APOSTLE PAUL AND BY THE GLORY'S victories established in the gentile church, breaking forth the wisdom of God and letting them know that they're included in the the ministry of reconciliation. That not only was Jesus sent for the Jew, but he was also sent FOR THE GENTILE. BUT PAUL IS TELLING US THAT HIS LIFE IT HE ENDURED MORE THAN JUST THE GREAT THINGS THAT WE SEE. HE WENT THROUGH SOME HARDSHIPS. BUT PAUL DIDN'T DWELL ON THE HARDSHIPS. PAUL REFLECTED BACK ON THE HARDSHIPS BECAUSE PAUL HAD A COMMISSION. AND EACH OF YOU HERE TONIGHT, WE HAVE A COMMISSION. AND IT'S ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LOOKING BACK TO STAY IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR, BUT WE'RE LOOKING BACK TO SAY, "GOD HAD BROUGHT ME THROUGH IT. IF GOD DID IT THEN, THEN GOD CAN DO IT NOW. AND GOT TO DO IT TOMORROW. IF GOD SAVED ME, GOD CAN SAVE MY CHILDREN. IF GOD HEALED ME, GOD CAN HEAL THE NEXT PERSON. Paul would say it like this. I see more clearly now than what I could see in the moment. You know, when you're in the moment, you don't see things clearly, &gt;&gt; right? because you're caught up with emotion and hormones and just everything hitting and flooding YOU. BUT PAUL WOULD SAY THE THINGS THAT I THAT THAT YOU KNOW NOW LOOKING BACK I CAN SEE CLEARLY now what I couldn't see in the moment that it was God's power sustaining me and not my own power. A lot of times we think well we're, you know, WE'RE BARELY WE'RE MEN. GIDEON, WE'RE MEN. WE CAN DO IT, but it ain't us in our human abilities. &gt;&gt; It's not how smart we are, how intelligent we are, how good-looking we are, or how not good-looking we are. Some of us just have to struggle through life. You know, how much hair we got or don't have, you know, I mean, you know, but it was God's power that sustained Paul in his journey. And it's God's power that sustains us in our journey. AND PAUL WOULD SAY, "I'VE KNOWN HUNGER, but I've also known abundance. I'VE PREACHED TO CROWDS that listen eagerly, evening like tabernacle. Then I preached to crowds that would drag me away and try to stone me. I planted churches with trembling hands, trusting the spirit to do what man can never do, and that's to transform hearts and to knit communities together and raise leaders from ordinary men and women and to bring churches together and people back together. God's looking at these things and Paul is saying, "This is what God has done." And you think, what does what does Paul cherish the most, brother Josh? Oh, truly it's it's having his name all over Asia Minor. Here comes the apostle. You know, Paul is different than men today. Men today, they want to they want to oversee all kinds of things and have their names on billboards and lights and, you know, be the who's who among the message or whatever it may be. AND WHEN MAN TAKES THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE toward the ministry, then that man has gotten out of line with the word OF GOD. BUT WE FIND THE THING THAT PAUL CHERISHED MOST. IT WASN'T THE MOUTHS THAT HE TRAVELED. IT WASN'T THE GREAT SERMONS THAT HE PREACHED ESTABLISHING DOCTRINES AND ORDER AND church leadership and things of that na nature. BUT THE THING THAT PAUL CHERISHED THE MOST WAS THE FACES OF HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS. &gt;&gt; PAUL LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF THOSE THAT HE preached to and he COULD SEE THEM GRABBING HOLD OF THE WORD. AND THAT'S WHAT PAUL CHERISHED THE MOST. IT WASN'T THE 14 CHURCHES, BUT IT WAS THEIR FAITH. IT WAS THEIR PERSEVERANCE. IT WAS THEIR LOVE. AND THAT WAS HIS CROWN AND his joy. And he could say it like this. I see now that it wasn't the fruit of my clever words. I didn't come to you with enticing words of man, but in power and in demonstration. See, Paul would say it again like this. It was never me, but it was Christ in me. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; SO WE FIND HIM HERE. He is sitting in a Roman cell, dim lit, maybe musty smelling, had a parchment before him, chains on his wrist, and he hears the distant sounds of the city. And all this he knows, I'm coming to my end. I don't have many more days ahead. They're going to crucify me. They're going to kill me. They're going to destroy me. But he reflects not on fame, not on accomplishments, not on the numerous churches that he's established, not on all the miles that he traveled, but he reflects back on it was never my strength that carried the ministry. It was always him. See, Paul no doubt remembers that infamous or maybe not even infamous, but the famous night or the night that would live in in his memory the most would be the night on his way to Damascus when he was ambushed by grace. And here he was going to persecute the church. And yet God overtook him and changed his nature and and took the one that would be a persecutor and now he would be a presenter of the gospel. Now he would be the one that would that would teach to Gentiles that they have a inclusion into the economy of God. You know he would remember, you know, the churches that he started with trembling hands, the nights that he spent in prayer, tears shed over believers that maybe he walked away from them. He remembers beatings and shipwrecks and hungers and loneliness. And yet through it all, it was God's power. And God's power was made perfect in Paul's weakness. And anytime we can humble ourselves to God and give God our weakness, God can become strength. Young people, I know young boys especially, one of the greatest things that you'll ever learn is how to submit your weakness to God. And let me tell you, we all have a different weakness. Some of you it may be vanity. Some of you it may be this or that or the other. But if you can ever surrender that thing to God, God becomes strength in your life. &gt;&gt; Paul, if he would speak to the church today, Brother Brad, I think he he would say it was like this. I was not the hero of my own story. God was always the hero. Christ was always the hero. And he would say,"I planted." Because part Paul had a part to play in a ministry. I PLANTED. APOLLOS WATERED. But only God made anything grow. God gave to increase. Every step I took, every sermon that I ever preached, every soul that was ever transformed, it was not because of my intellect and my great abilities, but it because Christ was in me &gt;&gt; and he was manifesting his life through me. And we can go a lot of places in life and we can do a lot of great things, but it's only those things that we do for Christ that's going to last. CT Stud will say it like this. There's only one life to assume be passed, and only what's done for Christ will last. Oh, you can you can do a lot of great things, but it's what we do for Christ that's going to last. And here he is at the end of his road, not boasting on his churches, not boasting on his sermons, not boasting on the miracles, not boasting on all these things that he as a man had done. See, his confidence didn't rest in his own abilities. You know, Paul never pointed man to himself. He never pointed man to his ministry. He never pointed man. He always pointed his believers to Christ. But here he finds his confidence rest in one thing that I have fought a good fight and I have finished my race. But more than anything, Paul would say it like this and I kept the faith. So through all the ups and all the lows, the difficult moments for the Glenn, the hard times, times where you question, can I make it? Paul said, I kept the faith. So he's looking back because he knows where he's about to head. Everything that he has given, all of his energies, 34 to 33 years of ministry, Paul is about to step into his reward. and he's reflecting back to move forward. And see, Paul's life reminds us that ministry is not measured by ease or success, but ministry, brother Brad, is measured by one thing, and that is faithfulness and endurance. faithfulness to the call, to the commission, and endurance to hold out even during difficult moments. See, Paul was saying, "It's God's grace that carried me, and the glory belongs to him alone. It's been never been about me." And if you look in different scriptures here, 2 Corinthians 5:20, Paul will say it like this. Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us. We pray you in Christstead be reconciled to God not pointing man to himself. Then we find in Romans 1 1-5 there Paul declares his calling as an apostle set apart for the gospel receiving grace and apostilhip to call Gentiles to obedience through faith. Notice he's not saying this is all about me. But God is using me in this ministry for the Gentiles. Then we find in Acts 20 and 22 and 24 Paul speaks of his desire to finish his course and ministry testifying to THE GOSPEL OF GOD'S GRACE THROUGH his his expects of suffering. And then in 2 Timothy 2 and2 he instructs TIMOTHY TO ENTRUST THE GOSPEL TO RELIABLE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE QUALIFIED TO TEACH OTHERS highlighting equipping future leaders. Notice Paul is TELLING IT AIN'T ABOUT ANY ONE MAN, BUT PREPARE THAT GENERATION FOR THEIR TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; And that's WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE'RE NOT PREACHING ABOUT OURSELVES AND YOU GOT TO GET MY TAPES AND YOU GOT TO BE UNDER MY MINISTRY AND IT'S ALL ABOUT ME ME. IT AIN'T ABOUT ANY MAN, BUT IT'S ABOUT CHRIST. AND IF WE CAN TEACH THE NEXT GENERATION AND POINT THE NEXT GENERATION TO THAT SAVIOR, TO THAT HEALER, TO THAT REDEEMER, THEN WE HAVE DONE OUR JOB AS APOSTLES OF GOD. WE HAVE DONE OUR JOB AS MINISTERS, AS MOTHERS AND FATHERS TO MAKE SURE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY GET BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THEY HAVE AN ANCHOR, SURE AND STEADFAST. IN THE HIGH TIMES, THEY REJOICE. IN THE LOW TIMES, THEY REMAIN FAITHFUL. &gt;&gt; That's what it's about. We look in numbers here. We're going to take a little detour just for a second to kind of catapult us forward here. NUMBERS IN 21 AND5 SAID, "THE people spake against mo against God and against Moses. And wherefore have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?" Could you imagine being a part of that two million? Man, my old nature would have kind of reared up. I'd have punched some people for Jesus. He wasn't even around yet. Well, BUT HE THEN NOTICE, "WHEREFORE HAVE YOU BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT TO DINE WITH US? FOR THERE IS NO BREAD, NEITHER IS ANY WATER, AND OUR SOUL LOATHE this light bread." I'm like, "Joker, you better BE GLAD YOU GOT SOMETHING TO EAT." I wouldn't had a time, me and Moses, we we would encourage one another all the more. AND THE LORD SENT FIERY serpents among the people and they bit the people. And much people of Israel died. Why? Because of their rebellion. Because they failed to reflect on where God had brought them from. And all they could do is murmur and complain in the moment. &gt;&gt; Because they failed to see that God's hand had been a part of their lives. What am I saying? Be careful how you complain. Be careful what you're murmuring about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT BACK ON where you used OH, I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE not in a difficult trial, but you're not where you used to be. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You're not in Egypt anymore. &gt;&gt; Come on. WE HAVE COME OUT OF EGYPT. WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER THE SLAVE, THE TASK MASTERS ANY LONGER, BUT NOW WE'RE UNDER GRACE. GRACE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOTICE IN IN IN NUMBERS 21 AND VERSE 8, "AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES, MAKE THEE A FIERY SERPENT, AND SET IT UPON A POLE, AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT EVERYONE THAT IS BITTEN, WHEN HE LOOKTH UPON IT SHALL LIVE." AND MOSES MADE A SERPENT OF BRASS, AND HE PUT IT ON A POLE, AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT IF A SERPENT HAD BITTEN ANY MAN, WHEN HE BEHELD THE SERPENT OF BRASS, HE LIVED. AND BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TAKE A MESSAGE, AND HE WOULD PREACH, "LOOK AND LIVE." OH CHURCH, WHAT AM I TELLING YOU TONIGHT? LOOK BACK ON WHAT GOD HAD DONE, BUT LIVE FOR TOMORROW. DON'T STAY IN YOUR PAST. DON'T DWELL IN THE AND THE MULLY GROWTH, BUT LOOK AND LIVE. SERVE GOD FAITHFULLY TODAY. PEOPLE ARE SO EASY TO FORGET about what had got done when they're all caught up in all the emotion and all THE PRESSURE. GOD BROUGHT YOU OUT OF EGYPT. THAT'S WHAT GOD HAD DONE. GOD HAD DELIVERED THEM FROM THE FLESH POTS AND THE MUD PITS AND THEY STILL COMPLAINED AND THEY STILL REBELLED. SO GOD sent fiery serpents to get their attention. Maybe that's why maybe that's why some of us are in the trials we're in God trying to get our attention. &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice God never changes his medication. If the word worked then and the word works today, &gt;&gt; we can't stop the serpent bite. But God had provided us a remedy to inoculate us from the bite. &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Bam says here in the brass serpent. He says, NOTICE NOW THAT THESE PEOPLE HAD TO LOOK OR BEHOLD THE BRASS SERPENT AND THE SERPENT COULDN'T PRAY FOR THEM. THEY JUST HAD TO LOOK and live. AND IT WAS, HE GOES, IT WAS THAT FOR A COMPOUND REASON. TAKE AWAY THEIR SIN AND HEAL THEIR SICKNESS. THEN HE SAYS, "AS MOSES LIFTED UP THE BRASS SERPENT IN THE WILDERNESS, THE SAME REASON MUST THE SON OF MAN BE LIFTED UP." AND IF THE TYPE DONE THE HEALING, THEN WHAT ABOUT THE ANTI-YPE? &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON. I DON'T THINK YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID. IF THE TYPE DONE THE HEALING, THEN THEN WHAT ABOUT THE ANTI-YPE TODAY? IF A BRASS SERPENT CAN HEAL IN THAT DAY, THEN WHAT ABOUT THE REAL LIFTING UP? WHAT ABOUT THE REAL SACRIFICE? WHAT ABOUT THE REAL HEALER? AND I CAN POINT YOU TO JESUS CHRIST TONIGHT. AND YOU LOOK TO HIM, YOU'LL LIVE, CHURCH. YOU WON'T LIVE IN YOUR PAST. YOU WON'T LIVE IN YOUR FAILURES. YOU WON'T LIVE IN YOUR MISTAKES. BUT YOU WILL LIVE IN GREATNESS. YOU WILL LIVE IN A FUTURE, A HEAVENLY KINGDOM. You will live WITH HEALTH IN YOUR BODY. YOU WILL LIVE WITH A MARRIAGE THAT'S STEADFAST. Thank you, brother Brad. Probably if I put those on, I can see what I'm preaching. You will live &gt;&gt; prod &gt;&gt; look to the promises of God. &gt;&gt; LOOK AWAY FROM THE TRIAL. LOOK AWAY FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE. LOOK AWAY FROM THE CONDITION BUT LOOK TO THE PROMISE AND LIVE. May we never forget at even light tabernacle here in Elkton what God has done for us. Reflect back. I want you to just for a minute personally reflect back to what God has done for you. No more casinos. &gt;&gt; No more gambling. No more wasting money. Oh, you had some time. You cashed in. There's a lot of times you cast out, but look forward to to where he's taken us. Maybe look back to where he's brought you from, but look forward to where he's taken us. &gt;&gt; He's taken us out of our Egypts. And every one of us has had a different Egypt, &gt;&gt; but we all have the same future. He's taking us out of our Egypts and bringing us into his kingdom. Man, think about a new body. Hallelujah. I could use one right about now. A new body. WELL, AT TOMMY, ME AND YOU MAY NEVER BREAK 5'6, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE YOUNG AGAIN. 18 to 21. Man, you thought you was fit now. Now wait till you get in THAT BODY. A PERFECT BODY. NO OLD AGE, NO INFLAMMATION, NO HEART DISEASE. COME ON, SOMEBODY. NO EYES GOING DIM ON YOU, NO WAKING UP WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, NO SUGAR DIABETES, NO HEART TROUBLE, NO CANCER. I'M TALKING ABOUT A NEW BODY. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING. NO DISAPPOINTMENTS IN LIFE. NO FAILURES. NO MISTAKES TO BE MADE. NOBODY WALKING AWAY FROM YOU. NOBODY CALLING YOU NAMES. NO SOCIAL MEDIA POST. YOU DIDN'T GET NO LIKES. Cuz if YOU GET THERE, EVERYBODY'S GOING TO LIKE YOU. Matter of fact, everybody's going to love you. &gt;&gt; Oh, look where we're going. But it's so easy to get caught up in where we are. I posted on Insta. Ain't nobody like my stuff. I be real today and ain't nobody be real me back cuz they be false and I be real. But I want to encourage you as this starts, look or believe and live. Believe the word for you first. and live. Then believe the word for your family and live. Bleed the word for your circumstances and live. And believe the word for the situation you're in and live. See, Satan can throw you into the fiery furnace, but he doesn't control the outcome. See, we control the outcome by our faith, believing the word, trusting in a sovereign hand of God, by reflecting back on what God has done. If he was in my furnace, no matter what's in my future, God is there. &gt;&gt; I think about David. David went to Goliath. HE DIDN'T FEAR GOLIATH. LOOK, THE DAVID DONE FACED A LION AND A BEAR. AND DAVID DONE BEEN ANOINTED BY A PROPHET. DAVID KNEW THAT THERE WAS A THRONE HE WAS GOING TO SIT ON. THERE AIN'T ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL. IT WOULDN'T TAKE GOLIATH AND ALL OF HIS BROTHERS AND ALL THE ANAKANS ALL AROUND THE WORLD THAT COME AGAINST DAVID. DAVID WOULD HAVE ONE BY ONE SLEW THEM. WHY? BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ANOINTING ON DAVID. BECAUSE DAVID HAD BEEN PROPHESIED THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT KING. AND CAN I TELL YOU MY BROTHER AND SISTER, YOU HAVE BEEN ANOINTED BY A PROPHET. YOU HAVE BEEN ANOINTED BY A MINISTRY. WE'RE NOT MEANT TO GO DOWN. BUT WE ARE GOING UP. WE HAVE BEEN CALLED TO BE KINGS AND PRIESTS. WE HAVE BEEN CALLED TO SIT ON THE THRONE. BROTHER, SISTER, QUIT LOOKING TO WHERE YOU BEEN AND LOOK TO WHERE WE'RE GOING. GOD HAS CALLED FOR GREATNESS. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ANOINTED YOU FOR GREATNESS. DON'T BE sidetracked in the detours of life. Now, as we reflect back over 2025, I say we can say like Paul, I have fought a good fight. And I have kept the faith and we have fought some great battles, church. But the greater the battle, the greater the victory. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants a victory. Nobody wants to fight. Look, God put a sword in your hand there on Sabina Canyon. That wasn't just a sword. The the sword of the king wasn't just for brother Brandham. No, brother Brandon was a type of you and I. He was a He was a reflection of you and I. THAT WASN'T JUST A SWORD IN HIS HAND. THAT WAS THE KING'S SWORD, WHICH IS THE WORD OF GOD. IT WASN'T ONLY IN A PROPHET, BUT NOW IT'S IN YOU. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE A BRIDE ON EARTH. SHE'S GOING TO BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. WE HAVE TAKEN THE KING'S SWORD. WE HAD PUT IT IN OUR HAND. WE HAVE PUT IT ON OUR LIST. AND WE'RE SPEAKING OF PROMISES OF GOD, CHURCH. THAT'S WHO WE ARE. WE'RE NOT FAILURES. WE'RE NOT DEFEATED. BUT WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. WE ARE KINGS AND PRIESTS WITH THE WORD OF GOD GOING FORWARD. WE ARE PRESSING THE BATTLE THIS HOUR. And the greater the battle and the greater the victory. We've weathered storms. Storms of cancer raged in this church. But through it all, can I say it like this? We are still standing. &gt;&gt; Sister Donna, I know you're on the stream tonight. You're still standing. &gt;&gt; Some of you have been through some hard battles, Brother Tommy, with aneurysm, but you're still standing. See, it's been God's power working on our behalf to bring his desired purpose in our lives. And see, to know where you are, how many want to know where you are, then you must reflect back to when it started. Because if you're still at the starting point, you've not made any progress. And a lot of people around the message only thing they've ever heard was William Brandham. God sent a prophet. But it's more than just William Brandon. &gt;&gt; It's more than just God sent a prophet. God had called me his bride. See, you got to reflect back over your life, over your ministry, over the growth of the church. And only by reflecting back can you truly see how far you have come. Brother Brandham said he had a dream and he woke up and he had a dream and he looked down like on a map of Palestine and he noticed he had come twothirds of the way. BUT HE SAID ALL THE PROMISES of God lay just beyond the Jordan. What was it? The third pool or the third phase or the opening of the word? See, HE LOOKED DOWN TO SEE WHERE HE STARTED. AND BY ONLY SEEING WHERE HE STARTED could he truly tell where he was at. But he knew he was on the brink of moving into the third phase of his ministry. Oh church, we're not moving into the third phase. We are at the third phase. &gt;&gt; Brother B would tell us like this in the message shalom. He says, "Now today, as we face the new years, I want to think of not like the past, but I want to look to the future." SEE, AS PAUL SAID, "FORGETTING THOSE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE PAST, I press toward the mark of the high calling." Now, we're not trying to place the message today as though through a rearview mirror, it would IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG. SEE THE THINGS THAT THE LORD HAD DID AND YOU ARE ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THE GREAT THINGS that our Lord had been doing and it's some of the mightiest things I've ever seen in my life. He had just he just just passing in just the last few months. AND BUT NOW WE'RE THANKFUL for what he's been. But we're looking forward. See, he recognized notice this is in 1963. He just opened the seals. I say God used him. Let me say it like that. To open the seals and to preach great words. Words like Christ the mystery of God. Sermons like uh the token which outside of the opening of the seal is the most ordained message that he ever preached. And he said all these things, but you know, HE REFLECTED BACK, BUT he was saying we're moving forward to what God has for us in 20 or 19 and 64. And I say what God has had for us in 2026. Hey, brother Bam would say, "But did you ever know that if you keep looking back that way, you'll wreck?" How many's ever driven a car and you just look in the rearview mirror and you're going forward? Oh, let me not be on the road with you. See, what was brother Brandham was saying was is that our experience can't remain just there. People can only talk about there. What God did there 40 years ago there? WELL, WHERE HAS GOD DONE THROUGH THOSE 40 YEARS IN YOUR LIFE, you got TO BE PROGRESSING FORWARD. YOU GOT TO BE MOVING FORWARD. AND YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO HAVE AN UP-TO-DATE EXPERIENCE REFLECTING BACK, BUT MOVING FORWARD THE WHOLE TIME, EXPECTING WHAT GOD IS GOING TO DO AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT GOD IS GOING TO DO TOMORROW. BUT NOTICING WHAT GOD IS DOING RIGHT NOW. EVEN IN OUR SERVICE TONIGHT, GOD IS MOVING. GOD IS PRICKING HEARTS. GOD IS ENCOURAGING YOU. YOU'RE NOT WHAT YOU USED TO BE, BUT I'M TAKING YOU SOMEWHERE. AND IF I CALLED YOU OUT, YOU CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE. I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU IN. I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO FORSAKE YOU. I'M NOT GONNA ABANDON YOU. I'M GONNA TAKE YOU IN. He said, "So many people ride life's road looking through a rearview mirror, especially now, I don't mean to say this to hurt feelings." And this is Brother Brand, but many of our women, they're always when they're past about 30 years old, they want to go back and, you know, and be young, a young girl again, get about 50, and they still want the same thing. Not only that, BUT MEN TOO. HE SAYS, "BUT ANYBODY WHO looks through a rearview mirror is going to wreck up somewhere. You can't drive the road through looking through the rearview mirror." And today we have 50 year old, 60-y old women, lips all blowed out. I don't know how in the world they do it. We had to do Botox. They got their eyelids all botox. They look surprised every time you look at them. Face don't move. No wrinkles nowhere. trying to look like they're 30, 20 again, still embracing the phase of life that they're in. I said, "Man, my wife, we're going to grow old together. &gt;&gt; If I'm going to wrinkle, you're going to wrinkle. If I'm GOING TO GET FAT, YOU'RE GOING TO STAY SKINNY. Just kidding. Please don't get fat, though. But if you do, I'm going to love you anyway because we're going to grow old together. We're not going to fake this thing. We're not going to try to relive our 20s. No, we're going to embrace where God has us. He So, let's just for an instant, how much time do I got? My goodness, time flies by. I ain't even got to the meat of my subject yet. But let's just look for a minute. If we don't get there, that's fine. Tonight, I want to think about Elton Evening Light Tabernacle. Elton, Kentucky. 2025. Think about where is Brother Caleb and Sister Lisa. Caleb, you're here. Your wife's not here. Why? Cuz she's pregnant. Oh, yeah. I remember Sister Lisa coming up for prayer. I want a I want a child. We've not been able to have a baby. I said, give it a name. Call it a name. Then you had your special meetings and come through the prayer line right through the front asking for a baby after how many years, brother Caleb? Two, three years desiring a godly desire to have a baby and now they're pregnant. See what God has done in 2025. And see, we get so numb to it. Well, okay. Yeah, she's pregnant. Good. No, that's a miracle. This is what God is doing in your church. Let's hear another one. Brother Cody Blanger, is that how I SAY THAT CORRECTLY? WE ALL KNOW WHAT BROTHER Cody was. My goodness. I remember the first time I met him like, man, Satan walked on earth. Boy had long hair, didn't look like he wanted to be around none of us. And honestly, I didn't want to be around him. BUT WE FIND A PRODAL. HE WAS DELIVERED OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND WAS BAPTIZED JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. AND NOW HIS LIFE HAS BEEN TURNED AROUND. WHY? CUZ HE WAS AMBUSHED BY GRACE. BECAUSE A MOTHER DIDN'T GIVE UP CUZ SHE LOOKED BACK. IF GOD SAVED ME, THEN GOD CAN SAVE HIM. BECAUSE HE IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND TOMORROW. SHE DIDN'T GIVE UP. YOU MAY HAVE GIVEN UP. THE PASTOR MAY HAVE GIVEN UP. PEOPLE MAY HAVE GIVEN UP. BUT A MOTHER NEVER GAVE UP. AND NOW HER SON IS SERVING THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I SAY HALLELUJAH. CHURCH, DON'T FORGET WHAT GOD HAS DONE. &gt;&gt; Reflecting back in 2025. Notice what God has done. God has added church members. Brother Devin, Sister Jana moved all the way from Missouri. Could have picked any church. No, they couldn't. They were predestinated for this church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is where you belong. THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GROW. THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BLOSSOM. And then of all things, my first time coming here. Put my foot in my mouth. Brother Brad, you got any young girls at your church? I had to be done and show a picture of my daughter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You say, "Come on now. She's living five minutes down the road FROM YOU, NINE HOURS FROM ME." I showed the picture to brother Weston. I said, "You want to get married, YOUNG MAN? WHAT DO YOU THINK about I I could have Man, that dude didn't waste a lick. CAME DOWN IN JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS. I MEAN, HE DID EVERYTHING HE could with the help of his cousin. Hey, go buy her a drink. Go do this. Go do that. You better sweep her off her feet. Well, he swept her off her feet and married her, moved her nine hours away from me, but God added to the church. NOT JUST PEOPLE, QUALITY PEOPLE, &gt;&gt; SOLID BELIEVERS, NOT JUST RIFF RAFT OFF THE STREET, BUT GOD ADDING TO THE MINISTRY HERE AT EVENITE TABERNACLE. LOOK WHAT GOD HAS DONE. &gt;&gt; Then we got sister or brother Danny and your new wife, Julia, right, Julie. Excuse me. It said Julia. Somebody sent it to me wrong. I'm sorry. But you got another convert. Actually, you were before them, so I went out of order. My bad. Another young believer here. And then there's another brother wanting to move here, Austin Ventura. Is that right? Speak to me, Tommy. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we see God adding to the ministry, adding to the church. Then let's look healings that's taking place. &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy with an aneurysm said he would never lift over 15 pounds and would be on meds for the rest of his life. And today he can lift the roof off his house. And the only pill he's taken is the gospel &gt;&gt; because THE GOSPEL WORKS. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THE GOSPEL WORKS. YOU AIN'T GOT TO TELL HIM THAT GOD'S FALSE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO TELL HIM THAT. OH, YOU YOU THE THE DAYS OF MIRACLES HAS PASSED. HE IS A MIRACLE. NOT ONLY IN HIS HEALTH, BUT IN HIS SPIRITUAL LIFE. HE WAS GOING THE WRONG WAY. DONE A LOT OF BAD THINGS, BUT GOD PUT A PREDESTINATED SEED ON THE INSIDE AND TURNED HIM AROUND. AND GRACE AMBUSHED HIS LIFE. GRACE OVERTOOK TOMMY. AND NOW TOMMY'S ON FIRE. AND TOMMY'S MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WHY? BECAUSE HE REFLECTED BACK ON WHAT HE USED TO BE. AND NOW HE'S MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE THERE'S A KINGDOM TO BE HAD. &gt;&gt; We got Sister Donna's healing of cancer. Notice she wasn't given any hope, but every day she gets better and that cancer is shrinking. Then there's sister Parish's healing AND BROTHER JOHN LER'S BACK healed a sciatica. They said the only hope for him was surgery, but God came down. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING TELL YOU CHURCH, MAYBE YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT HAS GOD DONE FOR ME LATELY. WHAT HAS GOD DONE IN OUR CHURCH? I'M TELLING YOU WHAT HE'S DONE IN YOUR CHURCH. I'M TELLING YOU WHAT HE'S DONE IN YOUR HOMES. I'M TELLING YOU WHAT HE'S DONE IN YOUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; TODAY, you have an outreach team and a prison ministry. &gt;&gt; MEN OF GOD GOING TRAVELING TO GET IN THESE PLACES TO SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS, THE GOSPEL. And you got a church family, a unity that's closer than you've ever been before. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Come on. Closer than you've ever been before. YEAH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL REJOICE BECAUSE 2025 IS NOT JUST A STANDARD. WE'RE GOING FORWARD, CHURCH. WE'RE NOT REGRESSING. WE'RE NOT GOING BACKWARDS, BUT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. WHAT GOD DONE THIS PAST YEAR, I SAY LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO TOMORROW. WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO THE NEXT WEEK, WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IN THE NEXT SERVICE. WHAT IS GOD GOING TO DO IN 2026? &gt;&gt; I SAY, LORD, BE IT UNTO ME IN 2026. LET THE POWER OF GOD FALL. LET ME WORSHIP GOD UNRESERVABLY. LET ME BE RELENTLESS IN MY PRAYER LIFE. 2026, watch out. &gt;&gt; And think about it. It ain't because it's all been about one man. Paul said, "I planted." And you have a pastor here for 30 something years been planting and planting and planting. Let me tell you, there's been a lot of scorching summers, but plant, a lot of failed crops, but plant and plant and plant and plant year after year. No help. No support. Come on. Plant, plant, plant, plant. LAY THE WORD, LAY THE WORD, LAY THE WORD, LAY THE WORD. BUT WHAT HAPPENED? THEN THERE COME APOLLOS. THEN THERE COME A BREAD. THEN THERE COME ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER ONE. WHEN THEY DO THEY BEGIN TO POUR THE WATER ON IT. &gt;&gt; I PLANTED BUT APOLLOPS WATERED AND THIS ONE WATERED AND THAT ONE WATERED AND THAT MINISTRY HELPED AND THAT MINISTRY HELPED AND YOU HAD AN ANDREW SPENCER AND YOU HAD A MATT MCCCLARD AND YOU HAD A TIMOTHY PUIT AND YOU HAD A JOE ADAMS AND YOU HAD ANDREW GLOVER AND YOU HAD THIS ONE AND YOU HAD THAT. WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY WATERED AND WATERED WHAT WAS BEEN PLANTED, BUT GOD GIVES THE INCREASE. CAN YOU HEAR ME TONIGHT, CHURCH? GOD GIVES THE INCREASE. IT'S NOT ABOUT MAN. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME DOING IT ALL MYSELF. IT'S ABOUT GOD GETTING THE INCREASE. He would tell us in 1 Corinthians 3:6, "I have planted and Apollos had watered, but God gave the increase." So, we look back and we see 20 men of God who's labored, Brother Thomas and Brother Brad labored among you for years laying that word again. Then you started inviting ministry, different ministry, outside ministry, outside ministry, because you know what? They can't do it all. There's people sitting right here tonight that Brad Pow will never touch because his gift is not given to you that way. But there's people here tonight that Brad Pow ministry will touch. There's people out there in other churches that that ministry was given for that would impact their lives. The same way with Thomas Ber, there's people sitting here that maybe his ministry will never touch even as a pastor. That's why God said a five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Some apostles, some prophets, some teachers, some evangelists, and some missionaries because it's going to take the entire solidity of the the five-fold ministry to edify the church. &gt;&gt; Because some of you are gifted or you're maybe you're pulled to a certain gift in a certain way. Some of you love fiery preaching. Y'all need to say amen right there. &gt;&gt; Mercy. Do I need to come out there and amen my own preaching? &gt;&gt; But some of you love teaching that just grounds you and establish you. Amen. Come on. That's okay. And then we love the prophetic ministry. Well, God sent us a prophet. And we love missionary reports. What God is doing in other lands. See, it takes it all. &gt;&gt; But a pastor plants and plants and plants and plants. And guess who gets somewhat of the victory or the glory? The evangelist. He only comes behind the pastor and he's just pouring water on it, saying the same thing, maybe in a different way, and everybody goes crazy. And it looks like, oh my, what that evangelist boy, he just knocked the socks off to people. know Paul planted Apollos water but God give the increase. Listen what he says. Paul says in verse 7, I'm not going to hold you much longer. He says, "So then neither is he that planteth anything and neither is he that waterth." And if men would keep that kind of mindset, it's not about me. It's not about my gift. You know, I've stepped out tonight. There's never been a time that I've ever preached that I've never felt insufficient for the duty. And if I ever get to thinking that I'm able to do it in my own human abilities, then I need to step down because it ain't about our human abilities. And he would go on to say, but God, it's God that gives the increase. So now, he that planteth and he that waterth are one. Oh. So the evangelist and the prophet and the preacher and the missionary and the pastor, they're what? They're one ministry, one purpose for the edifying of the church. Let me put my glasses on here, boy. Now, he that planteth and he that walth in one, and every man shall receive of his own reward according to his own labor. For we are laborers together with God, AND YOU ARE GOD'S HUSBANDRY. YOU ARE GOD'S building according to the grace OF GOD WHICH IS GIVEN TO ME AS A WISE MASTER BUILDER. I have laid the foundation, but another buildeth their own. SEE, PAUL, EVEN THE GREAT APOSTLE PAUL, THE FIRST CHURCH AGE MESSENGER, KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T do it all himself. He needed to support ministry. I thank God for a man like this that can look back say it ain't all about me. I need help. I need a Brad Powell in my corner. I need a Joe Adams in my corner. I need Timothy Puit. I need whoever put Wayne Lawson and put these great men of God. Put them there. I need them in my corner. Why? Cuz I'm going somewhere. &gt;&gt; And a pastor realizes I can't do it all. Then he goes in uh verse 21, therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours whether Paul or Apollos or Cphus or the world or life or death or things present or things to come. All are yours and you are Christ and Christ is God. So we find today that the message is not about any one man. No bishops. Paul didn't set up bishops and hierarchies in the ministry. FFO ministry for the edifying of the church and I'm honored to come and stand with you tonight and with brother Brad and brother Thomas and to stand with my brothers and sisters and not only call you brothers and sister but call you friends &gt;&gt; to stand with you as we move forward. I love how it says here and I'm going to bring this to a close and I really wanted to get to this whole part but I'd be here another hour and we ain't got time for all that. But he says in Philippians 3:11, "If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead." Now this is Paul. Now he's preaching to the Philippians here. He was just talking to Timothy in a personal note talking about the time of his departures at hand. And then he says, "Not as though I had already attained or either were ALREADY MADE PERFECT, BUT I FOLLOW AFTER THAT IF THAT I MAY APPREHEND THAT WHICH I am also am apprehended of Christ Jesus." See, he realized he hasn't already attained. Paul was striving FOR A PURPOSE. PAUL WAS STRIVING FOR A GOAL. AND YET, HE SAYS, "I'VE NOT REACHED THAT GOAL." BUT YEAH, YOU'RE THE GREAT APOSTLE. YOU'RE THE GREAT CHURCH AGE MESSENGER. BUT PAUL WAS SAYING, "I'VE NOT ATTAINED YET." THERE WAS ONE GOAL, ONE DESIRE THAT PAUL HAD. PAUL AND HIS PEOPLE WERE WAITING ON JESUS'S RETURN. THAT IN A MOMENT, IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE, THEIR BODIES WERE GOING TO BE CHANGED. BUT THAT WASN'T FOR PAUL'S PEOPLE. THAT'S FOR US IN THIS HOUR. AND PAUL SAID, "I'VE NOT ALREADY TAINTED." BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A PEOPLE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A PEOPLE ALIVE AND REMAIN THAT ARE THERE AT THE COMING OF THE LORD. AND THEIR BODIES WILL BE CHANGED AND THEY'LL STEP OUT OF THIS PEST HOUSE AND STEP INTO A NEW BODY. OH, CHURCH. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PUSHING FORWARD FOR. WE'RE LOOKING BACK. HE WAS FAITHFUL THEN AND HE'S FAITHFUL TO THE BODY CHANGE. ONE thing have I desired. &gt;&gt; Psalms 27. One thing have I desired and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord in the secret of his tabernacle. And the prophet would preach the rapture message because he's telling only one thing. Don't busy yourself with the cares of this life. Don't busy yourself with social media and getting all hurt and depressed and down and oh, don't get all worried about wars and rumors of wars. One thing have I desired. Listen what Paul would say in Philippians 3:13. Brother, I count not myself as to apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting the things that were in behind. NO, HE FORGOT EVERY SORROW. HE FORGOT EVERY DISAPPOINTMENT. HE FORGOT EVERY FAILED RELATIONSHIP. HE FORGOT EVERY TIME HE WAS UNFAITHFUL TO GOD. PAUL FORGOT ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND HE PRESSED ON. YOU CAN'T LIVE IN YOUR PAST, BUT YOU CAN PRESS THE BATTLE, CHURCH. YOU CAN PRESS THE MARK OF THE HIGH CALLING &gt;&gt; AND PUTTING THOSE THINGS THAT WERE BEHIND YOU. LEAVE THEM IN THE BEHIND, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into the things that are before. Paul had one great aim and one solid purpose. He wanted a body change. What about us? Well, I want to get married first. Uhhuh. Some of YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, JUST HOLD ON, LORD. I WANT TO GET MARRIED FIRST. I WANT TO DRIVE. I WANT TO DO THIS. I WANT TO HAVE A WIFE. I WANT TO HAVE A HOUSE. NO, YOU DON'T. IT SOUNDS GREAT, AND IT IS, BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, HIS COMING IS MORE GREATER THAN THAT WIFE OR THAT HUSBAND OR THAT HOUSE OR THAT CAR. LET ME TELL YOU THE GREATEST THING THAT WE CAN DO IS RECEIVE A BODY CHANGE. I SAY IF THE LORD TAKES HAVE THAT HUSBAND, HAD THAT WIFE, HAD THAT CAR, HAD THAT HOUSE, BUT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE JESUS. &gt;&gt; One thing Paul didn't attempt to mingle the world with religion to GAIN BOTH. NO, PAUL WAS STEADFAST. His whole singleness of purpose was to receive a body change. And the Bible would tell us, he would tell us in Hebrews 12 to lay aside every weight of sin, every weight and every sin that so easily beset us. And let us run in 2026. Church, can we run? Can we run like we've never ran before? Can we press the battle? Paul would say it like this. I press. Just a couple weeks ago, my daughter and I, Rebecca, we were in New York City and we were around Rockefeller Center where the big Christmas tree IS LIT UP, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. AND we had one place to go, brother L. One place. And we had a certain time to be there. And that place was hundreds of feet or hundreds of yards in the opposite direction. Thousands of people. When I walked up there, you think they parted ways just because Joe Adams walking down this way? They knew who I was. No. We had to press and we had to fight and we had to squeeze in and we had to maneuver our way to get to that one place because we had an appointed time. And Paul says, "I press, I fight, I'm zealous to get to that place, forgetting all the things of the past. All the great battles, all the great victories, all the disappointments, all the church splits, all the people that's walked away. I'm not worrying myself with that. I have one goal and I'm pressing toward it." And I wonder for you tonight, church, as we close, musicians can make your way back. I wonder can we say like Paul, I'm pressing in 2026. I'm going to press the battle like I've never pressed before. &gt;&gt; I'm going to worship God like I've never worshiped before. Well, it's my nature. I don't care about your nature. What about him? He's worthy. I'm going to worship freely like I've never worshiped before. My praise is going to get louder. &gt;&gt; Oh my. No, don't be afraid. He can handle it. &gt;&gt; Well, WHEN THEY WENT TO SHOUTING BROTHER BRANDHAM, IT SAID CHILL BUMPS AND SHIVERS ALL OVER MY BODY. AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, IF YOU EVER GET TO HEAVEN, YOU ARE GOING TO FREEZE TO DEATH." WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE SHOUTING. THERE'S GOING TO BE REJOICING CUZ WE MADE IT. WE MADE IT. AND IF YOU GO TO HELL, THERE'S GOING TO BE WEEPING AND WHAILING AND NASHING OF THINGS. THIS IS THE QUIETEST PLACE THAT WE'RE EVER GOING TO LIVE. I SAY, "WELL, THEN LET'S LIVE. LET'S REFLECT BACK AND LET'S PUSH FORWARD AND PRESS THE battle in this new year. As we move forward, church, reflect back and see what God has done in the church. I've given you a list and maybe some of you didn't even recognize all the great things God had done right among you because we're in the moment. But when you look back, let's just play something. But when you look back and you see we started 2025, I was with you last year. Look at the difference of climate between now and then. We had snow blanket everywhere. Freezing temperatures. And today you can walk outside. That's how different it's going to be this year. From freezing temperatures spiritually. I'm not saying you're a spiritually cold church. I'm just trying to say natural types of spiritual to we can walk around with short sleeves on completely same time period, different atmosphere. And if he can do that in the natural, what can he do in the supernatural? Some of you may be cold. Some of you may be lukewarm. Some of you may be laxidasical. Oh, church. Some of you need to be praying. Some of you need to be There's more prodical, Sister Sarah. Maybe not for you that's got to come home, but there's more prodals here. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; There's more healings that need to take place. More deliverances that need to take place, more baptisms of the Holy Ghost. That's one thing I left out. I was here a few months ago, brother Brad and I, and I was preaching on uh I was preaching on man, don't get 50, you forget what you preach on. Quicken, predestinated for quickening power. And brother Weston met me in the back after the morning service, honest, brother Joe, I don't have it. I know I don't have it, brother Weston. I hope this is okay. I don't have it, but I want it. What do I need to do? The Bible gives us a com a complete formula. It's never failed. First step, repentance. I said, "You repent. If you've truly repented, be baptized." I said, "When was you baptized?" Was it? He said, "I was baptized when I was eight years old." I said, 'Well, it seems to be a lot of water under that bridge from 8 years old and you going to high school and college and maybe you done things that you shouldn't have done since then, but he says, "What do you think I should do?" I said, "Well, you know, we can do the first works over, get rebaptized, make a clean start." So, brother Brad and I on a Sunday evening baptize Weston Powell right there in that watery grave. And go fast forward a couple months, he comes to our October meetings. He was expecting something because now he's had a full genuine repentance. And now he was baptized for the right reason. Not just because other people were doing it or because he was too young and he wanted to do it, but now keep playing. That's all good. But now he wanted something. HE WAS STRIVING FOR SOMETHING. He come to our October meetings and the great ministry. And my daughter calls us and tells, "Man, Weston was all out of sorts on the trip home." [Music] That's what happens when your father-in-law is a preacher. said, "What was wrong with him?" HE WAS DISAPPOINTED. HE COME EXPECTING GOD TO FILL HIM WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND HE DIDN'T GET IT. Some of us come the same way to church on Sunday. We expect God TO DO IT ON OUR TIME FRAME AND OUR and when WE WANT IT, BUT GOD HAS AN APPOINTED TIME AND APPOINTED PLACE. SO, he gets home and I think it may have been Monday or Tuesday. HE CALLS ME ON THE PHONE AND HE'S WEEPING AND CRYING AND HE SAYS, "I GOT IT. I GOT IT." HE SAID, "I WAS OUTSIDE MOWING GRASS AND GOD GAVE IT TO ME ON A LAWNMOWER OF ALL PLACES IN THE FRONT YARD FOR OVER AN HOUR CRYING OUT TO GOD. BUT GOD HONORED HIS WORD AND FILLED HIM WITH THE HOLY GHOST." I SAY, "IF GOD COULD DO IT FOR HIM, WHAT COULD GOD DO FOR YOU TONIGHT?" I SAY 2026, WATCH OUT. GOD IS GOING TO POUR OUT IN ABUNDANCE. What God has started, God's able to finish. Oh, may we reflect back to where we were. And may we press forward in this new year. If you need healing, press forward. If you need deliverance, press forward. If you need the Holy Ghost, don't back up. No, you press forward. If you NEED A PERSONAL REVIVAL CUZ YOU DONE GOT COLD, press forward. If you need better finances, you falling on some hard times, come on, church, press forward. Oh, if you got prodicals that you want to see come home. There's your an example of a mother who pressed forward, didn't give up on the promise. So whatever you have need of in this new year, the Bible says whatsoever things you ask, brother Caleb, whatever things you ask, God was faithful. So we reflect back just over 12 months of what God has done in one church. Then there youth camps and special meetings and my I don't think the volumes could contain what God is doing in these last minutes before he comes and raptures his bride. But until then, reflect. Don't live in the past. Reflect back for one purpose to move forward to the promise. God bless you tonight, church. We love you and we're honored to be here with you. We're going to be back with you on Mon Sunday, not Monday. We're going home. We don't do church on Monday, but what an honor. Let's just stand and worship the Lord. Brother Josh, won't you sing us some good old gospel songs, some fast songs. Come on, we want to worship. &gt;&gt; How many want to worship the Lord now as we close this night out? &gt;&gt; Man, rejoice in what God has done for us. Go ahead, brother. Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do.

And Lord, Lord, Lord, you have surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you have surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Oh yes, Lord. Lord, Lord, you have surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Oh, and you healed my body when I was sick. You've surely been good to me. You healed my [Applause] my body when I was sick. You surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen. I just have a quick praise report. Brother Austin wrote in and said that everything was under control and I think uh they said the fire blew the other way and didn't damage any buildings or equipment. No people were harmed. So we can praise the Lord for that this evening. Amen. Amen. Can we sing my theophony? I hear it calling me. One day I'm going to take a step towards my theophony. One day I'm going to take another step into my theophony. One day I know the final step. It's going to set me free. My theophony I hear it calling me and it's a calling.
