[0:00] Like Satan tried to offer Jesus
[0:04] all the kingdoms of the world. Just no
[0:07] Calvary.
[0:10] All these will I give you if you'll just
[0:12] bow down and worship me. Think about it.
[0:15] He was going to give it to him. Isn't it
[0:17] something how it took a prophet of God I
[0:20] ain't never heard it before. How it took
[0:22] a prophet of God to tell you that that
[0:25] shows that he the kingdom belong to him.
[0:28] that he's got control of them because he
[0:30] offered him. He couldn't offer him if he
[0:32] didn't have them,
[0:36] but he tried to offer him. Even brother
[0:38] Brand taught, he says he'll offer you
[0:39] going to church, be a good member. He'll
[0:42] try to offer you being a trustee, a
[0:44] deacon, a preacher. Just don't go to
[0:46] Calvary. Just don't die to yourself.
[0:49] Why? Because that still gives him access
[0:51] to your life. Still access to
[0:54] controlling you.
[0:56] [Music]
[0:58] And there's millions, I wrote down here,
[1:01] billions of people that take that offer,
[1:05] claiming to be a Christian without a
[1:07] Calvary,
[1:08] without dying to themselves. You got to
[1:11] die. How many know Jesus died for you?
[1:14] You owe him to die for him.
[1:18] That's what you owe.
[1:21] Amen. He won't accept anything and
[1:24] anything less. He went to the cross and
[1:26] he says if you're not willing to take up
[1:28] your cross, Amen. then don't bother
[1:30] coming. You ain't going to get it unless
[1:32] you're willing to die.
[1:35] Die to your thinking. Die to your plans.
[1:37] Die to your life. Die to your goals and
[1:40] ambitions.
[1:42] Amen. Sure you can have goals. Sure you
[1:44] can have visions. God is first.
