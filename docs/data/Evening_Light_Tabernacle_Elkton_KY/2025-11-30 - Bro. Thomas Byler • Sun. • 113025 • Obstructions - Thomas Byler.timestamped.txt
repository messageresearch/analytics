[19:22] and art acquainted with all my ways.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Thou hast beset me behind and before and
[19:34] laid thine hand upon me.
[19:42] Whether shall I go from thy spirit or
[19:44] whether shall I flee from thy presence?
[19:53] &gt;&gt; If I take the wings of the morning and
[19:56] dwell in the uttermost part of the sea.
[20:05] If I say surely the darkness shall cover
[20:07] me, even the night shall be light about
[20:09] me.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; For thou hast possessed my reigns. Thou
[20:22] know thou hast covered me in my mother's
[20:24] womb.
[20:33] My substance was not hid from thee when
[20:36] I was made in secret and curiously
[20:38] wrought in the lowest parts of the
[20:40] earth.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; How precious also are thy thoughts unto
[20:55] me, oh God. How great is the sum of
[20:58] them? If I should count them, they are

[43:07] it. Amen. But you have to receive it or
[43:10] it doesn't do any good. Amen. And so we
[43:12] are thankful for the grace of God
[43:14] because we all certainly need it. Amen.
[43:17] Daily basis. Amen. I'm fading out just a
[43:20] little bit. Amen. Amen. Praise. Shall we
[43:25] pray? Lord Jesus, we come before you
[43:28] once again, Lord. Father, assembling
[43:30] ourselves together, Lord. I think of the
[43:33] time when Job and the sons of God came
[43:36] to the house of God to present
[43:37] themselves before the Lord, Lord Jesus.
[43:40] And we believe God that we're doing the
[43:42] same thing this morning for her, Father.
[43:44] We're coming to your house, Lord Jesus.
[43:46] And we pray and present ourselves to
[43:47] you, God. And we ask, God, that you
[43:49] would speak to our hearts this morning,
[43:51] Father, that the spirit would speak,
[43:53] Lord Jesus, that the Holy Spirit would
[43:55] anoint this morning, Father, to say what
[43:58] you would want to say to the people,
[44:00] Father. Not just, Father, some tradition
[44:02] or something that we've been taught or
[44:04] something that we think about, but Lord,
[44:06] what you want to speak to the church
[44:08] this morning, Father, even as you said
[44:11] in your scriptures, Father, him that
[44:13] hath an ear, let him hear what the
[44:15] spirit saith to the churches, Father.
[44:18] So, we ask God that you would just get
[44:20] me out of the way this morning, Lord
[44:21] Jesus, as I yield to you, Father. and
[44:24] having studied and having felt led,
[44:26] Father, to go in a certain direction, we
[44:28] ask God that you'll just go, Father, and
[44:30] take it from there, Lord Jesus, and say
[44:31] what you once said this morning, Father,
[44:34] meet the needs of the people, Father. We
[44:35] know that you already know,
[44:40] &gt;&gt; your guidance now in Jesus name. Amen.
[44:43] And amen. Let's just get into the word
[44:45] this morning. Amen.
[44:50] Now
[44:51] I want to start with Matthew. Matthew
[44:56] very very perhaps familiar scripture to
[45:00] us. Amen. But amen. It's always
[45:05] something more that we can get out of
[45:06] it. Amen. How believe how many believes
[45:09] that this word heaven and earth will
[45:11] pass away but his word shall never pass
[45:14] away. Word is eternal.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:19] And we're thankful for that. The solid
[45:22] rock. Matthew 16.
[45:26] Matthew 16.
[45:35] Amen.
[45:38] And we'll begin with verse 24.
[45:41] Then said Jesus unto his disciples, "If
[45:44] any man will come after me, let him deny
[45:47] himself, and take up his cross, and
[45:50] follow me. For whosoever will save his
[45:53] life shall lose it, and whosoever will
[45:55] lose his life for my sake shall find it.
[45:59] For what is it profited
[46:01] if he shall gain the whole world and
[46:04] lose his own soul? or what shall a man
[46:07] give in exchange for his soul? Amen.
[46:16] Let's go over to the book of Luke yet.
[46:19] We'll read one more scriptures. One more
[46:22] scripture. Luke 14.
[46:32] Luke 14
[46:34] verse 15. And when one of them that sat
[46:36] at meat with him heard these things, he
[46:38] said unto him, Blessed is he that shall
[46:41] eat bread in the kingdom of God. Then
[46:43] said he unto him, a certain man made a
[46:45] great supper, and bade many. And sent
[46:48] his servant at supper time to say unto
[46:50] them that were bidden, come, for all
[46:53] things are ready, are now ready. And
[46:55] they all with one consent began to make
[46:57] excusing to first said unto him, I have
[46:59] bought a piece of ground, and I must
[47:01] needs go and see it. I pray thee have me
[47:04] excused. And another said, I have bought
[47:06] five yolk of oxen, and I go to prove
[47:08] them. I pray thee have me excused. And
[47:11] another said, I have married a wife, and
[47:12] therefore I cannot come. So that servant
[47:15] came and showed his lord all these
[47:17] things. And the master of the house,
[47:18] being angry, said to his servant, "Go
[47:20] out in quickly into the streets and the
[47:22] lanes of the city, and bring thither the
[47:25] poor, the main, the halt, and the
[47:27] blind." And the servant said, Lord, it
[47:28] is done as thou's commandment, and yet
[47:30] there is room. And the Lord said unto
[47:33] that servant, "Go into the highways and
[47:34] into the hedges, and compel them to come
[47:36] in that my house may be filled. For I
[47:39] say unto you that none of those men
[47:41] which were bidden shall taste of my
[47:43] supper." May God add his blessings to
[47:45] the reading of the word. You can be
[47:46] seated this morning. I want to preach
[47:49] this morning on
[47:57] obstructions.
[47:59] Obstructions. Amen.
[48:02] It's quite a thought, isn't it? It's
[48:05] just a thought that came to me. Amen.
[48:08] And so,
[48:09] um,
[48:12] just want to minister what the Holy
[48:13] Spirit want us wants us to say this
[48:15] morning. Amen. And because you know
[48:19] it's kind of peculiar because coming to
[48:23] church
[48:25] for the most part most places probably
[48:28] they're just teaching what that church
[48:30] teaches or uh some tradition or whatever
[48:34] it might be kind of you know and maybe a
[48:37] lot of them a lot of preachers perhaps
[48:39] aren't yielded to the Holy Spirit the
[48:41] way they should be. But you know, really
[48:45] when we think about it, I thought, you
[48:47] know, I was thinking about ministering
[48:50] and being a preacher and being yielded
[48:52] to Christ and and what's really going on
[48:55] is really
[48:57] we're yielded to the Holy Spirit so that
[49:00] God
[49:02] &gt;&gt; can talk to us.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; How many believes that it's about God
[49:07] talking to us? Not just to come up here
[49:09] and preach a sermon or, you know, or or
[49:12] say what we want to say or what it might
[49:14] be, but it needs to be an uncction that
[49:16] comes from God himself.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so you ask yourself, if God
[49:22] would speak to me this morning, what
[49:25] would he say?
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because how many believes that he
[49:29] he is still speaking to his church? His
[49:32] spirit still speaks to his church this
[49:34] morning. And so I got to thinking about
[49:37] as we preached on uh turning point
[49:39] turning points. Amen. And how that you
[49:42] know going down this way that God has
[49:43] made. He is the way, the truth, and the
[49:45] life. And how that in this in this path
[49:47] in this road to go there's turns that we
[49:50] make. Amen. And if you don't make those
[49:52] turns with God, brother Brandham talked
[49:54] about how that you know injunctions of
[49:56] time. You know there's there's different
[49:58] different uh
[50:01] um what do they call it?
[50:04] um
[50:06] dispensational changes,
[50:09] &gt;&gt; changes of dispensations.
[50:11] Amen.
[50:13] Amen. And it's uh kind of treacherous
[50:16] times during those times when God wants
[50:19] to turn a corner. Amen. Uh we got to
[50:22] turn that corner with him. That's right.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; You got to go with him. Amen. I think
[50:28] about where I come from, the Schwartzer
[50:30] trooper Amish, the most strictest of all
[50:32] Amish.
[50:35] It's where I come from until I was 14
[50:37] years old. And I think of how, you know,
[50:39] if they get to just get a motor and a
[50:41] few belts and they get a little bit more
[50:43] than what they had, they're pretty
[50:44] happy. You know, if they have a a
[50:47] washing machine, you know, that it can
[50:49] have a motor or whatever. And they they
[50:51] want to try to pro have progress. They
[50:53] want to try to have a little bit more
[50:55] things so that they can make stuff with
[50:57] whether it's furniture or whether it's
[50:58] wheels or whatever it might be, you
[51:01] know, and if they can just advance a
[51:03] little bit, but boy, they're very very
[51:04] strict in just staying what they have
[51:07] been taught for hundreds of years.
[51:10] Amen. And there's hardly ever any
[51:12] changes. Nothing changes. But we know
[51:15] that that's not how God works. God is
[51:17] always, his church and his people is
[51:19] always getting closer to God. Amen. We
[51:22] know that Luther when he came out that
[51:24] it was hard for the Catholics because he
[51:26] got to stand right in the front of the
[51:28] pope and said, you know, he can't
[51:30] denounce all of those thesis that he had
[51:32] tacked on the wall BECAUSE IT WOULD GO
[51:34] AGAINST HIS CONSCIENCE and he can't do
[51:37] that. The just shall live by faith, not
[51:40] having to pay for indulgences and all
[51:42] these other things. It was wrong. And
[51:44] God was turning a corner and many had
[51:46] died. Many had gotten burned AT THE
[51:48] STAKE FOR DOING WHAT HE DID.
[51:51] AMEN. AND EVEN AFTER HE WOULD be came
[51:54] through, most of the time the cath
[51:56] catholic church would kill people for
[51:58] coming against them and saying what he
[52:00] did. But there was uh different
[52:02] different um uh kingdoms, different
[52:05] different governments that took Martin
[52:07] Luther in and protected him and gave him
[52:09] some protection. Amen. But it was a
[52:12] turning point and you know and and
[52:14] Luther he didn't have all the truth but
[52:16] he just knew that Amen. the just are
[52:18] supposed to live by faith.
[52:20] Not by having to pay for indulgences or
[52:23] their sins or or do penance and all
[52:25] those things. And then along come
[52:27] Wesley. Amen. How many know along come
[52:29] Wesley which was another star of God.
[52:32] Amen. And he began to preach
[52:33] sanctification. It was the age of man
[52:35] and reformation was on and might it be
[52:38] to put go all over the world. It was the
[52:40] face of a man also. Amen. Out of the
[52:43] four different beasts of revelation. But
[52:45] if you'll notice in Revelations 1 and
[52:47] verse 20, it says, "The mystery of well,
[52:49] let me read you a little bit, a little
[52:51] back a little. Jesus says,"I am he that
[52:53] liveth and was dead. And behold, I am
[52:55] alive forever more. Amen. And have the
[52:58] keys of hell and of death. Write thee
[53:01] things which thou hast seen and and the
[53:04] things which are and the things which
[53:05] shall be hereafter. The mystery of the
[53:08] seven stars which thou sawest in my
[53:10] right hand and the seven golden
[53:12] candlesticks. The seven stars are the
[53:15] angels of the seven churches. And the
[53:18] seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
[53:20] the seven churches. And then for the
[53:22] next three chapters he goes on to
[53:24] describing how that they would go
[53:25] through tribulation for 10 days and how
[53:28] they would be killed and so forth. And
[53:30] you can run it back in history and find
[53:32] out that it was during that same age
[53:34] that for 10 years they just slaughtered
[53:36] the Christians and how they died for the
[53:38] cause of Christ
[53:40] in that age. We see THE SEVEN STARS HERE
[53:42] WHERE GOD HAD SEVEN STARS AND GOD WAS
[53:45] GOING TO WORK THROUGH THOSE SEVEN STARS
[53:47] AND THERE WAS ALWAYS A change from one
[53:49] star to the other star to de Martin to
[53:52] Columba to Luther to Wesley to brother
[53:55] Brandham. In the days of the voice of
[53:57] the seventh angel, the Bible says when
[53:59] the mystery of God shall be finished.
[54:01] Amen. As he has declared unto his
[54:03] servants the prophets and after even
[54:05] after brother Brandham preached his
[54:06] message, he says on the back of the
[54:08] church. Can you imagine me preaching a
[54:10] message this morning and delaying it all
[54:12] out and then all of a sudden at the end
[54:13] of the service, amen, all of a sudden a
[54:16] a fog or a mist or something comes on
[54:18] the back of the WALL AND HE DRAWS IT OUT
[54:20] AND HE DRAWS IT JUST THE WAY THAT THE
[54:22] PROPHET HAD DRAWN IT OUT. VINDICATION
[54:24] that what he has said was the truth.
[54:28] Amen. I was telling MY WIFE THIS WEEK, I
[54:30] SAYS, YOU KNOW, IT'S QUITE SOMETHING HOW
[54:31] THAT WE HAVE A PICTURE THERE, AMEN, of
[54:33] brother Brandham and then we have a
[54:34] picture of the halo. Amen. OR THE PILLAR
[54:36] OF FIRE up there. Amen. Because when
[54:39] there's a big story that behind that
[54:40] again, I want to say it because Amen.
[54:43] There was a critic that wanted to Amen.
[54:45] uh to really
[54:47] be PROUD OF HIMSELF AND AMEN. and and
[54:50] rebuking the prophet SAY THERE'S NO SUCH
[54:52] A thing as healing. God doesn't heal
[54:53] anymore. There's no Holy GHOST AND
[54:55] EVERYTHING. HAD A BIG BEATING about it.
[54:57] Probably wouldn't even go to it. Amen.
[54:59] Until the angel said, "Yeah, go to it."
[55:01] And he sat IN THE BACK. AND WHILE FF
[55:03] BOSSWORTH, OR I believe it was one of
[55:05] him, was it FF Bossworth? AND HE TOOK
[55:07] THAT CRITIC ON. AMEN. And actually, he
[55:10] was having a debate. HE WANTED TO HAVE A
[55:12] DEBATE WITH THE PROPHET. AND HE SAID,
[55:14] "NO, I don't debate. I THE WORD OF God
[55:16] ain't for debating." And one of his
[55:17] friend, I believe it was Evard, WENT UP
[55:19] THERE. AMEN. I'LL TAKE HIM. AMEN. I'll
[55:22] do it. He says, "Well, that's up TO
[55:24] YOU." AND HE WENT UP THERE. AMEN. THIS
[55:26] FIRST MR. BEST WENT, he said, "There's
[55:28] no, you know, that healing and the Holy
[55:30] GHOST WAS ONLY FOR THE 12 DISCIPLES or
[55:32] whatever." YOU KNOW, AND and and healing
[55:34] wasn't for the New Testament. And
[55:37] Bosworth comes up and HE SAYS, "THE
[55:39] SEVEN COMPOUND redemptive names of
[55:41] Jehovah." Amen. Did it they APPLY TO
[55:44] JESUS OR NOT? AMEN. And Jehovah Raphi
[55:47] and Healer and all THESE OTHER THINGS,
[55:49] THEY ALL APPLIED TO JESUS. And he SAYS,
[55:52] "ANSWER ME. DO THEY APPLY?" AND MR. BEST
[55:55] couldn't answer the first question. He
[55:57] couldn't even ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION.
[55:59] HE WAS STUMPED WITH ONE QUESTION. AMEN.
[56:02] AND THEN AFTERWARDS, he had his
[56:03] photographers come up and put his finger
[56:05] up there and everything else. AMEN. AND
[56:07] OF ALL THE PICTURES THAT WERE TAKEN,
[56:09] THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE that came out.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; And Amen. George J. of the FBI, the
[56:15] government came and they inspected and
[56:17] they INVESTIGATED AND FIND OUT WHETHER
[56:19] THAT COULD BE A SUPERNATURAL PICTURE OR
[56:22] NOT. AND AND OUR OUR VERY FEDERAL
[56:24] GOVERNMENT SAID THAT WAS NOTHING BUT A
[56:27] SUPERNATURAL PICTURE. IT WAS NOT DOUBLE
[56:29] EXPOSURE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AMEN. AND
[56:32] SEE GOD HIMSELF, HOW MANY SAID GOD
[56:34] HIMSELF IN OUR DAY, AMEN. I THOUGHT I
[56:37] THOUGHT YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE
[56:38] CRITICAL OF IT. YOU LET A HALO COME ON
[56:40] THE BACK OF YOU. YOU LET GOD STAND UP
[56:42] FOR YOU. MAYBE WE'LL HAND YOUR PICTURE
[56:44] UP THERE. AMEN. BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE
[56:46] MAN. IT'S ABOUT THAT HALO. IT'S ABOUT
[56:48] THE PILLAR OF FIRE. HOW MANY BELIEVE
[56:51] THAT IS the very HE SAID THAT'S THE SAME
[56:53] PILLAR OF FIRE THAT LED THE CHILDREN OF
[56:55] ISRAEL. AND BECAUSE WE'RE LEAVING THE
[56:57] WE'RE SERVING a living God.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad that that God IS
[57:03] THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, and forever?
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT GOD AND
[57:08] WHAT JESUS CHRIST HAS DONE IN OUR AGE,
[57:12] oh my
[57:13] my my Amen. We'll pick that up here in a
[57:16] minute. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. AMEN.
[57:18] AS WE TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT, AMEN.
[57:20] ABOUT OBSTRUCTIONS. AMEN. THINGS THAT
[57:22] KEEP people
[57:24] from BELIEVING THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[57:28] THINGS THAT KEEP US FROM SURRENDERING TO
[57:30] GOD THE WAY that we're SUPPOSED TO.
[57:32] AMEN. AND I WE COULD GO BACK JUST TO THE
[57:34] VERY SAME VERY FIRST SCRIPTURE. AMEN.
[57:36] that we read Jesus. AMEN. IF YOU WANT TO
[57:40] COME AFTER ME, you're going to have TO
[57:41] GET SOME OBSTACLES OUT OF THE WAY. AMEN.
[57:45] AND THAT IS FIRST OF ALL YOUR OWN SELF.
[57:47] HOW MANY KNOWS THAT'S YOUR BIGGEST enemy
[57:49] is our own self. It's not the pastor.
[57:51] It's not this, that, OR THE OTHER. YOUR
[57:53] BIGGEST ENEMY IS YOURSELF.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So he says, IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING
[58:00] TO DIE TO YOURSELF, IF YOU'RE NOT
[58:02] WILLING TO GIVE UP YOUR OWN LIFE, YOUR
[58:03] OWN IDEAS, AMEN. AMEN. TO FOLLOW ME.
[58:06] YOU'RE NOT WORTHY TO FOLLOW ME CUZ WHAT
[58:09] ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR A
[58:11] SOUL? HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT'S
[58:13] IMPORTANT THIS MORNING? AMEN. THAT'S WHY
[58:15] WE COME TO CHURCH. AMEN. WE GO TO WORK
[58:17] TOMORROW SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A LITTLE
[58:19] MONEY TO PUT A LITTLE FOOD ON THE TABLE
[58:21] TO SUSTAIN THIS FLESH. BUT WE COME ON
[58:24] SUNDAY. AMEN. AND WE WANT TO HEAR FROM
[58:26] THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT WILL FEED OUR SOUL.
[58:30] THAT'S WHAT WE COME TO CHURCH FOR
[58:32] BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT.
[58:33] JESUS SAID, "LABOR NOT FOR THE MEAT THAT
[58:35] PERISHES, BUT LABOR FOR THE MEAT THAT
[58:37] ENDURETH UNTO ETERNAL LIFE." AMEN. AND
[58:40] HIS WORD IS HIS MEAT.
[58:44] This is meat indeed. This is drink
[58:46] indeed. If you eat this, YOU'LL NEVER
[58:48] HUNGER AGAIN. AMEN. EAT THIS RIGHT HERE
[58:50] IN YOUR SOUL. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
[58:53] OH, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THERE'S A BIG
[58:55] THING. AMEN. THE FIRST THING THAT WE'VE
[58:57] GOT TO DO, UNLESS A MAN IS BORN AGAIN,
[58:59] HE CANNOT SEE THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.
[59:03] So the first thing has to do is you got
[59:05] to die to yourself
[59:06] &gt;&gt; and be born again by what? By the spirit
[59:10] of God,
[59:11] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit.
[59:14] You can repent all you want to, confess
[59:16] all you want to, but when God can
[59:18] accepts that repentance, he accepts that
[59:21] sacrifice and he does something in your
[59:24] life and you have a changing time in
[59:26] your life, a turning point in my life.
[59:29] That's
[59:29] &gt;&gt; right.
[59:31] How many believes there has to BE A
[59:32] CHANGE?
[59:34] &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S
[59:35] DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU WAS BEFORE.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Not the same man.
[59:41] OH, I'M SO GLAD WHEN I WAS RIGHT AROUND
[59:43] 20 YEARS OLD DOWN IN PINECRAFT,
[59:45] SARASOTA, I SAID, "GOD, I WANT TO GIVE
[59:47] YOU MY LIFE. I GIVE YOU MY ALL. I GIVE
[59:49] ME A FUTURE. GOD, I JUST WANT YOU. I
[59:51] WANT YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE
[59:53] WORLD. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. I'M
[59:55] YOURS, LORD." AND WELL, GOD FILLED ME
[59:57] WITH THE HOLY GHOST. WENT DOWN INTO THE
[1:00:00] CREEK. AMEN. REPENT EVERY ONE OF YOU AND
[1:00:02] BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD
[1:00:03] JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR
[1:00:05] SINS AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF
[1:00:07] THE HOLY GHOST. FOR THE PROMISE IS TO
[1:00:09] YOUR CHILDREN TO THEM THAT ARE FAR OFF
[1:00:11] EVEN AS MANY AS THE LORD OUR GOD SHALL
[1:00:13] CALL. THOMAS IN 2000 SOMETHING 1980
[1:00:16] SOMETHING. AMEN. AS MANY AS GOD CALLS.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:23] But turning points, when God does
[1:00:25] something a little different, it's so
[1:00:28] hard
[1:00:30] for people to receive it because they've
[1:00:32] got obstacles in their way. Obstruction.
[1:00:36] Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Obstructions. Notice how I read there in
[1:00:41] Matthew
[1:00:44] or I I read not in Matthew, but yeah, it
[1:00:47] was Matthew. Amen. where he talked about
[1:00:50] how that you know when God made his
[1:00:53] supper, right? God made a dinner for
[1:00:56] everybody,
[1:00:59] got everything ready for everybody. And
[1:01:01] what did they do? They all with one
[1:01:05] consent began to make excuses.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; My, it's gonna be sad, isn't it? People
[1:01:15] that make excuses,
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; their excuses are their obstacles, their
[1:01:22] obstructions.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Many times Jesus SAID, "THE QUEEN OF THE
[1:01:26] SOUTH SHALL RISE UP WITH THIS GENERATION
[1:01:30] AND CONDEMN HIM, CONDEMN IT." THE MEN OF
[1:01:32] NINEVEH ARE GOING TO RISE, BROTHER, I
[1:01:35] MEAN IN JESUS CHRIST'S GENERATION AND
[1:01:37] CONDEMN IT BECAUSE ALL THEY HAD WAS A
[1:01:40] PROPHET COMING OUT OF THE FIFTH AND THEY
[1:01:42] BELIEVED AND THEY REPENTED.
[1:01:44] JESUS COME ALONG AND RAISED LAZARUS FROM
[1:01:47] THE DEAD AND WANTED TO KILL HIM TO GET
[1:01:50] RID OF THE TESTIMONY. THEY COULDN'T THEY
[1:01:52] JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something right now.
[1:02:00] Believing is harder than you think.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Much harder than what you think.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; to get you to believe.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; How many believes it's hard to believe?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; When God does something that we're not
[1:02:19] expecting, that you don't expect, that's
[1:02:22] not the way you're taught, not the way
[1:02:24] that you have believed it.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; But is it according to the word of God?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's the first question. CUZ GOD DON'T
[1:02:33] ASK YOU. HE DON'T ASK ME. HE DON'T ASK
[1:02:35] NOBODY. HE SURE DON'T ASK THE POPE.
[1:02:38] HE DON'T ASK NO DISP. HE DOES WHAT HE
[1:02:40] WANTS TO DO.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; WE COME. OUR MIND HAS TO FIT HIS WAY.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; NOT HIS WAY. OURS. IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; How many believes it's hard to believe?
[1:02:55] Let me let me just prove that to you.
[1:02:57] Would that be okay?
[1:02:59] Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Now when Jesus was risen early the first
[1:03:05] day of the week, he appeared first to
[1:03:07] Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast
[1:03:09] seven devils. AND SHE WENT AND TOLD THEM
[1:03:12] THAT HAD been with him as they mourned
[1:03:15] and as they wept. And they when they
[1:03:17] heard THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND HAD BEEN
[1:03:19] SEEN OF HER believed not.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; IMAGINE HIS OWN DISCIPLES THAT WALKED
[1:03:25] WITH HIM. HE SAID EXPEDIENT THAT I DIE.
[1:03:27] AMEN. I'M GOING TO DIE AND RISE AGAIN
[1:03:29] THE THIRD DAY.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; HE TOLD THEM WHAT HE WAS going to do and
[1:03:32] WHEN IT HAPPENED THEY WOULDN'T BELIEVE
[1:03:34] IT. EVEN HIS OWN DISCIPLES FOUND IT HARD
[1:03:36] to believe.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; It's hard to believe.
[1:03:40] That's hard to believe. Could God send a
[1:03:44] prophet?
[1:03:45] Could he send out Moses? COULD THERE BE
[1:03:48] ANOTHER NOAH? COULD THERE BE ANOTHER NO
[1:03:51] MOSES?
[1:03:53] Could there be another Elijah? I'll send
[1:03:56] you Elijah to before the great and
[1:03:57] dreadful day of the Lord. I mean, that
[1:03:59] was the Elijah of our day.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hard to believe, but it's
[1:04:05] not whether I say it or not. It's
[1:04:07] whether God proves it or not.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; You know how many times that this man
[1:04:11] right here would read John 14:12, he
[1:04:14] says, you know, the works that I do,
[1:04:16] Jesus says, shall ye do also, and
[1:04:18] greater than he these shall he do. And
[1:04:20] he would preach the gospel. Just heard
[1:04:22] him wonder the other day. And I'll tell
[1:04:23] you what, at the end of the service,
[1:04:24] they were all just worshiping the Lord.
[1:04:27] He came and he would SAY, "NOW, IF I'VE
[1:04:29] TOLD YOU THE TRUTH, IF JESUS DON'T COME
[1:04:32] AND PROVE it and vindicate it and DO
[1:04:34] WHAT HE DID BEFORE, BUT IF HE DOES DO TO
[1:04:37] COME AND DOES THE SAME THING WHEN HE
[1:04:38] WALKED THE SHORES OF GALILE GALILEE,
[1:04:40] WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?"
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; AND HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF TIMES
[1:04:45] NEVER failed that the Lord failed to
[1:04:48] come and discern the thoughts and
[1:04:49] intents of their heart. Same way we he
[1:04:51] did with the woman at the well.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:54] The sick were healed.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; THE LAME WALKED.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; AT LEAST 12 PEOPLE OR SO WERE RAISED
[1:05:04] FROM THE DEAD.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; People raised FROM THE DEAD. BUT STILL
[1:05:08] PEOPLE WON'T BELIEVE.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT ONLY GOD CAN RAISE THE
[1:05:12] DEAD, NOT A MAN.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:18] My what God has done.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Listen to what brother
[1:05:24] Bam says. The greatest battle. How can
[1:05:26] you doubt anymore when you see the dead
[1:05:28] raised UP, THE LAME WALK, THE BLIND SAY,
[1:05:31] THE DEAF EAR. REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT
[1:05:35] UNBELIEF. DO YOU REALIZE JOHN THE
[1:05:37] BAPTIST HAD HIS DOUBTS?
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; HE WAS IN PRISON AND HIS EAGLE EYE GOT
[1:05:42] FILMED OVER. HE SENT SOMEBODY OUT THERE
[1:05:45] TO ASK HIM IS HE REALLY THE MESSIAH THAT
[1:05:47] WAS TO COME
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; BEFORE HE SAYS BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD
[1:05:52] THAT TAKETH ANYWHERE IN THE S OF THE
[1:05:54] WORLD. THIS FLESH AND THIS BODY AND THIS
[1:05:56] MIND it doesn't really want to believe.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Is it really real? HOW MANY MEANS? IT'S
[1:06:07] REALLY REAL.
[1:06:10] And I believe
[1:06:13] we got to get past You've GOT TO GET
[1:06:15] PAST THE OBSTACLE OF UNBELIEF.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; It's the BIGGEST OBSTACLE AS THERE IS.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; And let me just say this,
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; whether you believe or not in itself
[1:06:32] will send you to heaven or send you to
[1:06:35] hell.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Whether you believe it or whether you
[1:06:41] don't believe it, we'll send you to
[1:06:43] heaven or send you to hell.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; A big statement coming from a preacher,
[1:06:51] but we're supposed to make the truth.
[1:06:53] We're going to supposed to make a
[1:06:54] statement. How many like a scripture for
[1:06:57] it? Sure. I wouldn't say anything. It
[1:06:59] wouldn't be scripture. Mark 16.
[1:07:03] Oh, let me let me just go further here.
[1:07:06] And when they heard that he was alive
[1:07:07] and seen of her, THEY BELIEVED NOT.
[1:07:09] AFTERWARDS, HE APPEARED TO in another
[1:07:11] for two of them as they walked and went
[1:07:14] into the country. And they went and told
[1:07:16] it to the residue, and neither did THEY
[1:07:18] BELIEVE HIM. HEY, I SAW IT.
[1:07:22] TOMMY, I SAW HIM.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I SAW HIM. HE TALKED WITH US ON
[1:07:27] THE ROAD TO EMMAS AND HE SHOWED HE DID
[1:07:30] THIS VERY SAME THING. BREAK THE BREAD.
[1:07:32] AMEN. AND I KNEW IT WAS HIM.
[1:07:36] Can you imagine if Tommy tell me said,
[1:07:39] "No, don't believe you Thomas. Don't
[1:07:41] believe you. I want to slap you." What
[1:07:45] do you mean? I'm your friend. I'M YOUR
[1:07:46] BROTHER. WHY CAN'T YOU BELIEVE ME? I
[1:07:48] CALL ME A LIAR. I'M NOT LYING. I'M
[1:07:50] TELLING THE TRUTH, BUT THEY JUST
[1:07:51] REFUSED.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Thomas had such a stubborn spirit. He
[1:07:55] man, when they told him, EVEN THE
[1:07:57] DISCIPLES SAID, "MAN, I'M TELLING YOU,
[1:07:59] WE ALL SAW HIM."
[1:08:02] NOPE. IF I DON'T PUT MY HANDS IN HIS
[1:08:05] SIDE, AND IF I DON'T FEEL THE SCARS, I
[1:08:07] AIN'T GOING TO BELIEVE IT.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for the grace of God?
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The pastor that led me to Christ
[1:08:16] and to the message power. Amen. when he
[1:08:19] his wife was Menanite, they were
[1:08:21] Menanite and he would throw the books in
[1:08:23] the river and go and blow his horn
[1:08:25] outside the church and cause
[1:08:27] disturbances and he was against it. HE
[1:08:30] WAS COMPLETELY AGAINST IT. BUT ONE DAY
[1:08:32] IN THE KITCHEN, GOD BE TO OPEN HIS EYES.
[1:08:35] HE OPENED HIS UNDERSTANDING.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And he believed that that GOD WAS
[1:08:40] THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; ALMOST BLASPHEMY AGAINST WHAT GOD HAD
[1:08:45] DONE. But God opened it. How many
[1:08:47] believes God has to open it? He has to
[1:08:50] open your mind and your heart.
[1:08:52] Amen.
[1:08:54] Obstacle of unbelief.
[1:08:57] Amen.
[1:08:59] Neither believe they them. Afterwards he
[1:09:02] appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat
[1:09:04] and araided them with for with their
[1:09:07] unbelief AND HARDNESS OF HEART. REMEMBER
[1:09:11] WHEN he uh in another in the other book
[1:09:14] when he was talking to them on the road
[1:09:15] to Emmus, ain't that right? AND THEY HAD
[1:09:18] SAID, "WHY ARE YOU SO TROUBLED? WHAT'S
[1:09:19] ALL WHAT ARE Y'ALL TALKING ABOUT?" WELL,
[1:09:21] THEY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MARY SAID THAT
[1:09:22] SHE SAW HIM AND THEY WENT THIS THAT OR
[1:09:24] THE OTHER. And then finally HE GOT TO
[1:09:26] TALKING. HE SAYS, "OH, FOOLS AND SLOW OF
[1:09:29] HEART TO BELIEVE ALL THAT THE PROPHETS
[1:09:31] HAVE SPOKEN." CAN WE SAY THAT THIS
[1:09:33] MORNING? THE WORLD IS SLOW TO BELIEVE.
[1:09:36] AMEN. THAT GOD DID MORE IN OUR
[1:09:38] GENERATION THAN WHEN HE WALKED THE
[1:09:40] SHORES OF GALILEE. He did much MANY MANY
[1:09:42] MORE MIRACLES WHEN HE WHEN HE WHEN HE IN
[1:09:45] THIS HOUR THROUGH THE PROPHET'S MESSAGE
[1:09:47] AND WHEN HE WAS ON THE SHORES OF Galilee
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; and when he walked to work he had did
[1:09:51] many more works
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; cuz he said then greater works will you
[1:09:55] do how MANY KNOWS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
[1:09:57] HAPPENED GREATER WORKS EVEN AMEN TO
[1:10:00] SPEAKING THINGS INTO existence
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; speaking to wild animals like bulls that
[1:10:07] was charging them and said I am a
[1:10:09] servant of the Lord I know I intrude
[1:10:11] upon your territory. And he was coming
[1:10:13] to kill him because he had killed
[1:10:14] somebody else already. But that bull
[1:10:17] come charging at him. He wasn't scared.
[1:10:18] The Holy Ghost come down. He spoke to
[1:10:20] him, turned around, go back where he
[1:10:22] come. He come within 10 or 15 yards of
[1:10:25] him and dug flying and then he dug his
[1:10:27] hoofs in and stopped. Great big old
[1:10:29] bull. Stopped. Looked this way. Looked
[1:10:33] that way.
[1:10:36] Turned around. Walked back where he was
[1:10:38] and laid down. Hello.
[1:10:41] Many many things like that. Many things
[1:10:44] where the power of God protected him.
[1:10:46] Amen.
[1:10:49] Praise the Lord. Let me finish this. So
[1:10:51] lo. So he said that's araided them for
[1:10:54] their hardness of heart BECAUSE THEY
[1:10:55] BELIEVED NOT THEM WHICH HAD SEEN HIM.
[1:10:59] AMEN. That's what we're trying to DO
[1:11:01] THIS MORNING. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? TELL THE
[1:11:03] WORLD, I WANT YOU to believe Jesus. I
[1:11:05] want you to believe WHAT GOD DID. THAT
[1:11:08] IS OUR MESSAGE TO THE WORLD that he CAME
[1:11:10] TO TRY TO GET EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION.
[1:11:13] THAT'S WHY HE STOOD LIKE ELIJAH DID ON
[1:11:15] MOUNT CARMEL, CHALLENGED ALL OF THE UH
[1:11:18] PROPHETS OF BAAL. IF YOUR GOD IS GOD,
[1:11:21] COME DOWN HERE AND LET HIM BURN YOUR
[1:11:23] SACRIFICE WITH FIRE. REMEMBER that
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; brother Bham God through brother Bandham
[1:11:28] went to the 30,000 raw heathens over
[1:11:31] there the Hindu the Buddha and everybody

[1:11:36] showed him their belief and all this
[1:11:37] that or the other all the different
[1:11:38] religions he said come out to the
[1:11:40] service the next day and God had showed
[1:11:42] him that there was a blind man amen had
[1:11:45] in a vision that was going TO HAVE HIS
[1:11:47] EYESIGHT RESTORED
[1:11:49] AMEN HE WAS UP THERE HE SAYS YOU SEEKS

[1:11:56] HIM COME UP HERE AND OPEN THIS BLIND
[1:11:58] MAN'S eyes
[1:12:00] and we'll follow YOUR RELIGION. HE SAID
[1:12:02] THAT was bunch you ever saw a right
[1:12:08] and he says no ice can't do it either.
[1:12:11] Hello. But the Jesus WHO I PROCLAIM, WHO
[1:12:14] I REPENT, IF HE DON'T COME AND OPEN HIS
[1:12:17] EYES, YOU PUT A PUT A SIGN ON MY BACK,
[1:12:20] FALSE PROPHET, AND YOU RUN ME OUT OF

[1:12:26] did. Amen. And people pull on him. And
[1:12:29] man, those people, oh man, them people
[1:12:31] over there, they make a god out of you
[1:12:33] if you do miracles like that. Almost.
[1:12:36] God come down and open his eyes. 30,000
[1:12:40] raw heathens gave their hearts to God in
[1:12:43] one day.
[1:12:45] THE BOOK OF ACTS, IT WAS 3,000 THAT HAD
[1:12:48] AMEN. THAT 3,000 SOULS WERE ADDED ON THE
[1:12:51] day of Pentecost. BUT HEAR IT WITH
[1:12:53] 30,000. THAT'S 10 TIMES THE BOOK OF ACTS
[1:12:56] THAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR GENERATION.
[1:13:01] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:03] NO WONDER THERE'S A SHOUT OF THE KING IN
[1:13:05] THE CAMP. AMEN. WHY? Because he was
[1:13:07] going to come and send ELIJAH BEFORE THE
[1:13:09] GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD.
[1:13:11] BEHOLD, THE DAY COMETH THAT SHALL BURN
[1:13:13] IN OVEN, AND ALL THE PROUD, AND ALL THAT
[1:13:15] DO WICKEDLY SHALL BE ASHES. THEY SHALL
[1:13:17] BE ASHES UNDER THE SOLES OF YOUR FEET IN
[1:13:19] THE day that I do this.
[1:13:22] That's right. It wasn't the acceptable
[1:13:25] year of the Lord. No, it was the great
[1:13:27] and dreadful day of the Lord, he was
[1:13:29] going to send it one more time. How many
[1:13:31] believes of all the different religions,
[1:13:33] all the different churches, all the
[1:13:35] different ways that there is. How many
[1:13:37] glad that God came and proved that Jesus
[1:13:41] is still the way? He is the truth. He is
[1:13:44] the life. THIS IS THE WAY. IT'S NOT
[1:13:46] ABOUT JOINING A CHURCH. IT'S ABOUT
[1:13:48] GETTING joined to Christ.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; By one spirit, ARE WE ALL BAPTIZED INTO
[1:13:54] ONE BODY? THAT'S ON THE CHURCH. THAT'S
[1:13:57] HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO JOIN the church.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:02] Praise the Lord. All right. I told you a
[1:14:04] while ago I was going to give you an
[1:14:06] explanation.
[1:14:08] And then he says, "And he said unto
[1:14:09] them, go ye into all THE WORLD AND
[1:14:11] PREACH THE GOSPEL to every creature."
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember,
[1:14:17] belief will send you to heaven. Unbelief
[1:14:20] will send you to hell. HE THAT BELIEVETH
[1:14:23] AND IS BAPTIZED shall be saved.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; And he that believeth not shall be
[1:14:30] damned.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; That simple.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] Oh, I'm glad WE AIN'T GOT TO SACRIFICE A
[1:14:38] BUNCH OF COWS, A BUNCH OF SHEEP, A BUNCH
[1:14:40] ALL THOSE THINGS. WE AIN'T GOT TO MAKE
[1:14:42] NO SACRIFICE. THE SACRIFICE ALREADY BEEN
[1:14:44] MADE. CHRIST HAS ALREADY PAID the price.
[1:14:47] All you got TO DO IS ACCEPT HIM. ACCEPT
[1:14:50] WHAT GOD HAS DONE.
[1:14:53] All you got TO DO IS LOOK AT THAT CROSS.
[1:14:57] AMEN. LIKE MOSES. AMEN. GOD SAYS, "PUT A
[1:14:59] SERPENT UP THERE." AMEN. A SERPENT
[1:15:01] REPRESENTED SIN. AMEN. ON THAT POLE
[1:15:04] REPRESENT CALVARY. AMEN. JUDGED. SIN
[1:15:07] JUDGED. AND ALL THEY HAD to do BACK THEN
[1:15:10] WAS LOOK AT IT. AMEN. HOW MANY PLEASE
[1:15:13] JUST OPEN THE EYES OF MY HEART, LORD.
[1:15:15] Open the eyes of my heart and let me
[1:15:17] realize that you have already paid the
[1:15:19] price. All you got to do is believe.
[1:15:26] Amen.
[1:15:28] Obstructions.
[1:15:30] How many knows it's the devil's
[1:15:31] business?
[1:15:32] It's his business to get into your mind
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; and bring doubt.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Make you doubt. bring obstructions in
[1:15:42] your life.
[1:15:45] Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; An obstruction.
[1:15:55] Notice how these people's obstruction
[1:15:57] was. They had married a wife. They had
[1:16:00] bought some land.
[1:16:07] They had gotten some oxen that they
[1:16:10] needed to prove.
[1:16:12] IT'S GOING TO BE A SAD DAY CUZ HOW MANY
[1:16:15] KNOWS GOD is going to make We're all
[1:16:18] accountable as human beings. We're all
[1:16:19] accountable. We're all going to have to
[1:16:20] give account
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; for the air that we breathe
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; for the decisions that we've made
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; for what we've done.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. It's not at the It's not the
[1:16:31] end when you die and they put you in the
[1:16:33] ground. No. Uh-uh. Jesus rose from the
[1:16:37] dead. How many believes that? And one
[1:16:39] day he'll call everybody. LIKE HE SAID,
[1:16:41] HE'LL CALL THE GREAT, THE SMALL, THE
[1:16:43] DEAD. AMEN. THOSE THAT ARE IN THE OCEAN.
[1:16:45] IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE. HE'LL
[1:16:47] CALL THEM ALL UP TO THE WHITE THRONE
[1:16:49] JUDGMENT. AND IT WILL GIVE AN account
[1:16:53] for what they've done.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're accountable.
[1:16:59] And on that day, I can only imagine the
[1:17:02] excuses that people might have. Well, I
[1:17:07] well, my church didn't believe it that
[1:17:09] way. I just couldn't see it that way. It
[1:17:12] was against my religion.
[1:17:15] All kinds of little excuses.
[1:17:18] Amen.
[1:17:34] Mark 10.
[1:17:37] I'm in Luke.
[1:17:39] Mark 10.
[1:17:42] Jesus said to the rich young ruler.
[1:17:44] Let's look at the rich young ruler. He
[1:17:47] had some obstructions in his life,
[1:17:49] didn't he?
[1:17:51] He came to Jesus and asked him, "What
[1:17:54] shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
[1:17:57] Jesus said unto him, "Why callst thou me
[1:17:58] good? There's none good but one, and
[1:18:00] that is God. Thou knowest the
[1:18:01] commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do
[1:18:03] not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear
[1:18:05] false witness. Defra not. Honor thy
[1:18:07] father and thy mother." AND HE ANSWERED
[1:18:09] AND SAID UNTO HIM, "MASTER,
[1:18:12] WOW, this boy was a good boy."
[1:18:15] To look at Jesus in the face and say,
[1:18:17] "All these things have I observed from
[1:18:20] my youth."
[1:18:23] Never did Jesus say, "Ah, you're lying."
[1:18:26] Huh?
[1:18:28] But Jesus beholding him loved him.
[1:18:32] How many knows Jesus loves you?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus loves all of you. He loves
[1:18:37] everybody.
[1:18:38] The only reason that Putin hasn't pulled
[1:18:41] the trigger,
[1:18:43] hello, the nukes haven't gone off is
[1:18:46] because of the long suffering of
[1:18:47] Almighty God. Because the debauchery and
[1:18:50] the immorality,
[1:18:53] it is fit for another Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:18:55] burning
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; and God will.
[1:18:59] Many ministers have said, and I say
[1:19:01] repeating, uh I'm not sure which one it
[1:19:04] was, but brother Brandham even repeated
[1:19:06] somebody else that had said it. If God
[1:19:08] doesn't destroy the world, destroy this
[1:19:11] Sodom age, these Sodommites,
[1:19:14] he says he'll he he'll be obligated to
[1:19:16] raise Sodom and Gomorrah up and
[1:19:18] apologize.
[1:19:20] He's a just God.
[1:19:23] Amen. He's not going to he going to do
[1:19:24] no apology,
[1:19:26] but he will reach out his hand. HE'LL
[1:19:29] REACH OUT HIS HAND. LONG SUFFERING IN
[1:19:31] THE DAYS OF NOAH 120 YEARS.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; This prophet's been off the scene since
[1:19:37] 1965. And here we are in 20 2025. It's
[1:19:40] been a long time, almost half a century.
[1:19:43] But God longsuffering.
[1:19:47] STILL HAS PREACHERS OUT HERE TELLING YOU
[1:19:49] ABOUT CHRIST AND WHAT CHRIST DID. IT'S
[1:19:51] EASY TO BELIEVE AND ACCEPT THE CHRIST
[1:19:53] DIED ON CALVARY. BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN
[1:19:56] WHEN JESUS COMES AND DOES THE VERY SAME
[1:19:58] THINGS THAT HE DID BACK THEN AND THEN
[1:20:00] REJECT THAT? THEN SAY, "NO, I don't
[1:20:02] believe it."
[1:20:04] You're still rejecting him.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; No matter what you say about the past.
[1:20:10] Amen.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; The Pharisees, how many know, let me
[1:20:15] get, let me get I want to talk about the
[1:20:16] Pharisees next,
[1:20:18] but here the rich young ruler.
[1:20:22] And Jesus BEHOLDING LOVED HIM AND SAYS,
[1:20:24] "ONE THING THOU LACKEST."
[1:20:26] He looked down in the heart of that rich
[1:20:29] young ruler
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "GO THY WAY
[1:20:36] and sell a third of what you have.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Sell half of what you have." So you
[1:20:44] still have something.
[1:20:48] remember Zakius and different ones if
[1:20:51] they've cheated somebody I'll pay them
[1:20:52] fivefold
[1:20:54] I you know they made their own vow I'll
[1:20:56] pay whatever they wanted to pay and here
[1:20:59] Jesus could have demanded anything but
[1:21:01] he said go and sell whatsoever thou hast
[1:21:05] and give it to the POOR AND THOU SHALT
[1:21:08] HAVE TREASURE IN HEAVEN AND COME TAKE UP
[1:21:12] YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW ME.
[1:21:15] HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT EVERY LAST
[1:21:17] ONE OF US HAS TO DO? BE WILLING TO
[1:21:19] FORSAKE ALL TO FOLLOW HIM. MOM, DAD,
[1:21:23] BROTHER, SISTER, AMEN. WHATEVER IT IS
[1:21:26] THAT'S NOT FOR CHRIST, YOU GOT TO BE
[1:21:28] WILLING TO FORSAKE ALL.
[1:21:30] GET THE OBSTRUCTION OUT OF YOUR WAY.
[1:21:36] NO OBSTRUCTIONS. CHRIST WANTS NO
[1:21:38] OBSTRUCTIONS.
[1:21:40] NOT BETWEEN ME, MY SOUL, AND my savior.
[1:21:44] Let nothing be between.
[1:21:48] Amen. How many believes Christ wants
[1:21:51] nothing between you
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; and him? That's why he created the blood
[1:21:54] of Jesus Christ to forgive us. How many
[1:21:56] clad for forgiveness?
[1:21:59] Let the blood come down and wash you
[1:22:01] white, wash you clean, forgive your
[1:22:03] past. There is now no condemnation to
[1:22:06] them that are in Christ Jesus who walk
[1:22:08] not after the spirit. I mean after the
[1:22:10] flesh, but after the spirit. No
[1:22:13] condemnation to those that are in
[1:22:14] Christ. He took our judgment.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; God can't judge you because you already
[1:22:19] got judged in Christ.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; If you are in Christ, you have passed
[1:22:24] from death unto life. You have passed
[1:22:26] from condemnation. You have passed from
[1:22:28] judgment to life. The only way to not be
[1:22:32] into judgment because the Bible says he
[1:22:34] comes with 10 thousands of his saints to
[1:22:36] execute judgment. He comes with his wife
[1:22:40] in the white throne judgment. Daniel
[1:22:42] said to judge the world. Even Paul said,
[1:22:45] "Don't you know that the saints shall
[1:22:47] judge the world?"
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND HE WAS SAD AT THAT SAYING, and
[1:22:55] then went away grief, FOR HE HAD GREAT
[1:22:58] POSSESSIONS.
[1:23:04] Here we get another lesson.
[1:23:07] Be careful that your possessions
[1:23:10] isn't what obstructs you
[1:23:14] from following the Lord holy. Remember
[1:23:16] the book of Acts? Remember Jesus, he
[1:23:19] didn't have a place to lay his head and
[1:23:22] he said, "Father workketh and I work
[1:23:26] hitherto."
[1:23:27] Brother Brad, that's my heart's desire
[1:23:29] is God shows me to do something
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; and that's what I do.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; How many is with me? Don't you want to
[1:23:36] be that way? God shows me and that's
[1:23:39] what I do. That's all I care about. My
[1:23:41] meat is to do the father's will.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; All I care about is doing what God wants
[1:23:47] me to do.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; No obstructions,
[1:23:51] no ifands, or buts. But this young
[1:23:53] ruler, he had great possession, and it
[1:23:55] was the clog that sent him to hell.
[1:23:58] It was the one thing HE COULDN'T LET GO
[1:24:00] OF.
[1:24:03] IMAGINE
[1:24:07] COMING DOWN TO HIS DEATHBED.
[1:24:09] One place Jes Jesus talked about the
[1:24:11] rich man that had to build his barns
[1:24:13] bigger and all these other things. HE
[1:24:14] SAYS AND SAYS, "MAN, I'VE GOT SO MUCH
[1:24:17] NOW AND MY SOUL TAKE YOUR LEISURE. TAKE
[1:24:20] YOUR REST. YOU'VE GOT IT MADE NOW.
[1:24:22] YOU'RE READY FOR GOOD RETIREMENT." HE
[1:24:24] SAYS, "THOU FOOL, knowest not now not
[1:24:27] that this night thy soul shall be
[1:24:29] required of thee."
[1:24:31] Having that heart attack. And he says,
[1:24:33] "Boy, I sure wish I'd have made THAT
[1:24:34] CHOICE. I SURE WISH I'D HAVE DONE WHAT
[1:24:37] HE SAID. I WISH I'D HAVE HAD AN AUCTION.
[1:24:41] I WISH I'D SOLD IT ALL AND GAVE TO THE
[1:24:44] POOR.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But it's too late then. How many knows
[1:24:48] when you come down to the door to death,
[1:24:49] it's too late?" Amen. After you take
[1:24:52] that last breath, there's always a
[1:24:53] deathbed experience. I don't say there's
[1:24:55] not that. Hello. But don't wait until
[1:24:58] that time.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] get your obstructions out of the way.
[1:25:08] So, be careful. Be careful of riches.
[1:25:13] Amen.
[1:25:18] Let me just finish this scripture here.
[1:25:24] And Jesus looked around about
[1:25:30] and said unto his disciples, "How hardly
[1:25:35] shall they that have riches enter into
[1:25:37] the kingdom of God?"
[1:25:40] And his disciples were astonished at his
[1:25:42] words. But Jesus answered again and said
[1:25:43] unto them, "Children, how hard is it for
[1:25:46] them that trust in riches,
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:25:51] to enter into the kingdom of God? For it
[1:25:53] is easier for a camel to go through the
[1:25:55] eye of a needle, for it than for a rich
[1:25:56] man to enter into the kingdom. And they
[1:25:58] were astonished out of measure, saying
[1:26:00] among themselves, who then can be saved?
[1:26:02] And Jesus looking upon them saith, with
[1:26:05] men it's impossible, but with God,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen, all things are possible.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] When you think about how much Jesus had,
[1:26:19] the disciples had, wouldn't we all have
[1:26:21] to say we're rich?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Got houses, we got lands, we got house,
[1:26:26] you know, we got refrigerators full of
[1:26:29] food.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Closets are overpiled.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; I've got so many shoes. I got to go
[1:26:36] store them here and there.
[1:26:41] But I'm one of those that all things are
[1:26:44] possible. Are you one of those? But with
[1:26:46] God, all things are possible. That's
[1:26:49] right. Because you don't worship that.
[1:26:51] You don't love that. You love him more
[1:26:53] than you do your stuff.
[1:26:58] Amen.
[1:27:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:11] talk about the Pharisees.
[1:27:16] Before we do that, let's just talk about
[1:27:17] King Agria for a minute, shall we? Let's
[1:27:20] talk about Agria. Let me see if I can
[1:27:23] find that right quick.
[1:27:25] Acts I didn't put my note paper in. Acts
[1:27:30] 26.
[1:27:39] remember Felix, I believe it was Fesus,
[1:27:42] Fesus and the Gri Grippa got together
[1:27:45] and they uh made Paul come out and you
[1:27:48] know given a answer for why they wanting
[1:27:51] to kill him so bad.
[1:27:54] And whereupon, O king Agria, I was not a
[1:27:56] disobedient to the heavenly vision.
[1:27:58] Remember
[1:28:00] Paul would testify of how that that
[1:28:03] light struck him down. Same as brother
[1:28:06] Bannon when he was young, seven years
[1:28:07] old. He was carrying water for his dad's
[1:28:11] steel and all and he says there's a
[1:28:13] whirlwind to come in a tree and it's A
[1:28:15] WHIRLWIND SPOKE OUT OF THAT TREE AND
[1:28:16] SAID don't drink, DON'T SMOKE OR DEFILE
[1:28:19] YOURSELF WITH WOMEN OR DEFILE your body
[1:28:21] IN ANY WAY FOR I HAVE A WORK FOR YOU TO
[1:28:23] DO.
[1:28:24] ONE TIME, BROTHER BANDHAM HAD A WHOLE
[1:28:26] group of people and ministers, a bunch
[1:28:28] OF PREACHERS WERE BACK AND BROTHER
[1:28:29] BANNED TO SAY THAT. HE BEGAN TO GIVE A
[1:28:32] testimony and he used THAT SCRIPTURE OF
[1:28:35] BROTHER PAUL OF WHAT PAUL SAID. I WAS
[1:28:36] NOT DISOBEDIENT. And when he began to
[1:28:39] say that, a whole back row of ministers
[1:28:41] walk out. They didn't want to hear
[1:28:43] nothing about what he claims that God
[1:28:45] said to him.
[1:28:48] Why? Oh, they believe Jesus hung on the
[1:28:50] cross and died for him. But when Jesus
[1:28:53] does something again just like it, no,
[1:28:55] I'm walking out on that. Do you think
[1:28:57] they're going to go guiltless?
[1:28:59] No, they're not going to walk out
[1:29:00] guiltless.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; But Paul here was telling him, he says,
[1:29:06] and he and he he man, he just laid it
[1:29:08] OUT THAT JESUS DIED AND ROSE AGAIN FOR
[1:29:11] OUR JUSTIFICATION AND EVERYTHING.
[1:29:14] NOW, FESUS,
[1:29:18] he said uh uh that let me just pick the
[1:29:22] story up. Paul's talking that Christ
[1:29:24] should suffer and that he should be the
[1:29:25] first that should rise from the dead and
[1:29:27] should show light unto the peoples and
[1:29:29] to the Gentiles. And as he thus spake
[1:29:32] for himself, Fesus said with A LOUD
[1:29:33] VOICE, PAUL, THOU ART BESIDE THYSELF.
[1:29:36] MUCH LEARNING HAS MADE thee mad. In
[1:29:38] other words, there was not a lot of
[1:29:39] faith in Fesus, not a lot of belief in
[1:29:42] what Paul was saying. You studied too
[1:29:44] much.
[1:29:46] But he said, "I am not mad, most
[1:29:48] noblefastness, but speak forth the words
[1:29:50] of truth and soberness.
[1:29:52] For the king knoweth of these things
[1:29:54] before how before whom I speak freely,
[1:29:57] for I am persuaded that none of these
[1:29:59] things are hidden from him. For this
[1:30:02] thing is not done in a corner." King
[1:30:05] Agria, believest thou the prophets? I
[1:30:08] KNOW THAT THOU BELIEVEST the prophets.
[1:30:11] Then a grippa said unto Paul, "Almost
[1:30:14] thou persuadeest me to be a Christian."
[1:30:21] He just had one clog.
[1:30:24] There's one clog AND IT WAS THE ONE WORD
[1:30:29] ALMOST.
[1:30:32] ALMOST. I think we get that song.
[1:30:37] Persuaded.
[1:30:40] Almost isn't good enough.
[1:30:42] ALMOST ISN'T FAIR. IT DOESN'T GET YOU
[1:30:45] ANYTHING. ALMOST IS NOT ENOUGH.
[1:30:50] I IMAGINE HE HAD HIS THOUGHTS ON HIS
[1:30:53] DEATH. BUT OH, I ALMOST DID.
[1:30:57] Regions of the lost.
[1:31:00] Almost I believed. ALMOST I ACCEPT IT.
[1:31:08] But he had that clog of unbelief. He had
[1:31:11] his prestige. He didn't want to become
[1:31:13] one of Paul's heretics, what they called
[1:31:17] crazy man.
[1:31:19] Hello.
[1:31:21] See, all Paul did, he's he went around
[1:31:23] saying what God told him and what God
[1:31:25] did. That's what the prophet did. Same
[1:31:27] thing. You know, God commissioned me and
[1:31:30] the angel commissioned me. Amen. Angel
[1:31:33] says, "You're going to pray pray for
[1:31:34] kings and monarchs and potentates and so
[1:31:36] forth. going to go around the world.
[1:31:39] Why? Because it's not about brother
[1:31:41] Brandham. It's about Jesus Christ.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; It's about grace. It's about salvation
[1:31:46] to this generation.
[1:31:48] It's about a clear path and without a
[1:31:50] question so many times. Amen. I love the
[1:31:54] vindication.
[1:31:55] Amen. Listen to this. WHERE WHERE THE
[1:31:59] PHARISEES, WHY WERE THEY BLIND? WHAT
[1:32:03] MADE THEM SO BLIND?
[1:32:06] Brother man preached a message called in
[1:32:07] GOD UNVEILING HIMSELF. HE TALKED ABOUT
[1:32:10] THE VEIL OVER ISRAEL'S EYES WAS A VEIL
[1:32:13] of tradition.
[1:32:16] THEY SAID JESUS WHY DON'T THE DISCIPLES
[1:32:19] KEEP THEIR TRADITION THEY MADE THEY WASH
[1:32:21] FOOD THEY EAT WITHOUT WASHING THEIR
[1:32:23] HANDS. YOU KNOW IT'S BECOME SUCH A
[1:32:26] TRADITION AS A WASH pots and pans and
[1:32:28] all these things
[1:32:31] and Jesus said YOU BY YOUR TRADITION
[1:32:33] HAVE MADE THE WORD OF GOD OF NONE EFFECT
[1:32:35] TO THE PEOPLE.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Pharisees had obstruction. You know what
[1:32:41] it was? Jealousy. They were jealous of
[1:32:43] him. They envied him and THEY HAD PRIDE.
[1:32:48] HOW MANY KNOW THEY HAD PRIDE?
[1:32:50] HE SAYS YOU PRAY IN THE STREETS AND SO
[1:32:52] FORTH TO BE SEEN OF MEN. HE LOVED THE
[1:32:54] UPPERMOST SEATS AND SO FORTH. He liked
[1:32:57] to BE THE BIG SHOT. HE LIKED TO BE SPEAK
[1:32:59] SOMEBODY. They had pride and they had
[1:33:02] murder in their hearts. All these things
[1:33:05] were obstructions. Why couldn't they
[1:33:07] accept them? Jesus. Oh boy. He really
[1:33:10] scorched them.
[1:33:13] You say, "Why preacher do you have to be
[1:33:15] hard on churches and people?" I'll tell
[1:33:17] you why. It's because they reject Jesus
[1:33:19] Christ.
[1:33:23] You know who you know who Jesus was the
[1:33:25] hardest on
[1:33:28] the Pharisees.
[1:33:30] He says YOU'RE HE SAID WE'RE NOT WE WE
[1:33:33] AREN'T uh
[1:33:36] born of fornication.
[1:33:38] THEY CALLED HIM BEZIBUB.
[1:33:40] YOU'RE BEUB.
[1:33:42] Jesus replied says no you are of your
[1:33:45] FATHER THE DEVIL BECAUSE MY WORD HAS ITS
[1:33:48] PLACE IN YOU. SO THE DEVIL IS YOUR
[1:33:51] FATHER. HE WAS A MURDERER FROM THE
[1:33:52] BEGINNING. HE FINALLY GOT OUT AND REALLY
[1:33:54] YOU'RE OPEN SEPARS. YOU'RE OUTSIDE YOU
[1:33:57] LOOK HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS, BUT INSIDE
[1:33:59] YOU'RE FULL OF DEAD MEN'S BONES.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; You hypocrites. YOU HYPOCRITES. YOU
[1:34:05] HYPOCRITES. YOU CLAIM TO KNOW GOD, BUT
[1:34:08] YOU DON'T.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; First make clean the outside. The inside
[1:34:16] will claim clean. Is hard on hypocrites.
[1:34:19] And Jesus was the hardest are the most
[1:34:23] religious people of his day.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Religious people. God's ordained people.
[1:34:30] Ain't that right? Israelites.
[1:34:33] He was hard on them. He tried his best
[1:34:36] to get their get them to receive it, but
[1:34:38] they would not. And then what he said?
[1:34:41] Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, my heart would
[1:34:43] have hovered thee as A HEAD OF THE ROOF,
[1:34:45] BUT YOU WOULD NOT. NOW you are left
[1:34:48] desolate.
[1:34:50] When he was going to Calvary, the women
[1:34:52] and everybody crying and weeping. HE
[1:34:55] GOING TO CALVARY. BLOOD EVERYWHERE.
[1:34:58] BLOOD RUNNING DOWN LIKE A BLOODY DEER
[1:35:01] TRAIL. EVEN MUCH WORSE THAN THAT. JUST
[1:35:03] BLOOD.
[1:35:05] COULDN'T GO ANYMORE.
[1:35:07] YOU AND I would weep. He looked at him
[1:35:10] in the eyes and he says, "Don't weep for
[1:35:12] me.
[1:35:14] Don't weep for me, BUT WEEP FOR
[1:35:16] YOURSELF. WEEP FOR YOUR CHILDREN.
[1:35:19] BECAUSE HE KNEW 70 YEARS LATER, TITUS
[1:35:21] WOULD ENCAMP ROUND ABOUT JERUSALEM.
[1:35:25] LET HIM THAT'S ON THE HOUSETOP. MAN,
[1:35:27] DON'T LEAVE YOUR DON'T TAKE YOUR STUFF.
[1:35:28] GET OUT OF THERE. CHRISTIANS WERE BORN
[1:35:31] OF THE HOLY GHOST. THEY GOT OUT OF
[1:35:33] THERE, BUT HE BESIEGED IT. And it was
[1:35:35] such a terrible thing until they ate
[1:35:37] each other's bait the bark off the tree.
[1:35:41] Titus wiped the thing down to where one
[1:35:43] stone wasn't upon another. Knocked it
[1:35:45] down. Hello. Because he seen what was
[1:35:48] going to happen because of their
[1:35:49] rejecting.
[1:35:51] But they had
[1:35:54] they had something that hindered them.
[1:35:56] They had an obstruction.
[1:35:58] Amen.
[1:36:00] Jesus himself was tested and tried of
[1:36:04] the devil. The devil tried to obstruct
[1:36:07] Jesus.
[1:36:08] Amen. the temptation in the wilderness
[1:36:10] up in ra Matthew 5 when he was up on the
[1:36:12] mountain the devil comes to him and he
[1:36:14] says man IF THOU BE THE SON OF GOD
[1:36:16] you're hungry SAYS AFTER THAT FAST JESUS
[1:36:19] WAS A hunger I don't know about you but
[1:36:21] after 40 days I'd be hungry would you be
[1:36:24] hungry after 5 hours brother I'm hungry
[1:36:30] let alone three days or a week or a
[1:36:32] MONTH I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHEN THAT WHEN
[1:36:35] THAT FAST THING WENT OFF OF HIM I fasted
[1:36:38] one day three days I guess when life was
[1:36:41] hard very hard and I was desperate for
[1:36:44] three days I guess that's probably the
[1:36:46] longest I hadn't eaten
[1:36:48] but most of the time when you have a
[1:36:50] fast even the prophet says you know you
[1:36:52] don't even get hungry you don't have no
[1:36:55] desire to eat but when that left when
[1:36:58] Jesus said he was hungry and the devil
[1:37:00] come and says make stones into bread all
[1:37:04] he wanted him to do was obey HIM JUST DO
[1:37:07] WHAT I ASK YOU TO
[1:37:08] THEN HE AGAIN, IT WOULDN'T WORK. NO MAN
[1:37:10] SHALL not live by BREAD ALONE, BUT BY
[1:37:13] EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDTH OUT OF THE
[1:37:14] MOUTH OF GOD. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? YOU
[1:37:17] CAN'T LIVE JUST BY A DAY GONE BY. YOU'VE
[1:37:19] GOT TO LIVE BY EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDTH
[1:37:21] OUT OF THE MOUTH of God. Amen. IF YOU
[1:37:23] EVER GET THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST
[1:37:25] IN YOUR HEART, YOU'LL BELIEVE EVERY WORD
[1:37:27] OF THIS CUZ THE HOLY SPIRIT WROTE THIS.
[1:37:30] WE BELIEVE ALL OF THIS WORD, NOT JUST A
[1:37:33] PORTION OF IT.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; OH, we believe it, but we DON'T BELIEVE
[1:37:36] IN FORNOWLEDGE. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN
[1:37:37] PREDESTINATION. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT
[1:37:39] OUR NAMES WERE WRITTEN IN THE LAMP BOOK
[1:37:41] OF LIFE FROM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:37:42] THE WORLD. THAT'S JUST TOO SCARY. NO,
[1:37:45] IT'S NOT TOO SCARY. GOD SAID IT. I
[1:37:47] BELIEVE IT. I DON'T CARE IF IT MAKES
[1:37:49] SENSE TO YOU OR NOT.
[1:37:52] HE KNEW BEFORE HE EVER STARTED THIS
[1:37:54] THING. HE WROTE EVERYBODY'S NAME.
[1:37:57] HE KNOWS WHO WILL. HE KNOWS WHO WON'T.
[1:38:01] THAT'S WHY IF YOU BAPTIZE WITH THE
[1:38:03] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IN THE
[1:38:04] CHRISTIAN, YOU OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPIEST
[1:38:06] PERSON IN THE WORLD CUZ YOU KNOW AND
[1:38:09] BELIEVE THAT YOUR NAME WAS ON THAT BOOK.
[1:38:12] AMEN. And you're willing TO FORGET.
[1:38:14] AMEN. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
[1:38:15] GOING TO BE CLOGGED UP BY YOUR PREVIOUS
[1:38:17] TEACHING. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE CLOGGED
[1:38:19] UP BY YOUR CHURCH'S TEACHING. NO. THOSE
[1:38:22] CHURCH TEACHINGS, IT WILL CLOG YOU UP.
[1:38:24] THE TRADITIONS OF MEN, AMEN, WILL BLIND
[1:38:27] YOU. IT'LL PUT A A CLOAK IN you
[1:38:29] believing all of God's word.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. That veil of tradition.
[1:38:39] Well, our church don't teach that. I
[1:38:41] don't care what your church
[1:38:43] and tell us what to believe and that's
[1:38:45] his word.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Your teach Your church teaches one
[1:38:49] tradition of man that's not according to
[1:38:52] the word. It's making the word of God of
[1:38:54] none effect.
[1:38:56] You're voiding THE WORD OF GOD. IT HAS
[1:38:58] TO BE ACCORDING TO THE WORD. WHAT I
[1:39:00] TEACH, WHAT THIS CHURCH TEACHES, IT'S
[1:39:01] GOT TO BE THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; No adding to it, no taking away from it.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet came. That's why
[1:39:12] God came and BROUGHT AGAIN US BACK TO
[1:39:15] WHAT PAUL TAUGHT. IF AN ANGEL FROM
[1:39:18] HEAVEN COME AND TEACH ANYTHING THAT
[1:39:19] OTHER THAN I PREACH, LET HIM BE A
[1:39:21] CURSED. BIG PAUL SAID
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; that's exactly right.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; So many things that God the devil will
[1:39:31] do. Amen. To try to bring an obstruction
[1:39:38] to keep you from serving the Lord with
[1:39:40] all your heart, all your mind, all your
[1:39:44] soul,
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; all your strength.
[1:39:47] Amen. Young people the same way. They'll
[1:39:50] try to bring in obstruction. Somehow
[1:39:54] that's his business. It's his business.
[1:39:57] David, how many knows David was a man of
[1:40:00] God? He was mighty. He was cruising
[1:40:02] along real good.
[1:40:05] He was king.
[1:40:08] But one day
[1:40:11] Beth Sheeba come along. Ain't that
[1:40:12] right? And he yielded to temptation.
[1:40:16] Yielded to the devil's temptation. And
[1:40:18] there was a clog in his life that caused
[1:40:20] him his wives to be ravished, him to be
[1:40:24] exiled, caused him so much trouble
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; cuz he allowed a clog to come in his
[1:40:30] life.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; How about Samson? He was going along
[1:40:34] killing heaps upon heaps. Ain't nobody
[1:40:37] could take him down.
[1:40:39] No, not a whole. No matter how many
[1:40:41] armies come.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; It's something. Don't you love God? If
[1:40:46] God tries wants to do something, he can
[1:40:47] take one person
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; and he can defeat the whole world.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Sam wouldn't have had to stop at a
[1:40:58] thousand Philistines.
[1:41:00] God just chose to do it that way. Ain't
[1:41:02] that right?
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Moses, just a man with a stick went down
[1:41:06] there. Amen.
[1:41:08] I can't say with just a stick. He went
[1:41:11] down there with a stick. And the most
[1:41:13] important part, God.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; GOD'S COMMISSION. GO DOWN THERE AND tell
[1:41:18] him to let my people go.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; GOD HELP US TO HEAR A VOICE OF THE HOLY
[1:41:25] SPIRIT SAYING, "LET MY PEOPLE GO. SET
[1:41:28] THEM FREE."
[1:41:31] AMEN. BECAUSE WHO THE SON SETS FREE IS
[1:41:33] FREE INDEED. HOW MANY want to be FREE
[1:41:36] INDEED? I'VE GOT NO OBSTRUCTIONS IN MY
[1:41:39] LIFE. I'M AS HAPPY AS A BIRD AND JUST AS
[1:41:41] FREE.
[1:41:43] HOW MANY IS HAPPY? HOW MANY IS FREE?
[1:41:46] Free to serve God WITH ALL OF YOUR
[1:41:48] HEART. LET GO AND LET GOD HAVE HIS WAY.
[1:41:51] GET RID OF THE DESTRUCTIONS IN YOUR
[1:41:53] LIFE. COME ON, WORSHIP HIM A LITTLE. HE
[1:41:56] LOVES HIS WORSHIP. HE'S WORTHY OF
[1:41:59] PRAISE.
[1:42:00] HE'S MIGHTY IN BATTLE. HE HAS TAKEN MY
[1:42:02] CHAINS OFF MY LEGS AND OFF MY HANDS. THE
[1:42:05] CHAINS THAT BOUND ME, I'M NOT BOUND
[1:42:08] ANYMORE.
[1:42:10] I'M NOT BOUND BY GUILT. I'M NOT BOUND BY
[1:42:13] SIN.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; How many slad for the freedom
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; that comes with Jesus Christ?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Once like a prison I dwelt no freedom
[1:42:23] from my sorrow for I felt and Jesus came
[1:42:27] and listened TO ME AND GLORY TO GOD HE
[1:42:30] SET ME FREE. HE SET ME FREE. He set me
[1:42:32] free. He broke the bond OF PRISON FOR
[1:42:35] ME. I'M bound his
[1:42:39] I'm glory bound
[1:42:42] my Jesus to see for glory to God he said
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; me
[1:42:49] free
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; WOO
[1:42:57] FREEDOM
[1:42:59] NO OBSTRUCTIONCTIONS
[1:43:02] MY PAST IS TAKEN CARE OF MY FUTURE
[1:43:05] SECURE IT'S
[1:43:10] WOO! GOD, I'M GLAD THAT HE SET ME FREE.
[1:43:13] I'M NOT GLAD I'M NOT BOUND SOME
[1:43:15] TRADITION OF PER OF MAN AND SOME CHURCH
[1:43:18] CREED. I'M GLAD I'M NOT BOUND BY SIN.
[1:43:21] AREN'T YOU?
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise be to God.
[1:43:28] Moses,
[1:43:31] Amen.
[1:43:33] did great.
[1:43:35] delivered the children of Israel by
[1:43:36] God's hand. Went out there in the
[1:43:39] wilderness. Ain't that right? But he had
[1:43:41] a little problem, a little bit of flesh
[1:43:44] problem yet. Amen. Amen. And children
[1:43:48] cried for water. Is that right? And he
[1:43:51] got a temper and struck drugs ROCK
[1:43:54] TWICE.
[1:43:56] BECAUSE of his temper, God said,
[1:43:58] "Because you promoted yourself,
[1:44:00] glorified yourself, you're not going to
[1:44:02] go see the land. I'm going to take you
[1:44:04] home. I have to take you home on this
[1:44:06] side. He wasn't lost. Amen. But his
[1:44:09] temper his way. He had an obstruction.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:21] Brother makes a statement. It is as if
[1:44:22] this church now could be put together
[1:44:25] and knitted together such that every
[1:44:27] person would be in one accord.
[1:44:30] One accord with one shadow of a doubt
[1:44:33] anywhere. There would not be a feeble
[1:44:35] person in our midst in the next five
[1:44:37] minutes. THERE WOULD BE NOBODY DESIRING
[1:44:39] THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. HOW MANY WANTS TO
[1:44:42] BE THAT FREE? GOD TAKE EVERY OBSTACLE
[1:44:44] AWAY. AMEN. IF YOU AIN'T GOT THE HOLY
[1:44:46] GHOST, RAISE YOUR HAND SAY I ACCEPT THE
[1:44:48] HOLY GHOST RIGHT NOW. I BELIEVE IT'S
[1:44:50] MINE. TAKE DOUBT AWAY. FILL ME WITH YOUR
[1:44:53] SPIRIT, GOD.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; FILL ME with more of your spirit in the
[1:44:58] next five minutes. Amen. But what would
[1:45:01] receive it if you could just get that
[1:45:04] something that certain thing thick? He
[1:45:08] talks about it. Amen. Sometime Amen.
[1:45:11] when I was back home and we'd have corn
[1:45:14] out and so forth and the branch would
[1:45:16] break off perhaps. Amen. and a it would
[1:45:19] come down and lean on that stock and
[1:45:21] that stock would become deformed.
[1:45:23] Wouldn't grow right, wouldn't produce
[1:45:25] nothing. Moss perhaps would grow on it.
[1:45:28] Hello. He says that's the way it is when
[1:45:30] you let some obstruction come in your
[1:45:32] life. You're not the kind of Christian
[1:45:34] that ought to be. That's why we still
[1:45:37] have uh Christians that with characters
[1:45:39] and and part of their nature isn't what
[1:45:41] it's supposed to be
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; because something gets in the way. So I
[1:45:46] close this morning
[1:45:48] with this thought and this question.
[1:45:51] Ask yourself because only you know
[1:45:55] and maybe you don't know what it is
[1:45:59] that's keeping you from giving your life
[1:46:02] to the Lord Jesus Christ the way that he
[1:46:05] said that we're supposed to. Forsake
[1:46:07] your own life, your own ideas, your own
[1:46:10] ways. Die to yourself. Amen. So that you
[1:46:15] can say like Paul says, "Amen."
[1:46:20] That he died daily and the life that he
[1:46:22] now lived, he didn't live of himself,
[1:46:25] but he lived by the faith of the son of
[1:46:28] God.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that faith has
[1:46:31] no hindrances. There's nothing that
[1:46:33] hinders faith. Faith comes and wipes
[1:46:36] every hindering thing out of your life,
[1:46:39] the past, sin, whatever it might be.
[1:46:43] Amen.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Like I said, maybe you don't know
[1:46:46] because it takes the Holy Spirit. How
[1:46:47] many believes it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:46:48] in your heart to really show you
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; where your faults are.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; I thank the Lord every day. Lord, show
[1:47:00] me where I have a clog. Show me where
[1:47:03] I'm not where I brother Tommy. Why I
[1:47:06] still don't reflect Christ the way that
[1:47:08] I should.
[1:47:11] Because I'll tell you this right now.
[1:47:12] We're here
[1:47:14] as God's temple, as God's
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; We're God's hands. We're God's lips.
[1:47:18] We're God's feet. We're God's actions.
[1:47:21] Everything we do ought to be Christlike.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christians, we're Christlike.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Stand with me. Close your eyes
[1:47:35] and say, "God,
[1:47:38] I'm taking these next few minutes now.
[1:47:41] And I want you to shine your light down
[1:47:45] in my life.
[1:47:47] Tell me in my mind,
[1:47:50] in my heart, whether there is an
[1:47:54] obstruction,
[1:47:55] show me my obstruction.
[1:47:58] What is it that hinders me?
[1:48:01] from loving you the way that I'm
[1:48:03] supposed to love you.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; From walking with you like Enoch did and
[1:48:08] did only what pleased you before he
[1:48:10] left. He had that testimony. We're
[1:48:12] fixing to go in the rapture any time.
[1:48:14] The world is fixing to get blown up and
[1:48:16] burn
[1:48:18] because that's the last thing that
[1:48:19] happens after God sent that Elijah. The
[1:48:22] day cometh that shall burn as an oven.
[1:48:25] The world is going to experience that
[1:48:27] oven.
[1:48:28] But God help them. God save every
[1:48:31] savable soul this morning.
[1:48:34] Lord, you see every heart. How in our
[1:48:38] marriages sometimes God will I mean the
[1:48:40] devil will come in perhaps bring a
[1:48:42] quarrel between husband and wife. He'll
[1:48:45] bring anything that he can to bring an
[1:48:47] obstruction
[1:48:49] any way that he possibly can. Anything.
[1:48:53] But you think about it. Let the Holy
[1:48:54] Spirit prick your heart. What's keeping
[1:48:57] you?
[1:48:58] What's keeping you from fully serving
[1:49:03] Jesus Christ? From believing him 100%.
[1:49:09] From surrendering yourself like we
[1:49:12] started with the song about
[1:49:13] surrendering. I surrender my all.
[1:49:17] God, that's what we want. We want to
[1:49:18] surrender our all.
[1:49:21] We don't want to like the seed that was
[1:49:23] cast by the wayside
[1:49:27] that by and by the devil just comes and
[1:49:31] the seed that was sewn in the heart. We
[1:49:32] come to church and we're out of church
[1:49:34] for a day or two and it's gone because
[1:49:35] the devil kind of knocked it out. Took
[1:49:38] it out of our heart, took it out of our
[1:49:39] minds.
[1:49:41] or the one that fell by the on the rocks
[1:49:45] didn't have any ground and because of
[1:49:47] trials and tribulation and persecution
[1:49:49] arises by and by we're offended because
[1:49:52] we get persecuted.
[1:49:54] We get told that we're in a cult we get
[1:49:56] told that we're wrong that this is wrong
[1:50:00] and we can't handle it. Lord help us not
[1:50:03] to be that way. We don't have that clog.
[1:50:05] But Lord, I ask God, as you said on the
[1:50:08] last one, he says, you know, there's
[1:50:10] another kind that fell.
[1:50:13] And because of the cares of life,
[1:50:15] because of riches and the cares of life,
[1:50:17] the word was choked out. God, help this
[1:50:20] church. God, help each one, Father, this
[1:50:22] morning never to get too busy. never to
[1:50:25] let the cares or the riches of choke out
[1:50:28] that walk that we have with you, that
[1:50:31] real love feeling that we have for you,
[1:50:34] that daily walk of devotion that we have
[1:50:36] with you, Lord, Father. But let it fall
[1:50:39] on good ground, deep soil, a
[1:50:43] predestinated seed that has got deep
[1:50:46] roots that it doesn't matter what wind
[1:50:49] blows. Doesn't matter if it's a
[1:50:53] hurricane
[1:50:54] category four or five that tree holds
[1:50:58] because it's rooted in the word, Father.
[1:51:02] And I pray that that would be each and
[1:51:04] every person in here, Lord. The winds
[1:51:07] are blowing,
[1:51:09] Lord. The temptations are out there.
[1:51:11] Satan's like a roaring lion
[1:51:14] coming in like a flood.
[1:51:17] But Lord, you set up a standard against
[1:51:19] it. And we pray God this morning if
[1:51:21] there's anybody in here, Lord, that
[1:51:24] needs the removal of some of these
[1:51:26] things that clog them up, Lord, that
[1:51:28] have obstructions, may they raise their
[1:51:30] hand and say, "God, I know now where my
[1:51:32] obstruction is, and I now surrender my
[1:51:34] obstruction to you." I say, "God, take
[1:51:36] this obstruction. Take this thing away
[1:51:39] that keeps me from walking with you like
[1:51:41] I should. Keep it that takes my joy from
[1:51:44] me that Lord, I PUTS A FROWN ON MY FACE.
[1:51:47] GOD, I pray take it away. Let me have
[1:51:50] that joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:51:53] Lord, you see all the hands. Lord,
[1:51:56] if your prophet was here, he was gifted
[1:51:59] with being able to tell what people were
[1:52:01] thinking, what was wrong with him. And
[1:52:04] that was not him. That was you. That was
[1:52:07] you, Lord, doing that. And father, that
[1:52:10] gave us the knowledge and the
[1:52:11] understanding that you do know the
[1:52:14] thoughts and the intents of every one of
[1:52:17] our hearts this morning. And you see why
[1:52:20] those hands are raised. And we ask God
[1:52:22] that you'd be merciful this morning. And
[1:52:25] that you would remove,
[1:52:27] Father, when we come back together on
[1:52:29] Wednesday, Lord, these people who have
[1:52:31] their hands up, they're not going to be
[1:52:33] the same as what they came to church
[1:52:35] this morning. No. Because they've
[1:52:38] surrendered.
[1:52:39] out of a better people than what we've
[1:52:42] come. We're better people to serve you
[1:52:44] than what we've come. We ask you to
[1:52:46] forgive us of our shortcomings, our
[1:52:48] failures.
[1:52:50] Lord, our sins that we don't even
[1:52:52] realize, cleanse us, make us white as
[1:52:55] snow, and set us free. We ask God that
[1:52:58] you'll take every hand, Lord. Bring us
[1:53:00] closer to you, Lord. Remove those
[1:53:02] obstacles, whatever it might be, and
[1:53:04] especially unbelief. Take it from us,
[1:53:07] Lord Jesus. Help us to believe all that
[1:53:10] the prophets have spoken. All that you
[1:53:12] have said, Lord, we want to believe all
[1:53:14] of it. Father, receive it into our
[1:53:16] hearts and to become the kind of
