[42:11] there was a battle for those that were
[42:13] cast down for those who were lost he
[42:15] knew that there was a battle and this
[42:17] battle was a battle that no mortal
[42:20] man could take on his own
[42:23] shoulder you can't do it I can't do it
[42:27] it the prophet couldn't do it but God
[42:31] Almighty by his stripes we are
[42:36] [Music]
[42:39] healed this scripture
[42:41] describes what the weight of the world
[42:44] must have felt like on one man's
[42:48] shoulders I can only
[42:50] imagine Monday that report come
[42:54] in how the weight of the world must have
[42:56] fell on
[42:59] their weight of the world must on their
[43:04] shoulders I talked to and he said when I
[43:07] caught him he said I'm just picking
[43:08] myself up off the
[43:11] floor you know there's a saying it says
[43:14] if I fall let me fall on my back because
[43:17] if I get
[43:20] up keep looking to Jesus
[43:25] Keep who can who can fix the
[43:29] problem but you
[43:31] know sister Donna she didn't come here
[43:34] tonight to
[43:35] weep no she didn't come here tonight to
[43:38] weat she didn't come here for you to
[43:40] feel sorry no she came to
[43:42] fight that's a
[43:47] [Applause]
[43:48] fight when Jo we got the phone call from
[43:52] Brother B and I I begin to explain to Jo
[43:55] what he had told me looked at each other
[43:57] in utter shock and and and just unbelief
[44:01] of what we were
[44:03] hearing I said I think you better call
[44:06] sister
[44:07] Donna and she said what will I
[44:12] say I said you'll
[44:14] know and she dialed the
[44:17] phone she said sister Donna this is Jo

[44:43] defeated Believers don't know the word
[44:47] defeat Believers don't know how to quit
[44:51] Believers refuse to lose
[44:57] so don't cry for her you see because no
[45:01] doubt a diagnosis can be frightening
[45:03] when you hear it you're
[45:04] frightened it can be frightening but I
[45:06] do know this too a diagnosis in reality
[45:10] to a Believer is no more than one man's
[45:15] opinion I'm in the medical field and
[45:18] I've done come to find out that a
[45:20] diagnosis is nothing more than one man's
[45:22] opinion you say well what about the
[45:24] prognosis let me tell you what a
[45:26] prognosis is it's a speculation of what
[45:28] they think might
[45:30] happen they're
[45:32] speculating I don't speculation I deal
[45:35] with facts and the facts tell me that
[45:39] God has the answers facts tell me that I
[45:42] know a god who's never lost a fight
[45:45] facts tell me we know a God that hears
[45:48] our cries the facts tell me that God has
[45:52] fought a battle and won the war
[45:57] how many believes that
[45:59] tonight how many believes we can
[46:01] overcome
[46:03] tonight brother brandham said the angel
[46:05] of the Lord came to me and he said a
[46:07] supernatural being came walking into the
[46:10] room and he said an angel said he was
[46:13] sent from the very presence of
[46:15] God he began to sit there he said he
[46:18] looked at him and he said if you can get
[46:20] the people to
[46:24] believe if you can get the people to
[46:26] believe would and would be sincere when
[46:28] you
[46:30] pray

[46:35] said nothing that means heart trouble
[46:38] cancer

[47:09] tonight how many look at the hand
[47:12] building let me tell you that portals of
[47:15] Heaven are open tonight and Angels the

[47:19] commands of God's people they're waiting
[47:22] to hear what our request is if that

[47:49] problem and he began to tell me and and
[47:51] he began to tell me the what the
[47:53] situation was and emotions began to run
[47:56] through through my head many emotions
[47:59] begin to run through my head sorrow

[48:12] was I was angry that Satan come and lay
[48:16] his hands on not not not any of any any
[48:20] of our people here I was that he could
[48:22] come and begin to torment and to grab a

[49:01] twisting and Japan put that out there on
[49:04] Pearl to Pearl Harbor and begin to
[49:06] attack but you know what they found out

[57:55] forgive me I'm going to break order just
[57:57] a little
[58:00] bit father and sister Donna come up at
[58:02] this time if they would come
[58:06] up brother Caleb brother Micah sister
[58:11] Grace Alena
[58:13] emilin just stand right
[58:23] there family that prays together stays
[58:25] together together
[58:29] am sister Donna has a a little testimony
[58:33] she'd like to share with you I look at
[58:35] this smile on her face and I think glory
[58:37] to
[58:41] God okay as yall know I I'm always any
[58:46] some emotion in there because there's
[58:48] I'm alive okay and that's part of it
[58:50] runs in the family so if I do cry a
[58:52] little bit it ain't because I'm any
[58:54] other reason but
[58:56] want to say that even from the very
[58:59] start that the Lord has never allowed
[59:02] any
[59:03] fear um I I've never I I'm I'm a hater
[59:08] of
[59:09] Satan and when I can get him under my
[59:12] feet I will smash him as much as I
[59:15] possibly
[59:16] can
[59:20] and and was in there I felt like I kind
[59:25] of looked in the eyes of some
[59:28] devils because there was one of them
[59:30] come in there and I thought well they're
[59:32] dealing through science but I thought
[59:34] whoo they you say you are going to die
[59:37] from breast cancer and I thought boy now
[59:39] what kind of devil am I looking at and I
[59:41] just thought that's what you say not
[59:45] me was like I didn't say that you
[59:48] did but anyway I'm just saying that's
[59:51] what the Lord even in all of it even in
[59:54] them saying and showing these pictures
[59:56] and then these things and I thought Lord
[59:58] there's no fear that that fear and
[1:00:02] there's I'm like no Satan you can have
[1:00:05] that and go to hell with it that's right
[1:00:08] what I said that's
[1:00:12] right that's right and the way that I
[1:00:17] believe is that I'm already healed it's
[1:00:20] already done that's where I stand thank
[1:00:24] the Lord um
[1:00:27] [Applause]
[1:00:29] and I don't say it just out of like an
[1:00:32] emotion I stand on it I know all the
[1:00:36] cloud of witnesses that we have of the
[1:00:39] positive I also know that there are some
[1:00:42] that because of the disas have stepped
[1:00:45] over into the other dimension I'm aware
[1:00:46] of all of that stuff because you think
[1:00:49] well they probably thought that is one
[1:00:51] crazy woman she didn't even she didn't
[1:00:53] you know and I I have an on time God I
[1:00:56] have a God I have a rock and he's my
[1:00:59] shield and my protector I have him to
[1:01:02] that is with me all the time and none of
[1:01:05] this
[1:01:06] actually basically I guess you would say
[1:01:09] kind of showed it or tried to show a
[1:01:15] until it was like I began to get very
[1:01:18] sincere with the Lord and I
[1:01:20] realized you know and I prayed and I
[1:01:22] thought Lord we hear so much about you
[1:01:27] about people getting real sincere with
[1:01:29] you in the time of trouble and I a long
[1:01:32] time ago I thought Lord I don't want to
[1:01:34] wait till a time of trouble I want to be
[1:01:37] that
[1:01:38] close yeah you know so yep I just prayed
[1:01:44] that and then I was blessed to be able
[1:01:46] to help with homeschooling the girls
[1:01:48] here and we have a Bible every morning
[1:01:50] and I'm telling you what it just it's
[1:01:52] yum you know it's good and I thank for
[1:01:56] it and it's not just me trying to help
[1:02:01] them to armor up to be able to stand
[1:02:04] against the enemy and to share with them
[1:02:08] how to how he works and how to shut him
[1:02:11] down it's just I it myself and I've
[1:02:16] learned I've become closer and closer
[1:02:18] Lord and it's it's just a resounding
[1:02:22] amen the devil I he might hate me but I
[1:02:26] don't
[1:02:27] care there's no love lost there trust
[1:02:30] me and and I try to tell them all the
[1:02:33] time he comes by way of
[1:02:36] thoughts mess with the young people by
[1:02:39] attitudes and emotions and and changes
[1:02:42] go through as young people and I try to
[1:02:45] give them a head up on it you know and
[1:02:47] he didn't like it because I was
[1:02:49] squashing him really really bad and I
[1:02:53] just praise God don't keep on squashing
[1:02:55] him and
[1:02:57] I'm oh oh and another thing I'm not
[1:03:01] preparing for a funeral I'm preparing
[1:03:02] for a Rapture
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:12] amen amen praise the Lord that's how she
[1:03:16] truly has been through the whole deal
[1:03:19] mean so much when I heard the news well
[1:03:22] no none of that everything that could
[1:03:25] hit me did hit me and she was already
[1:03:28] dead in the grave and I felt the
[1:03:30] emotions I actually felt the emotions of
[1:03:32] the thoughts of not having her with me
[1:03:35] you know I was like she's gone the
[1:03:37] doctor said and and and only only if you
[1:03:41] experience can you really know what that
[1:03:43] the pain I mean you talk about pain you
[1:03:46] know I've had to pick myself up off the
[1:03:48] ground I mean knock down like you know
[1:03:51] and and begin to try to have the faith
[1:03:54] that she does right
[1:03:56] because she deserves it you know God's
[1:03:59] faith it ain't my faith there you go
[1:04:00] she's always said that she's not my
[1:04:02] faith it's you know God is praised God
[1:04:05] is lifted up because it's the god in me
[1:04:07] that's doing all that's right sister
[1:04:10] that's
[1:04:11] right anyway so uh it's been a couple
[1:04:14] days for me trying to get up and I'll be
[1:04:17] honest with you until about noon today
[1:04:19] course it still hits me probably will
[1:04:21] still hit me and I thoughts you know the
[1:04:24] thoughts of where it would go the other
[1:04:26] way and when when you be down that road
[1:04:29] while you're going to have tears coming
[1:04:31] flowing you know so you got to
[1:04:33] completely overcome you know you got to
[1:04:36] think God's thoughts the way that she
[1:04:38] think God's thoughts amen that it's
[1:04:40] already done already healed and praise
[1:04:42] God and worship him and just as if it
[1:04:45] was already done and let me tell you
[1:04:47] something no doubt a lot of us here will
[1:04:49] are fighting doubts tonight but you got
[1:04:51] to fight those doubts you've got to shun
[1:04:53] them the side otherwise we'd all be
[1:04:56] boohoo in here right the reason that we
[1:04:57] find those doubts though is because
[1:04:59] we've seen others that have passed on
[1:05:02] you have to recognize that and say Lord
[1:05:05] I understand all of that but that's not
[1:05:09] what I believe that's not what's in here
[1:05:12] and I'm okay if you feel that way but
[1:05:15] it's just like this too and like I told
[1:05:16] them I came home and I told them I said
[1:05:19] if you want to cry that's fine and I
[1:05:20] might cry with you but it ain't because
[1:05:21] I'm feeling sorry for myself I'm sorry
[1:05:23] you're unhappy I said and I'm going to
[1:05:25] cry and I'm be like Lord help him be
[1:05:27] happy you know but I told him and I said
[1:05:30] listen I said Mike and Grace the girls
[1:05:32] they're building a house I said y'all
[1:05:35] need to keep on building a house I said
[1:05:38] and they have homeschool and I'm going
[1:05:40] to keep on helping homeschool I said and
[1:05:44] I'm going to help do housework and
[1:05:46] laundry and all that other kind of stuff
[1:05:48] I said I'm going to keep on walking in
[1:05:50] the Lord every day I said this
[1:05:56] and I told him I said it's it's like
[1:05:59] it's unclean spirits brother brandom
[1:06:00] taught us about the three unclean and
[1:06:02] they always look back they always look
[1:06:04] back I said we're not looking back I
[1:06:07] said today is the first day of our life
[1:06:11] and we're going to do it with Jesus
[1:06:12] every single day I said every day is a
[1:06:15] new day and that's when we're walking in
[1:06:17] the Lord Jesus Christ in the line of D
[1:06:20] amen praise the Lord
[1:06:27] amen so we just want to say we have we
[1:06:30] love you all very much and amen one
[1:06:33] thing it did to to for me is when they
[1:06:36] me that of course I broke down and wept
[1:06:39] on her you know started to ask
[1:06:42] forgiveness for everything I had ever
[1:06:43] done every little fight I read you know
[1:06:46] and all that and I looked in her face
[1:06:49] and I seen
[1:06:51] that same young girl that I married 40
[1:06:56] years ago and it was like a renewed love
[1:07:00] just an appreciation amen but you know a
[1:07:04] trespasser how many believe we got a
