[15:23] Lord Jesus in our lives to be what you
[15:25] would have us to be and line up with you
[15:27] and we can only do that through the
[15:30] preaching of the word through the
[15:31] minister of the word that draws us to
[15:33] you Lord Jesus
[15:37] thank you Lord Jesus
[15:39] be with us now in this service we pray
[15:42] amen
[15:45] to be in the house of the Lord this
[15:46] morning
[15:48] if you would have your Bibles
[15:51] turn with me to
[15:53] Saint John chapter 10.
[16:03] has God been good to you this week
[16:06] amen
[16:07] has the devil been mean to you this week
[16:10] well well you're in the battle
[16:12] we're all in a battle
[16:16] Saint John chapter 10 very familiar
[16:19] scripture
[16:20] we look at this
[16:24] and it says the thief cometh not but for
[16:26] to steal to kill
[16:29] and to destroy
[16:31] I am come that they might have life
[16:36] and that they might have it more
[16:39] abundantly
[16:41] amen you can have your seats may the
[16:43] Lord add the blessing to the reading of
[16:44] the word
[16:46] I want to try to take just a portion of
[16:48] time and if you could stay with me and
[16:50] and we're going to do a little bit of
[16:51] teaching a little bit of History a
[16:53] little bit of preaching a little bit
[16:54] different I guess and like I said
[16:57] I feel like myself this is a broken
[16:59] message but I trust that we'll each
[17:01] grass what we have need of in each of
[17:03] Our Lives you know God is he he cares
[17:05] he's concerned he feels and he thinks
[17:08] and he wants you to get what you need in
[17:10] your life to get you in the place
[17:12] that he wants you to be so that you can
[17:14] have a life that is pleasing to him and
[17:16] God wants you to be happy
[17:18] are you with me
[17:20] I want to speak this morning if I were
[17:22] to title this life liberty and the
[17:25] pursuit of happiness
[17:28] I like preaching holidays
[17:30] I've always liked preachers I like
[17:34] preaching Mother's Day and Christmas and
[17:36] and Father's Day and
[17:38] Independence Day so today we're going to
[17:41] look at life liberty and the pursuit of
[17:42] happiness and in order to look at the
[17:44] life liberty and the pursuit of
[17:46] happiness we have to look at
[17:47] Independence and when we think about
[17:49] independence we look at the word
[17:51] independence and it means a state or
[17:53] quality of being independent free from
[17:57] the control
[18:00] are you with me
[18:01] brothers or sisters we're living in a
[18:03] time and a place that Satan has tried
[18:05] his best to put his grasp on us but
[18:08] there was a day over 2 000 years ago on
[18:11] a day on Calvary when the blood of Jesus
[18:14] Christ was shed and the blood of the
[18:17] Lamb come and says you have now your
[18:20] Independence and nobody no power no
[18:23] demon no power out of hell can have any
[18:28] kind of control over you you're free
[18:30] from that
[18:32] that's the kind of Freedom that I need
[18:34] in my life
[18:36] listen to what the prophet says he says
[18:38] just remember the omnipresent God is
[18:41] always present
[18:43] because you know I think about this and
[18:45] I'm going to try to take my time we got
[18:47] two services and I've got a lot here and
[18:49] a lot at home yet to get so I'm just
[18:51] going to take my time brother Byler
[18:53] and looking at this quote the prophet
[18:56] said the omnipresent God is always here
[18:59] present
[19:01] so why would we allow Satan to come into
[19:03] our lives on a daily basis and try to
[19:06] take control of you
[19:09] when God the present God is always
[19:11] present he says God can heal cancer
[19:15] God can heal paralysism whatever it is
[19:18] he's already done it it's a finished
[19:21] work and he's already done it he says if
[19:24] we can just get you to believe it
[19:29] you're not saved today
[19:33] that's what he said you're not saved
[19:36] tonight you've been saved over 2 000
[19:39] years ago
[19:41] so why would we let Satan come in and
[19:43] begin to get this conflict in our mind
[19:45] and this vital and says you're this or
[19:47] you're that you're not going to make it
[19:48] you're not an overcomer you can't get
[19:50] there because uh the Satan's got his
[19:52] grips on you why do we allow that when
[19:55] we have an omnipresent God that's always
[19:57] present and he says if we can just
[19:59] believe it if we could just accept that
[20:01] salvation
[20:03] 2 000 years ago a finished work he said
[20:07] the devil you know has put you in a pawn
[20:09] shop
[20:10] you've heard him tell this story many
[20:12] times you've been placed into a pawn
[20:15] shop and the devil's placed you there
[20:17] but Jesus came and redeemed you he
[20:20] opened up the doors and the only thing
[20:22] you have to do he says is walk out and
[20:24] claim your Liberty
[20:26] what is Liberty this morning Liberty is
[20:28] freedom Liberty gives you the freedom to
[20:31] serve God to worship God to love people
[20:33] to have joy and peace and long-suffering
[20:35] that's what Liberty and freedom is in
[20:38] the name of Jesus Christ
[20:40] and he gives us that he says every
[20:42] Redemptive blessing was completely
[20:44] finished on Calvary
[20:47] Satan has
[20:48] no more power
[20:53] no more power
[20:56] he's only a bluff with it
[21:00] oh he may appear nasty he may appear a
[21:02] big and hairy and nasty with claws and
[21:06] fangs and horns and a pitchfork however
[21:08] you envision him
[21:11] but he's just a bluff
[21:14] he's just a bluff he has no power
[21:18] legally
[21:20] he says all right he said he has no
[21:22] power at all every Power he had was
[21:24] taken from him at Calvary now that was
[21:27] the price that was paid he's just a
[21:29] bluff he said you can listen to his blob
[21:31] if you want to
[21:34] I refuse to listen to his bluff anymore
[21:37] because I have seen myself in the word
[21:40] and mother word tells me he can't touch
[21:42] me he has no control he I have freedom
[21:53] brothers and sisters
[21:55] we don't have to walk in bondage anymore
[21:58] sin and darkness no longer has his grips
[22:02] on us as Believers we're living in a
[22:05] different day
[22:06] a different time a different different
[22:09] uh atmosphere that is going around the
[22:12] world and that atmosphere is preparing a
[22:14] group abroad of Believers Warriors who
[22:18] will stand up and say Satan has no more
[22:20] control over me because Calvary I was
[22:23] set free
[22:24] and we live in a country
[22:26] that we ought to be able to understand
[22:27] this we live in a country where we're
[22:30] privileged in knowing what Independence
[22:32] means
[22:33] brother Brown talked a lot about America
[22:35] and the country and how privileged we
[22:37] were and we live in a privileged Nation
[22:39] today that we have what many other
[22:41] countries do not have
[22:43] many other countries do not have Liberty
[22:46] they do not have freedom
[22:48] they have the government has the power
[22:50] to do whatever now we know that we're
[22:52] getting in shaky Rocky times and the
[22:54] government is definitely putting its
[22:56] thumb down on us but to the believer
[22:58] they have no control
[23:00] if Satan is controlling the government
[23:02] and the prophet and the word says that
[23:04] the the Satan has no control over us how
[23:06] can the government control us
[23:08] oh that may get you kicked out of a lot
[23:10] of places may get you thrown in jail
[23:13] but it's the truth the government can't
[23:14] control the Christian
[23:16] everything you need everything you want
[23:18] everything you desire as a Christian
[23:20] it's theirs for you and the government
[23:21] can't take it away
[23:23] they didn't give it to you they can't
[23:25] take it away
[23:30] in a couple of days we're going to
[23:32] celebrate
[23:34] this nation is going to celebrate the
[23:36] Fourth of July
[23:38] and in that celebration we're going to
[23:40] find will there be cookouts there'll be
[23:42] Gatherings there will be bonfires
[23:44] there'll be fireworks all over the
[23:46] country
[23:47] and they're celebrating an Independence
[23:49] Day an independence day that was signed
[23:52] in 1776.
[23:55] over 200 years ago 247 I'm not mistaken
[23:58] I'm a bicentennial baby 76.
[24:03] it's easy math when I do it that way
[24:08] but it was signed over 200 almost 50
[24:11] years ago
[24:13] and in that declaration approved by the
[24:16] Continental Congress
[24:17] these American colonies that came over
[24:20] here
[24:21] they were they were tired of being ruled
[24:23] by Britain
[24:25] let me tell you this some morning
[24:28] we have no reason but I am tired of
[24:31] being ruled by Satan
[24:33] you say well you say you overcome you've
[24:35] got this you got that
[24:37] and we do
[24:39] but he has not done trying to rule
[24:42] the word told us he killed still destroy
[24:45] that's his job and that's what he's
[24:48] going to continue to do and but brothers
[24:49] and sisters it's time that we look the
[24:51] enemy right in the eyes and say devil we
[24:54] are tired of being ruled we are tired of
[24:57] you ruling in our homes we're tired of
[25:00] you ruling in our marriages we're tired
[25:02] of you ruling over our children
[25:05] we are tired of this and I'm going to
[25:08] make a declaration today
[25:11] there was a declaration that was signed
[25:13] our forefathers one to become their own
[25:15] country their own Nation they didn't
[25:17] want to be ruled anymore and we as
[25:20] Believers as Christians we need to look
[25:22] at the Devil and say we want our own
[25:23] country
[25:25] we want our own domain devil and you
[25:27] have no rights in it when we when we
[25:30] make our own domain in Jesus Christ we
[25:32] put up a sign out there that says no
[25:34] trespassing
[25:36] this land is my land
[25:39] God said everywhere The Souls of my feet
[25:41] tried I could possess
[25:43] and I'm going to possess the joy and I'm
[25:46] going to possess happiness and I'm going
[25:47] to possess life
[25:49] devil no trespassing
[25:55] you see sometimes
[25:57] we have to grow in anger
[26:01] in the world can you say that
[26:03] well brother Brown said
[26:05] it's your righteous indignation
[26:08] and he said for you Baptist I'm just
[26:10] angry
[26:15] sometimes we have to get angry at Satan
[26:19] sometimes we have to get furious with
[26:21] Satan and the problem is talking about
[26:23] shamgar we preached on him a lot
[26:26] but here she hears this Army coming to
[26:29] come and destroy his house to destroy
[26:31] what God has given him everything he has
[26:33] walked and worked and possessed now the
[26:36] enemy's coming to take it and the
[26:38] prophets that he hears those the the
[26:40] truths coming and the trumping of the
[26:43] Soldier's feet and he said at that time
[26:45] his righteous gets in the nation begin
[26:47] to rise up and come upon him and he said
[26:50] he got a little bit of fight in him
[26:54] brothers and sisters let me tell you
[26:56] this you can't have life liberty in the
[26:59] pursuit of happiness without some fight
[27:00] in you
[27:02] you don't have to be able to find in
[27:04] this last day you have to be able to
[27:05] stand up and look Satan in the face and
[27:07] say Bring It On My God Is Bigger Than
[27:09] You
[27:14] he said that's what you got to get you
[27:16] got to get a little fighting
[27:18] you
[27:20] a little Backbone in you
[27:23] not a wish phone but a backbone and he
[27:26] said I can't help but think about old
[27:28] buddy Robbins and he said buddy Robin
[27:30] stood out there and he said I tell you
[27:31] what God Lord give me a backbone like a
[27:34] saw log
[27:35] and give me the knowledge and the Gable

[27:42] and when I don't let me gum him to death
[27:48] fight
[27:51] life liberty

[28:24] you've allowed Satan to control
[28:27] right now I ask yourself every one of
[28:29] you got something in your mind
[28:31] every one of you has got some thought in
[28:33] your mind and you say Satan's been
[28:35] taught toying around in this portion

[28:39] he's been toying around in this portion
[28:43] yep are you with me how many is honest
[28:47] raise your hands if Satan has been
[28:48] talking to you and toying with you hands
[28:51] all over the building
[28:52] so we're fighting the Real Enemy this
[28:54] morning
[28:55] we're in a real battle this morning he
[28:58] says oh shangar his righteous signing
[29:01] Nation stood up he looked around he
[29:02] couldn't find nothing because he wasn't
[29:04] a warrior
[29:08] he wasn't a warrior
[29:11] you say well I can't do nothing for God
[29:13] I'm not a preacher God didn't call me to
[29:15] preach God didn't call me to sing God
[29:17] didn't call me to do this Shanghai was
[29:20] not a warrior
[29:22] but when something began to rise up in
[29:24] him when something began to rise up and
[29:27] he must say no more Satan
[29:29] no more Satan and that's what we got to
[29:31] do as Believers I don't care what your
[29:33] role is what God has called you to do
[29:35] let that righteous indignation rise up
[29:38] in you and say no matter what God's
[29:40] called me to do one thing I can do is
[29:42] fight the devil
[29:51] he said he grabbed out of ox code
[29:54] with that brass lump on it
[29:57] and he said he must use it sometimes to
[29:59] clean the plow
[30:01] and he used it sometimes to punch the
[30:04] cattle through the gate
[30:05] he said but oh he was sick and tired
[30:07] with a Philistines coming
[30:09] he said aren't you tired mother
[30:12] aren't you tired sister
[30:15] listen he's talking to the people now

[30:31] you tired
[30:32] but Satan has come in and begins to toy
[30:35] and rule in your mind
[30:38] the greatest Battlefield
[30:42] he said oh my you say I can't walk I
[30:45] can't do this I can't do that God bless
[30:47] your heart
[30:49] now in the South that's not really a
[30:51] good saying
[30:53] that means uh you're mistaken in your in
[30:56] your thoughts right there
[30:58] bless your heart
[31:00] well so-and-so's this way and that way
[31:02] will bless their heart that's a nice way
[31:04] of saying uh they need to make some
[31:06] changes
[31:15] believe and shamgar said I'm sick and
[31:17] tired of it although I'm not a war a
[31:20] warrior odd stacked against me no matter
[31:23] how much they are stacked against you
[31:25] God is for you if you'll take his word
[31:30] oh
[31:35] before the Declaration of Independence
[31:37] was signed
[31:40] America
[31:41] was part of the Kingdom of Great Britain
[31:44] in the 1600s people came from Great
[31:47] Britain to settle down in North America
[31:50] ever started out with 13 colonies I
[31:52] won't name them you probably know your
[31:54] history well enough
[31:56] 13 colonies began to form up and and
[31:59] over time these 13 colonies began to
[32:01] grow
[32:02] and they begin to get stronger and they
[32:04] begin to get United
[32:07] I wonder why we're called the United
[32:08] States of America
[32:11] and they begin to grow and they begin to
[32:13] unite but then Britain began to look at
[32:14] this and said hey I don't like the way
[32:17] this is going
[32:18] and these uprising of this Colonies
[32:20] begin to look at this and say hey we
[32:22] don't like the way this is going either
[32:24] you're mistreating us
[32:26] you're treating us unfairly
[32:30] how many would look at it this morning
[32:33] and say Satan has treated me unfairly
[32:37] yeah can anybody say Satan's ever
[32:40] treated you fair
[32:42] I want to see you I want to I want to
[32:44] shake your hand and we need to talk
[32:49] nobody can
[32:52] Satan has treated us fairly
[32:57] Britain was not treating the Americans
[32:59] fairly they begin to charge taxes upon
[33:03] their tea
[33:06] you know what Britain's like tea
[33:09] time
[33:10] crumpets and tea
[33:13] at certain times of the day am I right
[33:14] brother John certain times a day we're
[33:16] drinking tea right
[33:23] they didn't like it when the government
[33:25] said I'm going to tax you for the things
[33:27] you like
[33:28] how many
[33:30] times has Satan looked at you and said
[33:32] you could have this this and this but
[33:35] you got to give me this
[33:38] oh yeah you know he'll do you that way
[33:40] because that's the way he did Jesus I'll
[33:43] give you all the kingdoms if you'll just
[33:45] give me you
[33:48] so Satan begins to give you anything and
[33:51] let you buy with anything you want and
[33:52] man it seems like fun pleasure is fun
[33:56] it's enjoyable
[33:59] until it's over
[34:03] and Satan comes in there and he begins
[34:05] to tax us and taxes and taxes
[34:10] now watch what else the the American
[34:12] people were not happy about
[34:14] they were not happy because the
[34:16] government said when our British
[34:17] soldiers come into the land of America
[34:20] you've got to give them free passage
[34:22] into your house
[34:24] you've got to let these British soldiers
[34:29] into your homes
[34:31] you have to feed them
[34:34] are you with me
[34:36] don't look at me like you don't know
[34:37] what I'm talking about
[34:40] because I know you know where I'm going
[34:42] with this
[34:43] Satan begins to creep his way into our
[34:45] homes
[34:47] it says I belong here
[34:51] so are you under a governmental rule are
[34:53] you under the rule of God
[34:56] you see these britons they want to keep
[34:58] pushing their way in taxing and taxing
[35:00] and invading our homes that sounds just
[35:02] like the Satan I know
[35:04] he constantly take it from me and taxing
[35:06] me and taking my children and taking my
[35:08] joy and taking my love and taking my
[35:10] peace and taking my job and taking my
[35:12] marriage
[35:15] you can relate to one of those
[35:18] and many many more
[35:22] and these columnists As Americans they
[35:25] had to follow the law they they had to
[35:26] do something but these laws they
[35:28] couldn't go anymore they said we can't
[35:30] do this anymore we're going to have to
[35:31] do something to change this
[35:33] and so a war Springs up
[35:36] and a war begins to take place but
[35:39] fighting wasn't enough
[35:43] fighting the Bible on their own
[35:45] wasn't enough
[35:51] so they decided we're going to get
[35:52] together
[35:54] oh they gonna have a church meeting
[35:59] we're going to have a church meeting
[36:02] we're going to get together we're going
[36:03] to bring all the brothers together
[36:08] and we're going to get a talk and we're
[36:10] going to pray we're gonna
[36:11] how can we take our country back
[36:15] how can we gain our independence and
[36:18] they begin to look at this and Thomas
[36:19] Jefferson leads a group of men and they
[36:22] begin to write a declaration of
[36:24] independence and they're declaring to
[36:27] France their allies and the other people
[36:29] around the world they can be friends
[36:31] with them we're no longer going to be
[36:33] ruled by this government brothers and
[36:35] sisters there's been a declaration
[36:37] written today and that declaration says
[36:41] you no longer have to be ruled under the
[36:43] government of Hell Satan his demon
[36:49] his Wizards his witches
[36:52] you no longer have to be ruled under
[36:55] that Dominion
[36:59] praise be to God
[37:02] and because of that this Declaration of
[37:04] Independence is now recognized around
[37:06] the world as a declaration of Freedom a
[37:10] declaration of independence and the
[37:13] second sentence says it all that Tom
[37:14] Thomas Jefferson coined he says we're
[37:17] created equally
[37:20] it doesn't matter if you're a preacher
[37:22] it doesn't matter if you're a prophet it
[37:25] doesn't matter if you're the janitor
[37:29] you have the right
[37:33] to life
[37:35] liberty and the pursuit of happiness God
[37:39] wants us to be living vessels let me
[37:41] tell you brothers and sisters the only
[37:43] place that there will be death is hell
[37:47] there's where the separation takes place
[37:49] God wants us to be Lively vessels God
[37:53] wants us to be praise for vessels God
[37:55] wants us to be worshiping vessels alive
[37:58] and living and free to do what God would
[38:01] have us to do to praise and worship God
[38:03] and spread the word of the Gospel around
[38:06] the world
[38:09] foreign
[38:11] Jesus says a thief cometh not but for to
[38:14] steal
[38:16] to kill and to destroy
[38:19] bye
[38:20] I am calm that they may have life and
[38:23] they may have it more abundantly
[38:27] let's break us down just a little bit
[38:29] then we're going to get into some
[38:30] characters
[38:32] when Jesus begins to say this according
[38:34] to these words this thief comes in to
[38:36] steal to kill and destroy everything
[38:39] good in your life
[38:41] everything good
[38:43] in your life he wants to destroy your
[38:46] job your joy your happiness your health
[38:48] your finances
[38:49] your marriage your kids
[38:52] and he wants to ruin anything he can if
[38:54] he can get his hands on it
[38:57] and when we look at the word Thief it
[38:59] comes from a Greek word called klepto
[39:03] how many has ever heard of a
[39:04] kleptomaniac
[39:06] klepto and that word klepto means to
[39:09] steal
[39:11] it's like a bandit
[39:13] or a pickpocketer
[39:15] you know you've seen these videos I've
[39:17] seen videos in the past where these
[39:19] professional pickpocketers
[39:23] you don't know they've got your billfold
[39:27] you don't know that they've got your
[39:28] watch
[39:30] you don't know that they've got your
[39:31] ring
[39:32] you don't know that they've got your
[39:34] socks
[39:36] they're good
[39:38] they walk through the streets and they
[39:40] can bump into you and the next thing you
[39:41] know your wallet is gone and you're like
[39:42] work
[39:44] how often does Satan
[39:47] hit us in that kind of fashion how often
[39:49] do Satan just come and you're walking
[39:51] down the road and everything happy
[39:52] you're with your family everything's
[39:53] good you're joyous maybe you're on
[39:55] vacation and it's just a wonderful time
[39:58] and bump and all of a sudden everybody's
[40:00] mad at everybody
[40:02] yeah
[40:03] some of you looking at me smiling you
[40:06] know what I'm talking about
[40:08] you had set off on a trip and
[40:10] everybody's just happy we're going to
[40:12] Florida we're going to Disney we're
[40:13] going to wherever the next thing you
[40:16] know these two are fighting at these two
[40:17] and these things what happened
[40:19] there was a kleptomaniac got in your
[40:22] vehicle
[40:23] Satan come in and bumped into you and
[40:25] said Riot chaos confusion
[40:31] I'm taking their joy and their happiness
[40:34] and their peace
[40:38] klepto
[40:39] this kleptomaniac means it's a person
[40:42] that's very cunning and Sly and sneaky
[40:46] and the way that he steals from the
[40:48] people
[40:53] the devil knows if he just outrightly
[40:56] if he come up to you and spoke to you
[40:58] sister Patty said I'm let me tell you
[41:00] I'm fixing to take your joy what would
[41:01] you say
[41:03] no
[41:04] if he come and knocked on your door and
[41:06] said I'm fixing to take your children
[41:09] down a road that you'll never get them
[41:10] back what would you say sister Tammy no
[41:14] if they knocked on your door you heard
[41:15] about the rattlesnakes I'm going to give
[41:17] you a box of rattlesnakes what would you
[41:19] do you'd send them back same thing on
[41:20] this contrast if he come in and said I'm
[41:23] going to take this from you or I'm going
[41:24] to take this from you you would say no
[41:27] but he's Sly and he's cunning and he
[41:29] comes in here and he begins to work his
[41:31] way in and weasel his way in
[41:34] that you never knew it happened
[41:38] many times until the damage is
[41:42] oh now now you see why we got to guard
[41:45] ourselves so much while we have to guard
[41:48] our hearts so much why we have to be the
[41:50] Holy Ghost for our children until they
[41:52] get it
[41:54] oh
[41:56] these people letting their kids run
[41:58] anywhere they want to go
[42:01] it's pathetic
[42:04] well
[42:08] we see
[42:11] um
[42:14] I won't say I'll just say it this way
[42:17] little girls on Facebook
[42:20] dressing in such ways
[42:24] that would make a grown man blush
[42:27] where is the holy ghost in the home
[42:32] it's not there
[42:33] Satan has crept in and he snuck in and
[42:36] he's beginning to take and he begins to
[42:38] say I'll just I'll just remove this
[42:41] I can remove that it's just an inch here
[42:44] it's just an inch there
[42:47] and before you know it
[42:50] huh
[42:52] naked and don't even know it
[42:58] well that wasn't in my note so
[43:01] it's free for somebody
[43:04] that's wise parents
[43:06] I just keep getting the pull here that's
[43:09] wise parents we have to make sure
[43:11] whether we want to be in church or not
[43:14] that we are sitting in the pews every
[43:17] service the door is open
[43:19] why is that it may not be few you may be
[43:22] solid but your kids your little boys
[43:24] your little girls they need to know a
[43:26] god
[43:27] they need to know God that you know
[43:32] don't stay out of church
[43:37] your children are too important
[43:41] we put so much importance on so many
[43:43] things but your children that you are
[43:45] raising God do you realize God has
[43:48] granted you the privilege to Bear
[43:51] children and to be fathers and mothers
[43:54] to children in this day and says raise
[43:56] them right teach them right and when
[43:59] they get older they will not depart and
[44:01] then we wonder why our kids sometimes go
[44:03] down roads and we think how did they get
[44:05] there I went to church once a month
[44:11] help me
[44:13] help me preach
[44:18] foreign
[44:23] he don't come at you outright
[44:27] this word klepto
[44:29] is a person who has uncontrollable urges
[44:32] to thieve
[44:35] he can't help himself
[44:37] sane can't help this self
[44:41] it's an uncontrollable urge that he has
[44:43] that says I've got to take from him I've
[44:44] got to take from him I got to take from
[44:46] them
[44:51] persistent neurotic impulsive behavior
[44:53] to steal
[44:54] he can't help but still
[44:57] it's his impulse
[45:01] not only does he come to steal
[45:04] but he says he comes to kill
[45:08] now listen to this
[45:10] this word kill here
[45:12] has a little different connotation than
[45:14] murder
[45:16] stabbing shooting
[45:19] no this connotate this connotation here
[45:22] of the word uh uh to it means to
[45:26] sacrifice
[45:28] when it's talking about killing here
[45:30] it's talking about the old time religion
[45:33] where they used to have the animals to
[45:34] come up and sacrifice on the altar
[45:37] so the word kill here means to sacrifice
[45:39] so what is he trying to get you to do
[45:41] he's trying to get you to surrender
[45:45] oh he's trying to get you to give up
[45:47] something
[45:51] what's he trying to get you again
[45:53] get up something he could
[45:55] let me tell you he knows you better than
[45:58] you know you
[46:00] we think we know ourselves we think we
[46:04] know our limitations we think we know
[46:06] what we can do and get by with and not
[46:07] get hooked in come on Church
[46:10] Satan knows better than what you do and
[46:12] when he can't steal it from you he's
[46:14] going to get you to sacrifice it and say
[46:15] oh well God gave me this but this ain't
[46:19] going good so I'm fixing to give it back
[46:28] um
[46:34] if he hadn't walked away with your your
[46:36] belongings
[46:38] he's going to get you to
[46:40] again give it up
[46:45] you see he can't accept
[46:48] that you possess any kind of blessing
[46:52] once the devil fights you the hardest
[46:58] well he does that
[47:00] but when things are going good
[47:04] right
[47:07] business is good home is good kids are
[47:10] good life is good and then he comes
[47:13] knocking
[47:15] he's not a vacuum cleaner salesman
[47:16] knocking on your door
[47:19] now
[47:22] it looks like you're doing pretty good
[47:24] in life buddy
[47:27] can we sit down and have a cup of coffee
[47:32] maybe turn on the evening news
[47:38] maybe he can get you to turn the channel
[47:43] maybe you find yourself looking at
[47:45] things you shouldn't be looking at
[47:48] man is is this Micah brother Micah can
[47:52] can you hear me can can you turn this up
[47:54] a little I'm just kidding
[47:59] [Applause]
[48:00] and you find yourself involved in
[48:03] situations that are not pleasing to God
[48:07] and you are
[48:08] partaking
[48:11] you find yourself enjoying oh come on
[48:16] and he's he's got you there in such a
[48:18] way that he simply don't want you to
[48:20] have love anymore
[48:26] so you sacrifice the very things you
[48:30] love
[48:32] as Satan comes to destroy
[48:38] this word here means to ruin
[48:42] to waste to trash to devastate
[48:46] so if he can't take it from you
[48:49] or get you to give it to him
[48:51] he's just gonna trash it
[48:56] you know well man how could he do that
[48:57] what what how could how could he what
[48:59] kind of avenues could he go to our young
[49:01] people are vulnerable
[49:05] you took a young Christian
[49:08] lady young Christian man
[49:11] young man
[49:13] virtuous
[49:17] how Satan would love to destroy
[49:21] that virtue
[49:23] you say Well it wouldn't happen to mine
[49:27] be careful
[49:30] I've seen so many people around this
[49:32] message say if that was my kid
[49:35] 10 years later that's their kid
[49:42] what is that
[49:44] it's Satan coming in there and he begins
[49:46] to say hey I can't get them to quit
[49:48] Church
[49:49] they're there every service I can't get
[49:52] them to to go and do things in the world
[49:55] because they they go to church every
[49:57] Sunday can't get them to go to the
[49:59] movies or the bowling alleys I can't get
[50:00] them to go to those places but what I
[50:03] can do is I can get them to compromise
[50:04] on what they believe
[50:08] it's okay to cut your hair
[50:10] it's okay young ladies to to kiss this
[50:13] young man because he really loves you
[50:16] lie
[50:18] you don't know what love is until you've
[50:20] been married for a few months years
[50:23] you don't know what love is until you've
[50:25] been through some hard times
[50:27] that's why we have divorces all around
[50:29] America all around the world a divorce
[50:31] rate's higher than it's ever been ever
[50:33] and it continues to rise
[50:36] is because they don't know how to get
[50:38] through hard times
[50:42] they don't know what that true love
[50:43] really is they've never had to get down
[50:45] there and fight through it and fight and
[50:47] say this is my marriage Satan
[50:51] this is my home Satan you say man I live
[50:56] 20 30 years of the first 20 30 years of
[50:58] my marriage was nothing but hell on
[51:00] Earth but you made it
[51:02] yeah
[51:05] you've been allowed Satan to come in and
[51:08] to destroy it we have couples in this
[51:10] church I know couples around this
[51:12] country that they begin to fight and
[51:15] when I say fight they fought
[51:17] but after that fight was over they began
[51:19] to fight for one another they found
[51:21] themselves in church they found
[51:23] themselves in front of a pastor a
[51:25] god-filled pastor they got wisdom they
[51:27] got knowledge and they begin to pray and
[51:29] they thought and said Satan you will not
[51:31] destroy my home
[51:35] foreign
[51:41] because sometimes Satan's already got a
[51:43] hold of one too far
[51:46] you notice I said they
[51:49] they fought
[51:51] they fought for their marriage it takes
[51:53] more than just one
[51:57] if we were to read John chapter 10 verse
[52:00] 10 and put it into a a easy to translate
[52:03] interpretation this is the way it would
[52:05] read
[52:07] the thief wants to get his hands into
[52:08] every good thing in your life in fact
[52:11] his pickpocket is looking for an
[52:13] opportunity to wiggle his way so deeply
[52:16] into your personal affairs that he can
[52:18] walk off with everything you hold
[52:20] precious and dear and that's not
[52:23] at all when he's finished stealing all
[52:26] your goods and possession he'll take his
[52:28] plan to rob you blind to the next level
[52:31] he'll create conditions and situations
[52:33] so horrible that you'll see no way to
[52:36] solve the problem except to sacrifice
[52:38] everything that remains from his
[52:40] previous attacks
[52:42] yeah the goal of this thief is to
[52:44] totally waste and devastate your life if
[52:48] nothing stops him he'll leave you
[52:50] insolvent flat broke cleaned out in
[52:54] every area of your life you'll end up
[52:56] feeling as if you are finished and out
[52:58] of business make no mistake the enemy's
[53:01] ultimate aim is to obliterate you you
[53:06] does that clarify that scripture for you
[53:10] who
[53:11] brothers and sisters thank God that the
[53:13] verse don't stop there
[53:14] thank God that the verse don't stop
[53:16] there but Jesus speaks up and says wait
[53:19] a minute hold up we're not done yet
[53:21] don't get discouraged don't get
[53:23] depressed let me tell you ah
[53:27] ah say it with me I am come that they
[53:31] may have life and have it more
[53:34] abundantly
[53:38] when you look at that word abundant
[53:40] it means it means uh life Jesus's very
[53:45] life Zoe
[53:47] you heard the prophet talk about Zoe
[53:49] God's own life living on the inside it's
[53:52] God's life on the inside God's Freedom
[53:55] God's Liberty God's happiness
[53:58] living on the inside
[54:06] so if we would continue that scripture
[54:10] in layman's terms
[54:12] it would say but Jesus came
[54:15] that I might have
[54:18] keep and constantly retain a Vitality
[54:21] Augusto a vigorous zest for living that
[54:24] Springs up from deep down inside of me
[54:28] and then he came that I might Embrace
[54:31] this unrivaled unequaled muchless
[54:34] incomparable richly loaded overflowing
[54:37] life to the ultimate happiness
[54:42] let's give him a phrase clap this
[54:43] morning
[54:44] that's what God wants for you ultimate
[54:47] happiness ultimate maximum satisfaction
[54:51] in the word and God
[54:58] I think we're on time
[55:00] I think
[55:04] you say brothers and sisters there'll be
[55:05] times
[55:06] when the devil
[55:09] no matter how strong you are no matter
[55:11] how rooted you are no matter how
[55:12] faithful you are no matter how much Zoe
[55:15] you got
[55:17] he's going to come and push our buttons
[55:20] and he's going to push this button and
[55:22] he's going to push that button and he's
[55:24] going to encourage this thought and that
[55:26] thought you're not you're not up you're
[55:28] not a a uh immune to it
[55:32] he's coming for you
[55:34] you say well I'm in church this morning
[55:36] I feel the Holy Ghost this morning
[55:40] he's coming for you
[55:46] but whenever these attacks occur
[55:48] that's when we got to tell the devil
[55:49] shut up
[55:52] you know I hate that word shut up I
[55:54] never would let my kids tell each other
[55:56] that you don't tell nobody shut up
[55:57] that's that's bad but to the devil I say
[56:00] shut up
[56:02] I'm not biting at your bait no more you
[56:05] can go fishing all you want
[56:07] you can't throw enough different colors
[56:10] at me you know how fishing works I'm
[56:11] coming to find out if they ain't biting
[56:13] you better change bait
[56:15] if they ain't biting the spinner you
[56:17] throw a plug if they ain't buying a plug
[56:18] you throw a worm if any biting blue you
[56:20] throw red if they ain't buying red you
[56:22] throw clear
[56:25] and it don't matter brothers and sisters
[56:27] what Satan throws the lure in front of
[56:29] your face
[56:30] and begins to entice you
[56:33] and jiggle
[56:35] and wiggle
[56:36] you say Satan I'm not biting any more
[56:41] no fishing
[56:44] foreign
[56:45] he wants you defeated he wants you sick
[56:47] he wants you depressed he wants you down
[56:49] in the dumps miserable
[56:56] can we get into my fault now
[57:00] you say how do I get this life and
[57:02] Liberty in the pursuit of happiness
[57:04] where can we find this in the Bible how
[57:06] can we find somebody who let everything
[57:07] else go
[57:09] and went on a journey to happiness
[57:13] turn with me in the Book of Ruth
[57:24] I think it's right after judges it's
[57:25] kind of four pages there
[57:36] say Amen when you got Ruth
[57:40] don't be fibbing I still hear Pages
[57:42] turning
[57:45] praise the Lord I'm just saying if
[57:47] you're awake
[57:49] Ruth chapter one
[57:52] let's go to verse 14.
[57:55] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[57:57] again and ortha kissed her mother-in-law
[58:00] but Ruth clave unto her
[58:04] and she said behold my sister-in-law has
[58:06] gone back unto her people and unto her
[58:09] gods
[58:10] return Thou after thy says their law
[58:16] Naomi's telling Ruth go whack with orpha
[58:20] Bible scholars think these two were
[58:21] actually sisters
[58:23] go back with your sister go back with
[58:24] your sister however you want to put it
[58:26] they knew each other for many many years
[58:28] they were both moabites go back with her
[58:31] go back to your people go back to your
[58:33] Gods go back to your mother and Ruth
[58:36] and Ruth said and treat me not to leave
[58:39] thee
[58:40] or to return from following after thee
[58:43] for wither thou goest I will go
[58:46] where I thou lodges I will Lodge and thy
[58:51] people shall be my people and thy God my
[58:54] God
[58:57] where thou diced Naomi
[59:01] I'll die
[59:02] and where you're buried I'll bury
[59:06] the Lord so do me and more also if ought
[59:10] but death part thee in me
[59:15] we're looking at the Book of Ruth here
[59:17] and when you look at the Book of Ruth
[59:18] you can see a journey
[59:20] of Sorrow a famine of hurt and pain
[59:25] and you see a journey that has taken a
[59:27] place and it's taken somebody uh down a
[59:29] road that was so much hurt involved that
[59:31] they begin to find life
[59:33] and in that life they begin to live and
[59:35] then they begin to find Liberty
[59:38] some freedom
[59:40] and in that freedom they begin to find
[59:42] what
[59:43] happiness
[59:45] so here we are there's a famine that
[59:47] breaks out in devastates Bethlehem Naomi
[59:50] and her husband they sojourn into Moab
[59:53] and these these uh
[59:55] Naomi and her husband and the two boys
[59:57] go into into the land of Moab and they
[1:00:00] find two young women and they begin to
[1:00:02] marry so they get married and they're
[1:00:04] going on about their business
[1:00:06] and they take these wives Ruth and orpa
[1:00:09] but after a decade or so
[1:00:12] these women are left alone
[1:00:15] Naomi's husband dies
[1:00:17] roof's husband dies orpa's husband dies
[1:00:23] and so here they are find themselves all
[1:00:25] alone
[1:00:26] and Naomi hearing about a faith uh about
[1:00:29] the faithfulness of God to his people
[1:00:31] back in her Homeland she says they
[1:00:34] beginning to prosper
[1:00:35] there's nothing for me here in the land
[1:00:37] of Moab of the moabites
[1:00:39] I'm going to go back to my land you
[1:00:42] girls stay here
[1:00:45] orpa and Ruth both say no we'll go with
[1:00:48] you
[1:00:49] Naomi then again a bag that says no you
[1:00:53] go back you stay here you don't go with
[1:00:56] me you stay right here you go back to
[1:00:58] your people
[1:00:59] go back to your gods
[1:01:02] but Ruth says don't press me to go and
[1:01:06] abandon you
[1:01:08] and the Bible says she clave
[1:01:12] and I've loved that word since the first
[1:01:14] time I've read it in the scripture years
[1:01:16] and years ago I preached this several
[1:01:18] times
[1:01:19] and Ruth clave
[1:01:22] to Naomi
[1:01:24] she grabbed the whole time her brothers
[1:01:26] and sisters sometimes in life you just
[1:01:28] have to grab a hold of the promises of
[1:01:30] God
[1:01:31] you just gotta grab a hold of what God
[1:01:33] has given you and what God has promised
[1:01:35] you and say no matter what I Won't Let
[1:01:38] Go
[1:01:42] you say Satan's a toying with my
[1:01:44] children I Won't Let Go
[1:01:47] Satan's toying with my marriage I Won't
[1:01:50] Let Go
[1:01:53] and Ruth had that passion about her I
[1:01:56] won't let go of you Naomi I'm gonna go
[1:01:58] where you go the Bible says that orpha
[1:02:02] she went by
[1:02:04] back to her old people and she kissed
[1:02:07] Naomi
[1:02:09] goodbye
[1:02:12] see you later
[1:02:14] I'm going back to my people
[1:02:16] I'm going back to my gods
[1:02:20] um
[1:02:22] see sometimes when hardship comes
[1:02:25] there's where you see where people's at
[1:02:27] do they clave to God
[1:02:30] or do they kiss God goodbye
[1:02:36] you'll find out what you're made of when
[1:02:38] you go through the hard times
[1:02:40] Brother David and I were talking he said
[1:02:42] this week's been a battle
[1:02:44] foreign
[1:02:48] and I made the mistake one of the very
[1:02:51] few I shouldn't say the very few times
[1:02:52] I've made a mistake I've made many
[1:02:53] mistakes
[1:02:55] but one thing I never do I don't talk
[1:02:56] about what I'm going to preach
[1:02:58] well we have is about a five hour drive
[1:03:00] on the road the other day and I just
[1:03:02] tell Joyce what I'm going to preach
[1:03:04] devil
[1:03:05] oh boy did he hear
[1:03:09] he began to nitpick
[1:03:11] he began to cause every problem
[1:03:14] he began to throw up obstacles
[1:03:20] my wife bless her
[1:03:22] I love her with all my heart
[1:03:26] and she knows what I'm about to say
[1:03:32] she thinks that when we go on trips you
[1:03:35] wait till you get where you're going to
[1:03:36] get a hotel
[1:03:41] let me tell you you don't do that when
[1:03:43] Cincinnati Reds are playing in
[1:03:45] Cincinnati and Taylor Swift
[1:03:47] is in Cincinnati
[1:03:49] we didn't know the Reds were playing and
[1:03:51] we sure didn't know Taylor Swift was
[1:03:53] performing
[1:03:55] we had to go pick Carson up
[1:03:59] my wife has a habit of
[1:04:04] finding us the not so nice the hotels
[1:04:08] let's just say I've been on many
[1:04:09] missionary trips in the United States of
[1:04:11] America
[1:04:19] so we
[1:04:21] we're driving she said they're in a
[1:04:22] hotel nowhere around
[1:04:25] holiday ends if you could find one
[1:04:27] within 20 miles was 600 a night
[1:04:32] Taylor Swift Ross a expensive group of
[1:04:35] people
[1:04:39] she says I found one she's talking this
[1:04:41] woman on the phone on speakerphone and
[1:04:43] I'll take some blame too because I don't
[1:04:46] like to drive around looking for hotels
[1:04:48] and Lord I don't know why I'm on this
[1:04:50] tangent
[1:04:52] it'll help somebody
[1:04:54] and so she says I found one it's a
[1:04:56] hundred and eleven dollars
[1:05:00] get it
[1:05:02] it's the only one get it get it
[1:05:06] she got it
[1:05:10] we pull up to this Motel Six
[1:05:16] the the
[1:05:19] soft it's falling off the side of it
[1:05:26] and the Lord only knows what kind of
[1:05:28] crowd will stay in there
[1:05:29] we go in check in I'm not saying
[1:05:31] anything
[1:05:33] I thought well it's gonna be all right
[1:05:35] it's gonna be all right
[1:05:37] here we go start walking up the stairs
[1:05:39] and just the smell of
[1:05:43] just the smile
[1:05:46] is enough to knock you
[1:05:48] and I'm talking open-air stairs it's
[1:05:51] enough to just about Knock You Down
[1:05:53] and we just continue to go to our room
[1:05:55] and she puts the key in on the keypad
[1:05:57] opens up the door
[1:05:59] first thing I see is the bedspreads got
[1:06:01] a tear in it
[1:06:03] not to mention the smell inside that
[1:06:05] room
[1:06:09] we walk in and I'm holding my bags I'm
[1:06:12] not putting nothing down listen I'm a
[1:06:13] nurse I've seen bed bugs I know what
[1:06:15] they do I know how they infest
[1:06:17] so I'm holding my bags I got my shoes or
[1:06:20] my bag and I'm standing there on this
[1:06:21] and I'm looking and there's hair on the
[1:06:23] floor there's dirt on the floor
[1:06:26] and there's stuff smeared on the walls
[1:06:29] I said I can't do this
[1:06:31] I can't do this she said well you're
[1:06:34] gonna have to go get their money back
[1:06:35] then
[1:06:36] so I go down there and the young man at
[1:06:39] the counter listen I said we've made a
[1:06:41] mistake
[1:06:42] I said we we the room's just not it's
[1:06:45] not okay I said it smells I said we
[1:06:48] don't smoke we're not smokers he said
[1:06:50] you got a smoking room I said no no no
[1:06:52] no I didn't order a smoking room
[1:06:55] the woman on the phone must have gave us
[1:06:57] that
[1:07:01] and so we're going on about our business
[1:07:03] there and
[1:07:04] finally he says okay you can have it
[1:07:06] back
[1:07:08] so he gives us our credit minus the fee
[1:07:10] for the booking agency or whatever so
[1:07:13] now the devil begins to poke at me
[1:07:19] you don't have a room
[1:07:22] you're gonna have to drive an hour back
[1:07:24] to Lexington
[1:07:26] and I'm thinking now there's a room
[1:07:28] somewhere
[1:07:30] Priceline Expedia hotels.com
[1:07:34] I'm going down through our 600 500 300
[1:07:37] 400 500 oh man she says I found one I
[1:07:41] said
[1:07:44] okay
[1:07:49] the dab up against the Poke is making me
[1:07:51] angry
[1:07:53] we had a very good trip on the way up
[1:07:56] until I told her what I was going to
[1:07:58] preach
[1:08:00] and he begins to poke
[1:08:02] and prod
[1:08:05] so long story short we get into one that
[1:08:09] at least we can
[1:08:11] feel somewhat comfortable about laying
[1:08:14] down in and and uh I got up take a
[1:08:17] shower the next time I wouldn't I I
[1:08:19] wouldn't pull my shoes off I was walking
[1:08:21] around in my tennis shoes all night
[1:08:24] and it's
[1:08:26] I took a shower and I put a spread of
[1:08:28] towel out in the bottom of the I said I
[1:08:31] would have took if I did if I hadn't
[1:08:33] wanted to ruin my tent I've been afraid
[1:08:35] to ruin my tennis shoes I took a shower
[1:08:37] in my tennis shoes
[1:08:40] but we made it
[1:08:42] but that's the way the devil is he
[1:08:44] begins to poke and he begins to prod and
[1:08:46] he begins to to get at you and you're in
[1:08:49] your home and in your children
[1:08:50] and he begins to get these things to
[1:08:52] bowl up and and Bowl up inside of you
[1:08:56] and and Orba chose to go back to her
[1:08:59] people to hurt gods
[1:09:02] but Ruth says no
[1:09:07] I'm not going to let go
[1:09:09] and Ruth is sitting there and she's
[1:09:11] holding on you know the easier Road for
[1:09:13] Ruth you know what it would have been
[1:09:15] the easy Road
[1:09:16] it would have been to go back with orpha
[1:09:20] she already had people there you had
[1:09:22] family there she had friends there she
[1:09:24] could have found another man and got
[1:09:25] married and went on about her own Pagan
[1:09:27] life and business
[1:09:31] that would have been the easy way but
[1:09:33] she wanted something more than what orpo
[1:09:35] wanted she has something down on the
[1:09:37] inside and said I want every promise
[1:09:40] that I've seen in the life of you Naomi
[1:09:42] I want every promise that God has to
[1:09:45] give us I'll go with you
[1:09:51] I'm gonna try to tell this story real
[1:09:52] quick stay with it
[1:09:55] yeah
[1:09:56] brother Ron towed it last night I'm
[1:09:59] taking a different aspect of it he told
[1:10:01] it last night at brother or Donnie's
[1:10:03] meetings and so if you've heard it last
[1:10:04] night that's where you heard it
[1:10:07] he says just to show that God will
[1:10:09] respect those who hunger and thirst for
[1:10:11] righteousness
[1:10:13] when we go out there
[1:10:15] and he said I was out there at these
[1:10:17] chartered buses and I heard a noise
[1:10:20] he was at a meeting as you researched he
[1:10:23] was at a meeting and there was thousands
[1:10:25] of people and to come to find out they
[1:10:27] were calling for him to come back to the
[1:10:28] platform or to somebody with an
[1:10:30] ambulance or something and he went to
[1:10:31] the ambulance and they said we need to
[1:10:33] come back to the platform and the guy
[1:10:35] that was with him and ushering through
[1:10:37] the through the meeting said no there's
[1:10:39] over 2 000 people between you and that
[1:10:41] platform you can't go back
[1:10:43] and so he's standing there in his looks
[1:10:45] and he says I see this young colored
[1:10:47] girl like nicely dressed in Arkansas and
[1:10:51] he said she was blind
[1:10:53] and she was trying to find her way
[1:10:55] around calling for Papa
[1:10:57] he said I noticed her because uh she was
[1:11:00] kind of tall she was saying oh papa
[1:11:02] where are you and feeling with her hands
[1:11:05] somebody please help me find Papa
[1:11:09] and he said I stood there and no one
[1:11:12] knew me at that place and he said
[1:11:14] they've had meeting going on in the
[1:11:15] temple and nobody knew me standing
[1:11:17] outside there and she said somebody
[1:11:19] please help me find my papa
[1:11:21] and nobody seemed to pay attention to
[1:11:24] her
[1:11:24] and I said I was standing still watching
[1:11:27] her
[1:11:27] and she come moving through the crowd
[1:11:31] and I thought that old blind Anna in the
[1:11:33] Temple when she prayed so long
[1:11:41] he said I Stood Still and this young
[1:11:43] woman come moving up and she finally she
[1:11:45] staggered right into me and said pardon
[1:11:47] me and she started again and I said who
[1:11:50] are you looking for young lady
[1:11:52] and she said sir I'm looking for my papa
[1:11:55] she said we've come over here from
[1:11:57] Memphis to see the Healer
[1:12:02] so my papa was trying to find a way for
[1:12:04] me to get in and he told me to stand
[1:12:05] still but they pushed me out of my place

[1:12:22] being a hypocrite
[1:12:24] but I said what did you say you came
[1:12:26] over here to see
[1:12:28] she said I came to see the Healer
[1:12:32] she said you see I've been blind for

[1:12:54] believe in such stuff as that do you
[1:12:57] and I said in the days when we got such
[1:12:59] fine doctors
[1:13:02] and she said but you see sir
[1:13:05] they can't do me no good
[1:13:11] you mean to tell me that you believe
[1:13:13] that the prayer of a man would do
[1:13:15] something for you and she said and she
[1:13:19] said it like this and I'll never forget
[1:13:20] it she said I tell you what I'll what

[1:13:52] supposed to see
[1:13:57] he said see how God locks things just
[1:14:00] exactly right

[1:14:07] that and she said are you the Healer

[1:15:12] hold of the prophet of the hour and
[1:15:14] she's holding on for dear life brothers
[1:15:16] and sisters that's what it means to grab
[1:15:18] a halt of life liberty and the pursuit

[1:18:35] uncovered feet
[1:18:38] let's see what happens

[1:19:10] would you spread your wing your cloak
[1:19:13] over your servant
[1:19:15] spread your cloak over you for you are
[1:19:18] Our Redeemer
[1:19:25] Boaz the prophet said representing
[1:19:28] Christ
[1:19:29] he goes into the City and he he didn't
[1:19:32] want this girl to get away and he asked
[1:19:33] who she belonged to and he said he goes
[1:19:36] down there and he says now I'm about to
[1:19:38] redeem all of her possessions
[1:19:41] thank you
[1:19:43] everything that the Satan has taken from
[1:19:47] you
[1:19:49] every heartache that he's caused you
[1:19:52] every day of depression and stress and
[1:19:55] sickness and anxiety that he has put in
[1:19:57] his pocket that belongs to you
[1:20:00] God says Boaz says I've got to go and
[1:20:04] redeem all of those possessions
[1:20:08] everything that's been taken everything
[1:20:11] that's been lost everything that's been
[1:20:13] destroyed everything that's been in
[1:20:15] Ruins I have to restore it all and the
[1:20:19] promise that here is Boaz a type of
[1:20:21] Christ and he goes down there and says I
[1:20:24] got to redeem it the law requires it
[1:20:28] and he asked is there anybody else in
[1:20:31] this city capable of redeeming this
[1:20:34] woman
[1:20:38] and the Bible says there was one
[1:20:41] could have
[1:20:42] but he wasn't capable
[1:20:44] and Boaz says
[1:20:46] they're mine
[1:20:48] all the land that her husband owned
[1:20:52] oh all of the possessions all of the
[1:20:56] cattle all of the sheep all of the oxen
[1:20:58] everything that they owned is now the
[1:21:02] and nobody can
[1:21:07] tell aren't you thankful brothers and
[1:21:09] sisters aren't you thankful that
[1:21:11] everything that you ever lost in your
[1:21:12] life is laying right there and God says
[1:21:14] it's yours and nobody can touch it
[1:21:20] he says what will a young man do for a
[1:21:23] Young Bride for he wants for his
[1:21:24] sweetheart
[1:21:25] oh he's blind
[1:21:28] he said he'll do anything for her
[1:21:31] he'll do anything for her he'll do
[1:21:33] anything she wants there's nothing that
[1:21:35] can stop him because he's got to have
[1:21:37] her and that was Boaz and that was
[1:21:39] Christ to his bride he looks at you and
[1:21:41] says I'll do anything I'll bankrupt
[1:21:44] Heaven I'll go to the cross and die for
[1:21:47] you
[1:21:49] thank you
[1:21:57] he redeemed her back to everything she
[1:21:59] had
[1:22:03] in Christ
[1:22:05] on that Old Rugged Cross
[1:22:09] hang in there and go Gotham
[1:22:12] paid the sin penalty
[1:22:14] we're about to take this communion
[1:22:18] and as he was hanging there on that Old
[1:22:19] Rugged Cross
[1:22:21] it says he was wounded
[1:22:25] yeah
[1:22:26] I did that
[1:22:29] I
[1:22:30] get that
[1:22:32] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:22:35] he was bruised for ironically
[1:22:38] that was me
[1:22:41] you know a lot of times people they
[1:22:42] don't want hard preaching
[1:22:44] they can't handle the prophet they can't
[1:22:45] handle those people that preach that way
[1:22:48] I was telling Joyce
[1:22:50] we got the serious radio and Billy
[1:22:53] Graham Channel
[1:22:55] and it enlightened me of what kind of
[1:22:57] man Billy Graham was
[1:23:00] he said I'm the one
[1:23:03] I'm the one that put him on that cross
[1:23:07] I'm the one that bruised him
[1:23:10] I'm the one
[1:23:12] and then he looked out there and he said
[1:23:13] you're the one
[1:23:16] you're the one that bruised him
[1:23:19] you're the one that wounded him
[1:23:24] but it was for your Liberty
[1:23:26] he hangs on the cross of galgotha
[1:23:30] everything in the human race lost in
[1:23:33] Adam
[1:23:35] is redeemed when Christ himself became
[1:23:38] Ken's Folk
[1:23:42] you say I'm Just a Nobody my family is
[1:23:44] this my family is that we're Renegades
[1:23:46] now
[1:23:47] you can't spoke
[1:23:50] if you've been to Calvary you're in
[1:23:52] Spoke if you can accept cross if you can
[1:23:55] go to the food of the Cross today and
[1:23:56] grab a host of it as Ruth did to Naomi
[1:23:58] and cleave on to that cross
[1:24:05] laughs
[1:24:09] brother sisters Ruth is an example of
[1:24:12] how God can take a hopeless situation
[1:24:16] and turn it into something glorious
[1:24:21] no matter how hopeless your life seems
[1:24:24] today
[1:24:28] I'm just getting a real pool for a
[1:24:30] struggle somebody is struggling
[1:24:34] somebody's struggling with where they're
[1:24:36] living in their life and I'm not I'm not
[1:24:37] here trying to point and prophesive I'm
[1:24:40] just telling you God's laid it on my
[1:24:41] heart if you're that person
[1:24:45] there's a Kinsman
[1:24:48] and it's never too late
[1:24:50] if God's tugging at your heart
[1:24:54] if God is tugging at your heart saying
[1:24:56] this ain't right in your life brother
[1:24:58] sister if this ain't right if your
[1:25:01] family's hurting here if your children's
[1:25:03] hurting there if you're not doing this
[1:25:06] you know to do better that's my iniquity
[1:25:09] that's my transgression
[1:25:12] and he hung on that cross
[1:25:14] so that I don't have to bear it any more
[1:25:19] I'm not only free from Satan's grasp
[1:25:23] and the clenches of Satan in my life
[1:25:26] but I'm free from the mistakes that I
[1:25:29] made
[1:25:31] the wrongs I've done
[1:25:33] the lies I've told
[1:25:36] the mistreating I said
[1:25:38] the words I've said
[1:25:41] the hurt have caused others
[1:25:46] when you look at red on red
[1:25:49] you see white
[1:25:51] foreign
[1:26:01] there's only a special
[1:26:02] people and I'm closing
[1:26:05] but I got to make this point
[1:26:07] orpa
[1:26:10] was a king was a daughter of a king of
[1:26:12] Moab
[1:26:14] and her name orpa means the nape of neck
[1:26:19] that's this part right here
[1:26:22] and the reason that she's carries that
[1:26:24] name you know every name in the Bible
[1:26:25] has a biblical meaning of scriptural
[1:26:27] meaning
[1:26:29] and the reason that she's been known as
[1:26:31] orpah the nape of the neck is because
[1:26:33] when she was addressed face to face with
[1:26:36] Naomi
[1:26:37] earned her back
[1:26:39] and showed her the nape of her neck
[1:26:41] and she walked a lonely dark Road
[1:26:47] not mentioned anymore in the Bible
[1:26:50] there's there's suggestions in Jewish
[1:26:52] writings and Jewish tablets
[1:26:56] we won't get into that
[1:27:00] but let's be a Ruth
[1:27:02] a Ruth whose name means
[1:27:05] passionate friend
[1:27:09] you know there's something about Jesus
[1:27:12] there's something about God
[1:27:14] that when you can look at him
[1:27:16] and he's more than just
[1:27:19] God he's more than just Jesus but he's
[1:27:22] friend
[1:27:27] brother Joe prays it a lot
[1:27:29] and he says Lord my friend
[1:27:33] you're my friend
[1:27:35] he cares
[1:27:36] friends care
[1:27:40] Lord Make Me A Ruth today
[1:27:43] let's stand to our feet
