[51:42] Lord again amen trust you're having a
[51:45] good week so far that'll be all for the
[51:47] music thank you musicians
[51:51] amen I tell you what it just feels so
[51:54] good don't it just to sing those songs
[51:55] of Zion
[51:58] amen from my heart knowing that the very
[52:01] voice that you have the very words that
[52:04] you
[52:05] speak amen the very desire to worship
[52:09] has been placed all been given to you by
[52:12] God it's all been given to us amen
[52:15] wasn't for him we wouldn't have any of
[52:17] it amen how many appreciates God Amen we
[52:21] want to speak on something we've spoken
[52:23] of of course before I don't feel like
[52:25] this is new but
[52:27] amen I was um out in my barn this
[52:29] morning and just kind of meditating on
[52:32] what to speak on
[52:33] and amen I heard uh a noise coming and I
[52:37] thought one of the girls maybe was had
[52:40] their little phone or something coming
[52:41] out to the barn or whatever maybe with
[52:43] some music on or whatever and I listen
[52:45] listen a little harder no it wasn't
[52:47] coming from that it was coming PL back
[52:48] from Micah's House amen and uh so Caleb
[52:53] was back there mikah wasn't back there
[52:55] just Caleb was back there and he was
[52:56] playing some music sounded like he was
[52:58] listen fixing to listen to a preacher or
[53:00] something and and I got to thinking of
[53:03] uh of uh how how that in the hour that
[53:07] we're living in how that people are
[53:10] beginning to worship God more
[53:12] amen and praise him for his goodness and
[53:16] and I be begin to think what brother
[53:18] Diggs had said and amen and and stepping
[53:22] into the vision and how that in this
[53:25] hour it seems like young people and you
[53:28] just hear about it and see it different
[53:30] churches of how people are really
[53:32] pressing in
[53:34] amen there seems to be a move of God
[53:36] going on how many beli there's a move of
[53:38] God going on people are getting ready
[53:41] because the amount of pressure that the
[53:44] devil is putting on people amen is
[53:47] forcing even the Believers to uh put on
[53:50] more pressure Amen on themselves and and
[53:54] to draw amen from the power amen that's
[53:57] available to them amen and so cuz Satan
[54:01] certainly is like a roaring lion if
[54:03] seeking whom he may devour but at the
[54:05] same time we're pressing into it amen
[54:08] and I got to thinking about this song
[54:10] Amen and this is going to be basically
[54:12] my title amen I I begin to think about
[54:15] that song Let the worshippers arise amen
[54:20] me as I was listening that begin and
[54:22] then the Holy Spirit just begin to kind
[54:24] of pour some things out that we're going
[54:25] to share tonight for a little while amen
[54:27] with the help of the Lord so the way
[54:29] that I've thoughted in my mind of going
[54:31] is I might speak about 30 minutes to 40
[54:33] minutes and me and have at least 15
[54:36] minutes or so of worship afterwards
[54:38] maybe now that's the way I think but you
[54:40] know it doesn't always turn out that way
[54:42] but amen so we'll just follow the
[54:44] leading of the spirit with the help of
[54:46] the Lord tonight would that be okay amen
[54:48] and I got to thinking of how much this
[54:50] really matches in with amen with what
[54:52] brother Diggs has said about stepping
[54:54] into div vision and and so forth thought
[54:56] well but this could be almost be part
[54:58] two amen of that kind of different
[55:00] direction because his was amen towards
[55:03] amen the blessings and the promises of
[55:05] God but this evening if you will before
[55:08] we turn the Bible let's just bow our
[55:09] heads and talk to the author Lord Jesus
[55:11] we come before you Lord Jesus thankful
[55:14] that be once again assembled together in
[55:16] Your Name Lord and knowing father
[55:19] wherever two or three are gathered in
[55:21] gathered together you promis that there
[55:23] you would be in their midst and Lord and
[55:25] we believe believe that with all of our
[55:27] heart father once again that we ask God
[55:29] that you'll come Lord Jesus and speak to
[55:32] us along the way Lord help me to just
[55:34] get out of the way Lord that you might
[55:36] use my lips and my thoughts and your
[55:38] word to convey to the people what you
[55:40] have in mind that you want to speak Lord
[55:42] and let every ear be open Lord Jesus
[55:45] both those who are present and those who
[55:47] are out there Lord Jesus listening Amen
[55:49] on the internet Lord we ask God that you
[55:52] just bless each and everyone that hears
[55:53] this word tonight for we ask it in Jesus
[55:56] name amen amen now I'm uh at first I was
[56:00] going to title it let the worshippers
[56:01] arise amen but I told them to put it on
[56:04] the internet as the song that the Angels
[56:08] cannot sing the the song The Angels
[56:11] can't sing amen and our our scene so to
[56:15] speak amen because I always like to look
[56:17] at it kind of that way our scene amen
[56:20] takes us back perhaps all the way Amen
[56:24] on the other side of the rapture it
[56:26] takes us all the way into the presence
[56:30] of God it takes us to the throne of God
[56:32] in Revelations if you will go to
[56:35] Revelations 5 and we want to read uh one
[56:37] there and then in Revelations 19
[56:41] amen amen and we want to look uh when we
[56:43] come before the Throne of God when we
[56:45] come up before the throne after all of
[56:48] this is over with amen and we come home
[56:51] to be with the Lord amen how many's
[56:53] looking forward to that I believe one of
[56:55] these days that that will this will be a
[56:57] reality it'll certain be a vision that
[57:00] we step into amen Revelations 5 and
[57:05] we'll begin with verse 11 and remember
[57:08] this is the scripture that brother
[57:09] brandham took and preached on talking
[57:11] about how that the lamb amen took the
[57:14] book out of the right hand of him that
[57:15] sat on the throne ain't that right amen
[57:18] talking about a strong Angel proclaiming
[57:20] who's worthy to take the book and to
[57:21] loose the seal so amen and on down from
[57:24] that then in verse 11 it says and I
[57:27] beheld and I heard the voice of many
[57:29] angels round about The Throne of the
[57:31] beasts and the elders and the number of
[57:33] them that was 10 thousands times 10
[57:35] thousands and thousands of s thousands
[57:38] amen saying with a loud voice Worthy is
[57:41] the Lamb that was slain to receive power
[57:43] and riches and wisdom and strength honor
[57:45] and glory and blessing and every
[57:48] creature which is in heaven and on Earth
[57:50] and under the Earth and which such as
[57:51] are in the sea and all that are in them
[57:54] heard I saying blessing and honor and
[57:56] glory and power be unto him that sth
[57:59] upon the throne and unto the lamb
[58:02] forever and ever amen and the four
[58:05] beasts said amen and all the four and 20
[58:08] Elders fell down and worshiped him that
[58:10] liveth forever and ever amen amen we
[58:14] talk about let the sh worshippers arise
[58:16] but here we find the worshippers falling
[58:19] down before him isn't that right amen
[58:22] praise the Lord over in Revelations 19
[58:25] once again if you'll notice in chapter 5
[58:27] it says and I beheld and I heard the
[58:30] voice of many angels round about The
[58:32] Throne so this was had to do with right
[58:35] around the Throne of God amen amen now
[58:41] we know that there is a throne of God
[58:42] and I think I taught this on a few weeks
[58:44] ago how that there were three Thrones
[58:46] that brother Braham talked about it one
[58:48] was in heaven one was in Jesus Christ
[58:51] and his other Throne now where God's
[58:52] Throne is now is in The Believer ain't
[58:55] that right and his people is where God's
[58:57] Throne amen amen that's where he is and
[59:00] so when you think about this you think
[59:03] about amen uh all that is going on even
[59:07] now but here in Revelations 19 and again
[59:10] we want to look at where the throne is
[59:12] amen now in verse 19 and verse four it
[59:15] says and the four and 20 elders and the
[59:17] four beasts fell down and worshiped God
[59:21] that sat on the throne saying amen
[59:23] here's the very same thing isn't it am
[59:26] amen and Hallelujah and a voice came out
[59:28] of the throne saying praise our God all
[59:32] ye his Saints amen so we see a call to
[59:36] worship don't we a call to praising God
[59:41] Amen and ye that fear Him both small and
[59:45] great and I heard as it were the voice
[59:48] of a great multitude and as the voice of
[59:50] many Waters and that's the voice of
[59:52] Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for
[59:55] the Lord our God omnipotent reth let us
[59:57] be glad and rejoice and give honor unto
[1:00:00] him for the marriage of the Lamb is come
[1:00:02] and his wife has made herself ready and
[1:00:05] to her was granted that she should be a
[1:00:07] rated fine linen clean and white for the
[1:00:09] fine linen is the righteousness of the
[1:00:11] Saints may God add His blessings to the
[1:00:13] reading of the words you can be seated
[1:00:15] hopefully you have said long enough to
[1:00:17] where you won't get weary sitting for a
[1:00:19] little while amen praise the Lord I like
[1:00:23] that you know there's it's just amazing
[1:00:25] how many scriptures even though I don't
[1:00:27] perfectly understand it but how that me
[1:00:29] we can go all the way over to
[1:00:31] Revelations 18 I believe it is where
[1:00:33] there was an angel's voice that comes
[1:00:35] forth and he calls for us to come out of
[1:00:37] her ain't that right and brother brandom
[1:00:39] even brings that down to our present
[1:00:41] time amen even as we would look at this
[1:00:43] verse seven amen or verse verse eight
[1:00:46] where it talks about she was it was
[1:00:47] granted her that she should be ar raay
[1:00:49] and fine linen clean and white how many
[1:00:52] believes that amen even even the verse
[1:00:54] before that getting ahead of our eles he
[1:00:56] says let us be glad and rejoice for his
[1:00:58] wife has made herself ready how many
[1:01:00] believe that's
[1:01:01] ongoing am mean I believe that is going
[1:01:04] on
[1:01:05] presently amen oh my so my thought my my
[1:01:10] my objective my thought this evening is
[1:01:12] going to be talking about who he is and
[1:01:15] why the worshippers Praise Him amen why
[1:01:18] because there's always a reason amen
[1:01:21] amen and I truly believe in beginning
[1:01:24] here I believe that uh we're living in
[1:01:26] an hour I believe in this end time hour
[1:01:28] so much has been opened to us so much
[1:01:30] Revelation has been given to us amen and
[1:01:33] one of those Revelations I truly believe
[1:01:35] is that amen that we find out that it's
[1:01:38] all about him amen now a lot of times we
[1:01:40] talk about well it's mine it's you he
[1:01:42] did it all for you and so forth but if
[1:01:44] you really grasp that and if you really
[1:01:46] get a comprehension of how that he did
[1:01:49] that for you the response going to be
[1:01:51] that you realize that it was all him to
[1:01:53] begin with
[1:01:57] brother Braham taught us how that in God
[1:01:59] in the beginning that God had attributes
[1:02:01] isn't that right and in him was an
[1:02:04] attribute to be a
[1:02:05] father so when we talk about what he is
[1:02:08] and that's what we wanted to talk about
[1:02:10] a little bit with our help of the Lord
[1:02:11] is what God is he is amen he uh he's a
[1:02:16] father he's a brother amen he's a friend
[1:02:20] he is Alpha he is Omega he's a deliverer
[1:02:24] isn't that right amen he's a deliverer
[1:02:26] he's a savior he's a
[1:02:28] redeemer and tonight with the help of
[1:02:30] the Lord also I I I want to speak what I
[1:02:32] would have called amen even as brother
[1:02:34] Braham said whenever Paul was saying
[1:02:36] unto the Saints which are at Ephesus he
[1:02:38] was talking to a special class of people
[1:02:40] and tonight I want to talk to a special
[1:02:42] class of people amen and it's going to
[1:02:45] be to those if you're talking about real
[1:02:47] worshippers of God Amen we're talking
[1:02:49] about the people who have
[1:02:52] experienced what God is
[1:02:57] what God
[1:02:58] is amen praise the Lord and what he
[1:03:02] means to you praise the Lord and I like
[1:03:06] that word word let Amen Let the
[1:03:10] worshippers
[1:03:12] arise I thought about that word let
[1:03:19] amen what if you let something happen if
[1:03:22] you let a person do something isin't
[1:03:25] that right right you're opening up a way
[1:03:28] for him you're
[1:03:30] allowing something there's like a open
[1:03:33] door to it let it happen or don't let it
[1:03:37] happen ain't that right so let this be
[1:03:40] done amen so I read I I wrote some
[1:03:44] things down here but I want to read
[1:03:45] Revelations 1 and 22 and it says verse
[1:03:48] 17 and the spirit and the bride say
[1:03:54] come amen when I was writing this down I
[1:03:57] felt like the Holy Spirit quickened to
[1:03:58] me that we're living in this hour and
[1:04:00] we're living in the hour when the spirit
[1:04:03] and the
[1:04:04] bride say come Lord Jesus amen and let
[1:04:10] him that heareth say come and let him
[1:04:15] that is a thirst come and whosoever will
[1:04:19] let him take of the Water of Life
[1:04:24] freely and ain't that
[1:04:27] right now how many knows when you get to
[1:04:30] heaven amen you're going to not need the
[1:04:32] things that you need
[1:04:35] now no so this is a scripture that talks
[1:04:38] about if there's somebody that thirsty
[1:04:41] come on and drink come and take of the
[1:04:44] Water of Life freely let him come the
[1:04:48] bride say come let him come even so I
[1:04:51] don't know about you but how many is
[1:04:52] ready for him to come
[1:04:54] on let him come come and even to call to
[1:04:57] the world let you come if you want to
[1:04:58] come come
[1:05:01] now cuz there'll could be a time folks
[1:05:04] soon that it'll be too late they won't
[1:05:07] be coming anymore it'll be
[1:05:10] done amen but we're living in the hour
[1:05:13] when even the spirit and the bride say
[1:05:16] let him come Amen to the world let him
[1:05:19] come praise be to
[1:05:22] God
[1:05:24] Amen praise the Lord Lord

[1:05:32] said it's to those who have experienced
[1:05:36] what God really
[1:05:39] is amen I'm going to take it slow
[1:05:42] tonight is that okay take it
[1:05:47] slow what brings
[1:05:51] praise if you'll notice here going back
[1:05:53] to our scripture it talks about about
[1:05:55] these thousands upon thousands of people
[1:05:57] both in chapter 5 and also over in
[1:06:01] Revelations 19 amen it talks about all
[1:06:05] these voices and especially five and
[1:06:07] verse 12 they say with a loud
[1:06:12] voice not quiet but a loud
[1:06:16] voice amen so how many knows when we get

[1:08:03] praise him with a loud voice Worthy is
[1:08:07] the Lamb that was
[1:08:09] slain that's the first words comes out
[1:08:11] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain and we
[1:08:13] have a song so that we sing many times

[1:08:37] slain why because you realize where
[1:08:41] would you be if you wouldn't have the
[1:08:43] benefits of that Lamb

[1:08:56] amen but let the Saints amen sing Worthy
[1:09:01] is the Lamb that was slain Amen to

[1:09:14] every dirty trick and everything in the
[1:09:16] book to what receive power because they
[1:09:19] want to be in power but we say Jesus is
[1:09:23] worth of all worthy of all power let him
[1:09:26] have all power let him have all
[1:09:28] authority because he is
[1:09:32] worthy Buddha Muhammad none of them guys
[1:09:35] are worthy only Jesus is Worthy because
[1:09:38] why because he's the one that laid down
[1:09:42] his life for you and
[1:09:44] I so he's worthy nobody else is worthy
[1:09:49] only
[1:09:53] him amen like brother Braham said he
[1:09:56] says that God didn't send somebody else
[1:09:58] down you know no he came down in flesh
[1:10:01] himself made him his own flesh dwell in
[1:10:03] there fullness of the godhead was in him
[1:10:06] and he God died so to speak of course
[1:10:09] the spirit can die but just he made him
[1:10:10] a flesh so he could die and suffer for
[1:10:12] our sins we are saved by the blood of
[1:10:15] God
[1:10:17] Amen Worthy is a lamb to receive power
[1:10:21] and
[1:10:23] riches and wisdom
[1:10:26] and strength and honor and glory and
[1:10:31] blessing in other words he's worthy of
[1:10:36] everything honor let's talk about honor
[1:10:39] for a minute because you know uh the
[1:10:41] Bible talks about you know a son honth
[1:10:43] his father but you've not honored me

[1:11:36] what he's done for
[1:11:39] us
[1:11:40] amen praise be to God all that he is oh
[1:11:44] my do you understand how it would take
[1:11:46] many services just to go over through
[1:11:48] some all of these things that God is but
[1:11:51] we're just going to touch a few of them
[1:11:53] is that okay

[1:11:58] Lord amen because we love
[1:12:00] him it's about

[1:12:15] God experience him as a
[1:12:21] savior amen let me read you a quote
[1:12:25] brother bam says it this way I'm going
[1:12:27] to read the second quote first I'm going
[1:12:28] to have a couple quotes on where brother
[1:12:30] baham talked about the angels and how
[1:12:32] that they can't sing the songs that you
[1:12:34] do they can't worship him the way that
[1:12:36] you and I do now notice he says now this
[1:12:40] is the this is Bible times he says since
[1:12:43] the holy spirit's come is constantly
[1:12:45] Bible times let me jump on down here he
[1:12:47] says but someday when life is all over
[1:12:51] this uh the story will be told up yonder
[1:12:54] in glory when the song of redemption is
[1:12:59] sung amen oh I can almost see the time
[1:13:03] when Jesus comes to Earth and the
[1:13:05] redeemed stands in his presence with
[1:13:08] uplifted
[1:13:10] hands amen how do you like the way
[1:13:12] brother kid says you know we ain't got
[1:13:14] to wait till get over there to raise our
[1:13:16] hands in his presence uplifted hands it
[1:13:19] happens over here it's going to be right
[1:13:22] at home when we get over there when we
[1:13:24] stand in his presence lift our hands
[1:13:26] brother baham says that same story
[1:13:29] Redeemed by Grace when the angels will
[1:13:33] stand a circle around the earth with
[1:13:36] bowed heads not knowing what we're
[1:13:38] talking
[1:13:40] about
[1:13:42] my they never needed to be redeemed it's
[1:13:45] you and I that needed redeeming it was
[1:13:48] you and I that Christ died for that's
[1:13:50] the reason we can sing Redeeming Grace
[1:13:55] amen I've got a few of those songs ready
[1:13:57] we sing
[1:13:59] redeemed
[1:14:00] redeemed Redeemed by the blood of the

[1:14:22] Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb how
[1:14:24] many beli we stand redeemed one thing I
[1:14:27] want to say before I don't and that is
[1:14:28] we should be so thankful for the
[1:14:31] position that God has put us in for the
[1:14:34] place that he has put us
[1:14:37] amen what a wonderful place that we are
[1:14:40] at where we're at in Christ tonight
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:46] my all right now notice here so he says

[1:14:51] angel knows nothing about it oh my my he

[1:14:58] our shoulders straighten up the wrinkles
[1:15:01] come out of our body amen old gray hairs

[1:15:05] vanished oh my look at what he done for
[1:15:10] me that's a good question isn't it what
[1:15:14] has Christ done for
[1:15:17] you remember the woman that was forgiven
[1:15:19] of all of her sins
[1:15:21] s Harlot washed his feet and so forth

[1:15:29] Simon if I'm not wrong he says who's
[1:15:31] going to love him the most and Jim say
[1:15:33] the one that he forgave the most so if
[1:15:36] you were stooped in sin and so forth and

[1:15:40] that much more reason to praise God even
[1:15:43] more amen I want to say something the
[1:15:45] Angels don't know what it's like to be
[1:15:47] in a deep dark tunnel of life amen and

[1:16:58] power he begun a good work he is going
[1:17:01] to finish it and that's why we praise
[1:17:07] Him amen we got lots of reasons to
[1:17:10] praise him we ought to praise him in the
[1:17:13] morning praise him in when we get over
[1:17:15] there it's going to be a noisy
[1:17:18] Place why because we're going to praise
[1:17:20] him before what he has
[1:17:22] done over here we're still held
[1:17:26] back huh how many closer to God today or
[1:17:31] tonight when you came to church and you
[1:17:33] was Sunday night when you

[1:17:38] most of the time you might say well look
[1:17:40] I had all kinds of flat tires and
[1:17:41] everything else and I have a lot of
[1:17:43] trouble and I've just got a little blue
[1:17:45] here I need another boost here from
[1:17:47] church
[1:17:51] huh but aren't you glad that we can get
[1:17:55] closer to God because those things they
[1:17:57] kind of bog you down they keep you know
[1:17:59] because we should always have worship
[1:18:00] God and come into the house of God and
[1:18:02] not go backwards but keep right on
[1:18:04] up
[1:18:06] amen

[1:18:19] 10 11 12 Monday Tuesday Wednesday all
[1:18:23] we're going to do is worship God and
[1:18:24] praise God for all eternity how many
[1:18:27] believe that we're going to praise him
[1:18:29] for all of eternity for what he's done
[1:18:31] for who he is because I want you to
[1:18:33] understand I think the one of the
[1:18:34] revelations is we realize is it's not
[1:18:36] about what you're able to overcome or do
[1:18:38] it's all about what he is able to
[1:18:40] overcome and do through you all you got
[1:18:43] to learn is to surrender to almighty God
[1:18:45] if you can do that God can do just some
[1:18:48] really really wonderful
[1:18:50] things amen sinner has to accept the his
[1:18:54] pardon isn't that right that's
[1:18:57] right so he says listen look at what
[1:19:00] he's done for me talk about Redeeming

[1:19:21] Grace oh how he redeemed Us and how we
[1:19:24] only have the attributes of it now we're
[1:19:27] only got it the down payment so to speak
[1:19:29] the earnest of it but someday it'll be
[1:19:33] full
[1:19:34] payment how many believe that we've got
[1:19:36] the down payment already of the
[1:19:38] Resurrection we've got the down payment
[1:19:40] of Heaven why because we are in Heavenly
[1:19:43] places already in Christ
[1:19:48] Jesus and that's why we praise him
[1:19:51] that's why we worship him let the
[1:19:53] worshippers
[1:19:56] arise let the sons and daughters sing
[1:20:00] amen what does the Bible say they sang

[1:20:28] of lords when angels will stand with
[1:20:31] bowed heads not knowing what we're

[1:27:29] couldn't quit sin you couldn't do it if
[1:27:31] you

[1:27:35] come down to you personally and reveal
[1:27:38] himself to you and set you

[1:27:45] him that's why we rise and worship him

[1:27:50] come
[1:27:53] out amen I'm going to jump over a little
[1:27:55] bit on a different thought for just a
[1:27:57] minute but I'll come back with the help
[1:27:58] of the Lord I wrote down here and you

[1:28:04] experience Our God how many prays for
[1:28:07] your
[1:28:08] children that's right amen we pray for
[1:28:12] our children we believe for our children
[1:28:15] we teach our children from youth we
[1:28:17] teach them everything God's word says
[1:28:19] what the prophet said what the message
[1:28:22] said and I wrote down here you know if
[1:28:24] one of our children end up in hell
[1:28:27] they're going to say boy if he gets down
[1:28:29] there he says he they will be
[1:28:31] panting he says he says they'll say God
[1:28:34] this has been so rough and so hard and
[1:28:37] so miserable trying to get there because
[1:28:40] they had to jump over Mama's Prayer
[1:28:42] Daddy's prayer everything they had been
[1:28:44] taught every barricade that God put
[1:28:48] up and if you die and go to hell and
[1:28:51] you're going to go there miserable
[1:28:55] but we're going to believe that's not
[1:28:56] going to happen ain't that right amen
[1:28:59] young people listen you might as well
[1:29:01] give your heart to God because Mama's
[1:29:02] prayers you're going to have to fight

[1:29:07] fight Mama's Faith amen that God's going
[1:29:10] to do something for you and give you a
[1:29:12] real experience how many our children
[1:29:14] have to have the real experience of
[1:29:17] being set
[1:29:18] free they've got to have their own
[1:29:21] personal experience with God and we as
[1:29:23] parents pray for that more than anything
[1:29:25] else let them get experienced sometimes
[1:29:28] they have to come to a hard
[1:29:30] way we don't want them to go there but
[1:29:33] one way or other we trust God will get
[1:29:35] him
[1:29:37] amen so that they can have the song of
[1:29:40] praise and be a part of those who rise
[1:29:43] and worship God Amen that's right we
[1:29:47] know what the prophet God said he says
[1:29:49] if you go to hell you're going to have
[1:29:51] to fight your way to get there have to
[1:29:53] fight fight your conscience have to
[1:29:56] fight every sensible thing in your
[1:29:59] mind I was thinking you know that the
[1:30:01] world is without
[1:30:04] excuse God shouldn't have to come down
[1:30:06] and discern your thoughts and intents of
[1:30:08] the heart and do all these things to get
[1:30:09] you to believe you ought to be able to
[1:30:11] see the Sun and know the rotation of the
[1:30:12] Sun never f m you should be able to look
[1:30:15] at nature and say God I believe you I'm
[1:30:17] good I have 100% Faith In You Lord there
[1:30:20] ain't nobody can make no ain't nothing
[1:30:22] can make that happen
[1:30:24] that can't happen by chance there's a
[1:30:26] God that's doing that and that has the
[1:30:28] whole of it if you can believe that God
[1:30:31] God will come down on the inside of you
[1:30:32] and transform
[1:30:34] you
