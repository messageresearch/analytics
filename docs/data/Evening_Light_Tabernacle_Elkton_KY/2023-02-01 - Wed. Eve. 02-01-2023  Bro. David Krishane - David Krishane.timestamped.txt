[35:59] foreign
[36:05] silver Satan we're through
[36:08] and you don't just say that once that is
[36:10] not something you say when you're saved
[36:11] at the altar and then
[36:13] just you know dandelions and lollipops
[36:16] from there you say that every single day
[36:17] after every single mistake devil looks
[36:20] over Satan we're through amen
[36:22] so tonight I'd like to tell my testimony
[36:25] and I'll get into the sermon you know
[36:28] testimony is not just one event it's
[36:30] always growing it's always
[36:34] I guess just getting better
[36:37] some from a byc 2022 and other things
[36:40] like that on the stand we'll turn on our
[36:43] Bibles just one verse tonight we'll be
[36:45] turning to Matthew chapter 26 starting
[36:48] with verse 50.
[37:02] I'm gonna make sure I start my timer so
[37:03] I Don't Preach for four hours
[37:08] foreign
[37:10] there
[37:22] amen Matthew 26 and verse 50. and Jesus
[37:26] wherefore art thou come then they laid
[37:28] him hands on Jesus and took him
[37:31] and Lord has
[37:32] blessings the reading of his wordless
[37:34] bow our heads your gracious heavenly
[37:36] father I come to you in the name of the
[37:38] Lord Jesus Christ I thank you for
[37:40] bringing me here safely Lord through all
[37:42] the weather father
[37:43] Lord speak yourself tonight my voice is
[37:45] insufficient but what I do have I give
[37:48] unto you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:49] Christ amen amen God bless you may be
[37:52] seated
[37:56] so as I said I'm Brother David Christine
[37:57] from Sweetwater Tennessee been baptized
[37:59] three times in my life once for the
[38:01] father once for the son once for the
[38:03] Holy Ghost
[38:04] I'm kidding I'm
[38:06] okay
[38:08] that's not actually it but the first
[38:10] time I was seven and I was just
[38:11] convinced into it really I just wanted
[38:13] to swim in the pool second time when I
[38:15] was 12 I don't remember why I did that
[38:16] but the third time
[38:19] when I was 13
[38:23] and um it was the last service or the
[38:25] second the last service and brother
[38:26] Craig was preaching and this touch and I
[38:29] remember coming out of his mouth
[38:31] were the words when you want to be saved
[38:35] or something like that you've got to die
[38:36] out to your own thinking you can't have
[38:38] your own thing anymore you have to die
[38:39] to yourself so that Christ can live in
[38:41] you so then I went to The Altar and said
[38:42] Lord I'm ready to die and then I
[38:44] remember someone came up to me put their
[38:46] hand gently on my back and said when
[38:48] you're asking for the Holy Ghost
[38:50] ghost is not an emotion it's not an
[38:52] intellectual thought all you have to
[38:54] do is ask
[38:56] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[38:58] God will give you what you're asking who
[38:59] saw me and I still remember to this day
[39:02] that
[39:04] April 17 2004
[39:08] when I when that happened and I uh
[39:10] remember when they baptized me and said
[39:12] Jesus commit
[39:13] and fulfill that commandment tonight not
[39:15] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[39:17] Jesus Christ
[39:19] and I remember going into the water and
[39:21] coming out it was like
[39:23] it was like slow motion and from that
[39:26] time I was different you know but I went
[39:28] back and listened to my time there we go
[39:30] yeah listen to the recording of that
[39:32] sermon but those words that I heard
[39:33] about dying out to your own thing
[39:36] I'll never push this birth you have to
[39:38] go through applying First In The Same
[39:41] Spirit you can actually keep your style
[39:42] like he died you've got to die on his
[39:44] altar like Abel did with the light with
[39:45] his lamb you've got to die with your
[39:48] lamb you've got to die I'm thinking to
[39:50] be born to his thinking let the mind
[39:52] that was in Christ be in you
[39:54] so it wasn't for the Craig
[39:57] before it wasn't even on the recording
[39:59] but that was God himself
[40:03] in that one moment for salvation it's
[40:06] none of them recording but that's what I
[40:08] heard
[40:09] and after that I was a different person
[40:10] I went home and I I obeyed mom and dad
[40:12] not because they forced me to but
[40:14] because something in me was changed
[40:15] something in me baptized I believe I got
[40:17] it right when I was baptized because
[40:18] from that time to say David you were
[40:20] different I obeyed mom and dad because
[40:22] really it's not about an operational Act
[40:24] of do the dishes or do this or do that
[40:26] it's really to keep the house going
[40:28] because it needs to be going because
[40:29] when Things fall behind Everyone Falls
[40:31] behind in their spirit and something in
[40:32] me was changed
[40:34] you know and I believe that uh
[40:37] when you're changed you're different but
[40:40] the band said United under one head well
[40:42] you don't have to be that way Christ
[40:44] died that you might be cleansed from all
[40:46] of those things you might be filled with
[40:47] a bunch of Creeds you might be filled
[40:48] with a bunch of denominations but God
[40:50] don't want you to be filled with that
[40:52] God made a place in there to put himself
[40:54] in God wants you to be filled with
[40:56] himself
[40:57] what takes place when you're filled with
[40:59] when you're filled with God you're
[41:00] filled with the Holy Ghost you're filled
[41:02] with power you're filled with love with
[41:04] joy with peace with long suffering with
[41:06] good
[41:07] this David's you're filled with
[41:10] something I was filled with something
[41:11] but I preached the sermon they're
[41:14] in terms of time
[41:17] I believe there comes time to be in sin
[41:18] a time to be called repent be a baptized
[41:21] name with Lord Jesus Christ
[41:24] it's time to be filled with the Holy
[41:25] Ghost
[41:26] and then there Comes A Time for God to
[41:28] call you to what he wants you to be
[41:29] calling
[41:32] sometime after that I was in a about a
[41:35] year after that I was in a discussion
[41:37] with some friends
[41:38] and the subject of what do you believe
[41:40] when the godhead came up and you know I
[41:41] was related to one of these friends I
[41:43] was close friends with the other and
[41:44] they said well David I believe in they
[41:46] said what do you believe I said well I
[41:47] just believe in God and he said well I
[41:49] believe in God the father and his son
[41:51] the Lord Jesus Christ and at this time I
[41:54] didn't know one scripture one quote off
[41:55] the top of my head contradicting a false
[41:57] Doctrine like that but something they
[41:59] said that's not right and they knew more
[42:01] quotes than me they knew more scriptures
[42:02] than me to try to prove this doctrine
[42:04] that they said was so true they said
[42:05] well tell you what take two weeks study
[42:07] it out and then prove to us how we're
[42:08] wrong
[42:09] in those two weeks I started listening
[42:11] God had explained Mighty God and build
[42:13] before us he was a small kitchen the
[42:15] unveiling of God and I just fell in love
[42:17] with this with this message and it just
[42:20] was so true to me just for the random
[42:21] said it and I believe it you guys
[42:23] believe that he just kind of says it and
[42:25] that's just the way that it was and I
[42:26] was like well great he said
[42:30] Jesus was God not some other person I
[42:32] don't really understand that but I
[42:34] believe it and I went back I was so
[42:36] excited I'm going to show them how
[42:37] they're wrong and then we'll all be
[42:39] great and they didn't do that not at all
[42:42] and then they asked me what about this
[42:43] what about that and it's just I didn't
[42:46] know but it sparked a fire in me it
[42:48] activated something in me and it still
[42:50] has been up and put out to this day
[42:54] and as I went through time it'd be
[42:56] came less and less about some Doctrine
[42:59] to argue and they became well I'd like a
[43:01] life
[43:02] because as I started getting closer to
[43:04] God I would pour over these quotes and
[43:08] these scriptures compiling them by God's
[43:09] grace I think I have
[43:11] it's like 400 different notes of
[43:13] hundreds of quotes of just things
[43:15] pertaining to it and I fell in love with
[43:16] it but the slow Church
[43:19] they started separating themselves from
[43:21] others
[43:23] and now they're uh they're both they're
[43:25] divorced and their lives are in shambles
[43:27] and they no longer believe in this
[43:28] message
[43:30] this message is not about so much about
[43:32] a dark Spirit than to be right in my
[43:34] Doctrine and wrong in my spirit doesn't
[43:35] matter how right they are their lives
[43:37] are in shambles now my your life proves
[43:40] that what you're saying is right yes it
[43:42] wasn't it wasn't about some semantic of
[43:44] a father or a son or whatever else it
[43:46] was about not taking what brother
[43:48] Branham said what this message says and
[43:50] apply
[43:51] bring it to your life and saying it's
[43:52] the truth I don't understand it God said
[43:55] so and that's it
[43:57] but there will always come a feeling of
[43:59] power or feeling of intellectual
[44:01] superiority with any false Doctrine
[44:03] where I've I've saw that you know my
[44:05] dad's my pastor and I know I'm only 22
[44:07] years old but something in me sees it
[44:10] what my dad sees and I think the
[44:12] doctrines have less to do with
[44:14] some semantic more with getting
[44:16] something over someone else I'm the man
[44:18] because I believe it this way
[44:20] brother Branham said in exposition of
[44:21] the seven Church ages
[44:23] we are coming to a conclusion as the
[44:25] Eternal logos God was manifest in flesh
[44:27] and then Jesus felt all the fullness of
[44:29] the godhead bodily and that Eternal one
[44:30] was the father manifest in flesh and
[44:33] thereby again the time full of sun even
[44:35] so we Eternal in his thoughts in our
[44:37] turn became the many members spoken word
[44:38] seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal
[44:41] thoughts it's not manifest in flesh are
[44:44] the sons of God even as we are so-called
[44:46] we did not become seed by the rebirth we
[44:49] were seed and therefore
[44:51] can be reborn because we were seated is
[44:54] the reason we could be quick
[44:56] there is nothing to Quicken hold this
[44:58] carefully in mind
[44:59] I'm going to take the next step redeem
[45:01] means to buy back it restores to the
[45:04] original owner God by his death the shed
[45:06] Blood Bought back his own
[45:09] he brought back the spoke
[45:13] word seed bride my sheep hear my voice
[45:15] word and they follow me you always were
[45:17] a sheep are you never a pig or a dog
[45:19] turned into a sheep that is impossible
[45:21] for every kind of Life produced as we
[45:22] were the thoughts of God and then
[45:24] expressed in flesh there had to come a
[45:26] day when we would hear his voice the
[45:27] word there had to come anyone who would
[45:29] hear his voice
[45:31] and recognize that we are the sons of
[45:33] God when I heard that Doctrine something
[45:35] in me said that was wrong I believe
[45:36] there was a revelation in me from before
[45:38] the foundation of the world because I
[45:39] knew no knowledge contradicting the two
[45:43] Lord's Doctrine that's what the doctrine
[45:44] is
[45:46] something in me said it's not right
[45:48] they were my friends of mine I wasn't
[45:50] popular with them but some it activated
[45:52] a fire to me to where I go on Facebook
[45:54] arguing all the time I don't anymore
[45:55] don't worry but I used to but there was
[45:58] a fire in me that couldn't be put out
[46:00] went to Dad when I was
[46:01] that when that happened when I was 14
[46:03] years old I said Dad I've got to preach
[46:07] he was wise so he told me I want you to
[46:10] think about it for a couple weeks and
[46:12] pray about it and then come back to me
[46:14] and of course I didn't
[46:15] and then when I was 16 I told my dad I
[46:18] said dad I don't care if I have to go on
[46:19] a street corner in a nursing home on a
[46:21] Facebook live I've got a fire in me and
[46:23] people are irritated because anytime
[46:25] God's ever mentioned I go on for 25
[46:26] minutes about the things of God I've got
[46:28] to preach he's like okay all right we'll
[46:31] have you coming we'll have you preaching
[46:33] um
[46:33] remember the first sermon was uh when I
[46:36] went to try to type it up Dad said David
[46:38] I don't know what you're talking about
[46:39] so he gave me a title and then he said
[46:41] David have you heard the rule of Kiss I
[46:43] said what's that he said keep it simple
[46:45] stupid I'm like what he said David do
[46:48] you want the
[46:49] complaint to be that just
[46:50] too simple right
[46:52] and then it's too complicated to
[46:54] understand because I was like okay well
[46:56] I'll do my best he said he gave me the
[46:58] title of without faith that was
[47:01] June 14th
[47:04] 2017 I preached the first term sermon of
[47:08] without faith it's impossible to please
[47:10] God and it was 12 minutes and 38 seconds
[47:12] by God's praying there's been over
[47:16] five and a half years preaching by God's
[47:18] grace thank the Lord I'm 22 Doctrine but
[47:20] it wasn't really that it was a life that
[47:22] lives it's true it's
[47:27] for those of you who do not know the uh
[47:29] I had a sister my sister Amy there's a
[47:32] Facebook page present encouragement for
[47:34] Amy crocheting
[47:36] someone like the way that you are
[47:40] part of that was that uh
[47:42] I did my sister
[47:45] she went in and out of Mental Health
[47:48] hospitals
[47:49] for a little over 10 years
[47:52] and I had to uh
[47:53] that was
[47:55] probably the most consistent one of the
[47:57] hardest trials in my life
[47:59] and there was one point where I went
[48:01] five days without sleep because I was
[48:03] saying it was just going on me but God
[48:05] kept me through it but by God's grace
[48:07] Amy
[48:09] married and uh and a year and a half
[48:13] with no hospitals to praise the Lord for
[48:14] that amen
[48:16] because and you know we could think oh
[48:18] well you know we raised we laid hands on
[48:20] her
[48:21] the first time into it and nothing
[48:23] changed but over 10 years later she
[48:26] recovered you would lay hands on the
[48:27] sick and they shall recover so no matter
[48:30] what it looks like or what changes or
[48:32] what doesn't God will bring to pass his
[48:34] word
[48:37] I believe that one of the most important
[48:38] things that happens to us in order for
[48:40] us to learn is for us to fail and fall
[48:43] I know about you but I make a lot of
[48:45] I've made a lot of real
[48:47] dumb
[48:49] I believe there's no value unless
[48:51] they're suffering unless you've done
[48:52] something wrong you know I uh
[48:55] it seems odd to tell someone about this
[48:58] story but I believe it is good a good
[49:00] thing I once had a real nice 2008
[49:03] Chevrolet Impala it was black real nice
[49:06] and you know why my dad would tell me
[49:08] David I want you to drive safer I want
[49:09] you to drive slow or don't go on this
[49:11] curve so fast
[49:13] get more sleep before you uh before you
[49:15] drive in the morning the next day
[49:17] and one morning I was a Wednesday night
[49:19] and I preached in this
[49:20] day up too late that
[49:22] so David go to bed and I didn't and um
[49:26] I ran a red light and I got T-boned
[49:29] it totaled the car by God's grace there
[49:32] wasn't hardly even a scratch on me it's
[49:33] a little scratch in my arm that was it
[49:37] and that seems like a
[49:40] it was a disappointing thing but what
[49:42] did it do
[49:43] God said okay I'll let you break your
[49:47] favorite
[49:49] car because God said enough I'm enough
[49:52] with David not driving safe
[49:57] and then it became complacent after that
[49:59] and there was another time when I was
[50:00] going around a corner in my new 2007
[50:02] Cadillac CTS that I that I had and I uh
[50:06] two earbuds in and I was listening to
[50:08] something I shouldn't have been
[50:09] listening to went around a corner that
[50:11] went to the left and curved and it'll
[50:13] slant and it never went on that before
[50:15] and it was wet
[50:17] fish tailed this way fish tailed that
[50:19] way went into a forest and got stuck
[50:22] I had to replace three four doors the
[50:25] trunk the windows that were just tinted
[50:28] the glass broke in but it was it was
[50:30] like being in a roller coaster because
[50:33] all of a sudden you say David you're
[50:35] done driving stupid you're drunk driving
[50:37] fast I'm gonna put you in a position
[50:39] where now you will never forget that
[50:42] again and I never have so anyway
[50:43] everyone just why does David drive slow
[50:45] that's why
[50:47] yeah
[50:48] that's why
[50:55] I do my best to uh
[50:57] take these things that God puts us
[50:59] through
[51:00] and turn it into a stepping stone
[51:09] you know at a byc in 2012
[51:14] to after one of the sermons preached by
[51:16] Brother Andrew Glover he said sent by a
[51:17] burden received by a blessing I felt so
[51:19] free and so happy you go to the escamson
[51:21] you're not exposed to the things of the
[51:23] world 24 7. it's just such a blessing
[51:26] and after we went back to one of our
[51:28] dorms they had all the guys in my dorm
[51:29] go out to a campfire and talk with the
[51:31] other guys and it's a really neat thing
[51:33] because where I'm from we don't have any
[51:34] youth to get anywhere with anyone my age
[51:37] I've got to drive about three hours to
[51:39] get within anybody in the message of my
[51:41] age and uh it was a really neat thing
[51:43] but I felt something in my heart that I
[51:45] wasn't dedicated to God enough I wasn't
[51:47] spending enough time with God and
[51:50] I uh I asked my my counselor you know I
[51:54] heard of brother Trevor eamond
[51:57] great guy
[51:58] I said Trevor I don't feel like I'm uh
[52:00] dead
[52:02] doing things would you feel dedicated
[52:04] like what do you mean but if Trevor
[52:06] doesn't just answer the question you
[52:07] want he'll ask you a question he said
[52:09] well you think you've spent four hours a
[52:11] day
[52:12] he asked me how much time per day you
[52:13] spend listening to a tape or studying I
[52:15] told him he said well what if you
[52:16] tripled that then would you feel better
[52:18] what if you spend five hours a day
[52:20] listening to a tape would you feel
[52:21] better then and I said no he said David
[52:25] do you love the Lord I said well yes he
[52:27] said you think I love me yeah of course
[52:29] they said do you think I have a
[52:31] checklist every day that I go by hug her
[52:34] tell her I love her
[52:36] watch the dishes or whatever else
[52:38] tonight no he's like well why I said
[52:41] because you love her you have a
[52:42] relationship with her he said exactly
[52:43] and you have a relationship with the
[52:44] Lord Jesus Christ it's not about these
[52:46] acts of operational acts of love it's
[52:48] about a relationship
[52:51] a revelation right there that he wants
[52:54] to turn the message and the the things
[52:56] of the word of God into an operational
[52:58] religion well I'll get up and then I'll
[53:01] pray and then I'll do this and then I'll
[53:02] do all these other things of the world
[53:03] but I hate I prayed once and I read my
[53:05] Bible for five minutes so I'm good
[53:07] for the day
[53:11] just into a operational thing just
[53:13] search two times a week you're fine
[53:16] I especially I've struggled with that in
[53:18] my life
[53:20] I'm the pastor's kid we're raised in the
[53:22] message
[53:27] my dad doesn't have the checklist either
[53:29] he loves my mom and he does the things
[53:30] because he loves her he lives his life
[53:33] in the way that he does because he has a
[53:34] relationship with her
[53:35] and the message is not just about oh if
[53:37] I can listen to tapes for six hours a
[53:39] day if they're gonna read 20 chapters of
[53:40] my Bible every single day then I'll get
[53:42] it it doesn't mean anything if a God
[53:44] isn't in your soul
[53:47] not at all go back to a relationship
[53:49] with the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:52] I've had the wrong frame of mind in my
[53:55] life and it comes from the devil will
[53:56] make you make a mistake well you just
[53:58] gotta repent on you
[54:01] be fine
[54:03] and then just spend the rest of your
[54:04] time thinking about the negative things
[54:07] Lord I need you to help me have a
[54:09] positive attitude Lord we have this
[54:11] financial thing Lord I have this thank
[54:13] you Lord for this this thing that I'm
[54:15] asking for Lord please help me you
[54:16] Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus
[54:18] Christ amen and then the rest of your
[54:20] time is filled thinking about how it
[54:22] won't happen how it it
[54:24] happens how it cannot be done that's
[54:27] what Satan wants that's why it said pray
[54:29] without ceasing don't stop in your
[54:31] prayer if I pray that God would give me
[54:33] a Camaro and I start thinking no I can't
[54:36] have it I can't have it I can't have it
[54:38] what's gonna happen
[54:40] I'm not gonna have it but how how much
[54:43] more with the things that really matter
[54:44] Lord help me to feel better Lord help my
[54:46] family Lord with this Lord help me to
[54:49] spend more time with you
[54:50] and then when you get done with the
[54:52] prayer you spend the rest of your time
[54:54] doubting if it'll ever happen
[54:57] that's your flesh we can't save our
[55:00] flesh that's why he said pray without
[55:01] ceasing
[55:08] we need to take God out of an
[55:10] operational part of our life and make it
[55:12] into
[55:13] a relationship
[55:17] I have a relationship with Danny he
[55:19] helps me stuff at the gym I help him
[55:21] stuff with the job that's just the way
[55:23] we do
[55:24] not because we're
[55:26] okay checklist oh I gotta make sure
[55:28] Danny's my friend because I gotta do
[55:29] this check no we're friends that's just
[55:31] how we do it
[55:33] brother Trevor told me David stop
[55:35] religion Inc I'm like what
[55:37] stop religioning it's not about this
[55:39] operational act that's good if you
[55:41] listen to tapes for three hours a day
[55:42] sure but I would rather listen for five
[55:44] minutes of a tape with God and I know
[55:46] this dedicated to God and to say oh well
[55:48] I listened to three hours of a tape
[55:50] every single day and I'm better than
[55:51] everyone else it's not about that it's
[55:54] about a relationship with the Lord Jesus
[55:55] Christ he said I encourage you I said
[55:57] well what about when I'm really really
[55:58] busy he said David I would encourage you
[56:00] to talk to God throughout your day you
[56:02] always have your mind and your inner
[56:03] monologue the Bible says pray without
[56:05] ceasing these positive things keep them
[56:06] in your mind without ceasing
[56:08] my dad preached Sunday on seeking
[56:11] occasion
[56:13] Satan wants us to seek occasion to doubt
[56:15] if you seek Caucasian to doubt Satan
[56:17] will always give it to you oh the
[56:20] world's ending oh there's a recession oh
[56:22] I'm running out of money oh there's this
[56:24] and oh there's that Satan will always
[56:25] fit it to you because very similar to
[56:27] the power of God is close the power of
[56:30] the devil because he transforms himself
[56:31] into an angel of Light a Satan will
[56:33] always make you feel just amazing to do
[56:36] anything except the thoughts of God
[56:41] foreign
[56:44] but if we can take the things of God and
[56:46] apply them in a positive manner and just
[56:48] repeat the things of God that'd be a lot
[56:49] better than
[56:51] going into our own understanding but
[56:53] when you say that when you
[56:55] seek occasion also
[56:57] to edify others or to read your Bible or
[57:00] say you know what no matter what I go
[57:02] through no matter how many times my
[57:04] sister tries to hurt herself no matter
[57:05] how many times she ends up in that
[57:07] mental health hospital no matter how
[57:08] many times God will heal her and he did
[57:11] because the only one that could be 10
[57:13] years late is to be 45 minutes early
[57:15] that's God
[57:17] Time After Time After Time Amy would go
[57:19] in
[57:20] two years into it and she three months
[57:22] no hospital business praise the Lord and
[57:24] then go right back into it again
[57:27] God kept her and not her God kept her
[57:30] through it
[57:31] it's not me keeping myself in the most
[57:33] message it's God
[57:40] I might need more water here in a little
[57:42] bit
[57:46] you know I always love when Satan
[57:47] attacks me makes me feel bad when I'm
[57:49] preaching because I know that he doesn't
[57:50] attack you unless there's something
[57:52] valuable there
[57:54] if you feel negative thoughts against
[57:56] you of any kind
[57:58] I don't care if about how you look
[58:01] your status what you make what you don't
[58:03] make
[58:04] anything if it's negative it's from the
[58:06] devil how do you know brother Thomas how
[58:08] do you know when the devil's lying
[58:10] when he talks when he talks
[58:13] every scripture he says every quote he
[58:15] says everything he ever says doesn't
[58:16] matter how right it seems It's always
[58:18] out of place it's always under context
[58:20] and it's always a lie every single time
[58:22] because even though my sister would be
[58:24] in the mental health hospital and we'd
[58:26] go there and say no you can't bring your
[58:27] phone but I said can I bring a Bible
[58:30] sure I guess no one's ever asked us that
[58:32] but yeah you can bring it and then even
[58:33] though it's screaming in the background
[58:34] of everyone else in the hospital they
[58:36] don't tell you that when you go into a
[58:37] mental health hospital and your sister's
[58:38] there they may shut the door where the
[58:40] rest of the people are but there's a lot
[58:41] of screaming and wailing and
[58:43] it sounds terrible but when I started
[58:45] reading that Bible quiet
[58:49] we went through it Time After Time
[58:51] remember one time Dad called me and it
[58:53] had been like nothing like eight months
[58:55] before Amy went to uh she'd go for four
[58:57] or five days without sleeping and we
[59:00] just try to help her stay safe and she'd
[59:03] been about I think like six to eight
[59:04] months no hospital visits and uh dad
[59:06] gave me a call when I was coming home
[59:08] from working I was about 18 and he told
[59:09] me David
[59:10] Amy left a house again we don't know
[59:12] where she is we're out looking for when
[59:14] you get home you got Ruth
[59:16] my younger sister and Thomas my younger
[59:18] brother when you get there I need you to
[59:19] stay positive
[59:21] and I need you to uh be an example for
[59:23] them because if you don't have the
[59:25] example
[59:26] of a strong mind they won't follow
[59:29] either
[59:30] and then I hung up and then I just
[59:31] started bawling it was hard on me but I
[59:34] said Lord I need you to help me I said
[59:36] no matter what happens
[59:38] whether Amy is in thank you back
[59:41] whether Amy's in in a church in a
[59:44] hospital or wherever she is she's still
[59:45] in the hands of God
[59:48] no matter where it is you know God
[59:50] doesn't love you anymore now and the
[59:52] message they did when you were in the
[59:54] world
[59:54] it's the same amount of love
[59:57] but God said Amy would be all right
[1:00:01] God said he was wounded for our
[1:00:03] transcriptions with his stripes Amy was
[1:00:05] healed
[1:00:07] ten years later she named a kid after me
[1:00:09] praise the Lord his name is Caleb David
[1:00:11] and it's a testimony doesn't matter what
[1:00:13] you go through no matter what happens
[1:00:16] God is alive and God will bring you
[1:00:18] through it why because all this has
[1:00:20] happened with Amy brought me and Amy and
[1:00:22] my whole family back to a relationship
[1:00:24] with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:27] in our text Jesus says friend to Judas
[1:00:31] that was Judas the one that he was
[1:00:32] talking to
[1:00:34] everybody knows which is what Judas is
[1:00:35] going to do he's gonna
[1:00:37] betray is the largest betrayal of all
[1:00:39] time
[1:00:40] betraying God himself to his face and
[1:00:42] Jesus looks at that man Judas
[1:00:45] possessed by the devil and says friend
[1:00:51] so when saying it's actually in your
[1:00:52] mind it's a mistake that you've made or
[1:00:54] some terrible thing you've done
[1:00:55] should remind yourself that Jesus looks
[1:00:57] into the eyes of Judas and says friend
[1:00:59] wherefore art thou come
[1:01:01] my friend what are you doing here he
[1:01:03] knew what he was doing there and this is
[1:01:05] just my belief I believe that that was
[1:01:06] judas's last chance to turn back
[1:01:09] I think it was his last chance but he
[1:01:11] didn't
[1:01:13] why did why did Jesus do that he's going
[1:01:17] to condemn him to the most
[1:01:21] of the most why because he wanted a
[1:01:22] relationship he doesn't want to condemn
[1:01:25] people God's not willing that he should
[1:01:26] perish he wants a relationship he wants
[1:01:28] you to know that he'll keep you safe and
[1:01:30] keep you in his love and grace no matter
[1:01:31] what
[1:01:35] remember Cain after committing the first
[1:01:37] murder
[1:01:42] God tells him what he's done and he says
[1:01:43] I'll punish you and
[1:01:46] I'll cast you out
[1:01:50] and Kane says my punishment's greater
[1:01:52] than I can bear too bad you did the
[1:01:54] first murder
[1:01:55] no we didn't
[1:01:57] God said I'll put a mark on you so that
[1:01:59] anyone that attacks you Sevenfold would
[1:02:01] be turned unto him and there were the
[1:02:03] saddest scriptures in the whole Bible
[1:02:04] and Cain went out from the presence of
[1:02:06] the Lord
[1:02:08] what if came when it said Lord please I
[1:02:11] don't know why but something in my
[1:02:12] nature something in me just wants to
[1:02:14] kill would you please help me
[1:02:18] but he wouldn't
[1:02:20] Scott wanted a relationship
[1:02:24] remember what Saul did
[1:02:27] King Saul
[1:02:28] pulled away at this encampment until I
[1:02:31] get there by Samuel the prophet Samuel
[1:02:34] and don't make a sacrifice until I get
[1:02:36] there the seventh day I'll be there the
[1:02:38] Bible says that there was
[1:02:40] I once said the mathematical
[1:02:42] uh I added up all the soldiers that were
[1:02:45] there as far as what the Bible says and
[1:02:47] I looked up what it would mean and
[1:02:48] approximately if I'm
[1:02:51] positions are right they were they were
[1:02:53] outnumbered I believe it was 300 333 to
[1:02:57] one that means for every one soldier
[1:02:59] they had there were over three thousand
[1:03:00] of the enemy surrounded the people were
[1:03:03] traveling Oh what do we do what do we do
[1:03:04] everything in the natural was tumbling
[1:03:06] down and Saul said I have to offer the
[1:03:08] sacrifice and as soon as he did
[1:03:11] Samuel shows up
[1:03:14] and then Saul knows
[1:03:16] say this wrong he says oh my the servant
[1:03:18] of God hello how are you but Samuel you
[1:03:21] offered the sacrifice you weren't
[1:03:22] supposed to well I had to do something
[1:03:24] you weren't here when you said you're
[1:03:25] going to be here he said I don't care
[1:03:27] is God not in control is God not here
[1:03:31] I believe that God knew what was going
[1:03:32] to happen he knew that that the
[1:03:34] Philistines were going to surround him
[1:03:35] and be outnumbered but God wanted a
[1:03:37] relationship with Saul God wanted
[1:03:38] someone to realize no no matter what
[1:03:40] you're surrounded with this isn't just
[1:03:42] about Soul this is about all of us no
[1:03:43] matter how many demons you're surrounded
[1:03:45] by no matter what your situation is no
[1:03:47] matter if the sword was half an inch
[1:03:49] from slicing Saul in half God would have
[1:03:51] stabbed his fingers and all of them
[1:03:53] would have disappeared
[1:03:54] because God brings his work to pass no
[1:03:57] matter what
[1:04:00] thank you
[1:04:01] but Satan
[1:04:03] or but Saul
[1:04:06] got to when my dad calls stinking
[1:04:08] thinking
[1:04:11] thinking of it in your own way
[1:04:13] well we're surrounded we're outnumbered
[1:04:15] excuses excuses the people are afraid
[1:04:17] you're the king
[1:04:23] but Satan got Saul to be thinking about
[1:04:26] turning God into a religion well God's a
[1:04:28] good thing to make me the king and yeah
[1:04:29] we offer the sacrifice and all that but
[1:04:31] really our strength is in our army our
[1:04:33] strength
[1:04:35] to keep ourselves in power
[1:04:37] but God wanted a personal relationship
[1:04:39] with Saul
[1:04:41] God wanted
[1:04:42] so much with him to where God would
[1:04:44] intervene in battles when Joshua said
[1:04:47] Son
[1:04:48] stand still and also Moon stay over
[1:04:52] there and then he kept fighting he
[1:04:54] didn't wait for an emotion he didn't
[1:04:56] wait for God to speak back to him he
[1:04:58] didn't check Google to see if it made
[1:04:59] sense he said Son stand still Moon's
[1:05:01] they were there and kept God himself
[1:05:08] God wanted Saul to ignore the proof and
[1:05:11] the evidence against him and the only
[1:05:13] thing that sold Focus he wanted the only
[1:05:15] thing
[1:05:16] soul to focus on is I have a
[1:05:18] relationship with God said you keep me
[1:05:20] safe God said this lamb was mine and I
[1:05:22] don't care if we're going to be fine
[1:05:23] same you'll have to wait for him that's
[1:05:25] what we're going to do no matter what
[1:05:28] look at Noah
[1:05:30] you know I had a thought a 120 year
[1:05:32] mindset
[1:05:35] what does that mean Noah preached 120
[1:05:37] years from no evidence in fact all the
[1:05:40] scientifical evidence was against him
[1:05:43] typically prove there's no rain in the
[1:05:44] sky and it's not going to happen not at
[1:05:46] all we can shoot the moon with our radar
[1:05:49] and bring it down that's what they were
[1:05:51] thinking you know what though what's
[1:05:53] really neat is the people of the world
[1:05:55] at the time intellectually they were
[1:05:57] right
[1:05:58] through originally they were right but
[1:05:59] here's the thing reasoning doesn't have
[1:06:01] to add up with God no it didn't have
[1:06:03] some big Bible and a bunch of tapes to
[1:06:05] listen to We had three words or four
[1:06:07] words it's going to rain and that was it
[1:06:11] it's all he needed because God says so
[1:06:14] what about science God said so what
[1:06:16] about this philosopher this psychology
[1:06:19] or the speaker God said so and
[1:06:22] that's all that he needed and why did he
[1:06:24] preach the same thing with the same
[1:06:25] intention thing in day one as he did 120
[1:06:28] years later because he didn't know in
[1:06:29] the Rapture I mean the flood was going
[1:06:30] to happen it's the same as I believe
[1:06:32] that's the type of today we don't know
[1:06:33] when the Rapture is going to happen but
[1:06:34] we still preach come to the truth please
[1:06:38] with the same intensity
[1:06:41] because there Comes A Time there came a
[1:06:43] time when it was too late the sun
[1:06:45] running it was too late please don't
[1:06:47] wait till it's too late run back to a
[1:06:50] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:54] foreign
[1:07:04] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:06] and trusted in God no matter what
[1:07:10] no matter what he saw no matter what he
[1:07:11] felt matter against popularity you know
[1:07:13] I bet there was some people that went to
[1:07:15] his church they enjoyed his uh
[1:07:18] spirit and his passion for 20 years
[1:07:20] maybe even 100 years but
[1:07:23] they didn't stay right with it
[1:07:25] well there's no proof all of the
[1:07:27] evidence of the world is against it
[1:07:29] so they left
[1:07:31] science contradicted what God said
[1:07:33] everything country and they could prove
[1:07:35] it by science but here's the thing
[1:07:37] God existed before science God existed
[1:07:40] before for technology God existed before
[1:07:43] reasoning the very one that it that that
[1:07:46] created your ability to fake is the one
[1:07:49] in control
[1:07:50] I once worked with a guy that said
[1:07:54] that he
[1:07:56] terrible two
[1:07:57] minutes
[1:07:58] did well
[1:08:01] um is that really the I said I had a
[1:08:03] quarter and I said uh
[1:08:05] could I could I could God make this if I
[1:08:07] drop this quarter is it going to fall on
[1:08:08] the ground every single time he's like
[1:08:10] yeah and I said could God make this
[1:08:12] quarter float in the air
[1:08:14] if I dropped it he's like well yeah I
[1:08:16] said well what do you mean well what
[1:08:18] about the Virgin birth he said okay it
[1:08:20] goes against the laws of nature
[1:08:22] prefer a virgin birth I said oh wait
[1:08:24] though you just told me that God could
[1:08:26] make a quarter floor and float in the
[1:08:28] air
[1:08:29] so if God command The Rules of Nature
[1:08:32] he can do anything right
[1:08:34] he didn't want to talk to me about
[1:08:36] religion from that time on
[1:08:37] you know I don't believe that people
[1:08:39] will bleed
[1:08:40] believe something that's wrong because
[1:08:42] they've reasoned it out in their minds
[1:08:44] but because they want to sit they they
[1:08:46] want us to mess around with people they
[1:08:49] want to smoke and drink and do drugs and
[1:08:52] and
[1:08:53] fornication and everything else they
[1:08:56] and they don't reason against God
[1:08:57] because they've figured out in their
[1:08:59] minds they're just defending what's
[1:09:00] wrong
[1:09:02] foreign
[1:09:14] that was it it's gonna rain oh but this
[1:09:17] oh but that it's gonna wreck
[1:09:20] imagine I hope my brother said oh well
[1:09:22] he was trying to convince he said these
[1:09:23] people of the message
[1:09:25] I said okay he said I'm trying to find
[1:09:26] the old document of George Lacy with uh
[1:09:29] FB
[1:09:30] I proving
[1:09:32] the uh the picture and I said well what
[1:09:34] if they say it's a fake he said what do
[1:09:36] you mean I said if someone doesn't want
[1:09:38] to believe something they're not going
[1:09:39] to believe it no matter what you say he
[1:09:41] said well I I just can't convince them I
[1:09:43] said well even if you did would do
[1:09:44] nothing he's like what he said if I can
[1:09:47] convince you into it you can get
[1:09:48] convinced out of it I said you show them
[1:09:49] the tapes you tell them you don't want
[1:09:51] to argue and if it doesn't activate a
[1:09:53] seed in them then that's that's all that
[1:09:55] you can do because we're not supposed to
[1:09:57] argue this message that was more
[1:10:01] and all of us put together
[1:10:04] all right but it's like well I feel like
[1:10:07] I'm not good enough to to tell people
[1:10:09] about Christ and tell people about the
[1:10:10] message I said well God himself was on
[1:10:12] earth and the smartest people in the
[1:10:14] world when it came to religion killed
[1:10:16] him
[1:10:18] so yes we should study and yes we should
[1:10:19] know what to say but if people still
[1:10:21] reject what you're saying even if you
[1:10:22] say over and over and over again
[1:10:25] just you're identified with the Lord
[1:10:26] Jesus Christ
[1:10:30] I believe that another way that God
[1:10:32] develops his relationship with us is by
[1:10:34] allowing us to fall
[1:10:37] because if you
[1:10:39] can't if you don't
[1:10:40] fall there's no value
[1:10:48] if I didn't mean for that to happen but
[1:10:49] if that cap didn't fall there'd be no
[1:10:51] value in me picking it back up and
[1:10:53] putting it back on the lid
[1:10:55] I once heard a speaker say if you're not
[1:10:57] failing you're not even trying
[1:11:00] ten thousand failed experiments before
[1:11:02] the light bulb
[1:11:06] I believe that making mistakes has
[1:11:07] sometimes will have less to do with the
[1:11:09] actual mistake but more with what you do
[1:11:10] afterwards how do you treat your mistake
[1:11:12] what will you do with them
[1:11:14] Saul offered the sacrifice when he
[1:11:16] wasn't supposed to and he didn't exactly
[1:11:18] repent you think God really cared that
[1:11:20] much about when he offered the sacrifice
[1:11:22] when he didn't or this operational thing
[1:11:23] what God really cared about is will you
[1:11:25] do what I say no matter what the
[1:11:27] circumstances are well you just follow
[1:11:29] what I say
[1:11:31] also God wanted to know when you really
[1:11:33] messed up Saul what are you going to do
[1:11:35] how are you going to approach it when
[1:11:36] Samuel comes back and cell realizes is
[1:11:38] wrong he's like oh would you please
[1:11:39] worship with me oh I'm sorry I was wrong
[1:11:41] but could you please worship with me so
[1:11:42] that can be restored and he's trying to
[1:11:44] reason his way out of it
[1:11:46] and then when he was supposed to kill
[1:11:47] the amalekites God give me another
[1:11:48] chance I want you to kill the amalekites
[1:11:50] kill the king kill the women kill the
[1:11:52] children kill the cattle kill all of
[1:11:54] them and then the people says oh we can
[1:11:56] use these things for sacrifice if we can
[1:11:58] use this for that it's like oh this
[1:11:59] makes sense stinking thinking again and
[1:12:02] then
[1:12:03] Samuel shows up and says
[1:12:06] hello Saul is like oh hello the servant
[1:12:08] of the lord it's like you're not a bit
[1:12:10] of the Commandment of the Lord thy God
[1:12:12] oh yeah I have obeyed the voice of the
[1:12:13] Commandment of the Lord but the people
[1:12:15] said we should spare The Oxen we can
[1:12:17] sacrifice them but obedience is better
[1:12:18] than sacrifice Saul he still doesn't get
[1:12:20] and he still tried to reason it out
[1:12:24] it's not about some big speech to prove
[1:12:26] that oh God I'm so sorry but please
[1:12:28] restore me it wasn't about that
[1:12:35] Saul didn't have the right kind of a
[1:12:36] relationship with God
[1:12:38] God had become a religion an operational
[1:12:40] act to Saul
[1:12:42] I'm still thinking
[1:12:43] thankful that God still restored Saul
[1:12:46] and Saul will be in heaven amen he
[1:12:48] appeared that day with us in Paradise is
[1:12:49] what Samuel told him
[1:12:51] but I once pushed a sermon what were
[1:12:53] your testimony be in heaven Saul is glad
[1:12:56] he's in heaven but
[1:12:58] does he regret doing that
[1:13:02] God wanted a relationship with Saul God
[1:13:03] wanted to just do what he asked kill a
[1:13:06] gag all of his people all of the but it
[1:13:08] doesn't make sense it's not supposed to
[1:13:10] make sense actually it's supposed to not
[1:13:13] make sense because it's God God's not
[1:13:15] supposed to make sense to us in order
[1:13:16] for us to do what he says
[1:13:18] it doesn't make sense that
[1:13:20] the the major prophet of the age of the
[1:13:23] seventh grade education guy but that's
[1:13:24] just the way God
[1:13:26] does it it didn't make sense
[1:13:28] for God to come down in just a uh forgot
[1:13:31] to come down in a stable he was supposed
[1:13:33] to come in
[1:13:41] it's better
[1:13:43] relation ship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:45] you know David made a mistake with
[1:13:47] Bathsheba King David had in Psalms
[1:13:49] because my name is David brother bam
[1:13:50] said that your your name is an impact
[1:13:51] and a character
[1:13:53] I would say that how many agree with
[1:13:55] what David did was a whole lot worse
[1:13:57] than what Saul did
[1:13:58] with Bathsheba David
[1:14:01] David the Bible says at the time when
[1:14:05] kings go forth to battle
[1:14:07] David stayed sees Bathsheba
[1:14:10] and then
[1:14:12] she gets pregnant and then he tries to
[1:14:14] Uriah
[1:14:15] to go with her maybe Uriah doesn't have
[1:14:17] loyalty to David David plans for and
[1:14:19] then he has Uriah killed
[1:14:22] you know that's him that's really bad
[1:14:24] thinker buried to offering sacrifice at
[1:14:26] the wrong time but then
[1:14:28] what was the difference though
[1:14:31] why why did God treat David differently
[1:14:33] than he did with Saul
[1:14:36] foreign
[1:14:41] and David said unto Nathan after Nathan
[1:14:43] shows David you were wrong this is what
[1:14:45] you did you did this your call
[1:14:48] what what does David say I know I've
[1:14:50] seen against a little bit could you
[1:14:51] please help me I'm so sorry could be
[1:14:53] reason to sound really
[1:14:55] yeah
[1:14:56] sinned against the Lord
[1:14:58] no explanation no transcend to David the
[1:15:00] Lord also has put away that sin Thou
[1:15:03] shalt not die what was it it was David's
[1:15:05] attitude I didn't want to say you're
[1:15:08] wrong you're lost forever I'm just going
[1:15:09] to kill you and that's done mistake that
[1:15:11] David made
[1:15:13] and restore David back to a relationship
[1:15:16] with him
[1:15:17] and he was able to do it because David
[1:15:18] said I've sinned against the Lord what
[1:15:20] do you think would happen if Saul would
[1:15:21] have said I have sinned against the Lord
[1:15:23] and that's all that he said
[1:15:26] a lot of times
[1:15:27] this is not about all
[1:15:29] all the
[1:15:30] things that we can say but rather than
[1:15:33] I was wrong I'm sorry
[1:15:37] David's identity was not anybody had
[1:15:39] done wrong but what God's
[1:15:42] said
[1:15:43] he
[1:15:44] was you're
[1:15:47] not in our mistakes it's not in our
[1:15:49] flesh it's what God said we are
[1:15:51] it's what the message says that we are
[1:15:53] we are Sons and Daughters of God no
[1:15:54] matter what
[1:15:56] you know my Dad recently I'll bury my
[1:15:58] dad a little bit here he read the Bible
[1:16:00] twice all the way through 2022 twice
[1:16:03] just start out his day and I'll read a
[1:16:05] whole bunch of it
[1:16:06] that wasn't because he was trying to
[1:16:07] impress anybody
[1:16:09] I'm trying to make a name for himself
[1:16:10] but because he realized you know he used
[1:16:12] to read it when he went before he went
[1:16:13] to bed but then he started doing it the
[1:16:14] first part of his day and he realized
[1:16:17] that it really put a big he put a big uh
[1:16:20] impact on his life
[1:16:23] it was out of love to God he's not he
[1:16:25] wasn't he wouldn't even tell anybody if
[1:16:26] I didn't tell people about it
[1:16:28] and it was a relationship that he had
[1:16:30] with the Lord Jesus Christ that's why he
[1:16:31] did it
[1:16:34] musicians please come on up
[1:16:37] you know I want to take these last few
[1:16:38] minutes I want to expose Satan for a few
[1:16:39] minutes about something
[1:16:41] that Satan uses on all of us to try to
[1:16:44] keep us down I want to talk a little bit
[1:16:45] about mistakes
[1:16:47] my dad preached a sermon a while back
[1:16:50] what will you do with your opportunity
[1:16:53] I'd say what will you do with your
[1:16:54] mistakes
[1:16:55] we're all going to have them
[1:16:58] what would you do
[1:17:00] I wrecked the two nicest cars I've ever
[1:17:02] had but what would I do with that
[1:17:05] turn it into a test
[1:17:06] imony drive slow
[1:17:09] there
[1:17:12] not a good idea
[1:17:15] and in that moment when I was stuck
[1:17:17] there and I was just there God made me
[1:17:19] with no neuroticism I wasn't surprised I
[1:17:22] wasn't scared I just
[1:17:24] was bummed out I was just well this is
[1:17:26] going to cost a lot of money this is
[1:17:27] really annoying and then I drove a lot
[1:17:29] carefully from then
[1:17:30] on but it was
[1:17:33] a mistake but what would you understand
[1:17:35] Oneness we know we make mistakes but you
[1:17:37] mustn't look at that it's not your
[1:17:39] mistakes because you're always going to
[1:17:41] have them but you see it's following his
[1:17:43] rules following what he said do stumble
[1:17:45] and falling doesn't have one thing to do
[1:17:47] with it a real true servant if he'll
[1:17:49] stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles
[1:17:51] God pulls him right back to the in the
[1:17:53] path as long as he's in the path of Duty
[1:17:54] but if he's off of the path of Duty
[1:17:56] God's not obligated to him but as long
[1:17:58] as he's in the path of Duty God's
[1:18:00] obligated to him knowing that he's just
[1:18:02] a man or a woman he's obligated to that
[1:18:04] person as long as they're on the path of
[1:18:05] Duty mistakes are about getting you out
[1:18:07] of the
[1:18:08] lines of fighting
[1:18:11] Satan got King David when David the
[1:18:13] Bible says when David when kings go
[1:18:15] forth to battle
[1:18:16] that's when Satan got David David stayed
[1:18:19] when kings were supposed to go forth to
[1:18:20] battle
[1:18:22] mistakes are always about
[1:18:25] making the mistake is about Satan wants
[1:18:26] to get you in a loop Temptation mistake
[1:18:28] guilt Temptation mistake guilt and get
[1:18:31] you to feel unworthy here's a big thing
[1:18:34] we're not supposed to feel worthy we're
[1:18:37] supposed to feel like we can make it and
[1:18:39] like we've really done right
[1:18:40] in fact I'd say we're supposed to feel
[1:18:42] unworthy because Jesus died for us sorry
[1:18:45] at my church I have Jesus on the right
[1:18:47] side so I'm used to doing that Jesus on
[1:18:50] the left side here
[1:18:53] I believe mistakes are there where Satan
[1:18:55] will try to make your identity with your
[1:18:56] mistakes but they're also there so that
[1:18:57] you can fall so that you can become a
[1:18:59] stronger again with God so God can
[1:19:01] restore you back to our relationship
[1:19:02] with him
[1:19:04] why would we have guilt when Jesus
[1:19:06] already paid for every mistake and every
[1:19:07] wrong we ever did when you make a
[1:19:09] mistake you repent and say God I'm so
[1:19:11] sorry God please help me I want to start
[1:19:13] a brother ready biscal preacher sermon
[1:19:15] the value of the flaw
[1:19:17] the flaw is the thing that gets you back
[1:19:19] to God over and over and over again God
[1:19:22] please help me God please be with me
[1:19:24] Paul said Cindy came exceedingly sinful
[1:19:30] you know armor is not just designed so
[1:19:32] that you'll never get hit it's designed
[1:19:33] so that when you do get hit
[1:19:35] it won't pierce your skin but you'll
[1:19:37] feel the impact but you can get back up
[1:19:38] again and keep on fighting
[1:19:41] just last quote and I'll uh I'll close
[1:19:45] the exposition of the seven shirts
[1:19:47] changes
[1:19:50] remember this Christ is the true church
[1:19:52] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:19:54] The Book of Revelation shows us pilot
[1:19:56] making them
[1:19:58] look warm and formal and Powerless it
[1:20:01] exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:20:02] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:20:04] and the discredible discrediting of
[1:20:06] God's word write down
[1:20:11] he fights that he cannot stand he knows
[1:20:14] that if the people get the true
[1:20:15] revelation of the true church and she
[1:20:18] will will be
[1:20:20] an invincible Army if they get a true
[1:20:22] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[1:20:24] frame
[1:20:25] work of the Christian church
[1:20:27] and by God's spirit discern and
[1:20:29] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[1:20:31] will be powerless before her
[1:20:32] he will be as definitely thwarted today
[1:20:34] as when Christ withstood his every
[1:20:36] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:20:37] desert
[1:20:40] but we love it true revelation
[1:20:43] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[1:20:45] but we will prevail over them
[1:20:47] how many have made mistakes in the past
[1:20:49] week would you please stand up stand up
[1:20:51] if you made a mistake in the past week
[1:20:55] how many have done something they knew
[1:20:56] was wrong we didn't anyways obviously
[1:20:58] both hands
[1:21:00] how many are still fighting how many are
[1:21:02] still in this message regardless
[1:21:05] Invincible doesn't mean you never get
[1:21:07] hurt it doesn't mean you never fall it
[1:21:09] means that
[1:21:10] every time you
[1:21:12] you ever
[1:21:13] fell and I believe that I'm not looking
[1:21:16] at a will be invented well do you still
[1:21:18] believe in the message brother

[1:21:22] so did I but you're still fighting right
[1:21:25] you're an invincible Army invincibly
[1:21:27] means no matter what Satan did no matter
[1:21:29] how many mistakes God always restored
[1:21:31] you back to a relationship with him this
[1:21:33] is that's the sermon tonight is going
[1:21:36] back to a relationship with the Lord
