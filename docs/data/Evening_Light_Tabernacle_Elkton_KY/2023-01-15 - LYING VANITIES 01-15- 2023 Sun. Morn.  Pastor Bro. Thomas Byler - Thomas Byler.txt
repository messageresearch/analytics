foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] stand with me if you will children are dismissed at Sunday school thank you we'll just ask brother Tommy to open the Service in prayer foreign with me if you will to Philippians chapter 3. foreign my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed it is not Grievous but for you it is safe foreign for we for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh circumcise The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee thank you but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith foreign if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do for getting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before let us therefore as many as be perfect thus minded and if in anything ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you Brethren B followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample yeah whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is in there saying who mine Earthly things and this last one together who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like into the Glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things in terms of Amen you maybe did Brother Brian foreign that whole chapter you could or take this literally but you could go home and you've had a service already this morning when you read the first couple of verses in Philippians 3 . see where Paul is letting everyone know he was a Pharisee of Pharisees he had all the knowledge he had everything and it didn't mean anything because he didn't have Jesus Christ to start with and it's no different for us she could have everything in the world and still have nothing you could be worthless and still have you have millions billions of dollars and if you don't have Christ Jesus it doesn't mean anything if you would charge me to the 9th and 10th chapter of Romans you know I was sitting there this morning I was read there was a devotional for January 15th before I get started in Romans I got it here it kind of speaks to what brother Thomas and brother Brad and other preachers have been talking about you know everyone here this morning knows whether you're who you are and what you are in Christ Jesus I mean it's not what's on the outside but it's what's on the inside and I'll read this devotional this morning for January 15th it it really speaks to what's been said Lately from the pulpit and the the verse is out of Matthew the 10th chapter verses 6 through 20. behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be you therefore wives and serpents and harmless as doves you know that's really important it's not nothing wrong with being smart but you have to use that you're what God teaches you what he inspires you with you've got to be harmless about how you treat people with it and he goes on or they will deliver you up to councils they will start you in their synagogues and you shall be brought before Governors and Kings for my sake you know you bring it into our day and age you know we don't have a king here we have people that think they're kings but we don't have Kings here but you still have representatives in the government and for a testimony against them and the Gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought of how you shall speak and that's you know we get times you know a lot of times we don't know what we're going to say or how we're going to say or when we're going to say it but if you just yield to the spirit of Jesus Christ God will give you what you need to say to that situation that you're facing this morning whether it's talking to another man a woman about the Gospel of Jesus Christ or whatever it is you but you got to store up you can't have no you got to store up can you apply the knowledge you stored up correctly no but take what you stored up and use it for his glory when it's time and needful and then um let me finish this but when they deliver you up take no thought of how you shall speak for it shall be given of you in the same hour that you shall speak or does not even speak but the spirit of your father would speak within you and that's the verse and this is what brother Brown had to say you know when you read that third I'm you read that third chapter of Philippians we just read uh you should never be embarrassed being believing in the message of the hour because Paul said exactly in that third chapter of Philippians what brother Brown said in the message of the hour he he he's just saying the same thing Paul fell away from church today and said well I kind of enjoy going down there I like to sing and people are friendly around a little don't do that so he's basically saying if you're going to church just for a good feeling and just because you like the people or you like the singing or you like the preacher that's not the purpose of it and he goes um don't do that brother let your heart become a flame say here I've got to do something about this I've got to go out and see if I can get somebody saved you know that really is a thought for the age that we live in and uh he goes on and don't go out saying bless God if you don't repent you're going to Paris it now go go out out excuse me go out in general and be as wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove and see that's the way you go way too go approach the person and you all know what brother random says about how you witness the people you don't witness the people sending their souls to hell but you wouldn't witness them with loving understanding it goes to say here approach the person if he's raising chickens talk about chickens to him for a while see and then the first thing you know you'll be talking about the Lord if he's a farmer talk about his farm he sells automobiles talk about his own automobiles for a while what nice cars you got so forth until you catch the spirit of when the father says now it's time to approach him about the soul and you know that's the same and witnessing and it's the same in anything that we do God wants a our quiet Spirit he doesn't want a Holy Spirit and then it goes on to say here you can wind it off you see that's a fine automobile you know Transportation day has become so great for how the Nations have been brought close together and the cities of our Nations friends and mothers can visit each other you know it's a wonderful thing to have on he's just trying to set an example on how to talk to somebody about about the Lord by first having an introduction to them like like you're selling yes sir it's sure how you know you're you know a puffing on a cigar whatever it is basically what he's saying here whatever you see on the outside you might foreign you just got to put that aside and realize that man or that woman has got a soul and you got to have an inner reaction before the Gospel of Jesus Christ can have its way don't do you ever think of the old times when you've already seen something like that just keep going on like that you know and after a while yep sure is you know another thing it does it it brings like we have it in like in revivals people can come across the country quickly for Revival you see your opening in the way of time you know but he's basically you know it kind of speaks to the edge right now you all have tablets you all have the ability whether you can come to church or not you can keep feeding yourself from the word of God and if you feel something close choke up clock up that way stop right there move over another doctor said to me Lord fill my mouth with good words then nudging when I said enough you see nudging when I said enough I think that's a good sentence for the day people have to real you know I'm a person of little words don't take me wrong I don't speak a lot but sometimes you can say too much or you might not say enough but I was reading this morning and then that comes I think if I if you went to your devotional Let's uh believe comes out of the Hebrew Series in the late 50s I think that's the Hebrews 3 if you all want to know where that quote comes to but I was thinking this morning as I was reading the 9th and 10th chapter of Romans uh I'll go to the 10th chapter of Romans I'm looking at the clock back there also of with what I was reading this morning and that Psalm I mean the Philippians 3 um as I read this chapter he's speaking to the children of Israel in in his day and age brother Paul is but when you see him talking about the Jews we're talking about the south I just sees or Pharisee in now it's not a Hebrew church but it's a Christian church and I'll just read the 10th chapter and I'll sit down everyone knows this is this dance chapter for us to introduce people to Jesus Christ but it has a lot of other nuggets in it this morning and it starts with the first verse of the 10th chapter of Romans Brethren my heart desires and prayer to God for Israel that they might be saved so you would just replace I'm not being sacrilegious here just replace Israel with the current Church of the hour that we have right now are Paul would be no different as brother Branham or any other minister would be to see people saved and he goes on for I bear them records They have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge that's the same thing for our age that we live in right now the church World they have knowledge but they don't have what they need they don't have the right Zeal in it for being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God and that speaks to today they're building denominations and they're building church but they're not building converts to Jesus Christ for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth and goes on say for Moses describe the righteousness which is of the Lord that a man would stealth these things shall live by you could take that verse and apply it to the age that we're at right now not the law itself but the law of Grace you think of it that way and he goes on to say I lost my place here I don't want to reread read starting at the seventh who uh the sixth verse which is of is a faith speak it on this wise say not in the heart we shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is bring Christ again from the dead but that but what is said the word is nine even in thy mouth and in thy heart This Is The Word of Faith which we preach and that's where we're all at this morning and if thou shall confess the Lord Jesus Shall Believe in thy heart but God had raised him from the dead thou shall be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with a mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed and that's you know this was this is Paul speaking here and that's no different for us if you believe on Jesus Christ this morning you have nothing to be ashamed of you have nothing to be afraid of talking to other people about Jesus Christ there's no there should be no fear in it and I lost my place again for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord is overall is Rich on to all that call upon them and everyone knows this verse it's in the you hear people talk about Romans road of salvation for whomsoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call him and whom they have not believed and how so they believe in him who they have not heard and how shall they hear a preacher you can't get away from the scripture here this morning that's how God sent his church that he would take fallible men to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ that are inspired by the Holy Ghost and how shall they preach except they be sent it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace being glad things of good things but they have but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Elias say Lord who has believed a report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God faith and have not heard yes very their sound went into all the Earth and their words into the ends of their world but I say did not Israel know first Moses saith I will provoke them to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish Nation I will anger you and it's no different today you as message Believers I believe that kind of speaks to us today and he goes on to say I lost my place but Elias is very bold and saith I was found of them that sought me not and I was made manifest unto them that asked not to me but the Israel saith all day long I have stretched forth my hand onto a disobedient and gained same people we don't want to be that last scripture this morning we want to be the group that receives Jesus Christ freely and there's no there's no continent you know no disputing and that God has his way in our hearts and lives this morning I didn't mean take a lot you know as one thing I have Assurance of or as a as a Believer God is going to make a way no matter what the situation is this morning so whatever your need is this morning just put cast it on him who cares for you Brother David hey man let's stay in this morning amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning he man let's sing that little course on page 574 I'm in that number this morning amen are

they came back rejoicing because they had power over the enemy you know they could cast out devils and you know the Lord told him and he said you know basically he said don't don't be rejoicing for that so much but Rejoice because your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life a man before the foundation of the world you know it don't matter what you're going through this morning or if you're

amen amen we just kind of going all along I mean I guess it's close to the middle of January already so amen gonna be quick isn't it amen the birds will be chirping before we know it amen praise the Lord so God is good amen and so I can't think of any announcements or anything let's just go before the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus and this morning our heart just goes to thinking about sister Parish this morning Lord is she still not feeling the best we know the Lord Jesus did by your stripes she is healed Lord and we thank you Father for that and desire God that you'll just do a special work for her and also protect brother Parish Lord watch over him and be with him in a special way and any any of us Lord that has been sick Lord and we just ask God you just help us to believe and to know that we're completely better Lord Jesus we love you this morning and ask God that you would just bring us the word that you would have us at here Lord and say what you want to his father and we ask God that you tell me just to step aside and and as their Prophet said just to pull must pull himself into certain gear just to release himself and let you have his way Lord and many thoughts I have on my heart speak this morning Father and but Lord I know that it's going to take you just your inspiration and your leadership father to place it in there just the way that you want it this morning but we do ask God did you come father anoint us Lord Jesus and give us the ability to minister your word and edify the body of Christ this morning Lord be with different ones traveling not here Lord this morning and father those streaming Lord Jesus we ask your blessing to rest upon them in a special way and may we all go from here saying it's been a good good to be in the house of the Lord we love you and ask for your power now father just to come in his best way in Jesus name amen and amen I don't know what my voice wants to kind of uh be dampened so to speak it feels like amen but we'll see amen so I gotta well I feel like a new message amen so certainly I don't think that I've preached on it before amen but um it just come to me in a two words basically come to me and amen and I wasn't really sure even where it was found in the Bible and what it was talking about even but in those two words that come to me that I felt like you know I felt like the Lord was speaking to me about amen those two words were lying vanities lying vanities amen I says well I ask my father where do you find that in the Bible who was it what was what was said about that and so forth but amen and so amen but I thought it had to do with Jonah I was pretty sure it had to do with Jonah amen and his symptoms and so forth but amen and so we want to go to the Book of John he man this is really amen this is centered towards and certainly is uh Centered for the believer it applies to a Believer amen doesn't really apply to a unbeliever amen so we definitely want to speak to Believers this morning with the help of the Lord amen let's start with Jonah the first chapter and we'll begin of the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of Mind infliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and that hurt us my voice for thou had cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas and in the floods come pass me about all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again Towers I hope the waters can pass me about now notice he's talking about his symptoms even to the soul the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountains the Earth with her bars with was about me every forever yet has thou brought me up brought up my life from corruption oh Lord my God when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came on in unto me into thine Holy Temple they that observed lying vanities forsake their own Mercy but I will sacrifice and today with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon dry land begotten His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen so we want to speak with the help of the Lord about lying vanities vanities and of course like we could take a lot of time here on this amen just talking about vanity and things that are Vain and I want to just go ahead and I pulled up the meaning of vanities and of course one of them we know vanity is uh it calls in the plural sense it calls it excessive Pride or in or uh admiration of One's Own appearance or achievements amen and uh then there's another another another one here as a modifier it calls it he says the quality the quality of being worthless or futile amen there's another one uh the adjective and another place he says it I ask it twice one for vanity and one for vain Amen in vain it says that it is um hold on vain means without acts without success or a result producing no results useless useless amen amen notice how that even Jesus talked about uh um how about the the Pharisees and talk about how he said that they in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines of men something that is of no use amen and isn't this something how that Jonah now Jonah said and he called his symptoms he called his symptoms lying vanities amen praise the Lord all right well give me a minute I think I left my notes in here all right I'll be right back there we are praise the Lord I only got a few of them this morning don't have very many but amen I like the way that the prophet put it and I want to read it as we start out now brother bam he says you know everybody is looking at their symptoms the pastor will pray for them and they'll go over and say that well now I don't I don't seem to be any better well that's not healing healing he says no the symptoms are the worst things one of the greatest scarecrows the devil's God symptoms don't have nothing to do with it because it's what God Said Amen my if there's anybody ever had a case of symptoms it was Jonah he had boy he had the symptoms he was backslid huh backslid hands tied behind him in the belly of a whale about a mile deep remember he said you know I'm down below the mountains I mean and he talked about the different places brother but I'm talking about this mentioned how that my goldfish and after he eats it'll go down to the very bottom and spread its fins out and just sit at the bottom they said describe this fish as doing that in the belly of the whale about a mile deep in the ocean a stormy sea seaweeds wrapped around his neck you talk about symptoms he looked this way and it was all Will's belly he looked that way and it was all whale's belly everywhere he looked was whale's belly can I say something I'm gonna put a little to it I I've kind of have a tendency to believe that no matter where he looked he couldn't see a thing can you imagine Ain't No Light down there and inside of his stomach there ain't no light that I know of in there so everywhere looked or felt should we say everything was Well's belly we don't found him and I can only imagine this morning it didn't smell too good you know I you know I can only imagine there might have been so much water you know in there with him and he's slushing around in that slushy water and mess and the acid and oh my what a good you know God had to actually I believe God had to put some especially in there because when you were in the stomach that long you're going to start deteriorating right but for him not to deteriorate for three days isn't that right in that mess in that weeds and everything and then notice how he had symptoms everywhere and he said yeah you know even though I only Temple and that's in their eyes the better man goes on he says notice he says he had oh my run his neck you talk about symptoms everywhere look that away it was whale's belly everywhere look but he said there lying vanity right he said look at this whale's belly anymore but once more will I look to your whole Temple see it just depends on what you're looking at but once more is it not ice he says if you're looking at your symptoms they'll be there if you look at God's word symptoms will have to vanish I'm gonna take a little trip with the help of the Lord this morning let's go all the way from Genesis all the way down amen and I'll start with perhaps Genesis but I want to pick it up again when to Solomon and some of the things that Solomon talk about vanity because one thing and I want you to understand one thing that anything that isn't real is Vanity it's vain it's useless it comes to an end it's temporal isn't that right anything and we know that Adam amen Adam and Eve in the fall through us all into vanity he threw they threw everything the whole creation they threw into vanity amen amen but you know as we pick it up perhaps later that Jesus come to give you something real isn't that right you know because even Jesus said the Bible talks about he didn't have the son have life he that hath not the son has not I come to give you life and give it to you more abundantly because even life itself was vanity if all you have is your natural life all you have is Vanity it's feudal it's worthless it doesn't mean anything at all oh my God but lying vanities it's pretty good praise be to God Thug we know that amen all these things are vanities first of all amen Adam threw us into that threw us into vanities into complete vanity and I want to have a scripture to back that up would that be okay that everything is Vanity Solomon he got a real revelation of vanity what it was all about but you know I like I like these all these vanities will try to bring up and call them lying vanities amen in Ecclesiastes all right Ecclesiastes will begin with verse 1 and perhaps verse 12. all right and I the preacher was King over Israel in Jerusalem and I gave my heart to seek and search out wisdom concerning all the things that are done under the heaven this sword travail hath God given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith I've seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is Vanity amen you know even before I found this scripture that was going in my mind I was thinking you know so everything everything in the natural is all vanity and then I'll begin to think about what some of the things that Solomon talked about his frustration with everything being so vain so useless amen and he says all the works that under Down Under the Sun Builder all vanity and vexation of spirits amen now let's go down uh down to verse chapter 2 verse one and I said in my heart now and I will prove thee with Mira a mirth am I art th Mirth for enjoy pleasure and behold is also is Vanity I said to laughter's mad and tomorrow what does that's it I saw it in my heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainted Mine Heart with wisdom and to lay hold on Folly till I might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do Under the heaven all the days of their life oh my I made me great works I build me houses I planted me Vineyards amen I made me Gardens and Orchards and planted trees in them and all kinds of fruits are you with me when enjoy all the fruits of all the truths and so forth I made me pools of water and watered there with the wood uh the wood that bringeth forth trees I got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house and also had great possession of Great and Small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me huh he was a Donald Trump he was a multi-billionaire it was very rich he had everything you could imagine I gathered me also silver and gold and peculiar Treasure of kings and of the provinces I get me men singers and women singers and the Delights of the son of men as musical instruments of all that source so I was great increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem amen let me tell you something this just goes to show it doesn't matter if you're a millionaire a millionaire I don't care how great amen like Jesus as you know you gained the whole world what does it profit y'all absolutely doesn't do your pentagon huh if you lose your own soul oh my my wisdom remained with me and whatsoever in my eyes desired I kept not from them I withheld not my heart from any joy and my heart rejoice in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor and I looked at all the works at my hands that wrought and the labor that I had labored to do and behold hey are you with me somebody knows you're not going to get anywhere focusing on things that are vanity Don't Mean a Thing my he had gotten to the top whether it's wine whether it was music whether at all that I delighted myself in doesn't matter huh sexual pleasure with his 500 or a thousand wives huh doesn't matter what it is all he said it's all vanity doesn't get you anywhere doesn't mean a thing amen Ma behold all was vanity and next nation of spirit and there was no Prophet under the sun I think he described perfectly what Adam took us into that's where Adam took us into something that does not profit gets you nowhere amen because you can gain the whole world and still only own about three foot wide and six foot of ground that's your space and you're down under there and don't even know it doesn't do you any good that's where vanity goes and that's where vanity gets you nowhere how many believe the whole world needs to hear that everybody out there it doesn't matter how much wealth you get no matter how rich you get no matter how much land oh how much no matter how much pleasure no matter how nice you have it it's all vanity doesn't mean nothing pretty strong ain't it and he says a whole lot more and listen down to verse 17 so therefore I hated life because that the work that is raw Under the Sun is Grievous unto me for all is Vanity and vaccines the spirits oh my I can't help but think and feel that he had a little bit of what Abraham in it a little bit of what Moses added him because Abraham went and he was not pleased with where he was but he seek see who's filter and make her with God he was a pilgrim and a stranger and he had focus and he wanted more how many days that's the way a Christian is we want more than just what this life holds [Music] that's the way Solomon must have felt I hate it all verse 18. yeah I hated all the labor which I had taken on under the sun because I should leave it and to the man that shall be after me how many knows that one thing that it's about the Millennium of the prophet in the Bible says that you know what we'll build houses and another cell that had happened by the work of your hand that's what we're fighting for something that's real something that's nothing something that's eternal if that isn't your ambition tonight you need to get on your prayer bones see God what is my desire what am I looking at this morning amen my leave it after me for who knoweth whether he shall be wise or a fool ah this is what he said yes shall he have rule over all my labor worrying I have laid it and wherein I have showed myself why is Under the Sun this also is Vanity in other words you don't know what's going to happen with your fortune when you leave it your kids might spend your fortune in no time or maybe your kids perhaps maybe get sick or dissed out of the other half and then have to spend all about just to stay alive you don't know what'll happen like the Bible says one place he says yo don't don't look at riches they get riches get wings and flies away amen verse 20 therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I had took under the sun amen for there is a man whose labor is in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity yet to a man that hath not labored therein he shall leave it for his portion this also is Vanity and a great evil oh and how I'm long story amen how many is looking for an eternal home right for what is half man of all his labors and the vexation of his heart wherein he hath labored Under the Sun for all these days are sorrows and his travail grief yeah taketh no rest in the night this also is Vanity amen so many different things but what's up there amen so think about that vanity Solomon saying that all is Vanity all the works everything is Vanity praise be God under the first Adam he brought us all into this but the Christian for the creation amen it's not Christian has something that's not vanity amen I believe the Apostle Paul Allah I want to just go into the Apostle Paul what he said Paul said in second Corinthians 4 Verse 18 for we look not at the things which are seen huh but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal huh everything but the things which are not seen are Eternal brother random is preaching up in Canada he got out there and I'm not sure what it was anymore I didn't go back up into the deep detail but he was trying to buy something he was out there buying it and and he got to talking to this man and he caught this man you know that was having these meetings up there and he says he's nothing but a hypocrite he says you're not with this Brando outfit and all this other stuff you all remember the story and got really down on him this out of the other he said what are you thinking I said oh what do you think about that guy and I says well I don't know and he said well I said I think he's the biggest hypoc I've ever seen and I said do you really do he said yes sir I know he said the first thing he's got nothing but fight psychology and I said uh were you there last night he said yeah and I said what about that Soldier they brought up there all crippled up no he said that Soldier could have walked anyhow if he just tried it hmm and I said are you a Christian he says oh no said I don't believe in none of that stuff he said I'm a scientist he said if anything cannot be proven scientifically he says it's absolutely an error and I said uh-huh I said I had to take the other side but it says I'm going to tell you that the thing's real are the things that cannot be scientifically proven so everything that you see everything that can be scientifically proven or not real why because they're only Jeopardy will pass away they'll go back to the dust that they come from oh he said you're wrong and I says all right and he said uh he said if it can't be scientific proven it's not real and I says my partner I believe that the things that's not that's real cannot be scientifically anything that's scientifically proven is not real it's perishable and he said oh I think you're wrong and I said I want to ask you something are you a married man he's a cure got any children yes I said do you love your wife he said yes sir I said well what is love I said scientifically tell me what love amen praise be to God he says what's the what's about that woman that is about any other one what's the difference about them children any different is he is love he says you can't scientifically prove it to me amen but better ma'am says later on talks about you you know never win anybody by an argument it takes the Holy Spirit but the point was what program says anything that's real is something that can't be seen I mean that's what Christ came and that's what he died for is to give us something real even one place I believe the church says he says you know one day we'll that realization will come the perfect realization amen oh my let me go before I go into that that Avenue I want to go down here for just a little bit if it's all right let's look at some more now we realize that brother Brown says that you know that our symptoms is what lie to you you get prayed for it you get and you look at your symptoms right they're lie according to the word of God they're lies they're the one that lies the devil is what lies to you the Bible says one place that every man's word be a lie and mind the truth and certainly when the devil tells you something you don't want to believe that you know because he's certainly going to lie to you and their their Jonah was like mother van says you know Jonah was down there at the bottom of the well in the belly of the well we dropped around him and meant it didn't look at all but he says they're all just a bunch of lying symptoms I'm gonna be once again he knew that he knew God's Gonna deliver him he looked at the Holy Temple and he prayed and he believed in that confidence in the God Amen is that that uh I believe it was a um it was Solomon that had dedicated to someone he says God he and his dedication to the prayer he made a big stop of working and got all said he got in front of everybody and he made his big long prayer amen if anybody amen looks towards this Temple then here thou from Heaven if their backslip he is from Heaven all kinds of conditions nothing how far to get away from God if they look to this supper hey man now the name let them pray to this and you will hear from heaven and Jonah with backslady with all terrible he said he was like in Hell and he said you know I believe and have confidence in the prayer Asylum that God's gonna hear it and he looked hard to Temple amen and got delivered him he says how much more you and I when Jesus said whatever things you desire believe in you'll receive him and you will have them just the temple and no matter what your symptoms are [Music] oh my God do you realize this morning that we've got a lot of symptoms yep got a lot of symptoms but they're lying symptoms how am I I like that don't you they're lying symptoms praise be to God when a person has got behind God behind them it doesn't matter what the opposition is look at David let's just look at David for a minute he got in front of this great big Goliath all right this glass war did he take him and he take him on the end of his beer and he'd feed his body and his flesh to the to the birds the fall of the air what could David say David could say you lied devil you are big you're huge bird you ain't nothing but a lying symptom huh cause today I'm gonna cut your head off because I don't come to you in my own power but I got the different set of eyeballs I'm looking at something different thank you amen that's what a Christian has to have you've got to have a different view than a natural person you gotta look and see by faith David seeing him dead yet no he knew that that God would come down because that bear went down the line went back down that giant that wanted to scare the liver out of David didn't scare him at all he was lying to me amen Moses look at Moses a whole whole fair in all of Egypt when God spoke to him says go deliver my people he went down there amen and he chose him that he'll let that five people gone do you realize how many times and failed almost do not let them go Moses could look in his face and say Pharaoh you are lying you're lying because you are gonna let him go you're nothing but a lying symptom isn't that right they should build Faith this morning hello should build Faith to know the hell yeah oh it's just me I realize I'm just an old man a gray-headed old man but I'm here to tell you it's not about who I am it's about who's behind me I want you to know this morning it ain't about who you are and it's about who is behind you who are you with if you're a God is with us who can be against you [Music] he said you're lying there you are gonna let my people go cause God said you better let him go every man's word is a lie tell your word is alive because God's word is short he said I have come to deliver my people and he's going to deliver his people away from God I want you to know you don't have to stay that way all you got to do is look look and live look at what God Said oh my let me shout out something else something else comes to my Abraham Abraham ain't that right God told Abraham said Abraham I've called you I want you to leave your land I want you to leave your family are you leave everybody take you and Sharon you come out here and serve me out here what did he do he went out the way God said but when he do he brought his dad he brought his nephew lot and after a while attend he was backslid he didn't do what God had told him to do when you don't do what God tells you to do your backslip and then Abraham got miserable and there was a fight that brewed up between his his kid the herdsmen between lot and Abraham never the big fuss and the feud huh no doubt Abraham says I knew I should have brought him along God told me not to bring him alone foreign how many times in our lives you know something don't go right and ain't right because you know you do something you ain't not supposed to do you're not where you ought to be do you wanna then you get that conscience to condemn you huh but what was it Abraham didn't give up he believed no matter what God has made the promise I'm still going to be a father of Nations you'll work it out and Abraham's backslitting this is not being completely surrendered to God all of those things were just symptoms they were lying symptoms because God was going to do what God was going to bring this Strife he was going to accept get him to separate from his from God he's going to cause his daddy daddy was he died finally huh finally got to the place the brother van says he got the fully surrendered to God and God poured him out the full blessing let me tell you something so many times the devil will get you to look it's your fault look at your failures things that you think you'll never ever overcome the devil that's a devil's life oh you'll never overcome this you'll never overcome don't you believe the devil's lie laughs amen this is nothing but a symptom for a real believer nothing but a symptom praise be to God how many beliefs ever Abraham's children last week we had a little riddle about you need to be a bee don't be a wannabe huh and be a b don't be a hasbian you know something that used to be there you go be a bee not a used to be and not just not and I was but you are this week I have another one for you amen let's turn if you will I I believe it's found in well I didn't Mark I've got the little tab here but I didn't uh here it is Romans Romans 4. Romans 4 Abraham talking about Abraham Romans 4 and verse 17 as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the Dead now I noticed and cold though things which be not as though they were amen Believers call those things which are as though they're not and we call those things which are not as though they are the things that be not we call as they are and those things which be we call it as they are not in other words the symptoms because how many beliefs if you're an Abraham seed you are in the business of speaking things into existence and you're in the business of speaking things out of existence Abraham called it you know all his body well let me just read the rest of it can we who against hope believed in Hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall by seed be well it comes to mind let me just say something else you know what a symptom is a symptom there's a symptom called doubt is that right and a Believer what are you supposed to do with your doubt doubt your doubt in other words speak that doubt out of existence see I doubt that doubt don't believe that now I don't believe that I'm believing but the devil tries to put it in my mind bring every thought in your mind under the Captivity of the word of God destroy that symptom of unbelief well I can don't you ever say that word all things are possible to them that believe amen Hallelujah oh my notice and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now death he didn't know how it was gonna happen but I mean his body was dead at 90 some years old Sarah's womb was dead and again he wasn't gonna have no children perhaps they hadn't had no relations in 20 years or so how is anything ever going to happen but they did not consider it you know what another symptom of Abraham was Hagar isn't that right because his wife said they're going to Hagar and let's have the seed that the God promised they got their dirty hands in it didn't they that's why we got a bunch of wild men running around here trying to kill everybody yeah the Bible says every man's hand is against him and he's against every man if they ain't if they ain't fighting you and I they're fighting each other he's a bunch of Fighters you ever saw but God had a plan in it all but what that was solve this is the symptoms Abraham knew yeah we didn't do it was right I know that ain't good away that God's gonna do it but it's all a lion saying God's still gonna do it yeah man praise be to God not even his own body now that when he was a hundred years old neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief was was strong in faith even glory to God Hallelujah aren't you glad Abraham was a man who called everything as always wasn't not all of those lying symptoms there's nothing but lying symptoms well you ain't holy enough you ain't running righteous enough you know there's going to be a lot of message people that's not going to go in the Rapture and the devil tell you you're probably one of them he'll try to put you in the mind you look at how you are you're probably not you're probably not one of them foreign are you ready well I got a good one for the devil when he tries to give me anything put that thought in my mind and if he does yours you just tell him this but I want you to know something that if I ever did make it I read the book I'm not gonna unbelieve that no matter what he tries to tell me huh is that right not a matter of you trying to make it God's going to see to it how many knows that the Seed of Abraham the children of God Amen whether you make it or not that is unconditional Covenant with God yes promise you I will do it it's not what you do sure I'm going to chastise it for you Craig I'll bring you to Perfection I'll chastise you for your mistakes but I'm not going to lose you he said I'm not going to lose any of them and what was it this is another good thought if if you want to take a different approach somebody said brother Brandon you're Antichrist even hell and this side of the other he says well okay they do then that's what I want to do whatever the Lord's will is for me that's what I want he says but I have a strong feeling that if I do I am lost and he cast me aside all I want is to keep this love that I have in my heart friend you know if I can have that because he knew he whether he loved the Lord or not if he kind of doubted that God was to cast somebody away to love you amen doubt your doubts amen doubt your doubts doubt all your symptoms your shortcomings even they're lying symptoms they're not going to keep you this just comes to mind didn't brother Bannon say God's Gonna Save you despite yourself You're Gonna Save you despite yourself you might want to try to get in a way but God's going to do it because how many knows did you I'm glad that I'm not in my own I don't hold my own future my own purpose god holds my future and purpose praise be to God lying symptoms now false enough area lying symptoms Abraham Falls he had problems but they were lying symptoms that wasn't going to keep him from getting the problems he got the promise just the same amen staggered not but he was fully persuaded what he had promised he was able to perform amen talking of Moses again talk about Moses a little bit by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come of years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for his season do you reckon that Moses got a different view got a different vision huh he's seen all the pleasures of Egypt him being the next Pharaoh just kind of like what Solomon was Solomon ruling everything and have every pleasure he could imagine huh and here Moses could have had it at all enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season with Moses I don't know that it was that way with uh app uh Solomon I don't believe he was a sinner and all that he kept all things pure but yet he could have all the pleasures amen until of course at the end how many knows his wives let him let him stray and don't mean it was I'm not saying that but all of his Heathen lives amen all right to enjoy the presence of sin for a season that's deeming the reproach of Christ greater riches and all the treasures of Egypt for yet respect unto the recompense of the reward he's seen a greater reward how many knows Paul said there's a flight Affliction which is put for a small season is not to be compared with the great reward for a Christian for a believer amen if by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible they believe it's important that you keep your eyes on the right thing come back into another thought but how many remembers brother Ram says Abraham was an old man is that right he was an old man and his body was I don't know how he walked this stooped over and had to go slow but he says he kept believing God's word he was as he put He says he said God came to him as our Shadi eye which means the breasted God and Abraham kept nursing on God and that's how he got his strength it don't matter if I go down this far God's going to bring me back up I don't care how slow I'm gonna get Gods you're gonna do it amen how many about us Christians let me tell you something if you're sick whatever it is don't never look at that statement you look at the word of God amen and you'll overcome that because you're a child of Abraham no matter what it is amen so Abraham and now Moses he looked at the one who was invisible for he endures in him who was invisible Moses amen and what happened we know what happened amen he destroyed Egypt the whole country look at what happened to him because of it was vanity everything was vanity lying vanities praise be to God how many believe that Jesus came to give us something real something real what is real that are not seen that joy that you have in your heart that peace that you have in your heart Donald Trump with all couldn't buy that Joy couldn't Buy that piece all of these rich people they it doesn't mean anything you can't buy this there amen it's the only thing that's real praise be to God how many believes that eternal life is real that's why I say to the real believer amen getting gray hair getting old getting feeble huh like I gave my ham 100 years old I'm dying I'm gonna go you realize that's a lie I'm dying no there's no such a thing as death to the believer come to mind remember remember uh let me just say this quick Paul he said you know when he comes down to death oh death where's your sting you're lying to me oh grave where is your Vic Victory you're lying this is a lie for a Believer now not for an unbeliever because they will die but for a Believer there's no such a thing as death sure this body but guess what there's a oh my remember even brother banham's wife tried to lie to him this is a new one for you isn't that right but brother Bill you lost all your hair remember that what did he say no I didn't don't lie to me huh no I didn't I didn't lose one hair I mean as God has every hair number so if they turn loose don't worry about him you'll get him back it's a lie your gray hair it's a lie because one of these days I'm gonna have every one of my hair restored huh I'm gonna have my color back I'm gonna have my youth back old age is a lie death is a lie still lying manatees hahaha that other goodness opening and running and everything else if you really believed it huh you really believe I really believe it when I drew on that last thing brand new fiance for waiting for me he's got another body waiting for me so don't tell me I'm gonna die them graveyards out there that's something that the devil brought isn't that right putting our friends in our loved ones in the ground that's a lie cause you're coming back you're gonna believe again amen is the only temporal everything temporal's lie everything Eternal is the truth and it's real it's your life is real yeah everybody didn't run a bad says where are my head yeah you said I don't have no but I'm telling you God knows where they are he'll give them back to me he's very hair of your head it's what number number one two three four five six seven all the way to two hundred and fifty thousand I don't know how many have you got but however many it is aren't you glad it's all these vanities are a lie they're lying vanities to a believer she'd give us great faith great hope getting weaker getting yeah maybe your body is but guess what you're going to be 20 years old you're going to be a prime of life for all time remember the story of the old couple I'm not sure if there it was their child I believe it was that it was at the point of death amen and they got brother bam to come in here and they wanted me to pray for the child and so forth and and and and and whenever a child got down there where the heartbeat was that low and every condition was that load that has never anybody ever made it and the nurse had went to nursing school and she understood all these things you know and she was you know and the prophet declared that you know that child's going to be well it's going to live and they went in there and they were rejoicing and this nurse says what are you so happy about isn't that right so what are you rejoicing because our child's gonna live it's gonna live and she says no I don't know why you guys hope about no child and she can't live it won't live it can't live it's what she was telling now who is lying I believe but the BAM says you know that if you if you have cancer whatever and God tells you you're going to be healed he's just the devil I mean the doctor tells you you are going to die he said you can laugh in his face to me you're gonna be like laughing [Music] you're never gonna overcome overcomer you'll never have joy again you'll never have that peace that passes understand these are lying devil if you ain't got it this morning you can have it peace that passes under say joy unspeakable and full of Glory don't believe yourself because I don't care how sad I don't care where you're at don't look at yourself look at the word of God amen they're lying vanities Paul called Death lying vanity don't oh damn Dad where is your sting oh crave where's your Victory but I thank God Jesus Christ that gives us the victories of Jesus Christ amen praise be to God and what was it that old man he says no this here Monitor and the scale says he's going to die and wasn't that didn't he grab her on the shoulder or something young lady I'm gonna tell you something he says you're looking at that monitor you're looking at that we're not looking at that we don't see that that doesn't mean anything it's vanity useless meaningless thank you don't mean to say it said he's gonna be wow what do you have made up this morning it's your promise every promise in the book's yours how many believe we need to quit looking at lying vanities don't look at those landmate they're lying Jonah in the midst of all of it as the prophets had called them lying said then I'm lying amenities and since they're coming back of Christ notice how did how did uh Solomon looked at this Earth and everything in here in a minute it's filled out it means nothing huh ultimately mean nothing you go in the grave as happens to the burden to birth of the fall of the air and has happened to animals that's what happens to human beings and all these other stuff and he was sick of life he wanted real life Jesus came to give you and me in real life now we don't have long if you're here you gotta get a job you gotta work you got to make money you got to feed your face gotta put clothes on gotta drive a car whatever you got to do all of that it's all passing how many police said one of these they will travel like a thought we won't need a Chevy or a Ford or a Dodge no I doubt well fuss about who's the fastest over there I imagine we'll fall fly about the same speed though thank you but let's press the prophecy I don't know what I do if I were the Christians that's right doesn't matter Abraham doesn't matter old people how old you get how broke down how people still shouldn't be depressed let me know as you get older our days of joy and our smile likes to turn into frown because there's a lot more aches and pains and things to be sad about when you get older huh sure but when you look to God's word you can do that 90 year old preacher his heels together nope happy but because of the word of God thank you Jesus thank you Lord praise the Lord you love it let's close it I'm enjoys the word of God I just thought Lord I just that thought came lying vanities I thought look at all these other things that are vanity that are vain that are useless that are lying amen with Solomon perhaps they weren't lying it just seemed so real everybody gets it there's no hope for you to Future this that or the other but Jesus came to change all that so second Adam came to give his life to give it more abundantly to give us peace that passes understanding to give us joy unspeakable full of Glory to give us victory over sin and death how many leaves he gave his victory over that hell in the grave you give us victory over all of that I believe it was in uh uh possessing all things y'all got to listen to that tape I heard things in there even after I preached it I heard things that you know you know because he he brother man talks about death he says you know death you know it serves us now we have power over it now it does what we tell it to do in other words all it can do is take us into the presence of God the unbeliever sure it takes out into

symptoms I'm gonna say God help me do not look at these lying symptoms but to you word father to look to you like Jonah did he looked to you that's the way we do we look to your promises not our symptoms and the way we feel or even our failed we don't look to that we look to the fear of the word father and we asked God this morning you'll bless every heart every hand Lord Jesus help us as a church not to be hooked on and not to be relying on and have our affections don't let us have our affections on it but set our affections on things above or Christ set us at the right hand of God or

remember this in the next few days Lord Jesus and help us Lord to realize that no matter what how successful we are in the world and we should be and want to be blessed in that way but we realize
