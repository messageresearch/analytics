[8:40] uh we just praise you and glorify in
[8:43] Jesus name amen y'all can be seated
[8:50] I I want to speak on uh what I just sung
[8:54] about
[8:56] Hung by the Tongue
[8:58] and uh
[8:59] let me explain that a little bit now
[9:02] you've you've all heard of a hangman's
[9:04] noose yeah well they hang a guy when he
[9:09] maybe killed somebody back years ago but
[9:11] this is a spiritual thing we're talking
[9:13] about tonight and uh
[9:16] in other words when you speak positive
[9:18] or when you speak negative
[9:21] uh it's like a hangman's noose it just
[9:23] keeps getting tighter
[9:25] until spiritually you you know ain't got
[9:28] no victory
[9:31] and you're you're just wondering what
[9:33] what's the matter with me
[9:35] well it could be right there inside of
[9:38] your mouth you know what a doctor does
[9:41] when he uh examines you first thing one
[9:43] of the first things he does he says
[9:46] stick out your tongue
[9:48] and they can tell a lot by just looking
[9:50] at your your tongue and uh they can tell
[9:55] about what's in your body
[9:58] and uh
[10:00] but notice when you begin to speak
[10:02] positive it's like getting loose from
[10:04] The Noose you you come out of that and
[10:07] you have Victory and that's what we're
[10:09] going to deal with tonight
[10:11] and uh brother Perry green told one time
[10:17] Beth Patrick
[10:21] praise the Lord you know it don't hurt
[10:23] to have a little drink
[10:25] of the right thing
[10:27] [Applause]
[10:30] as long as you're drinking the right
[10:31] stuff
[10:36] I know I know use a little wife without
[10:38] stomachs that is is good but it did say
[10:41] a whole lot it said a little
[10:46] and uh
[10:47] but Perry green was testifying how
[10:50] brother Brown talked to him one time and
[10:53] he said you know Perry
[10:56] he said 99 of people's problems is they
[11:00] either eat it or they say it
[11:02] and that's how I got that to start off
[11:04] my song or or in my song
[11:07] and uh
[11:09] so tonight what we want to do is uh look
[11:13] at some scriptures
[11:15] and let's go to Proverbs 18 7.
[11:19] I just want to back up what I'm saying
[11:21] before I really get into it
[11:32] a Fool's mouth is his destruction and
[11:36] his lips are the snare
[11:38] of his soul
[11:40] Proverbs 18 21.
[11:43] death and life are in the power of the
[11:47] tongue
[11:48] and they that love it shall eat the
[11:50] fruit thereof
[11:53] now job 6 and 24
[11:59] he said teach me and I will hold my
[12:02] tongue
[12:03] and cause me to understand wherein I
[12:06] have aired
[12:07] isn't that powerful
[12:10] oh my and Proverbs 21
[12:14] 23 and it would be good if you memorized
[12:17] this this scripture Proverbs 21 23.
[12:22] whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue
[12:25] keepeth his soul from
[12:28] what troubles
[12:32] a bunch of troubles
[12:36] you know
[12:39] the law of of our land
[12:43] uh the officer when he
[12:46] you know he puts handcuffs on the man
[12:49] and he says uh he says you have the
[12:51] right to remain silent
[12:54] for the words you speak
[12:57] can and will be held against you in a
[13:00] court of law
[13:02] now
[13:03] before I go on into this further
[13:07] let's think about God's word
[13:10] God's word that is conceived I want you
[13:13] to really grasp this God's word that is
[13:16] conceived in your heart
[13:18] then formed by the Tongue and spoken out
[13:21] of your mouth becomes a creative Force
[13:25] releasing the ability
[13:28] of God within you
[13:31] and a message the church age book
[13:33] brother by Adam said when a spirit-born
[13:36] Spirit-filled man in faith takes that
[13:39] word into his heart
[13:42] it takes it into his heart and he places
[13:45] it up on his lips while that is the same
[13:48] as deity speaking Every Mountain has to
[13:52] go Satan cannot stand before that man or
[13:56] that woman
[13:57] because she's a part of man
[14:00] amen
[14:01] praise God hallelujah I'm feeling better
[14:04] already
[14:05] as one preacher said I think I preached
[14:07] myself under a better frame of mind
[14:11] and you know that is where the battle
[14:14] goes on up here in the top story of man
[14:16] that's where he kind of gets shaky up
[14:19] there like the Empire State Building
[14:21] yeah yeah we'll get into that a little
[14:24] bit but anyway
[14:27] Matthew 12 36 why don't we just read
[14:30] Matthew 12.
[14:33] that way you'll get you'll get it all
[14:40] Matthew 12 36.
[14:44] 37
[14:47] . uh but I say unto you that Every Idle
[14:51] Word that man shall speak they shall
[14:53] give account thereof in the day of
[14:55] judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be
[14:59] justified and by thy words Thou shalt be
[15:03] condemned
[15:05] so an Idle Word is is it's not a it's
[15:08] not an effective word
[15:11] it's just idle
[15:13] you know
[15:14] now let me give you an example
[15:18] of being Hung by the Tongue or the Rope
[15:20] getting tighter
[15:21] you see what I'm saying uh I want to
[15:24] give you some examples this lady one
[15:26] time she stood up in church and she said
[15:28] I want everybody here to pray for me
[15:31] because I am taking the flu
[15:34] now did you notice
[15:36] for Words yeah yeah she says I am taking
[15:40] the flu in other words the devil offered
[15:42] it to her he knocked on the door and she
[15:44] opened it up and said well come on in
[15:46] have a glass of tea amen uh and so
[15:50] uh a man I remember years ago
[15:54] you know you pick up a lot of things as
[15:56] your years go by but I I remember I was
[15:58] Uptown one cold day and I was walking up
[16:01] there and I said how you doing that
[16:03] partner
[16:04] he said well he's one of these guys that
[16:07] just you know leans up against the the
[16:09] building smokes a cigarette and watches
[16:12] the cars go by
[16:13] and I said how you doing our partner he
[16:15] said well I'm just trying to take the
[16:17] flu
[16:20] I thought man here I am trying not to
[16:24] take it
[16:26] I mean it was cold you know and here he
[16:29] is says well I'm just trying to take flu
[16:31] now I thought I thought about that I
[16:34] went on up the road thinking about that
[16:37] I don't know I never did forget it
[16:39] though
[16:40] and uh
[16:44] my mother told me something else that I
[16:47] never forgot too she said that uh she
[16:49] know this lady had two sisters that had
[16:52] died with cancer
[16:55] and she told my mother said
[16:59] you know
[17:00] I've been to the doctor and I'm
[17:03] perfectly healthy
[17:04] said but I'm waiting any day for the
[17:08] doctor to tell me that I've got cancer
[17:10] too because they had it
[17:15] well here we go James 3 6 and the tongue
[17:19] is a fire
[17:21] a world of iniquity so is the tongue
[17:24] among our members that it defileth the
[17:26] whole body and setteth on fire the
[17:29] course of nature
[17:30] here it is
[17:32] amen and it is set on fire of hell
[17:37] think about that
[17:38] and in a message called the greatest
[17:40] battle ever fought brother Branham said
[17:43] listen it can better against you
[17:47] but it can't get to you until you accept
[17:50] it in the mind
[17:52] it's got to be first accepted in the
[17:54] mind
[17:59] the mind accepts it Eve stopped for a
[18:03] moment that's where Satan gets along
[18:05] people just just let me have just a
[18:07] moment
[18:08] and uh Satan walked right into that mine
[18:13] oh don't you stop for nothing
[18:16] you've got the message
[18:18] Jesus Lives God's a Healer that's the
[18:22] message don't stop for nothing no
[18:25] reasonings no nothing else Abraham never
[18:28] stopped for nothing for 25 years
[18:34] he confessed that God's word was true
[18:36] and he called those things which were
[18:39] not as though they were until the
[18:41] promise came to pass
[18:44] amen say how long do I have to keep
[18:46] saying it it's just keep saying it till
[18:49] you get better
[18:51] just say that that you are already
[18:53] better
[18:54] you're healed
[18:56] amen amen I've been believing God for
[19:00] several years for these fingers to get
[19:03] back to playing a guitar and I'm still
[19:05] believing
[19:06] amen I was kindly discouraged at one
[19:09] time sold all my guitars all my
[19:11] mandolins I saw
[19:13] and then God gave me enough courage to
[19:16] say hey
[19:17] fire straps I'm Healed I couldn't get
[19:20] that one finger down that far it was
[19:22] staying up there
[19:25] no
[19:27] I'm doing fine I'm Healed
[19:30] by Stripes I'm Healed I'm standing
[19:32] before you claiming my healing
[19:34] I've had all kind of healings take place
[19:36] in my life and I know you have too amen
[19:39] said don't stop for nothing and so
[19:44] an app
[19:45] till the promise came to pass or in
[19:47] second Corinthians 10 4 and 5 it says
[19:50] casting down imaginations our reasoning
[19:53] and every High thing that exalted itself
[19:55] against the knowledge of God and
[19:58] bringing into captivity every thought to
[20:01] The Obedience of Christ
[20:05] so you got a job to do God is not going
[20:08] to push you through a pie bring you out
[20:10] the other side and say blessed is he
[20:11] that overcoming you didn't have nothing
[20:13] over a car
[20:15] you got to do something
[20:19] he said God ain't gonna push you to a
[20:21] pipe and bring you out the other side
[20:24] um it's getting a little deeper in it
[20:26] that's the last way down
[20:29] I just feel good tonight amen
[20:33] amen now we need to be careful about
[20:37] that don't you agree that we need to be
[20:39] more careful about our words how many
[20:41] would agree just stay let's just lift
[20:43] your hand
[20:44] do you need to be more careful I do
[20:48] okay
[20:49] sometimes now listen to this sometimes
[20:53] we're careful
[20:55] about our words like when we're in a
[20:57] funeral home
[20:59] or a hospital
[21:01] or a courtroom
[21:03] you better be careful
[21:05] or sometimes when a cop stops
[21:09] stops
[21:11] and then you kind of do you kind of put
[21:14] on the ACT and say oh I'm so sorry
[21:16] here's my license I'm so sorry sir
[21:18] please forgive me
[21:20] I didn't mean to do that
[21:23] they said well I'm gonna let you buy
[21:24] this time
[21:26] but you don't do that no more you hear
[21:28] me
[21:30] yes sir yes sir
[21:32] you say how do you know people do that
[21:34] because I've done it
[21:37] I'm so sorry sir
[21:40] see we're good actors
[21:42] you know when we want to put on act we
[21:44] connect
[21:47] well might as well tell the truth God
[21:50] knows it
[21:51] didn't say that amen but why should we
[21:55] just be careful at the funeral home or
[21:57] the hospital or when a cop stops us or
[21:59] when we're in a courtroom why should we
[22:01] just be careful then
[22:03] why shouldn't we be careful all the time
[22:06] about our words
[22:10] [Music]
[22:13] amen
[22:14] you know I want to tell you something
[22:17] and the message call is your life worthy
[22:20] of the Gospel
[22:21] brother Byron said Jesus was not fussy
[22:25] Jesus was not Stewie Jesus just spoke
[22:29] the words of God
[22:31] every word that come forth from his lips
[22:34] was God's anointed word he was our
[22:38] example he said wouldn't it be wonderful
[22:40] if we could say every word that I speak
[22:43] God honors it
[22:46] every word I speak he's blessed
[22:51] amen amen
[22:54] and
[22:57] I want to say now this may the the
[22:59] things I'm fixing to say now may seem a
[23:02] little bit funny
[23:04] but sometimes you know brother Brown
[23:06] said sometimes I'll say something to
[23:08] make people laugh make them cry and make
[23:11] it make them angry
[23:13] but I'm trying to contact their spirit
[23:17] okay
[23:18] so I just want to read you some things
[23:21] that tightens up the Rope a little bit
[23:23] tighter okay
[23:25] people say well I think I'm going crazy
[23:29] I think I'm losing my mind this is goes
[23:34] on every day people
[23:35] yeah you know
[23:37] I think I'm I think I'm getting the flu
[23:39] the news says it's going around
[23:43] and I might lose my job
[23:46] I'm oh here's another one I'm getting so
[23:49] old and I feel so bad
[23:53] and nobody knows what I have to go
[23:55] through with
[23:58] the kids make me nervous
[24:00] and I don't know how we're going to make
[24:02] it
[24:03] and my head is busting
[24:06] okay
[24:07] I'm unworthy why does everything happen
[24:10] to me
[24:12] here's another one just people I hope I
[24:14] make it
[24:15] well hope never did I kind of hope never
[24:17] did make it Bible hope is earnest
[24:20] expectation you believe God regardless
[24:23] of circumstances regardless what you see
[24:26] taste filled smell here
[24:28] regardless of imaginations conscience
[24:30] memory reason and affection you go way
[24:33] down into the soul that word that's the
[24:36] real you
[24:38] amen and that Soul loved to be fed soul
[24:42] food
[24:43] amen
[24:44] and we got it
[24:47] now I'll tell you what Let's do let's go
[24:49] to another scripture Matthew 6 31. I
[24:52] want to show you something there
[24:57] I want to show you how we thank it and
[24:59] then we speak it
[25:03] Matthew 6 31
[25:06] and uh
[25:08] let's see here
[25:14] it's 31.
[25:16] therefore now this is Jesus therefore
[25:19] take no thought and watches watch what
[25:23] he said
[25:26] you notice that thought and saying or
[25:29] you first think it and then you speak it
[25:32] yeah
[25:33] Jesus he said therefore take no thoughts
[25:36] saying what shall we eat or what shall
[25:39] we drink or what shall we
[25:41] or wherewithal shall we be clothed
[25:45] for after all these things do the
[25:47] Gentiles seek
[25:50] uh for your heavenly father knoweth that
[25:53] you have need of all these things but
[25:55] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[25:58] righteousness and all these things
[26:00] shall be added unto you therefore take
[26:04] therefore no thought
[26:06] for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take
[26:08] thought for the things of itself
[26:09] sufficient under the day is the evil
[26:11] thereof
[26:13] so uh
[26:17] how
[26:19] I want to whine kind of wine this thing
[26:22] towards I think we're like a halfway
[26:25] point here but anyway how do I keep from
[26:28] being Hung by the Tongue
[26:33] well let's say it like this
[26:38] God took a Stony heart out of you didn't
[26:41] he
[26:43] he put a heart of Flesh in you
[26:47] and then what did he do he put a new
[26:49] spirit in your new heart
[26:52] and then he come and lived in your new
[26:56] spirit because the spirit you had you
[26:59] couldn't even get along with yourself
[27:01] Amen brother Brown said the old soul
[27:04] dies are the old nature
[27:07] and the new nature is born within you
[27:11] and you're in a memorial
[27:13] is that right
[27:17] now how so what happens is God comes in
[27:21] here and takes up residence and he
[27:24] becomes the mainspring that's what I'm
[27:26] trying to say that's the mainspring like
[27:29] in a watch if you don't have a
[27:31] mainspring in it it's not going to keep
[27:32] time
[27:34] you look at it and say hey this thing
[27:35] something wrong with this thing
[27:37] well
[27:38] something's wrong with you see
[27:43] you got to have that mainspring you
[27:46] gotta have that token
[27:50] before you can take it over your your
[27:53] family and all you got to have it first
[27:57] and then the Soul controls the spirit
[27:59] and the spirit controls the five senses
[28:02] of the flesh
[28:04] and then you're a different person
[28:06] all together
[28:07] now you know we all have our things that
[28:11] we go through every day like brother
[28:13] Brian said I have to repent every day of
[28:15] this and I have to repent I have to
[28:17] repent and he said and you have to too
[28:21] he says now as long as you're in this
[28:23] life you're going to be sticky
[28:25] and have a carnal nature that's going to
[28:27] bother you as long as you live but on
[28:29] the inside of you you are born again
[28:34] and Paul said I find in a law that when
[28:37] I would do good evil is present with me
[28:42] amen
[28:43] now let's go to do uh first Peter 3 10.
[28:55] first Peter 3 10 and and uh
[28:58] 11.
[29:03] for he that will love life and see good
[29:05] days let him refrain his tongue
[29:09] oh mercy from evil
[29:11] and his lips that they speak no gal
[29:15] let him assure evil and do good let him
[29:18] seek peace and ensue it
[29:21] the eyes of the Lord are upon are over
[29:24] the righteous and his ears are open unto
[29:26] their prayers but the face of the Lord
[29:28] is against them that do evil okay now
[29:31] Psalms 39 1 says I said I will take heed
[29:36] to my ways
[29:39] that I sin not with my tongue
[29:43] I will keep my mouth with a bridle while
[29:47] the wicked is before me that would do
[29:49] you a lot good right there you know when
[29:51] people fuss at you and cuss you and all
[29:54] this
[29:56] yeah
[29:57] the Bible said be still and know that
[30:00] I'm God
[30:02] brother Brown said
[30:04] you can't do nothing to a child of God
[30:07] and get by with it
[30:11] you know what think about that let them
[30:13] go ahead
[30:14] say what they want to
[30:17] is that right
[30:19] now Psalms 19 14 let the words of my
[30:24] mouth
[30:25] now this was David's prayer and the
[30:27] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[30:29] thy sight of the Lord my strength and my
[30:31] redeemer
[30:37] sometimes I don't know how to pray have
[30:39] you ever been that way
[30:41] and I'll just start with Matthew the
[30:43] first chapter and I'll say
[30:45] the book of the generation of Jesus
[30:47] Christ the son of David the son of
[30:49] Abraham Abraham beget Isaac Isaac beget
[30:51] Jacob
[30:52] and so on then I can think well what's
[30:55] some more scriptures brother Graham said
[30:57] just take those scriptures into your car
[30:59] and mine and repeat them
[31:01] how do you overcome this thing up here
[31:03] by taking the scriptures into your
[31:05] carnal mind and repeat them and what's
[31:08] he doing is generating power
[31:11] he's got to go when it's turning over
[31:14] and over like it is repeating it free
[31:16] all right now now Psalms 141 verse 3
[31:21] said a watch O Lord before my mouth and
[31:24] keep the door of my lips
[31:28] Psalms 119 172 my tongue
[31:33] shall speak Thy word for all thy
[31:36] Commandments are righteousness
[31:40] I once read about a man that was in his
[31:43] 90s brother Thomas
[31:45] and uh
[31:47] they wanted to testify before the church
[31:49] and he said he said you can see that
[31:52] I've got all my hair
[31:55] and he said God showed me as a young man
[31:59] how to keep my heart
[32:01] and he said I got all my teeth and my
[32:05] vision and my strength
[32:07] and he said God showed me how to keep
[32:09] all that
[32:10] said one the first thing he taught me
[32:13] was how to keep my tongue
[32:19] and by keeping my tongue I could keep
[32:21] all the rest of it
[32:23] well it worked for him
[32:29] amen
[32:31] let's go back to proverbs
[32:35] proverbs 18.
[32:38] oh I just love the word don't you
[32:40] man
[32:42] proverbs
[32:47] I know it's in here I pray to God
[32:54] proverbs
[32:56] hmm
[32:59] well Proverbs 18 20.
[33:02] I'm not over here a man's belly
[33:06] a man's belly shall be satisfied with
[33:09] the fruit of his mouth
[33:11] that's the words that you speak you see
[33:15] and with the increase of his lips shall
[33:18] he be
[33:19] filled
[33:21] now you're going to be full of something
[33:24] that's right the prophet said you're
[33:25] going to be full of foolishness or
[33:27] you're going to be full of Pride are you
[33:28] going to be full of something
[33:29] why not be full of God
[33:31] [Music]
[33:33] amen now
[33:36] now
[33:37] I just want to show you something here
[33:40] a man's belly or his innermost being the
[33:44] real you
[33:45] shall be satisfied with the fruit of his
[33:47] mouth in other words the words you speak
[33:49] you speak God's word your own ear hears
[33:52] it
[33:53] you notice that when you speak it
[33:55] verbally out your ear hears it
[33:59] it goes down inside of you it comes back
[34:02] out next time bigger
[34:05] yeah
[34:06] and just like the man that went out and
[34:08] caught a 10 inch out
[34:11] he'd come back home and he was one of
[34:13] those fishermen had stretch the truth in
[34:15] other words he lied
[34:16] and uh
[34:19] he got talking about this trout and he
[34:21] said you know that was a 12 incher
[34:24] and he liked it he heard it
[34:27] and the next time he told that story he
[34:30] said oh it was a 14 incher
[34:32] well it kept on growing until finally it
[34:35] was 18 inches long
[34:37] he said sure enough it was 18 inches
[34:39] long
[34:40] see he heard what he was speaking and it
[34:43] sounded good to him I want to get
[34:46] something
[34:47] and that's the way gossip is
[34:51] if you hear gospel and don't repeat it
[34:53] it dies as far as you're concerned
[34:57] but if you repeat it one time you heard
[35:00] it
[35:01] you heard it
[35:05] and the next time it come out
[35:08] bigger and tonic got in this ear and
[35:11] that ear and out of here and that it was
[35:13] a lie
[35:15] usually
[35:19] sad in it
[35:21] I wrote a book on Gossip one time it was
[35:23] called uh what do AIDS and gossip have
[35:26] in common it's out of print now that I
[35:28] didn't make any money because I've never
[35:30] made any money
[35:31] I wrote three or four books I've never
[35:34] made anything I just wanted to do it
[35:38] but they're all out of print then I
[35:43] I made about 26 albums well I'm not I'm
[35:46] not bragging on God and I and I've never
[35:49] made anything
[35:51] the only money I ever made brother
[35:52] Thomas was when I was five years old
[35:56] let me go back to when I was there now
[35:59] and mother my mother she wanted me to
[36:01] sing so she sung and she wanted me to
[36:03] sing and she had company over at night
[36:07] and she said I want you to get up and
[36:09] sing for these people I said no I don't
[36:12] want to do that
[36:13] why I
[36:15] was afraid
[36:17] and that man that was the company he
[36:18] said I'll tell you what I'll do
[36:21] this was 1950 he said I tell you what
[36:23] I'll do
[36:25] he said if you'll just sang a little bit
[36:26] for me said I'll give you a nickel
[36:31] I thought about it and I thought about
[36:32] the candy store
[36:35] because that was a lot of money back
[36:36] then to me
[36:38] I said all right
[36:40] you got a deal
[36:42] and so I sung and I got we got my nickel
[36:44] buddy I was so happy
[36:47] it's the only money I ever made training
[36:51] but I ain't worried about money
[36:54] you know hey man God supplies my needs
[36:58] amen I usually I've sold seed eating
[37:01] cassette but I usually end up giving
[37:03] them away
[37:04] I mean once you use for them to let them
[37:06] lay around the house why not just give
[37:08] them away
[37:12] and you know God's blessed me for it
[37:15] and I didn't do it for a show I don't do
[37:17] things like that for a show
[37:20] I do it to be a blessing to God's
[37:22] children
[37:23] amen
[37:25] now I hope I'm not taking too long is
[37:28] can I can I say a little bit more
[37:30] tonight okay
[37:32] uh
[37:35] back years ago I several years ago when
[37:38] I was a boy growing up I had a a fear of
[37:42] swallowing when I've eaten
[37:44] I had a fear
[37:46] and I would try to eat and try to get it
[37:50] down without choking
[37:52] and it didn't bother me all the time but
[37:55] just once in a while it would hit me
[37:57] and
[37:59] I thought man
[38:01] and so I started studying on faith about
[38:03] these things
[38:05] and I spoke my own deliverance we was at
[38:08] the cat Morrison's Cafeteria
[38:10] and uh and it was when I was eating I
[38:13] just looked at my wife and I said I
[38:15] don't have that fear of swallowing any
[38:18] more
[38:19] and immediately it left me just like
[38:22] that now I ain't had it since you say
[38:24] did it come back and knock
[38:26] yeah but I didn't open the door
[38:29] I said no no thank you
[38:33] go somewhere else I don't want to who
[38:35] were you amen so my wrist hurt me for
[38:41] two solid weeks and I praised God for
[38:44] two solid weeks this was when I was
[38:46] painting houses you know and I'd get the
[38:49] high stuff she'd get the low
[38:50] because you know she dressed to dress
[38:54] amen and I think a lot of people in the
[38:57] message now thinks it's all right to to
[38:59] just uh dress this anyway
[39:04] that shows that that's a pitiful thing
[39:07] it shows they don't have a real true
[39:09] Revelation from God
[39:10] amen but so much for that anyway I
[39:15] praised God for two solid weeks off and
[39:18] on you know it just hurt me and finally
[39:20] after two weeks it quit hurting it went
[39:23] all the way
[39:24] amen praise the Lord amen
[39:28] and uh I remember when I I was I was
[39:32] working on the clock you know working
[39:34] punching the clock and I was making a
[39:36] living
[39:37] but I I really I really wasn't happy
[39:41] working on the third shift and oh man
[39:45] and so somebody promised me a paint job
[39:48] for 500 said
[39:49] and I'd have stepped out by faith I said
[39:52] I'll take it and I went to church that
[39:55] Saturday and I said I'm covered up with
[39:57] paint jobs
[39:58] I said I got more than I can ever do
[40:01] and you know about two weeks I was
[40:03] covered and slapped under
[40:05] people started finding out how good we
[40:07] painted you know and that we went in
[40:09] there and done a good job a neat job and
[40:12] cared for their furniture and all
[40:13] covered it up and taped off this and
[40:16] that and the other
[40:17] and
[40:18] I mean we we didn't have to go around
[40:21] advertising
[40:23] all you had to do was go into the
[40:24] neighborhood and paint one house that's
[40:26] it
[40:27] I got buddies I got friends they got
[40:31] relatives
[40:32] amen okay now
[40:37] I remember Sister Anne she had a knot on
[40:39] her
[40:40] hand one time and
[40:42] she said would you pray for it I said
[40:44] sure put a little bit of oil on it
[40:46] prayed a little prayer I forgot about it
[40:48] she forgot about it and we're the week's
[40:51] time that night they've been there for
[40:52] years was gone
[40:55] amen
[40:56] amen
[40:58] amen and uh I remember I was trying to
[41:01] teach my mother Faith one time and she
[41:04] was catching it pretty good and I
[41:06] happened to sneeze and I said no
[41:09] she said boy you just flatly refused
[41:12] that didn't you and that's it's kind of
[41:14] funny you know the way it happened
[41:17] and uh
[41:18] hey man let's go to James 1 26. I've got
[41:21] a few more things
[41:22] here
[41:36] chance 126.
[41:39] If any man among you seemed to be
[41:43] religious
[41:44] and broadleth not his tongue but
[41:47] deceiveth his own heart
[41:49] this man's religion is vain
[41:53] hmm let's read the other one pure
[41:55] religion and undefiled before God and
[41:57] the father is this to visit the
[41:59] fatherless and widows in their
[42:00] afflictions and to keep himself
[42:02] unspotted from the world Amen
[42:05] so
[42:07] uh
[42:13] blessings are transformed from the mouth
[42:17] and curses are too
[42:20] that's right that's scripture James 3
[42:22] 10. let's go over there James 3 10.
[42:27] out of the same mouth perceives blessing
[42:30] and cursing my bread and these things
[42:33] ought not so to be that's what he's
[42:35] talking about is not cussing he's
[42:37] talking about putting curses on people
[42:41] well you know they they've come up to
[42:43] the altar uh
[42:45] every time a new evangelist comes in
[42:47] they come up to Alder and they got
[42:48] re-saved again
[42:51] and you just watching David they've come
[42:54] to the altar but watch them give them
[42:55] two weeks and sure enough in two weeks
[42:58] they're back out there again well there
[43:00] was probably the problem uh the cause of
[43:02] it a lot of it because of the words are
[43:04] speaking against that person
[43:07] you got to be careful how you talking
[43:09] you don't
[43:10] got to be careful when you talk against
[43:14] brother Brown said
[43:17] you want this one talking about the
[43:20] thoughts of the pastor talking about the
[43:23] faults of this one talking about the
[43:25] faults of that one said if we would talk
[43:28] more about Jesus we would see more
[43:31] appearing of Jesus
[43:33] right and here here was Jesus in the
[43:36] bushes you know in those two disciples
[43:38] on the road to Emmaus and he was back
[43:40] there and they were just talking oh just
[43:43] oh man this Jesus we don't know what to
[43:46] do
[43:48] he come out and started walking with him
[43:49] he said what are y'all talking about
[43:51] I'll put it in today's language hey let
[43:53] me in on it
[43:55] they said don't you are you just a
[43:57] stranger here and you don't know what's
[43:59] happened and their eyes was blinded to
[44:02] Jesus
[44:04] and was blinded until he's done
[44:06] something inside when they got him
[44:08] inside and broke bread and give thanks
[44:11] their eyes were opened and he vanished
[44:13] out of their side
[44:15] but you see you notice now it was when
[44:19] they were talking about him
[44:21] that he appeared
[44:24] and he the prophet said that's our
[44:26] problem we just don't talk enough about
[44:28] Jesus here
[44:30] exactly
[44:32] amen
[44:36] well
[44:39] we're getting down to the last page and
[44:40] I really want you to really get into
[44:42] this and now okay you ready okay all
[44:45] right let's go to Ephesians now wait a
[44:48] minute uh
[44:51] yeah let's go to the fishing side yeah
[44:56] yeah y'all just making me so happy
[44:58] tonight
[45:03] amen praise God hallelujah
[45:06] Hallelujah ah Ephesians 5 18 and 19.
[45:13] and be not drunk with wine we're in his
[45:16] excess but be filled with the spirit now
[45:18] he's going to tell you how to be filled
[45:20] with the spirit brother Sean he's going
[45:22] to tell you right here
[45:24] in the next verse
[45:27] speaking what
[45:30] to yourselves you may talk to myself
[45:35] speaking to yourselves in Psalms and
[45:37] hymns and spiritual songs singing and
[45:40] making melody in your heart to the Lord
[45:42] giving thanks always for all things unto
[45:46] God and the father in the name of our
[45:48] Lord Jesus Christ
[45:49] submitting yourselves one to another
[45:53] uh in the fear of the Lord
[45:55] fear of God Amen
[45:58] so we uh
[46:01] you know there was a
[46:03] they asked this kind of preacher one
[46:05] time said Moses why are you always
[46:07] talking to yourself
[46:10] he said well
[46:12] he said I likes to talk to a smart man
[46:16] and said I like to hear a smart man talk
[46:21] and then this preacher friend of mine he
[46:24] came over to where I used to work in
[46:26] Furniture he'd come over to where I was
[46:27] at we'd talk about the Lord and he said
[46:29] he said I was over there talking myself
[46:31] and about the Lord and they said
[46:33] preacher why are you always talking he
[46:34] said
[46:35] and he just finally bluntly said well I
[46:38] like to talk to somebody that's got some
[46:39] sense
[46:40] so there you go so we know who's got the
[46:43] sense that the Lord Jesus
[46:46] now we need to watch our tongue most
[46:48] people there's more people have been
[46:50] slain by the Tongue than by the sword
[46:55] amen the tongue is the most dangerous
[46:58] weapon in the world
[47:02] man
[47:06] thank you let's go to Isaiah 5 14 Isaiah
[47:10] 14.
[47:16] foreign
[47:22] 14 24 now this I really want you to
[47:26] really get a hold of this
[47:28] Isaiah
[47:31] 14 24.
[47:34] the Lord of hosts hath sworn saying
[47:38] surely as I have thought
[47:41] so shall it come to pass and as I have
[47:44] purposed so shall it stand
[47:49] now let's go back to Psalms 17.
[47:55] 3 and 4.
[47:59] psalm 17.
[48:11] thou has proved Mine Heart thou has
[48:14] visited me in the night thou has tried
[48:16] me and shalt find nothing
[48:19] I am purposed
[48:22] that my mouth shall not transgress
[48:28] [Music]
[48:30] the word purpose means to come to a
[48:33] conclusion
[48:34] and have a made-up mind
[48:38] I want you to think about that let's say
[48:41] it together come to a conclusion and
[48:44] have a made-up mind
[48:47] because notice an experts concerning the
[48:50] works of men by the word of thy lips I
[48:54] have kept me from the past of the
[48:57] Destroyer

[49:06] now you can have what you say tonight
[49:11] good
[49:13] or I mean uh bad or good
[49:18] yeah I'm gonna put that on the left

[49:26] side you know
[49:28] after
[49:30] amen you know I was thinking about that
[49:33] one day Oral Roberts group come this way
[49:35] to be prayed for
[49:37] the band's come this way
[49:40] Billy Graham's come this way
[49:43] I thought well it may not mean nothing
[49:45] to you but it was just something in my
[49:47] heart
[49:49] that was the angel Lord had come to him
[49:51] not them
[49:53] that's true
[49:56] amen
[49:58] you can have what you say good or bad so
[50:01] don't become hung by the Tongue now
[50:05] uh
[50:11] I just want to read you something right
[50:13] here and and I'll try not to be too
[50:15] lengthy that there is a I found this
[50:19] that uh one of careers leading
[50:22] neurosurgeons said that the speech nerve
[50:25] center in the brain has total dominion
[50:28] over all your nerves
[50:31] the speech center and the Brain
[50:35] the speech center has such power over
[50:38] all the body that can simply by speaking
[50:43] can give one control over his own body
[50:47] to manipulate it in the way he wishes
[50:50] of course God knew that before the
[50:53] foundation world now if anyone says I
[50:57] have no ability I can't do the job I've
[51:00] never had nothing and I never will have
[51:02] nothing then right away all the nerves
[51:04] begin to declare the same thing yes they
[51:08] respond we received instructions from
[51:10] our central nervous system saying that
[51:13] we have no abilities and we are to give
[51:16] up striving to develop any potential
[51:18] capacity we must prepare ourselves to be
[51:22] part of an incapable person
[51:26] uh-huh
[51:28] someone says well I'm so very old and
[51:31] I'm tired and I can't do anything then
[51:33] right away the speech control center
[51:36] reacts by giving out orders to your
[51:39] nerves
[51:40] the effect the nervous responds yes you
[51:44] are old you see the nursing but yes
[51:46] you're old well you are ready for the
[51:50] grave
[51:51] [Laughter]
[51:54] let's be let's be ready to disintegrate
[51:57] so the nerve says because he has already
[52:00] spoken
[52:01] someone keeps saying he's old then that
[52:04] person is soon going to die
[52:10] once a man retires he keeps saying to
[52:13] himself I am retired
[52:15] then all the nerves start responding and
[52:18] they begin less act they begin to be
[52:20] less active as they
[52:22] as they prepare a quicker death
[52:28] man I want to stay busy doing something
[52:30] reading the word of God praying digging
[52:33] with a hoe or something
[52:34] yeah be busy exercise
[52:38] well I I'll get up in the morning I
[52:40] exercise drink me a protein shake and
[52:43] if I have to stand still and run I'll
[52:45] just stand still and run
[52:50] I mean sometimes it's raining like
[52:52] everything outside just walk through the
[52:55] house we do everything
[53:00] and then that you know the people say
[53:02] I'm not looking for anything to change
[53:07] the reason they haven't received the
[53:11] reverse instructions from their nervous
[53:12] system yet see remember the speech nerve
[53:16] center in the brain has total dominion
[53:18] over all the other nerves Therefore your
[53:21] body believes every word you say and
[53:23] response to it
[53:25] hmm
[53:27] if you want to change for the better
[53:29] change your language
[53:33] we can learn this new language from the
[53:37] best language book of all the Bible read
[53:40] the Bible from Genesis to Revelation
[53:42] hide God's word in your heart like the
[53:44] psalmist David said Thy word have I hid
[53:46] in mine heart that I might not sin
[53:48] against thee
[53:51] I learned that in the Army when I was 17
[53:53] years old that was one of the scriptures
[53:55] I'd learned
[53:57] and one of the scriptures I Learned was
[53:59] Philippians 4 13 I can do all things
[54:02] through Christ which strengthens me
[54:05] and my buddy that was he you know he was
[54:09] more spiritual than me and I was just a
[54:11] young
[54:12] baby Christian and I I was having it
[54:14] rough one day he said man and he was
[54:16] from up North you know and speaking that
[54:18] real though he says well here's here's
[54:21] what you got to do
[54:22] he says Hall here's what you got to do
[54:25] Philippians 4 13 said his way he said I
[54:29] can do all things through Christ which
[54:31] strengtheneth me he was speaking that
[54:32] Northern language you know I never did
[54:34] forget it I said yeah you're right that
[54:36] that's right and
[54:37] and he brought me out of that about
[54:39] every time he'd bring up that scripture
[54:43] amen
[54:46] okay just a little more here as you
[54:49] acquired a Bible language and speak
[54:51] God's word in faith you actually are
[54:54] feeding the central nervous system
[54:57] with a vocabulary a productive and
[55:00] Victorious words
[55:02] learn to speak those words and keep
[55:04] repeating them so that they will have
[55:06] complete control over your whole body
[55:09] praise God hallelujah
[55:12] amen
[55:14] well
[55:15] I got two more scriptures and they
[55:18] really need to be read okay
[55:20] let's go to Isaiah 57 19.
[55:28] you know I've tried to tell people that
[55:30] their problem was their tongue and they
[55:32] can't seem to get it
[55:36] foreign
[55:37] but I try anyway
[55:41] because I had a lot of problem with my
[55:43] tongue when I was growing up
[55:45] and I don't know why my my cousin he
[55:47] told my boy she said you just don't know
[55:50] your daddy said when he was a boy he was
[55:52] mean as the devil
[55:54] I thought man how could he say that
[55:56] about me because I wasn't that mean
[55:59] but
[56:01] one of my Center buddies said man
[56:04] why don't you quit cussing like you do
[56:06] said
[56:08] you know I wasn't living for God he said
[56:11] what is people going to think about you
[56:13] I said do I cuss like you he said you
[56:16] sure do
[56:18] I say oh
[56:19] but I didn't realize it
[56:22] I didn't realize it and uh
[56:26] uh I remember hitchhiking to California
[56:28] when I was 16 I was going to see my
[56:30] uncle out there and go to work with him
[56:32] in construction
[56:33] and I wasn't living for the Lord and I
[56:36] could I was stuck in Texas brother
[56:38] Thomas I was stuck I could not get a
[56:40] ride
[56:41] and a storm was coming up
[56:44] and I began to bargain with God
[56:48] and I seen an 18-wheeler coming
[56:51] and I said God
[56:53] if you will let that truck stop and pick
[56:55] me up
[56:57] I said I promise you I'll quit cussing
[57:00] and I'll go to church and I'll be a good
[57:02] boy
[57:03] I see I was bargaining with god well the
[57:06] truck did stop
[57:08] and as when I got in the door it started
[57:11] raining and when I got inside the door
[57:13] boom it all come down
[57:17] and I woke up and I said can I get up
[57:19] here in the bed and sleep he said get up
[57:20] there so I woke up to Albuquerque New
[57:23] Mexico and he was he'd give me his bed
[57:25] he was down there sleeping in the seat
[57:26] he'd give me his bed
[57:29] and when I got to California my uncle
[57:31] had moved back to Seattle Washington and
[57:34] you know what happened to me don't you I
[57:37] broke my promise
[57:42] I was going to go out there brother
[57:44] Thomas and surprise him
[57:46] and say here I am I'm ready to go to
[57:49] work in your big construction company
[57:51] and he surprised me
[57:54] I went to the cops and I said Hey
[57:56] where's my uncle at he said oh he moved
[57:58] us back to Seattle about two weeks ago I
[58:02] said oh no oh man so they put me in a
[58:05] foster home and I had a mom and daddy
[58:07] for about you know three months
[58:09] I said I want to go back home
[58:12] so they sent me back anyway
[58:15] that wasn't our message but anyway
[58:18] yeah it was too so Isaiah 57 19.
[58:24] notice how he says this
[58:27] I create the fruit of the lips now this
[58:30] is God speaking through Isaiah I promise
[58:33] you I'm gonna let you out in about 10
[58:36] minutes and I'm not going to be like
[58:37] some preachers that says I'll let you
[58:40] out in 10 minutes and I'll let they let
[58:42] you out in two hours
[58:43] angle do you like it
[58:47] I was in a I was in a convention one
[58:49] time and the preacher got up and he said
[58:52] now look
[58:53] if you go to sleep don't worry about it
[58:55] when you wake up I'll still be preaching
[59:01] okay
[59:04] okay Isaiah 57 19 this is God saying I
[59:09] create the fruit of the lips in other
[59:11] words I bring to pass what people talk
[59:13] about
[59:16] peace peace to him that is far off and
[59:18] to him that is near saith the Lord and I
[59:21] will heal him
[59:24] God is saying I bring to pass what you
[59:27] talk about
[59:30] one more scripture Psalms 34.

[1:01:51] and I had numbness in this finger she's
[1:01:52] two fingers

[1:01:56] years later it was still there
[1:02:00] and I was going to preach for a brother
