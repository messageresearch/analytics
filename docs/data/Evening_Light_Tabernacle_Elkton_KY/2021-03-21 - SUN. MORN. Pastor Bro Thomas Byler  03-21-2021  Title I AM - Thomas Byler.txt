amen this morning amen found a really good husband i was really happy for her you know when i found out he was a drum player i was just a little happier yet i didn't even know that till this morning

can't think of any announcements i think i both told brother steve and then we're going to watch things for the next month uh this will be april coming up so the first of may and then we'll make some changes maybe if there's been no code cases the next if until then amen we'll try to get back to a little bit more normal see would that be all right amen just uh so praise the lord amen let's just bow our heads kind heavenly father we come before you this morning now lord thankful once again to be assembled together lord jesus and father you had something in mind when he was here on earth and you said whatever two or three are gathered in your name there you would be in our midst lord and we believe father you had us in mind lord jesus knowing god that we would gather lord and and father that you would come into our midst lord jesus you love free people to gather together to worship you in spirit and in truth lord and we realize that is the way to worship father lord this morning early when i first woke up lord there's just some thoughts that you begin to bring into my mind and they just begin to pour over and i do truly believe the lord that it was just your spirit lord leading me and guiding me father and i just pray god that you'll have your way father this morning now and everything that is said and done and if we ask god for you to help me lord jesus get out of the way for we know that's the true gift of god is to be able for the servant to get out of the way and just to let you have your way let the holy spirit freely speak the things that you once said lord bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart gathering together in the effort of each one that has been made lord to come into your house lord and those that are still out we pray that they'll come lord jesus won't have to be out but they'll be able to assemble also lord with us father and we just ask god your blessing now in jesus christ's name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will and i'm just going to go straight to the scriptures amen and this is actually something i'm going to try to try to do perhaps in the future because the lord will begin to pour out scriptures and and speak to me in his word and so forth and then trying to just lay out which scriptures to read first and try to lay it out amen i this morning we're going to try to just pretty much follow uh the way that the spirit gave it amen and see how that works out for us would that be okay amen and so saint john if you will this is the scripture that was um that came to me amen st john 14. amen this is one of the first times i've got three different pages same and usually my sermon is all on one page but this morning we have three so i don't know what that means but anyway maybe not too much but we'll hope that the lord just have his way amen the other thing is in matthew yeah there it is in matthew so we'll go read saint john uh 14 let not your hearts be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house or many mansions and if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also and whether i go you know in the way you know thomas saith unto him lord we know not whether thou go us and how can we know the way jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen may god that is blessing to those scriptures turn off you will also are going to one more over in matthew 7. these were the main scriptures that come to my mind as i begin amen to get my message this morning matthew 7 and verse 13 13 and 13 through 15. enter ye in at the straight gate for white is the gate and broad is the way that lead us to destruction and many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there be that find it may god have his blessings you can be seated this morning amen amen this morning's title amen i'm going to read i think another scripture but my title this morning is i am the i am amen i am we know that here jesus is declaring something that of course it may be a big controversy to a lot of people in the world and that is to say that what we the way we might put it when we read verse 6 he said i am the way we might put it this way he is the only way amen if he is the way then truly he is the only way amen how many knows that puts a lot of religions out a lot of beliefs out puts everything else out he is the only way now reading the scriptures about enter yin at the straight gate for broad is the way that leads to where destruction so we have a wide way a range a wide range of ways in that right but every other way leads to destruction amen and so really what we're dealing with this morning is the one main thing we're dealing with of course is finding the way amen to the father or to eternal life is that right to eternal life which has to do and that's why this morning service and of course all services but this especially when we gather together today we realize that it is our gathering together is more important what we're doing this morning is more significant more important than anything that you will do in your life and then right coming to church and hearing the word of god is more important than anything you'll ever do i don't care if you would become a multi-billionaire it will mean absolutely nothing zero because the bible says that our lives are like a vapor isn't that right which appeareth for a while and then it is gone i wanted to try to find a spray can brother peter amen that i could come up here and just spray and we could see that vapor all right and then just watch it disappear and totally be gone and that is each and every one of our life here on earth but how many knows that's not talking about eternal life that is gonna be that way and truly is that way if you don't find the way. amen because we know that's not true when you have eternal life in that right it is only talking about this flesh and not really even talking about just his flesh amen being the vapor and vanishing away if you find the way because how many knows that this flesh will be changed all right right and you become nothing but ashes when god calls you your redeemed body back amen brother bam says those saints that were burnt the ones that were eat by lions god will call their bodies back amen but they'll call that same chemicals and so forth back and he'll change those chemicals isn't that right into a glorified body it won't be a carnal body anymore but to to resurrect something is not to put one thing down and get something else up resurrection means to bring back up exactly what was put down but in a glorified state that's according to paul in ii corinthians it is sown a corruptable body but it is raised a incorruptable body amen and it's an immortal and so this morning i love this because we're talking about each and every one of our souls which is what we're really concerned about man and we're so grateful amen we're to have so to know that we have the way amen praise god amen what was it called it was called the seed shall not be air no it was called the uh possessing the gates of the enemy amen uh i think that's what it was yesterday i was listening to him probably god he was talking how that um um okay well anyway i forgot my thought that's what happens when you go down a certain path the lord will bring it back is that all right all right okay so anyway all right so anyway let's go back here and start over here without my mind amen getting older our mind is like a vapor too you know after a while it just kind of goes away amen it's hard to believe though i mean you know i think about you know already be almost 60 years old and how how brother troy just a few days ago i remember you over at your dad's place there riding that little four wheeler up and down that lane you know and and here we are just just like that it seems like isn't that right here we are up in the world we're now the old folks amen it is a little hard for anybody to say but that's what you are amen yeah you know you're beginning to be an old folks you know i remember a few people tell me they were 60 and they they thought it was old to be 50 and that then it wasn't so bad you know it was bad to be 60 and and people were telling me that and i thought boy 60 years old but yeah i find myself about there amen i think that upset about him 54 or so and he called himself an old man at that age but how many knows life is a vapor folks it goes so fast it's such a short time frame but amen to have to know that we have a god that we have a way we have the way amen i know what it was it was brother branham who was talking about how that he says you know we're you should listen to that because he talks about he says we're so thankful that today you don't have to wonder what's truth anymore you don't have to wonder what's right anymore jesus has come and he has proved himself he manages that message that that would say they said that he meant to know that you know that you know amen that he would go the jesus christ in front of muhammad and buddhas and and seeks the chains and all of them and 500 000 people amen the prophet of god says if your god can come and open this blind man's eyes i will serve your god he said it was a quiet bunch you know i don't know how i was here where he says in africa how did he he said that one discernment he says one miracle what was done and he said 25 000 and 30 000 raw evens gave their lives to the lord jesus christ amen because of what that discernment because of the sign amen because of the vindication and he says here in america it really doesn't mean all that much but for them to realize to have a god that can be proven amen that could be showed alive and they believed and they grasped but and even 25 000 me healings he talked about that took place in durban and how did they have to have truckloads upon truckloads of and then uh to scots and stretchers to haul all of their you know their things that they were coming in on a minute to know that we have this morning praise be to god not a well maybe we're right huh how many knows you can't have your soul resting on maybe i'm right maybe this is the way amen and you we all know that that there's a lot of different ways out there amen but we're thankful this morning amen to have the way and that we're serving the one and only true god the only one god how many believe there's really only one god every other god is false just like every other way is false it leads to destruction every other truth that they call truth is not the truth amen and also the life he is all three of those and over in genesis i believe it is in exodus 3 and verse 13 god told moses he said moses god moses said unto god you all when i come down to the children of israel they shall say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me let me read this again and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is thy name what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said shout out thou say unto the children of israel i am has sent me unto you amen so god declares that he is the i am amen that means that he alone is god jesus saying here no man comes to the father but by me in other words you'll never get to god unless you go through me praise be to god how many knows it's the only way if through jesus christ it is through god there is no other way because there is no other god god alone has eternal life he is the only one that is eternal amen i want to talk to you for a few minutes here basing our thought on what a god is first of all we know that a god is supposed to be immortal now right immortal he's supposed to be eternal right he's supposed to be eternal he's supposed to be all powerful he's supposed to be all knowing and he's supposed to be ever present or all present other words for that is omniscient all-knowing omnipotent for all power and omnipresent for all present amen i hope you're ready this morning because we're going to have a good service i am and i know you are too amen there's no no no telling just how far we can climb this morning because when you talk about god hello when you begin to talk about god you got something to talk about you got something to praise about you got you got something how many bees we got something to talk about amen so let's talk about him in chapter 44 of isaiah verse 6 he says thus saith the lord become the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last amen praise god i am the beginning i am the ending i am the alpha i am the amiga i mean that all the things that the i am is i am it's a beginning i am it's the ending i am that i am i always am i always want i always will be he's eternal the only way that you will ever be eternal the only way you'll ever be like a god or an amateur god is to have immortal life also and there's only one immortality and that is in christ jesus god is the only one that has eternal life this morning all right now notice he's not just the i am but he's also the first he is the last he which was and who is and which is to come calm down you know him huh you got him in your heart huh the one that was the one that is the one always will be you got him in your heart you're a part of him just calm down don't run the aisles amen that alone is enough to excite us that alone is enough to thrill your soul to the utmost i am the first i am the last and besides me there is a few other gods you ain't reading with me but you know better than that you must be his sheep my sheep know my voice and the strangers they will not follow amen think about this he says and besides me there is no eternal one no omniscient one no omnipotent one and then i'm the only god there really is when i think about our god that we determined this morning before there was a floor for me to stand on before there was an earth for me to stand on he already was and i know better than to try to take my mind back before anything was and how far back he goes because you can't go that far back you can't think that far you'll blow your mind amen he just was do you understand it no better stephen i don't understand how jesus always was how long was he before he made the earth don't ask yourself such stupid questions you might get a fuse blowed because you're trying to put him in a time frame and you can't do it even the prophet god said you'll never understand it god just ask you to believe it that's all he's asking he was kind enough to prove to you that he is through the message of the hour he was kind enough to come and show us the way amen i mean it was this way wasn't didn't come out of pentecostals this way didn't come out of baptist or methodist or amish or mennonite or schwarzenegger or or beachy ambush men tonight or horse and buggy men tonight or however he didn't come out of any of that it came separate from all of that and he called them out of all of their ways and said this is the way leave that trash and come here leave your lodges and come here here is the truth here is the way that's what he did called inner denominational the prophet of god was they may call to all of them but can you imagine how any one of those churches if god would have done a brought a prophet out of those and sanctioned that how proud they would have been we're the ones right no they were all wrong there's only one right and that's the word of god amen there's only one truth there's only one way not that not many of them amen if you choose to you can try to go some other way climb up some other way but you'll be disappointed before we talk about that let's talk about finish this year first of all besides me there is no and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since i appointed the ancient people all right and the things that are coming i mean we serve a god that knows what's coming he ain't surprised he knows exactly what's coming he appoints what's coming he tells you what's coming oh my can you imagine the day of judgment you'll say look i told you what was coming why didn't you look at what was coming anybody smart wants to get ready for what's coming prepares themselves for what's coming they already know that god knows all things we not even wrote the whole book of revelation he talked about what the end of the world would be like the fire that's going to consume everything he talked about a thousand year millennial reign already he talked about a white throne judgment do you think an atheist is going to stop that by saying no there is no god no all of their unbelief will never stop god amen never has stopped it never will amen and the things that are coming and shall come let them show unto them fear ye not neither be afraid have not i told thee from that time and have declared it even our ye are even my witnesses is there a god beside me yay there is no god i know not any praise be to god he didn't know amen he says i don't know any other god there's no one that's immortal that's all powerful we know the devil is nothing but a bluff he is a false god amen now you can make things your gods huh because even but even god talked about don't you fall down and worship the gods of egypt people have other gods what they call gods but they're not really a god those wooden images and all that that's not really a god that's not going to deliver them and can't forgive their sin it can't give them joy it can't give them happiness it can't give them redemption it can't give him eternal life nothing else can and you can worship an idol you can make your house your car your wife your children your family you can make that your god and if you put it before god it is your god i mean it was anything you put in front of god it's an idol and it's your god it's what you worship amen how many knows it's so so important that the one thing we get in our hearts and that no matter what god is first in our lives because if he isn't then he hasn't got the rightful place amen so to serve a god that always was always will be amen now let me go one more talk a little more in talking about god first the other thing that we would think and i said to myself i was studying this that says god cannot be killed a god cannot die huh but i found that's not really right and yet it is [Laughter] have i got your mind going because how many knows all right i'll just read it to you revelations 1 and 18 says i am he that liveth and was dead huh i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death i don't know about you but i like to be on the side of the guy that's got the keys of death and hell i want to be on his side don't you so a god we would think that he could not die he could not be killed so i was back then my study and i was thinking he can't beat you something says well he wasn't killed they didn't kill him they didn't kill him well they did no not really because remember jesus said no man taketh my life he says i laid it down in other words if he wouldn't want him to do what they did they had never done it they only did what he allowed him to do but it wasn't wasn't like hey we're going to get we're going to kill this guy and get rid of him we're going to murder him we're going to surprise him no they didn't surprise him they didn't murder him huh god allowed he led him he said let me make this clear no man taketh my life from me i am the one that's laying it down oh my and i thought you know [Music] what really makes him god what really makes him god is to be able to die and then he says i have the power to lay down and i have the power to take it back up again now that's a god no matter how many times you would kill him peter he would just get back up no matter how many times he allowed you to kill him he'd get right back up now that's a god let's give him a hand said thank you amen praise the lord he says i was dead but behold i am alive forevermore and have the keys of hell and of death now if you that god ain't worth serving then what is that's a god worth serving that can lay down his life and he's got the power to raise it back up again amen now how many knows that in our bodies our bodies are very temporal it can be killed but the real you and we've heard the phrase the immortal soul isn't that right our souls are immortal in other words they're not mortal your soul is not mortal your soul is spiritual when this body dies does your soul no why because it's immortal amen has immortal life but that don't mean it has eternal life right but that soul will keep on living it's spirit form spirit form and that right that's what god made a living soul amen and the bible talks about until judgment i mean it was until judgment that soul will live it'll have it'll it'll it has immortal life but the bible says the soul that sinneth it shall surely die the second death that soul will that immortal immortality so to speak will eventually die unless your soul receives eternal how many wants that say that's what i'm looking for that's what i'm striving for is for that eternal life amen praise be to god amen in that same message brother bram said something i really like the only quote that i have this morning he makes a statement he says this is 31 years i've been preaching and i would not trade this life if there wasn't any heaven to go to at the end if there wasn't any jesus to see i have more joy living this way in one day than i would with 10 years the other way if there wasn't nothing after this that's really from my heart as your brother and god's servant he said there is such a peace and a satisfaction amen remember a couple weeks of recall we preached on dissatisfied people and satisfaction and so forth because how many knows that has such a bearing in our lives whether or not we're satisfied whether there's joy whether you have joy and happiness and satisfaction in your life has a great big bearing because all those people out there that you see hello and truly they're beginning to look like the africans they're in the jungle we're all looking like jungle bunnies and jungle people huh things hanging in here and the nose rings and all that you know and tattoos everywhere it's a really crazy world we're getting into and all they're trying to do is find some satisfaction find some happiness find some joy there actually brother bam says they're so dismantle they're reaching for something and they can't never get it they don't never get it i'll be honest with you if i wasn't here this morning and if i didn't know god it ain't no telling what i'd look like i'm not beyond putting the error vote yes i am i don't care if i was a sinner i wouldn't do it thoughts on that i don't know about tattoos but you don't know how far you go i wouldn't know how far i'd go would we what we do because you all know i was crazy when i was out in the world anyway crazy stuff and so you know think about where you would be where i would be how what i would look like the tattoos probably and everything else hello because i never got any satisfaction but thank god i've still got my eyeballs like they're supposed to be and my nose no rings in it and satisfied because of him because i found the way to have joy the way they have peace and brother branham was saying look at the peace look at that look how that you can let me finish your quote lay down in your bed and just you know that's really from my heart as your brother and god's servant there's such a peace and a satisfaction knowing that when you lay down if you never wake up again what difference does it make amen i hope everybody here can lay down in their beds and sleep at night and know that hey if an airplane falls out of the sky and hits your house you're ready to go that's all right huh no matter what happens you have such a peace if we can actually get if we can get this kind of peace this kind of happiness brother bram says even if there's nothing do it this is how i want to be i am quiet for a few minutes because i want you to soak in and find out whether you're there or not i want you to look at your heart and your life and see whether you're there or not that you've obtained such happiness such joy such peace until even if there was no having to go to i'd still want to be like this this is how i want to live because i can sleep i can be happy because this peace is real this joy is real god is real amen praise the lord there's an anchor that holds within the veil somewhere amen out there and there's something that tells us there's something good on the other side amen all right i am the way the truth and the life amen in john 10 it says verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door and to the sheepfold but climb it up some other way the same is a thief and a robber amen but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out i say that in that way because i as i read that i think about how that the lord by name thomas thomas where are you pinecraft sarasota thomas thomas where are you i begin to thirst in my heart i said there's got to be more to van halen and ac dc and rock and roll and dope and everything got to be more to life than this got to be something greater it's got to be something better i mean i begin to thirst for god i begin to search for god i realized later after god saved me that it was him calling amen no man comes to the father but by me and nobody can come to me except my father draw him i realize how he's being drawn god calls he'll calls you by name if god don't call you by name if god doesn't tug on you yeah every church service will be a bore do we gotta do that again do we gotta do that oh it'll be a bar and no matter how much you try to be a christian and pretend that you're a christian unless uh god gets ahold of you that's all you'll ever be doing is pretending to be a christian trying to be a christian and you're not really that on the inside you fight that it find that it's a constant battle all the time now it's important that we go by the way how many knows you've got to go by the way what is the way straight is the gate narrow is the way amen you got to come in by the door there's one door to come into and jesus says i am the door to the sheepfold how many knows he is the door i am the way i am the door to the sheepfold if you try to go in some other way amen you're going to be disappointed how many beliefs he said he who the son sets free is free indeed i mean you'll never find true freedom all those other religions that are trying to find freedom they'll never be able to achieve it like the prophet said as long as you're entrusting you baptist church methodist church any of your church if you're trusting in your church for your salvation you are lost but if you're trusting in jesus christ you're saved amen the devil offers many substitute ways many other ways to enter in and amen until i'll tell you what people are so pretty prone i am prone you are prone if you really search your life it meant to be and take our own way amen there's only one true way that's his way praise be to god people tried everything people try to get to heaven in every imaginable way you can imagine how about during over the philippines i think it is how that during uh easter and so forth the different ones that go beating themselves on their back you know and you know whipping themselves and bleeding and everything else and trying to die to themselves i don't care how deep you cut yourself i don't care how much misery you put to yourself through you did it for absolutely zero nothing didn't do one bit of good for your sins the only way to do any good is to believe and accept the strikes that were put on his back except how he suffered for you that's the only way that you'll ever get it no other way no other truth no other life if you want joe ma this is going to be good if you truly want the joy of the lord you'll never get it until you get it his way you want peace that passes understanding you don't get it the way you want to get it you got to come the way he says for you to get it it's only through him that you have peace with god justification amen i'm so glad for that oh my i like that that meant a lot to me he calleth his own sheep by name i could just dwell on that for a while if god ever calls you god ever saves you you become a child of god i do not believe that there's enough devils out of hell that can never deviate you from that they get you to be lost because he says no man can pluck them out of my all the father has given me will come to me and i will lose a none of them i like i like that because it's not counting on me my word is his word he won't no man can pluck him out of my hand know how we could go on go ahead try to burn them at the stake alive what torture what cruel torture to be burnt alive but thousands of our brothers and sisters were burnt alive isn't that right fed to lions and they just wouldn't give it up they would not recant why because there's something in there that is an anchor how many is glad to have that anchor in your life there's not enough hypocrites in the church to make you quit there's not enough people that claim to be christians and aren't really they may cause you to stumble and no it won't never never not you doesn't matter well the preacher's a hypocrite that won't even stumble you'll keep right on going even if he is not a real crowd amen the same way vice versa amen well i'm not a christian because so and so no no no if you ever really anchor you'll get through that you'll come out on the other side you'll be all right god will take you through because if you're taking yourself through yeah you're gonna be gone but if he's taking you through that's a whole different story that's right keep your seat for that just relax don't get too excited praise be to god oh my all right and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice how many believe that that's if i'm preaching the truth that's what you're following am i right that's what you're following it's the truth that's being proved because if i didn't preach the truth you wouldn't be following it you wouldn't be following i wouldn't follow and unless it's the truth it's got to be the truth it's got to be the way amen all right and the sheep follow him for they know his voice that's why i say whenever i read my bible i know it was the truth i know that i believe that bible is the truth i don't believe it predicts itself if it contradicts itself if it contradicts itself and i think it contradicts itself you know what i do sister becky i tell myself thomas your mind ain't right i tell myself you're the ones confident you don't understand something about it because i believe that way before i believe it contradicts itself amen i'll tell myself self you need to straighten up because that ain't i believe that that's guys i'm hanging my soul on it my eternal destination on it amen and when we heard the prophet's message play a tape play a tape and see and let's listen to that voice if you're a sheep you'll pick it up you'll know that that sounds right that's the truth no denomination is going to save you no organizations they're a big bunch of prostitutes that's right the bible says said the mother of harlots mother had a bunch of prostitutes amen they claim to be married to christ and go around there go uptown stand out there inside of them churches whenever they go and find out if them women ain't got mini skirts half up their leg and they make any man lust after him huh preacher ain't never preaching again saying no he wants to stay there because the deacon board will the board trust these everybody throw him out if you don't if he preaches that's up hello claiming to be christ and then not obey his word jesus says why do you call me lord and then don't do what i tell you to do and paul says let anybody that's spiritual acknowledge that the things that we write unto you are the commandments of the lord amen and the way you dress and the way you do your hair and everything else amen they're all the commandments of the lord because god had chosen paul to be his servant to write most of the new testament amen praise the lord all right praise the lord this morning so we got to come his way straight is the gate and narrow is the way prophet taught us and i didn't pick this up before but he said s-t-r-a-i-t is a strait or a waterway right it's a waterway amen and they're even singing a song about the waterway is the way today buried in the precious name of jesus young and old repent of all your sins amen and jesus will truly come and enter in but listen straight is the gate narrow is the way by the way the water and the blood now the water don't save you but still re go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved the water day acts 2 38 repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the holy ghost the promise is to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord are god shall call now in brother branham's time there was everybody was preaching that the days of miracles has passed and the holy ghost was only for those apostles and disciples there is no holy ghost anymore and the prophet says guys show you where god put it in there you show me where he took it out it's for you for you for your children to them that are false even as many as the lord our god shall call how many believes the holy ghost is for today not just for yesterday they're trying to get you to amen and the nicean council i believe is three hundred years after the death of christ amen 19 they had a council and they instituted the baptism amen to be the father the son and the holy ghost we got this here going everywhere doesn't mean a thing except it's the wrong way amen that's the wrong way there's one there's only one name given under heaven whereby you must be saved and that is the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and the name of the father and the son of the holy ghost is the lord jesus christ amen try to get in some other way hey maybe in the days gone by when we were ignorant didn't know better god winked in our ignorance but he doesn't today not one person was ever about in the titles of father son and the holy ghost in the bible not a one why would you want to be why would you want to dive into a pond that's never been proven huh nobody ever did it yet you think you can get in there and climb up some other way no there is many of them that's climbing other ways hello praise be to god praise be to god people are trying to get peace in their hearts some other way they're trying to get salvation some other way [Music] but what did jesus say what was some of the things that he said that if you come my way then there the way is kind of narrow it's kind of a tight path here okay and that path first of all he says if you love father mother brother sister wife or children huh if you love the pleasures of this world if you love money if you love anything else more than you love me don't expect to get in pretty tight path and you know it gets tighter than that yeah it gets tighter than that because after that he says yeah and he that doesn't take up his cross and follow me and he that hateth not his own life also i like that thank you jesus you let us know that we can't just forsake everybody else we gotta forsake our own way we gotta forsake our own life you gotta forget your own thoughts you gotta die to your own self if you wanna follow him or you're not gonna make it in pretty tight straight narrow path oh my i could do like that preacher amen that preached on repentance for two months and the congregation says peach when are you gonna quit preaching on repentance and and he said well let everybody repent and then we'll go somewhere else hallelujah or help us this morning that we might forget everything else and say god i don't want to live my own life i don't want to think my own thoughts i want to get there not just talk about a beer about it or let me get to the place to where i truly am dead to my own self dead to my own thoughts straight to my own ways into my own life because that's the only way that you're ever gonna get real joy the baptism of the holy ghost amen that'll bring it here and it'll be so hard so heavy on youtube a little quick in your immortal body hey man it'll take a 80 year old man i mean they're making me take his shoes together and say hallelujah ain't got enough room for me to preach up here that's what the holy ghost will do the holy ghost is alive in you amen it does something for you when you really go the right path when you're really going the right way when you go that narrow path here i am lord i want my wife to go with me i want my children to go with me i want my wife my mom and my dad oh i want them to go with me but if they refuse to follow they'll have to go without them hello if they refuse to go the right path i will take the right path anyway amen even if my wife even if my husband won't go down the right path i'm gonna take the right path i'm gonna do what i know is right amen no matter whether they do not wow we want everybody to go but jesus says i didn't come to bring peace but i kind of said it variance mother-in-law daughter-in-law brother-in-law you know family members against each other bring a very certain portion if they're not followed they don't come down to this path like where you do amen then i'll go over by myself and that's what jesus said it's a straight path amen you begin to forfeit your rights hallelujah forfeit your right how many know you got to forfeit your right well i got to write to this and i got oh you ain't got it right you get shaved like a sheep amen let the buzzer of the holy ghost come and just take that wool off of you amen shave all of your rights away you got a right to follow him you gotta like to let him go in front of you and in front of you and clear the path for you to supply for you amen you have a right to seek the kingdom of god first and all these other things will be added unto you folks i wonder sometimes if we aren't adding and making sure that we've got everything added to us and then lord whatever i've got left i'm going to give you huh that's right thomas pyler can get so busy until last night at eight o'clock i said honey i've had so many appointments today we've had to be here and be there and be here and be there and here it is eight o'clock and i haven't given god nothing i haven't given god time to study like i should and pray like i should i'm sorry huh it's so easy to let other things come first isn't that right get so busy until we don't have time to pray till we don't have time to say god that all i just want you to know that i love you is all in my heart but even though i was that way i says i know lord i believe i have confidence you'll give me what i need in the morning amen i was tired folks i don't know about you but it's hard to study when you're sleepy and very tired but thanks to your prayers hello and the will of god i'm going to be your prayers and the will of god god will give us something he'll have us some food in them right in the morning god is good at cooking up some good dinner for us amen praise be to god so when i think about god when i think about me he is the i am that everything that was created was created by him without him there was not anything made that was made oh when i think about how he made your breath oh my he made your voice he made everything that you are he gave us everything and then we get more excited about some things other things more then we get excited about him huh oh i don't know about you but you know how this when you're playing volleyball you get up there yeah you got it you gotta get spikey yeah huh i can do that but how about when you come to the house of god god save my soul hallelujah praise be to god huh you ought to be a little more excited in the house of god than it is out there that's exactly right because you think that you are serving a god that has saved you that has made you immortal not only immortal but he has created in you and made you a part of himself and that from a million years from now you'll still be saying amazing queen the sound that saved a wretch like me oh i'm telling you right now i'm gonna bellow down through those echoes of those mountains and those valleys and it's gonna rebound hallelujah hallelujah hello and i'm gonna hear a sound back somewhere that's right he's gonna go back and we're gonna pray god through the eons of time amen because he didn't work at us because we found the path we found the way we found the truth we found the life oh my by the grace of god there's no other way but him only by the holy ghost how many knows him he is the holy ghost oh my he is the holy spirit he is the pillar of fire he came down and he divided himself up on the day of patton and pentecost in his church [Music] no there is no deliverance without him there is no unshackling your feet unshackling those chains of sin that binds you there's no unshackling don't even make a big step because you're shackled so tight by condemnation so shackled up till the word of god you can't even squeeze out a amen so so tightened up by the cares of this life that it's choked out your love and life for the lord we ought to be we ought to be crying we ought to be walking the house raising our heads saying thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you lord thank you for what you have done in my heart thank you for what you have done in my life you are a god because you're the only one that can set free yeah i am the deliverer of israel and besides me there is no god there is no deliverer there is no savior i mean believe he's the only savior there is nobody else can save you nothing else can save you nothing else can deliver you nothing else can set you free what did brother bram say about us americans he says man we say we're free we are not free we're bound by the cares of life and everything else we're so bogged down with everything we're not free amen lord help thomas byler because i listen to where brother brahm says you know those church ages amen they would all hunker down and the churches would be gets cold and formal and die god help us this morning not to get formal not let it get something that you get used to something that becomes common to you don't let it become common to you because if it's becoming common to you it's because you're getting further away from it i thank god i'd rather write that every time i get away from god i get formal i get this out of the other there's something that pulls me something that said no you can't do that don't you die on me brother amen don't you die you'll get back quick eating my tabernacle don't you die on me i love you too much don't you let the devil sniff out your life well i used to praise god i use the hallelujah church but i don't anymore i'm scared for you i used to say amen hallelujah but i don't anymore because your ways have gotten into it you have gotten in the way of it i don't preach like i used to because i got my ways in it huh if i don't then it's because i need a little more dying i need to find the lord's way instead of trying to do it my way i mean believes that this morning god hates a formal cold starchy religion powerless no power no power no victory in their life no peace in their life i guarantee you if these kids get happy how many knows they have a way of expressing it i guarantee you if you have joy in your heart you have joy in your life you're gonna expect it hey man there's something in there but if you don't have joy you don't have peace then you're not going to express it i believe we ought to be worshiping god like never before amen didn't jesus say you know they were worshiping to the woman at the well would they worship here they worship there he says in the mountain but he says you know the day is going to come that they're not going to worship here but they're not going to worship there but they're going to worship in spirit and in truth that's what they're going to worship when they hear the truth [Music] praise be to god oh my brother brother you get a little loud till you get over there it's gonna sound like thunder like the voice of mighty mighty host of people we're not gonna be quiet over there no we're gonna worship god we're gonna praise him let everything that has breath praise the lord i will enter his gates with the frown on my face no i will enter his gate with thanksgiving in my heart this is the day this is the day that the lord hath made we will be sad we will be sad in it no we will be glad in it hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come let us rejoice to be glad because why we serve a god that is immortal that is eternal he is not was but he is the i am and he is here right now where is he where's god two hands come on folks where is he that's right that's right that's where he is i love it when you get the revelation that's where he is because the god that delivers now the god that sets free he is now in your heart amen he uses your vessel to bring deliverance to your neighbor you bring deliverance to your chapter to bring me deliverance to the milkman the mailman to your workers to your jaws perhaps he brings deliverance that's why amen brother irvin we've gotten away from bringing deliverance to the people telling people about how the day can be free amen and god has sent us a message this hour to set people free we're part of that body how many knows even god used the prophet of god so much that he could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart so much until he thought that he was the messiah that was a pardon brother brown says that's part of the body work we may not be the eyes that do that but we all have a part how many knows we all have a part you may be the fingers you may be the toes you may do this or do something but do something for god and man you got a talent use it for god whatever that talent is be a part of the body hallelujah i would look if i just had to preach like this all the time praise be to god no i can leave my hands praise be to god and i'm back from my hands i'm glad for my feet to convey me back from my eyes thankful and that's the way the goddess he is now in you and he is in me to bring deliverance salvation joy and peace if our neighbors can't say they're what church do you go to what do you believe because if they see something that because i want what you got danny let the young people say i don't know what you got that's exactly the words my brother moani but i led him to the lord years ago and moses he says i don't know what you got but whatever it is i want it kind of a blind statement but he sue i knew i had something it's what i had amen that's the way it should be with her wife with her husband huh that's where it starts the husband see it in the wife the wife should be able to husband honey i don't know exactly what you got what you've been praying how close you are but what you have that's what i want john michael you should be able to say dad i want what you got i want god i want you god help me believe that why because if that delivers that salvation that peace that joy the happiness they see it in everything you do every choice that you make every word that you say every conversation that you have they listen they either want what you got or they don't really want what you got and that is we then become the true reflectors of this eternal god because he is in us he is in this us and we should come together brothers and sisters amen to praise be to praise god when we come to church like this we assemble ourselves together let's remember we come to worship him in spirit and in truth we enter those gates with thanksgiving in my heart we come the bible says that we are deadly stones [Applause] i believe the christians should have a smile they should have joy in their hearts i got wrote down here when you come to the lord and come to church amen and come remember there's no room for wows you wow as you would's [Laughter] what does the song say learn to smile through your tears amen because god is really worthy we sometimes think i think sometimes that we're not sufficiently impressed with the god that we serve he's awesome god he can answer every prayer that you have he says whatsoever things you desire when you ask believe it and you shall receive it that's the kind of god that we serve and i'm thankful to be serving the god that always was that he is and he will be [Music] most churches are lutherans wesleyans pentecost men of simon huh so forth but the one thing about our prophet is remember his picture he didn't point us to the prophet he pointed us to christ amen how am i glad that you have a relationship with jesus christ through the prophet in this hour through the word of god you have a relationship with him and you're not just serving some god of the past but we're serving the god of right now amen stand with me this morning if you will musicians can come if you'd like i'm thankful that he said i am a very present help in time of trouble with our head spout i want to ask you something have you obtained that which you have striven for have you received that which you have asked for did the door open when you knocked did you find what you were seeking for because if the answer is no then i want to say to you perhaps you're not going about it the right way because jesus said he was the door and he said ask and it shall be given unto you he says seek and ye he shall find he said if you'll knock it shall be opened unto you i wonder this morning if we all raise our hands see i really need a closer walk with my lord god bless you god bless you now lord jesus we come before you lord jesus my hand certainly is up lord i pray god that along with me that you help me to die to my way to the way that i want to think to the way that i want to act lord i want to die and let my mind never have be able to think thoughts that it's not supposed to think my mouth and it won't say things it shouldn't say my heart that it wouldn't take anything that he wasn't supposed to take in lord but father that your perfect way would always be in front of me lord and also each and every one that has raised their hand i pray god if they have asked if they have knocked if they have sought and have not received and are not in the place that they should be with you this morning i pray god that as they raise their hand and say god lord i want a closer walk with you father and i pray god that you'll open my eyes and show me the way lord help me to be sensitive enough to know lord that your holy spirit is able to speak to our hearts and to show us hey this is the area that's keeping you from me and lord we know that that's a lot of different places for everybody here this morning different areas different things but we need your spirit to show us god where we're still in the way where we're still thinking our thoughts but we're still having our ways lord and we're not getting in we're not getting satisfaction we're not getting joy we're not getting peace because we're going about it the wrong way god show us lord each and every one of us father and or this coming week we pledge to you god that we will make changes in our life lord jesus the changes that you show us that we need to make we will make god we will begin to say god i pray lord don't let me keep walking down my path don't let me keep going my way living my life but let me die to myself also so that i have a right to come in to you and to suck with you and you with me i play in the name of jesus christ this morning every heart lord will be sensitive to you lord so god different ones while they're driving on the way home perhaps they will meditate upon this what you have talked to us about this morning and say god i want you to reveal to me father how i can walk closer to you lord [Music] now lord we come before you humbly asking god that you'll search our hearts lord see if there be any of our ways in there lord draw us ever closer to you and most of all this morning we want to thank you that you're such an awesome god that we can come and say god we are sorry for our failures and for our sins and for our shortcomings and we ask god that you'd watch every sin right now father of each and every person that knows they've done wrong in one way or the other god that they'll raise their hand say god i have not done the right thing i lord i am not where i should be father whatever it might be but put those sins in the sea of your forgetfulness just now as we approach your throne god make us clean make us a make us to be a temple god that that's fit for the holy ghost to live in lord jesus we ask god that you do it just now forgive every sin lord that's here represent it and put it in the sea of your forgetfulness may we go from here being able to shake each other's hands so to have genuine love for that's the one thing we have a right to do and that's the love of everybody oh god and to be sweet to be kind and gentle to be forgiving and lord jesus as you have forgiven us those who transgress against us we forgive them lord lord we don't have an ought and we don't have a right to have a against nobody for lord if we don't forgive everybody of their sins neither will you forgive us of ours and we ask god that you forgive us as we forgive others and as we want to have everything right with you and lord jesus truly as the sun is getting right around outside and as it begins to get warmer and beautiful outside i pray god that that very same thing would take place this morning in every heart that you would begin to get brighter lord and that there would be a real real warmth in each and every one of our hearts for you and for one another may we love one another this coming year like never before father we might bind together to each other and pray for one another and to know god that when we pray about something sooner or later you answer our prayers god and we thank you lord jesus we thank you for this time that we've had together lord and we want to see a couple songs to you lord before we go father just to worship you to admire you to think about your father how great you are we ask this in jesus name and amen
