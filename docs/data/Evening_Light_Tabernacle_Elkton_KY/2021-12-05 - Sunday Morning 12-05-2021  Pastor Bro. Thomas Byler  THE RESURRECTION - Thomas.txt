========================================

me [Music] [Music] um foreign so [Music] uh foreign wow okay yeah morning brothers and sisters uh i'll just ask my dad to start start us off in prayer all right let's read uh psalms 90 starting with the first one yeah you could all stand oh and also uh children dismissed [Music] lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations melatonous man to destruction and says return you children of men thou carries them away as with the flood they are as asleep in the morning they are like grass which growth up for we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath we are troubled for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told you know what the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrath return o lord how long and let it repent thee concerning thy servants make us glad according to the days where and now has afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil and let the beauty of the lord our god be upon us and establish thou work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands established yeah i can remember being a young man one time and coming up to a pulpit brothers and sisters it isn't an easy thing so the first couple of times are hard to get through but after that god gives you grace if you would turn with me to ecclesiastes the third chapter i was uh in that song there was a lot lots of nuggets in that song you know as you know we're about to finish this year 2021 going into 2022 and i was just sitting there thought come to me you know you know if you historically if you read our country's histories in the 1920s our country went into a period of great lawlessness you know all kinds of longestness going on in the country in the 1920s and most of us there's very few people probably alive today that would even would walk in the earth you know as young men in the 20s or 30s during that period of time and you look you know history just repeats itself time and time and time again it just people can't you know people are people they're just manifest who they are and we're in our own country we see loudness again in our in the same time frame 100 years later so you can't get away from the fact that human beings are human beings they're going to manifest what they are and without law and order that manifestation gets worse and worse and worse and uh i was just thinking i was i'll jump over to isaiah i was just thinking this morning that best way to say it is you can't say it anymore you know you can't be surprised anymore about the things that go on around you what goes on in the church or on in the world because like i said before people are people and it's like the brothers have been preaching it we're well past manifestation time people are starting to reveal you're seeing whether it's in the message of the hour whether it's in our country your communities people are they can't surprise you anymore because they're just manifest you know manifesting what out of their heart what they really are does will that change should that change you that shouldn't change whatever people do out i'm will it shake your confidence will it will it hurt your feelings we're all human beings people that we've walked this way with or well i don't i'm only 62 years old some people are a lot older than me you've walked this way for 20 or 30 years with people and you see people turning away should it change your confidence and knowing that you're following the truth it shouldn't bother you at all it should make you strive more to stay on the path but i'll just read you know they read the first 10 verses a lot of times at funeral but i'm going to start at about the 10th first and this is what you know this is thousands of years ago you know and just like proverbs or ecclesiastes or psalms you know god's truth are eternal and it goes back i hate to say it again but it goes back to human nature and human beings they're constantly going to do the same they might have more technology or less technology but they're still going to do the same things if that if that wicked seed is in them and they haven't confessed jesus christ as their lord and savior they're just going to keep on doing wicked things i'll just read from the 10th verse it says i've seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of man to be exercised in it he has made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart so no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end i know that there is no good in them for but for man to rejoice and to do good in his life you know that's everyone's desire everyone should desire to do good and enjoy your life no matter what's going on around you also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of his labor it is the gift of god you know sometimes work ain't an easy thing but it's something that god gives you to provide for yourself and your family and through that you should enjoy the fruits of your labor that's not an evil thing but it goes on to say also every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all the slavers it is the gift of god i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be for it shall be forever nothing can be put to it for anything taken from it god do with it that men should fear before him you know the this whole chapter here is just letting you know that it's god's providence everything we do as human beings whether you're a christian or not it's in god's hands it's in his providence and it should give you comfort to know that god cares enough about you the steer your life to take you in a direction that you need to go and he goes on i'm i hate to i keep doing this all the time i keep re reading the same scriptures again and the 15th verse that which has been that which hath been is now and that which is to be has already been and god requireth which is path moreover i saw under the sun a place of judgment that wickedness was there in the place of righteousness that iniquity was there and in my heart god shall judge the righteous and the wicked for her time for every purpose for every work and i said in my heart concerning the estates of the sons of man that god might manifest them that they might see that they themselves are beast for that which befalleth the sons of man befalleth beast even one thing befalleth them as one dieth so diet the other yea they all have one breath so that a man has no preeminence above the beast for all as many so basically solomon's saying here he doesn't whether you're righteous or wicked don't make a difference we all have that appointment one day unless your raps are out of here and you're all going to meet that in one day whether you're a beast or a man everyone goes to that appointed time in their lives and the only thing we can do like this psalm is saying is committed to god and in and enjoy the life that god's given you and he goes on to say i'll go on to one place all our deaths and all will turn to dust again who knoweth the spirit of man that goes upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth wherefore i perceive that there is nothing better than a man should rejoice in his own words for that is that is his portion for who shall bring to see excuse me my pronunciation here who shall bring to him to see what you'll be after him you know i i'm not trying to be funny here but all of you know that you get around people that you work with eight or ten hours a day and all they do is complain nothing is good enough for them you can't do you can't do them right enough it just don't you know there's just those kind of people and while i read that i'm not trying to be funny here but you those people come to your mind no matter what they do that's not good enough for them they're not thankful for anything that they get in life that's not the kind of spirit that a christian should have and i'm gonna jump up here to isaiah the 59th chapter here not i know i get get in a hurry sometimes but i was thinking um this is i was reading that book uh that brother green had this morning i meant to bring him with me but uh i told you nether i know there's something i forgot at the house when we got here but in that book i was reading that page and this is that chapter that deals with and whatever you see out there in the world or in the church this i'll read i'll jump to this to this 19th verse i know you're going to have a hard time following me but no matter what goes on out there if you're god's child and he's got his hands over your life he's going to raise the standard for you for the age that you live in but i'll just read this verse and then i'll jump back to the first verse he goes according to their deeds according accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries or replicants to his enemies to the island she will repay replicants so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west in his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up the standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion and on to them that turned from transgressions in jacob saith the lord so that's what you know he was talking brother green was talking about how brother bradham used that scripture a lot and you know we're several years past that time but god has a standard and got to raise everything up so that you can be successful for the age that you live and don't ever let the circumstances in your life or the circumstances out there ever affect your relationship god will raise you up in the age that you live in that's a promise and the world's goal and the enemy's goal is to get you to not look at that promise and to cloud your eyes are over so that you don't see that promise that god has for you and he goes on to say here and the redeemer shall come to zion unto them and turn from trying to aggression and jacob saith the lord for as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the lord from hence and forever you know that really is important for us this morning i was going to read some more scriptures but i'll just stop at this point and the age that we live in there's two important things you have to have the spirit of christ abiding in your heart and life and that spirit will bring you into fellowship with god's word without those two things we're lost without the message of the hour the revelation that we're living in the spirit of christ in you that's the only hope we have this morning as human beings is that we're we're holding to god's word for the age that we live in and that's the standard that god will raise in your hearts and lives so you're successful in the day that we're living brother david all my hope is in jesus this morning all my hope is in jesus oh thank god my yesterday's gone and all my sins [Music] [Music] amen aren't you thankful this morning and all my hope is in jesus name thank god for my

to say god bless you sister mildred amen and then she shared with me a testimony a little bit this morning of what god done for her so sometimes she said maybe not today but sometimes maybe she'll be able to share it amen we all like testimonies don't we amen so we're glad for what god said sister angie just good to see you all again and man we know every service is kind of unique isn't it just a little bit a little bit different and so but uh i wouldn't i would speak a little bit with the help of the lord and i want to i'm going to do things first we want to talk about brother tommy amen we're thankful to have brother tommy aren't we amen because i'll tell you what uh you know what he went through and and and the trial basically that has been sent to brother tommy and tammy uh it's a pretty big one amen and i'm telling you it's just a grace of god uh you know that he's sitting there this morning amen and so you know last night i was listening to brother branham preaching on that i believe it was an adoption and it was on it was funny kind of how i had thought about that quote and then and he mentions it while i was listening to him he says he was talking about how that you know how do you know that by the time you get home you know you're not you're going to find out that your loved one's not even alive anymore you know and he went to great detail to tell you how do you know you're ever going to leave here you know you don't know you know the many are preachers how do i know that i won't fall dead you know or whatever it is we have no promise of the next five minutes isn't that right and so that's how fragile this life is how uncertain this life is amen amen and so but we're so thankful for what god has done for brother tommy and amen and sparing him the grace of god spared him and we've got him with him and and we're so glad for that he's going to give us a testimony but i mean i want to give an update first of all uh you know i want to read sister tammy's uh testimony and and uh a little update that she gave amen amen and so she says it this way and i'll tell you what i mean i really appreciate sister tammy i'll tell you what i know she's a real wife amen she's a real good woman amen for brother tommy he could be thankful even to have somebody like sister tammy man so we appreciate her too amen we appreciate both of them amen and i'll tell you brother tommy's been a real friend to me amen and i appreciate his friends yet i'm glad to have him around amen and so a pastor sometimes doesn't get to have friends because amen it's just you know it's touchy situation amen and and you have to be able to know your pastor's fault and still have confidence him amen and and so forth and so we appreciate amy and all of you but i want to just read an update that she gave and then she says she just wanted to give a little update on tommy we are taking one day at a time amen and that's pretty much where it is and trusting in the lord for his ultimate healing we want to thank each and every one of you for your continued prayers and his next cat scan will be in january so please continue to pray and believe with us that the specialists won't be able to find a torn aorta but a perfectly strong and healthy one amen how many people believe for that yes sir amen i know that scientists and doctors and all that they may have negative things to say but that was one something else the prophet said you know during that time he says you know no matter what the doctor tells you you've got a higher power you've got the great physician that doesn't mean anything amen it's what god says amen what god's word is that's what really matters amen amen so he says but a healthy one we want to see tommy doing what he loves again climbing trees with his bow amen and building is strong and heavy furniture amen i don't know anybody that knows brother tommy knows that i've called him an engineer as he's an engineer and why did he didn't pick him up and get it take him to the kennedy space center i don't know but he can just about do anything and so it's amazing from welding plastic to i just don't know what all just all kinds of things amen so we appreciate it now notice so he says and so we want to see him do that in building heavy furniture thanks again for the prayers the texts the calls the visits we appreciate it so much and pray that the lord will bless us each and every one of you amen for with god shall be nothing him shall be impossible luke 1 37 and he said these things are impossible with men but possible with god luke 18 and jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible how many believes that and that is in mark 10 and 27 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen anybody who knows brother tommy knows that any time that he can do something for you he will and not only that but he'll go beyond that he will try to do more for you amen let me tell you something i believe this is a time that all of tommy his friends all of us as a church group gets to do something back for him now how many believes we need to do that amen and so those anybody listening out there i've it's been laid upon my heart to take up a love offering for him i know he can't work right now and so forth and he's got a lot of medical bills him and tammy has and and and you know you can only imagine the amount of medical bills that's that's stacked up for him and so forth so amen but they're like they said one day at a time amen and god will take care of it amen and so we want to help him next weekend i'm going to take a blubber offering for him amen next weekend for them to help him along life's way amen and so i also talked to uh brother david beachy woody's dad he's kind of the agent for cam amen and he said that he said you know that whatever the church gives up to five thousand dollars that they'll match it amen so that's a wonderful thing amen that'll be wonderful so i believe god i'm i'm trusting for that and maybe more i'm just believing for you know a good number amen and let's just pray that god will put it later on everybody's heart to help amen amen and so i believe that that we can do that for for brother tommy amen and through the grace of god and we sure love him and uh i once went to see him yesterday and i told him i said you look if you don't feel up there don't come just rest but henry called texted this morning he didn't he said he's feeling good he was he was school he wanted to go to church and maybe give a little testimony amen amen and so i says that's wonderful that's just great amen and so praise the lord how many times is it you know it's the grace of god this morning to have brother tommy with us it's god's grace and a miracle from god amen i know that we were praying and amen and believed that he wouldn't have to do surgery amen and i think we should hold to that lord he don't have to have surgery because a great physician can take care of it amen have we seen god do that miracle bring him through amen and so we love him very dearly amen and so if you want to see a walking talking miracle come on up here brother tommy amen let's give the lord a hand for sparing our brother amen just take your labor brother we love you buddy well i was thinking you know the lord's it's it's a from the lord to have a good wife like a god and you know i believe all y'all and my pastor y'all from the lord too it's great to be back here brothers and sisters i just want to thank you all for all your prayers and everything you're texting your calls i appreciate it all and i love you all i had to come back with a praise report as i laid there in the hospital not knowing whether i was going to live or die you stop and look at your life a little different way you realize how much you love your family and your friends and all those and you feel like it's way too early to leave but most of all you think of the lord and how much of your life you wish you could change and all the things you do different so for now i just want to keep it short and sweet i'm supposed to keep my heart rate down every night keep my blood pressure down [Applause] so i gotta read and not get off track here well sometime later on i'd like to share a lot more but i said where's that all the things you'd like to do different i just want to keep it short and sweet but god is awesome yeah and for everybody that don't know what happened to me it's called a aorta dissection it's the main trunk i got a type b the main trunk comes off the bottom of my heart feeds all this down through here it tore on me and what's happening is like they explained to me it's like a tire two plies and my inner my inner ply tore so now the outside plies the only thing holding it and it's trying to push blood in between the two plies pushing down and uh the rub if it ruptures you know i die immediately and you know they said that like most people die or a lot of people die in like 2.7 seconds you know so that's just a miracle in itself and then it's like the percentage rate was like 28 of people going on the way to the hospital die and you know it's just crazy statistics with it but you know god is he was looking out for me and when i got life-flighted they i got there they were surrounding me with doctors and nurses it was crazy and hectic and a lot of people and a lot of a lot to adore i had doctors all the way around the room you know it was just like wow you know what's going on here and they was prepping me for heart surgery and everything but he wanted to hold off and do another cat scan just to get their game plan together and you know with all our players the lord stepped in i didn't have to have surgery because after the cat scan came back they seen the blockage it was below my heart versus up here the type a and it had stabilized so they was able to just try to treat me and you know get my blood pressure under control and stuff and get me on all kinds of blood pressure meds and everything but you know the doctor says it will always be a tear and won't heal but you know we know the great physician that healeth all and we're believing by stripes i'm already healed he's proven to me time and time again by his grace that all things are possible if we can only believe we all have seen signs and wonders and he sent us a in miracles and he sent us a vindicated prophet and gave us the revelation of it and predestinated us all to see it and you know blessed be his name he saved me by his mercy and his grace and i told him i wouldn't be afraid to share it no more i'll do whatever his will is if you just show me the way but you know that old devil tried to tell me today that i was just gonna be my blood pressure get too high i'd be too weak but i figured boo devil when i'm weak he is strong and greater's eve is within me praise god [Applause] hey man i wanted to share this the other day when i was really needing something lord put this on the lifeline [Applause] you might have a lot of hindrances you might have the doctor's work a scientific man who's examining yourself it might be that man told you you're going to die that's all he knows he told you all he studied his scientific uh word shows that that you must die your whole system's made and that kind of way that death is struck and there's nothing to keep it from going on you're going out that's as much as he knows no science has no medicine part but you found something and you pick up the shoulder see now of course you got a hindrance you got something to do against you that devil that disease that affection but when you strike the tip of swords with that death he revealed it to me [Applause] that's it praise god give god another hand say thank you lord jesus you're more than able lord jesus hallelujah bless your name jesus amen hallelujah god is good aren't you glad to be a christian amen we have a higher authority higher power that we serve amen amen praise be to god amen let's just bow our heads kind heavenly father lord we just come before you this morning lord jesus

ask your blessing upon the reading of the word now upon the service and upon tommy's life lord in a special way in jesus name amen and amen all right let's turn our bibles if you will this morning and we'll go to the book of saint john to the book of saint john in the 11th chapter we want to continue our series on uh the attributes of god is that all right the attributes of god what he is what he is amen amen and as we go through this we'll realize more and more hopefully we'll get a real revelation of that song that says he is my everything he is my all amen how many realize that he is your everything he is your all he is that he is all the bible says and in all and through you all amen i think it's an important revelation so matt i mean saint john chapter 11 verse 20. then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou had been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this she saith unto him lord yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of the god which should come into the world the god of his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen now how many knows the outcome of this amen the outcome of this was that verse 43 he says and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was about uh was ba bound about with a napkin jesus says unto them loose him and let him go now my message this morning is the resurrection the resurrection amen this channel of thought is something that i have spoke on many times or several different times before but i want to speak on it again amen because i think it does it's good the resurrection and really how i come about this you know is i was sitting in uh the new addition that we're building and in this new addition i went about four to six feet closer towards the woods back there at on our property and we put a big double window there so that we could see basically you know down a bluff it's a real steep grade and there's about 20 30 acres back there and it just goes right down and you can see the creek in the wintertime when the leaves are off and i always like to sit right there and open the window and and let the breeze just come in and have me a cup of coffee and enjoy the view amen and i was sitting there and just enjoying the wind coming off of the trees and you know i guess you know there's certain things that the trees put off right like oxygen or something you know and and my wife says she says it's cold shut that window and i was like no i like it i need some of this h2o it's honey that's water well you know i said you know what i mean that oxygen or something the trees are supposed to put off because i wasn't the greatest chemist in the world you know and i do realize it's got some some truth to it right but that hydra she says it takes in uh what was it the oxide dioxide or something abso absorb you know the wrong thing and they put off the right thing you know and i was like i just and catch your free breath i was just you know kind of overjoyed take a couple of breaths it'll make you healthier you know here we are got it coming right fresh right off the trees and i was just enjoying it sitting there just enjoying and thinking of how good god has been amen and how that you know uh you know a lot of people i told my wife a lot of people just live in a place somewhere you know but when you get a special place that it's just to your fitting and just what you like that's special amen and you know i know that even when i was living up in town and and so forth i was you know kind of dreaming of what because i'm a country boy i love to live in the country not necessarily so much in the city and now thinking of how that you know if i could just have about five acres with a little spring going by you know or something you know and maybe i could get me enough acreage just to have to you know maybe a little tractor of some kind and i imagine myself on a little tractor disking or bush hawking you know maybe a little just working on that little piece of property you know and and so forth and you know it wasn't a year and a half later that the lord blessed us with me with about 40 acres and brother william and different ones that know the peace river and i went down there and i said hey this is almost the size of the peace river this is not no little trickling spring this is you know anytime i want to go fishing i just go down over the hill and most of y'all know spa lake and so you know mike has done a lot of fishing there just i was just thinking of the goodness of god and how good god has been you know because we take things for granted we so take things for granted we don't appreciate what god has given us a lot of times and i like to just sit and thank the lord and then we'll just look at the trees and just enjoy the nature that's there and i was just thinking how wonderful it is you know how good god's been of all the hard things that a christian life is and the things that we go through and the suffering that we do and the molding that he makes is you know and the heartache we experience yet god is so good to us amen how many know god just takes care of it and and serving god is it i don't care how many heartaches is i don't care how bad it is it's still worth serving god how many believes it it's worth it to serve god amen to know that you have a hope to have hope because you know and i was thinking about the hope that we have and i thought about the the scriptures i believe it is over here i'll just read it i thought boy what would we do if we didn't have hope what would you do if you didn't have god what if you didn't have any any hope of the future right amen and how sad that would be if we didn't have hope of the future and so forth amen and in in hebrews chapter 6 this scripture came to me amen in verse 18 he says by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have strong consolation amen you know i got to thinking there and i was sitting there thinking you know here i am right at 60 years old and why if i make this happen that'll be a wonderful thing but we don't know whether we will or not right we think of brother ivan the difference marriage and different ones that timmy man different ones that have passed away at 55 56 years old and you know i'm almost five years past that and thinking of even brother branham only around 55 i guess you know and so you think about you know you know i was thinking you know how long will i get to enjoy this and i got to thinking you know this is all just temporary i'm not going to get to enjoy this all that long we don't know how long and i thought well maybe my kids will get to enjoy it maybe when i built this deck that goes a little bit closer and i get to go out there on that deck and i get to sit on the table and i need to look down there you know maybe put some corn down there have a feed and look at the deer and look at the creation watch the squirrels the turkeys go by and you know and i thought maybe they'll sit here then then where will i be huh because let me know time goes so fast oh my well it goes so fast and i thought about maybe them inheritance and where will i be and i got to thinking about how that what what the how great it is to know that you know in this in this world everything here is temporary but for the believer there's a hope that we have then that hope is our anger the hope that we have is the anchor that there's going to be a resurrection and one day it's not going to be somebody else take over amen you'll be able to do that through the eons of time remember but the man said someday when you'll find me maybe i'm way down in the hall or somewhere down in the woods in a little old cab and you'll hear somebody singing amazing grace how sweet the sound that's brother bannon down i guess he made it looking for something that's not temporary i'm gonna have the longing in your soul for something that's not temporary we already have the assurance we already know that we have something that's eternal and no matter what happens in this world amen we have eternal life already you ain't got to worry about dying so i thought about this and this scripture says it this way we have strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that he set before us now we all know hope paul said hope that is seen is uh not hope but why do you have to hope for something you already have but it's for something that you haven't attained to yet that you haven't seen yet then you hope for it he said amen we're still looking forward to it that is still our hope amen amen and so lay hold on the hope that is set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul he says both sure i like that this hope is not sure but this this hope is sure and it's steadfast and it's that which entereth into the veil let me tell you something everybody out here lives for what is on the outside and the satisfying of the flesh but that's not you and i what we have hoped for goes much deeper than just the flesh because we know this flesh is just temporary but that spirit is eternal let me tell you something i don't believe that your spirit ever ages i remember john's brother john stephen amen that was he was 65 maybe somewhere in that he was pretty old you know he says but my body's getting older but i still feel the same on the inside you know and it's the same with you and my his whole body might not be able to do what it used to do it might be getting old but that person on the inside he's still the same guy he is still the same guy let me tell you i'm gonna tell you if you're not what you ought to be you have to let god change that inside guy because let me tell you people that get in a bad habit and a bad routine whatever it might be if you don't have the power of the holy ghost in there to change that you will continue to do that because this same this guy in here is still the same whether he's 30 40 50 80 or 90 you can look at a 90 year old person that character is still the same unless the holy ghost changes that person and how many knows that's what's important is who you really are on the inside what kind of character you have what kind of person that you are because that's what you're taking with you and then if you drop dead this morning whatever you are now that's what you'd be on the other side folks and if you ain't what you ought to be you ought to leave this service until you say god mold me and shake me and while i should be huh amen i think brother tommy is an example of the grace of god but it's also an example of something out of nowhere huh just like that it can be taken it can be over with i think brother tommy i don't know if you meant 2.5 seconds or have you met 2.5 minutes is it seconds that's really quick why because that pumps out we know how quickly that can happen folks i've shot deer through the heart and they went running and they literally pass out running and ran into a tree fell over they were that just a few seconds not even get out of my sight for 20 yards it doesn't take long once that main arteries cut but the grace of god amen and aren't you glad for the grace of god but it shows how how how this life is so temporary amen but there's a hope how many dads have that hope oh my i would sit by my window with a long face and fear in my heart oh god i'm gonna have to meet you one of these days but i'm not right now i know you are mine you couldn't even enjoy the trees you could enjoy god's creation if he wasn't right in your heart amen praise the lord now it's something about god's word there's many there's about two or three different examples i'd like to pull from this thought this morning one of them is a statement that the prophet of god would make and that is he would say something about let me just let me just read this quote to you because i wanted to go along with i believe it's john 11. verse 22. it goes along with this but i know that now let's go back up a verse because i want to pull a little bit here then set martha unto jesus lord if thou hast been here my brother would not have died that's what mary and martha's hope was right and they didn't like it too well because the bible clearly says that he loved martha and mary and lazarus he loved all three of them says he loved them but word came to jesus that lazarus was sick and its bible says he stayed there for a while if you read that same chapter and then after that he says let's go on over to bethany i believe it was another script another place where they had wanted to kill him and the disciple says why do you want to go back therefore they wanted to kill you he says there's only 12 days to work you know and so forth and he actually went the other way he went in a different direction and when he went in that different direction he says lazarus sleepeth you know and the disciple says you know well if he sleeps he does good he says no i want you to understand he's dead he got playing with him his day now language he's dead so he went there and he also talked about he says but you know this is uh it is to glorify god that's what it was for that's why jesus i tell you what if the spirit on the inside of him the father if that spirit would have said go he'd win but he said no go the other way he does whatever the spirit says right and so he went the other way and when he got there as the prophet of god said well i'll tell you martha and mary they had a right to ball him out we called you we followed you we gave everything up for you but yet you wouldn't come why didn't you come now he's dead how could you do that to us huh but they didn't they didn't have the bad attitude they had the right attitude they said yeah lord if you'd have been here we know what it would have happened that was this case in our age too through the ministry of brother bannon folks when he was here god was there with him at all times he backed up what he said things happened and so listen so he says he would not have died you know and something out of jesus every word jesus would say was very significant it was perfect how many beliefs these writings here they were all perfect when he said something it wasn't just idle words like what we might say no it was all perfect when he said your brother will rise again huh and uh before that one thing that mary realized that she said that was good she says but i know that even now whatever you ask god in other words whatever you say i know it's going to happen that was what was going to be the important part is what jesus said this morning that's what's important is when jesus speaks amen he says you know that arise again and these then he says martha says you know we know that at the end time in the last day what basically put in our language we know that god will raise him up again right how many knows that's what's going to happen is god is going to raise it in yeah it's going to be god that's going to raise the debt we know that and then he makes a point and i like this because it brings our title in our subject this morning when he said i am the resurrection i am the resurrection and what else the life he's not just a resurrection but he's also the life that he resurrects now the importance of having the holy ghost how many knows it's important brother bam says if you go if you die without the holy ghost there's nothing there to quicken for god to quicken you have got to die with the holy ghost all right and even uh saint john's there he says he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son has what not life so he is the life the holy ghost is the life amen he is the resurrection and the life now maybe pick the thought up now i'll let me let me finish this first one first let's talk about the importance of his word then we'll talk about the other part about him being the resurrection number one when god speaks number two is that he is the resurrection and the life brother brahm in one of his sermons says it this way now if i told you say lady you're sick i'll lay my hands on you and you'll you'd get well that's all right but i could guess that and that's basically the what any minister believes without a vision or a thus saith the lord and billy graham or roberts a lot of times when they pray for people in the name of jesus christ you are healed amen they have a right to say that because how many knows by his stripes they are healed and then it it's upon their faith and upon the person being prayed for is faith of whether they are or not we know in brother ministry he would have those prayer lines there would be a lot of them that go through accept your healing receive your healing notice a lot of people didn't get their healing because they didn't have the right faith but that was different than when brother branham would see a vision or if he would say thus saith the lord that was absolute there was no changing that that was going to be let me know that that was a word from god amen the other is faith just like you know if y'all can't believe all things are possible that's what you got to do believe all things are possible amen so he says it this way i could guess that but if he will go back and tell you something all right if he'll come and say something and you know whether that's the truth or not maybe he'll show your fault like he did with the woman at the well if he will know what you are what you're here for just like he did with the woman that will you believe him with all of your heart amen i mean no that's why a lot of times discernment tell them where they come from what their name was yes yes yeah they would explode their faith and take out it out out and they received their healing it would help their to know that hey that's not just brother branham that's jesus christ here discerning the thoughts and tense of heart like they would do the word that's christ amen okay now here's the bible scene perfectly here's a woman that i've never seen in my life never spoke to her as i know of she might have been here in meeting somewhere have you ever been in one of the meetings before have you ever been in the meetings but i don't know i don't know you if that's right raise your hand so that people will see now and better man said that a lot of times at the end of his sermons and after his preaching he would say now one word from him will mean more than i can say in a million lifetimes and he said that many places let me just read you another one another one he says one time one time him speaking mean more than anyone could say in a lifetime just one word from him all the preaching's good it's probably no doubt the gospel and so forth but when he comes and seems your name is so and so huh you are afflicted with this go and believe and you have what you have what you have need of so when the holy spirit would begin to discern right brother said that is means more than all the preaching in the world because anybody can say anything but when christ comes when he speaks look out how many knows that's the difference in your life that's the difference in my life that's the difference in young people's lives maybe mama maybe daddy speaks and you believe what they say but when the holy spirit tells you that by stripes i am healed and what he died on calvary he did it for me it becomes personal it changes you forever when he says it to you i don't care if it's healing i don't care if it's salvation i don't care what it is you want that word from the lord saying god that's yours that's mine [Music] changes everything amen changes everything when he says something now how many knows he's already said every let every red letter in there see that red letter called the red letter that when jesus spoke they'd put it in red you take that as just saith the lord every last word that he says is just saith the lord if you could take the scripture of saint john 3 16 for god to love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes he within him shall not perish but live forever if you can take that in your heart god quickens that to you you'll have eternal life how many believes it that's his word when you accept what he said amen it makes all the difference and that's the kind of faith that we got to have to believe what he said there's another scripture about that i want to bring into thought here before we go to the next thought that's in matthew 8 and verse 5. and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus said unto him i will come and heal him wow i mean that's the word of the lord i will come and i'll heal him that's what jesus said you know that's what he was willing to do all right now i'm going to tell you something there's something about it when jesus says stuff it's all significant why did he all of a sudden say i will come to your house i will come to you and heal him he don't just normally say that but he did that to the centurion and forgive me for being presumptuous but i believe there was just something about it that he knew it was something that he was creating a scenario he was putting into effect that would be an example for you and i because the centurion answered and said no lord he said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof now most of us would say yeah yeah come on to my house but this centurion had such respect such mad respect until he says i'm not worthy that you come under my roof huh i'm not even worthy that you would come under my roof but this one thing i know but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed huh it's quite a scenario for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say that this man go and he goethe and another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do with it when jesus heard it he marveled amen glory this is what was coming up he knew this man had faith didn't he i i don't know about you but it has to be some kind of faith for god himself to marvel you know to me it would be like somebody saying wow wow wow you don't get to say get to tell god wow get him to say wow very often i'm sure david did i'm certainly three hebrew children today i'm sure daniel got this got to say god god to say wow that's what i'm saying that's what i like they don't care if they live or they don't care if they die that's not the issue they're going to trust me anyway whether to live or die they are the lords amen this man he says you know all these things jesus marveled and said unto them that followed he turned around said verily i say unto you i have not found so great of faith no not in israel that a person could just what god said said i believe it i'm just looking for you to say the word and i know it's going to happen huh now i got to finish this story is that all right let me see i've got another one and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of god but the children of the kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth now i just have to presume here but he says the children of the kingdom how many knows he came to his own and his own received him not those israelites those pharisees they'll be cast into honor they're the ones that should have had faith like this but they didn't did they he could tell them the truth and they would absolutely uh you know call him deals in return you know he says this and jesus said unto the centurion go thy away and as thou has believed so be it done unto thee i mean at least that's how it is for us this morning as you believe that word is how it's going to be to you according as you believe that's how you receive it he didn't put it any other way he didn't say your servant as well go see him no he said as you have believed so let it be and he genuinely believed because he would have never most of us would have invited him on our house come pray lay your hands on him but this centurion knew what it was like to speak a word hey go do this hey go do that and they do it he knew if jesus was god where he was at that type of authority all he had to do is speak the word amen i don't know about you but i love it when jesus talks to my heart how many knows it's so wonderful when jesus says something to your heart and you follow it and you do it but we all know the calamity that follows when we god tells us to do something and we don't we regret it how many believe let me tell you young people everybody in here listen you listen to that still small voice it won't mislead you and if you don't you'll wish you would have so why not do it anyway this is the only time you should have to hear this when you hear that voice listen to it or you'll regret it why would you want to regret it amen when you hear that voice and you know it's god speaking you better do it amen you know that voice and if you don't know that voice it's important that you learn that voice amen praise the lord you love him so it's important to have him speak because when he speaks amen it's going to happen praise the lord another thing i got from this was this when he said i am the resurrection and the life now how many knows that he said many places i am the root and offspring of david i am the pride and mourning i am i am i am i am the i am but isn't it every day but he talks about how that you know when you go to the ocean and when you take a spoonful of water out of there a little cup of water you take a little cup of water there right and and you go well what have i got well you may not have much but you've got everything that that water has every germ every vitamin whatever all the salt no matter what it is everything is in that little cup how many knows that when christ comes into your heart everything that god is is in you it don't defuse us enough to realize that when you get the baptism of the holy ghost amen all that christ was god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into his church everything that god is you are man i'm sure we could sit here for hours and try to absorb that try to absorb that can i just just go with one more thing you think god is disturbed do you think he's nervous do you think he's a wreck or is he at peace huh can you imagine the peace of god how many knows when you've got the holy ghost the peace of god is not up there anymore it's right here you know what it's like you have the peace of god let the peace of god rule in your hearts the scripture said how many enjoys it how many gods have the peace of god knowing hey our time here is short we won't be here long but you ain't got to be worried about nothing he's taking care of it he that liveth and believeth on me shall never die [Applause] no never die when i got to thinking about all the saints of all the ages i mean let me tell you something all the saints of all the ages and their hope was the resurrection their hope is that resurrection that's what we all serve god for we love him we serve him because we love him and because we have a goal i mean it's got to go abraham had a goal what was it the land of gurire and all of this other and all these land from no he said he was seeking new city whose builder and maker was god abraham had a goal every child of abraham has a goal and you show me what your goal is i'll tell you where your heart is and i'll tell you where your heart is is where your treasure is what is your goal and i'll tell you what your treasure is how many believes that and the christian's goal is not this world amen i said i was thanking god for helping me to achieve the american dream by god's grace i have achieved the american dream but that's by the grace of god that's good to have that's just an extra but am i satisfied with that no i realize it's all going to go by the wayside hey my children never never inherit my farmer mr mr president will try to take it first you're going to want to look in your bank account take your money already aren't they no private property and all this kind of you don't know what's going to happen next you better not have too much of a grip on here the peace of god everything that god is is in you all right can we all say lord work on me lord work on me the love of god let's talk about the love of god for a minute hey i look i don't like it i almost sit and preach didn't this bible say he sat down or something and talked to people he sat down and talked to people we'll just tear right up here and i teach the people huh he said on the rock [Applause] well praise be to god we've been blessed abundantly i guess right i'm gonna bring a rock for me and i'm bringing you a rock too brother oh my you got me there brother glenn think about the love of god how about the love of god you know we can love those that love us but listen if you have to fight hard to love those that hate you you still got a problem you don't have to fight hard so much of the love of god you'll go and when nobody knows you'll be praying for those that hate you so much of the love of god that you have now because that portion is in you god is in you all that god was didn't we hear it so much don't we that all god was or how is it we become the very righteousness of god however right god is is how right you are then the church age book teaches that that we've become the very righteousness of god we have the justification just to be justified and that's as though you've never done it in the first place all your sins are gone brother tommy all of us who are sinners and we're rank sinners some of us are rank sinners uh think about it doesn't the devil try to come back in your mind and put that back on you well you know this that or the other don't let him do that if you know that god has sealed you with the holy ghost don't let them thoughts come in they got no right to come in they got no right to bother you why because that's in the sea of god's forgetfulness now and you ain't got to remember it either the devil just tries to bring that up to you that's what the resurrection i am the resurrection i am your joy i am your peace i am your love i am your power i am your strength oh my brother glenn as i get older i get weaker and i find need i find i need more of the holy ghost because that holy ghost will make you stronger it will actually give you strength the joy of the lord is my strength sin against god one time sin against god living sin and find out how weak you get i don't want to go to work i feel terrible you're just weak huh but you get the holy ghost you have to be 90 year old preacher i can't bear to get up them but get up here and talk about that and then the son of god that thought about us before the foundation where was your job praise the lord i'll make you jump scream and shout give an old man enough energy to jump click his heels together huh go ahead try it it's all right why it's energized it's the power of god amen we're not going to get through this let me hurry let's go to paul i like paul all right let's look at how paul looked at the resurrection he said but those things which were gained to me those i counted lost for christ how many of those paul lost everything in this world for christ i kind of lost for christ yay doubtless in other words this whole world but just give me jesus just let me know him you can have all the world just give me jesus for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things i was to be the next k ephesus the next high priest people respected me when i come walking into the temple people stood at a alert they stepped to the side and watched as i walked because i was paul i was was it saul i guess he was saul before he was paul right that respect and then they got to turn on him after he come to christ all of his prestige all of his glory everything was gone suffered the loss of all things and i count them but dumb and we all know what that is right he counted all those things but dumb they're nothing to me they don't mean nothing why that i may win christ in other words you can have all of that if i can just win christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is in the law but that which is through faith in christ to righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him notice and the power of his resurrection amen whatever it was whatever power brought jesus up from the grave paul wanted to know that power are you with me i want to know the power that raised christ from the dead he suffered the loss of all things he didn't care what it cost him he just wanted to know the power of the resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings folks it used to be whenever they were persecuted and they were beat for the cause of christ they would go skipping down the street rejoicing because they were found worthy to suffer for the lord's cause now you let somebody call us a bad name and we want to punch him in the face that'll say well they're there right call them a bad name and everything no you ain't got the right spirit somebody calls you a bad name the bible says they'll call you all manner of evil they'll cast your name out as evil hallelujah i'm finding myself in the word suffering for the cause of christ paul didn't mind suffering for the cause of christ those 68 million christians didn't mind being thrown in with a bunch of lions rip me to treads but don't you take my price from me huh burn me at the stake but don't you take my christ from me so drive me through the sword don't take my christ from me it was more to them than anything listen they ought to see a people you got to be careful that this laodicea rich should increase with goods and need of nothing doesn't zap that out of you it can zap it out of you to where you love other things more than what you love god that's okay for the make-believer and the unbeliever they're going to do that because they don't love god the way but for the genuine believer he don't want to love anything else more than what he loves god being made conformable unto this death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead that's what paul was looking for he said oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory but i thank god who gave us the victory through jesus christ our lord how many knows when christ died on calvary when that bee went into him and it stung him amen it stung so hard then it pulled the stinger out of that bee and now we can pet the bee we can play with the bee you can let the bee crawl all around it can hear us and be it but he can't never sting anymore because jesus took the sting out of death so much so that the paul said i'm lord willing to lay my head down and let it chop it off no problem huh i'm more willing to go to jerusalem and die for the christ huh evap bosworth oh man brother brown came to and he says brother bother do you realize you're dying what was the best time of your life when you was having meetings when you seen people heal and everything like that and that bible says no brother this is the best time of my life when he was dying took the stinger out of death you don't have to be afraid of death we all want to be at the place to where we want to be to where we come down to the door of death you don't have to be afraid of that's my heart's desire if i ever go after my last breath huh you get in a car wreck and you're pinched in there your blood is flowing out of you or your grips or ribs are crushing the inside is flowing filling up and you're taking shorter breaths every time because those lungs are filling up well praise be to god just like my mother-in-law said when she was having a heart attack how did you help me help me help me then she says i'm going to be with the lord i'm going to be with the lord i'm going to be with the lord sure fear wants a grip but where's your anchor you realize she was going with me with the lord he had that hope even in death amen that's where thomas followed he wants i want to be at the place and so full of that resurrection power that you know that whenever you go to that other side you're not going to no grave don't you believe that ivan is down in that hole amen that's just the body our loved ones they're just that's just their body their soul is over on the other side in a wonderful place and for six thousand years folks people have been waiting for that grand day called resurrection day amen that's why jesus he says i am the resurrection there was a quote that brother bannon made and i just yesterday got the revelation of tying that in with this here because he makes a statement he says that when you're planted in christ hallelujah the holy ghost baptism yes sir everything you have need of for this life's journey even the rapture is in you then then he says don't resent that because brother ben could pick up when people resented that the rapture is in you when you get the baptism of the holy ghost don't resent that that's the truth the rapture is in us now i will prove it by the gospel now brother babylon in this scripture says those whom he has justified justified he has borified hallelujah then in heaven we're glorified but i take it to this scripture huh right you can bring it right back to here where he says the rapture how many knows that the rapture is part of the resurrection the dead in christ arise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them all a part of that resurrection and jesus said i am your rapture i am your resurrection and where is jesus go ahead in me if jesus in you the resurrection is in you the rapture is in you hey amen it's in you then it was a little hard for people to swallow back then but everything the prophet said we all know has to line up with the word now i love it when i see that it's according to the word amen praise the lord oh my so paul he didn't care what happened lazarus so what jesus said i am the resurrection and the life and he went over there and preached to him a little bit more and he went and cried out the lazarus lazarus come forth and what happened here comes what looked like a mummy right it said that his face was wrapped folks he didn't have to worry hurry up and get it off his nose so he can breathe there he come walking them he didn't have to breathe yet not until he gets it all off of there they begin we have a do you believe they brought a dead man here in a casket huh somebody would be inspired say rise call the name and i like what the public god said he said you know it's a good thing he said rise lazarus lazarus rise up he called the name otherwise everybody would have come now how many please there's going to be a now let me say this there is a resurrection for every soul every soul gets a resurrection but i won't take the time into it but revelations i believe it is in the around the 20th chapter talked about the first resurrection and those that were beheaded for the witness of christ lived and reigned for christ for a thousand years this is the first resurrection and they lived and rained for a thousand years and then the devil is loosed for a little while upon the earth amen and there's gog and mayhawk there's a battle and then after that notice it says that the dead that were in the sea and under the sea death and hell gave up the dead they were in there all brought up we know that if you sin in the body that body will be raised back up and this something else i want to just point out here that is when you think about the power of god and the awesomeness of what those people saw when they saw that dead man walking again and he could speak to a man whose nose perhaps had already caved in and it come popping back out he fell back out they unwrapped him there should have been a jubilee huh there should have been a falling down and worshipping jesus this man has power to call people out of the grave it isn't hard for god to heal you guys it's easy for him to heal you it's nothing for him to heal you if he can bring a dead man back but how many knows there was something even harder that god did over remember the old testament he said to the prophet he says can these bones live a whole army a whole valley full of bones just dried up clacking against each other perhaps when you throw them around or whatever but what he speak he said speak and the bones you talk about a you talk about something to watch can you imagine those bones came together and they had a skeleton you had a weird-looking eye you know and just bones everywhere fingers just all of them come back together and then they watch you go from the bones to sinews your flesh again the flesh becomes come back on them you know all the muscles and the arteries of the heart come back on and just a red blob of flesh wicked looking skinless and the skin came back on and it didn't look so bad and they called it back not only called all that army back but told them to breathe amen they came back to life that ain't nothing too hard for god how many knows in the resurrection but the bible says in those lions then how far your atoms and their molecules are scattered and then god will call and they will answer that's what paul's looking for that's what you're looking for the greatest treasure in this world eternal life that right eternal life they're my whole shall be eternal amen i'm he's looking for an eternal home i'm going to speak as i feel the holy spirit to speak and that is that a lot of us all of us we have got to get a grip on what is the real ambition you have got to get a grip on what your goal is you don't you let the cares of this world the the the deceitfulness of riches to choke out the holy ghost and the life of god in you amen that's our bible it's leodacya rich increased with goods have neither nothing don't realize we ain't even got a hallelujah anymore we ain't got to praise the lord we ain't got to shout we ain't got to scream we ain't got enough of god we ain't got enough of that quickly powering us we need the power of the rather outward and all the power and the resurrection in a greater way than he is action you ain't got to worry about the resurrection just worry about making sure you're getting christ oh my we've heard this so many times i think i should read it again i think i'll read it again and see how high i can fly and then i like that song that's the way it is for the christian we are planted together in christ jesus who's the inexhaustible fountain of life we're planted in christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything that we have need of in his life's journey divine healing the power of god and all these things is in every individual in here that's received the baptism of the holy ghost amen every person that's received the baptism of the holy ghost everything you have need of nothing shall be impossible unto you [Music] it's according to your belief remember your last sunday i said brother branham didn't care if he lived or died didn't matter i'm believing god's word now i'm eating this food mama crying across the table don't do it don't do it billy i love you i want you around but he had suffered with it so much until he was tired of suffering with him he was going to take god at his word he didn't have a prophet coming over him praying over him and saying hey you you know in the name of the lord no he just took god at his word and he got healed that's what we got to do just take god at his word stand there and start acting noisy already and i like this part i believe that you got to start acting like it's already done too many people say i am healed and then they won't act like it they been waiting for some magic wand to come over and make him feel all different that's not faith sure god can do that but listen he wants to see action upon you huh my arm wants to give me trouble my muscles in my arm that that what i pulled that muscle wants to still give me trouble guess what i don't care i believe i'm healed i can do it you work it better than i could before work a little more folks i'll grab on weights and if it hurts let it hurt i believe i'm healed it's not going to get worse it's getting better and it's getting better you know how many aches and pains i've been healed of by taking that attitude i can't even begin to tell you come on hold folks this should be good folks lord help me i could never believe i'd fit in that category i thought i'd always be young but know when you're 60 you old you're the old category right there now oh my and i thank god for his grace can i read one more quote to you and we'll close brother brandon preached another mother's day message and he talked about the family and he talked about the resurrection someone said you preached too much on the resurrection most every message has got something about the resurrection why sure it's the cardinal resting place of the gospel i mean it's a cardinal hope is that when we die we're gonna come back again we're gonna be resurrected amen no matter what he did talking about christ no matter what he said if he didn't rise again it wouldn't mean the thing i mean no matter what we believe or how you live if you don't come up again it ain't gonna mean a thing now notice he says and i think it's the great coronation of the full gospel is the resurrection it's divine promises and the consolation that it gives those who are trusting in it for it promises the great union of our uniting together again the fading away of all sin it promises the fading away of all deformity all the sufferings that we have did than this had to go through with this in this life it promises then the vanishing promises then the vanishing of us all it promises us that that even death will lose its hold amen and we'll rise in the likeness of christ remember one place says if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are from above and not from below so notice that we will rise in the likeness of jesus so to my opinion the resurrection is the greatest of all the promises in the things of the scripture that's where it is sealed that's the day for me that great day of days and to see what it'll mean to all of us in the resurrection as we labor and wait for that blessed day of days it gives us the promise that someday that these old wrinkly feeble grey-headed broke-down mothers will be changed amen we could just sit here right now and we can think about meeting brother paul brother peter john all the saints how many of us we're going to be gathered together in the air all the saints will be gathered together according to the scripture to meet him in the air in other words paul's group isn't going to go meet him before we do we're going to be all together and then we'll get to see him that's how the resurrection is going to be all right broke down mothers will be changed not only will mother sit there by her sitting there by herself no but all of her family with her what a day that will be what a time it will be when i look upon the faces of those who have love we have loved so well what a difference on that morning that's another song that came to my mind as i was sitting there a golden morning is fast approaching when jesus will come and take us home we're looking for a golden morning that's that resurrection morning great morning i stopped so quick with peter paul irenaeus martin wesley all the saints of our age the prophet of god paul peter all of them think about it moses how many people see moses how many of these will see abel samson all the saints will get to meet him let that be a reality in your heart that's our goal and then we're going to live throughout the ceaseless ages you realize that abel's been waiting 6 000 years now i thought about that when i was thinking about the resurrection i thought abel 6 000 years and you know when i got to think about eternity and abel see when when you get over there the prophet said he was over there he says there's no yesterday and there's no tomorrow there's no time you're not in time so that's totally insignificant if i go and ask abel abel boy you waited a long time he's going to say what are you talking about no this looks like a second he won't know what i'm talking about because it's just like that see how many knows that we've been going through this for six thousand years now the world has in sin for six thousand years and when you compare that to eternity it's really not long it's not long at all six thousand years because when we've been 100 000 years you see how long we've been here insignificant just like one second there's no time here amen that's gonna be awesome and never never be in time all right now i just had to stop and put a little more in there because we really just skip over it so fast we don't really try to comprehend and get the depth of it of what it really is going to be like what days what it's really going to be like amen y'all getting tired now all right y'all you know i try to be sensitive when they all start losing and everything it's time to shut down i've watched preachers that have absolutely bored the people to death and wouldn't quit i was like brother you need to get a revelation of your congregation when they have shut down shut him down and an hour later he was from upset with him because he really wasn't going anywhere just putting his input in it that's not what it's all about but still all right here we go now notice what a difference on that morning when we shall see our loved ones and to watch what they'll be all the afflictions will be taken away all the mars and sufferings will be done no more pale cheeks of death no more tears from the eyes the resurrection promises all of this there'll be no more funerals praise be to god i as a preacher i don't like doing funerals i don't like funerals i got to do funerals we don't take no pleasure in doing funerals no more patting the baby on the cheek that's like a piece of stone where the undertaker was embalmed and pushed out and put paint on and so forth to look natural it'll never be there again and to watch their character seeing how they conduct themselves with that sweetness and quietness no more nervousness or frustrations to see them standing in the likeness of jesus christ oh that'll be a wonderful day and each one of us in our minds are anticipating and longing for that hour of consolation when we meet them each one thinking about our own loved ones maybe a mother dad brother uncle whoever it might be are you with me how many saying lord jesus that's what i'm looking for stand with me this morning musicians if you'll come but tommy did you want us to pray for you you want us to pray for you all right how many believes in the power of prayer amen we're going to anoint the brother tommy and we are going to claim his healing believe it with all of our heart yeah come on by tommy amen if the elders would come we want to have prayer he mentioned it yesterday amen and we want to follow the scriptures and believe that amen god will create how many know god can create amen he can do what the doctors can't do what they say
