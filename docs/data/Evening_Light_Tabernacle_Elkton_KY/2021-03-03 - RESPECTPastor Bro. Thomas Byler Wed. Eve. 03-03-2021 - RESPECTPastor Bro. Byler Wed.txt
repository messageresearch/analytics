open the word father we just come before you lord once again thank the lord to be able to have the strength lord to be able to come and assemble ourselves together in your name and father we're so grateful lord jesus that wherever two or three assemble themselves together in your name there you are in the midst of them and father we believe that you're here tonight lord we thank you father that you have promised never to leave us nor forsake us we do thank you for this opportunity to be able on this midweek service lord jesus father when we're busy working and it's a perhaps a hard week or whatever it might be just to take the middle of the week and take a little break and lay down our thoughts and the cares of life jobs and everything else just shed it out and come together to meet lord jesus to pray and seek your will and seek your faith lord jesus and call upon your name and father see what you would have lord for us tonight whatsoever you want us to say we ask god that you

raise him up lord father we just ask god for protection for each and every one lord sister perish different requests that were made we ask god that you would just go to each individual lord jesus and give them a touch of your hand father we ask god these blessings and favors in your precious name amen and amen amen if it be all right we'll just do a little bible study tonight amen on a little thought amen of respect amen i've spoken on it many times but i felt led to speak on it perhaps just one more time would that be okay excuse me so if you will turn your bibles to matthew 10th chapter matthew 10. we want to read from the 10th chapter and beginning with verse 40. he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you that he shall in no wise lose his reward turn to chapter 18 matthew 18. put this down a little bit lower micah 18 and verse 4. whosoever therefore still humbled himself as a little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little one in my name receiveth me but whosoever shall have been one of these believed in me it were better that for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he would drown in the depth of the sea what went to the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense has come may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight like i said i want to just talk for a little while on respect amen and so amen we uh this of course is talking about here is talking about the ones that jesus sends because i know that god knew that he would be glorified amen he would be crucified that he died and he'd raise again then he go back into the pillar of fire i come from god and i go back to god he says he went from the pillar of fire back to the pillar of fire and paul of course seen that pillar of fire on the road to damascus amen and so we know that jesus christ came back on the day of pentecost and he is living in the hearts of his people amen so we see that god was talking here in the aspect of his people and how that as we respect one another we respect god amen and especially the children of god amen however you treat one of those but i want to start with go way back amen perhaps with the origination the origination of disrespect now i'll talk about disrespect for a little while and then maybe the other half will talk a little bit more about respect but disrespect of course originated in heaven amen this respect origin was spawned should we say spawn from something called pride amen how many knows that pride is is you get lifted up in pride as they call right so all of a sudden you're higher than everybody else or better than everybody else you know you get lifted up in pride and and you become disrespectful you're thinking you're better than anybody else over in the book of james uh i believe it was it talked about how that you know if some if a man comes to you to your church or whatever and and you know he has really bad clothing and he's not dressed good and you know you set him in the lower seats you know uh you know i don't know i guess maybe this would be the lower seats i don't know but iron man helping you put him up in the balcony you know but anyway we'll just use that as an illustration but one comes in and he's all dressed up he's real nice you know and you find the best place james was and don't have respect a respect or a person because god himself is not a respecter of persons amen how many knows he's not a respecter of persons amen and you'll find that over in the book of acts of 10th chapter where peter went to the house of cornelius which was a roman centurion which i guess it's over 100 people to be a centurion something like that and so he was an absolute gentile is that right he was a gentile he was a roman and when when when uh this centurion and when this the cornelius whenever he uh uh he did alms and he prayed and fasted i think for about four days and god hurries heard his prayer and the angel came to cornelius and said you know that your arms have been heard and you've been heard god has heard you you know and whenever you know peter he was having this vision of not eating things that you know that's not clean and so forth yet just come out of that when all of a sudden you know the thing of it was not to hang out with gentiles or not to be with gentiles because you're pollute yourself and so forth but the angel came and says no no more no more that you know and then then some of the runners came from the house of cornelius amen they were looking for him and then they found peter and peter went back and preached to the house of cornelius and so forth and he says uh for surety i know now that god is no respecter of persons or of nations but he absolutely i don't know exact words i could read it here in a second but he talks about anybody that respects god or any nation that respects god god will respect them it doesn't matter who it is am i right and so god is not a respecter of persons and you and i can't be a respecter person i don't care if it's a millionaire or if it's obama out there in the street as far as god's concerned that soul is just as valuable one or the other right and in the world you and i are living in we're living in a massive massive i mean display of disrespect how many knows it's just total disrespect out there and the prophet even taught us he says you let children become get to the place that they disrespect their parents isn't that right he said that family is all tore to pieces why because there's no respect there has to be respect if there's no respect anymore that means there is no love there anymore because i want to tell you just as pride brings disrespect love brings respect it brings uh consideration and understanding it puts you in the other person's shoes makes you feel for the other person amen and and what i thought about when i thought about love bringing respect i thought about how that brother branham was in that field in that right where this killer bull had killed a black man and they went and put him in somewhere else and he found himself in the middle of that field with no tree and no gun on his side and no fence close and this bull was stomping his feet and he was blowing his nose and he was fixing to come and brother madam was scared first or whatever he reached for his gun this out of the other he says he realized he couldn't do nothing so what do you do he just pray god this is how i'm supposed to go help me to go bravely and he says something come down and swept over and he said it was love and brother bannon began to talk to the bull hello folks i want you to know some disco has gone to every one of us whether it's friendships whether it's brothers and sisters where it's families if you really get the love of god in your heart amen you're going to have a respect for that person you're going to try to feel where they're coming from how many of those half of our arguments stem from not being able to understand each other or trying to get our point across and not understanding what the other person is saying a conversation and an argument will go so much better if you'll say yes honey i understand what you're trying to say so this is what you're trying to say to them and if you've got the correct answer you're honey your wife's eyes are going to get about that big and said really you got it right wow because we're so used to not having an understanding not going not having the other person to be able to understand what you're saying go ahead brothers amen this word here that's the truth in it yeah and but if you could understand what that person's but you'd have your things to get along a lot better amen and i'll tell you you know you find out during this cove at times when amen and me me and my wife are together a lot lately we're together a lot and i realized this you know for us to really have harmony i'm going to have to be very considered an understanding of her all right there's going to have to be a whole lot of love going on here that's right little not a lot of consideration and everything vice versa amen because if you don't amen it can be stressful that's right because if you don't get along real good it's stressful being together a lot huh but anyway let's get off that one shall we but anyway so what i'm trying to say is brother bannon was understanding he put himself in the bull's place and he began to say look this is your territory all right god put it in your brains and in your instinct and in your nature to protect your ground i mean he was understanding where he was coming from why because he had the love of god and him and he had so much love that he had so much respect that he began to tell that bull i apologize that i intruded upon your territory you know what that means that means because i kind of say with him that bull understood perfectly what he was saying hey it might have been a different language but he said it let me tell you god can interpret it to him same way with the hornets how many remembers when the hornets when he was there and he bumped against the fence and those hornets come up out of there and they were coming for him he said i apologize that i'd be disturbed too hello i mean our lives would be a whole lot better if we had more of the love of god in our hearts we'd have a whole lot more respect and that right and so he began to apologize he said now in the name of the lord i i'm working here trying to get in my yard mode but go back to where you come from hello and somehow or another i believe it was prophet said i don't know how they heard it but they did what they were told they went right back to where they were amen oh but i love to tell the bull story i love to tell the bull story because batman says that will come running at him isn't that right he come charging at him i mean i can just see that big back black bull by the time i know that big old black bull look coming just getting it you know so formal i understand in that bull just before he got to him he put his feet down and plowed into that ground and come to a stop and uh he looked this way did he look that way where did that guy go i don't know if you can see where he was looking around but hey man what is it i mean believes that god can do just that folks he can he can make a way when you don't think there's a way jesus if he needed to he can walk right in the middle of a bunch of people he was trying to kill him amen so we look at that and you know and what brought this respect in the very beginning amen was that i guess it must have become commonplace to the satan and all of those angels heaven in that perfect perfection in that perfect life in that perfect presence of god i cannot imagine any angels having discontent being discontent huh and maybe they weren't maybe they weren't discontent but satan the devil amen remember he was up there and it says that his heart was lifted up with pride and in uh isaiah 14 i believe it gives it says he says he said in his heart i will be like the most high i will exalt myself my throne above the stars of god i will be like the most high he wanted to be like god he got up lifted up in pride and perhaps began to think that he was as good as god was huh he was as good as god was and you know god just doesn't deserve all the worship he just don't deserve all that and he got lifted up and he become disrespectful to god and what did he do he went through heaven and he began to tell the other angels you know you ever notice how god always gets all the glory we don't get no more glory and he sowed that discontent he sowed that seed of discord he sowed a disrespect the minute that he got lifted up in pride and he got out of his place he began to have disrespect for god amen i believe it's over in the book of jude it talks about now over in the book of jude it talks about basically it starts from the angels actually verse starts in verse 4. it says for there are certain men kept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men notice turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ i will therefore put you in remembrance though he once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterwards destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation hath he reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day so we see here that the angels didn't keep they didn't stay in the place that god had called them to be they changed their mind they went from one to another he went from one state of mind to another state of mind they did not keep their place they lost their respect now remember those words lost their respect amen how many believes you have to be careful not to lose your respect because when you lose your respect amen then you also lose your love that's right and you become disrespectful arrogant and just like these angels and like israel so now notice i want to read verse 12 first because it says woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain perished in the gain saying of cora spots they are in your feast and charity when defeats you feeding themselves without fear now remember that fear is a reverence or a respect i mean at least the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom i'll tell you this right now the world is in the condition that it is because they lack respect for god people don't even have respect for themselves anymore people just don't have any respect not for their self amen it's terrible but here it says feeding themselves without reverence or fear clouds the eye without water carried him out of winds trees whose fruit is withered twice dead tucked up by the roots and so forth but he talks about cain talks about natural and brute beasts michael the listen to this it talks about uh sodom and gomorrh giving themselves over the strange flesh i mean they lost their respect these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion or authority in that right and speak evil of dignities of authorities yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses thirst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuked you hello am i right here or did the angels or were they careful about what they said to the devil did you read that with me listen let me read it again because that's the way i read it michael the archangel when he was contending with the devil and he was disputing about the body of moses thirst not bring against him a rattling accusation all he said was the lord rebuked you huh he watched his mouth i want to tell you out of our mouth flows the the ooze of disrespect when somebody becomes disrespectful watch their mouth they will blah blah blah blah tells anything about anybody with any regard and spread the poison everywhere disrespect amen and you got to watch what you say that i'm going to know that because one little offense targets the son and daughter of god and god's going to get you for it you'll dearly pay for it you have to be very careful what comes out of our mouth even the devil i know about you but i don't like the devil a whole lot but yet according to this you got to watch what you say just like you say come on devil you better watch what you say huh you challenge him you better be careful just the lord rebuke you the lord the lord is my shield he'll take care of you huh but i believe we can say things that we shouldn't say we can get ourselves in a lot of trouble when we open our mouth when we shouldn't amen and so that's what the devil did now notice over it came down in the garden of eden so we know that he took two-thirds of the angel or third of the angels of heaven he actually persuaded to become disrespectful and god thrown them all out now i'm trying to get to heaven they got thrown out of heaven i'm looking forward to going to heaven [Music] how many knows church and being a christian is heavenly places in christ jesus if you're in christ amen church is one place that's supposed to be a heavenly place in christ if church gets old to you i've said many times heaven's gonna get old to you church gets common to you heaven's gonna get common to you because you're gonna be there a long long long long time huh satan was there who knows how long god help but never to get old but the prophet of god said don't never let the word and the message of the hour to become common to you amen praise the lord let me just say this while i come to mind because you know brother brother bam taught us that when we come to the house of god amen when our children cry too much screaming and hollering they're not supposed to keep in here we got a nice little cry room go back there that is disturbing to everybody beside you huh respect that right amen a lot of churches when you come to church 30 minutes before we've had a few here 30 minutes before tonight i could point them out to you but listen when we come he says to come early why because it's the time of consecration it's a time of respect a time now knows respect is reverence so you don't come in the 30 minutes before and hey brother john i wasn't logging today huh i didn't like you you know you didn't get run over by a skit or anything but just talk about everything and anything broadband says come in here quiet he says it'll mess up the service if you do those things coming reverently quietly respectfully to what what is it to take your mind off of the things of the world take your mind off of all of the cares of life come in early and let me just say world you know if our church services are hurting it's probably because of that because we don't pray enough about service ask each one of you tonight ask yourself how many minutes you spent actually praying for tonight's service no i'm going to rebuke a little here but if a lot of us locally here if we need to pray long and we just say hey you know i need to go because that's what the holy spirit had told you to do huh because that's part of the reason i don't like the council service on the wednesday night didn't really want to in the first bit but kobe kind of pushes into it because once you get out of something it's easy to stay out of it you start failing church and it's easy not to come to church it's much easier next time not to come to church and i'll tell you what your excuses for not coming will get thinner and thinner and thinner smaller and smaller and smaller what is all that it's all a disrespect to almighty god we used to go through storms snow storms and floods just to get to church huh but now we got our well just the smallest slightest thing will keep us out how many believe showing up for church it means you're respecting god amen if you can't come and you're at least on the internet look at that's at least a respect to god but anyway come pray how many believes it's irrespect that's what the prophet of god taught us the respect amen a respect for almighty god because he sees everything we do he sees everything we don't do amen he's not a respecter of persons and yet if you respect him he will respect you amen he will hear you just like the house of cornelius he prayed he did alms and he did everything he could and god heard him for what he did god hears us for what we do he sees us for what we do so how many will do that after the night everybody let's remember come early get on your knees pray read your bible get your mind off come you know because when you respect god remember you come and you're beginning to expect something to happen you're expecting brother byler or should i say the holy spirit through brother byler to say something that he didn't know amen something that exactly what you needed and when you catch that amen you had a hollow praise to god thank you god that's right because i mean believes that's how god works amen now i'm gonna tell someone brother glenn here he had the nerve to pick on me i'm gonna pick on him i like that remember last time i told my until i was preaching out there about respecting your wife and have you know i opened the door for her and so he picked on me a little out of turf he said i was talking brother bob he got come on and he said brother i tell you what i'll be trying 40 years to get my wife to open my door for me you just messed that up you sent me back about another 20 years because you know that was just funny it tells you it shows you they're listening right how many believes that is we respect one another and we respect god amen when you love god you will love one another go read first the second time john says so much that it's impossible for you to say that you love god and not love your brother you say you love god and hate your brother he says you are a liar and if you love your brother you will respect your brother you will respect your sister it brings you respect amen one place better i'm talking about respect and so forth he says you know cast your if you want somebody to say something good about you say something good about them he says because it's like casting your bread upon the waters and it will come back to you people will say something good back at you amen and then another brother from canada sold brother branham the first time i had ever read that i'm 45 almost 60 years old never knew that this was a saying but catch your bed upon the waters and they'll come back to you buttered i like that that's right the bread will come back and it'll be bothered that's right amen sometimes people say disrespectful things about you and everything just keep your mouth shut and try to say something good that's the real victory that we're looking for because watch out then people will ever actually have a be able to respect for that as you respect others others respect you praise be to god but that came on down it come down on the in the eve how many knows that eve fell because she began to not believe what god said just to not believe what god said is a disrespect it is an absolute disrespect to not believe what god said and eve didn't believe it she did believe something else she believed the devil when he told her that you're not really gonna die now let's say let's say this for sure that the devil called god a liar huh because god said you're going to die then i said no he's not you're not going to die no that god just said that made him a liar and the devil's lie over god's word it was a disrespect was it it was a complete disrespect and we of course know that cave which was of that wicked one the bible says which was of that serpent before he was turned he was of that wicked one and even after he brought his fruit and he brought his uh offerings amen the bible says that god had respect abel and on his offerings but on came god had no respect why because it was the incorrect worship oh boy that's a good sermon incorrect worship how many knows the incorrect worship of god i don't even accept it from you it has to be the right worship it has to be the right sacrifice the right offering to god amen and so yet not respect and then god came to god came to cain and talked to cain said hey cain i know you're a little bit mad here you're roth your continent's fallen he says but why don't you worship the way your brother does and i'll i'll accept you i'll accept you but can't do it he didn't even have to respect after god told him how to do it to do it that way amen my my mind so we seen that respect coming on down coming on down on down disrespect all the way to uh israel how many knows israel was very disrespectful to almighty god it's respectful that most of them are eternally lost the bible says many places they enter not into rest because of our unbelief they perish because of their unbeliefs and they're right because of their unbelief they perished god had moses to come and bring the children of israel out of egypt in that right with a mighty hand how many knows those fleas those frogs those flies those blood the water turning into blood they are that was all miracles of god can you imagine from one day to the other the gossip so to speak that went through the ranks of israel hey you know what you know there ain't no they ain't got nothing ain't got no water it's all blood oh my word all these look at all these frogs moses called for these frogs look at them jumping around everywhere what's next one from one thing to the other wow never know what to expect next until i finally there was a proclamation and a big old trumpets on it that we could all go they said that we could all go take all your stuff and go boy they went screaming and hollering rejoicing god had delivered them just like he said he would and brought them out out of the land of egypt brought him all the way to the red sea and when they come to the red sea is that right they come down to the end and then as soon as he got into a bad place oh come on folks that's where our true test is get to get you in a bad place and find out what you do what you do then is what you are you come down and says moses you mean you brought us out here they really disrespected moses you no good leader he brought us out here wasn't there enough he great in egypt for us about the barriers that you had to bring about us out here so they can kill us out here and barbarians in the sand and god heard all that and that right how many of us they weren't disrespecting moses they were just disrespecting god amen disrespecting god from one to the other to the other nathan and cora how many remembers uh nathan accord cora got nathan got lifted up in pride also and he was spiritual he knew how to pray he had the holy ghost so to speak he felt like he was right with god he says you're not the only holy man we're only two you know you take too much upon yourself and they open their mouth they weren't happy with it they weren't content with it with the way that god had ordained it no it had to be their way and boy do we ever get in trouble when we think that something's got to be i'll tell you what god brings things against us against the way that we think it ought to be you know that just to see how we'll react to it just to see our reaction to see if we're really dead or not or we're alive amen sure he does and trump trust me god is a master at it he'll do it when you don't think he's doing it he'll do it in a way you ain't expecting it to happen amen but he's going to trust and try every son that comes to god must be tried must be tested amen nathan said man this ain't right it ought to be this way this is not the way it's supposed to be he opened his house with disrespect about marion amaran miriam and aaron i mean i was there disrespected moses and he made a little snicker and a little fun about who moses married what color she was and so forth and that they were struck with leprosy isn't that right miriam i think a prophetess and so forth aaron god's right hand is his right hand man so to speak but yet they were both going to be dead because of their disrespect see we open our mouth when disrespect comes in here when disrespect sets in you can believe one place it's gonna show it's coming right out of our mouth that's where it comes from came with date and came with eve it came with man just all kinds of miriam aaron how about here's one you remember the elijah that cursed those 42 children that came out listen to this brother babe says it this way he liked them in the name of the lord because not because of the children but because of the irreverent parents that brought the children up the way to disrespect god one thing i don't care if it's thomas by eiler i don't care of what your last name is every one of us is more and greatly affected by the way that you was raised and what you think you are greatly affected by it by the way you have respect or not whether you think you're better than everybody else or not or whether you're humble or whether whatever the your pattern of thought most of the time is directed to the children from the parents amen so how many knows that's why it's so important to bring your children right now none of our us parents were perfect you probably aren't perfect but when you see where you're wrong at how many notes that's where you want to change it say let me follow the bible scriptures if i'm not doing something right let me get back to the way the bible tells me amen because my parents were wrong i'm probably wrong but we're here to try to straighten some of that wrong out amen irreverent parents that brought the children up to disrespect god two she bears come out and killed 42 of them how many knows 42 children that's a pretty big chunk of children that's a bunch can you imagine the bloody mess that it was it wasn't no pretty sight for them to get killed by bears and why that's right because of irreverence god demands respect and when they disrespected the prophet they just disrespected him no matter what if they didn't believe it they ought to have kept their mouth shut stay away from it but no they had to put in their nicholsworth huh i mean those that's where we get into troubles when we want to put in our nicholsworth this is what i think i ain't even got a thought coming i wanted what the holy spirit wants i follow the holy spirit and if i don't trust me god will get onto me for i mean that's for every one of us i don't want my nickel's worth i don't want my input let god do it amen but listen they had to say something that they ought not to have said and that's what why it happened so notice um let me see here did i miss something yes here it is they have been taught to snicker and to laugh and to make fun like the children of today too many of them found of a street meeting amen they'll make fun of their preaching of the gospel amen they were taught to snicker and to make fun and laugh and so forth and if you remember what he said what they said to elijah was thou ballhead go up double head go up it wasn't elijah was it it was elijah elisha because they were talking about elijah growing up like elijah did if i'm not wrong but listen he called him a bald head bald head what them kids even were taught to disrespect an adult how many knows we don't teach our adults because back in the olden days and get back slap right there you go it won't be disrespect anymore nowadays you have to be careful i guess unless you live on the farm like i do but listen those kids weren't taught to respect they were taught to make fun ah that's just old elijah that's just uh you know brother branham hello that's just that seventh grade educated hillbilly you better watch what you say isn't that right and think about this and this just comes to mind because here god had enough love to tell us the true path in this generation by sending malachi 4 and going world over with the power of god healing back in pointing us right back to the bible and nothing but the bible in that right and proving and vindicating with powers and and healing and so forth discernment the very same thing with the woman at the well your name is so-and-so all the time to the very last messages that he ever preached what the denominations do they had such disrespect until they went so to speak into their basement their denominational basements and said it ain't even happening then they ain't shining the sun ain't shining out there these things aren't happening you know he ain't a prophet as you respect god's people god's prophets that's the reward that you get accordingly isn't that right if you give a cup of cold water to one of god's children you can't help one another you can't give you want to eat anybody a cup of cold water without losing your reward amen remember the shunammite woman the tsunami woman she had respect for the prophet and she realized that he was a man of god amen we believe he's a man of god and they build him a little building a little addition come on and so forth and what did uh elijah say to gehezei said go ask her what she wants amen can you imagine asking the prophet of god amen probably god telling you what do you want you better be careful amen because your wish will most likely be granted is that right she says i haven't had a child what did she get she got a child and about 12 years later the devil just said hey i'll get rid of this little boy i'll he'd kill him from sunstroke and my head my head out in the hot sun and his head hurting symptoms of a sun stroke and killed the boy amen got her boy and told her servant saddle up the mule we're going saddle him up get it ready her husband hey where are you going you know the prophet's probably not even going to be there it's not a new moon or a holiday or anything he says that's okay all is well don't worry about it his wife said don't worry about it honey i'll be all right i'm going she packed that little boy and she went and she found prophet if i'm not wrong if i remember right she said hey is i tori i don't want no perfect i want to talk to the main man is that right and he went elijah event elijah come and he prayed over that boy i'm not sure if it's seven times or something like that he sneezed coming back to life amen why because she had respect and she received a prophet's reward i want to ask you something what do you think that we have received by accepting a prophet in this generation the prophet that god himself sent and came into the platform almost every time and proved and vindicated to be true amen my we can be free we don't have to worry about what church is right what religion is right we know what is right this bible is what's right god has come and he has proved that that's what's right nothing else not my word not nobody else else's word is right but that is right amen oh my not to mention think about this let's think about a couple more how about the uh another widow got a res uh a prophet's reward called the widow that had that one son remember elijah went and he went to the mountains and so long and afterwards used to go down into this city a widow old sustainer he come walking down the sidewalk and there was a winner there and she was fixing her last meal they're right fixing her lego he said what he got well i got a little meal and a little oil here you know we're about to starve it's you know we've not had rain for three and a half years we're about to die oh you know he said i got enough for one more cake for me and my son we're gonna eat it and die and you know what this prophet said this prophet said well bring me one first oh you got enough for you and your son one more meal bring it to me would you bring it to me whoa why that would get some people critical with me when i get critical you can really get critical you know but no he said bring it here and that right and she was gonna do it she went and she says okay you say so she must have seen something in the man for thus saith the lord huh maybe she had done turned maybe she was going in to get that meal maybe she was ready but for thus said the lord the meal will not dry up and the oil will not dry up until this drought is passed i think it was three and a half years she got this scrape scrape scrape probably three times a day i don't know but i i'm gonna ask her how much gay weight weight she gained how much weight did she get in that three and a half years i grant you you could probably eat all on that barrel you wanted to huh jesus was sustained why it was a prophet's reward i don't believe there's anybody that is in a place of authority like a prophet of god or a wise man or a scribe right or even you just the children of god doesn't have to be part of the fivefold ministry i know the fivefold ministry is a gift that's given by god isn't that right that's exactly right it's a gift given by god and then there's you know but every one of us it doesn't make me special just makes it's just that god has given me a gift i'm just like brother branson i am just a sinner saved by grace i am just your brother that's it you know if i want to be anything higher than that i'm going up too high i'm just your brother and god has placed a gift in me to actually minister to you to edify you to help you to be a blessing to you amen not an indictment but he says if you'll just give a cup of cold one but he says you know woe to the world because of offenses now offenses are going to come huh wouldn't it be nice if there was never no offenses nobody ever crossed you nobody ever rubbed you the wrong way you know got your goat so to speak just really that's really you know it can pop where a boss just tries to annoy you blames you for stuff you it could be anything over and over again maybe even get you fired boy now that would be really something wouldn't it it'd be a good question to ask can you say well god i don't know why you allowed this to happen but lord just forgive them forgive them huh you know what i can tell you about what's liable to happen can i tell you what's liable to happen what's liable to happen is two days later all of this comes out and the main boss finds out what he was all about and he also finds out what you're all about he says hey thomas i want you to come up here i fired him i want you to take his place that's what's liable happen when you commit your problems to god and when you fear him and you don't get your gun out and want to shoot somebody for doing your own like most people do nowadays get it to god and trust god in it have respect how many ways we need more respect for god amen i i remember and parts what really brought this message to me all right where i got this message to preach this tonight was i was out in my garage and i've been doing work and we've got some posts there and i was leaning up against the post like that just thinking about the lord how good he is and the honor he's really worthy of how many know he's worthy or really a whole lot more honor than when we give him the ball game they get a lot of honor car races to get a lot of honor they get a lot of respect people go crazy boy they worship their sports huh but when it comes to worship he deserves more than what we give him he deserves everything i was leaning up against there i was thinking about the respect i was thinking about how this in this world our political world nobody has one bit of respect that's why it's so tore up it don't matter if somebody's a racist or not if it's to their benefit they're going to call you a racist huh they're going to call you stuff you and that's very disrespectful huh but i was thinking about respect and respect to god and i got leaning up there and i think i thought i remembered what brother branham said that on a saturday night he much respect for god that on saturday night about 11 o'clock he would respect the sabbath so much which we know the sabbath is actually saturday but our sabbath is the first day which is sunday he respected sunday that resurrection so much until he was a sinner boy and he says well i guess it's raining it's pouring maybe it was lightning i don't know but he had to go he had muskrat traps and all of that down along the river he had fish traps i guess of some kind he says well i'm going to have to go down there and get all them fish that's on the line and get them traps all snapped because i'm not going to get one on the sabbath day he had that much respect for god i said lord help me lord help me where am i at where is my spect lord help me to have more respect for god and everything i do in the words that i say and the way that i live and the way that i dress and every conduct that i have let my life let me resp i want to respect for god because i'll tell you what everything else will fall in place and then i thought about this one more scripture i hope this is a blessing to you remember that young one servant boy came up or was it the rich young ruler might have been the rich young ruler that come up to jesus and says good master what shall i do to be saved what must i do to inherit eternal life and jesus turns and says he says there is none good but one and that is god when i thought about the disrespect that this world has just the chaos that it's in and i thought you know not only is is it can you apply it like there's none good but god but there is nothing good but god nothing is good but this respecture isn't good respect is of god right so that's good love is of god's good everything that's good is of god without without you know unless it's you know if it's good then it's of god if it's bad you know there's just nothing else there's nothing else you're not nothing good except god should i say amen that's respect is just one of the things that comes from god love is one of the things that comes from god love your love will make you put yourself in other people's shoes it'll help you to be understanding it'll help you to have compassion it'll make you to be forgiving and loving you won't hold grudges you won't have bitterness none of those things have any place in a person's heart amen amen both here and out there listen i truly believe that even around the message people are losing their respect for almighty god and that's why they are getting further and further away from god amen and i'll tell you this it'll be only the grace of god that holds you that keeps you that tells you hey you're not what you should be you don't have respect for god like you should amen i think our 30 minutes earlier and so forth and coming here it's just one sign of where we're at hello it's just a sign that's right because even me you know because sometimes i you know a real sacrifice is to get up and go when you don't feel like it how about we all do what we feel like huh we wouldn't come to church half the time would be a whole lot we don't do but you just don't do that we should be taught not to have more respect than that have more respect than just to do what your body feels like doing do what the holy spirit tells you to do amen amen god bless you we're gonna let you out five minutes early how's that sound let's stand amen let's stand let's bow our heads and let's go before the lord and as we bow our heads i think about malachi i believe it's the first chapter and god says you know a servant has a respect for his master a son has a respect for his father and so forth but he says where's my honor where's my respect i wonder how many tonight just look in your heart and realize you know i have lost my respect my reverence for god and i want it back right here and right now and it's raised my hands to god give it back to me lord i want that respect for you lord jesus because i know that with respect for you everything that could possibly be good will come into my heart it'll fill and saturate me lord but if i lose my reverence for you god things will just get worse i'll get worse my attitude will get worse my life will get worse oh my it's just well it's a terrible world to live lord you see every hand tonight jesus lord give me more respect for you my hand is up lord i just ask god that you help me father your servant just to have a much greater respect for you father and i thank you lord for helping me take more time just to read and pray and not just come 30 minutes early to church but to take time out in the day to meditate upon you to pray to you lord to find a place to find a feedback to find a salt bag something out in the garage just somewhere hideaway just to drop on my knees and say lord here i am i love you lord i worship you father you're such an awesome god all good things come from you and so rarely that we actually take a moment and worship you and praise you and thank you for all that you do and have done lord and we get so caught up in the things of this world and in the cares of life and god we give it respect we give so much respect to so many other things that don't mean anything really don't bring us joy there's only one thing that brings us joy that is to be right with you to have the holy spirit in our heart to be able to go home tonight having confessed all of our wrongs and made everything right leaving for lord and being able to say boy it sure did feel good to be in the house of god lord i feel all scoured out god i've repented tonight of all my my failures my shortcomings lord and i believe everything in my heart is right i'll be able to sleep a good night's sleep and i thank god for a good most treasured peace of mind lord a clear conscience to be able to rest and say god if i should die before i wake i pray thee lord my soul to take and to know that we have peace with god and that we've respected you and we've honored you god i ask draw us all closer here father amen and on the digital world we ask god each one listening lord help us to make a change in our life lord give us a closer walk with you a deeper respect for you and for your word we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen thank you lord jesus thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah yes lord jesus just speak the hearts you know our heart you know where we're at lord let's come in a special way speak to us minister to us by your spirit sweep over our soul just now come into the chamber be free holy spirit speak to me softly as i close the door heavenly lover let thy presence hover she kind of unending amen lord just come in a special way we love you lord thank you for this wednesday night lord thank you for this day lord that you have given us lord
