[35:11] different things that's going around
[35:13] right now amen

[35:16] get on people for not coming to church
[35:18] but when you're sick that's where we
[35:19] want you to be just hang out amen
[35:22] because we don't want to spread this
[35:23] stuff anymore and we have to amen
[35:25] so we appreciate each one coming out
[35:27] tonight and those that are on radio land
[35:30] i'm going to have to find out just the
[35:32] proper word for that brother and on
[35:34] on the internet i guess well
[35:36] well it's not facebook but anyway
[35:39] online all right goes online god bless
[35:42] you amen uh all the different names we
[35:45] could name amen especially our elderly
[35:48] amen and so
[35:50] amen we don't mind
[35:52] those that are sick and and and those
[35:54] that can't come
[35:55] to watch but we do want everybody to
[35:57] come that possibly can amen
[35:59] so let's just bow our heads go before
[36:01] the lord in prayer kind heavenly father
[36:03] we come before you lord jesus we're
[36:05] thankful lord jesus
[36:06] to know you lord and we just come here
[36:09] father to search our hearts lord to see
[36:10] where we are with you lord as job
[36:14] said lord to present ourselves before
[36:16] your lord and see lord jesus where you
[36:18] need to work on us and
[36:21] what we need to change father to become
[36:23] a better people for serving lord and we
[36:26] ask god that you just touched mike the
[36:27] lord in a special way father i know he's
[36:29] just calmed down sick this morning and
[36:31] we ask god for healing for him lord
[36:32] jesus and the different ones mentioned
[36:34] and lord we ask god most of all that
[36:36] you'll come in a special way and give us
[36:38] the inspiration to speak your word
[36:40] that we need to hear father that would
[36:42] draw us closer to you lord jesus
[36:44] and lord i feel like you've laid this on
[36:46] my heart about a week ago lord jesus and
[36:48] you just kind of stayed there and i
[36:50] believe that's just what you want me to
[36:51] speak on tonight so we ask god that you
[36:54] just help us lord to minister you to
[36:56] your people
[36:57] and to edify the body of jesus christ
[36:59] tonight lord we love you and we
[37:01] appreciate your father in jesus christ's
[37:03] name we ask these blessings amen turn
[37:06] your bibles if you will to hebrews
[37:08] the 11th chapter and i want to speak on
[37:10] something that each and every one of us
[37:14] amen
[37:15] desire amen is that all right
[37:19] i would hope so anyway i believe that
[37:20] each and every one of us has a desire
[37:22] for what we're going to speak about
[37:24] amen and uh
[37:27] so i believe it certainly applies to us
[37:29] it applies to the time that we're living
[37:31] in today that we're living in
[37:34] amen and i believe it is very timely
[37:37] amen i appreciate danny's message and
[37:40] i'll tell you what i believe there's a
[37:41] lot in there and i i kind of this kind
[37:43] of derived from what he had talked about
[37:46] i got to thinking about the things that
[37:47] he had said
[37:48] so much until i got a message in my own
[37:51] amen
[37:52] so amen i i just love it amen
[37:55] so praise the lord hebrews 11 and we'll
[38:00] begin with
[38:02] or just read one one verse
[38:05] well let's read both of these verses 5
[38:07] and 6 hebrews 11
[38:10] 5 and 6.
[38:12] by faith enoch was translated that he
[38:14] should not see death
[38:16] and was not found because god had
[38:18] translated him for before his
[38:20] translation he had this testimony that
[38:24] he pleased god
[38:25] but without faith it is impossible to
[38:27] please him for he that cometh to god
[38:29] must believe that he is and that he is a
[38:32] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[38:34] him amen
[38:35] i wasn't going to read this but i think
[38:37] i will it just comes to mind let's turn
[38:40] to
[38:41] ii thessalonians
[38:43] amen 2 thessalonians
[38:46] [Applause]
[38:54] 1st thessalonians first thessalonians
[38:57] 4.
[39:06] verse 15 for this we say unto you
[39:10] by the word of the lord
[39:11] that we which are alive and remain unto
[39:14] the coming of the lord
[39:15] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[39:18] for the lord himself shall descend from
[39:20] heaven
[39:21] with a shout and with the voice of the
[39:22] archangel and with the trump of god
[39:25] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[39:28] amen praise the lord now
[39:31] i hope that everybody can believe and
[39:34] find yourself in this verse right here
[39:37] then we which are alive and remain shall
[39:40] be caught up together with them
[39:43] in the clouds to meet the lord in the
[39:45] air and so shall we ever be with the
[39:49] lord amen may god had this blessing
[39:51] reading of the word you can be seated
[39:53] amen tonight i want to speak on a closer
[39:58] wall amen
[40:00] amen so how many believes that
[40:02] that's the
[40:04] desire of everybody here tonight is
[40:06] to have a closer walk with god i didn't
[40:10] bother looking it up but i do remember
[40:12] brother branham saying to an older
[40:13] couple in their 80s i believe it was you
[40:15] mentioned you look at this brother he
[40:17] says and if i would ask them if what
[40:19] they would desire he says you know they
[40:20] would say no doubt would be a closer
[40:23] walk with god
[40:24] so even when we are if i get to be 80
[40:27] years old it'll still be a desire that i
[40:30] have
[40:31] no matter how old we get we always
[40:33] desire a close walk
[40:37] how many knows we can get closer to god
[40:40] we certainly can amen and we're trying
[40:42] by the help of the lord to do that every
[40:44] day
[40:45] and uh scientifically
[40:48] uh we we get we're getting closer to the
[40:50] lord's all the time
[40:53] amen as far as time wise is that right
[40:58] you know i mean let's just say
[41:01] you know he's going to come in 2023 and
[41:04] august the
[41:05] 23rd right 220 2023 this is what 2022
[41:10] already hard to believe in it
[41:12] we're way down this road and you know
[41:14] the thing that jesus said about it is
[41:16] that he's going to come in a time when
[41:18] people
[41:19] don't think he's coming
[41:21] right he'll come in the unexpected time
[41:23] for people
[41:25] that are not watching for him
[41:27] i don't believe he'll come an unexpected
[41:29] time for people that are watching and
[41:30] waiting
[41:31] amen
[41:33] and the other aspect let me just bring
[41:34] the other point of this out this other
[41:36] point of this is is you know
[41:42] to actually
[41:44] believe that you'll escape
[41:47] perhaps by the grace of god
[41:49] those that make the rapture will
[41:51] actually escape where god says that day
[41:54] you will surely die
[41:56] amen how many knows death is really sure
[41:58] for humanity
[41:59] there's only a very few that have not
[42:03] tasted death
[42:05] right
[42:06] a very few that have not tasted death
[42:09] elijah was random right
[42:11] who was the other one
[42:15] enoch and inaudible
[42:16] those two that i know of there may be
[42:18] another one that's all i can think of
[42:20] right now amen but just two people and
[42:22] then
[42:23] those that are in our age you and i
[42:27] believe that we're going to be amongst
[42:28] those is that right you actually not
[42:31] have to taste of that not have to go
[42:33] through that struggle
[42:35] right
[42:36] you know and i'll i'll never forget
[42:38] whenever i watch brother ivan pass away
[42:40] was right there with him by his side and
[42:42] amen if i think it was 12 o'clock
[42:44] somewhere in there and
[42:46] if i'd have known this that close to
[42:48] death i'd never come back home that
[42:49] night but
[42:50] anyway
[42:51] whether william called me and said he
[42:53] was pretty close i came right back up
[42:54] that night but you know the struggle the
[42:57] the struggle that you go through the the
[42:59] pain so to speak and and
[43:02] and death struggle and i was like well
[43:04] you know all of life ain't so bad but
[43:06] when it comes to death this is the worst
[43:08] part
[43:10] because you never know how you're gonna
[43:11] go you don't know if you're gonna be
[43:12] blowed up but you don't know and uh you
[43:14] know if you're gonna some of them blow
[43:16] up you know perhaps because the little
[43:18] liver don't work at this side or the
[43:19] other like but ivan did others we've
[43:21] watched until they become skin and bones
[43:25] until there's just a skeleton there and
[43:27] they'd finally die you know and it's
[43:29] that struggle and so forth and you know
[43:31] we hope by the grace of god that god
[43:33] will have mercy on us that perhaps we'll
[43:35] escape that amen we'll not have to go
[43:38] through that because we know the
[43:39] scripture tells us that there is a
[43:41] people that's going to be alive and
[43:43] remain
[43:45] right until the coming of the lord and
[43:47] every hour every year every month every
[43:50] week every hour and every time the clock
[43:53] ticks
[43:55] you're gonna you're getting closer to
[43:57] god
[43:59] amen
[44:01] everybody is
[44:03] everybody is because how many knows
[44:05] everybody has an appointment with jesus
[44:09] everybody has an appointment with him
[44:14] wouldn't he like that shout that up in
[44:16] the white house and all those
[44:17] unbelievers
[44:19] hey everyone
[44:21] got an appointment with jesus whether
[44:24] you like it or not
[44:26] you're gonna
[44:27] meet jesus
[44:29] revelation 1 says every eye shall behold
[44:31] him every knee shall bow every tongue
[44:33] will confess to jesus christ everybody's
[44:36] going to have a time it's just that by
[44:39] god's grace we plan on meeting him first
[44:43] there's those who meet him sooner
[44:45] and there's those who meet me later
[44:48] now we know that those who are not in
[44:50] christ don't go in the rapture aren't a
[44:52] part of the bride of christ that general
[44:54] first resurrection we know that they
[44:56] wait
[44:57] in a nightmare
[44:59] for a thousand years
[45:02] now right because the bible says the
[45:04] rest of the dead live not until the
[45:07] thousand years are expired
[45:10] amen and then after that comes the white
[45:12] throne judgment death hell the sea
[45:17] the grave everything it all
[45:20] gave up instead they all come and stand
[45:22] before the judgment of god
[45:25] my so they have an appointment but i'll
[45:27] tell you what there's a glorious
[45:28] appointment and that's for those who are
[45:31] waiting for him
[45:32] even jesus said blessed are those who
[45:34] see him and wait for him and pray watch
[45:36] and pray amen
[45:39] it'll be a blessed thankful that i'm
[45:41] watching
[45:42] you know i was thinking how many times
[45:44] the bible tells us
[45:46] that blessed is he whose mind is stayed
[45:49] on thee and then he hit on that talking
[45:51] about we've got so much time for
[45:53] everything else
[45:56] huh
[45:58] and you know no matter how much we work
[46:00] now how much you know and
[46:02] on monday i think it was the next day i
[46:04] thought lord you know i want to practice
[46:06] what the preacher preached
[46:08] you know i i don't i want to be a doer
[46:10] of the word and not just a hearer
[46:13] how can i constantly have my mind on
[46:16] with me
[46:18] how can i meditate on thee day and night
[46:24] and i had about five six different
[46:26] places i had to go i had to go to bed i
[46:27] had to come back here you know because i
[46:29] have such a good memory
[46:32] i love my good memory
[46:35] you know and i thought you know i got to
[46:36] go down to the church and i got to get
[46:38] my phone because i left it down there
[46:40] because i forgot to bring it along i'm
[46:42] really good at remembering what i forgot
[46:46] anyway that says you know but i'm gonna
[46:48] drive from russellville to here and then
[46:50] i just focus on the lord let me think
[46:52] about the lord well what in the world
[46:54] are you gonna think about all this well
[46:56] how can you keep your mind stayed on him
[46:59] all the time and but you know when i go
[47:01] in there i'm gonna have to get my mind
[47:03] off the lord i'm gonna have to think
[47:04] about where my phone is
[47:06] and after that i gotta go to tw you
[47:08] gotta do this at the other now i'm going
[47:09] to have to do business you know in
[47:11] between each time lord help me to just
[47:13] keep focused
[47:14] keep thinking about the lord
[47:17] you know by by the end of the day we did
[47:19] all kinds of things went back home and
[47:20] says you know we're looking for flooring
[47:22] for to put flooring down in our new
[47:23] addition and everything and we had
[47:25] gotten some up here in town here and a
[47:27] guy went home and it just didn't match
[47:29] my wife was happy with it but i wasn't
[47:31] happy with it and that's rare you know
[47:32] when you're not happy with what your
[47:34] wife is happy with
[47:35] but anyway and
[47:37] i just not writing so we said let's go
[47:39] to bowling green and and we went off the
[47:41] bowling green and
[47:42] we'll go head over there come to the
[47:44] light there and i said you know tommy's
[47:46] dad's got a store down there
[47:48] you know i think i'll just stop there
[47:49] and see what he's got but before we went
[47:52] there i believe we went through derrick
[47:54] through burger king you know and went
[47:56] through burger king and uh you know and
[47:58] got some food and so forth and and uh
[48:02] you know tried to keep thinking about
[48:04] the lord and and here i get ahead of
[48:06] myself but you know there's you'd be
[48:08] amazed
[48:10] if david was testimony david said
[48:12] something about he would meditate on
[48:14] god's testimonies
[48:16] right so if you want to know what there
[48:18] is to think about there's millions of
[48:19] things to think about i don't care if
[48:21] it's david and wife you know
[48:23] but i might what come to my mind we'll
[48:25] get back to burger king in a minute but
[48:26] what come to my mind was hattie wright
[48:29] lord i think i got to think about god's
[48:31] testimony had it right you know she had
[48:33] no doubt she thought on the lord no that
[48:35] she had to walk with the lord amen when
[48:37] god brother man talked about those
[48:39] squirrels that were created you know
[48:40] that he spoke into exists and and so
[48:42] forth and he said that ain't nothing but
[48:45] the truth
[48:46] i mean she said the right word because
[48:48] her mind was in the right place if our
[48:51] mind was in the right place right
[48:53] and then then we would say the right
[48:55] word and as a result of the saying the
[48:57] right word
[48:59] we will receive a
[49:00] reward good things come to those who say
[49:03] the right thing i mean i was a little we
[49:05] could all use a little help and saying
[49:07] the right thing
[49:08] and you'll do the right thing to say the
[49:10] right thing if you meditate on the right
[49:12] thing if you think about the right
[49:14] thing amen but that was just thinking
[49:17] about lord thank you for everything and
[49:19] and so that you know we went there and
[49:22] we got up to the door and we had our of
[49:24] course we took our weimar and her dog
[49:25] along and and you know he was up there
[49:28] and that young man in there says oh what
[49:29] a beautiful dog what a beautiful that's
[49:31] a really nice oh i said you don't have a
[49:33] pup cup for him
[49:35] you know every single time he goes or
[49:36] die or dairy queen we got to get them a
[49:38] pup cup
[49:39] and anyway he said no i don't but i'll
[49:42] get you a little cup yeah i'll get you a
[49:44] little right that dude you know
[49:46] and uh i said all right well we had done
[49:49] went up there up to the front window and
[49:50] i said how much he said i forget it and
[49:52] i'm just well thank you for the free ice
[49:54] cream that's hey how about getting me
[49:56] one
[49:57] charge me one would you he says i'll
[49:58] just get you one two because i got two
[50:01] free ice creams i said well thank you
[50:02] lord thanks for really going good here
[50:06] yeah i thought about it you know what
[50:07] are you thinking about the lord you
[50:08] never know what god's gonna do something
[50:10] good amen
[50:11] how many how many remembers but abraham
[50:13] told them the story when the atmosphere
[50:14] of the holy spirit come down in the car
[50:16] i think brother biscuit was with him
[50:18] right amen and i don't know if there was
[50:20] a moose or whatever elk or something
[50:22] there and he says every time he comes
[50:25] something good always happened
[50:29] how many believes that in your life that
[50:31] when he comes there's always something
[50:33] good that happens
[50:36] amen so
[50:38] i like that it's just it's just awesome
[50:39] how many knows i believe we could all
[50:41] use less i believe we could all use a
[50:43] closer walk
[50:44] because what a closer walk is is deeper
[50:47] fellowship with him i believe that
[50:49] close your fellowship with him
[50:52] how many could use more fellowship a
[50:54] closer fellowship another like adam had
[50:57] fellowship with him eve had fellowship
[50:59] with him before the fall
[51:00] [Music]
[51:02] amen how many know the prophet says we
[51:05] have the right to have the same
[51:06] fellowship they had before the fall
[51:10] oh my
[51:11] i'm just going to say this before i go
[51:14] on our little road trip but you know i i
[51:18] got to thinking about how that god
[51:20] worked on the prophet right
[51:22] and god is working on you and me
[51:25] god didn't trust brother branham was
[51:27] just tell that young couple whatever you
[51:29] want
[51:30] and it'll happen to him
[51:32] you know what that is
[51:34] that is absolute
[51:36] power
[51:40] how many knows he said cease to exist
[51:44] those folks would have vanished
[51:47] whatever he said
[51:49] would have happened
[51:51] because that voice that he heard that
[51:52] wasn't no bluff that wasn't the devil
[51:54] that was god telling him say what you
[51:56] want
[51:58] huh
[51:59] but god had rather brought brother brown
[52:01] into such a walk with him until he could
[52:04] trust him with absolute
[52:06] power
[52:09] oh my how about that tonight how am i
[52:11] doing that challenge is to say lord can
[52:13] you trust me
[52:14] have i got the kind of character that if
[52:16] i was presented with that situation i
[52:18] have such a close walk with god i am so
[52:20] much like christ until i will say the
[52:23] right thing and not the wrong thing
[52:27] huh
[52:28] because i believe that's where you got
[52:29] to be before god's going to give you
[52:30] that kind of power
[52:33] power power without character is satanic
[52:37] and he's not going to have you run
[52:38] around devilish
[52:40] now he's going to have you run around
[52:41] godly and
[52:43] and this is one thing that we're that
[52:45] i've learned in life
[52:46] and that is that
[52:48] you have each and one of us
[52:51] here and everywhere you have to ask
[52:54] yourself of one serious question
[52:57] and that is
[52:58] how am
[53:00] i
[53:02] really
[53:04] because i'm here to tell you there's a
[53:05] lot of christians a lot of folks that
[53:07] think there's so
[53:08] much away and they still got a lot of
[53:11] things in them
[53:12] that is not good
[53:14] huh
[53:15] when you take a good look at yourself
[53:18] you'll see those things the holy spirit
[53:19] will show you those things that are not
[53:21] good
[53:23] no
[53:25] that's
[53:26] right
[53:28] he does me i hope he does you
[53:30] that's not good this is not good you
[53:32] know because people just think they're
[53:34] better than what they really are most of
[53:36] the time
[53:37] and unless you take a good look but god
[53:39] is real god is working on us and getting
[53:42] us closer to him
[53:44] so anyway so then we went over after the
[53:46] after the you know the it's a free ice
[53:48] cream
[53:49] went over to the store down there and
[53:52] and we was looking at something the
[53:54] match and i wanted a thicker grade i
[53:55] wanted a six on an eight or ten
[53:58] millimeter thick rubber you know
[54:00] planking and so forth and and and all i
[54:02] had was a five and it was so skinny i
[54:04] said man i'm gonna walk on that twice as
[54:06] much as i was gonna unsnap real quick
[54:09] like and i can't have that i want
[54:10] something thicker you know but anyway we
[54:12] found the color
[54:13] that we liked and we came here which was
[54:15] over there and it says oh i like that
[54:16] color right there and i was like i don't
[54:19] really like it and she flipped over page
[54:21] and we brought a tile along that we're
[54:23] trying to match the floor up with it
[54:24] well in the second page he was twice as
[54:26] good as the one i was looking at
[54:28] and sure enough you know i mean it was
[54:30] like so many thousand dollars i thought
[54:32] well this is gonna be a bunch of
[54:33] thousand dollars for this thick stuff
[54:34] this high quality 35 year warranty and
[54:37] all this other stuff you know
[54:38] and then when he told us the price well
[54:40] that's what we're giving for the thin
[54:41] stuff well praise be the guy we found
[54:43] our flooring didn't have to go all the
[54:45] way to bowling green this is that's just
[54:46] how god works thank you jesus
[54:49] amen how he believes that things just go
[54:50] so much better not that they can't go
[54:53] bad amen
[54:54] but still
[54:56] if you're walking with god
[54:59] it's okay
[55:00] i mean how many loves the lord
[55:05] so praise the lord god is good
[55:08] and you can imagine
[55:12] you know you have to just ask yourself
[55:15] the question
[55:17] what
[55:17] kind of a man what was it that about
[55:21] enoch
[55:23] that caused him to
[55:25] please god and that god would actually
[55:28] translate him
[55:29] now the bible also says that noah walked
[55:31] with god
[55:33] in genesis 6 i think it is somewhere
[55:35] there i've got to wrote down here we
[55:36] won't go to it but he not with god noah
[55:38] walk with god
[55:39] moses no doubt walk with god there's
[55:41] many men that walk with god but in enoch
[55:43] please god that's the one thing that he
[55:45] did
[55:48] how many knows it's not about pleasing
[55:50] the pastor it's not about pleasing your
[55:52] wife your husband or anybody else it's
[55:53] about pleasing god
[55:56] all those other things will take their
[55:57] place if your heart's desire is to
[56:00] please god
[56:03] he so pleased god until god changed him
[56:06] in the atoms
[56:08] and you and i are living in the age
[56:10] welcome the lord could come many times
[56:11] so that's going to be our question is
[56:14] are you so pleasing to god that he's
[56:16] gonna change your mortal body
[56:20] that's a good question isn't it
[56:23] i thought lord
[56:24] i don't see any way
[56:27] that we're gonna be pleasing to him
[56:28] unless we truly have our mind stayed on
[56:31] him
[56:32] until we have our focus on god because
[56:34] i'll tell you what we can how many knows
[56:36] we can get so busy with work until our
[56:38] mind is on work so much
[56:42] huh that we actually blackslide
[56:45] work or anything else it can be on
[56:47] something else but mostly you know
[56:49] because i don't know about you but i i'm
[56:50] a workaholic
[56:52] i like to work
[56:54] you can tell well i don't know if my
[56:56] hands show it or not but usually a man's
[56:57] hand shows whether he loves to work or
[56:59] not
[57:01] love the work
[57:04] most of us do right
[57:05] we've learned to
[57:08] but sometimes we get so busy until we
[57:10] don't have our mind on the lord like we
[57:12] should amen
[57:14] but no doubt
[57:15] and i think this is so true folks that
[57:18] it is i'll just this is a statement i
[57:20] wanted to make from that thought was
[57:21] that it is more important that we that
[57:24] we spend time with god than it is that
[57:27] we work as much as what we do
[57:29] so i'm at the place i'm at the place
[57:31] lord if i'm going to have a closer walk
[57:33] with you
[57:34] then get lord help me to slow down help
[57:36] me to cut some things out of my life
[57:39] to where i have more time for god
[57:42] and even if i get so busy that i've got
[57:44] 10 different things i got to do in a day
[57:46] like i said
[57:48] when i get here look i want to get my
[57:49] mind right back on you lord right back
[57:51] on you right back on you after each one
[57:54] keep in mind stayed on you
[57:57] amen help me to keep meditating on him
[58:01] day and night so i'm going to ask you
[58:03] another question since we've heard that
[58:05] we believe it was of the lord
[58:06] that
[58:08] a man that's going to be like a tree
[58:10] that's planted by the rivers of water
[58:11] he's the kind of man that meditates on
[58:13] his law and his and his delight is upon
[58:15] him day and night
[58:18] has it changed have you changed any have
[58:20] you made any changes
[58:22] or was that just a nice little message
[58:24] we heard
[58:28] i thought you know i preach about well
[58:30] let's not just be hears of the word but
[58:32] doers of the word it's a whole lot
[58:33] better to live as herman and lord help
[58:35] me do this i don't want to just think
[58:36] about it or have it go through my mind
[58:38] it's not just a good thought it's
[58:39] something that we have to apply to our
[58:41] lives
[58:44] that everything that we think about
[58:48] as much as possible now how many knows
[58:50] you got to take care of your family
[58:53] sure you got to take care of your family
[58:54] you can't be uh worse than the infidel
[58:57] uh because even in paul's day they that
[59:00] people you know got so spiritual so to
[59:03] speak they didn't even work
[59:05] and paul had to say look if a man don't
[59:07] work then he shouldn't need
[59:11] that's right you gotta take you gotta
[59:12] keep your balance on things
[59:14] but still
[59:16] our heart and our minds is on him
[59:19] elijah how many knows that elijah must
[59:22] have pleased god
[59:24] amen elijah was so close to god until
[59:27] what
[59:30] horses and chariot came
[59:32] and picked him up
[59:36] huh
[59:38] what was it the prophet said about
[59:40] flying saucers
[59:43] didn't he say it's one of these days one
[59:44] of them things to come down and pick you
[59:46] up
[59:48] he called it investigating angels didn't
[59:50] he
[59:51] he said those are investigating angels
[59:53] and we've heard not so long ago i heard
[59:55] the government talking about people are
[59:57] seeing stuff people are seeing stuff
[59:59] now i know if they keep it quiet or what
[1:00:01] but i wouldn't be one bit surprised we
[1:00:02] need to there's a whole lot of public
[1:00:05] investigating on going on there's
[1:00:07] probably angels coming and visiting all
[1:00:09] the time and saying is it as bad as what
[1:00:11] we're hearing here huh they're finding
[1:00:15] out yeah it's worse
[1:00:17] it's getting so bad
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:22] you know i want to say this that it's
[1:00:24] getting so bad and living in this world
[1:00:26] is so bad
[1:00:27] until you have to actually shut your
[1:00:29] mind off of it
[1:00:31] if you was to think about it all time
[1:00:33] and focus on it all the time you'd be
[1:00:35] depressed
[1:00:36] i'd be depressed if i got to thinking
[1:00:38] about how how terrible it is and that's
[1:00:40] why the keeping up with politics and all
[1:00:43] that knowing everything that goes on
[1:00:44] that doesn't really benefit you a whole
[1:00:46] lot
[1:00:47] it really don't lift you up
[1:00:49] amen because why it's all bad
[1:00:53] why is it that people love bad news
[1:00:55] rather than good news
[1:00:58] they meant this place probably be full
[1:00:59] of everybody like good news
[1:01:02] amen
[1:01:03] but think about elijah how a chariot
[1:01:05] came up he walked so close to god until
[1:01:07] a chariot
[1:01:08] amen come down and pick them up and took
[1:01:10] him to heaven
[1:01:12] that's what you and i
[1:01:14] are believing that god's going to do for
[1:01:16] me and you
[1:01:18] but we have to come to that place where
[1:01:20] god can do it right
[1:01:22] i think brother bam says you know that
[1:01:23] before
[1:01:24] uh the andaluvian destruction people had
[1:01:27] to get into the spirit of that
[1:01:29] destruction they had to get in the
[1:01:31] spirit of wickedness and lewdness and so
[1:01:33] forth
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:37] because what their minds was
[1:01:40] only evil the bible says continuously
[1:01:44] continuously evil
[1:01:48] but that's not where our mind is
[1:01:50] supposed to be
[1:01:52] in philippians 4 and 8
[1:01:54] i want to
[1:01:56] do something that i kind of picked off
[1:01:58] of what brother bad had
[1:02:00] brought about what was it the devil's
[1:02:03] beatitudes
[1:02:05] i want to i want to take this and i
[1:02:06] wrote this on the back of my note here
[1:02:08] and i'll read it to you
[1:02:12] but god wants us
[1:02:15] to think about good things finally
[1:02:17] brethren whatsoever things are true
[1:02:19] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:02:21] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:02:23] pure
[1:02:24] whatsoever things are lovely
[1:02:28] i think i missed that one whatsoever
[1:02:29] things are of good report if there be
[1:02:31] any virtue if there be any praise think
[1:02:33] on these things
[1:02:35] you know and i don't think the devil
[1:02:37] calls him brethren i was just going to
[1:02:38] say the devil says to his children
[1:02:40] finally children
[1:02:42] whatsoever things are deceptive and
[1:02:44] false
[1:02:45] whatsoever things are dishonest cheating
[1:02:48] and lying and stealing
[1:02:50] whatsoever things are unjust
[1:02:53] whatsoever things are impure and vile
[1:02:56] whatever is a bad report
[1:03:00] whatever is very unlovely
[1:03:02] if there be any not virtue which is
[1:03:05] strength but if there be any weakness
[1:03:08] if there be anything to complain about
[1:03:11] instead of praise
[1:03:13] huh if there be any praise because
[1:03:16] that's when you are thankful for
[1:03:18] something and
[1:03:19] and you praise somebody for something
[1:03:20] you know
[1:03:22] but it is if there be anything to
[1:03:24] complain about or to talk about
[1:03:27] to murmur about
[1:03:30] think
[1:03:31] about these things that's what the devil
[1:03:34] says
[1:03:35] because he certainly did the eve didn't
[1:03:37] he
[1:03:39] he got to think about a little white lie
[1:03:41] 99 truth
[1:03:43] but it was still a lie
[1:03:46] korah remember the devil come to core
[1:03:48] and told him you know
[1:03:49] moses he's such a big shot you know and
[1:03:52] and there's a whole lot more holy people
[1:03:54] than just him
[1:03:55] god uses us too you know
[1:03:58] huh
[1:03:59] it was a devil's side wasn't god's
[1:04:01] thought
[1:04:02] never got into cora's mind
[1:04:05] and what did he do he polluted him
[1:04:07] corrupted him
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:11] how many beliefs of mind is the womb to
[1:04:13] the soul
[1:04:15] i believe we have to protect this right
[1:04:16] here
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:20] what did paul say he says bringing every
[1:04:23] thought
[1:04:24] captive to the word of god
[1:04:29] because the second you open up the
[1:04:31] channel of your mind
[1:04:33] huh
[1:04:34] but says before a man will cheat on his
[1:04:36] wife wife on earth
[1:04:38] it first happens in the air
[1:04:40] you open up the thought first
[1:04:43] once that thought comes in and you
[1:04:45] accept that thought say i'd like that or
[1:04:47] i want to do that that's the first thing
[1:04:49] you think before it ever happens
[1:04:52] then all the rest takes place after that
[1:04:54] amen
[1:04:55] before you have to you think on anything
[1:04:58] impure you have to override that
[1:04:59] conscience and say
[1:05:01] you know the conscience says i throw
[1:05:03] that away amen don't open the door
[1:05:07] amen he did to israel he did decorah he
[1:05:10] did the eve
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:13] got them all to do things they shouldn't
[1:05:16] do
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:19] think about paul
[1:05:22] paul
[1:05:24] how many knows he walked close to god
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:28] it wasn't time for a rapture
[1:05:31] because i believe if there's anybody
[1:05:32] time anybody that would have been ready
[1:05:34] to go it would have been paul
[1:05:37] how many knows that
[1:05:39] if you lived in any other age
[1:05:41] any other age down there
[1:05:43] you had no you had no promise
[1:05:46] of a rapture
[1:05:49] that's now what i mean by that is
[1:05:52] a physical rapture from hero now we know
[1:05:54] that there's a they got a rapture coming
[1:05:56] they're going to be caught up
[1:05:58] aiming in the air just like we are
[1:06:01] i mean that means to be caught up is a
[1:06:02] rapture but we which ivan remained
[1:06:06] we have a promise in this hour that at
[1:06:08] the time of his coming
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:12] that's when there's a promise of a
[1:06:14] rapture those that are still alive
[1:06:16] why because god's not going to wait
[1:06:17] until you spend your another 25 30 years
[1:06:21] our little children or we're not going
[1:06:23] to wait till they are 70 at their
[1:06:24] appointed time
[1:06:26] no god's going to say time's up that
[1:06:28] last number that last name is redeemed
[1:06:31] and those that are still here here alive
[1:06:33] he says i'll just translate them and
[1:06:35] we'll all go up
[1:06:39] folks if that don't make you happy if
[1:06:42] that don't make you happy to think that
[1:06:43] hey you have that promise
[1:06:46] that's our promise that just one of
[1:06:49] these days you're going to be changed in
[1:06:51] the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:06:56] at the last trump
[1:06:58] amen will be changed
[1:07:00] i don't know
[1:07:02] i don't remember just exactly what the
[1:07:04] prophet said you'll feel a sharp pain
[1:07:06] did he say
[1:07:08] or like if some kind of a feeling will
[1:07:10] come over you
[1:07:11] something will happen and just all of a
[1:07:13] sudden
[1:07:14] huh
[1:07:16] you'll be back to young again
[1:07:18] back to 20 years old
[1:07:22] but folks i'm here to tell you
[1:07:24] it won't happen if you're not walking
[1:07:26] with god if you don't have a close
[1:07:31] walk with god
[1:07:33] my heart's desire tonight is lord
[1:07:36] i came to church
[1:07:38] people listening
[1:07:40] why
[1:07:41] because you desire
[1:07:43] a closer
[1:07:44] walk with him
[1:07:47] a closer walk with him
[1:07:51] and i think brother danny brought it out
[1:07:52] we all know that brother brown says if
[1:07:55] you want to get closer to god there's
[1:07:56] only one way
[1:07:58] what does he say read more
[1:08:01] and
[1:08:02] pray more right
[1:08:03] that's reading his word
[1:08:05] and fellowshipping him with him
[1:08:07] on a greater scale than what you are now
[1:08:11] it cannot you can never i don't believe
[1:08:13] you can ever become a better christian
[1:08:15] unless that changes
[1:08:17] you have a closer walk with him
[1:08:19] that you think about him more
[1:08:22] that you meditate on you read the bible
[1:08:24] more how many knows if you really know
[1:08:26] if somebody is walking close to the lord
[1:08:29] it'll be because they walk close to his
[1:08:32] word
[1:08:34] this word means everything to you
[1:08:37] because this is god
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:41] so lord help us
[1:08:43] to have a close
[1:08:44] walk with him to let him look down in
[1:08:47] your heart look down in my heart
[1:08:49] and see if there's any wicked way in
[1:08:51] there yet and if there is
[1:08:53] lord take it out
[1:08:54] if there's any character that we have
[1:08:59] that's not supposed to be there
[1:09:01] lord take it out
[1:09:03] lord take it out
[1:09:05] amen
[1:09:07] and
[1:09:08] the closer you get
[1:09:11] the more it'll be like that the amen to
[1:09:13] the lord will show you where those areas
[1:09:15] are
[1:09:16] and we know our prophet was a real good
[1:09:18] example everything he did was right
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:24] so paul again
[1:09:26] what he called himself what did he call
[1:09:27] himself he called himself paul
[1:09:31] christ
[1:09:33] he was a prisoner chained had love
[1:09:35] chains on him
[1:09:37] he had suffered the lust of loss of all
[1:09:39] things
[1:09:41] that right and he was a prisoner for the
[1:09:43] sake of christ
[1:09:45] amen his joy
[1:09:47] his happiness
[1:09:49] in this life was when he would come to a
[1:09:51] church
[1:09:52] and see how it would have progressed
[1:09:55] that right
[1:09:57] they were the joy in his crown they were
[1:09:59] the joy of his life
[1:10:00] the jewels
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:05] that's what it was he walked with god he
[1:10:07] stripped himself
[1:10:09] of himself
[1:10:11] i believe that's what we got to do strip
[1:10:12] ourselves of ourselves anything that is
[1:10:15] yourself
[1:10:17] amen
[1:10:19] i got to thinking now maybe just kind of
[1:10:21] come to close with this but i got to
[1:10:23] thinking of the things that we've lost
[1:10:26] huh
[1:10:27] the things that we've lost over the
[1:10:28] years like brotherly kindness
[1:10:34] like brother brown says used to
[1:10:36] go help a neighbor if he got sick and so
[1:10:38] forth and go help him and so forth
[1:10:41] hardly ever
[1:10:43] you know
[1:10:44] and
[1:10:45] you know we don't know a neighbor is
[1:10:46] dead until
[1:10:48] you know we see it in the newspaper or
[1:10:50] whatever
[1:10:52] uh friendship how many says he believes
[1:10:54] in so many things are gone he says we're
[1:10:55] at the end of
[1:10:57] child raising family life is almost over
[1:11:00] church life he said it's gone almost
[1:11:03] you just about can't get people to come
[1:11:05] to church anyway just about gone
[1:11:07] people just
[1:11:08] don't care about god anymore
[1:11:11] huh
[1:11:13] uh
[1:11:14] marriage is almost gone friendship is
[1:11:16] almost gone
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:20] we used to how many know we people ago
[1:11:22] used to visit each other
[1:11:26] right
[1:11:27] we don't hardly do that anymore do we
[1:11:29] reach us about don't don't go visit each
[1:11:31] other anymore why you got face time you
[1:11:33] don't know what somebody's up to is go
[1:11:35] to their facebook you lay there on the
[1:11:36] bed or on your couch and say well
[1:11:38] so-and-so did this that or the other oh
[1:11:40] they're on vacation down there in
[1:11:41] florida they're over here and doing this
[1:11:43] and that that's the only fellowship we
[1:11:45] got is facebook
[1:11:47] i guess
[1:11:49] my wife watches it a little bit and
[1:11:50] she's into that more than what i am
[1:11:53] but anyway
[1:11:55] but to actually go and visit somebody
[1:11:57] and friend be with some friend or a
[1:11:59] brother or sister and i thought you know
[1:12:02] maybe i should preach on that sometime
[1:12:03] and see if we can't get some of that
[1:12:05] back amen
[1:12:07] get some of the things back
[1:12:09] but we got to start i mean believe we
[1:12:10] got to start with ourself
[1:12:13] get back with god the way we're supposed
[1:12:14] to be and then
[1:12:16] a real good relationship with our
[1:12:18] husbands wives and have a good family
[1:12:20] relationship and let it bleed over into
[1:12:22] the neighbors and to your brothers and
[1:12:25] sisters and just let it flow out because
[1:12:27] we don't have to lose those things i
[1:12:29] mean believe that we gotta lose them
[1:12:31] things they're still hours
[1:12:33] for the most part it's just that what
[1:12:35] we've lost the biggest thing that we
[1:12:37] have lost
[1:12:39] is time
[1:12:41] we just don't have time
[1:12:43] we're so busy
[1:12:45] the other night i work till 8 30.
[1:12:47] you know i got my flooring in it eight
[1:12:49] and i was trying i'm trying to get that
[1:12:51] thing place finished i'm about done with
[1:12:52] that by the way and so that's gonna be a
[1:12:54] relief for me because i'm gonna have a
[1:12:56] little more time maybe
[1:12:57] but anyway we did a
[1:13:00] 20 by 30 edition and we got the inside
[1:13:02] almost all done except for the baseboard
[1:13:05] tomorrow and and within three months so
[1:13:07] i've pushed it pretty hard last three
[1:13:08] months to try to get that done
[1:13:10] and so
[1:13:12] but i got to thinking you know lord help
[1:13:14] us where's
[1:13:16] our love where's our peace where's our
[1:13:19] compassion our brotherly kindness
[1:13:22] huh
[1:13:23] brother branham even
[1:13:25] talked about how that
[1:13:26] and i do it uh we all do it right
[1:13:29] whenever we see somebody that we know we
[1:13:30] go
[1:13:33] well not when his wife did that to
[1:13:35] somebody he says what you go just all
[1:13:37] you're going to do is give him a silly
[1:13:38] nod
[1:13:39] you say hello there or something
[1:13:42] and so forth brother and
[1:13:44] you know let me say something else i
[1:13:46] believe when a person has the holy
[1:13:47] spirit the way they should you can live
[1:13:50] life to the fullest
[1:13:53] huh
[1:13:54] everything has more meaning there's if
[1:13:56] people don't have any feeling
[1:13:58] then the bible say people will be
[1:14:00] without natural affection people are so
[1:14:02] cold-hearted
[1:14:07] until this you don't have any feelings
[1:14:09] anymore
[1:14:10] and brother branham he was close to god
[1:14:12] he had that all of that is
[1:14:14] is there and many good feelings and when
[1:14:16] you because i'll tell you what right now
[1:14:18] i i don't think there is a mortal i
[1:14:20] don't think any of us
[1:14:22] that can say well i just don't care how
[1:14:24] i feel yeah we all care about how we
[1:14:26] feel
[1:14:28] now we don't always feel good and it's
[1:14:30] at those times that we have to kind of
[1:14:31] say well it doesn't matter how bad i
[1:14:33] feel i'm going to rejoice in the lord
[1:14:35] anyway right
[1:14:36] but we all like to feel good
[1:14:40] absolutely we love to feel good
[1:14:42] and that's what the holy spirit is there
[1:14:45] for they give you peace that passes
[1:14:47] understanding joy unspeakable and full
[1:14:50] of glory people used to have so much of
[1:14:51] the joy of the lord brother john they'd
[1:14:53] run from one top of them pews to the
[1:14:55] others but let me tell you something you
[1:14:57] better not run these fuse
[1:14:59] because these will tip backwards real
[1:15:01] quick i found out you'll probably be
[1:15:03] knocking them all down we would have to
[1:15:05] fasten them to the floor for you to run
[1:15:06] on these pews
[1:15:08] well
[1:15:09] especially if you're fat like me
[1:15:12] anyway
[1:15:14] people used to have joy people lost
[1:15:16] their joy
[1:15:17] amen
[1:15:19] and how do we get any of these things
[1:15:21] back
[1:15:23] by meditating on the lord more
[1:15:25] by dedicating ourselves to god enoch
[1:15:28] i don't think i brought it and i think i
[1:15:30] have it in my book but uh in the greek
[1:15:33] lexicon it talks about enochs in the
[1:15:36] name the name enoch meaning
[1:15:38] dedication
[1:15:40] dedicated
[1:15:42] i believe that's why we got to be more
[1:15:43] it's more dedicated
[1:15:45] to the lord jesus christ any
[1:15:47] walk that has fellowship
[1:15:50] and communion
[1:15:52] with him
[1:15:53] god bless you stand with tonight if you
[1:15:55] will
[1:15:57] hey i didn't think about it but that was
[1:15:58] exactly for
[1:16:00] that's all right
[1:16:01] how many loves the lord amen how many
[1:16:03] knows that you have a desire that i want
[1:16:05] to be closer
[1:16:07] than what i am
[1:16:08] i want to be closer to the lord
[1:16:11] a closer
[1:16:13] walk
[1:16:14] with him lord jesus you see our hands
[1:16:16] tonight they're all raised lord saying
[1:16:18] father we really want desire father a
[1:16:21] closer walk with you lord
[1:16:23] and father we ask god that you would
[1:16:25] grant us just that closer walk father

[1:16:30] and not let other things to have the
[1:16:33] preeminence lord jesus but let your word
[1:16:36] have the preeminence in our hearts and
[1:16:38] in our life let your holy spirit rule
[1:16:40] and reign in our lives lord
[1:16:43] we thank you father that we can have
[1:16:45] that we thank you lord jesus and
