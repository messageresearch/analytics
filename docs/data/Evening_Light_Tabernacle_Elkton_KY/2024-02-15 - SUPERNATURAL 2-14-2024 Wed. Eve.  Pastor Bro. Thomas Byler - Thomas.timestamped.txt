[0:22] early and gone forth behold and host
[0:26] Compass the city both with horses and
[0:29] chariots and his servant said unto him
[0:31] alas my master how shall we do and he
[0:35] answered fear not for they that be with
[0:37] us are more than they that be with them
[0:40] amen I thought that would make a great
[0:42] message sometime amen they that are with
[0:45] us are more than they that are with Him
[0:47] amen praise the Lord and I Elijah prayed
[0:50] and said Lord I will pray thee open his
[0:52] eyes that he may see and the the Lord
[0:54] opened the eyes of the young man and he
[0:56] saw and behold the mountain was full of
[0:59] horses and Chariots of Fire round about
[1:03] elishah may God bless his ADD His
[1:05] blessings to the reading of the word you
[1:07] can be seated amen that's really the
[1:09] only two scriptures that I have tonight
[1:12] amen praise the
[1:14] Lord all right we're just going to do a
[1:16] little lesson tonight would that be okay
[1:19] all right let's talk about it for just a
[1:20] minute talking about the supernatural
[1:22] first of all amen not just the natural
[1:25] but the supernatural
[1:27] amen um in the world you and I live
[1:32] in we seem to think that we see so
[1:35] little Supernatural things we long to
[1:37] see Supernatural things don't we amen
[1:41] the whole world wants to see
[1:43] Supernatural things but now remember in
[1:46] the spirit realm first of all our bodies
[1:49] Our beings brother
[1:51] Bram being is that right amen one of
[1:55] them was of course your body next was
[1:58] your spirit and your soul now how many
[2:02] knows your spirit is Supernatural your
[2:04] soul is
[2:05] Supernatural so when you think about it
[2:08] if you want to talk about supernatural
[2:10] 2third of you is
[2:13] Supernatural amen we are 2/3
[2:17] Supernatural onethird oh I ain't got to
[2:19] go back there do I
[2:21] amen onethird natural amen so we're made
[2:26] that made up that way amen
[2:31] and so we we think about that how that
[2:35] you know in the spirit
[2:36] realm and then in the soul realm and
[2:39] this is actually just a house that we
[2:40] live in the real man is on the
[2:43] inside but prophet of God said said some
[2:46] things that it's kind of hard probably
[2:48] for most people to really fathom you
[2:51] know I mean I don't I don't know if any
[2:54] of the preachers before brother bam ever
[2:56] said that when you're looking at you
[2:58] you're not really seeing you
[3:01] you have never seen
[3:03] you wow that's kind of a new thing isn't
[3:06] it and statements like everything that
[3:09] you see is not
[3:10] real amen come up against people he says
[3:13] if I can't see it I don't believe it
[3:15] it's not real but says it's just the
[3:18] opposite everything you see is not real
[3:20] it's only the things that you don't see
[3:22] that's
[3:24] real amen and I want to tell you we are
[3:27] gathered here this evening this
[3:29] Wednesday night we didn't come to see
[3:30] the nice new platform here and
[3:32] everything all that that's all wonderful
[3:34] or to see each other or how we dress or
[3:37] come to see our hats or whatever it
[3:40] might be this that or the other like
[3:41] they do on Easter or what we're not
[3:42] coming to look at the out but but you
[3:44] come for one reason and that is to look
[3:48] beyond what you
[3:52] see how how many don't realize it that's
[3:55] why even the prophet of God said it's so
[3:57] important to come early come and
[4:01] pray amen how manyan know it's so
[4:04] important so many times when you pray
[4:06] when you sing when you worship I like to
[4:08] close my eyes huh a lot of time when I'm
[4:11] worshiping
[4:13] and and just why you're closing the
[4:17] Avenue you're closing the door to
[4:19] everything visible and now you're
[4:21] looking to something that you don't see
[4:23] at
[4:25] all amen cuz God is invisible ible he's
[4:31] in a different
[4:33] dimension amen so you close your eyes
[4:36] and isn't it something how even the
[4:38] prophet of God when he would be praying
[4:39] for people and amen casting out devils
[4:42] and he tells that everybody close your
[4:45] eyes close your eyes you don't want to
[4:47] see it I don't know if it it must have a
[4:50] bearing on Spirits coming into you amen
[4:55] I don't know about you but if you know
[4:57] with a big old hideous dark demon was
[5:00] coming at you I'd rather not
[5:04] know I'd rather not know I'd rather not
[5:07] have to
[5:09] fight because that fear in itself might
[5:11] allow him to come into you but close
[5:13] your eyes and just be reverent and
[5:16] humble is that right and brother bam
[5:18] take every spirit and there under his
[5:21] control for the glory of
[5:23] God as long
[5:26] as ever close your eyes like they were
[5:29] supposed to guess what them demons
[5:30] couldn't get into them people but there
[5:32] was people that were disrespectful and
[5:34] just wanted to see the whole thing ain't
[5:36] that right they end up being epileptic
[5:38] the rest of their life the whole CH
[5:40] Church a whole group of them bunch of
[5:44] people amen so it's important when you
[5:46] come to church cuz how many knows you
[5:49] had a lot of cares today you had to work
[5:52] all
[5:53] day yeah a lot of things happen and it's
[5:57] time to come to church and close your
[5:59] eyes to all of
[6:00] that cuz when you come here we want to
[6:03] set an
[6:04] atmosphere create an atmosphere of Faith
[6:08] because you're now remember this that's
[6:10] where you get your strength from that's
[6:13] where all your power everything that you
[6:15] have all the strength that you have
[6:17] spiritually comes from you being shut in
[6:20] with God when you get shut in with God
[6:23] you shut everything else out and the
[6:26] more you can do that the better off
[6:28] you're going to be
[6:29] [Applause]
[6:32] amen the stronger you will
[6:36] be everything you see is not
[6:38] real everything everything is not real
[6:42] everything you do not see is
[6:45] real even all of our Weaponry all of our
[6:49] spiritual Weaponry something that you do
[6:52] not see with your
[6:54] eyes amen Peter he wanted to fight a
[6:57] battle he pulled the sword didn't he he
[7:00] went he says no no this our battle is
[7:03] not of this world we're not of this
[7:04] world of another world is that right the
[7:06] battle we have is by faith man you know
[7:09] one of the two greatest weapons three
[7:12] greatest I think he hear said three
[7:14] greatest weapons in God's Arsenal is one
[7:17] is Faith because it knows no defeat amen
[7:21] and love is even greater and that
[7:24] because there's nothing greater than
[7:25] love love overcomes all kinds of things
[7:29] we will try to if we have time to get
[7:30] into a little bit of that amen but talk
[7:32] talking about how that love overcomes
[7:35] hatred it overcomes bitterness and it's
[7:37] something you don't see but it's
[7:39] something that's
[7:43] real oh my but it's
[7:46] unseen amen everything about this amen
[7:50] is unseen and it's
[7:52] supernatural amen now how many knows
[7:55] that God is
[7:57] Supernatural and when he speaks she
[7:59] speaks a supernatural word but said we
[8:04] have a supernatural god with a
[8:06] supernatural seed word speaking to a
[8:10] supernatural Seed of Abraham he called
[8:13] us the supernatural
[8:15] seed amen Supernatural seed amen doing
[8:21] Supernatural
[8:23] signs amen praise the Lord one of the
[8:27] first things you know faith is something
[8:29] that's not seen that right faith is
[8:32] something that's not seen But if God
[8:34] ever brings that to you it is the
[8:37] substance of things hoped for the
[8:39] evidence of Things Not
[8:41] Seen when you begin to accept that
[8:45] Supernatural word of God God it brings
[8:49] you to a supernatural birth how many
[8:53] believe that that's inner man is a
[8:55] supernatural
[8:58] being
[8:59] amen outside of that oh my that just
[9:03] absolutely throws out everybody that
[9:05] says the days of Miracles is p no such a
[9:09] thing as the Holy Ghost well they
[9:10] apparently don't have the Holy Ghost
[9:12] today their miracles it's pasted cuz
[9:14] they ain't even got the Holy Ghost but
[9:16] when you got God on the
[9:18] inside one thing God will not do is deny
[9:21] his own
[9:23] work no no no you talk anybody that got
[9:26] the Holy Ghost they're very careful
[9:28] about what they deny
[9:31] amen but you can't deny if you got the
[9:34] Holy Ghost they say they do but they
[9:36] don't not down in the soul they don't
[9:39] you can't have the Holy Ghost and say
[9:40] the days of Miracles is passed why
[9:42] you're to oh my I was writing this down
[9:46] here I said if you claim to be the if
[9:48] you claim to be a Christian and S days
[9:49] and miracles is pth well guess what it
[9:52] took a miracle for you to get born again
[9:55] so the they has not pass how many
[9:57] believe if you get the new that's an
[9:59] absolute
[10:00] Miracle it takes a supernatural work of
[10:04] God to bring a
[10:05] birth that's why it's so important that
[10:08] every one of our children get that birth
[10:10] otherwise they ain't got an anchor on
[10:12] the inside of the inside that unseen I
[10:15] Ain got
[10:16] it and it won't hold
[10:19] him
[10:21] amen that's right a supernatural word
[10:25] praise the
[10:26] Lord Brother B talked about how that
[10:28] people
[10:29] human beings we're so curious about what
[10:32] is beyond the
[10:34] curtain what is out there and they fail
[10:37] to recognize what's out there first of
[10:39] all they Rec don't even recognize who
[10:42] they
[10:46] are anybody that's lived very long knows
[10:49] that your natural ability hello your
[10:53] natural strength and joy of natural that
[10:56] doesn't go very
[10:58] far but it's about that spirit that you
[11:00] got how many know that's what we come to
[11:03] feed we come to feed that inner man to
[11:06] feed that
[11:07] Spirit not just the
[11:10] flesh oh my listen to what brother bam
[11:12] says he Begin by saying this looking at
[11:14] the Unseen he says it is a strange thing
[11:16] that man who was made in the image and
[11:18] likeness of God and was called to walk
[11:21] with him by
[11:23] faith amen how many knows that that's
[11:25] what we live living by faith in Jesus
[11:27] above that's right believing that God is
[11:32] would choose to walk by sight instead of
[11:35] by faith he says after his makeup we're
[11:38] all made up after his makeup his being
[11:41] and all that dwells in him was fashioned
[11:44] in the likeness of God and God is that
[11:47] great Jehovah who calls those things
[11:49] which are not as though they
[11:52] were and man was made to live with God
[11:55] in that
[11:57] manner
[12:00] I mean look we were made like I read
[12:02] Sunday and me we were predestinated to
[12:04] be conformed to the image of his son we
[12:07] were made to be in the likeness of
[12:09] almighty
[12:10] God butr takes Abraham you know how that
[12:13] he had the faith of God and me calling
[12:15] those things which were not as though
[12:17] they
[12:19] were that's why when sickness come no
[12:21] matter oh my I me just say this no
[12:23] matter what your condition is don't look
[12:25] at the condition look at the word
[12:30] that's the way reason why the more you
[12:31] feed on this how many know that whenever
[12:33] what you are what you we feed on we say
[12:35] right come to church and we feed on the
[12:38] word of God and guess what it's a
[12:40] supernatural word it's going to cause
[12:43] you to be a supernatural
[12:46] person amen they shall lay hands on the
[12:48] sick and they shall
[12:50] recover oh my oh my it's so awesome is
[12:53] it they drink any de inly thing you
[12:56] shall not hurt them that's right super
[12:59] Supernatural brother B I believe it's

[13:21] God there'll be Supernatural signs and
[13:26] wonders oh my you should see them in
[13:30] your life I trust that you do and have
[13:33] is that
[13:34] right praise be to God Body Soul and
[13:38] Spirit we were made from a supernatural
[13:41] element when you're born and little baby
[13:44] coming out of the womb if you don't open
[13:45] that mouth
[13:47] and suck in that Spirit you won't
[13:52] live you'll be a dead person if you

[14:18] praise be to God hallelujah my but B
[14:23] says you know the Bible says man shall
[14:25] not live by bread
[14:27] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[14:30] out of the mouth of God and a man's
[14:32] physical being to be taken care of is
[14:36] not all the reason that God put him on
[14:38] the earth for because what he does with
[14:41] his physical being amounts to very
[14:44] [Music]
[14:46] little all the natural things that we
[14:49] are so busy every day doing really don't
[14:53] Mount to too
[14:55] much that's what I heard him say your
[14:58] physical being that's that's what's all

[16:33] everywhere he has come down in a special
[16:36] way there's a supernatural element I

[16:44] element it's what puts a smile on my
[16:47] face go
[16:48] ahead it's what puts a smile on your
[16:51] face because defeat is
[16:55] distress defeat is no peace in that
[16:59] person that's

[17:02] don't have that Supernatural amen how
[17:05] many know even if God forgives you of
[17:07] your sin it's a
[17:09] miracle it's a supernatural act for God
[17:12] to forgive you when you get on your
[17:13] knees when you close your eyes whether
[17:15] it's every day or not every night you
[17:17] say God forgive me of my sins today amen
[17:19] it's a supernatural act that comes and
[17:21] makes you feel better
[17:23] again we need more of that
[17:27] Supernatural
[17:30] that's
[17:33] right something's going on over

[17:41] happen how many believe that but said
[17:45] when the weakest
[17:47] Christian gets down on his
[17:50] knees Devils
[17:54] tremble why because Angels come and they
[17:57] Minister and they're just waiting for
[17:59] you to say something they're waiting to

[24:17] is doesn't matter how many walk with
[24:20] you we love brothers and sisters I want
[24:23] a lot of
[24:25] them but they they didn't want hold

[25:05] was already excommunicated by the
[25:06] attitude that he took then he was
[25:09] misleading his people as many as he
[25:12] could to keep them away from the sign of
[25:14] the Messiah it wasn't was what Jesus
[25:18] Christ that's who came to the pulpit it

[30:19] each and every one of us would hear that
[30:21] still Small Voice and he it each
[30:25] time amen
[30:29] we'd walk a lot better lives we'd walk a
[30:32] better walk we talk a better talk we'd

[30:49] Voice
[30:50] amen you love
[30:54] him
[30:56] amen
[30:59] I'm going to throw this in a few days
[31:01] ago this very next quote after uh he
[31:04] mentions about well let me finish this
[31:07] other
[31:07] one because what he does with his
[31:10] physical being amounts to very little
[31:13] it's his soul is what counts how many
[31:17] believe that Lord help us to realize
[31:20] it's your soul that
[31:24] counts it's the inward
[31:27] man that did not come from the earth I
[31:32] believe Paul talked about the Inner Man
[31:33] strengthening the inner
[31:36] man amen it come from
[31:40] heaven and that's the Eternal part of
[31:43] the human being amen and yet strange
[31:47] that he tries to figure out his own
[31:49] way amen if we find it so in the
[31:52] scriptures that when a man chooses to
[31:53] walk in his own way and do the way that
[31:55] he wants to God lets him
[31:59] alone huh how many know you want to go
[32:02] your own way want to do your own
[32:04] thing fall flat on your
[32:07] face fall flat on your face get up and
[32:10] say
[32:11] wow well that didn't
[32:15] work how many believe that's the truth
[32:18] people that is so easy for any of us to
[32:22] want to do it the way we want to do it
[32:24] that's right we want to do what we want
[32:26] to do be careful of that it's in your
[32:29] nature and it's not something you want
[32:31] to
[32:33] do because if you live that way and you
[32:35] do what you're gonna do I'm gonna do
[32:37] what I'm gonna do I don't care go ahead
[32:40] God will let you
[32:41] alone I don't want God to leave me
[32:44] alone amen no I want God to be all up in
[32:47] my
[32:49] business I like that I want God to be
[32:52] all up in my business I want him to be
[32:55] in my head I want him to be in my heart
[32:57] I want to be in my strength I want him
[32:59] to be in my soul I want him to be all up
[33:01] in my
[33:03] business I want them to be all up in my
[33:06] conscience
[33:08] amen my goodness every part of me that's
[33:13] right oh my man must not think for
[33:16] himself but he must let the mind that
[33:19] was in Christ be in him we are not to
[33:21] think for ourself we are to call
[33:24] anything that's contrary to what he said
[33:26] as though it's not amen no matter what
[33:30] our eyes claim to be we do not live by
[33:33] what we see we live by what we
[33:36] believe a few days ago I was listening
[33:38] to a program on the radio coming to
[33:40] Sunday school and it was round a
[33:42] Roundtable discussion with teenagers in
[33:45] Louisville what was one of the most
[33:47] important things was a girl to find a
[33:50] boy with curly hair or a boy a girl
[33:52] that's pretty and blue and brown eyes
[33:55] did that make the difference in seems
[33:57] like that that would be the great thing
[33:58] for a teenager but that isn't the
[34:00] greatest thing the greatest thing is to
[34:02] find your God your
[34:05] maker
[34:07] amen then next thing he says don't mix
[34:10] marry marry a boy that believes exactly
[34:14] like you do after all God is the main
[34:17] important thing that we are on earth to
[34:19] do is to serve him and if you do marry
[34:23] oh boy and if you do marry or anything
[34:27] contrary to that you'll pay for it in
[34:29] the days that lays ahead of
[34:33] you you'll pay for it in the days that
[34:36] lay ahead of
[34:37] you amen you must remember always by
[34:42] faith not by sight the just shall live
[34:46] by say faith we look to the
[34:49] Unseen how many believe that we look to
[34:52] the
[34:54] Unseen amen
[34:57] praise the Lord when a man catches the
[34:59] vision of the invisible God and know
[35:02] that he's already present there's
[35:05] something that stabilizes that man
[35:08] [Music]
[35:09] thinking Glory teenagers listen to be
[35:13] clearly a lot of time when you're a
[35:14] teenager you have complexes inferior
[35:17] complexes not as pretty as somebody not
[35:19] as handsome as somebody this that or the
[35:21] other or maybe you don't feel like you
[35:22] can talk about all kinds of things folks
[35:25] I was one of the worst didn't act like I
[35:27] was brother John I like like but I still
[35:30] had all kinds of complexes I had to
[35:32] prove everything and do this that and
[35:34] the other prove you could do it this
[35:35] side or the
[35:37] other but you know listen whenever God
[35:39] got a hold of me some of that Wishy
[35:42] washing and all that mess got went the
[35:45] Wayside it'll stabilize you can I read
[35:48] it
[35:49] again listen to what he says amen when
[35:52] you finally have the vision catch that
[35:54] vision of the invisible God being
[35:56] present there's something that
[35:57] stabilizes that man's thinking it
[35:59] stabilizes his
[36:02] actions and in the time of distress and
[36:05] trouble it'll still make you look upward
[36:08] and above the things that are happening
[36:10] around
[36:12] him young or old how many belev that's
[36:16] something we have all learned to
[36:20] do learn to
[36:25] look huh
[36:27] into the invisible realm that's where
[36:30] you'll find it won't find it
[36:34] here don't find it here you you'll find
[36:36] it here right there is where you'll find
[36:38] it close your eyes to the world talk to
[36:40] the one that you don't see with your
[36:42] eyes he's right
[36:45] there
[36:48] amen because he's looking at the Unseen
[36:52] yet by promise
[36:55] amen even Jesus spoke of it in St John
[36:58] 14 when he talked about the branch and
[37:01] so forth am mean a branch that does not
[37:03] bear fruit is cut off because it's
[37:05] withered ain't that right only the fruit
[37:07] bearing the kind that bears fruit and
[37:10] the works of the Holy Spirit shall be
[37:12] able to continue in the vine for the
[37:14] life that is in the vine puts forth the
[37:16] branch and the life that was in Jesus
[37:18] was in uh was in the church first and
[37:22] they did not walk by sight they walked
[37:26] by
[37:28] Faith amen isn't it something that no
[37:31] matter whether it's sickness or things
[37:34] happening everything we we see it we see
[37:37] it with our eyes right not we can see it
[37:39] with our eyes and it affects us so much
[37:41] when you're not supposed to go by the
[37:43] things that you see with your eyes you
[37:45] go by the Unseen you go by what by the
[37:48] promise the supernatural word of God go
[37:52] by the promise of God look
[37:54] to that amen amen praise the
[38:01] Lord they did not walk by sight they
[38:03] walk by faith believing what God Said
[38:05] was the
[38:06] truth Oh What A Difference it is when
[38:08] men who will walk by faith and call
[38:10] anything that's contrary to that amen by
[38:13] sight that's contrary to the word as
[38:15] though it is
[38:18] not we need that type of faith in the
[38:21] church then he talks about aviators and
[38:24] how they fly through the sound barriers

[38:27] come off and everything else but once
[38:28] they s past that sound barrier man that
[38:32] that thing that plane just sails
