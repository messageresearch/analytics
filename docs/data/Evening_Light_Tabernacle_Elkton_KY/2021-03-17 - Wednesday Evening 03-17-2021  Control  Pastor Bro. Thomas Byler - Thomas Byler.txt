for those specials amen it's certainly amen good to be in the house of the lord how many had to be in the house of the lord amen and what lord jesus we just once again now lord our heads to the dirt dust from where we was made lord jesus and father we just desire lord jesus said you'll use this dust lord use our bodies lord jesus to be able to speak your word lord jesus and also father to be able to hear your word what you would have lord to say to us lord jesus this evening father spirit express father to us the things that you once said lord and we just ask god that you would just bless the meditation of our heart that which you have we feel you have let it bleed upon a heart to speak on lord father as we open your word we ask god that you would just reveal it to us make it real to us lord bless each one father that has come into your house tonight lord we ask god that you bless every ever streaming we ask god that you'd be with them wherever they are lord jesus and that this may be a time father lord where we just consecrate ourselves and praise you and glorify you and and give you thanks and worship you and praise you lord jesus amen we ask these blessings and favors in jesus name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will to first john first john and we'll begin with chapter 2 verse 15 love of not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world the world passes away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever amen a prophet taught us that jesus was tempted with all three of these sins amen one is lust the flesh one is the lust of the eye the other is the pride of life now the pride of life is the one we want to focus on until i read that about the pride of life matthew 4 if you want we'll just read me got a frog where really his ministry started uh was led into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil amen and so this is very fitting that jesus had the first goal and to be tempted and to be tested isn't that right before he was ready to uh do a real work for god he had to first go through the trials and the tests reminded me of the message by the brandon preach called possessing the gates of the enemy after a trial amen and in that you'll find that brother branham taught that you know you're not really going to be able to possess the gates of the enemy until you're tested and tried until you have overcome some things amen and that overcoming and attesting and trying of course we know that that molds character is that right and even jesus the first thing he had to do was go through some tests and some trials in that right now let's look at this now verse one then was jesus lit up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fast at 40 days and 40 nights he was afterwards and hungered and when the tempter came in to him he said if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made into bread and he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen then the devil taketh him up into the upon the pinnacle of the temple and let's just go with this now let's let's talk about the first one for just a second if you'll notice lust of the flesh would be something he was very hungry afterwards he was a hunger and if verse two it says afterwards he was hungry so after 40 days you can imagine it would be quite a temptation for him to create some bread and eat it and the devil knew right where to hit him amen and so the lust of the flesh there second one would be the lust of the eye and then the third one the pride of life then the devil taketh him up into the holy city city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple says they after say unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his ch angels charge over thee and in his hands shall he bear thee up leaves at any time thou dashes foot against a stone amen so lust of the eye talk about the lust of the eye if you'll notice here how that would come into the lust of the eye it would be that he would go and he would do this and he would say well look at me look at who i am amen and you know people who people some people have a lot of pride for one thing and they want to say they get the attitude that look look who i am and you know jesus just didn't do that did he amen he was not wasn't that way so he overcome the lust of the eye and jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god the devil again taketh him up into exceedingly high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them our prophet said that he showed every nation russia america all the nations all kingdoms because he says and he showeth them all the kingdoms of the world so he was according to the word and the glory of them amen now he had that had to be quite a sight to behold and that right for him to show him all the kings of the world and and then and he saith unto him all these things will i give thee that's what brother braham says that it shows that the devil is really the one that controls all the nations am i right amen if thou but fall down and worship me jesus answers and said unto him get thee hands satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him may god had his blessings to the reading word you may be seated so tonight i want to talk about control talk about control and power and authority and character amen so we look at that and we see that first of all i want to read another one if i may because i have quite a few scriptures that i do want to read this is going to be in uh uh saint john let me go to saint john and maybe before we read we'll just talk about this a little bit because if the desire for power the desire to rule all right uh and let me just tie that third one in let me tie the third one in here about pride the third one it says that uh you know and of life all right now how many knows that this pride pride comes with ruling right with rulership with being in authority with uh you know because we know that that's really what it's all about it's about ruling it's about authority it's about control amen that's what it's about and that's the devil for one thing that's what the devil desired in isaiah 14. in isaiah 14 when he was still in heaven his desire was to be like the most high i would be like this god you know and i and he wanted to be worshipped like god i mean that was his desire is to be worshipped to be controlling over people to uh you know to be had to have authority to have power all right and so and and it says that pride was found in him it was pride it's actually pride that brought satan to the place that he wanted to be in a great high place it was pride so that was the third sin and how we tie that in with satan's offering to jesus of all the kingdoms of the world you know he can have them all and he can he can he can be the ruler of it all as long as he falls down and worships him in that right so i'll tell you the simplicity of the devil the simplicity how simple it is uh is it's amazing how simple it is for the devil to have control of us all right because islam paul said whoever you serve whosoever servant you are or whoever you obey is whose servant you are isn't that right so if you somebody tell you to do something you do it well you're like their servant you are doing what they ask you to do and that's all the devil wanted out of just was just do what i asked to do amen because that would be submissive to the devil amen and that would put the devil over jesus and that's all he wanted you know you know he had scriptures you know he says you're hungry you know just speak the word and this will happen then he used a very powerful scripture on the second one because he quoted a scripture about how the angels will have charge over the unless thou would dash thy foot against one stone and he quoted the bible to him isn't that right to try to get him to actually serve and come and obey what he said but jesus wasn't that dumb he you know like probably god said when he came up against christ when he came against david yeah he got him moses yeah he got him many others yeah he got him but when he come up against christ he got his feathers cinched amen and jesus overcome all three of these amen and i want to talk about rulership and authority and control tonight because i do believe that the sons of god also here in saint john 1. amen i'm going to go down a little bit it's saint john 1 in verse 11 it says he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god amen how many knows that power is authority all right when you have authority that's power all right amen and also it is control amen its control to have power to have authority is to have control amen so he said to them gave he the power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god praise be to god so he says here that sons of god also have power how many of us have been given power oh my i was trying to think you know let me see if i can find it saint john 3 saint john 3 i believe it is not saint john 3 1 john 3 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god amen therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god praise be to god you know in the catholic religion i think it's you have to be dead and then they'll make a saint out of you all right they'll make you a saint after you're dead well folks unto the saints which are ephesus and so forth it's what they are we are that now not later we better be saints now because he ain't gonna he gonna make no saint out of whatever the priest says or whatever he tries to do when you're over there you're gonna be what you are but here we are saints now and not only are we saints now but it says that now we are sons of god how many believes that we're sons of god and we have been given power now um i believe it was an axe or matthew no remember i think it's acts the first chapter he talks about you know it says when when when are these things going to be and so forth he says it's not for you to know the times and the seasons but he says but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you isn't that right so we receive power after the holy ghost has come upon us i want to go over just a few things for wednesday night we're going to try not to be too long but this is kind of a long message so bear with me but we already know there's some things we want to know and this message tonight to the the message tonight is about trying to pick us up and take us all just a little higher is that okay take us a little higher take it a little deeper get us a little closer because if that's not the direction we're going then we're going the wrong way amen and it's about so we see him we already know i wrote around here the things that we already know things we already know we know that when jesus died on calvary when he sent out the baptism of the holy ghost amen when he when he died on calvary he when he said it was finished we realized that jesus christ right there he stripped the devil of any power that he had now he had authority and he had power over every body every man woman and child they had a nature they couldn't get away from it and as long as you didn't get the baptism of the holy ghost you had a nature that you had to deal with and you could never completely overcome amen but on calvary he stripped him of every authority that he had every power that he had amen so many know we're fighting a powerless opponent but we know that that is only through christ jesus that's only through a new birth only by the holy ghost is the devil powerless because if i'll tell you this right now it don't matter how much you try to fight the devil it don't matter how much you try to be a christian it don't matter how much you try to do the right thing if you haven't got the holy ghost in your heart you will come out wrong it'll never be right you'll never get it right no matter how much you try amen because if you could get it right why would we need the holy ghost huh we know it takes the power of the holy ghost when jesus did that on calvary we know that he was stripped and we already know that whenever a person becomes born again being born not of the will of the flesh but born by the spirit amen when you become a child of god god gives you a checkbook and you know a checkbook don't do you a bit of good unless you've got the signature on that checkbook amen but god give you a checkbook amen let's read where the bible talks about our checkbook would that be all right turn with me to st john 14. this is just one of many places 14. all right saints four john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works shall he than thee shall you do because i go unto the father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name amen whatever you have faith to sign on that's what you'll be able to get from god and he says i will do it now [Laughter] if we look and if we lo if if you love me keep my commandments now just that scripture long boy it is it is as powerful and it is as good as john 3 16 he whosoever and men shall come you know whosoever i forgot so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life in other words he said whosoever it's a powerful scripture i mean that's saying anybody everybody here is saying whatever you ask pretty powerful now let me read you a quote oh yeah he said brother bannon makes a statement he says you know the power that'll raise us up is in us right now amen how many believes that amen if the same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you it's that same spirit that rolls him up we have that same power now through the holy ghost all right right now we are in heavenly places and we are now in the power of the resurrection if there wasn't a law to that the sons of god and the others of god he says would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it all right my you have the power in you to do it oh my but the power is controlled by a law and that is the law of faith how many knows you have to have the faith to be able to do it praise be to god so he says you know there's power in us that we could actually go and live on the world amen a private life if we had the faith for it amen praise the lord lord so we want to look at that for just a second amen we talk about christ first of all what we already know is that it is there as long as he's on that mercy seat i believe it's there now there's a lot of people in the 1960s believe that he came off the mercy seat wouldn't it change your whole thinking if you thought he wasn't there anymore your prayers couldn't be heard what kind of person would we be would chase change the whole thing people quit preaching are you the only one that should preach should we just play tapes i think we got the answer no no by no means huh but listen so as long as on that mercy seat listen then that's available amen and and what i want to say is this listen we already know the other thing is that when he died and when he saves you amen and when he gives you the baptism of the holy ghost it is a rip a work of bringing back all right it is a work of redemption that's why even in revelation he says the book that was sealed was a book of redemption that book was sealed and it was the book of redemption it was a book of bringing back sons and daughters of god to god bring us back into a relationship with god amen and the kind of relationship that adam had before the fall amen i picked this message up on brother brad's preaching sunday morning when he's talking about adam could just say look uh you know the third i think it was a waterfall or something you know i'd like to have a waterfall over here i'd like to have this over here and i like to have that you know he could just speak it and i begin to thinking of how that actually according to the scriptures we're in that place now oh my faith be to god look i may not be able to speak to mountains and throw them into the sea like jesus said you could if you have faith huh i might not be able to do this but i know one thing and that is god has done a redemptive work in here well i'll tell you what if you know that without a shadow of a doubt the ceiling ain't hardly high enough for you it is exciting it is so awesome to think and to know that god has done a work for you and in you of redeeming you back and we know the prophet told us that the bible says you know what so everything you ask now we're back on the same conditions adam was which i speak it and it'll be and how many knows that we have been shown that more now than in luther's time or wesley's time i believe it was uh one of those one of those four runners i don't know if it was john wesley that was riding his horse i'm thinking and he fell in the little hole and he broke that horse and the horse broke his leg he got out and he prayed for it and he was healed and he rode on hello but we have much more than a broken leg and a horse folks we have deserving to tell you what your name is who you come from millions times over millions upon millions of time that jesus came amen in our generation they did the very same sign that he did when he was at the woman with the well he's earning her thoughts intents of the heart oh my that's why we have so much confidence in what the prophet said is because god came and he proved what he said nobody could do that and live with him that's why we hang on to his every word if there was any i was thinking today if boy if brother brandon wanted to see somebody he could have deceived a multitude of people because data followed him people was deceived and he tried to keep him on a straight track hello he'd have to come and straighten him out so no i'm not jesus this is you know i'm just your brother it's jesus that comes to the platform and deserves i am not lord don't you call me jesus don't baptize but people did people always go off on the deep end huh but he stayed humble anyway so back to our thought when we think about our lord and what he did and how did he redeem he did every he did a work of bringing us back into the place of power the back to the place of authority back to the place of control that's what i want to talk about talk about control because that's ultimately what it's about let me just talk politics for just a second we all know that through this epidemic that our government and certain certain factions especially were very happy without with being able to tell you what to do even though it was contrary to the constitution they took great pleasure that was awesome man they even said boy we if we were in office we would take great opportunity of this we would really get to get the greatest we'd take every opportunity on this huh why because it's the devil and it's all about telling you what to do that's what the devil wants that's what the devil has wanted from the very start because if you do what he tells you to do guess what you're his servant and the catholics they don't care if you're catholic protestant or or pentecostal or message they don't care what they used to they used to burn who had the snake if you didn't kiss their crucifix and and do what they want you to do but now they know and the devil's gotten smarter and he knows that look as long as you side with him you're going to the same place you're still serving them anyway you can keep your religion just come subject to him amen he's shrewd as long as he can get you to listen to him and obey what he wants you to do you're his servant he's got you amen he's got you and it's so simple we bring it down to where it's just the thoughts that come into our mind hello just think his thoughts and let those thoughts rule you and your servant of the devil he will serve his purpose perfectly the only way you can really discern it is by the word of god amen so look so now we've oh my when i got into this i thought we already know we could preach a message on what we already know we already know that the sons of god have been given this power we have already been restored back but if you'll remember over in galatians it talked about and paul talked about how that when his son is born he is under tutors and governors isn't that right he's under tutors and governors until he gets to a certain place and in the orient they used to have a certain time in a certain place and when that son proved that he was really a good son and worthy of handling the affairs then they would take him into a public place and they would what they would call adopt him in that right that's why brother ben preached many a message on adoption he was trying to get to the pentecostals especially amen that you can't just look speak in tongues and this that and the other and oh hallelujah and out and enjoy all the blessings and then that that doesn't mean you're a mature son you're just starting now you have to be tried you have to be tested and then let me say this they never did get to the place of maturity man the devil got them before they got off the ground very far so to speak and they're right they had all this but it wasn't very long until they had their differences once but he was coming on two different pieces they all made their demand in nominations and everything else is that right their own system their own ways and they all died amen that's what the devil did because they didn't come to maturity it doesn't matter if he's coming on a white cloud or if he's coming on a white horse now how many knows in the revelation it says that he's coming on a white horse revelation 19. and another place in the bible says hey you know when he left in the book of acts he says he was received up into heaven in a cloud and the angel said as you have seen him go that's how he's going to come back if he went on the cloud he'll come back on the clock and boy you could have argument brother bro huh but the pentecostals never did get over being able to disagree with each other and still love each other they had to part ways huh so you see i i think i thought about this and so how many believes that before we are really ready for authority we have to be tested we have to be tried we have to be schooled i mean to see what we'll do in those trials and those tests amen and you know i say that because you know i would love to be able to say tonight you know boy i'll tell you what the people in this church we go through trial and we go through tests and we just boy we just really clear them we took we really do good no matter what comes no matter what goes there's nothing but the love of god in our hearts and we overcome every obstacle can we say that tonight no even when we come and overcome a lot of them there's still some we don't overcome there's still some things that come our way that oh boy that one got me amen but listen we have to come to what adoption come to the place of maturity because i believe that as christ coming is growing nigh the closer it comes the more i long to be at the place where i can say that no matter what comes my way no matter what happens i can practice what i preach and that is to be completely surrendered to christ no matter what happens no matter what my battle is i never have to worry i never have to fret i don't have to be nervous i don't have to be upset i don't have to be tossing turning my in my bed i don't have to lose sleep because i have learned how to commit it like that woman did to god god is yours i don't know about you but man to know that cast all your cares upon you that is a glorious thing to be able to do because you're either going to cast it on his cares or you're going to try to solve the problem i'll solve this problem you'll get in the way that's getting yourself in the way i'm going to take care of this problem huh that that god ain't even nowhere around huh hey the devil you know that's how the devil works he tries to get us in our problem no matter how much but i want to be able to say lord because if i'm going to be an old man if i'm going to be mature christian i have to learn to surrender everything no matter what it is to the lord and be free there is great freedom and happiness in the fact that we know that he is in us doing it my problem's his problem i thought for sure brother brad was going to say that magic word akunu matata mean don't worry for the rest of your days well yeah i know but anyway oh boy i hope everybody liked that because if you didn't you really really got to choke on that one aren't you but let me tell you something it is so awesome to know that jesus christ is taking care of all your problems all of whatever it is so what else do we know how many wants to hear some more we know that we got to come to that place and god has to test us god has to try us amen because we do want power how many wants power how many wants authority how many wants control the bible says you know in revelations there that they lived and they ruled and reigned with christ for a thousand years how many believe we're going to rule as we sang that song amazing grace house read the sound let's say the reds like me when we've been there ten thousand years right shining that's the sun we have no last day to sing praise bible says we're gonna rule and reign with christ in other words we're gonna be in a place of authority a place of power over there and i tried to imagine i tried to imagine what it's going to be like in heaven cities huh outside of the city uh the city that comes down 15 miles high and so forth light the sun will be gone the moon will be gone the stars will be gone just the light from that sun and from the sun of god will lighten the whole world huh ruling and reigning let's talk about that for a minute scripture that tells us that we're going to rule in matthew in matthew you don't have to go to it matthew 25 20 20 5 21 says this is after the five talents and so forth and he gained this that and the other then he says his lord said unto him well done thy good and faithful servant god has been faithful over a few things i will make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the lord praise be to god somebody knows that if you're faithful in little things faithful in a few things god's going to make you rule over many things but before we're ready to rule before we're ready to have that power that authority over there we have to have that power and that authority here one more thing before i go on when i thought about what heaven's going to be like the eons of time city i don't know how it's all going to be that's just my imagination imagine what i imagine you probably imagine something a little different it'll be different we thought but this one thing i know for sure it'll be much better than any of us can imagine or dream but if jesus of god himself which is jesus if he come and he made this world we've been here for 6 000 years into sinful condition dying our life's like a vapor it just comes and it goes we're gone hello amen any but he's got sons and daughters that he has created and that he's redeeming to himself and he's getting ready if he would do that for 6 000 years imagine what it's going to be like when we get to the other side it is going to be a thing of glory it is going to be a beautiful thing and he's getting us ready we know that this is all just a testing ground and that right a trying ground and let me just say this while it comes to my mind and the number one thing the most thing that i can possibly think of that god is looking for out of us is character character nerd prophet is the only thing we're going to take with us is our character what kind of a character are we not a good question what kind of a boy he's a character isn't he she's a character there are some characters out there look at the world how many know the world is completely out of control people are completely out of control hey one nose ring ain't enough we gotta have two you know and those people that have their paint their face so painted up so bad you don't even have a face they got these earlobes you know the big round things and in the nose even in the nose you got big things that just them guys just went to the max of what those others are heading for one tattoo ain't enough you gotta have another one another one you know they're out of control they got no control they had control they wouldn't do that stuff in the first place amen how many have control that's right they have control all right he'll make him ruler over many things we know that without we're not going to rule unless we suffer unless god tries and tests us characters and doesn't come by the way of of having it easy and having it nice huh no that's never how character comes it's through hardships it's through trials that's why a lot at all but boyle boy so to speak if we can get to that place that god is looking for us because we're going to meet him one of these days in the sky you're just simply not going to be not ready huh you got to be ready be ready for you know not the day or the hour be ready jesus be ready that's what i'm interested in is being ready amen now let's go to a scripture we'll begin to get down to where we live proverbs 16 if you want to go with me proverbs 16. i'll just go ahead and read it if you here in a second verse 31 16 a proverb says the horror head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit then he that taketh a city amen he that ruleth his spirit that he that takes the city how many knows we don't really control ourselves we don't really control ourselves whatever spirit in you air that's what controls us but guess what we do have a choice we have to choose what spirit is going to rule us and if you can control your spirit then you're better than david with all of his mighty army and surrounding a city and taking a city of ten thousand men taking that city oh that's powerful that's glorious the bible says you're better than the man that takes the city you're more powerful if you can control your spirit amen david could kill bears and goliaths and kill all kinds of armies and all of these things but yet he didn't control his lust when he seen bathsheba he didn't have the strength to rule that spirit amen the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the brighter life three main sins how many knows it's very hard to have self-control to control yourself the bible says to have temperance to have self-control self-control control over ourselves this is where this is where it's at is about controlling ourself whether we're really ready to reign or not rule or not paul he says have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as perhaps other apostles amen how many should have the power to do that the bible says you know that a pastor a bishop is to rule his own house well because if he can't control and rule his own house how can he rule the house of god i heard brother bam say the bible says in genesis he says adam shall rule over thee to rule over your life amen rule over your family rule over yourself rule over a sister you got the power to do that we should have that kind of authority boy amen so but again open that door for a week i figured i'd do that but listen you know well my wife my wife no no don't don't give me that my wife isn't what i what she should be guess who you blame i'm gonna take the blame huh until i have found everything that i possibly can and i can tell you this i don't know about you all think sometimes my wife says boy they must think we really fuss and fight i says no but i just use it for examples but i my wife loves me more now than she ever has and i love her more than what we did when we got married hello we love each other very very much because i care about her feelings i care about emotions and everything else and it means a lot when she when she comes up and she said honey i really love you thank you for everything you do for me i'm saying thank you honey for everything you do let me tell you something i believe that we as men have to be able to have enough power to lead a wife to leader to christ to lead isn't that right if we don't have power to lead our wives how are we going to rule a city or our children hello amen by example even paul says don't we have power to do that sure we do or to control our spirit amen it's a powerful thing when you think about it praise the lord but it says i think the biggest fault that i find with many churches especially the real church that's born again they don't know who they are they don't realize what privilege that god has given us amen how many beliefs we just don't tap into sometimes the privilege that god has given us we don't even realize it every redemptive blessing he died for all right let's talk about power just for a minute again when we think about it brother man makes a statement he says you know people they want power but they don't really know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the way up is down if you want power see how humble you can be amen how many knows if it's easy to preach let's surrender ourselves completely the christ sure we can preach that but doing that's a different story why because how many knows the biggest battle that we ever fight it's where right here right here in our minds we buy to fight a big battle the devil always putting thoughts in our mind always hunting us with mind and that's how spirits come home that's how spirit comes is through our mind and through our hearts then he drops down into our hearts james i believe said listen let me just finish that quote he says just get away from all your worldly thinking humble yourself before god and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a great big bunch of noise huh see because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ see to humble yourself before him that's truly power amen to be able to humble yourself before christ that's truly power james 3 and verse 2 says for in many things we offend all now if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body i mean there's another place i've tried i thought about where it was i couldn't find it but it says the bible says a man that cannot riddle his tongue it says this man's religion is vain it's right here behold we put bits in horses mouths and they obey us and we turn them about their whole big old horse by simply pulling a little bit right just a little bit here a little bit there they turn that big old horse could stomp you in the ground then he says behold we have ships that though they be so great driven of fierce winds yet they are turned about with a little governor the little helm even so the tongue is a little member it boasts this great thing behold what a great what how great a matter a little fire kindleth the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is a tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and set it on court on fire the course of nature and is set on course of the fire of hell of every kind of beasts and a birds and of serpents and things in the seas tame and have been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil how many knows the pharisees when they would speak it was because of what was down in their heart it was because of their spirit that they had you speak why they said what they said let me talk to you five minutes talk to me back five minutes and i can tell you as a pastor i can tell you whether you got the holy ghost or not huh whether you got a spirit of god or whether you don't have the spirit of god why because out of the abundance of the heart meal speaker amen so if you can control this if this is under control right here there's no other part of the body the bible says that you can't control it is it uncontrolled it is the hardest things to tame the hardest things to control amen praise the lord i don't know about you but i say lord i want to be completely in your control because it's not god it's not me living it's christ living in me amen let me just say something else tonight i've been pastor here in 29 years this october 20th will be 30 years my 30-year anniversary amen and i want to say this by god's grace went through many battles fought many things did many things and had many attitudes many times took the wrong spirit wrong attitude come out here preach wrong attitude huh but one thing i've learned brother glenn i have learned that when thoughts come into my head that upset me thoughts come into my mind that i have to fight with and battle with and everything i know it's not god huh and i find me a place of prayer on my knees i've learned to pray and ask god to help me find my way because we go through things that we kissed about can't find our way it's hard to find our way it's fine hard to find the correct thought because how many about the bible says the carmel mind is empty against god it can't think the right thoughts the wrong spirit can't think the right thoughts it has to be the right thought it has to be the right spirit and sometimes it takes a lot of prayer it takes a lot of soul-searching amen for me to find out that hey if there's anybody i don't care if it's my worst enemy if i have bad feelings how is that person there's something wrong in my heart huh because there's nobody that i don't want to go to heaven brother branham wanted hitler to go to heaven don't wish him lost huh in other words you get to a place to where you just can't say i love everybody every it makes me love everybody huh you get to the place where no this person here i don't really love i i you know i you know hello that's not christ and i have learned and i hope every one of us has here you have learned what the correct thoughts are whatever the the right mind that the thoughts that you're supposed to think that will absolutely control your spirit because your thoughts will control your spirit how many knows that what you think about what you meditate on it brings spirits that's why i like gospel when you listen to gospel but better man says you don't have to gossip to lose the holy ghost all you got to do is listen to that gossip amen just listen to gossip amen one way that you can always tell when something's not the holy ghost or when i am not thinking thoughts about my brother and my sister that's not of the holy ghost i will think evil about them i will think evil about that person if that's what you think it's not god that's what i think it's not god because that woman caught in the very act of adultery worthy of death and he says go and sin no more i don't condemn you huh you know i would hope i hope brother joe that i get to see that woman i hope she did go and sin no more because once you come in contact with jesus you're never the same again but i don't know maybe that woman did go back out and sin again i don't know it's possible but yet jesus had mercy upon her she had the right thoughts and one thing i've learned brother jeff is that whenever i get thoughts that are not right it disturbs me it upsets me and i'll be upset and that's absolutely not controlling my spirit amen i have to pray and say god what is the right thought and especially a pastor hello no matter what situation it is the wrong spirit will always make you see it one side one direction that's all you see but there's always two sides to everything amen and i've learned that when you look at the other side it's not near as half as bad as what it looked like looking the other way one way looks horrible the other way it looks hey it's not near as bad as it looks amen get personal here that's okay perhaps preachers preachers even that have sided with who i thought they shouldn't side with did things in the church here i thought they should have never had the spiritual discernment to do what they did hello i try to invite him to come preach for me i have nothing against them huh because i believe they're my brother i don't believe they're not god's children because i know i had to learn i mean as we all got to learn and we all got to learn this one thing and that is to control our spirit if you can control your spirit if you can control what spirit dominates you you are mightier than a man that takes the city you're mightier than david because he couldn't isn't that right he can control his spirit he got into all kinds of trouble because of it but we know that that was under the old testament he couldn't have the holy ghost at the time so his flesh was stronger amen how many knows our our flesh self-control is there's just no self-control unless you got the holy ghost that's the only way to control your flesh is through the holy ghost otherwise it's going to go this way and i want i will god help us let's get this that the right thinking will bring the right spirit it'll make your whole world beautiful it'll give you a beautiful world amen but the wrong thing it'll make it a nightmare it'll make it a nightmare for your wife for your children everybody around you because i'll tell you what my wife can pick up on me when i'm in a bad mood that quick isn't that right that's why it's because she's so close to me i mean that's the way we got to be let me say something else everybody that takes communion everybody that's a part of this church we are brothers and sisters we are brothers and sisters and we stick together and if one of us gets out of line we're not going to throw them out we're not going to go throwing them out no we're going to stick there for them and with them and then pray through them and whatever it is we stay there and we stick together because that's the way i believe it ought to be in my family i'll tell you what no matter what i'm going to stick up for my family i'm going to be with my family doesn't mean i can't correct them and all that but we're together because it's the devil that wants the tears of heart he's the one that wants to divide the devil amen not god is that okay i thought lord help us to come to the place to where god can say now you're ready because if i as i was saying earlier as a pastor if i have this authority and i don't have character to go with it i just say well look i don't believe that person got the holy ghost it'd be better for them to find another place to go huh that isn't the right attitude no we're brothers and sisters i make mistakes why the next time i messed up god say that about me wouldn't that be terrible that's right so i'll tell you god is working i don't know about you but he's working on me on this and i can tonight i can tell you i'm thankful that god's working on me on this because i want to be at the place that no matter what comes my way i can control my spirit i will not allow negative thoughts to come into my mind wrong thoughts to come into my mind because if i do something as simple as gossip i'm going to get a bad spirit amen you love the lord i want to leave this place one of these times and i want to be ready to leave this place and i believe that god is working on us don't you i believe god loves each and every last one of us and i hope that god that each and every one of us when the rapture takes place amen will be going day before yesterday i thought the rapture might have taken place me and my wife we were right there at the farm we were together and i went everywhere i got in the house i said huh honey where are you at bathroom no nobody back there upstairs donna where are you nowhere look out the chicken house nobody door's not open what's going on here my wife just disappeared but wow i didn't get scared or anything i knew he wasn't no raptor but i thought this is probably what it will be like go for the rapture for folks you know just be missing then i remember having heard but i thought somebody was supposed to show up at the farm and i heard some gravel going so i thought that person had comment i had one out there nobody came and i was like this is oh i remember i heard some gravel and then i looked the van was going said all right now i know why she's nowhere but i'll tell you what we all want to go when the time comes we want to be ready amen god bless you let's stand tonight stand the night true power is in being able to surrender yourself to god that's not always easy to do is it sure it isn't but the lord will help us amen through no matter what comes or goes he'll help us to surrender to god let him fight our battles for us let him he may take care of things for us let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you lord tonight and lord thinking about how that father we are going to come to a rapture we're supposed to come to a place of adoption to where you can trust us with the spoken word lord jesus i look forward to the time that where i can just speak the word where i can just say be healed brother in the name of jesus christ and they'll be healed just ask and it'll be done lord but father i've seen you answer many prayers i believe you answered prayers but lord jesus i truly want to be at that place lord where i'm could be trusted with that power that there's enough character in my heart that you could trust me lord jesus said i would do the right thing lord jesus father tonight no doubt each and every one lord in here wants to be to that place where our spirit is always nothing but the holy spirit that's controlling us lord jesus because the devil if he can get in there we have to let him in first and lord we ask god tonight to help us each one not to let the devil in because he'll sure tried in any of us and we ask god that you would help us to be able to keep him lord jesus possess the gates that the enemy would want to come through through memory through conscience through our mind all these different avenues lord and father what a mighty person will be lord if we can truly control the spirit that we have all the time lord jesus tonight i would ask god if there's any out there that feel lord jesus that they just need that special touch from you lord they need to find their way they need to be know that they know that they know that they have peace in their heart everything's all right lord i pray you would let that be for each and every individual in here tonight and in the world of streaming god if there's any person out there lord that's grieved the holy ghost away for any reason lord i would ask god that you forgive him and say lord the dead spirit that has come with the thoughts that i've had that's not right it's not given me peace lord take that away lord jesus and restore me to the spirit of god and the spirit of love father tonight lord we ask lord you know each one out there lord jesus each one listening tonight you know exactly where they are lord i ask god that you would continue to give us spiritual discernment to know lord if we don't have the right spirit lord if it isn't your spirit that we'd be able to detect it and say i refuse to live like this i refuse to let this spirit control me and i asked the holy spirit to come in and take that spirit out to fill me with your sweetness god said i can blame my head on a pillow and sleep like a baby lord he asked god that you give each one peace in their hearts and keep getting us ready lord keep giving us that place of redemption for you have said through your prophet that when that squeeze comes down god you watch that third pool then you watch the spoken word then lord and we want to be ready for that time for we see that time approaching for we know satan truly wants control of everybody but lord we're never going to surrender our control lord jesus in our hearts to the devil lord you'll come and take us home to be with you bless the service now father and everything that was said in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you better david
