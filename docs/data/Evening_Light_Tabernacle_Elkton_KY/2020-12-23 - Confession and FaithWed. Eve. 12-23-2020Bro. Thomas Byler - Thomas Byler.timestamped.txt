[3:38] to you amen
[3:42] when he landed in france and he taken
[3:44] the girl and so forth and we won't go
[3:45] into details but he did the same thing
[3:47] that she did
[3:48] he's guilty of the same thing not my
[3:50] husband
[3:51] i says well you better get things right
[3:53] you better call him up so media
[3:55] media not media media got to talking to
[3:59] her and persuaded her to do it she went
[4:00] and called her husband
[4:02] they got in the car and met on the road
[4:04] she got in the car
[4:05] she's now i want to tell you and she
[4:06] confessed it all to him
[4:09] amen and he was looking at her and says
[4:12] now
[4:13] didn't you said didn't you go out with
[4:16] this woman
[4:17] the officer wound there about three days
[4:18] ago before there before that
[4:20] and you was in a green chevrolet car and
[4:22] she was wearing pink

[4:28] and so she told her
[4:32] where he had been he says honey that's
[4:34] the truth
[4:35] now i will admit that's the truth and if
[4:37] you forgive me
[4:38] i'll forgive you and maria will raise
[4:41] our children and start life
[4:43] right amen in a few minutes
[4:46] there they came back up the steps tears
[4:50] streaming down their cheeks oh satan
[4:52] had lost his hold then now
[4:56] that's where it's at amen
[5:00] but as long as sin is under there no
[5:03] matter how loud you scream
[5:05] how hard you jump how much oil you pour
[5:07] or
[5:08] how loud or you pray or how quietly you
[5:11] pray
[5:12] whatever you do the devil will stay
[5:16] right there
[5:19] as long as you've got unconfessed sin
[5:23] that's exactly right amen
[5:27] so you see folks that's my main message
[5:29] tonight is lord help us
[5:31] to look down in our hearts because
[5:35] how many knows all of us especially
[5:37] remember the one time
[5:38] brother bam uh this one little girl i
[5:41] believe she was
[5:42] nervous and brilliant went back down in
[5:46] their life way by this as a child
[5:49] a dog chased her y'all remember the
[5:51] sword dog chaser and it caused her
[5:52] always to be fearful
[5:55] i think that's a good lesson for us as
[5:57] parents that you know when you go boo
[5:59] and scare them you know you're you're
[6:01] you're forming them little kids
[6:04] maybe if we taught them to hey don't be
[6:05] afraid of the darkness nothing there it
[6:07] is out of the other which i know they'll
[6:08] have a
[6:09] natural tendency in that right to be
[6:11] scared of the dark because
[6:12] when you make it worse right all those
[6:14] things that right
[6:16] but you know just look at this every one
[6:18] of us not just that but every situation
[6:21] every circumstance everything that we
[6:24] go through has a tendency to form us
[6:28] to make us what we are amen and i will
[6:32] tell you what i
[6:33] i know that it can definitely cause us
[6:35] to what have
[6:36] complexes is that right it can cause us
[6:40] to have
[6:40] bitterness people sometimes you know uh
[6:43] you know
[6:43] things happen to where they become
[6:45] bitter and they might say they forgive
[6:49] huh but how many knows if you don't
[6:51] confess
[6:53] now actually you come to the place he
[6:54] says no i still got bitterness against
[6:57] that sister
[6:58] i still got bitterness against that
[7:00] brother
[7:01] amen and things will happen sometimes
[7:04] that'll bring that right up
[7:06] and it'll show you how many knows we
[7:08] need that that's why we need
[7:10] god to create situations to find out
[7:13] whether that thing is still down in
[7:15] there or not
[7:17] because if there's i'll guarantee you
[7:18] this if there jesus said
[7:20] you know if you don't forgive people
[7:22] their trespasses
[7:23] neither will your heaven oh if you're
[7:26] not forgiven then you've got a devil in
[7:27] your heart
[7:29] people is unforgiven sometimes we're not
[7:32] forgiven
[7:33] amen you know what i like about one
[7:36] thing about i love about jesus in
[7:38] john 3 16 you know he did not come to
[7:40] condemn the world
[7:42] he didn't just come to condemn everybody
[7:45] no
[7:45] he did not come to the condemned of the
[7:47] world but that the world through him
[7:50] might
[7:50] be saved
[7:54] amen and sometimes listen sometimes
[7:58] you know we get to where we just want to
[8:00] condemn everybody if you got a spirit
[8:01] that just wants to condemn everybody you
[8:03] remember that
[8:04] is not the holy ghost
[8:08] it's not the right spirit it's not the
[8:10] right attitude
[8:13] read you another story i said i had to
[8:15] let me read you another story
[8:17] or i'll tell you pretty much tell you
[8:19] the story but i do want to perhaps read
[8:21] a little bit out of it if i can
[8:31] here y'all remember the story of brother
[8:33] branham in ohio i believe it was and he
[8:35] was
[8:36] holding meetings he was preaching
[8:38] holding services right
[8:40] and he went over to this place because
[8:43] another restaurant was
[8:44] closed and so he went into what it looks
[8:47] to me like almost a bar
[8:49] and that right women drinking playing
[8:52] the stockish but that's a
[8:53] weird place for the prophet to land up
[8:55] isn't that right because i remember the
[8:57] machines you pushed the disc out of the
[8:59] other and the rock
[9:00] and roll it was all going on but he went
[9:04] in there
[9:04] and mr holy prophet isn't that right
[9:08] he's seen an old woman over there seeing
[9:10] the policeman breaking the law playing
[9:11] slot machines and gambling and
[9:13] everything else and
[9:14] oh he got to where he says you know why
[9:16] god why don't you just wipe that whole
[9:18] thing out
[9:20] huh wipe it all out
[9:23] what did god do he said come here son
[9:30] he took him behind and over there and he
[9:34] showed him all his sins
[9:37] showed him all he did and everything he
[9:39] had you know
[9:41] he talks about it being in talit ohio
[9:43] and brother bam says god showed me
[9:45] all that he showed me that in my heart
[9:49] it wasn't right amen
[9:53] let me tell you something it's real easy
[9:55] for our heart
[9:57] not to be right if we aren't careful
[10:00] we'll get in god's way
[10:03] amen you know if you want to find out
[10:06] whether somebody's
[10:08] really got the holy ghost or not
[10:10] sometimes you stroke them backwards a
[10:12] little bit
[10:13] like balaban did that kitty kitty did
[10:16] somebody do you wrong
[10:18] to find out how your reaction is
[10:22] amen let somebody smite you on the cheek
[10:26] huh we'll find out if there's any fight
[10:28] in yet
[10:31] just let these things happen and we kind
[10:33] of find out where you're at
[10:37] but brother branham here in this
[10:39] restaurant he was just really wanting to
[10:41] condemn the whole world
[10:42] and god told him he wrote all of his
[10:44] sins and it was all pardoned
[10:46] so brother bam says this you know god
[10:48] showed me that in my heart
[10:50] i wasn't right amen
[10:54] because i was trying to condemn her and
[10:57] not looking at what i had
[10:59] come from so we can always remember
[11:02] look back at the pit where we was hewn
[11:05] from
[11:07] amen things will look a lot different
[11:10] then
[11:10] see sometimes we get critical of people
[11:14] amen they call themselves christians but
[11:16] yet they're not doing like the oddity
[11:19] huh
[11:22] they still got faults they still got
[11:24] failures
[11:27] let me tell you this if you just condemn
[11:29] those folks
[11:30] all you got to do is look back a little
[11:32] bit and realize hey you know what
[11:34] i claimed the name of christianity and
[11:36] look at what i did
[11:40] now it doesn't the bible says judge not
[11:42] that you be not judged
[11:45] condemn not that you be not condemned
[11:48] because when you go to jump and you're
[11:49] going to condemn and everybody all they
[11:51] did that god could turn right around and
[11:55] he could point you to your fault
[11:57] and if he does you'll go to hell because
[12:00] you just condemned everybody else
[12:02] they'll
[12:02] you're bound to land in hell if that's
[12:04] your attitude
[12:07] that's why jesus said judge not don't be
[12:09] judgmental
[12:11] don't be condemning do you have a spirit
[12:14] of forgiveness
[12:15] hey i'm praying for you i'm believing
[12:16] for that person
[12:18] even brother branham when it comes to
[12:20] naming names on the pulpit one time he
[12:22] did come back and says i apologize
[12:24] i shouldn't have named the name why he
[12:26] was that sensitive
[12:28] about not naming names and condemning
[12:30] people
[12:33] amen but he was a prophet of god he
[12:34] didn't know what he was talking about
[12:37] amen let me tell you something else
[12:42] you know brother brahm said you know we
[12:43] can be right and have the wrong spirit
[12:48] what does that mean that means you're
[12:50] wrong
[12:51] you can be wrong and have the right
[12:53] spirit what does that mean
[12:55] you'll stand up and be right
[12:58] so let me ask you this we as christians
[13:00] we as who have been believers for a long
[13:02] time
[13:03] how many in here i have i've detected it
[13:05] in myself i've learned to know
[13:07] that hey i got the wrong attitude
[13:10] i need the holy spirit to take over here
[13:12] that right
[13:14] and every christian has to come to that
[13:16] place in their life
[13:17] to where you know that if you have the
[13:20] right spirit or whether you have the
[13:21] wrong spirit
[13:23] because the holy ghost is easily to
[13:25] being treated it's gentle
[13:27] huh even jesus when he looked at the
[13:30] woman at the
[13:31] well amen and caught in the very act and
[13:33] man
[13:34] she was absolutely guilty but yet what
[13:36] did he say to
[13:37] her where's your where's your condemors
[13:40] where's those that accuse you
[13:43] and she said i don't have any they're
[13:45] all gone
[13:46] and jesus says neither do i condemn thee
[13:50] go and sin no more
[13:53] amen even in a situation to where it
[13:55] really was true she was absolutely
[13:57] caught in the act
[13:58] she deserved to die but jesus was not in
[14:00] the condemning mood
[14:02] we're not in a dispensation of condemned
[14:04] condemnation
[14:06] sometimes the lord will give us insight
[14:08] on what we see
[14:09] well this person is definitely not this
[14:11] saturday they ain't gonna make it to
[14:12] heaven
[14:14] let me tell you what let me tell you
[14:16] what your prophet taught your prophet
[14:18] taught you
[14:19] taught me that people are going to be
[14:21] there you don't think are going to be
[14:23] there
[14:24] all right he taught us that we are going
[14:26] to be people not there that we thought
[14:28] was going to be there so watch out
[14:32] that's up to god i believe that's up to
[14:35] god to do the judging in those areas
[14:38] hey i think about perhaps my worst enemy
[14:42] but i am hoping that when i get over
[14:43] there they'll be there
[14:45] i want to see them there because i know
[14:47] how much god's grace is to me
[14:50] and i want god's grace to them i'm not
[14:53] the i'm not god i don't judge whether
[14:56] you know they're not going to be
[14:56] forgiven or forgiven
[14:59] and i can thankfully say i confess this
[15:01] evening by god's grace that's the way i
[15:03] feel i don't
[15:04] i don't hold anything against anybody
[15:08] because if i do if i hold one thing
[15:10] against anybody
[15:12] there will be something in there that'll
[15:14] make me act and react
[15:16] wrong and it won't be the holy ghost
[15:19] it'll be a devil because of that little
[15:22] bitterness or whatever it might be
[15:24] amen i hope this is helping all of us
[15:29] praise the lord so now what does the
[15:32] prophet of god say he says
[15:34] look at where you come from so we can
[15:36] always remember look back at the pit
[15:38] that we were hewn from look at where we
[15:40] come from
[15:42] then things will look a lot different
[15:43] brother baby says we don't want to
[15:45] condemn no one
[15:49] love everybody
[15:52] whenever you lose that real genuine love
[15:55] that's in your heart
[15:56] you have lost everything
[15:59] how many of us got to have genuine love
[16:01] in our hearts
[16:03] whenever you lose real genuine life
[16:05] touching you lost everything
[16:06] just don't forget that when you lose
[16:09] your
[16:10] when you lose love it's all
[16:14] gone amen how many believe that
[16:17] that's true remember and this is a this
[16:20] i say this faith and confession
[16:24] because it doesn't matter how much faith
[16:26] you have
[16:28] how much you pray how much
[16:31] an oil you do and how many whatever you
[16:34] do
[16:35] as long as there's something down inside
[16:37] of you
[16:38] that shouldn't be there it'll never do
[16:41] any good will it
[16:43] you will never be able to change
[16:47] i don't know about you but that's a
[16:48] scary thought to think that you can't
[16:51] change
[16:52] but you just stay the same year after
[16:54] year after year after year after year
[16:58] then i don't know about you but i see
[17:00] god what is it
[17:02] what is it in my heart that's keeping me
[17:05] from changing
[17:07] from being what i'm supposed to be do i
[17:10] have something in my heart
[17:12] how many want to ask the lord that lord
[17:14] is there something in my heart shouldn't
[17:15] be there
[17:18] then guess what something's going to
[17:20] happen to show you whether you got it in
[17:22] there or not
[17:23] something's going to happen
[17:26] and when you finally realize if you
[17:28] finally that's a great part of this once
[17:29] you realize when the grace of god shows
[17:31] you
[17:32] because my wife she'll tell you too that
[17:34] you know in our past and things you know
[17:38] that unless it's truly god bringing a
[17:41] revelation in your heart about it
[17:42] you're not gonna get it you're not gonna
[17:44] get it unless it's a personal revelation
[17:47] from god to you
[17:48] amen and that's why we have to say holy
[17:51] spirit come down in the gable end of my
[17:53] soul
[17:56] because a lot of us i don't care who you
[17:58] are if you lived in this world very
[18:00] long you've had differences with people
[18:02] you've had
[18:03] you've had uh things that you had hard
[18:06] to overcome
[18:10] amen and if thomas bowler isn't careful
[18:12] if you aren't careful that thing will
[18:14] stick down in there and it'll affect
[18:16] your life
[18:16] and it'll deform your personality
[18:21] in other words it won't be the image of
[18:23] christ it'll still be you
[18:25] in god's way amen because i don't know
[18:29] about you but my
[18:30] heart's ambition my goal is for the holy
[18:33] spirit
[18:34] to have such free reign in our church
[18:37] amen free reign in our church
[18:43] that god can do just what he did in the
[18:45] book of acts
[18:46] how many is with me just what he did in
[18:48] the book of acts
[18:50] because we either got it or we don't got
[18:52] it folks
[18:55] amen and i want us all to have it
[18:59] i want to have it in a greater way those
[19:02] streaming think about it
[19:04] huh i don't care what it is if it's
[19:07] clothes you ought to be wearing the holy
[19:08] spirit will tell you
[19:10] huh if it's an attitude you have it's a
[19:14] boss hearts his workers or whatever not
[19:16] doing right or
[19:17] work retards about the holy spirit will
[19:19] tell you
[19:22] amen that's what we need we need the
[19:24] holy spirit to go down into the gable
[19:25] end of our souls
[19:27] and find out why we are the way we are
[19:30] most of all why we stay the way we are
[19:34] why do i stay the way i am
[19:37] huh and i thank god for his grace
[19:41] because i'll tell you what if god
[19:43] wouldn't forgive you for the sins of
[19:44] today or tomorrow
[19:46] none of us would make it no even brother
[19:48] bannon he knew that
[19:49] he still had faults he had failures it's
[19:52] only the grace of god that
[19:54] keeps us and i truly believe that we're
[19:56] only we only stay clean by confession
[20:00] confession is to admit and how many
[20:03] knows it's just like
[20:04] whosoever confesses with his mouth the
[20:06] lord jesus christ
[20:07] they shall be saved now brother brahm
[20:10] said this message
[20:11] is christ isn't that right think about
[20:14] where people will be
[20:15] who are ashamed to confess this message
[20:17] in this hour to admit hey i believe that
[20:21] that was a prophet i believe that it was
[20:23] christ
[20:24] and when they do that they get marked as
[20:27] a holy ruler as
[20:28] a man follower or whatever it might be
[20:31] but if you don't confess
[20:33] the lord jesus christ with your mouth
[20:36] what does the bible say on that day
[20:38] i'll be ashamed of you man it's about
[20:41] confession
[20:43] so i don't know about you but i say lord
[20:46] jesus
[20:48] here how many would say
[20:51] hey daily god does show me things in my
[20:53] life he shows me where i'm not what i'd
[20:56] ought to be
[20:58] amen and i thank god for his goodness
[21:02] that leads us to repentance that woman
[21:05] can thank god
[21:06] in that right that the prophet of god
[21:09] discerned where her problem was
[21:11] there was a demon in there that caused
[21:13] her to go
[21:14] crazy drive you nuts torment you
[21:18] because how many knows the holy spirit
[21:20] he gives you peace
[21:23] he gives you assurance it gives you
[21:26] faith
[21:27] that when you've confessed everything
[21:28] everything is right in your heart
[21:30] the devil cannot come down in there
[21:32] there's no place
[21:33] for him to come down there and torment
[21:35] you and then it says the very scripture
[21:38] that whatsoever things we ask we receive
[21:40] of him
[21:41] because our heart don't condemn us
[21:46] amen in this case this woman thought
[21:49] hey you know how many times she came up
[21:51] to the altar
[21:53] and was prayed for and believed i
[21:54] believe i believe i believe but no there
[21:56] was something down in there
[21:58] that was still wrong amen
[22:02] now i don't know every one of us we you
[22:05] know you live your own life but every
[22:06] one of us know where you live at
[22:08] you know whether there's still something
[22:10] down there that's not right
[22:12] huh and then you wonder why god don't
[22:14] answer prayer
[22:17] um let me just say this
[22:21] in closing something the prophet said
[22:24] you know
[22:28] when he was telling about the man
[22:33] right here is your husband the
[22:36] black-headed man
[22:38] she said yes sir kind of tall and so
[22:40] forth
[22:41] on down i said he has the same thing to
[22:43] confess
[22:44] to you all right and then brother
[22:46] brennan makes the statement he says
[22:48] no wonder brother johnson can't have a
[22:51] revival
[22:53] amen how many knows if you he with that
[22:56] and
[22:56] there's a deacon in the church and here
[22:59] he had that sin in his heart
[23:01] and that right unconfessed i made right
[23:04] here was a woman probably
[23:05] a sunday school teacher or whatever the
[23:08] spirit just can't move
[23:10] when our heart isn't right with god amen
[23:14] and i'll tell you this this is what the
[23:15] lord laid on my heart so i trust that
[23:17] it'll be
[23:17] that it was a blessing to all of you but
[23:20] i know the lord speaks to me lord
[23:22] show me if i can't see it lord go way
[23:25] down in the gable end of my soul father
[23:27] and bring it out
[23:28] because i want to be ready when you come

[23:30] these days

[24:17] giving you a
[24:18] minute to search your heart
[24:21] to dig way down somewhere in the past
[24:26] maybe eight years ago maybe 20 years ago
[24:29] 30 years ago people are affected
[24:33] and sometimes it lasts
[24:36] their whole life because they never
[24:38] really opened up their heart say god
[24:41] i never really did get over that
[24:44] i never really let go of that i never
[24:47] really cut loose
[24:48] i never really just brought that out and
[24:50] emptied myself out so that you could
[24:52] come and fill me up
[24:55] there's anybody in here this evening
[24:57] with all eyes closed in mind including
[25:00] you just want to say raise your hand and
[25:02] say god there's
[25:04] i want to make sure that there's nothing
[25:07] anywhere
[25:07] in my life that would hinder the moving
[25:11] of the holy spirit that would cause you
[25:15] not to be able to work through my life
[25:18] somewhere where i'm still in the way of
[25:21] you really living out your life the way
[25:23] that you want to live
[25:26] so that as the song says i want to have
[25:28] the compassion
[25:29] i want to have the love i want to have
[25:31] the forgiveness i want to have the grace
[25:33] i want to have the mercy i want to have
[25:35] everything that jesus had that's what i
[25:37] want to have
[25:40] that's what i want to be lord jesus i
[25:42] believe this congregation here tonight
[25:44] and both here in the streaming world
[25:45] i believe there's people out there that
[25:47] would say and raise your hand say god
[25:48] that's what i want lord
[25:51] lord if there's something down in my
[25:52] heart
[25:54] if there if i can't change lord jesus i
[25:56] ask god
[25:57] if i can't overcome this what is it
[26:00] that's keeping me from overcoming this
[26:02] what's keeping me from having the peace
[26:04] that passes understanding
[26:06] the joy unspeakable and full of glory
[26:08] that when i'm out there by myself it's
[26:10] just a fullness of joy
[26:12] you feel like screaming down through the
[26:14] woods or wherever it is
[26:15] or as the prophet that day did run
[26:17] around the tree just
[26:18] shouting god that's how we want to be we
