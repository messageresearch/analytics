[0:00] amen and it just turns them away from
[0:02] the message
[0:04] that's why they tuck tail and run when
[0:05] they hit 18 or whatever it might be or
[0:07] get a little money in their pocket
[0:08] amen it's not because they had no
[0:11] conviction toward what you were saying
[0:14] but if they ever get it they'll change
[0:18] they'll change right he said i've been a
[0:21] nazarite under god from my mother's womb
[0:23] he said if i be shaven
[0:25] my strength will go from me and i shall
[0:27] be weak and be like any other man now
[0:29] listen
[0:31] this is a perfect example of a man who
[0:33] loses his conviction
[0:37] and god because his name was on the book
[0:42] hallelujah delilah could cause his hair
[0:46] to be shaven listen to me church
[0:49] she could not touch the root
[0:56] the root stayed intact
[1:01] that's why you could stand there and say
[1:02] oh lord one more time
[1:05] and shook the pillars down around every
[1:06] one of them because no matter what she
[1:08] might have done to his hair
[1:10] she couldn't touch the root and that's
[1:12] where true conviction lied
[1:15] is at the root amen when he got
[1:18] destitute desperate
[1:20] and finally give his heart to god and
[1:22] his strength to god
[1:23] there are more philistines killed in
[1:25] that particular time than all through
[1:26] his whole ministry
[1:29] oh oh that seems odd don't it but that's
[1:32] that's the power of conviction
[1:34] now determine me to first timothy
[1:36] chapter 4 verse 1
[1:38] 1 and two now notice here in the last
[1:41] days the way that
[1:42] uh the holy ghost is going to deal with
[1:46] people and it's gonna
[1:47] be very straight there's not gonna be
[1:49] any cutting of the corners it's gonna be
[1:51] very very transparent
[1:54] very clear the message is going to be
[1:56] clear not ambiguous not
[1:58] not kind of a well i don't know what
[2:00] he's really trying to say no the message
[2:02] will be plain
[2:03] it'll be plain first timothy chapter
[2:06] four verse one how the spirit speaketh
[2:08] expressingly
[2:10] amen that means plain spoken that in the
[2:12] latter times some
[2:13] shall depart from the faith giving heed
[2:16] to seducing spirits and doctrines of
[2:18] devils
[2:19] speaking lies in hypocrisy
[2:23] having their conscience seared
[2:26] with a hot iron
[2:29] now this word that he uses here is is uh
[2:32] the greek word carrizo which is where we
[2:34] get the english word cauterize
[2:38] jonathan jones you know many of you know
[2:40] jonathan his grandmother had an accident
[2:41] when she was a young girl and
[2:43] lost one of her arms and
[2:47] when they had this part where the injury
[2:50] was at
[2:52] in order to sustain her health
[2:55] and to heal bring healing to the wounds
[2:57] of course we know doctors don't heal but
[2:59] to put her in a position where god could
[3:00] heal they had to take an instrument and
[3:03] go down through each one's nerves or
[3:05] that arm where the injury was
[3:07] and go right down through those places
[3:09] and completely sever that nerve ending
[3:12] and then tie those loose places together
[3:14] to make a place where
[3:16] her body could begin the healing process
[3:20] and once those nerves are cauterized
[3:23] there's no more feeling in it
[3:26] it's completely dead there's not an
[3:28] instrument in the world that can
[3:30] resurrect it
[3:31] the life source that would repair the
[3:34] damaged nerve
[3:35] has now been cut off and there's no more
[3:37] blood that can flow to that spot to ever
[3:38] resurrect it again
[3:41] and now here paul is speaking that in
[3:44] the last days
[3:46] that some would not have body parts
[3:49] cauterized
[3:51] but their conscience would be seared or
[3:55] cauterized with a hot iron
[3:58] meaning that they can come to church and
[4:00] sit down
[4:01] and hear the preaching of the gospel and
[4:03] remain so numb
[4:05] that nothing that's said or nothing the
[4:06] holy ghost does moves them
[4:09] they just sit and look there's no way of
[4:11] resurrecting their soul there's no way
[4:13] of resurrecting their passion
[4:14] there's no way of resurrecting their
[4:16] feeling or their conviction it's been
[4:18] completely cut off altogether
[4:22] notice this in ii corinthians chapter
[4:26] seven
[4:28] beginning at verse 8. now the apostle
[4:31] paul
[4:31] is trying to deal with this corinthians
[4:33] bunch
[4:35] if you want to read that with me this is
[4:36] the second book of corinthians 7 and
[4:38] verse 8. and you know he had a mess on
[4:42] his hands
[4:44] i mean he was dealing with those folks
[4:46] down there that evening like i i i i
[4:48] mean in corinthians
[4:52] and he was dealing with them everywhere
[4:53] he'd have
[4:55] they had this problem and that problem
[4:57] and all kinds of little things here and
[4:58] there
[4:59] yeah so paul writes him a letter
[5:02] now watch he said in another place he
[5:04] said though i'm not there in bodies
[5:06] i've judged it in the spirit remember
[5:09] was reported from the house of chloe
[5:11] that a man was living with his fat with
[5:12] his
[5:12] uh uh with his father's wife
[5:19] for though i made you sorry with a
[5:20] letter i do not repent though i did
[5:23] repent
[5:25] that's a strange thing in it sorry but i
[5:28] ain't sorry
[5:29] well my mama used to want me brother al
[5:31] she'd lay it on me and she'd say i'm
[5:32] sorry but i'm not sorry
[5:36] even though human is speaking she didn't
[5:38] want to have to correct me but she had
[5:40] to
[5:41] paul saying here i i made you sorry
[5:45] yeah for i perceive that the same
[5:48] epistle hath made you sorry
[5:50] though it were but for a season but now
[5:54] i rejoice
[5:54] watch now not that you were made sorry
[5:58] but that you sorrowed to repentance
[6:01] amen for you were made sorry after a
[6:05] godly manner
[6:07] and you might receive damage by us
[6:10] and nothing in other words paul's saying
[6:12] i didn't come trying to hurt your
[6:13] feelings
[6:15] i didn't come making this gospel
[6:16] personal i didn't try to call
[6:18] individuals out to shame them or to make
[6:20] it some personal affair
[6:23] but the purpose of my letter was to try
[6:25] to strike in your hearts
[6:26] some element of conviction that lets you
[6:28] know you've got to get these matters
[6:30] straightened up before the lord
[6:32] amen for godly sorrow what
[6:42] so doesn't it seem like in this day and
[6:44] age we're getting the car
[6:46] before the horse quite a bit
[6:49] we preached good sermons about the bride
[6:51] the elected and how elected and how
[6:52] bright and how elected and how bright we
[6:54] are
[6:56] we get people shouting we get them
[6:57] rejoicing we get them running to the
[6:58] altar
[6:59] and they'll rejoice and they'll shout
[7:00] under the understanding we are the bride
[7:02] we are the bride we are the bride
[7:04] and many of them that are standing right
[7:05] there they're as sinners as the devil is
[7:14] so why don't we start with godly sorrow
[7:18] well you know why we don't because that
[7:20] kind of preaching has become quite
[7:21] unpopular these days
[7:24] we don't like the preachers that get up
[7:26] in the platform and preach to us in a
[7:28] manner to make us feel everybody
[7:30] ready uncomfortable
[7:34] we don't like them sermons how
[7:37] dare he make me feel in such a way or
[7:40] not while that preacher mind his own
[7:41] business because i'm called of god not
[7:43] to
[7:44] i'm called of god to be nosy i'm called
[7:47] of god to get in your business
[7:48] i'm called of god to get in your face
[7:50] i'm called of god to preach the truth to
[7:52] you
[7:52] and get plumbed into your bedroom if i
[7:54] need to
[7:57] you understand what i mean i'm trying to
[8:00] say the secret places
[8:02] preachers ain't got no business in your
[8:03] bedroom i'm saying the dark places
[8:07] i'm called of god to preach in a manner
[8:10] that even what the king says in his
[8:12] bedchamber
[8:14] god can bring it down
[8:19] preachers are called a medal and if he's
[8:22] a good one
[8:23] he'll meddle well
[8:28] and if he's a sorry noah account
[8:29] hollywood evangelist or whatever he
[8:31] might be
[8:32] you'll leave out here feeling so good
[8:33] glory to god i'm the elected of god i'm
[8:35] going to make the rapture
[8:37] and then what happens on monday when you
[8:40] face you again
[8:42] so i i've got to where i don't even
[8:43] preach about people facing the devil
[8:46] because we're kind of behind that now
[8:48] really your biggest enemy
[8:50] ain't facing the devil on monday morning
[8:51] i'm just facing you again
[8:54] praise the lord somebody it's being able
[8:56] to wake up and look yourself in the
[8:58] mirror and go
[8:58] okay what am i going to mess up today
[9:02] how am i going to fall short today come
[9:04] on don't y'all look at me that way
[9:06] right the great enemy that lays within
[9:10] this flesh there's an
[9:11] element of it that we know we've got to
[9:13] face that when we walk out of here
[9:16] how am i going to overcome myself
[9:20] i've got to have somebody preach it to
[9:22] me in a manner of such conviction
[9:25] whether when i walk out of the church
[9:26] stores there's got to be that
[9:28] element of oh god i'm going to i'm
[9:30] determined
[9:31] i am determined i'm going to change from
[9:33] today on god helping me
[9:37] friends i love to feel good i love to
[9:39] feel the holy ghost if the holy spirit
[9:41] fell in this building
[9:42] i would encourage every shout we could
[9:44] get
[9:46] but i've prayed for tens of thousands of
[9:48] around the world that have shouted until
[9:50] they've passed out on the floor and then
[9:51] a month later find out they're living in
[9:53] polygamy
[9:54] they're drunkards they smoke secretly
[9:56] and on and on and on
[9:57] and on
[10:00] what good does all of the rejoicing and
[10:02] the running and all of that do
[10:04] if the if the absence of conviction
[10:10] praise god i can certainly feel the holy
[10:14] ghost is pleased with this tonight
[10:18] can certainly feel the holy ghost is
[10:19] pleased with this tonight
[10:22] that's what i look for is i look for
[10:26] that element of conviction in a church
[10:29] you won't know how to determine where i
[10:30] preach
[10:32] when i go somewhere and i preach and the
[10:34] people still have that feeling of
[10:36] wanting to get rightly gone
[10:39] i know this is going to sound strange to
[10:40] you maybe i've done a lady too much i
[10:43] don't know people say i always
[10:44] you tell them too much i don't know how
[10:46] not to tell them i i just quit
[10:48] gaging what do they need to hear what
[10:50] don't they need to hear
[10:51] i just figured i say it i'll let the
[10:53] chips fall when they made god work on
[10:54] that
[10:58] but i think we've come too far to keep
[11:00] putting seven things in the backyard
[11:05] but there's been times in my ministry
[11:06] where i've actually shunned
[11:08] some of the big revival meetings that
[11:10] i've been invited to
[11:12] because i knew some of those meetings
[11:13] were nothing but modern day pentecostal
[11:15] workups
[11:17] and i knew if i really preached where i
[11:19] needed to preach i'd never be asked back
[11:21] again
[11:23] so rather than fool with it i just wait
[11:26] on the lord
[11:27] wait on the lord wait on the lord one
[11:29] year becomes two
[11:30] two becomes twelve twelve comes fifteen
[11:32] all of a sudden i see a little entrance
[11:34] and the lord said okay now it's time and
[11:35] just like i always know
[11:37] it's usually my last bunch of sermons
[11:41] because i refuse as the gods put it in
[11:44] my heart this way
[11:46] i refuse to stand before him on the day
[11:48] of judgment knowing that people
[11:49] needed a deeper experience and be guilty
[11:53] of knowing how to take it there
[11:55] and not take it there
[11:58] i'd rather preach it in a manner that
[12:00] strikes your conscience
[12:02] and something begins to churn in your
[12:03] heart stirring up your pure man's what
[12:05] peter said
[12:07] we need that stirring of the holy ghost
[12:10] hallelujah notice the deceived church by
[12:13] the world now this is in
[12:14] june of 59 brother brown's really
[12:16] upbraiding the tabernacle and i
[12:18] want to use this as an example for where
[12:21] we're at
[12:22] he starts out with revival in our day
[12:23] how can we have revival when we're so
[12:25] bound up
[12:26] he said we bound the holy spirit with
[12:28] our organizations and traditions
[12:30] we can't have a holy ghost revival he
[12:32] said amen i know that's scorching hot
[12:34] with the weather here
[12:35] he said but it's the truth how can we
[12:36] have a holy ghost revival when you're so
[12:38] bound and starchy they found
[12:42] your secret the world found your
[12:46] secret watch what he does you women all
[12:48] bob your hair
[12:50] goes like the world you men go out and
[12:51] act like the world tell jokes and dirty
[12:53] jokes and smoke a few cigarettes
[12:55] run out with a neighbor's wife and
[12:56] everything like that a little sociable
[12:58] drink to hold a job
[13:01] i'd rather lay on my branch on my
[13:03] stomach and my belly and eat soda
[13:05] crackers drink branched water and stay
[13:06] clean and fear before god then
[13:07] compromise for any kind of a job
[13:10] he said that's right that's true stay
[13:13] true to god
[13:16] samson the philistines is on the branham
[13:18] tabernacle worldliness and is creeping
[13:20] in among you
[13:22] now this is 1959.
[13:26] now what was brother branham trying to
[13:27] show with him examples about the man and
[13:30] the woman he's trying to show the people
[13:32] you have lost your conviction
[13:38] let me tell you something brother a man
[13:40] and a woman stay right with god
[13:42] and stay under the prayer of life and
[13:44] convicting power
[13:45] that person you'll never catch them
[13:47] commit an adult
[13:49] tree and running around and smoking
[13:50] cigarettes and
[13:53] let that man or woman stand under the
[13:54] convicting power of the holy ghost you
[13:56] will not find them let him get away from
[13:57] it one time
[13:59] and but for god's mercy there will be a
[14:00] mess tomorrow night
[14:03] that's the secret is the power of god
[14:06] inside the bride
[14:07] that is attached to our conviction
[14:11] have you exposed your secret that god
[14:13] gave you when you were wallowing in a
[14:15] sawdust
[14:19] think of that have you let it creep out
[14:23] by social formal worship
[14:30] in our mind social formal worship is
[14:33] kind of that real quiet backward
[14:36] let me tell you something brother
[14:39] formality takes on many different forms
[14:44] coming to the altar jumping and
[14:47] screaming and shouting and praising the
[14:49] lord and speaking unknown languages and
[14:51] running around the church
[14:52] can become just as much a form
[14:56] as somebody forgive this arm crossers
[14:57] i'm not poking on you
[14:59] but for somebody that's just sitting in
[15:00] the pew
[15:04] that can become just as much a form as
[15:06] the backward stuff
[15:10] social formal worship social worship you
[15:12] know what social work is
[15:13] where in the world do we come to such a
[15:15] place in the message where we clap in
[15:16] unison rather than older amen
[15:18] are we the ball are we watching an opera
[15:23] where did all the clappers come from
[15:26] i've been in so many churches where they
[15:27] don't even say amen anymore there's clap
[15:31] that's social formal worship
[15:34] it's easy to stand there and clap in
[15:36] unison at every word
[15:39] amen go watch john hagee and joe osteen
[15:44] watch joe joel osean when he gets up
[15:47] there and he's and he hits one big point
[15:49] give him praise and they'll clap in
[15:52] unison that can become just as much a
[15:55] formality
[15:58] as people sitting there staring at the
[15:59] floor
[16:02] some of y'all didn't like it but i can't
[16:03] help truth anyhow
[16:06] god in the church church book brother
[16:08] man said god wants listen to this word
[16:11] spontaneous i'm trying to underline it
[16:15] christian worship spontaneous christian
[16:17] worship isn't this is what we do
[16:19] every time we come to church to keep
[16:22] out of that if you're one that raises up
[16:24] your right right arm
[16:26] come church raise up the left one and
[16:28] there's somebody says amen amen amen
[16:30] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah change
[16:33] it up don't get stuck in a rut in reform
[16:37] and don't just do what everybody else is
[16:38] doing
[16:41] so if you're in a church and everybody's
[16:42] hollering praise the lord and amen
[16:44] be the one that sits quiet
[16:47] oh here we go flipping the coin
[16:51] and if you're in a church where
[16:52] everybody says quiet and look you'll be
[16:54] the one holiday man
[16:58] come on evening light talk a little
[17:00] while
[17:02] the formality is the lack it's the
[17:06] worship
[17:07] without conviction
[17:13] go talk to any of the people that come
[17:14] out of pentecost how many
[17:16] old-timers if i could be respectful that
[17:18] way
[17:19] come out of pentecost anybody abby solid
[17:22] you ever heard this expression hold on
[17:24] turn loose
[17:27] set big smile on his face back there
[17:30] everyone they got to the altar one was
[17:31] beating them on the back telling them to
[17:33] hold on
[17:34] and the other one was beating them on
[17:35] the back telling them to turn loose
[17:40] my mama used to work the episode the
[17:42] alters and apostolic
[17:45] and she would work him to one two three
[17:46] four o'clock in the morning and the
[17:48] purpose of it was
[17:49] brother uh john was to get him to the
[17:51] spot to where they would speak in
[17:53] tongues
[17:54] that's formality maybe god didn't call
[17:58] them to speak in tongues
[17:59] maybe god didn't want them speaking in
[18:01] tongues maybe god wanted that individual
[18:03] crying until they had no more tears
[18:06] who am i to beat them on the back and
[18:07] tell them what they're supposed to do
[18:14] well brother tom i've enjoyed the years
[18:15] we've had together buddy
[18:19] i keep this up all right
[18:24] he said god can come down and perform
[18:25] miracles and go right down through the
[18:27] audience and tell
[18:28] people the secrets of their heart
[18:29] everything heal the sick and afflict to
[18:31] do signs and wonders
[18:32] preach his word as hard as they can and
[18:34] the holy ghost
[18:36] will move and people will say well
[18:40] i guess that's all right
[18:44] we enjoy listening to it once in a while
[18:46] if we're not too
[18:47] tired that's branham tabernacle
[18:52] the philistines is on thee
[18:56] he wants to pass that way you know
[18:57] conviction can make you restless
[19:02] you know in our in our our meetings
[19:04] whenever i'm i'm if i'm in charge
[19:06] of any kind of meeting being an outreach
[19:09] or whatever it is
[19:10] and there's deacons there i always
[19:13] instruct the deacons
[19:15] that when conviction is on to pay
[19:18] attention to the people that are running
[19:19] in and out
[19:20] that are beginning to move around talk
[19:22] fidget pay attention close to them i
[19:24] always instruct them this way
[19:26] when conviction gets on a person they'll
[19:29] start acting out in a way
[19:30] to get it off of them i've seen them run
[19:34] out of the bathroom 30 times and you
[19:38] know what i do when i see him doing that
[19:42] i start preaching right down about right
[19:44] in here
[19:46] that way i can catch him eyeball to
[19:48] eyeball every time i come through that
[19:50] door
[19:52] conviction will make them do a lot of
[19:54] things they'll act restless they'll act
[19:56] wild
[20:00] all trying to push off that feeling of
[20:02] conviction
[20:04] and yet when god's got your number
[20:07] you couldn't run you couldn't hide
[20:12] because he will bring you to the altar
[20:13] one way or another
[20:17] jonah proved to us that you can't run
[20:18] from god
[20:21] come on somebody it proves to us that
[20:24] just a little touch of conviction
[20:27] amen can put a person in a dire strait
[20:30] till they're almost crazy out of their
[20:31] mind
[20:33] listen to this remark how many of us
[20:36] would really pray this way
[20:38] brother brahman said for you sinners in
[20:40] here tonight that didn't get right in
[20:42] this meeting
[20:43] i'm going to pray that god makes your
[20:45] bed so hard and your food tastes so bad
[20:50] and your friends be so unlovely till you
[20:53] get right with god
[20:58] how many of us with the right
[20:59] understanding would really pray that way
[21:02] you know what we pray god bless them
[21:04] make life a flower bed of ease for them
[21:06] if it's our youngins or if it's our
[21:08] grandkids or family member we pray god
[21:11] give them a good day
[21:12] i don't want to pray that if they're in
[21:13] sin god make them so miserable they
[21:16] don't know what tomorrow holds
[21:18] god make their bed sleep see already
[21:20] it's crickets in here
[21:21] but this is the way we need to pray we
[21:23] need this kind of conviction
[21:25] amen to father call our sons and
[21:27] daughters and our grandkids
[21:28] until they can come back to god and say
[21:30] i am miserable
[21:32] i need a move of the holy ghost in my
[21:33] life
[21:37] as long as they're comfortable they're
[21:39] never going to want to get out of that
[21:43] god make uncomfortable if you've got to
[21:47] make it hurt but do all but don't take
[21:50] their life
[21:53] oh hallelujah brother said a good
[21:56] praying wife or mother
[21:58] now listen here mom's wives
[22:02] a good praying wife or mother can do
[22:04] more for the kingdom of god on her knees
[22:06] at home
[22:07] than sometimes a preacher can do on the
[22:10] platform
[22:14] why because i can preach but if there's
[22:17] no conviction they won't listen
[22:19] but you get a good old holy ghost mama
[22:23] that's got a little understanding about
[22:25] how to pray
[22:26] and let her get on her knees and start
[22:28] calling out them boys and them girl's
[22:29] name every day
[22:30] and she got a prayer list out before and
[22:32] she starts calling out maybe it's susie
[22:34] or johnny
[22:34] oh god make john he's so miserable he
[22:37] needs you but
[22:38] just lord keep your hand on his life
[22:40] until he can get right
[22:44] it wouldn't be too many turns of the sun
[22:46] you'd be getting phone calls in the
[22:47] middle of the night
[22:50] restless i'm miserable what do i do
[22:54] glad you called me i'm going to tell you
[22:57] you don't have to tell them cut wait and
[22:58] come to church pray with them right
[23:00] there
[23:01] don't wait when conviction's on pray
[23:03] with them right there
[23:06] that's why you the church of the lord
[23:07] jesus christ you don't need to speak
[23:09] confident in just brother tom's prayers
[23:11] or sister byler's prayers or the other
[23:13] leaders of this church
[23:14] you need to have such a relationship
[23:16] with god that if
[23:18] your lost loved ones and your wayward
[23:19] ones come and call you on the telephone
[23:21] or send you a text message
[23:23] you want to be able to write the words
[23:24] back to them in a text message
[23:26] that has such power of the holy ghost
[23:28] that the holy ghost can mix them right
[23:30] where they're sitting there
[23:31] because of you
[23:34] because this message ain't supposed to
[23:36] be about us preachers or preachers lives
[23:39] this message is about the body of christ
[23:41] finding their position
[23:44] yes
[23:48] again the man says you know you can find
[23:50] plenty of excuses when conviction is on
[23:53] that's another tell sign of
[23:57] when you got somebody under conviction
[23:58] watch them well
[24:00] that's a deep subject
[24:05] they'll make every excuse in the world
[24:06] why they can't be here or there or a or
[24:08] b or c
[24:10] well that's all right you know
[24:11] conviction is on
[24:13] again in purpose straight by perfect
[24:14] weakness brother i said conviction
[24:16] you don't have to just say one thing
[24:18] brother
[24:19] god's there and he's done the work while
[24:21] peter yet spake these words
[24:22] the holy ghost fell on him that heard
[24:23] the word see no water call no such thing
[24:26] in the bible
[24:26] when you persuade and pull and scare
[24:29] people
[24:30] and talk people in
[24:37] if a volleyball game will get them in
[24:41] a soccer game will put them out
[24:45] if a hot dog roast will bring them in a
[24:47] hamburger supper will run around
[24:50] if i stood up here and got y'all cried
[24:52] about it
[24:53] your grandmother prayed for you glory to
[24:56] god
[24:57] she prayed for you that you would get
[24:59] saved
[25:03] you come to this you come because you're
[25:05] feeling toward grandma
[25:07] you didn't come because god convicted
[25:09] your horn
[25:11] i'm not making fun i'm just trying to
[25:12] dramatize it for you this is how
[25:14] deep people get into the emotions of it
[25:16] they pull with and i don't doubt that
[25:17] they don't mean it with all of their
[25:18] heart but it's not
[25:20] scriptural
[25:23] did you know there's never a call made
[25:24] in the bible
[25:30] the word was preached and convictions
[25:31] set in
[25:33] this we will do if god permit
[25:37] i'll continue to make all the calls i'll
[25:39] continue to call sinners to the front
[25:42] backsliders whatever they are christians
[25:44] i'll continue to make calls
[25:47] but really that's not the way that that
[25:51] is not the evidence that something's
[25:53] happening
[25:55] the evidence of something has taken
[25:56] place is when there's such conviction
[25:58] there
[25:59] i like to see it when they come and they
[26:02] can't even talk
[26:04] i was in arkansas preaching the weekend
[26:08] and sunday morning i i i we were singing
[26:11] a song and i was getting ready to close
[26:12] it and all
[26:12] once the holy spirit grabbed me and said
[26:14] make a call make a prayer line
[26:16] so i stopped the people i had them bow
[26:17] their heads a moment and i started
[26:18] talking to him i
[26:19] said now the lord's dealing with you
[26:20] come on and one after another just
[26:23] started
[26:24] lining up there was about 12 of them i
[26:25] guess 8 or 10
[26:27] 12 something like that and and i and i
[26:30] started praying and
[26:31] the ones that were under such deep
[26:33] conviction they couldn't even speak
[26:36] i i said don't worry about it i'm gonna
[26:40] pray for you
[26:43] it bothers me when i see people come to
[26:45] an altar
[26:46] and they're supposed to be under a deep
[26:47] conviction and they walk with him i need
[26:49] the holy ghost to need to be closer to
[26:50] god
[26:51] you know what i want to tell them many
[26:52] times you go back and sit down until
[26:54] you're serious
[26:55] because that's not the attitude of
[26:56] somebody who's serious
[27:02] some flipping thing you understand me
[27:06] if you ask a preacher that and you mean
[27:07] it in your heart you be your own judge
[27:09] of what you mean in your heart
[27:11] but the majority of the time when people
[27:12] are asking things you know as well as i
[27:14] do
[27:14] it's for the sake of asking
[27:18] because they feel like they got to do
[27:19] some religious duty
[27:21] to stay right or well he's there he can
[27:24] pray for me well let's just go up there
[27:27] no no when you're really sincere now
[27:30] i've had him come and just as simply say
[27:32] i need to be closer to god i can feel it
[27:34] i feel under the anointing when i'm
[27:35] standing up there and somebody wants to
[27:36] be close to god i can feel it but i can
[27:38] also tell when they're not too serious
[27:40] about it
[27:42] i just want to be close to god yeah
[27:46] if you really do then when i pray for
[27:50] you
[27:50] or somebody else but i'm talking about
[27:51] me personally when i pray for you
[27:53] something is going to happen
[27:55] why does some of these ones that come
[27:57] and say i want to be closer to god when
[27:58] i pray for him it's like praying for
[28:00] this pew right here
[28:02] no anointing no faith no movement no
[28:04] pull
[28:05] you know why people were saying things
[28:09] out of routine
[28:12] out of a religious feeling not genuine
[28:15] conviction before the lord
[28:18] because if it's real conviction and you
[28:20] come to a preaching
[28:21] say i want to be right with god hey
[28:23] buddy i've had to go strike him before i
[28:26] even get to lay my hands on him and i'll
[28:27] step back and say you believe
[28:29] it's already done yes i said go on and
[28:30] take it then
[28:34] i was in a revival up in ottawa then uh
[28:37] in uh by niagara falls
[28:38] preaching a young people's meeting and
[28:41] there was about i'd say 50 young people
[28:42] that come up to the front
[28:44] trying to watch the time
[28:47] and i would say just calling a number 25
[28:50] of them were sincere
[28:52] 25 of them were doing it for the sake of
[28:53] doing it you know what was amazing to me
[28:56] the ones that come up there were just up
[28:58] there because that was the routine of it
[29:00] that when i went to go pray for them it
[29:02] was as dry as it could be
[29:04] you know what i started doing after
[29:06] about two or three of them
[29:07] i took a step back and i started talking
[29:09] to them
[29:10] i asked one young man do you really mean
[29:14] that with all of your heart
[29:15] sure why why do you mean it
[29:19] this whole preacher was standing by the
[29:21] time he went
[29:26] and i thought to myself i'm sorry that
[29:27] you're too lazy to do the job
[29:29] but i'm going to do some work while i'm
[29:30] here
[29:32] i said why why do you want god to move
[29:34] for you
[29:36] well i need to be right i said that
[29:38] ain't the way you come to the lord son
[29:41] if you know it is a desperate thing
[29:44] that this thing is plaguing you this
[29:46] thing is overcoming you and you're never
[29:48] gonna get right with god
[29:49] never gonna get to the place to where
[29:50] you have true victory unless you've got
[29:52] that true desperation in your heart
[29:55] and i sat him down again that preacher
[29:58] went
[30:01] i made him sit there for about 30
[30:02] minutes
[30:04] i walked over to him i nudged him on the
[30:06] shoulder i said how do you feel about it
[30:07] now he
[30:09] said you know what after thinking about
[30:12] what you said brother ben you're right
[30:14] i wasn't sincere enough about it i said
[30:17] now tell me why
[30:18] do you want god to move for you he
[30:20] started weeping
[30:21] he said because this thing has plagued
[30:23] me all my life
[30:24] and i don't know how to whip it i said
[30:26] now god can move for you
[30:28] what was the difference that touch of
[30:30] conviction
[30:32] that little something that raises up in
[30:34] the heart where you know
[30:36] god is your only hope
[30:42] routines will never produce a rapture
[30:48] huh i said routines will never produce
[30:53] the rapture
[30:58] amen brother batman said that's right
[31:03] he said then he said people must come
[31:05] sanely
[31:07] soberly under conviction
[31:11] and receive christ the first thing they
[31:12] do they receive christ sitting in their
[31:14] seat
[31:15] next be baptized in the name of jesus
[31:17] christ for the mission of those sins
[31:20] those things that they have been
[31:22] convinced that they're wrong
[31:23] see there's the baby doll
[31:29] because we we've gotten to such a trend
[31:31] friends where when it comes to preaching
[31:33] i mean us us as human beings if we be
[31:36] honest
[31:37] it's that's hard sermons like that
[31:40] or somebody just keep driving that nail
[31:42] home until they get you a place to where
[31:44] you're convinced
[31:46] that is a difficult job to do for a
[31:48] bunch of hard-headed people that don't
[31:50] believe that you're telling the truth
[31:54] when you try to tell a bunch of message
[31:55] people that they need a deeper move of
[31:56] the holy ghost they will sit on you like
[31:58] i
[31:59] i don't know what they'd sit on like i
[32:01] don't know that the catholics would be
[32:02] as stubborn as some of
[32:03] our people would be i've had church of
[32:06] god apostolic pentecostal and every one
[32:08] of them that had a whole lot more tender
[32:10] spirit than some of our arrogant people
[32:12] around this message
[32:15] why because we're convinced brother brad
[32:17] we're convinced
[32:18] that we're okay we believe a prophet we
[32:21] believe a message
[32:22] and then we come to a message church we
[32:23] pay our tithes offerings
[32:25] we've got our pastor we've got our post
[32:27] to duty
[32:29] what do we need more of god for
[32:34] this is why you need to be convinced
[32:37] and sometimes the holy ghost has got to
[32:39] drive that now so hard that you feel
[32:41] grieved at
[32:41] him
[32:45] you've heard me use the expression
[32:47] before people tell me after service he
[32:48] looked right at me when he said that
[32:50] and i hope the holy ghost gets so deep
[32:52] in your tater patch that he looks at
[32:54] that
[32:54] you're the only one in the building i
[32:55] was looking at
[32:58] because then that's when results will
[32:59] come
[33:01] sure praise the lord
[33:05] he said they've reminded of their sins
[33:06] because they've repented but baptized as
[33:08] a memorial to god
[33:10] it's i've received christ as my personal
[33:11] savior then you're a candidate for the
[33:13] holy ghost he said but many people
[33:14] continue on
[33:16] persuading and calling the altar and so
[33:18] forth which that's all right i'll go
[33:19] with that perfectly right as far as i'm
[33:21] concerned
[33:21] anybody that wants to do it but it's not
[33:23] scriptural
[33:25] he said i'd like to stay with the
[33:26] scripture now what's brother i'm
[33:27] referring to
[33:29] as many message people have said through
[33:31] the years do away with order calls we
[33:33] don't need them that's not what brother
[33:34] branham is saying
[33:36] that is a preacher's agenda and not what
[33:38] the prophet of god said
[33:42] this we will do if god permit but the
[33:46] idea was
[33:47] not if you need to get right with god it
[33:50] takes an altar call to do it
[33:54] do you know if you walked into this
[33:56] church tonight
[33:58] and if no more than just what i little
[34:00] bit i preached
[34:01] has pricked your heart and sitting right
[34:04] there in your seat you can feel on the
[34:06] inside of you
[34:08] you know what that that brother he's
[34:09] telling me the truth i need to be deeper
[34:12] i need to be more sincere i need to get
[34:15] back that feeling maybe in your mind you
[34:16] started thinking i remember when it used
[34:18] to be that way don't you
[34:20] understand what's happening the altar
[34:22] call is taking place
[34:23] right then
[34:26] because that's what the benefit of the
[34:28] altar call is
[34:31] is to get the people in that mode of
[34:33] thinking
[34:37] you see when the children of israel
[34:39] would make great conquests
[34:42] god would tell them when they come
[34:44] across jordan pile up stones
[34:47] as a memorial you remember
[34:50] the little fringe that the little woman
[34:52] touched remember
[34:54] if you go back in the old testament the
[34:56] reason they put that fringe on the
[34:58] garment of the israelites
[35:00] that fringe on the garment of the
[35:02] israelites was a memorial of
[35:04] god's deliverance and when she touched
[35:08] the hem that fringe of his garment
[35:10] she was remembering god's deliverance
[35:14] in her own body she was testifying by
[35:17] touching if i could touch
[35:18] just the hem glory to god
[35:22] then god would have to remember his word
[35:24] that he is a deliverer
[35:32] so sometimes you tell stories as brother
[35:35] branham did
[35:37] but sometimes god can get your attention
[35:39] in different ways
[35:40] can i get a few minutes of your time i'm
[35:42] out of notes i could move to the next
[35:44] sermon but i think we're doing pretty
[35:45] good are you
[35:49] but there was a man he was hunting with
[35:51] that they used to call old lizard eyes
[35:57] and brother branham never quoted a
[35:58] scripture to him
[36:00] brother branham never said hey i'm
[36:02] elijah you better get right
[36:07] he pulled out a little whistle and
[36:09] called for a baby deer to come out
[36:12] and burt was going to blow the heart out
[36:14] of the mother
[36:16] that come looking for that baby deer
[36:20] an old bert looking at that mother doe
[36:22] or that mother dear
[36:24] got so under conviction
[36:27] so brother branson said i turned my head
[36:29] waiting for the shot to go obviously
[36:30] when i looked he said the gun was
[36:31] shaking like this
[36:33] said billy lead me to that jesus you've
[36:34] been talking about
[36:40] my point is friends when you have a
[36:42] heart that god can deal with
[36:44] he can use anything to get your
[36:48] attention
[36:49] [Applause]
[36:50] raise me to god
[36:54] the key of it is just be able to have
[36:58] your attention god
[37:00] oh praise the lord amen just be in a
[37:03] position where god can
[37:06] turn on the light
[37:11] friends don't take this wrong it i i
[37:14] know this
[37:14] this sounds so out of season
[37:18] i'm tired of meetings where people are
[37:21] hollering
[37:22] shouting jumping i'm wore out with them
[37:24] i love it
[37:25] i appreciate it but i'm wore out with
[37:28] them
[37:30] because i'll tell you what i see i see a
[37:33] lot of people that are getting enthused
[37:35] about a mess
[37:36] they know nothing about
[37:39] i see a lot of people get excited about
[37:40] a truth
[37:42] that they cannot share with you from a
[37:45] personal experience
[37:49] i'm not against worship you know me i
[37:52] love to hear the saints of god praise
[37:53] the lord
[37:55] and if you get stimulated and start
[37:56] shouting i'll encourage you i'll start
[37:58] screaming with you
[37:59] if you rejoice i'll rejoice with you i
[38:01] won't shut that down
[38:04] but we got to come to a spot to where at
[38:06] some point in our preaching
[38:09] that the power of conviction becomes
[38:12] so real to where it stops us in our
[38:16] tracks it makes us think for a little
[38:19] while
[38:22] do you know that in some circles it
[38:23] would be absolutely a
[38:25] failure of a meeting if a man preached
[38:29] to seven or eight or nine hundred a
[38:31] thousand people
[38:32] and all of them got to the end of the
[38:33] service and just sat there and thought
[38:38] just sat there with their head down you
[38:40] know as people do
[38:42] maybe some with their hand over their
[38:44] eyes or you know those expressions and
[38:46] those bodily expressions when people are
[38:48] under that depth of conviction
[38:52] and if the preacher just had to stand up
[38:54] there and just mourn over his own bible
[38:56] god help me
[38:57] you know in certain circles around this
[38:59] message that would be considered a
[39:01] failure
[39:03] of a service but what is the greater
[39:07] failure
[39:09] to have a camp meeting in louisiana or
[39:11] winter youth retreat or
[39:13] some of the young people's meetings here
[39:15] brother tom or some other revival
[39:16] brother joseph has him back in
[39:18] murfreesboro
[39:20] nothing against him but is it is it a
[39:22] success if everybody comes up and
[39:24] screams and hollers and jumps and dance
[39:26] and then when they walk out they're
[39:28] living the same old way
[39:30] have the same old feelings that they've
[39:32] always had they still got bitterness
[39:34] they still got hatred they still got
[39:36] contention and they still got envy but
[39:37] they felt good while they was here
[39:40] but it didn't cause anybody to repent
[39:44] one of the greatest revivals i was in i
[39:47] was working between two churches that
[39:48] had split
[39:51] it ain't my first rodeo
[39:55] and these churches had bitter
[39:56] disagreements against each other
[40:00] and i happened to have enough favor with
[40:01] all of them with both sides to where i
[40:03] got
[40:04] service together i got to the end of the
[40:06] service and i started preaching
[40:09] about love and what it meant to love one
[40:11] another
[40:12] one of the greatest revivals i was in
[40:14] was when i stepped back from the
[40:15] platform and i said now if anybody in
[40:17] here
[40:18] really wants to serve god go to your
[40:20] brother and your sister right now
[40:22] make that thing right with them that you
[40:24] know ain't right
[40:27] one two and three and four
[40:30] and five and six before i know that
[40:31] they're standing in corners huddling
[40:33] together
[40:35] what i do i stood up and prayed for them
[40:39] god help them help them work it out help
[40:42] them sort the details
[40:44] help them get the feeling right in their
[40:45] heart
[40:47] and you know by the time we got to the
[40:48] end of that service there was such an
[40:50] atmosphere beginning to pour into that
[40:51] place
[40:53] then we shouted the rest of the night
[40:55] [Laughter]
[40:59] but in some circles it'd be considered a
[41:01] failure without
[41:02] if the preacher didn't pass out praying
[41:04] for people
[41:06] but whatever happened old-fashioned
[41:08] conviction
[41:12] where we just sit and thank
[41:15] god what is the condition of my heart
[41:20] you know the bible has a there's a
[41:21] scripture that i quote to myself a lot
[41:24] i quote it to people when they're trying
[41:25] to figure things out and
[41:27] make choices i quote this a lot to
[41:29] myself as well
[41:31] the bible in proverbs said ponder the
[41:34] direction of your feet
[41:36] and where they'll go
[41:39] what kind of service would you want to
[41:41] have
[41:43] let's just be honest i've come to help
[41:46] in a long time
[41:48] i've tried to get you wednesday night
[41:50] folks swinging
[41:54] running the backs i've done everything i
[41:56] can to get your worship into the best of
[41:58] my ability as an evangelist
[42:02] i'm not against people trying to be
[42:04] emotional getting amen and praising the
[42:06] lord
[42:07] and i'm probably going to continue
[42:09] hollering come on somebody
[42:12] i'm not giving those things up
[42:15] we need it and when we come to church we
[42:18] shouldn't have to sit there
[42:19] beat up and defeated we should have
[42:21] freedom of worship to be able to raise
[42:23] our hands when we feel like it
[42:26] sure or you ought to have that kind of
[42:30] liberty
[42:31] so yeah i encourage you to shout and
[42:33] amen and praise the lord
[42:35] and if you don't i'm probably going to
[42:37] scold you
[42:41] but it's not about the emotion
[42:44] in that regard it's about not letting
[42:46] the devil take your rights from you
[42:49] what really belongs to you
[42:53] but in some places it'd be considered a
[42:55] failure
[42:57] if we ended service and people wasn't
[42:58] crying and screaming
[43:02] but let me say it again what's wrong
[43:05] with the power of conviction coming so
[43:08] deeply
[43:10] so while you're sitting here in the
[43:11] church tonight you know there's somebody
[43:13] sitting here next to you that you've
[43:14] wronged
[43:15] had a feeling toward some little bitter
[43:18] thing that you ain't made right
[43:20] you want to see revival in the church go
[43:23] back and look at questions and answers
[43:25] when brother ben bryant stands up and
[43:27] said brother branham we knew there was a
[43:28] little rift in the brother
[43:30] and we started going to one another
[43:31] making it right you know what brother
[43:32] brown said
[43:33] when they were repenting each other like
[43:35] that he said that's real revival he
[43:36] called him
[43:40] if there's no love in this let's say
[43:43] there's not real love amongst the people
[43:45] here
[43:46] i'm not saying it's that way or not i'm
[43:48] just asking the question if you
[43:49] evaluated your heart and you think
[43:50] there's no love amongst this group
[43:52] why have you let your secret out
[43:57] have you let satan put bitterness where
[43:59] there used to be forgiveness
[44:01] if there's no real togetherness so let's
[44:04] say it another way
[44:06] if there's no gifts of the holy spirit
[44:07] among this body
[44:09] why have we let our secret out if we
[44:12] lost the conviction
[44:14] of coming to church and god if you want
[44:16] me to see a vision if you want me to
[44:18] lay hands on the sick i'm here i'm ready
[44:23] if there's nothing but a bunch of sin
[44:24] amongst this body
[44:26] why ask yourself the question
[44:29] have we let our secret out have we
[44:32] become so
[44:33] uncommitted and unconvinced that oh
[44:34] we're all right we're a bunch of message
[44:36] people
[44:36] we're the elite the top of the top
[44:40] if things exist amongst churches
[44:43] why don't we just stop and say why god
[44:47] why are we like that is it because i let
[44:50] my secret out
[44:52] is it because i failed to stay convicted
[44:53] that when that thing got in my heart
[44:55] about that sister or that brother
[44:57] rather than go to god and pray and say
[44:58] lord forgive me
[45:00] i just let that thing build and mount
[45:02] and grow and
[45:05] huh y'all are either quiet at me because
[45:09] you're mad or i've got you under
[45:10] conviction one of the other
[45:13] i'm just saying i'm not accusing i'm
[45:15] just asking questions
[45:17] this is typical stuff you could preach
[45:19] take this out and preach this very same
[45:20] thing to any church in this message
[45:22] i'm just using this for a point what
[45:25] questions could we say to ourselves
[45:27] we talk about all night prayings would
[45:30] that be great
[45:31] who's got time for all night prayer
[45:34] we got to get into the bed we're tired
[45:36] we got work in the morning
[45:39] but if we had the kind of conviction
[45:40] that we needed
[45:42] and we come into church here tonight and
[45:44] under a special circumstance
[45:46] maybe there was an emergency raised up
[45:47] in the church
[45:49] one felt it the other felt the other
[45:51] felt and struck like fire
[45:53] next thing you know people were laying
[45:54] on their face and their pews wherever
[45:56] they're at praying the next thing it was
[45:57] four or five o'clock in the morning
[45:58] they're still praying after god
[46:01] that doesn't mean every time you come to
[46:03] church to be spiritual
[46:04] you have to have an all-night prayer
[46:05] meeting but if you want to be spiritual
[46:10] have the conviction in your heart just
[46:13] say god i'm ready to do whatever it is
[46:14] you want me to do
[46:16] and be whatever it is you want me to be
[46:21] if you ever lose that secret delilah
[46:23] will shave you as sure as we're sitting
[46:25] here
[46:27] you'll lose the power and the glory and
[46:28] all that that should come with the
[46:29] church
[46:31] and if you're there personally or
[46:32] whatever you are don't forget
[46:35] if your gods you might have lost glory
[46:37] you might have lost remember the hair
[46:38] represents glory
[46:40] remember that's a woman's glory you know
[46:43] when uh
[46:43] uh brother carol used to use this all
[46:45] the time and a little example preaching
[46:46] and evangelism
[46:48] him and i would preach meetings together
[46:49] in the field i always like to
[46:51] come to evangelize because i hear things
[46:53] from brother carol we never heard at
[46:54] home and
[46:55] he would always talk about that little
[46:56] woman that washed his feet you know he
[46:59] said she took her glory
[47:00] and laid it at his feet
[47:03] i like that
[47:07] and this is the truth the glory of any
[47:10] church is the power of god in it
[47:14] but if satan shapes us because we lose
[47:16] our conviction
[47:17] don't forget there's still a root that
[47:19] can grow
[47:21] you just got to start praying god one
[47:22] more time
[47:24] deal with me as you used to deal with me
[47:27] opening my heart as i used to open it up
[47:29] i'm becoming sensitive like i used to
[47:32] that's an everyday thing if you're doing
[47:35] things that ain't exactly right before
[47:36] the lord and you're struggling with the
[47:38] setting of sin
[47:39] from moment to moment never lose that
[47:42] attitude or you'll lose the battle
[47:44] god help me keep me right
[47:51] god bless you now you understand me i'm
[47:54] not saying that you don't love one
[47:55] another
[47:56] you get that right i'm not saying you
[47:59] don't have powers and gifts
[48:01] i'm saying if we become a church like
[48:03] brother branham was describing here
[48:06] then we have to ask the self the
[48:07] question why
[48:09] take it in a different way i'm closing
[48:11] i'm quitting
[48:12] families if families aren't as close
[48:15] together as they used to be
[48:17] why one got this against it and that one
[48:20] against it this one got angry about that
[48:22] one this was
[48:24] before you know there's a gigantic rift
[48:25] between the groups
[48:27] they don't want to talk to each other
[48:28] anymore sure
[48:30] we have to ask ourself what happened
[48:35] brother brahman said a man and a woman
[48:37] have to love each other
[48:38] if they're ever going to make the grade
[48:42] you take that love out of that home
[48:45] and it'll fall apart the glory will
[48:47] depart from it
[48:49] because you realize that's why ichabod
[48:51] has rode over many churches
[48:53] because the glory of the lord has
[48:56] departed
[48:59] god help us can we buy our heads
[49:02] together
[49:07] while your heads are about this evening
[49:10] not trying to prolong the service but
[49:14] talking this way gets people thinking
[49:18] and that's good for some of you
[49:21] sitting here tonight maybe you would say
[49:24] within yourself brother ben
[49:27] i i get it i get the message
[49:32] i don't have the same conviction in my
[49:34] heart like i used to
[49:37] i don't take the bible that seriously or
[49:38] the message i seriously don't take
[49:40] churches seriously
[49:42] i don't take prayer as seriously i've
[49:45] just kind of become
[49:46] common with it but i'm asking the lord
[49:50] to
[49:50] come in tonight give me a baptism of
[49:54] real conviction
[49:57] remember if you mourn you will be
[49:59] comforted
[50:01] you will be confident would you like to
[50:04] raise your hand up to the lord just as a
[50:06] sign to him
[50:07] not to me so much but just god
[50:12] restore unto me that real conviction
[50:14] power
[50:16] hallelujah friends i'm putting my hand
[50:18] up right here with you
[50:20] because i feel there's areas of my life
[50:22] where i'm not as
[50:24] sensitive as i need to be
[50:27] i know i'm not
[50:31] i'd say just about every single hand
[50:34] in this building is a
[50:38] now is that a failure in this service
[50:40] because we're not screaming
[50:42] did we fail to move in the holy ghost no
[50:47] because what i'm looking at witnessing
[50:48] right now is a move of the holy ghost
[50:52] don't let the devil tell you because
[50:53] you're not shouting and running and
[50:54] dancing either the god ain't moving
[50:57] if you feel that convicting power inside
[51:00] your heart moving right now
[51:02] that's the baptism of holy spirit moving
[51:04] on you
[51:08] i won't pray with you right now
[51:11] heavenly father
[51:15] as we come before the sacred presence of
[51:17] jesus christ
[51:20] lord every hand in this building just
[51:24] about including mine was on
[51:28] and it's that way lord because we all
[51:30] sense the very same thing in this place
[51:33] that deep realm of conviction
[51:37] that deep feeling that goes right down
[51:41] into the soul lord
[51:43] it's that something god that keeps us
[51:45] going and keeps us moving and
[51:48] keeps us right with you and lord jesus
[51:51] as your people are setting here in the
[51:53] divine
[51:53] presence of the lord jesus christ
[51:57] not another god but thou alone
[52:02] i pray that your great holy spirit
[52:05] will mend and heal any place inside of
[52:09] them
[52:10] that they've damaged or left the secret
[52:12] of their hairs been shaved or
[52:15] whatever part of them that's been let
[52:17] out that maybe a philistine's got a hold
[52:19] of it or
[52:20] it's been shaved out lord god may it
[52:22] begin to grow back even now
[52:26] because in the little type where they
[52:28] asked brother branham what long hair was
[52:30] he said long hair was uncut hair
[52:34] so lord even though i may have but a
[52:36] little bit of stubble growing
[52:38] in your eyes that's a nazarite to the
[52:40] lord
[52:42] so any move i make even tonight sitting
[52:44] in these pews
[52:47] that's a move of power and conviction
[52:50] and it's beneficial it don't have to be
[52:53] long hair to the floor to be long
[52:57] it just has to be hair that is
[52:59] surrendered to you
[53:01] so lord if the little samsons sitting
[53:03] here have been shaved bald some of them
[53:06] lord if they're just beginning to put
[53:07] forth a little stubble tonight
[53:10] let them receive the same power
[53:14] same conviction same authority as
[53:17] though it would be hair following to the
[53:20] floor as it were
[53:22] convicted so god placed within us the
[53:25] blessing
[53:26] of conviction power help us the lord god
[53:30] never to lose that sensitivity
[53:33] father is a as a visitor slash
[53:39] lord i'm not even so much a visitor as
[53:40] much as i am almost home folk with these
[53:42] people here
[53:44] oh that's one reason why i try to preach
[53:46] so personal and
[53:48] try not to just say surface things and
[53:51] good one-liners i don't want to just
[53:53] work their emotions up lord
[53:57] why waste our time on these wednesday
[53:59] nights coming in in a rush and tired and
[54:01] wore out and worked all day and
[54:03] our mind on thousand things and then
[54:05] walk out the door just
[54:06] regular old service as it were no
[54:10] god let tonight be a complete
[54:13] restoration
[54:15] hallelujah a restoration and a revival
[54:21] of conviction in our heart
[54:24] granted lord in jesus name
[54:28] amen
[54:31] hallelujah
[54:36] hallelujah hallelujah
[54:41] if you want it with all of your heart
[54:42] just raise your hands up like this say
[54:44] lord

[54:50] you tell him you tell him in your own
[54:52] way you tell him
[54:54] say lord i receive it tonight i receive
[54:57] it
[54:57] in jesus name hallelujah
[55:02] hallelujah hallelujah
[55:07] draw me nearer
