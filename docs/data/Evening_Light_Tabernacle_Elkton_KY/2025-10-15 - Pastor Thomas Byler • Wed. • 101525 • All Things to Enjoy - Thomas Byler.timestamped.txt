[1:22] Let's stand and sing that tonight.
[1:25] Oh, kings
[1:27] and kingdoms
[1:30] will all
[1:33] pass away.
[1:35] Oh, there's something
[1:37] [Music]
[1:39] about
[1:41] that name. Let's sing it again if we
[1:43] could tonight.
[1:46] Oh, Jesus.

[2:00] about
[2:02] that name.
[2:07] Oh, and master,
[2:11] savior.

[3:06] that neck. Could we sing it one more
[3:09] time tonight?
[3:11] Oh Jesus,
[3:15] Jesus.
[3:18] Jesus.
[3:22] There's just something
[3:26] about
[3:28] that name.
[3:33] Oh, master,
[3:36] savior
[3:39] Jesus.
[3:43] Like the fragrance
[3:45] [Music]
[3:47] after
[3:49] the rain.
[3:54] Oh Jesus,
[3:57] Jesus,
[4:00] Jesus.

[4:21] will all
[4:23] pass away.
[4:26] Oh, there's something
[4:29] about
[4:31] that name.
[4:35] Amen.
[4:37] And I love you, Lord.
[4:44] Oh, and I lift my voice. Yes, Lord,
[4:52] to worship
[4:57] you,
[4:59] oh my soul.
[5:03] Rejoice.
[5:06] Oh, take joy
[5:09] my king.
[5:13] Oh, and I lift my voice
[5:21] to worship
[5:25] you,
[5:27] oh my soul.
