[0:00] kind of beat us down and push us down
[0:02] and hold us down and God just wants us
[0:06] to be encouraged in the word so about my
[0:09] thought this morning would be uh the
[0:12] thought would be we must overcome and
[0:14] conquer
[0:15] we must overcome and Conquer and I was
[0:18] found this was I was studying and
[0:21] it was talking about in ancient Rome you
[0:24] know they have you had tens of thousands
[0:27] of people would Gather in the coliseums
[0:30] and they would Gather in these coliseums
[0:32] to watch the Christians
[0:34] they gathered in the coliseums to watch
[0:36] the Christians be torn apart to be
[0:39] ripped to shreds amongst lions and bears
[0:42] and tigers and Gladiators and tens of
[0:44] thousands of people would gather to
[0:46] watch this this spectacle and Paul Rader
[0:49] you've heard the prophet talk about Paul
[0:51] Raider he wrote the song only believe
[0:53] and he was a friend with the prophet and
[0:56] Prophet knew him and and brother Brown
[0:58] said he said under his ministry some as
[1:00] he was a as it was he was younger I
[1:02] think but he knew him he was an
[1:03] acquaintance but Paul Rader was there
[1:05] and he was commenting on his visit to
[1:07] the Coliseum
[1:09] and listen to what he said he said I
[1:11] stood
[1:12] uncovered to the heavens above
[1:16] where he sits for whom they glad
[1:22] and I asked myself would I
[1:25] could I die for him tonight to get this
[1:28] gospel to the ends of the Earth
[1:33] he said I prayed fervently
[1:36] in that Roman arena for the spirit of a
[1:40] martyr
[1:41] and for the working of the holy spirit
[1:43] in my heart as it worked in Paul's heart
[1:46] when they brought him in on his
[1:48] handcuffed away to Rome
[1:50] he said those early Christians lived on
[1:52] a threshold of Heaven
[1:55] he said within a heartbeat of home
[2:01] no possessions
[2:03] to hold them back
[2:05] wow can you imagine being in that
[2:08] atmosphere I've never been to the
[2:10] Coliseum if any of you have if you have
[2:12] I'm sure it was an amazing feeling I've
[2:13] been to uh the uh where the Oklahoma
[2:17] City bombing took place actually me and
[2:19] brother Byler went there and visited
[2:21] together we went on a trip out west one
[2:23] time and the feeling is so
[2:26] it's just a burden it's heavy
[2:29] and that was at the Oklahoma City
[2:30] bombing and and completely different
[2:32] situation but I can't imagine being in
[2:34] that Roman Coliseum and standing there
[2:37] and thinking the very thoughts that he
[2:39] thought
[2:40] so when we talk about Christianity when
[2:42] we talk about Christ when we talk about
[2:43] the word of God it's not a game
[2:47] it's serious business
[2:49] these people
[2:50] there's been thousands upon thousands
[2:53] have died
[2:54] for the sake of Christianity
[2:56] for the sake of Jesus Christ
[3:00] for the call of the gospel for the word
[3:03] of God
[3:04] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[3:07] have died
[3:09] and I think about that I think man
[3:12] what are we fighting
[3:14] why can't we overcome why can't we
[3:16] conquer
[3:17] it's not a game I was privileged to
[3:20] speak at the school at Carson school
[3:22] last week and
[3:24] spoke to about probably 250 kids 300
[3:27] kids I don't know
[3:28] and I began to lean back and I went back
[3:31] on kind of what brother Bauer was
[3:32] preaching on the Sunday before
[3:34] talking about Joshua and the possessing
[3:36] the gates of the enemy and and I took it
[3:38] on down that road I said this I don't
[3:40] come here to entertain you
[3:43] because Carson and Weston had told me
[3:45] many times people come to speak to the
[3:46] kids they they try to make a light they
[3:48] try to make games they try to get make
[3:50] friends with the kids
[3:52] it's I'm not there to make friends
[3:56] I'm here to preach the word
[3:58] and it was amazing the attention that
[4:01] the kids gave me and afterwards one of
[4:03] the young men come up to me and he said
[4:04] I just want to say thank you for saying
[4:06] you was not here to entertain us
[4:09] so kids want Christ people won't cry
[4:13] people want the word
[4:16] and it's up to the preachers it's up to
[4:18] us to live possible to preach the gospel
[4:20] to take the word into the god into the
[4:22] world so that it goes to the ends of the
[4:24] world and we leave this place
[4:28] so turn with me as we as we read
[4:31] Saint John chapter 14.
[4:36] the words of Our Lord speaking here
[4:38] these are the words in red right
[4:43] let not your heart be troubled
[4:45] you believe in God believe also in Me In
[4:47] My Father's House
[4:49] through many mansions
[4:52] if it were not so I would have told you
[4:54] I go to prepare come again amen
[4:57] and receive unto you myself that where I
[5:01] am there ye may be also and with
[5:05] whether I go ye know and the way you
[5:08] know and Thomas said unto him Lord we
[5:11] know not whether thou goest and how can
[5:13] we know the way
[5:15] and Jesus then replies back what I think
[5:17] is the greatest directions and guidance
[5:20] that has ever been given in the history
[5:22] of time he says I am the way
[5:25] I am the truth and I am the life and no
[5:29] man cometh unto the father but by me if
[5:32] if he had known me you should have known
[5:35] my father also and from henceforth ye
[5:38] know him and have seen him and Philip
[5:41] said unto him Lord show us the father
[5:43] and it sufficeth us
[5:46] now can you imagine here this next verse
[5:48] Jesus has to be getting a little
[5:49] frustrated
[5:50] he's getting a little bit concerned a
[5:52] little bit frustrated with where the
[5:54] worth of his disciples are standing in
[5:55] his presence and he says have I been
[5:57] with you so long a time with you that
[6:00] yet that yet has thou not known May
[6:03] Philip he that have sent me has seen the
[6:06] father and how saith thou then show us
[6:09] the father
[6:10] believe us that I am in the father and
[6:13] the father in me and the words I speak
[6:16] unto you I speak not of myself
[6:19] but of the father that dwelleth in me he
[6:22] doeth the works
[6:24] brothers and sisters we've got to get to
[6:26] that place that we we're living in that
[6:28] very sentence right there I speak not of
[6:30] myself but I speak of the father that
[6:32] dwelleth in me for he's the one doing
[6:34] the works
[6:36] it's not anything we do it's not you but
[6:39] it's him in you doing the works
[6:43] believe me that I am in the father and
[6:45] the father and me or else believe for
[6:47] the very work sake verily verily I say
[6:49] unto you he that believeth on me the
[6:51] works that I do shall he do also and
[6:55] Greater Works than these shall he do
[6:58] there it is think about this there it is
[7:00] there's what we are looking for Greater
[7:02] Works than these shall he do who's he
[7:06] talking to
[7:07] who's absolutely brojo he's talking to
[7:10] us he's talking to Believers you'll be
[7:12] the ones that do the Greater Works
[7:15] fruit
[7:18] because I go unto my father and
[7:20] whatsoever you shall ask him my name
[7:22] that will I do that the father may be
[7:25] glorified in the son if ye shall ask
[7:27] anything in my name I will do it
[7:31] may the Lord add his blessed
[7:33] sister to read the word you can be
[7:34] seated
[7:37] listen to what the prophet says he says
[7:39] today
[7:40] we're living
[7:42] how means alive today
[7:44] we're living He says we're living He
[7:46] says why do
[7:48] we worry
[7:53] why do we worry why do you wonder why do
[7:58] you wait
[7:59] speak and go forward he said your will
[8:02] to heal today
[8:04] how many times have we said that how
[8:06] many times as we as Believers looked at
[8:08] that and said oh Lord if it be their
[8:10] your will heal me today he says no no
[8:13] sure it's your will he said
[8:16] thus saith the Lord it's his will
[8:20] and he don't save us saith the Lord as
[8:22] the word the
[8:24] Lord is speaking
[8:26] he said it is his will
[8:29] you say can I receive the Holy Ghost
[8:31] today is the days of Miracles past
[8:37] certainly the days of Miracles is here
[8:42] and you know what he said in the next
[8:43] sentence whether the next word was
[8:45] forever
[8:46] [Applause]
[8:48] the days of Miracles wasn't just for the
[8:51] past
[8:51] perhaps the days of Miracles wasn't for
[8:54] the 1960s it wasn't for the 19 early
[8:57] 1900s on Azusa Street it was for today
[9:00] it's here forever but
[9:03] tongues today he said the Bible says so
[9:06] he says that these signs shall follow
[9:08] them the belief does it mean uh does it
[9:11] mean that men can interpret the message
[9:14] he the message talking about the
[9:16] interpret
[9:17] patience
[9:19] he says the Bible says To Us by this day
[9:22] and the words that he spoke there are
[9:24] the words for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[9:26] to get her ready to take a rapture
[9:30] these words are important he says we're
[9:32] living thus saith the Lord it's his will
[9:36] forever the days of miracle
[9:40] forever
[9:41] the Bible said so it settles it
[9:44] we could go home right now and know
[9:46] we've heard a great service we can go
[9:49] home right now and know that the Lord
[9:50] has spoken to us he said thus saith the
[9:53] Lord speak don't cry speak and go
[9:56] forward
[9:58] God don't want a bunch of cry babies
[10:04] that's the next sentence God don't want
[10:08] a bunch of crying babies he wants men
[10:10] with backbone he wants men women and
[10:13] children with backbone he wants you not
[10:15] to have wishbones
[10:17] he said wishbones and we don't need
[10:19] wishbones I wish I had this I wish I
[10:21] could do this how many of us sitting
[10:23] here this morning could honestly say
[10:25] that you I wish her before
[10:28] sure you have oh I
[10:31] I wish
[10:32] wish I could get to feeling better
[10:36] I wish I could get to feeling better I
[10:39] wish I could overcome this issue I wish
[10:42] I could overcome this problem I wish I
[10:44] could overcome this sin in my life I
[10:47] will
[10:47] wish I wish I wish I wish my finances
[10:50] were better
[10:52] that'll be a whole lot more Amen in
[10:54] right now
[10:55] I wish I wish I was a better better
[10:58] husband I wish I was a better father I
[11:00] wish I had a better marriage I wish I
[11:02] had I wish I wish I wish he says we
[11:05] don't need people that want to wish he
[11:07] said we need backbones men and women
[11:11] that'll stand in the breach what is that
[11:13] breach a breach is a gap
[11:16] and so he's looking for men God is
[11:18] looking for men and women that will
[11:20] stand in the gap between the obstacles
[11:22] of this world and the mediator Jesus
[11:25] Christ and stand there and say I'm just
[11:27] waiting to to overcome this obstacle
[11:30] standing in the breach he said we need
[11:32] people that will claim the victory that
[11:35] will claim and be called out in the
[11:37] midst of Darkness that no matter what
[11:39] anybody else says they're going to speak
[11:41] and go forward
[11:44] okay
[11:49] he says we need people
[11:52] we need people
[11:56] that believe the message
[11:59] [Applause]
[12:01] I said we need people that will believe
[12:03] the message
[12:05] I'm afraid there's a lot of people
[12:06] around the message that
[12:09] thank you
[12:14] we need people that believe the message
[12:16] we need people that know that God is
[12:18] here we need people that know that God
[12:20] is going to vindicate his message that
[12:22] God is here and that if the same God
[12:24] that was back there and Yonder on
[12:26] Galilee he said it's the same God that
[12:29] was there in the days of Moses and he
[12:31] can't fail
[12:33] why are we afraid if we ask of God or if
[12:37] we do something in the name of the Lord
[12:39] why are we afraid that we're going to
[12:41] fail are you are you deaf
[12:44] afraid of what God can accomplish
[12:46] are we that afraid that we look back and
[12:48] say oh I'm not going to wish
[12:52] for this I'm going to pray for it
[12:55] I hope it comes true
[12:58] I hope God don't let me down I hope God
[13:01] don't fail us here no we can't have that
[13:05] kind of attitude we have to believe it
[13:07] and we have to know that the Holy Spirit
[13:08] holy that's scriptural I'm not I'm
[13:12] preaching a problem
[13:14] 30 message this morning I'm just telling
[13:17] you what your god-given rights are
[13:20] this is the message this is the word
[13:22] this is scriptural let me talk about
[13:25] Moses for just a few minutes because you
[13:27] know one time there was a guy
[13:29] by the name of Moses
[13:31] back there on the back side of the
[13:33] desert
[13:35] and he's back down there on the back
[13:36] side of the day
[13:38] desert and

[13:56] comes walking along and he's hobbling
[13:58] along there and talking to the wife and
[14:01] trying to go about the day's business
[14:02] and then all of a sudden the Lord shows
[14:05] up in a burning bush
[14:10] and we wonder if God will fail us
[14:12] God shows up in a burning bush and
[14:14] begins to speak and he says now look
[14:16] Moses

[15:21] most trained soldiers that there are in
[15:23] the world how am I going to go down
[15:25] there he says Moses one you got in your
[15:27] hand
[15:30] a stick
[15:35] and we worry about God failing us
[15:38] what do you got in your hand Moses Moses
[15:40] said a stick
[15:42] just a stick Lord
[15:45] and he said he showed it to the Lord
[15:46] said here's a stick and he said yes in
[15:49] the hands of Moses it was when God takes
[15:52] a hold of your life things change it's
[15:55] no longer just a stick it's the holy
[15:57] ghost moving in your life and beating
[15:59] your obstacles down
[16:01] it's just a stick No Moses I'll go he
[16:05] says I'll go and the next morning he
[16:08] said the little old man
[16:09] 80 years old little old man going down
[16:12] there got him a little donkey and
[16:14] Whiskers hanging out here his wife's on
[16:16] the back of the donkey with a youngin on
[16:18] each hip going down to take over Egypt
[16:23] and he said the people in the town in
[16:25] the city said hey Moses
[16:27] where are you going
[16:30] it looks like you're traveling and Moses
[16:33] said glory to God I'm going to Egypt to
[16:35] take it over
[16:37] you're gonna do what are you crazy
[16:40] that's ridiculous
[16:42] and he said yeah he said they got a
[16:44] million trained men but God says it
[16:47] don't make any difference
[16:50] a million trained men and God says it
[16:54] don't make any difference
[16:57] how are you gonna fight them guys Moses
[16:59] he said well the Lord told me to take
[17:01] this stick
[17:04] the Lord told me to take this stick to
[17:06] go down there and take over so that's
[17:08] exactly what I'm going to do
[17:10] he says why it seemed ridiculous but he
[17:13] did it Hallelujah he said he did it he
[17:16] said God takes ridiculousness
[17:20] to prove
[17:23] his powers
[17:27] he says God takes things that which is
[17:30] not and brings us to which is not is is
[17:34] he said say how is he going to do this
[17:37] how is he going to do this
[17:39] how is God going to go down there and
[17:41] use Moses with a stick in his hand and
[17:44] take over a million men and overthrow an
[17:47] entire Army a fleet of Chariots and
[17:50] Spears and swords and shields and arrows
[17:53] oh he did it
[17:54] foreign
[18:03] he said Moses said it ain't none of your
[18:05] business to question this
[18:07] but it's our business to obey it
[18:11] so anytime God tells us to do something
[18:14] through the word and God is speaking to
[18:16] us it's not for you to question well
[18:18] Lord I don't think this is going to work
[18:19] out the way you think it is Lord I don't
[18:22] think my kids are going to come the way
[18:23] you you you're probably right it's none
[18:26] of your business
[18:27] it's your business to obey God and do
[18:29] what God tells you to do go take over
[18:32] the army take over Egypt take over the
[18:34] Throne of pharaoh
[18:38] don't let Pharaoh push you around
[18:39] anymore
[18:46] Jesus says
[18:48] if I don't do the works of my father
[18:50] then Believe Me Not
[18:52] but if I do the works of my father then
[18:54] you believe me
[18:59] on me the works I do shall he do also
[19:01] Father
[19:03] and the prophet said now King James has
[19:05] the word greater there he said but if
[19:08] you take the original it doesn't say
[19:09] greater he says how can anything be
[19:12] greater than what
[19:14] it's already been done
[19:17] there's nothing greater than a miracle
[19:20] there's nothing greater than raising the
[19:21] dead there's nothing greater than people
[19:23] converted to Christ there's nothing
[19:25] greater than salvation there's nothing
[19:27] greater than blind eyes open death ears
[19:29] lame walking there's nothing greater
[19:31] than that
[19:32] he said but he said right there he
[19:35] stopped nature he healed the sick he
[19:36] raises that he cleansed the leopard he's
[19:38] done everything
[19:39] but
[19:41] more of it you'll do
[19:46] who's he speaking to
[19:49] right here we have to put ourselves in
[19:52] the scripture put ourself in the word
[19:53] and when God said the Greater Works is
[19:56] you will do it he's talking to you and I
[19:58] in our day in our age
[20:00] it'll be more it should be it should be
[20:03] let me say it that way it should be more
[20:05] people healed today than ever was in
[20:07] Jesus ministry it should be more people
[20:10] healed today more people converted to
[20:13] the gospel than ever was in the day of
[20:15] Pentecost the zuza street meetings in
[20:18] the 60s or 70s it ought to be more
[20:20] people why because greater is the worst
[20:22] that you'll do
[20:24] more greater means more
[20:30] he said just one word Lord
[20:33] just one word from you and and it'll
[20:35] mean more than all the preachers in the
[20:37] world could speak just one word
[20:41] go forward
[20:42] you see many times brothers or sisters I
[20:44] think we take our troubles
[20:46] and we let our troubles overtake our
[20:48] hearts
[20:50] we let our troubles overtake our hearts
[20:52] we magnify our troubles and we we give
[20:55] our troubles great esteem we esteem our
[20:58] troubles so great that the healing
[21:01] powers of Jesus in our lives become kind
[21:03] of non-existent
[21:05] we magnify
[21:07] problems we magnify ailments we magnify
[21:11] our shortcomings
[21:13] and then what happens
[21:15] when we magnify those things the
[21:17] negatives
[21:19] our passion disappears
[21:22] our deal for the Lord disappears
[21:25] uh our strength that God has given us it
[21:28] disappears
[21:31] you see how important it is we don't
[21:32] lift those things up
[21:36] in other words
[21:38] what happens when we begin to talk and
[21:40] brag and
[21:42] and lift up the ailments and the
[21:43] problems we we lose our stick
[21:46] we dropped our stick
[21:48] we no longer have the stick to go down
[21:51] and take Pharaoh's Army because we've
[21:52] laid it aside and said they're too big
[21:54] they're too great they're too large
[21:56] they're too overwhelming for me to go
[21:58] over God
[22:04] but you know that's not God's desire in
[22:06] our lives
[22:08] God does not desire he does not want us
[22:10] to be defeated God does not raise
[22:13] children to be defeated to be beat down
[22:15] no he says you're more than able
[22:19] that's the words he speaks to his
[22:21] children you are more than able you're
[22:23] more than a conqueror you can overcome
[22:26] because I have already overcome the
[22:29] world these are the words that the Lord
[22:31] threw out there to us
[22:33] so brothers and sisters I chop your
[22:34] stick and go forward keep your composure
[22:37] when problems arise keep your composure
[22:39] and keep the stick in hand
[22:43] I'm talking about just life situations
[22:47] I'm not
[22:49] I'm not talking about
[22:50] just going out here
[22:54] Old Town
[22:56] I'm talking about in your home
[22:59] I took mine in your job
[23:03] we had an issue the other day
[23:07] she says uh
[23:10] my Ring's falling off
[23:13] I got her a ring when Weston was born
[23:17] and uh
[23:19] got three little sets in it and
[23:22] it's kind of special to us you know
[23:24] women you like your rings they have
[23:26] special occasions you like those things
[23:27] she said my ring keeps falling off so
[23:29] I'm gonna go put on my wedding set she
[23:32] hadn't worn it in a long time
[23:34] she wears it up this finger it's kind of
[23:35] a dual purpose
[23:37] and so I said okay
[23:38] so she goes back to go get the ring
[23:43] hey Brad
[23:45] what
[23:48] my Ring's not in there
[23:52] anybody else
[23:56] and I'm thinking why
[24:00] in the world didn't she put that where
[24:04] all the other stuff is
[24:07] here we've moved over two years ago
[24:10] boxes of stuff still still have
[24:12] scattered who knows where did we take
[24:15] this box with our wedding ring to the
[24:18] Interfaith
[24:19] is somebody really happy this morning
[24:22] they got a reward at the Interfaith
[24:27] laughs
[24:30] and I'm
[24:31] sitting there and I'm thinking don't
[24:33] don't don't don't just
[24:36] just stay calm
[24:38] it's just misplaced
[24:40] and God knows where it's at
[24:43] we may have boxes everywhere
[24:46] and I said where is it at where do you
[24:48] think you put it well you know that
[24:49] little box that that used to be in here
[24:51] used to be there she said oh I stuck it
[24:53] in there I said why why didn't you put
[24:55] it in the jewelry box with the others
[24:57] I don't know I just always stuck it in
[25:00] that one
[25:01] okay so I just go back and sit down
[25:05] I just kind of said Lord you know where
[25:07] this is at I'm not even gonna get worked
[25:08] up about it it'll turn up if it's today
[25:10] tomorrow five years ten years from now
[25:12] it's here somewhere and you know where
[25:15] it's at
[25:17] and someone said
[25:18] there's a box in there
[25:22] in your closet it's got some coins in it
[25:26] and the box is in there
[25:28] I didn't say nothing to her she's going
[25:30] about her business I know she was a
[25:32] little bit discouraged because she knew
[25:33] I was
[25:35] having to take deep breaths
[25:39] and I go in there I lift open the lid on
[25:42] the box
[25:43] there's the Box she described I opened
[25:45] the lid on that box
[25:47] there it sat right in the middle
[25:51] God is aware of our battles God is aware
[25:55] of what we have need of it's keeping
[25:57] your composure and on in the situation
[26:00] through God
[26:02] I could have got mad I could have kicked
[26:05] I could have stomped and snorted and
[26:06] made her feel like a like a hill
[26:09] but I just said God you're in control
[26:13] so I just went in
[26:15] there and I washed it up and I polished
[26:17] it up and I took it there I said I'd do
[26:19] better next time
[26:20] where did you find that
[26:23] it was in the box
[26:24] you said and another box
[26:29] and another box
[26:33] Jesus tell
[26:34] his disciples
[26:37] let not your heart s be troubled
[26:41] in our scripture reading let not your
[26:43] hearts be troubled
[26:47] let me tell you these disciples had a
[26:50] reason to have troubled hearts
[26:54] they had a reason to have troubled
[26:55] hearts because Jesus just told him one
[26:57] of you sat in here is a traitor
[27:00] one of you sat in here is a Trader
[27:03] and every one of you is going to deny me
[27:08] foreign
[27:15] these men have followed Jesus for the
[27:17] last so many months their livelihoods
[27:19] their
[27:20] businesses jobs careers and they said
[27:24] Jesus we're going to follow you we're
[27:25] going to do everything you tell us to do
[27:26] we're your disciples we're your
[27:28] followers and now he's leaving
[27:31] and we're going to deny and one of us is
[27:33] going to kill him
[27:36] so they had reason to be troubled look
[27:40] someone says let not your hearts be
[27:42] troubled let not your hearts be troubled
[27:44] so he can tell them that how much more
[27:47] does Jesus want us living today to look
[27:49] at us in the eyes and say let not your
[27:51] hearts be troubled
[27:54] you don't have nothing to worry about
[27:55] let not your hearts be troubled Brothers
[27:58] and Sisters Jesus didn't tell me I was a
[28:00] traitor
[28:02] Jesus didn't tell me that I was going to
[28:04] deny him Jesus didn't tell me
[28:07] but I was going to be the one to kill
[28:09] him Jesus didn't tell me all this Jesus
[28:11] said I will never leave you
[28:14] he's talking to you and I I will never
[28:16] leave you I will never forsake you
[28:17] greater is he that is in me and it is in
[28:20] you that is in the world he said that's
[28:22] me I'm going to come I'm going to dwell
[28:24] in you so we have no reason for our
[28:26] hearts to be troubled
[28:27] Greater Works shall you do
[28:31] and Thomas looks at him and says
[28:34] Lord we don't know where you're going
[28:37] how will we find the way
[28:42] we don't know where you're going
[28:44] how in the world are we going to know
[28:46] where to go when you leave here are you
[28:48] going to the next town are you going to
[28:49] the next city are you going across the
[28:51] ocean where are you
[28:53] going Lord we don't know where you're
[28:55] going can you imagine Jesus as he talks
[28:58] to him with sympathy now
[29:01] and Jesus is talking with sympathy and
[29:03] their weakness and teaching them
[29:07] they're asking questions that a little
[29:09] child
[29:10] in our homes would be asking his father
[29:13] but
[29:14] the understanding
[29:16] of Jesus his ministry the life he lived
[29:21] than what his own disciples who walked
[29:23] with him day by day knew
[29:25] do you realize that
[29:27] and many times we look back and we want
[29:29] to reflect on their lives we want to
[29:30] look back at what they did what about
[29:32] you and I
[29:34] it's Greater Works in you and Jesus
[29:37] looks at him he says I am the way I'm
[29:39] the truth I am the life
[29:42] he says and he's going to begin to show
[29:44] him he's showing them away and he's
[29:46] teaching them
[29:48] and Jesus right there and he's looking
[29:51] at him and he said why are you
[29:52] questioning where I'm going
[29:58] you know if Jesus hadn't have done that
[30:00] if Jesus hadn't went that route if he
[30:02] hadn't said I'm the way the truth and
[30:03] the life
[30:04] do you know we would have been left
[30:05] powerless
[30:10] if he hadn't took that trip
[30:12] we would make no power we would have no
[30:14] Authority we would have no weapons
[30:16] against Satan whatsoever we would be
[30:18] living every single day of our life
[30:21] defeated
[30:23] defeated defeated
[30:26] you couldn't win it would be impossible
[30:28] but he says I am the way I am the truth
[30:31] I am the life
[30:33] so if you're sitting here somebody's
[30:35] sitting here and you're wandering about
[30:36] and I don't know
[30:37] wandering around and we didn't know
[30:39] which direction to go and we were a
[30:41] bunch of
[30:42] Renegades out there
[30:44] finally somebody's looked at us and we
[30:46] said hey he's the way
[30:49] I've got to convert I gotta turn my life
[30:51] I gotta change
[30:53] either way I'm living
[30:55] because he's the only way and so
[30:58] you're sitting there
[31:00] and you're confused and you don't know
[31:02] what to think he's the truth
[31:06] we we've all been in those situations
[31:08] where we think man what is up and down I
[31:10] don't know you hadn't because I know
[31:12] you're human
[31:13] and I know you've questioned things
[31:15] you've questioned things in this book
[31:17] and you've questioned things in message
[31:19] books
[31:21] yep don't lie to me
[31:23] because I know you have but he is the
[31:26] truth somewhere down the line we had to
[31:28] look and say hey there's nothing no
[31:30] better than this
[31:32] Jesus is the truth the word of God is
[31:35] the truth and so when you're sitting
[31:37] there and you're feeling Dead about
[31:38] yourself
[31:40] you know if you ever had that feeling
[31:41] and I think young people feel it more
[31:44] than older people and it shouldn't be
[31:46] that way but young people in their teens
[31:49] especially they go through times in
[31:50] their lives
[31:52] and they go through times when they when
[31:54] nobody likes them everybody picks on
[31:57] them they
[31:58] got pimples
[32:04] yep you was there
[32:09] and you feel like
[32:10] I'm so dead inside
[32:13] where are you gonna go I am the life
[32:17] look at this and Jesus is telling them
[32:18] I'm the way I'm the truth I'm the life
[32:20] and it becomes it becomes real
[32:23] that
[32:25] This Is The Life
[32:27] situation that he is willing to die
[32:30] for the disciples he's willing to die
[32:32] for those that are to come he's willing
[32:34] to die for you and I and the age we're
[32:36] living in and Proverbs 18 24 says one
[32:40] who is on
[32:41] unreliable friends soon comes to a ruin
[32:45] but he says there is a friend who sticks
[32:48] closer than friends
[32:50] closer
[32:53] than a brother Jesus Christ will never
[32:55] leave you he'll never forsake you he'll
[32:57] be right there when all things come when
[32:59] push comes to shove he's right there and
[33:01] there's nobody like him but Jesus and
[33:05] Jesus made this remarkable statement
[33:07] claiming that he was the only way to God
[33:13] I'm the only way to heaven
[33:16] and brothers and sisters we have to find
[33:18] a friend in Jesus just beginning if you
[33:20] if you just
[33:21] questioning your walk with the
[33:23] Lord if you've been walking for 40 60
[33:26] years it doesn't matter you have to have
[33:28] a friend in Jesus why why do we need
[33:31] that friend because he's more he's more
[33:34] than what a brother could ever be
[33:38] foreign
[33:41] you know I'll find out
[33:44] I find out when I think about this
[33:47] when nobody's around
[33:50] when I'm all by myself
[33:53] he's there
[33:55] have you ever thought about that I've
[33:57] been walking out and doing things and I
[33:59] look up I say Lord have mercy
[34:02] you've been with me all along
[34:06] there's a song I Like It says I'm
[34:09] walking in his Shadows
[34:10] and he's walking by my side
[34:16] he's there
[34:17] when I'm feeling alone
[34:19] I don't have to call the counselor
[34:22] when I'm depressed when I've got anxiety
[34:23] when there's fears in my life when I've
[34:25] got to make decisions I don't have to
[34:27] call the banker I don't have to call the
[34:29] counselor I don't have to call somebody
[34:30] and get advice
[34:33] he's right there
[34:35] that's who I go to when when I have
[34:37] problems I begin to talk to Jesus I
[34:39] don't have to look up somebody he's
[34:41] right there he's closer than a brother
[34:48] foreign
[34:49] and here is Jesus
[34:51] we
[34:53] keep him there Our Lives will be so much
[34:56] better
[34:58] you know when I was speaking to those
[35:00] kids at the school the other day at HCA
[35:02] I was going over the
[35:04] the Joshua and and possessions and the
[35:07] footsteps and to your goals and your
[35:09] Ambitions and your career and you're
[35:11] fixing to get married and you're going
[35:13] to be able to pick up pick a spouse
[35:17] and I said you know Paul says suppress
[35:19] on press on but the thing that I tried
[35:21] to instill in their mind is you're going
[35:24] to want all those things
[35:25] but the number one thing is to keep God
[35:28] first
[35:29] keep God as your number one priority I
[35:33] said if you go to picking out a guy
[35:35] make sure it's okay with God
[35:37] make sure he matches up to God's
[35:40] approval
[35:42] if you're getting ready to take on a new
[35:43] job make sure it's matching God's
[35:46] approval if you're getting ready to
[35:48] think about moving to a new job to ask
[35:49] is there a church to go to
[35:53] because if you're going to a place where
[35:55] there's no church and you think you're
[35:56] going to work and everything's going to
[35:57] be good you're badly mistaken because we
[36:00] are made to Fellowship
[36:04] we draw strengths and fellowship
[36:08] keeping God first and here's Jesus
[36:12] I want you to recognize this
[36:15] here he's sitting talking to them
[36:18] one on one
[36:22] he's telling them what's about to happen
[36:24] he's telling the disciples what's going
[36:26] on what's going to happen in their lives
[36:29] where he's going he's trying to explain
[36:32] himself
[36:35] he didn't pull them aside and say let's
[36:37] have
[36:40] he didn't pull him aside say hey before
[36:42] we talk about this before we get all
[36:44] spiritual
[36:45] we need to go to the temple where we're
[36:47] where we're surrounded by the temple of
[36:50] God he didn't do that
[36:53] that's why you don't you just have to
[36:55] talk
[36:56] to
[36:57] God and he was making it evident
[37:00] that I'm going to be
[37:02] right here through
[37:04] thick and thin I don't need all the
[37:06] rituals I don't need all the the the the
[37:09] the the the church buildings I don't
[37:11] need Grandeur but what I need I just
[37:13] need you to communicate with me talk
[37:15] with me one on one and I'm right here
[37:18] and that's what God wants from us and we
[37:21] have to do the very same same thing we
[37:23] have to set aside our own mind set aside
[37:26] our own wants our own desires our own
[37:28] things our own
[37:29] so that we can receive the fullness of
[37:31] the Holy Spirit to overcome our fears to
[37:34] overcome our doubts to overcome
[37:36] sicknesses in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:37] Christ
[37:41] he's the one true God the way
[37:45] the truth and the life
[37:47] we see that consistent theme All Through
[37:49] the Bible even think in the beginning of
[37:51] the Ten Commandments it says I'm the
[37:53] Lord your God
[37:54] who brought
[37:56] you
[37:57] the land of Egypt and out of the house
[37:59] of bondage and you shall have no other
[38:01] gods before me I am
[38:04] when they said who who should I tell
[38:06] them send me God you tell them I am sent
[38:09] you I am that I am that's who I am
[38:12] Jesus is talking to his disciples on the
[38:15] night of his departure
[38:17] and let me tell you they were afraid
[38:20] they were afraid
[38:22] they were full of fear and they were
[38:25] afraid because Jesus is leaving them
[38:27] that's the number one reason he's
[38:28] leaving and they begin to get afraid and
[38:30] maybe in their minds they're thinking oh
[38:32] my goodness we've been fired
[38:36] what will we do now
[38:41] what kind of works are we going to do
[38:43] we've traveled with him everywhere we've
[38:45] seen all these
[38:46] Miracles and wonders and now we're being
[38:49] fired because he's leaving he's pushing
[38:50] us to the side
[38:52] they didn't get fired
[38:54] God wasn't firing him God's not going to
[38:56] fire you he was giving a promotion
[38:59] he was promoting them to a place that
[39:01] they would be the ones to do the works
[39:03] that they would be the ones to be
[39:05] promoted into a place that they were the
[39:06] ones doing the praying they were the
[39:08] ones doing the the Divine works of God
[39:12] it was evident in their lives
[39:17] he says the works that I do
[39:20] you will do
[39:22] so Jesus is expecting them now to carry
[39:24] on the very works that he done
[39:28] no longer visible in Jesus's life
[39:33] but in their own life
[39:36] it has to be evident in our lives
[39:38] brother Jeff you're alive
[39:40] sister Alicia you're alive
[39:43] just retirement you're alive
[39:45] has to be evident in our lives and when
[39:48] we begin to look at this and we begin to
[39:50] see that the promise that seems
[39:52] impossible
[39:53] How can I
[39:55] ever do that
[39:56] is
[39:58] how can these Greater Works ever take
[39:59] place do you realize the first sermon
[40:01] that Peter preached more people was
[40:03] converted than all of Jesus's Ministry
[40:09] the very first day on the day of
[40:11] Pentecost more people was converted on
[40:13] that day than all of Jesus's Ministry
[40:16] combined
[40:17] there is a greater work say God wants us
[40:20] to have that Greater Works
[40:22] and he's telling us about these Greater
[40:24] Works and the Fulfillment of these
[40:27] works because I go to my Father and
[40:30] Jesus begins to explain this when he
[40:32] ascended
[40:33] what descended
[40:35] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit living
[40:38] in us turn with me you've taken notes
[40:41] turn with me into the Book of John
[40:43] right where we was at I'm going to give
[40:44] you five scriptures
[40:47] I wasn't going to do this but I just
[40:49] couldn't get away from it I'm gonna give
[40:50] you five scriptures that you can pin
[40:52] down when you're having a bad day
[40:54] you say these are my five scriptures
[40:56] when I'm having a bad day that tells me
[40:58] who I am
[41:01] John Chapter 14 verse 16. say Amen when
[41:05] you get there

[41:19] and he shall give you another comforter
[41:22] that he may in the Greek it's called

[41:30] paracletose it means the one called
[41:33] alongside to help
[41:39] I'm walking in his Shadows
[41:44] he's walking by my side
[41:47] he's the
[41:49] one that's called he's the app
[41:52] but the comforter which is the Holy

[43:17] of the world he had you on his mind
[43:24] whatever you ask in my name that will I
[43:27] do
[43:30] um
[43:34] whatever you ask
[43:35] in his name that will I do now it's
[43:38] going to have to have a little
[43:39] explaining here so bear with me we're
[43:41] getting close to winding up
[43:45] in my name
[43:47] is not a magic potion
[43:52] you could say Jesus name all you want
[43:59] you say Well it speaks of an endorsement
[44:01] like a like a bank check
[44:04] and it does the prophet says you got to
[44:06] check sign your name he said if you need
[44:08] healing sign it's already been signed
[44:10] Jesus Christ sign it accept it you need
[44:12] healing accept it you need Deliverance
[44:14] accept it you need salvation accept it
[44:17] but there are some limitations to that
[44:21] you say I've never heard that one
[44:25] well let me tell you you know my son
[44:27] Wesson's sitting here he's in four hours
[44:29] away living
[44:32] he don't have a lot of money he don't
[44:33] mind me tell you that he's broke
[44:38] so his mother and I
[44:41] can't send him all four hours away with
[44:43] nothing to buy food or Necessities with
[44:46] so we go and we get a debit card
[44:50] its own Brad and Joyce Powell's account
[44:55] it's my money it's his mother's money
[44:58] it's it's our savings our living
[45:02] when we work we put it in our account
[45:06] but he's got a card that says Weston
[45:08] Powell and it's tied to that account
[45:12] but you know what I did
[45:14] I trust him I love him with all my heart
[45:20] but I told the bank I said he needs a
[45:22] hundred dollar limit
[45:26] there's limitations
[45:28] he needs a hundred dollar limit so he
[45:30] knows he can't spend but a hundred
[45:32] dollars at a time
[45:41] his
[45:42] never abused it
[45:45] I'm using that as an illustrator Quest
[45:47] that must be in accordance with the
[45:49] character
[45:50] of the name on the account
[45:54] did you hear what I said
[45:57] he knows he better not go swipe that
[45:59] card on anything he that he could spend
[46:03] it on
[46:04] if his dad daddy wouldn't bite
[46:09] or if his mama wouldn't buy it
[46:18] we know what goes in and out of the camp
[46:22] B-Dubs
[46:25] everybody knows what that is right you
[46:27] got to be cool it's B-Dubs it's not
[46:28] Buffalo Wild Wings it's B-Dubs
[46:33] laughs
[46:35] B-Dubs McDonald's
[46:38] it's okay
[46:39] if he needs to eat he needs to eat if he
[46:41] needs clothes he needs clothes if he
[46:43] needs gas he needs gas
[46:45] but the limitations have to line up with
[46:47] my life and that's the way God is
[46:50] we can't just take out a check and say
[46:52] Lord this guy done me wrong in business
[46:55] I hope his business Burns to the ground
[46:57] in Jesus name
[47:01] and you may have thought that
[47:05] but I hope you didn't say that
[47:08] because there's a limitations there's
[47:10] parameters there you can't go out there
[47:13] and you can't be having things for your
[47:14] personal Ambitions Lord here's my check
[47:16] I want a million dollars because I need
[47:18] a boat and I need a
[47:20] I need a an apartment and I need a I
[47:23] need a motorcycle
[47:25] I need a four-wheeler in Jesus name
[47:29] JC
[47:31] it don't work that way
[47:33] anything in his name name it says that
[47:37] you have the same mind as
[47:39] him you're in one Accord you're together
[47:42] with him and you say Lord
[47:45] I'm not feeling good Lord my child is
[47:47] suffering my child is sick my child has
[47:49] fever and I ask in the name of Jesus
[47:52] Christ that he be delivered and he signs
[47:55] the check yes sir Jesus Christ is done
[47:59] deposit that in your account
[48:02] you say I want to overcome the sin of my
[48:04] life I'm tired of being bound down by
[48:07] Satan and the demons and the Demonic
[48:10] forces of depression and fear and
[48:12] anxiety
[48:13] I think
[48:14] sign the name that's what he's talking
[48:17] about Jesus answers the those requests
[48:23] I'm gonna have to skip some
[48:33] he says it here today
[48:35] the same yesterday today and forever
[48:41] we've heard that our lives
[48:46] where do we stand with that
[48:48] you know a couple messages ago brother
[48:50] Byler asked us
[48:53] he said are you the Royal Seed of
[48:55] Abraham
[48:58] did you remember him saying that
[49:03] but he did
[49:04] he was preaching he come about to this
[49:06] spot right here he said you're the Royal
[49:07] Seed of Abraham
[49:10] what is that Royal Seed of Abraham the
[49:13] Royal Seed of Abraham says that Jesus
[49:15] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[49:17] forever
[49:18] it's the Royal Seed of Abraham that said
[49:21] he's here and he's going to perform just
[49:23] like he did for the Seed of Abraham to
[49:25] the people that's been called out of
[49:27] Babylon it's for the people's been
[49:29] called I saw them for the people that's
[49:31] been called out of the world it's for
[49:33] those people that are separated and he
[49:35] promises to do exactly the same thing
[49:37] that he did to that Royal Seed of
[49:39] Abraham of Jesus Christ
[49:46] after 2000 years
[49:49] more than two thousand years he said he
[49:51] stands here in the midst of us
[49:53] the mighty conqueror
[49:56] stands here in the midst of us as the
[49:58] mighty conqueror he says the word of God
[50:00] who can discern the thoughts of the
[50:01] hearts and the intents what is it it's
[50:03] the Seed of Abraham shall possess the
[50:05] gates of his enemy that Royal seat the
[50:08] word of God
[50:12] I've got about two more patches on that
[50:13] but I'm gonna skip it and we're going to
[50:15] move on
[50:17] talk about Samson here for a minute I
[50:19] want to get to these two characters
[50:21] Samson is sitting here
[50:23] and the prophet said one day the
[50:25] Philistines come up all about him
[50:28] and he said Samson is out here and and
[50:30] he he knows one thing
[50:36] it's not Marksmanship
[50:39] it's not how to handle a sword
[50:41] it's not how to
[50:42] defend with a shield
[50:44] it's not how to shoot a bow
[50:47] Samson knows one thing I am the anointed
[50:49] of God with under a Nazarite battle
[50:54] he said he was never trained as a
[50:56] warrior Noble Warfare about him at all
[50:59] and he said here he is today and a
[51:01] thousand Philistines come around about
[51:03] him and he's looking up there and he's
[51:05] wondering what am I going to do
[51:07] and he says the spirit of God come upon
[51:10] him and reminded him you are a Nazarite
[51:12] he said grab something so he reaches
[51:15] down and picks up the Jawbone of an ass
[51:18] one man annihilates a thousand Warriors
[51:22] he begins to swing that Jawbone back and
[51:25] forth and back and forth and back and
[51:26] forth why could he do that because the
[51:28] spirit of God come upon him and that's
[51:30] what makes the difference
[51:32] Moses had a stick Samson had a Jawbone
[51:38] a thousand men and he said there was a
[51:41] little shamgar
[51:42] this is the greatest story I feel like
[51:44] one of the greatest in the Bible shamgar
[51:47] just a little old rundown farmer
[51:49] famished from the year before because
[51:51] the Philistines had come and taken
[51:53] everything
[51:55] from me
[52:00] how many of us have ever let the devil
[52:02] take
[52:03] a year from us
[52:05] what year
[52:07] I've done nothing but fail after fail
[52:09] after fail I've let the Philistines come
[52:11] and take my corn I let them take my
[52:13] grain I let them take my eggs I've let
[52:15] them take my meat my family's gonna
[52:17] starve to death because I'm not I'm not
[52:19] the head of my house
[52:22] yeah
[52:23] you fall into those roots
[52:25] and here's shamgar is he's sitting there
[52:27] and he's thinking I don't know what I'm
[52:29] gonna do
[52:31] if they come back but right now honey
[52:34] right now honey
[52:38] we've got food
[52:39] we've worked all Year my dear and the
[52:42] problem said his little wife's in there
[52:44] fresh skin and bones and the children's
[52:46] Skin and Bones and he said we've got
[52:48] food we've got grain we've got corn
[52:50] we've got everything we need to get us
[52:51] through the next year and they're
[52:53] excited we're going to make it
[53:04] and the prophet says shamgar looked out
[53:07] the window
[53:10] and he said he could
[53:12] see those Philistines coming
[53:16] and he said not today
[53:19] and what I'm gonna do what will I do how
[53:21] will I take them on I don't know how to
[53:22] fight and the prophet said if I had a
[53:25] sword if I had a shield I could take
[53:26] them on and a lot of times we think oh
[53:28] if I was a preacher if I was a deacon I
[53:31] could take on all these Devils let me
[53:33] tell you we fight the same way you do
[53:36] one word at a time get thee behind me
[53:39] Satan
[53:45] and here shamgar is they said he looked
[53:47] around what can I do and he said he
[53:50] picked up an ox go
[53:52] from God that we no longer have to let
[53:55] the Philistines Rob us of our grain
[54:04] he said I'm a
[54:05] I'm an Israelite
[54:09] we could say we're born again believers
[54:13] that same Covenant that applies to us as
[54:16] it did them
[54:18] brother Brown said a lot of times people
[54:19] say the odds are against me on Divine
[54:23] healing
[54:25] gods are against us on old-time
[54:27] salvation
[54:29] he says what difference does that make
[54:33] their circumstances
[54:36] spirit of God
[54:40] cut the world away
[54:43] he looked out there Sam guard his
[54:46] righteous Indonesian rose up back and
[54:49] forth he wasn't a warrior he wasn't a
[54:51] preacher
[54:52] here he wasn't this that the other just
[54:55] like you are today
[55:01] you know brother Byler preached the
[55:02] message I'm quizzing y'all a lot today
[55:04] aren't I
[55:06] he preached a message
[55:08] a couple Services ago and he talked
[55:11] about lying vanities
[55:15] you remember that
[55:18] lying back
[55:22] was hurting so bad and had been hurting
[55:25] for about two weeks that I couldn't
[55:26] hardly get out of the bed
[55:28] I take a step and just cringe
[55:32] and I said
[55:35] I told Joe I was here a while back I
[55:36] said I I'd go anywhere in the world if
[55:38] somebody could just help my bike
[55:41] I said I go to a massage therapist I'd
[55:43] go to a chiropractor I'd go to a sports
[55:46] therapist I go whoever whoever could
[55:48] help my back
[55:49] why did I not think of the one who could
[55:51] help my back
[55:54] brother Butler begins to preach and he
[55:56] says all these symptoms that we have are
[55:58] lying vanities
[56:00] and I thought you know what that's
[56:02] exactly what this back problem is it's a
[56:05] line vanity it's a symptom and something
[56:08] that I've got in my head and I think
[56:10] that I can't overcome this I heard I
[56:12] heard I heard and I can't overcome it
[56:15] lion vanities so I began to I thought
[56:18] Lord I'm not going to accept this
[56:19] anymore
[56:21] listen here Satan
[56:23] this you're lying to me my God Is A
[56:27] Healer I don't need you to put me on my
[56:30] back and you will put me on my back no
[56:32] more because I have a family to support
[56:34] I have work to do I have churches I need
[56:37] to go to I've got places to be places to
[56:39] go people to see word to spread
[56:43] and I just said this is no more
[56:45] and I woke up the next morning and said
[56:47] ah
[56:53] and this goes on for a few days
[56:56] now I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie to
[56:58] you and tell you it was a it's a miracle
[56:59] I'm not gonna lie to you and say it was
[57:01] instantaneous
[57:02] that I said Lord Heal Me and it was gone
[57:05] that's not the way it worked
[57:08] but I began to look at it I thought
[57:10] there's a root call somewhere
[57:12] to this problem Satan you're the root
[57:14] cause you're the one causing me all this
[57:17] torment and I began to do a few
[57:19] stretches a few exercises Lord Heal Me
[57:22] in Jesus name I need the Deliverance I
[57:24] need
[57:25] I need you to touch my body
[57:28] you're saying well he didn't come up to
[57:29] get prayer
[57:31] God didn't tell me to you
[57:34] he told sister Hannah that day she came
[57:36] up for prayer now she's well
[57:45] and I sat there and I thought am I
[57:46] supposed to go to the altar Lord
[57:49] but I began to talk to the Lord and
[57:51] little by little day by day
[57:55] I'm feeling pretty good
[57:58] praise the Lord God still answers our
[58:01] prayers he cares about those things and
[58:04] God cares and and he wants to he wants
[58:06] to be your friend he wants to be all
[58:07] those things and why how can he do that
[58:09] John 16 and closing John 16 33 says
[58:13] these things I have spoken unto you that
[58:15] ye might have peace
[58:19] peace
[58:21] that means the devil can't control us
[58:24] if you're not at peace the devil is
[58:26] doing something in your life
[58:28] if your life is is in a confused State
[58:32] of Mind
[58:33] Satan's controlling something he's
[58:35] turning some knobs and pushing some
[58:36] buttons somewhere
[58:38] but we don't have to have that it says
[58:40] you may have peace in the world you
[58:42] shall have tribulation
[58:44] yep yep it's not always going to be good
[58:46] he says but be
[58:48] of good cheer for I have overcome the
[58:54] world
[58:56] the Santa Fe
[59:00] sometimes we just have to put things in
[59:02] action
[59:03] we have to put things in action
[59:05] and I saw a little a little clip a
[59:08] little thing
[59:10] on the internet and it was a
[59:13] former Navy SEAL
[59:16] and I really don't know how you address
[59:18] that some of you that was in the
[59:20] military can tell me later I don't think
[59:22] your former I think you're always a Navy
[59:24] SEAL you're always a special forces
[59:26] you're always a ranger you're always a
[59:28] soldier
[59:29] I guess I should say an inactive
[59:31] Navy SEAL
[59:33] he was telling a story and he said
[59:36] he was telling a story he said listen I
[59:38] was a my job as a Navy SEAL I was a
[59:41] breacher not a preacher
[59:44] a breacher with a B
[59:46] and he said it was my job to go in
[59:48] before my team and my job was to go in
[59:51] before the rest of the people and I go
[59:53] in there and I would see what kind of
[59:55] laws what kind of obstacles whatever the
[59:57] Fortress was that was keeping us out
[59:58] that we couldn't go around we couldn't
[1:00:01] go over and we couldn't go under and my
[1:00:04] job was to reach it I'm going through it
[1:00:08] and he said I would look and I would see
[1:00:10] how to be how to build a bomb that would
[1:00:12] destroy this wall
[1:00:14] and he said so I would go back and I
[1:00:16] would build the bomb just exactly like
[1:00:17] it needed to be and he said I will take
[1:00:19] that bomb and he said I would take it
[1:00:21] and stick that C4 right up there that's
[1:00:24] right Dana C4 brother Brian
[1:00:26] C4 he said I would stick it right on
[1:00:27] that wall and he said I'd look around he
[1:00:30] said oh I can see behind me with green
[1:00:31] eyes
[1:00:33] his brothers were behind him waiting
[1:00:36] waiting in the dark
[1:00:38] and he said all I could see behind me
[1:00:39] was was green eyes
[1:00:41] and he said they were waiting to hear me
[1:00:43] say three words
[1:00:46] and on those three words all chaos was
[1:00:50] fixing to break loose
[1:00:52] and he said those three words he said I
[1:00:55] still say them every day of my life
[1:00:56] every morning they are execute execute
[1:00:59] execute
[1:01:04] hell you see
[1:01:06] we have obstacles in our lives
[1:01:08] we have walls that's been built up in
[1:01:10] our lives and it's up to you and I to
[1:01:13] execute execute execute
[1:01:16] on a day-to-day basis because if you
[1:01:19] don't execute what God what you should
[1:01:21] be doing for God if you don't execute
[1:01:23] your prayer life if you don't execute in
[1:01:25] your in your and your sincerity before
[1:01:27] God if you don't execute and praying
[1:01:29] before God and getting before God and in
[1:01:32] a sincere way
[1:01:34] there's going to be walls
[1:01:37] and if you don't execute that prayer
[1:01:39] life in that life before God
[1:01:41] those walls will be your marriage
[1:01:45] your marriage won't be what it should be
[1:01:46] you won't be the father you should be
[1:01:48] you won't be the mother you should be
[1:01:50] you won't be the student you should be
[1:01:52] you won't be the young person you should
[1:01:54] be
[1:01:57] so think about that next time when you
[1:01:59] get up in the morning and you think what
[1:02:01] am I going to do today how am I going to
[1:02:02] tackle this day next
[1:02:04] execute
[1:02:06] be more than Overcomer more than a
[1:02:09] conqueror when that wall is in front of
[1:02:10] you and you can't go around you can't go
[1:02:12] over it you can't go under execute and
[1:02:13] breach right through it
[1:02:15] you love the Lord this morning
[1:02:17] praise the Lord
[1:02:20] brother Brown says God will pour out
[1:02:23] more spirit and more power upon his
[1:02:25] church
[1:02:26] and upon his people everywhere
[1:02:28] that our faith may be lifted up above
[1:02:31] all the defects of life
[1:02:34] that we may be able to be more than
[1:02:36] Overcomers and conquerors through him
[1:02:38] that loved us and gave us his life
[1:02:43] amen
[1:02:44] let's turn if we could to I think it's 3
[1:02:46] 30.
[1:02:47] hadn't sang a song in a while but it
[1:02:49] come to me
[1:02:51] one of my favorites I hadn't sung in
[1:02:53] years
[1:02:54] we've been made more than conquerors
