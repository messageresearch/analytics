praise you this morning we realize this morning that you have to be number one the most important thing in our life when we look at the word this morning the preaching the s service that's where we look and that tell us exactly where we're at and Lord if we're not where we need to be we need to make some changes today tomorrow could be too late the more we realize this morning we need to see where we're going and that's what's going to tell the truth Lord this morning we come deep because Lord you know our heart you know our desires Lord you know what we have need of ourselves so Lord I pray that you be in every aspect of this service I didn't just come because it's another day we had to come I come because I had Aire in your house the place you give me to worship it's more important than business it do matter what we accomplish it's more important than our jobs it's more important than watching a basketball or football game this is the most important thing we'll do this morning that's to praise you and give you all the glory in Jesus name Lord we ask you help us this morning that you've been our pastor that he would preach for word for if it hurts it hurts the more we real life it don't hurt it probably ain't doing us no good this time this morning Lord I pray that you help us to this church just to quit playing around with the word just halfway sitting on the fence don't know which side to go and Lord we ask Lord Jesus we heard the prophet preaching this morning he said if it ain't a little noise in it that means it's probably dead Lord I asked that you help me Lord that's what I pray and I give you all the honor glory Praise Your Precious name amen amen awesome brother you know we such a blessed people to be be called out into the message of the hour you know I've been around been around with people and seeing things and and you know I was in did I say all things okay I went to prison and stuff and you know just seeing you know what people go through you know there's people that you know been raised in the ghetto you know that don't know nothing but you know hearing testimonies the guys that give their heart to the Lord you know like we need a preachers down here because we know all the you know like this guy was from my line he said you know all the preachers down there they would sell drugs to you know I mean things like that that you know people people don't even have a taste of what real godliness is like you know to see a real living written epistle of all men of Jesus Christ in us you know it's just it's just so awesome to be called out and to be a to hear this message that hour like we was on the way here you know listening to a message too and listening how he's talking about you know brother Brandon's message being stored up stored up mana for us you know like you know the back in you know Joseph's time you had to go to over there to get the man you know blanking out there but but when you think about where we're called out to hear this and about to have the revelation of the hour to you know take us back you know I've just been thinking a lot here lately on God's love you know seeing his love for us from the foundation of the world to get us to where we're at today and to be in fine tune with us to be to be living and walking talking through us and to manifest his word in our life it's such a great blessing for Jesus Christ to call us out we have something so much to be grateful for so much they thinking for this new year you know I believe that we can go higher in Christ you know and allow him to have preeminence in our life and live through us that he can manifest his word and you know just like I seen the thing the other day going back to Eden think about the Dominion that was lost in the garden God's trying to restore it to his people his sons and daughters to create a bride of Christ and as he's manifesting his word in us that's him living through us being bone of his bone flesh his flesh it's just it's just we stand in awe of the Lord of what he can do and all that he can open our eyes to all that he can help us see more of him because he is his word it's just it's just so inspiring to me man that we just just got so much to just thank for it just makes me want to shout and scream you know but I was just thinking when he asked me this I had this I've been reading the scripture here lately first John 4 it's just a little bit lengthy chapter here but you know I think we got time you know this is uh oh sorry I didn't dismiss that I ain't very good at all this but you know I just thinking about the Lord and and how much I love him and how much he loves us and how how if you just think of him manifesting in our life man when we stop and just look at that you know I was thinking I was last night I was writing down some stuff and I was thinking about think about Adam and Eve in the garden they had no need to be no need of Deliverance no need of nothing they had God's fortified word and I was when I was thinking on this like think that they had limited knowledge they didn't know they was even they didn't they God supplied their food he supplied their water he supplied their AG of protection he was their everything you know when you think of that and that's where we're coming back to God being our everything all first John 4 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are into the world and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh not of God and this is the that Spirit of antichrist where you have heard that it should come even now already is in the [Music] world they are of the world therefore they speak of the world and the world thank you Lord he said the truth the life and the way beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that love is born of God and know God in this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that he might live God us we are also to love one another [Music] that that we dwell in him and he in us because he had given us his Spirit shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and and he in God here is our love perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because he is so are we in this [Applause] world and we love him because he first loved us God bless you Happy New Year Amen brother [Music] brother th anywhere else I I I I'm going to change my with me to Second Corinthians theth chapter morning we started there I was thinking this morning also with what Brother Don said and what that four chapter of John this is this is the last in that first devotional I'll just read what really struck me God saying in this quote I'll just read it and say what came to my mind it comes out of Revelations 22nd chap 20th verse and this is what that scripture says he that testify these things say surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus so that's one of the last verses in the Bible and this is what brother Brown have say this is the December 31st the devotional if I wanted to know what time it is it was my watch that's pretty simple if I wanted to know what day of the week we was living in for the month of the year I would look at the calendar and he goes on saying if I want to know the approaching time of this great event I look at God's word it tells the time when it's at hand for the Bible said when these things begin to come to us lift up your your Redemption is dra the time right word scure that you all read in it will such a great to when he St the prev of the coming of the Lord when saw the that rested upon un and CH it hasn't changed at all and the blessings that rest upon the believer he stringed out even so come Lord Jesus and it goes back to what we were reading in this fourth chapter of John said I've lost my place he said even so come j so thr heart that after he had seen the events before it coming he scream so Jesus when the whole church had passed you he seen everything in the way Happ come Lord Jesus I'm not this keep saying this one thing here come Lord Jesus it must be a glorious thing that the com of the Lord dra even in John's day was such a glorious thing that he seen in Vision every time he thought about it he got happy his whole Spirit desired for that day and then he finishes here Jesus went his disciples had got to a place that they were looking at the caral or the natural PL of the Earth this is what I was thinking about now here we want to stop just a few minutes it doesn't have to always be caral that draw brother belever here it's not that burden your of sin but sometimes you can burden yourself with the good things of life that God you can spend so much time in the good things that you're not doing the things you need to be doing you go and say I lost my I'm sorry about that now we want to stop just for a few minutes it doesn't have to always be the car that draws us away sometimes it's just the natural things which draws Jesus disciples were pointing him to the Great temple where God and Glory appeared and the Hest the Hest and when they told him how goodly the stones were placed how great the masterminds of God are ordained these Stones were cut in many places and this you can go back to God's word you can go back to Solomon built the temple he built the blueprint he had when they rebuilt it again they always went to the blueprint and places in the world come together years direct there wasn't even a saw or sound of a hammer so Mass put together so brother the disciples were looking at that great Temple it was a good thing they buil it purpose was good but they were spending so much time looking at that not looking at what they needed to look that and how God had come over the Jans and showed for the glory and how they had a great hope in this great church and I was just thinking this morning we can spend days and weeks and years Desiring good things and yet missing the most important thing which is the presence of Jesus Christ in our hearts and you run after all they're good things I'm brother saying they're not bad things but if you find yourself dwelling in things too much that don't mean anything in the end then it's not doing you any good and he goes on and he finishes here and Jesus told them see not all these things yet it was a holy place it was a good place it was a place house the dwelling of the Lord but Jesus said don't see these things I've got something to tell you that's far greater than this and it goes back to what we were reading in John and goes back to the scriptures that starts this whole this whole quote here I've got something to tell you far greater than this for there's coming a time he said that there will not be one stone left upon the other and we have that promise this morning not this scripture but the scriptures in Revelation excuse me that the whole world is going to go into chaos one day and the only place of safety is in Jesus Christ this morning and he finishes here no matter how well how well we try to take care of our physical being and no matter how hard we work together for our organization and how hard we work in the church for our orders of the church there's coming a time when all those things will vanish and pass away and I was thinking what do we you know there's a lot of things the last year I probably spent my time in that weren't really as important as I thought they were and there are things I should have done that are more important than the things I did and I I'll just sit down after we read this chapter but I've always liked this chapter in uh 2 Corinthians the 5th and one of the scriptures that was on the board this morning is at the end of this and I'll just read a few of these verses I know I say that and I wind up reading the whole chapter youall have to forgive me and uh I can't put any pressures on my nasal cavities for a few more weeks but I'll read this for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved and we have and we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens that's our hope this morning you all have a house you have a Dwelling Place on the other side of this life this morning that you're going to and that's the hope that's in us this morning for this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven that's that inner man inside you Desiring to be in that house one day that's that Holy Spirit holy ghost that God gave you it desires that that presence that change and it goes on to say if it's so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we are excuse me for we are we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not for what we would be unclothed but clothed upon the mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the selfs same thing is God who ha given unto us the earnest of the spirit that's where we're at this morning therefore we are always confident in knowing that we we're at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight that's our whole thought this morning everything we do is by faith in Jesus Christ this morning you can't let the things you see going on in the world the things that might be going on in your family the things that might be going on in the church you can't let that all those pictures distract you from the most important purpose and then to be there on that day I lost my place I and he goes we we are confident say and willing rather to be absent from the body to be present with the Lord that's every Christian's hope there this morning this morning wherefore we labor that we whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to what has done whether it be good or bad and I was thinking from that quote this morning no as Christians sometimes you can spend spend your whole life running after things that I'm not repeating myself that are good things but in the end do they really matter the only thing that really matters is you're running after the one thing the sole purpose of this journey on this life this morning is to be ready to stand before the presence of Jesus Christ Brother David amen you love him this morning amen amen I I know why brother Thomas come out because my speaker back there it wasn't working I thought well that one there's kind of tricky you have to mess with it and then it'll decide it wants to work there we go we're loud and clear how many loves the

that's the most exciting thing that a parent can have is when a child gets a personal relationship with God and man they listen to tapes all day they tell you about the Lord and know they begin to test oh that's such a wonderful thing that's what we're called to do raise children nourishing under the Lord Jesus Christ amen then some of us sometime that we go into the Final Chapter what I call

if you like sleep in enjoy yourself relax you work all your life it's another phrase isn't it is somewhere during that time how many knows that when you get born again it's a whole new start for us somewhere in that time frame you you better get born again you better have a new birth experience New Birth some A New Beginning a new start W how glorious it is so that when you come to the last chapter of your life amen and you want to have another it ain't the end and man when you come down to the door of death and man when you take your final breath and you've been looking for the Lord like Bosworth man I'm just getting I'm just graduating I'm graduating from this world and I've got a new body waiting for me it don't end for the believer no aren't you glad for that then you start another chapter A New Beginning Amen on the other side praise the Lord you come out of time you're done with time done with those chapters now you're ready for the Eternal chapter what a glorious thing it is and we're going to rule and reign with him for a thousand years how many's looking for it how many knows as we've approached this new year it's important what you looking for what you're looking at where are our eyes focused but would talk about he would preach on look and looking unto Jesus and he says you know it depends on what you're looking at he take a piano or organ whatever it was he was talking about he says what if I say look at that huh huh you're focus and your attention goes and what's he talking about amen amen you know and Jesus says look unto me look here look this way look this way all the ends of the Earth and be saved how manyan know that when you look to him amen even the the serpent that was put up all you had to do you were bit by the serpent is to look at that brass serpent on the pole just look oh my if you can believe Jesus said who that he that believeth on me shall not perish when you look at John 3:16 Amen in the right way you will live forever it's important we'll get into that perhaps a little bit later talking about looking I'm going to talk about looking at the world inside of the world and also amen looking at God Amen I many know there's always two sides praise the Lord Brother Brams says we are standing tonight upon the brim and watching come to pass and unfold two great scenes and those two great scenes are these one of them is the ending of History the other one is the ending of time amen oh many great men down Through the Ages is long to see the hour that we're now approaching amen I know I'm kind of getting ahead here but talking about the hour this new year that's coming up that right the day that you're living in the hour that you're living in amen praise the Lord he says we find out today that there's not too much history being written because I don't think it'll ever be used amen all the his gu what's going to happen with the history books they're gonna burn ain't they brother y they're all gonna burn ain't gonna be anybody here to read them how many people we're at the end we're at the end that's right praise the Lord by amen praise the Lord all [Applause] right the better bam says now the hour is here if I could have been back there before the days that the world was created and looked down and seen the whole thing and the father had said to me what day would you want to live I would say right now woo thank the prophet of God wanted to live in this hour aren't you glad that God chose you to live in this hour he chose me to live in the hour the greatest of all hours amen praise be to God my that's right this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom amen oh the real Church of the Living God ought to be on fire burning with the light of the Gospel being Vindicated among them aren't you glad for that that's right being Vindicated among them Rise and Shine for the lights come to you the light of this day Isaiah was the light of his day Noah was the light of his day they had the word manifested Shalom Phoenix 1964 in January good morning means peace darkness is gathered what's it gathered for to show the light but rise and shine 60 Isaiah 61 says for the light has come to you that that's the reason I can say shalom the light has come to you God's peace to the elected woman to the elected lady those who got before the for the foundation of the world called out and ordained them to that the rest of them will never see it how many knows Jesus said you can discern the skies and the signs of the times you can't discern you know when it's R in the morning and when it's red at night and so forth red in the morning sailor's warning red at night sailor ju light amen G to be good weather G be G bad weather but people can't see the hour that we're living in how many know like we said Wednesday amen they didn't know who Jesus was even marrying them no doubt didn't think that it would come to that that he would have to die such a terrible death things went s went so bad for him huh until after Peter denied him three times he went out and wept bitterly you can imagine just a bitterness that Peter was in and the rest of the disciples that they were in but from that spring forth something isin't that right amen it was a new beginning all right let's go let's start on this thought here in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth praise the Lord now we know that God God said I am the beginning and the ending not is he only the beginning but he's also the end he's to start and he's to finish I want to try to May in a little bit we want to talk about God's Great Symphony brother bandham tried to in a natural way to express this word and how it's expressed and how it's manifested it's like a great Symphony that's played out amen it has a lot of Junction it has a lot of turns it's got stops it's got high places it's got Low Places and they're right that's the way the world's been it's had a lot of high places it's got a lot of Low Places and here at the beginning it was truly the beginning of a new time a new beginning God created the heavens and the Earth how long was that beginning I don't know how long was it before he ever created before he even started before even God started your mind and my mind can't comprehend how much eons of time because it wasn't really any time but how so it's a irrelevant statement but he was in eternity and to think that God always was let me blows that always was always will be and anything that has a beginning has an end brother Brandman later in his life he talked about being an attribute in order to be Eternal you have to be an attribute of God and he says that's why this Earth is going to make it through because it was an attribute of God just like you're an attribute of God I mean know you in order to have eternal life you have to be a part of God cuz that's the only thing that is eternal and is God and it has to be associated with him an attribute of his it begin created the heavens and the Earth why might not mean much to somebody that just hears in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth but it may means more to us when we realize that you was in those thoughts that's right he had you in his [Applause] [Music] mind I think it should make us all Brave when God thought of you being in this worst age that ever was but this is the worst age ever this the most sinful most dangerous age of all times this is the darkest of all ages amen we say that a lot we talk about how horrible the world is amen but we'll get into that later and wouldn't it be sad if that's all we could talk about if we didn't have another side to it if it truly was all darkness and you was a part of it I believe his comes to my mind he says you know ahead what lays ahead as we look into the future for the unbeliever it's the most horrible time but for us it's the most glorious time you can have a smile if you're a Christian you can have a smile cu the world don't have a smile the world isn't happy right it's the saddest time for them ever they don't have no peace there is no peace for the wicked there is no rest for the wicked amen they have no peace they have no rest but our Prophet come along he says to the ble lady he said Shalom to you peace to you I want to say this morning I believe that we have more peace than we've ever had people in this message that truly have the message in their heart you've got more peace than anybody does you can rest assured and know that God is real that God is alive that you want to hear oh my on and on and on a rest unlike anything you've ever a PE that passes understanding even Luther and Wesley didn't have the peace that you did cuz they didn't have the light that you did they didn't have the assurance that you did that you do how many believe that oh thank you Lord thank you Jesus so let's take a little journey down through time shall we praise the Lord take a little journey down through time amen it was the beginning it wasn't very long we don't know how long do we how long was it perhaps a question brother Woody we can ask when we get over there how long was Adam and Eve in that perfect State before the serpent actually beguiled her huh how long amen before A New Beginning happened and it was a terrible beginning wasn't it after the fall it was a sad sad beginning amen before that Adam could go outside of his house said look I want one of them Evergreens on the corner of my house I want this kind of a plant all the way through here you know and I want a little mulsh here or whatever and I want this thata I'm going fix it up to us the way we like it huh I don't know but the B when we get in the Millennium we'll build houses and inhabit them and another won't inhabit it how many knows if this is a type of the real is that right then perhaps we'll do all of that amen you want something with a round Stairway to your next and upper Place yeah you want a big glass window you know overlooking a great what is your heart's desire hello huh maybe you like the desert and you want to live in a place like Arizona or whatever it might be the desert is but B say has made it different for different folks that's right am maybe you like oh my up in Canada and way up in them mountains maybe you like West Virginia yeah maybe you like to be like them Appalachian people huh I don't know amen I always wanted a nice place with a great View and and overlooking a nice big Hollow or something and so forth kind of like what Brother Brad has you know back there it's really Overlook something beautiful but God gave me something a little bit different I sit on my back patio and I look at a big hole all the way down to the creek and I always I wish I was young enough to put me a big old cable down there grab a hold of that cable strap me and and fly down through there you know so I say Lord you know what I need I'm happy with this right here being able to look down there and enjoy the wonderful nature and so forth I mean know that's what it was perhaps like for Adam and Eve amen for a long time until that slithering serpent I would say snake but he wasn't the snake yet amen he had a snake in his heart amen when and come and told Eve you know you could be a lot smarter you can improve on what you think you could be like us you could be like a God knowing good and evil and he seduced her isn't that right amen that's right brought forth a king huh a terar not as king who was of that Wicked one Jesus said the tears are the children of the wicked one there's your serpent seed as plain as day how many know if king would have been God's child when God gave him the opportunity he to repent and said oh God forgive me I'll do like my brother does oh my but kain's children don't repent he couldn't get those Pharisees to repent and he said you're your father to devil oh I'm so glad for the grace of God aren't you many of us in a day time have to have a new start sometimes say God I need to repent of my I need to repent of my slackness God is so gracious that if you need a new start 490 times a day he'll give it you huh we're to give each other a new start 490 times a day if that's what we need Lord help us not to need that much is't that right God is a generous merciful God we thank him for his grace but there was a new time it was sad they went weeping dressed in those sheep skins bloody sheep skin that God wrapped him in leaving the garden with fearful scared empty in their hearts no faith anymore because they were condemned having to go out and fend for themselves God cursed the ground hello God cursed the ground along with Adam and Eve to where they would die their eternal life their youth now they begin to get older my my my my the lions were cursed the elephants were cursed hello the Wolves were cursed the Shrubbery was cursed the tree was cursed they were all everything under Adam was in the same condition Adam was taken into [Music] death all had to die fearful nature Lions begin to kill this one and this one begin to kill that one it was a terrible State just like the world we're living in a terrible state but how many know whenever God redeems us when he redeems the world when he lifts the curse again that's the hour that I'm longing for when God lifts the Earth's curse anymore the trees will live forever the L will lay down with the lamb all the trees will grow and they won't die they won't fall off their leaves in the fall amen we're looking for that hour amen for that time we're preparing amen you can't just come up to that hour and not be prepared there has to be a preparation that's made amen I read was reading back there says you know people man they can't come to church it's just too cold it's too hot preachers too long winded this that or the other but they'll sit in front of a devil television for hours day and night and they got plenty of time for that don't give me no excuse It's where your interest is it's where your heart is it's where your treasure is that's where your heart will be also I so excited about what God is going to do for us in here in this coming year I praise him for what he has done in the past year Glory little over here now brother Tommy's still sitting there you could be running in the grave brother Tommy but God have mercy no doubt but you were saved you'd have been over there okay but still we wouldn't have had the opportunity having you that's right hell oh my I'm so thankful for God and for his goodness I hate I want to say again I hate negative reports I don't like people that are negative [Applause] amen what is it like the 10 F come back oh they can't do it it's terrible they're big there it's just the terrible don't tell me about your terrible situation tell me about my awesome God don't tell me about the big walls that we got to go through I want you to know we got a big God to make the rocks that they build it with how many believes that we're going to tear down wall we're going to leap over walls we're going to run through troops leap over walls hallelujah oh Hallelujah we going to glorify God we're going to Stomp and scream and shout amen we're going to be begin to praise God like we ain't never praised before we're going to thank God like we ain't never than God before we're going to submit our hearts to God like we've never submitted before we're going to experience the power of God like we've never experienced before we're going to experience healing like we've never expected before we're going to experience Deliverance like we ain't never experienced before why because I believe [Applause] it it's fine this is the year of [Applause] possession and Footprints means possessions have a great [Music] walk I preach to my belly hurt yeah all the economy it might it worse the price of a 2x4 might the price of you buite might go higher we not promis that things are going to get better in this world we're promis that it's going to get worse but for the church and for the bride things are going to get better amen I read word brother says if you got the word in your heart this coming year it's G to be good for you but if the word ain't there it's not going to be good for you I believe it's got to be good for [Music] us [Music] [Music] Footprints go take them I believe it's time to go take a land what land your land the land the devil wants to sit on where is that land that is that old self of yours how many believe we need to conquer this land we need to conquer our affections our emotions our our thought every bring thought captive to the word of God Amen come here brother Michael Footprints means possession amen what mean well didn't he tell Joshua

brother Bobby we have to say I'm going to control what goes through my mind I'm going to think the thoughts that God wants me to think if I don't like a thought cast it out if it's if it's a thought that's not of God throw it out oh there's just going to be so few and I am always so defeated there ain't no way I can make it don't you listen to that devil talking to you don't you listen to that devil I failed so many times I tried so many time don't you listen to that devil God is more than able we are more than able to take the land we can come to the Statue of a perfect man we can come to the fullness of Christ cuz the Bible said many brother said the church a b that the priz is going to be in his very image how many believe this year we're going to conform culture to the image of Christ then what we were in 2023 we're going to look more like Christ we're going to act more like Christ we're going to talk more like we going a lot more like Christ that's what I believe I don't care where a person is in the pit of despair scraping flopping around on their belly in the bottom of Hell unbelief miserable not thinking they can never go anywhere if you'll start to look up all you got to do is Lift Your Head Up Lift Your Head Up out of that mess out of that cpool begin to look at this right here begin to look at God it'll begin to lift you up out of that myy face it'll pick you up out of the deep my clay it'll wash you white it'll give you strength it'll clean you up it'll take that despair away from you it'll take that sorrow away from you it'll take that guilty conscience away from you it'll wash all your sins away the of God's forgetfulness and you can be a powerful son you could be a powerful daughter of God that stands against all the Ws of the enemy you can stand

Tabernacle those listening will put on the whole armor of God and quench every fiery Dart of the enemy quench it out it goes tries to put a thought of doubting you might just go on you ain't got no ride here may he become powerless how many believe it made up Church the Living God become the Invincible that you're supposed to be may we be a kind of people that ever don't know what to do with us let him sit there and rock his mind to see how he can stop us cuz he can't he didn't stop us last year he didn't stop us the year before he didn't stop us the year before he doesn't stop the 30 been here and he ain't going to stop us he not going to stop you this year the laughter of the redeemed Glory oh should I calm down a little bit I don't know about you but one my grandchildren get Happ happy they get loud I got to tell them quiet down a little bit paa doesn't want to hear all that noise can't help it yall want me to quiet down little no okay thank you very much thank you I

alive in is light of the Hour Eyes and shine morning stars for thy light has come gross Darkness it is gross absolutely gross Darkness upon the people terrible place that the world is in but not the to the Living God Seven billion people I asked Syria a while ago how many people it said seven billion people on the Earth I know none of us really can imagine that if I'm not wrong 1000 million is a billion right 1000 million so I guess it'd be 700 million right 700 million would be seven billion that's a lot of folks that's a lot of people there's a lot of folks out there people and most of is Canon father all of them's going to die huh every one of us think we're so special and I said guess we should because you are uniquely made by almighty God but I'm here to tell you that if God hasn't done something in your heart if he doesn't save you it have been better for you not that been born and if you are saved if you are saved if you have the Holy Ghost you shouldn't barely be able to keep your seats cuz it wasn't you it wasn't you it was all him why do you think the devil can't conquer you it's because you didn't start work he started the work he's going to sustain you and he's going to finish [Applause] it aren't you glad to be in his hands I believe we need to be surrendered to God more than what we ever have our Wills amen and I also believe that our treasure needs to be on things above not on things of this Earth cuz Jesus said where your treasure is that's where your heart's going to be also I want the whole world to know where my treasure is amen praise the Lord what I treasure praise the Lord and that's God that's the Lord Jesus Christ and the things of God thank you Lord Jesus ain't no telling where I laid them probably got them on my head but I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and grab the second pair here that's why I got a second pair but see or so thank you I know they're right down there God is good isn't he oh my Joshua one how many believe it's the hour and listen to me I like this because this is not just a New Year's Eve message how many this is a message we preach all year this is every day of the year message that we need to go in and we need to take possession of what is ours there's a whole lot more ours than just salvation there's more than just borned again because that's the new start amen even the beginning of the creation of God Amen Mark says this is the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ how many know the Gospel of Jesus Christ him come and being born in a manger oh it started a new thing didn't it oh John said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Amen he all were made by him and then there was not anything made that was made how many believes there was a new we talk about this for just a minute there was a new beginning when Jesus come on Earth that's why we have Christmas that's why we believe Amen brother bam said you know if there's no Christmas there's no Resurrection if there's no Christmas then there is no forgiveness of your sin if there's no Christmas then there is no New Birth nothing without the idea the truth about Christmas that is the celebration or the what whe CAU the commemoration of him coming to the Earth it was start of a new thing he was going to be start of a new creation a new creation Now how many knows that whenever Adam and Eve they were to bring forth children to populate the Earth but it wasn't be wasn't supposed to be by sex desire no it was supposed to be by the spoken word right the spoken word amen when Christ comes along amen then guess what he was going to bring children forth amen by I not listen which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Amen he came to his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God Amen even to them that believe on his name which were born born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man I believe it's Peter 1 and verse 23 he says being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God how many's glad that when your new birth takes place when the preaching of the word Goes Forth and you believe on his name it births sons and daughters it's a new creation I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man old things have passed away I've been born again more than a conqueror that's what I am I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man how many knows the church now his bride speaks word and children are born sons and daughters are born that's right you're the spoken word not of corrupt the seat but of Incorruptible by the word of God all right now listen to this which liveth and abideth forever a genuine born again son and daughter of God how could they pass away huh no huh listen for All Flesh is as grass and all the glory of man is as flower of grass the grass wither and the flower of death fadeth away that's right don't care how big how strong you are you're going to get old Arnold Schwarzenegger and them guys these Hercules they're going to shrivel up dry up die amen and so every one of us the glory of our flesh fadeth how many believes it we get old amen but this new man that's born again not of the will of Flesh not of the will of man a't that nice all the father has given me will come inside of this flesh there had to be that germ of life that seed of God laying that's what gives you that desire to want to go to church that's what gives you the desire to want to be a better Christian than what you are oh my how many believe it's the rising of the Sun God is quickening his children with that sunlight but Abraham says you know if your word I mean your flesh gets quickened by the word of God he says When God Says something your flesh quickly turns to it is that right it quickly comes subject to it amen and it shows that you've got a Resurrection coming cuz how many knows as we subject to the word and mean the word says this and say oh that's me the preaching sure stepping on my toes but Lord help me quickly comes into it because one of these days the very Adams in this flesh will come subject to the word of God when the Trump of God down the dead shall rise amen and then we which are alive will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye this flesh will come subject to God's command it's time to come up higher to change bodies amen but if your body if people will not come subject to the word of God huh they won't come Quicken they their soul isn't doesn't Quicken to the word come alive to the word no I don't believe that how are they ever going to get a body change how are they ever going to come up in the resurrection when they wouldn't even allow God to bring them to the place to where they were ready for a change how many these God has to make is ready for a change and that's what he's doing folks if I'm here to tell you if Thomas berer wasn't preaching the word of God and the truth of God this church didn't believe the word of God didn't want to hear I find me a church that did where the word of God is going forth and changing people's lives how many believes it's about the word of God not me or the preacher any it's about the holy spirit it's about God about people that loves the Lord that wants to change even better B says I tell you right now me when I want be on the curtain of time I've seen all of that and unless you've got perfect love you'll never enter into there he says and I tell you people don't stay on the same conditions that you are amen change now how many believe God is in the changing a heart lives business there's something seriously wrong with you if you were the same in 2023 as you was in 2022 there's going to be something seriously wrong with you if you're the same in 2024 as you was in 2023 and we can't just turn new pages turn new leaves oh Lord I I'm going to try to do it now you get on your knees and you say God change me Lord it takes you to change me it takes the Holy Spirit to change me I mean that's why we need more people on their prayer bones and saying God come down I don't want to stay on the same place that I was closer to you I want to be a better husband to my wife I want to be a better uh Grandpa to my oh my I want to be a better father to my children I want to be a better Grandpa to

and all the people said amen so be it amen so be it let's go forward the next year is going to be great for the believer yes you could have the greatest chaos they could shut this place down but for us it's still going to be greater than ever yes why because we know that the scripture says that when they shut her up we can run the aisles until they chase us out then we're going to go out on the streets and we're going to run the streets because this word says when they shut they won't shut her up but she's going to go up they try to shut her up she's going to go up yes we'll know the time is there yes amen it's got to get worse in this world Amen but not for his people it's going to get better you may lose all possessions yep amen but Braham talked about us losing stuff that's right all kinds of stuff ain't no telling what all we'll lose yet right huh just one little in I didn't go in a whole page or two but where but talked about how that the prophecy that we've seen him come to pass he says watch for the signs of the time watch for the moving of the drums and the symphony you know you know what's going to happen next you know and so forth and then you look at the signs of the time he said it's in our papers it's this that or the other and how many knows over in New York they're trying to pass a law to try to make Chick-fil-A open on Sunday amen I mean not Billy Graham but uh Graham the senator he says This Means War well we've been in war for a long time I wouldn't doubt but they'll win when you got judges that side with such what chance do you have isn't that right right amen they want to shut them down they want to pressure them to make them do against their own religion ain't that right and when you see that squeeze begin to come down folks lift up your heads I think brother Brian read it in Sunday school so about lift up your heads when these things happen your Redemption is drawing nigh how many are Redemption is drawing nigh we see the signs we see the world getting darker but we see a group people all over the world not just here but we see them getting on fire we see God doing something changing us amen oh my let's bow our heads Lord Jesus

you said that you answer us if we ask anything according to your will and Lord I believe that the prayer going right now is according to your will that we would be more like you that we'd be in your very image Lord the things of carnality would go by the wayside Lord and father the spiritual church would just be built up in the most holy faith in God until the people that are not saved would get saved Lord that their children would be born unto you Lord and those that Lord are Christians God that they would learn father in their trials and in their tribulations God to lean on you and to let you fight their battles and Lord may they be amen like David it doesn't matter how big the Goliath is he's coming down for David's Faith was in you may that be us Lord May sickness have no place in the church may it be rebuked in the name of Jesus Christ may we be help Lord for it is all right it's a children's bread healing is the children's bread and Lord I ask God that each one Lord would be
