[1:04:30] Ephesians Ephesians
[1:04:41] three and tonight I want to speak to us
[1:04:44] on how to be a stronger Christian amen
[1:04:50] closer to God Amen if I'm not wrong I
[1:04:53] didn't have enough time to look it up
[1:04:55] there but uh and I'm thinking that
[1:04:57] brother Bram talked about an older
[1:04:59] couple in the Amen in the church that
[1:05:02] was there and he says if there'd be one
[1:05:04] thing that he would ask them amen if
[1:05:06] they have a desire for and I believe it
[1:05:08] was closer to God Amen they want to be
[1:05:10] closer to God and I believe as long as
[1:05:12] we're here amen we're always going to
[1:05:14] want to be closer to God aren't we amen
[1:05:17] we're going to be wantan to be stronger
[1:05:18] in God closer to God amen amen how many
[1:05:22] believes that one day perhaps we won't
[1:05:24] have to desire that
[1:05:26] anymore y'all caught that didn't you
[1:05:29] amen because we'll be with God Amen
[1:05:32] we'll be right there with God Amen wow
[1:05:36] how many's looking forward to that amen
[1:05:39] that's our expectation isn't it that's
[1:05:41] what we're looking forward to
[1:05:43] amen amen praise the
[1:05:46] Lord
[1:05:49] amen all right so Ephesians 3 and we'll
[1:05:52] begin with verse 14 for for this cause I
[1:05:55] bow my knees unto the father of our Lord
[1:05:58] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[1:06:01] Heaven and Earth is named that he would
[1:06:04] Grant you according to the riches of his
[1:06:08] glory to be strengthened
[1:06:11] amen amen with
[1:06:15] might by his spirit in the Inner Man
[1:06:20] amen I titled this amen um
[1:06:24] strengthening the inner man amen that
[1:06:28] you might be that was his whole heart's
[1:06:30] desire wasn't it that Christ verse 17
[1:06:33] might dwell in your hearts by faith and
[1:06:36] ye being rooted and grounded in love may
[1:06:38] be able to comprehend with All Saints
[1:06:41] what is the breadth and length and depth
[1:06:43] and height and to the know the love of
[1:06:45] Christ which passes knowledge that you
[1:06:47] might be filled with all the fullness of
[1:06:51] God the next scripture is in 10
[1:06:53] Ephesians 6 and
[1:06:55] 10 few pages
[1:06:57] [Music]
[1:07:03] over finally my brethren be strong amen
[1:07:09] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[1:07:13] of His might amen put on the whole armor
[1:07:16] of God that you may be able to stand
[1:07:19] against the Ws of the devil amen third
[1:07:22] scripture is in
[1:07:32] Hebrews the book of
[1:07:34] Hebrews the fth chapter Hebrews
[1:07:39] 5 and verse
[1:07:44] 13 He was talking about being needing to
[1:07:47] be teachers and so forth I believe it
[1:07:51] is 5 and 14
[1:07:55] for everyone that uses milk is
[1:07:58] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:08:01] for he is a babe but strong meat
[1:08:03] belongeth to them that are of full age
[1:08:05] even those who by reason of yous have
[1:08:07] their senses exercised to both discern
[1:08:11] good and evil may God add his Blessing
[1:08:13] to the reading of the word you can be
[1:08:16] seated amen praise the
[1:08:19] lord well amen I don't know about you
[1:08:23] but I just always enjoy being able to
[1:08:26] have some time out amen for us all to
[1:08:29] take a little time out just to focus and
[1:08:31] to meditate on the Lord to talk about
[1:08:34] the Lord amen amen one place brother bam
[1:08:38] talked about brother El brother I think
[1:08:40] it was brother or Neville and his church
[1:08:42] would just you know he says man you just
[1:08:44] about the time you get going you quit he
[1:08:47] says we are ought to have go a little
[1:08:48] bit longer look amen he really believed
[1:08:51] in it you know because whenever you talk
[1:08:53] about the Lord he said you know like
[1:08:55] those disciples coming from the road of
[1:08:57] EMAs they were talking about him and he
[1:08:59] says whenever you talk about him he
[1:09:01] draws close how many beli that when we
[1:09:03] preach about him when we bring his word
[1:09:05] with begin it draws him in
[1:09:08] amen amen and that's what we want that
[1:09:11] what we want is for the Holy Spirit to
[1:09:13] just come down and come on the waves I
[1:09:15] heard him say come down on the waves and
[1:09:17] just saturate every heart come down in a
[1:09:19] special way move and draw us closer to
[1:09:23] him amen we want to be stronger
[1:09:26] Christians by the help and grace of God
[1:09:29] I was going to and I think I actually
[1:09:32] I'm not sure if I hit print or not but
[1:09:33] he says you know doesn't matter how
[1:09:35] smart you are how many phds you have and
[1:09:38] all these other stuff and how he says
[1:09:41] and even know the Bible until you can
[1:09:43] rehearse it until until you have a
[1:09:46] dictionary you can recite the dictionary
[1:09:48] he says that's not going to bring you
[1:09:49] closer to God he says but a humble
[1:09:52] surrendered con created heart is what
[1:09:55] will bring you closer to God amen amen
[1:09:59] that's what we will know in this coming
[1:10:00] year amen in this coming year we just I
[1:10:03] thought maybe this would be a good
[1:10:05] second sermon Amen in this year amen of
[1:10:08] uh how that we might be closer and
[1:10:10] stronger because Paul certainly desired
[1:10:13] of us to be a stronger amen and that we
[1:10:16] might be
[1:10:17] strengthened Amen in the Inner Man amen
[1:10:22] how many knows on the out side man amen
[1:10:24] the only way you'll ever get stronger is
[1:10:27] if you
[1:10:28] exercise is that right and so if that
[1:10:31] true for the outside man it's true of
[1:10:33] the inside man amen people that never
[1:10:36] exercise their faith they're not going
[1:10:38] to be very strong amen and all these
[1:10:41] things have to be exercised and we
[1:10:43] appreciate that amen it'll make you
[1:10:45] stronger amen and that's what we want
[1:10:49] praise be to God amen amen wow so so
[1:10:54] there's a lot of areas we can go and we
[1:10:56] don't know just how far we'll go but
[1:10:58] amen we certainly uh want to take just a
[1:11:02] quote amen and I I couldn't hardly find
[1:11:05] this and when I did I was thankful but I
[1:11:08] wanted to take an experience of brother
[1:11:10] brandham as an illustration to start
[1:11:12] with this morning amen this evening with
[1:11:15] the help of the Lord and then we'll go
[1:11:17] and of course we can talk about Abraham
[1:11:20] who was not weak in faith you know but
[1:11:22] was strong giving God glory how many
[1:11:24] believes that Abraham was strong in
[1:11:27] faith amen but let me just read the
[1:11:29] quote brother bam says I was standing
[1:11:31] the other day at Lake Michigan and I
[1:11:33] went over to Lake Superior on my road to
[1:11:36] Canada that large body of water I stood
[1:11:39] there and I thought many miles is is it
[1:11:41] is across this great straight of water
[1:11:44] and then after I crossed Lake Michigan
[1:11:46] and then was Lake Superior and I would
[1:11:48] come into Michigan almost an equal body
[1:11:50] of water from Lake Superior to Lake
[1:11:52] Michigan and from from Michigan to Lake
[1:11:55] Ontario and uron and all the Lakes
[1:11:58] together and many how many billion times
[1:12:01] billions time
[1:12:03] billions of innumerable barrels of
[1:12:06] freshwater lays within that Lake Amen
[1:12:10] brother bam he could pick up a cigarette
[1:12:12] and preach a message on it couldn't he
[1:12:14] he could look at a lake and begin to
[1:12:17] preach a message on it
[1:12:18] amen amen I'm glad that we still have
[1:12:21] the inspiration to be able to preach
[1:12:23] things
[1:12:24] like fresh water lays in that Lake and
[1:12:26] Yonder in Nevada and in Arizona New
[1:12:29] Mexico Eastern California lays millions
[1:12:32] of Acres of parched burning ground
[1:12:35] that's so fertile that if that water
[1:12:38] could ever get to that ground this
[1:12:40] nation could feed the
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:44] world Amen Hallelujah without any hungry
[1:12:48] people we'd have Surplus to throw into
[1:12:52] the sea
[1:12:54] I like that word
[1:12:56] Surplus amen that's right a millions of
[1:12:59] Acres that would grow tons uh uh of
[1:13:03] radishes wait a minute tons of times
[1:13:06] millions of tons of potatoes and cabbage
[1:13:09] and beans and lettuce and radishes and
[1:13:12] celery and cucumbers and what more the
[1:13:15] ground would grow it it's just longing
[1:13:18] for that
[1:13:20] water oh my
[1:13:23] 's the
[1:13:25] water up here amen and here's the ground
[1:13:28] down here now we can see it and we know
[1:13:31] that it would do it because if we could
[1:13:33] test the water we see it's fresh we test
[1:13:36] the soil to see that it's fertile now
[1:13:38] all the wishing that we could do we'll
[1:13:39] never put them
[1:13:41] together amen are you reading between
[1:13:44] the lines tonight how many know we've
[1:13:47] got stored up food we've got radishes
[1:13:51] we've got all these things we've got got
[1:13:53] all the tapes we've got everything that
[1:13:55] we have need
[1:13:57] of to make you and to feed you and to
[1:14:00] fill you up and to give you Surplus to
[1:14:04] give you more than what you
[1:14:08] need amen but you got to figure out how
[1:14:12] to get it
[1:14:13] together doesn't do any good just on the
[1:14:16] tapes and on the
[1:14:17] books it's got to go further than that
[1:14:20] is that right how many believe that
[1:14:22] there's in the kingdom of God there's
[1:14:25] joy there's peace there's amen there's
[1:14:27] longsuffering there's the fruit of the
[1:14:30] spirit there's longsuffering and
[1:14:32] gentleness and meekness and Temperance
[1:14:34] and patience and love and
[1:14:37] faith there's power unlimited the
[1:14:41] unlimited power in the body of
[1:14:46] Christ how many believes he
[1:14:50] there it's just that
[1:14:53] can we get
[1:14:55] it how do we both got getting
[1:15:00] this CU I don't know about you but I
[1:15:02] could use a little Surplus Joy couldn't
[1:15:04] you I could have my I like my cup full
[1:15:08] and running over don't you I don't like
[1:15:11] to be a quarter full or just a little
[1:15:12] bit I'm afraid that's where a lot of
[1:15:14] people
[1:15:15] are amen they just got a little bit in
[1:15:18] the
[1:15:20] cup just enough to make them come to
[1:15:25] church huh amen but never not enough not
[1:15:29] enough to raise your hand not enough to
[1:15:31] really
[1:15:32] just all right preach it
[1:15:36] brother
[1:15:38] huh but there's so much I'm many
[1:15:41] know man when I think about
[1:15:46] it oh let me finish this I want to get
[1:15:49] to something else but now notice
[1:15:53] that's
[1:15:54] right now all the wishing that we could
[1:15:57] do will never bring them together but
[1:16:00] there is a law and that law is
[1:16:04] gravitation now if we' work according to
[1:16:06] the law of gravitation we could water
[1:16:08] every bit of that land taking the water
[1:16:11] from the lakes and watering it but we'll
[1:16:13] have to work according to the law of
[1:16:15] gravitation we can't wish it out there
[1:16:17] you can't scream it out there you can't
[1:16:19] holler it out there you've got to work
[1:16:21] according to the law of
[1:16:24] gravitation oh my listen to what he says
[1:16:27] the power and the power he says that'll
[1:16:31] rais us up is right in us now we are now
[1:16:36] in Heavenly places we are we are now in
[1:16:39] the power of the
[1:16:45] Resurrection amen how many believe
[1:16:47] that if you're filled with the Holy
[1:16:50] Ghost tonight you got the power of the
[1:16:53] Resurrection in
[1:16:55] you if there wasn't now listen we are
[1:16:57] now under power of the Resurrection now
[1:16:59] if there wasn't a law to that Sons and
[1:17:02] Daughters of God would create them a
[1:17:05] world out there and go and live a
[1:17:08] private life on
[1:17:11] it w how mean is the laws of Faith
[1:17:14] there's a law of
[1:17:18] Faith amen whatsoever things you desire
[1:17:23] when you ask believe that you'll receive
[1:17:26] it and you have
[1:17:30] it
[1:17:32] now first of all to me that's like that
[1:17:36] Lake Superior up there look look up
[1:17:38] there's so much
[1:17:41] there whatsoever things you
[1:17:45] ask to me that's just a little hard to
[1:17:50] believe I'm just going to be honest with
[1:17:52] you that right don't call me an
[1:17:54] nonbeliever but it's just hard to
[1:18:00] believe ask anything in my name and I
[1:18:03] would do
[1:18:05] it a that just a little hard to
[1:18:07] believe
[1:18:09] what
[1:18:18] anything now how many knows you got to
[1:18:20] be a little careful with that
[1:18:24] you got to be a little careful with that
[1:18:27] now I'm not casting
[1:18:28] doubt but there's more
[1:18:31] scripture there's more scripture that's
[1:18:33] not the only
[1:18:35] scripture one place he says if we ask
[1:18:37] anything according to his will we
[1:18:40] receive what we ask
[1:18:42] for and even brother Braham said there's
[1:18:44] a law to that if there's not a law to
[1:18:46] the that Faith he says you could go and
[1:18:49] build the
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:51] world that's not all let me read a
[1:18:53] little bit more shall
[1:18:54] [Applause]
[1:18:57] I that's right private life on you have
[1:19:00] the power in you to do it if you've got
[1:19:03] a shadow of the power of God in you you
[1:19:07] got the power to do it God is omnipotent
[1:19:10] see what I mean the power is in you you
[1:19:13] could speak a world into existence and
[1:19:15] go living on it hallelu there you
[1:19:18] are that's the what power is in the
[1:19:21] church now
[1:19:25] but it's controlled by a
[1:19:29] law
[1:19:31] huh and that law is not deeping a bunch
[1:19:34] of Commandments it's the law of Faith
[1:19:37] Jesus said all things are possible to
[1:19:40] them that
[1:19:41] believe if you can believe
[1:19:45] it huh if you can believe it if you can
[1:19:48] have faith for
[1:19:50] it huh amen
[1:19:53] whatever God would lead your soul to
[1:19:57] believe it's
[1:20:01] yours if thou can't believe all things
[1:20:05] are
[1:20:09] possible
[1:20:11] amen all right that is yours I like that
[1:20:15] whatever God leads your heart and soul
[1:20:17] to believe how and I would think
[1:20:19] studying this because let me let me just
[1:20:21] I can't just
[1:20:23] seemed to get all this out but he talked
[1:20:26] about how that people would get so under
[1:20:29] the anointing of the Holy Spirit they
[1:20:31] would climb so high in
[1:20:33] God isn't that right that they would
[1:20:35] write Songs amazing grace and How Sweet
[1:20:37] the Sound and different ones like that
[1:20:39] and some of them went to suicide after
[1:20:42] they come off of that way being up there
[1:20:44] that high that spiritual high so to
[1:20:46] speak ain't that right didn't brother
[1:20:48] brandham come caught so much in the
[1:20:50] spirit until he would have to go and
[1:20:52] this is some jokes or walk it off or
[1:20:55] come back
[1:20:56] down amen and when you come back down
[1:20:58] it's a rough time it's like oh my it's
[1:21:01] real rough when you come down from that
[1:21:03] atmosphere down to here back into the
[1:21:06] world that you actually live
[1:21:09] in huh they would climb so
[1:21:14] high oh
[1:21:16] my and they would write songs and I
[1:21:19] believe that I don't know about you but
[1:21:21] I think well you know one of the things
[1:21:23] that I thought about is that look if you
[1:21:26] know how we have Mountaintop
[1:21:28] experiences we get up on the mountain
[1:21:30] top all things are possible now might we
[1:21:34] have joy unspeakable I don't know about
[1:21:36] you but I believe that we need to just
[1:21:37] keep climbing as high as we can if I'm
[1:21:39] gonna go up on the mountain brother John
[1:21:41] I'm just G to go all the way to top I
[1:21:44] ain't going halfway up Mount Everest I
[1:21:46] want to go PL to the
[1:21:48] top are you with me we're got to go high
[1:21:51] let's go way high
[1:21:53] let's go so high that our children get
[1:21:56] up so high until maybe they'll write
[1:21:58] poem even Elena is writing
[1:22:00] poems huh maybe bright poems maybe write
[1:22:05] songs maybe see Visions or be able to
[1:22:09] have God lay it on their heart to
[1:22:11] believe something and say brother I give
[1:22:13] you what you have need of in the name of
[1:22:15] the Lord but how many knows you can't
[1:22:17] just say that on your own it'll never
[1:22:20] work if it's on your own that's where
[1:22:23] people miss this scripture is they think
[1:22:25] well I can just say it I can just
[1:22:29] believe it I can just ask it I wanted
[1:22:31] you to know that God won't give you
[1:22:33] Faith to believe something that ain't
[1:22:34] according to his
[1:22:36] word you might think you have faith but
[1:22:39] if isn't given to you by God there is
[1:22:41] not not real genuine faith and you're
[1:22:43] going to fail and flop and fall right
[1:22:45] down on your
[1:22:48] facei amen that's why I said be
[1:22:51] careful
[1:22:53] because even the prophet of God said he
[1:22:54] has to be hard you wouldn't just even
[1:22:56] brother bam when he was Discerning
[1:22:58] thought they'd say well listen they'd
[1:22:59] come to him and says look if you'll just
[1:23:01] say that I'm GNA be well just say those
[1:23:04] words and I'm GNA believe it you know
[1:23:07] what is that what he did they did he
[1:23:10] says I can't do
[1:23:13] that all Roberts and Billy Graham they
[1:23:16] might be able to lay hands on you're
[1:23:17] healed in the name of Jesus huh and of
[1:23:21] course we're healed in the name of Jesus
[1:23:22] Jesus we believe that by his stries were
[1:23:24] healed but to tell a person you are
[1:23:26] healed of your disease he says then what
[1:23:27] if you
[1:23:28] didn't what if you didn't get well and I
[1:23:31] said you in the name of the Lord I would
[1:23:34] be speaking on my own how many know
[1:23:36] brother Bon would wait for that the
[1:23:38] quote to be fulfilled God would have to
[1:23:40] lay it on his
[1:23:43] heart amen how many knows that's the
[1:23:46] kind of Christians we want to be we want
[1:23:49] to be strong Christians that we can
[1:23:51] actually amen speak something
[1:23:54] amen praise the Lord and it be God
[1:23:58] because if it's God it won't
[1:24:00] fail
[1:24:02] amen praise the
[1:24:04] Lord amen I believe we've had our
[1:24:06] exercise Faith even exercise today
[1:24:09] because of things that happen
[1:24:12] amen we've had a certain need now it's
[1:24:14] like if thou can't believe amen what do
[1:24:16] you ask for you'll have
[1:24:20] it and many if you can you fin believe
[1:24:23] it you'll have what you've asked for God
[1:24:26] will give you the faith to believe
[1:24:28] it
[1:24:30] amen M all things are possible to have
[1:24:33] that belief whatever Godly leads you to
[1:24:35] Soul to believe that's yours every place
[1:24:38] the soul of your feet can
[1:24:40] set God gives it to you amen it's yours
[1:24:43] you possess it if you can just find the
[1:24:46] key to this law of faith it opens it up
[1:24:49] to you how many knows it one of those
[1:24:52] Keys is to be surrendered to God it's to
[1:24:55] be dedicated to almighty God D met so
[1:24:58] much so until you're not living your own
[1:25:01] life but it's the Holy Ghost living in
[1:25:03] you that's the key to it it's his faith
[1:25:07] th will be
[1:25:11] done
[1:25:13] amen oh my now
[1:25:16] listen Faith opens it up to you see what
[1:25:18] I mean the power is controlled if you
[1:25:20] are a son of God you're a daughter of
[1:25:22] God that never leaves you amen it's with
[1:25:26] you all the time but your faith gets
[1:25:29] away from it but it's but it's still
[1:25:32] there the everpresent water from the
[1:25:34] Rock brother bam was preaching he's ever
[1:25:39] present when you are s saved God gives
[1:25:43] you Faith to rais from the muck of the
[1:25:44] world and your faith overcomes the world
[1:25:48] what is your faith how many knows what
[1:25:49] your faith is one of the things that
[1:25:51] make you a strong Christian is if you've
[1:25:53] got a genuine revelation of almighty God
[1:25:55] the gates of hell can't even Prevail
[1:25:57] against that what is it that overcomes
[1:26:00] the world what is your Victory the Bible
[1:26:02] says your Victory is your
[1:26:04] faith faith is the victory that
[1:26:07] overcomes the
[1:26:08] world if you ever have any Victory it's
[1:26:11] because you down in your heart says I
[1:26:14] believe I'm overcome
[1:26:17] that that faith is what overcomes it if
[1:26:21] you know I don't believe I'm never going
[1:26:22] to get
[1:26:24] better no I'm never going to be a better
[1:26:26] Christian I'm always going to have this
[1:26:28] shortcoming I'm always going to have
[1:26:30] this weak Link in my life come on folks
[1:26:33] Devil's language but if you have faith
[1:26:37] that faith is what overcomes the
[1:26:41] world of course one of that's one of the
[1:26:44] strongest things love is another one but
[1:26:47] we're going to dwell on faith a little
[1:26:48] bit that faith is the victory that
[1:26:49] overcomes the world praise the Lord
[1:26:52] Lord all right that's right it was your
[1:26:57] faith come overcomes to your faith is
[1:26:59] the act that God has did in you to make
[1:27:02] you a Son of God you quit your lying you
[1:27:06] quit your stealing you quit your
[1:27:07] drinking because your faith Rises you
[1:27:09] above it amen if you don't do it then
[1:27:12] you don't have any faith and by faith
[1:27:14] are you saved and that's who Grace as
[1:27:16] much as your faith will be released
[1:27:19] that's how much power that you can have
[1:27:21] how many know that this here is the
[1:27:23] sword of the spirit this is God Sword
[1:27:27] but it'll only cut as deep as the faith
[1:27:30] that you have to cut
[1:27:32] with amen takes Faith to cut out a big
[1:27:36] chunk amen my my my all
[1:27:43] right as much Faith as will be released
[1:27:46] that's how much power you can have
[1:27:47] because it
[1:27:49] dwells you dwells in the power in you
[1:27:52] dwells the power to make heavens and
[1:27:57] earth I mean we have the very same faith
[1:28:01] that God had that he spoke the world
[1:28:04] into
[1:28:09] existence now I believe that this year
[1:28:13] even now I believe that the church has
[1:28:16] Faith to speak things that they don't
[1:28:19] see feel or hear
[1:28:22] and speak it into
[1:28:24] existence amen maybe you got a wavered
[1:28:27] loved ones don't look good at all huh
[1:28:30] God can change
[1:28:32] that God can grant you the faith to pray
[1:28:35] for that person amen and God can bring
[1:28:37] them
[1:28:38] in things that are not as though they
[1:28:42] are amen I want to take Abraham for an
[1:28:46] example for just a little bit but so now
[1:28:48] listen let me finish this quote here I
[1:28:50] only got a couple quotes
[1:28:52] see in you there's Faith to make heavens
[1:28:57] and the
[1:29:01] Earth how many times I'd love to know

[1:30:18] to kill that
[1:30:20] God he wasn't the
[1:30:22] PR and that's what we need church we
[1:30:25] need Christians that God speaks through
[1:30:27] your heart not just a pastor your heart

[1:30:33] to like

[1:33:43] prayer we don't spend enough time
[1:33:46] meditating on the
[1:33:48] Lord listening to God Amen

[1:33:54] ought to
[1:33:55] be huh I don't know if I got that quote
[1:33:59] or not I
[1:34:10] don't let me just read this that's the
[1:34:13] reason that he doesn't appear to too
[1:34:15] many of us today our conversations is
[1:34:17] talking about everything else but Christ
[1:34:20] we're always talking about well when
[1:34:23] we're going to get this work done or
[1:34:25] what we're going to do here let your
[1:34:27] conversation be in Christ that's when he
[1:34:30] appears it's when we talk about him when
[1:34:33] we're speaking about him it's not
[1:34:36] the on Pentecost he was talking about
[1:34:39] Pentecost and how that they had gotten
[1:34:40] away amen from the Lord amen away from
[1:34:45] Faith that's why they were in the
[1:34:47] condition that they were let me just
[1:34:49] finish this here before we go to next
[1:34:51] thought
[1:34:53] listen so he says verily verily I say
[1:34:57] unto you if you say it is Mountain be
[1:34:59] moved and don't doubt but believe that
[1:35:02] what you have asked it'll be done then
[1:35:05] what kind of people ought we to
[1:35:07] be
[1:35:10] huh having faith in his great redeeming
[1:35:14] Christ that lives in us this smitten
[1:35:16] rock that never leaves the church I Am
[1:35:19] With You Always even into the end of the
[1:35:22] world the everpresent of the great
[1:35:25] gusher of Salvation and power that
[1:35:28] poured forth from Calvary into the
[1:35:31] church the ever presence of the Living
[1:35:34] God great flowing the smitten rock that
[1:35:37] always goes with us wherever we go how
[1:35:42] many believe that flowing
[1:35:45] river is with you on Wednesday night and
[1:35:48] Sunday night no always
[1:35:53] wherever you
[1:35:57] go
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:36:03] amen
[1:36:05] Abraham let's talk about him for a
[1:36:07] minute I want to go a couple more places
[1:36:10] all right we got time good let's go to
[1:36:17] Romans let's look at the strength of
[1:36:20] Abraham
[1:36:21] how Abraham was strong and also Noah I
[1:36:26] want to talk to Noah a little
[1:36:34] bit Romans
[1:36:38] 4 verse
[1:36:47] 17 as it is written I have made thee a
[1:36:50] father of of many
[1:36:52] nations before whom he believed even God
[1:36:56] who quickeneth the dead and calth those
[1:36:59] things which be not as though they
[1:37:04] are who against hope believed in hope
[1:37:08] that he might become the father of many
[1:37:10] nations according to that which was
[1:37:13] spoken so shall thy seed be how many
[1:37:18] times B says look how Abraham was
[1:37:21] how do we compare and we say that we're
[1:37:24] the children of
[1:37:27] Abraham and being not weak in faith he
[1:37:29] considered not his own body now dead
[1:37:33] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:37:35] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:37:38] he staggered not at the promise God
[1:37:41] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:37:45] given glory to God being fully persuaded
[1:37:48] that what he had promised he is also
[1:37:51] able to
[1:37:53] preform I me know Abraham was strong in
[1:37:57] faith Paul says staggered not at the
[1:38:00] promise of God called those things that
[1:38:02] were not as though they were folks how
[1:38:07] many believes here in this end time here
[1:38:08] we're looking we're either facing the
[1:38:10] Trib and atomic bomb and destruction or
[1:38:14] ref facing the
[1:38:17] Rapture how many believe that and
[1:38:20] there's a promis we are promised a body
[1:38:24] change amen it might not seem like it it
[1:38:27] may not look like it but the very faith
[1:38:30] that Abraham had as we are Sons and
[1:38:32] Daughters of God know that one of these
[1:38:34] days we will be changed in the very
[1:38:39] Adams a the world might think we're
[1:38:42] fools and foolish and stupid all that
[1:38:45] other stuff but guess what I mean know
[1:38:48] all of us we're coming to church on
[1:38:50] Wednesday night because we're looking
[1:38:51] things that are not
[1:38:53] yet they're
[1:38:55] invisible but they're going to
[1:38:59] be Noah was Noah he was so he was strong
[1:39:03] in faith he had not only waited 25 years
[1:39:06] like Abraham did but we waited 120
[1:39:09] years is that right I call it
[1:39:13] cataclysmic
[1:39:15] Faith the bride tonight I believe has
[1:39:19] cataclysmic faith
[1:39:22] other words it's a world
[1:39:25] event it was going to drown the whole
[1:39:31] world maybe we'll get to see the replay
[1:39:35] of Noah preaching to
[1:39:36] everybody and then taking a GoPro and
[1:39:41] going showing the
[1:39:43] audience this guy think the whole
[1:39:46] world's GNA flood this guy's Cy he's not
[1:39:51] did you see that big boat that he's
[1:39:53] building up on top of hill it's not even
[1:39:57] close to the
[1:39:58] ocean oh D all kinds of ID all kinds of
[1:40:02] laughter all kinds of
[1:40:04] mocking but Noah had great
[1:40:08] faith he knew it was going to happen a't
[1:40:11] that right how about you tonight how
[1:40:14] many knows that Peter promised that this
[1:40:16] world's going to be on fire there's a
[1:40:19] fire coming to this world it's going to
[1:40:21] be
[1:40:22] cataclysmic isn't that right but we're
[1:40:25] going to be Chang in the moment in the
[1:40:27] twinkling of an eye we're going to
[1:40:29] change from this world into the next
[1:40:31] because of the faith that is in our
[1:40:36] hearts strong in
[1:40:40] faith strong in
[1:40:42] faith amen I love that don't
[1:40:46] you oh my of course we won't go on to
[1:40:50] this too much
[1:40:51] but in James 1 Thor talks about the
[1:40:53] trial of your faith amen Amen Let me let
[1:40:58] me uh that's let me make sure I get that
[1:41:01] right that's right I think the trial of
[1:41:04] your faith was Peter James said my Breen
[1:41:06] count it all joy when you fall into
[1:41:07] diverse Temptation knowing this that the
[1:41:09] trying of your faith Works patience how
[1:41:12] manyan knows if we never got trials if
[1:41:14] we never had any wind
[1:41:16] blow you wouldn't get
[1:41:19] stronger you had no
[1:41:21] com coming against you you wouldn't get
[1:41:24] stronger that's why we learned from the
[1:41:27] bear to the lion to Goliath and Goliath
[1:41:29] is just a little bitty F compared to the
[1:41:32] 10 Philistines that surrounded David and
[1:41:35] everybody else and he had to go out and
[1:41:37] kill all of them
[1:41:38] hello sometimes we have a lot of devils
[1:41:41] that we got to fight a lot of doubts we
[1:41:43] got to fight
[1:41:45] amen that's
[1:41:47] right but trials make us stronger the
[1:41:51] trying of our faith a testing of our
[1:41:52] faith makes you
[1:41:57] stronger
[1:41:59] amen bigger Big
[1:42:02] Stuff
[1:42:04] amen you love him praise the
[1:42:08] Lord hallelujah
[1:42:12] now I want to go to one more thought
[1:42:15] here and I want to go to another thing
[1:42:18] that makes you stronger
[1:42:22] Psalms one if you want to go with me
[1:42:25] Psalms 1 let me see I've got three
[1:42:30] places I want to go actually my last
[1:42:32] three
[1:42:40] scriptures Psalms one blessed is the man
[1:42:44] that walketh not the counsil of the
[1:42:46] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:42:48] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:42:51] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:42:53] of the Lord and in his law does he
[1:42:56] meditate on Wednesday
[1:43:00] night and on Sunday
[1:43:03] morning once in a
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:08] while hello I'm open that there's people
[1:43:11] listening to me out there am cuz the
[1:43:14] fact is that some of us older folks we
[1:43:17] get into such a rut until we never get
[1:43:19] out of that rut and we are what we're
[1:43:21] going to be we read as much pray as much
[1:43:23] as what we're pretty much going
[1:43:25] to H but how many know better man said

[1:43:33] I'll tell you who you are what kind of
[1:43:35] spirits on you let me ask you let me
[1:43:38] look at what you do all the time and

[1:44:03] strength it'll do crazy stuff to
[1:44:06] you amen the Bible says that by the
[1:44:09] foolishness of preaching faith comes by
[1:44:12] hearing ain't that right faith comes by
[1:44:15] hearing the word of God so when we
[1:44:18] preach about David we preach about this
[1:44:20] we preach about that amen but guess what
[1:44:23] because it's going into your ear and
[1:44:26] he's going into your
[1:44:27] mind hopefully down into your heart and
[1:44:30] when you're meditating on him Bible says
[1:44:34] blessed is he whose mind you stay on
[1:44:38] the the way what you meditate on oh I
[1:44:42] cry when I wake up I say Lord let me
[1:44:44] meditate on you before I got up this
[1:44:47] morning praying Lord Jesus I pray that
[1:44:49] you'll help me through the day and me
[1:44:50] just laid there for a minute and thought

[1:45:06] get out of bed when I get on the floor
[1:45:09] he's down under my feet that's where he
[1:45:16] belongs
[1:45:18] Amen brother Bram didn't meditated
[1:45:21] around the tree he was looking at the
[1:45:23] eagle and he begin thinking about God
[1:45:25] and hearing iot and everything his mind
[1:45:28] was on God by just his meditation got it
[1:45:32] hallelujah praise be to God cuz when you
[1:45:35] going to sit there and you think about
[1:45:37] David you think about Samson you think
[1:45:40] about Samson oh meditate oh Samson was a
[1:45:43] oneman army they didn't need a 10,000
