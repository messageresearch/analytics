[36:00] will have but this is just been kind of
[36:02] a kind of different I really appreciate

[36:09] amen if you
[36:10] will turn your
[36:13] Bibles and we'll go to the book of
[36:15] Hebrews I believe we'll start with I
[36:17] don't think that it's going to be a long
[36:19] message but amen cuz I don't have a
[36:21] whole lot wrote down or even quotes and
[36:23] so forth but amen you know the Holy
[36:26] Spirit takes over you never know what
[36:28] might
[36:30] happen in Hebrews
[36:33] 11 Hebrews
[36:35] 11 amen I'm going to read this scripture
[36:39] because I want to go through another
[36:41] scripture and take a little more time
[36:43] Amen in reading it and and and
[36:46] commenting on it so we'll just read the
[36:48] Short scripture so to speak amen for our
[36:51] thought Hebrews 11 and verse 5 by faith
[36:55] Enoch was translated that
[36:58] he and was not found because God had
[37:01] translated him for before his
[37:04] translation he had this testimony that
[37:07] he pleased God but without faith it is
[37:09] impossible to please him for he that
[37:11] cometh to God must believe that he is
[37:13] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[37:15] diligently seek Him
[37:17] amen may God add His blessings to the
[37:19] reading word you can be
[37:22] seated amen I want to start first of all
[37:25] by saying and I and I was listening to
[37:28] brother brandham and his amen message
[37:30] called looking to De unene and he makes
[37:33] a comment of people
[37:35] [Music]
[37:37] who
[37:39] live like talking about aren't too
[37:42] effective Amen in the kingdom of God
[37:45] amen amen it's the people that live by
[37:47] faith amen people who are constantly
[37:51] looking to the
[37:54] Unseen ain't that right that a whole lot
[37:57] more effective amen and and more
[37:59] productive in the kingdom of God and and
[38:02] I know I preached on that about a week
[38:03] or two ago talking about looking to the
[38:05] Unseen and how that
[38:08] amen whether it's salvation or even God
[38:11] or the Holy Spirit and everything about
[38:13] us amen we uh I think it was Paul that
[38:15] said you know the things that are seen
[38:17] are temporal isn't that right but the
[38:19] things that are not seen are Eternal so
[38:22] it's quite something for a Believer how
[38:25] it it all it's all in the Unseen realm
[38:28] amen all of your weaponry and all of
[38:31] your everything it's in it's in it's by
[38:33] faith amen we see that how the Hebrews
[38:36] 11 talked about by faith God did this
[38:38] and by faith Noah by faith and Moses by
[38:41] faith all these people you know all the
[38:43] great people that ever amounted anything
[38:44] were people that had faith in God Amen
[38:48] and look to the Unseen you and I are
[38:50] looking to the Unseen isn't that right
[38:53] amen and I got to thinking about uh hope
[38:55] that is seen I think and I wish that I
[38:58] maybe re refresh myself on this
[39:01] but Paul said something about hope that
[39:04] is seen is no longer hope for why do you
[39:07] hope for something that you see is that
[39:09] right you know so we're believing and it
[39:12] also talks about the Bible that he says
[39:14] which which hope we have as an anchor of
[39:17] the Soul amen the hope that's before us
[39:20] that's set before us that's what our
[39:22] anchor is as
[39:24] we look to the F still believe leaving
[39:26] for it
[39:28] a that right something that
[39:31] we're looking
[39:34] forward healing or salvation or
[39:36] Deliverance or whatever it might be or
[39:38] the Rapture or or especially amen
[39:43] heaven and for the things that's
[39:46] coming amen that's what we focus on Amen
[39:51] so I want to turn back now and and go
[39:55] with the help of the Lord here in
[39:57] Matthew I going to go to Matthew and
[39:59] begin to read a scripture that kind of
[40:01] wanted to lay a foundation here uh on uh
[40:06] what I want to speak on tonight amen and
[40:09] and I think maybe
[40:12] we'll title is Enoch's walk amen Enoch's
[40:15] walk would that be okay walking like
[40:17] Enoch
[40:19] walked amen CU how many knows Enoch had
[40:23] a
[40:24] translation Enoch had a translation
[40:27] how many knows that we're looking for a
[40:29] translation outside of that translation
[40:32] there there is no other hope the only
[40:34] hope you and I have is that translation
[40:37] how manyan believe it's important that
[40:38] we make that
[40:42] translation CU how many would would uh
[40:45] bear record with me we're believing that
[40:47] we could go by the Grave by before
[40:49] morning but if we live our lives out
[40:51] we're going to see amen that
[40:54] Rapture I'm believing that that you and
[40:57] I are going to see the
[40:59] Rapture
[41:01] amen how many think while brother I B I
[41:03] think it might be wrong well you might
[41:06] think that but even brother Brandon
[41:07] believed that he
[41:09] would even he believed that he would not
[41:11] die of old age until he seen the coming
[41:13] of the Lord they'd be over 100 so amen
[41:17] if he don't come for another 50 years
[41:19] and I'm long gone I'm still believing
[41:21] that we're going to see his coming amen
[41:24] amen and we're fixing to read how he
[41:26] talks about the Fig Tree when he puts
[41:28] forth his Bud amen and so forth he says
[41:31] that generation would not pass away
[41:33] until all the things will be
[41:36] fulfilled which is what I want to read
[41:39] um and I wanted to share first of all if
[41:41] I if I may I want to share with you
[41:43] perhaps just kind of how I come about
[41:45] this message amen and and and it it was
[41:48] while I was driving down the road how
[41:50] many's ever just going down driving down
[41:53] the road and you you think about the
[41:55] Lord amen and the Lord just kind of
[41:58] gives you things you know and I was
[42:00] coming off of Green Ridge Spar Road and
[42:02] I begin to think about the Lord and I
[42:04] got to thinking about what the prophet
[42:06] of God said about how that uh you know
[42:08] that everything that Adam lost we have
[42:12] been restored back
[42:15] to amen the fellowship that Adam had
[42:19] with God Amen we've been restored to
[42:22] that fellowship with God and I and I was
[42:24] down D down Road at
[42:26] Lord if that's the truth why don't I why
[42:30] don't I fellowship with you
[42:32] more
[42:36] right why don't we why don't we why
[42:39] can't you drive down the road why don't
[42:40] we talk to him more on a daily basis
[42:43] wherever you are I mean we've been
[42:45] restored back to talk been able to talk
[42:48] we're on talking terms with
[42:51] God how many believe
[42:54] that then I was driving I
[42:56] okay because you know I we pray in the
[42:58] morning right we talk to the Lord and we
[43:01] pray maybe at night and we think about
[43:02] him something but a lot of time we don't
[43:04] think a whole lot about him we very
[43:06] rarely probably a lot of times just
[43:07] start talking to
[43:11] him how many least we ought to we ought
[43:13] to talk to him more and I thought what
[43:16] in the world if this is true and we
[43:19] actually have an open Channel why don't
[43:21] I hear God talk more brother John why
[43:24] don't I hear his voice more than what
[43:29] do I'm telling you how I come to this
[43:31] message all right just come about and I
[43:34] just got to think of my Lord wow and I
[43:37] was reading even brother bam he was says
[43:39] man look at all the all in one place in
[43:41] quot he says why are we are why are we
[43:43] like we are if this all is is true why
[43:46] is the CH church still not where it
[43:48] ought to be
[43:49] amen but let me not go down that road
[43:52] talking about you know the Lord and and
[43:54] I begin to talk to the Lord he begin to
[43:56] talk back and before I knew
[43:59] it amen he was talking to me and he was
[44:02] telling me all kinds of things of the
[44:04] scripture and and some of the things
[44:06] I'll bring tonight and and bringing
[44:07] these things out and and
[44:11] and and uh in the middle of it all
[44:14] better B I say well I'm thank you Lord I
[44:18] I know that's you talking to me I know
[44:21] that you talking to me because you're
[44:22] telling me
[44:24] scriptures amen you're telling me this
[44:26] that or the other and and you're showing
[44:29] me amen one of the first things one of
[44:31] the first thoughts come uh to my mind
[44:33] was you know it's because that you've
[44:36] got too much static in your life yeah
[44:42] exactly and how many knows it'll be that
[44:45] still Small Voice that talks to
[44:47] [Applause]
[44:53] you wish I could remember the message I
[44:56] heard this week but brother B talked
[44:57] about we think man we don't have a
[44:59] church service unless we're screaming
[45:00] and hollering all of these other he said
[45:02] you know we've had that but where's God
[45:04] at Where's God at Where's God at Where's
[45:06] God at we've had tongues this out other
[45:08] Where's God at he says what we need is
[45:10] that still Small Voice he emphasized
[45:13] greatly that we need to hear we need to
[45:15] get back in the cave and hear that still
[45:16] Small
[45:18] Voice so when I begin to listen you know
[45:21] I Here I Am Lord talk and before I knew
[45:23] it I just you know I thought you know
[45:26] well now we pray and ask God for Stuff
[45:29] most of the time but here he was telling
[45:32] me this stuff and I'm says I Lord I know
[45:33] that's you thank you thank you for
[45:36] fellowshipping with me how glad that you
[45:38] can get the fellowship with Jesus Christ
[45:41] on a daily basis if you'll just make
[45:43] sure that this add it's one of the thing
[45:45] first things that have thought about was
[45:47] you know it's like a channel on the
[45:48] radio
[45:54] and
[45:58] did you ever hear static in between
[46:00] channels on the radio right all kinds of
[46:03] weird
[46:04] sounds but when you get that tuned in
[46:08] it's
[46:08] clear I am the Lord that speaks to you
[46:13] huh I am the holy spirit all of a sudden
[46:16] it become clear not a bunch of RI Raff
[46:18] and a bunch of
[46:19] [Music]
[46:20] chatter tonight we want to look at some
[46:22] of that chatter in our lives would that
[46:25] be okay some of those things that are
[46:28] really
[46:30] insignificant the most important thing
[46:32] is that you have fellowship with God
[46:34] Amen that we have Fellowship that we
[46:37] speak with him on a daily basis
[46:42] everywhere so listen closely amen I
[46:45] believe this can change your
[46:48] life
[46:50] amen
[46:52] amen first of all I want to talk about
[46:55] the coming of of the
[46:56] Lord amen the coming of the
[47:00] Lord didn't butam said he said that uh
[47:03] we need to check up every hour every
[47:05] minute of every day there's no hope
[47:08] outside of the translation so I want to
[47:10] bring this because this is our Focus
[47:12] Point our focus is on the coming of the
[47:15] Lord to be ready and to walk like Enoch
[47:19] walked to be Rapture Ready how many want
[47:22] to be ready for the
[47:24] rapture
[47:28] in in you know in the thought I thought
[47:31] you know there's going to be a lot of
[47:32] people oh boy here we
[47:34] go there'll
[47:39] be people hello I knew the Rapture was
[47:42] coming but I just
[47:48] didn't there be a lot of people that I
[47:50] know that it's already passed I missed
[47:53] it I wasn't ready
[47:57] be a lot of people like
[48:00] that
[48:03] amen you know I thought there was
[48:05] supposed to be a Rapture take place and
[48:07] something will tell them it's already
[48:09] happened and you didn't know it you
[48:19] wasn't now learn of Parables chapter 24
[48:22] of Matthew verse 32 now learned of
[48:25] parable
[48:26] of the fake tree when his branch is yet
[48:28] tender and putteth forth leaves ye know
[48:30] that summer is nigh so likewise ye when
[48:33] you shall see these things know that it
[48:35] is near even at the doors amen how many
[48:40] knows who the Fig Tree is Israel right
[48:43] when it puts forth his brother what
[48:45] about God teaches when they become a
[48:49] nation when they become a nation listen
[48:52] to what it says here verily I say unto
[48:56] you this generation shall not pass till
[48:59] all these things be
[49:01] fulfilled we as message Believers know
[49:04] that brother bam talked about the
[49:06] generation that sees the
[49:11] is came a
[49:14] nation there's a lot of interpretation
[49:16] to this because you know uh if you just
[49:20] took a baby that was born well they
[49:23] would never know that and it became a
[49:24] nation that's right child would have to
[49:28] be of understanding to know that it was
[49:30] even a nation so it could be the people
[49:33] that knew but if you just took it from a
[49:36] b the baby that was born in 1947 today I
[49:40] believe would be 77 years
[49:44] old amen so look at how late it is the
[49:49] bible promises you he listen these
[49:52] things be fulfilled all these things be
[49:53] fulfilled Jesus said Heaven and Earth
[49:56] shall pass away but my word shall not
[49:58] pass away not that we doubt God's word
[50:01] anyway but he was saying Heaven and
[50:03] Earth will pass away but you can count
[50:04] on this so we know that we don't have
[50:08] long left on the face of the
[50:10] Earth 20 years these folks would be uh
[50:13] what 707 87 97 years old amen most of
[50:18] them would have
[50:19] gone so we can pretty much if we was to
[50:22] predict we would predict that within 20
[50:24] years or 20 five years at the most it's
[50:27] going to be
[50:29] done amen I say that because for anybody
[50:34] don't have their perspectives right you
[50:35] need to get your perspectives right you
[50:38] need to get your focus right you need to
[50:40] get your faith right realizing we're
[50:43] going to be in the Millennium we're
[50:44] going to be in heaven we're going to be
[50:45] up there when the tribulation period
[50:48] happens what what lays ahead for us is
[50:51] inconceivably awesome
[50:53] amen and people oh my how the devil can
[50:56] distract us
[51:00] amen amen and tying it in remember we're
[51:03] talking about the coming of the Lord
[51:05] we're talking about walking the walk
[51:07] that's going to get you through amen you
[51:10] care most people don't care but the
[51:12] bride's going to
[51:14] Care people that are going are going to
[51:17] care one of the things I want to say
[51:20] tonight is we're not here to talk about
[51:22] your good points and how good we are how
[51:24] elected we are this that or the other
[51:27] but AB Braham says man if you don't come
[51:28] together Amen to find your bad places
[51:31] then you ain't coming together for the
[51:33] right
[51:35] reason is that what he said to find your
[51:39] bad spots for we we not what we ought to
[51:43] be amen
[51:48] whoa am man you're going to be a
[51:50] little Heaven and Earth will pass away
[51:53] but my word shall never but of the day
[51:55] or the hour knoweth no man know not the
[51:57] angels of heaven but my father only how
[51:59] many knows in the seven seal but BR
[52:01] talked about what he didn't know about
[52:03] that seven seal and what it pointed to
[52:05] was nobody knows his day nor the hour of
[52:07] his coming somebody knows that when he
[52:10] does come to the whole world to most
[52:13] people it's going to be a
[52:16] surprise but I want to declare to you
[52:18] that it will not be a surprise to those
[52:20] who are waiting and
[52:22] watching they will not be a surprise if
[52:24] it's be a surprise to you amen then
[52:29] you're going to be in
[52:32] trouble can I say
[52:35] something you know he's gonna come as a
[52:37] thief in the night
[52:39] right I would dare say that the surprise
[52:42] is going to be I know that it's over
[52:45] with
[52:46] already and I was
[52:49] left huh that's going to be
[52:52] the surprise because people are not
[52:54] going to know when happens un Believers
[52:56] are not going to know when it happens
[52:59] amen except for except for
[53:03] those for the husband or the wife that
[53:07] is in bed and their mate is
[53:11] gone they're going to know there was
[53:14] nobody in kidnapped my wife there ain't
[53:16] nobody in here kidnapp my wife my
[53:19] husband huh but he's not in the bed this
[53:24] morning
[53:26] he's
[53:28] gone and somebody's heart's going to get
[53:31] grip fear is going to come in like you
[53:33] ain't never thought
[53:38] amen I think that's going to be more
[53:41] more distinctive in being able to
[53:44] identify the Rapture than two in the
[53:46] field well maybe he went to us the
[53:49] restroom and he just left he's just gone
[53:53] huh two working in the field while he
[53:55] may may come up missing somehow but
[53:57] unless you just vanishes right there you
[53:58] watch him vanish is that
[54:02] right Bible talks about people's hearts
[54:05] are going to
[54:07] melt over in Isaiah read that talking
[54:09] about people's hearts are going to melt
[54:11] when they realize they're left in the
[54:13] tribulation
[54:17] period amen day and the hour knoweth no
[54:21] man but as the days of Noah were amen so
[54:24] shall also of the coming of the son of
[54:26] man be amen Before the Flood they were
[54:30] eating and drinking and marrying and
[54:31] giving in marriage until that Noah
[54:33] entered into the ark they knew not until
[54:36] the flood came and took them all away
[54:39] amen what was it nine 10 11 days at the
[54:43] ark the door was shut or something like
[54:45] that few days it was already shut no
[54:49] rain no nothing but all of a sudden it
[54:51] begin to thunder amen when that flood
[54:54] came came they all knew when that
[54:57] tribulation period comes they all knew
[55:01] amen let me tell you something don't
[55:03] build your hopes on this world don't
[55:06] build your hopes on financial status
[55:09] this nation is busted as can be 30 some
[55:11] trillion dollars it's done it's over
[55:15] with you'll have wheelbarrows full of
[55:17] money won't mean
[55:19] nothing so you better get your
[55:21] priorities right if you're believer get
[55:25] your priorities
[55:26] right
[55:28] amen then shall two be in the field the
[55:31] one shall be taken and the other one
[55:33] left two women shall be grinding at the
[55:34] Mill the one shall be taken the other
[55:36] one left
[55:39] amen amen watch therefore for you know
[55:42] not the hour that your lord does come
[55:45] but know this that if the good man of
[55:47] the house would have known what watch
[55:48] you would have come he would have
[55:50] watched and would not have suffered his
[55:52] house to be broken up he would not have
[55:59] how many's with me Lord don't let me be
[56:03] disappointed I don't care what you got
[56:05] to do Lord I don't don't let me be
[56:10] disappointed don't let me deceive
[56:13] myself

[56:18] be notice this therefore be ye also
[56:21] ready Jesus said for in such an hour as
[56:24] you think not the son of man
[56:28] cometh we can definitely say he could
[56:31] come just any time just any moment now
[56:35] he could come why because he said know
[56:37] this that when Israel when that happens

[57:10] due season blessed is that servant whom
[57:13] his Lord when he cometh shall find so
[57:16] doing amen barely I say unto you that he
[57:19] shall make him ruler over all of his
[57:21] Goods but if that evil servant shall
[57:24] become

[1:02:48] heart praising God and having favor with
[1:02:50] all the people and the Lord added to the
[1:02:53] church daily such as should be
[1:02:56] saved brother banam in in in trying to
[1:03:00] uh uh prove that Israel was a a not a
[1:03:04] denomination but that he they would go
[1:03:06] from here to there and so forth and go
[1:03:09] from one place to the other and mean he
[1:03:11] was typ kind
[1:03:14] of typing it with the Nations they were
[1:03:18] wers and Tents and alleys down in the
[1:03:21] street corners the little Mission maybe
[1:03:23] they get behind on the rent they get
[1:03:25] kicked out he says God's wanting them to
[1:03:27] go somewhere else over in Jamaica not
[1:03:30] long ago there was a fine Pentecostal
[1:03:32] doctor Divinity standing there Divinity
[1:03:34] standing there and I says oh how the
[1:03:37] Lord blessed your early Pentecostal
[1:03:39] Church they had nothing and I said they
[1:03:42] were just War wonderers about he says Ah
[1:03:46] brother Brandon I said yes brother oh my
[1:03:49] f f brother he said I was just wanting
[1:03:51] to show you where you're I just want to
[1:03:53] show you where you're wrong and I said
[1:03:54] oh I'm so glad of that I always want to
[1:03:57] know where I'm
[1:03:59] wrong isn't that the right attitude when
[1:04:01] somebody tells I can show you where
[1:04:03] you're wrong most of us want to get
[1:04:08] offended tell me I'm wrong blow up like
[1:04:12] a buckshot toad frog eating Buckshot no
[1:04:15] please please tell
[1:04:18] me where I'm wrong I mean CU if you're
[1:04:21] not wrong you ain't got nothing to worry
[1:04:23] about if you're wrong then you need to
[1:04:24] anyway we should always always be
[1:04:26] willing to take correction I like his
[1:04:29] attitude I always want to know where I'm
[1:04:31] wrong cuz God knows I don't want to be
[1:04:32] wrong I said well if I'm wrong I sure
[1:04:34] want to know it brother thank you he
[1:04:35] said you keep praising those Pentecostal
[1:04:38] people I said yep he says they made the
[1:04:41] terriblest mistake that they ever made
[1:04:43] when they sold their property when the
[1:04:47] persecution arose they
[1:04:49] didn't even have a home to go to under
[1:04:52] the bow
[1:04:55] now one of the things that the Lord
[1:04:56] spoke to me in that car was he says you
[1:04:58] know remember what I said about uh
[1:05:01] brother prophet of God said the word of
[1:05:03] God said that you know we're always
[1:05:05] wanting to
[1:05:07] prosper and and over Sean says I would
[1:05:10] that you prosper and that you be in
[1:05:15] health that's right when I think of all
[1:05:18] the jobs that I've got that the house
[1:05:19] lined up I got enough to last me years
[1:05:22] people ask me if do you have job yeah I
[1:05:25] got more job I care to do
[1:05:27] with huh that's right this I got more
[1:05:31] stuff than I got the store huh I got
[1:05:35] Craftsman tools and today I was standing
[1:05:38] there and I had to pick all the
[1:05:39] different tools and try to put them all
[1:05:40] back in place take a half a day to put
[1:05:42] arrange stuff you know and Lord was show
[1:05:45] me look what they did you know we're
[1:05:46] always trying to get more that's right
[1:05:49] we're always busy trying to buy more buy
[1:05:52] this buy that buy byy byy
[1:05:55] but the early Pentecostal they didn't
[1:05:57] see how much they could buy they see how
[1:05:58] much they could
[1:05:59] sell I thought that's right that's right
[1:06:02] Lord maybe if I think about selling
[1:06:05] stuff instead of buying too much
[1:06:08] thinking about my next project I'm going
[1:06:09] do maybe I listen a little more maybe
[1:06:12] I'd be more
[1:06:22] spiritual well
[1:06:24] oh my you know well let me just read on
[1:06:27] that' be
[1:06:29] okay now notice the ter he said the
[1:06:32] terriblest mistake they ever made with
[1:06:34] selling their property one the
[1:06:35] persecution wrote they didn't never go
[1:06:37] home to go
[1:06:39] to they didn't have whole place to go
[1:06:42] and they just wandered
[1:06:44] about and I said that's exactly the will
[1:06:47] of God and he said
[1:06:50] why I said if dat had a home to go to
[1:06:52] dat went back
[1:06:54] huh probably settled down and said well
[1:06:57] I don't know about this I think I'll
[1:06:59] just get me a home job and forget church
[1:07:04] and everything else when because Bible
[1:07:06] says you know persecution some of them
[1:07:08] fall by the wayside huh but they had to
[1:07:12] go from here to there Spreading the News
[1:07:15] everywhere that the Holy Ghost had come
[1:07:17] how many know in that early Pentecostal
[1:07:19] church amen salvation the baptism of the
[1:07:22] Holy Ghost amen for
[1:07:25] of your sins getting baptized in the
[1:07:27] name of Jesus Christ that was F first
[1:07:30] and foremost in their life more than
[1:07:32] anything else any worldly
[1:07:35] possessions God was first in that church
[1:07:38] it didn't matter if they had to sell
[1:07:43] everything they were willing to sell
[1:07:45] everything they had no hold on this
[1:07:48] Earth our Earthly
[1:07:51] possessions we've got the Earthly
[1:07:52] possessions so we don't want what to do
[1:07:55] with but where are you
[1:07:57] spiritually what kind of person are you
[1:08:01] spiritually let me tell you something
[1:08:03] when your Earthly possessions take you
[1:08:04] out of church and keep you from God you
[1:08:06] better go to selling some stuff you
[1:08:09] better get in rid of some time you
[1:08:10] better make some time for
[1:08:12] God boy I had some crazy thoughts coming
[1:08:15] into my head amen when the Rapture comes
[1:08:17] when Jesus comes back people say no
[1:08:19] Jesus I'm having a pretty good time here
[1:08:21] can you come back
[1:08:22] later
[1:08:24] I'm doing really good here I'm too busy
[1:08:26] for you to
[1:08:29] come if you're too busy for to come to
[1:08:32] church you'll probably be too busy for
[1:08:33] the
[1:08:34] [Applause]
[1:08:39] Rapture that ain't nothing but the
[1:08:42] truth amen cuz God's not coming for a
[1:08:45] backlit person he's coming for somebody
[1:08:47] that's right there tuned in and ready to
[1:08:52] go
[1:08:55] can you come back later cuz I'm just too
[1:08:56] busy cuz a lot of time we're just too
[1:08:59] busy for God we ain't got time to listen
[1:09:02] to that Still's moist telling
[1:09:05] us I'm convinced that the church is to
[1:09:07] be led by the Holy Ghost but the people
[1:09:11] have to be able to hear the voice of the
[1:09:12] Holy Ghost they ever clean their lives
[1:09:14] up ever get rid of the sin static that's
[1:09:16] all up in their lives starting with the
[1:09:18] busyness that we are how busy we are
[1:09:22] that's the devil's trap it's to get it
[1:09:24] so busy we ain't got time to pray we
[1:09:25] ain't got time to
[1:09:29] listen oh brother Russell when I thought
[1:09:31] about that and I still begin to talk to
[1:09:33] God God begin to talk back to me I said
[1:09:35] God is more willing he's more wanting to
[1:09:37] talk to you than you ever even give him
[1:09:40] time for he wants to talk to you he
[1:09:45] wants Fellowship why did he die calary
[1:09:48] for so that you could have fellowship
[1:09:51] with him so you could talk to him
[1:09:57] but you got to remember when you go to
[1:09:59] talk to
[1:10:01] him he loves
[1:10:03] you and he's going to rebuke you as many
[1:10:07] as I love I
[1:10:10] rebuke Jason be
[1:10:13] zealous be zealous out there be
[1:10:18] zealous folks I know we have like
[1:10:20] brother Bram says we have our condoles I
[1:10:23] believe is people that can't come to
[1:10:25] church our elderly and so forth that
[1:10:27] can't come to church sick that can't
[1:10:28] come to church this that or the other I
[1:10:31] understand all that but when you're
[1:10:32] perfectly healthy and wealthy and wise
[1:10:33] and you don't come to church you're back
[1:10:38] slid you're seriously
[1:10:41] backslid brother B says man if you can't
[1:10:43] wait if the Holy Ghost ain't so much in
[1:10:45] you preach it brother Luke Gibson amen
[1:10:47] Faith goes to church if you got the love
[1:10:49] of God in your heart you can't wait for
[1:10:51] them doors to open come in amongst there
[1:10:53] fellowship with your brothers and if you
[1:10:55] don't brother B it's time you go to
[1:11:00] praying better get to
[1:11:07] repenting better go to repenting if you
[1:11:10] don't love church hate to miss
[1:11:15] church that's
[1:11:19] right my
[1:11:21] my praise the Lord you ready for a real
[1:11:25] shocker you want Pentecost here we go
[1:11:29] they didn't have a go to him to go back
[1:11:32] to but they had to go from here to there
[1:11:34] Spreading the News everywhere that the
[1:11:36] Holy Ghost had come don't tell me that
[1:11:38] God makes a mistake he never makes a
[1:11:40] mistake he knows what just how to do
[1:11:42] they sold their properties and become
[1:11:49] vagabonds
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:52] woo what
[1:11:54] them Pentecostals become
[1:12:00] vabs remember one time brother bandam
[1:12:02] tell him his life story he was talking
[1:12:04] about a home he says Brams don't have
[1:12:06] homes Brams are
[1:12:09] vagabonds
[1:12:11] poor
[1:12:16] huh it's his quote how many believe it's
[1:12:19] a part that we need to hear
[1:12:22] sometime sold their property became
[1:12:26] Wanderers bombs so to speak even Jesus
[1:12:30] didn't have a place to lay his head the
[1:12:32] master our Lord and Master didn't have a
[1:12:35] place to lay his head he had no earthly
[1:12:41] possessions here we are filthy rich and
[1:12:44] we have a hard time being a Christian we
[1:12:47] don't really even have persecution like
[1:12:49] we ought to have we cry and whine
[1:12:51] because this breaks down or that breaks
[1:12:53] break down what in know world is wrong
[1:12:55] with you be glad you got something that
[1:12:56] breaks
[1:13:00] down they didn't have nothing they
[1:13:03] wonder where they were going to sleep
[1:13:05] next time they wonder what they meal
[1:13:06] they were going to eat and it was
[1:13:10] perfectly the will of
[1:13:13] God well brother B are you saying that
[1:13:15] we ought to go sell everything that we
[1:13:16] have this outa no I'm
[1:13:19] not but I am saying this it'll come to
[1:13:23] that place if they maybe even close this
[1:13:25] place up it could come back to where
[1:13:26] we'll have all things in
[1:13:28] common huh that's right you can't be
[1:13:31] there hid away with your big old freezer
[1:13:33] full of food and everybody else is
[1:13:34] hungry and you're going to save it your
[1:13:36] yourself now you better open that thing
[1:13:37] up and tell feed everybody in the church
[1:13:39] that needs to be
[1:13:41] hungry it may come to that we may come
[1:13:44] to that yet amen we don't do stuff just
[1:13:47] on our own we keep going like we are
[1:13:49] until God changes things but you better
[1:13:52] be willing is what I'm sing I say
[1:13:53] tonight you better be
[1:13:55] willing to put God first above your
[1:13:57] finances and everything that you have
[1:14:00] God is
[1:14:02] first if he ain't you ain't where you
[1:14:05] ought to be don't you never think that
[1:14:08] because you a Prosperity but B says
[1:14:10] Prosperity isn't always a sign of God's
[1:14:12] blessing if that's a that's a case
[1:14:14] Arnold Schwarz ner amen Nancy Pelos you
[1:14:17] president uh not president but uh Trump
[1:14:21] and everybody all of those billionaires
[1:14:23] would put you to shame that's right
[1:14:26] they're more blessed than you can ever
[1:14:28] imagine those folks have more money day
[1:14:31] will know what to spend it
[1:14:35] on you know what he said to don't go by
[1:14:39] that blessing is when God forgives you
[1:14:42] of your sin fills you with the Holy
[1:14:44] Ghost and gives you peace you may be
[1:14:47] under a tree somewhere you may be under
[1:14:48] a bridge somewhere you may be wherever
[1:14:50] but you got peace of mind you may be
[1:14:53] like Paul a prisoner with change on your
[1:14:55] legs and be a prisoner but you got joy
[1:14:58] unspeakable full of God you're the
[1:15:00] richest man alive you got God and you're
[1:15:02] a Son of God that means more than
[1:15:05] anything to a real Christian back to
[1:15:08] real
[1:15:12] Pentecost where the holy ghost means
[1:15:14] more than
[1:15:16] anything listening to God's voice and
[1:15:18] following his voice means
[1:15:22] everything
[1:15:24] oh my think about it anytime you do
[1:15:27] something you to do you're not listening
[1:15:29] to the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost
[1:15:32] will tell you just right quick what to
[1:15:34] do and what not to do you ain't got to
[1:15:36] come to church to hear it you can hear
[1:15:39] his voice like I hear his voice driving
[1:15:41] down the road or wherever it is if
[1:15:42] you'll just open it up say Lord what do
[1:15:44] you want to say to
[1:15:46] me it's funny but I said
[1:15:48] Lord you can talk I know you can I don't
[1:15:52] talk to enough to you so Here I Am Lord

[1:16:07] could just shut up let him
[1:16:09] talk it's amazing what he'll tell you
[1:16:13] he's more willing to fellowship with us
[1:16:15] than we are willing to fellowship with
[1:16:16] him are you with me I know that's the
[1:16:19] second or third time I've said it but I
[1:16:21] think it need said don't you brother
[1:16:22] Glenn he wants to fellowship with you
[1:16:26] when he tells you something there ain't
[1:16:27] nobody ever talk you out of it or change
[1:16:30] your mind about
[1:16:31] it I'm going to tell you this the most
[1:16:34] precious thing that you'll ever have in
[1:16:36] your life is what Revelation when God
[1:16:38] reveals himself or when he speaks to you
[1:16:40] amen makes himself known to
[1:16:43] you it's good it's
[1:16:47] precious I said vagabonds my goodness I
[1:16:51] don't want to be a yeah I do that's what
[1:16:53] it takes if they were vagabonds I'll be

[1:17:45] said the people sold what they had and
[1:17:48] become
[1:17:50] popers in order to take the gospel and I
[1:17:52] said nowadays they try to tell these
[1:17:55] businessmen they got business and they
[1:17:56] know what to do that ain't what they're
[1:17:59] after let them know about the love of
[1:18:00] God that's what they're trying to
[1:18:07] find not long having a business this

[1:18:47] off if we didn't have so
[1:18:50] much can I say it as your pastor it's a
[1:18:53] little tough but maybe we need to get on

[1:20:00] stuff too many
[1:20:03] cares I think I got another quote for
[1:20:10] you
[1:20:17] amen what is sweeter than fellowship
[1:20:20] with him my heart's desires Lord help me
[1:20:23] to hear your voice
[1:20:26] more talk to me more
[1:20:29] Lord and it's not
[1:20:32] him it's not his fault that you're not
[1:20:35] hearing he wants to talk to you how many
[1:20:38] beli that he wants to talk to every one
[1:20:40] of us he wants to have a greater
[1:20:42] fellowship with each and every one of us
[1:20:45] but you got to get rid of the STA you
[1:20:47] got to get rid of the things that are
[1:20:49] keeping you from hearing his
[1:20:51] voice could be setting sin could be the
[1:20:54] cares of life could be the deceitfulness
[1:20:56] of
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:58] riches let's remember Jesus said it's
[1:21:00] easier for a camel to go through the eye
[1:21:02] of an needle than for a rich man to CER
[1:21:05] it in heaven right why because a rich
[1:21:09] man most of the time loves his
[1:21:16] riches that's right Peter say then how
[1:21:19] can anybody be
[1:21:20] saved even Jesus said with man it's
[1:21:23] impossible but With God all things are
[1:21:25] possible aren't you
[1:21:28] glad
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:31] amen so listen when the man fell when
[1:21:35] Adam fell he lost this fellowship with
[1:21:38] God that whatever he would ask it would
[1:21:41] happen everything obeyed him because he
[1:21:44] was God's child and the child is of all
[1:21:47] things isn't that right how many know
[1:21:50] when Adam before he fell he could say
[1:21:52] Amen tree be plucked up and go over to
[1:21:55] here he could say Mountain I don't like
[1:21:58] where you are I want you out there in
[1:22:00] the
[1:22:05] ocean everything would Obe
[1:22:07] him but after the F he lost all of that
[1:22:11] he lost his power he had condemnation in
[1:22:13] his
[1:22:14] heart but the Bible says the sack and
[1:22:17] Adam restored us back and give us
[1:22:19] everything that Adam lost Jesus said if
[1:22:22] you to this mountain be plugged up and
[1:22:24] cast into the sea it will obey
[1:22:27] you where are the sons and daughters of
[1:22:30] God we're being drowned and
[1:22:34] barous and cares of the
[1:22:38] world we ain't got that power we don't
[1:22:40] have the
[1:22:42] power because our cares are on the wrong
[1:22:45] thing I hope that's okay to say I just
[1:22:47] feel led of the spirit to say it that's
[1:22:50] where your power lays and your dead
[1:22:52] dedication to
[1:22:54] [Music]

[1:24:21] the fall now the thing of it is since he
[1:24:24] has restored man back to this place man
