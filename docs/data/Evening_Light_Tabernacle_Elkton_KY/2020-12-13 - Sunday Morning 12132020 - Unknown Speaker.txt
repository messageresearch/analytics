world heareth them be loved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god and this was manifested love of god toward us because that god sent his

see each and everyone here and we thought there was many that would probably be out and i look around there's a few missing this morning but it's good to see each and every one here this morning and i just i think of that song when i think of the goodness of jesus and all he's done for me there's just something in my heart and i took a little trip to nashville yesterday to look at something and uh i was going down the road and i told jan i said you know when you drive by yourself and i didn't know exactly where i was going so i was using my maps i said it's quiet and every once in a while they kept reassuring me because they'd rerouted me because of a wreck i was going the right direction i began to think of the goodness of the lord all that he had done for me i said lord you've been so good to me and you know a lot of times people think when you say the lord's been good well he's give you a lot of money no you know what he gave me he gave me everlasting life he loved me so much brother brad he thought of me before the foundation of the world me did i deserve it nope but you say are you glad oh yes i'm glad i'm very glad and i i just this song we're going to sing i'm going through and my wife i'll probably drive her crazy because i get in the rut when i hear certain songs that i like to hear i play them first thing in the morning last thing before i go to bed i have to have my favorite song i'm like a child with a safety blanket i hear that song and there's a song that we sang into the course every once in a while oh say but i'm glad but i'm glad that he's done for me in my life what he has and i'm so thankful this morning and my heart's desire this morning as i'm going through let's sing that song sister becky i pray that's your heart's desire this morning amen brother joe it's good to see you this morning brother oh i texted him and he told me about his toe and i said well i hope brother chris don't step on your toes this morning it might be painful for brother joe this morning we're praying for him this morning that the lord will help him this morning and take that affection away and you know we need one another more than ever before to pray one for another in church i'm going to tell you somebody comes on your heart you better pray for them because that ain't just your little mind thinking of it it's god wanting you to speak pray for your brother because you don't know where your brother and sister is going or what they're going through but one thing we have desire this morning every one of you is that we want to go through and spend eternity together that's my heart's desire i mean i i didn't even i wasn't a big obama fan but i said if he's one of yours lord i'll spend eternity with him but i want us all to make it home together don't you i'm going through this morning amen well lord i have started to walk in the light just hang up on me from heaven so bright and i paid the work and it's finally i started with jesus and i'm going through oh i'm going through yes i'm going through and i'll pay the price whatever others do and i'll take the way with the lord's despised you well i started with jesus and i'm going [Applause] [Music] and others accept it because it is news but not very many expect to go through oh going through yes i'm going through and i'll pay the price whatever others do and i'll take the weight and i've started with jesus and i'm going through well i'd rather walk alone and have for a parallel like jacob's stones living each moment with his face and you then shrink put my pathway and fail to go through oh i'm going through yes i'm going through and i'll pay the price whatever others do and i'll take the way with the lord's despised did with jesus and i'm going through and oh brother now will you take up the cross give up the world and count it as frost sail all thou hast and give to the poor and go through with jesus and those who enter oh i'm going through yes i'm going through i need

gates of glory cause the heart will never break anymore i've never met one man [Music] without i've never looked into eyes with no pain [Applause] but i know a land where grief is a stranger [Music] and joy is the only song that we will see and tears will never stain the streets of that city no reach of death on my mansion and teardrop's heart will come beyond the gates of glory cause the heart will never break anymore and that sounds like home to me like [Music] to fill our eyes again the heels will echo with the story as we sing of his grace and his glory where the saints of god will be oh

glorious message that we have this last day that his bride just has a light a lamp into their feet collided to the path this morning not just the word of god but a prophet that was vindicated that came to reveal the word this morning get out of your bed this morning you're not just going to another denomination but you're coming to church just wanted to hear from god this morning now you just didn't just get up just because but you got up to hear from jesus christ this morning we were driving and we were just traveling i was praying i was seeking the lord i said lord last night stayed up really late i said lord i just don't want to just show up just to show up i want you to come lord because i'm just a piece of clay that i asked the lord to be used but as you speak to us this morning i believe god's changing lives i believe he's i believe it right here at the end time but i believe i believe it right here there's a rapture time to get out of here his bride is making herself ready as the word says i believe she's clothing herself she's getting the word and she's praying more with his virus in the land and all these things that's going on but i'll tell you what i believe jesus christ is fixing to call us saints out of here i believe it's we're right here at the end time i believe we're right here approaching it i believe we're right here at the finish line but i tell you church don't give up i'm here to tell you this point don't give up you know it it looks like the world's falling apart but there's light in goshen this morning there's light in the end time his brother brother the last church age he put a little light in there and he said it was for me and you he saw that black down on the truth that when he wrote it down the one hand writing on the wall he started drawing the church ages and he he saw you and me this morning how thankful we should be how thankful we should be for the truth in this message this morning may god bless you let's go to him in prayer father we just love you lord god we come to you this morning with an open heart father call we just as you would take ourselves out of the way god that our cares in this world work or whatever we have on our mind father may we just sit down for this little short service and focus on you this morning god you are all in all your alarm father we love to open your book to us that our love letter could come off the pages this morning called we actually forgive us of our fires our sin and our shortcomings but god might may you touch us may encourage us lord if someone's come to press may they leave you that may they leave change this morning someone's come sick may you kill him this morning i pray for brother tom this morning may you go where he's at lord let me touch his body this morning me rise above the bed of affliction lord god all these ones that he's brought up all the sicknesses going around father you never said we wouldn't get sick but you said you would deliver himself out of all our troubles and god we claim your word this morning we trust your word it's an absolute this morning it's your children's bread this morning we raise them on faith this morning and we say we are healed in your name father we love you father we give you this service in jesus name amen oh what an honor this to be but not just at a church but what honors to be before the bride this morning one honor i just appreciate brother tom and his his love for the lord i'll tell you but you know he just texted me and sits up at the service i'm sure brother you know because i love to be around saints i love to be around the believers i don't take it lightly i tell you it's not just a likely thing to get behind a pulpit or just to say a word or just say something i always want to just be in the will of god but i may god bless you this morning brother brad brother daniel andy said hello and everyone there at the church and may god bless the ones that listen in or however you're doing it may god bless you we're going to turn if you want to stand for the reading of god's word first kings this morning first kings chapter 21 first kings chapter 21. i'll give you a minute get there it says it came to pass after these things that nabal the jezreelite had a vineyard which in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria and they have spoken to nabal saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for for it a better vineyard than it or if it seemed good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money and nabal said unto ahab the lord forbid it be forbidden in it me that i shall give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee you may be seated may god has blessings to his word you know i was thinking about this the scripture last night i was in prayer and just praying through the night just studying through the night and i was thinking about how the scripture really stood out to me how nabal you got king king you got ahab king ahab and you got nabal and here here uh here king ahab saw something enabled that he had you know and i feel like that's that we face that today that the devil if you want to picture this that king ahab was like the devil and king and nabal was like like the son of god and i feel like sometimes that the devil tries to come to attack us with something that looks better that looks like hey i'll i'll i'll give you this so i'll i'll show you something better but he goes to him in verse two and he says neighbor saying give me that vineyard that i might have it for a gardener birds because it's nearer to my house and i will give thee for a better vineyard than it so if you had a better vineyard why would he want his vineyard now i believe that's what the devil does with us he he tries to give us a glimpse of our eye that something's better and these these people here leaving the message or leaving this the devil tries to show them there's a better glimpse but there's not there's only one thing with a vindicated message there's not another vindicated message in our hour i tell you i was traveling with my mother when i first came into the message and my mom and my dad and my mom came into the message i got saved and came you know started seeing everything in the message because her mom grew up in the around the message and she got saved about six years seven years before she passed away and we got in the car and when i saw the truth it was you know i started really seeing the truth and got sold out i saw a glimpse i mean i was in the baptist church but when i saw a glimpse of what jesus done for us in that day i started listening to joseph about religion and while we were on that nomination it started to become real to me it became personal to me and church i believe you got to get a personal walk with jesus christ this morning it's more than just living off your family or living up your dad's religion or what they believe it's it's a personal walk with jesus christ because he's going to attempt you this morning he's going to show you a better glimpse or try to sell you out to the world this morning like king ahab he came up to him and here he is he said hey i'll show you a better vineyard give me your vineyard why would you want his vineyard when he's got the best vineyard i'll tell you church we got a glorious message this morning that we don't need nothing else we got a message that came and revealed the word of god and has revealed the love letter to the bride this morning he's revealed the word of god to us that we should be in the word every day we should be listening these messages every day it should be doing something to you as a personal experience it's just not a glimpse but king ahab called a glimpse of what he had and i believe sometimes we get on this world and we're we're at our jobs or wherever we're at we started to catch a glimpse of something what somebody has but church we need to realize what we have in this day he said a messenger this day that opened the scriptures should open the seals and how blessed we are if you see this truth and the eyesight has been applied to your eyes this morning what a blessing well here he is and third in the verse three it says now i'm saying to heaven back up to verse two right there's the end he says i will give you the worst and money so then he goes over and says hey you got a better view let me give you my i'll give you yours and he said he says i'll give it to you the worth of money then satan do you like that sometimes when he says hey i'll give you this better or in your mind he'll he'll say hey i'll give it to you this i'll give you you can make more money here but what good does it do if you live up in the desert and you make half a million dollars there's no church to go to what good does it do holy does no good with it your soul it you know it says you know the more sun in the in more sunny end times we we we approach we come into the house god even more i tell you the word of god doesn't change we change and the problem is we got to be changing closer to jesus this morning we got to be sold out to jesus christ this morning i'll tell you what a blessing is to have a have a have this vindicated message the devil will tell you you know come in the church come as you are and leave as you are but i'm telling you to tell you you could come as you are this morning and leave different this morning you can leave hill this morning you come in with depression you can leave that leave it here this morning and leave without it this morning i tell you i'm thankful to live in america i tell you i've served in the military for eight years i'm thankful to live in america i feel like all our rights are going down the tubes but i tell you i'm so glad i still live in america i'm so glad that i could live where our forefathers abraham lincoln is what they set up a constitution everything else after what they build america on because you'll learn in other other countries they're being for a message book they're carrying message books around and they're being their message or the bible and they're being locked up no i believe it's it's a squeeze time coming on but we need to be thankful for what we have still had the freedom we have to come to church when the door is open come to church support the pastor support the ministry but we've got to be sold out and it takes a sold-out dedication to realize what we have in this day that we don't take the message for granted that we don't take the word of god for granted you know the bible says in isaiah 5 20 woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and like for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for better i believe that's today we're living in that they call what's what's evil is good and what we see what evil we call it evil the bride of christ says i ain't nothing i test i'm about filth but you know you see everything's changing this everything's starting to change we don't know where it's going but it's all in god's plan you know i started to realize i said god not my will but your will be done that's what we got to get in we gotta line up with jesus christ this morning and stop worrying about the politics it's not worth it being sold out to jesus christ this morning i'm not talking about just quoting around a quote book i'm going to talk about just saying you know all the scriptures in the bible but i'm saying being sold out for jesus sold out for your with your life no matter what gets taken away i'd rather have my bible in my message books no matter what it is i'd rather just hey sweetheart if my house burns down grab all the message books and grab all the bibles i don't care about all the other because when you get to that revelation you realize hey i'm sold out to this truth i'm so thankful that you took me from a chicken yard and raised me up and if you're born and you were raised in this message you have something to be thankful this morning you have something that if your dad or mom's raised you in a godly home in the message i tell you you need to look at him and say thank you dad mom this morning thank you for raising me in the truth but we're living in the last days and we know that the prophecy has already prophesied so many years ago and saw all this coming down like a newspaper this morning for us and for every one of us to listen to a message and listen to it we're blessed and we're living such an upside down where prayer in school is wrong but homosexuality is right handing out bibles is wrong jesus is wrong talking to a preacher instead of instead going there into abortion clinic going to a preacher and praying with him and and whatever it is the ten commandments are wrong and filthy communication is right we're down to the last stage it's not a it's not a time to play around it's not time to play church it's the time to get into church bob ramsey in the message he said he's in the in the token message he said what is the message he said the message is christ he said get in the message which the message is christ oh church he says first peter 5 8 be sober be viligit because your adversary of the devil is a roaring lion walking about seeking whom he may devour i believe that this morning i believe he's just looking for someone that's not completely sold out this morning he's looking for someone that their heart is not sold out now i'd have to say today this morning there's a time to say you need to stand up and say hey i'm so loud for jesus christ that's the time to say hey my home is not for sale this message in these this bible is not for sale if i message the title this morning if i came up with a message this morning or a title i don't know if this will stick up here because i couldn't find any tape but we're not for sale this morning if i have something to say this morning we're not for sale the devil wants you to want you to think hey my everything is for sale but now your soul is not for sale jesus christ paid the ultimate price for us to form our sins on calvary and he's given this glorious message and you're not for sale but you know in real estate we'll do real estate transactions i do i'm a real estate agent and the problem is we have open house sometimes or even our house is open still today you know they have these open house things where it says hey come two to four o'clock and there'll be times i'll forget to even take the signs up i won't even do open house on sunday i say you can have it i don't care how much money i'd make you can have all the money you can have all the open houses i'm not doing on sunday and it's nothing of me it's just i realized when i got sold out for jesus christ i got sought out to this message you realize how much you love jesus christ even more you realize who your love is and you realize not with your wife or your husband or whatever it is you fall in love with jesus more and more and you realize that your house and your problem is i see so much traveling and traveling and traveling in this message that we glorious message that we have and i want to realize why is this home so broke up or why are they fussing more than you know just the the they're worse off some of them are worse off than the denominational churches and now we got this glorious message and i just sometimes i get in the car and i just weep and i want to know why how can you get to that point i know we're humans but the devil slips in the devil gets a little grip hold and you have open house with them and you start to leave your house door open and you don't spiritually speak it you start to leave your house open and you let the devil just keep sliding in one thing after the other and before you know it you're fussing and you're fuming and everything's going on and it's a turmoil and it's a mess and we have it in our own family it's it's a sad thing to see but i tell you you know brother said a christian don't even fuss you know when i listen to that message he said the other day i had a message right down the street going to work he said my christians don't even fuss and i said lord help me you know when you start to rise up in you you list these messages every day you get in the word of god it starts to change you it starts to take the bad things out and mold you into character you need to be in so i'm here to tell you this morning you're not for sale jesus paid the ultimate price and we need to stop opening our house this morning and have an open house in the spiritual and we need to be guarding our house uh not just for the preacher this morning but it's for every one of us this morning that we had to go to the house this morning and say hey if i see this taking my family down the wrong way or this this internet or whatever it is they want to say hey don't have a tv in your house lay down took it off and put it in our in our pockets now oh well i need a message well you know this thing you know what hey forget it but it's worse off today we have it now in our pocket it's sad but i'll tell you what the devil is trying to do is trying to get our mind off what we have in this day get our mind off the the the true word of god and what he's came to do in this day now i'm here to tell you this morning that we gotta we gotta guard our houses and i believe we're we're right here at the end time i believe we're right here at the end time but we gotta be sold out for jesus christ not just carry a book or or say a quote but truly be sold out to jesus when you're when your children look at you or they walk by or you've got a headache i had a headache yesterday and my son walked up and i said he said what's going on here i said i gotta hey he laid hands on me today he said come here lay hands on you he started praying and then not even about 20 minutes later he goes away that's because you know you start to raise your kids in a godly home and you try your best to give them you do your best in the word of god i'm here to provoke you parents or young ones or whatever you are and no matter what your if your family's going the wrong way or that you be sold out for jesus i'll tell you my dad's way far away he don't believe any of it he'll call me today and say you still believe it i said i'm more sold out today than i was yesterday but we've got to be sold out to jesus this morning it's got to be more than just i'm just i'm just floating along this morning it's going to be true dedication to jesus no matter it's not it's not a matter when the devil's coming this if he's coming it's he's coming and he's going to try to get in your family he's going to try to do something like you'll wake up tomorrow it didn't seem like the world's falling apart but i tell you i said get behind me satan i said hey when my times to come hey i'll go ahead i just pass on they don't do anything but change my my where my dwelling place is i'm so thankful for that that we just when we do pass on he just changes to our theophany oh how glorious is that going to be and i'm here to tell you church to be sold out for jesus this morning because i tell you you don't want to miss it for the world i say brother brown when he cry he crossed over and said time he saw what's coming he know who they were he said i was converted in your meeting that was converted to me he didn't want to go back down to that body he will go back down to the body because he got a glimpse of heaven he got a glimpse of that in that other dimension he wasn't even in heaven yet but he got the glimpse of being surrounded by love and by jesus just can you imagine how that's going to be how glorious it's going to be but it's no matter when the devil's coming but he's going to come in some way or some form in your family or where he knows where to punch brother braham said he knows exactly where to punch he said and you have to guard it well we got to be sold out this morning and if i had a title for this message i would call it sold out for jesus sold out for jesus christ not just to be another message believer i didn't grow up with my watch group in the message all alive how blessed that could be without taya but how much more blessed when you get your eyes open and the eye sounds applied and you go god thank you jesus thank you for the uh thank you for the truth that has opened the absolute even more to me but i want to bring a few points out this morning i try to hold you along but verse two verse two it made me think he said and ahab speak in the neighborhood saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs and i think that's what the devil does with this this morning he wants to put a little seasoning on it he wants to add a little bit of seasoning here to say hey the world's better or hey a little bit of garden of herbs you know what herbs are you know just a little bit of herbs put on there just give it a little taste you know he wants to give you a little better taste of oh this is better out in this world but there's nothing better to be to be under jesus christ this morning there ain't nothing better being sold out for jesus christ no matter what age we are we can always get closer to jesus christ there's always something in their lives that even my life that i say lord take that away from me lord take this away from me or if i'm speaking i'm speaking to you there's three more fingers pointing back to me say lord help me lord oh draw me closer to your manuals veins oh feed me this morning but he wants to give you a little taste it's just like the bible this morning they they sprinkle it down now they said that king james they got living water and living this and living that i got friends of the world that texted me oh my goodness check this check this bible out i don't wanna hey let me just have an old-time religion i don't want the watered-down stuff everybody talk about king james and you know i i tell you give me let me stick with this old-time bible don't give me the living water where they took out half the scriptures and they've applied there that's what the wrongs the world today is they've got sold out to the devil and they started to even change the scriptures they start changing the bible this morning and they start to realize you want to know when you go to the gas station and why the world is just it's just going back and forth they're losing their minds but you know what i've lost my mind a long time ago when i met jesus christ i'll tell you brother you call me crazy but you just keep calling me crazy but i'm crazy for jesus christ this morning we're an oddball like that message he preached the oddball wearing eyeball this morning but i tell you you need to be thankful that you're an eyeball that you're walking around here this morning you're believing the message of malachi 4 this morning and you're standing behind the message they even said that brother barry would present us to jesus christ he said you would follow your flock you would give him a brother tom and my pastor brother brad and they would you would get along with your sheep and then all of a sudden then you get you under your church age messenger this morning i don't know what you this morning but i'm gonna be so thankful i ain't been mad brother brown i'm about to tell you what it'd be so glorious when you get behind brother tom or brother brad and then you get behind your messenger and you're in line can you imagine and you're in line on that day and you're lined up with all your messengers and you got wesley and you got luther you got all of them lined up throughout the ages and you're sitting there with your messenger and you're saying just like hattie wright hey that's nothing but the truth that's nothing but the truth i'll tell you we got to get that in the heart this morning not just to carry a book around but to say hey that's nothing but the truth if it's good enough for her it's good enough for me this morning he even told her he said hey whatever you ask whatever you want just ask it if it's money hey i want the salvation of my boys i tell you the devil bring that up too people say well they're out of the world i don't care where they're at hey she said he said you have the salvation of your boys hey they'll be there i believe the problem you either believe this message or you don't you know they say hey well the clouds here collide you know what that's hogwash you know don't explain it to me don't get caught the devil wants to give you a little bit of seasoning to look on the internet and say hey did this happen or this happened robert said 99.9 is still alive but we have to be sold out to this message in jesus christ this morning we got to be sold out christian soldiers walking it on i'll tell you church we're so blessed and then they started changing the music and then they changed this and he only heard that group hill song they came on the radio the other day and i was like is this a christian song my boys let me say well would you just turn that off hey what up they want to sprinkle a little music they don't change even the music now you can't even turn to the christian radio because it ain't really christian anymore what we call christian anymore is anything you even listen to in the radio is of the world just give me an old time tape or give me you know i'll tell you i'm not i guess i'm getting a little old but i pull up i wish i missed some little cassette tapes you push it down it falls down it mess up you do like this sometimes but i tell you just give me some old stuff back just give it back to me i tell you like the god jesus i mean the devil wants to just put a little herb on it just water it down some or just give you a little living word bible and say hey read this or read that and you don't even have any meaning of what it means anymore the devil wants to come in and destroy families and i see it so much i see it more as the day approaching he's just sliding in just somewhere but but where does it happen at it's somewhere someone's left the open house sign on and said devil just come on in this morning or just you just sit over here for a minute i'll serve god i'll pray to god and then the next minute i'm busting out my wife and the next minute i'm doing this or the kids are watching your kids are watching every move you make they're watching everything i'll tell you my boy will bring something up all the time i said i don't know how you remember that but you're i'm telling you they said i guess from the ages like one or two like zero to six you're forming them like concrete i'm here to tell you if you haven't had kids this morning you ever get a family i tell you get sold out to jesus christ and get sold out to the word of god because i tell you you're forming them like concrete and when they get certain to a certain age i'm not saying jesus christ can't change him or fill him with the baptism of the holy ghost because he did me at the age of 21 years old he came down and it saved my soul and i saw the message grandma hand me a message book i was leaving for college and going to the military after i got in the military i did my first round came back she handed me a book she said here here here chris listen to these it was why you're on the nomination jezebel religion she had them and she said take these with you before i got halfway down the road i was just crying and i i think it's just be thankful that you had that deep cut to the deep this morning that you have something to respond to this morning that there's something on the inside that when you hear the problem of god you respond to it be thankful for that this morning but i really like this scripture he says it says the garden of herbs because it's nearing to my house and i started to think about that it's near into his house he's the first you know it's a garden of herbs and near into my house and i started thinking about convenience it's convenient what's convenient for you the devil wants to say hey this is convenient or listen to this or do this or do that hey i want to you know it's convenience it's nearer to my house but what's near into your house might not be what's what what the guy wants to give you this morning maybe it's maybe it's a better position but it's going to pull you away jesus christ maybe it's you sleeping yo i gotta get nine hours of sleep but i can't get six hours and go pray before i go to work for an hour oh i'm telling you church it's real i've been there i'm telling you oh they will say we'll sleep two more hours because you can hit the snooze button but the convenience of getting up and going to get on your knees and praying for your family this morning or laying hands on your children i walk in the bedroom and start rebuking the spirit and praying for it brother i'm even saying you're gonna have to wipe your glasses clean to see he said even how strong it will be each and every day every year each generation how much more demons but i tell you the church it's convenient oh it's convenient to stay in this warm bed and to get out of my knees and start praying well church i ask the lord help me even more stay in the bed or don't come to church when the doors are open or i got to go do this so i got my oxes in the ditch i always hear that so much they want to bring out these quotes with my axes in the ditch you can't go today oxford's in the ditch i'll tell you doc's going to ever get out he's the ox gonna ever get out of the den but i'll tell you when you get a solid foundation in jesus christ this morning your ox will get out of the ditch you won't take the deal you will move the you will move the ox out of the ditch this morning you'll get rid of the ox and you'll say you know what i'll deal with it on monday i'll deal with it on tuesday thursday we have thursday night y'all have wednesday night i'll deal with it thursday if you have service on wednesday the devil always wants to give us some kind of convenience or a little bit of urge to put on it just say hey just don't go there tonight but i tell you it's a dedication to jesus christ once you realize what you have in this day not just to come to church and when you wake up in the morning and you go lord you gave me what a glorious day it is to be awake well of course today as you hear the cold cases just on the rampage of life support and this and that and you realize that all you all your whole life hinges on jesus christ he decides when to pull the plug you don't decide when to pull the plot it's kind of like life support your life is when you're truly sold out in jesus christ your life support they might have a machine but i'll tell you what jesus christ has got the main machine this morning he's got a machine that goes a lot higher than a little cord this morning he's got a machine that goes up to the glory's and he tells you what he's going to pull your card this morning but we got to be sold out to jesus we got to be sold out how much the devil he would say hey i got a better vineyard and then it's near into my house but we gotta say on the firing lines this morning we gotta we gotta be a truly sold out to jesus not just say i'm sold out but truly until like buddy rob said brother brown said but he robson said i will pray if you find my bones out here i will pray to you fill me with the holy ghost and i believe sometimes there's people walking around the message that are not truly filled this morning they're not truly filled they they possess it or they say they got it in their possession but they don't possess it way down deep they don't possess it way down deep in their soul this morning that's why you see split up holes and you see still uh no hillary the healings are know you someone will pray for somebody they don't get healed because their faith they haven't built it on the statue of a perfect man then they built their foundation on faith this morning like the bible says in hebrews 11 faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen it's more than just something it's it's something that you possess we have to be sold out but we got to make our mind up our house is not for sale i don't care what they say you can sell all the material stuff but my house is not for sale i'm going to protect it i'm going to guide it i'm going to protect my family till i get out of here if he takes me tomorrow i'll do my best in jesus christ the devil's at war but i'm saying there's two powers he talks about the power of satan and the power of god he's got all these messages you can listen to they're wonderful messages but he talks about how you get the power of satan how the satan tries to come in but you have the power of god that's already conquered death hell in the grave that gave peter king's the king kingdom of hell because he said hey he said you know we haven't revealed this to you but my father in heaven's revealed it to you aren't you thankful that your father in heaven revealed you this message of the hour this morning he's revealed you this glorious truth and what are we doing with it church are we really sold out for jesus this morning well it makes me think brother brown i was thinking about the brother brown talks about the abstract of the title i know wonderful i want you to catch this this morning he said he said or if it seemed good to thee i will give thee the worth of it and money so here the devil is hey i'll just pay you off the devil wants to go sprinkle it down a little bit and then he wants to give you a little convenience and then he wants to pay you off hey i'll give you this i'll give you this better job hey you can move 14 states away there's not even a church around you'll make the smile money who cares who cares you have nothing when you have a glorious church like this and a wonderful pastor that you have and you go 15 states away and you make this amount of money it don't matter it don't even matter i'm telling you when you get solid the genius you start to realize if i have to drive 14 hours this way to come 14 hours back hey whatever it takes i'll do it but i'm going to be fed and my children are going to be fed and my soul is going to be fed but you got to get sold out brother brown says in this message confirmation and evidence in 1962 he says when a man buys a car he must have a deed to the car he said and though he has not the car sitting in the garage if he has a deed it's confirmation to him that he owns that car because he has a deed or a title and then if he bought a piece of ground he says that he would have never seen the ground he said no nothing about the ground and yet have the abstract deed to that ground he said it belongs to us whether we have seen it or not it belongs to us the card belongs to us whether we have seen it or not yet we have it he said the title was given to us and we hold it in our possession in our name that title shows us that we own that car and the abstract deep tells us we own the property aren't you thankful from generations now that when he opens the land book of life that he's got an abstract title d tonight that started coming all the way down from abraham's seed that he could leak us right back to and say he they're my president they're my property this morning and it makes me think in matthew i was reading matthew sitting back there blessed five six everyone's heard this the beatitudes he's blessed are thee that which hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are they that which hunger and thirst it's it's something on our part that we got to do to this morning not let jesus is waiting on us to do something he says bless it it's a you know blessed are the great jesus is saying this blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteous for they shall be filled that's a promise this morning and i love this where he says matthew 6 19 lay not up your their sword treasures upon earth where moth and rust do corrupt and where thieves break there and steal but lay up yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth or rust do corrupt and where things do not break through or steal for where your treasure is there your heart will also we gotta lay our treasures we gotta be looking for that city john's all coming down this morning well i'm so thankful that when we're sold out to jesus christ that jesus paid the ultimate price he came from ivory palaces to save every one of us this morning i'm talking about the bride of christ this morning if you're filled with the holy ghost he came to redeem you this morning you are redeemed this morning he's just waiting for that last one to come in this morning he's waiting that last one to stop playing church and playing the message or living behind the quote this morning he's here to say get sold out for jesus and we can go home or he's waiting for one family member or one of you to speak to one family member they might be the last one we don't know all he's looking for you don't even have to say nothing to somebody he just like brother brown said the life behind the name makes the devil tremble he said the weakest christian can get on his knees and it makes the devil tremble you imagine someone sold out to jesus this morning that gets on their knees imagine what the devil does this morning when you're truly sold out to this truth and this glorious message you get sold out and you get on your knees imagine what it does to the devil this morning if he says the weakest christian it makes him tremble oh i'm so thankful this morning but it makes me think about this message brother bear preach possessing all things he was talking i'm a paraphrase for time but he talks about how this he this this gentleman went to abraham lincoln and he said he went to him and he started talking to him he said hey look he got a little trouble and he started to go to me said hey would you give him a pardon and finally he writes a little pardon he gives him a part and he brings it back and he he says get out of here with that they don't even and then the courts rule because he didn't accept the party that it didn't become a pardon church this morning we have a pardon this money we have something we can sell out to sell and i'll tell you it will pardon you from sin you know he'll pardon you he will heal you this morning it'll raise you anybody from the dead this morning it'll make you leave here this morning with a smile on your face but we got to get in the book we got to become one with the love letter brother branham said it's a love letter for the bride that when you read a letter from your wife or she sends you a text i can read in between the lines they might be just two it might be a little paragraph i'll tell you when i said the text is all broken up because i'm all over the place she'll send it all in a nice little paragraph and i got it for a paragraph for me it'll be 14 texts later but i'll tell you you can read inside that text and realize what you're saying just like when you open the book if the book is not coming off the pages for you i encourage you to to rededicate your life and say lord fill me give me another refilling this morning i encourage you this morning to be sold out for jesus be sold out for this message don't worry about this person's going here or this person is going here you worry about you and your family this morning i tell you no matter if anybody goes my me and my family are going this morning my brother was back here talking he said hey no matter if daddy don't go i was around the lines of i was speaking this morning he said daddy don't go or this don't go my son you go church we gotta get so sold out for jesus that no if i'm the only one in jeffersonville going i'm the only one going but that's the grace of god this morning now claiming the blood of christ this morning that cleanses all our sins if you made everything right he's still a redemption he's coming for a bride church he's coming for a bride but we have to accept the pardon this morning we have to accept it this morning as romans 5 1 says therefore be adjusted by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom we are we have access by faith unto grace where we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only so but the glory and tribulations no one tribulations worketh patience and hope make it not a shame because the love of god is a shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given to us aren't you thankful that he's he went ahead and went set by the right hand of god and he has sent his holy spirit to fill us and to get us through every single day every single day the holy spirit is guiding and directing your life you might get out a little bit of the will but then he just pulls you right back in aren't you think well that he's holding your hand this morning problem said water of separation he said and we've got a title deed to it an abstract he goes it goes way back to calvary he said the day of pentecost when they said the promise isn't to you and to your children and them that's far off even as many as the lord our god shall call abstract deed amen reverend said clear all the way back to pentecost he said how far does it go back how many how many is it for as many as the lord will call he says the lord calls you he gives you an abstract title amen all the way back and the blood of jesus christ is just as good as it would have been shed 10 minutes ago aren't you thankful this morning he said 10 minutes ago not 2 000 years ago don't live in the past he said it's good for you just as it should 10 minutes ago oh church is fresh this morning his boy will will cleanse all our sin we make everything right and we get sold out for jesus christ and we don't want to say i'm living in a message what's that mean or i believe the message but get in the message bob said in the token message you've ever listened to it he said the message is jesus christ so i'm here to provoke you this morning to get in jesus we're living uncertainty times where everything's up in the air the hospitals are filling i'm not discrediting that but i'm not going to discredit his word with the word this morning okay he said greater is he that's in me that he that's in the world whatever we ask in his name he'll give it to us we got to be sold out to jesus christ that we could go right back and re-quote the scriptures to him that's what satan did when so when he went on 40 jesus went away 40 days i'm so glad that jesus christ gave us examples this morning that he could say hey he just said like that and the same would have been a way but he said it's written he said get behind me so if we're not in the scriptures or in these messages every day it's going to bring you down it's going to give you troubles in life life's going to throw you a lot of lemons but i'll tell you what jesus christ will give you everything you have need of your wife your girlfriend boyfriend whatever it is your family cannot feel that void but jesus christ my wife can't feel the void my boys can't feel the voice there's only one void that jesus christ has to fill you this morning and if he let you him feel if he feels that void then you'll need any other boy that you ever could think of but we got to get back and realize like he said i just love it and the blood of jesus christ is just as good as it would have been shed 10 minutes ago just think about it close your eyes and think about that the blood of christ would have been just as good as it was shed 10 minutes ago church is powerful that's so powerful that that that it's just not it's just not a it's not a history book this morning brother braham said the power of the devil 1955 1955 he said if the devil that come to you tonight tried to send you to a premium grade he said tried to you up he said read god's abstract title deed he said by the stripes we're healed and if we don't want to believe that there's a holy ghost here the law of god that'll kick him out that'll prove it he said just ring up jesus central j-e-s-u-s he says find out if something don't take your place he says the angels of god will take their positions aren't you thankful tonight or this morning that when you call up jesus they take their positions it's like the military you would you would start marching you get ready and we were in fort bliss texas and we were we were trying to get ready to be deployed and went to washington when the war all over it's starting to be just get trained and we'll start training ourselves but you know what the bride of christ needs to start training her she needs to pick up the word of god this morning and pick up these messages you know what you want ammunition this morning just listen to the word of god this morning listen to what he called in this day they've even got churches where half the pillow fires not even you can't even find it in some churches or you got it back in the back or before you know it it's in the bathroom and before you know it it's in the car i tell you i love being associated with churches that's got the seven churches messengers and they got the prophet on the wall this morning i love it it it unites me because he has revealed this glorious message in this last day but we can call on jesus and he says the angels take their position you think about that when we call on jesus you might not see it but the angels just say come down and just start taking their position like in the military you start getting ready you start getting ready to get deployed or you train for months and years you probably somehow have been in here in the military and you train you train and you're under you're throwing grenades and you're under you're under fire and you're practicing you're practicing but you know what the bride of christ is doing the same thing right now the true bride of christ is preparing for a true rapture she's parent for that time where well i believe we're right here at the i believe that's what's going on the fires are being shot the government's taking over communism has come whatever it is but who cares if you're resting in the arms of jehovah jireh and you're resting in you know the arms of jesus this morning why are you worried this morning the devil wants to put a little bit of like he says in that scripture he wants to put a little bit of herbs this morning to water it down or to bring fear in our lives but i'm going to tell you this morning i want to encourage this more he tries to bring fear on me but i tell you i'll just push play and listen to a tape i'll be in the quieter that's in my car like the brother was saying and let the god where he can just speak to you maybe not even push play just let god speak to you sometimes he wants to speak to his children he wants you to speak back to him he really wants to have communion with you but he says the angels will take their position and the devil will get out and you could stand there on your toes and say yes sir it's the truth he said amen not up here or down here you read that you're you read your title clear twice this morning that he paid the ultimate price for you he said whosoever he didn't he didn't miss one person in this world whosoever should come let him come jesus christ i'll tell you he didn't he he didn't correct but he didn't create hell for for anyone he created for the devil and his his little the demons and his angels he created that he didn't want one person to miss heaven but it breaks my heart but when you pass these churches cope is going around but there's still there's still light on there's still just a little bit of light in this day there's just a little bit of light and i'm just here to tell you this morning i just want to tell you by the grace of god to keep pressing on and to sell out your home to jesus christ and don't let the devil in the back door or the front door you protect your home you stand up for what's right well that's first corinthians 6 20 says for we are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and your spirit which are god's we are bought with a price church jesus christ didn't come down the cross for our sins just to just just walk around say hey i believe a message or i believe this i believe that he wants us to be sold out for jesus he wants us to be sold out to jesus christ this morning god is good he's so good to us but we got to get a hunger and thirst we have to have that hunger if he if you don't if you come this morning you don't travel hunger you don't leave here this morning without getting the hunger they say god feel me until i can't feel it anymore fill my cup the problem is we have a vessel that we don't want to clean out we won't leave the world in it and it's some of god but we got to truly pour out all our will that's what jesus christ did he gone to christ said not my will but my father's will be done why not us why can't we say not our will we get our pride all caught up in things or we're somebody we're nobody but we are god's children if you're sealed under jesus christ you are sons and daughters of god at this moment but we got to empty out the vessel where he can feel he don't clean up he don't feel a dirty vessel this morning and there's things in our life are we messing with the world or whatever it is this morning i'm here to tell you to to to this should be the last day i'm gonna ask you to come to the altar 14 times whatever it is i'm telling you you can do it in your seat you can do it in your car you can do it on your way home you can do it at work wherever you're at but i'm telling you to get a real revelation of what we have in this day that we have what glorious light he's brought even said brother billy paul would say in jeffersonville he would tell me he said his dad would even iron the take here we go between services he would take his jacket and iron it almost pull it between the seats to iron the wrinkles out i tell you it just just really just i'm so thankful that all the things that he went through mostly jesus christ because that's the one who saved us brother brown didn't save us but i'm so glad that he did send a messenger in a day to open our eyes there's only one true savior and that's jesus christ and that's who we got to get into this morning like matthew 5 verse 5-6 it says blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled not shall be or could be filled but will be filled blessed are the merciful for they will be shown mercy church we gotta get a true revelation of what jesus christ did in our day you know enoch saw it noah saw it noah was warned he said build an ark 100 over 100 years just keep building you think about how crazy they thought he was i don't know if you've been over to the ark in kentucky i think it's in kentucky they just build the ark how many times they would come up to them probably say what are you doing we've never seen no rain there's not a first one but you know what brother you know brother noah had a forecast he saw a forecast this morning he saw a forecast in his heart and that's the same forecast the bride should be seeing this morning they should see a forecast this morning they see the heaven the heavens coming down and where you know they say that song where it says the will speed up and they'll slow down i believe that's coming church i believe no matter what they say about me or what they say i'm sold out for this message i'm sold out to the true word of god this morning we got to get to that way we got to get to that point where noah was built in the ark and they started talking about but he was sold out for jesus he kept building the ark no matter what they said but two by two two by two they started getting on this huge ark they started getting on there after this many years no rain and then he floods the earth but church i believe the art door is starting to close i'm not just here to preach a message of your uh just a message just to flood the altars whatever it is whatever's on your heart this morning you're more welcome but i'm here to tell you i truly believe the art door is closing and i truly believe i don't just get on the road just to travel i get on the road to say look the art door is closing this morning it could be the last service this morning that we'll be meeting the dead in christ shall rise and we'll meet him in the air this could be the very last service that we could get sold out and make one he's our one attitude talks about the one middle attitude could deter our destination and how we accept the word this morning but noah sitting here building this ark for so many years all this hate all this hate but he still stayed on track because he was sold out to jesus just like abraham and sarah 25 years she even went away and laughed but he said hey i'm sold out we're gonna if he said it that's it if he said he's coming for a bride i'm gonna be the bride if he said he's coming he's gonna be a rap shop we'll be in the rapture but we gotta get sold out to jesus christ this morning as the positions come this morning there's got a few other things to read but i'm just here to tell you this morning we got to stop playing open house with the devil we got to stop leaving our houses open for the devil just to ponder over i tell you a family member called me said you know something happened this was not even long ago and i'm just telling you excuse me for for experiences but i'm just here to tell you it happens to me happens to all of us and they called and they were they were fostered this and that they were human and they were like why do you protect your wife so much because i love her because we're one i'm the same way with the word of god in this message i love it because he found me one day and i got sold out to jesus and now i protect this more than i do anything because once you realize what we have in this day it'll change your life and once you get sold out to jesus christ and not leaving the house is open saying devil come in or come in and they play something softly just think about it for just a minute we can be in school for hours or we can be at work for hours but we can't give god an hour of our time just one hour on a sunday or wednesday or whatever it is sunday night whatever it is we'll read this in closing first peter chapter 2 it says but we are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that we should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into this marvelous light what a marvelous light we have which in time past we're not people we were not a people but we are now the people of god which had not attained mercy but now have obtained mercy church i believe that comes off the scripture more than me and ever that he's called us out to a glorious light glorious message he's opened every genesis to revelation he's opened every book in the bible these opie's came through and sent a prophet to this day in our land that we can listen to 1200 messages because i was at the tabernacle the other day there were some visitors from canada they had a wedding the other day brother chase sister zoe shop tall and we went by the we went by the tabernacle they closed even them doors it's sad to see i was walking in there i started about crying i said look david close the tabernacle now you know i believe the devil wants to close water down everything he can where you don't think about a message but i tell you church once it gets instilled in you and you're sold out you'll find them messages you'll you'll listen to the word you'll read the bible every day 1200 messages on your phone instead of facebook get your face in this book this morning [Music] i'm talking about stay on facebook get your face in a book that's going to change you get their face in it on facebook social media get your face in this book this morning and get sold out give more time to him i tell you church i provoke you this morning maybe you've been on facebook too much in one day maybe it's five hours you know your phone can track how long have you been on something why don't you try to change it around maybe spend an hour there and five hours in the book and see what that does for you as a mother or father [Music] see what that does for you it'll change you it'll change you and shape you what you need to be [Music] when your eyes closed with your head bowed your eyes closed this morning maybe there's someone in here this morning that might have kind of got away from god a little bit this morning or
