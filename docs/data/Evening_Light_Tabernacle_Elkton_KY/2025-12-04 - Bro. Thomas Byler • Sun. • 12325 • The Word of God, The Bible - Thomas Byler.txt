You look around, you think, well, there's not. It's not a full house. He didn't say it had to be a full house. He said where two [music] or three are gathered. So, how many believers do we have here tonight? How many come? Amen. How many come to pull on the gift of the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. We do have a lot of needs before us tonight. So, we want to bring those needs before the church. And if we could, Brother Caleb and maybe Brother Tommy, y'all just make your way up. Brother Steve, if you'll come up too and brother Steve is going to lead us in prayer and we'll just take the knees before the Lord and and take up the offering at the same time [music] tonight. And [clears throat] uh brother brother David, sister Janet, [music] they're they're sick and not feeling well and uh they're on the mend I think but [music] uh it became kind of a sticky situation I think for Sister Janet. And so just remember them in prayer. Brother Shawn, he couldn't be with us. They couldn't be with us tonight. his his back is giving him trouble tonight. And Sister Sherry's not feeling well tonight. I think uh little Hie is is uh still not 100%. So remember her in prayer. Uh and also remember Lacy. She's sick tonight. [music] So a lot going around and but we know God's a healer. God's a provider. Whatever we have need of, he's more than able. Also, we want to remember Brother Troy, Sister Robin. They're traveling and on their way out to Arizona. So just ask that the the Lord would be with them. And Brother Devon, Sister Jana, I think are traveling tonight as [music] well. So remember them in prayer that the Lord would just have his guardian angels about them and [music] and uh watch over them and protect them. So, Brother Steve, if [music] &gt;&gt; dear most gracious heavenly father, you've heard all of these requests, Lord. And Lord, I'm sure there's others, Lord, that didn't get mentioned that maybe we overlooked or we didn't know about, but the thing about it is, Lord, we know that [music] you know each one. And Father, we just believe, Lord, we come tonight believing. And we've seen your powerful hand, Lord, move amongst us. And Lord, it's not a certain day or a certain time that something's got to happen, but through you and through your power, Lord, all things can happen at your time and at your place. And Lord, we just pray that you be with these, Lord, traveling, these that are sick. Lord, just be with each one, Father. And we just want to thank you for the multitude of healings [music] that has been brought Lord to our remembrance and different times in life. Lord, we've seen your hand, Lord. And you're the same God today, yesterday, and forever. [music] And we just thank you for that in your name. Amen. While they're getting their song ready, I do just want to make a quick announcement. Brother Keith Reed did want to just send greetings and thanks and uh for the offering that we were we're sending over and it's in transit right now and and uh he said it was just a just a just a terrible situation as they still begin to look at it and but they're so grateful so grateful for for the offering that we sent and um I don't think it's been announced how much we was able to take up but I I will announce it uh now it hasn't been announced yet has it? I think we we were able to send $6,500 to Jamaica. So, very good offering. They're very grateful and thankful and just continue to remember them in prayer. They're being overrun with uh with rats and roaches. Uh the water table pushed all the varmints out of the ground and they're out of rat poison and so they're they're fighting rats and and roaches. So, uh that I don't think that's too much information, but it's a need. They have a need. They they need us to pray that that things would get back to a normal state for them that they could have church. So, you can be seated tonight and won't keep you standing. Brother Steve, Sister Becky has a special for us tonight. &gt;&gt; We uh sing this song tonight. We visited with her a little bit this afternoon and um she's doing really well. Uh just remember her her hands and her feet still giving her some trouble but uh she looks really really good. Uh and we just thank the Lord for what he's done in her life. I mean it's just a miracle. Uh some of y'all might not have seen her when she was at her lowest but she is a total totally different person today. So just thank the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; All alone and [singing and music] brokenhearted trying to calm the raging battle in my mind. [singing] I searched for many answers, but my troubled [music] soul just couldn't seem to find. [singing] &gt;&gt; I saw a flower [singing] blooming where there was no rain or sunshine. And I knew [singing and music] not that this flower would change the rest of my life. [singing] &gt;&gt; I found a lily in my valley. &gt;&gt; I found strength when I was warm. [music] &gt;&gt; I found a place to leave my burdens. I found [singing] a refuge from [music] the storm, &gt;&gt; a place to train my dark to [singing] beaming rays of sunshine. I found [singing] a lily [music] in my valley and [singing] he blooms all the time. So if [singing] you're down and brokenarted and you just can't seem [singing and music] to find peace of mind, [music] &gt;&gt; you're searching for your answers, but your problems are [singing] getting worse all the time. [music] Just reach your hands to Jesus. [singing] He'll take you and break the ties at mine. [singing] &gt;&gt; He'll be your lily in your [singing] valley. [music] You can watch him bloom all the time. &gt;&gt; He'll be [singing] your li and your valley. He'll be strength when you're warm. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; He'll be the place to leave your [singing] burden. &gt;&gt; He'll give you refuge from the [singing] storm. [music] A place to trade your dark skies [singing] to beaming [music] rays of sunshine. &gt;&gt; He'll [music] be your lily in [singing] your valley and he'll bloom all [music] the time. I found a lady in my valley. [singing] &gt;&gt; I found strength when I was warm. [singing] &gt;&gt; I found a place to leave my burdens. [music] &gt;&gt; I found a refuge from the storm. [music] A place to train your dark skies [music] to beaming rays of sunshine. &gt;&gt; I found a lily in my valley [music] &gt;&gt; and he [singing] blooms all the time. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; It's good to know that no matter what you're going through, you have a a lily in your valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand if we could. And I just don't think we can sing this song sitting down. And you need a lot of air to sing this song. So, it's been been preached about a lot here lately. And and Sister [music] Becky is going to help me some with this. And I know there's about four or five of you in here that has sung this as [music] a special. So, let's just let the glory roll when the roll is called in glory. [music] Let's try to give that a song, a chance if we could. I'm going to let the glory roll when the roll is called [music] in glory. [singing] I'm going to get beside myself. When I get beside [music] the key, [singing] that day I'm going to have the time of my life. When the time of [music] my life is over, I'm going to get [singing] carried away. When I get carried away, well, I don't know why I become a little shy when I get around a whole [singing] lot of people. And I can't figure out why I never shout about the love that floods my soul. [singing] I must confess. [music] I can't express the feeling [singing] deep inside me. The things I know and cannot [music] show. One day [singing] will overflow. I'm going to let the glory roll. When the roll is called in glory, [singing and music] I'm going to get beside myself. When I get beside the king, that day I'm going to [music] have the time of my life. When the time of my life [singing] is over, I'm going to get carried away. When I get carried away, [singing] well, I'll pass the cloud and I shout so loud it may sound [singing and music] like thunder. My tearful eyes may fill the skies until it looks like rain. When I leave [music and singing] this world and gates of pearl, I stand before my savior. I lift my soul. [singing] Let the glory roll. When the roll, he [music] calls my name. I'm [singing] going to let the glory roll. When the roll is calling glory, [music] I'm going to give a side of myself. When I get beside the king, that day [singing] I'm going to have the time [music] of my life. When the time of my life is over, I'm going to get carried away. When I get carried away, I'm going to let the [singing] glory roll. When the roll is called in glory, [music] when I get beside the king that day, I'm going to have the time [music] of my life. When the time of my life is over, &gt;&gt; I'm going to get [singing and music] carried away. &gt;&gt; When I get carried away, hallelujah. Give him my hand clap of praise tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good to be. Amen. I appreciate you helping there. We needed the help. So, [music] let's just if we could just change the order of the service. We'll invite Brother Ber to come and and we'll have Amazing Grace. We'll sing that as brother Ber [music] comes. It's amazing [singing] grace how sweet the sound that save a rich like [singing] me. I once was lost, [music and singing] but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see. [singing and music] It was grace that told [singing] [music] God bless you, brother Brad. And your grace my fears raing. [singing] How precious did [music] that grace appear the [singing] hour [music] I first believe. Oh, praise God. [singing] [music] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise [singing and music] God. Praise God. I praise God. Oh, and I thank you Lord for saving [music and singing] my soul. I thank you Lord for making me whole. Thank you Lord [music] for giving to [singing] me. Oh thy great salvation [singing and music] so rich and free. Amen. Hallelujah. How many is thankful? Amen. [music] For his grace. Amen. and that he gave to you so rich and so free. Amen. God bless you. Good evening, everybody. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the Lord &gt;&gt; where it's warm. Amen. Been a little bit nippy the last couple days, but thank you musicians. Thank you for leading songs tonight. Appreciate that. Amen. Thank you all for coming out. Amen. Amen. So, we just see what the Lord will have for us this evening. It's just kind of kind of a different Amen. direction. Amen. I feel like the Lord's taking me tonight. So, we'll just try to follow the leading of the Lord. Is that okay? Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, as we come bow our heads to the dust from where we were made, Lord, and realizing, Father, we are but clay in your hands. And we ask God tonight that you would just use us for your honor for your glory. Be with the speaker, ears of the hearer, those streaming, we pray God that you'll give them all a special blessing, Lord, as we open your word and talk about your word tonight in Jesus name. Amen and amen. Amen. Have we got a title up there yet? Go ahead and throw that up there if you haven't. Amen. The word of God, the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. you know, it's just gonna Amen. Um, we know that the Bible is the word of God. Amen. So, Amen. Let's turn, if you will, to the book of Revelations. We'll read a scripture there all the way back in the book of Revelations. We'll just do a little teaching tonight. Amen. And uh give you a little drama. Amen. At the beginning here, but in Revelations 19, um, let me just stop there and make a little correction. Amen. That is long overdue. Amen. Brother Chris Kathy, last time that he was here, and we're fixing to have him here Sunday again. By God's grace, he's going to minister for us Sunday morning and Sunday evening. Amen. So Chris Kathy will be with us. But last time he had made some a statement in his preaching that he wanted me to correct and I haven't done it. Amen. And it just slipped my mind. Amen. And so did I. I thought about it this evening. So I wrote it down. So um I want to do that. Amen. And he was preaching and he said, you know, that about his wife. He was about talking about the Lord and uh giving him a wife. Y'all might remember it, probably won't, but anyway, he was telling the Lord if God would give him uh, you know, a wife, you know, a godly wife and all that, he would serve him, you know, and that is not what he had intended to say. Amen. Because he doesn't serve him just because he give him a wife. He serves him for another purpose. You understand that? But he meant to say that he would protect her. Amen. He would protect her. So he wanted me to relay that, you know, but like I said, that was about a month ago, so you all forgive me. Amen. But anyway, we do that sometimes. Ain't that right? Later on, we'll think about something. And especially, it's easy for me to make a corre correction the next, you know, service or all. But if somebody don't come back for a while, I mean, I can see why they would want to correct something like that. And he's very sensitive and we appreciate him. Look forward to hearing him again this weekend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, Revelations 19 now and we'll begin with verse 11. And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness does he judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns. And he had a name written that no man knew but he himself. He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, clean and white. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should sm the n smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron. And he treadth the wine press of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God. Amen. May God added his blessing to the reading of the words. You can be seated. Now, basically, we're basically I mean, this is going to be a little bit what you might think just really really down to the to the basics. Really back to the basics. And just talking about this book, this book right here. And the Bible, how many knows that in a lot of it's outlawed? You can't have it. You can't have this. They don't want you to have this. Why? Because it does something to somebody. It it does something when you open it and when you read it, &gt;&gt; it does it has such profound effects upon people until they would rather have you chop their head off than to take this from them. Is that right? Many times dictators like Russia, Stalin, different ones, China, any dictator, they don't want you to read this because they want you to worship him. I've heard some uh uh uh of North Korea's dictator and how that he would allow certain people come and have the cataracts taken out of their eyes. And I was reading how he, you know, lets different ones to be doctorred on and they worship him and they absolutely worship him and thank him and make him God. He's he's God to them. But you know when they when you open this when when when this book right here. Amen. That's what I want to talk about. With the help of the Lord, we know that it is God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the most precious word book that there is. Is &gt;&gt; that right? There's nothing like it. &gt;&gt; Nothing like in all the world. No other book like it. Amen. and King James version of this Bible, this Bible the way that it is. Amen. I certainly take King James version of it. Amen. We know because there's many different versions. There's uh additions and everything else and you know uh and they change a lot of things. But you know, the prophet of God used this and one reason I like it so much is because the prophet of God used it. He believed this was the right correct book that it was right. It was it was correct. Amen. And God would of course vindicate it and prove it. So that makes a big difference. Amen. But my thought I want to just share with my thought. Amen. Beginning with uh I I was beginning to you know just to think about the word of God and before it was even before there was even the word even before the word. Amen. Back when way back when God wasn't even God. He was by himself and he was there alone with his thoughts. And I got to thinking of how that when you think about in tonight's service, I want to with the help of the Lord a little bit realizing that this is a service where uh and I uh I like that song. My faith looks up to the thy lamb of Calvary. Amen. My faith looks up to thee. So, I've been humming that song all all day almost cuz that's what we do tonight is we want to we I love to look at him. Don't you don't you like to look at Christ? &gt;&gt; Cuz having your eyes down on the world and the things of the world or down here, you know, it doesn't do much for you. It doesn't look you don't you don't get very far by looking at yourself or looking at your sickness or whatever it is. That don't do much for you. But look up. Amen. How many believes this causes us to look up? &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Benham and I'm going to read you a little story here and this will be the drama part. Amen. Brother Benham and taking us way back. Amen. He says, "Now, would you like to hear what I think about God become? Would you like to take a little trip with me for a few minutes? Have I got time now? Be reverent just a minute now and let me get this straightened out for you. Let's take a little trip in a little space now in a mental vision and go back a 100red million years before there was even a star in the sky by your mind. It was God. He always has been God. Amen. And then standing here watching creation come into existence. There's not a star. There's not nothing. And then let's notice out yonder. I see now all that space, all that is God. How many knows that he's omnipresent? He fills all time and all space. Amen. Omnipresent. He's omnisient, which is all knowing. Is that right? He knows uh how much tally a knat would make. I have no idea what tally is out of a knat. Do you? Nats make tally. All right. Well, anyway, apparently they do. Bible the Bible says tells us, did he? God knew just each gnat, every little bug, but every much how many times it would bat its eye. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Wow. How many believe? Now we're looking in the right direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at how great God is. Now, we realize that even Brother Bam said later in his ministry, he says, "Don't try to figure God out. You'll never figure God out." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, you know, he didn't make us to be able to figure him out. How can he know all this? How can be all powerful? And how can he be ever present? How can he do what he does? I have no idea. There's a lot we don't know. And uh so but it's the but the thing of it is is for us to believe him. That's what he does. Amen. Especially after proving himself. Aren't you glad that he come and prove himself? I'm here to tell you right now, if we wouldn't had Malachi 4, we'd be in bad shape. Amen. &gt;&gt; All the psychology, all the different religions and all of this and wondering, you know, and and and they don't, you know, they don't have the kind of signs and wonders that what the prophet of God God did through brother Bam. &gt;&gt; Is that right? But he come down and he showed himself real alive. So, so plain and so simple with the simplest I love him songs, only believe songs. So simple but yet come and showed himself alive and real. So I'm thankful for what God did. So he says here now notice you're standing there and this was in pillar of fire Joeboro 53 out yonder. I see all that space that all is God without form forever for eternities. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; eternities. How far back? &gt;&gt; How far back? We in our mind, if you want to blow your mind, don't think this thought. You can't think the thought, how did God start or where did he start? How can there be a being that never started? Because we are we are so uh birthday, uh death day, uh all the dates and everything is about time and beginnings and endings for us. But he never was never had a beginning that's unfathomable almost unfathomable. He never did begin. We want to say how many trillion years before he ever begin to think about what he wants to do. How long was it? Well, that's where we really don't really understand eternity yet, don't we? I think brother Brandham explained it to us a little bit. He tried to get us to fathom a little bit of what eternity is when he went beyond the curtain of time. When he went up there for 20 for about 20 feet up there and what did he say? He said there's no yesterday there and there's no tomorrow. You're just there. You've just arrived. And I don't know about you, but I long for that time. Haven't you ever had a really great time, a really good moment, and wish you could just lock that in for a while, but it ain't no time it passes. &gt;&gt; It's gone. Amen. For us that are 60 and above, we think about our youth. Oh my. And I was telling the boys the other day, I says, "Boy, if you're in your 30s, that's still prime time. 30s, you know, &gt;&gt; or 40s ain't bad. And I'm here to tell you, it's a nightmare when I think, Brother Brian, of Well, 50s wouldn't even be all that bad. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. They're gone. They're long gone. I'm turning I'm next month I'll be 64 years old. 64. Hello. But there there's no yesterday, there's no tomorrow. It's just eternity. Can't fathom. But that's God. Amen. There is no when did he start? He always was filled all time, filled all space. Noted everything. Amen. Forever for eternities. No beginning, no ending. It's all God. Before there was even error, there was God. The very beginning of the nature of the creation was God. Now the Bible teaches that the logos went out of God or I might say that God becoming his first body in the form when he was the logos that went out of God. Now another place he calls that logos a fire or pillar of fire. He also calls that logos Jesus. Is that right? the logos, the pillar of fire that went out of God. So where's God? We come out of God. Here it is. The pillar of fire. Now he's more invisible perhaps. And we know that Jesus, what did Paul see when he or he whenever the pillar of fire struck him down the light, he saw a light, he went back. I come from God, Jesus said, and I go back to God. In other words, I come from that logos or the pillar of fire and I go back to the pillar of fire. What do you think it was when he separated himself in the uh cloven tongues of fire? Ain't that right, upon each believer? So, where's God tonight? Well, we do want to go down that little alley, but we realize that God, I'm looking at God or at the temple that God is in. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; He's in each and every one of our hearts. Praise the Lord. I will not leave you comfortless. I will be with you even in you to the end of the world. So here the logos went out of God. Let's look what that looked like. No one has seen the father at any time nowhere. Never did and never will. But when the logos went out of him, he became like a little halo of light. And then he says, "Let's see him playing yonder like a child before the doorstep of the father." And now I see him. He moves over here and he draws his uh or in his mind a picture of what the world should be. Amen. No. So one of the things that brought me to this thought was first of all realize that when God he he has he's a fountain of all knowledge. And when God thinks he ain't like a bunch of businessmen, executives are having a bunch of executives get together and they mill around for an hour or two to try to figure out the best way to do something. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; You got to get the best heads and and do the very best that you can to try to figure something out. No, this won't work. I know that won't work. No, God don't have to do all that. His first thought is exactly perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if I'll get to say this, but I want to say this that tonight, if you don't get nothing else out of the service, be thankful that you are part of the program and the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's many things that God tells you well by how did Paul say um we know we are they are they that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God. Now he that hath not the spirit of God is none of his. Amen. So we know that we're his because of his spirit that's on the inside of us. So that's one way that you can know that you're part of God. Amen. All right. So maybe get into a little more of that later. But so he says, "Look now notice." All right. In his mind, a picture of what the world should be. Now there's not a star nor nothing. I hear him say, "Let there be." Amen. Let there be. See folks, do you realize how powerful Genesis 1 and1 is? In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. I was going to talk to you about the power, how powerful faith in this word of God really is. Ain't that right? The power of faith in this word. dictators, different ones might say they might teach evolution, Darvin theory, or whatever. But if you open this Bible and you believe it's God's word and you read just that, it'll tell you where you come from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that? It tells us where we come from, where we what we're here for, and where we're going. The only book that does that, ain't that right? See, in the beginning, 1 John 1 and1 says, "In the beginning was the word. The word was with God, and the word was God." Amen. All things were made by him. Without anything without him was not anything made that was made, things present, no matter what it is, there was nothing made that was made. How many knows that this here tells where everything comes from? Everything that ever come from anywhere tells you where it come from and who done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. My when I when I think about this, no wonder brother Brandham carried it right where? Right here. He carried it right here. Why? Because this this book is precious. This is the best thing that you have. This is the greatest thing you own. I'm reading uh a few few things that come up uh and and I'll probably read the quote yet, but in Christ the mystery of God revealed 1965, brother Brandham uh he said that this book right here is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. The complete revelation of God of Jesus Christ. And in there he says this is God in leather form. &gt;&gt; It's God in leather form. The words in here the Jesus said the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life. Most powerful words in the universe. Can we say that the most powerful words are right here in the whole universe? &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I I I'm just I'm just going to go ahead and keep going a little bit. That all right. You can open this Bible and you can read the words in here and actually have endless life. I say eternal life, but eternal life. We hear it so much to callous. Endless life, brother John, by simply opening this book and reading it and believing it. &gt;&gt; Endless life lays here. &gt;&gt; Everything that you ever have need of lays here. &gt;&gt; It's the Bible. &gt;&gt; The B I B L E. Yes, that's the book for me. I don't care how simple it sounds. It's still the book for me. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's still the greatest book in the universe. You know how many people known down through the dark ages and that have actually given their lives because they had perhaps been found with the Bible and wouldn't renounce it, wouldn't bow down from to the to the dictators and they would actually die gladly because they knew that the one that wrote this would take care of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. He said, "Let there be." And an atom broke out yonder. Amen. An atom broke out yonder because how many knows were put together with molecules, atoms, and so forth. And when it did, the some sun come into existence and began to whirl. And she burned for millions and millions of years. And after a while, I see a flicker clicker fly off of it. Brother Bam makes a noise. What was it? It was the first star that flew from the sun. He watches it fall for a few million years and he stops it. Amen. Now, we're going to have a long service tonight if I go to talking about all these stars because there's millions of them. Ain't that right? That's right. Went so far he knew where this side was supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Where that is supposed to be. Brother Glenn's nephew has that I forget that thing down in Dixon that we went to and they say that there's more stars there in than there is sand upon the earth. Can you imagine? Well, I'll just be honest with you. That's hard to believe cuz you know how many deserts there is and you know how thick that sand is? That's a lot of sin. Not just one country, but many different countries. Amen. Stretching my faith a little bit. Go look up there one time. It's absolute phenomena. Absolutely amazing. Even David talked about the creation. If you look at it, how it'll stand make you stand in awe. I stand I stand in awe of you. How many believe we should be in standing in awe of almighty God? One star way out there and then another and then another and then another and then until they were all there created the moon, the north star. [screaming] Brother Ben says he created and wrote his first Bible up there from the virgin to Leo to lion to the first and second coming of God. Christ wrote the Bible up there. Zodiac, all of that that's up there. Hung it all out there and it's still there. How many know those things don't shift around according to the prophet of God? No. If that moon got closer out of its place, why the floods had come over and everything else, everything it's stays in its place. Why? Because we look at God, this great being called God that is omnipotent, all powerful. I don't know about you, but it it did take a lot of power to keep all of them in their place, turning and revolving just the way that they're supposed to. How many believes that we need to have the Lord to help us to increase my faith? Lord, increase my faith. &gt;&gt; Then we wonder sometimes when we pray in God, we feel like God don't answer. Well, if I wonder if God is really with me. Does God still do it? And this, that, and the other. Hello. Let me tell you something. We serve a God that hung the star. They're still out there. He's more than able to take care of whatever you got coming, whatever happens. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. He flicker it and so forth. He watches it fall for a few millions, then stops it. Another one flies off and he lets it go for a few million years and stops it. What's he doing? Writing his first Bible, the Zodiac. Amen. God has wrote three Bibles. One was in the zodiac. One of them was in the pyramids and one on paper. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's glad for their Bible? &gt;&gt; That's right. We take it for granted. I mean, we take it too much for granted. And when you read it, you pray and say, "God, make this real to me." Amen. That's right. And then he goes talk about end starts with the virgin ends up with Leon Lion. But when he writes that, he says, "Man is to look up. God is above." And then after he gets all of the heavenly solar system written out, I see him moving over over a little clicker was this world. This little clicker was the world. And it was nothing but a iceberg hanging out. uh out of it and he moves over it like around the sun and as he begins to revolve it around he melts all the water off the ice off of it. The iceberg come flying through Texas was formed Louisiana and down through there where it scraped off as chronologicals tell us the icebergs went off over into the Gulf and so forth. Amen. And he begins to say speak how that the earth was formed, each country, continents and everything else. In another message, he talks about how that the Holy Spirit begin to brood over the earth. Ain't that right. Amen. And a little Amen. He said, "Let there be." And a little flower came up. Let there be. And something else happened all the way down to man. And he wanted to have man to be in his image which was in spirit form. How many know the first Adam? Amen. Was created a spiritual being. Spirit being. I've heard old men or older people tell me before, you know, the body's getting old, but that inward man, he don't get old. And I can testify that inside Thomas that does that guy don't get old. &gt;&gt; No. Uhhuh. It's not an age thing. It's in the spirit realm. It's this. It's the house that I'm in. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's what gets old. God created man in his own image. And then after that, he created him out of the dust of the earth to put him into it. Give him the five senses. And brother Brandon when planning all of this goes all into this and he had something in his mind. Ain't that right? But I mean know the first time first time God begin to open his mouth cuz God has a mouth. Brother Bam says, "Yeah, he does. He can speak. He has a finger. He can write the Ten Commandments. He spoke to Moses." But one of the first time God be to speak, man, I'm here to tell you things happened. The light shine. The earth was created. The sires were created. Warmth comes upon the earth. The animal kingdom was created. Everything was created according to Genesis 1. You were created. I was created. But says our dust. Amen. And what we come from and made out of, we was laying there in that dirt. Amen. When before he ever even melted the ice, we were here. Amen. But we think about it. God begin to speak. Now to think that there is a being that is absolutely perfect in knowledge. He is absolutely perfect in power. He is all present. To think of a great God like that. I And this is how I kind of come to my message. I thought what if that God if that person that being would speak? But if he would speak, wouldn't you want to know what he said and maybe write it down &gt;&gt; knowing that his knowledge is perfect and whatever he said, Amen. is going to happen. It's true. It's a absolute. How many know we need an absolute in this day in our day? &gt;&gt; We need something that's silent. Something that's a rock. And it's not Thomas B's words, but it's me repeating this right here. &gt;&gt; That's the rock. &gt;&gt; All other ground is sinking sand. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad tonight that in a world of confusion, there is unconfusion. &gt;&gt; There is clarity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God says, "My word will not come back void. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my word will never pass away. &gt;&gt; How precious. How many thankful to God? Amen. That when he speaks something, it's forever true. It's eternal. &gt;&gt; It can't be changed. All right. Before we get into the main part of our service, I want to just read you a quote where brother Bam talked about uh he was talking about the Bible. He says a lot about the Bible in uh Amen. And this one here didn't print it out for some reason. 1965 Christ revealed his word. But anyway, listen. Well, every denomination is an ultimate to believer to their believers. But to me and to the ones that I hope that I'm leading to Christ by Christ, the Bible is our ultimate. Amen. How many believe that? It has to be the ultimate. Amen. Let every man's word uh you know be a lying mind of truth. He said Paul said if come anybody come and preach anything other than what we've said if he's an angel from heaven let him be accursed. Amen. That's right. So he says that let every man's word be a lie of truth. So he says and I believe the Bible is God's ultimate. No matter what anybody else says, it is the ultimate. The Bible is not just a book of systems. No sir, not just systems, not a code of morals, but the Bible is Amen. He says it again. Not a book of systems. So many systems and so forth. No sir. Amen. And it's not all together a book of history. Amen. Isn't it something how you know it's got the history. It is. It is a book of history. But yet even the record of that history is still anointed. &gt;&gt; How many believes it's still anointed? All scripture is given by inspiration of God. It is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, righteousness. Amen. That's right. And brother Brandham in his message goes into great detail talking about how how that uh you know it's not like science and history of science and how they had you know that in the time of George Washington you know he said that if you didn't feel good if you was trying to get over something you know I'm not sure just what it was anymore but [snorts] they'd pull your toenail off and bleed a pine of blood. I don't know about you, but if I'm not feeling bad, please don't pull my toenail off yet on top of it. But they do it. And then the scientific talking about a ball, if he goes over the terrific speed of 30 miles an hour, it would go off the earth and fall off. He says they don't refer back to you to that. But he said he goes into detail talking about this wrote by 66 different people. I believe it was 66 books and so forth. and and over a period of thousands of years. And he says, there's no contradiction in it at all. And he says, you know, it's not a book of man because man would have never told about Abraham and Sarah and and Hagar and all these others. He wouldn't have said all these bad stuff. They wouldn't have wrote about David and all the things, the rascal things he did. Brother Bam goes into detail or all the adultery and everything else that Israel caused and did. No, but they wrote what they were inspired to write. Right. Amen. I believe it was Moses that wrote the book of Genesis. Can you imagine being under the anointing to just begin to write? In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Tell the whole story. That takes God. Amen. So he says, "So the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and it was wrote by prophets. Hebrews 1:1, God in sun dry times and spake to the fathers. Amen. in times past by the prophets has in these last days spoke to us through his son Jesus Christ. Amen. [clears throat] Let me see here. No author but God himself could be so accurate. Not one word contradicts the other one. remember 1600 years apart or so. Amen. Was the Bible wrote all the way to John on the aisle of Patmas. Amen. Now he says that's our Bible. Let other men's words fail. No man can add to it. You don't can't add to the Bible or take away from it. This is the complete revelation of it all. Brother Bam says like the seven seals. Someone kept saying to me, he said, "The Lord will speak to you, Brother Bannam, when those seals are revealed and you will tell us how to get closer to God." They were trying to say that you're going to write more Bible. Yeah. And how to do? I said, "No, sir. It can't be." Because the Bible, the seven sees seals on it had the seven mysteries hid. It was already wrote, but they don't understand what it is. Watch now how they plowed along with that being even baptized in Jesus' name. See, that wasn't is the name of Jesus, the Lord Jesus Christ is what it was. All those things cuz there's many Jesuses and I got several friends here on earth named Jesus, minister friends and so forth. Amen. But he was trying to say that they were trying to say that you're going to you're going to tell us something, you know, something new or different that's going to get closer. He said, "No, brother." Mommy knows he would know where they're going with it. He says, "No, you can't add to it or take away because he said this is a complete this is complete. If it's not the complete body of Christ, then guess what? Then you would need to uh finish the body or fulfill it. &gt;&gt; But it's complete." How many believes we have a complete book? &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, you know, that in the last days he came to Jesus. Amen. Amen. Now let's let's look for look at a few scriptures here. Amen. When when when Jesus Christ spoke, well actually let's go to first John first. First John it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. That's why we can say that this is God in letter form. another place. And and let me say this, I believe that this word, every every word in here is inspired. &gt;&gt; It's got inspiration. It's not a dead letter. No. Amen. Remember remember uh that I think I don't know if it was Billy Graham or one of those, Brother Graham didn't mention his name that was on a plane talking to a Muhammad and and they were talking about he says uh you Muhammad makes us happy, too. He gives us peace too. He gives us this that or the other, you know. And he debated with the man and says, you know, but your Bible says that the your Bible says that the works that I do shall you do also. So he he was saying, "So what about these works?" He says, "Well, we found out the man said to the man, he said, we found out that Mark 16 from the certain verse on where that was all in there, that wasn't inspired." That guy looks around. He said, "Really?" He says, "Well, I want you to know all the Quran sp &gt;&gt; and better said he just changed the subject." That man was defeated. &gt;&gt; But he did say he'll meet the he'll meet the wrong one day. Amen. He'll have somebody that will be able to show it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And didn't he do it in India? Is that right? Invited all of them come on and up here. That's what that was. How many know that was brother Brandham's ministry ministry was many times in his services. Now the Bible says St. John 14:12 the works that I do shall you do also and greater than these shall you do because I go to the father. Amen. Praise the Lord. So these words according to St. John 6 and verse 63 he says Jesus makes a statement it is the spirit that quickenth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life how many glad that every word it's spirit and it's life do you think that we claim even over in the old test Isaiah 53 3-6 Six. He was wounded for our transgression, bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his strife we were healed. How many believe I like I like the we e. Amen. Whether it's e whether were or are, it doesn't matter. I'll take either one of them. You are healed. You were healed. &gt;&gt; When he died on Calvary, you were healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you'll believe that, guess what? Something's going to take place. How many believe the word has, the Bible says one place, the word is n thee even in thy mouth. How many believe you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that word is in you. &gt;&gt; How many believe the logos or the not the logos, but the word that God spoke, Amen. It has to find a dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to this. Amen. See, one place he says, "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this." Anytime Jesus says, "He that believeth on me shall uh have eternal life." Now, and what is he? He is the word. Amen. We We don't have the physical body of Jesus Christ. didn't say I believe you. No, but he was the word. So if you believe this word, you're believing Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 3:16. John 3:16 is a promise of God. It's God's word. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. How many know that is the pardon? That's the pardon to the world. Brother Bram says all the way from Genesis to the Revelation from the first sinner whatever. Amen. Eve's beginning all the way to the end. It it it covers it all. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's the forgiveness for every sinner that's out there. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'll get to it, but Jesus says, "I didn't if if man does not hear my words," he says, "I judge him not." He says, "But the words that I speak, they'll judge him at that day." So the very words that Jesus said, they'll judge him one day. But that that wasn't his purpose of coming was to judge people. But yet the word will judge him. So guess what? Uh, John's 3:16. It's going to be presented to everybody. Didn't you ever hear it? &gt;&gt; I mean, glad for that. I'm glad for John 3:16 because he didn't put my name there. I'm glad he didn't put my name there. Said if Thomas Ber would believe in him, he should not perish but have ever I'm glad he didn't put my name there. Y'all wondering where I'm going, ain't you? If you know what brother Brandham taught. Brother Brandham said he he another man had once said he says I'm glad he didn't have that name there because there's many Thomas Bers might not be me but he said whosoever will that's me. I'm a who. Whoever wants to come let him come. But if you have a name there, guess what? It may be another one. There's many of them. That's what he said. And I thought that's right. Whosoever will coverth anybody that wants to. [screaming] Whosoever will, let him come and drink of the water of life freely. It's a pardon, right? This is a pardon. &gt;&gt; One of the things that I thought about when I was meditating on this, how sweet this book is. David said it's sweeter than honey in the honeycomb. There's honey in the rock. How many believe this is the rock? There's honey in the rock, my brother. There's honey in the rock for you. Amen. This is a good book. Not a bad book. It's a good a book of mercy. A book of grace. Amen. A book of forgiveness. A book of redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It tells you, Amen, about the fall of Adam, the fall of man. But praise be to God, it talks about a second Adam. I'm just glad for the second Adam to restore &gt;&gt; and to give us peace again to give us joy. &gt;&gt; Why? Because this world, I'll tell you right now, you get away from God any Amen. And you get away from the Holy Spirit and you deal with all the oppression and everything that there is in the world. It's a terrible world out there. I can say like brother Bam says, "Man, I don't know what I'd do if it wasn't for being a Christian. If it wasn't for this book, what will we do? [screaming] Where will we go? &gt;&gt; Praise God for the word of God. Praise God for Amen. Coming down to the mercy that he's had. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. The word of God, the Bible, he said, "These words that I speak to you, they are spirit and they are life." Praise the Lord. You know the thing about this the thing about this here word is that it has to be mixed by faith. You have to have faith. You got got to believe it. How many know it just doesn't do any good unless you believe it. And if you do believe it, well, all things are possible. There's nothing impossible to those that believe. No impossibilities anymore. All things are possible. But the scribes and the Pharisees, if you'll notice, it didn't do them any good. No matter. and and and talking about this great God that is all powerful and he actually raised Lazarus from the dead after that. They probably went to the funeral. Can you imagine going to a man's funeral and burying the guy and then about 4 days later he's walking around? Boy, you would have to have a cold heart to hate the one that did it. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; To not believe. But the Pharisees, they just could not seem to believe. Notice he said to the Pharisees, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the supplicants of the righteous and say, if we had been in the days of our father, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets." I thought, you know, there's one thing that this Bible, this Bible will do, and it will identify who you are. Whether you're a hypocrite, whether you're serpent seed, whether you're a buzzard, or whether you're an eagle. &gt;&gt; Hello. And how in this case, in this scripture, it tells you that what you do with the manifestation. See, a lot of people claim that they believe the word. Yeah, I believe the Bible. I believe the word. But the question is, do you believe the manifestation of the word? It's quite something how that brother Brandon when he was preaching the message about what I just read you and all it wasn't but a few quotes later that he talked about this fire and this pillar fire that came into his window when he was born. Ain't that right? That window it wasn't called a window. It was some kind of little door that they open and shut. But that light came down in there. People will believe that you know Mary was overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and so forth. and so forth. But they can hardly believe today that God might do something like that with somebody today. &gt;&gt; Or even Paul, they don't have a problem with that. But what about the voice that came out of the uh of the tree and said, "Don't drink or smoke or defile you." Can you believe the manifestation? Don't say you believe the word and then don't believe what it does. How many believe? You got to believe what it does. &gt;&gt; Amen. So notice here he's talking to them. You say, if you had been in the days, if we wouldn't have been partakers of them which uh in the blood of the prophets, wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers, ye serpents, you generation of vipers. How can you escape the damnation of hell? He says, "Wherefore, behold, I send you prophets and scribes and wise men. Some of them you shall kill and crucify and scourge in your synagogue." Amen. And persecute them from city to city. Amen. John 8. Okay. John 8. Another one. He was talking to the Pharisees. They answered him, "We be Abraham's seed." And were never in bondage to any man. How sayest thou, "Ye shall be made free." Jesus answered them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committh sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house forever, but the son abideth forever. If the son therefore shall make you free, you shall be in freed. I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you. How many is glad that there's place in your heart for the word? You receive the word. &gt;&gt; They couldn't receive the word. How? Oh my. If you can't, if you need healing and you can't accept Isaiah 53, you're not healed. How many knows that he sent forth his word and healed them? &gt;&gt; That's what he still does today. He sent forth his word, he healed them. God still sends forth his word and he saves people. He still sends Acts 2:38, "Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the promises to you, to your children, to them that are far off." &gt;&gt; How many believe that's still inspired? &gt;&gt; That's right. It's the promise. How many glad to be in the promised land? &gt;&gt; This is the promised land. Israel had their promised land. We've got our promised land. How many knows it's some good grapes? They had grapes. They had to have several men to pack them. What is the fruit of the spirit? Joy, peace, longsuffering. I hope you got so much it'll take about two of you to pack it. Brother Abram says, "Man, I he says, you know, I just need to be twice my size." He said, &gt;&gt; "I feel so good. I be twice my size. That's how good it How many glad to be free? How many glad to be have the peace of God in your heart? Why? How did it come? It came by the word of God. Why in the world do you think that preachers preach? They preach the word of God and it falls, Amen. on people right then and there and they receive it. It's much more powerful than an altar call is for the word to go forth and you receive it right there and right then. That's how we're supposed to get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the centurion. Amen. Had a soldier sick and so forth, I believe it was. And he said, "Just speak the word. I'm not worthy that you come under my roof." Man, that's a humble man. &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy that you come under my roof if you But I'm a man under authority. I know that if I say something, somebody's going to go do something. Ain't that right? He says, "I know that you're this under authority. I know that if you'll say it, it'll be." And Jesus marvelled at his faith. Be it unto you according to your faith. How many believe that goes for us tonight? Be it unto you according to your faith. Amen. Every promise. But I like that. Listen, because Abraham because the word didn't have any place in you. I speak that which I have seen of my father and do that which you have seen of your father. You do that which you have seen of your father. If ye be Abraham's children, you do the works of Abraham. Amen. Now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God. This did not Abraham. Oh my, I don't think I can get it right quick, but there was another one I really wanted to share. Here I am in the middle of this one. I need to finish this one first. There it is. All right. So he says u but you seek to kill me. This did not Abraham you do the deeds of your father. Then they said unto him, we be not born of fornication. We have one father, even God. It just goes to show it doesn't matter how religious you are if you don't recognize the God that's in front of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to call You want to call Abraham your father and God your fa I mean Abraham your the father of the faith so to speak children of Abraham and God is your father and then you absolutely want to kill the very Messiah when he comes. Jesus said unto him if God were your father you would love me. Amen. How many believe that? How many loves him? &gt;&gt; What does that mean? That means God is your father. &gt;&gt; I proceed and came forth from God. Neither I came of myself but he sent me. Why do you not understand my speech? Because you cannot hear my word. It's a terrible thing when the word when God speaks and that word can't penetrate somebody's life. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing. Can't change him. Won't change him. Amen. There he again says, "You're of your father the devil and his lust will you do on down." He says, "Which one of you convinces me of sin? If I say the truth, truth, why do you not believe me?" And here's the statement. Here's the punch line on that. He that is of God heareth God's words. &gt;&gt; Ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God. Another place I told you and ye believe not. the works that I do in my father's name, they bear witness of me. But ye believe not, because you are not of my sheep. As I said unto you, my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. Praise the Lord. How many glad for that? And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish. How many glad? Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. Another illustration, John 12 verse 44. Jesus cried and said, "He that believeth on me believeth not on me, but on him, wait a minute, but on him that sent me." Amen. How How much we can say that about the prophet of God? If you believe the prophet, you believe the pillar of fire. You ain't just believing the prophet, you're believing the God that sent the prophet. &gt;&gt; I am come the light of the world, and whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. Now, notice this is what I want to kind of stop with here. He that rejectth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him. The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him on the last day. That's not what I was looking for. It's the next one. For I have not spoken of myself, but the father which sent me, he gave me the commandment that I should say and what I should speak. Amen. Aren't you glad for that? John John 17 and13 it says and now come I to thee. It was Jesus's prayer where he prayed for those who would afterwards come and so forth. Now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them thy word. How many believe that when Jesus spoke, it was the father's words that he was bringing? It was God's very word that he was bringing, not somebody else, but God's word. And the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. And I pray that thou shouldest not take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world even as I am not of the world. How many believes that we are from somewhere else? We are coming from a different world. And then I don't know that I've got it but Jesus said one place he says at that day what will you know at that day you will know that the father is in me. I and the father you are in me and I am in you. How many is glad to be part of God, &gt;&gt; part of his thoughts, part of his being? Not just the word going forth out of his mouth, but we are part of that word. We're actually born, the Bible says, without going into too many things. He says we're born by the word of God. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand tonight. You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, as we come to the close of this service, speaking, Father, of your word, the Bible, simplicity, but yet it's the most powerful thing that there's on the face of the earth. a sinner finding this Bible somewhere in the side of the road or whatever it might be. If they could just open it and the grace of God would reach down and just open their eyes and help them to believe it, it could change them. Lord, it could change them from a sinner, a drunkard, a harlot, a prostitute, a gambler, somebody that's mean, Lord, to a beautiful person, to a good person, a kind person. Lord, this Bible has the power to change lives, change the universe. We know that this Bible right here is going to change this world, Father, from a world of sin. It's going to come and it's going to crush and grind to powder the kingdoms that are here now. Russia, America, China, North Korea, all the nations of the world will be ground to powder, Lord, when you come. The stone that was heuned from the word from the mountain, Lord. It'll come one of these days and it'll transform. But before that happens, God, we believe, go Lord Jesus, that you're going to take your people that's been redeemed by your blood that's believed your word, Father has taken it and allowed it to change them from what they are to what they should be. We ask, God, that you'd help us to be at that great day, Lord Jesus, at the rapture, at the resurrection, Lord Jesus, to be ready to meet you. For we believe it with all of our heart. God, help us to believe all of your word. For we know that our soul, as your prophet has said, hangs over hell by one of one word of God. To disbelieve one word could cast us off in hell. Lord, so we believe every word, God, that you have spoken. Lord, help us to live every word. Father, forgive us of our sins and shortcomings. Lord, we ask, God, that you lead us, Father. Lord, coming into winter now, Lord. It may be cold. It may be be get a little kind of stiff outside but Lord keep the tenderness of Christ in our hearts and in our soul. Keep us warm in your presence Lord Father through these winter months. Lord we ask God that you just bless each one now in Jesus name. Amen and amen. God bless you brother Brad. My God is awome.
