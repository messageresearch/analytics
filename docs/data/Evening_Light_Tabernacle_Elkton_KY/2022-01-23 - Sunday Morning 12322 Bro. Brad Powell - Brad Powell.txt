and your grace that you chose us before the foundation of the world lord lord no doubt we have many uh shortcomings many faults and failures but lord through the blood of jesus christ you accept us lord we thank you for that lord we just ask today as the word goes forth that you would reach down deep and search our hearts that you would pull out any impurities lord jesus anything that would hinder us from walking close to you and and being welcomed by your lord jesus we just ask that you would just pull it aside and and and annihilate it from our lives lord jesus we know that you're a you're a healer you're a savior you love us lord and you're a provider you do all these things for us lord and we decide so that you move today in a special way that you go up and down the aisles and the hearts just to draw us closer and we want to tell you we love you and appreciate you and as the word goes bring blessings upon the hearts of the believers jesus name we pray amen amen good to be in the house of the lord this morning amen we've got one that's glad to be here i want to speak this morning if i could if you're turning your bibles to the book of james chapter one little rita read a portion of service there how many is happy to be a christian this morning and man that's that's a little better uh so help us out this morning and we will try not to hold you long it's a little uh just to be honest with you a little evangelistic style message on my heart this morning so uh you say well you're gonna you're gonna be playing around in our living rooms well if a preacher don't play around in your living room you might not make it in his living room so just take it with a grain of salt and and take it as from the lord and trust me when when preachers preach to you they're preaching back to themselves uh multiple times so that's that's where it all starts so uh bear with us as we as we look at this thought james chapter one i think we're going to have a another little testimony after service uh did you mention that brother yeah so we're we like testimonies that means god's moving in people's lives that means god's doing something for the people and people are being motivated and moved by god so we we really like testimonies in the book of james chapter 1 james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ of the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greedy my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that we that the trying of your faith worketh patience that's one we don't like to read right there the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering no wavering nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord and the last one where we get our thought a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways let's pray heavenly father we just want to tell you once again we love you we thank you for the word we thank you for what you've done in our lives lord and we just ask now as the words went forth we asked uh the reading of the words went forth we asked that's the preaching of the word goes forth that it will prick our hearts lord to be drawn closer to your father and realize our shortcomings and our faults and that way we can get rid of those things in our lives and just walk closer to you we give you honor praise and glory in jesus name amen you can have your seats so i want to speak to you for just a little while this morning and i've probably got a couple of hours worth of notes but i don't think we're going to get to them all and we'll just go as the lord leads but i want to speak this morning on a simple thought of stability stability because i'm afraid that many christians this day and time we have a problem with being stable we have a problem with being stable in our word and we have a problem with being stable in our walk we have a problem with being stable in our life and and when you look at that you see that it's hard in this day we live in to be stable because satan has so much pulling against you and you can look and you see christians believers around the world around the united states around the world and you can look and you can see sometimes the core of their foundations being shaken and they begin to waver upon their beliefs they begin to waver upon what they've what they've taught what they've been taught what they've been what they think and what they believe for years and years they begin to waver and we might even say to the point of backsliding upon what god's word and his commandments are so when we look at this as we get closer to the coming of the lord it should be an urgency amongst us an absolute urgency amongst us that something would firm up our beliefs but satan being the mastermind that he is he comes in here and he begins to manipulate and work into our minds and he works overtime on our mind and if we're not careful we find ourselves going in two different directions and we find ourselves fitting into this scripture that james is talking about about unstable minds what is stability the definition of stability [Music] that has the strength to stand or endure the ability to stand and endure with firmness it says it says the property of a body that causes it when it's disturbed from a condition of equilibrium or a steady motion to develop forces or moments and i like this that restore it to its original condition we need stability in our lives because when we get in a place and we find ourselves unbalanced and we find our equilibrium you know that's in it naturally speaking it's in your in your between your ears and when you can't walk and you're out of balance but this tells us that's being stable there's something that calls you back to an original position when you can straighten up and stand fast that's god almighty and i like uh you say how do we find the stability i like what the prophet says here he says that's the way god does he's speaking in the uh as an eagle stir with her nest he says the way god does he fans the feathers out of you he fans the feathers out of you and he's got two wings god has he says you know jehovah eagle that's the new testament and the old testament do you see a balance we have to have a balance he says the old testament and the new testament and he finds them before you and he says i am the god of moses i'm the god of abraham and on this side he says i'm the god that raised lazarus from the dead i am he that was dead and alive and alive forevermore and he's fanning these wings amongst his eagles and the prophet said the eagles lay back there and they say how great thou are how great thou art how great thou art the old testament line up with the new testament i love that when that when that was revealed to me years ago that the old testament as a foreshadow of the new testament what a revelation and i thought there we was in the garden of eden the very first fall and there was a sacrificial land that was killed and lambskins placed around them as a covering as restitution for what they've done symbolizing what happened on calvary that's to come that a lamb will be slain and lamb is what we need for the stability in our life to make us stand firm and steadfast you know sometimes you look at this old and new testament if you're not careful you can get yourself in a little bit of a a pickle we we had baseball practice of the day one of our ball players his daddy's a pastor and he knows the word and he was just kind of making a little comment we were asking how he was doing stuff he said well coach i tell you he said i try to match myself or or pick out somebody to live behind the bible and he said i've been looking at these old testament guys and he said as soon as i get to doing good with them they fall off the wagon they say look at moses he didn't even make it in the promised land he said he looked at david he was a murderer and an adulterer and he said you look at sampson and he he cut his hair divided i said you need to start reading some new testament you need to start balancing out your life get a little bit of work and we were making a little bit like that but it's the truth we have to have the word old and new law and grace without the law how do you live ruthless uncaring without the law your rebels your renegades but because of the law you can walk a line it tells you what you should and shouldn't do but because we have grace now on the side and if you make a mistake it says i'm looking through blood-stained eyes brothers and sisters we look at what james was saying it's easy in our minds it's easy in our minds to look at what james was saying and say that's not me it's quiet didn't it that's not me i'm not unstable that's not me he couldn't be talking about me because i've been in this christian walk for years and years that's not me but let me ask you this are we are you further down the road than you were 10 years ago in your christian walk are you slipped have you slipped further away from where you was 10 years ago today we're going to be honest with ourselves if we're going to get closer to god because that's how we get closer to god so are you participating in things that 10 years ago you never would have participated in what changed did did god's word change and say you know what i've reconsidered this i've reconsidered this here and you don't have to live by this anymore i don't think god's word changed no man i don't think god's word changed i don't think he wants us participating in things that we've allowed to come back into our house why is it as christians this morning double-minded it means having the uh opposing views at different times so we can apply this to many areas in our life yeah we can apply this to many areas like i said why was it wrong 10 years ago but today it's okay why is it okay for me and not okay for you oh that's pitchfork there you can't look at this message today with a pitchfork you better be looking at it through the mirror because this is what god has called us to do to a higher calling we have we can't be double-minded because that's the same as having a double heart and the scripture tells us we can't be that way we can't have a double heart double-mindedness to the christian is a sickness it's a spiritual sickness and there's not a medication there's not a procedure there's not a surgery there's not a doctor in this world outside of the great physician that you can go to and say heal me of the spiritual sickness heal me of this instability in my life that i'm experiencing my christian walk if you find the pill i want it i'll be the first to take it jab me right here it's not there but it's something that has to happen deep down inside of here it's outside of a medical procedure but it's something that happens in our heart and we have to recognize and address when god has dealt with us then we have to step up and take action into what god has done because if not you know what happens we find ourselves slipping and you slip some more and you slip more and more and more until one morning you'll wake up and you'll say how did i get in this backslidden condition how did i let myself get so far away from god how did i lose my fire for god how did i lose my zeal for god how did i lose the passion and the love that i have for the day he saved me where did he go why am i dabbling in the world and when you wake up on that day you're gonna have to start going back through your mind what happened what happened where did this happen at it's subtle that's the way satan works it's so so subtle he begins to slip in here just little by little by little and brothers and sisters don't be so naive to think that it can't be you maybe it is you this morning maybe you're sitting here and this message is already starting to prick your heart and say man he is really running down my avenue today double-mindedness is a disease and it comes with symptoms the symptoms of instability and james tells us it's like a wave of a sea driven with a twin tossed and tossed and tossed you see they had to go back to stories and things that they understood and he knew what it meant to be out on the sea and the wind be tossing and tossing instability when you don't have your feet under you have you ever been in a boat it's not a fun experience when the boat is going up and down up and down and you don't know there's no stability there i've told the story before when we were out in the uh gulf there 30 miles off the coast and the storm come up and most of you know me know the story but my legs i come home with my legs that my ankles were this big around i look like i was eight months pregnant my legs were so swollen because of the pounding that we took instability of that boat up and down up and down and that's what james is saying it's no fun when your life is being tossed double-minded symptom is inconsistent are you consistent in your christian walk this morning or do you act one way today in another way tomorrow you know one of the greatest compliments i think anybody could ever pay me and i don't i don't know that i've arrived there yet but this greatest compliment that anybody could ever pay me was anytime i see you you're the same day after day after day that is a compliment there's very few people that can that can be said about because we live in a world where satan is constantly pulling and our anger and things that are going wrong in your life but can you stand firm in it in your day-to-day living can you stand firm when your life is unstable and your mind's unsettled you lack conviction if you find yourself not focused on the word you're going to lose your convictions if you don't focus your time daily upon the lord and upon the word and reading of the word and studying the word you're going to find yourself losing convictions because that's your private time that's your time that you get to sit down and you get to get quiet with god i'm going to get into that more in a minute and you'll see how important it is we need our quiet time he talks about that being tossed at sea and how unpredictable and how unstable it is but you know what they do you know what they do this is nothing new they drop that anchor at the first sign of a wind at the first sign of anything beginning to get terminus out there they drop the anchor and let that anchor take a hold of that seed bed and that's anchor holding onto the seabed begins to stabilize that ship and it begins to hold it through the waves where it rides the waves out calmly and you don't beat yourself to death we need an anchor in our life and that anchor is jesus christ we need an anchor to take a hold of our life i heard a guy say on almost a song the other day he said god says i let you off the line when god sets that hook in your jaw he's not going to let you off the line he's not going to lose you he didn't bring you this far to let you fall he didn't bring you this far to lose you to satan he's not going to lose one single soul to the pits of hell you can bank on that i was thinking about airplanes you know airplanes have to have a balance if they're not balanced they don't fly real good if you put too much weight up in the front you may not see it on a 747 but go get you on a little cessna 150 or 172 something like that and you let all the weight shift up to the nose of that plane you know what they say the plane's got attitude what's the attitude of the plane i'll tell you what the attitude of the plane is it's going down but if you'll balance out that weight into that plan it'll basically fly itself and that's what we have to do in life we have to be able to take and take the word of god and apply it to our life and balance us out sometimes people get so out of balance they get on the verge of fanatical on one way so far one way they can't see nothing but their way and only their way and everybody else is doomed to hell fanatical and then on the other side you've got the guy over here that says well we can do whatever we want and we don't have to have the word we don't have to have the message we don't have to have god it's because we've got god we've got grace fanatical but somewhere you have to find yourself in the middle of the road you have to be able to set your wings and fly i want to read to you some some little facts y'all know i read a lot but i want to read to you some little facts here this was a book i'm reading a little pamphlet little book it's god has a wonderful plan for your life and in this book this is talking about denominational world and and and so forth and it's talking about uh the mega churches that you see going on in the world now and the move of god and how and in a six year i think it's a six year span 45 million people professed to give their heart to the lord in these mega churches and churches and so forth but let me read to you what the survey the facts says and you said you're gonna think well this don't apply to us we're so far much farther down the road be careful be careful 45 percent who profess to be born again christians believe that gambling is morally acceptable 49 believe that living with someone of the opposite sex without being married is morally okay these are born these are these are professed christians 49 say they're comfortable with enjoying sexual thoughts and fantasies about someone uh one-third which is 30 33 of those professed to be born again thought it was okay to kill a baby while it's still in the womb one in eight abortions is by a professed born-again christian you think woo how could that happen how could we how could the world get in such a place like that yeah listen 46 percent of born-again adults believe the existence of absolute moral truth but 54 so at least 54 don't think that god has moral absolutes which explains why they live their lives as though there's no moral accountability at all you see what's happening here they begin to waver on what is morally acceptable they begin to wave around does god really have moral accountability and standards where are we at in the where are we at in the message as believers let's be careful we shouldn't be going back back god's calling us to come back to an original we're going back all right we're going back to the days of pentecost when that was that group in the upper room that's what god's looking for listen to what this guy this guy here he he's just he's just doing the survey this is his conclusion although most americans could consider themselves to be christian and say they know the content of the bible less than one out of ten americans demonstrate such knowledge through their actions with over 173 million christians in the u.s there are 10 millions tens of millions who say they love god and yet they're locators adulterers child murderers and paul's wanting to tithe its titus seems to be true in the modern church when they profess to know god but in the works they deny him that's an amazing introduction in a book i hadn't got to chapter two yet but when i read that i thought man this guy because the the title of the chapter was phenomenal growth and the world is having phenomenal growth the church denominations are having phenomenal growth 45 million people professor christianity in a six year period that's a lot of people and it looks like phenomenal growth until you look at what they're growing a person with a double mind lives by double standards and we say that person is two-faced double tongue four tongue deceitful treacherous people who are double-minded or not sought out for service in any capacity because they're not faithful so these people proclaim christianity and claim to be professing this if god can't use them who is if god can't trust them because they're double-minded who's using them satan is satan's having his way with them i mean the bible says that confidence in an unfaithful man in a time of trouble is like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint have you ever broke a tooth oh that's not fun you ever turned an ankle that's not fun and that's what kind of a trust and ability you can put these people they're going to waver because they're double-minded double-mindedness was a problem the early christians and james had to address it and it implies when you look at what james is saying he says they have a half-hearted allegiance a half-hearted allegiance now we stand to the flag of the united states or whatever country you're from and you have an ant and in ours we say i pledge allegiance what are you saying when you say you pledge allegiance you say i'm going to be loyal i'm going to be fully committed to this i'm going to be subordinate to a superior so when we pledge our allegiance to god we're plagued in our life we're pledging everything that's within us so when you have a double minded and you have a half-hearted allegiance you're saying god i halfway love you god i halfway believe you god i halfway trust you god i halfway want to live for you jesus says no man can serve two masters these are these are familiar scriptures aren't they no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to one and despouse the other you cannot serve god and mammon you can't have it both ways and what is mammoth man if you look it up it's it's the word that was given to a an object of false worship and devotion monetary how many people how many people let money drive their walk with god they let the dollar drive their walk with god everything is about the dollar they pray for the dollar they pray for for business they pray for this and it's constantly business business drive drive dollar dollar they're putting them in the church where is it putting them with people where is it putting them witnessing where is it putting them doing these things are they still in love with god the way they were before the dollar are they still attending church the way they did before the dollar because you know the prophet said if you let the love of god in your heart you can finish it you know it you'll be in the church every time the doors are open there's times i don't want to come i'm going to i'll be honest with you i'm an honest preacher that's one thing i'll tell you but i'll tell you the way it is if if it's happening to me i'll share it with you because maybe you're going through the same thing there's times i just don't want to call i think oh how can i get out of it i think my big toe hurts i might need to prop that up tonight but that's not what god is looking for god you may have those thoughts but god is looking for the person that says i don't care if my knees are broke i'm going to try my best to be in the church house because that's where he works on us that's where he builds us that's where he molds us and makes us and we grow in christ it's right here in this church house we need preachers that are on fire for god and will tell us this kind of truth we need preachers who will stand for the old gospel religions who will preach the word of god and draw us close to him and get sin out of our lives sin should have no place in a christian's life you say well you're saying we're thought that'd be faultless no i'm saying you need to be forgiven you need to be the caliber you need to get to the bottom of that cross and let blood run down over you and you say god i'm sorry for what i've done help me to never do it again so double-mindedness we got to get away from that thought we got to get away to a thought of singleness of heart and a mind you know acts and ephesians colossians speaks about that we have to have a single mind or a heart that is in service for god a heart that will seek god and serve god with our whole heart and our whole being read through the psalms he'll see it over and over and over again talks about seeking the lord with all that's within you and the bible says to seek and serve god wholeheartedly love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might he didn't say a portion it didn't say i'm going to give this half to god in this half to satan one heart servant with all that's within it the double-minded person don't do that the double-minded person can't love god with all this within him but i want to be that person that says god everything i have is yours everything i live for is to live for you that's what i want to be and if you're not in that place here's how you get there james tells the christians who are double-minded purify your hearts you that are double-minded purify your hearts come to a place where you fall down before god and ask for the blood to cover you you know a lot of times and it's easy around message churches we leave god out of stuff we need jesus christ we leave calvary out of stuff and when we get away from our churches get away from jesus we're in trouble every preacher every sermon i personally feel like ought to preach the cross jesus christ bloodshed on calvary shall be preached every single service in the church house because that is what we're here for that's what saved us that's what doesn't place in a position we're in it's jesus it was his decision his choosing how do we do that how do we get how do we get good we get rid of the carnality in our lives we get rid of the carnality in our lives we get rid of the worldliness you say what is that we hear this but what is that carnality is your passions it's just things that you're sensual about it's your appetites it's the things that you think i got to have this it gives me pleasure and i'm not talking about spiritual pleasure that's carnality carnality is wanting things of the world we need spiritual minded people not temporal not temporal minded things you know every every bit of things we got right now you tell me one thing you're going to take with you [Music] yup tell me one thing i'll give you the farm if you tell me one thing you're gonna take with you outside of your soul yeah but it's only when christians seek and serve god in a singleness of mind and with all their hearts and seeking and serving in sincerity is when we get closer to god and i have to venture out and say anything outside of that you're lukewarm yeah let me say that again maybe i'll get some help anything outside that you're lukewarm thank you prophet says this listen to this this he says when i first came to you amongst your groups 10 years ago notice the time 10 years ago it looked like a church in 10 years time you know 10 years is a flash [Music] happy birthday brother baller we were just talking in the study it was his birthday yesterday so everybody make sure to tell him happy birthday but we were talking about in a flash he said 50 to 60 went by in a flash he said i know 60 to 70 is going to go by even faster so the prophet says in 10 years time it looked like a church but today it looks like the world he said because something happened somewhere you got to wearing better clothes now he wouldn't talk about upping your dress code he's talking about upping your style you got to wearing better clothes you got to make a little more money and it made a sap out of you in 10 years time he said now that's the truth he said you're trying to act like the rest of the world because he says today is a compromising time you paint your steps red and watch what the neighbor paints their steps you've heard this story but how much more true is it today in the day we live in everybody wants to one-up somebody you wear a little round church with a feather he says and all the women wear a little round hat with feather they're trying to look like each other somebody they all want to look like each other he said it's matching time you know he said it's matching time he said that must have went went home he said because it's true and i'm going to tell you my brother i don't care whether my shoes match my trousers or my trousers match my coat i want my experience to match god's bible that's matching time i sent something on the on the internet the other day and it was morgan freeman's quote probably knowing if you've watched any movies at all but he said you know he said it don't matter he's talking he's a realist in his mind he really thinks like a realist he's you know it don't matter if you don't wear name brand clothes because you got to put your children through school and i thought whoa that's that's a big statement come from somebody who's got more money he could burn a wet mule with a millionaire he says it don't matter if you wear name brand clothes but church some reason we think got to keep going one up and one up and one up but brother branham says what we need today is a matching time with paul's faith we don't need to match each other we're all different we all have different jobs different different abilities different gifts we don't need to match each other we need to match what god done we need to match what paul's word says and find ourselves matching there he said if you're a saint act like a saint if you're a saint walk like a saint if you're a saint dressed like a saint talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a saint shout like a saint live like a saint die like a saint and go to heaven like a amen but it's separating time he says there's no more time for this lukewarm halfway christian and that's that lady i'll see a church a spirit that come in and it makes god so sick at his stomach i don't want to be that person that makes god sick at his stomach i i've done it out of curiosity one time i can drink cold water and i can drink hot water but you give me that warm water oh boy it makes me just oh right here thinking about it there's something about that luke warmness that you just can't stomach it and so god you can be on fire for god or you may be in the gutter for god and he'll he can deal with you but when you come to him and you act like you're somebody that you're not and you've got this double mind going that i'm living here one day and here one day and people think i'm this but i'm really this you're really upset in his stomach you're really upset in his stomach and he's coming to a place that he's just about to respew because laodicea it's just enough religion he says to make you sick and he said the problem is we're still longing for things of the world and say i better not do that so he didn't say they did it he didn't say they was doing the things of the world he said they were longing for things of the world he said they were longing to say ah better not do that they're questioning in their own lives but you see well you see how tender this is you see how how easy we have to walk around this because if we're not careful in our minds what's going on come on things of the world go on up here because this is a battleground and things of the world is going on up here but you got to get to a place that you don't even question it you say that's not me because i'm a saint i'm one of god's children i'm going to do the things of god i don't do that kind of stuff he says it you don't see people singing them old-fashioned songs the way they used to sing you don't see their faces light up anymore and sing and clap and raise their hands and praise god and pray all night and lay out in the cornfield and things wow you can't even sit in church 30 minutes without grumbling and gross don't raise your hand how many looked at you watch just kidding he says you can't stay in church 30 minutes without grumbling and growling it's the truth because we're living on the borderline lukewarm layout to see it and shame on you you say why does it matter so much because we are god's mouthpiece you say well i'm not a preacher i didn't say you was i said you was god's mouthpiece when trials come your way when struggle hits your life when cancer hits your family when financial troubles take you down people look to see how you react they want to know how does that guy at evening light tabernacle how does he handle those situations he talks a big game but does he walk a big game can he play a big game hmm people look at you and they say okay here we go he's either fixing to have to put up or shut up yep that's the way they look at you well they want to see what you're doing so that's why it's so important that the world when things come our way they see jesus they see that you turn to god that you don't turn to alcohol you don't turn to to drugs you don't turn to pornography i didn't read everything that's in there because i skipped it but it just come to my mind i think i'm going to share it and this little booklet's talking about listen is this promise keepers they promised to be committed and practice spiritual moral ethical and sexual purity in this poll they took 53 percent of those men visited porn sites every week and you're going to tell me i think real why do people want to dance and tiptoe around that a lot of people want to tiptoe around let me tell you pornography will ruin your life it'll ruin your marriages it'll ruin your children and it's not just man it's women too i've read the stories in the articles where women are so intrigued and so taken in by the spirit pornography that they're bound and they they they ruin their lives i read a story of a young teenage girl who started in pornography at 13 years old and she was addicted every single day to watching pornography till she was 20 years old she couldn't get married because she didn't feel worthy she felt trashy she lost her friends all in a hidden secret life and you say well we're in the message wake up wake up people it's one of the biggest things that the satan has used in this century is the cell and the prostitution of women and men on screens it's the truth you don't believe me you got tick-tock you got facebook you got those what kind of slides pop up out of the blue yeah you ain't done nothing wrong but just out of the blue here comes somebody half dressed yeah it goes back to what brother daniel was preaching we got to be careful with them phones we got to be careful with this technology because satan is the master of technology we use it as christians as believers it's a wonderful thing [Music] but let satan get ahold of it and you've got visions in your mind that you cannot get rid of i'll tell you from experience as a young man i've seen things i looked at things i shouldn't have looked at as a 16 17 year old i looked at those things you think those visions don't still pop up you think you still don't have to fight that you'll find it till the day you die and if you don't and you've done it you're telling a story you have to fight it and it's a scar and it's a battle that you carry in your life kind of got off there but somebody must have needed it if you're involved in it get away from it as fast as you can [Applause] but god in all times in all circumstances never gets unstable did you think about that in all times in all circumstances god never gets unstable you think about in the garden of gethsemane when he goes down there and he tells his disciples pray for one hour i need one hour power and he goes in and he begins to pour out his heart knowing what's fixing to happen and god is sitting there unwavering and standing upon the promises it's a promise he was gonna die yeah but he was also standing on that promise that if i die i'll save millions and he stood there stable and unstaggering and unwavering as he sat there and prayed in the garden of gethsemane and all he asked is for the others to give one hour what they give 15 minutes 10 and they were out but not jesus so with jesus there's no reason there's no reason for you to be anxious about your future you say i've got all these instabilities in my life the country is going to the pots what are we going to do you know we preach this a lot because it's a real thing we really do have problems we really have problems when we haven't really had no natural outside of the tornado that come through here but that didn't affect what i'm about to say we have we have problems when you go to the grocery store and there's no meat on the shelves and there's no eggs on the shelf and there's no milk on the shelf we got problems when nothing spurred that have you been shopping lately it's tough we went to walmart and man walmart's supposed to have everything right we went in there and they didn't have a chicken wing i don't know if they had liver and gizzards people don't got desperate but with god with a stable god we don't have to worry about those things you don't have to worry about your kids you don't have to worry about your family you don't have to worry about struggling in your own personal relationships you don't have to worry about the balance in your bank account you know without worry it's a fun place to live and i try my hardest not to worry i mean i really try my hardest and my dad bless him he's probably watching and he says he he wonders what i'm what's going to come out of my mouth when i call his name but he's always conscious of everything because he's been through sometimes but we have to all get to a place to where worry i can't take thought of what tomorrow will bring i don't know what's going to happen tomorrow i may not make it through the night i may not make it one mile to the house i don't know so why do i worry about what's about to happen yeah we have to do our business we have to have concerns but i have to put my stability in what god said that he'll never leave me or forsake me he'll be with me even in me to the end of the world so what is there to worry about believers have no cause to worry so whatever it is in your life that you're worrying about and you're feeling unstable give it to god keep looking up to god look up to god and not to ourselves and there you'll find stability there's a song that says if you've got a problem it's too big to solve stop looking the man start looking to god because i know for certain there's not a thing i can do but there's not a mountain that my god can't move those are inspiring words i've not seen a mountain that god cannot move no i've not seen a problem he won't carry you through i just call on the master and watch what he'll do because i'm not seeing a mountain that my god can't move why worry why worry the bible says that i've set the lord before me always because he is at my right hand i shall not be shaken he didn't get that not walking with the lord notice what he said i said the lord always before me always before me god is first god's my priority you know i found out in life i'm pretty insignificant when it comes to myself because god's first then my family my wife my kids then if there's anything left for me there it is responsibilities but if you set god before you he's at your right hand and you will not be shaken therefore my beloved brethren listen to this be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the lord knowing that in the lord your labor is not in vain that's assurance that's assurance when you get up in the morning and you know that you're going to do something for god and you're sitting there and you feel like you're all alone but it says god your labor in him is not in vain that he's there with you jude says now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy to the only god our savior through jesus christ our lord be glory majesty dominion and authority before all time and now and forever wow just a couple more and then we're going to quit i'm about halfway through prophet says if a man ever anchors his heart against the heart of calvary listen now you know i talked about going to the foot of foot of calvary right there grab a hook of that cross and don't you ever let go of it if you hear your heart right there at calvary all devils in hell will never ever shaking no more what an assurance we have at calvary i'm talking about a real born-again bloodshed tear shed experience where you know that you know you've come in contact with god not just a profession not one of the 45 million that said i'm going to give my heart to god and i'm going to go sin i'm going to do whatever i want i'm never going to have a change i'm not talking about that i'm talking about a real born-again experience when god pricks your heart and you get closer to god don't be tossed about with every wind of doctrine believe god's word get stable get it he said how you do it brother branham here it is he said many remember in the old testament the outer courts of the fell you remember that the manna fell the children of israel were hungry they were on a wilderness journey they were hungry god feed us moses cried out and manna fell well they picked up that manna and they would nibble on that manner he said it was kind of like a little honeycomb and when he says that i picture the cereal honeycombs so here they are picking up honeycombs and they're eating them he said they're having a real experience they're eating these little honeycomb manna and they're eating them and they're eating them or eating them but he said you know what happens they find themselves hungry and the manna has perished in a 24-hour period all the manna has perished but he said he told moses you go and you take this little golden armor and you gather up that manner and put it in that armor a little chalice a little cup of some sort fill that up and when you get that full i want you to take it into the holies of holies and i want you to put it in the holies of holies and you said it right behind the ark of the covenant and it never did perish the whole time that armor of manna of a little honeycomb was sitting there ready to be eaten why is that because when you get yourself into a place with god in the inners of inners in the holies of holies there's no death that can come in the presence of god because only life is in front of god aaron the high priest listen to this he walked into the curtains he walked into the holies of holies and the curtains fell behind him he was surrounded all in a place all to himself and god alone and he was in a sacred place aaron was in a place that if anybody entered without the permission of god if you went in the high priest they drug you out by the heels of your feet but aaron found himself in there as the high priest and he goes in there and he gets with god and the prophet said that's where any man and woman that's been born again should find themselves we got to get ourselves into a place that we go into the holies of holies in the inner court and let the curtains come down around us and it doesn't matter what's going on around us it's you and god and you and god alone so that god can speak to our hearts consecrated we don't like to hear that because i'm going to tell you that takes time that takes commitment it takes dedication but if we could get ourselves in there and quit fashioning ourselves after the world he said because christianity is a sacrificed life and that sacrificed life is hidden through god through christ and sealed by the holy ghost that's what a christian life consists of listen now as i'm closing it's not how well you do this it's not well how you how well you sing it's not how well you preach all those things are good we like good singers we like good preachers he said but it isn't that at all it's hidden life consecrated to god it's a hidden life consecrated the veil the curtains dropped around you and you're dead in there you're buried and you're hidden god through christ sealed in there by the holy ghost brothers and sisters we all need that experience i don't mean just once i mean on a day-to-day basis we've got to find ourselves hidden away with god if not we lose our convictions i'm telling you it don't take but one day to get away from it and it's you start slipping because it's the age we live in you might have got by with it in the 40s and the 50s and 30s and the 20s living out on a farm somewhere but you know brother brown told the story about the old man that raised hogs and he said that old man come to him and he just kept talking about his hogs we raised hogs my granddaddy raised hogs my daddy raised hogs i raise hogs i'm teaching my kid how to raise hogs we pay the bills raising hogs and brother brown said did you ever think god set you here to do something besides raising hogs he said it don't matter if you're a factory worker it don't matter if you work in the log woods we do things around we don't matter if you farm it don't matter if you're a carpenter or if you work at a school it don't matter if you work in scrap metal it don't matter did you think god may have sent you here to do some more than that because i can guarantee you that's not god's number one objective to say i'm gonna make him the most successful registered nurse that i ever walked that's not what he said about me that may be my trade that may be what i learned to do that may be what puts a little food on the table but god didn't call me here to do just that god called each and every one of us here to be a witness to give a testimony to be something that he wants you to be to be a shining light in a sick and dying world that's what god wants he wants stable let's stand i'm just going to have to quit it's just by our heads musicians if you'd like to come spout our heads let's just take a moment to just get serious with god you know this kind of preaching sometimes steps on our toes and it pricks our hearts but if we're not challenged by the word of god and the life we're living we're not going to move any farther with god that's why there's a call that keeps calling come up higher come up higher come up higher we can't be satisfied with worldly things because if you're not careful that becomes your priority that becomes your first and foremost and all the things that god begins to be put on the side burner so we have to find ourselves in a place that no matter what happens no matter what we go through no matter what the temptations what the trials we find ourselves steadfast and strong and stable and stable in the word of god because that word never fails that word never wavers that word never will hinder but that word will make you stand fast and strong if anybody here this morning would like to just raise your hand to god and say god i need this morning to find myself more stable i need to find myself letting go of some of the things that's been pulling at me i find myself need to let go of some of the things that's been hindering my thoughts and my walk my family life my walk with my children my walk as a father my walk as a mother but first and foremost i need to get rid of those things that are hindering my walk with you god and i raise my hand god and i say pull the curtains down around me god pull those curtains down around me where i can find myself in the inner court and just come down and speak to me lord talk to me gently talk to me in such a way god that we commune lip to ear so that i could be what you would have me to be hands all over the building this morning there's a group of people here that wants to get closer to god there's a group of people here that's longing for a home a city whose maker and builder is god that's the way we get there it's a daily consecrated life with god [Music] lord we just dedicate ourselves to you through the preaching of the words that went forth this morning may it just continue to burn and prick our hearts and burn in our hearts through the weak that if we find ourselves slipping then we just march right back in time march right back in order get ourselves back in line [Music] not just on sunday morning not just on a wednesday evening service but on a daily consecrated living schedule of life living for you on a day to day basis lord lord we love you with all of our hearts this morning we wouldn't preach these kind of messages if we didn't love you lord because it's our desire to never fail you lord we fall short so many times lord lord in our faults and our failures we anchor to calvary because as long as you can see the blood-stained eyes that barrier that wraps around the world my life is as white as wool [Music] free from sin as though i've never done it and that's an assurance we have lord forgive us when we fail you lord draw as close we pray we love you with all of our hearts this morning lord in jesus name we pray amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] but it's always good [Music] [Music] young people that god's doing something in their hearts that's always good amen and so we're so thankful to see that amen [Music] amen a lot of pressure but anyway we do appreciate um um [Music] [Music] foreign um foreign um [Music] is [Music] okay [Applause] he had [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi [Music] my [Music] [Music] so [Music] channel [Music] is hey this problem you
