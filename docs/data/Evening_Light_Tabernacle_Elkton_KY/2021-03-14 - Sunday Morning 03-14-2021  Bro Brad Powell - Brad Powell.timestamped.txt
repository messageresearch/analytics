[27:19] in prayer
[27:21] gracious heavenly father we thank you
[27:23] lord for this day you've given us for
[27:24] your
[27:25] many blessings lord for the opportunity
[27:28] you've given us to
[27:29] speak to your people lord and lord what
[27:31] a honor and privilege and
[27:33] responsibility it is lord to open the
[27:36] word and
[27:36] and break it forth to the people or we
[27:39] just trust that what you've laid on my
[27:40] heart what you've inspired me to preach

[27:43] i just pray lord that your inspiration
[27:45] would come down

[27:54] in numerous ways father and lord we just
[27:57] want to give you honor praise and glory
[27:58] for all you do for us lord
[28:00] we commit the remainder of this service
[28:01] into your hands in jesus name
[28:03] amen amen if you would turn in your
[28:06] bibles to
[28:07] psalms i'm going to look at
[28:11] just a little psalm here and and
[28:14] try to break it down and i tell you when
[28:16] it when it opened up to me the the
[28:18] psalms 27 is where we're gonna go
[28:21] and when i looked at psalms 27 i
[28:23] certainly didn't go in the
[28:25] didn't in my mind wasn't going to go the
[28:27] direction that we ended up going
[28:29] but as i began to look at it and opened
[28:30] up and the lord just really i feel like
[28:32] led me in a direction that
[28:34] i trusted it would be a blessing and a
[28:36] help to somebody just
[28:37] one person i know uh young when i was
[28:40] just young 20 in my 20s i got to spend
[28:42] some time with brother biscuit and
[28:44] one of the wisest things i think that
[28:45] was ever told to me
[28:47] especially from brother biscuit uh he
[28:49] said you know he said brother brad every
[28:50] time i step
[28:51] up to the pulpit and i go before the
[28:53] people he said always just say if i can
[28:55] help just if it'll help just one person
[28:57] it'll be worth it all and so i just
[29:00] trust this will be a help to you
[29:02] um i know your turn there just kind of
[29:05] get a thought of the direction i'm going
[29:06] i've got a little story here it's
[29:08] it's not really a comet comedy or a
[29:09] little comic but it is just a little
[29:11] story
[29:12] but there was a man that said to his
[29:14] friend he said i'm really in trouble
[29:16] he said i have a mountain of credit card
[29:17] debt i've lost my job my car is being
[29:20] repossessed
[29:21] my house is in foreclosure but i'm not
[29:23] worried about it
[29:25] he said how can that be he said well
[29:27] i've hired a professional warrior
[29:30] he does all the worrying for me and and
[29:33] his friend
[29:33] replied he's that's fantastic how much
[29:35] does this professional warrior cost you
[29:38] and he said it's fifty thousand dollars
[29:39] a year he says wow that's expensive
[29:42] where are you going to get that kind of
[29:43] money and the man replied and said i
[29:45] don't know that's for him to worry about
[29:48] so as we look at this scripture here
[29:50] psalms 27
[29:51] i want to title this no worries because
[29:54] as believers as christians
[29:56] we truly shouldn't have worries we
[29:58] shouldn't be worried we shouldn't be
[29:59] nervous and anxious and
[30:01] and have fearful events so we want to
[30:03] break this down if we can
[30:05] psalms 27 the lord is my light and my
[30:08] salvation
[30:09] whom shall i fear the lord is the
[30:12] strength of my life
[30:13] of whom shall i be afraid
[30:16] when the wicked even my enemies and foes
[30:19] came upon me to eat upon my flesh
[30:22] they stumbled and failed though in host
[30:26] should encamp against me my heart shall
[30:29] not fear
[30:30] the war should rise against me in this i
[30:33] will be confident
[30:35] one thing have i desired of the lord
[30:37] that i will seek after
[30:38] that i may dwell in the house of the
[30:40] lord all the days of my life
[30:42] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[30:45] inquire in his temple
[30:47] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[30:49] me in his pavilion
[30:50] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[30:53] hide me
[30:54] he shall set me up on a rock and now
[30:56] shall my
[30:57] head be lifted up above mine enemies
[31:01] round about me therefore will i offer in
[31:04] his tabernacle
[31:05] sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will
[31:08] sing praises
[31:09] unto the lord god bless the reading of
[31:11] the word you can have your seats
[31:13] i'm going to continue reading just to
[31:14] finish up through the rest of this
[31:16] chapter
[31:17] but listen closely as we continue to go
[31:19] forward hear o
[31:20] lord when i cry with my voice have
[31:23] mercy upon me and answer me
[31:26] when thou saitest seek ye my face my
[31:29] heart said unto thee
[31:30] thy face lord will i seek hide not thy
[31:34] face far
[31:35] from me put not thy servant away in
[31:37] anger
[31:38] thou hast been my help leave me not
[31:41] neither forsake me o god of salvation
[31:44] when my father and mother forsake me the
[31:46] lord will take me up
[31:47] teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a
[31:50] plain path
[31:51] because of mine enemies deliver me not
[31:54] over unto the will of my enemies for
[31:56] false witnesses are
[31:57] risen up against me and such as breathe
[31:59] out cruelty
[32:00] i had fainted unless i had believed to
[32:03] see the goodness of the lord in the land
[32:04] of the living
[32:06] wait on the lord be of
[32:09] good courage and he shall strengthen
[32:13] thine heart wait i say on the lord
[32:19] so the prophet said this and speaking
[32:21] about david as we get going now
[32:23] he says oh my look over there that day
[32:25] when the enemy was coming in on david
[32:28] and we and all david did was give him
[32:30] some wine and a piece of meat and bread
[32:33] and the enemy was coming he's talking
[32:35] about his own people the enemy was
[32:36] coming
[32:37] and he didn't know what to do he said he
[32:40] gathered up
[32:41] all the people of israel there and
[32:43] gathered him up and they lifted up their
[32:45] hands and said
[32:46] god you are our god you have protected
[32:50] us
[32:50] you have brought moses the prophet and
[32:53] you have brought the children of israel
[32:54] out of
[32:55] egypt you brought them through the
[32:56] desert
[32:58] he's identifying who they are and who
[33:00] god is so david here is putting himself
[33:02] in a place of saying
[33:03] god we know who you are we're not going
[33:06] to worry
[33:07] we're going to drink wine we're going to
[33:08] eat bread we're gonna eat meat the
[33:10] enemy's coming
[33:11] i'm not worried because i've seen what
[33:13] you've done in the past
[33:16] so here they sit there and they say you
[33:18] know we're the minority
[33:19] we're the minority in this but everybody
[33:22] that come upon them
[33:24] was afraid to touch them because david
[33:26] said he laid there and he said
[33:27] oh god how great you are we've sinned
[33:32] he admitted his faults we've sinned and
[33:34] here lays our children
[33:35] and our wives and we're coming before
[33:37] you crying out
[33:38] what can we do the enemy's coming so now
[33:42] they're sitting there
[33:43] and brother branham said as he was
[33:44] praying the spirit fell down there on
[33:47] the audience
[33:48] and he and someone prophesied and said
[33:50] thus saith the lord you'll not fight but
[33:52] you'll stand
[33:53] he said they'll go down there a certain
[33:55] way and god caused confusion upon all
[33:58] those soldiers that they just went and
[33:59] they killed themselves
[34:01] they never laid hand never laid sword
[34:03] never laid anything upon david or his
[34:05] people and brother brown said that is
[34:07] the predestinated
[34:08] chosen people of christ
[34:12] looking at the scriptures today and
[34:13] reading we're going to look at the life
[34:15] of david
[34:16] and no no doubt the life of david was a
[34:19] life filled with uncertainty
[34:21] it was a life filled even from a small
[34:23] child we're filled with situations full
[34:25] of fear
[34:26] and worry and anxiety that was the life
[34:29] that david come up through
[34:31] he had to overcome those challenges so
[34:33] how did it control
[34:35] his emotions how did he control the
[34:38] worry
[34:39] and and those anxious moments in life
[34:41] when he sat in there and the and the
[34:43] enemy is surrounding him
[34:45] whether it be a lion gonna take his his
[34:47] flock whether it be a bear
[34:49] whether it be a a giant that he has to
[34:52] that that he has to slay
[34:53] where there is this the army of saul
[34:55] coming after him to kill him
[34:57] how does he overcome these emotions how
[34:59] does the fear
[35:00] not take him down i could imagine myself
[35:04] that david would be an absolute nervous
[35:06] wreck
[35:08] put yourself in his shoes how would you
[35:10] feel how would you feel if you were
[35:12] constantly in a battle
[35:14] that everything you'd done was
[35:15] constantly a battle and you were having
[35:17] to fight your way through it not knowing
[35:19] what the true outcome would be
[35:20] but having to believe
[35:24] we're talking about lions bears giants
[35:29] we're talking about kings with armies
[35:32] what about when his own son came after
[35:34] him
[35:38] how would that make you feel how would
[35:39] your emotions rage then
[35:41] so the psalms 27 as we look at this
[35:44] we say that this is a cry for help this
[35:47] is a cry that david is putting forth and
[35:49] david is declaring his beliefs
[35:51] that in the greatness of god and he
[35:53] begins to trust
[35:54] in the protection that god provides in
[35:57] in psalms 27 they think it is written in
[36:00] the early part of david's life
[36:01] when he's in flight from king saul now
[36:04] to keep in mind that this psalm is
[36:06] written in two sections
[36:07] one through six and seven through
[36:09] fourteen
[36:10] one through six it declares the power of
[36:13] god
[36:15] and the boundless hope that god will
[36:17] bring rescue
[36:18] and protection from all enemies go back
[36:21] and read one through six and you'll see
[36:23] how that god is gonna provide over and
[36:25] over and over and that's what he's
[36:26] saying you are my light you're my
[36:28] salvation you're my
[36:29] healer you're everything i need
[36:32] 7 through 14 is the second portion
[36:36] after david has declared all this stuff
[36:38] now he's saying and i believe it
[36:40] i believe it it's more than just words
[36:42] on paper but
[36:43] now i believe it i know you are who you
[36:46] say you are
[36:47] brothers and sisters the devil loves to
[36:49] work on our emotions
[36:51] and the emotions of fear worry and
[36:53] anxiety
[36:54] those are three of the the devil's
[36:57] greatest weapons against the believer
[37:00] and i'm going to prove it to you before
[37:01] the days are and that's some of his
[37:03] greatest weapons you think about in the
[37:04] very beginning
[37:06] in the garden of eden there was adam and
[37:09] eve
[37:10] living in the garden of eden they're
[37:12] living in such peace
[37:14] and harmony and they're living in
[37:16] harmony with god
[37:18] and nature and they had complete control
[37:20] of their lives
[37:24] complete control of their lives if you
[37:27] remember
[37:27] brother brown said adam had the ability
[37:29] to move trees pluck up
[37:31] and go over here he could move mountains
[37:33] he could change the way the streams went
[37:36] he could add waterfalls he could do
[37:37] anything you want you're talking about a
[37:39] confidence and a complete control in his
[37:41] life
[37:44] but here come old satan so satan comes
[37:48] in there
[37:50] in adam's confident life that's in total
[37:53] control
[37:53] satan comes in and he gets involved
[37:57] and throws discord in the life of adam
[38:00] and eve
[38:01] so think about what happens now so now
[38:04] that satan's come and got involved
[38:05] instead of them having that sweet
[38:07] communion
[38:09] that sweet communion with god in the
[38:11] cool of the evening when they would come
[38:12] down and meet with god
[38:14] and they would say oh god it's so lovely
[38:16] we're so glad you came
[38:18] and that peace and that that stillness
[38:20] in the cool of the evening
[38:21] they no longer have that now adam and
[38:24] eve they find themselves
[38:26] hiding they find themselves in a place
[38:30] that they've never been before
[38:32] they find themselves in a hiding place
[38:34] and saying what the world's going on
[38:35] what is this emotion that we're feeling
[38:38] what was it
[38:40] it was fear it was fear because satan
[38:43] had come in
[38:44] and made discord amongst them so now
[38:46] they're in a place that they've never
[38:47] been before and these emotions are
[38:49] running through their bodies over and
[38:50] over and over
[38:51] and they are afraid their hearts are
[38:53] gripped completely with fear
[38:56] i can imagine that their heart rate
[38:57] began to pound they sweat probably
[38:59] started coming off their foreheads
[39:01] and they hear god crying adam
[39:04] where are thou adam where art thou
[39:07] and here they are tucked behind a bush
[39:10] and hiding behind fig leaves because of
[39:11] what's happened in their life
[39:13] they are scared they are scared of
[39:15] something
[39:16] that has never harmed them before
[39:23] you see us humans we it's a human
[39:26] response mechanism that we have built in
[39:28] this for fear
[39:29] and and it's called the fight or flight
[39:32] fight or flight
[39:34] so in this fight or flight there is a
[39:36] physical response
[39:38] that takes place when you perceive
[39:41] when you perceive that there is
[39:43] stressful situation
[39:45] or that something is frightening to you
[39:47] so it begins to kick in your nervous
[39:49] system
[39:50] now this is anatomy and physiology and
[39:52] you know i'm a nurse and i love this
[39:54] stuff
[39:54] and it's amazing to me that god puts
[39:55] this in people but it's there for a
[39:57] reason
[39:58] but this fight or flight kicks in and
[40:00] these responses
[40:01] kick in so that we can survive it's your
[40:04] survival mode
[40:05] it's what happens to soldiers when are
[40:07] on the battlefield fight or flight kicks
[40:09] in
[40:09] and all the things starts happening is
[40:11] is their heart rate begins to increase
[40:12] because their blood vessels have dilated
[40:14] getting blood to their muscle
[40:16] muscles their lungs increase in capacity
[40:20] because
[40:20] they die like the bronchial tubes dilate
[40:22] to take in more oxygen
[40:24] their eye your eyes dilate so that you
[40:26] can take in more light and you can
[40:28] visually see
[40:29] better all this is happening but what is
[40:32] it happening to your body
[40:33] all this is happening but now you get
[40:35] all this energy
[40:37] and you get full of nervousness and you
[40:39] get these endorphins running through
[40:40] your body epinephrine
[40:42] and and adrenaline we've all heard well
[40:44] he's running on adrenaline
[40:46] this is what fear can do to you and when
[40:49] you get in such a place that you begin
[40:50] to fear
[40:51] and you begin to have anxiety then you
[40:53] go into panic attacks
[40:56] this happens it happens
[41:02] king david here let's look a little bit
[41:05] more at his life and we're going to get
[41:06] on into this
[41:08] david had these same emotions he's a
[41:11] human being
[41:13] so no doubt he had to face these same
[41:15] challenges how do you think he felt when
[41:17] he seen that line there
[41:18] and he knew he was supposed to go by the
[41:20] hands of his body and pull this line
[41:23] off of his lamb i would say there was
[41:26] some adrenaline flowing
[41:28] i would say there was some fear there
[41:30] maybe a little bit of anxiety
[41:31] man what am i getting myself into but i
[41:34] can't sit there and watch him die
[41:36] that's how people can pick up cars off
[41:38] of children
[41:40] because that is our adrenaline that gets
[41:42] going in such a way that it pumps their
[41:43] body up
[41:45] david here this man he was the king of
[41:47] israel we know that
[41:49] and i like the life of david
[41:52] jesus himself is called the son of david
[41:54] david was born into a little family in
[41:56] the town of bethlehem
[41:58] in the tribe of judea judah and he was
[42:01] the great grandson
[42:02] of ruth i always find that amazing the
[42:05] lineage as it begins to come down ruth
[42:06] and boaz
[42:07] and he's the great-grandson of ruth the
[42:10] youngest of eight sons of jesse
[42:12] he's one of the most controversial
[42:14] figures in the old testament
[42:17] [Music]
[42:18] he wasn't an angel david's life was full
[42:22] of controversy
[42:24] david's life was full of such
[42:28] a public display of wrongness at times
[42:31] i mean he he blatantly had an adulterous
[42:34] act
[42:35] he stole another man's wife and then
[42:38] went and had that man killed
[42:41] so his life is full of controversy
[42:44] but one thing about it is david always
[42:47] gave particular attention
[42:49] to the matters of spiritual life he
[42:52] began to get
[42:53] so close to god in his spiritual life
[42:55] that he was known as a man
[42:57] who was after god's own heart
[43:00] terrible mistakes awful things
[43:05] but you know what david had he was
[43:07] teachable
[43:09] he was teachable you know this just
[43:12] comes to me you know
[43:13] i coach i coach baseball and help and
[43:15] you take
[43:16] you take you can take a team of kids and
[43:19] if they're teachable
[43:21] you can make some ball players out of
[43:22] them if they will listen
[43:25] and they will do what you tell them to
[43:26] do whether it's basketball
[43:28] baseball soccer hockey i don't care what
[43:30] it is if they are teachable
[43:33] if they will listen and do you can make
[43:35] something out of them but if not
[43:39] have you got your hands full
[43:43] brother jeff knows what i'm talking
[43:44] about this one's punching this one
[43:46] that's what's punching that one this one
[43:47] won't do this and this one's running
[43:48] here and running there and
[43:50] i gotta have water i'm hurt it's just
[43:51] cause it but if you get something that's
[43:53] teachable
[43:54] you can do something and david was
[43:56] teachable and david was
[43:58] humble david was always humble and he
[44:01] was quick to create
[44:02] correct his behaviors when he knew he
[44:05] had done something wrong when it was
[44:06] brought to his attention
[44:08] when the prophet come to him and said
[44:09] there was a man that took another man's
[44:11] wife what should we do to him
[44:12] well let's kill him but it was you oh
[44:15] mom i'm so sorry
[44:17] i didn't realize i didn't even find
[44:18] myself in that place but now that you've
[44:20] brought it to my attention
[44:21] i'm sorry i want to correct my behaviors
[44:24] he paid special attention to his
[44:26] conscience and he wanted to live
[44:30] connected to god so you
[44:33] sometimes we find ourselves in a place
[44:36] in our life to where we're probably not
[44:37] doing everything we should do or know to
[44:39] do
[44:41] anybody ever been there but i still want
[44:44] to be so connected to god
[44:46] that he can look through me look over my
[44:49] faults and
[44:50] forgive me for what i've done wrong so
[44:51] that i can rely and trust on him
[44:54] and the things that i need in my life
[44:56] that way i don't have to worry
[44:58] i don't have to have fear i will fix it
[45:00] god
[45:01] show me if i'm wrong tell me
[45:08] david's trouble started we know as a
[45:10] simple shepherd
[45:12] went on into his key as king hood where
[45:14] he was king king there
[45:16] and enemies pursuing him constantly
[45:19] you'll find a story in the book of
[45:20] samuel first and second samuel
[45:22] and he's the most mentioned man in the
[45:24] old testament
[45:26] the most mentioned man so he was a
[45:28] special kind of person
[45:30] david was a special kind of person but
[45:33] david says here in this psalm
[45:36] the lord is my light and my salvation
[45:38] whom shall i fear
[45:40] the lord is my stronghold in life whom
[45:42] shall i be afraid
[45:43] so when he was in hiding from his
[45:45] enemies
[45:47] and fear was all around him david would
[45:50] talk to himself
[45:52] the greatest psalm a songwriter that's
[45:54] ever lived david would find himself into
[45:57] a calm
[45:58] and secret place in hiding and he would
[46:00] begin to talk to himself and then he
[46:02] would begin to pin his thoughts
[46:04] on whatever parchment he had you know
[46:06] they say sometimes you don't even know
[46:07] your true thoughts or emotions until you
[46:09] write them down
[46:10] and then you read them so write your
[46:11] thoughts keep a journal you'll find out
[46:13] who you really
[46:14] are good or bad you'll find out who you
[46:18] are
[46:18] so david then finds himself in a place
[46:20] and he begins to write
[46:22] and the conversation david has with
[46:24] himself is one that he shares with god
[46:27] and david says i'm in progress and i'm
[46:30] serving a god that i can talk to he's in
[46:34] communion
[46:35] with god david now begins to understand
[46:38] that god is my light
[46:40] he writes it my light and my salvation
[46:42] god is my light
[46:43] he who eliminates the dark path david
[46:47] spending time in caves he could
[46:48] realize that when you're living in
[46:50] complete darkness because you're hiding
[46:53] you need somebody to shed some light on
[46:55] your life
[46:56] so david begins to write that david also
[46:58] understands that god
[47:00] is his salvation he's not going to be
[47:03] saved by anybody during this perilous
[47:05] times
[47:06] but god one man can't fight off ten
[47:10] one man can't fight off a hundred not by
[47:13] yourself
[47:14] and david says he's my salvation i know
[47:16] he's the one that fights my battles why
[47:18] do i worry
[47:20] i know who i am i know who he is he's my
[47:23] salvation
[47:24] so why should i worry he'll fight my
[47:26] battles for me
[47:27] brothers and sisters we have to get that
[47:29] in our mindset that god fights our
[47:30] battles
[47:32] we don't fight our own battles i can't
[47:34] fight my own battles i'm not strong
[47:36] enough i'm not smart enough but god
[47:38] has the answer
[47:42] david says god is my stronghold
[47:47] we need a stronghold something that
[47:50] stands the test of time
[47:51] something that can that you can wrap
[47:53] your arms around and it doesn't move
[47:55] and psalms 99 says the lord is the
[47:57] refuge of the oppressed
[47:59] and the stronghold in the times of
[48:02] trouble
[48:04] why worry
[48:08] this is our very question we should ask
[48:09] ourselves of believers why do we have to
[48:11] be afraid
[48:13] what are we afraid of why do we have
[48:16] fear
[48:17] if we're like david like david said if
[48:18] we know who we're protected by and who
[48:20] we're sheltered by
[48:21] who is the greatest and the most
[48:22] powerful protector of all
[48:24] why do we fear why do we worry why do we
[48:28] let fear and anxiety rule in our lives
[48:35] i tell you what many times it's over
[48:38] insignificant things
[48:41] it's things that you can't control
[48:42] anyway
[48:45] and we stew and we worry and we fret and
[48:47] we cry
[48:49] sometimes for we don't even know why
[48:52] i know firsthand when i was in fourth
[48:54] grade i had such anxiety
[48:57] of leaving the house of leaving my
[48:59] parents to go to school
[49:00] i cried and i begged and i begged my
[49:03] parents to let me stay home
[49:08] daddy told me one time i'm gonna wear
[49:09] you out i said bring it on
[49:11] i'm not going you you can beat me do
[49:13] whatever you want i'm not going to
[49:14] school
[49:16] and i cried and i cried and i was so
[49:18] scared
[49:19] and they were like what are you scared
[49:20] of what are you afraid of
[49:22] is there somebody doing something to you
[49:24] no i got friends at school
[49:26] well what's going on is there a teacher
[49:27] that's been said something to you no i
[49:29] got the teachers like me
[49:31] what was it it was something right here
[49:34] that i felt like if that i wasn't in
[49:37] control
[49:38] and that something bad was going to
[49:40] happen
[49:42] i thought if i left my parents the first
[49:45] ambulance i heard well mom and dad was
[49:46] going to the hospital they've been in a
[49:48] wreck
[49:49] these thoughts go through your head and
[49:52] when these thoughts begin to go through
[49:53] your head and you stew
[49:54] on them that's when your fears begin to
[49:56] bring out the anxiety
[49:59] and that anxiety begins to kick into
[50:01] high gear
[50:02] and then you've got these endorphins
[50:04] going and you can't control it and
[50:05] nobody can control it
[50:08] you get into such a place you think i'm
[50:10] having a heart attack
[50:12] the panic begins to come your heart
[50:13] races you get the pressure on your chest
[50:15] it happened later in my life as well one
[50:17] other time that i can remember i was
[50:19] going through some
[50:20] some rough things and and so forth and
[50:22] it's just more than i told you
[50:23] i said you've got to get me to the
[50:24] doctor i'm dying of a heart attack
[50:28] nothing was wrong with my heart she said
[50:31] you don't have to slow down you don't
[50:32] have to quit worrying about stuff
[50:34] that you can't control
[50:39] as i got older i realized in life that
[50:42] there's a lot of things
[50:43] a lot of situations that we just don't
[50:45] have control over
[50:47] and that's when we trust in god
[50:51] now no doubt in life we've got areas of
[50:54] concern
[50:56] now concern is a little bit different
[50:58] than worry we're always
[51:00] concerned about others we're concerned
[51:02] about our family we're concerned about
[51:04] things
[51:06] things we should be prayerful about now
[51:09] as parents
[51:12] you've got to be careful because you let
[51:15] this concern begin to overwhelm and if
[51:18] you're not careful that concern goes
[51:19] into worry
[51:20] and then that goes on into fear and if
[51:23] you've got kids around 16 you know
[51:25] exactly what i'm talking about
[51:28] ours just got his driver's license
[51:31] yep that's right and he's a good driver
[51:35] i i taught him i even let him drive
[51:37] before he should just to get more time
[51:39] in
[51:40] you've been there you've done it so he
[51:42] goes that day we go up there and he's so
[51:44] happy he gets his driver's license
[51:47] and he's happy and you know i know
[51:50] what's coming next
[51:51] can i go to hop town
[51:56] and it's pouring down rain cats and dogs
[51:59] i mean it's just coming up
[52:00] looks like a monsoon and for some reason
[52:04] always comes to me to ask the questions
[52:06] instead of his mama i don't know if it's
[52:08] because he he knows i'll give in
[52:09] or she don't or what but he comes to me
[52:13] and i said yeah you can go
[52:17] and boy in my mind i'm thinking what am
[52:19] i saying
[52:21] how can i let this 16 year old on his
[52:24] first day of his driver's license
[52:26] head off 30 miles away driving 65 miles
[52:30] an hour and oh
[52:30] i forgot he's got to get on the parkway
[52:32] where he's going and he's never driven
[52:34] on the parkway
[52:35] i remember that when he was halfway
[52:37] there
[52:39] and i think man i hope he knows what
[52:40] exit to get off of i hope he knows
[52:42] where he how to get back on i hope he
[52:44] don't get on the wrong way
[52:46] so all these thoughts are going through
[52:48] your mind as a parent
[52:50] and joel has come she said did you tell
[52:51] him he could go to hop town
[52:54] yep i said you remember when you got
[52:57] your license you had to go
[52:59] everybody when you got your license
[53:01] what'd you do you had to go right
[53:04] i couldn't hold that back from him so
[53:06] what i had to tell myself
[53:08] is he's prepared for this
[53:11] he's driven he's practiced
[53:15] i have confidence that he will obey the
[53:17] speed limit
[53:18] i have confidence that he will look both
[53:20] ways twice before he pulls out
[53:23] god i put it in your hands i did my part
[53:27] i did my part now god
[53:30] it's your turn i got one even better
[53:35] when he decided he wanted to be a pilot
[53:37] he starts taking pilot's lessons this is
[53:38] all fine and good
[53:40] as long as he's with the instructor but
[53:42] then that day came when they said oh
[53:43] you're ready to go on your own
[53:46] 16 years old whoo
[53:50] of course let me tell you how that day
[53:51] went we get there it's on his birthday
[53:53] he won a solo on his uh 16th
[53:56] or 15th 16th right 16th birthday
[54:00] he wanted to solo so we get there it's
[54:03] april 15th of april and you know the
[54:04] weather can be anything the 15th of
[54:06] april
[54:07] well we had 15 and 18 20 mile an hour
[54:10] wind gust
[54:11] and he's uh taking taking flights around
[54:13] the airport
[54:14] around and around with the instructor in
[54:16] there and he's coming into practice
[54:18] landing and that thing is just
[54:19] it's going everywhere i mean the wind is
[54:21] blowing and it's up and down and i'm
[54:22] thinking oh my lord what about doing
[54:25] i thought to myself i thought well the
[54:29] instructor
[54:30] won't let him go unless he's ready
[54:34] now it's in your hands
[54:38] now it's in your hands was it easy
[54:41] no did he do it yes
[54:45] did god make a way yes god seen that he
[54:47] would bring him back home
[54:51] why worry why worry
[54:56] it's all it's life guys
[55:01] it's life it's what we live and because
[55:03] we're christians
[55:05] we can live another day because we know
[55:08] what god is and who god is
[55:09] we can make it through till tomorrow
[55:15] david said when the wicked advance upon
[55:17] me to eat my flesh
[55:20] they're going to tomboy and fall
[55:23] he knew what their purpose was they was
[55:25] going to kill him they was going to slay
[55:27] him and he said but that don't matter
[55:29] they're going to fall you're talking
[55:30] about confidence
[55:32] you're talking about confidence that
[55:33] david had so much confidence in god that
[55:35] he said i'm the target
[55:38] of all of these people they have all
[55:40] their swords their weapons are trained
[55:41] on me but when they come
[55:43] they'll fall that's confidence in god
[55:48] confidence in god and david says this
[55:52] one thing that i ask that i can only
[55:55] seek
[55:56] that i may dwell in the house of the
[55:57] lord all the days of my life
[56:02] remember he's a flawed man he's a flawed
[56:05] human being but he asked how i just want
[56:08] to live in the house of the lord
[56:10] all the days of my life to gaze upon
[56:13] your beauty
[56:15] to gaze upon your beauty and to seek you
[56:18] in your temple
[56:28] listen to what david says in four and
[56:30] five paraphrasing
[56:32] david didn't go ask for stuff
[56:35] and say lord you know i i could use a
[56:38] new chariot
[56:41] my horses get kind of old i could use a
[56:44] new team of horses
[56:47] no i've outgrown my palace i need a new
[56:50] palace no
[56:53] but he respected god for his beauty
[56:57] for the precious holy worthy
[57:01] life that god could provide him david
[57:04] knew
[57:05] a secret place a secret place
[57:08] that you have to find yourself in david
[57:11] had such a
[57:12] personal relationship with god
[57:15] that he gained confidence
[57:19] how did he get in that secret place
[57:22] troubles
[57:24] things that put him in such a place that
[57:25] he had to hide and write his thoughts
[57:27] and get sincere and dedicated and true
[57:29] with god
[57:30] and got in such a place that he could
[57:32] god through all my trials
[57:33] through all my running all of my fear
[57:35] and all of my worry
[57:37] you're beautiful you're beautiful god
[57:41] and sometimes i wonder if we don't take
[57:43] that far enough
[57:45] we are to admire god in his beauty
[57:49] we ought to ask god pull us up close to
[57:51] your bosom god
[57:52] pull us up and let me lay my head in
[57:54] your lap and just let you just stroke my
[57:56] brow lord
[57:58] do we ever get into a place do we get
[58:00] that sincere with god
[58:01] that we get into a place that we can
[58:04] allow god to have that kind of communion
[58:06] with us
[58:06] the kind of communion that adam and eve
[58:08] had in the garden of eden before the
[58:10] fall
[58:11] we're talking about a restoration of a
[58:13] bride right that's what this message is
[58:15] based upon a restoration of a bride
[58:17] we got to get into a place that we
[58:18] realize we are the bride
[58:20] and that he's the bridegroom and that
[58:22] god wants to
[58:23] he wants to stroke the brow of your head
[58:25] and tell you it's all right
[58:27] why worry
[58:29] [Music]
[58:34] even as a shepherd boy even as a
[58:36] shepherd boy
[58:38] there was a such a relationship between
[58:40] god and david
[58:42] that it allowed him to overcome the fear
[58:44] of the lion
[58:45] and the bear as a young man there was a
[58:48] relationship
[58:49] with god that when he faced that giant
[58:52] he looked at john in the eyes and said
[58:54] i'm gonna take these five stones
[58:56] f-a-i-t-h
[59:00] and i'm gonna overcome this
[59:02] uncircumcised philistine
[59:03] while all of israel laid down
[59:06] and cowed down and trembled in their
[59:09] boots
[59:11] at the thought of this giant and one
[59:13] young boy
[59:18] you're talking about some courage now
[59:20] that's some god-given courage right
[59:22] there
[59:27] what was it that gave david the courage
[59:30] to walk into the enemy's
[59:34] grounds and walk up to the to the man
[59:37] that wanted him dead more than anything
[59:38] in this world
[59:40] while he's sleeping and grab his coat
[59:45] and cut off a piece of coat tail just to
[59:48] throw it in the face later and say i
[59:49] could have killed you
[59:53] you're talking about courage you're
[59:55] talking about curse
[59:56] david had to overcome his fear
[1:00:06] fear anxiety worry
[1:00:11] they all create phobias
[1:00:15] i've got something here in my notes i
[1:00:17] want to backtrack to
[1:00:22] worry to give way
[1:00:27] to anxiety or unease
[1:00:31] listen to this definition webster knows
[1:00:34] more about it spiritually than sometimes
[1:00:36] we do
[1:00:38] to allow one's mind to dwell on
[1:00:41] difficult
[1:00:43] difficulty or troubles you have allowed
[1:00:46] your mind
[1:00:48] to dwell on difficulties or troubles
[1:00:52] anxiety the feeling of fear dread or
[1:00:55] uneasiness
[1:00:57] it might cause you to sweat feel
[1:00:59] restless or tense a rapid heartbeat
[1:01:02] for example you might feel anxious
[1:01:04] before facing a difficult problem at
[1:01:06] work or taking a test
[1:01:07] or an important decision and i like this
[1:01:11] one on fear
[1:01:13] it's an emotion
[1:01:16] induced by perceived
[1:01:19] danger perceived danger or threat
[1:01:24] and it causes physiological and
[1:01:26] psychological changes in behavior
[1:01:30] in the last one phobia
[1:01:33] phobia an extreme or irrational fear
[1:01:38] something that is unlikely to cause harm
[1:01:43] we hear different kinds of phobias one
[1:01:46] of probably the most common phobias is
[1:01:47] claustrophobia
[1:01:48] we all know what that is right fear of
[1:01:50] height spaces
[1:01:53] and that begins to grow in your mind
[1:01:56] let's look at phobias for just a minute
[1:01:58] it's a mind game the greatest battle
[1:02:00] ever fought was where
[1:02:02] and mine i was on a trip one time with
[1:02:06] some family and some friends and we went
[1:02:08] into a cave
[1:02:11] yep we went deep into this cave
[1:02:15] and we went way on deep we come to a
[1:02:18] place so
[1:02:19] so tight so small we had to get down our
[1:02:21] hands and knees and we were crawling
[1:02:24] on our hands and knees well then it got
[1:02:26] tighter and tighter
[1:02:27] and before i'm thinking it i'm on my
[1:02:29] belly and i'm just
[1:02:30] squirming through there as tight as i
[1:02:32] could and then all of a sudden i thought
[1:02:34] i can't stand up i can't stand up
[1:02:39] hey i got to get out of here they said
[1:02:41] turn off the lights quit thinking about
[1:02:43] it
[1:02:44] i got to get out of here i can't get i'm
[1:02:46] stuck
[1:02:47] i wasn't stuck but in my mind
[1:02:51] this fear and this phobia and the
[1:02:52] anxiety i probably did swell up quite a
[1:02:55] bit with the blood pumping through me at
[1:02:56] that time my heart was racing as fast as
[1:02:58] it could go
[1:02:58] and i think i've got to get out of this
[1:03:00] cave
[1:03:02] i've never been back in a cave
[1:03:05] and i have a hard time going under
[1:03:07] houses
[1:03:09] so when i built mine i built it on a
[1:03:10] slab
[1:03:13] that wasn't the reason why but
[1:03:16] phobias they begin to build out of fear
[1:03:19] claustrophobia
[1:03:21] arachnophobia spiders is that spider
[1:03:24] really going to hurt you
[1:03:27] no no that spider is not going to hurt
[1:03:30] you there's people that have
[1:03:31] uh hydrophobia they're afraid to even
[1:03:33] get in the water
[1:03:35] they won't take a shower they won't take
[1:03:36] a bath they're afraid that water is
[1:03:39] going to hurt them
[1:03:41] we're made of about 90 of water
[1:03:45] i don't think the water is going to hurt
[1:03:46] you but what is it it's something in
[1:03:48] their mind
[1:03:49] that has taken place in there and it's
[1:03:52] begun
[1:03:52] it fires up this fear and anxiety in
[1:03:55] their lives
[1:03:57] this fear and anxiety brothers and
[1:03:59] sisters
[1:04:01] you've got to be able to overcome worry
[1:04:04] fear anxiety it's detrimental
[1:04:07] to your health it's detrimental to you

[1:06:58] said that's just the devil trying
[1:07:00] to hinder you all this nervousness and
[1:07:04] tightness
[1:07:04] and worry has caused her to tighten up
[1:07:06] in such a way that this woman
[1:07:08] went to him prepared because she
[1:07:09] couldn't function in life
[1:07:15] listen to this extreme case here

[1:11:55] a place
[1:11:55] that that i know that all the uh things
[1:11:58] are stacked against me
[1:11:59] that he is the resurrection and the life
[1:12:02] and he that believeth in me will be
[1:12:03] there he said i know
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:06] i've worried no more
[1:12:12] one more real quick you've heard the
[1:12:15] message
[1:12:16] letting off the pressure you've heard it
[1:12:18] or read it and numerous times i'm sure
[1:12:21] but listen to what he says if you've
[1:12:23] ever come to christ
[1:12:25] you can let off the pressure
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:29] if you've ever come to christ you can
[1:12:31] let off that pressure you can just
[1:12:33] settle down because it's over he said
[1:12:36] it's god's provided place of safety
[1:12:39] where you can say the name of the lord
[1:12:41] is a mighty tower
[1:12:42] and the righteous run into it in a time
[1:12:45] of sickness
[1:12:46] and the doctor says there's nothing
[1:12:47] nothing else i can do
[1:12:49] don't build up pressure
[1:12:54] now that's easy to say
[1:12:57] we're human beings and that's easy to
[1:13:00] say
[1:13:01] don't build up pressure when you don't
[1:13:02] know what tomorrow might hold
[1:13:04] when the doctors tell you there's
[1:13:05] nothing else i can do he says don't
[1:13:07] build up pressure let the pressure off
[1:13:12] how do you do that call your pastor
[1:13:15] he says call your pastor and let him
[1:13:17] anoint you in oil and pray over you
[1:13:19] the prayer of faith to save the sick and
[1:13:22] that lets off the pressure
[1:13:32] you say i wonder brother branham
[1:13:35] you don't wonder just let the pressure
[1:13:37] off commit your case to god
[1:13:39] as it was all over don't build up
[1:13:41] pressure
[1:13:42] let it go let the pressure go
[1:13:46] i'm so worried brother branham you say
[1:13:48] well i'm so worried brother branham
[1:13:50] i just don't know let off the pressure
[1:13:53] he keeps going on and on and on
[1:13:54] let off the pressure get into that city
[1:13:56] of refuge just like
[1:13:58] david see god don't change
[1:14:02] god seeks communion we had a communion
[1:14:05] service
[1:14:06] not a week or so ago we had a communion
[1:14:09] service and that is a time of communion
[1:14:11] that we take serious when we break the
[1:14:13] bread and we
[1:14:14] we break the fruit of the vine and we we
[1:14:16] commune with god but what's more than a
[1:14:18] monthly communion service
[1:14:20] god wants a communion on a daily basis
[1:14:23] not five minutes not ten minutes and i'm
[1:14:25] guilty as you are i promise
[1:14:27] but we have to learn to dedicate more
[1:14:29] time to god
[1:14:30] to dedicate more of our time on our
[1:14:32] knees and in a sweet communion with god
[1:14:34] so that we can find that refuge to let
[1:14:38] off the pressure
[1:14:42] and sister's pressure is coming we
[1:14:44] haven't seen pressure
[1:14:47] right you know we've we've had four
[1:14:50] pretty good years

[1:14:55] the odds are stacked against you and i
[1:14:58] when you say i'm a christian
[1:15:00] a lot of odds are stacked against you

[1:15:09] pressure brother branham said he met a
[1:15:11] woman

[1:15:30] studied religions but when

[1:15:40] i've never had a worry since
[1:15:43] 60 something years old and looked like a
[1:15:45] young woman

[1:18:53] that when we worry over big things or we
[1:18:56] worry over
[1:18:57] little things there is someone who can
[1:18:59] make an anxiety makeover
[1:19:02] but there is a god who cares that there
[1:19:04] is a god who can manage our anxiety
[1:19:07] so that worry and fear and anxiety don't
[1:19:10] dominate our life
[1:19:12] so that worry and fear and anxiety don't
[1:19:15] take you into a place
[1:19:16] of mental depression or into a place of
[1:19:20] physical
[1:19:21] sickness we don't want to be those
[1:19:23] people standing in the prayer line
[1:19:25] and the spirit talks through through one
[1:19:26] of the preachers brother byler myself or
[1:19:28] any other preacher and says
[1:19:29] why are you so nervous i can sense
[1:19:32] nervous
[1:19:34] we need security we need a refuge
[1:19:38] first peter 5 7 if y'all just play
[1:19:40] something softly
[1:19:41] says cast all your cares upon him for he
[1:19:44] careth for you
[1:19:48] philippians 4 6-7 be careful for nothing
[1:19:53] be careful for nothing what's that

[1:19:57] don't care for the things this world
[1:19:58] don't worry about it
[1:20:00] don't worry be careful for nothing but
[1:20:01] in everything by prayer and supplication
[1:20:04] with thanksgiving

[1:20:35] and let's just take a minute
[1:20:38] to find ourselves in communion with god
[1:20:42] find ourselves in a place of refuge find
[1:20:45] ourselves in a place
[1:20:46] that we could honestly say god i worry
[1:20:50] about stuff that doesn't matter

[1:20:58] control over
[1:21:00] and i let these things burden my life i
