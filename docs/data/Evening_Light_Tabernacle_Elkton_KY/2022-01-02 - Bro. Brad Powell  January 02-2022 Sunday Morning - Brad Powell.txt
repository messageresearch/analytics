TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and your father's tempted me proved me and saw my work this one together unto whom i swear in my wrath they should not enter into my rest god bless you you may be seated morning brothers and sisters i'm assuming you don't want to be one of those people that we just read about in the psalms that you want to be the opposite of what we just read about would you turn with me to psalms 121 1. and uh i do a lot of crazy things sometimes i forget to put things in my bible in the morning i said i was going to try to do a financial report next instead of getting one of those red books that i use i've been using it's almost 20 years now i didn't use a red book i just used a regular notepad and did 52 weeks worth of entries so it's gonna take me i'm hoping to be done by sunday but i just made myself work harder than i needed to but i'll try to get a financial report by next sunday it might be the following one and then i'll let you know what's left in what's left in the church loan and where we're at financially in the general fund and everything but going to the uh psalm 121 i was reading this this morning it's out of a devotional from world war one more of them as we i've said before that if you read the psalms it's repetitive and god told the children of israel to read these words before their children and before the people that that they would put it in their heart my help come from the lord which made heaven and earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he keepeth thee the slumber nor sleep he doesn't sleep lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon my right hand the sun shall not move just red and he goes on to say the lord shall preserve thee from all evil and he shall preserve thy soul and the lord shall preserve thy going out so my coming in for this time forth even forever more and it goes back to this psalm and the other psalm if your promises in christ your results are he is sure he shall preserve forever and as a chaplain in the last four remember leaving my wife and three small children at the railroad station you know that's now you don't leave by a train anymore you leave by an aircraft wondering whether i will ever see them again and i sat in the train and i began reading a letter from a friend at the close of what she said may the lord preserve thy goings out my coming in i lifted up my heart to god and said lord do this for me for the sake of those whom i love that i took out my bible and i read this great thing and he read the 121st psalm the lord shall preserve thy goings out my coming in and this last paragraph is what i was thinking about i still remember the joy of it and the wondrous sense of security it brought that of course didn't mean that i was coming back and then you know that you go 120 years forward you know most people would look at the promise of god any promise we have it's in god's hand what happens whatever however that applies promises applied and he says of course it didn't mean i was coming back back but it did mean that god was going to watch over me and care care for me and hold all the if all that affected me to his control it means the same thing for you today if you belong to him every life committed to where you're at in your life where you're at in your experience everything's in god's hands and you just i say this a lot i don't but you just gotta let go to uh i don't know if i mark a spot in the bible this morning but if you return you know it's pretty good shot for romans 8. you know i'm not going to read the whole chapter but i'll just read i'm going to read these verses here if i can find my place i thought i marked it this morning you know you you couldn't read you couldn't read romans 8 enough and i'm all over the place this morning but like i've said before everything we do like this man was saying everything you do is in god's hands and i'll start from about the 25th verse going to about the 32nd verse and for if we hope for what we see not then do we with patience wait for it and that hope is christ i mean and likewise the spirit also helped with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make intercessions for us with groans which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knowing what is the mind of the spirit because he'd make it intercession for the saints according to the will of god and he goes on to say paul goes on to say and we are called according to his purpose i know there's plaques all over the world that have that one scripture written for people but it goes on for whom he did for them who also he did predestinated to be conformed to the image of the son that he might be the firstborn of many brethren moreover when he did predestinated him he also called them whom he called him he also justified whom he justified he also glorified and then he goes on to say here and this is a true statement for what shall we say then to these things if god be forced who can be against us i mean i don't have a lot to say this morning but the one thing i would say is we start a new year it i guess everything depends as a as a person as a christian what you're hoping what your trust is in this morning everyone has their own place their own experience where they're at this morning but as this this man was a presbyterian so when you read this you know he comes from a presbyterian's perspective which is still the word of god and it's sovereignty and god's predestination we all have a purpose god you know no one gets out of this life without god fulfilling his purpose for you and we want to be what god wants us to be we don't want to find ourselves fighting them to the day we die we just want to be able to surrender to the will of god for our hearts and for our lives and the age that we live in and as we go into another year that's every man and every woman's purpose is you got to find out where god wants you to be and what steps he wants you to walk in in the year that's ahead you know i i can't know it for you no man or woman can know it for you it's something that you've got to pray about you've got to read god's word and apply it to your life and god will show you what he wants you to do in the coming months ahead and year brother received amen appreciate that brother brian yeah okay just go on and take our prayer request first thing uh sis johnny's turned in unspoken requests for her sister lynette graham just need to remember her in prayer and also says uh please pray for sarah and stephen uh sister sarah laster and bro stephen they're both sick also pray for trevor has son he needs a touch from the lord sister joyce turned us in i follow trevor's seems like everyday ups and downs on facebook and my he uh he's really he's really going through it so i know uh i know he could use your prayers just pray for the doctors directions and what to do to help him and and uh but he seems like he tries to hold a good spirit that's why that's when when he's when he's not sleeping i guess when they don't have him so drugged up but i just seen a little part there where he was singing with his uh while they were trying to get him all hooked back up again and um i've never been to the hospital overnight and i thank the lord for that being being as old as i am uh i think that's a blessing i've had some outpatient stuff done but at least i could be home at night so uh the lord's really been good to me but just remember these in prayer uh i know we brother david nims uh fight and covet and and talked text him yesterday and he said he's doing better and so uh just remember them and brother stephen uh he actually called me yesterday but steven laster talked to him he said he's got a real bad he told me a sinus infection he's had it for quite some time and you could have from him talking that that he was he was fighting something so let's just hold him before the lord also and sister sarah amen brother danny wade's sick so let's just remember him uh is it just him brother john okay so i know it's number out i know brother jonah i'm probably driving back today or okay so don't know who who's sick who ain't and just want to make sure just pray for all the sick people pray for everybody let's just do that whatever state we're bow our heads dear most gracious heavenly father we come to you this morning lord touch on their lives and their hearts and their bodies lord lord you know during sickness times lord the devil just battled you in your mind we want to lift these up this morning lord jesus as we come to you lord and those of us that are praise god [Music] with the hell [Music] he has made me his own now i'm cleansed [Music] is [Music] praise god praise god i'm a trout of the king oh oh yes i'm a child of the king his royal blood now stream my veins [Music] [Music] praise god amen you know the devil likes to take that away from us in your normal life most of us aren't in a wealthy situation as far as we're not hurting by any means that i know of but a child what would we do different if we were how would we live our life you see so many people that are that away and they just everything these stuff that it's all vanity um i like the way i am amen let's sing he's coming soon number [Music] 198 closing days of time what joy glorious [Music] five [Music] [Music] joy [Music] no [Music] boo

[Music] amen y'all believe that this morning i sure hope you do you don't want to get caught y'all can be seated i like that last line there that says we comfort one another by his word you know some people might say well every time i come to church i get preached at well that's that's being comforted by his word that's what that is i mean because like brother brandon always told the story if your little boy is out there in the street you're not gonna say johnny dear get out of the street you're gonna run out there and snatch them up and that's what our ministers are trying to do for us amen let's have brother glenn and brother john there if you would hershberger and would you help an offer brother glenn if you pray over this worthy it's number 461 in the book [Music] worthy [Applause] [Music] to receive me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and for thy pleasure they are created [Music] [Applause] [Music] worthy [Music] [Music] has all things created thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure [Music] [Music] amen i didn't ask anybody for a special this morning did nobody volunteer so we won't have one um so let's stand if we could cutting for the bread giving him more time to speak and well more time for the lord to speak through him so let's see if we could just sing amazing grace as he gets ready to come out and [Music] i just appreciate each one of y'all coming out this morning [Music] um [Music] sound that says rich like me i [Music] i was [Music] it was [Music] my fears [Music] [Music] first [Music] is [Music] me [Music] years [Music] the last [Music] speaking amen let's just bow our heads before the lord heavenly father lord you're certainly great this morning you're sobering you're [Music] you're a lover to us lord you you've given over and over and time and time again and lord we made it through another year lord as a church and a congregation here and we've seen many blessings we've seen many things that we can definitely say that your hand was upon we thank you for it lord and lord as we come to you this first day of the first sunday of the new year lord we just want to dedicate and consecrate ourselves to you once again lord that honor and glory that could be brought to you through our lives lord through the way we live the the life we live the not just the words as our pastors spoke this past wednesday not just the words we speak but the life we live lord we wanted to speak loud before the people of the world lord jesus lord jesus we just come come to you this morning asking your presence asking for you to minister to our hearts needs this morning lord that whatever the need would be here we know that you're more than able lord sickness can't can't stand before you financial trouble doesn't stand before you death can't even stand before you lord if we fully commit and consecrate it to you lord we know that you're able to move on the scene we thank you for all you do for us and we just ask your blessings upon the remainder of this service in christ's name amen amen thank you for the music that'll be always sure i love the lord this morning and and thankful for what god has done for us and here we are in 2022. yeah we just made it through one of the most fine years that the world has seen at least in most of our time um with the covet 19 and and the restrictions that came with it and fear of not knowing what it was or what it was going to do to us and who was it going to take who's it going to target who's it going to hit what are we going to do where are we going to go you know so it's been a it's been a it's been a year for us as not only americans but worldwide and and even as christians uh these things still weigh on christians minds i mean they do uh and it's been that kind of year so you know you just you just want to hope that you're doing the right thing and you're you're saying and doing the right thing and you know we can't forget about the the roller coaster uh in our national leadership it's uh it but we've made it through we're gonna make it we're gonna be okay um we're here by god's grace uh face to face with 2022 what will it hold for us what will it be what will it bring us in this year uh we all hope good things right blessings and good tidings that's what we what we hope for so uh i will read you a little quote before i have you set uh brother branham he was speaking in 1960 on new year's eve i guess it was and he says bless us he's praying he says bless us how many want that bless us and may this new year dawn with new hopes and bringing new thoughts and new revelations new power and oh everything may it be may it be renewed to us again lord of thy blessings and promises we commit ourselves with our prayer into thy hands in the name of the lord jesus i thought man how fitting is that in the time that we're living in so pray for us we i asked as you pray for us for our some of our personal uh desires that we have or seeking direction for from god and some projects that i've got on my mind that lord laid on my heart and just want to make sure i'm in his will and doing doing doing what he would have me to be and if it is it'll fall in place and if not it'll go by the wayside we won't look back so definitely a time of for everybody personal growth and ambitions we think about that this time of year right a couple weeks or a week or so ago you start thinking about what am i going to do in the new year what's what's it going to lead what am i going to do so we just pray that and and hope that your desires are to be closer to god turn with me this morning if you would as we begin to speak to first chronicles 4. that's right after kings i think there so it's up in the in your old testament there i'll tell you with a computer i was telling somebody my kids they they fly through the bible because with computers you know you can just punch in what you're looking for and bang it's there so you know you i still read out of my bible but my familiarity going from one to the other is not not like it should be so first chronicles four and before we start i just want to say you know brother steve i heard you talking about uh trevor and he's just been just been a great burden on my heart here lately and and uh you know we see the story and and uh you know you talk about him having a good spirit and he does but you know i can't even imagine the the struggle from day to day that he has to go go through so uh and we're praying for him we all are but i just you know i just as a parent you just came you know i can't imagine i just can't imagine uh thinking about it as a parent but i think back to when i was 17 or 18. i've got a 17 year old uh you know how hard that would be so try to put yourself in in their channels chapter 4 verse 9 and 10. now if you're looking at this chapter here and you're beginning to read this chapter and you're reading them through your bible if you look at the very beginning it's one of those begat moments and you just begat this one and this one begat that one and this one's the son of this and and this one's this person's son and over and over and if you're like most people when you're reading the bible and you get to those baguettes you just breeze right through them right if we're honest we breeze right through them but if we're not careful if we don't slow down look at verse 9 we miss a very powerful verse and jabez was more honorable than his brethren and his mother called his name jabez because she's saying because i bear him with sorrow and jabez is called on the god of israel saying oh that thou would has blessed me indeed and enlarge my coast and that thy hand might be with me and that thou would has keep me from evil and that it may not greed my goodness what a verse we have right there and if you go on and look what what does it jump right back into begat begat son of begat be had son of but here's jabez has a special place right here in these two little verses in the bible god may have blessed us to the reading of the word you can have your seats this morning so i want to speak this morning on god's blessings on our lives god's blessings on our lives i mean we definitely want god's blessings on our lives i like how brother brown kind of approaches in the new year's message in 1964 and the message shalom it kind of brings us right down to the beginning of where we're at today and when we listen to this quote it doesn't have a lot to do with jabez you know brother branham i've never seen where he even spoke on jabez and it kind of was astounding to me that he never spoke on this little prayer in the bible but hearing this one message in shalom in 1964 he said we're facing this year with both darkness and light he says the world is in one of the most chaotic times of darkness that has ever stood in and yet it's standing in the most blessed light that it ever did shine in the difference is it's just like it was in the beginning when there was gross darkness upon the earth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light so what was god doing there he said god was separating the light from the darkness and he said i believe that now we're living in that hour again when god is separating the light from the darkness and he said he's pressing it into the other side of the world that the light might be manifested so how many of us this morning can can say that you know what he's talking about here because we just come out of this year of panic and fear and anxiety suicidal rates we're on the rise and we see people all around us turn into a socialistic style of government and turning away from god almighty you want to talk about darkness we're living in a world full of gross darkness but yet there is a group of people there is a person there is a people a church that god has called to say your darkness before you leave this place everybody will know that i'm still a god that i still heal that i still give that i still provide why because i'm going to do it through you through you through the vessel sitting here today listen but to the church i say shalom to the church i say shalom because it's god's peace he said that's what i want to bring to you this morning for the new years not looking back but we're looking forward to the break of a new day i don't know about you but i don't really want to look back to 2021. this is your new new year here's my message i don't want to look back to 2021. he says you're looking for a new day i'm looking for a new device where the years has been the joy that we've looked forward to the pressing the coming of the great light and now we see it breaking over the horizon i can't help but to believe we're a little bit beyond that horizon that he was looking at this was in the 60s we're a little bit beyond that horizon so where is that light he said it's breaking between mortal and immortality god's life in us god's life moving in us god's life blessing us he says we see it it's breaking between heavens and earth from earthbound sickness and troubled world into a bright shining day of immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal earth that shall never pass away and i say shalom that gives us a lot to look forward to that gives us a lot to believe in it's no secret this morning that we're living in the darkest of the hours on the face of the earth but when i look at that and if you begin to dwell on that it really gets to you but when you look at isaiah 60 and 1 it says arise and shine for light has come to you who is it talking about it's talking about you who has like come it's come to you and you and you and we've got to be able to accept that light brothers and sisters we all rise and shine this morning brothers and sisters we ought to be there be there because that light has come and the word is vindicated in our lives there was a vindicated word that came but what are you oh you why are you so quiet a vindicated word that came for you and that word is god we've established that that word is god and where is god here so you're the vindicated word for the hour that's deep that's deep so we can see god manifest you say brother brad i'm nobody and we can make all the excuses we want i'm too young i'm too old uh i i i'm just a lay member i'm just a housewife i'm this i'm that i'm uneducated i'm i'm all these things you can you can label whatever you want but god's not requiring that god's not requiring or requiring much of you he said when you look at brothers and sisters there's no age limit there's no age limit to get on this ride you know how disappointed it is for your kids when you go to the to the amusement park and they they walk up there and they're they're 10 9 10 11 years old and it says you got to be 12 to right get on this ride what a letdown it is for him but let me tell you god does not require any age requirements it doesn't matter if you're old or young it doesn't matter god wants us to do something for it there's no degree required you don't have to know anything at all let me tell you just live what you know live what you know live what you know to the fullest and see if it's the truth and keep moving forward and let god move in your life amen you know there was a great light i'm going to get to my message here in a minute but i couldn't help putting this off there was a great light that hung out into the wilderness and that great light hung right there in the wilderness and here comes stuttering and stammering moses and the light fell down into the burning bush and he told moses what to do and you know what he did he recognized that light forsook egypt left out of egypt esteeming the reproach of christ greater than the treasures of egypt there was another time saul was walking on the road to damascus and there was that great light hanging out there and he began to be drawn to that light looking at that same pillar fire that moses looked at and that pillar of fire sitting there hanging in saul being a hebrew he never would have worshipped that fell down and worshiped anything like that or called on it but as he began to look at it he was right there in a position where he looked at it and the light was so bright that it struck him to his knees and what did he say lord who are you lord who are you he says i am come from god and i go to god and that same one has come to manifest to be known to the people on that on the on that day the promises that he had made that day is the manifestation of that day and brothers and sisters i tell you this and sometimes we we have a hard time believing it but i said it's time to rise and shine and if we were to be able you know science has broken into a realm that my childhood didn't see many of your childhood didn't see but it's called virtual reality and science has broken into that realm a westin got one of those oculus virtual realities and if you've seen it it's quite if you see one here it's quite amazing i didn't know anything about it his his grandparents got it for him and he was over there and he was a boxing and carrying on i thought he's dad you got to come look at this he said look at this right and i seen him over there he was doing this so what is this crazy kid doing so i'll go and i'll put it on whoa whoa and i i'm standing on a board above a cliff and i mean anthony was like it was real it's all virtual reality for a reason people are running into walls with these things on their head they're fighting invisible people they're falling they're they're falling down steps because they're in a world that only they can see with those goggles on let me tell you believers if we could just put on the spiritual goggles of virtual reality we would see this morning angels around the banisters of this church we would see the pillar of fire lighting on your shoulder and this shoulder but we fail to see it because we don't look through god's eyes we need the virtual reality of god we'll get to our text here this morning how many this morning would say god i'll do we all we all look at that that way we want we want our life to be blessed we certainly don't want the opposite of that you know you got a good and the bad and you got a uh an evil and a good and and light and dark blessed and cursed so we don't want our lives to be cursed so every one of us sitting here would say i want my life to be blessed and i didn't bring a message i'm not bringing a message this morning of resolutions you know resolutions uh they they come easy resolutions are not absolute we can call them resolutions all we want but they're not absolute you say well i'm pretty good at mine let me ask you about that diet in about three months three weeks maybe three days three hours there you go resolutions are easy calm and easy go they vanish quickly but the message i bring to you this morning is a message of blessings because blessings from god they happen day after day after day after day after day after hey are you with me after day after day after day without failing that's the blessings of god that's what i'm looking for in this hour i'm looking for the blessings of god that are given these blessings that are productive i'm looking for the blessings that i'm talking about will change your life i desire these blessings and i look at this and i think god you're sovereign god you're holy you're wise you're faithful you're gracious that's the god that we have to ask for our blessings god almighty jabez realized this that was his prayer the message he took it to god and it ought to be the message to every believer brothers and sisters the lord god almighty is still in the blessing business can you interact with me this morning repeat after me the lord god almighty is still in the blessing business now you've confessed it now you've confessed it now i want you to go and believe it because upon your confession is what you'll live upon so now that you've confessed that you've spoken you believe in your heart that the lord god almighty is still in the blessing business take a hold of it take a hold of it and grasp a hold of it with all that you've got within you jabez the call the called prayer of jabez chronicles 1 4 9 and 10. but many times we put the emphasis on the wrong person many times the emphasis is is put up on uh jabez and people lift up jabez and they they hold him up with such high esteem for for making this prayer but jabez was just an ordinary man just an ordinary guy just like you and me nothing special about jabez that you ever hear in the bible nothing special did you ever see him do in fact all 66 books of the bible at page after page after page after page of scripture and he's a lot of two little verses hidden and begat the gap began began you talk about insignificant one but here's jabez what was different about him why did he get called out of all those begets to have his name mentioned because he saw the light he saw what god could do in his life and he wasn't afraid to address god and to take out and to call out to god in a time of trouble in 2000 bruce wilkinson he turned to this little man james he turned him into an international phenom you remember the book the prayer of jabez 2000 you could get t-shirts you could get coffee mugs you get mouse pads you can get everything you could imagine with the prayer of jabez there was a book for the prayer of jabez a prayer a book for the prayer of jabez for women a book for the prayer of jabez for children on and on and on he put this guy up on the map can any of you say that you really had heard jabez before 2000 think about think back no but this little prayer without a doubt this little miniscule bible personality is now a bonafide star and bruce wilkinson has done so much to affirm that the blessings of god to his righteous people who are practicing and believing on god we got to remember that the blessings of god though are the blessings of god that means that the prayer jabez is can't be used as some magical event to take place there's more to it than just a few lines in the bible when you begin to look at the prayer of jabez the prayer of jabez must not and cannot be used as magic and it it can't be used as i want you to god to grant me anything i ask anything i desire anything i pursue because it's easy from a natural state we get right there and we get we we get down there and we get ourselves in trouble because we want to take all this stuff to god and next thing you know we're let down we're in discouragement why is that let me ask you what did you really take to him a lot of times i'll find out that we take our wants our greeds our pledge well we got a few honest hearts god give me god give me god i want god bless thank you lord but that's not what we're talking about we're not talking about that kind of relationship god is god and we're not so what we have to do is we have to pray and we have to trust and we have to obey and we have to wait and we have to thank god no matter what happens how many times have you prayed and you prayed you prayed and you you never got an answer to that prayer yeah we've all been there you know why you didn't get an answer because god is god and that hurts us sometimes but god is not a dirty grandfather sometimes my kids very rarely but sometimes they come to me dad can i get and every now and then i have to say no this is desire i know deep down inside that's not what they need that's not going to help them that's not going to lead them to a good relationship you can't know the blessings of the jabez if god is not your father who bled and died on the cross think about that for us today we have to know a god of salvation for us today for the prayer of jabez to work we have to realize that god is our savior that god is our healer that god god is our redeemer he lived in the old testament we're living under the new testament jesus is our savior how many can say that and we sometimes we take that sin given on the face of the earth many times we want blessings but we're not living a life to be blessed brother butler i'm glad somebody's helping y'all you're doing good you're doing fine i i really really hope it blesses us by the end of the days but many times i said we want a blessing but we're not living the life to be blessed you see god blesses a life that is marked with purity purity you notice the first thing in first chronicles 4 9 tells about jabez what's it say jabez was more honorable breaks my christianity what breaks my heart oh and they give their heart to the lord they say they repent they say they're christians but there's never a change that takes place they quit no habits they still go where they always went they still watch what they always watched they still hear what that they always hear they still talk the way they always talk that's one of my first indicators so my cuddles man tell me they're a christian they're cussing like a sailor no that ain't gonna work that's not gonna work in god's plan but they say and that's why it's so sad because it's somewhere inside they think they are saved and it's tough you think about that that's a hard place to be in they don't realize it and they're still blinded to what true repentance is because true repentance says i'm sorry lord forgive me now i'm going to change and turn away from the things i used to do now i'm not asking you to be saints and angels this morning because we all got room to grow but if your daily walk is not getting a little closer or you're dedicating a little more time you need to question yourself i'm not here to question you but i'm here to challenge you this morning [Applause] but let me tell you i'm going to tell you this little story about myself my wife will tell you i'm the world's biggest procrastinator some of you are too huh you've heard your wife say that but i would be for for a long time before services i would meditate just in my mind on the word and things would come to me and i would know what i was going to do and i would know what i was going to preach and i would have inspiration and thoughts but i never would really sit down and really get deep into those things and try to figure out what direction god are you really trying to take me that's a pretty big confession right here so i would wait till about 12 midnight before sunday morning and then study from 12 sleep from two to four get back up at four finish from four to six six print my stuff off and then cram reading through it and making underlines and notes and and trying to say that's not doing god's service was all those messages in vain i don't think so but could i have given more of myself could i have dedic if he's willing to if he's if i'm willing to let him use it why don't i let him use me so i made a commitment it's not been easy i set my alarm at five o'clock and from five to seven now i study and i read and i pray i don't say this to lift myself up because i'm going to tell you what it's without him it's not going to happen but you know what i found is i've got a better relationship with god you say well i don't have time oh you can make time you can make time i didn't get up to six maybe maybe you don't have to get up maybe you got to get up at 5 o'clock well you can get up at four but what are we doing with our time that's allotted to us to use for god it's it's changed my my outlook it's changed my daily walk because for the first two hours of the day i've spent with him we sing the song i come to the garden and i feel like now i could go say i've been to the garden and so now in the morning when i get up i feel like i got a better outlook on the day ahead whether it's a good day or a bad day or whether i lose it or whether i don't it's still a good day because i've spent time in fellowship with god and he desires that and he blesses that and now when i go to bed i feel like i got to give at least 30 minutes to say hey let me tell you how the day went god so if you want it it's there he's willing he'll show up i promise you he will show up if you get up at four he'll show up he'll sleep in but what do we do with our life how do we get this pure life and and how do we how we get this blessings through purity i read this story and it's kind of crude but uh you know her brother brother around say quite a few crude things uh from the pulpit but he got his point across so i read this little story and it was talking about a a man who was attending this lavish dinner party and and he's there and this party is to be held in his honor and he's there and there's they're all dressed up and and he's very nice dressed well to do people there and sitting beside him is this elegant sophisticated stylish young woman and she's beautiful and she's elegant and i'm gonna have to do more research to see who it was but i believe he's a christian author that done this but i want to find out for sure before i call his name because i haven't read the book i just read the story and at one point during the meal he leaned over and whispered in the ear of this young lady would you sleep with me tonight for 25 000 did you hear what i said a few adults called it i'm not saying it again and the woman smiled and said yeah so he leaned over to her again this is a true story and whispered to her again he said how about fifty dollars she jumped up and she was horrified she lost her composure she yelled what do you think i am and he said we've already established what you are i'm just talking about the price let that sink in some of us around the church world around the message we need to let that sink in because sometimes we put a price on things that we think are blessed we put a price on the life we're living but some of us need to be careful that we don't let the price deprive us of what the true blessing is and we need to not let the devil to to get us to compromise on our commitment to god because people sometimes put the wrong emphasis on what a blessing truly is some of us need to put a sign around us that says not for sale because we easily when good things come along and it's easily accessible and ready to grab we jump ahold of it thinking that that might be god's blessings what did it cost you now you see the moral of the story what did it cost you what was it going to cost her psalms 139 says search me o god search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there's any grievous ways in me lead me to the way that's everlasting so god blesses a life that's pure now when you look at jabez and you look at the life he was living honorable doesn't mean perfect let's don't confuse the two so his life was not that of a perfect life no jabez like all saints of god he lived both a sinful and a righteous life at the same time because it's in there until we cross over if you feed that black dog enough you gonna act like a black dog so here he was both sinful and righteous at the same time but yet he's blessed you mean god can look down at a person like that a person who can live both sinful and righteous and still bless him you mean god can look at you when you're at your best when you're at your height as a christian and when you're at your lowest as a center and say i can bless that person that's what happened to jabez so being perfect is not a requirement for being blessed none of us in this world would ever be blessed there ain't a person standing here that would be blessed because none of us can live perfect only one that lived on the face of the earth was ever perfect that was jesus christ but the good news is that god's not looking for perfection he's in your life he's looking for the direction of your life are you with me god wants to know what are you on a day-to-day basis what are you doing how are you living which direction are you going because god will bless you if you're going in the right direction progressing in christ that's what i was talking about people who deceive themselves thinking they're living a christian life and never giving up anything and not doing anything to get closer to god here's what he's looking for direction progressing in the ways of christ what does matthew say he says seek ye first the kingdom of god and all his righteousness and all these things will be added to you that is the principle of less ability brothers we need to be blessable ask yourself this morning am i living a life before god that's blessable can god look down at me and actually say i'm going to give my blessings to him you know it's a big thing when a young man goes up to the father of his girlfriend and is asking for the blessings upon this marriage why is that such a big deal you know a lot of times a lot in the world now they don't even they don't pay no attention the truth of it is it is a big deal before that father because what he's coming and asking i'm asking you for your blessings upon me having your daughter as my wife and starting a family and what he's actually saying is do you think i'm worthy to have your daughter you can want a lot but are you worthy he's asking am i worthy to have her can i have your blessings we need to be blessable in order to be blessed but we have to be trusted god has to be able to come with a million dollars because i trust him i'm gonna bless him with with uh with a with a nice home and a farm because i trust him you think god could just be handing out money left and right to people he can't trust that that are claiming it happens in the world we see it all the time bad people get good things and good people at the time but when you're standing on faith and you're standing in the shoes of a christian as a shoes in the shoes of a christian could god trust you today with a million dollars oh in your mind we're all thinking yeah but boy i remember that new boat that new and if you don't have those things in your mind that's great but there's a lot of people god just can't trust with money it will destroy them it'll take them down to a place they've never been before in their life it'll make a man who who had a good family walk away from a good family it'll make a woman who had a good husband go out and chase other men money god's gonna be able to trust you listen to this this is the kind of person god can trust it was said that d.l moody we all know d.l moody he said his life and ministry drastically changed when he overheard someone say the world has yet to see what god can do through the man who is totally submissive to him let me read that to you again the world has yet to see what god can do through a man who is totally submissive to him and you know when d.l moody heard that do you know what he said to those people when he heard that conversation he said by god's grace i will be that man by god's grace i'll be that man i'll be that man i'll be that woman i'll be that child that god that will fully submit themselves to god and say god i'm all yours i'm all in and you can have what you want of mine you can do with me what you want i'm here that's d.l moody we've seen it in the life of the prophet how he walked away from so many things that he could have had he could have had more money at that day than we know what to do with it was offered to him checks handed to him but he said no no so i challenge you this morning to make that same commitment commandment and see what god does in your life when you say god i'm fully submitted then you're ready to receive some blessings fully submitted to god in his word and get rid of any of the impurities of your life i don't have to list them you know what they are you know the life you live i don't have to get in your living room i always found it amazing oh it's not amazing amusing preachers want to get up and blast this this and this and forgot to talk about what they they they had i don't need to tell you what's right and wrong you've got a still small voice that lives deep down in your heart and when you know something's going on it's not quite right you cringe the spirit and god inside oh cringes at the side or the sound or the vision of it but submit yourselves to god you know one of the most amazing and fascinating things about jabez is the meaning of his name his mother called his name jabez same because i bore him in pain how would you like that name i bore him in pain they were scripture reading bible toten people and they knew that in genesis chapter 3 that the pain in childbirth is part of a curse on the fall of humanity into sin so this wasn't a new concept of the birth pains but something had to happen there must have been something unusually painful about the circumstances surrounding the birth of jabez so much that while most mothers forget the pain within a few days right because you've got this little bundle of joy the pain didn't matter anymore you've forgotten the pain but here she is eight days later at the circumcision because that's when they named their child back then eight days after at the circumcision they would call out a name and here she is eight days later after she's been holding this little bundle of joy and man he's so good he's uh jabez can you imagine everybody in that church must turn around said what did she say pain you're going to name your child pain you're going to name your child grief you're going to name your child sorrow wow what a statement about his birth not just his birth but a prediction of his life his future a prediction of his destiny pain your life is full of pain because i bore you in pain that would be a tough life to live this name doomed jabez it doomed him but now looking through our natural eyes we would think naturally speaking you hear a name like that and you hear what it means and what happened to you would think and do all the days of his life he's going to be failure after failure there's no way that he'll ever prosper but brothers and sisters the good thing is that god doesn't look through those same eyes that we look through god doesn't look through the same eyes that we looked through because even though his name was jabez meaning grief and misery and pain god looked at him differently god had a different name for him and that name was blessed i want god's blessings on my life i want god to to take away the pain in my life how many of you have ever been through pain you've been through pain and anguish and suffering i want god to take that away but let's be honest pain is not a gift anybody wants pain is not something we're looking for pain is not something we ask for we don't want anybody to inflict pain on us how many of you have ever stood there and said here hit me with that baseball bat as hard as you can right in the nose you a fool if you if you did we don't ask for pain pain is like that box of rattlesnakes when they're delivered to your door you open it up and the first thing you do you close that thing back down because who wants a box of rattlesnakes and you put a stamp back on it and you put return to sender that's what pain is and naturally we would think a blessed life is a life that's painless and carefree we think a blessed life is happy we define blessings as in physical and material and financial terms so we we look at blessings as pleasure and not pain what do you hear when somebody's had a good week at work oh i was blessed this week maybe they got a bonus god bless me this week what does that do to the people that didn't get a bonus does it tell them god doesn't bless them the story of jabez it teaches us that the lord does not have to prevent limit or erase your pain in order to bless you but he can bless you in and through your pain because it's been said that it's doubtful whether god can use a man until he has first hurt him significantly [Music] you didn't wasn't expecting this was you you wasn't expecting this when i'm talking about blessings you mean that god is going to put us under a test and under the pressure to cause pain in our lives god uses the pain to develop us and what he wants us to be in psalms it says it's good for me that i was afflicted that i might learn your statutes mark it down there's purpose in your pain there's purpose in your pain you know sometimes as ministers and brother biter will vouch for this and just as christians in general sometimes we cry out for people god removed the pain from their life because we hate to see anyone suffer we hate to see anyone in pain but let me say it again there's a purpose in the pain that's not always easy to swallow you say well i don't consider pain a blessing you're right pain itself is not a blessing but there is a purpose behind the the pain and that's the blessing that comes behind it the pain qualifies us for a blessing you know there's candle makers and they warm that wax to just a point to where it's flowable and they put it into a mold and put a wick in it but you'll never know the power and what a blessing that candle is until it's burnt there's a difference between melting and burning sometimes we have to go through pain in our life grapes they're good as they are but we will never understand in bible times how they cherish the grape as going into the wine you can't make fine wine without grapes and you can't make fine wine without crushing those grapes those grapes have to be squeezed they would put them in a wine press and people would get her walk on top of those grapes and squish them and squish them and squish them if grapes could talk would they want to be one wheat must be ground in order to produce flour so all these experiences we bring you back to science many of you know here i'm i've never really spoke about this much in public but i'm going to speak about it today because it changed my life you know here that we some years several back years back we had some church issues it's no secret we had church issues i hope we all learned from it brother byler was hurt i was hurt some of you were hurt no doubt it's the biggest trial this church ever went through people left people quit there was anger and there was hatred well you're quiet because it's the truth and it was brewing and it was so bad it was painful it was so painful it was but it was during that time period that time period and several years it followed the sum of my what i feel like some of my greatest quality godly qualities and attributes were formed in me and i hope you can look back on that scenario that instance and say the same thing but it was there that i learned how to forgive i've been a christian for years i thought i knew what forgiveness was but i didn't not till i felt so hurt so let down so beat down and i say me brother balor was in the same shoes he's being honest it wasn't until i felt that pain and all that that i had to look at people and say i have to forgive them or i will never be able to move forward in my life and so there i had to be able to forgive i learned how to put someone and they put myself in someone else's shoes i learned how to feel for people in pain i learned how to have compassion i learned how to be patient and long-suffering you know being a young minister at that time i didn't have a lot of patience and you see that a lot in young ministers yeah they gonna tell you where the rubber meets the road and it's that way or no way and so i didn't have a lot of patience i didn't have a lot of long suffering but i learned how to give people time to develop yeah i learned these things in one of my hardest trials you say that was your hardest trial it was probably my family's hardest trial if you asked brother byler what was his family's hardest trial that was his family's hardest trial after after leaving here we went further on down the road trying to do a work for god pain in the end pain so much that i would watch my wife cry days after days after days what is going on and had a young child western was just a just a young toddler then big enough to talk going to school at the time i think wouldn't go to school anxiety fear panic what's wrong with you son i'm afraid somebody is gonna kill you that hurts that's painful but through all of that today i can say that was one of the greatest blessings of my life and i hope the same people that went through that experience have looked at it and been able to say the same thing that they're now able to forgive that now they will be able to understand and look through the eyes of someone with long suffering and patience and not give up on everybody just because they're not where you're at there's a song we all familiar with says god will make this trial a blessing though it sends me to my next though my tears flow like a river yet in him there's sweet relief god will make this trial a blessing the whole wide world we'll see you know brother terry tidwell wrote that song it was by the mckameys i think the next year went viral if that's the word we would use for today and i i never sat down and asked brother terry maybe some of you has heard his testimony about the song but no doubt you can't write a song like that unless you've been in that pain you can't you can't sing a song like that unless you've heard so bad that you know what it means for a trial to be a blessing the story behind that song the inspiration behind that song came from hurt and pain and anguish but from that song from the pain in that song that was written it has blessed and helped millions i said millions of christians make it through the day what a blessing how will god look down at brother terry when he when he's when he approaches him he said son i know that was painful i know it hurt for you to share the things i know it hurt you to put in words what you've been through but i want you to look at the millions of people that have been blessed through that ministry you see what i mean sometimes they come from painful circumstances you know a hammer you take a 16 ounce frame and hammer and that's one of the handiest tools you can have every carpenter's got one they're in every drawer and every kitchen of every household right everybody's got a hammer carpenters they treasure this tool they treasure this hammer and it and it's useful it's essential if you're going to drive those nails into place each blow forces them to bite deeper and deeper and deeper as the head of that hammer pounds and pounds and pounds on the head of that nail but did you ever think did you ever stop and think about the nail if it had reason and emotion wouldn't it give you a different story yeah to the nail the hammer is brutal it's relentless it's a master that doesn't quit it's an enemy that loves to beat it into submission that would be the nail's view of the hammer and it's correct except for one thing the nail forgot the most important fact of his painful life brothers and sisters the nail and the hammer are both held by the same carpenter the same carpenter decides when he reaches into his nail pouch of believers and holds that nail pulls that hammer out of its hoop he decides the carpenter decides which nail and which hammer is best to fit the job and it's the carpenter who swings the hammer did you ever think about it that way your pain sometimes you're hurt sometimes the things you go through it's god allowing him to come your way it's the decision of a sovereign carpenter it can be brutal verse 9 tells us the reality of the life of jabez he was a he was a godly man with painful life we've determined that verse 10 tells us how he responds to that life it says he called upon the god of israel saying oh that i would be the oh that thou would bless me and enlarge my border and that your hand might be might with me and that you would keep me from harm so that i'm so that might not bring me pain brother and sister you know why the prayer of jabez was so popular the prayer of jabez became so popular because jabez was a person that we can relate to think about it he's not mentioned in the bible of ever being wise strong he didn't have the wisdom of solomon the strength of david the riches of the kings you know i've been studying too on the queen of sheba and man you're talking about some riches when she came to see the the king there were some riches exchanged hands there this is not japanese no this is this is an ordinary guy he wasn't celebrated for being gifted or talented or accomplished in anything in the bible find it i'd like to know but he's just like you and me everyday job but the one thing that made him special was the fact that he knew how to pray this one little verse in prayer tells us that prayer is all we need to experience the blessings of god it all happens after your prayer spurgeon listen to this this is good spurgeon said it this way prayer is the slender nerve that moves the hand of omnipotence in studying anatomy and physiology we have nerves running all through our bodies and these nerves are going through our hands through our fingers up our upper arms and into our spinal column and up into the brain to send the signal to our hands to move and it's the slender nerve of prayer that causes the omnipotence of god to move you think about that god moves when you pray those are god's provisions jabez says oh lord that you would bless me enlarge my border bless me that's personal bless me enlarge my border sometimes we we're afraid to pray to god that way we're afraid to ask for anything for ourself why is that we're afraid to say god i need you in my life i need you to do this and increase my borders but not jabez he knew who he was he was personal he was bold he was confident he was specific in his prayer he was praying believing that god was willing to hear he was praying knowing that god cares about his pains his needs and his hopes he was praying believing that there was nothing hard for god so why is that the book of james tells us you don't have because you don't ask and yet we wonder where is god in all of my life did you ask i believe this is the number one reason god don't answer our prayers when we go on and we look this is our sincerity our our our our commitment our regularity to pray to god our earnest us to pray to god because james in in chapter four goes on to say in simple terms you ask and you do not receive because you ask wrongly or spend it on your passions i like that interpretation of that because that brings it personal down to us and many a christian need an education and how to pray yep i have to be honest and saying sometimes i shake my head when people go to pray i i scratch my head and and and i just wonder you see these people sometimes start out lord bless first thing they say lord bless lord give lord i need lord's supply and i just kind of like wow that's not the way the most the lord but the bible teaches us to approach the father that knoweth all things that we have need of before we even ask him in this manner pray ye our father this is jesus speaking our father plural jesus was saying he's more than just for me he's for you too our father he's making it social here's your first tick tock social media jesus is saying let's make this thing go viral here it is social our father which is in heaven acknowledging that he is a god of a kingdom that he is a god of a kingdom and of the domain that he is our lord that he's king brother mother just preached on all that god is he is a king but he is the king of kings he is the lord of lords his kingdom is a kingdom that we will have only come unto us there's many kingdoms but it's his kingdom and that's what this bible is telling us our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name you know what hallowed means it means somebody who's holy who's revered who is honored who is cherished who is consecrated so when jesus prays that he first off say god don't send me to the cross no our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done not mine but yours god thy will be done on earth just like it is in your kingdom in heaven do you see the difference in how you ask and how you approach god god give me give me give me give me glass blessed bless i need need want want or god of the most high that i bow down to that i cherish that i adore that i love that save me in my sins i fall at your face my knees bend at the very presence of your sight could you have mercy on me today then you're connecting with a god when you fall when you when you go to god in that presence then you find yourself connecting with god in a special kind of way then you'll start seeing your blessings arise forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us you're acknowledging i'm a sinner i'm no better than anybody else and i got to forgive them so that you'll forgive me i like us here where he talks about he's called upon god to bless him to enlarge his border i'm gonna try to finish up here but the next thing he says and that your hand might be with me so here jabez is now he's praying that god the power of god's hand would be with him the the prayer request for god's powerful presence complements the previous request that god would bless him so think about what i just said there jabez was wise enough to know that he needed both god's provisions and god's presence it's not good enough that god just gives to you and gives to you god can do that to anybody but the thing about a blessing is god gives it to you and his presence is there with you can you imagine the misery you would be in if all you had was god's provision and none of his presence god could give you truckloads of money but without his presence you wouldn't know where to spend it and how to give and how to bless and how to give to those who have it in the kingdom of god god can bless you with all the health in the world and if he was healthy and you was a a masculine man and you was oh man in your majesty and so forth but yet you didn't have a family to share that health with because you walked out on them can you notoriety everywhere you went somebody knows you everywhere you got me and a guy come up to me he said how you doing i said good he said i know who you are i said okay who who okay who are you aren't you that guy that was in that movie you got the wrong guy i didn't know who he was talking about he said i'm sorry i got an elevator left i should have said well but notoriety can you imagine having that kind of notoriety but having no heavenly home because the presence of god didn't come along with the provisions of god look at the prodigal son think about that the pro political son he foolishly thought he could live independent off of his father so he goes out into the world he says i'm going to live my life the way i want to live it bless god bless you father i'm out of here yeah that worked for a that worked for a good a good good wage there it went real good for him for a little while but eventually he ran out of daddy's money eventually he had all that he was good as long as he had what god what his daddy was giving him as long as the provisions of daddy kept flowing through but daddy finally said you know what if you can't grace me with your presence my provisions are cut off and it was only then that he recognized and remembered the goodness of his father when he was down there eating with the swine he's eating with the swine he remembers you know what i think this may be a better idea because i've come to the conclusion that i'm better off to be a slave in my daddy's house than a playboy on my own because i'm living with the hogs and jabez was praying here he wanted god's hand to be with him jabez didn't want to be like this prodigal son jabez didn't want that prodigal son experience he prayed that the lord would keep it keep me at your arms length we need to be at the arms length of god that's where i want to live my life at a place where no matter what i'm going through no matter what what's going on in my life that i can say god wrap your arms around me and hold me in tight don't let nothing pull me away from you we heard stories of those people that went through the devastation and a tornado and they said that at the last minute at the last second mamas and daddies was grabbing their kids and wrapping their arms around as tight as they could just so they wouldn't be snatched away that's where i want to be so close to my god that no matter what trial no matter what storm no matter what wind comes my way he will wrap his arms around me and hold me so tight that i can't be snatched away jabez knew the old famous saying that we've heard take you further than you want to go sin will cost you more than you want to pay and sin will keep you longer than you want to stay brothers and sisters we need to pray the distance i'm trying to put another number to it just trying to think maybe i don't know from here to the back of the back of the vestibule of the foyer there and following behind them as a grown man just and i don't know what he's saying while we're on their heels and he's just flapping his jaws and this goes on he goes i'm watching all the way i'm trying to figure out what in the world from me and he said something and it triggered weston and he turned around and i knew right then that pile right there before you could blink an eye and i asked him who do you think you are well i'm the athletic director i don't care quit talking to these boys that way and this is happening of course in the middle of the gym floor right on the sidelines and i felt like i was pretty cool i felt like i was pretty calm kind of like the hulk he wouldn't want to see me when i'm angry joe said what happened so i began to tell her the story she said i've never seen your face that red in all my life she said you were madder than i've ever seen you come to find out other people was fixing to come to my support i had people fixing to come down out of the crowd pastors of churches to come to my one one of the pastors wives asked him said what was he going to do why was he going he said i don't know but i just felt like i needed to be there and you know i i took they just kind of told me to back away that guy walked the other way i i'm good so i went and sat down and i got home i said you know what joyce i can't be doing that i said i'm a minister of the gospel i can't let those kinds of things get to me but what was it was my son somebody was mistreating my son so can you imagine the wrath of god when the devil mistreats you that was my son but i told her i said i've got to be able to handle those things better i said what if i would have hit him preacher clark's athletic director goes to jail that's the headline but i said we got to do better i got to protect me from me now i'm being honest with you now you point your finger back and say i got to protect me from me there's a story and i'm closing i promise there was a story duke raynold lived in the 14th century you ever heard of him good lived in the 14th century he lived a life of indulgence and he was extremely overweight and so much that they called him gracious which means fat the people mocked him he was still a ruler he was a duke he was had had lordship over this place and this went on and went on and and one of these that one day his brother edward and him got into a conflict they got into a big battle so edwards leaves and he leaves and he comes back and he has a revolt against reynold and he overtakes them so edward now overtakes the city he captures reynolds but he promises him i'm not going to kill you and he thinks about how he can torture him and a scheme to get rid of him so he says i'm going to let you live in the castle so he places him in the castle at newark and he builds a room around him and he builds this room around him just a normal ordinary room and he says i'm not going to put any bars on the windows i'm not going to put any locks on the doors you're free to go anytime you can make it through the door remember i said he lived a life of indulgence he didn't fit through the door so you would think a man in his own right mind would start cutting back a little bit edward knew his weakness so every morning bacon eggs biscuits toast sausage gravy here brother here's your breakfast lunch mcdonald's wendy's burger king have it your way have it your way brother all you can eat supper filet mignon steak baked potato eat up brother you're free to go do you think he could turn it away he was a captive to his own self and he ate and he ate and he ate until there was no hope at all of him coming out his brother actually ended up dying i think in a tragic event and was no longer the ruler of him but he couldn't get out of the room and he died of health issues go figure like a year later a prisoner captive to his own self i thought my what a story what a story to think that many times people get themselves locked up they lock themselves away in rooms that have open doors there's no reason to be locked up we have open doors we have freedom we have god and we can't break free because of our own stubbornness because of rebellious attitudes sinful ways lack of discipline i think this morning we need to join jabez and ask god to protect us from us i like what the last verse in verse 10 says the last sentence in verse 10 says and god granted what he asked i've been studying the good news the gospel a little book i got called what is the gospel i've been reading through it because you know i've always said i'm gonna preach the gospel and then i got to thinking what is the gospel who knows what the gospel means good news it's the good news but there's more to the gospel than just the good news because in the gospel there's hard times there's sinful life and a sinful life that has to give to repentance and repentance which gives salvation that's the gospel so here in this text where jabez is asking to be blessed he's been through the hard times he's been through the pain and he's now seeing the gospel it's the point where god is willing to hear and answer his prayers jeremiah 33 says call unto me and i will answer you i will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known matthew 7 says i ask and it will be given unto you seek and you will find knock and it will be open hebrews 4 draw near to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in a time of need brother sisters god hears and answers our prayers let's stand to our feet i've kept you long enough you love the lord this morning how many would say god i need that prayer of jabez in my life an honest confession this morning as as we go before the lord in prayer here in just a minute we have to be honest because if we're not honest we're cutting ourselves short but we need those blessings in our life heavenly father as we bow our hearts before you we look at you lord with such majesty and even though you're so majestic in all that you do and there's no fault or failure within you you have the compassion and the grace to look down upon us and have mercy upon our sinful ways lord lord as we've read this little scripture today and tried to highlight some of the things that took place in it lord i trust it's been a blessing i trust it's been a lesson that you could we could take home with us this week and try to learn and and try to live every day of our life lord just just one day at a time and lord committed before you asking for your help your blessings upon our life lord many times we find that the the blessings we give come in painful natures painful ways the lord it's to bring honor and glory to you to show that you're an almighty god lord jesus we just pray for this year to be a blessing and prosperous and and a benefit to the to the believers around the world lord may the funds that come into this church the monetary blessings that come into this church may they be used accordingly and efficiently to bring honor and glory to your kingdom may the gifts that are in this church musical gifts and talents and singers lord may their gifts be used to bring honor and glory and and to lift your name up on high we just pray a special blessing upon our pastor lord we ask lord that you give him uh more more time uh so that he could be with you more lord jesus uh to to be able to dedicate and consecrate himself so that he could bring the word as you would have it to to touch our ears to draw us closer to you the ministry that goes on in the church here may it just be a blessing to the people father lord jesus said as the people of the church just the believers lord we pray blessings upon their lives their homes their children their families all that they do may just be lord a reflection of what the the good things that you have in store for us as we said earlier that there's a darkness upon this land but through your blessings through your your life lord through the holy spirit that lives within us there's hope and without that hope we're nothing but because of that hope we have a hope of a future of a kingdom of a land beyond the river just beyond the river lord jesus where we'll never grow old we'll never grow sick we'll never shed a tear for a lost love and we'll never hurt or be in pain for anyone around us lord that's suffering lord it'll just a land beyond the river it's a promise that we have when we thank you for it lord we want to tell you we love you we appreciate you give you all honor and glory for all that you do in jesus name amen sister becky i wanna i'm gonna try to sing sing that song
