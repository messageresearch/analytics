[Music] i once was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i see twas grace twas grace that talk god bless you grace be my face relieved how precious [Music] i first [Music] amen you remember when you first believed how much you meant to you how much the word meant to you how much living this life meant to you oh it should have never fade away every day that we serve him ought to be a better day it ought to be a more glorious day you say but you see all that's going on oh i see but god sees too and god knew that we would go through things god knew that we would battle through situations he knew sicknesses would be upon us he knew that the country would be so fearful of everything that they'd want to shut everything down but yet god picked us to live in this time and see i'm just the type person i get excited to know that god picked me to live in the hardest time he ever created he picked me to live in this time when the world would hate me he picked me when he knew that all of the tactics of the devil would be in foreplay he picked me to fight this battle and so you know what i tell you i just i just look sometimes and say god help me to be happy with what you've picked me to do help me to be satisfied with what you've picked me to fight in this day because i i'll be honest as a human i hate it i hate not being able to fellowship i hate not seeing everybody at church i hate seeing people that in contact with this and you got to be smart don't don't look down on you know i i was talking to somebody earlier this week i said you know when covet started there was message preachers that got up and and tried to twist a quote and tried to make it seem like the bride couldn't get coveted and now some of them's got covered what are they saying now it don't work that way see because covet is not a pandemic it's not a it's not something it's just something we're going through but yet the fear that's behind it is enraged by the devil himself and now i'm not saying don't be smart brother joseph says it this way i love the way he says it he said there is nothing wrong with mixing common sense with your faith there's nothing wrong with believing god to protect you but don't go fight the enemy on your own make sure you're doing what god's asked you to do and and i look at this time and i think god people are letting down all over the place because they're getting fear inside of them and it's washing their faith out but yet we know it's going to be a battle to the end and if we realize it's going to be a battle to the end then we need soldiers to stand up and say i'm ready to fight this battle i'm ready to stand for the word when nobody else will i'm ready when everybody wants to critique and they want to shut down and they want to say you're a bunch of fanatics i'm ready to stand up and say but i am the bride i am the one that he's coming to get and i'll tell you what i do i get to get excited thinking about it i i'm just this little country boy from middle tennessee and i don't know a whole lot but when he shows me something i get excited and so i thought tonight and and that i went back and forth on what to preach and and brother tom put me on the spot i thought i was going to have wednesday night off and here he is going to brother jewels and you know i send my prayers with him and brother joel and then my mind goes and i preach this message back at home a few months ago and i titled it scars of victory and i began to think as i would begin to think on this topic and i would begin to think god that's we need to look at what we're going through in a different light we don't need to look at it as depression we don't need to look at it as it's such a battle that i don't know if i can make it but we need to look at it that he can put nothing upon me that i can't overcome he knows my weaknesses he knows where i need help at he's not going to allow the devil to overtake me why because i am part of him so these scars that i have are actually scarrings of victory and i believe if we turn in the bibles the second corinthians and and i wrote down a little nod here i thought about jesus brother brandon said 33 year old and looked well beyond in his 50s why because he was battle scarred why because people would try to take him down people tried to accuse him people would try to tempt and people tried to kill him they tried to do everything he looked well beyond his age but he was still victorious even in death he was victorious second corinthians speak of paul and i want to refer this back to paul tonight if i can but second corinthians 12 verse 6 through 10. paul's speaking of the thorn in his flesh paul's speaking of a scar that's in his life that he has to deal with on a daily basis and he said for though i would deserve glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbid at least any man should think of me above which that he saith me to be or he that heareth of me at least i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in my flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me least i should be exalted above measure i thank god for a man of god like paul that can realize god is using me in a mighty way god is bestowing revelations upon me god is bestowing the truth of god is building his church upon the foundation of faith upon what i am going to be preaching to the people but yet if we're not careful the men and women are going to look to me so god allows the devil to buffet me and come against me he allows him to put a thorn in his flesh that i now not be exalted above measure for this thing i besolved the lord thrice that it might depart from me a man of god like paul goes and knocks on heaven's door three times brother says one time sitting in jail knocking on the door saying god why do i have to put up with this he said but he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee paul whatever you're going through my grace is sufficient for you little bride whatever you're going through my grace is sufficient for you he said my body said my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness god let me see it's not how strong i am but it's how strong it is it's about how i can humble down before his word and say god help me in the situation he said because he said my my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore what i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me paul's saying oh yeah i've got a thorn in my flesh i've got a scar but dear god i pray that i can be happy in what you've given me to deal with i can be happy in what you've given in my life in the scars in my life in the imprisonment in my life that i can have joy in what you've done for me whether i glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in my infirmities in reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong heavenly father lord you saw this night before the foundation of the world lord the numbers don't matter lord there's some that are viewing online that couldn't be here that would want to be here god you see our sicknesses you see our needs you see how we're looked upon and lord you see all that we go through but dear god you're coming to encourage us tonight to let us know lord that you know what no matter what it is i've been through no matter how many times i've been in this no matter what the world thinks it is proof to me that i can rejoice and be glad in the situation that i'm in god i asked you tonight lord to allow me to yield myself to thee lord to move my mind and my thoughts and go in the direction that you would see pleasing you know the people's needs i'd ask you to speak to them lord lord give us the strength and be with us in your lovely name the lord jesus christ amen and you be seated and i thought of paul and i thought of a great man that paul was and how that paul himself as we know before the trip to the road to damascus he was known as saul and he was known as saul but he saw that man the old man was a persecutor of the very ones that loved jesus that he stood against him in all that he did that that he persecuted even unto death that he would go through he would hold the code of and watch them as they'd stone a man in the name of jesus and he would stand there and come against everything that was right but yet god knew something in him was him he knew there was a seed down in paul and god had to work for paul and i look at us i'm beginning to think you know most of our problems is from the youth as we go up and even in the middle age and even into the ill photos of the church we begin to think where our biggest problem lies is we can't get our minds off everything we used to do you know when we get together everybody wants to tell how big of a drunk they was or or how big of a gambler they was or or how big of a road racer they was they want to talk about the old man and the old sacrifice you know and then with scars in our lives that we'll never forget but yet god is not looking at them scars he's looking at that seed inside of every one of us that he's saying but they are my daughter they are my son they are who i've asked them to be see god don't look at it as failure as god looks at it as overcomings god don't look at it when you make a mistake and you get back up he don't look at it that you failed he looked at it that you overcome that situation that the devil placed something in front of you and yeah you may have stumbled and tripped you may have done something wrong but yet you had the strength inside of you to rise back up and say i'll keep marching on in your name lord what is it it's a scar of victory all of these scars in our life it makes us who we are it forms our character it forms our mind in the natural sense it makes us who we are in life it makes us a good manager or a good uh factory worker or a good truck driver or whatever it may be it makes us who we are but in the spiritual sense it's no different the things that paul went through here it made him who he was going to be it made him realize there is another side of this there's a more of a reason than ever for paul to stand for the truth because he knew the other side and in mind in your lives it's the same way if we look at it that way spiritually speaking most of us was raised under an under the correct doctrine of the church most of us raised in such a way in many years of our life we've been taught truth down through time we've been told the right way in the wrong way but you know what so many times we want to look back at all of our mistakes we want to look back at all of our failures and say oh god i can't do this but yet the very reason you have that scar is because that scar is going to guide you to what god has in store for you you realize if we quit looking at them as mistakes and start looking at them at victory how much more encouraged we could be no wonder paul could sit there and begin to say i'm not going to let it get me down no more i've prayed thrice to my father i've asked him to take this from me but every time god would look down and say but paul my grace is sufficient he's telling paul you've got a reason to be that way i've got you there for an idea i've got you in this condition for a reason or how many times we want god just to destroy everything in our past destroy everything in our mind look it's not going to be that what it's a remembrance of the failed you but what is it it's also a remembrance that you come from that and you're no longer who you used to be it's a victory in your life it's a victory in what you come from no one in brother brennan would refer to it and refer to the scripture and he would show us that paul would look into that bright light on the road of damascus and no doubt that affected his eyesight in such a way brother brennan would go back in several places and you'd say as paul got older he began to write in such big letters because he couldn't see his own writings what was it yeah it may have got paul down for a time it may have got me and you little down for a time but in reality it turned us back to the word of god and made us realize but this is what i overcome i want to read a little text it just so many of you probably heard it but i was reading the scribes reading it 1953 palmer and locust got a running caterpillar brother brandon refers this story and it may be a little empty i'm not real i usually don't read a full quote but i want to read this it's on my heart brother branham's referring to his story and he said i remember one time i was reading the story where caesar was going to make a great parade and minnie was going to follow him and there he was sitting in his chair just riding down the street and when they did he stopped over there and he says i want to be with my officer tomorrow and to meet me here he says and i want that one honorable man to ride by my side in this great parade tomorrow and all of the officers and their trim to their plumes they polished their shields and everything that fixed up the big tags on them and so forth and they was passing by seizure each one of them with a big fine plume walking straight and sturdy passing by and caesar looked at them sitting there and after a while a little bitty old doughboy kind of looked like me huh he did a little round in the middle see little bitty old dough boy one of those little footmen come by and he was all cut and scratched and scarred and bruised and he passed by and just bowed his head and started to run off he felt so embarrassed standing there before the great emperor and he started to run away and directly the emperor said wait a minute he said who are you said come here he said yes my lord he walked up to him and he fell down like that and he raised up and he says my you're cut up awful said where did you get all of them scars and things and he said on the battlefield fighting for my lord i may not be the most elegant thing you've ever seen i may not be able to put four or five words together to make sense i may not be smart enough to confound anybody in a humanly flesh way i may not look good i may not be the handsome character that my wife thought i was but you know what god placed me here for a reason he placed me to be on the battlefield for the lord he placed me to take the scars that the devil would throw and stay in step with my lord he placed me here to fight until the end of my day he says what he said how'd that happen he said on the battlefield fighting for my lord lebron said he said you climb up here and you sit down he said you're the one that deserves it why because he had scars from the battlefields he didn't try to get out of temptation he didn't try to get out of the fight he faced the enemy on the front lines he stood for the word of god he stood for his lord he stood for his emperor he says it may cost me my arm but i'll stand for what i believe in i'll stand for the truth little christian little bride did not that's the ones that god are looking for he's not looking for the perfect and elegant that can hang his suit just right and they can walk down the line and look like he come out of the catalog no he's looking for a bride that's willing to stand on the front lines of the enemy and stand before god and say whatever you have devil i shall not stumble at the word of god i will fall not to your temptations why because these scars don't bother me no more devil you realize when you take a knocks at me that just shows how strong i am when you realize when you swing at me and you make contact and i lose an or i'm in the battle i'm not going to fall to what you have but i'm going to stand even so greater in my life why because i'm gonna look at you devil and i'm gonna tell you greater is he that's in me that's in the world and i've read the back of the book devil these scars ain't going to stay with me forever because i got a perfected body coming and when that body comes paul ain't going to have to worry about his outfit no more paul ain't going to have to worry about winning big letters anymore because his eyes are going to be made well some of us we're not going to have to worry about all of the games that we have that we fight day in day out with the devil of all of the mistakes we've done but we're going to be able to stand and say but by faith i have received righteousness in my lord's name the brethren goes on down and he says he says enough with your ddds he said i want to show some marks of the power of the gospel of jesus christ when i step forward brother says one day when i step forward i want to show the lord the scars that i have received on the battlefield i want to show him the time that i went overseas and the devil tried to give me a sickness i want to show him the many times that he would stand in line and pray for people and miracles happened around him and he was burping up ulcers from the inside of him he says i'm not going to let this overcome me i am going to stand through this scars i am gonna show the devil i have an overcoming power within me little bride god is looking for us tonight to be that one to be that one in 2020 that we live in when the world's falling apart why does it surprise us we know the world's going to fall apart they don't have a chance they turned down their savior they turned down the word of god they went the devil's way brother branham preached the message entitled it it's satan's eating they will live again don't let the devil discourage us and get us down this is an encouragement tonight to let us know we've read the back of the book we know what's going to happen the scars is just part of the trials it's just part of the tribulation it's just part of what we're going through to get there god give me the encouragement god give me the power to stand this place paul wood and look and say but he doesn't tell me his grace is sufficient i'm not going to even pray about it no more i want to stand on faith in what god gave me he set his grace to sufficient he said he wouldn't let nothing come upon me that i couldn't handle he said he would never see his righteous begging for bread he said that we would be gone before the first bomb fell i ain't going to stand on his word greater than i've ever stood on his word and when the devil enters this little mind because it is little and he enters this little mind and he begins to tell me oh but you've failed him so many times well devil let me tell you the rest of the story you know that time when you come into my life and you convinced me that smoking was all right and i went and took a cigarette and began to smoke yeah yeah that's the time i'm telling you jonathan i'm telling you well let me tell you the rest of that story god come down on our heart and condemn our heart that it wasn't right and i laid them things down and never went back to them why because i have an overcomer living side of me there will ever scar that you point at in my life i can give you an overcoming story when i'm looking at your life you look in your own heart and you look in your own life every situation in your life every time that you fail god every time that you've done something that you knew wasn't right god gave you a testimony of overcoming i look at me and like brother joel i look at men like brother ron you talk about black eyes how many black eyes have they given the devil the devil keeps punching them the devil keeps giving them scars the devil keeps giving them sicknesses but yet they gather their strength and they get back up and they say this is the word of god for her day this is the faith that i believe in you could take this body you can do whatever you want do with it but you're not changing the man on the inside see that's the faith that paul was giving us from the beginning paul was standing there from the beginning i take pleasure in my infirmities i take pleasure into all of our distresses i take pleasure in all of these things that i've done wrong hold up children tonight if we could look at ourselves that way if we could just you know i almost reached a message loosening god out of our box because you know what if we could get our mind and open the box and allow god to speak to us what he could do for us tonight nothing is impossible to the word of god nothing is impossible to our lord jesus christ but we are too busy looking at each other's in our own mistakes to allow god to move god comes down and he says he says i'll give you whatever you have need of well you know i believe that one time i'll get it right after i believe that i ain't the greatest trial of my life yep that's how it works because soon as you take a step here comes the devil as soon as you take a stand as soon as you stand up and say i believe in divine healing you might want to go take some vitamin c because something's coming your way you're fixing to be tested do you really believe that but you know what i don't care if i am sick i believe god is a divine healer i don't care if i die because with 19 god is still a healer in our day god can still heal us just because i die doesn't take it away from god of what he can do god help us to see that we're living brother goes on down he says enough about your ddds i want to show some real marks of the power of the gospel of jesus christ when i stood forward yes sir he said take your stand he said yes sir show some scars you ain't had no testimony yet if you ain't got a scar you know there's a couple ways you can look at that i warned one brother one time he told me he said oh god he said brother ron's testimony of going through the fire i'd like to have that testimony i said i don't i don't want to burn like that i don't want that testimony but you know what each and every one of us has got our own scars and our lives we got our own things in our life that we failed we got our own things that we did we've got our own things that sometimes we didn't even fail god it was just something god put us through to reassure the foundation to solid up our foundation where we stood to let us know that we can trust him when the chips are down that we can't trust him you know what colby 19 is to me another test for god's children where are they going to put their faith the bride of christ how their faith is in the word well you don't know this family member's got it this family member's got it i got a cousin over here that died from it hey that's just symptoms of what it is you you realize all of us sitting in here the rapture don't take place it's very likely all of us are going to get sick and die or something hey let's just be honest we're not eternal beings these are flesh bodies some of us are going to die younger some of us are going to die older but you know what if the rapture don't take place the likelihood is great most of us in here will die of a sickness i didn't say be stupid and go hug the people that's got it see some of the devil's trying to tell one of you that right now no i'm saying youth coming says if my wife's got the flu i don't hang all over i put her in the bedroom and spray lots are at the door let's be honest let's use common sense here let's use a little bit of wisdom that god has given us and granted in our beings we we've dealt with things we've dealt with sicknesses we've dealt with flus we've dealt with pneumonias we failed with all kinds of things the devil has thrown out there why don't we let the last one why do we let one of the last ones get us so bothered and bother our faith so much that fear begins to creep into us it's just another scar that we could show the devil i overcome another trial that you laid before me another dart that you aim to the bride another weapon of destruction that you tried to destroy the bride look devil we overcome it again let me show you scar victory some of us message believers some of us that abroad has had it and may get it before it's over with and they're going to live through it and they're going to stand up and they're going to give a testimony god protected me when i was sick god gave me healing power when i needed the most he said well brother so-and-so is he his wife with stephen's wife you know he she come in contact with somebody you know no let's be smart let's stay away let's be smart but it ain't no reason for them to fear for their loss it ain't no reason to worry about what's going to happen because if he is living inside of you and you're born again it's just another scar that you can show the enemy i am that overcomer i am that bride that he so i just get a little excited sometimes i know i get real excited sometimes when i look at people they tell me they believe this message for 30 years for 40 years for 50 years and then they go oh god what are we going to do we're going to keep worshipping him we're going to keep praising him we're going to keep on singing the songs of god we're going to keep on listening to the tapes we're going to keep on reading our bibles we're going to keep on praying to our father we're going to keep on going to church when we can why because something inside of us desires to hear from god that's more important than anything i live for and one day i'm going to have the ability to stand with you and we're going to stand there before god and we're going to be battle scarred all up and god's going to look down and say yep that's my bride though i put her on the front line she stood for my word though i allowed the enemy to come with everything that he had though i allowed the devil to bring war against this nation like he's never brought it that i know i allowed the devil to bring in all the demonic powers he ever had control of and he brought him upon this age hey devil she's still standing because that's my bride that's the one that i molded after me that's the one i wanted from the very beginning of time that's the apple of my heart that's the one i give everything she has need of and though she's got scars in her life though she's been on the battlefield guess what she's standing victorious a bunch of earth that is burning with ashes why because i called her to be with me he realized brother said in several places and we're going somewhere else now but mother and said in several places the only thing that hinders god is your doubt is your unbelief that's the only thing that hinders brother brandon said in one place he says i'd rather have i don't know if i don't know the exact number don't quote me on it but you know what he said he makes a comment he said i'd rather have 10 or 12 truly born-again christians serving god than to have a church full of thousands why because he knew in that church full of thousands there was too many doubters sitting around that was hindering the moving of the spirit but he looked down in time and he looked down in air time and he could see churches spread across land i don't know if y'all pay attention but true message churches most of them are drilling in numbers why because it's a hard battle that we're in in 2020 it's a hard battle that we're fighting in 2020 and only the fittest of the fittest it's going to come out you you can't make believe anymore look i realize brother brennan had a gift to discernment and could see your thoughts and see you see your mind and i thank god i don't have that because i'd go nuts but you know what even in his day there was people that surprised him when they turned out against him there was people that hurt him when they turned their back on him and walked away from him there was people that that would do that but yet they could go up to that very point with their suit on standing by the other prophet acting like they loved you you can't do that no more you're either for god or you're against him you're either going to stand for truth or you're going to go by the way of the wayside look i got family that ain't coming to church i ain't talking about yours i'm talking about mine i love mine to the very bed i had a conversation with my own mama this past weekend and was talking about different scenarios and and then possibly her dying before me and i said i'm not i'm not believing that and then i said it before i realized i said it but thank god that i just said it i said i'm going in a rapture where are you going to be then he said over there and started crying why because they know what the truth is they've left church they've left serving god the way they should but they know what the truth is and they can see in our lives that we're serving a living god and they realize this is the time that the bride is going to be made manifest this is the time through all of her scars through all of her stumblings through all of her failures she's gonna be the victorious one why because she just believes in him and she believes every need that i have is met in him so man if we don't get donald trump back in we're just going to fall to pieces huh if it's god's will for donald trump to get in he'll get in and as an individual as a human being i'll be happy but if it ain't god's will i don't want him in if it's god's will to bring a man in to put us in the desperation if that's what the bride needs then glory be to god let your will be done because i'm tired of fighting this battle i'm tired of running against the devil i'm ready to be that victorious one so they called me just a little background 1996 my granny passed away in in my life there's never been a more inspired woman in my life than my granny in 1996 i was not living for god i didn't want to live for god i was doing so many things against god that i don't even want to think about it but i remember coming to nashville to the hospital and seeing her on what day of the week it was exactly but we went home and that night is probably in my memory the first night i truly prayed before god that i truly cried out to god and that night's prayer changed the way i pray the rest of my life because i know that even though i was a sinner even though that i wasn't living right i knew that god was real i stood in a message church and i would watch my pastor brother curl stand and watch sicknesses fall off people watch miracles happen before my eyes i was i was not innocent to the fact that i saw god moving in my life god moving in the church i knew god could heal her but i also knew god had a perfect will and i will never forget i prayed that night i said dear god i says you can heal her but if it's not your will i don't want to see her like that again if it's not your will to heal her just take her own there's never been a woman i love my wife i'm not saying that i about said something not every gritty lady she was so influential in me even after her death i'd turn a bottle of alcohol up and i could hear her voice saying jonathan you know that's all right she meant so much to me but i come to a place that i had to realize it's god's will i didn't understand it then years later god give me understanding to it and now someone which is what i was getting at somebody called and said would you pray the brother so and so sister so and so that god would heal them of cancer i said this is the way i'll pray if it's their god's will for them to live god will take that sickness off of them but if it's not his will don't let me interfere with his will you realize so many times we interfere with the will of god you realize so many times maybe they need that score in their life maybe they need that situation in life maybe they need that sickness in their life to draw them to a rapturing faith to draw them to a place that they can become victorious i pray every prayer that i prayer that i pray i say dear god don't let my prayer change your perfect will if this is you moving in this situation i pray that you continue your way but god if it's the enemy trying to destroy my brother and sister i'm going to cast it out of them because they have no right to be with my family but you know what we need to look and decide is this battle worth we need to weigh the options and realize that we're living in a time now that we're living in a time that's going to be the hardest far look it ain't going to get better tomorrow if trump gets elected next year it ain't gonna get better they're gonna come after him harder than they've ever come after him they're gonna come after you and i harder than they've ever come after us they're gonna try to shut the doors of the church until they succeed in whatever fashion it is they're going to do it why we have a prophecy we know what's going to happen in the end time but let's julian don't let that get us discouraged don't let the scars of what they're doing to us but the persecutions and the love don't let that take the limelight but instead stand back as paul did and say i take pleasure in the fact that you're going to close my church doors because what are you doing you're fulfilling prophecy you're drawing me closer to going home with my husband we need to encourage ourselves we need to stand up it's been united more than we've ever stood before united with the word of god and say here we are you enemy i'm not taking it no more i'm standing on the word of god i am showing you i will be victorious though you may score my life though you may throw darts of of sicknesses though you may throw darts of all of these thoughts i ain't going to stand for what i believe in i am going to stand this ball here and say though i'm dying in a prison cell though you can do this though you can do that though you can do all of these things i am going to stick with what god has shown me to do you realize i use it in this early school class sometimes but you realize that every testimony we have down through time we can take anyone we ain't got enough time to go all night but we could take david we could take daniel we could take the hebrew children we could take samson we could take any one of them and you realize there had to be something to come into their life to bring them to a point of desperation to bring them to a point of do i believe it or not and there was pain that come with that and there were sacrifices that come with that do you realize if daniel would have never stayed in his closet and prayed before god they would have never thrown him in the lion's den and most places church girls can hey man he should have done that no he shouldn't have done that he should have stayed with the word of god and let man take him away from what he believed in why because god knew the whole time daniel will stand for my word and i'll stand for daniel when they throw him in the lion's den i'll shut the mouths of the lions think about abraham i try to find flesh clothes i ain't touching notes i think about abraham and sarah you realize the very god that we serve many of us by faith and i don't want to say nobody has seen him but we've not seen the flesh man in our life and we see that he comes and he visits abraham and sarah and when he comes and visits them he gives them a promise of a son and he says you're going to have a son of many nations and then he goes on your seeds like the stars and he gives him this promise and if we go and we read the scripture in genesis and exodus and we begin to dissect the life of abraham abraham failed god many times he said well abraham prayed the prayer of faith abraham was granted righteousness by his faith that's what romans says but if we look at the life he didn't have a perfect life he allowed his wife to convince him to take on a handmaid to have a son that way he allowed thoughts to enter his mind he allowed oh an old man like me have a child he led these things as a human all of these things scarred his vision and scarred his life yet in romans when we go to romans 4 believe it is and we could find as they would begin to describe how god looked at abraham and see tonight so many of us we've got all these scars that we can look at in our life we've got all of these situations that we can find in our life we got all this that we want to look at but if we could ever look the way god looks at his bride trust me okay this is probably going to get me in trouble that's my bride i would love to tell you she's perfect but she's not she differences in my opinion sometimes and it roused this flesh up because she should agree with everything that i say no she's a human raised by a different set of parents with a different set of opinions i didn't say she butted against headship she's a wonderful wife and she knows who her head is and i know who my head is see so many people forget the end of headship well my wife's going to do what i say do and that's just how you're going to do what god says do because headship goes a little higher but she even reminds me sometimes herself i said baby dog you're perfect she goes no if i was perfect i wouldn't be here yeah you're right you're right if we ever reach perfection we can't stay here any longer but what i'm getting at is if we quit looking at our own mistakes and our own failures and think oh i'm just a nobody no in god's eyes you're his bride and let me tell you all that i just said about her in my eyes there's no better wife than that not there i don't care what you're saying you'll never convince me there's a better wife than that one and your brother is going to feel the same way about your wives you treat her right she'll treat you right but god looks at his bride and he don't see her scars he don't see her mistakes when you fell down at an altar and you ask god to forgive you he put it out of his mind and though abraham abram had many mistakes romans 4 we find the scripture even brother branham and god's power to transform in 65 brother branham the prophet in our day would make this comet he said abraham didn't take the scientific research of his day and say i'm too old to have a baby i went too far i wonder why he threw that in there how many times you hear children of god say that well i've gone too far you ain't going too far he said i've done this and that in the other wall it sounds just like all of us don't it but he called anything that was contrary to god's word as though it wasn't and he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but he was strong giving praise to god he knoweth that god was able to perform that which he had promised romans 4 is the scripture brother brenham took that from and based that upon as a prophet of god as a seer of the word he could see how god saw abraham who against chapter 4 verse 18 who against hope believed in hope and we need some believers of hope in this day look look i i believe in using the bible to look at us in the day that we're living in it's not good enough just to talk about abraham and talk about paul and talk about how they felt and how they live but it's good enough to look at that and realize that is speaking to you and i it's speaking in a day there was no hope but yet he could believe in hope why because there was a bride coming in 2020 when you would look at the forecast of the world it looks like no hope but yet she can believe in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall i see it be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead and he was about a hundred years old neither yet at the deadness of sarah's womb and he staggered not at the promise of god but but wait but wait we read in the scripture we could go back and we could go back to exodus here i think i've got to go down and we could find what he took on hagar in the flesh eye that looks like he failed there was a scar in his life but yet something moved inside of him and allowed him to know you know what that wasn't right that's not the promised son god said that abraham and sarah would have a son the promises unto me and sir and he would get back and he would repent before god and when he repented god forgot that he done it when you repent god forgot that you've done it the problem is is everybody sitting around you didn't forget neither the problem is you know my my gradient shirley jones she passed away i guess eight years ago something like that she's riding down the road one day and now you see them everywhere but they was just coming out the little the little um gas company putting a little sign out so before you dig call call uh before you did call this number to make sure they're in a gas line right and she's seen it inspiration struck and she printed this thing out and she placed it on the front of her house and she told testafol did it it said before you dig in my past you better call god you better make sure he hadn't already removed that you better make sure that he hadn't already took that away from me you better make sure that i haven't already fell on my knees and asked god and forgiveness to move that from my life you know as christians we all take that to heart sometimes we ought to look at each other and go i don't know their prayer life i don't know where they're at i know they've made mistakes but oh god i've made mistakes i've asked you to forgive me if you can forgive me you can forgive them let's get together and push towards a victory and being not weak in faith considered his own body was now dead he was about 100 years old neither with the deadness of sarah's room but he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith that don't look like strong in faith to me nothing i mean my goodness he let his wife convince him to take on another woman he'll look very strong to me but yet though he made a mistake that we failed faith throws up inside of him but that's not the promise he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that he had a promise that he was able to perform it and therefore it was imputed to him righteousness now it was written for his sake alone it was imputed to him for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered from our offenses who was raised again for our justification what didn't tell us if we never made a mistake and we was perfect human beings look even the angels wasn't perfect a third of them fell from heaven we need to get we need to get how we define perfection out of our heads we need to get this this this lost cause of achieving perfection out of our heads you never as long as you're living in these flesh bodies you're never not gonna have a bad thought you're never not going to say something that you wish you shouldn't have said now look as you go closer to god things fall off look look it was a devil in a nicotine that fought me for years but yet when i began to grow closer to god i don't fight that devil no more but there's another devil that i fight along the way of this battlefield along the way of this army that i'm riding in that i'm walking in there's another battle ahead of me there's another stepping stone ahead of me it's not going to get any better until i go into a rapture but i've learned that when god looks down and he sees me he don't see the time that i got upset at my wife why because when i did i made it right with her and i made it right with him he don't see the times that i stubbed my toe and said a word that i shouldn't say thank god i ain't done that in a while i've finally won that battle it is being honest tonight so many times preachers don't want to be honest we're human too i got scars on my fingers that hurt when they happen i gotta cut right there that i cut a nerve and i touch the end of that finger and i grinch with pain when i step the razor blade up into that and it stuck in the bone and i had to pull it out of bone it hurts if i thought it would help to curse something i would have cursed but thank god he's there with me every day of my life thank god that in my trials he's there with me when i need him the most thank god that when i do fall before him i have a promise that i can fall on my knees and i can say dear god forgive me he says well done my son you never done it in the first place i've put it out of my memory i look at you and one day as abraham was imputed righteousness he's going to look down at a bride and he's going to say and she staggered not at the promise of god well brother what do you promise you're talking about a rapture that's going to take a bride out of here i didn't say i could explain it i didn't tell you that i know the time because i don't but i know i have a promise that in the days that i live in this world is coming to an end brother brandon said people would go totally insane would you agree they've gone totally insane let's define the police well what sense does that make the only thing keeping us from different from a third world country is the police on the streets keeping law and we want to defend we want to fund them yet that makes a lot of sense we're going to march with our cause and we're going to tell us to defund the police and then they called the police and asked them to protect them we've lost our minds we're living in a time of insanity but that don't get me down that gets me excited because brother benham said there'll come a day before they'll lose their mind they'll go totally insane and i go oh dear god we're living in that time there ain't much after this we're about to die somebody told me that they said well i can't say that it's no closer to the end time today than it was a hundred years ago oh thank god for i said because if you can't see it you're blind to what god is doing for his bride you're blind to know what he's doing for her right this instant i have a promise i got a message god laid on my heart and i'm trying to study through it with god i'm going to title it and i'll preach it here sometime but i have a promise there is a land there is a land there is a land that's as we done got carried away and went too far in time that when we see jesus come back he's not going to have nails guard hands he did that in the flesh body for you and i we're not going to see that we're going to see a perfected man of god when i look at you when you look at me you're not going to see my mistakes the things that that i use to illustrate of my failures that that you could see that oh brother jonathan's done this and brother jonathan you're not going to see that anymore i have a promise and one day through all of these scars i'm going to stand on that battlefield and that road is going to be called up yonder and i'm going to step out of line and say did y'all hear that he just said my name even so lord come quickly david if you come if you would stand with us appreciate brother tom asking me to come remember when i first started ministering man if i went somewhere to minister and the pastor wasn't there i was so nervous it wasn't funny it ain't got much better i like having the pastor in my corner the pastor is the shepherd of the chief i want y'all to know i would never try to say anything contrary to what your pastor said because god gave him to you to perfect you he gave him to this congregation to perfect you and if you turn that down you're turning down the word of god where does that put us god tonight help each and every one of us to look at our failures to look at our scars different than we've ever looked at them yeah i failed the devil let me tell you the rest of the story when you knocked me down it got me to a place of humility and i fell on my knees and i cried out to my true father and you know what devil he don't treat me the way you do when i make a mistake he don't cast me out he opens his arms he said i forgive you and so devil let me tell you that scar you gave me every time i look at it i go yeah that is where i defeated the devil that's the way i look look at it tonight heavenly father lord lord we love you with every thing in our beings lord lord i feel like i just run to and fro and didn't even stay where you wanted but god you know the people's hearts you know their lies you see the day that we're living god i want an on time god i want a god with skin on it i don't want just a god of history that taught me about daniel and david and simpson and paul and silas but i want a god that's living with me now without that god we ain't got a chance to make it through this but god i know you're real i stood in the battlefield and i've watched your enemy attack myself i've watched you're an enemy attack those around us and i saw you raise the standard up against that enemy time and time again god you see the condition of this world you knew it would be like this you told us it would be like this but god i'm praying for your bride tonight lord those that are gathered here and online that lord we can look at it in a different light tonight don't focus upon our past mistakes in my past dumplings the focus the promise that you've given us lord i love you lord your people loves you bless us lord be with us touch brother tom i pray you is with him in his service i know you was tonight be with him as he travels home bless this congregation in your name we pray amen amen [Music] thought well it worked out really good sing it tonight as we go and amen so on page 360 and my memory serves me right greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world amen oh greater is he that is in me oh greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world oh satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro oh seeking whom he may devour the bible tells the soul and many souls have been his full to fall in some weaker but god has promised us today is overcome
