thee Oh Lord for thou Hast Lifted Me Up and Hast not made my foes to Rejoice over me oh oh Lord thou Hast brought up my soul from the grave and thou Hast kept me alive that I that I should not go down to the pit for his anger endureth but a moment in his favor is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning Lord by thy favor thou Hast made my Mountain to stand strong thou D hide thy face and I was troubled what propit is is there in my blood when I go down to the pit shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth thou Hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou has put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not to the be silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks on thee forever amen God bless you you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters I was uh thinking about that one scripture we read in that Psalm I'll just reread it it again and it says in in my Prosperity I said I shall never be moved and I was just sitting there um I can't be nothing like I say I say it a lot being honest with you you know you can study all night and you can study in the morning and you can still be blank but I was just thinking in my in my own life uh the old army Navigator in me you know you can be in the middle of a desert you have no reference point have nothing that can guide you to walk and find your place but there's two things that God gives you to know where you're at that you're always going to have a sun that moves and stars at night so God always gives you reference points always gives you the ability to find where you're going and the destination that you need to follow and I was just thinking as I was uh at as you can tell I'm not going to say I know I say that a lot but on that uh from Corinthians the fif 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter of the First Corinthians those scriptures that are up there really struck me this morning and it goes I'm totally off what my point this morning but for us as Christians in this day and AG that this morning if the the reality of the Resurrection really doesn't have a hold on us this morning what are we where are we at what Have We Become and I was thinking uh I'll just read this this is and I was all those scriptures speak you you can go to church all your life you can say you're a Christian all your life you can fool your neighbors you can fool your brothers and sisters but does the reality of the Resurrection really possess your heart and soul this morning is your sole desire and your life to be part of the Lord and his kingdom this morning and I and and like the brothers have been talking about the last couple of weeks it's not the church it's you the individual in the church that matters and that relationship that you have this morning with Jesus Christ and I was um this is this is the quote from yesterday that was in the voice of God recording and uh it goes back to what brother Thomas was talking about on on Sunday last week and um I was just thinking about it this morning I I'll try not to go all over the place this morning like but I'll just read what brother brandom had to say in this quote kind of St uh sticks to what I'm thinking about this morning and brother Thomas was talking about this Sunday and we all know and this is what brother brandom had to say an eagle won't build his nest on the ground of course it won't Eagles build their nest way as high as he can get it in the highest peak well any bird of Praise is going to do this because it's vulnerable and it goes on to say the Reason God liken his church you are a candle that set on a hill so I'm I'm going to go to that scripture later but you're that candle that God sets on the hill for people to see the life of Jesus Christ in you you're that candle you're that representation this morning of the Church of Jesus Christ it's an awesome responsibility that we have and he goes on to say that's right High ambition High anticipations we're expecting great things and I hope everyone here is expecting you know as the world gets older we all know that we are needy people and the world is really needful this morning we're not to say well I'm Pentecostal that settles it well you could change that word right there not being sacrilegious and you could say I know all the message that that doesn't settle it either I I don't know for me I'm expect great things and he goes on to say I'm Baptist I'm Methodist I'm Oneness Tess threeness you know you you could put all the doctrines of the that people go D stray with in the message in that sentence too whatever you are that doesn't satisfy me I've got an ambition to move on till I meet him up and up and I that goes back to what what that chapter in Corinthians really stuck to me you know if we don't have the power of the Resurrection in us this morning really miserable people you're going to be miserable all your life until that power takes a hold of your spirit your soul this morning I got that ambition to move on until I meet up and up I receive the Holy Ghost and that settles it I didn't it didn't with me I'm just still talking I'm moving higher and higher that's right just moving on higher higher Ambitions higher expectations Ambitions now the brother brandom's talking the all these expect ations and all these Ambitions are in the word of God nothing of these things are outside of the word of God or the message there's nothing new about it it's the word of God and the power of Jesus Christ and he goes on to say here not well we've got plenty of nice little churches and and he goes on we just settle down me and this crowd that goes what I've been hearing the other ministers talk about you know the this church or any church can settle down and find itself off the Mark just as easy and he goes to say here we got a pretty nice little church we just settled down me and this little cow crowd we don't want none of the rest of you in our group you can have that anywhere in the world not me I just want to reach out a hand to every Fallen Creed brother ever what it is bring them in Ambitions do something expectations for a man that has ever walked in the truth is to see the truth you'll never get him in there the way by Drowning him you've got to put your armor that's really true you can you can drown people in the word of God and the message of the hour but you God has to be on the other side of it if God ain't on the other side of it they're really not going to move not to say that you don't tell people the truth you've you've got to put your arm around him love him let them know who you you're a brother and then something will happen you know I as in my my younger life that's you know occasionally when I was younger before God saved me you know the kind Christian is the one you remember the Christian that shows you love and understanding without brow beating is you is the one that you really remember and he goes on to say you've got to put your arm around him love him let him know what you you're a brother then something will happen if you're kin to Jehovah you'll do that if you got his Spirit he comes to the one that hated him despised him and spits in and spit in his face basically no matter what what they did to him he still loved them and was willing to give them salvation and he prayed and he saved them certainly and that's the spirit of God in man and let me and I was just thinking about you know when I read that up there on the thing I when I read the one from 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter I'm not going to turn to it and read it I won't won do that this morning but I immediately go to 2 Corinthians and the 5th chapter and if there's any Bible that you want to read chapter in the Bible just like Romans the eth chapter that's a Bible in the chapter that you really want to know I'm not going to read it this morning but I'll just read to in uh Matthew the 5th chapter and then I'll sit down I was I was listening to brother random last night and this morning and it goes to what this uh quote was about it's the fifth chapter and it's I'll start at I won't read this is a long chapter I promise I won't read it all starting at about the 10th verse of the fifth chapter blessed blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and blessed are you when men shall revive you persecute you and shall say manner of evil against you falsely for my sake you know you have to accept the fact when you give people the truth not everyone is going to receive it openly and you just have to love people whether they receive it or not and he goes on to say rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you and I was just thinking about these scriptures right here from like the 13th to the 19th this morning and this is it goes to what brother branam was talking about in this quote and we all know this scripture here the 13th verse here you are the s of the earth and if ye the salt have lost his favor where shall it be salted and henceforth good for nothing but cast out and be trodden under their foot of men so you're that salt goes to what I was saying earlier you're the salt that changes people's life it's the relationship you have with Jesus Christ this morning that shows something to people that saltiness that there's something better than what they're living in their lives and he goes on to say you are the light of the world a city that is set on on a hill cannot be hid and it goes back to what this quote these scriptures here can be hid neither do men put a light a do men light a candle on put it under a bushel of course we know that would be stupid you'd burn the whole house down but put but put the Candlestick in it give it light onto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven think not that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets I have not come to destroy but to fill and then this last verse I'll finish with this L we all know this verse for verily I say unto you until Heaven and Earth pass away one JW or one ttle shall not wise pass from the law till it be fulfilled and I was thinking this morning if you I don't I don't want to read a lot I was going to let me just read this a couple of these verses if I didn't lose my place here this morning so I can only speak wherever you're at in your relationship this morning whether you're on in a valley or you're on a Mountaintop it can your circumstances can change as long as you put your heart and trust in the Lord this morning and um I want us we all know this I'll start at uh about the seventh verse here and just read a few of these and sit down I know I just said that I promise I won't say it again the seventh ver remember them which rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose whose Faith follow and consider the end of their conversation and then we all everyone knows the scripture Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and be not carried away with diverse and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established and it goes back to what I was saying out of Corinthians and at what this quote says here be not carried away with diverse of Str doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace and not with meat which have not profited them which have then have not been occupied therein forgive my reading here and we are in an altar whereof that have we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat where of serve the Tabernacle for whose um I'm out of place there I'm just going to finish with this simple thought this morning that's not actually what I wanted to read but I from from my heart the only thing I can say is as as the word of God present presents itself to us in this age that we live in I find that we I don't know how to say this I I only can speak for myself I need that new refreshing every day in my heart and life this morning you you need to know that you know that Jesus Christ is alive this morning there there's no hope for us outside of that this morning and if I could say anything that matters anything it it's the truth and God will fulfill his word in our hearts and lives this morning brother David or brother Josh sorry is it good to be here this morning amen who's ready to worship the Lorden you come expecting amen let's stand this morning let's saying I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart I'll enter his courts with praise I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart I will

church y'all know how to poke the line in the cage I'm telling you I I got to dance in back there I thought Lord help me help me uh submit to this atmosphere God is certainly good and mindful so if you want to get into your Bibles we'll turn into the Book of Leviticus and it's just uh I've never I just never ceased to be amazed by the way God works and his the way he moves I I was going to call brother Josh this week and ask him would you try to get that song Together the champion of God or champion of love I think is how it's and I thought no I'm just I'm not going I'm not going to call him I I'm not going to throw a new song on him for the congregation but we're going to speak this morning on God's Hall of Fame we're going to take it through the Old Testament the New Testament in present day and show you that God has a Hall of Fame and it was the same yesterday today and forever it doesn't it doesn't we we don't look at our shortcomings we look at the we look at the final outcome are you with me let's turn to Leviticus chapter 8 we're going to read here for just a little bit I got to settle myself down I'm shaking like a leaf up here Leviticus chapter 8 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take Aaron and his sons with him and the garments now I want you to notice the garments so here he is he's dressing Aaron you know the bride is dressed in the word of God and take and the garments and the anointing oil so now we see Spirit coming into play and the bullet for the sin offering and two Rams and a basket of 11 bread and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and Moses did as the Lord commanded him and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and Moses said unto the congregation this is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done and Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water where we heard that Ephesians 5 and 26 says that he might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of the Water by the word the same yesterday today and forever we're a word bride and he put upon him the coat and girded him with a girdle and clothed him with a robe and put the epod upon him and GED him with a curious girdle of the epod and bound it unto him therewith and he put the breast plate upon him and he also put the breastplate the urum and thumb and he put the miter on his head and on the miter up even on the for Forefront did he put the golden plate the holy crown as the Lord commanded Moses so now we're transferring a royal priesthood we've been had a royal priesthood transferred to us and Moses took the anointing oil now watch this this is important mooses Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was where the therein and Sanctified them and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and Anointed The Altar all of the vessels both the Laver and his foot and sanctify them so he now is taking this anointing oil and I want you to notice he's just sprinkling it in the church he's anointing the things of the church by sprinkling there's a there's an certain anointing in the church there's a sprinkling in the church systems but what does he do with Aaron and he poured the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him so brothers and sisters that's what we need today in the hour we're living in we don't need just a sprinkling of the Holy Ghost the church world can do the church World things we need an anointing poured out upon us a holy ghost anointing that we are above and we beyond and we become the Champions the Hall of Fame champions of god let's just pray Heavenly Father we come before you today Lord with grateful Hearts thankful for this opportunity to be in your house and thankful so thankful and grateful Lord that we feel such a powerful presence amongst us this morning and the hearts of the people are hungering and pulling already and the songs of worship and praise and the songs of Victory and and the the the the the cries and the anthems of champion ships this morning Lord we find ourselves in that picture Lord so help us Lord to step ourselves out of the way that we could be submissive to you father that everything we say and do would be uh pleasing to you and it would be exactly where you want us to take this message this morning and we thank you Lord for all that you do in our lives we pray for healing for those that are sick and and for those that can't be here we just ask your blessings upon them and bless bless now the remainder of the service in Jesus name amen you can have your seats so we look here in Leviticus chapter 8 and I want you to to kind of look at this for a few minutes this this anointing o in the Bible what does it symbolize so it tells us in in Leviticus chapter 8 here that he poured this anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him so we know in The Book of Leviticus this is the third book of the Hebrew Bible that was written and it deals with rituals and laws and Logistics that are taken taking place in the in the church World on that day so this verse comes in a message in a passage where God has dealt with Moses and Moses or God comes down and he commands Moses Moses I want you to set the church in order you've come out of an exodus you've left Egypt now I want you to set the church in order and I want you to do it this way and I want you to take Aaron and his sons and I want you to consecrate them as priests priests in the church that will follow the order that I set before them and so this anointing o mentioned in this verse it was made from a special recipe you can find it and it talks about it in the book of Exodus and and so they take this special oil and it's used to consecrate the priest and watch this it's used to set them apart for the service of God it sets them apart from everybody else and that's what I want to be in this hour brothers and sisters I want to be set apart from the church world I want to be set apart from the people who are just doing churchy things I want to be a living acting Christian moving with God in my life and making a move for God on the scene are you with me and so here we see see here that even in the Old Testament we see the process taking place in this very Book of Leviticus back here we see a new testament uh a new testament order taking place in the Old Testament with justification sanctification and now with the anointing oil which is a symbol of a New Testament Holy Ghost what he's doing when he pours out the oil over Aaron what he's doing he says now I am telling you that God is in the people that God is in control of the church that God will set things in order the way it should be not man not my ideas not your ideas not my opinions they don't matter they're they're worth not a whole lot Aaron's opinion in himself was worth not a whole lot but when they poured the oil on him and he found himself covered and saturated in the oil of the anointing of the Holy Ghost that set Aaron apart so we look at this anointing oil in the Bible so literally it was a sense of anointing oil being poured to to Mark a person physically that that person had been chosen that that person had been selected I I I saw a portrait I I was looking this up and I began to look I thought I want to know how how serious this was and I saw a portrait the best one I found and Aaron was sitting in a in a chair and all of his sons were surrounding him and Aaron is is dressed in his Priestly robe and everything that have been done in in Leviticus that we read there in Leviticus 8 and Moses is standing behind him and he he he he's taking he don't take a little jar he's not taking one of these now he he's not just dabbing a little bit on like cologne or something but here sits Aaron in this chair and he's got a vessel a clay vessel a vase and it shows him and he's just over the top of his head pouring the oil over Aaron this was a sloppy mess but one thing Aaron could prove he could prove before everybody that he went in the presence of that I have been in the presence of God because I'm anointed from head to toe with the anointing of God Almighty that's where we need to be in this hour anointed from head to toe with the anointing of the Holy Ghost and you'll look different you'll walk different you'll talk different before the people you come in contact with it set him apart from who the Ordinary People was so this this oil let's look at what it does for us what it did for him back in those days it let him stand before the people as an anointed servant of God and a mediator between the children of Israel and God you know there's people that take that and run with that did you hear me there's people that think we can let our family members in that we're mediators that anointing oil does not give us the mediation rights we've been there has been given one mediator in this day and his name was Jesus Christ he went to a cross called Calvary and the blood was shed and he stands as the mediator between us and God and that's the only that's the only bloodline it is but what that Holy Ghost what that anointing does for us in this case it gives us Divine empowerment and it gives us Authority that Holy Ghost when it comes upon us it equips us just like it equipped him as the oil was poured out on him it put him in a place in a presence that he can now say I am God's man on the scene how many of you are amateur Gods well some of you are I said how many of you are amateur God the prophet said when the Holy Ghost comes upon you become just like God you become an amateur God he said that's what Adam was in the very beginning he had the power to create the power to move the power to make the atmosphere anything he wanted are we being a restoration Bride come on church so here was Aaron just an ordinary everyday man just like everybody else he walked he walked everywhere he went he had proba maybe a little cottage a little house that he lived in maybe he had a little little side job he pedal we don't know anything much about him other than than he was called to God to be the priest but just an ordinary man but when that oil was poured over him it done something for him let me tell you this morning if you ever get that oil poured on to you young people if you haven't had the Holy Ghost if you're a new Christian you don't know what it means to have the anointing allil the Holy Ghost poured upon you it will make do something for you it'll make you different than what you are the before you got the oil it's a presence on the inside that changes it's a nature change that happens on the inside there's something that changes it reminds me of that song the two coats there was two coats before me an old and a new I could have had either but what should I do the old coat was torn the old coat was torn but the other one was new and had never been worn I tell you the best thing I ever did was put on that new coat the best thing you'll ever do is put on that new coat and let the Holy Ghost dwell on the inside and let it lead and guide and direct you every step that you take of your life you say well that makes you perfect no it makes me human and it makes me fallible but it makes me get [Applause] up so Aaron just an ordinary guy just an ordinary guy under the anointing of the Holy Ghost he began to look different you won't look the same when you get the Holy Ghost you say well I've been in church my whole life nothing really changed you ain't never got the Holy Ghost you're still in Egypt I said you're still in Egypt you still eating onions and eating Garlic you're still in Egypt you're working for a slave called the devil because you never got the Holy Ghost if nothing ever changed when you come to Christ you never got an experience because the Holy Ghost makes you look different act different walk different talk different you quit listening to the lies of the devil how do you do that the Holy Ghost gives you the confidence knowing that with Christ all things are possible this oil make it's marking Aaron as dedicated to God's service it's separating him from an ordinary life you know we all got neighbors have everybody here got a neighbor are you different than your neighbor some of you says I sure hope so I know some of you neighbors I hope so too but Aaron was no longer ordinary anymore something had happened something be to take place and this oil absolutely set him apart the oil sets the bride apart from the church remember what I said as Mo as Aaron began to sprinkle or Moses be to sprinkle the oil in the church nothing wrong with church systems there's a place for them but there's a place for a bride that is a walking talking action driven bride of Jesus Christ so this we look at this oil now and I want you to look at this because God is looking for individuals in this day God is looking for individuals in this day to to set apart from the world individuals that will live a life that that is pleasing to God he's looking for individuals that will prove that God is alive and I think about church a lot and I think about the people in the church and a church is only as alive as the people that are living in the church when we become ritualistic are we really alive for God when we if if if God has placed something on your heart and you're not obedient to it are you really living for God no but when God places something on the inside under the anointing under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost you'll examine that make sure that it's from God and you will move and act upon what God is asking you to do how else is God going to move in the church how else is God going to speak to us as individuals if he doesn't lay something on the pastor's heart something on the preacher's heart how is God going to come down and meet your needs how is God going to have somebody to lay hands upon you if nobody ever accepts the call of God in their life but it's under the anointing of the Holy Ghost that we're able to do these things because under the anointing of the Holy Ghost doubt has to flee listen to what this does under the anointing of the Holy Ghost under the anointing of the Holy Ghost doubt has to flee fear has to flee your anxieties have to flee listen to me doubt fear and anxiety can't stay in the same vessel at the Holy Ghost I need to slow down give y'all time to applaud because light and darkness will not coexist in the same environment I've been in a cave before I've been in a cave so deep but I thought I wasn't coming out I was scared my wife we won't get into that but in that cave we turned off all the lights and I'm going to tell you you couldn't see your hand this far in front of your face there was such a darkness in there it was an eerie dark it was just almost a hellish atmosphere I said man we got to turn some lights on and we had a little low flashlight and we lit that little and you could see a room a c a cavern bigger than this church building right here just wide open why was that because light pushed out the Darkness Darkness can't exist where light is if your life is dark this morning if your life is Dre this morning get the light of the Holy Ghost on the inside and darkness has to flee sickness has to flee under the anointing of the Holy Ghost under the anointing of the Holy Ghost you are able to overcome The Temptations that plague your mind how many of you are human you've got Temptations you've got thoughts you've got desires that you know are not pleasing to God and if you entertain those thoughts if you entertain those desires and those Temptations without the Holy Ghost I hate to tell you but you're going to get caught in Satan's snare you're going to find yourself in a snare thinking how did I get here I know better than this you may have known better but you submitted yourself to a spirit that wasn't the anointing of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will tell you to turn your back and go the other direction the Holy Ghost will tell you not to say those things not to watch those things not to listen to those things young people you need an experience with the Holy Ghost and I trust you've had it if not we're willing to pray until we get it because the Holy Ghost will keep you to falling into temptations that will scar you for the rest of your life you say well I'm this and I'm that it won't happen to me be careful because it can happen to you you know Satan is no respector of person he don't care if you're the preacher the Deacon the lay member the janitor he don't care his job is to do one thing to steal kill and destroy he don't care who it is that's why the importance of the Holy Ghost is so important in our lives that we're able to have an anointing upon us that recognizes when Satan moves in on the scene cuz if you don't recognize it you'll just keep falling for it you know that little Mouse when he's running through there and he he goes in there and he gets that he goes into that and that bucket that's got the cheese down in it or the Trap that's got the cheese in it he'll just keep doing that and he'll keep doing that until he recognizes one day he got me I don't want to be that guy I want to recognize before I get there say man this looks like a trap that Satan has set for me this looks like something I shouldn't get into and I better just back myself away from it so under the anointing of the Holy Ghost you're free from the bondage of sin you don't have to go back into Egypt you know I was in Egypt one time do any of you remember your life in Egypt that's the exact word I was looking for I was going to say was any of you miserable yeah why because there's nothing for the believer in Egypt you're under bondage you're under shackles of a of a Tormentor and a slave that all he wants to do is torment torment torment you that's right but under the anointing of the Holy Ghost you're set free from that bondage of sin it's like the prophet said he said that you are a conqueror and you have victory in the Holy Ghost and as a conqueror it means that you have beaten down you have overridden you have handcuffed handcuffed and thrown into prison you have thrown into prison that which used to overrule you you now rule it that's what a conqueror is he said you you've whipped it you've overcome it you are greater than it is ain't it just nice when you can walk and you can say that don't bother me and you know at one time you were so Shackled by that by that devil and you can look at this and and you say don't bother me devil go pick on somebody else I ain't biting I ain't buying what you selling devil remember these Israelites they had recently been freed from slavery in Egypt and God is now establishing a new community for him a new order and this priesthood is going through a crucial institution in in in into Israel here as a mediator God and his people they're offering sacrifices they're maintaining the Holiness but now let's jump over to the New Testament for just a few minutes St John chapter 1 I'm read it here verse 38 and Jesus turned and saw them them following and said unto them what seek ye and they said unto him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Master aren't you thankful that you can recognize who Jesus is Master his people know who he is where dwellest thou and he sath unto them come and see and they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode with him that day for it was about the 10th hour one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first findeth his own brother Simon and said unto him we have found the Messiah as being interpreted the Christ which we know as if if we were to add another line onto that put a comma there we would know through the message of the hour and we would know through uh historical Scholars that when it says the Christ it means the anointed one isn't it something how this anointing is flowing and following down through the Bible it started way back there in the first church that come out of Egypt it started way back there in the levitical priesthood where laws were that anointing was poured out and now that Jesus is on the scene he arrives as the anointed one so here we see the symbolism of this anointing oil carried forward into the New Testament and Jesus here so what does that tell telling us it's telling us that as Christians this concept of anointing with oil is empowerment this concept of anointing with oil is is gifting of the Holy Spirit it means that God is setting an order in his church his bride Church you see he had to set it into order in the levitical church and he had to set it in order in the last day Church ah for years years people thought the the gift of the Holy Ghost was no more than shouting dancing speaking in tongues interpretations and that all is a part of the Holy Ghost I love it I'm like I heard brother Tommy's prayer I'd like to see more of that but if it's not if it's not genuine if it's not anointed of the Holy Ghost we're going to stay away from it because we know now what we see in our hour and what the what the messenger brought in this hour is not just a not just an emotion not just a a feeling not just a song or an interpretation but it's a God moving in his people it's a god of action in The Bride of Jesus Christ a bride that takes the word and has dressed herself in the word and stands and acts on the word Jesus I want you to notice here Jesus the prophet said had a need to to go to Samaria he's headed down to Samaria I like the way the prophet tells this because he says as he heads down to Samaria he said he don't know exactly what's going to happen is that isn't that an amazing statement that he would say that Jesus Christ knows he's got to go to Samaria but he don't know exactly what's going to happen that's what he said but there's a woman there so he thought he'd carry on a conversation with her and so he said he went on and talking about her and talking about a drink and she went to talking about how they worship in the mountain or in this mountain and that mountain and so forth but directly watch the spirit the anointed one he said but directly he caught what her trouble was that's God In Action he caught what her trouble was and she he said sure she had five husband husbands he said go get your husband and come here so I want you to look now and think about this and let's paint this picture for a few minutes here is this woman who is an outcast of the city now remember now we're talking about Hall of Fame and we're talking about Champions and one of Jesus's first encounters is with a prostitute in a city that's drawing water by herself because she can't draw water with the rest of the women an outcast and Jesus under the anointing picks up her situation aren't you glad he picked up your situation he picks up her situation and says tell me about your husband and she says I have no husband and he says that's right you've said well because you've had and the one you're living with now is not your husband is that in that thou sayest the truth you talk about standing in an anointing when you stand in that kind of an anointing you can't lie you can try you can try to doubt you can try to make up excuses but when that kind of anointing when you're standing face to face with Jesus Christ and he's calling you out and he's pulling at your heart strings there is an anointing there that you can't hide from she stands in that anointing and the prophet says I got to nail this down I want you to look at the difference between that woman in the shape that she was in and those High cultured ministers we're talking about the difference between a champion and the church oo let that sink in we're talking about the difference between a champion and the church you see the church had their rituals the church had their rituals this woman said sir I perceive that you're a prophet so she came into the presence of an anointing like she had never experienced in her life she stands in that presence now knowing that the messiah's got to come knowing what the messiah's got to say knowing how they currently worship knowing the life that she's lived and is living she didn't come to him holy she didn't come to him all lifted up a Hall of Fame player you know sometimes we we think we got to get good we got to get right to come to church no come to church and you might get right but she came to church just like she was little did she know that she was going to stand in a presence like she had never felt and she stands there while the priest and the educated the cultured with their pride and their arrogancy and their righteous status they look at the same person the anointed one and says you are a devil be o are we Champions or are we a church I'm a champion she stands there and looks at and the woman says sir I perceive that you're a prophet because we know that when the Messiah come he's going to tell us these things he's going to share these things with us and and and and and this is the sign of the Messiah and the prophet said that same Messiah Messianic sign is the same yesterday today and forever it's got to be the same it don't change so when you come into the presence of God we ought to be able to recognize the spirit of God recognize the truth when the truth is spoken that's how you can believe that right there that's how you can believe that right there that's how you believe that right there and that's certainly how you believe that right there it's because something in you recognize an anointing that goes along with it that said hey something is calling me she said I know we know that when a messiah come he'll be called the Christ the anointed one he'll tell us these things but who are you and he said I am he that speaks with you and the prophet said that was it in an instant brother and sisters in an instant we look at things different she looked at things different when the light flashed upon her life she was no longer in the gutters living a life of sinful prostitution but immediately she ran she got up and she said you must be the prophet you must be the Messiah and she ran into the city to tell everybody come and see a man when that anointing got upon her she couldn't help but testify of what God would done in her life I really question the experience sometimes and I've had to question my own as a young Christian I thought I was a Christian I thought I was I thought I was doing what I was supposed to do but I was afraid I didn't have that attitude of run and tell everybody what he'd done for me I was like thank you God for what you've done for me but we just keep that private well I'm glad all y'all was run and shouted from the rooftops but when that light hits you can't help but do what the light wants you to do brothers and sisters when you come in contact with that anointing of the Holy Ghost your life will never be the same we've been talking about Joseph and the prophet said it was Christ and Joseph that made him portray Christ H he was sold for 30 pieces of silver loved by his father hated by his brethren in a prison house Christ was on the cross once one was saved the butcher one was sa lost the butler one saved one lost the same thing set at the right hand of pharaoh it was Christ and Joseph that made Joseph like Christ now how many of you you want to be like Christ now do you have Christ in your life you see how that works today we're talking about God's Hall of Fame these verses and these themes talked about sanctification empowerment Purity and all these implic implications that we talk about here it serves as a reminder of the Consecration and dedication we got to have I asked myself many times am I dedicated to Christ the way I should be am I fully consecrated I laid in the bed this morning from 1:30 to 5:30 couldn't sleep thinking about this couldn't study couldn't sleep just laid there and I thought I told the Lord I said I'm being honest with you now church I'm being honest I laid there for a while and I said Lord I don't think I've done everything I should do I don't think I have fully prepared the way I should have been prepared or preparing Lord forgive me because I need to give more of me to you for you to use more of me and I've been thinking about this message for over a week but I didn't feel like it was adequate I didn't feel like ID put in all that I should have this Holy Ghost begin to prick in my heart and as I've made that confession I can't explain it to you I hope you experience the same thing but there's times when I pray and I pray and there's times when I pray and I feel his presence and and you know that when you're speaking he hears every word and you feel such a warm tender presence and I laid there this morning as I made that confession and it was almost like something said get up it's okay sometimes we just need to be told it's okay and the presence was a was a was an anointing like I've never I won't say I've never but one like I've rarely feel at that height of a presence and I just lay there and I begin to just kind of tear and cry at I don't know what time it was 1 2 3:00 I don't know what time it was but I begin to just feel that presence and I said Lord thank you thank you that you don't just throw me out because I fail thank you that you don't just cast me aside because I fell short thank you that that that you you're still going to meet me when I walk out to the platform because it's not about me to begin with it's about the people my gift is for people and I began to pray and that warmth come over and I said Lord I'm going to live more consecrated more dedicated I'm going to serve you Lord more than I've ever served you I don't want to waver I don't want to be slothful I don't I don't want to I don't want to be the person that that just comes in and gets into the routine of coming and going and and just in a routine of doing what we do because that's what we do I want to be under the control you know you hear the prophet talk about the he's talking about somebody praying for somebody and he said I'm praying for this person and this person's uh joining me and we're praying and he said we're just conducts we're conduits we're just running through the conduit that's what I want to be just a holy ghost conduit that whatever God wants in my life that that's what I can pour back out into the people because brothers and sisters without Christ in our lives we fail we fail the prophet said numerous times over and over put it in type it into your computer fail and failure and see how many times he said without you I'm a failure this prayer line if you don't come it's a failure that's right without you in my life God I fail and he says it over and over and over and it made me realize that no matter how hard I fall God just wants me to get back up God just wants you to get back up you're going to make mistakes [Applause] that's exactly right Joseph was a deliverer now I've read this quote for the last three services and every time I read it I find something else so we're going to read it again is that all right job's on that Ash Heap but Prophet said for I don't know how long we're going to get Joseph out of this prison Joseph was a deliverer he saved his people from famine what did God have to do to him he said he put him in prison he put him right straight in the prison yes sir sold by his Brethren to an Egyptian they sowed him to Piper Piper gave him a little bit of Liberty and the first thing you know it was taken from him and there he said in prison crying and crying because God had stripped it but now notice he says all the time I believe he's in that prison remembering that the vision said he was going to sit on a throne so something called me at about 16 years old and said you're different you're different than the rest that you're hanging out with you're different than those people that that you're running around with you're different there was a vision that took place something called out to you there was a vision that took place in Joseph's life there was a vision that took place in your life something called out to you and said you're different serpent seed marriage and divorce the seals Church ages is that different did it call out to you different now let me ask you when you believe those things when you believed in Christ when you believed in the message when you believed in these things did you ever have any mistakes from then on yeah you see the mistakes don't determine the vision the blood the blood is what determines the vision the blood on Calvary is what determines the the vision now listen what he says he said all the time he knew he was going to sit on the throne but he because he knew that his gift come from God and he knew that it had to come to pass and so if we could keep that in our minds and according to the word that in these last days that God is going to have a church he is going to have a bride he's going to have a people a word bride without spot or wrinkle how's she going to do that she's going to be clothed with the word anointed with the holy ghost moving in the presence of God how do you know these things I know him because he promised it why would I doubt why should we doubt why should we worry why should we fear he said he would do it we're living in that time we're here 2025 we're living in a Time think about this we're living in a time that is the most evil time that the world has ever seen but for the believer It's the Most Blessed time that the world has ever seen you're living in a time when you're seeing God move on the scene in ways that we've never seen before I am just astonished I'm excited to be living in this very hour we're living in when we can hear the Miracles that's taking place we can see God in ACS and you say I don't know what you're talking about Ron Spencer had a death sentence five years ago he's still alive not only is he alive he's still preaching as hard as he can go a death sentence 5 years ago we've seen people here that's been healed we've seen people that are being healed this ain't in my notes but it's just it's just inspiration you know they told sister Donna your limp nodes are full is that right she goes back gay take four out and they say we can't find nothing don't tell me my God is not a god of action they tell they tell our pastors said I don't know he showed them pictures and scans and pictures of of wounds and so forth and they look at him and said I don't know what you're doing but you better keep doing it and she said keep praying why because you're calling God on the scene it's it's not just the mighty Army it's the war it's the it's the general behind the Army he's going to have a people so quit listening if you're one of his people quit listening to the devil this morning because he's only telling you half the story you ever notice that's the way he works he talked to Eve told her a lot of the story but just not all of it just enough but not all of it but I want you to look at what Matthew 19:26 says Jesus says with man this is impossible now how many times has a devil quoted that to you what you're trying to do is impossible what you're trying to accomplish is impossible you think God can do that in your life it's impossible because you're a man he left out the other part he's a little bit stupider than he than we than give him credit for we say he knows the Bible yeah he does but he don't know how to use it we know how to use it we've been given a gift to use the word the word says with man it's impossible but With God all things are possible the prophet I'm going to finish this quote and we're not going back to it the prophet said that Joseph was sitting there thinking and be became a total failure I never picked that up till I studied this Joseph sitting there thinking he'd become a total failure to himself he knew that all that he understood and everything but he became a total failure to where when people would look at him they would turn their head they wouldn't pay him no attention because he became a prisoner isn't that the way it is when when you make a mistake you could be going along good in life and man church is going good and man you filled with the Holy Ghost and you you fall flat on your face next thing you know you Outcast oh look at him he never was a Christian to begin with that's right he done fail he he he didn't even fall because he never had it that's what they say come on church but listen what listen what the prophet said God said when Joseph was in the prison after he fell and he made himself a a place in the prison and he thought of himself as a total failure God said here's my man come on church when you're laying there and you think you've made become a total failure God looks at you and says there's my man there's my woman there's my young person there's my young lady that's the way God sees you the world sees you as a failure the devil accuses you of being a failure but God says that's my man that's my conqueror that's my Victor Hebrews 12 And1 I'm going to have to tell that time to stand still Hebrews 12 And1 says therefore we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders us and the sin that so easily entangles Oh you mean we're in a wrestling match oh Paul knew what he was talking about we're in a wrestling match and let us run with perseverance the race that's marked out before us so now we're racing we're trying to we're trying to beat somebody we're trying to get to the Finish think about this fixing our eyes on Jesus now there's the key fixing our eyes on Jesus the the perfector of Faith as we look at this and we think about the the author here comparing the Christian Life to a race a race of endurance Paul he knew what he was talking about you got to think about the time that he wrote this the time what was going on the Romans were known for their games right we got the Olympics today because they were fond of their games the competition to see who could win who was the elite who could win in wrestling who could win in in all these things and so we have the Olympics so if you was an Olympic runner you know what you did your entire life you ran if you were an Archer you spent the better part of your life trying to get better with a bow and arrow if you're a wrestler you would eat right you would dieet right you would get stronger You' practice and you want to be the best wrestler that you could be so now watch this a watch these athletes these Champions they get rid of everything and anything that prevents them from reaching their goals now how many of us could say we got some things we need to get rid of to reach our goals come on hands defy gravity show God that you mean business they get rid of things in their life that they don't need things that's going to slow them down in the race they get rid of things that's going to hold them back from shooting straight they get rid of things that's going to keep them from winning the grappling in the wrestling match they get rid of these things they ain't eating biscuits they're training they got a goal they got a purpose and they're training this is the kind of focus that this Hebrew author they were talking about it was determination that no matter what comes my way I'm determined now we have what's called a Hall of Fame and about just about every sport men and women and they stand a little taller they shine a little brighter they move a little faster a little quicker on their feet basketball Michael Jordan don't argue with me I'm not going to argue with you it's Michael Jordan football Johnny Unitas running Carl Lewis Usain Bolt Jackie joner ciry you can name them the Hall of Famers Babe Ruth baseball Carl Yus krimsky baseball you I could go through hundreds of them and I could begin to list these Hall of Fame athletes but what is it that makes them different they grind they don't settle for just getting by they're committed to what they do you say man I wish I could be like Kobe Bryant no you don't because you're not willing to do what Kobe Bryant did to get there do you know Kobe Bryant was up at 4:30 every day of his life since high school in a gym shooting free throws and shooting jump shots before the rest of the world was awake oo Muhammad Ali said he' get up and run every morning at 5:00 and have a morning jog because he thought that he could get a little bit of edge over the competition that was still sleeping that's right these guys were Grinders are we grinding to get to where we want to be uh that's why I said we don't want to be slothful but we want to be diligent when we take the word and we reading the word we want to dig into the word and really get into the word I said I read that quote three times and I found three different things out of just one paragraph to preach on how much more is in that one paragraph but it takes grinding it takes getting in there I want you to look let's look at Michael Jordan for just a minute we'll get off the Bible for a minute I I like Michael Jordan Michael Jordan said I have missed more than 9,000 shots in my care career he said I have lost almost 300 games 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed now does that sound like a champion he said I have failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed you mean as a Christian you're going to fail over and over and over God may ask you to do something 9,000 times he may give you 9,000 shots to do something right and you miss the Mark Jordan said I can accept failure everyone fails at something but I can't accept not trying if you going to get anywhere with God you got to try it you know people they want to talk about success and it don't matter what it is any any part of life success whether it's business a home or whatever it don't just fall into your lap it's a lot of trial and error it's a lot of of getting back up when you get knocked down it's a it's a lot of of finding out that that that you can't be afraid to fail that's what Jordan says don't be afraid to fail be afraid not to try as Christians we have to be willing to do what God wants us to do he says it doesn't matter if you fall down it's whether you get back up Michael Jordan is a pretty good preacher that's right his life don't line up but he got some good quotes the key to success is failure oh if you never sharpen the pencil you'll never make a mistake that's right if you ain't making mistakes you ain't working listen to what he says here I know that fear is an obstacle for some people but it's an illusion to me huh failure always made me try harder next time Babe Ruth was known for home runs right 714 career home runs 1,330 strikeouts you know what his quote his most famous quote is never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game I might fail God today tomorrow next week but I'm still playing this game and it's the game of life and I got to have that holy ghost in my life it's that Holy Ghost that keeps me playing in the game we look at King David we think about David no question one of the Bible's most important figures faces a giant called Goliath he has a great friendship with Jonathan he worships and writes Psalm after song after song and he he endures the wickedness of King Saul one of our most beloved characters in The Bible and who would ever thought he'd been guilty of breaking half of God's Commandments this is a Hall of Fame champion of God coveted your rise wife committed adultery with her stole her from her husband lied to him and murdered him that's that's five right what about Elijah think about Elijah he had experiences of Miracles over and over over and over you'd think he'd have unshakable faith wouldn't you you would think after all he'd SE after all he'd see he caused the rain to stop for more than three years think about this he's fed by Ravens he sees a limitless jar of flour and a jug of oil just keep building up building up you can't you can't use it up and he's witnessing this and he and he sees the the Widow's son Resurrected he beats the prophets of baale by calling down fire from heaven but when The Showdown comes between baal's worshippers and an angered King Ahab and Jezebel Elijah couldn't take it he High tailed Into the Wilderness does that sound like a champion that sound like something I might do you see God God uses us over and over and then we make mistakes and we fall and then God picks us up and he uses us and he uses and we make mistakes and we fall John Mark you read about it in the Bible Paul and Barnabas they picked John Mark up to go on a mission trip to Jerusalem now how honored would you be as a young young man you're fixing ago on a missionary trip with with Paul and Barnabas you fixing to go you fixing to go see some stuff and the Bible tells us that they get going there and they get down going down through there and they're doing all these things and you can just read through the Bible there and read through in the acts it's about acts 13 and John Mark decides I've had enough of this and he just deserts them he leaves them don't nobody really know why he just enough's enough I'm out of here and years later after being abandoned Paul is sitting in a prison awaiting trial he writes a letter to the Church of the Colossians and he he tells them about John markk he said he's with me and he's been a great comfort to me but before that happens Paul and Barnabas get upset at each other and they're in a conflict because I think it's Barnabas wants to go he wants to go back and try to find him and Paul says no I'm not going after him and so they get into a squabble back and forth back and forth and division takes place in the church this is a hero because Paul then later writes he says he's right here with me he's a comfort to me he's been my greatest comforter while I'm in this prison if you see him welcome him into your presence he's a brother that's a champion Peter denies Christ can you imagine Peter think about Peter this is guy walks on water right he's a little bit boisterous he's a little bit loud he's he's kind of like the center of attention he's one of Jesus's right hand he's right there with him and he's the one who walks on water and he's walking walking on water to Jesus and his faith begins to waver and in his walk he starts going down down down and as he's going down down down Jesus does what come on come on am you see sometimes your faith goes up and sometimes your faith goes down but Jesus is always right there to say come on come on and here's Peter Peter sitting here now and he's he's looking at this and he and Jesus tells him you're going to deny me Peter listen now you're going to deny me and Peter says no way I will never deny you he says listen before the crows in the morning you'll deny me three times no [Music] way do you know that man called Jesus never seen him I thought I saw you walking with him in the market wasn't me I thought you was with all those other guys that call themselves The Disciples it must have been some other guy with a beard like mine [Music] but that's the guy that Jesus says I will you're my rock so you see it throughout the Bible we see God using imperfect people and a lot of times we think we have to be perfect or God can't use us we think we have to be a preacher or God can't use us we think we have to be a deacon or God can't use us just be a believer and see how God can use you just find yourself under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and see if you're not one of those people that God can use he took a team of Misfits think about that he took a team of Misfits it wasn't the popular it wasn't the rich it wasn't the successful people it was the poor it was the needy it was the broken but they were faithful and he took those people and turned them into champions of God so when you make a mistake in your life don't don't let it just sit just don't don't lay there and just lay there and lay there get yourself back up and find your way back on your feet and put one foot in front of the other after the other after the other and say no matter what I do no matter how I fall I will serve God I will trust in God if I don't make it I'm going to go down trying God has a lot of broken people he deals in broken people and all we do is see the heroic side of them you don't think about Michael Jordan missing 3,000 shots 26 game winning shots you remember the one time that he jumps in a playoff when they throw him the ball he hits it at the last second and he jumps about this high off the ground I'm not even going to try I'm not brother Bor I can't get up here he jumps about this high off the ground hung out pumping his arms every one of you know the picture don't you I know I'm bald but I don't look like him that's what we remember we remember Abraham but when you think about Abraham he was just an old man yeah when you think about Elijah you think about all those Miracles he was suicidal depressed stressed you think about job he went bankrupt did you ever think about that lost everything he had serving God Moses had a speech problem Gideon full of fear Samson womanizer Rahab prostitute Samaritan woman divorced and prostitute Noah drunk Jeremiah he was just too young Jacob was a cheater David a murderer Jonah ran from God Naomi was a widow Peter denied Christ three times Martha worried about everything think about Martha in the Bible she was a warrior disciples they fell asleep in Jesus's most desperate hour his best friends fall asleep on him and the Bible tells us that we know that all things in God works to the good for those who love him and all of these things they had a purpose so I want you to know this morning that you're worthy we as Believers were worthy I'm coming to a close if you ever felt like you wasn't worthy I want you to know that you're worthy of God's Hall of Fame you know when we talk about a Hall of Fame The Prophet talked about the Hall of Fame you can look it up he talks about a picture and he talks about a portrait and he said this man took and he spent his life's dedication to drawing this picture and he said that picture went through the Hall of critics he said anything that goes through the Hall of Fame must first go through the Hall of critics and he said that portrait that that guy that painted he said it went through all the critics that there could be until it finally got hung into the Hall of Fame you know in sports they take a portrait and they take and they make a mold of the person the face of the person and they it's a Hall of Fame plaque and they keep it covered up and they go to a a presentation to get to that presentation you have to first be inducted into the Hall of Fame somebody has to elect you aren't you thankful you was elected before the foundation of the world they have to be elected they have to be inducted they have to have a ceremony let me tell you there is an adduction been made Christ before the foundation of the world seen each and every one of us and said that's my predestinated seed I elect them into the Hall of Fame and we're going to have a marriage and we're going to have a supper and I tried to tried and I searched the internet over trying to find a picture of a modern day Hall of Fame champion of God I couldn't find it but I did find a portrait that is perfect and I'm going to get that portrait I'm going to show you you just wait I'll be back now you know when you have a Hall of Fame presentation when they reveal the the the the portrait the crowd erupts The Crowd Goes Wild why because somebody has made a present because somebody has found worthy of being what they were the best at I want to be the best Christian I want to be the best believer I found a portrait that's got every one of you in it see yourself in the Hall of Fame God's Hall of Fame finds you right here nobody can take you out nobody can put you in but God and nobody can eliminate you you are what God Sees In the Hall of Fame let's stand God certainly been good to us today you love the Lord you see yourself in his program don't let failures hold you back don't let your faults hold you down just keep putting one foot in front of the other keep pressing forward get the Holy Ghost quit falling into Temptations
