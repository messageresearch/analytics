[1:05:15] amen I know I
[1:05:18] mean it might warn you amen the we may
[1:05:21] end up starting going a little bit
[1:05:23] longer Services amen would that be all
[1:05:25] right I have some longer services and so
[1:05:28] amen I was studying back there and I
[1:05:31] read where Paul there in the book of
[1:05:32] Acts amen he preached till midnight amen
[1:05:35] that midnight that man fell out of the
[1:05:37] third balcony and killed himself amen
[1:05:41] and Paul went over and prayed for him to
[1:05:42] raise up and they preached some more and
[1:05:44] amen then he said he had talked and
[1:05:47] spoke and fellowship sound like till the
[1:05:49] break of day at the break of day he went
[1:05:52] somewhere else all night long and then I
[1:05:55] thought wow that's a long service right
[1:05:57] there
[1:05:58] praise the Lord amen but I imagine we
[1:06:01] could stay awake if we had the dead
[1:06:03] raising up about 12 o'clock wouldn't we
[1:06:08] amen praise the Lord God is good isn't
[1:06:11] he and so amen I believe that uh amen
[1:06:15] the word of God is good and I just
[1:06:17] really enjoyed the Lord pouring this
[1:06:19] upon me amen so I trust that it'll be a
[1:06:22] blessing to you this morning I know that
[1:06:23] we want to have communion uh this
[1:06:25] morning and so amen I told the Deacon
[1:06:28] say man just we would hold off on Sunday
[1:06:31] school give us plenty of time amen maybe
[1:06:33] a little more for the word I think we've
[1:06:34] pretty much
[1:06:35] scheduled it not to have Sunday school
[1:06:37] on the first Sunday of the month since
[1:06:39] we do have communion and so forth and
[1:06:41] amen and so I'm still still in the trial
[1:06:44] stage amen we're still kind of in the
[1:06:47] trial stage of having that communion on
[1:06:49] Sunday morning but it does seem to work
[1:06:51] pretty good I think more of a skit to
[1:06:54] take it that way amen and so that's good
[1:06:57] because we do want as many as possible
[1:06:59] to take it amen but we don't want you to
[1:07:01] go home once for a Sunday night either
[1:07:03] amen and so amen and I believe tonight
[1:07:05] we're going to have a special treat so I
[1:07:07] hope everybody can make it back tonight
[1:07:08] amen and so
[1:07:11] we're going to have a testimony service
[1:07:12] a word of exhortation and so forth and
[1:07:15] amen and so uh a testimony amen and
[1:07:19] about what God has done for you amen
[1:07:21] what God has done for you amen I I tell
[1:07:25] you that song has really inspired me man
[1:07:27] that song about let me tell you about my
[1:07:29] Jesus let me tell you about my Jesus and
[1:07:31] so that's what we want to do tonight is
[1:07:33] I mean we want to hear from everybody
[1:07:34] that God has done something for for you
[1:07:37] and you get to tell everybody about what
[1:07:39] Jesus has done for you amen but it'll be
[1:07:42] good but to have a couple little things
[1:07:43] in here amen but uh this morning we want
[1:07:46] to preach on testimony amen testimony
[1:07:50] amen and so amen it's kind of a
[1:07:54] different different uh Direction perhaps
[1:07:57] than what I've went but amen will just
[1:07:59] trust the Lord in it let's bow our heads
[1:08:02] Lord Jesus we're so grateful father that
[1:08:04] before we open your thoughts Lord that
[1:08:08] you had before the foundation of the
[1:08:09] world and then you wrote him in a book
[1:08:11] lord father we realize that that Bible
[1:08:14] is your thoughts manifested and wrote on
[1:08:17] paper Lord and before we open that book
[1:08:19] lord Jesus and read your thoughts Lord
[1:08:22] Jesus and and have what you would have
[1:08:25] us to speak on Father this morning if
[1:08:27] we're so grateful to be able to approach
[1:08:28] the author of the book lord and we just
[1:08:31] thank God if we thank you for being able
[1:08:33] to approach you Lord and be able to come
[1:08:36] before you with the blood of Jesus
[1:08:37] Christ knowing god that we don't come
[1:08:39] it's about our own righteousness but we
[1:08:41] come the righteousness that you created
[1:08:43] on Calvary we ask God that you'll just
[1:08:45] bless the reading of the word meditation
[1:08:47] of our heart and father help us to
[1:08:49] deliver Lord Jesus what I feel like you
[1:08:51] have laid on our hearts to speak on this

[1:09:05] Michael and Emma's wedding coming up
[1:09:07] next month and then having some special
[1:09:09] meetings here even with brother Andrew

[1:09:15] going to be a little busy but that's
[1:09:16] okay amen and next Saturday of course
[1:09:18] amen amen the wedding shower for them
[1:09:21] amen trust every
[1:09:23] everybody will try to come amen and then

[1:09:42] here at the church amen
[1:09:43] looking forward to those meetings I
[1:09:45] trust that everybody will be ready and
[1:09:48] expect amen amen because I'll tell you
[1:09:50] what brother Andrew is certainly a
[1:09:52] powerful preacher amen amen but even he
[1:09:55] definitely needs to have pool amen and
[1:09:58] so we all want to pull when he gets here
[1:10:00] I mean as you do always amen we
[1:10:03] appreciate that amen God bless you we'll
[1:10:05] open our Bibles to Revelations this
[1:10:07] morning let's go to the Book of
[1:10:09] Revelations the first chapter
[1:10:11] Revelations 1.
[1:10:18] laughs
[1:10:23] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:10:27] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:10:31] things which must certainly come to pass
[1:10:34] and he sinned and signified it
[1:10:37] by his Angel unto his servant John who
[1:10:41] bear record now I want you to notice
[1:10:43] that bear record of the word of God and
[1:10:48] of the testimony
[1:10:50] of Jesus Christ and of the things that
[1:10:53] he saw may God add His blessings to the
[1:10:56] reading of the word you can be seated
[1:10:58] this morning amen we'll just title this
[1:11:00] we call the testimony this is going to
[1:11:02] be a day of testimony we're going to
[1:11:05] preach on testimony this morning with
[1:11:08] the help of the Lord amen and then have
[1:11:10] a testimony meeting this evening amen
[1:11:13] with the help of the Lord amen so we
[1:11:16] look at this with the help of the Lord
[1:11:17] and first of all that word testimony
[1:11:19] it's it's quite something because amen I
[1:11:23] didn't pull it up but I read different
[1:11:24] places where brother banham and he got
[1:11:27] to talking about like in the courtroom
[1:11:29] and so forth how that you know that's a
[1:11:31] lot of times where you have people
[1:11:33] giving testimony amen and that in order
[1:11:37] to be uh to give testimony you have to
[1:11:40] be a witness isn't that right you have
[1:11:42] to be a witness amen and you have to be
[1:11:44] there as a prophet of course who said
[1:11:46] and you know it's something that you had
[1:11:48] to see you had to be there worry that
[1:11:51] happened had to happen both the I think
[1:11:53] he mentioned two things you either have
[1:11:54] you've had to either see it or hear it
[1:11:58] amen either your eyes or ears and so
[1:12:00] forth amen and we realize that of course
[1:12:03] this whole book here is the Old
[1:12:05] Testament
[1:12:06] in the New Testament isn't that right
[1:12:08] amen and so this is God's testimony amen
[1:12:12] God's entire testimony amen of the whole
[1:12:15] book the whole Bible is a testimony and
[1:12:18] I wrote down here this morning we start
[1:12:20] here up here he says amen and we
[1:12:23] realized in this so I want to wrote down
[1:12:24] here especially today not that it isn't
[1:12:26] any different entity but especially
[1:12:28] today as we talk about testimony as we
[1:12:31] preach the gospel amen and we to realize
[1:12:34] and to think that as we stand here this
[1:12:37] morning the power of testimony or the
[1:12:41] power of preaching amen
[1:12:45] amen it's a very very powerful thing
[1:12:48] that you're you you're you're sit back
[1:12:50] you relax but you don't realize
[1:12:52] sometimes sometimes we don't realize the
[1:12:55] power
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:57] of preaching and so
[1:13:01] testifying of the things of God and how
[1:13:04] important it is to believe God's
[1:13:07] testimony amen amen I wrote down here we
[1:13:10] don't realize sometimes but you know it
[1:13:12] has just a word the words that I speak
[1:13:15] this morning amen will have the power
[1:13:18] it's so
[1:13:21] powerful the words that we speak are so
[1:13:24] powerful that if you receive them it can
[1:13:28] actually cause you to live a hundred
[1:13:31] trillion years in a perfect State now I
[1:13:35] want to say repeatedly once a hundred
[1:13:38] trillion years are over then the cycle
[1:13:41] goes over again
[1:13:44] calm down calm down
[1:13:48] think about that the words that we speak
[1:13:50] this morning will have the power to do
[1:13:52] that or it'll have the power to send you
[1:13:56] into hell into damnation into a amen
[1:14:00] it's total separation from almighty God
[1:14:03] to be destroyed in the Lake of Fire and
[1:14:06] to become
[1:14:07] extinct
[1:14:11] that's the kind of power we're talking
[1:14:13] when we come to the house of God
[1:14:17] so it's important isn't it we need to
[1:14:19] have our ears open and our eyes open and
[1:14:21] we need to hear what the spirit saith to
[1:14:24] the churches amen I realized this
[1:14:27] morning that this here this this thought
[1:14:29] that the lord gave me is it's so awesome
[1:14:31] that it would certainly take a long time
[1:14:33] but we'll just see how far the lord gave
[1:14:36] how the Lord how much uh which way the
[1:14:39] Lord will lead us amen
[1:14:41] a little more on testimony amen and I'll
[1:14:46] first talk uh perhaps if I can uh pick
[1:14:50] it up
[1:14:51] amen
[1:14:54] because I didn't write it down but I did
[1:14:57] look it up just before we come and this
[1:14:59] is about the testimony that what Jesus
[1:15:01] would give when Jesus come he gave
[1:15:03] testimony in Saint John 3
[1:15:08] and verse 31 John says he that Cometh
[1:15:12] From Above is above all and he that is
[1:15:15] of the earth is Earthly
[1:15:18] and speakers of the earth he that Cometh
[1:15:20] From A from Heaven is above all
[1:15:24] and what he has
[1:15:26] that's seen and heard that he testifies
[1:15:32] amen now that was talking about Christ
[1:15:35] and no man receives his testimony in
[1:15:38] other words it's very hard for people to
[1:15:42] receive God's testimony
[1:15:46] I want you to understand something that
[1:15:48] amen and I'll read the actual scripture
[1:15:51] for it but if you don't accept God's
[1:15:53] testimony you'll be damned and if you
[1:15:57] accept God's testimony you'll have
[1:16:00] eternal life
[1:16:03] it's a power to give you eternal life if
[1:16:06] you receive God's testimony
[1:16:12] no man receiveth his testimony he that
[1:16:15] hath received his testimony has set to
[1:16:19] his seal that God is true amen
[1:16:23] for whom for he whom God hath set
[1:16:26] speaketh the words of God isn't that
[1:16:29] what Jesus said he says the words that I
[1:16:32] speak I speak not of myself amen but I
[1:16:34] receive them of the father
[1:16:37] I may believe that everything Jesus did
[1:16:39] he got from a higher authority
[1:16:42] isn't it something that in order to
[1:16:44] forgive a testimony you have to be a
[1:16:46] witness you have to be there but if it
[1:16:48] says you have to know something and who
[1:16:51] knows anything more than God himself he
[1:16:53] knows everything he was there eat
[1:16:57] chocolate and if you're right
[1:16:59] you better believe it
[1:17:03] that's the power that changed your life
[1:17:07] if you receive it
[1:17:10] amen
[1:17:12] now notice so he says he has speak he
[1:17:15] speaketh the words of God for God giveth
[1:17:18] not the Spirit by measure unto him now
[1:17:22] how many knows that's the only person
[1:17:24] that ever lived that didn't have the
[1:17:26] spirit of God by major and that was
[1:17:28] Christ you and I have the spirit by
[1:17:31] measure but he had it without measure
[1:17:33] the fullness of the godhead dwelled in
[1:17:36] him bodily
[1:17:38] whatever he said was the testimony of
[1:17:41] almighty God
[1:17:45] praise be to God
[1:17:47] listen to the next verse I I kind of
[1:17:50] just stumbled upon this because I had
[1:17:53] stopped reading right there
[1:17:55] but notice the Father loveth the Son and
[1:17:58] hath given all things into his hands and
[1:18:01] then in verse 36 he that believeth on
[1:18:05] the Sun have everlasting life and he
[1:18:09] that believeth not the son shall not
[1:18:13] be
[1:18:14] he lied how many believes that's the
[1:18:17] testimony of God
[1:18:19] but the wrath of God abideth upon him
[1:18:24] amen so we see that the testimony of
[1:18:27] Jesus Christ is true one more just
[1:18:29] laying a foundation here in first John 5
[1:18:34] first John 5.
[1:18:43] and I don't understand too well
[1:18:46] about that little phrase about bearing
[1:18:48] record other than being a witness amen
[1:18:52] and so forth but in verse 7
[1:18:57] that's actually just uh yeah let's start
[1:19:00] with verse seven
[1:19:02] no no no let's go to verse six this is
[1:19:05] he that came by water and blood even
[1:19:08] Jesus Christ not by water only but by
[1:19:10] water and blood now notice and I want
[1:19:13] you to catch this phrase and it is the
[1:19:17] spirit
[1:19:18] that beareth witness amen I mean those
[1:19:23] it's a spirit that bears witness because
[1:19:26] the spirit is true for there are three
[1:19:30] that bear record in heaven the Father
[1:19:31] the word and the Holy Ghost and d3r1
[1:19:35] amen how many knows the Father the word
[1:19:38] and the Holy Ghost is all the same
[1:19:40] person
[1:19:41] all the same and there are three that
[1:19:43] bear witness on Earth the spirit the
[1:19:45] water and the blood and these three
[1:19:47] agree in one amen and if we receive the
[1:19:51] witness of men the witness or testimony
[1:19:55] the witness of God is greater
[1:19:58] I may know that
[1:20:00] my isn't that something how they need to
[1:20:02] record a law how did you have to put
[1:20:04] your hand on a Bible to swear that what
[1:20:07] you tell the testimony that you give is
[1:20:09] going to be the truth the whole truth
[1:20:11] and nothing about the truth and then
[1:20:13] they'll still lie cause you can't
[1:20:15] believe a man
[1:20:16] but let me tell you when you put your
[1:20:18] hand on this you know that you actually
[1:20:20] know that it is absolute truth
[1:20:23] God does not lie his word is the truth
[1:20:33] amen for this is the witness of God
[1:20:36] which he has testified of his son I may
[1:20:40] believe the whole Bible it is the
[1:20:42] witness of God that God testified of his
[1:20:45] son it's the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:20:50] amen the testimony
[1:20:53] and he that believeth on the Son of God
[1:20:56] hath to witness in himself and he that
[1:20:59] believeth not God hath made him a liar
[1:21:02] because he believeth not the record amen
[1:21:07] or the testimony
[1:21:09] are the witness that God gave him his
[1:21:12] son so like I said earlier to believe
[1:21:15] his witness to believe his testimony is
[1:21:18] to receive lives to deny it is to call
[1:21:21] God
[1:21:22] fire
[1:21:29] think about it
[1:21:31] so let me put you in plain simple
[1:21:33] language
[1:21:35] if you disbelief what God said you're
[1:21:38] calling him a liar
[1:21:40] thank you
[1:21:43] everybody that don't believe this is
[1:21:47] calling God a liar
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:52] and if you'll notice that if you truly
[1:21:55] believe
[1:21:56] now notice
[1:21:57] how many knows many places uh well let
[1:22:00] me just finish a couple more verses and
[1:22:02] this is the record that God has given
[1:22:04] unto us eternal life and this life is in
[1:22:07] his son he did have the son have life
[1:22:10] and he that hath not the Son of God hath
[1:22:12] not
[1:22:14] life amen
[1:22:19] over in
[1:22:25] to to go along with
[1:22:27] a certain verse here
[1:22:29] if we receive the witness of men the
[1:22:31] witness of God is greater
[1:22:35] verse 10. he that believeth on the Son
[1:22:37] of God hath the witness
[1:22:40] in himself
[1:22:42] amen
[1:22:43] now we know that uh we
[1:22:47] we fertile a lot there's a lot of people
[1:22:50] that say well I believe the Lord Jesus
[1:22:51] Christ amen and and that's enough that's
[1:22:54] it that's all I need well brother man
[1:22:56] says look
[1:22:57] you know if you truly believe it God
[1:22:59] would baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:01] there's a lot of people that say they
[1:23:02] believe Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:04] but it don't really
[1:23:07] because the bottom line is he that
[1:23:09] believeth on me shall not perish isn't
[1:23:11] that right so it is a simple salvation
[1:23:13] is in if you truly believe in the Lord
[1:23:16] Jesus Christ
[1:23:18] amen that's how that's that's how it is
[1:23:20] amen but God gives you the witness
[1:23:25] that you truly believe
[1:23:27] a top Prophet taught us according to
[1:23:28] Abraham Abraham believe God they imputed
[1:23:31] him for righteous
[1:23:32] listen God gave him the Sea of
[1:23:34] circumcision amen as the seal that he
[1:23:36] truly accepted his faith and if God
[1:23:38] truly if you truly believe it
[1:23:40] he that believeth on me shall not perish
[1:23:43] but have everlasting life Jesus said
[1:23:45] many places if you truly believe you'll
[1:23:47] be saved
[1:23:49] amen
[1:23:55] amen
[1:23:56] First Corinthians 12
[1:23:59] in verse
[1:24:01] three that's wherefore I give you to
[1:24:04] understand that no man speaking by the
[1:24:07] spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed huh
[1:24:11] so in other words you can never say that
[1:24:14] you uh you that you're a holy ghost self
[1:24:17] person and curse God
[1:24:19] Holy Ghost will never do that
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:23] even brother Madam you know I Thomas
[1:24:25] that if a person says well I believe God
[1:24:27] but I don't believe what that word says
[1:24:29] I don't believe that
[1:24:30] he says that person ain't got the Holy
[1:24:32] Ghost
[1:24:34] I didn't know nothing about the message
[1:24:36] the prophet or anything else but when I
[1:24:38] received the Holy Ghost something told
[1:24:39] me you believe that from cover to cover
[1:24:41] from one side all the way to the other
[1:24:43] and I went out testing everybody see if
[1:24:45] they really believed all of it I told
[1:24:47] you about that it don't want to be an
[1:24:49] old man to tell you 150 times
[1:24:53] is that right testing everybody do you
[1:24:56] believe it I don't understand it but
[1:24:57] that's what the Bible says it's got to
[1:24:59] be right all I want to hear from you is
[1:25:01] I amen but it'll kind of be the truth I
[1:25:03] don't understand it all but that's right
[1:25:05] and that's without limiting anything
[1:25:07] else let me tell you if you got the Holy
[1:25:09] Ghost you'll believe God's word
[1:25:12] the Holy Ghost believes he's walking
[1:25:15] he's working something in here mate you
[1:25:17] believe it
[1:25:19] oh Hallelujah and then we might not
[1:25:22] understand we might have not quite
[1:25:24] understood but Prophet makes a statement
[1:25:25] he says you know if you say you believe
[1:25:27] that you believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:29] and so forth he says you know that you
[1:25:32] can't even count you don't even know
[1:25:34] Jesus is the Christ until you got the
[1:25:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:39] cause you don't know him you do not know
[1:25:41] him until he's in here
[1:25:44] that's how you know him
[1:25:48] oh my
[1:25:50] god notice nobody can say he's a cursor
[1:25:52] deny his word and all that and that no
[1:25:55] man can say that Jesus is Lord but by
[1:25:59] the Holy Ghost In other words the
[1:26:01] witness if you truly believe that
[1:26:03] witness is going to come into your heart
[1:26:07] and it is the spirit that Bears record
[1:26:10] oh even Paul says you know this is how
[1:26:13] you know that your sons of God even
[1:26:14] because of the spirit that is within us
[1:26:17] that's what tells you that you're a Son
[1:26:19] of God is because the Holy Ghost that's
[1:26:21] in there oh man
[1:26:26] praise the Lord
[1:26:28] you can't deny it
[1:26:31] people won't believe it people don't
[1:26:33] want to believe the testimony of
[1:26:34] almighty God
[1:26:37] Amen brother Ben
[1:26:39] be preached on the message called the
[1:26:41] witness Witnesses he begin with with
[1:26:44] Jonah uh not Jonah but with Noah is that
[1:26:48] right
[1:26:48] I didn't know I had a message in that
[1:26:50] right no I had a message and sold the
[1:26:52] world
[1:26:53] now I want to I wanted to talk to you a
[1:26:55] little bit with the aspect
[1:26:57] talking about the aspect that I call it
[1:26:59] the Thomas effect
[1:27:01] doubting Thomas effect
[1:27:03] amen we'll maybe get into that a little
[1:27:05] bit
[1:27:06] but Noah he had a message that God said
[1:27:09] that it's gonna rain
[1:27:10] I mean everybody believed Noah's
[1:27:13] testimony got saved
[1:27:16] everybody that didn't believe is
[1:27:18] testimony neither the man sucked water
[1:27:22] up into there until they couldn't
[1:27:25] breathe no more
[1:27:26] that's what happens with the rest of
[1:27:27] them
[1:27:28] they all died because they would not
[1:27:30] believe
[1:27:31] his testimony
[1:27:34] you know it's not always it's easy to
[1:27:36] believe it's what you think
[1:27:38] and I hope with the help of the Lord I
[1:27:40] know we're going to go a little longer
[1:27:41] pass but you know
[1:27:43] we want to just go down through
[1:27:45] here
[1:27:46] let me let me uh
[1:27:50] go into calling a witness let's call a
[1:27:53] witness first of all
[1:27:56] and we're going to call a witness this
[1:27:57] morning
[1:27:59] and it's called creation
[1:28:03] we're going to call nature in all of
[1:28:05] creation
[1:28:06] amen
[1:28:07] it's found in Romans if you want to go
[1:28:09] with me
[1:28:17] Romans the first chapter
[1:28:30] Verse 18 for the wrath of God is
[1:28:31] revealed from Heaven against all
[1:28:33] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[1:28:35] who hold a truth in unrighteousness
[1:28:37] because that which may be known of God
[1:28:40] is Manifest in them for God has showed
[1:28:43] it unto them
[1:28:45] for the invisible things of him from the
[1:28:48] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:28:52] wow
[1:28:54] being understood by the things that are
[1:28:57] made
[1:28:58] amen
[1:29:02] being understood by the things that are
[1:29:04] made even is eternal power and godhead
[1:29:07] so that they are without excuse
[1:29:10] how many knows that this morning when
[1:29:12] you got up you testified you witnessed
[1:29:15] that there's a Resurrection coming
[1:29:18] when you met the bed last night yeah man
[1:29:21] you was typing an old man going to the
[1:29:24] grave and covering up
[1:29:27] and departing out of this world into the
[1:29:30] Dreamland
[1:29:32] huh isn't that right
[1:29:35] every day that we live testifies that
[1:29:38] there's a resurrection
[1:29:42] every cycle of the moon the Half Moon
[1:29:45] full moon all the way to Full Moon and
[1:29:47] everything else that's every month
[1:29:49] testifies every year testifies all of
[1:29:53] nature testifies every season testifies
[1:29:59] We're In the Heat of the summer
[1:30:01] coming down Towers fall
[1:30:04] hello
[1:30:05] this spring every time that little leaf
[1:30:07] buds
[1:30:09] hello when that little blue not on a
[1:30:11] tree and it begins to sprout
[1:30:14] it says there's a Resurrection on every
[1:30:18] tree on everything it's yelling out hey
[1:30:20] there's a Resurrection coming if people
[1:30:22] will just look at the creation they'd
[1:30:24] know there's a God
[1:30:25] even as God had his Road in nature and
[1:30:28] touches things like the lion it's the
[1:30:31] king of the jungle when he Roars
[1:30:33] everything else shuts up that every man
[1:30:35] would be alive and by the truth
[1:30:39] oh what even the Bible says the lion has
[1:30:41] roared who can but prophesy he's the
[1:30:45] line of the tribe of Judah he has
[1:30:47] prevailed
[1:30:49] look at the lion
[1:30:52] look at these eagle
[1:30:55] the Bible talks about Jehovah ego he's
[1:30:57] the Jehovah Eagles the king of the birds
[1:31:00] is that right
[1:31:01] there's a king
[1:31:03] of the jungle
[1:31:07] aren't you glad there's a king in this
[1:31:09] jungle
[1:31:11] that's right it's not it's not a lord
[1:31:12] Jesus Christ it's the word of God
[1:31:15] it'll overcome every other word every
[1:31:17] other thing everything man every scheme
[1:31:20] of man
[1:31:23] I think Tommy said something about this
[1:31:27] A1 this artificial intelligence and they
[1:31:29] were doing something about talking about
[1:31:31] man becoming God now
[1:31:33] I'd love to have that Pulpit for a few
[1:31:35] minutes
[1:31:38] it wouldn't be very very proper I said
[1:31:40] man of yeah you're just proving you are
[1:31:44] so
[1:31:45] becoming less intelligent all the time
[1:31:47] you think by making artificial
[1:31:48] intelligence and get a computer to think
[1:31:50] for himself you've done something huh
[1:31:53] but really why don't you just
[1:31:56] make something out of thin air once like
[1:31:59] God does
[1:32:00] he'll take squirrels and they're eating
[1:32:02] on their poop there they are he'll take
[1:32:04] loads of fish just multiply it that's
[1:32:07] what I'm talking about
[1:32:09] all you can do is go with your hardware
[1:32:11] and all of your mechanics and everything
[1:32:13] else it ain't nothing
[1:32:16] you'll answer to the king one of these
[1:32:18] days
[1:32:22] I'd like to tell that guy says Hey sir
[1:32:25] the day will come that you're gonna
[1:32:27] kneel before Jesus and you're gonna
[1:32:29] confess that he's Lord
[1:32:33] I'm a witness I'm testifying to you
[1:32:36] that's what God's word says and the day
[1:32:37] will come
[1:32:39] now all I have to do is wait
[1:32:41] because it's gonna happen
[1:32:43] mumbling jumbling rapidly mouth all you
[1:32:46] want to but that's what's going to
[1:32:47] happen
[1:32:49] foreign
[1:32:51] maybe they're listening I hope that
[1:32:54] dude
[1:32:57] realize that if you don't believe the
[1:32:59] testimony of God you're going to be
[1:33:01] damned
[1:33:04] if you don't believe every testimony
[1:33:07] oh my 11.
[1:33:09] praise the Lord
[1:33:11] that's right so nature I won't go
[1:33:13] throughout too much so much can be said
[1:33:14] because you could look at the animal
[1:33:16] kingdom you can look at the nature of
[1:33:17] birds and animals and all these other
[1:33:19] things and realize
[1:33:21] he's so unique
[1:33:23] that it has to be a Creator there's got
[1:33:25] to be something somebody that made that
[1:33:27] that didn't just happen people
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:31] I don't like the words they're used to
[1:33:32] stupid too much but anybody that you've
[1:33:35] got to be from stupid not to know that
[1:33:36] there's somebody that has to make all of
[1:33:37] that
[1:33:39] and it doesn't matter isn't it something
[1:33:41] how the generation from generation
[1:33:42] despair will do the same thing to Martin
[1:33:45] will do the same thing every bird from
[1:33:47] down to Generation generation for
[1:33:48] thousands of years they'll make their
[1:33:50] nests in the same place them barn
[1:33:52] swallows they'll come into your barn and
[1:33:54] they'll go up there and they'll get mud
[1:33:55] and they'll make them a mud mess
[1:33:57] [Music]
[1:33:59] they don't even evolve folks they do
[1:34:02] whatever stuff got the Instinct what God
[1:34:04] put in their nature to do
[1:34:06] come on folk and I'm here to tell you
[1:34:08] that it's in the nature of the believer
[1:34:09] just screaming to shouting to pray God

[1:34:15] God
[1:34:16] it's just in our nature

[1:34:30] Amen ain't nothing but a fire left for
[1:34:32] this place nothing but judgment to come
[1:34:34] to this world
[1:34:39] amen
[1:34:41] praise the Lord you look at nature
[1:34:43] and you see
[1:34:49] amen
[1:34:53] God can take the rocks
[1:34:56] God can take a rock
[1:34:59] and bring somebody to Christ
[1:35:03] just look at the Rocks
[1:35:08] good look
[1:35:11] huh
[1:35:12] means you can look at nature you can see
[1:35:14] God
[1:35:15] sure
[1:35:17] foreign
[1:35:25] ful ungodly bunch of mess is what we got
[1:35:29] people don't even appreciate freedom
[1:35:32] that's why they're gonna lose it
[1:35:34] amen
[1:35:35] amen all right let me go on talk about
[1:35:37] the Rocks here's some time ago there was
[1:35:40] an infidel
[1:35:41] went across the country oh 20.
[1:35:44] 30 years ago can I just say what Pops in
[1:35:46] my mind
[1:35:48] you say stupid yeah stupid the Bible
[1:35:50] says that uh he that says there's no God
[1:35:53] a fool says in his heart
[1:35:58] now I called you stupid God called you a
[1:36:00] fool
[1:36:01] pretty strong in it
[1:36:03] amen and he was noticed he went across
[1:36:06] there and he was tearing up church or
[1:36:07] smart intelligent man he was tearing up
[1:36:09] the churches and saying there's no such
[1:36:11] a thing as God and he went to England he
[1:36:13] was too smart for them here and he took
[1:36:15] off the England made Commerce there his
[1:36:16] health broke down he come back went out
[1:36:18] west to rest and one day
[1:36:21] he'd made fun of the Bible when he
[1:36:23] talked about how the handle even
[1:36:24] destruction happened and now it cut the
[1:36:26] heels and so forth he thought that was
[1:36:28] all a bunch of nonsense
[1:36:29] so he took a little walk one day out
[1:36:31] along a path and he got to look and hear
[1:36:33] the winds come down across mountains and
[1:36:35] he looked up at them great big rocks
[1:36:37] hanging there he says Oh Mr Rock he says
[1:36:40] this really did you come the way I think
[1:36:42] you did
[1:36:43] or did someone that I don't know put you
[1:36:45] there brother I'm telling you preachers
[1:36:48] will hold their peace the rocks will
[1:36:50] immediately cloud
[1:36:52] if I said not make rocks cry out that's
[1:36:55] not how the Rocks convert people let's
[1:36:57] get people to believe the testimony of
[1:36:59] God
[1:37:02] that Infidel fell on his face there and
[1:37:05] gave his heart to Christ
[1:37:07] huh
[1:37:11] why the clergyman held their peace but
[1:37:14] nature cried out in the midst of it all
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:20] amen isn't that something
[1:37:23] what he could look at that rock but he
[1:37:25] can realize hey something had to put it
[1:37:29] there
[1:37:31] it just didn't get there by itself
[1:37:35] this man was getting some serious
[1:37:38] getting rid of some foolishness
[1:37:40] and gaining some serious smartness
[1:37:44] now wasn't he
[1:37:46] he got some serious intelligence when he
[1:37:48] thought the right thoughts
[1:37:50] isn't that right

[1:52:11] guess
[1:52:14] she didn't care yeah I believe the story

[1:52:19] have to ask it won't be Jonah

[1:52:28] God
[1:52:30] amen how many ladies we gotta believe
[1:52:32] the testimony of God
[1:52:37] amen
[1:52:43] let's talk about Paul for a few minutes
[1:52:44] and then I'm going to go in to our age a
[1:52:47] little bit more
[1:52:48] but let's talk about
[1:52:50] Paul
[1:52:55] let me see where I've got it here in the
[1:52:57] book of Acts
[1:52:58] book of Acts
[1:53:04] you know Paul was always trying to give
[1:53:07] a witness he was a witness he had gotten
[1:53:09] struck down on the road to Emmaus
[1:53:14] was it Damascus that's right
[1:53:18] he got struck down he had a personal
[1:53:21] experience with God
[1:53:24] and we're taught in Saint John the first
[1:53:27] chapter
[1:53:28] that they were told to go into Jerusalem
[1:53:30] until they'd be endued with power from
[1:53:32] on high isn't that right
[1:53:34] he said after the Holy Ghost he's come
[1:53:36] upon them that they'll be Witnesses of
[1:53:38] me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and
[1:53:40] into the other most parts of the world
[1:53:42] to be a witness how many believes that
[1:53:44] we need to be a witness
[1:53:46] we are all Witnesses how you know
[1:53:49] brother Bissell I believe long ago he
[1:53:52] had a wonderful testimony of and he he
[1:53:54] called it I am
[1:53:56] a witness
[1:53:57] but I realized that everybody in here if
[1:54:00] you're a Son of God if you've been born
[1:54:02] again you are a witness
[1:54:07] how about with us
[1:54:11] I give testimony amen Paul he had it
[1:54:14] many times how many times he'd say he'd
[1:54:17] stop him he'd stand on the on the stairs
[1:54:19] and places and he'd begin to tell him of
[1:54:21] what God had done and how he's uh he
[1:54:24] struck him down in his story and so
[1:54:26] forth just to give him the testimony of
[1:54:28] what had happened
[1:54:29] Amen brother bam says you might not be a
[1:54:31] preacher this out of the other but just
[1:54:33] tell people how you fire god lit
[1:54:36] amen you ain't got nothing else
[1:54:43] oh I want to tell it here at the end of
[1:54:45] the service before we could I want to
[1:54:46] give you my testimonies amen
[1:54:51] let me tell you about my Jesus I love
[1:54:54] telling you about my Jesus all right but
[1:54:58] Paul here now notice
[1:55:01] in Chapter 13 of Acts
[1:55:06] that went into the synagogue and so
[1:55:08] forth
[1:55:09] and after verse 15 13 and 15 and after
[1:55:12] the reading of the law
[1:55:14] and the prophets
[1:55:16] the rulers of the synagogue sent unto
[1:55:18] them saying this does this Paul in them
[1:55:21] ye men and Brethren have ye any word of
[1:55:25] exhortation for the people if you have
[1:55:28] any word of exhortation say on
[1:55:31] and I'm going to skip a lot or we'll be
[1:55:33] here all morning but Paul goes all
[1:55:36] ultimate from Egypt all the way down to
[1:55:38] Moses and so forth all the way down all
[1:55:41] the way to verse 23 he finally comes up
[1:55:45] close to Jesus's time of this man's seed
[1:55:48] hath God according to his promise raised
[1:55:51] unto Israel a savior Jesus
[1:55:55] when John had first preached before his
[1:55:58] coming the baptism of repentance notice
[1:56:00] how he's at John's now
[1:56:02] repentance to all the people of Israel
[1:56:04] and as John fulfilled his course he said
[1:56:07] whom think ye that I am I am not he but
[1:56:11] behold there cometh one half boy Paul
[1:56:13] had a lot of wisdom when presenting the
[1:56:15] gospel didn't he
[1:56:17] whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy
[1:56:20] to lose that's what John the Baptist
[1:56:21] said men and Brethren Children of the
[1:56:24] stock of Abraham and whoso among you
[1:56:26] that feareth God to you is the word of
[1:56:30] this salvation sent
[1:56:34] for they that dwell at Jerusalem and the
[1:56:36] rulers because they knew him not
[1:56:39] not nor yet the voices of the prophets
[1:56:42] which are read every Sabbath day they
[1:56:46] have fulfilled them in condemning him
[1:56:49] boy isn't that specific in other words
[1:56:52] because it read the scriptures oh God we
[1:56:54] can say that
[1:56:55] and Men amongst the church well today
[1:56:57] they'll read the scriptures they'll read
[1:57:00] Malachi 4 they'll read Revelations one
[1:57:02] two three and the Seven Stars and so
[1:57:05] forth but they don't never comprehend it
[1:57:12] if
[1:57:14] fulfilled it
[1:57:15] condemning him found no call
[1:57:19] cause of death in him yet they desired
[1:57:23] pilate that he should be slain and when
[1:57:25] they had fulfilled all that was written
[1:57:27] of him they took him down from the tree
[1:57:29] and laid him in a Sepulcher and God
[1:57:31] raised him from the dead
[1:57:34] amen and he was and he was sent many
[1:57:38] days of them which came up with him From
[1:57:42] Galilee to Jerusalem who are his
[1:57:44] Witnesses unto the people
[1:57:51] and we declare unto you glad tidings how
[1:57:56] did the promise which was made unto the
[1:57:58] fathers God hath fulfilled the same unto
[1:58:01] us their children
[1:58:04] that he hath raised up Jesus again
[1:58:08] and it is also written in the Psalms
[1:58:11] second from Thou Art my son this day
[1:58:13] have I begotten thee Paul begins to even
[1:58:15] bring the scriptures in for him isn't
[1:58:17] that right
[1:58:18] and as concerning that he raised him up
[1:58:20] from the dead now no more to return to
[1:58:23] corruption he said on this wife wise I
[1:58:26] will give you the sure mercies of David
[1:58:30] whoever he says also in another Psalm
[1:58:33] Thou Art not Thou shalt not suffer that
[1:58:35] Holy One to seek corruption for David
[1:58:37] after he has served his own Generation
[1:58:39] by the will of God fell to sleep and was
[1:58:42] laid with his fathers and saw corruption
[1:58:44] Paul trying to point out to him that
[1:58:46] that's this what Paul what David was
[1:58:49] talking about Jesus not himself but he
[1:58:52] whom God raised again saw no corruption
[1:58:55] be it known unto you therefore men and
[1:58:57] Brethren that though this man is
[1:59:00] preached unto you that through this man
[1:59:02] is preached unto you the Forgiveness of
[1:59:05] sins and by him all that belief are
[1:59:09] Justified from all things
[1:59:13] aren't you glad that you're Justified as
[1:59:15] though you never know that
[1:59:17] from everything your entire house has
[1:59:20] been struck off
[1:59:23] from which he could not be justified by
[1:59:27] the law of Moses be fair beware
[1:59:29] therefore at least that come upon you
[1:59:31] which was spoken of in the prophets
[1:59:34] behold ye despisers and wander and
[1:59:36] perish for our work and work in your
[1:59:38] days the work which she shall in no wise
[1:59:40] believe though a man declare it unto you
[1:59:45] amen and it says that of course they
[1:59:48] went out from that Sabbath day to the
[1:59:50] next and so forth and then they found
[1:59:52] that there was a lot of people that
[1:59:53] began to follow after the next Sabbath
[1:59:56] day they came almost the whole
[1:59:57] congregate Old City together to hear the
[1:59:59] word of the Lord but the Jews when they
[2:00:01] saw the multitude they were filled with
[2:00:03] envy and spake against those things
[2:00:06] which were spoken of by Paul
[2:00:09] contradicting and blasphemy amen how
[2:00:12] many of those
[2:00:13] the testimony Paul gave they had to
[2:00:15] either choose whether they would believe
[2:00:17] it or they would not believe it
[2:00:23] amen
[2:00:28] see belief doesn't always come as easy
[2:00:30] as what we think
[2:00:32] I'm going to read another scriptures
[2:00:33] before we bring this up into our time
[2:00:37] do you realize this morning
[2:00:39] that in Matthew 28 and 5 through 8 it
[2:00:44] says and the angel answered and said
[2:00:46] unto the women fear not ye for I know
[2:00:48] that ye seek Jesus which was crucified
[2:00:50] he is not here he is risen
[2:00:55] as he said come come to the place where
[2:00:58] the Lord laid and go quickly and tell
[2:01:00] his disciples didn't Brothers preach
[2:01:02] many places go tell go tell my disciples
[2:01:05] that he's not dead but he's risen
[2:01:11] mine from the dead and behold he goes
[2:01:14] before you into Galilee and ye shall and
[2:01:16] he shall see him low I have told you and
[2:01:19] depart departed from the and then he put
[2:01:21] it quickly from the Sepulcher for the
[2:01:22] fear of great joy and did run to bring
[2:01:26] his disciples word hello I mean we
[2:01:28] always heard about people Peter running
[2:01:30] isn't that right but here are the first
[2:01:33] people that ever ran to give testimony
[2:01:36] of the Resurrection was a couple of
[2:01:38] women
[2:01:41] Seven Devils it'd be like taking a
[2:01:44] couple of our sisters I thought about
[2:01:46] doing have them going without him have
[2:01:47] him come running in here to me and say
[2:01:49] no hey brother Jesus is this prison
[2:01:52] Jesus is risen I'm like oh I don't
[2:01:54] believe you
[2:01:55] as the Bible says they didn't believe it
[2:01:58] huh
[2:01:59] go tell my disciples that he is
[2:02:04] risen the other account of it is found
[2:02:07] in Saint John
[2:02:13] during verse seven
[2:02:16] but go your ways tell his disciples
[2:02:18] Peter that he goes before you into
[2:02:21] Galilee and and there shall you see him
[2:02:25] as he said unto you and they went out
[2:02:27] quickly and fled from the Sepulcher for
[2:02:30] they trembled and were amazed neither
[2:02:32] said they anything among to any men for
[2:02:35] they were afraid Jesus
[2:02:38] was risen early the first day of the
[2:02:40] week he appeared for
[2:02:41] Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven
[2:02:43] Devils and she went and told them that
[2:02:47] had been with him as he mourned and wept
[2:02:50] and they
[2:02:52] when they had heard that he was alive
[2:02:54] and that had been seen of her believe
[2:02:56] not after that he appeared in another
[2:03:00] form I to two of them as they walked and
[2:03:02] went into the country and they went and
[2:03:04] told it to the residue neither believe
[2:03:06] they them
[2:03:08] huh
[2:03:10] oh I try to get to people's mindset it's
[2:03:13] always easy to believe Jesus of the past
[2:03:17] but to believe what Jesus is doing and
[2:03:19] right in front of you that's a lot of
[2:03:21] times the hard part
[2:03:24] amen
[2:03:28] Lord she appeared on 11 as they sat at
[2:03:30] meat and abraded them with their
[2:03:32] unbelief and Hardness of Heart because
[2:03:34] they believed not them which had seen
[2:03:36] him after he was risen
[2:03:38] amen now notice here he abraided them
[2:03:41] for their unbelief then he said go into
[2:03:43] all the world preach the gospel to Every
[2:03:45] Creature he that believeth in his mouth
[2:03:46] that shall be saved he that believeth
[2:03:48] not shall be them and he shot
[2:03:51] and shall follow them that believe in my
[2:03:52] name they shall cast out Devils they
[2:03:54] shall speak with new tongues and if they
[2:03:56] take up serpents and if they drink
[2:03:57] anything it shall not hurt them and if
[2:04:00] they lay hands on the sick they shall
[2:04:02] recover
[2:04:04] amen you know sometimes you're not you
[2:04:07] don't talk about in in John I believe it
[2:04:10] was in John the first chapter
[2:04:13] uh
[2:04:15] uh hold on a minute
[2:04:23] nope it's the same it's right across the
[2:04:25] page there Luke the first chapter
[2:04:27] he says you know even as they delivered
[2:04:30] them unto us
[2:04:31] delivered what to us let me read the
[2:04:33] first verse for as much as many this is
[2:04:36] the first verse of chapter uh one of
[2:04:39] Luke for as much as many have taken in
[2:04:42] hand to set forth in order a declaration
[2:04:45] of those things
[2:04:47] which
[2:04:48] are most surely believed Among Us even
[2:04:52] as they delivered them unto us which
[2:04:54] from the beginning were eyewitnesses and
[2:04:57] Ministers of the word in other words
[2:05:00] they were eyewitnesses
[2:05:02] they were a witness so they could
[2:05:03] testify this is what we saw
[2:05:07] but how many knows Even in our
[2:05:09] generation we never saw the mighty works
[2:05:12] that God did
[2:05:13] sometimes you don't see
[2:05:16] so where there's the power come if
[2:05:18] you're not a witness you didn't see
[2:05:22] this is the Thomas effect that I wanted
[2:05:24] to talk to you about because remember
[2:05:25] Thomas was the kind of one I've got to
[2:05:27] be an eyewitness I've got to put my hand
[2:05:29] in this side I've got the touches
[2:05:32] tomorrow Mrs hamster I won't believe
[2:05:35] in other words he wanted to really be a
[2:05:37] wet
[2:05:38] this but Jesus said Thomas you know it
[2:05:41] is greater to have not seen and believe
[2:05:43] how many believe we ain't seen but we
[2:05:46] believe anyway
[2:05:49] how many believes that we love we want
[2:05:52] to see a church of a book of Acts and so
[2:05:54] forth don't we
[2:05:56] man we see we'll see God in the mighty
[2:05:58] way
[2:05:59] now let's bring it up for another 15
[2:06:01] minutes maybe into our day would that be
[2:06:02] okay
[2:06:04] you know because Paul there was talking
[2:06:06] and testifying of what Christ had done
[2:06:09] in his hour
[2:06:11] amen now notice brother bam says it this
[2:06:14] way now on these type of testimonies
[2:06:17] he says God who is my judge would know
[2:06:20] this and I say this if I'm exaggerating
[2:06:23] God forgive me he don't never try to do
[2:06:25] that I believe that I can stand here if
[2:06:28] it was possible possible enough and for
[2:06:31] the next 500 hours gift testimony of
[2:06:34] things that I know that our Lord has
[2:06:36] done and it wouldn't even cover it of
[2:06:39] things of the thousands of volumes of
[2:06:42] books wouldn't put it into detail
[2:06:49] of what God but Jesus has done in our
[2:06:52] day
[2:06:54] how many knows that even brother Brown
[2:06:55] says science has to testify to God
[2:07:00] even science remember they took the
[2:07:02] picture of that cloud amen they didn't
[2:07:03] know what it was even the philosopher
[2:07:06] Francis acknowledge it's God
[2:07:08] he makes him acknowledge the testimony
[2:07:11] of almighty God brought it into
[2:07:13] a few
[2:07:15] they've got to testify that it is
[2:07:18] oh my
[2:07:19] again another quote I wish I could
[2:07:22] testify a little bit now of the things
[2:07:25] that I've seen happen
[2:07:27] amen I thought about him give me a
[2:07:30] minute I'll take some of my sermon this
[2:07:32] morning I'll testify to the people amen
[2:07:34] you said you know that you can believe
[2:07:36] it or you don't have to believe it but
[2:07:37] God is my judge and I'll be able to give
[2:07:39] a record on the day of judgment but when
[2:07:42] I went beyond the curtain of time those
[2:07:43] people were real
[2:07:46] he was over there somebody said I
[2:07:48] believe that
[2:07:50] I believe that when that bull came after
[2:07:52] him
[2:07:54] been a serpent biting him like Paul did
[2:07:57] amen but to still had power over nature
[2:07:59] we've had a book of Acts Road Again
[2:08:02] you could tell that ball to go back and
[2:08:05] lay down you might make fun of it you
[2:08:07] might make fun of him having and seen
[2:08:09] horses in heaven he's his horse in
[2:08:10] heaven
[2:08:12] remember that critical preacher says
[2:08:14] brought a randomized your story and your
[2:08:16] vision was fine until you talked about
[2:08:18] your dog and your horse
[2:08:20] got all critical stuff
[2:08:22] let me tell you something it's in
[2:08:24] critical Spirits God don't have much for
[2:08:27] it
[2:08:28] God don't have much for critical spirits
[2:08:30] don't you ever let a critical spirit get
[2:08:33] on you amen
[2:08:34] it's the worst thing that can happen to
[2:08:36] you sit in the Pew and be critical of
[2:08:39] the of the servant of God
[2:08:43] [Music]
[2:08:48] I mean those is demon powers
[2:08:50] demon powers
[2:08:52] oh my
[2:08:54] God

[2:08:59] tonight to get my testimony I want to
[2:09:01] y'all give y'all plenty of time tonight
[2:09:02] amen
[2:09:04] but let me finish this is okay if I had
[2:09:07] a little bit of time to seeing what
[2:09:08] things that I had seen happen just the
[2:09:10] last few weeks oh I could test what I
[2:09:12] could testify like Lou said Luke said
[2:09:15] about Jesus and all the books he says
[2:09:17] there wouldn't be enough books in the
[2:09:18] world to write it just what I've seen in
[2:09:21] my own Ministry what I've seen him done
[2:09:22] notice what Jesus done in Brothers
[2:09:25] Ministry now what brother Brown did but
[2:09:27] what Jesus you always got will could
[2:09:29] realize it was Jesus
[2:09:32] what I seen him do just in my own
[2:09:34] Ministry he had more success in my
[2:09:37] Ministry than he did with his own
[2:09:41] when he was here he was only here for
[2:09:44] three and a half years Amen brother
[2:09:46] Brandon was here from I don't know how
[2:09:48] many 30 40 50 years that he preached
[2:09:50] went around the world
[2:09:52] oh boy give us another Kings another
[2:09:55] book where where are all of uh uh uh
[2:10:01] Jezebel and all her prophets came to
[2:10:03] Mount Carmel remember said let's see
[2:10:05] who's God is gone we had another one
[2:10:07] happen like that oh how many of those
[2:10:09] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[2:10:11] and forever and he come and did the very
[2:10:13] same things today he challenged the
[2:10:15] Buddha that seeks to change all of the
[2:10:18] religions of the world come over here
[2:10:20] and open these Blind Man's eyes
[2:10:23] I didn't see it but I believe it and I
[2:10:27] can have the effects I'll be believing
[2:10:29] it
[2:10:33] I believe one person said spoke against
[2:10:36] that pillar fire and died another one
[2:10:37] says I believe that and was healed
[2:10:40] just your attitude towards it
[2:10:42] amen
[2:10:44] I believe it anyway
[2:10:47] amen
[2:10:49] Hallelujah more success in my Ministry

[2:10:54] Spider-Man says that's not me here Glory
[2:10:57] Hallelujah more success in
[2:10:59] Jeffersonville that he did in Nazareth
[2:11:01] because they did not believe him
[2:11:04] because he thought they knew him
[2:11:07] oh preachers preachers preachers let the
[2:11:10] holy spirit will have to say to you on
[2:11:12] the day of judgment
[2:11:14] you just thought that brother Brandon
[2:11:16] was just another man
[2:11:17] to somebody else with a Ministry he was
[2:11:20] just a man he didn't have another
[2:11:21] Ministry but it was God's Ministry there
[2:11:24] was fire above any of theirs
[2:11:26] Jesus Christ would come down and he even
[2:11:29] challenged them brother since if you
[2:11:31] think you can do it
[2:11:34] come
[2:11:35] I'll step aside and you do you do this
[2:11:39] dang one would raise up because they
[2:11:42] know they aren't commissioned to do damn

[2:11:48] smoke or defy your body I have my work
[2:11:50] for you to do I'm not ashamed of the
[2:11:52] Gospel of Jesus Christ I'm not ashamed
[2:11:55] of the testimony of the possum I'm not
[2:11:57] ashamed of the Hornets I'm not ashamed
[2:11:59] of the squirrel said that God told him
[2:12:01] to create and he created them we've had
[2:12:03] another biscuits and see
[2:12:05] just
[2:12:06] and so forth and even greater than the
[2:12:08] fixings of the Lord we've had another
[2:12:09] book of Acts
[2:12:15] we've had another woman Touch the Hem of
[2:12:17] His Garment and then when that Mexican
[2:12:19] woman there wasn't enough deacons to
[2:12:20] stop her amen with her dead baby she
[2:12:22] called under him and over him but got to
[2:12:24] the prophet
[2:12:26] got to Jesus
[2:12:28] that's what he got too
[2:12:30] I believe it don't you
[2:12:32] I believe every story that's wrote and I

[2:15:33] brother comes brother Brown come up here

[2:15:53] Joe he said smarter that's what I
[2:15:55] thought right Savannah smarter than I
[2:15:57] thought
[2:16:03] let me tell you something if I can do
[2:16:06] that through a man it was not the man it
[2:16:08] was Jesus Christ I'll give my all for
[2:16:11] that
[2:16:12] I'll give my all for that there's people
[2:16:14] commissions folks if you want to get on
[2:16:15] the internet and look at all the
[2:16:16] negative and the bad stuff you can
[2:16:18] actually almost ruin your faith by the
[2:16:20] junk and the mess
[2:16:22] that message preachers who have preach
[2:16:24] this message have
[2:16:25] turned away from the prophet and
[2:16:27] everything else they've looked for false
[2:16:29] they've looked for faults and some of
[2:16:31] them will point out that fault and this
[2:16:32] fault and that fault but abandon wasn't
[2:16:34] perfect but I'm gonna tell you something
[2:16:36] I'm not perfect either them guys are not
[2:16:38] perfect either
[2:16:41] oh
[2:16:46] this is just me worth five cents but I
[2:16:50] wonder if God didn't do it in such a way
[2:16:52] and allow those mistakes to be made just
[2:16:54] to knock them off
[2:16:57] just to knock them off because even our
[2:16:59] Prophet said that he will say stuff do
[2:17:01] the sad things to thin down the crowd
[2:17:05] because I want you to know I give my
[2:17:07] soul to the Lord Jesus Christ knowing
[2:17:10] that that was and while he was here
[2:17:13] they would have never done it because
[2:17:16] your father he had been here he said now
[2:17:18] you Brothers think I was wrong on this
[2:17:19] come here
[2:17:21] I think they'd be smart too they'd
[2:17:24] probably be smart enough to head on out
[2:17:27] oh they're listening this morning you're
[2:17:30] fools
[2:17:32] that's right you're a fool to do what
[2:17:33] you did to turn on God after claiming
[2:17:36] that you was a you know claiming that
[2:17:38] you believed the message
[2:17:40] amen

[2:17:45] you love the Lord I believe the
[2:17:46] testimony of God I believe him all the
[2:17:49] way
[2:17:50] I believe God

[2:19:04] sisters when they told him all of them
[2:19:05] should have believed that they said I
[2:19:07] had to dance
[2:19:11] they were
[2:19:14] too many bad things that happened in my
[2:19:16] life
