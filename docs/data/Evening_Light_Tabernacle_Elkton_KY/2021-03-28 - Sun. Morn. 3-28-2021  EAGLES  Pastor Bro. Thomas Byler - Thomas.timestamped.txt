[33:58] bible reading this morning
[34:14] psalms 103. if you would uh i just want
[34:18] to
[34:18] just make mention of a little incident
[34:20] happened yesterday just remember
[34:22] if you would i wasn't going to mention
[34:24] it but something just kept nudging me
[34:25] that you know if you're concerned the
[34:26] lord is concerned so
[34:29] there were about we were at a turn or a
[34:30] ball game yesterday for the
[34:32] boys baseball and and we had like five
[34:35] or six
[34:35] vehicles that were the windows were
[34:37] knocked out
[34:39] and they sold uh billfolds purses
[34:42] uh anything that i guess they could grab
[34:44] so my billfold was stolen joyce's
[34:46] and my parents stuff was stolen so uh
[34:49] but out of the five they probably got
[34:51] away with
[34:52] i don't know two or three maybe two
[34:53] thousand dollars a couple of handguns
[34:55] and
[34:56] those kinds of things but that's that's
[34:57] not you know that's neither here or
[34:58] there but we kind of you know
[34:59] everybody's concerned about their social
[35:01] security cards
[35:02] driver's license all that so just just
[35:05] pray that you know
[35:06] nothing would transpire out of that
[35:08] nobody wants identity
[35:09] theft and stuff like that so just
[35:11] remember that in your prayers
[35:12] in the upcoming days we appreciate it

[35:53] acts unto the children of israel
[36:01] he will not always chide neither will he
[36:03] keep his anger forever
[36:12] for as the heaven is high above the
[36:14] earth so great is his mercy toward them
[36:16] to fear him
[36:25] like as the father pitteth his children
[36:28] so the lord pitteth them that fear him
[36:36] as for man his days are as grass as a
[36:39] flower of the field
[36:40] so he flourished shall flourishing
[36:49] but the mercy of the lord is from

[1:05:06] before the lord
[1:05:07] lord jesus we come before you father and
[1:05:09] remember
[1:05:10] many years ago lord jesus when parents
[1:05:13] would bring their children to you
[1:05:14] to have you bless them lord jesus and
[1:05:17] and the disciples perhaps didn't want to
[1:05:19] do it
[1:05:20] but you said forbid them not
[1:05:23] to come unto me and so we believe lord
[1:05:27] jesus is a
[1:05:28] cow deals lord jesus they want to bring
[1:05:29] their child a lydian a father to you
[1:05:32] this morning

[1:05:35] hands upon her lord and
[1:05:37] ask your blessing upon her lord and her
[1:05:39] whole life lord
[1:05:41] father we don't know what the future
[1:05:42] holds but the age in which we are living
[1:05:44] in we know that she'll certainly need
[1:05:46] a special blessing father and i pray up
[1:05:48] and nurture out in the word of god
[1:05:50] understanding father
[1:05:51] children we thank you for this wonderful
[1:05:53] family lord thank you to a closer walk
[1:05:55] with you father
[1:05:56] please first of all i'm the prophet of
[1:05:58] course it's kyle and so for that buried
[1:06:00] there's a
[1:06:00] to how the prophet of god wow i wanna
[1:06:04] so we have that the eagle dust amen and
[1:06:07] that's another a big wheels perhaps amen
[1:06:09] let's just
[1:06:10] wouldn't do it you know you know it
[1:06:12] wouldn't do it any good
[1:06:14] it's about get um spreaders above her
[1:06:17] wings so
[1:06:18] did lead them it was just down we met
[1:06:20] down and went took fuzz you know that
[1:06:22] means there's more
[1:06:24] amen our eaglets we're to fly high
[1:06:27] praise me to god we're not
[1:06:31] praise be to god we know that brother
[1:06:33] banham's story his entire end of one of
[1:06:35] the favorite stories that he ever told
[1:06:36] is the story
[1:06:37] of the eagle egg that the farmer got and
[1:06:41] he put it under a chicken hand
[1:06:43] his nest because there wasn't enough
[1:06:44] eggs there to make a full nest
[1:06:47] and then he put an eagle in underneath
[1:06:49] under there
[1:06:51] and amen when as he grew up that eagle
[1:06:53] of course you can only imagine
[1:06:56] those chickens when it went to flop in
[1:06:57] his wings sometimes it probably beat him
[1:06:59] over the head
[1:07:00] because it was so much bigger
[1:07:03] and it also this just comes to my mind
[1:07:07] you forgive me
[1:07:08] but i imagine it's a time or two that
[1:07:10] that eagle began to look at them
[1:07:11] chickens a little bit different
[1:07:13] whenever he got hungry you know you know
[1:07:15] i don't know about you being my brother
[1:07:17] my sister you look more like dinner to
[1:07:19] me you know but
[1:07:20] it was just you know the appetite of
[1:07:22] that eagle was not the same as the
[1:07:24] chickens
[1:07:24] that's the way it is with you and i am
[1:07:27] we're just not happy in a barn yard
[1:07:30] now the prophet said you know that
[1:07:31] barnyard typifies a denomination or just
[1:07:34] your organized religion
[1:07:36] organize denominations you know because
[1:07:38] they believe this and they don't never
[1:07:40] grow
[1:07:41] they never expand they put a period
[1:07:43] behind what they believe
[1:07:44] and they never can't get any further and
[1:07:47] man and the devil had them so wrapped up
[1:07:49] until they were teaching in our age that
[1:07:51] the days of miracles is passed there's
[1:07:53] no such thing as the holy ghost
[1:07:56] all you can eat is worms and whatever
[1:07:58] you can scratch up
[1:07:59] well that's not good enough for us
[1:08:01] eagles was it no
[1:08:02] amen and whenever listen to them eat the
[1:08:05] sound just the sound of those chickens
[1:08:07] and the sound of an eagle is not even to
[1:08:10] be compared
[1:08:11] now i don't know about you but whenever
[1:08:13] a hawk or something like that flies over
[1:08:15] our chicken yard
[1:08:16] and then those chickens have a god-given
[1:08:19] sense to go
[1:08:19] and duck under something to get some
[1:08:22] shelter get out get away
[1:08:24] is that right but i can just imagine
[1:08:26] that eagle
[1:08:27] amen being in that same yard amen they
[1:08:29] heard the hog perhaps you know
[1:08:31] and they probably just stood there and
[1:08:33] said you know what is it that y'all are
[1:08:34] afraid of
[1:08:37] amen because that eagle has something on
[1:08:39] the inside
[1:08:40] amen that tells you tells that ego that
[1:08:42] it is more
[1:08:43] and greater and that it doesn't have the
[1:08:45] fear amen the sound of the hawk
[1:08:48] amen but it just didn't fit in it just
[1:08:50] wasn't right that's the way it was out
[1:08:52] of our life amen maybe went from
[1:08:54] church to church women amen we was in
[1:08:56] one party we all
[1:08:57] come out of a different barnyard
[1:09:01] amen i'm nobody too but i'm thankful to
[1:09:04] be out of the barnyard
[1:09:07] it meant that what brought us out of the
[1:09:08] barnyard was this word of god
[1:09:11] it was the great eagle that flew over
[1:09:14] and when that eagle mama great mama
[1:09:16] eagle screamed
[1:09:18] amen and he said man shall not live by
[1:09:20] bread alone but by
[1:09:23] every word of god that amen that was a
[1:09:26] rebound that came from the mind you said
[1:09:28] that sounds right because every church
[1:09:30] and every
[1:09:31] person in their denominations they only
[1:09:33] take so much of it
[1:09:34] they take what they want of it they
[1:09:36] interpret how they want to
[1:09:38] you know how they want to interpret it
[1:09:41] that's why the women have men's clothes
[1:09:43] on that's why they're wearing makeup
[1:09:45] that's why they're cutting their hair
[1:09:46] that's why
[1:09:47] all they kind of even preaching the
[1:09:48] gospel when the bible forbids it
[1:09:53] amen and so you know you know they just
[1:09:56] like what they want
[1:09:57] for for you and i we realize that man
[1:09:59] shall not live but by bread alone but by
[1:10:01] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:10:03] mouth of god and that was the very
[1:10:04] foundation of the prophet of god he says
[1:10:06] it's time to come back to the word of
[1:10:08] god to the full word of god
[1:10:11] amen when i begin to hear sound that's
[1:10:13] why when you listen to that take amen
[1:10:15] you hear that
[1:10:16] sound and you know that is correct
[1:10:19] praise be to god isn't it something
[1:10:24] how that um you know how did the
[1:10:27] after the prophet preach a message and
[1:10:29] then jesus christ would come down
[1:10:31] and we would discern the thoughts and
[1:10:32] the intents of the people and when i was
[1:10:34] listening to it yesterday he would say
[1:10:36] you know you're praying for something
[1:10:38] that's wrong with your side and your
[1:10:40] back and so forth but you're also
[1:10:41] praying for somebody else
[1:10:43] how would he know that but you're also
[1:10:45] praying for somebody else and so forth
[1:10:47] and you know and it doesn't matter how
[1:10:49] much he i said you know
[1:10:51] the very same thing that jesus did 2 000
[1:10:53] years ago
[1:10:54] if he's the same he'll do the same thing
[1:10:56] again today
[1:10:57] he would come and he would do that very
[1:10:59] thing you know right
[1:11:00] and people don't realize that is exactly
[1:11:03] jesus christ
[1:11:04] amen discerning the thoughts and tense
[1:11:06] of the heart again amen but this time it
[1:11:08] is in his
[1:11:09] church body that he's doing it in it
[1:11:12] made in a humble little kentucky prophet
[1:11:15] and that's what stumbles people and you
[1:11:16] know even though god raised
[1:11:18] about 11 to 13 people from the dead
[1:11:21] through the william
[1:11:22] branham's ministry amen
[1:11:25] it comes to bear that where remember
[1:11:28] the rich young ruler that died amen
[1:11:32] in the bosom of abraham and that rich
[1:11:34] man died and went to hell he says you
[1:11:36] know
[1:11:36] you know somebody they told him if
[1:11:38] somebody would raise from the dead
[1:11:41] they would still not believe and that's
[1:11:44] the way this generation was the people
[1:11:45] even though people raised from the
[1:11:47] they still don't believe even on the
[1:11:49] sign of the messiah
[1:11:50] then right in front of people they still
[1:11:52] don't believe
[1:11:56] and isn't that what abraham told me he
[1:11:57] says no one raised from the dead they
[1:11:59] will not believe
[1:12:02] you can have people raised from the dead
[1:12:04] people still not complete
[1:12:08] just stay in your seats aren't you
[1:12:09] thankful that you're one of the ones
[1:12:11] that believe
[1:12:12] i'm glad that the lord helped me open my
[1:12:15] eyes
[1:12:16] believe that actually god sent a prophet
[1:12:19] before the destruction of this world and
[1:12:21] this world is getting wicked amen
[1:12:23] it is getting to be a bad place amen now
[1:12:27] one thing i want to bring out and that
[1:12:28] is that when when you begin to leave
[1:12:30] that barnyard you hear that call and you
[1:12:32] go up on higher that it's about
[1:12:35] atmosphere
[1:12:36] how many believes it's about atmosphere
[1:12:38] living in a different atmosphere
[1:12:40] a better atmosphere amen not
[1:12:44] be so earthbound not bound by the cares
[1:12:48] of life not bound by your bills not mine
[1:12:51] by this that or the other
[1:12:53] but come up the higher revelations four
[1:12:56] after the churches ages remember
[1:12:58] he says i seen a door open amen and a
[1:13:00] voice coming
[1:13:01] out and said come up hither come on up
[1:13:04] higher
[1:13:05] that's what we want to do this morning
[1:13:07] come up higher yeah come up a little
[1:13:09] higher
[1:13:10] because i'll tell you what we're going
[1:13:11] higher and higher and higher
[1:13:13] until one of these days we're our feet
[1:13:16] are going to
[1:13:17] lose gravitation and we're going to lift
[1:13:19] right up on out of here
[1:13:20] and that's not a fairy tale i think
[1:13:22] that's really going to happen i really
[1:13:24] believe that
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:29] i hope you can amen

[1:21:14] care of that
[1:21:16] sure can we can we serve the living god
[1:21:19] not a dead god not a god of history but
[1:21:22] a god that is here now
[1:21:25] a living god
[1:21:29] oh isn't that awesome
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:32] praise the lord that's how he lived
[1:21:36] and even though we live in an hour of
[1:21:38] prosperity
[1:21:39] even though we live in an age of plenty
[1:21:45] we have more than what we need
[1:21:49] huh i have more than i need
[1:21:53] i had that great big old house up in
[1:21:55] elkton right
[1:21:56] i went out there and moved in the
[1:21:57] country and built me a little house
[1:21:59] forget these big houses
[1:22:03] huh we was living in there and lived up
[1:22:06] in the upstairs had our bed there before
[1:22:09] the walls were even in that's right we
[1:22:11] had a bunch of little smoke bombs and we
[1:22:13] climbed up a ladder to get up there and
[1:22:14] put our mat
[1:22:15] we loved it out there we had fan we had
[1:22:18] friends from florida diana and all of
[1:22:19] them came up here and they'd seen how we
[1:22:21] were living
[1:22:22] you know what she told me she said i
[1:22:24] don't feel a bit sorry for you
[1:22:31] i said i understand that could be up
[1:22:33] there living in 2 500 square feet
[1:22:36] with three big bedrooms and all kinds of
[1:22:38] three-bath lot but
[1:22:39] here i am living like this he didn't
[1:22:41] feel me she knew i could do this
[1:22:43] we enjoyed it though but we have more
[1:22:47] than what we need
[1:22:48] for the most part think about it but you
[1:22:50] know what i'm trying to say here is what
[1:22:52] jesus said he says
[1:22:53] therefore take no thought saying what
[1:22:55] shall we eat
[1:22:56] or what shall we drink for where with
[1:22:58] all shall be we be close
[1:23:01] praise the lord oh let me just stop a
[1:23:05] minute let me talk to you a little bit
[1:23:06] about a bird
[1:23:07] amen flying over people's head and
[1:23:10] they're talking about an eagle that
[1:23:11] makes its nest in the cleft of the rock
[1:23:14] amen and brother bam talk about you know
[1:23:16] when a bird flies over your head
[1:23:17] and then he puts thoughts in there amen
[1:23:20] just let it go right on out just shoot a
[1:23:21] birdie away
[1:23:23] get rid of those talks amen because amen
[1:23:26] david said amen that we ought to
[1:23:28] meditate upon him
[1:23:30] day and right night
[1:23:34] even jesus said lord think be careful
[1:23:37] about what you think about
[1:23:42] amen because how many knows that's where
[1:23:44] the nest is made
[1:23:45] this is where the womb is to the soul
[1:23:49] amen and so he says no don't worry about
[1:23:51] your food don't worry about your clothes
[1:23:53] and all of that
[1:23:54] because the devil always tries to get in
[1:23:56] here if he can get it here
[1:23:58] he can get in there don't make no nouns
[1:24:01] don't let them birds make no mess but
[1:24:03] keep your meditation on the lord
[1:24:04] blessed is the man whose mind is stayed
[1:24:07] on thee
[1:24:10] i still don't like how much
[1:24:13] i don't think about god how busy i get
[1:24:15] with
[1:24:17] things so busy
[1:24:20] with things i'm getting to the place
[1:24:22] where i just like my
[1:24:23] hour or i want to have and just
[1:24:27] play some good gospel music i like to
[1:24:29] play
[1:24:30] oh how many was gospel music it does
[1:24:32] something for you
[1:24:34] if you've got the holy ghost and just to
[1:24:36] bathe in some good music
[1:24:38] and then read your bible listen to a
[1:24:40] tape
[1:24:41] pray have fellowship with god
[1:24:44] folks if you don't do that enough you
[1:24:46] need to do it more
[1:24:48] because it's what gives you your
[1:24:50] strength
[1:24:52] it's what renews your youth
[1:24:56] amen it's a renewing
[1:25:00] all that other stuff it just
[1:25:03] drags you down this is the only thing
[1:25:05] that'll pick you up
[1:25:07] it'll only give you joy amen you pray
[1:25:10] for me will
[1:25:11] but i'll take more time out of my
[1:25:13] schedule to pray and just to bask
[1:25:16] in the presence of the lord just to love
[1:25:18] the lord
[1:25:19] love him how many knows it how many of
[1:25:21] us be be honest you need to love the
[1:25:23] lord more
[1:25:25] we need to love the lord more
[1:25:30] amen
[1:25:36] amen praise be to god so
[1:25:40] shall we slow down a little let's slow
[1:25:42] down a little bit
[1:25:49] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:25:51] the counsel of the ungodly
[1:25:53] nor standeth in the way of sinners nor
[1:25:55] sitteth
[1:25:56] in the seat of the scornful but his
[1:26:00] delight is in the law of the lord
[1:26:04] and in his law does he meditate
[1:26:08] on sunday morning wednesday night
[1:26:11] once in a while
[1:26:15] no day and
[1:26:19] night your mind
[1:26:23] amen it's nesting
[1:26:27] in here you want joy
[1:26:31] let your mind make a nest right here
[1:26:34] just
[1:26:34] nest right here
[1:26:38] make a nest in the cleft of the rock
[1:26:43] way high above the badgers and the
[1:26:48] weasels and the opossums and everything
[1:26:50] else that can get you and bite you
[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:57] in other words if you really want to be
[1:26:58] blessed do this
[1:27:00] let your light delight be in the law of
[1:27:02] the lord and in his law
[1:27:04] meditate day and night and i tell you
[1:27:06] what you're going to be like a tree
[1:27:08] planted by the rivers of water
[1:27:10] fruit in his season his leaf also shall
[1:27:12] not wither and whatsoever
[1:27:14] he doeth shall prosper
[1:27:19] amen all right
[1:27:23] let's go on let's talk about
[1:27:26] a kite for a second let's talk about
[1:27:30] the eagle in the air
[1:27:33] what puts him up there well
[1:27:37] when i thought about thought about
[1:27:38] flying a kite
[1:27:40] go fly a kite let's fly a kite
[1:27:48] i did the other day with my
[1:27:49] grandchildren paul
[1:27:53] fly a kite with me
[1:27:56] all right i'll quit what i'm doing and
[1:27:59] go fly a kite with you
[1:28:01] but it's a little windy so we might have
[1:28:03] to put this little
[1:28:05] what do you call them little hooks that
[1:28:07] snap on little round
[1:28:09] u-hooks of some kind some little hook
[1:28:11] i'm gonna have to put some weight on the
[1:28:12] tail
[1:28:13] because i used to love to fly kites when
[1:28:15] i was a little boy at school and at home
[1:28:17] loved that legging out there as far as i
[1:28:19] could
[1:28:20] and it's a little windy so we're gonna
[1:28:22] have to put this and another time
[1:28:24] i'd say look there's no wind so we can't
[1:28:27] play a kite
[1:28:28] i mean like you gotta have wind to fly
[1:28:30] okay
[1:28:34] why what's gonna happen you gotta run
[1:28:36] right
[1:28:37] and who wants to run from the one end of
[1:28:39] the field to the other to try to get the
[1:28:41] kite up
[1:28:42] right how about a boys no but it's nice
[1:28:46] when there's some wind why
[1:28:48] because somebody knows that that that
[1:28:50] kite is
[1:28:52] designed it's engineered
[1:28:58] to need wind to take it up higher
[1:29:03] amen that's the same way with eagle how
[1:29:06] many notes
[1:29:07] when there's a little wind that comes
[1:29:09] along
[1:29:10] am i right when it comes along it learns
[1:29:14] it don't have to
[1:29:17] that's what happens whenever you ain't
[1:29:18] got no
[1:29:20] you gotta struggle along the climb huh
[1:29:25] amen so you think about it
[1:29:29] the the eagle when he has a little bit
[1:29:32] of wind
[1:29:33] what does he do even the buzzard out
[1:29:34] there how many knows they're always
[1:29:36] turning and their tails going sideways
[1:29:39] what are they doing setting their wings
[1:29:43] and sailing and letting that wind do
[1:29:45] what
[1:29:49] amen why because that wind is like
[1:29:52] trials for us
[1:29:55] it's like winds things that happen they
[1:29:57] come our way
[1:29:58] is that right amen and
[1:30:01] it'll cause us either to take a towel
[1:30:03] like it does
[1:30:04] tighten tightness but if you are
[1:30:07] balanced right
[1:30:08] if you balance yourself right that wind
[1:30:11] is glorious because what if it caused
[1:30:13] you to climb higher
[1:30:15] those trials those winds that come our
[1:30:18] way
[1:30:18] amen don't play make you stronger take
[1:30:21] you higher
[1:30:26] praise be to god bad things
[1:30:29] the power of god is said that god can
[1:30:31] put on us is a trial
[1:30:34] it's a test what
[1:30:38] out there it's called road rage people
[1:30:40] shoot each other they go crazy he drives
[1:30:41] them crazy but not an
[1:30:43] eagle not a child of gods

[1:32:02] this
[1:32:03] amen the lord must know that i might
[1:32:06] need a little patience here huh
[1:32:09] why because something else is going to
[1:32:10] come up down the road i'm going to need
[1:32:12] patience so
[1:32:13] praise be to god just let it climb up a
[1:32:15] little higher i mean he's with me
[1:32:17] let those things actually kill them
[1:32:20] right we could just
[1:32:22] a lot of trials that come your way let
[1:32:24] you hire
[1:32:25] in christ
[1:32:28] oh my let those things pick you up let
[1:32:31] me know
[1:32:32] man we'd have never heard the story we
[1:32:34] wouldn't still be preaching about it
[1:32:36] daniel would have never been exalted the
[1:32:38] way that he was
[1:32:40] unless first he overcame a trial the
[1:32:42] wind that we're gonna throw you in the
[1:32:44] lion's den
[1:32:46] it was a strong wind but what did he do
[1:32:48] he put the god down
[1:32:49] on his knees he set his wings of faith
[1:32:54] wings of faith in god
[1:32:58] huh and he carried him right past those
[1:33:02] lions
[1:33:05] right past them into being exalted in
[1:33:07] the kingdom until they made an image of
[1:33:09] him
[1:33:11] and had everybody worshipping his image
[1:33:14] three hebrew children come along and
[1:33:16] realize hey it ain't right
[1:33:17] to worship a prophet i don't care how
[1:33:20] mighty your prophet is you don't worship
[1:33:21] the prophet
[1:33:23] you worship the god of the prophet amen
[1:33:26] and begin to worship him amen man said i
[1:33:28] am lest you fall down and worship this
[1:33:30] image will burn you
[1:33:31] it was another win there are examples
[1:33:33] amen of winds that come along that can
[1:33:35] lift you higher
[1:33:40] god help me get to the place god help
[1:33:43] you to get to the place
[1:33:45] where nothing bothers you
[1:33:47] [Applause]
[1:33:48] what i mean by that is the devil can't
[1:33:51] get you
[1:33:51] because you're back in christ so far
[1:33:54] until he can't reach you
[1:33:56] the only way he'll get to you is to come
[1:33:58] up up higher where you're at
[1:34:01] huh he's got to come plumb up there he's
[1:34:04] got to get saved
[1:34:05] he got to get the baptism of the holy
[1:34:07] ghost to get where you're at
[1:34:13] what did the prophet say would make him
[1:34:14] then
[1:34:16] that's right class you're good i would
[1:34:19] make him your brother
[1:34:25] whoa huh that's right you say well
[1:34:30] he ain't my brother now he'll never be
[1:34:33] safe because he went beyond that isn't
[1:34:35] that right
[1:34:36] but think about it it's about how many
[1:34:40] knows it's really about atmosphere
[1:34:42] getting up into an atmosphere
[1:34:50] because let me tell you how many knows
[1:34:52] this earthly atmosphere is contaminated
[1:34:54] with
[1:34:55] devils and evil things and homosexuality
[1:34:58] and
[1:34:58] now they want to teach our children in
[1:35:01] school the history of homosexuality
[1:35:05] at least that's what i heard it might be
[1:35:07] gossip i don't know but i wouldn't doubt
[1:35:08] it
[1:35:09] huh they want to teach them that you
[1:35:11] don't really know who you are
[1:35:12] until you get seven years old then you
[1:35:15] can decide whether you want to be a boy
[1:35:16] or girl to seven years old
[1:35:23] isn't it something the only thing you
[1:35:26] can say is people's mind is completely
[1:35:28] gone
[1:35:30] it's completely gone i don't care who
[1:35:33] hears this
[1:35:35] you when you have the mindset that your
[1:35:37] child at seven years old
[1:35:39] can make that kind of choice boy there
[1:35:42] is something
[1:35:42] seriously deficient about you
[1:35:46] amen oh my well we'll get off that but
[1:35:50] it's the truth isn't it that's
[1:35:51] that's the corruption that's the
[1:35:54] horrible conditions in the atmosphere
[1:35:56] that this world is getting in and it's
[1:35:58] getting worse and it's getting worse
[1:36:00] and it's getting worse but my question
[1:36:02] to each and every one of you is
[1:36:04] what atmosphere are you creating what
[1:36:06] atmosphere are you living in
[1:36:12] what is the atmosphere of every one of
[1:36:14] our homes
[1:36:19] what is the atmosphere with between the
[1:36:22] parents and the children because i'll
[1:36:23] tell you whatever your atmosphere is
[1:36:25] however high heavenly it is or not is
[1:36:28] how heavenly or not it will be right in
[1:36:30] here when you come on in here
[1:36:31] on a sunday morning when tonight go

[1:42:38] not being able to get to the fridge
[1:42:39] hardly not be able to cook for yourself
[1:42:41] not being able to
[1:42:42] think of how horrible it is if god just
[1:42:44] had you to be blind
[1:42:46] huh how many knows we can be thankful we
[1:42:49] praise god
[1:42:51] for his goodness to us amen
[1:42:54] when we climb higher
[1:42:59] what about the downed eagle let's talk
[1:43:01] about the downed eagle a little bit
[1:43:03] remember brother demands down the eagle
[1:43:04] story he was up there hunting
[1:43:06] and he come across as he he hurt his
[1:43:08] chatter chatter
[1:43:09] and he looked there was an eagle down
[1:43:11] there and the storm actually had knocked
[1:43:13] that eagle down
[1:43:15] he got into that storm how many knows he
[1:43:17] should have rode over the storm but he
[1:43:18] got in the storm
[1:43:19] a minute the storm was too much and it
[1:43:21] knocked that eagle down down into them
[1:43:24] trees and there he was
[1:43:26] and he was warming his feather in the
[1:43:27] sunshine isn't that right
[1:43:30] oh little now he didn't pay no attention
[1:43:32] to that
[1:43:33] spine squirrel and all these other
[1:43:34] things that were chattering and going on
[1:43:36] he wasn't worried about that but he said
[1:43:38] he kept his eye on brother branham
[1:43:40] because he had a gun right there sitting
[1:43:41] by that tree and so forth and
[1:43:43] says i could take this gun and i could
[1:43:44] shoot you before you could take to the
[1:43:46] skies
[1:43:47] but he wasn't worried i'm going to say
[1:43:49] this just while it comes to mind the one
[1:43:51] thing that an eagle is is crazy
[1:43:54] all right they're fearless have you ever
[1:43:56] seen what eagles will attack
[1:43:58] coyotes wolves sheep still attack just
[1:44:01] about anything they ain't afraid hardly
[1:44:03] of
[1:44:03] anything eagle is fearless
[1:44:07] isn't that right why because they know
[1:44:10] that
[1:44:11] they have the ability that they need
[1:44:14] but there he was that eagle was down and
[1:44:17] it was warm in his feathers
[1:44:19] it was drying it maybe a trial
[1:44:22] maybe a test gets you down maybe
[1:44:24] something you could go through i mean it

[1:44:42] this for me back then
[1:44:44] i know you're still the same god today
[1:44:46] and you begin to pray maybe you have
[1:44:48] fallen short of the glory of god maybe
[1:44:50] you've sinned
[1:44:50] amen but just get it under confession
[1:44:52] put it under the blood and let the
[1:44:54] sunshine begin to warm you back up again

[1:45:09] weight lay aside every weight and the
[1:45:11] sin that does so easily beside you
[1:45:13] and that get that all aside

[1:45:18] little breeze come through there

[1:45:23] eagle he was ready to fly and if i reach
[1:45:25] for that gun
[1:45:26] to get it and swinging around he says
[1:45:28] that eagle would
[1:45:30] down through the timbers it would try to
[1:45:32] hit that right there will you
[1:45:34] huh he was gone before he could
[1:45:37] ever got that gun guy because he's got
[1:45:40] confidence
[1:45:42] in them wings amen
[1:45:45] how about you this morning those wings
[1:45:47] of faith that you have proven and tested

[1:45:53] faith in that
[1:45:55] praise the lord i believe as we climb
[1:45:57] into the atmospheres of the holy ghost
[1:45:59] amen let me tell you something i got to
[1:46:01] thinking about how that that eagle was
[1:46:02] down
[1:46:03] amen it's our business if our brother is
[1:46:05] down to pick him up
[1:46:07] amen sometimes we get down we get
[1:46:09] discouraged
[1:46:11] we get to the place where we couldn't be
[1:46:13] and the rest of us we can either
[1:46:14] criticize that person and push him down
[1:46:16] in the ground a little more
[1:46:19] been there done that folks somebody do
[1:46:22] not be
[1:46:22] just what you think they ought to be and
[1:46:24] we have a tendency to just jump on top
[1:46:25] of them and stomp them down
[1:46:27] rather than somehow pray for them and
[1:46:29] lend a hand say hey come on up higher
[1:46:31] come on up higher don't be discouraged
[1:46:32] come on up high get out of that
[1:46:34] you're back sliding what areas come on
[1:46:36] out of there come on up here come on up
[1:46:38] higher let's go
[1:46:38] higher amen
[1:46:42] if our brother's in the way we'll run
[1:46:44] right over him
[1:46:48] if our sister's in the way we will run
[1:46:50] right over her
[1:46:52] no if the devil's in the way we will
[1:46:57] go ahead run right over him that's right
[1:47:01] there's no redemption for him praise be
[1:47:04] to god but if our brother our sisters in
[1:47:05] the way we will pick him up we will stop
[1:47:07] and pick him up we will stop and pick
[1:47:09] her up that's what we're about
[1:47:11] that's what the body of christ is to
[1:47:12] bring us up into a higher atmosphere
[1:47:15] into a heavy atmosphere until the holy
[1:47:17] ghost can come down
[1:47:18] ain't going to saturate our hearts our
[1:47:20] life changes from what we are
[1:47:22] or what we used to be to what we're
[1:47:24] supposed to be
[1:47:28] brother bam says i haven't got much
[1:47:30] hopes for a pastor's church
[1:47:32] that hasn't got any ambitions to better
[1:47:34] themselves
[1:47:35] day by day year by year a church that's
[1:47:39] really a church
[1:47:40] of the living god will never stop and
[1:47:42] say well i just
[1:47:44] got saved well i'm in the message huh
[1:47:47] no i guess that's all right that ain't
[1:47:50] the church of god
[1:47:51] he's got ambitions to press off
[1:47:54] i mean believes we've got higher
[1:47:56] ambitions
[1:47:58] a real ego has high impatience
[1:48:04] it swelled on that for a little bit it
[1:48:06] reminded me of the story but the bam
[1:48:07] said about how did he
[1:48:08] had a bomb come to his door he says well
[1:48:12] where
[1:48:12] where you know where have you been
[1:48:15] nowhere
[1:48:16] where are you going nowhere
[1:48:20] huh let me tell you that's where our
[1:48:23] country's at they don't know where they
[1:48:24] come from
[1:48:24] and they don't know where they're going
[1:48:26] they're just sailing just
[1:48:28] go on somewhere they don't know where
[1:48:30] they're going
[1:48:31] they don't know where to come from they
[1:48:32] don't know what they are
[1:48:35] what a terrible state to be
[1:48:42] how was it donna said last i love my
[1:48:44] wife she'll get on that facebook
[1:48:46] and she'll forget all the funny ones and
[1:48:47] laugh all by herself
[1:48:51] in my time we had wonder woman
[1:48:55] now they wonder if it's a woman
[1:49:02] ain't that about the truth i thought
[1:49:05] that's right on it
[1:49:06] that's right they wonder they don't even
[1:49:08] know come on folks
[1:49:11] that's the pathetic contention the
[1:49:12] world's in
[1:49:14] but not you and i i like to know i'm a
[1:49:17] man that you're a woman hello
[1:49:19] oh my such a terrible state that the
[1:49:22] world is in
[1:49:23] amen but the ambition talk about into
[1:49:25] this bomb he come and didn't know where
[1:49:26] he come from
[1:49:26] he had no ambitions to you know
[1:49:28] ambushing him
[1:49:30] better himself i mean there's every in
[1:49:32] this world even you
[1:49:33] have to have some ambition some goal
[1:49:35] that you have to have
[1:49:37] but then brother and goes on to say he
[1:49:39] says you know
[1:49:40] he says it's like driftwood he says you
[1:49:42] know as you find the stream and there's
[1:49:43] a lot of driftwood
[1:49:44] but there's also boats that made out of
[1:49:46] the same material
[1:49:48] but it's been crafted it's been shaped
[1:49:51] it's been
[1:49:52] formed by the master
[1:49:55] like i told you last sunday man i would
[1:49:57] be nothing but dirty driftwood
[1:49:59] i don't know where i would be i would be
[1:50:00] as bad as everybody else probably
[1:50:02] if it wasn't for the fact that the
[1:50:04] master he may god
[1:50:05] in his hand and i want him to keep me in
[1:50:08] his hand
[1:50:08] i want him to keep shaping me keep
[1:50:10] powering me giving me
[1:50:12] form giving me power and strength
[1:50:15] and if i get in some rubbish pile if i
[1:50:17] get down into amen the
[1:50:19] blue so to speak if i get in some rut
[1:50:21] somewhere amen we have the power to get
[1:50:24] on my knees and
[1:50:25] pull myself right back out of there
[1:50:28] praise be to god i don't got to go to
[1:50:30] church for that i can do that at home
[1:50:32] you can do it on the way home you can do
[1:50:33] it at home
[1:50:34] wherever you are just get on your knees
[1:50:36] amen say god i need more of your power
[1:50:39] i need more of your holy ghost and it'll
[1:50:42] pull you out of that rut
[1:50:43] it'll change you from what you are
[1:50:45] you're we're a privileged people today
[1:50:47] we ought to be the happiest evening our
[1:50:49] tabernacle
[1:50:50] we ought to be the happiest church in
[1:50:52] this whole area
[1:50:58] because why should we be because it's
[1:51:01] there for you
[1:51:02] if you want it how many believe that
[1:51:05] it's there for
[1:51:06] you if you want it if we're not
[1:51:09] it's our own fault now if it wasn't
[1:51:11] accessible
[1:51:12] then it wouldn't be your fault but if
[1:51:13] it's accessible then it's your fault if
[1:51:15] you're not
[1:51:17] all right ambitions high
[1:51:21] ambitions next thing he talked about on
[1:51:25] that when he talked about that bummer
[1:51:26] he talked about how he says you know
[1:51:28] we're going to end up in a destination
[1:51:29] someplace we're going to
[1:51:30] wind up somewhere sometime but you know
[1:51:33] that god comes in
[1:51:34] he he he shapes that he forms it
[1:51:38] he makes it into the image that he's
[1:51:39] looking for amen
[1:51:42] and life he said this life
[1:51:46] amen is a lot higher our ambitions i
[1:51:49] believe it is
[1:51:50] uh you know not exact quote but he says
[1:51:53] you know we ought to have higher
[1:51:54] ambitions
[1:51:56] than just getting a big bigger house
[1:51:58] better house
[1:51:59] or a better car he said or a television
[1:52:02] or
[1:52:02] whatever hello or something better it's
[1:52:05] something better in life
[1:52:06] it's we ought to have higher ambitions
[1:52:08] in all of that
[1:52:11] praise be to god how many is with me
[1:52:12] this morning i want to have higher
[1:52:14] ambitions
[1:52:15] jesus said your ambitions need to be
[1:52:17] higher than just your food
[1:52:18] and your clothes god knows that but your
[1:52:21] ambitions should be
[1:52:22] that one of these days god is going to
[1:52:25] come and we are truly
[1:52:27] going to fly away from here
[1:52:32] and what we're doing this morning is
[1:52:34] getting ready
[1:52:35] for that time we're preparing ourselves
[1:52:39] our ambition amen
[1:52:43] is as the prophet said to better
[1:52:46] themselves
[1:52:49] day by day
[1:52:53] are you better than he was yesterday
[1:52:58] are you better than he was a week ago a
[1:53:00] year ago
[1:53:02] huh yearly monthly
[1:53:06] year by year he says we should always
[1:53:10] strive to be better
[1:53:14] amen more than just home
[1:53:18] because our truly how many knows our
[1:53:20] higher ambition
[1:53:23] is to have a new home an eternal home
[1:53:28] but we won't have no more gray hair
[1:53:30] won't get old won't have an ache here
[1:53:32] and ate there
[1:53:33] no more sin to deal with no trials no
[1:53:35] temptations to deal with
[1:53:37] we're truly looking for our glorified
[1:53:40] body i mean he's looking for a body
[1:53:41] james
[1:53:42] that's truly the ambitions that we
[1:53:44] should have
[1:53:46] in colossians paul told them he says if
[1:53:48] you then be risen with christ
[1:53:50] seek those things which are below
[1:53:53] thank you that's right that are above
[1:53:58] where christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:54:01] of god
[1:54:02] set your affections on things
[1:54:06] above and not on things
[1:54:10] on earth
[1:54:15] how many we all have affection affection
[1:54:18] we're all affectionate people
[1:54:20] our affection is somewhere and our
[1:54:23] affection
[1:54:24] is either on the things down here or our
[1:54:26] affection
[1:54:27] it's on things above the bible says if
[1:54:30] you're risen with christ
[1:54:32] then set your affections on things above
[1:54:36] we have a much higher ambition eagles
[1:54:40] have high ambitions
[1:54:43] way above fussing feuding
[1:54:47] arguing lying cheating stealing
[1:54:51] sin doubt fear
[1:54:54] all the way above all of that folks
[1:54:57] the holy ghost is way above all of that
[1:55:01] we're seeking a new body a new home what
[1:55:04] else are we looking for
[1:55:05] how many know we actually have such high
[1:55:07] ambitions
[1:55:08] that we're looking for a new
[1:55:12] earth and a new
[1:55:15] heaven where we're indwelleth
[1:55:18] righteousness
[1:55:30] a prophet taught us that death
[1:55:33] does not change your personality
[1:55:36] how you are and what you are just don't
[1:55:39] change you one
[1:55:40] bit if you're sinner over here you die
[1:55:44] you'd be a sinner over there
[1:55:45] you'd have that same nature you'd go
[1:55:46] wherever the sinners go
[1:55:50] so think about this
[1:55:54] because god has created even jesus it
[1:55:56] says that he ascended the fire above all
[1:55:59] principality and power and is set
[1:56:02] in heavenly places you and i are setting
[1:56:06] in heavenly places in
[1:56:09] christ jesus so what if he was to die
[1:56:13] drop dead right now remember whatever
[1:56:14] atmosphere you're in now
[1:56:17] but you took your last that the
[1:56:18] atmosphere you'd be in over there
[1:56:22] it would either not be of god or it
[1:56:23] would be heavenly
[1:56:27] it's quite a thought isn't it you'd
[1:56:29] either be right before god or you
[1:56:31] wouldn't be right before god and that's
[1:56:32] what you and i
[1:56:33] are working for saying lord that's what
[1:56:35] we want
[1:56:37] we want to have in our hearts to where
[1:56:39] we can honestly know
[1:56:42] and i believe it was uh the prophet
[1:56:45] mentioned and i'm not sure if it
[1:56:47] just which message it was but he talked
[1:56:49] about the pentecostals and the churches
[1:56:51] is your present condition
[1:56:52] he talked about their present condition
[1:56:55] would it
[1:56:56] actually be pleasing to the lord if he
[1:56:57] came right now and that's what we have
[1:56:59] to ask ourselves every day
[1:57:01] your presence where you are right now
[1:57:04] where each one of us is right
[1:57:08] now is it ready for the coming of the
[1:57:11] lord
[1:57:16] it's 10 after 12 with that clock
[1:57:19] 15 minutes after 12 the rapture is going
[1:57:23] to take place if i told you
[1:57:25] that's seven minutes
[1:57:29] it's going to be all over with
[1:57:35] how many knows there is a time set there
[1:57:38] is a time set
[1:57:40] that is going to happen and the great
[1:57:44] eagle
[1:57:44] the prophet eagle that came in our
[1:57:46] generations took us out of all
[1:57:47] denominations
[1:57:48] churches to get us to christ to be in
[1:57:51] love with the word of god
[1:57:53] to get a bride that is without spot and
[1:57:56] it is without wrinkle
[1:58:00] how did peter say it anymore
[1:58:03] seeing that all the things shall be
[1:58:05] dissolved what man are persons
[1:58:07] are we to be in our holy conversation
[1:58:10] amen
[1:58:11] and godliness seeing that you see all
[1:58:15] these things see that you are
[1:58:17] spotless and without rebuke at the
[1:58:20] coming of the lord
[1:58:26] as a pastor brother i'm talking about a
[1:58:28] pastor that wants to get his church
[1:58:31] in the cleft of the rock get you to
[1:58:34] build your nest
[1:58:35] in the cleft of the rock how many knows
[1:58:37] jesus really is the cleft of he's the
[1:58:38] rock
[1:58:40] and the cleft of the rock is the cleft
[1:58:42] that he made right here
[1:58:43] our hope our faith our everything is in
[1:58:45] what jesus has done
[1:58:48] our faith is in jesus christ the
[1:58:49] revelation of jesus christ
[1:58:52] everybody needs a revelation of jesus
[1:58:55] christ
[1:58:56] don't trust in coming to this church to
[1:58:58] save you church can't do nothing for you
[1:59:00] it's as dirty as any denomination that's
[1:59:03] exactly right there's no cleanness
[1:59:05] in a church not zero not even a tablet
[1:59:09] only cleanliness that there is is
[1:59:12] in jesus christ
[1:59:15] amen how many knows this is why preacher
[1:59:18] will say now look
[1:59:19] how about we all focus on each other's
[1:59:20] faults we would be a busy busy busy busy
[1:59:22] people
[1:59:25] very busy because we all have faults you
[1:59:27] will have as long as you draw breath
[1:59:29] but in jesus christ there's perfection
[1:59:32] amen there's perfection in jesus christ
[1:59:36] and
[1:59:36] only in jesus christ
[1:59:40] so let's make our nest and our faith in
[1:59:43] the cleft of the rock
[1:59:44] i don't want you to get you just to a
[1:59:46] church i want to get you to christ
[1:59:49] i want you to have experiences with god
[1:59:51] okay i'm going to call those experiences
[1:59:53] with god revelations
[1:59:55] but says you know you take up the
[1:59:57] feather of the eagle
[1:59:58] the feather of the eagle you just can't
[2:00:00] hardly pull out you better get you a
[2:00:01] pair of pliers
[2:00:02] and lock down on it and pull your piece
[2:00:04] and put your legs on the body
[2:00:06] and to be able to pull those feathers
[2:00:07] out well that's about right because i'll
[2:00:09] tell you what those things that god gave
[2:00:11] us that wings of faith
[2:00:12] they've been planted i mean they have
[2:00:14] been planted in revelation of god
[2:00:17] and there's not just anybody that can
[2:00:19] pull that out of you
[2:00:20] just like david whenever he met goliath
[2:00:22] guess what he knew what he had done with
[2:00:24] that
[2:00:25] giant amen and that was his feathers and
[2:00:27] there was nobody going to tell him
[2:00:28] no david you can't do it no david that
[2:00:32] was just luck you got lucky with the
[2:00:34] line and the bit no
[2:00:35] not no i didn't just get lucky that was
[2:00:37] his
[2:00:39] feathers and nobody could pull it out
[2:00:41] and let me tell you when you have an
[2:00:42] experience with almighty god
[2:00:46] i'll tell you what how many beliefs
[2:00:47] salvation is really really important
[2:00:49] but when if god ever heals you brother
[2:00:51] stephen one time with anything
[2:00:53] he's able to do it again with whatever
[2:00:55] else
[2:00:56] we need to have build our faith amen
[2:00:59] that god is able to heal us
[2:01:01] because i can lay hands on you and i can
[2:01:02] put my faith in you now you if you truly
[2:01:04] believe
[2:01:05] that the elderly hands on the sticks
[2:01:07] they shall recover hey you could have it
[2:01:08] but it'll be according to your faith
[2:01:14] praise be to god higher ambitions
[2:01:17] i wrote down here
[2:01:21] we need to be have higher ambitions
[2:01:24] to better ourselves
[2:01:30] i don't know how honest how honest i
[2:01:32] should be here
[2:01:35] i know that sounds funny but
[2:01:38] the truth is sometimes when i think of
[2:01:40] myself
[2:01:41] being a pastor i'm like man you ought to
[2:01:43] let somebody else do it
[2:01:45] pastor you know
[2:01:48] because i want to what i want to be a
[2:01:50] better pastor
[2:01:52] when you think about your failures hello
[2:01:55] it saddens you makes you feel like
[2:01:58] you're not worthy
[2:02:00] you know that's right and i believe
[2:02:03] that's the way we all feel
[2:02:06] i think as a wife we could say that as a
[2:02:08] wife we could say that as a husband
[2:02:11] that i wish i was a better wife
[2:02:15] i wish i was a better husband amen
[2:02:18] for myself with my wife my wife
[2:02:22] you know i didn't treat her as good as i
[2:02:23] should have the earlier parts of our
[2:02:25] lives

[2:02:48] this i'm going to have a talk with him
[2:02:50] maybe i'll just have a consultation
[2:02:52] right here
[2:02:56] but when you marry a wife the bible says
[2:02:59] that your life is not just your own
[2:03:01] anymore it's your job
[2:03:03] to see how you can make her happy that's
[2:03:06] what the bible says
[2:03:07] the husband is to see how that he can
[2:03:09] please his wife
[2:03:10] amen and the wife the same way in that
[2:03:14] right
[2:03:14] she is to see how she can please your
[2:03:16] husband
[2:03:18] am i right that's what you're there for
[2:03:21] that's what how it's supposed to be if
[2:03:22] you want a happy marriage
[2:03:24] you want to make sure that you please
[2:03:25] one another live for each other
[2:03:28] amen praise the lord so

[2:15:59] this
[2:15:59] but stephen says since wednesday night
[2:16:02] i've had
[2:16:03] very little knee pain and i've slept
[2:16:04] like a baby
[2:16:06] he said i really feel good we want to
[2:16:08] just thank the lord for that and
[2:16:10] and then it says on her sister susan
[2:16:13] hershberger
[2:16:14] had a follow-up visit tuesday
[2:16:17] with her doctor he was very happy
[2:16:21] and this is the funny part he said go
[2:16:24] home
[2:16:24] and get you a bottle of wine and
[2:16:27] celebrate and enjoy life
[2:16:30] but you know what he didn't realize the
[2:16:32] wine on the inside the holy spirit
[2:16:35] that lives in god just and dwells within
[2:16:37] us and i just had to
[2:16:39] chuckle when i seen that and because you
[2:16:41] know they
[2:16:42] they probably don't understand or maybe
[2:16:44] their church lets them do that but
[2:16:46] hey man we're drinking from a heavenly
[2:16:48] wine this morning aren't you
[2:16:49] and i just just love him and
[2:16:53] you know i'm just thankful that he cares
[2:16:56] for us aren't you
[2:16:57] and god's been so good to us
[2:17:01] i just appreciate him this morning don't
[2:17:02] you and we appreciate each and every one
[2:17:05] we love you if there's ever anything we
[2:17:07] can do for you just call us
[2:17:10] no matter what time the night it is but
[2:17:11] you might not wake me up but you can try
[2:17:13] again
[2:17:14] but do our best to pray pray one for
[2:17:17] another
[2:17:19] because we all go through a battle and
[2:17:21] we all struggle
[2:17:22] but one thing for sure if you're
[2:17:25] if you're god's children you're not
[2:17:28] going to you're not going to go by the
[2:17:29] wayside
