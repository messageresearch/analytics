[2:45] [Music]
[3:19] Here
[3:48] we
[3:49] [Music]
[6:31] Good morning.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand.
[6:38] Children can be dismissed to Sunday
[6:40] school.
[6:45] Let's open our Bibles to Psalms 81.
[7:01] And brother Brad, would you open the
[7:03] service in a word of prayer?
[7:09] Just bow our hearts. Heavenly Father, we
[7:11] come before you this morning with
[7:12] grateful hearts, thankful to be in your
[7:14] house once again, Lord, and just to come
[7:16] and hear what you'd have in store for
[7:18] us. We we know that our pastors labored
[7:21] and and got himself prepared and ready,
[7:23] Lord Jesus. And we come prepared and
[7:25] ready to hear from you this morning,
[7:27] Lord. And we just want to invite your
[7:29] presence in our midst, Lord. That you
[7:30] would move amongst us, each and every
[7:32] one. Go through the aisles, Lord, and
[7:34] just speak to each and every heart
[7:36] that's here this morning. and that
[7:37] everything be said we pray Lord from the
[7:40] reading of the word, the Sunday schools,
[7:42] the songs that be sang just to bring
[7:44] honor and glory to you as we lift our
[7:46] voices with worship and praise. We just
[7:48] want to tell you we love you and give
[7:50] you all the glory and honor. In Jesus
[7:51] name we pray. Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. Sing aloud unto God our strength.
[7:59] Make a joyful noise unto the God of
[8:02] Jacob.
[8:09] Blow up the trumpet in the new moon in
[8:11] the time appointed on our solemn feast
[8:14] day.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; This he ordained in Joseph for a
[8:23] testimony when he went out through the
[8:25] land of Egypt where I heard a language
[8:28] that I understood not.
[8:36] Thou thou calledst me in trouble and I
[8:39] delivered thee. I answered thee in the
[8:42] secret place of thunder. I proved thee
[8:44] at the waters of Meba. Sila,
[8:54] &gt;&gt; there shall no strange god be in thee,
[8:57] neither shalt thou worship any strange
[9:00] god.
[9:09] But my people would not hearken to my
[9:11] voice and Israel would none of me.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; Oh that my people had hearkened unto me
[9:23] and Israel had walked in my ways.
[9:33] The haters of the Lord should have
[9:35] submitted themselves unto him, but their
[9:37] time should have endured forever. This
[9:39] one together. He should have fed them
[9:42] also with that finest of the wheat, and
[9:45] with honey out of the rock should I have
[9:47] satisfied thee. Amen. God bless you,
[9:51] brother Brian.
[9:55] Morning,
[10:09] brothers and sisters.
[10:12] Uh before I get started here, you can
[10:13] turn to Isaiah the 30th chapter. Uh
[10:18] what I I think it was two weeks ago told
[10:21] you I went ahead and everything's taken
[10:23] care of. The insurance is taken care of
[10:25] for the year. The prepaid is done on the
[10:28] propane and we do have a a summer fill.
[10:32] I made a small deposit yesterday. So
[10:35] that what I told you is true. The
[10:38] current amount in the general fund is
[10:41] about $10,400.
[10:44] uh
[10:46] the uh electric bills. I I've been
[10:48] checking our electric bills based on
[10:51] forget about the cost just on the
[10:52] wattage used and it's been consistent
[10:55] the last couple of years and you all
[10:57] know that your your electrical costs
[11:00] have gone up. So actually in the middle
[11:03] of the summer we probably had one of the
[11:05] highest bills we ever had in the last
[11:08] what almost 20 years. So it was about
[11:11] $800 and the last one was about 600. So
[11:14] as we go into the fall forward, we don't
[11:16] use the air conditioning a whole bunch.
[11:19] So the electrical bill won't be a lot of
[11:22] times it's no more than $2 to $400 a
[11:25] month. And we won't pay another propane
[11:29] bill
[11:31] as long as we have a normal winter.
[11:33] Probably I will do my first fill up in
[11:36] first couple of weeks of January.
[11:38] usually is when we start using the
[11:40] prepaid. But like I said, I know I say
[11:43] this a lot. Um,
[11:46] if you have any questions about how the
[11:48] money goes, don't be afraid to u ask me
[11:51] if you turn to the I was thinking of
[11:52] what you know, brother Phil said on
[11:55] Wednesday and then
[11:58] I hope I find the right place here.
[12:04] Let me find
[12:08] Yeah, go to the 21st verse. I was it was
[12:13] in one of the devotionals also and I was
[12:15] thinking and it goes actually to what he
[12:18] was saying on Wednesday night and and
[12:21] the verse says and thine ear shall hear
[12:23] a word from behind thee saying this is
[12:26] the way. So that voice is telling you
[12:29] this is the way. And as brother Phil was
[12:32] preaching to you all, you have to have
[12:34] that small still voice. The actual true
[12:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost like he was
[12:40] saying, it's not you doing it, but it's
[12:42] the spirit in you doing it for you. And
[12:44] then I'll read finish the scripture. Um
[12:48] I lost my place. This is the way walk
[12:51] you in it. and when you turn to the
[12:52] right hand and when you turn to the
[12:54] left. So that spiritual guide is there
[12:57] keeping you on that narrow path into
[13:01] glory this morning. That's that voice
[13:03] that's really important. It's the voice
[13:04] that takes the word of God and has it
[13:07] applied to your heart and your life
[13:09] every day, every hour and minute of your
[13:11] walk. And um I hope I don't lose my I
[13:14] was thinking this morning. I hope I find
[13:17] these notes correctly here this morning.
[13:20] Uh last couple of times I haven't
[13:24] I was telling you about that uh I was
[13:28] listening to brother Phil and
[13:31] finding if you get out there and you
[13:33] listen to where the world is at at this
[13:35] present time.
[13:38] It's like they've totally forgot about
[13:40] the dark ages. Totally forgot about what
[13:42] happened during the dark ages and what
[13:45] brought us the liberty that we have this
[13:47] morning. And I I was mentioning to you
[13:50] last week about Whitcliffe and he was
[13:54] trying to bring the church back to
[13:56] correctness in the 12th century. Uh and
[14:00] and what really struck me or there was a
[14:03] another person in in English society.
[14:05] This this was in 14 uh around 1412 to
[14:10] 1418.
[14:12] And this and it was a night his name was
[14:14] Sir John and he was a follower of
[14:16] Witcliffe
[14:18] and sometimes we forget what the church
[14:21] did to people and what they forced on
[14:23] people to believe and to do. And the
[14:26] people loved Sir John. They really loved
[14:28] this is this guy. But he believed
[14:31] Witcliffe and he followed the teachings
[14:33] of Witcliffe. And when I mention I'm
[14:36] about to mention another name and you
[14:38] wouldn't think this when I say King
[14:40] Henry V, you would see oh the battle of
[14:42] Argent Court defeated the French a great
[14:46] leader of English society. Well, it was
[14:48] also this same king that signed a law
[14:52] into effect through the parliament that
[14:54] if you prayed in your English language,
[14:57] the father's the father's prayer, if you
[15:01] read the scriptures in English and you
[15:04] taught the scriptures in English, that
[15:07] that was automatic execution. And I was
[15:10] just thinking, the world is just running
[15:12] after things that have no meaning
[15:14] anymore. And I I was noticing, like I
[15:16] said last week, that everyone forgets
[15:19] what we went through as a body of
[15:21] believers. But and what liberty God has
[15:24] given us in his word this morning, we're
[15:26] so willing to just surrender it all. And
[15:29] I I take it to one simple fact that the
[15:33] Protestant church out there, the church
[15:35] natural out there doesn't have the word
[15:37] of God anymore. You guys rub up against
[15:40] people that say they're Methodists, say
[15:42] they're Baptists, they say all the
[15:44] different denominations out, but you ask
[15:46] them a few few simple biblical questions
[15:50] where the scriptures are applied. And
[15:52] you know, they have no understanding in
[15:54] the word of God. And that's not their
[15:56] fault. Actually, it's the fault of their
[15:58] preachers not really teaching him the
[16:01] true word of God and presenting it to
[16:03] him in a correct way. And I was I was
[16:06] reading that scripture this morning. And
[16:07] if you would turn with me to uh
[16:09] Proverbs, I don't I'm going to say I
[16:12] won't say it. I know I say it a lot. I
[16:14] won't say what I was about to say. You
[16:17] know, one thing I learned
[16:20] being a military type of guy for my
[16:22] first job I ever had in life. What you
[16:25] know what people desire to see in you in
[16:27] your life? Can you guess what most
[16:29] important thing when people look at you?
[16:32] Whether you're a boss or a fellow
[16:34] worker, a pastor, a deacon, whatever you
[16:37] are in life, what's the most important
[16:39] thing people looking to see in your
[16:42] heart and life? And that word is
[16:44] consistency. They want to look at you
[16:46] and know that you're grounded in the
[16:48] word of God, grounded in truth. And when
[16:50] you say something today,
[16:53] it's the same thing you're going to say
[16:54] tomorrow. That's what people need to see
[16:56] in our hearts and lives this morning.
[16:58] That's what they need to see in our
[17:00] experience. No matter what happens in
[17:02] life, that you're consistent. You're
[17:04] walking day and night, day and night in
[17:08] the path that Christ sets before you.
[17:10] And they can see the consistency of the
[17:12] word of God, that you're not changing.
[17:14] You're firm in your beliefs in the word
[17:16] of God. That's what the world needs to
[17:18] see in us this morning. If you'll turn
[17:20] with me to Proverbs the 4th chapter and
[17:25] Sister Janette was listening to a
[17:27] message this morning and it it really
[17:29] struck me also. Um let me just read
[17:32] these scriptures here and then I'll sit
[17:34] down after a thought. I really don't
[17:37] have a lot to say. I said I wouldn't say
[17:39] that but I did. Let's start at about the
[17:41] fourth chapter of Proverbs.
[17:44] And like I've said before, you know,
[17:46] there's if you read a proverb every day,
[17:50] it would give you God's truth is
[17:52] unchanging. What Solomon saw in his
[17:56] century is the same in our century.
[17:58] People don't change. And I'll start at
[18:00] the 17th verse. For they for they eat
[18:03] the bread of wickedness and drink the
[18:04] wine of violence, but the path of the
[18:07] just is as a shining light that shineth
[18:10] more onto the perfect day. Goes with
[18:12] what I'm saying. It's the consistency
[18:15] when in your heart and in your life that
[18:17] people need to see. The way of the
[18:19] wicked is is as darkness. They know not
[18:22] what they stumble. My son, attend to my
[18:26] words. Incline thy ear onto my sayings.
[18:28] So Solomon's telling all his children,
[18:31] telling us also so many thousands of
[18:33] years later to listen to what he says in
[18:36] the word of God. Let them not depart
[18:38] thine eyes and keep them in the midst of
[18:40] thine heart. This goes all the way back
[18:42] to what Moses told the children of
[18:44] Israel. They were forever to put the
[18:46] word of God before them. Anywhere they
[18:49] went, anything they did, they were
[18:51] always supposed to put the word of God
[18:53] before them. For they they are life unto
[18:56] those that find them, and health to all
[18:58] their flesh. Keepeth the heart with all
[19:00] the diligence, for out of it are the
[19:04] issues of life.
[19:06] put away from thee a forward mouth and
[19:10] perverse lips put far from thee. And
[19:13] that I I know that true. That's the
[19:15] that's what's wrong in the age that we
[19:17] live. Everyone's got an opinion. Instead
[19:19] of just keeping keeping their opinion to
[19:21] themselves and just walking down the
[19:23] path of life, they want everyone else to
[19:25] know it. Let thine eyes look right on
[19:27] and let thine eyelids look straight
[19:29] before thee. And the and this is the one
[19:32] I was thinking about this morning. this
[19:34] 26 verse here, ponder the path of thy
[19:37] feet, let all thy ways be established.
[19:40] And that's really important and what I
[19:43] was saying in the beginning that you um
[19:46] that the the word of God I I said it
[19:49] last week and I I'll continually say it.
[19:52] You have to study the word of God like
[19:54] it says. You have to put it in your
[19:56] heart and in your life. Without the word
[19:59] of God, when you deal with that person
[20:00] out there, he might be the most
[20:02] intelligent person in the world. But if
[20:04] you put the word of God into your heart
[20:06] and you have the spirit of Christ, God
[20:08] will lead you to say the right thing at
[20:11] the right time. You're not responsible
[20:13] for that, but you are responsible to
[20:15] study God's word to believe be a
[20:18] believer in the baptism of the Holy
[20:20] Ghost. And I I've no sometimes people
[20:22] will be talking to me and out of nowhere
[20:24] I'll go right back to where God wants me
[20:27] to say something. It's not me, it's not
[20:29] you, but it's just God looking over his
[20:32] word and presenting it to people the way
[20:34] it's supposed to present it. And the
[20:37] thing that would really struck me, I
[20:40] said I'd quit, but
[20:43] brother Brandham was talking on that
[20:45] message. He was talking, you know,
[20:47] you'll get you'll mix up with certain
[20:50] believers that say, "Well, I believe the
[20:52] gospel if Jesus said it, or I'll believe
[20:55] the gospel if Peter said it." And I'll
[20:58] and you and I look at people like that
[21:00] and I say, "Well,
[21:02] uh, Peter said in Acts chapter 2, I
[21:06] don't need to say it to you. Peter said
[21:08] in Acts chapter two, you know, to be
[21:11] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[21:13] Christ." Have you fulfilled that
[21:15] requirement in your life? Are you been
[21:17] baptized in physical baptism in the name
[21:19] of Jesus Christ? What brother Brandham
[21:21] was really striking at whether you're a
[21:24] Catholic or you're a Protestant, are you
[21:26] fulfilling all the word of God in your
[21:28] life this morning, and I'll just finish
[21:31] with this thought if I don't ever say it
[21:33] too much. You really need to know your
[21:35] Bible. When you know your Bible and you
[21:38] know your message,
[21:40] you don't have to worry. God will tell
[21:42] you what you need to say at that time,
[21:44] what you need to know. He'll move you in
[21:46] the right way on what to say to the
[21:48] people that you deal with every day. And
[21:50] you I was just thinking the world, they
[21:53] have a lack the problem with the world
[21:55] this morning is there's a lack of
[21:57] biblical true biblical teaching. And the
[22:00] world is going into darkness because the
[22:03] they're not being taught right. They
[22:05] don't know no better. So you have to be
[22:07] ready to give them a word of wisdom in
[22:09] the time of need. Brother David,
[22:18] man, you love the Lord this morning.
[22:21] Amen. Let's stand if we could this
[22:23] morning and
[22:31] sing that little chorus. So glad I'm
[22:33] yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours this
[22:36] morning. Are you glad his mercy has
[22:39] found you this morning? Amen. Oh, so
[22:43] glad I'm yours, Lord.
[22:48] So glad
[22:50] I'm yours.
[22:52] Yes.
[22:54] So glad your mercy
[22:57] [Music]
[23:00] has followed me.
[23:05] So glad you found me
[23:11] and you set me free.
[23:16] So glad I'm yours,
[23:20] Lord.
[23:22] So glad I'm yours. Once again this
[23:26] morning.
[23:27] So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[23:33] So glad I'm yours.
[23:38] So glad your mercy,
[23:42] yes Lord, has followed me.
[23:47] [Music]
[23:49] So glad you found me
[23:55] and you set me free.
[23:59] [Music]
[24:01] So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[24:06] So glad I'm yours.
[24:10] [Music]
[24:11] And every day with Jesus.
[24:15] Oh, it's sweeter than the day before.
[24:20] And every day with Jesus.
[24:24] Oh, I love him more and more.
[24:28] Lord Jesus saves and keeps me. And he's
[24:33] the one I'm waiting for.
[24:37] And every day with Jesus, oh, it's
[24:42] sweeter. You believe that with all your
[24:44] heart this morning? Well, every day with
[24:48] Jesus, oh, it's sweeter than the day
[24:52] before.
[24:54] And every day with Jesus,
[24:58] oh, I love him more and more.
[25:03] Jesus saves and keeps me. And he's the
[25:07] one I'm waiting for.
[25:11] Oh, every day with Jesus
[25:15] is sweeter than the day before.
[25:19] Amen. You believe that with all of your
[25:21] heart? Amen. Let's sing that little
[25:24] chorus. And I I think I forgot to give
[25:27] this the words this. Do you all have the
[25:29] words of that little chorus? I sang
[25:30] never never never have I ever ever ever
[25:33] been so happy with my Lord. Let's sing
[25:35] that this morning. Well, never never
[25:40] have I ever ever ever been so happy
[25:44] happy in my Lord.
[25:49] Oh, never never never have I ever ever
[25:55] been so happy in my life before.
[26:01] Oh, he took away my sadness and he
[26:06] filled my heart with gladness and he
[26:09] gave me all that heaven can afford.
[26:14] Oh, never never never
[26:18] have I ever ever
[26:21] been so happy h happy in my Lord once
[26:25] again. Oh, and never never
[26:30] have I ever ever been so happy happy
[26:35] happy in my Lord.
[26:39] Oh, never never never have I ever ever
[26:45] been so happy in my life before.
[26:51] Well, he took away my sadness and he
[26:55] filled my heart with gladness and he
[26:59] gave me all that heaven could afford.
[27:02] [Music]
[27:04] Oh, and never never never have I ever
[27:09] ever ever been so happy happy happy in
[27:13] my Amen. Don't you love him this
[27:17] morning? Amen.
[27:20] Amen.
[27:22] Amen. Don't you want to see him this
[27:25] morning? Oh, I want to see him this
[27:27] morning. I want to look upon his face
[27:30] this morning. Amen.
[27:34] Well, as I journey through the land, oh,
[27:38] singing as I go. Yes, I'm pointing so to
[27:43] Calvary
[27:45] to the crimson floor.
[27:49] Many arrows pierce my soul from without.
[27:56] My Lord,
[27:59] through him I must see and know I want
[28:04] to see him. Just look upon his face
[28:10] there to sing forever
[28:14] of his son
[28:17] on the streets of glory. Oh, let me lift
[28:22] my voice with cares all fast. Home at
[28:26] last, ever to rejoice
[28:31] and wind in service for my Lord. Oh,
[28:34] dark baby.
[28:38] But I'll cling more close to him. For he
[28:42] has gi life.
[28:45] and Satan's snack may vex my soul, turn
[28:49] my thoughts aside,
[28:52] but my Lord leads me on.
[28:57] He died and oh, I want to see him. Look
[29:03] upon his face. Oh, I'm there to sing
[29:08] forever
[29:10] of his saving grace.
[29:13] And on the streets of glory,
[29:17] let me lift my voice. Hold my cares all
[29:21] fast. I'll be home at last. Ever to
[29:25] rejoice.
[29:27] And when in valleys low I look toward
[29:31] the mountain high.
[29:34] And behold my savior there. Oh, leading

[33:02] what? We're looking forward to what God
[33:03] has for us by today. Man, he's the same
[33:06] God. We just want to come hungry. And
[33:09] brother Thomas, he told us in the prayer
[33:11] room, he said he felt like he had
[33:13] something good. And I I didn't want to
[33:15] be rude. I started to tell him or say
[33:17] anything. I started to say, "Well, I've
[33:19] never heard you preach nothing bad. It's
[33:21] all been good." But the Lord's really
[33:23] laid something on his heart this
[33:24] morning. And how many with a great
[33:26] anticipation, amen, what God has to say
[33:29] for us this morning. And you know, if
[33:31] you come hungry, God will feed you.

[33:37] leave because I done a horrible job or
[33:39] Brother Thomas preached too long or
[33:42] whatever. But if you come hungry, you
[33:44] will be blessed this morning. and you'll
[33:46] leave here and your cup will be
[33:48] overflowing. And I ran into some friends
[33:50] of mine and they said, "How are you
[33:52] doing?" I said, "I'm doing great. No
[33:54] complaints." And the one guy driving, he
[33:57] looked over at me. He said, "You really
[33:59] don't have any complaints?" I said, "I
[34:02] really don't have any complaints
[34:04] because I've got go." He goes, "It's
[34:06] because you're a Christian, didn't it?"
[34:07] And I said, "That's exactly right. When
[34:10] Jesus Christ comes in your heart, we
[34:12] don't have nothing to complain about
[34:13] because we read the back of the book and
[34:15] guess what? We win. Amen. Amen. Fill my
[34:18] way every day with love this morning.
[34:20] And I pray these songs bless you.

[58:27] do and and our hearts, Father, is Lord,
[58:30] truly fulfilled, Father, where the
[58:32] prophet of God said God is in your
[58:34] heart. You can't hardly wait for those
[58:36] doors to open to get into the house of
[58:39] God. So Lord, we know that those who
[58:41] love you, Lord Jesus, love to go to the
[58:43] house of God and to hear your word, to
[58:44] feed on it, Lord Jesus. It feeds our
[58:47] soul, Lord Jesus, to hear your word, to
[58:49] read it, Father. And we just ask, God,
[58:51] that you'll look at every heart and
[58:53] every need this morning and meet those
[58:55] needs, Lord Jesus. We do ask God that
[58:58] this thought I feel like you've laid
[58:59] upon my heart to speak God if Lord that
[59:02] you would just take control of it Lord
[59:03] and say what you once said this morning.
[59:05] We ask it in Jesus name. Amen and amen.
[59:09] You can be seated for a minute. I do
[59:10] want to go over with you. Amen. I told
[59:13] you I would Wednesday about uh the
[59:16] presentation Brother Brad gave a couple
[59:18] months ago. Are we good? Yeah. Do that.
[59:21] Yeah.
