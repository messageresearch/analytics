[0:00] See, the devil knows that if the people
[0:02] get a true revelation of the true
[0:04] church, what she is, what she stands
[0:08] for, and that she can do the greater
[0:11] works, she will be an invincible army.
[0:17] Amen.
[0:20] She says, "If they get a true revelation
[0:22] of the two spirits within the framework
[0:24] of the Christian church and by God's
[0:26] spirit discern and withstand the
[0:28] Antichrist spirit, Satan will be
[0:31] powerless before her." I like that
[0:34] phrase that the devil will be powerless
[0:37] before you.
[0:39] I thought of that when I wrote this
[0:41] down. And I said, "Lord, let that be.
[0:43] Lord, let it be to me that the devil
[0:47] would be powerless
[0:50] in your life."
[0:53] That means jealousy,
[0:55] uh, lust, sin, uh, temptation, uh,
[1:01] hatred, malice, all those things, you're
[1:04] above it.
[1:08] Amen. Because those are all things of
[1:09] the devil.
[1:11] bitterness, hatred, all of that. That's
[1:13] all of the devil
[1:16] to be have the t power the devil to be
[1:18] powerless
[1:21] cuz he's got to have somebody to work
[1:22] through.
[1:25] Satan will be powerless before her. He
[1:28] will be as definitely thwarted today as
[1:29] when Christ withtood his every effort to
[1:31] gain power over him in the desert. See,
[1:34] Satan hates revelation. We love it. with
[1:37] true revelation in our lives. The gates
[1:39] of hell will not prevail against us, but
[1:44] we will prevail over them.
[1:49] Amen. How many is glad to prevail over
[1:52] the devil?
[1:55] Be an overcomer.
[1:59] Oh, there's a big difference between an
[2:01] overcomer and somebody just says he's an
[2:04] overcomer.
[2:06] Cuz if you're not really a overcomer,
[2:09] you still feel the agony of defeat in
[2:12] your heart.
[2:14] You still don't have that freedom.
[2:17] You ain't got that liberty. You don't
[2:19] have that joy.
