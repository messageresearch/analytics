[20:13] Psalms 27 this morning.
[20:22] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[20:24] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[20:27] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[20:29] afraid?
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Though in host should encamp against me,
[20:41] my heart shall not fear. Though war
[20:43] should rise against me, in this will I
[20:45] be confident.
[21:00] For in the time of trouble he shall hide
[21:03] me in his pavilion. In the secret of his
[21:06] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[21:08] set me up upon a rock.
[21:25] here. O Lord, when I cry with my voice,
[21:28] have mercy also upon me and answer me.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Hide not thy face far from me. Put not
[21:41] thy servant away in anger. Thou hast
[21:44] been my whole sorry here. Thou has been
[21:46] my help. Leave me not neither forsake
[21:49] me, oh God of my salvation.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in
[22:00] the plain path because of mine enemies.
[22:12] I had fainted unless I had believed to
[22:14] see the goodness of the Lord in the land
[22:16] of the living. Wait on the Lord. Be of
[22:19] good courage and he shall strengthen
[22:21] thine heart. Wait, I say on the Lord.
[22:24] God bless you.
[22:34] There are some things
[22:38] I may not know. [singing]
[22:43] There are some places
[22:46] I
[22:48] can't go.
[22:51] But I am [music] sure
[22:55] of this one thing [singing]
[22:59] that God is real [music]
[23:02] for I can feel him deep within.
[23:04] [singing]
[23:07] Oh my God is real. [singing]
[23:12] He's real in my soul.
[23:16] My God is real. For he has washed and

[23:28] is like pure gold. [singing]

[23:41] Some folk [music] may doubt.
[23:45] Some folk may scorn. Lord, [singing]
[23:49] all can [music]
[23:50] go on and leave me alone. [music]
[23:57] But as for me,
[24:01] I'll take [music and singing] God's part
[24:05] and God is real. [music]

[24:38] My God is [music] real for I can feel
[24:42] him in [singing] my soul. [music]
[24:47] I cannot tell
[24:51] just how I felt [singing]
[24:55] when [music] Jesus took

[26:33] who's living [music and singing]
[26:35] in me.

[26:43] on history,
[26:45] see the mighty God
[26:48] unveiled,
[26:51] proving [singing] over and over
[26:55] that his word can never fail.
[27:00] But I [music] can't [singing]
[27:02] keep on dwelling
[27:05] on some past memorories.

[27:15] who's living
[27:17] in me. [singing and music]

[41:35] the [singing] arms of God.
[41:40] and he walks with me
[41:45] and not of earth can harm me
[41:54] for I'm sheltered
[41:58] [singing] in the arms of God.
[42:04] [singing]
[42:05] And I feel the touch
[42:10] of hands so kind and tender.
[42:17] And they're leading [music and singing]
[42:20] me
[42:22] in path that I must draw.
[42:29] And I'll [singing and music] have no
[42:32] fear
[42:34] for Jesus [music and singing]
[42:37] walks beside me.
[42:42] For I'm sheltered [singing]
[42:47] in the arms of God.
[42:53] And so let the [singing] storms rage
[42:57] high.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:02] &gt;&gt; And they won't wor me
[43:06] for [singing] I'm sheltered [music] safe
[43:11] within the arms of God. [singing]
[43:17] [music]
[43:17] And he who walks with me
[43:22] and not [singing]
[43:24] of earth shall harm me
[43:30] for I'm sheltered
[43:34] in the arms of God.
[43:41] And soon I shall hear
[43:46] the call from heaven's
[43:50] portals.
[43:53] Come home [singing] my child.
[43:57] It's the last mile you must [music]
[44:01] draw.
[44:04] and I shall be [music and singing]
[44:07] changed
[44:09] and taken to God's new heaven
[44:16] forever [music]
[44:17] [singing] sheltered
[44:20] in the arms of God.
[44:26] And so let the [singing] storms rage
[44:31] high. The dark clouds rise. They don't
[44:36] wory [singing and music]
[44:38] me
[44:39] for I'm sheltered [singing and music]
[44:42] safe within the arms of God. [singing]
[44:48] [music]
[44:50] And he walks with me.
[44:55] And not of earth can harm me
[45:02] for [singing and music] I'm sheltered
[45:07] in the arms of God. [singing]
[45:14] Amen. Let's stand this morning. We're

[47:31] [music]
[47:34] our Jesus.

[47:54] Amen. Good morning.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[47:58] Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated
[48:01] this morning. Let's sing. I do our
[48:03] anniversaries and birthdays. So,
[48:05] everybody that has a birthday, if you
[48:07] want to come up at this time. Amen.

[48:15] would be one of them. One of them.
[48:18] Amen.
[48:19] Amen.

[48:56] Praise the Lord. Anybody get married in
[48:59] January?
[49:01] Amen. Do we have any weddings in
[49:03] January?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Nope. All right. Amen. Um I guess that's
[49:13] all for the music then. Amen. Let's
[49:16] stand once again. We have a prayer
[49:17] request here that we want to bring
[49:19] before the Lord and that is uh one of
[49:22] brother Joe and Hannah's workers named
[49:24] Justin Diesson, 38 years old. Tomorrow
[49:29] morning at 8 o'clock, we'll be having
[49:31] triple bypass
[49:33] heart surgery in Louisville Hospital.
[49:35] That's eight o'clock in the morning. So,
[49:38] we do want to remember him. Amen. In
[49:40] prayer. Amen. So, let's just bow our
[49:43] heads this morning. Lord Jesus, first of
[49:47] all, we want to come and bring this
[49:49] brother.
[49:50] Don't know if he's saved or not, but if
[49:52] he's not, we ask God that you would do a
[49:54] work in his life, Lord. And first of
[49:56] all, save his soul. for Father, we know
[49:58] that would be an eternal work, Lord
[50:01] Jesus. So we pray for him, God, that if
[50:04] he doesn't know you, Lord Jesus, that
[50:05] you'll go into his room, Lord, where he
[50:07] is and reveal yourself to him, Lord
[50:09] Jesus. May he know the power of God and
[50:11] the sweetness of the spirit, Lord Jesus.
[50:14] And also for his body, Lord, his heart,
[50:16] those arteries that are clogged, that
[50:18] they have to bypass, God. We would ask,
[50:20] Lord Jesus, that you would really do a
[50:22] special work. And may he know that
[50:24] there's [clears throat] a God in heaven
[50:25] because of how smooth things have went,
[50:27] Lord Jesus. How good that you are. And
[50:29] we ask God for mercy for him, Lord
[50:31] Jesus. That you'd be in the doctor's
[50:33] hands, Lord Jesus, and be in every cut,
[50:36] Lord, and everything that they do,
[50:37] Father. We ask, God, you'd watch over
[50:39] him and bless him, and to be able to
[50:41] have a good heart again, Lord Jesus, and
[50:43] be able to live his life, Father, Lord.
[50:46] And we ask, God, that you'd just show a
[50:47] special mercy upon him. And then Lord,
[50:50] we kind of want to look at father our
[50:53] two 2025 Lord and the year that has
[50:58] passed Lord Jesus we would ask Lord
[51:01] Jesus that Father any failures any sins
[51:04] any any shortcomings that we've had in
[51:07] that year Lord Jesus that it be put
[51:09] under the blood of Jesus Christ Father
[51:12] so that we could start the 2026 out new
[51:14] and fresh Lord and and Lord be able to
[51:18] Father say that we victory in you, Lord
[51:20] Jesus, and so to speak, have a clean
[51:22] slate, Father, to start over again,
[51:24] Lord, and to live for you, Lord. And
[51:27] Father, we want to thank you, Lord, for
[51:29] all that you have done for us in 25. The
[51:31] revelations that you've brought, Lord,
[51:34] the food that you've fed us, Lord Jesus,
[51:36] that we've gotten to eat, the closer
[51:37] that we've gotten with you and to you,
[51:39] Lord, and the work that you've done in
[51:41] our lives, Lord Jesus, working on us,
[51:43] Father, preparing us, getting us ready,
[51:46] Lord, for what lays ahead, Lord. And
[51:48] Lord, now Father, we put 25 behind us,
[51:51] Lord Jesus. And we put it, Father, in
[51:53] history books, so to speak, Lord. But
[51:56] Lord, there's a new year coming up, Lord
[51:58] Jesus. And it's brand new, Lord. And
[52:01] every move that we make, Lord Jesus. We
[52:03] just pray, Father, that you'd help us in
[52:05] every thought that we think, Lord, give
[52:07] us greater revelation. Give us deeper
[52:09] revelation of yourself, Father, so that
[52:12] we might have victory, Lord Jesus. For
[52:13] we realize God that it's through
[52:16] revelation that we can defeat the devil,
[52:18] Lord Jesus. And it gives us that rock
[52:20] that overcomes the enemy and the gates
[52:22] of hell cannot prevail against it, Lord.
[52:25] So we ask God that you would take us
[52:27] much further than what we went in 25.
[52:30] And we ask God that as we try to
[52:32] minister, Lord, that you would just
[52:33] bless us, Lord Jesus, being able to get
[52:35] out of the way. And then Brother Brad
[52:37] tonight as he brings the word, Father,
[52:38] help him to get out of the way. And
[52:40] Lord, feed your sheep, Lord, what you
[52:42] want us to feed on today. And say what
[52:44] you once said. Have your divine will
[52:46] done, Lord Jesus, in our lives. And we
[52:49] thank you now, Father, for all the
[52:51] healing that you done, all the
[52:52] deliverance that you've done, and all
[52:54] that you have done, Father. And Lord, we
[52:56] ask God for your guidance now in Jesus
[52:59] name. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord.
[53:04] Amen. Just devil was trying to put a
[53:07] little bit of a sore throat on me for
[53:08] some reason this morning. So, amen. But
[53:11] I don't really feel sick or anything,
[53:12] but I just Amen. That sore throat is
[53:14] just not quite the way that it's
[53:16] supposed to be. Amen. So, y'all pray for
[53:18] me. Amen. This morning. Amen. We want to
[53:23] go till about what time is it now? 10
[53:25] after 11. Amen. So, we'll try to go
[53:29] about maybe 10 after 12 or something
[53:31] like that. Maybe preach for an hour and
[53:33] then we want to have our communion.
[53:36] Amen. and us and and so communion and
[53:40] fellowship and then this evening
[53:41] service. We're looking forward to it
[53:43] this year. Amen. I I usually sometimes
[53:45] as far as the voting and so forth. Amen.
[53:48] U sometimes it goes plum to March almost
[53:50] before we ever get it done. So I'm
[53:53] trying to do better. Amen. I like to do
[53:55] it pretty much at the beginning of the
[53:57] year and so about Thursday I says I'm
[53:59] going to get grace to get them drawed up
[54:01] so that we can do it at the first of the
[54:02] year. Amen. Amen. So, we'll try to get
[54:05] that out of the way. Amen. We have a few
[54:08] new ones on there. Amen. As you probably
[54:10] say, seen with brother Mike and brother
[54:12] Austin and then sister Debbie, I think.
[54:15] Amen. For Sunday school class. Amen. And
[54:17] so, we're still short one. Amen. So, be
[54:19] we'll be praying about getting that
[54:21] filled here in the near future. Amen.
[54:24] Praise the Lord.
[54:26] Is everybody all right?
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, all right. Let's see what
[54:32] the Lord will have for us today. Amen.
[54:34] It's kind of again a little bit another
[54:37] uh extension of what we've been speaking
[54:40] on. Amen. About the father's business.
[54:44] Amen. Uh but there's about two or three
[54:48] different areas that I haven't really
[54:50] touched on. And so uh we just want to
[54:53] see what which way the Lord wants us to
[54:55] go uh this morning. And so I titled it I
[55:01] think I don't know if it's got that
[55:03] title up there
[55:06] or not
[55:08] the God's house. Amen. God is building a
[55:12] house. Amen. Amen. Or should we call a
[55:15] home. And so we want to look at that
[55:17] with the help of the Lord for a little
[55:18] while this morning. Let's turn our
[55:21] Bibles if you will. And before I get
[55:24] started on the main subject, I want to
[55:27] just maybe touch a little bit on uh just
[55:31] a little bit of the new year, coming
[55:32] into the new year and and make a couple
[55:35] comments maybe. Uh so if you will go to
[55:38] Philippians 3, we'll start with
[55:40] Philippians 3. Amen. And read a couple
[55:42] scriptures. Amen.
[55:46] And this would be Paul's Paul his
[55:51] attitude. Paul's attitude, amen, towards
[55:55] what is past and the future. And then
[55:58] also we'll read a scripture, amen, of
[56:02] Paul's departure. Amen. Paul's departure
[56:05] and how he was at the end. Amen. And
[56:09] hopefully by God's grace, we can have
[56:12] the same kind of a testimony that Paul
[56:15] did in Philippians 3.
[56:21] In verse 12, Paul says,"Not as though I
[56:24] had already attained."
[56:27] In other words, I haven't gotten there
[56:28] yet. How many can say that? We haven't
[56:32] gotten there yet.
[56:37] Neither were already perfect.
[56:41] Amen. Some Paul must have desired
[56:44] perfection.
[56:46] How many desires perfection?
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hate imperfection.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hate it. We're striving for it.
[56:56] Amen.
[56:59] But I follow after. Amen. If that I may
[57:04] apprehend that for which I am also
[57:07] apprehended in Christ Jesus. Brethren, I
[57:11] count not myself to have apprehended,
[57:13] but this one thing I do, forgetting
[57:16] those things which are behind,
[57:19] and reaching forth unto those things
[57:22] which are before.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that?
[57:27] &gt;&gt; That ought to get us just a little
[57:28] excited.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; We're not worried about the past and
[57:31] we're not worried about 2025
[57:35] &gt;&gt; or any any of history at all. We are
[57:39] focused on the future.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; We are looking ahead.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's that got that attitude?
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Let us therefore as many as
[57:51] be perfect be thus minded." Over in
[57:54] second Timothy 4, when Paul come down to
[57:57] the end of the road, he says, "For I am
[57:59] now ready to be offered." Chapter 4 of
[58:02] Second Timothy. Uh for I am now ready to
[58:05] be offered and the time of my departure
[58:08] is at hand.
[58:10] May this be our testimony. I have fought
[58:12] a good fight.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; It's a little bit quiet in here this
[58:21] morning, brother.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; But man, have you fought a good fight?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; It's been a fight, ain't it?
[58:27] &gt;&gt; It's been a battle.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; How many in here knows this? what the
[58:32] Bible talk. You know, I've fought a good
[58:34] fight.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; I have f had to fight through doubt,
[58:38] through frustration, through all kinds
[58:40] of stuff. Is there anybody in the house
[58:43] that's had to fight?
[58:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to be quite as quiet. We
[58:50] should know what that word that resounds
[58:52] to us. That's right. I know what it's
[58:54] like.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; I've had to fight for my ground.
[59:02] me, Brad. A lot of y'all wouldn't be
[59:04] standing here if it wouldn't be for you
[59:06] having put up a real good fight
[59:09] &gt;&gt; battle. Amen. For what's yours.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I have fought a good fight.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; I have finished my course."
[59:17] Would to God, Lord Jesus, help us all to
[59:20] be able to say that on our deathbed.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; I fought a good fight. I have finished
[59:25] my course.
[59:27] I have kept the faith.
[59:32] [cheering]
[59:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. I've kept the faith. How
[59:36] many's kept the faith? We're still here
[59:38] in 2026.
[59:40] Amen. So, you must have kept something.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; You're still here.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And those that aren't can't even
[59:48] hear this this morning. There's a lot
[59:50] that ain't
[59:52] &gt;&gt; But praise be to God. If you can hear
[59:55] that, this hear this this morning, you
[59:57] ought to rejoice. Amen.
[1:00:01] Henceforth,
[1:00:03] I don't know what henceforth means, but
[1:00:05] I would imagine it means something in
[1:00:07] the future. From here on, henceforth,
[1:00:12] right? From here on there is laid up for
[1:00:16] me a crown of righteousness,
[1:00:20] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[1:00:24] give me at that day. And not me only,
[1:00:27] but unto all them also that love his
[1:00:31] appearing. You can be seated this
[1:00:34] morning if you want to be. You want to
[1:00:37] stand with me and how shouting
[1:00:38] hallelujah? I'd be all right then.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. and it don't bother me when you
[1:00:43] get up,
[1:00:45] you know, get into it.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; But here, think about it. That love is
[1:00:51] appearing.
[1:00:56] Brother Brandham kept talking about the
[1:00:58] Lord is fixing to come. The Lord is
[1:00:59] fixing to come. And somebody said, "Man,
[1:01:02] you scared of people when you say that.
[1:01:06] It's scary when you tell them it's about
[1:01:08] the end time and the Lord's going to
[1:01:10] come." And they know some some people
[1:01:12] kind of got scared about that. But Paul
[1:01:14] said here, you know, you ought to be
[1:01:16] scared about it. You ought to love his
[1:01:19] appearing. You're looking forward to it.
[1:01:20] And brother Bam couldn't understand.
[1:01:22] What do you mean? It ought to give you
[1:01:24] great joy to know that he's coming, not
[1:01:27] scare you.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:34] Amen.
[1:01:35] So, I have a very, very
[1:01:40] technical question to ask you guys this
[1:01:42] morning.
[1:01:45] There's a phrase that says that
[1:01:48] you can't change the past.
[1:01:51] Is that true?
[1:01:53] I told you it was a very technical
[1:01:55] question and the answer is
[1:01:59] yeah, you can't change the past.
[1:02:10] Yeah, you can.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we just did
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; about five minutes ago. We changed the
[1:02:20] past.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; What? See, the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:02:33] powerful enough to take all of your sins
[1:02:36] of 25 and put them in the sea of
[1:02:39] forgetfulness.
[1:02:41] [applause]
[1:02:43] That's right.
[1:02:45] God can change your past.
[1:02:50] Woo! Every bad thing you do, you're
[1:02:54] going to remember, "Oh man, I
[1:02:55] [screaming] should have done this. I
[1:02:56] didn't do this. I didn't do that." But
[1:02:58] guess what? If you ask God to genuinely
[1:03:00] forgive you, it goes in his sea of
[1:03:03] forgetfulness. God don't remember it
[1:03:05] anymore. God takes an eraser and he
[1:03:08] erases it.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; That don't do something for you.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; I ain't gonna say drink a beer.
[1:03:21] No, that should do something for you.
[1:03:25] I think brother uh who was it?
[1:03:32] But anyway, the preachers, some
[1:03:34] preachers would say, you know, that
[1:03:35] ought to make a Baptist shout.
[1:03:38] It ought to make a message believer
[1:03:39] shout
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; to know that God will take that Amen.
[1:03:42] and annihilate it.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; As long as there's mercy, as long as
[1:03:48] he's on that throne.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; And folks, I want to tell you something.
[1:03:53] You might backslide a h 100 times. You
[1:03:55] might backslide. You might not be what
[1:03:57] you ought to be. But if you genuinely
[1:03:59] repent, amen. Jesus told us to forgive
[1:04:01] each other 570 times a day. I want you
[1:04:04] to know there's grace for you. God will
[1:04:06] forgive you if you really mean it.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; So don't stay down in 2026. Get back up
[1:04:13] and go. [screaming] The blood is
[1:04:15] powerful enough to do that.
[1:04:17] [applause and cheering]
[1:04:20] Boy, that ought to do something for
[1:04:21] somebody that is truly trying to
[1:04:23] overcome something.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Hello. It fails and fails. I want you to
[1:04:27] understand you get back up and you mean
[1:04:29] it with all your heart. Got to do it.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; How do you know, brother Ba? Cuz I've
[1:04:34] done it. I know what that's all about. I
[1:04:37] know what it's like to [screaming] fail.
[1:04:38] And I know what it's like to genuinely
[1:04:40] say, "God, forgive me. I didn't mean
[1:04:42] to." Amen. And God will forgive. Amen.
[1:04:45] This day, this scripture is fulfilled
[1:04:47] for me.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is gracious.
[1:04:55] [sighs]
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. I was thinking about that.
[1:05:00] The past. Well, you can't change the
[1:05:04] past. And I don't know about you, but I
[1:05:06] think it was the Holy Spirit give me
[1:05:07] that revelation.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Some said, "Yeah, it can.
[1:05:14] All your sins can be erased.
[1:05:17] All your failures, put in the sea of
[1:05:19] God's forgetfulness. As a matter of
[1:05:21] fact, you ought to do it every night
[1:05:23] before you go to sleep. Say, "God,
[1:05:25] forgive me for my sins today."
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; For things I don't even realize.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; I like to say, "God, if I don't wake up
[1:05:35] tomorrow, I just want to make sure that
[1:05:37] all is well."
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I die in my sleep, Amen. God, I
[1:05:43] want to know that when I come up on the
[1:05:45] other side, it's all taken care of.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; But I want to say we're pressing to the
[1:05:58] future, aren't we?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; We're pressing somewhere. My message
[1:06:03] this morning is towards in that
[1:06:06] direction and where we're going,
[1:06:09] what we're pushing for.
[1:06:12] Sometimes in the past I've taken themes
[1:06:14] for the year. Our theme for the year.
[1:06:18] Well, I doubt that it's going to be the
[1:06:20] theme for all year. I can't do one that
[1:06:22] long. But for the beginning of the year
[1:06:25] here,
[1:06:27] our theme's going to be on character.
[1:06:29] Amen. On character.
[1:06:33] Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Cuz guess what? How many believe that
[1:06:39] we're getting close?
[1:06:42] We're getting close.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; We're getting close to going home to the
[1:06:48] house that God has built us.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; How many believe God is there now
[1:06:56] building you a house?
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's a builder.
[1:07:03] He's a divine architect. Brother Bham
[1:07:06] called it in the future home.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Divine architect. He's building us a
[1:07:10] home to go to.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Let me paint you a little picture.
[1:07:22] Not that kind of picture.
[1:07:25] God
[1:07:28] after he created he a few angels so that
[1:07:31] he could be worshiped.
[1:07:34] He created saraphims. created angels
[1:07:37] that have six wings. Ain't that right?
[1:07:40] And they're there day and night and
[1:07:42] their wings are going like this,
[1:07:45] covering their feet, two flying, two
[1:07:48] covering their face. Ain't that right?
[1:07:51] Amen. And day and night they cry, "Holy,
[1:07:54] holy, holy, holy unto the Lord."
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Before God could be God, he created
[1:08:01] angels to worship him. Amen. Jesus said
[1:08:04] that he could call 72,000
[1:08:08] angels
[1:08:10] to come and change the scene. So, we
[1:08:12] know that there's actually at least
[1:08:15] 72,000. And how many more? I don't know.
[1:08:19] But how many believe God is over there?
[1:08:21] He's being worshiped. The hosts of
[1:08:24] heaven are over there. And they've been
[1:08:26] with God for ceaseless ages. I don't
[1:08:29] know how long it's been, but since the
[1:08:31] time that they were created, they're in
[1:08:33] that beautiful, beautiful place
[1:08:35] worshiping God. And here you
[1:08:37] [clears throat] and I are, amen, just
[1:08:39] imagining.
[1:08:41] Amen. How it is over there. But I want
[1:08:44] you to know something this morning. One
[1:08:46] of these days, we're not going to be
[1:08:48] imagining because God has come down and
[1:08:51] redeemed you. And you're going to be
[1:08:53] with God, praising him, worship him, him
[1:08:56] for the ceaseless ages that is to
[1:08:58] [screaming] come.
[1:09:00] That is our hope. Here we are in dark
[1:09:03] world of humanity and Amen. And struggle
[1:09:05] and strife. Amen. In a body that keeps
[1:09:08] us down. But one of these days, folks,
[1:09:10] amen, they're not going to be the only
[1:09:12] ones that's over there. All the hosts of
[1:09:14] the redeemed are going to be there.
[1:09:17] And we're going to worship God through
[1:09:19] the endless
[1:09:21] eternity.
[1:09:22] I would say ceaseless ages, but there's
[1:09:24] no ages. It's a ceaseless eternity.
[1:09:30] That's why we come to church in the
[1:09:32] morning. That's why we worship God.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] Because we look forward to seeing him.
[1:09:42] Amen. being with him, praising him, the
[1:09:47] angels,
[1:09:52] you know,
[1:09:57] you got more authority,
[1:10:00] more power than the angels.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:10:08] I don't know if it's right to say this
[1:10:09] or not, but I'm going to say it. Perhaps
[1:10:11] God thinks more of you than he does the
[1:10:13] angels.
[1:10:17] Angel is a servant.
[1:10:19] Which one do you think the most of? Your
[1:10:22] servant,
[1:10:24] your granddaughter, your son, or your
[1:10:26] daughter
[1:10:28] or a servant?
[1:10:30] Most likely going to be your children.
[1:10:33] Amen.
[1:10:36] which I know we all know God loves them
[1:10:38] all, but you have a very special place.
[1:10:43] You are a very special person. How many
[1:10:47] believe you're a very special person?
[1:10:49] You've been called out
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; to the evening time light. Called out of
[1:10:54] darkness.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Rise and shine for thy light has
[1:10:59] come.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:11:05] Now, as we think about God's house, God
[1:11:09] is building his house.
[1:11:16] I call it
[1:11:18] what some people would call the American
[1:11:20] dream.
[1:11:24] Martin Luther, they said, had a dream,
[1:11:28] right? where everybody could ride the
[1:11:30] bus the same as everybody else and have
[1:11:33] equal rights. And that was kind of his
[1:11:35] dream.
[1:11:37] The American dream would say, "Well, we
[1:11:39] went nice and have a nice home, nice
[1:11:42] house with a white picket fence up
[1:11:44] there, maybe a dog out there in the dog
[1:11:47] house."
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Just the American dream. Good job, good
[1:11:53] finances, well taken care of, a good
[1:11:56] business.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:00] But more than that, Amen. It would be to
[1:12:03] have a good mate,
[1:12:06] to have a wife or a husband.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And perhaps to have two or three
[1:12:14] children.
[1:12:16] Hello.
[1:12:17] Being able to take him to the dentist,
[1:12:19] being able to take him care of him.
[1:12:22] American dream.
[1:12:28] Well, how many believes that God has a
[1:12:31] dream?
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; God has a dream.
[1:12:35] But Abraham said one place he said God
[1:12:37] had an idea. He began to think.
[1:12:41] He says, "Herein is set forth the love
[1:12:44] of God." See, God desired
[1:12:47] in love family of his own,
[1:12:51] a family of sons like himself.
[1:12:55] Now I'm going to put in their daughters.
[1:12:58] Amen. Sons and daughters.
[1:13:01] Here lie before him all of mankind lump
[1:13:05] of clay. Out of the same lump he will
[1:13:08] not make.
[1:13:10] The choosing will be his own choosing.
[1:13:15] How many believes that when God chose
[1:13:17] you, he chose you before you chose him?
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; He chose you before the foundation of
[1:13:24] the world. Jesus said, "You didn't
[1:13:26] choose me. I chose [screaming] you."
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; But if somebody wants to tell you you're
[1:13:31] not a son of God, you just tell them,
[1:13:33] "I'm sorry, but God chose me." You talk
[1:13:36] to him. [applause]
[1:13:38] [cheering]
[1:13:39] You talk to him. He's the one that did
[1:13:41] the choosing.
[1:13:44] He has the key of David. He opens the
[1:13:46] door and and no man can shut it. And
[1:13:49] shuts it and nobody can open it. How
[1:13:52] many believes God opens doors in your
[1:13:54] life? He shuts doors in your life. If
[1:13:56] you're ever going to get delivered, if
[1:13:58] you're ever going to get anything, it's
[1:13:59] God that does it.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. His own choosing.
[1:14:09] Amen.
[1:14:11] And then those chosen ones
[1:14:14] born of his spirit
[1:14:16] will be trained to conform to the image
[1:14:19] of his in the uh his image in their
[1:14:23] walk.
[1:14:25] He proves with reproves with all
[1:14:27] longsuffering and gentleness and mercy.
[1:14:30] He chasens with nail scar hands.
[1:14:33] Amen. Remember the story I told you
[1:14:36] about
[1:14:38] [sighs]
[1:14:38] if somebody built your house when you
[1:14:40] leave, you go to Florida, come back and
[1:14:42] say you my house is done and he built
[1:14:44] you a house [snorts] and and you had
[1:14:47] given him a blueprint and guess what?
[1:14:49] The bay window was in the bedroom
[1:14:50] instead of the kitchen. The back porch
[1:14:52] was only half the size and he decided to
[1:14:55] make some screened in porch or whatever.
[1:14:57] How upset you'd be. How you'd say,
[1:15:00] "Look, tear this thing down and do it
[1:15:02] right.
[1:15:04] I don't care what your idea is.
[1:15:07] Hello. [screaming] I don't know if
[1:15:09] anybody listening out there, but you
[1:15:11] want to have a church, man. You have to
[1:15:13] go to the a construction class for 6
[1:15:16] months and then we'll baptize you or
[1:15:19] shake your hand and take you into this
[1:15:20] church and all of your man-made ideas
[1:15:24] has to be torn down. It's going to burn.
[1:15:27] It's going to be burnt.
[1:15:31] We built it the way this book says. Oh,
[1:15:34] we don't get it. Build it all.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me just go back a page. How many
[1:15:39] believe that we are, Amen, in an
[1:15:41] absolute masterpiece ministry?
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; This ministry that come, it's going to
[1:15:46] take us somewhere. It's going to bring
[1:15:48] us to perfection. It's going to have a
[1:15:50] [screaming] bride without spot, without
[1:15:52] wrinkle.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; We'll get to that in a minute.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:01] That's right. Because he's looking for a
[1:16:05] bride. He's looking for a church. Now,
[1:16:08] his bride is not just
[1:16:11] one person.
[1:16:13] How many his bride is not just one
[1:16:16] person's? It's a many membered bride.
[1:16:26] And
[1:16:29] just as brother Brandon I'll go ahead as
[1:16:31] brother Brand preached on
[1:16:34] the choosing of a bride. Isn't that
[1:16:36] right? And he says, you know,
[1:16:40] if one of our young boys here in the
[1:16:42] church goes out there and world marries
[1:16:44] a worldly girl and short hair, pants,
[1:16:49] lipstick, Jezebel
[1:16:52] or whatever it might be. He said it
[1:16:54] would show his character.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; It would show what he's made out of.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; How many knows God is not going to pick
[1:17:05] a what? somebody like that. He's not
[1:17:07] going to choose somebody like that.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; If a boy
[1:17:20] chooses a girl, she may be beautiful as
[1:17:23] all can be. She may be a message
[1:17:26] believer. She may try wear her dresses
[1:17:29] and and not cut her hair and not wear no
[1:17:31] lipsticks, but she's got a bad
[1:17:33] character. She is mean. She's ornery and
[1:17:36] she don't even obey her parents.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; I don't care how pretty she is. Don't
[1:17:41] marry the girl.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; She ain't going to listen to you. She's
[1:17:45] got bad character.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Or girl.
[1:17:53] Some boy may be handsome. I mean
[1:17:56] handsome as all get out.
[1:17:59] That's right. But he'll chew.
[1:18:02] He'll meet you at church to pick you up
[1:18:04] after church, but he won't come in.
[1:18:09] You go out there, you open that door,
[1:18:13] they'll say, I won't say a name and be
[1:18:17] one of our names or something. Open the
[1:18:19] door and say, "Well, why didn't you come
[1:18:21] in?" "Oh, I don't know about all that
[1:18:22] fanatical stuff."
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'll see you later."
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Slam that door.
[1:18:32] That's right. You ain't got the Holy
[1:18:34] Ghost.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; What did Brother Bram say? A certain
[1:18:37] family down the street. Amen. Amen. You
[1:18:39] know, they were decent people or
[1:18:40] whatever, but they wouldn't talk to you.
[1:18:42] They were, you know, didn't have much
[1:18:44] character that didn't have the Holy
[1:18:46] Ghost. But the Bible says, "Man, if a
[1:18:48] girl ever did uh date that guy or
[1:18:51] whatever, he says, I do I would
[1:18:52] encourage you never to date a boy until
[1:18:55] he's filled with the Holy Ghost."
[1:18:58] Why? Because that Holy Ghost changes
[1:19:00] you. [applause]
[1:19:04] How many believes God is looking for
[1:19:06] character?
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; And that's what you and I are here for.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; So I'll ask the question that I wrote
[1:19:18] down here that I thought of.
[1:19:22] What part of your character did you see
[1:19:27] that was changed in 25?
[1:19:33] How many knows we're in the changing
[1:19:34] business? From glory to glory, he's
[1:19:36] changing me.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. And it's a slow process.
[1:19:42] Some of us older folks know that we have
[1:19:45] it took us a lifetime to get here.
[1:19:52] I won't tell you what, but just
[1:19:54] yesterday,
[1:19:55] I overcome something that I hadn't
[1:19:57] overcome for a long time.
[1:20:03] Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And it was something simple, not
[1:20:07] something real bad, but
[1:20:12] it wasn't bad. It wasn't sinful, okay?
[1:20:14] But it was just a character. It's just
[1:20:18] uh not letting something upset me.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Just not letting something upset me.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, "Thank you, Jesus."
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; And you realize I realize that it worked
[1:20:34] out so much better that way.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; It works so much better that way.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:43] So I ask the church, I ask every one of
[1:20:45] us this morning, can you point to your
[1:20:48] character?
[1:20:49] Unless you've got perfect character,
[1:20:51] unless you're perfectly in the image of
[1:20:52] Christ, then you don't need to change.
[1:20:58] But I think we could all have an altar
[1:21:01] call this morning and say, "God, there
[1:21:03] is some per character in me that
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; I need to change that needs to change."
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Cuz I think about it and I think about
[1:21:13] Romans 8 where it says he predestinated
[1:21:16] us to be conformed to the image of son,
[1:21:19] his son. If he forneew you, he called
[1:21:22] you, he justified you,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; predestinated you to be conformed to the
[1:21:27] image of his son,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; and
[1:21:38] talk about building a house.
[1:21:41] This is about and I like that. Thank you
[1:21:43] for putting up putting that up. C
[1:21:45] character is a victory, not a gift. Why?
[1:21:49] In other words, you had to go through a
[1:21:51] battle for it.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; You had to pray for it. You had to go
[1:21:54] through a a strife for it or whatever.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; And if you've got character, it's a
[1:22:00] victory
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; cuz God is going to live with us.
[1:22:08] Just like a wife lives with her husband.
[1:22:11] And when you're building a home,
[1:22:16] now if you want to know, now I I I'm not
[1:22:18] going to have time to get into it, even
[1:22:20] though I've got the quotes and the
[1:22:21] scriptures. I wanted to read almost all
[1:22:23] of Revelations 21, and I don't know if I
[1:22:25] will yet not, but the actual place where
[1:22:28] you and I are going to live,
[1:22:30] streets and avenues and uh gates of
[1:22:33] pearl and 12 foundations, isn't that 12
[1:22:36] foundations with the apostles name
[1:22:38] written in it?
[1:22:41] You know, I had a and I thought about
[1:22:44] not just the yeah, the disciples and so
[1:22:46] forth, their names that are written in
[1:22:48] it. And I found out, brother Troy, that
[1:22:50] my name's going to be written
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; in one of the foundations.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; My name
[1:22:59] Thomas. Wasn't Thomas a disciple?
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Well, the 12 disciples, it may be
[1:23:05] Thomas's name, but my name's Thomas. I'm
[1:23:07] going to go over there today. Woo!
[1:23:09] [screaming]
[1:23:09] Oh yeah, I'm in the right place.
[1:23:14] That's one time maybe some of us wish we
[1:23:17] were already in common. No, not really.
[1:23:21] Oh my.
[1:23:24] But there's John, right?
[1:23:27] All these different different names.
[1:23:30] Amen. Part of the foundation. But what
[1:23:33] I'm saying is the place that God is
[1:23:36] preparing for us. And brother Bam said
[1:23:38] in in in uh John 13, I believe is I go
[1:23:42] to prepare a place for you. Amen. He
[1:23:45] said he's been there for thousands of
[1:23:47] years
[1:23:48] preparing that place for [screaming] his
[1:23:50] bride.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what it's going to be?
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I get excited just imagining it.
[1:24:02] says that there'll be streets of gold,
[1:24:05] transparent gold. [screaming]
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, it's God's not
[1:24:10] just going to give us streets of gold
[1:24:13] with us having bad character.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; No, because how many knows the trial of
[1:24:18] your faith being much more precious than
[1:24:21] gold that perishes, it's your gold that
[1:24:24] the gold is a Christlike character.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] So gold fits with gold.
[1:24:33] Your gold character.
[1:24:41] So I have a Oh, here we go. What about
[1:24:47] New Year's resolutions?
[1:24:50] Turning new pages and two two new le
[1:24:52] Does it work?
[1:24:56] Well, I'm going to differ with that just
[1:24:59] a bit.
[1:25:02] But before I differ, I've got to add a
[1:25:05] little something to it.
[1:25:07] Because isn't it say, "Well, I'm going
[1:25:09] to change this year." How many would
[1:25:12] say, "I want to be a better husband."
[1:25:14] Danny, you want to be a better husband?
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; You want to be a better brother to me? I
[1:25:20] want to be a better pastor for you. I
[1:25:22] want to be a better brother. I want to
[1:25:24] be a better husband to my wife. I want
[1:25:27] to be a better grandpa. Amen.
[1:25:31] And not do like I did one time when
[1:25:34] Emilyn or Elena said something about
[1:25:37] stupid. That's stupid.
[1:25:39] And Emilyn says, "Mommy says we can't
[1:25:43] say stupid."
[1:25:46] Grandpa said, "That's right, Emilyn.
[1:25:49] Don't say stupid." stupid
[1:25:54] something to that extent. Oh my. And
[1:25:57] then we laugh.
[1:25:59] So I got to repent. Lord help us.
[1:26:04] But it'll be a better How many wants to
[1:26:06] be better? How many's looking at this
[1:26:08] year to climb much higher than what you
[1:26:11] are?
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's my ambition. Now,
[1:26:17] turning a new leaf is about, you know,
[1:26:19] trying to trying to do better. Amen. And
[1:26:23] making a commitment.
[1:26:26] Amen.
[1:26:28] If, let me say this, it can work if you
[1:26:32] do it by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Say, God, I repent of my sins. I don't
[1:26:39] want to do that anymore. Lord, I ask God
[1:26:41] that this year would be different. Lord,
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; give me the power of your blood. Then,
[1:26:46] yeah, you can turn a new leaf. Then you
[1:26:49] can change from what you are and what
[1:26:51] you don't want to be.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; How many believes that? But only through
[1:26:55] the blood.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Only through Christ.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, yeah, you've never worked.
[1:27:03] It's like pulling yourself up by the
[1:27:05] bootstraps.
[1:27:07] It just makes you tighter on your feet.
[1:27:10] Can't pull yourself up. You can't change
[1:27:12] your nature.
[1:27:13] That's what people do and they try to
[1:27:16] change their own nature and they can't
[1:27:18] do that.
[1:27:21] I mean, if there's one desire,
[1:27:24] one desire that we have
[1:27:27] and that is to be more like him,
[1:27:30] to be more like Christ.
[1:27:35] We all come from different families.
[1:27:38] Isn't that right?
[1:27:39] We are all taught different.
[1:27:46] All of our name, last names, every last
[1:27:49] name that I could mention here, we're
[1:27:50] all different, raised a little
[1:27:52] different.
[1:27:55] But let me tell you something.
[1:27:58] We all when we come to Christ come into
[1:28:01] the family of God.
[1:28:05] We become God's children
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; and we become brothers and sisters to
[1:28:11] each other.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; That's why if I fuss with you, you fuss
[1:28:18] with me. You say something about me I
[1:28:20] don't like. You say something well or
[1:28:21] vice versa. Guess what? We shouldn't be
[1:28:24] able to go to each other. Amen. And hack
[1:28:26] it out. Come to the altar and say, "God,
[1:28:29] forgive us both." That's [screaming]
[1:28:31] what sons and daughters do.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And
[1:28:46] I believe this morning that
[1:28:50] we are more precious to each other
[1:28:54] than what your natural
[1:28:57] brother or sister is. That's exactly
[1:29:00] right. I'm a witness.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Go witness to some of your brothers and
[1:29:06] sisters, unless they're all message
[1:29:07] believers, and see how you really don't
[1:29:09] have that much in common.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; You got the same mama. You got the same
[1:29:13] daddy. But what did brother Banam say?
[1:29:14] He found out that they're not really his
[1:29:17] parents. He is our parent.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; There are earthly parents. There are
[1:29:22] earthly brothers and sisters. But if
[1:29:24] they don't get saved, you're not going
[1:29:25] to spend eternity with them. But you are
[1:29:28] going to spend eternity with each other.
[1:29:30] And that's why we ought to be thick as
[1:29:32] molasses on a [screaming] cold morning.
[1:29:34] And we ought to have more love in 26
[1:29:36] than we did in 25. We ought to be closer
[1:29:39] to each other in 26 than what we are in
[1:29:41] 25. More sensitive to each other.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:50] It's time
[1:29:52] not to be children.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; But to be grown up.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; How many believes we need to be grown
[1:30:08] up?
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Like I said, maybe I'll touch on on
[1:30:14] we we we're going to focus this morning
[1:30:16] for just another 20 minutes.
[1:30:20] on that character part.
[1:30:24] Amen.
[1:30:26] And I about got to say this before I go
[1:30:27] on,
[1:30:30] but
[1:30:32] forgive me, Courtney and Gersham. I like
[1:30:35] to use y'all an example.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; They're good ones, aren't they?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:43] Because it's like Christ looking for a
[1:30:46] bride. Ain't that right?
[1:30:48] I think what they got going is real
[1:30:49] good.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; I mean, if they cry when they leave each
[1:30:52] other, they got something going on.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell them that outside of
[1:30:57] salvation, what your experience is is
[1:30:59] the best thing there is outside of
[1:31:01] salvation.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; So enjoy it. Be happy.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:15] But brother Gersham no no doubt
[1:31:18] came to Courtney
[1:31:22] showed an interest. Ain't that right?
[1:31:25] The way that God comes to us showed an
[1:31:28] interest and she had to figure out
[1:31:30] whether this guy was what he she wants
[1:31:33] or not. Long before they said I do.
[1:31:37] Isn't that right?
[1:31:39] But here they are engaged now
[1:31:43] to be married.
[1:31:47] Is that a raptor you're driving? A
[1:31:49] raptor. He's driving a Raptor. I was
[1:31:50] going to go down and make sure. Pretty
[1:31:52] nice truck.
[1:31:54] He's probably kind of impressed. He
[1:31:58] huh? He also drives a Raptor. I really
[1:32:01] like him. He's handsome. He drives a
[1:32:02] Raptor.
[1:32:05] Which it probably wouldn't have really
[1:32:06] mattered when I wasn't dated my wife. My
[1:32:08] wife tells me here just not so long ago
[1:32:10] says, "You know, I didn't marry you for
[1:32:12] money."
[1:32:18] When I when we got
[1:32:21] engaged and seen each other, we was a 72
[1:32:24] orange 72 Chevy pickup. And at every red
[1:32:27] light, my gears, you know, it was one of
[1:32:29] them column shifters. And man, things
[1:32:32] would get stuck. I would have to quickly
[1:32:34] open the hood and unstick them things so
[1:32:37] I could go back on in about every red
[1:32:39] light. That wasn't a lot of fun.
[1:32:42] But I'm telling you what, she was stuck
[1:32:45] to me like glue.
[1:32:48] That's right. You right by my side.
[1:32:53] But what if Courtney, what if what would
[1:32:56] happen now that you're already
[1:32:58] committed? You're not dating him. You're
[1:32:59] not a gold digger.
[1:33:02] Curt's not a gold digger, by the way.
[1:33:07] Because there's a lot of out there that
[1:33:09] are. Ain't that right?
[1:33:12] But what would it be like? What would
[1:33:14] what would Now, we know that Courtney's
[1:33:16] eyes can get pretty big sometimes. She
[1:33:18] gets excited, right?
[1:33:21] What if she found out that actually
[1:33:25] Gersham had a billion dollars in the
[1:33:28] bank? Huh? Huh, Courtney? Huh?
[1:33:35] Yeah. Their eyes would be like, "What?
[1:33:41] That's so much better.
[1:33:44] That's Oh, I anything I want, anything I
[1:33:48] need, anything I desire, [screaming]
[1:33:50] I'll be able to get."
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe not all the wants, you'll control
[1:33:55] that, but a lot of the wants for a
[1:33:57] billion, you can have almost everything
[1:33:59] you want.
[1:34:01] How many knows super rich people? They
[1:34:03] can have whatever they want pretty much.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; And then what do you do? You just live
[1:34:07] on what you need to.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people can't control that.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. How many
[1:34:14] knows that when we come to Christ, we
[1:34:15] said, "Lord, I want salvation. I want
[1:34:18] you." And after we got married, we find
[1:34:20] out that he gives us a checkbook.
[1:34:22] Whatever you desire. Amen. He was a
[1:34:25] billionaire. [screaming]
[1:34:27] [applause]
[1:34:28] We married a billionaire.
[1:34:32] Amen. We look there. He says the make
[1:34:34] shall inherit the earth. The whole
[1:34:36] [screaming] earth is yours. Whether
[1:34:38] things pass and whatever it is, you just
[1:34:41] wanted to get saved. But you found out
[1:34:44] like that woman that had all of those
[1:34:46] checks. Ain't that right? She was poor.
[1:34:49] Amen. And the people come and said, "Why
[1:34:51] are you so poor? Why do you have to get
[1:34:53] charity?" She said, "My son sent me
[1:34:55] these beautiful checks or these
[1:34:58] beautiful pictures." Amen. And come to
[1:35:01] find out, she was worth all kinds of And
[1:35:03] that's the way it is. God sent us
[1:35:05] beautiful pictures.
[1:35:07] Amen. And we're worth billions of
[1:35:09] dollars. How many believe that's the way
[1:35:11] it is with God?
[1:35:13] Oh, everything that you have need of,
[1:35:17] God is going to supply it for you.
[1:35:22] no want to them that love him. Praise
[1:35:25] the Lord.
[1:35:28] So if you need victory this morning,
[1:35:30] God's got victory for you.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; You need deliverance this morning, God's
[1:35:34] got deliverance for you. You need joy
[1:35:37] this morning, God's got joy for you.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what it is. Praise the
[1:35:43] Lord.
[1:35:46] But God wants us
[1:35:48] in 26.
[1:35:52] How about this?
[1:35:54] Let's plan on Jesus coming back this
[1:35:57] year.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; How many plans on Jesus coming back this
[1:36:02] year?
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; How many plans on the rapture happening
[1:36:05] this year?
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we don't want to be a part of
[1:36:10] the foolish virgin. You know why?
[1:36:13] Because she was a virgin. She was
[1:36:14] somewhat holy. She was somewhat pure,
[1:36:17] but she didn't have any oil in her lamp.
[1:36:19] She wasn't quite up to specification.
[1:36:23] How many believe if you're going into
[1:36:24] rapture, you're going to have to up to
[1:36:27] specification.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to be what God
[1:36:30] wants you to be. And that's what we're
[1:36:32] here for. God mold us and shape us.
[1:36:39] To finish my quote, he chasens with nail
[1:36:43] scarred hands and thoroughly breaks it
[1:36:45] down. Amen. Working on it and thoroughly
[1:36:48] breaking it down in order that he can
[1:36:50] rebuild it again. Amen. Just like that
[1:36:53] house. Now notice he says,
[1:37:00] let me go back again. He rep he chasens
[1:37:02] with nails scarred hand. Sometimes the
[1:37:04] potter There you go. Sometimes the pilot
[1:37:07] must take the vessel that he is working
[1:37:09] on and thoroughly break it down. That's
[1:37:12] why I said we all come from different
[1:37:13] backgrounds. We all have different, you
[1:37:15] know, uh, habits and things and the ways
[1:37:17] that we've been taught. But I want you
[1:37:19] to know how many believes that we need
[1:37:20] to change that. Every one of us. Amen.
[1:37:23] And get taught this way. We all agree to
[1:37:26] this.
[1:37:30] We're no more Lasters and Bers and
[1:37:33] Hersburgers and Hallbeggers and Pewitts
[1:37:35] and Amen Baldwins or whatever.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Now we're God's children.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; And in one way, now don't st let this
[1:37:45] stumble this or out there on the radio
[1:37:46] land, but you know, Paul said, "Follow
[1:37:48] me as I follow Christ. I have begotten
[1:37:51] you to Christ." Paul said, "Brother
[1:37:54] Bannon, whenever he had a lot of people
[1:37:55] going out to Arizona, not working
[1:37:57] anymore and and living off of charity
[1:37:59] and everything, he says, "They're my
[1:38:01] kids. They're my children." So, how many
[1:38:04] believes we're the prophets? We're the
[1:38:06] children of the prophet.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; We're brother Brandham's children.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; That's awful quiet. Are we Brother
[1:38:12] Brandham's children?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. We're his children. He had
[1:38:15] begott us to Christ. We're part of the
[1:38:18] uh the the stars in his crown.
[1:38:24] Amen. And he says, you know, there now
[1:38:26] I'm going to have to give him a little
[1:38:27] spanking.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? A little correction.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you something. How many
[1:38:36] knows that when these children get
[1:38:38] correction, you're molding their
[1:38:41] [screaming] character? Chastisement is
[1:38:44] part of becoming what God wants us to
[1:38:47] be. Amen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Bible says if you can't take
[1:38:49] chastisement, if you can't take
[1:38:51] correction, then you're a pastor's
[1:38:53] child. You're not really one of us.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Got to be able to take chastisement. As
[1:39:01] many as I love, I chasen, I rebuke, be
[1:39:04] zealous, sell therefore, and repent. God
[1:39:06] lets us go through trials. How many?
[1:39:08] Everything that God has let us go
[1:39:09] through, Amen. It is for molding our
[1:39:12] character. [screaming] character that is
[1:39:14] fit to rule with him over there in his
[1:39:17] house in heaven.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:25] And sometimes he says he must take the
[1:39:26] vessel sometimes that he's working on
[1:39:29] and break it down in order that he may
[1:39:31] rebuild it exactly what he desires. So I
[1:39:35] ask you search your heart because this
[1:39:36] is the area sometimes I'll preach
[1:39:38] repentance to sinners.
[1:39:41] All right, y'all have heard me do that.
[1:39:42] But my focus, I focus more, Amen, in
[1:39:45] trying to get each and every one of us
[1:39:47] to maturity.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; How many believes that get you to
[1:39:52] maturity?
[1:39:54] I wrote down here, he says some of our
[1:39:55] young people, he mean, you need to act
[1:39:57] like you got gray hair
[1:40:01] because we've got gray hair means you
[1:40:03] ought to be solid. Means you ought to be
[1:40:06] mature. Amen.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; You have fought the battles.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; You've been molded.
[1:40:18] [snorts] Amen. I know one thing I need
[1:40:20] that is more patience.
[1:40:24] That's one thing I need. So, let me ask
[1:40:27] you this. How many believes? And ask
[1:40:29] yourself, ask yourself in the areas
[1:40:32] where you still have your character
[1:40:34] isn't quite the way that you know it
[1:40:36] ought to be. Amen. How many knows if you
[1:40:40] get built if your mama, your daddy, if
[1:40:42] my mama, my daddy taught us in ways that
[1:40:44] wasn't according to the word, guess
[1:40:46] what? God has to break us down.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; He's going to have to take us and break
[1:40:52] us.
[1:40:57] Now, I want to I've got two pages here
[1:40:59] on Amen. on uh
[1:41:02] well,
[1:41:04] on grown-ups.
[1:41:07] Amen. And backsliders. People that go
[1:41:10] backwards and or people that go
[1:41:12] forwards.
[1:41:14] Grown-ups and amateurs.
[1:41:17] How many believes we go forward, not
[1:41:19] backwards?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got wrote down here that we're
[1:41:24] Amen.
[1:41:26] We're looking not to go backwards
[1:41:28] because Paul said, "My soul has no
[1:41:30] pleasure in them that draw back."
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; How many would say, "I want to pray more
[1:41:37] this year."
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Not less.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; See, going backwards is to pray less.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; You take it as from the Holy Spirit.
[1:41:52] He's asking you right now, where are you
[1:41:54] right now compared to a week ago?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Huh? How about just us in the last week?
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Have you go went backwards
[1:42:04] or have you gone forwards?
[1:42:07] Because let me just say this. I for
[1:42:09] myself, I am looking desiring a much
[1:42:14] deeper walk with God.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; A much closer walk with God. Like that
[1:42:21] stream that brother Bam talked about.
[1:42:22] It's a deep stream. It may not have a
[1:42:25] lot of ripples and all of that, but
[1:42:28] guess what? It's experience
[1:42:30] runs deep and it reflects the stars.
[1:42:38] We want to be like Jesus ultimately.
[1:42:42] But how many knows that brother B
[1:42:45] preached something called a masterpiece
[1:42:46] and how that Jesus was the masterpiece
[1:42:49] and God smoteed him. Ain't that like
[1:42:50] kind of like Michelangelo? And he smoked
[1:42:53] him. He was perfect.
[1:42:56] But he talked about a bride tree that
[1:42:57] he's restoring and he's making a
[1:42:59] masterpiece out of the bride. Ain't that
[1:43:02] right? And I wanted to ask you this.
[1:43:05] What closer do we not already have a
[1:43:08] masterpiece in the bride
[1:43:13] that's so close like Christ that they
[1:43:16] baptized in his name? They thought
[1:43:18] brother Brandham was God.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:43:23] How many knows that it reflected so
[1:43:26] close?
[1:43:31] And then brother Brandham
[1:43:33] preaching in Sarah Vista in ' 64, he
[1:43:35] talked to to the church and he says,
[1:43:37] "Shalom church. Peace. God's peace to
[1:43:40] you. Good morning.
[1:43:43] It's breaking day church.
[1:43:46] It's darkness upon the people, but it's
[1:43:48] good morning.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he had so much negative
[1:43:52] say calling the wicked one a prostitute
[1:43:55] and everything else, but to the real
[1:43:56] church it was good morning.
[1:43:59] Christ is appearing among us
[1:44:03] and another place and this is another
[1:44:05] goal that we all want to have because I
[1:44:07] really don't believe that the bride was
[1:44:10] in this place when brother Brandon
[1:44:12] preached it because how many knows how
[1:44:16] few of churches I don't know just how
[1:44:17] few but I know it was just very few
[1:44:19] churches that even existed in 1965
[1:44:23] ain't that right brother Perry Green and
[1:44:26] maybe a few others not very ready.
[1:44:30] But yet, brother Brandon would say this
[1:44:32] to about the bride
[1:44:34] invisible union.
[1:44:37] He says, and this is my message to the
[1:44:39] church as you go off the air in a
[1:44:40] minute. You're standing. If you're
[1:44:42] standing on God's word and with God's
[1:44:44] word, every amen, every jot, every tit,
[1:44:48] where are you standing? He says,
[1:44:52] I hear the coming of the combine. I you
[1:44:54] are standing complete justified as
[1:44:57] though you never did it in the first
[1:44:58] place. Hallelujah. He says you are the
[1:45:01] pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son
[1:45:05] of the living God. Every man and every
[1:45:08] woman that's born of the spirit, washed
[1:45:10] in the blood of Jesus Christ believes
[1:45:13] every word of God stands as though you
[1:45:15] never done it in the first place.
[1:45:20] How many believe that that's what the
[1:45:21] bride is going to come to? You're going
[1:45:24] to be without spot, without wrinkle.
[1:45:26] Peter said, being found of him without
[1:45:28] blemish, without blame.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Wash what? Washed into water of the
[1:45:35] word.
[1:45:38] Ephesians says that husbands are to love
[1:45:40] their wives as Christ loved the church
[1:45:42] and gave himself for it, that he might
[1:45:44] present it to himself a glorious church,
[1:45:47] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:45:49] thing, but that it should be holy and
[1:45:51] without blemish.
[1:45:53] Lord, help us 2026. May this church may
[1:45:57] you, everybody that is possible, God,
[1:45:59] take away every blemish,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; take away every wrinkle out of my life.
[1:46:06] Lord, I give you permission. Work on me.
[1:46:08] I've got one interest not to be here in
[1:46:11] the tribulation period and have to give
[1:46:13] my life for my for my salvation. No, I
[1:46:16] want to be pure here. I want to be pure
[1:46:18] right now. [applause]
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; God, work on me.
[1:46:24] That's why I asked a while ago, is God
[1:46:26] working on you?
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Do you see the difference?
[1:46:32] I want you to be absolutely honest with
[1:46:34] you with me. Those of you who really see
[1:46:39] that God has changed you, changed your
[1:46:41] character at least in a minute way,
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; a little bit or a lot.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You should be
[1:46:52] able to raise your hand.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; If you don't raise your hand, you're
[1:46:56] just now telling me that you just really
[1:46:58] don't see that God has changed you.
[1:47:03] Isn't that right? So, Lord, change me
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; because we're going to be changed one of
[1:47:07] these days
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; and the way that you are and your
[1:47:10] character, it's going to have to be fit
[1:47:12] to that new house that God is building.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, when I begin to think about the host
[1:47:18] of those angels, when I begin to think
[1:47:21] about the future home of the heavenly
[1:47:22] bridegroom and the earthly bride, 1,500
[1:47:25] square miles, half the United States, I
[1:47:27] guess it is. Amen. the heavenly place
[1:47:29] coming down as a bride adorned for her
[1:47:33] husband.
[1:47:35] Amen. And there no sunlight anymore for
[1:47:38] the lamb is a light. No temple anymore
[1:47:40] for he is the temple.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; His goal is and God shall dwell with
[1:47:45] them. Revelations 21. His ambition, his
[1:47:48] goal, his final, what do you call it?
[1:47:51] His endgame or something. Amen. divided
[1:47:54] final outcome is that he is going to be
[1:47:56] their God and we are going to be his
[1:47:59] children.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; We're going to be there in the temple
[1:48:02] with him.
[1:48:04] Lord, help us.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; God, search your heart.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Change me where I need changing.
[1:48:14] Amen.
[1:48:20] Amen.
[1:48:23] Let's not be like Israel
[1:48:26] complaining,
[1:48:28] murmuring. Amen.
[1:48:34] Let's not find more excuses for oursel.
[1:48:39] Let's come to church more than what we
[1:48:41] did
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; in 2026.
[1:48:44] Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. the way I was feeling this
[1:48:50] morning. I almost called Brother Brad
[1:48:52] because I know he's ready. I almost
[1:48:54] called him.
[1:48:57] Said, "No, I don't feel that bad. I'm
[1:48:59] going. I could have.
[1:49:02] I had an excuse, but no." Said, "Give me
[1:49:05] some of that coffee. Give me some of
[1:49:07] that ivormectin. Give me them forward
[1:49:09] antibiotics." So, yeah, that's right.
[1:49:11] I'm ivormecting. I'm antibbodying up
[1:49:13] here.
[1:49:15] I'm coughing up here.
[1:49:18] But I'm here.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Come love to come to church if at all
[1:49:23] possible.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Don't want to go. How many say I don't
[1:49:26] want to go backwards. I want to go
[1:49:27] forwards.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Grown-ups have learned never to
[1:49:34] hold a grudge.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; If you're a grown-up, you have learned
[1:49:38] something. Never hold a grudge.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Never hold bitterness.
[1:49:46] That's right. That's right.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Me and my wife was talking. We said, you
[1:49:50] know, I I feel like I know somebody
[1:49:52] that's really kind of harboring
[1:49:53] bitterness.
[1:49:55] And I said, "Well, they're just
[1:49:56] juveniles. They're still young in the
[1:49:58] Lord. I don't care how long you've been
[1:50:00] in the message or how long you've been a
[1:50:01] Christian. If you can't identify that
[1:50:04] when you have a grudge in your heart,
[1:50:05] you have bitterness in your heart, and
[1:50:07] that you have a wrong spirit in your
[1:50:09] heart, you won't be able to get rid of
[1:50:11] it. You're just going to be thinking
[1:50:12] that's right, and that's okay." No. How
[1:50:14] many knows you ought to be a Christian
[1:50:16] enough to recognize, hey, you know, I
[1:50:18] don't have the right attitude. I don't
[1:50:20] feel right
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; cuz then you're ready. That's grace.
[1:50:25] That's God showing you, hey, you're not
[1:50:27] where you ought to be.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we've got to become grown
[1:50:32] up. Amen. Grown up to admit that we're
[1:50:35] wrong.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Grownup is being able to admit that
[1:50:40] you're wrong. To see you're wrong.
[1:50:43] Cuz I'm here to tell you, every one of
[1:50:45] us, we just for some reason think we're
[1:50:47] right. Even if we're wrong, we I'm
[1:50:49] right. I'm right. I'm right. I don't
[1:50:51] know. It seems to be in our hard drive.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit will come and show
[1:50:58] you.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; No, you're wrong. Not only have to say,
[1:51:03] you know, cuz that is so hard to say
[1:51:06] sometimes. I'm wrong. [laughter]
[1:51:12] It's so hard to say. And you know what's
[1:51:13] even harder is say I'm
[1:51:17] sorry.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; So hard to say.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; The flesh don't like it. But how many
[1:51:25] knows the spirit does? Because after
[1:51:27] that you're liberated.
[1:51:30] I'm glad I did it.
[1:51:33] You're liberated because you're a
[1:51:35] grownup. You're big enough to admit that
[1:51:37] you're wrong. You're big enough to say
[1:51:39] you're sorry. Cuz I want you to know God
[1:51:42] didn't send us this message so we could
[1:51:44] divide over little isms. Amen. Over
[1:51:47] little doctrines or whether the Sabbath
[1:51:49] seal is open or whether it's not or
[1:51:51] whether he's coming on a white horse.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; He didn't come here for us to better
[1:51:56] never meant for us to sit around, Amen,
[1:51:58] and fuss about his doctrines.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; No, [screaming] he never meant us for
[1:52:02] divide over little ism. He said that's
[1:52:04] what Pentecost did. That's what the
[1:52:06] Pentecostals let the devil do to them.
[1:52:09] That's what the devil does.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; No. God came with this message to bring
[1:52:14] us into unity, to the unity of the
[1:52:17] faith.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; You want to fuss, you're going to f fuss
[1:52:24] to a fence post.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; You're going to fuss to quiet lips. I
[1:52:28] ain't going to fuss with you.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit don't fuss.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ain't got the bigger. This
[1:52:37] message didn't come to do that. This
[1:52:39] message didn't come in this generation.
[1:52:41] Let me tell you something. Amen. Brother
[1:52:43] Brandham said, "Man, the Pentecostals
[1:52:45] got to the place, Amen, to where they
[1:52:46] wanted to have the most. They wanted to
[1:52:48] have the biggest church. We got the
[1:52:50] biggest church. We got the best
[1:52:51] preachers. We got this, that, and the
[1:52:52] other. And the message has almost gotten
[1:52:54] to where we got top 10. We got the best
[1:52:56] church. We got No. No. Don't be going
[1:52:59] there." Amen. We're all Christ. Amen.
[1:53:01] And I don't care if there's five
[1:53:03] somewhere in a church. They're as
[1:53:04] [screaming] valuable as a 500 in another
[1:53:07] turn. We're all God's people.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; There's no big eyes and little U's.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to be big, call yourself
[1:53:15] a servant. I'm just your servant.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Be grown up. That's what this message
[1:53:22] came to do.
[1:53:24] [sighs and gasps] How many believes
[1:53:26] that?
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:29] This message came to bring us the
[1:53:32] stature of a perfect man
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; right here. How many believes that?
[1:53:37] Second Peter, add to your faith, virtue,
[1:53:40] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:53:42] godliness, brotherhood of kindness, and
[1:53:45] love. Add these things to you. How many
[1:53:47] wants to say, God, I want more faith.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got three things. Let me just go a
[1:53:52] couple minutes extra. Is that okay?
[1:53:54] Hallelujah.
[1:53:56] Grown-ups.
[1:53:57] Amen. They praise him in their storms.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Evening like tabernacle
[1:54:04] people here. Amen. When times go rough,
[1:54:06] when things go south, praise him anyway.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Don't let it upset you. Don't let it
[1:54:13] mess your spirit up
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; cuz we all fall short on that sometimes.
[1:54:18] Ain't that right?
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; But Lord, help me. That's the way I want
[1:54:21] to be.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:28] Hallelujah.
[1:54:29] Praise him in the storm, in the trials.
[1:54:34] Realize that you've got to be tried. God
[1:54:37] is molding us and shaping us. Not for
[1:54:40] down here, but for over there.
[1:54:44] He wants us to be like him. Amen. How
[1:54:47] many believes it's time? Amen. That if
[1:54:49] you need to stop the sun, to stop the
[1:54:51] sun. If you need to pray for somebody's
[1:54:54] limbs to be restored, that those limbs
[1:54:56] can be restored.
[1:54:58] Time does to have faith unwavering.
[1:55:02] Time to be at a place.
[1:55:06] Amen. Become the message. Become that
[1:55:10] the devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:55:11] you anymore.
[1:55:14] [screaming]
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right, devil.
[1:55:19] You don't know what to do with me
[1:55:21] anymore.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Get to that place.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; I'm glad, brother Bam says that a man
[1:55:27] can lift to God that the devil doesn't
[1:55:29] know what to do with him.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Any closing? Amen. I want a
[1:55:35] grownup experience. I want that deep,
[1:55:38] rich experience.
[1:55:41] Amen. That it doesn't matter if there's
[1:55:43] tribulation. Amen. Distress,
[1:55:45] persecution, no matter what. Nothing
[1:55:48] separates us from the love of God.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; We are very deep but we are not so deep.
[1:55:55] Amen. That we should I say we are deep
[1:55:58] enough to know that we give God not
[1:56:01] amateur praise but we praise him on the
[1:56:04] loud symbols. We get a little loud
[1:56:06] sometime when it comes to worshiping God
[1:56:09] [cheering]
[1:56:10] cuz we realize wherever Jesus is there's
[1:56:13] always some noise. [cheering]
[1:56:15] Woo.
[1:56:17] Have that deep and still shout out to
[1:56:21] the Lord. See, I'm [screaming] going to
[1:56:23] worship like never before. I'm going to
[1:56:26] stand to my feet. Amen. And give God a
[1:56:28] little dance. Amen. I'm going to dance a
[1:56:31] little bit. I'm going to say my hands
[1:56:33] for him. I'm going to give him much more
[1:56:35] [screaming] grown up worship. Grown up
[1:56:38] worship. [applause]
[1:56:41] That's what we need to do. We need to
[1:56:43] give God grown up worship.
[1:56:46] cuz we're going to go into heaven. We're
[1:56:48] going to make a noise. [screaming] We're
[1:56:49] going to make a thunder. How many
[1:56:52] please?
[1:56:54] There's I'm telling you right now, we're
[1:56:55] part of that thunder. I'm going to be a
[1:56:57] part of that thunder. Are you going to
[1:56:59] be part of that thunder? Sounds like
[1:57:02] thunder.
[1:57:06] [applause and cheering]
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Glory. [screaming]
[1:57:12] [applause]
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Grown-ups
[1:57:23] [sighs]
[1:57:23] [gasps]
[1:57:25] don't have to come to church and have
[1:57:27] the pastor
[1:57:29] feed them.
[1:57:32] [sighs]
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to come to church to get
[1:57:38] fed.
[1:57:40] Brother Bam says, "A grownup lives in
[1:57:43] the don't have that out here." Amen. But
[1:57:46] in the holies of holies,
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; the third channel, they're in the
[1:57:51] presence of God all the time.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:57:57] [panting]
[1:57:58] And what did he say? You meet a
[1:58:01] believer, a person that's been in there,
[1:58:04] and I'm going to tell you, it don't
[1:58:05] matter if it's Monday, Tuesday,
[1:58:07] Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Amen. They
[1:58:09] don't got to come to church and get fed
[1:58:11] up. They're fed up [screaming] all the
[1:58:13] time. When you come to church, you're
[1:58:16] already fed up.
[1:58:20] Here's a good one. You'll like this one.
[1:58:23] We're like that. And and and you're so
[1:58:26] fed up until you're fat.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Grown-ups are spiritually fat.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Let your soul delight itself in fatness.
[1:58:42] I got a hard time quitting.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; I'm tired [snorts] of thinking about
[1:58:46] quitting. Let's quit about quit thinking
[1:58:47] about time. Is that okay? Can we go a
[1:58:49] little longer?
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; All we're going to do is sit around and
[1:58:51] talk for at least a half hour. The extra
[1:58:54] in between. So, might as well made the
[1:58:56] best of it. Let me see. Joel says, "How
[1:58:59] many believe this day this scriptur is
[1:59:01] fulfilled? Fear not, O land. Be glad and
[1:59:04] rejoice for the Lord will do great
[1:59:06] things." How many believe God has done
[1:59:09] great things?
[1:59:12] Be glad, ye children of Zion, and
[1:59:13] rejoice in the Lord your God. I like
[1:59:16] that. That's what we just got done
[1:59:17] doing, rejoicing. For he hath given you
[1:59:19] the former rain moderately, and he will
[1:59:21] cause to come down for you to delay the
[1:59:24] former rain and the latter rain in the
[1:59:26] first month. Amen. How many believe
[1:59:28] we've had the we've had the rain.
[1:59:31] Brother Brandham said that that former
[1:59:33] and later former and latter rain come
[1:59:35] together. Hallelujah. And the floor
[1:59:38] shall be full of wheat. The fats shall
[1:59:40] overflow with wine and all. And I will
[1:59:42] restore to you all the years that the
[1:59:44] locust has eaten. Tank of worm,
[1:59:46] caterpillar, palmer worm, the great army
[1:59:48] which I sent among you, and ye shall eat
[1:59:52] plenty.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Woo. I was coming from the chicken house
[1:59:55] this morning. Gather the eggs. Where was
[1:59:57] it last night? I thought, you know, in
[1:59:58] this world, I'm telling, we are so rich.
[2:00:01] Amen. We have so much food until you can
[2:00:03] eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and
[2:00:04] eat and eat until you're 300 lb, 325
[2:00:07] lbs. Our biggest problem is just get
[2:00:09] that spoon and put it back down. Ain't
[2:00:11] that right? Amen. Because we have we get
[2:00:14] fat. Amen. We got a problem fighting
[2:00:16] fatness. God help us. Amen. To have to
[2:00:18] fight a little spiritual fatness. No, we
[2:00:21] don't want to fight spiritual fatness.
[2:00:22] Just give me some more. Amen. I got
[2:00:25] wrote down here a real spiritual mature
[2:00:27] person. Amen. They say sometimes, Amen.
[2:00:29] They'll get so fat that you'll hear and
[2:00:33] they sound a little funny sometimes. But
[2:00:36] Abraham talked about the two little
[2:00:37] calves. One was the the owner was a a
[2:00:41] farmer that was lazy and yet but nothing
[2:00:43] but briars and thistles all winter long
[2:00:45] to feed that little calf. The other one
[2:00:47] he made in the summertime. He got them
[2:00:49] great big round bales. He made so many
[2:00:51] of them he got stored up with food. He
[2:00:53] fed them things when they come out them
[2:00:54] double doors. And I live there. I've
[2:00:56] been there. I know what it's like to
[2:00:57] open them doors and let them cows come
[2:00:59] out in the spring. Amen. They go out in
[2:01:01] there. Amen. And they're just round.
[2:01:03] Hello. And this little calf, he was just
[2:01:05] round when it got there and it felt that
[2:01:08] that wind and it felt that grass. Amen.
[2:01:10] Brother said, "Man, he jump."
[2:01:13] [screaming]
[2:01:17] Well, let me tell you something. You get
[2:01:18] a mature Christian. Amen. That's fast.
[2:01:21] Amen. He'll say, "Preach. [screaming]
[2:01:23] [cheering]
[2:01:25] Preach.
[2:01:26] Amen. Why you're saying get that dipper?
[2:01:29] Amen. With that big bowl, go down in
[2:01:30] that soup bowl and just give me some
[2:01:32] more. I love it. Preach. You want some
[2:01:36] more of that? That's what that mean.
[2:01:37] Amen. You listen to a real believer.
[2:01:39] Amen. That's mature. He'll say,
[2:01:41] "Hallelujah." [screaming]
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:47] [screaming]
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; The sound of a fat Christian.
[2:01:56] That's a new one. The sound of a fat
[2:01:59] Christian.
[2:02:02] [panting]
[2:02:08] Amen.

[2:02:13] Amen. You burnt up. Amen.

[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; You get a preacher up here, he's made
[2:02:28] out of ice.
[2:02:30] Well, now we've all come here and Jesus
[2:02:33] Christ died 2,000 years ago. And you
[2:02:37] know, back in those days, they did have
[2:02:40] miracles done. And there was a few of
[2:02:42] the apostles that got got the Holy
[2:02:45] Ghost, but we know it ain't there
[2:02:46] anymore.
[2:02:48] We don't he don't do the things that he
[2:02:50] used to do anymore. Amen.
[2:02:55] [laughter]
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; And guess what? Everybody in that
[2:02:59] congregation, I'll sit up here so you
[2:03:02] can see me. Scoot over a little bit,
[2:03:04] will you? Amen. The congregation
[2:03:08] just
[2:03:11] a man.
[2:03:14] Brother Bam says these intellectuals
[2:03:16] that say amen like a dying calf or
[2:03:20] something. They're just froze.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Froze.
[2:03:26] I'm telling you, we ain't froze.
[2:03:28] [screaming]
[2:03:29] We ain't froze. We're loosened up. We're
[2:03:32] on fire. [applause]
[2:03:35] How many glad to have a church on fire?
[2:03:37] How many want your soul on fire?
[2:03:39] [screaming]
[2:03:40] [cheering]

[2:03:43] tell me something. Give me another big
[2:03:46] scoop. I'll give you a sp big scoop.

[2:03:50] any certain day. You was always saved.
[2:03:53] Dip a little deeper. Get Give me another
[2:03:56] dip. You can no more be lost than God
[2:03:59] can be lost. Give me another one.
[2:04:04] [cheering]
[2:04:05] [sighs]
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; What did brother Daryl say? This can't
[2:04:15] be legal.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; [panting and sighs]
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it can. It is totally legal.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; It's what God wants.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; How many believes that when you rejoice
[2:04:30] like that, let me just I'll just give
[2:04:33] you my opinion this one time. I'm going
[2:04:35] to give you my opinion.
[2:04:38] I believe that when you rejoice like
[2:04:40] that and you worship God, God smiles,
[2:04:44] [sighs]
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; says, "That's my children.
[2:04:47] That's my children. That's how I want
[2:04:50] them, brother Brad. That's how I want
[2:04:52] them. I want them fullness of joy. When
[2:04:55] your kids are happy, Amen. And they
[2:04:57] shout. Amen. You smile. Say, "I'm glad
[2:05:00] my child is happy."
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:07] God bless you morning. Thank you for
[2:05:09] your prayers. God's house, he's building
[2:05:13] us a home.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's also building the
[2:05:17] inhabitants of that house.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; How many believe we're the inhabitants
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; of that house? And he is molding us.
[2:05:26] That's why I'm trying to be careful.
[2:05:27] Lord, [sighs]
[2:05:30] can I say something else?
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; I got one. Okay.
[2:05:37] I would say to the Lord Jesus, Jesus
[2:05:41] before I can ask you to work on the
[2:05:42] people, Lord, here I am.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Work on me.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Work on me. Amen.
[2:05:54] And you know why I smile? Because he
[2:05:57] does.
[2:05:59] I'm glad that when I can recognize in my
[2:06:01] life that God is doing a work, he loves
[2:06:05] me. He chasens us. Amen. But not praying
[2:06:09] enough. Let me say one more thing that
[2:06:11] comes to mind and that is mature
[2:06:15] Christians
[2:06:19] make time. Because the devil tries to
[2:06:23] take your I don't have time. That's the
[2:06:26] devil's phrase. Don't you ever let the
[2:06:28] devil say that to you. I don't have
[2:06:30] time.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Hello. You make time. You take time back
[2:06:35] and say, I've got time to pray. I've got
[2:06:37] time for God.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hello. I got time to go to church.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Well, I just don't feel like going to
[2:06:45] church tonight. Well, go anyway.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil win. Your flesh
[2:06:50] isn't going to feel like it all the
[2:06:51] time. Go anyway. And say, "God, forgive
[2:06:54] me." Cuz I'll be honest with you, I
[2:06:59] between Wednesday and today, I've had
[2:07:01] this on my heart, this kind of series,
[2:07:03] and I I'm like, man, it's still three
[2:07:06] days before I get preach this.
[2:07:09] It's still two days. This is only
[2:07:11] Friday. I can't wait for Sunday.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; How many thinks we all ought to feel
[2:07:16] that way? I can't wait till the next
[2:07:18] time we get together.
[2:07:21] [applause]
[2:07:25] I'm looking forward to having this meal.
[2:07:27] We'll get our meal. Amen. But I'm
[2:07:30] looking forward to this evening service.
[2:07:32] Can't wait to have brother Brad come up
[2:07:35] here. Amen. And give us get behind him
[2:07:37] and say, "Preach, Brother Brad. Preach.
[2:07:40] [applause and cheering]
[2:07:42] That's right.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Then go home and keep feeding.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Keep feeding. Sure, you get fed by your
[2:07:50] pastor, but guess what? You don't have
[2:07:52] to. Why? Because you get fed. You feed
[2:07:54] yourself every day. You're fed up. God,
[2:07:58] help us to be stay fed up. Mature
[2:08:00] Christians, we don't have to go to
[2:08:02] brother Donny's. We don't have to go to
[2:08:04] brother Timuits.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; We don't have to go to the Episcopals to
[2:08:07] have a revival.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; No, we don't depend on the local reigns.
[2:08:14] No, the believer is in a revival
[2:08:16] [screaming] all the time. How many
[2:08:19] believes we can have a revival wherever
[2:08:21] we are. We're not relying on this place
[2:08:23] or that place. We're in a [screaming]
[2:08:25] revival. How?
[2:08:28] That's right.
[2:08:30] When you can't hardly stop and when you
[2:08:33] can't wait to begin. Finally got it spit
[2:08:38] out. When you can't hardly stop. And
[2:08:39] when you can't wait to begin, you've got
[2:08:41] something going on.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand. Say, "Thank
[2:08:44] you, Jesus. [applause]
[2:08:51] Thank you Lord. Close your eyes and say
[2:08:53] thank you Lord.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus for coming this morning.
[2:08:58] Thank you for this day that you have
[2:08:59] given to us. Amen. To worship you to
[2:09:03] fellowship with our brothers and sisters
[2:09:05] to shake their hands to visit with them
[2:09:08] to come back together again and to
[2:09:10] worship you in spirit and in truth.
[2:09:12] Forgive us of all of our sins and our
[2:09:14] failures. Lord, make us spotless and
[2:09:16] work on our character. You know, God, we
[2:09:19] that's going to have to be a victory,
[2:09:21] Lord. So we, Father, open up our hearts.
[2:09:24] Say, one thing have I desired of the
[2:09:26] Lord. One thing will I seek after that I
[2:09:30] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[2:09:31] the days of my life. Lord, I ask God,
[2:09:34] have us ready for that day, for that
[2:09:36] time. Prepare us in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:09:40] Stand with me if you will. We'll get
[2:09:42] into the
[2:09:46] communion. The reason I did communion
[2:09:49] this Sunday is because brother Joe Adams
[2:09:50] will be with us Sunday, next Sunday. And
[2:09:52] I certainly wouldn't want him to cut it
[2:09:54] short. Amen. So, we'll just go ahead and
[2:09:56] do it today. We got the time and so
[2:09:58] we're going to change it just for today.
[2:09:59] Amen. Have communion because
[2:10:03] I have the deepest respect for
[2:10:05] communion. Amen. because it's something
[2:10:07] that Jesus told us to do in remembrance
[2:10:10] of him as much as and often as we do it.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; How many believes that? So, it's always
[2:10:15] an honor to take the Lord's supper and
[2:10:18] foot washing. Amen.
[2:10:21] Turn your Bibles.
