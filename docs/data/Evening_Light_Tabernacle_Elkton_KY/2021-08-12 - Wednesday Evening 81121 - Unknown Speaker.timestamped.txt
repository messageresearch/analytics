[2:03] and i know
[2:04] there's uh
[2:05] it's going very rampant i know there's
[2:07] several churches that have
[2:09] have a lot of people in them that are
[2:12] have
[2:13] are sick so we just want to remember the
[2:15] different ones and
[2:16] i haven't heard how the the group in
[2:18] johnson city are doing and i and the the
[2:21] group in oklahoma and i was watching on
[2:25] uh
[2:26] youtube last night or facebook last
[2:29] night uh brother steve shelley
[2:32] they had their they have a service on
[2:34] tuesday night and they just had it
[2:36] on the facebook and he has several in
[2:39] his church that has it and he said the
[2:41] first ones that had got it were
[2:43] coming out and they were they were able
[2:45] to go back to work and things and so
[2:47] just remember different ones and you
[2:50] know it's just uh
[2:52] it's something that's going around we
[2:53] have to deal with but we just
[2:55] just commit our hearts and our lives to
[2:57] the lord and
[2:58] i thought as we sing that course i can't
[3:00] even walk without you holding my hand
[3:02] and i i tell you
[3:06] i'd hate to know that i had to live in
[3:07] this world today without the lord jesus
[3:10] and my heart and life
[3:12] and
[3:13] i'll just be honest with you i i'm not
[3:15] going to lie to you sometimes it's kind
[3:17] of scary when you think about it
[3:20] the things that's going on and
[3:22] you know just
[3:24] people
[3:25] they don't have to have a reason to kill
[3:27] you they just want to do it because
[3:28] they're they're possessed of a spirit
[3:30] that's not
[3:31] not of of a christian but i thought you
[3:33] know lord what will we do without you
[3:37] keeping your hand upon us
[3:39] his protective hand of mercy and you
[3:41] know only a turn till tell
[3:43] how many times his hand reached out
[3:47] picked us up and
[3:49] you know i always used to get upset when
[3:50] i'd make a mistake and go the wrong way
[3:53] and but tim pruitt told me one time we
[3:55] were going to youth camp and
[3:57] i told him i said well mr and he said
[3:59] brother david never
[4:01] never get upset he i said why he said
[4:04] the lord jesus
[4:06] possibly let you go that way to miss
[4:08] something happening he said always look
[4:10] that god is keeping you in his hand
[4:13] keeping his hand up on you
[4:15] and
[4:16] of course now i'm worse than ever about
[4:18] getting lost but
[4:20] i guess he's watching over me a whole
[4:21] lot is all i can say but i'm thankful
[4:23] for his grace and mercy tonight and
[4:26] amen we want to remember those needs in
[4:27] our shut-ins brother and sister perish

[4:30] brother i'll continue to remember him in
[4:31] prayer and sister donna's not feeling
[4:33] well tonight and uh jen's not here uh

[24:12] let's bow our heads
[24:16] kind heavenly father once again we come
[24:18] before your throne of grace
[24:20] lord desiring god that you just meet
[24:22] with us lord jesus as we have
[24:24] assembled ourselves together
[24:26] lord and in your name just
[24:29] ask god that you'll come in a special
[24:30] way speak to our hearts along the way
[24:32] that it might burn within us that we
[24:34] might know that it was you that's
[24:36] speaking to us lord and we ask god that
[24:39] we bless each one that has come out and
[24:40] for those that are not feeling well we
[24:42] ask god this special touch lord jesus
[24:44] from you father that they would raise up
[24:47] again to full strength full health
[24:50] and lord jesus to be able to enjoy the
[24:51] life that you have given the lord
[24:53] now lord we ask for direction from you
[24:55] from your spirit to lead us to guide us
[24:57] father
[24:58] help us to say just what you once said
[25:00] lord jesus and not to say anything we
[25:01] shouldn't lord bless the reading of the
[25:04] word the meditation of our heart our
[25:05] assembling together now as we commit our
[25:07] hearts and our lives to you in jesus
[25:09] name
[25:10] amen and amen
[25:13] amen want to speak on a little subject
[25:15] tonight with the help of the lord there
[25:17] was a word just a word basically that
[25:19] came into my mind
[25:20] amen and
[25:22] i just began to think about it and lord
[25:24] just seemed to quicken it so we'll see
[25:26] what the lord will have for us
[25:28] amen and it'll go along with what we've
[25:30] been talking about
[25:32] about god building a habitation amen i
[25:35] mean believe that's what god is doing
[25:37] amen so that he could inhabit our hearts
[25:39] and our lives amen inhabit the church of
[25:42] god
[25:43] now when he does inhabit it we want to
[25:45] follow that thought for a minute amen we
[25:47] want to see what that's like amen
[25:50] so
[25:51] turn your bibles if you will go to the
[25:53] scripture that i just came to and came
[25:55] to my mind
[25:56] amen and i was thinking
[25:59] uh the word image
[26:01] amen the word image
[26:04] came to my mind
[26:06] amen
[26:07] and i was thinking about
[26:10] i mean when a person passes away
[26:14] and
[26:15] you know the preacher will say all kinds
[26:17] of things different things about that
[26:19] person
[26:20] most of the time
[26:21] i'm a lot of times i'll preach funerals
[26:24] and
[26:26] for the most part
[26:27] you'll say everything good about the
[26:29] person that you know or that you can
[26:31] at a funeral is not a good place to go
[26:33] the other way
[26:35] amen and so whether it's good or bad you
[26:38] just speak the good amen and let the
[26:40] rest fall where it may amen
[26:42] and you know but sometimes i've been at
[26:44] funerals and i've heard things said and
[26:46] so forth you know and i think it was
[26:48] even the prophet of god said that
[26:50] there's no uh
[26:52] really they live their lives and
[26:55] and people know what kind of person he
[26:58] was or she was right
[27:00] and
[27:01] no amount of words will change their
[27:03] mind about that you know because they
[27:05] live their lives and their lives said
[27:08] more about them than a preacher ever
[27:09] will or anybody saying anything you know
[27:12] but basically when when person is laying
[27:14] there
[27:15] you may look at that person and
[27:18] but
[27:19] you realize you're just looking at a
[27:21] person and one and everything about that
[27:23] person
[27:25] uh
[27:26] comes into your mind and you have an
[27:28] image
[27:29] in your mind
[27:31] of what that person was like right
[27:36] you know and this can happen not just in
[27:39] that case but
[27:40] i would probably say that in that case
[27:43] uh you know it would be more vivid
[27:45] perhaps than at any other time because
[27:48] you think about that person you think
[27:49] about
[27:50] his life you don't so much look at the
[27:53] person's
[27:54] uh
[27:56] outside
[27:57] you know
[27:59] that way as you think about the person's
[28:01] what
[28:02] character
[28:04] right the kind of character that he was
[28:06] the kind of
[28:07] person that he was what that person was
[28:09] like to be up close to
[28:12] to talk to
[28:14] to be around the atmosphere
[28:17] that that person created
[28:19] right
[28:20] and we all carry that atmosphere around
[28:22] us don't we
[28:24] amen and our our brother bam called it i
[28:27] guess an aura you know
[28:29] and there's just something about each
[28:30] one mccarra or we care a atmosphere
[28:33] amen and that's either a good atmosphere
[28:36] or a not so good atmosphere and we've
[28:38] heard probably god describe how that
[28:40] there's people he loved to be around and
[28:41] others not so much so you know i'm
[28:44] saying it so all of that comes in and i
[28:46] got to thinking about the image
[28:48] that a person thinks of when they look
[28:50] at that person and then i went over and
[28:52] it began beginning to think about the
[28:54] image of god
[28:55] you know
[28:56] you know if you could see god or if you
[28:58] would think about god
[29:01] what would come into your mind right
[29:03] what kind of an image would you have
[29:05] in your mind if you thought about god
[29:09] and then i thought you know this word
[29:11] image and the thought of an image
[29:14] is pretty powerful and we'll read it
[29:17] now and we'll see just how powerful that
[29:19] is
[29:20] in romans 8
[29:24] in romans 8 and verse 28 for we know
[29:27] that all things work together for good
[29:30] to them that love god to them who are
[29:32] the called according to
[29:35] his purpose
[29:36] for whom he did for know he also did
[29:39] predestinate now notice
[29:42] all of this foreknowledge that we talk
[29:44] about all this predestination that we
[29:47] talk about and know about
[29:49] it goes somewhere right
[29:51] it has a purpose in it
[29:53] whom he did predestinate
[29:55] he he also did pronouncing it
[29:59] to be conformed
[30:01] to the image
[30:03] of his son amen so we see that word
[30:06] image there
[30:08] in relation to his son that anybody he
[30:11] predestinated
[30:12] anybody that he foreknowed
[30:15] he predestinated them to be conformed to
[30:19] an
[30:20] image right
[30:22] amen
[30:23] that image is to be an image
[30:26] of his son
[30:29] that he might be the firstborn
[30:32] among many brethren may god had his
[30:35] blessings to the reading of the word you
[30:36] can be seated
[30:38] amen
[30:39] you know i was praying back there as i
[30:41] was praying i got to thinking of how
[30:43] that here we are here on this wednesday
[30:45] night we've come out on a wednesday
[30:47] night again we've got another service
[30:49] again
[30:50] you know and perhaps we come and we just
[30:52] think well we have another service but
[30:54] you know we realize that this church
[30:57] amen and so i wanted to phrase it this
[30:59] way
[31:00] we come out and we're fixing to have
[31:03] one less service
[31:08] one less service we're here tonight to
[31:12] feel
[31:13] to have one less service
[31:16] because how many know one of these days
[31:18] this is all going to be memory well
[31:20] you know
[31:21] it's not if we're not going to be able
[31:23] to have service anymore
[31:25] it's going to stop
[31:28] all this is going to
[31:30] stop
[31:32] amen
[31:34] and there's just so many services that
[31:36] we're gonna have
[31:39] amen so tonight just takes one of those
[31:41] services off we get a little closer to
[31:43] that last one
[31:45] right
[31:46] just kind of like our breath every time
[31:48] you breathe you got so many that you got
[31:50] coming
[31:52] and every time you take one you're
[31:53] taking one less
[31:55] you're subtracting amen
[31:58] i got to thinking of how that
[32:01] amen like i think brother dave was
[32:02] saying that's what will it be when we
[32:04] get over yonder and join the throng upon
[32:06] the glassy sea we realize that was that
[32:08] way for
[32:10] paul and peter and all of those those
[32:13] those people are sealed away this
[32:15] evening
[32:16] in a different dimension right
[32:18] in their age now how many knows that
[32:21] when the prophet of god when brother
[32:23] brown seen his people in his age
[32:27] i don't believe he saw paul's age
[32:30] irenia's age
[32:31] martin said he didn't see all of them
[32:34] he just saw the millions
[32:37] for his age
[32:39] so i don't know how it works all i know
[32:41] is that they all are gathered in that
[32:43] age
[32:44] and just the thing
[32:46] with our little minds that they have
[32:48] been over there paul has been peter has
[32:51] been they've been over there under the
[32:53] author there in that place where they
[32:55] don't eat or drink and they're in a
[32:57] great place for almost 2 000 years
[33:02] well i guess it's over 2000 years now
[33:04] right
[33:06] it's over two thousand for two can you
[33:08] imagine being in one place for over 2
[33:10] 000 years
[33:19] uh to me brother pete i'd be thinking
[33:22] we're getting just a little fidgety come
[33:24] on can we do something else now
[33:27] but you know it's so perfect
[33:29] that i'm sure that there is never no
[33:32] tomorrow like the prophet said there was
[33:34] no yesterday everything is just now it's
[33:37] perfect it's beyond what you can imagine
[33:39] so they're perfectly happy where they
[33:42] are
[33:48] can i go a little down fantasy i
[33:51] landed my imagination a little bit would
[33:53] that be all right
[33:55] and then when we think on the other hand
[33:57] of cain
[33:59] huh
[34:00] nathan car we think about those people
[34:02] way back there that they have been in
[34:05] their nightmare for close to 6 000 years
[34:16] amen
[34:18] that's a long time let me know six
[34:20] thousand years that's a long two
[34:21] thousand years is a long time
[34:24] two thousand years in the land of bliss
[34:25] that be fine there's nothing wrong with
[34:27] that but to be in the other place that
[34:30] would be a whole different story
[34:34] amen
[34:36] and you know you realize you know all of
[34:38] us were just so focused we could just
[34:40] realize how
[34:41] temporary we are here how this is so
[34:44] temporary
[34:47] amen
[34:49] just a vapor that comes and goes that's
[34:51] all your life is it's just a little
[34:52] vapor that comes and goes
[34:55] amen
[34:57] and it really won't
[34:59] mean much at all
[35:01] it'll have been better for you and have
[35:02] to have been born
[35:04] if you don't have god
[35:07] if you don't walk
[35:08] with
[35:10] god
[35:11] amen
[35:13] so i got to thinking
[35:15] how that they've been waiting for all
[35:17] that time
[35:19] but you know how many knows the time is
[35:21] drawing nigh
[35:23] time is drawing nigh
[35:25] prophet said that
[35:26] paul's age will come up
[35:29] irene as his age will come up columbus
[35:31] age will come up
[35:33] amen
[35:34] luther wesley all those age will come up
[35:37] and we'll come up and fall right in line
[35:39] we'll all go meet the lord in the air
[35:42] amen won't it be something
[35:45] and we're looking for that time and i
[35:47] got to thinking of how you know it's
[35:49] getting to where uh antifa and different
[35:52] are attacking churches and so forth and
[35:55] like brother david said it's getting a
[35:56] little scary i imagine you're going to
[35:58] get a whole lot more scary yet
[36:02] amen and so
[36:03] we'll just have to watch that unfold you
[36:05] know but aren't you glad to be in god's
[36:07] hands
[36:09] and to know that the lord is leading you
[36:11] the lord is guiding you
[36:14] and so i got to thinking about this
[36:15] image of god
[36:18] amen the image of god and so god has
[36:21] predestinated for us of course we know a
[36:23] lot of this tonight but is it okay for
[36:25] me to go over it again
[36:27] amen and brother bannon and i got to
[36:30] thinking about this image and then i
[36:31] remembered hearing the message brother
[36:32] brandon preached in 1958 you'll have to
[36:34] scroll down and find it but i believe
[36:36] it's called images of christ images
[36:39] of christ
[36:41] amen
[36:42] and so
[36:44] and i got that now i'm not going to go
[36:45] down and pull anything out of there and
[36:47] do a study but because i want to go a
[36:49] little bit different direction
[36:51] amen
[36:52] but as we think about this
[36:54] the image of his son
[36:59] an image that's what it's all about
[37:02] it's all about god having
[37:04] us
[37:05] in a certain
[37:07] image
[37:09] when people look at you
[37:11] what do they see
[37:13] when they look at me what do they see
[37:16] what do they think one image pops into
[37:18] my mind in their mind right
[37:21] because it's really about the character
[37:24] and even about the character of god
[37:29] amen
[37:30] now we know in genesis 1 26 god said let
[37:33] us make man
[37:35] in our
[37:36] image
[37:37] amen
[37:39] after
[37:40] our
[37:41] likeness and let them have dominion over
[37:44] the fish of the sea over the fowl of the
[37:46] air
[37:47] and over the cattle and over all the
[37:49] earth and over every creeping thing that
[37:53] creepeth upon the earth
[37:55] and so god created man in his own image
[38:02] amen how many believes that's what we
[38:04] were created for
[38:06] we were to create it to be a amateur god
[38:12] a son of god
[38:17] you know when you have a little boy or a
[38:18] little girl or whatever it might be and
[38:20] you know most of the time a little boy
[38:22] says boy that's a that's a little johnny
[38:24] running around right there
[38:26] or a little pill or whatever it might be
[38:28] you know it's just the amateur of the
[38:31] father
[38:32] we hear words like he's the spitting
[38:35] image of his father or she's a spitting
[38:37] image of her mother or you know she's in
[38:40] the image of her mother or whatever it
[38:41] might be or chip off the old block or
[38:43] something
[38:44] that's what god is looking for he's
[38:46] looking for
[38:49] to bring forth what he says that he
[38:50] might be the first
[38:53] of many
[38:55] the first of many
[38:57] so we find that god created him in his
[38:59] own image in the image of god created he
[39:01] him
[39:03] male and female created he them
[39:08] amen
[39:09] now this is where the prophet of god
[39:11] pulls in and he says you know when god
[39:13] made adam
[39:14] he made him both masculine
[39:17] and feminish
[39:19] well i guess some of them other folks
[39:20] that run with that wouldn't they
[39:27] and he had both both both of it both of
[39:29] it was in him until he took the rib out
[39:32] of the side
[39:33] and he took that feminist part and made
[39:35] a woman out of it
[39:37] that's right
[39:38] so as guys we just don't go around
[39:40] saying oh my
[39:44] we just don't do that right
[39:47] right why because it's something a
[39:49] moment we don't have the don't have one
[39:50] to have the same emotions and it makes
[39:52] you sick when somebody else does right
[39:55] because why
[39:56] we know that they have a feminist spirit
[39:59] on them
[40:00] unfortunately men can get feminist
[40:02] spirits on them and women sure can get
[40:04] masculine spirits on them
[40:07] amen and it's uh such a perversion
[40:11] of the image of god
[40:14] didn't brother bam say you know the
[40:15] women are cutting their hair off putting
[40:16] pants on and the man didn't get long
[40:18] hair
[40:19] amen
[40:20] so there was just a
[40:22] perversion of the image of god now we
[40:24] know that after the fall i mean it was
[40:27] after the fall now we could talk much
[40:29] about before the fall because we know
[40:30] before the fall adam was in the image of
[40:33] god he could speak to a mountain he
[40:35] could say this he could say that and it
[40:37] would all happen
[40:39] he had the power of god behind him
[40:42] but after the fall that image was broken
[40:49] you know right
[40:50] he was used to pet the lion he was
[40:53] friendly with the lion but boy
[40:55] afterwards he got scared of the lion he
[40:57] had to run up a tree
[40:59] because that lion he looked way too
[41:01] vicious to stick around right
[41:04] he had to go run for his life he was
[41:06] scared
[41:08] amen fear all don't think him in but all
[41:11] through the old testament god
[41:14] was trying to get a man back in his
[41:17] image wasn't he
[41:19] brother man appreciate masterpieces
[41:20] where i thought another one brother man
[41:22] preach a masterpiece amen talking about
[41:24] how god has been trying to build a
[41:25] masterpiece like michelangelo did amen
[41:28] that michelangelo had a picture of his
[41:30] mind his mind about how moses looked and
[41:32] just what he was when he had that
[41:34] perfect sculpture of moses he got oh so
[41:37] inspired took his hammer and smacked him
[41:40] on the knees and speak
[41:43] amen well michelangelo just wasn't quite
[41:45] close enough to god yet buzzy
[41:49] he thought maybe he could speak
[41:51] but he didn't speak did he
[41:53] no
[41:54] but he was inspired he said this is what
[41:56] it was look like and you know that's
[41:58] where it was in the old testament we had
[42:00] great men like david we had people like
[42:03] well even abraham was the first that was
[42:05] chosen by god he had the faith that god
[42:07] was looking for
[42:09] and that right oh he was so so righteous
[42:12] and so holy until he says you know
[42:14] because he has believed and he's because
[42:17] of his belief god accepted him
[42:20] amen
[42:23] but abraham certainly wasn't perfect was
[42:25] he
[42:26] no abraham he was a little liar
[42:30] his wife could talk him into stuff he
[42:32] she shouldn't have been able to talk
[42:34] into him hagar and so forth isn't that
[42:37] right and all of these children the
[42:39] ishmael's children you know that we
[42:40] still have to deal with today
[42:42] easy or not
[42:43] [Laughter]
[42:46] but anyway we know that all of that
[42:48] right
[42:49] and so
[42:50] you know but still it was not perfect he
[42:53] was not perfect but boy they did some
[42:55] great things didn't they there were some
[42:57] men like david that could kill those
[42:59] lions that man he had faith in god and
[43:02] he was a man after god's own heart
[43:06] and i don't even like to preach the bad
[43:08] stuff about him but we still have to
[43:10] sometimes right you know that he was a
[43:13] murderer and he was uh you know
[43:16] you know he took him another man's wife
[43:18] and everything else
[43:19] hey david come on man you can have 500
[43:22] of them but just don't take another
[43:23] man's how about it right but no he had
[43:26] to have some other mans and they got
[43:28] into all kinds of trouble stuff
[43:31] but it was because of his repentant
[43:33] heart life thing i've heard other
[43:35] ministers say it too i believe it is but
[43:36] because of his repented art
[43:39] and wanting to be right right sure he
[43:41] made mistakes but he wanted to be right
[43:43] that's a whole lot more than a lot of
[43:45] people want to be
[43:46] amen and so because of that he was after
[43:49] man god's god's own heart it was
[43:51] represented in there and then you take
[43:53] samson that could kill a thousand
[43:55] philistines
[43:57] you know and he and he gave his strength
[43:59] to the lord
[44:01] is that right
[44:02] god used his strength and he was
[44:04] invincible
[44:06] right he was an image of god boy god
[44:08] can't be stopped
[44:10] the whole philippine filipino
[44:13] philip
[44:14] philistine army
[44:16] oh
[44:18] oh philistine army was scared of samson
[44:21] because
[44:22] i don't care how much you throw at him
[44:24] he's going to overcome all of you
[44:27] and that was just an image there was a
[44:29] little flicker show of
[44:31] a image of god and what god is really
[44:34] really like
[44:35] moses taking a stick and going down to
[44:38] egypt amen going down to take over
[44:41] moses was a great mighty man of god and
[44:44] he was greatly used until pharaoh had to
[44:47] fear him
[44:48] amen but what did he had he still had an
[44:50] imperfection
[44:52] he had a temper problem
[44:55] he smoked
[44:56] he smote the rock twice when he was
[44:58] supposed to just speak to
[45:02] it and brother braham said he broke all
[45:05] the scriptures
[45:08] hard to imagine but just because of his
[45:09] temper and it kept him out of the
[45:11] promised land amen
[45:12] and so forth from going over on down
[45:15] just different ones all the way down
[45:17] we'll come on the down to christ here
[45:19] till finally guess what finally jesus
[45:22] showed up
[45:24] is that right
[45:25] finally jesus showed up
[45:29] and when he showed up
[45:32] all this mysterious god of the old
[45:35] testament
[45:37] the god because how many know god is a
[45:39] pillar of fire he's a consuming fire
[45:42] that's what god is
[45:44] and many people have always wondered
[45:46] what this great god was like but in
[45:49] hebrews 1
[45:52] let's go to hebrews 1.
[46:06] verse one god who had sun dry times in
[46:09] diverse manners spake in times past unto
[46:12] the fathers by the prophets oh god had a
[46:16] great way of speaking to everybody back
[46:17] in the old testament sure many different
[46:20] ways but he had in these last days
[46:23] spoken to us by
[46:25] his son
[46:27] whom he had appointed heir of all things
[46:31] by whom also he made the worlds how many
[46:34] believes that he made the world by jesus
[46:36] christ
[46:38] who being now notice who being the
[46:40] brightness of his glory
[46:44] that's who jesus was he was the
[46:46] brightness of his glory
[46:47] and the express
[46:50] image of his person
[46:54] amen
[46:56] he was so much like god
[46:59] that he said
[47:01] my knee and my father are one
[47:10] if you have seen me you have seen the
[47:13] father in other words i am the perfect
[47:16] expression of almighty god
[47:19] i come in the perfect image of
[47:22] god wow
[47:25] the express image of his person and
[47:28] upholding all things by the word of his
[47:30] power when he had by himself purged our
[47:32] sins sat down at the right hand of the
[47:34] majesty on high
[47:36] so here we see that god finally finally
[47:39] found somebody that was in his perfect
[47:41] image a perfect image anyone and the
[47:44] first thing he does
[47:46] what have what's one of the first things
[47:48] that jesus does
[47:50] he goes up into a mountain
[47:53] matthew 4 i believe it is
[47:55] to be tempted by the devil
[47:58] right
[48:00] that's the first thing and this is where
[48:02] we could take a whole series we could
[48:04] take four or five service probably
[48:07] but i'm gonna go through this just as
[48:09] the holy spirit leads
[48:13] but that was the first thing the first
[48:15] thing that he did was taken up into it
[48:17] into the mountain to be tempted and try
[48:20] now i've got about five six seven things
[48:22] here wrote down that i want to test
[48:24] ourselves with to see whether we're in
[48:26] that image or whether we're not is that
[48:27] okay
[48:28] but first i want to go a little further
[48:30] let's just take christ we know that he
[48:31] overcome everything amen and that he
[48:34] went and he overcome death hell on the
[48:36] grave he overcame all of those things
[48:38] isn't that right
[48:39] and he uh you know ascended up into the
[48:42] heavens
[48:43] right
[48:44] he was lifted up on high
[48:47] and on the day of pentecost his spirit
[48:50] christ in spirit form again
[48:52] came back
[48:56] hello
[48:58] his spirit came back
[49:00] because he was about once again
[49:03] like he said i come from the pillar of
[49:05] fire and i go back to the pillar of fire
[49:07] in other words he said i come from god
[49:09] and i go back to god
[49:12] amen i go back to the form i was before
[49:15] and when paul's alarmed what did he see
[49:18] he didn't see jesus's face he'd seen a
[49:20] light
[49:21] a bright light struck him down and that
[49:24] bright light said i am jesus whom thou
[49:26] persecuted
[49:27] at the same time on the day of pentecost
[49:29] christ divided himself up
[49:31] in his people right
[49:34] in his people he divided himself up
[49:38] and what did he do when he filled peter
[49:41] up filled all those up amen they went
[49:43] out into the streets and preached the
[49:45] gospel
[49:48] amen
[49:49] this is where brother brahm talked about
[49:51] how that even i heard him saying it
[49:53] today i believe it was in masterpiece he
[49:55] talked about seeing that bride twice
[49:58] the first bride was beautiful the second
[50:01] was beautiful all in shape and
[50:03] everything except the very last fuel
[50:05] began to get out of step a little bit
[50:06] but got back in line he was fixing to
[50:08] rebuke him but before he did i
[50:10] understand they got back in line so
[50:12] forth but it was two two previews and he
[50:15] makes mention that that first fraud was
[50:17] perfect
[50:19] another place brother bam talked about
[50:20] that first church she was so much in the
[50:24] image of god i may believe that church
[50:26] was so much in the image of god
[50:29] until people could just walk in the
[50:31] shadow of peter
[50:32] and be healed
[50:37] wow
[50:38] isn't that right they looked like jesus
[50:41] they walked like jesus everybody took
[50:43] note that they had been with jesus
[50:48] i believe let me just say this if if
[50:50] there's anything people ought to be able
[50:52] to do when they look at you when they
[50:54] think about you they should say now that
[50:57] person is a christian
[51:00] that person knows christ just like they
[51:03] did to peter they took note they might
[51:05] be illiterate and didn't know their abcs
[51:07] but they took though that they had been
[51:10] with jesus
[51:12] amen
[51:24] so that first church
[51:26] it was in the image of christ
[51:30] they'll lay hands on the sickness shall
[51:31] recover if any uh if they shall take up
[51:34] serpents and it shall not harm them
[51:37] right
[51:38] paul what didn't paul get bitten
[51:41] paul was a prisoner he was a real good
[51:43] example of a christ christian
[51:45] and didn't
[51:46] say that paul was so much like christ
[51:49] that's why he was chosen for that church
[51:51] age messenger
[51:53] then brother went on down to those
[51:55] others people the people that ones that
[51:57] reflect that christ the closest to
[52:00] is the one that were chosen for the
[52:02] church hp
[52:03] amen
[52:05] not so much that way as it was they
[52:07] lived so close to god am i right
[52:10] god chose them and then we seen their
[52:12] lives that they lined up with that word
[52:14] amen
[52:16] but they reflected but brother brown
[52:18] says that that second eve fell
[52:21] and they're right
[52:22] she fell and went into the dark ages
[52:26] and it got so bad until when we came
[52:28] back up folks we had we had uh
[52:31] all kinds of wrong baptisms wrong gods
[52:34] wrong this wrong that martin luther boy
[52:37] i'll tell you what i could maybe show
[52:39] that film again sometime it was great
[52:41] had he was brought before that pope and
[52:43] that pope says well are you gonna
[52:44] renounce this or not he says i can't
[52:47] with a clear conscience couldn't do it
[52:49] something to that extent
[52:52] i can't do it
[52:55] can't go against my conscience and deny
[52:57] that because it's the truth
[52:59] oh he was a great but then brother bam
[53:01] said he smoked some and drank some
[53:04] huh he still had a drinking problem they
[53:06] thought it was all right to smoke and
[53:07] decent guy to the other
[53:08] wellesley come along and he was a little
[53:10] better it looked a whole lot better
[53:12] didn't it
[53:13] that's why he preached sanctification
[53:15] clean heart queen life and all these
[53:17] things he preached that
[53:19] they made it bring restoration to that
[53:20] masterpiece coming back up a little more
[53:22] to the image
[53:24] come on folks when your baptist friend
[53:26] comes out there and says oh praise be to
[53:27] god and lights up a cigarette it just
[53:29] blows the image of heart
[53:34] you know how many times i might as well
[53:36] just get personal with you
[53:37] brother i'll tell you what you don't
[53:38] know how much i use this chew dip right
[53:41] i still have nightmares
[53:43] of
[53:45] of somewhere in somewhere and and
[53:48] however i'll have a dip in my mouth i'm
[53:50] like what in the world is this thing
[53:51] about
[53:52] get it out of here
[53:54] now it's just a devil may break
[53:56] tormenting me you know
[53:59] because i ain't dip since i quit
[54:01] many many years ago
[54:03] but anyway
[54:05] but it would it would you wouldn't
[54:06] really believe their testimony
[54:10] you know if i come out here i mean a
[54:12] spittoon up here right
[54:14] hey there's people there's preachers
[54:16] sitting preaching there i'll say i got
[54:18] their ashtrays right there
[54:20] people don't think none of it
[54:23] but you and i would
[54:26] defile this temple and god will destroy
[54:28] you
[54:29] amen
[54:30] so on we go think about that there there
[54:33] was certainly not the perfect image it
[54:35] was great what it was great but then the
[54:37] rest they come along and boy well i'll
[54:39] tell you what that was okay but they
[54:40] denominated
[54:42] even they denominated
[54:45] and then a long time pentecost comes the
[54:47] restoration of the gifts
[54:49] huh
[54:50] but we know that the fullness of the
[54:52] holy ghost didn't come until the
[54:53] fullness of the word came
[54:55] is that right and people who oh man they
[54:57] were more happy about the gifts than
[54:59] they were the giver
[55:01] all the speaking in tongues the evidence
[55:03] and so forth and they harp down on that
[55:06] brother brandon come along and says you
[55:08] know it's not so much that because that
[55:09] man back there he can speak in tongues
[55:11] he can prophesy but he's living with
[55:12] another man's wife that ain't gonna that
[55:14] ain't gonna work
[55:16] it may wait for the holy ghost which is
[55:18] christ himself to come back into the
[55:21] church
[55:22] how many believes christ himself has
[55:24] come back into the church
[55:26] he absolutely has
[55:29] because you've got to remember even the
[55:30] prophet taught this that it's just
[55:32] because you don't do a lot of healing
[55:35] somebody else has been perhaps given the
[55:37] gift of healing he's given you the
[55:38] burden of prayer for that person and
[55:41] that person does what he's supposed to
[55:42] do it's a body work
[55:45] and i believe what god did through the
[55:47] prophet of god was a body work
[55:52] huh
[55:55] and so we had the fullness of the word
[55:57] come back the fullness of the word now
[55:59] brother bran taught that we had a lot of
[56:01] reformers but in this hour we had a
[56:03] prophet that come anymore and he's a
[56:06] divine interpreter of the word
[56:08] and we know if this prophet would have
[56:10] taught us something different from this
[56:11] right here
[56:13] we would have never believed it
[56:15] now we wouldn't accept it
[56:17] even an angel sometimes would come and
[56:19] talk to the prophet but he'd have to
[56:21] take it back to the work make sure that
[56:22] the angel is saying what that word said
[56:24] because paul said if anybody come and
[56:26] preach anything else if he's an angel
[56:28] from heaven if he preaches something
[56:30] different let him be a curse
[56:32] it has to line up with the word of god
[56:37] brother brandon preached these things
[56:39] and one time i believe he was a baptist
[56:40] boy of some kind i forget his name but
[56:42] he came up there behind him and says
[56:44] brother that could be the what is it the
[56:46] extra chapter of revelation i think we
[56:49] got 22 chapters or something
[56:51] any third 23rd chapter up that could be
[56:53] another chapter but he was saying he was
[56:55] off the word
[56:58] and i'm not sure if it was him but just
[57:00] after he spoke that
[57:02] is where that prophecy came up because
[57:04] thou has chosen the harder way and all
[57:06] that there's a different one's a
[57:07] frenchman different ones interpreted
[57:08] tongues and interpretation of kong he
[57:10] says that don't need interpretation that
[57:12] was perfect friend and they all wrote
[57:14] down what that spirit said
[57:16] huh
[57:18] christ coming down and proving no that
[57:20] wasn't no extra chapter that was the
[57:22] bible that he taught
[57:24] amen
[57:26] my aren't you glad for that i'm resting
[57:28] on that folks how many of you is resting
[57:29] i'm resting that the prophet of god
[57:31] taught what paul taught
[57:34] that's what they all said over beyond
[57:35] the curtain of time when he says well
[57:37] brother brown says if i'm going to be
[57:39] judged for what i have taught will paul
[57:40] be
[57:41] and they said yep paul's going to have
[57:43] to be preached or he'll be i have to be
[57:44] judged for what he has said well he said
[57:46] well praise be to god then i don't have
[57:48] nothing to worry about because i've
[57:50] saved and i said just what paul said
[57:53] amen whether it's predestination whether
[57:55] it's godhead or whatever it might have
[57:57] been
[57:58] amen
[57:59] so what do we see in this hour we've
[58:01] seen again the image of god restored in
[58:05] the bride in the church
[58:09] amen
[58:12] oh my
[58:14] and this just comes to mind
[58:16] because i want to go through a couple
[58:17] steps is that okay now
[58:20] i've got a page here that talks about
[58:21] one of the first things jesus did was
[58:23] overcome temptation by the devil
[58:25] and we learned how he overcame
[58:29] amen how many wants to follow in the
[58:31] footsteps of christ if you want to be in
[58:33] the image of christ you're going to have
[58:35] to act like him you're going to have to
[58:36] talk like him you're going to have to
[58:38] walk like him you're going to have to
[58:39] breathe like him you're going to have to
[58:40] love like him you're going to have to
[58:42] everything he does if you're going to be
[58:43] in his image
[58:45] amen one of the first things we learned
[58:47] is that when the devil tempted him he
[58:49] got his feather sense he didn't get his
[58:52] other sins with david
[58:53] huh
[58:55] he didn't get his fellowship with moses
[58:56] he got him he had got him to fall but
[58:58] this man here he could not get jesus to
[59:01] fall
[59:03] oh my he overcome temptation
[59:07] [Music]
[59:08] amen on the mountain whether it was
[59:10] making bread or whether it's popularity
[59:13] amen it was
[59:14] unless at the end of lust of the flesh
[59:16] it was all three of those that was
[59:17] presented to him amen and he's got his
[59:19] feathers changed probably god said
[59:21] he hit a hundred thousand volt wire when
[59:24] he come to jesus he said thou shalt not
[59:27] tempt the lord thy god
[59:29] he overcame
[59:30] let me tell you if you are in the image
[59:32] of god you will overcome by the word of
[59:36] god
[59:38] how many believes that and by the word
[59:40] of your testimony
[59:42] every song of god
[59:44] you ever gonna get saved is because i
[59:47] believe the word said by his stripes
[59:49] amen that he shed his blood amen he
[59:51] forgot to love the world that he gave
[59:52] his only begotten son if i believe in
[59:54] him i will not perish but i have
[59:56] everlasting life you believe that with
[59:57] all your heart
[59:59] you come o you overcome by the word of
[1:00:01] god
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:06] praise be to god
[1:00:08] remember the prophet of god was told
[1:00:10] don't you drink or don't you smoke or
[1:00:12] don't you defy your body in any way
[1:00:14] private work for you to do
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:20] now i'm going to say something a little
[1:00:22] strong here
[1:00:23] but the prophet of god overcame before
[1:00:25] he got ever saved
[1:00:28] that right
[1:00:30] you know where can people go to if this
[1:00:32] hey because when that little girl said
[1:00:34] well you're such a you mean you
[1:00:35] don't go to dances and you don't smoke
[1:00:38] huh
[1:00:39] he says well
[1:00:41] you know
[1:00:43] he said give me that cigarette
[1:00:45] he tried to do it
[1:00:46] and a wind came and blew it out wouldn't
[1:00:49] let him remember when he tried to take a
[1:00:51] drink got hand got the shaking because
[1:00:52] he didn't want to be no sister
[1:00:54] sure but god was protecting his gift
[1:00:59] amen
[1:01:01] all right let's look at a couple more
[1:01:02] things
[1:01:04] how many knows that god first of all
[1:01:08] one thing about a characteristic of
[1:01:10] jesus christ was when he began to speak
[1:01:12] when he began to preach
[1:01:14] he did not come with a wishy-washy
[1:01:17] sermon
[1:01:18] he did not come with saying well this
[1:01:20] don't matter and that don't matter he
[1:01:22] said man shall not live by bread alone
[1:01:25] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:01:28] the mouth of god
[1:01:30] amen if you're going to be in the image
[1:01:32] of god you're going to have to believe
[1:01:34] and live on every
[1:01:36] word another characteristic of jesus
[1:01:39] christ was
[1:01:40] he was not rich in this world but he was
[1:01:43] rich in god
[1:01:45] he didn't care so much about whether he
[1:01:47] had food or clothes is that right
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:51] but he said you know oh great how little
[1:01:54] of faith that he had
[1:01:56] he was poor in this world but he was
[1:01:58] rich in god
[1:02:00] and that's the way we got to be
[1:02:02] amen we don't care so much about the
[1:02:04] things of the world as we do the things
[1:02:06] of god sure we're blessed beyond a
[1:02:09] measure isn't that right
[1:02:12] but we come on a wednesday night because
[1:02:15] we care more about god than we do this
[1:02:17] world
[1:02:19] if we possibly can
[1:02:21] we always want to do what the lord's
[1:02:22] what pleases the lord another thing
[1:02:26] amen remember one time he says have you
[1:02:28] got any meat they were hungry and so
[1:02:30] forth have you got anything to eat
[1:02:33] what did jesus say
[1:02:37] my meat is
[1:02:41] to do the father's will
[1:02:43] and they wanted to find out whether they
[1:02:44] had any food i want you to know more
[1:02:47] than eating food more than my necessary
[1:02:50] food
[1:02:51] it's his meat to do the father's will
[1:02:54] his passion was to do what god wanted
[1:02:56] him to do
[1:02:58] if you're going to be in the image of
[1:03:00] god that's going to be your passion
[1:03:05] number two another thing
[1:03:07] he says i always do that which pleases
[1:03:08] the father
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:12] don't we all want to be able to say that
[1:03:13] i always do
[1:03:15] what is pleasing
[1:03:16] to the holy spirit because that's the
[1:03:18] father how many knows that's the father
[1:03:19] the father is the holy ghost
[1:03:22] when jesus shows the father
[1:03:25] he said the father dwelleth in me how
[1:03:27] many knows the spirit come down from up
[1:03:30] there up above and abode on jesus christ
[1:03:33] the bible says he was the fullness of
[1:03:34] the godhead
[1:03:36] bodily when jesus but when thomas says
[1:03:38] my lord and my
[1:03:41] god
[1:03:43] amen
[1:03:45] praise be to god
[1:03:48] he did nothing but what the father
[1:03:51] showed in his meat was to do the father
[1:03:52] did nothing but what the father showed
[1:03:55] him first
[1:03:59] how many knows that's where we fail a
[1:04:00] lot of times it's because we do things
[1:04:03] before god chose us to do it before he
[1:04:05] tells us to do it
[1:04:08] amen
[1:04:09] because i'll tell you right now if
[1:04:10] you'll do only that which the holy
[1:04:12] spirit shows you
[1:04:14] you'll be in good shape
[1:04:16] you'll be following the footsteps of the
[1:04:18] lord
[1:04:19] and i believe that's why it's so
[1:04:21] important and i'm trying to listen i
[1:04:23] don't know about
[1:04:24] every day i'm trying to listen harder
[1:04:27] every day i go down the road and i say
[1:04:29] lord i want a greater relationship today
[1:04:32] than i had yesterday
[1:04:34] i want a deeper walk with you lord than
[1:04:36] what i had yesterday
[1:04:40] because we're getting closer folks
[1:04:44] this comes to mind brother bam says
[1:04:45] you'll either meet him as a masterpiece
[1:04:48] that he's worked on
[1:04:50] or you'll meet him as a floating piece
[1:04:53] of driftwood to go into your final
[1:04:55] destination
[1:04:57] god's working on us
[1:05:00] how many believes that he's working on
[1:05:01] us
[1:05:02] do we always put god first is god first
[1:05:05] in everything
[1:05:08] that's a big thing how many knows that's
[1:05:09] a big thing we've said that a lot around
[1:05:11] here haven't we
[1:05:13] about putting god first
[1:05:16] and you know i just thought of another
[1:05:18] scripture that backs that up
[1:05:21] where the one of the first commandments
[1:05:23] was thou shalt love the lord thy god
[1:05:26] with all thy heart all i might mind soul
[1:05:28] and strength
[1:05:30] you're to love him with all that you got
[1:05:33] that's putting him first
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:36] because if you don't
[1:05:38] you'll get yourself
[1:05:39] in the way
[1:05:41] how many believe that
[1:05:44] amen brother brahma says god wants to
[1:05:47] mold
[1:05:48] and make us what he wants us to be
[1:05:50] but how can he do that how can god do
[1:05:53] that
[1:05:57] do you realize that when brother branham
[1:05:59] was here
[1:06:00] malachi 4 when jesus christ would come
[1:06:02] to the audience and he would discern the
[1:06:04] thoughts
[1:06:05] and the intents of the heart
[1:06:07] we don't have that gift anymore do we
[1:06:10] i don't say that it can't happen you
[1:06:12] know i'm saying but that gift of malachi
[1:06:14] 4 and that gift of that prophet that was
[1:06:16] created so close amen
[1:06:19] i i wish to god we could
[1:06:21] have prophet of god here doing that
[1:06:24] wouldn't you like that
[1:06:26] but to think that jesus christ would
[1:06:28] come down there knew that and then the
[1:06:30] preachers of that hour
[1:06:32] pentecostals of that hour
[1:06:34] would excommunicate anybody that would
[1:06:36] go to them services
[1:06:41] can you imagine that's why brother brown
[1:06:43] says you know how can he do that when we
[1:06:45] will stand still for him to do it we
[1:06:48] want to be our own master that's exactly
[1:06:50] what they want they wanted to do their
[1:06:52] own thing
[1:06:54] oh we should stop there we got to test
[1:06:56] that with ourselves don't we
[1:06:58] to make sure that we're not being our
[1:07:01] own master
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:12] because when he comes folks and he's
[1:07:14] going to come
[1:07:16] images of christ brother bam says you
[1:07:17] know
[1:07:18] i believe he's coming i believe he's
[1:07:20] coming any time now he will come and he
[1:07:22] he's you say to me he says well i've
[1:07:25] heard that for so long but everybody
[1:07:28] says yes one of these days you're going
[1:07:30] to hear that for the last time
[1:07:33] amen you'll say that for one
[1:07:36] last time one of these days while i've
[1:07:37] been waiting for so long we've been
[1:07:39] looking for him so long one of these
[1:07:40] days is the last time and he'll be here
[1:07:44] and we'll either
[1:07:46] be in his image
[1:07:48] or we won't
[1:07:51] amen you see why i'm just taking a few
[1:07:53] things
[1:07:54] i have so many things that you could
[1:07:56] take the life of jesus christ
[1:07:58] and see
[1:07:59] whether we fit in that image or not
[1:08:02] because it's all about growing and right
[1:08:04] it's all about changing it's all about
[1:08:07] getting closer moving up a little higher
[1:08:09] that's what it's all about
[1:08:12] i don't care where you are
[1:08:14] i care about where you want to be
[1:08:17] and i'm telling you here i i know i need
[1:08:19] to grow and i know we all need to grow
[1:08:23] we need to get closer into that image
[1:08:27] amen
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:37] and i believe this
[1:08:39] that we're going to be like enoch
[1:08:42] that had a testimony
[1:08:45] and like jesus
[1:08:47] enoch it says before he was translated
[1:08:50] he had this testimony that he
[1:08:53] pleased
[1:08:54] god
[1:08:55] forget pleasing me forget about worrying
[1:08:58] about whether the pastor is going to get
[1:09:00] onto you or not
[1:09:01] forget about that
[1:09:03] you start thinking about god and you
[1:09:05] think about whether you're pleasing him
[1:09:07] or not
[1:09:08] everything else will be just fine
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:12] or this person or that person
[1:09:15] that's that's what's going to be
[1:09:16] important because if you're doing it
[1:09:17] amen just because you don't want people
[1:09:19] to know or think evil of you or whatever
[1:09:21] no that's not the right reason
[1:09:24] you want to do it because you want to be
[1:09:26] pleasing to the lord
[1:09:32] amen i was thinking mine
[1:09:36] how that sons of god are supposed to
[1:09:40] have the power of god how many believe
[1:09:43] that jesus had the power of god and let
[1:09:48] me tell you something how many brother
[1:09:49] bran i mean our age was the example
[1:09:52] he had the power of god
[1:09:55] like we haven't seen in any other age
[1:09:59] he was surrendered to god i believe he
[1:10:01] was in the image of god
[1:10:03] he was so much in the image of god until
[1:10:06] people began to wonder whether he was
[1:10:07] jesus or not
[1:10:09] but their minds were a little twisted
[1:10:11] when you think a man like that that's
[1:10:13] born of
[1:10:14] sexual desire is jesus
[1:10:18] but they did the same thing with john
[1:10:19] the baptist said are you him
[1:10:23] he had to say no i'm not that's what the
[1:10:25] prophet said no i'm not
[1:10:27] i wonder brothers and sisters
[1:10:30] how much people
[1:10:31] see jesus in us
[1:10:34] amen
[1:10:36] so talk about the power of god
[1:10:38] he had the power and favor of god with
[1:10:42] him
[1:10:45] until he could walk on water if the need
[1:10:47] rose
[1:10:49] amen he had the power
[1:10:52] over the elements
[1:10:55] the prophet of god in our day how many
[1:10:56] knows he had power
[1:10:58] on the mountain
[1:11:00] just
[1:11:01] that the storm was going to just blind
[1:11:02] him and bring him in
[1:11:04] and
[1:11:05] and he was barely going to make it back
[1:11:07] down the hill and the holy spirit says
[1:11:09] turn around and go back up the mountain
[1:11:13] he said who is that speaking to me
[1:11:15] because he couldn't hardly believe it
[1:11:18] all right no doubt the prophet had heard
[1:11:20] that voice many times it to me you would
[1:11:22] think well he would catch on yeah that
[1:11:23] voice listened to it but he wanted to
[1:11:25] make sure is that you speaking to me
[1:11:28] and he said yes go back up go back up
[1:11:30] had to tell him several times but he
[1:11:32] went right back up the mountain up up
[1:11:33] back the wrong way
[1:11:36] and he was there while i'm here
[1:11:39] and the holy spirit said
[1:11:41] speak to the storm
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:47] folks when it comes to speaking
[1:11:49] mountains out of existence
[1:11:52] when it gets when it comes to moving
[1:11:53] mountains and having faith to move
[1:11:55] mountains and doing all that i don't
[1:11:57] know that brother adam ever did that one
[1:11:59] time outside of god telling him first
[1:12:03] i mean he believes you have to
[1:12:05] do nothing until the father shows you
[1:12:07] first
[1:12:08] because if you do it yourself you're
[1:12:10] probably going to be disappointed
[1:12:13] but when the father's told him speak to
[1:12:15] it
[1:12:15] and he says let it quit
[1:12:17] snowing let the sun shine for three days
[1:12:20] come back off the mountain they said man
[1:12:23] it was a huge storm coming
[1:12:26] i imagine it covered several states
[1:12:28] probably don't you
[1:12:29] i mean when they looked at the radar and
[1:12:31] then they say that it just mysteriously
[1:12:35] it just went away
[1:12:39] the prophet knew why
[1:12:41] because he had spoken out of existence
[1:12:43] amen told us what to do
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:47] i'm
[1:12:48] thankful to have had that in this
[1:12:51] generation
[1:12:54] can i say something
[1:12:57] if we would go on another 500 years
[1:12:59] every
[1:13:01] church in the world would be talking
[1:13:02] about what happened in brother branham's
[1:13:04] ministry
[1:13:06] what god did in that manner's ministry
[1:13:08] they finally catch on
[1:13:10] am i right because just like the
[1:13:12] pharisees they talk about moses and so
[1:13:14] forth but it was always later on the
[1:13:16] catholics they bury you know they took
[1:13:18] up the bones of those priests that burnt
[1:13:20] joanne of arc
[1:13:22] you know and proclaimed her a saint so
[1:13:24] much later
[1:13:25] but it was too late then
[1:13:28] amen aren't you glad you catch it now
[1:13:30] see what god has done now in our
[1:13:32] generation
[1:13:34] because if you miss him if you miss what
[1:13:36] god is doing in front of you you missed
[1:13:37] it you missed god
[1:13:39] and the thing of it is god does it in
[1:13:40] such simple
[1:13:42] simple way
[1:13:44] such humble way
[1:13:46] that you have to look down and get way
[1:13:49] down humble to be able to catch it and
[1:13:50] to see it
[1:13:53] and let me tell you something there's a
[1:13:54] mania many a preacher
[1:13:56] that had a phd
[1:13:58] that rebuked brother branham
[1:14:00] you need to go back to grammar school
[1:14:02] you don't say
[1:14:04] how i don't know if it was
[1:14:06] all men
[1:14:08] you don't say amen you say ah amen
[1:14:13] you learn how to talk right you need to
[1:14:15] go talk right
[1:14:17] the brother baby says he pushed me just
[1:14:18] a little bit too much
[1:14:21] he says well i'm giving thousands to the
[1:14:24] lord millions are being delivered of
[1:14:26] sicknesses and diseases
[1:14:28] with my bad grammar what are you doing
[1:14:32] he wasn't doing much at all probably
[1:14:36] he had i'll tell you this he was
[1:14:38] way out of his place
[1:14:41] to correct god's prophet try to tell him
[1:14:43] you need to if god wanted him to have a
[1:14:44] good grammar school education he'd seen
[1:14:47] to it that he got it
[1:14:50] amen
[1:14:51] but it wasn't about the grammar school
[1:14:53] he needed that bad grammar to throw
[1:14:55] people off that thought they were so
[1:14:57] highfalutin
[1:14:58] and so much better than everybody else
[1:15:00] it was the power of god that mattered
[1:15:03] he says them people that i preach to
[1:15:05] don't care if you i say amen or all men
[1:15:09] it was pulpit wasn't it
[1:15:12] it was pulpit that's what it was pulpit
[1:15:14] or pulpit you know it's just a simple
[1:15:16] little you know
[1:15:18] maybe you're from indiana or maybe
[1:15:20] you're from florida i don't know
[1:15:22] we all talk a little different you know
[1:15:26] but anyway
[1:15:27] aren't you glad for the simplicity of
[1:15:29] god
[1:15:33] amen
[1:15:35] had the power of god to walk on water or
[1:15:37] the curse of fig tree or create fish and
[1:15:40] bread and that right he multiplied the
[1:15:42] fish and the loaves
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:47] now i'm never ashamed to say that god
[1:15:49] told the prophet of god
[1:15:51] he says tell speak
[1:15:53] and your squirrel says you're hunting
[1:15:56] into existence speak where they'll be
[1:15:58] and brother brown he says okay
[1:16:01] let one come up out of here and go over
[1:16:03] a branch and a tree that they don't
[1:16:04] climb on and never on that kind of a
[1:16:06] tree
[1:16:07] come up there and stick that that y
[1:16:09] right there the other one go up here
[1:16:11] stitch this one this one over there hey
[1:16:13] you might get half one right per chance
[1:16:16] right
[1:16:17] you might say that no wow here comes a
[1:16:19] squirrel he goes up there and stops but
[1:16:21] when he's three four five times nah
[1:16:24] i don't think so
[1:16:26] gotta be god right
[1:16:28] of course he's gotta be god in the first
[1:16:29] place
[1:16:30] but anybody would want to be a critic
[1:16:33] then they had the power to speak into
[1:16:35] existence
[1:16:40] why
[1:16:41] then we have to ask ourselves because
[1:16:43] how many knows they called
[1:16:45] the children of the prophets we call us
[1:16:46] ourselves the children
[1:16:48] of the prophet
[1:16:49] i call myself a child of the prophet
[1:16:53] and they're right because i follow the
[1:16:54] prophet
[1:16:55] brother bram says you're my children i
[1:16:57] have begotten you to christ
[1:17:00] amen i'm not ashamed of it one bit
[1:17:04] no because he already seen all those
[1:17:06] redeemed over there
[1:17:07] that came in under that ministry
[1:17:11] amen so we ask ourselves tonight on this
[1:17:14] wednesday night
[1:17:16] as we come to another
[1:17:19] one less service that we're going to
[1:17:21] have
[1:17:28] makes you want to it
[1:17:30] just how it'll be but it'll be
[1:17:33] maybe i'll still be up there when the
[1:17:35] shutters down i don't know but it's
[1:17:36] coming
[1:17:38] all of those things is prophesied folks
[1:17:39] it's coming
[1:17:41] remember brother braham said mark it
[1:17:43] down with a iron pen on a steel mountain
[1:17:46] or something like that
[1:17:48] that these things are going to happen
[1:17:50] they're coming
[1:17:52] images of christ
[1:17:54] brother branham at the end of it he says
[1:17:55] brother he said america
[1:17:57] and then he said not just this nation
[1:17:59] but he said all nations
[1:18:02] they're done
[1:18:03] they're finished
[1:18:05] it's time for another one
[1:18:07] a kingdom
[1:18:08] that shall never end how many wants to
[1:18:10] be in part of that kingdom how many
[1:18:12] wants to be in the image of christ how
[1:18:14] many would say lord
[1:18:16] continue
[1:18:17] to work on me lord
[1:18:19] let me read my bible let me look at the
[1:18:22] perfect masterpiece and that's jesus
[1:18:24] christ brother branham he was a
[1:18:26] masterpiece he was he was he was very
[1:18:28] much in the image of christ but he's not
[1:18:30] the perfect masterpiece christ is the
[1:18:33] only
[1:18:34] perfect masterpiece
[1:18:35] brother ma'am still got to tell you and
[1:18:37] confess to you about his lies
[1:18:39] and their right about his disobedience
[1:18:41] in africa cost him years of hardship and
[1:18:43] so forth he was human
[1:18:45] but for a
[1:18:47] human that had a lot of mistakes
[1:18:50] he reflected christ greatly
[1:18:54] more than anybody else in this
[1:18:55] generation
[1:18:57] but you got to remember
[1:18:59] that
[1:19:00] example and that ministry was for who
[1:19:09] me it was for you
[1:19:11] it was for this time
[1:19:13] it's
[1:19:14] to give us strength for what we're
[1:19:16] facing for what's coming
[1:19:18] it was to mold us it was to shape us
[1:19:21] into the image of christ
[1:19:24] that's what god predestinated us to be
[1:19:26] that's to be the image of christ
[1:19:32] because god is how many believes god is
[1:19:34] coming for a masterpiece
[1:19:36] he's coming for a masterpiece
[1:19:38] he's coming for
[1:19:40] one without spot
[1:19:42] and without wrinkle
[1:19:44] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:19:46] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:19:48] for it that he might sanctify and
[1:19:50] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[1:19:52] by the word then he might present it to
[1:19:54] himself
[1:19:55] a glorious church
[1:19:57] not having spot
[1:19:59] or wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:20:03] should be holy
[1:20:04] and without
[1:20:06] blemish
