and then saturday be the wedding so praise the lord amen that's just power heads kind heavenly father we just once again lord demon the grand privilege lord to be able to assemble ourselves together with believers of like faith lord jesus and just to pull from the gift of god and god you'd come in a special way this morning we believe lord that you can do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think and so lord we would ask god you would just open us up father to be able to receive all that you would have for us this morning and lord with your blessings that you've bestowed upon us thank you for the health that you've given each and every one of us lord and lord jesus if we would just begin to write down all of your blessings lord we couldn't and begin to number them all father so we just want you to know that we love you with all of our hearts teachers our thanks and gratitude for your goodness to us lord forgive us all of any shortcomings any failures lord jesus we would first ask lord we want to make sure everything's under the blood of jesus christ god that we would be a clear channel lord jesus for you to work through lord jesus and the ears would be able to hear what the spirit saith to the church lord this morning father we just yield ourselves see lord and as we open your bible this morning we would ask god that you would be the one lord to give us the true meaning of it lord the true understanding of it by revelation father today and lord we just commit ourselves to you now in jesus christ's name don't know why i guess just why the lord asked me to go this way uh i guess i do know it's certainly fitting amen for him to go in the way that we're going this morning amen i want to first start with establishing something in revelation so we want to talk about the three angels to begin with the three angels amen and then what brother branham said about him amen because how many believes anything we minister we want to be based on what the prophet taught because we certainly wouldn't be qualified to try to interpret or speak or teach something out of the book of revelations without amen a prophet so in revelations the 14th chapter if you will go with me revelations 14. and we want to focus this more on the third angel's message chapter 14 in verse 6. and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters and there followed him another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen the great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in this presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whoso receiveth the mark of his name here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus may god had his blessings to reading the word you can be seated this morning amen i'd like to do a little study this morning with the help of the lord amen uh and i i feel like i kind of even before i read some of the things that is in here in manfield felt like i was impressed upon speaking on the mark of the beast amen would that be all right let's talk about the mark of the beast amen and we probably touch a little bit on the seal of god also if you'll notice there's a difference there's one that is called a mark and the other one is a seal amen one is a sealed and the other one is a mark amen so let me just say this out of uh brother brandon preaching on the mark of the beast he says now you see how it was represented in ezekiel the ninth chapter at jerusalem amen and now we come to revelation now that's a whole other sermon in itself but i want to recap just a little bit about ezekiel because if you remember ezekiel you remember that the white angel with the ink horn remember the one with the ink horn and he told him to go into the city and to mark everybody that sighs and cries for the abomination that's done in the city amen and all those that are marked mark them all and and the rest of them and then of course after that happened after he went through there and after he marked them afterwards came the angels so with the slaughtering weapons right and i understand through the prophet of god that that happened amen whenever uh you know first of all those that were sealed in jerusalem and then titus 96 a.d was went into jerusalem and utterly killed every man woman and child until the blood was running down the streets and that right they besieged it and they killed everybody and everything amen and so there was a great destruction that happened in israel and so forth because of those those uh the marking first of all and then out came the destruction and that's where you and i are at this morning amen we're at that place where there is a marking going on amen because we are on the threshold again and this is going to be focusing once again towards the coming of the lord because we certainly don't ever want to get our eyes off of that amen because we know that it's going to happen we don't know why really i i don't see why it hasn't happened already man it's surprising that it hasn't happened already so the way i feel this morning and i don't know about you but i feel this morning in my heart like in revelations the last chapter says even so lord jesus come we're ready for him to come and waiting for him to come so we find out that now i want to just read this year to kind of lay a foundation now if you notice here he says now we come to revelation for you that's your pencils to write this down i'd like uh you to write down revelations 14 6-12 which is what we just read that's the three last angels three angels after the seven angels that were special there were three special angels come forth did you notice that i want you to notice them three last angels the first angel has sounded the trumpet of the gospel and had the everlasting gospel preached to all the world the second angel kind of preached a holiness gospel amen because he was that the church had committed foreign church had committed fornication and the third angel roared out to escape the mark of the beast amen he says now watch the first angel in the reformation luther second wesleyan reformation he straightened out the church and so forth but the third pentecostal message should be the true messenger warning them to escape the mark of the beast saying whosoever receives the mark of the beast the same shall drink of the wrath of god poured out without mixture into the cup of indignation being poured out upon the people that's the very message today the third angel third message last message luther's message justification wesley sanctification pentecost the seal of god escape the mark of the beast come out from them big walls of babylon and be sealed into the kingdom of god amen so how many believes that's what we are we're at that place where we have to get out of there get out of babylon and get sealed into the kingdom of god amen all right so i want to talk a little bit about something that brother brown said that there'll come a time and this is about to squeeze but that's down under a little bit but no here it is holy is holy still and brother bam says talk talking about the screens before it's come a time that it'll be to the total loss then amen so you and i we all realize that we're on the brink of something i don't know about you but i can feel that we're on the brink of something brother branham felt it back in his day we feel like it's in our day and with things going like they are i feel like things are beginning to uh roll a little bit faster so to speak snowball in that right and i think brother ben talked about how that in jesus last hours of his life how did he fulfill more scripture so many more scriptures than during his time folks we're so used to having it nice amen the world is very used to having it nice but they don't realize that just as sure sodom and gomorrah was burnt to the ground in that right just as sure as the days of noah the whole world was flooded and destroyed that's what's right ahead of us amen that's what's ahead for the world and not too far from now but what was this according to what we have read now he talked about it this third angel's message amen that it was a call to come out and to receive the seal of god amen i got a quite a few quotes on what brother bob said was the mark of the beast and what the seal of god is amen we want to know that right because we realize one thing about the seal of god and and the mark of the beast is that the mark of the beast you know you know it's not going to be communism or some you know something that comes out of north korea amen it's not going to be an atheistic kind of a thing it's going to be so close that if it was possible it would deceive the very elected amen and so i believe that the bride of jesus christ has to be on our toes if this last message that we hear amen was a call for us to be sure not to take the mark of the beast because everybody that takes this mark amen they're going to be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of god and all the holy angels amen there will not be any rest day or night people's not going to get any sleep it's going to bad day for those who receive the mark amen all right let me just uh let me say say it another place in 1961 i believe he said once again he mentions the third angel he says now listen he says now this is the third angel's message to the world and you know what the third angel's message is it's going forth now in this day amen and this is the flying war to amen and in revelations the 11th chapter and verse 14 the second woe is past and behold the third woe cometh quickly and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever so how many knows after this third angel sounding forth after the third woe goes forth the kingdoms of this world are going to become the kingdoms of god amen and that's what you and i are looking for amen where there's not going to be any of this amen no there's not going to be any strife between the nations the devil's not going to rule the nations anymore god is going to rule nations how many looking forward for that i'm looking for god to have for him to rule the nations you know hi this morning we get up in the morning we get dressed and we get ready we break me eat our breakfast we pray and and we study and we come to church amen because we are doing what we are getting ready to rule and reign with christ for a thousand years and not just a thousand years but through all of eternity that's what you and i are striving for but you know like we were talking about wednesday if we aren't careful we'll allow the deceitfulness of riches and so forth choke out the word amen true call our spiritual walk with god it'll cause us to get lukewarm which is one of their characteristics of the mark of the beast is to be lukewarm come on folks a layout is here he ain't gonna take nobody in that's lukewarm amen they were spewed out of their mouth when they were in lukewarm amen but it's part of that antichrist system amen and so forth but we want to get into detail a little bit with what what the mark of the beast is because we have to go all the way back amen not only into genesis but way back amen just just look where it come from now notice what he said so that's right now notice he says that's right and we're at the end of the road amen now in revelation 17th chapter it says that the catholic church was a heart with a heart with the great heart revelation 17 and verse 5 and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great mother of harlots and abominations of the earth amen now notice he goes a little bit further and the protestant churches notice that it's the catholic church old thing come out of babylon i mean those it's babylon it's confusion out there look at all the different religions and look at everything oh my there ain't nothing you can't do out there and belong to our church you can even be a homosexual if you want hello that's what it's like it's a it's a babylon amen how many believes we're called out of that be not partakers of our sins that you be not part of god so that's god's calling for the god of babylon verse 8 18 verse 2 it says and he cried mightily this well let me read with what number verse 1 after he thinks i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice amen saying great baffled word for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies amen you don't want to know where all the every every financial and everything is tied to it's all tied to rome i mean those they are the ones that own the gold of the world yeah and we're certainly going to need some help aren't we amen we're fixing to go about four trillion dollars more into that if they can help it here within six months four million amen and you and i are enjoying a little bit of that four trillion right i got once again i i you know if i take my farm but i took the check oh my isn't that right you know it's amazing here we are where we are and they give money that people don't need it folks you ain't got to be a welfare person to get charity they want to give it to you they look for excuses to get we're all kind of charity lovers now anyway well that's about what it is oh i got you now but anyway think about it and what you know it is you know i don't know about you but brother brad if i had my finances i'd be broke as broke as could be i i'd be bankrupt if i just went and give everybody money i didn't have i mean it's been like me going to the elk bank now yeah let me get about 100 000 dollars i'm going to give you all a bunch of i'm going to give it all to y'all don't worry about it we just forgive you huh what's going on folks it makes you wanted on it but listen how many knows is all it's all for a plan it's all for a reason amen amen but here it says that you know the whole nations all of them were made rich to the abundance of her delicacies but you know i heard another voice come come from heaven saying come out of her my people that you but not partakers of her sins and that you receive not ever play i don't but with any of the wrath of god i don't want to have to amen oh my when you read the woes and the plagues and the sores that come upon people and the torment that they have to deal with and so forth amen because of the plague folks i'm going to tell you it's going to be a bad place after a while amen for her sins have reached into heaven and god has remembered her iniquities that's why he's saying come out amen don't be a part of that don't be a part of that beast amen don't be a part of the beast praise be to god and that's the last angel's message listen the last angel's message and warning was be not partakers of our sins come out and separate yourself listen to what the prophet says he says now you're either going to wear one mark today other than the other there's no middle ground either the mark of the beast which is the apostate church are the seal of god leaving this door either leaves with the mark of god or the mark of the enemy praise be to god how many believes that you and i this morning can i say this that you sit there with one of those things mark of the beast amen oh my praise be to god oh my so we look at that and we see that we have to have one or the other because the scripture says it this way it says in revelations the 8th chapter and verse 13 it says you know 8-13 no 13-8 backwards that's what happens all right and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world how many another place it says and all the world wandered after the beast now let me tell you something you might not think so but after studying this and realizing this it isn't going to be hard to deceive people because people people are pretty blind to begin with humanity human beings you as a person me as a person are pretty blind people amen why do i say that i say that because i will say this outside of the eyes of the holy ghost you are going to be deceived you have to have the eyes of the holy ghost or you're going to think you're okay and that you're right huh you that's what man is going to be over i thought about but he wasn't you didn't have the holy ghost down in your soul first of all let me say this because it's very deceiving because we know amen that the spirit can be poured out upon all flesh the bible says but not all flesh is saved so you can have it in your flesh praise be to god i feel good today hello you can have it on your flesh you can have it even in your spirit oh brother i love you you're so wonderful i just love everybody you can have it in your spirit but let something happen and then way down in that soul it hasn't been changed yet those things are still there huh hatred variance jealousy malice amen and that's actually part of that mark that's what cain had isn't that right amen but if you don't get it down in your soul amen you'll be deceived and there'll be millions and millions and billions of people deceived thinking they're sealed in when they're not and let me say this i truly believe that only baptism of the holy ghost will keep you from being deceived that's the only way and that's in your soul amen my let's start now we find out that because that cain listened to the enemy then what happened jealousy on earth now this beast mark of the beast how many knows it came according to saint john 3 12 i believe it is not as cain who was of that wicked one i mean notice that cain was the son of the beast the most subtle beast of the field cain was the son of him in that right and because that eve had a relationship with that beast and could intermingle in that right and after that happened god cursed that animal he was the most subtle he was the most smartest as we were told the most good-looking most handsome most beautiful beast that there was and he could actually talk and communicate that's right and he communicated with eve and he got her to fall isn't that right amen and if she had a child one was kane and then she said the bible says yet another man amen which was able amen and fine come to find out one of them was mean and a snake yet jealous he had hatred he had variance humiliation wrath despite murder deceit debate all those were marks and traits of that beast nature praise be to god we find that mark amen because how many of us we are mark we're mark because our life tells us who we are it tells us what we are amen so we find that cain here it's listen he says he became the first one that had jealousy tell me where that pure line of god came from adam he says that's the only connection adam was the son of god amen where did that jealousy come from where did that murder come from where did that all kind of a spirit come from out of adam no couldn't have it come from satan that's exactly where it came from now we find out that he was the first murderer but he was the first one to have jealousy we go on back even into heaven if you'll notice how many knows that he was jealous yes he was very jealous let me say one more mark that tells a person that they have perhaps that beast nature is when they are jealous of those that god does bless jealous of those that god actually blesses and want to kill those that god actually blesses try to get rid of god's people chose the mark of the beast that all right because that was what mark cain had in him and we know he was marked god set a mark on cage he was the first man to ever get a mark to get that mark that he was of the devil amen hatred it's of the devil jealousy it's of the devil but it didn't start with uh with cain it started with luke wanted some of that glory he wants some of that pride he wanted some of that amanda praise that michael was getting and he brought it down to the earth and transferred it into man amen better batman says if you want to find anything you go back to genesis that's where it started and we followed in revelations they made it become a great big babylon and we see in our day what we call it's coming down to the forcing forcing the mark amen well i'll read you a couple quotes like everything's certainly calling towards it faster faster and faster and faster folks you better wake up when a piece of plywood is 94 dollars a sheet huh osb that was eight dollars is now thirty four dollars and not coming back down huh in inflation and so forth about him amen he was jealous just like lucifer was up in heaven he come down and he put it into mankind and here he was and abel was there cain was there abel offered a sacrifice to god and noticed this that those who have the mark of the beast better bam says it's not out there to atheism it's in churches that's where the mark of the beast is oh i got the mark of the beast i have no desire to serve god i hate god this saturday no that's called blasphemy of the holy ghost huh but the mark of the beast is to think it's your religious and to be pious and to be very religious and think you're right when you're not another mark is is that when you mix good and evil together amen you got a good tree but you mix all of the evil in with it amen that's right how many knows god it's a mixed tree all right let me see here so let's look at kane for just a little bit he had he had envy he had jealousy he had hatred and it led to murder how many knows that even jesus said he was a murderer from the beginning the devil has always been a murderer you say well i'm not a murderer do you say something bad about somebody behind their back then you're a murderer huh everybody said say something bad about your pastor a preacher you might as well shot him in the back you're a murderer you'll answer for it on the day of judgment that's exactly right for murder why because you kill his influence that's right you kill his influence and so guess what you'll answer for that i mean believe we got to watch what we say a child of god is careful about what they say that's the devil's business he can't get rid of you just kill his influence try to worry he has no influence on another body praise be to god so how many knows you christian the devil is going to come after you oh yeah you're going to have a battle amen if you're a christian cain here he was not accepted abel's sacrifice his offerings were ables were accepted i don't know about you but that's what we all want to be right we want to be accepted by god and you come god's way if you're going to be accepted not your way you know what another mark of the beast is one of the marks of the beast is that you worship god and you praise god you go to church and you do your religion do it you want to do it that's how it's going to be god can take it or you can leave it that's a mark that you marked by the devil amen because that's how king's religion was he could do it his way even after he was told the truth and which way he should do it you know right he was given the revelation so to speak to do if he'd just followed it but now how many knows that abel had a revelation that it wasn't the fruit of the trees because cain brought the fruit he brought oranges and apples and all these other things you know and what not you know but can't i'm able he had a revelation that he had to do with blood it had to do with conception it had to do with the people amen and human beings and he went and took a lamb how did abel know to take a land huh he probably had a revelation you know i'm gonna have to take something innocent that's pure there's nothing more pure and innocent than the lambs or he grabbed the land and we begin to hack it to pieces and brother baby i heard him say yesterday that cain killed abel and he died on the same rock that he killed the lamb on he says that's a type of you and i exactly where jesus died amen he was the rock and he died where the lamb dies you also have to die to yourself with your lamb i mean please that's truly the way amen to be a christian is to die amen to yourself when the bible says something and well i don't have to you're not dead yet when the bible says something you say that's right let me humble myself what was it whether we talk about how many one thing that god calls us to do is to humble ourselves it humbles it causes you to humble yourself and submit yourself to the word of god you can't do that because we as human beings we have a tendency to go the other direction we have like to live by pride be proud be the greatest be the best and so forth we don't be no footwash funky we don't be no doormat we don't want to be the least the lowest we don't want to be that but that's the way you'll be the greatest in the kingdom of god when you realize here you're nobody amen number two one of the other things that shows and this is really this is really what gives you mark of the beast this is where it lays at that is to reject the truth when it's put in front of you that is what earns you the mark of the beast and remember where does the truth come through the five-fold ministry that's where the truth comes he's a man of god telling you the truth you're not reject you're rejecting god amen and god have mercy on people's soul it's only the grace of god that will ever give you grace to repent of that because he don't have to he sure don't have to because if he ever bores you in the ear huh faith comes by hearing the mark comes by hearing cain the main mark that he had is god told him the truth and he walked away from i just can't humble myself i just can't do that i i can't do that wasn't that the pharisees and the scribes problems that's exactly what their problem was they they couldn't humble themselves because they thought that jesus was a nobody illegitimate giant a really nobody and yet he had this following and everybody would follow him and so forth they were jealous of him they didn't want to humble themselves and say that is the messiah folks we need to follow it they couldn't do that huh because they had a mark of unbelief unbelief and rejection when the truth is presented to people and they reject it we all know the story of the old testament right that every 50th year they had a set rules that if you got into debt if you got to be somebody's children or somebody slave no matter what it was after the 50 years a trumpet would be blown that everybody goes back to their natural state you get your land back you can go free you got no huh that's right but son of a man the master he gave him ribeye every night he gave him some good black wall of ice cream or mine would be calling ice cream i mean they had knives they had a bed big bag a lot of them say look look i don't want to go back i'm happy here huh why would they do that when they did not want to go free come here i'm gonna use for an example reese would take them guys come here come here come with me come on with me you don't want to go free huh all right come over here stand right there in front of everybody you take them up in front of everybody it's there right there and all of some kind isn't it right he said hey wear that all your life you can't never go free now you got to be his slave forever next 50 years if you live that long hear that trumpet sound you say i'm tired of this my master beat me and i'll tell you i don't want to do this no more please he says sorry you made your decision 50 years ago you can never go free thank you buddy that's what they do and then oh and they would could never be free my what a horrible thing to know that you can never be free listen lebron says about the mark of the beast he says you see what the market is oh well i know come on folks it's a relationship between you and god it's not what everybody else does or don't do not whether you can do it if you get away with the church organization that you're depending on where it come from do you realize the bible said he that beast receives his mark or the letter of his name in the forehead or hand see that's not or deed amen it's what you believe in the forehead what you believe marx i don't believe it no prophet you just told me that you got a mark in your head i see a big old mark right there you can't believe the word how about but abandonment he had that man uh said man i don't care if you would do whatever you would do i'd still not believe he says of course not it's not for unbelievers now how many knows truly unbelief is the mark because he that believeth not is damned already amen so he says it's either knowledge or it's deed nobody believes you really want to watch who you hang with you want to be very careful about who you support because it's the right hand the fellowship huh the right hand of fellowship in your hand what you fellowship with i mean what you partake of because what if you know a bad organization you're supporting that bad organization and that's a mark we are marked by who we hang with the company that we keep that right we partake just like her come out don't partake of her don't take your hand don't partake of her sins that you receive not of your plagues amen when we found out without one mistake that the mark of the beast is the mark of apostasy that is church members hanging around to their church instead of walking in the light praise be to god another one is that cain refused choose to go on far there with god deeper into revelation people that have the mark of the beast and churches that have the mark of the beast well this is what we believe and you can't come and teach us anything else they put a period behind what they believe they can't go on and they reject the truth if he that just went on it came when it went on say look i'm wrong i repent amen god had to accept him he said will y'all not be accepted if you do like abel that's another mark that's why denominations with a period why do you think brother bram stressed so much don't put a period and i won't uh come on be careful i see things a lot different than a message than what i did 20 years ago you didn't just catch it all one day and that's it no we gotta learn we gotta grow god's the only one that can put a bear period behind but he believes because he's got it perfect already amen if every thought he has is perfect amen but not us amen so that was one of the things about and another thing another thing that shows the mark of the beast is formal religion formal well i came to church this morning just like i did last sunday last wednesday last year last month see what brother bottle has to say today see what preacher up there see what they have to say just you know and never really change never change it's a mark of the beast king never changed did you just become formal this is how i'm going to do it you don't think that he went into the land of nod i'm not talking about sleep the land of not and started another church sure his descendants did his descendants became scientists small art inventors huh you know right they perfected the music and everything else contemporary they had gospel rock music huh i either hid southern gospel or bluegrass you know i don't go to hitting them rock stuff but that's what cain did they were they they could flat place music hello you can you can hear it today how many knows you can hear it today sure you listen to some of them and all of a sudden you know praise the lord i'm like ah that's what i did when i was out in the world i don't want to hear that again yeah that's mark of the beast amen to just blend it amen praise the lord or to think you know that you're good enough i'm no if what the brother baby says the church and the pastor is not moving forward and growing every day amen that's all right without a mistake hanging around church instead of walking in the they reject the light and then there's nothing left but darkness that's right both catholic and protestants harlot daughters amen when they broke forth they were virgins from that day and they organized and bringing people down there back into thinking smile and everything else maybe not wear men's clothing but wear a skirt that you've absolutely the skins almost on the outside huh but i'm talking about pentecost and how they did jumping around and everything else makes god sick to his stomach and brother behind me mix again he makes a statement he says there's only going to be two classes of people in this last day both of them is going to wear a mark the mark of god is the baptism of the holy ghost without a shadow of a doubt amen how many knows ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed amen you that's truly got the baptism the holy ghost you that truly got saved 20 30 years ago amen i was 20 i guess about 20 years old when i got sealed with the holy ghost when god gave me the holy ghost 20 30 40 50 60. that's about 40 years i can figure that one out 39 years amen because you don't lose it i mean no you don't lose it whereby you are sealed until the next revival sealed until the next great big problem that comes your way no no sealed until the day of your going away that's why i said just hang in there if you know that you're saved if you know you've been born again you ought to be the happiest person in the world when you find that the devil comes into your life and he tries to make you lukewarm about your religion when he tries to break jealousy when he tries to beat envy when he tries to make hatred hello when he tries to bring those things into your life and make you miserable make you lukewarm and you recognize it how many knows you're gonna recognize the holy ghost here thomas bible don't you get back slit on god don't you get lukewarm on god now don't you go backwards we're going forward we're going to meet the lord one of these days amen coming to the coming of the lord is so great a secret until brother batman the seventh seal talked about it's a coming lord nobody knows about it nobody knows the day nobody knows the hour we don't know just how it's going to be amen but it'll happen it's going to happen one of these days folks and i want to be in it don't you oh my that's right people think that this is just gonna go on and on and on it's not always gonna go on like this folks no it's not there's coming a rapture and that are those that are marked with the beast will stay amen let's talk about another category of people for a second how about the foolish virgin huh maybe message people that live a pretty clean pretty decent life but they really haven't gotten the holy ghost oh there wasn't smoke or drink or all the other stuff no they're too good for that they're clean but they're not filled with the how holy ghost not the power to amen to rejoice and to live a life worthy of the gospel make you love everybody to reach out to the neighbors to do something for god just it just don't have their lamp stream because remember even brother bam said back in his day scientists said they was three minutes to midnight and i happen to believe that we hit them in that hour because if you notice at midnight there was a song that went forth that said grize and trim your lamps how many believes that's that message as far as i can concern and there was a message rise and trim your lamps the wise came up they why god wise and trim their lamps got all of that stuff off of their life that causes them not to shine like they should but the foolish didn't have any oil in their lamps let me light that light take a lamp up let me light that light i want to be on fire for god let me light that light huh it burns a little bit out it goes burns a little bit out it goes why does it go out that's right brother stephen thank you because there's no oil in it you can't light a light without oil you know what happens to the foolish virgins they get hunted down and shot in the head like dogs and they're right carnegie's probably god that's right they still want to have their testimony and they'll have to give their lives for their testimony because they didn't have any oil amen the bride's not here at that time pride is gone we leave when the squeeze comes they squeeze this out that's right that's why i'm seeing brothers and sisters the signs of the time the squeeze is coming down quick praise the lord let it come i'm ready for it let it come our jobs our bank account money it isn't going to mean that much one of these days then we're going to ask ourselves what did we do on those sunday mornings what would we do on those weeks that we had week after week after week when the preacher told us he better be ready not just ready but waiting how many remember brother brown says you in tucson you in arizona you press god you waiting waiting on the coming of the lord that's how we are this morning folks so many years down the road we better be ready and waiting on the coming of the lord and as straight and as narrow as the path is hello i think we should all ask ourselves am i walking that narrow path that straight road am i going to broadway my way however i want to amen all right so he says and then that all that was not sealed by the holy ghost was took on the mark of the beast and the mark of the beast is the mark of apostasy which is rejecting the holy ghost how many knows that judas was one that rejected the holy ghost even brother brahm said he was sanctified he was clean he was called he was justified judas was sanctified but when it come time to go to pentecost he never went did he never went to the baptism of the holy ghost in his soul that right that's what what happened with judas and then brother bran says that the denominations have done the same thing they came through justification they came through sanctification isn't that right they even had the gifts of tongues they even have the gifts of the spirit but when it came to living the life when it came to accepting the full word of god they put him on the outside they ought to see it right that church put him out lean that to your own understanding brother branham clearly explains it anybody go down there we'll excommunicate him go to the meetings we'll excommunicate him one man said you know brother branham i had to put a man out because he went to your meetings well brother brown says so what so that means he's not going to make it to heaven he says you mean you're a presbyter and you believe that get off the phone mister only time i ever knew a brother man i'm practically hanging up on somebody huh what was it they leaned to their own understanding they rejected the word of god folks they took the mark of the beast because brother branham clearly tells us that the mark of the beast that's what it is today the seal of god is the holy spirit to reject it is the mark of the beast amen ever who sees the holy ghost that you're supposed to receive it and then don't do it automatically take the mark of the beast because there's only two classes that exists amen all that didn't have the seal of god had the mark of the beast so to receive the seal of god is to receive the holy ghost to reject it is to have the mark of the beast and there's the whole thing that's exactly right and remember brother bam says that this is not just something that's happened in our day this happened in every age the mark of the beast has been going on in every age because why people either receive what god had or they rejected what god had they either took that mark of unbelief like cain or they received the blessings of god amen and you and i we're living in the hour when the when when it's been exposed how many knows never before i don't believe ever before have we understood what the mark of the beast is like we do today mark of organization mark of formal religion even coming to church and oh and it's a dread huh it sure ain't the holy ghost hello because that's what israel had done they got to where it was just the form just like it was with cain it was just a form to make themselves feel better but never go on to the full baptism of the holy ghost i trust and hope because it's my heart's desire as a pastor that every one of us has the baptism of the holy ghost in our soul because if you don't you're going to be left behind don't reject the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul and believe me it's not so hard to do it's not so hard to do amen think about that the mark of leadership is what lukewarmness have need of nothing rich and increased with goods huh isn't that where we're living we're living in a layout of cih when the world we act like we're super rich when we're super broke wretched miserable poor blind and naked and the worst part of it all is people don't know it how many truly believes that it takes the holy spirit to come into your life and show you where you're wrong [Music] [Applause] it takes god because you will look through the eyes of the spirit that you have on your mind will absolutely think according to the spirit that you have on you denominations they thought hey i don't have to accept that i don't have to believe that but god loved this world so much hello god loved this age so much that he didn't just have somebody like uh billy graham or roberts come and preach the gospel because billy graham was very effective in preaching the gospel that it's for all whosoever will come repent amen and they came and they repented they repented they repented but they never got filled with the holy ghost they wearied themselves to find the door and god could adjust because that's basically possible go preach the gospel he didn't believe that his baptized shall be saved he didn't believe in that shall be them but brother brahm says god doesn't go just there but and then he still loves the people more and he goes and he shows signs and wonders to try to what to get the people to believe how many knows that was brother branham's ministry was you know he said these miracles it's to attract the attention of people oh my did you hear about the healings that are going forth man they'd go home and tell grandma my cousin my uncle you've got cancer you can't see you've got to come to these meetings god is coming and opening the eyes and they come and every every day that brother branham would stay in there longer they would multiply perhaps another time as many as what they had the night before because of the word that would spread it had such an outreach if god was merciful so this is what i'll do to try to get the people to believe not in evolution but that there is a god that he is a healer and it wasn't just the heal of people but he was trying to get the people to believe what he says try to get him to believe the word how many knows they all why not the prophet of god they all wanted that but when he preached the seals hello when he preached the seals and he said denominationalism is absolutely the mark of the beast was too much for them right they couldn't handle the word just like they did in jesus they came to him and their mother had 70 they had thousands 3 000 and all kinds of people say unless you eat my flesh and you drink my blood you have no part with me they scratched their heads my gracious my gracious my gracious what's he gonna do slit his risk and put it in a cup and make us all drink his blood what's he going to do take chunks of his flesh huh and give us a piece of his flesh to eat they had no revelation did they probably god had said he said it thinned down the crowd probably god sometimes preached or preached to thin down the crowd and it worked all the seven he says who can hear this saying who can who you know who's the idiot enough to follow this guy who's idiot enough to listen to what he's got to say i'm out here and they said they all left and how many knows that's what happened in our day god did all those signs all those wonders and then he told the truth about the mark of the beast organization and everything else and they all pick their hands off amen let's talk about the squeeze for just a minute should that be all right brother brandon means talking about the third pool amen of course being the opening of the word for one he said a lot about the third pole isn't that right being the speaking of the word creating of squirrels different things like that am i right he says now remember i'm going to say something to you now that i haven't said all along and that is the thing that we have looked for for so long or at least the last few years he says now the third pool has been vindicated i'm sure you all know it now remember there'll never be any impersonation of that because it can't cannot be i'm warned of this that soon listen it is to identify its presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up and when it does now the pentecostals they can impersonate almost anything get done but when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you have seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power how many knows we really do not know just what our futures is going to be we do know one thing and that is that it's going to get worse not better it made right now it seems like things are pretty good but not they're getting worse they're getting worse fast amen but it'll be manifested in its fullness of his power listen this will be the thing that to my opinion this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away see i must lay quiet for just a little while listen to you who's listening to this tape you might see some strange in my ministry like dropping back not going forward 1963 isn't that exactly what the prophet did barely had any open doors just here and there and he kind of receded kind of went the other way because he had been rejected he went to phoenix three years been out there he said none of them invited him to his churches so he was dropping back and he says lay and quiet until this something else catches up you might see it dropping back right now at this age here we can't go any further we have to wait here just a minute until this happens over here watch up how many knows he was a prophet of god he could see the future he knew things he knew there would be some time for perhaps these prophecies and the things that he said would have to catch up how many believes with me this morning it's catching up it's catching up folks yes it is then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified he says there's coming a time upon this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power of the first beast before it according to revelations the 13th chapter it clearly dis states it revelation 13 i want to just read it of course he talks about us being that lamb that come up out of the earth isn't that right with the two horns and so forth but it says and let me just read this here about revelations talking about causes both rich and poor and he that had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast was all now i heard another band say nobody's exempt rich poor free bound whatever it is he causes all both great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads amen folks i don't know about you but i'm watching very closely about anything that would cause you to have to believe like they do because we certainly have some doctrines and things going on out there that if you don't see it their way isn't that right then you're gonna get it if you don't participate in this in your hand or in your head right don't participate in this we'll cut you off because we know that this is something as simple as a boycott a financial squeeze can't buy or sell unless you participate in it so keep your eyes open keep your ears open be careful because that's what it'll come down to then maybe not come and threaten you with a gun into your forehead but according to the scriptures you won't be able to buy or sell get groceries i mean i might say something if you don't get onto me too bad this afternoon but it's she wondering donna wonders why in the world you know you can go into walmart store and they'll have it there but if you ordered online guess what this is not available for her pickup you know hey let me tell you bill you know you look at you look at what's been bought off the banks and that right our car dealerships here in the years past paid for by the government now they're coming down into our small business and they're giving us money something's fishy here folks isn't that right that's right and i'm just telling you i believe it i believe it's right it's coming close this mark of the beast or should i say i won't say the mark of the beast the mark of the beast is here already mark of the beast is here every time you come to church whether you receive god's word or not you get marked but the forcing of it the forcing of it is what it's all about amen to receive and that no my man can buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name amen and of course here is wisdom that he would have understanding amen count the number of the beasts for it is the number of a man and his number is 600 and three score and skip six and of course we have to get into the pope catholics and how they own the girl of the world how did jews own the stocks in that right amen and so we find that that 666 points back to there but remember it's not the beast that speaks it's the image of the beast that speaks there's something that gives the power gives power to the image of the beast to enforce these things brother brahm talked about how that a woman would rule that right a woman would rule perhaps the catholic church because they're going to bail us out whether that has happened already i as a man as a pastor couldn't tell you you know just what goes on behind the scenes whether it has or whether we have to get in so deep and we may still see it and hear about it wouldn't it be something that if you and i did find out hey somebody's paying off our national debt huh be exactly in line with the scriptures and then guess what when they when they pay it off they own you what man so many quotes brother bam said talk about this woman was cruel with the people and so forth and that right with the americans has no respect for your democracy or your constitution or any of that none whatsoever folks how many knows the world is falling apart amen and getting ready to leave that's what jesus said be ready be ready i don't care if it happens another 10 years from i don't care how long as a pastor i say you make sure your heart is right with god and that you are sealed in by the holy spirit and don't let the devil try to take that away from you cause you to doubt the word amen to reject the word because if you do it's to take the mark of the beast amen trusted we can all have a closer closer walk with god i don't know about you but i want to be like that little girl that was that had a date of that uh rich man's son it was at the may company or something armor arm and hammer maybe armor just armor armor company he went out west you know and he had a big old ball everybody dressed up these cousins they did all their hair up and oh my you know looked really good but if they'd have washed their face it'd probably been scary this one girl stayed home and washed the dishes and cleaned worked hard amen it was must have been the house was close to the barn where they were doing all this isn't that right there she was throwing the wash water out he had done dance with all of these girls and all of this stuff that's true brother jesus done danced with all these churches he done had you know try to see if they would be his bride and so forth but they cared more about their church and the way they want to be than they did him and so he went outside get a little fresh air he walked around the back and he seen her amen what was it he saw character there she was she could have been at the party she kept it all made up but there she was beautiful gorgeous he said you know this would make me a good wife she doesn't have to be at all the dances and the big the hoop to do and everything else she's got character he went over there how you doing miss she was all dirty and hi how you doing sir good baby the great boss's son was right there he talked to her for a little bit you know aren't you kind of tired of the in the yard aren't you kind of tired of being a slave to these churches and have them tell you what to do and do all of their dirty work for them and whatnot i mean how would you like to marry me huh you're what i'm looking for he knew right in his heart he knew that he would marry me and we would get married i'm feels that's the right way we that's with uh we come out of the highways the hedges our background look at where we come from what we deserve not him but yet he chose us he saw something in you but we feel that in our heart because i'm going to go away my prophet's going to have to lay still for a while things are going to have to catch up i'm going to prepare you a place how many believe jesus is over there preparing this place yeah future home it's there brother stephen we're going to have a house out of this world oh my gracious we're gonna have a place like you wouldn't believe amen just like that man said i'm going to build your house and then i'll be back i'll have it built in the year amen in the meantime he was telling his cousins hey cousins you all better repent y'all done rejected the message y'all done rejected god and he's rejected you but he did ask me to marry him yeah all right i guarantee you that's what people saying about this church right here they're saying yeah i'll write a prophet no i don't believe such make fun of us they think they're going to go in the rapture god chose them do you think god predestinated them well i want you to know i can do what i want dress i want live i want go to church i'm god's going to take me in the rapture how many knows you've got news for him it's not us choosing him it's him choosing us amen so juice would be ready well what did he say he said just be ready just be ready all that year that little girl told her cousins that he was going to come back amen a lot of them out there really don't think he's coming back because let me tell you something if you really believe he's coming back you'll act accordingly our actions will be according so the day came tomorrow she sewed her dress ready huh got in there and had a sewing machine in the other room went to the goods went into the tape library and listened to a bunch of tapes let the word dresser when the church says lord i'm not what ought to be but dress me lord change from what i am to what i ought to be god i'm still not where i ought to be lord just come come continue day after day and they made fun of her a little girl that made fun of a girl that came to the bathroom tired and i had her hair all slicked back looked old-fashioned and they're right and she did everything she wanted to do and send some more and everything else thought she was all right but she come down with a venereal disease and was dying and that right and her soul caught up with her and we realized i'm dying and her pastor was out in the hallway smoking cigarettes and calling me he come in there and she says you deceiver of man you know he says calm down calm down you're all right you're all right she's i'm not all right i'm dying and you sorry preacher didn't preach the truth you didn't tell me all these things like he should have told me amen says call me that girl get that girl that i made fun of said her preacher was narrow-minded you know and so forth and everything else but she didn't make it there before she died a horrible death amen kind of like the cousins don't think that it's they don't think it's really going to be her they think it'll be them but they're in for a when the lord comes and leaves to find themselves in the tribulation period so she got ready day after day finally was ready she hung it up said i'ma put that on tomorrow tomorrow at noon he said right next day she got up had her good pancakes and breakfast and some bacon whatever she wanted to have ate a good lunch good breakfast out all dressed up purdy she went out there by the little white fence by her sidewalk out there perhaps dirt lane coming through here she opened the gate and she stood by that gate and waited her cousin's just making fun i ain't got to believe no profit to be ready don't be so sure he didn't do all this for nothing he didn't do all this jesus didn't for entertainment he did it to get a bride ready that's why you look like you do that's why you dress like you do that's why you have the attitude that you that's why you have the spirit that you do huh that's why we are what we are it's because of what god done for us in his age that's why i do what i do she was ready it made fun it was all fun until the economy collapsed hello and he was coming the squeeze came they heard the wheels like we're hearing the wheels he's on his way folks you better be ready you better be dressed yeah yeah yeah reels rolling here to come up over their eyes four of the most beautiful black horses that you ever saw amen in a white chariot just to get it cracking the whip just to get the cousins eyes and jaws she was right he is coming huh you better believe it the word is right he is coming there's going to be a heaven to go to there's going to be a tribulations for those who get the mark of the beast and the wrath of god poured out without mixture what does that mean in other words it's not going to have one lick of mercy it's going to be cruel beyond people's imagination this world and the people out there it's going to be real bad amen but i don't want to be here to you and i hear the wheels coming folks here he comes he comes up and he comes to a stop right there in front of the gate say hey honey you're beautiful jump on board she gets up gets on that buggy pulls up sits down beside me beside him yeah yeah yeah hits them horses all them cousins sitting back there he left us he left us she left us he came just like she said he was gonna she was ready just like she was supposed to be now they're all gone amen that's what's going to happen to churches folks that rejected the word took the mark of the beast and then the wrath of god would be poured out and you have no idea you have no idea the people that are going to be left here when they realize they've been left what's going to happen in their heart it's going to sink they'll have no energy no strength no hope whatsoever it'll be sad i don't watch you but i believe that if you're one of his you want to say god i want to be ready just have me ready let's stand musicians if you'll come and that's just half the story because after they went back what did she do her and him went back to that beautiful beautiful place called heaven amen and lived together for how long eternity eternity amen let's bow our heads this last 6 000 years wow we can say it's been short at the end of it seeing the signs all around us hearing his spirit call us calling for us to be ready calling for us to rise trim your lamps make sure you have oil in your lamp receive the seal of god the baptism of the holy spirit calling us to be ready to meet him in the skies when he meets when he comes just how and when no man knows but the important thing is that we're ready when he does is there anybody in here that would just say i don't have the holy spirit like i should have it i want to accept the holy ghost into my heart right now in fullness i want to receive the holy spirit my soul god bless you god bless you god bless you god bless you god bless you lord jesus my hand goes up i believe i've got the holy ghost but i want more of him lord all these hands that are raised realize god that they want the seal of god in their hearts so that their parents their mom and dad the children the children to the parents and neighbors everybody could see hey they have got the holy ghost i can see the seal on them i see the baptism of the holy ghost by how they live how they act how they talk way that they talk how humble they are how meek they are how gentle
