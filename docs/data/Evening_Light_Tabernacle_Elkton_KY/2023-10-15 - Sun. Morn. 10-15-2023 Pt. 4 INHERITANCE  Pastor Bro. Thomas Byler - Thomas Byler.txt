better people in what we've come Lord we ask your blessing upon the reading of the word the meditation of our heart now in Jesus name amen and amen I'm going to read the scriptures and then we're going to recap just a little bit if that's okay I always like to recap just a little bit we won't go all the way back amen I think this is about our fifth message on this amen but I will maybe mention just a little bit of uh some of the things we've been speaking on Amen and uh our series is on the overview and overview of the Christian amen an overview of the Christian just looking that what a wonderful thing it to be a Christian amen and what that encumbers and or entails amen and of course amen we could go for eternity on it amen because that's what Christians will do is go for eternity amen so God bless you let's turn our Bibles and I'll just uh basically uh go to the scripture uh that come to me amen when I begin to think about this and really the overview of a Christian we've been talking about the experience of the believer On The Backs side of the desert and this once again is kind of centered on the backside of the desert amen what happens on the backside of the desert amen so praise the Lord let's turn to Matthew if you will 13 Matthew 13 amen now think about this this is also amen a scripture that has to do with that backside of the desert experience amen Matthew 13 and verse 44 again the Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto a treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for Joy therefore goeth and selleth all that he have and buth that field amen again a kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found amen one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen so my thought this morning is that amen what happens on the backside of that desert amen and when a person comes in contact with God Amen when you have an experience with almighty God Amen and this is just another example of uh a scripture that kind of expounds and tells us that amen you realize and you find out that you found the pearl of great price amen amen and a little bit about what that all encumbers is that all right the pearl of great price even Jesus talking about it and I want to just uh uh let me let me let me just say something I didn't say Wednesday that I wanted to say amen and it is uh uh let me see here if I can find it um it had here he is in Luke in Luke uh 16th chapter in verse 19 there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen fared sumptuously every day and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which which was laid at the gate full of sores Desiring to be fed with crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs licked his sores and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels unto Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham AAR off in his bosom amen and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy mercy on me and send laus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this place amen amen and so it says but Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receive his thy good things and likewise Lazarus is evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented and besides all this between fix so that they which would pass from hands uh to you who cannot come neither can they pass to us that would come from F then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou would as send him to my father's house let's stop right there and the reason that I'm reading this the reason that I'm saying this is because amen I believe that a Christian that has met God Amen is going to be fulfilling the scripture amen amen and so we're going to by God's grace fulfill this scripture now let me finish it then said he I pray thee all right all right send him to my father's house now notice he all of a sudden became wanted to amen wanted to be a missionary isn't that right he wanted to go tell his brothers about not don't come to this place amen amen isn't that what we want to yell out this morning to the world hey there's a place that you don't want to go to amen and we've had a scriptural warning that you don't want to go there you don't have to go there for I have five Brethren and that he may testify unto them least they also come into this place of Torment Abraham said unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them wo think about it how do you and I fulfill that scripture because you and I believe God's prophets is that right we believe what God has done we have prepared ourselves and we have repented and we've heard that message we've heard the testimony is that right we've made our hearts right we've met God and we've repented because we don't want to go to that place aren't you glad that you can fulfill this scripture this morning hallelujah thank you Lord let them hear them and he said nay Father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent and he said unto them if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead amen how many knows I'll tell you what if you can't believe what God did through a prophet in this generation there ain't nothing going to make you believe you're unbeliever and you're going to end up in that same place aren't you glad that we've had a prophet we've had the dead raised me we've had mealings and all these things to show us hey don't go there but accept hear God's prophets hear Moses hear what God has sent so that you don't end up going there praise the Lord when I think about the backside of the desert this morning when you meet God Amen and you have that experience of meeting God and amen now let me just like I said I wanted to recap you said okay of course Wednesday we talked a little amen about the rest amen overcoming and rest having rest no matter and not and having an anchor amen being Anchored In Christ amen amen and so Romans there it says that we're persuaded that nothing shall separate us or should we say un anger us or unhinge US from the love of God when you have that experience even Peter Peter said there you know when he had a revelation of Jesus Christ Our Prophet taught you know that revelation God was going to build his church upon that rock isin't that right and the gates of hell would never Prevail against somebody that's had a personal experience with God God don't have grandchildren you can't go in because your preacher said it you can't go in because your parents said it or have an experience you have to have that experience personally amen that you've met God Amen and when you meet God nothing can take ever that way but if the prophet of God said there's not enough devils in can talk you out of it they can never take that away from you so I've been looking at that anchor how that a real Christian isn't tossed from place to place isn't that right praise the Lord Brother B says know see we see look at what we got in our Sunday school teachers that been talking we all know the whole world has become become a con glamor but B say of muck and sin and despair it's got to get that way to blow up the whole thing all the ties are pull out pulled out of it naturally and how many all of our morality has been pulled out until there is not Speck not one Speck of morality left anymore not a speck of decency anymore anymore amen and then the people's just become so sinful that it's become a great big bunch of muck till it's just like it was at the beginning and that God grieved that he ever made man amen how many would say Lord Jesus I don't want you to be grieved that you made me no let me be pleasing to you Lord like Enoch was pleasing to God and he was not because testimony that he pleased God it's not about pleasing your mom dad brother sister Pastor it's about you pleasing God this morning amen I'm gonna slow down I get to going too fast and I'm I'm gonna mess up amen all right so now notice so we're living in today and I notice what he said here that's right oh my he says and it'll just take one little Atomic jar to set the whole thing out of order so we're just living in the in that day and happy to be a Christian oh my what would I do I don't believe I believe I'd go wild if I wasn't a Christian looking at this whole thing see how I don't see how people can stand it I just don't understand how a man can walk on Earth today without being a Christian I was saying somebody give me a reason some reason why not to serve Christ oh God has been so oh so good to me he has been so faithful with every breath that I have I'm going to praise him I'm going to talk about the goodness of God God is so good we truly ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth oh the church brother says he living a million miles below their privileges but yet the scripture says that before before God comes she's going to be without God and she's going to be without rink go amen so somebody's not going to be living below their privileges before we leave this place somebody going to be living up to privileges they got to be the kind of Christ kind of Christian that [Applause] need how many believes it look around the message see if we ain't coming up to living up to our standards and to our privileges better believe it I believe they are because the coming of the Lord is close and Satan is getting put under our feet that's where he belongs under our feet oh my give me a sensible reason oh my and now notice this is the day that we all ought to be happy and ready happy and ready the great home time coming is at hand just two old quotes that we go on no man has a right to preach the gopel no man has a right to call themselves a Christian until they can go back to a certain time in their life where they could come on that sacred Sands at the back side of the desert where they know that they have met God Amen and I want you to get don't you never let this pass from you but if a man's ever stood on that sacred sand on the back side of the desert when he meets God face to face there's not enough devils and all of hell can take that away from him hallelujah how many believe that when you're a Son of God when you're born again there's not enough reinforcements Out of Hell there's streams and streams of demon powers the prophet of God flowing out inhabiting everybody else but when there's a real genuine believer there's not enough reinforcement to take you down out it can't be done because back there am me God begin to build something he be a son a daughter of God Amen and when he begins to build you he don't do like the friends of brother brandom did when they take a some kind of a Winchester or something and board it out to be a 300 weather be Magnum is that right board it out to be about 3 weather be Magnum and come back and do what out on the r amen and uh possessing all things this just a lot of quotes I'm going be pulling from one of the very first things brother Brandon when I when I went there to look for these things and that's one of the things down that I want to mention there was the story of the weather be Magnum one of the first things he mentioned amen and had bored it out but it wasn't it hadn't been melted down how many know that steel that did take they take this steel and they temper it they melt it completely down to where it's just a liquid and it gets poured into a form Ain that right amen and whatever it is going to be that's what it's supposed to be and when you take a gun and man you B it out a little bit but your walls are going to be thinner and it would not hold the pressure he said and it blowed up in his face it should have blown his head off so much pressure per square inch and he did get some Shel can I talk to you you know I've heard a lot about things that God did for people and you know sometimes they'll say that this person was healed but they still got cancer I'm like because God does a halfway job they're healed but yet there's cancer or something wrong with him and so forth and I thought Lord I don't know I don't understand everything but maybe you could show me and I believe he showed me in this story huh that healed brother Ron one one of the testimonies baffled me a little bit about brother Ron Spencer's lungs he they were completely so strong on the inside but yet he's got H cancers hanging on the outside I don't understand that I'm like why would God do that what God going to do I'm said Lord help me to understand wouldn't it baffle all of us just a little but you know when I've read this story because brother bam said the devil was trying to take his life and he said you know it was only the grace of God that protected brother bandam but he said got shrapnel in his eye he got shrapnel here and there isn't that right but God still did it work God still saved his life so yeah sometimes God can do what he wants I'll tell you what if I can just move my hand a little bit that's God's healing that's god so let's give God glory for whatever he chooses to do maybe we need a little more faith maybe we need to go to get b a little de I don't know but God can do those things and you think well if he's going to protect them wouldn't get one bit of strap no that be but God allowed a little bit to go in but you know that that angel kept him from getting killed amen that was my answer amen okay now I understand amen how many believer you have a question there's a Bible answer just wait and listen god'll tell you praise the Lord but what did he say he says that gun was not magnet it was not from the factory it wasn't built from the ground up and he says that's the way a lot of Christians are they're not built let me tell you something am man you want to impersonate Christianity you'll never be able to put up with the pressure that a Christian has to go through you'll never be able to pay for those that wrongly use you despitefully use you persecute you smack you on the cheeks turn the other sh you won't be able to your body's not made for that you got to be born again I mean beles you're going to be a Christian you has to have a new birth experience to be able to put up with the pressure that comes all the tribulation that the Christian faces amen all the persecution that comes your way you'll never be able to stand it unless you've been born again until you have been on the backside of the desert and you have become liquified You' got to become liquefied Amen to where God can pour you into a mold and reshape you we're not just transforming form inen or rehabilitating we're completely doing transformation amen say God here I am make me what you want me to be built me the way that I'm supposed to be built folks I'm convinced that when God built you the of pressure that comes your way am me he has built you in such a way that your pressures make you stronger the more persecution the stronger in says you know the church really prevailed under persec extion but under soft living layout of c a lot of time we become weaked because of our Easy Living amen I'm gonna take this off thank y'all for my Christmas suit last year I finally spent the money got me a suit decided I needed a vest for Brother John and sister Emma's wedding we want it to look good we don't want to have no food on our shirts really amen but thank y'all amen but that's just too warm amen you love the Lord oh God is good oh my got oh aren't you thankful back side of the desert again we're just going to go as far as we can because we could be here a while back out of that desert experience where God begins to mold you and shape you into a Son of God when you oh my on that back side of the desert when God actually accepts you when you have been accepted in the Beloved when your sacrifice of repentance God honors and says all right that guy is seriously repenting huh CU even on the day of Pentecost how many days they were up in the upper room about 11 days waiting for the promise to come Ain that right waiting and waiting and waiting for the promise to come they had to wait they went out prematur they have been as scared as they ever were but they waited waited and waited waited waited till the Holy Ghost came the brother bam says there's no more there's no waiting now the Holy Ghost has come he says the second that you genuinely repent amen and God accepts your sacrifice all about to beside you with the Holy Ghost you might get it here this morning the second that you receive it and God accepted God will baptize you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he accepts that sacrifice he accepts that repentance amen and you become a new creation I'm a new creation created in Christ Jesus unto good works one place he talks about when you get born again you heard from your theophany amen you heard from your theophany so let's just start first of all you have to recognize when you're born again that now you begin to recognize that you're a God before I Lord I'm here I don't I don't know if I'm your child I don't know I'm just a sinner here I'm no good I'm nothing but I can't go on without you I can't live without you God if you'll have mercy on me and forgive me I'll serve you all the days of my life what if he don't forgive you what if you go back with the same way that you ever came huh then God doesn't accept you God didn't accept you but when he accepts you something happens says something has to happen a change has to take place I don't care kids I don't care if you go the corn field tell Mom and I'm going to the cornfield I'm coming out look for me in three days but unless God fills me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're going to find a pile of bonds here get serious with God wherever doesn't get cornfield wherever you are could be in your car can be anywhere I mean up you can be get born again anywhere it's just where you meet God's conditions when you meet God's conditions God will come and when he does something happened and now I don't question anymore but he touched me and made me whole praise God Amen you become the richest person in the world you have the pearl of great price you have the thing that is worth 10 th000 worlds amen you become a Rich Man On The Backs side of the desert because like I said let me slow down let's go back and find out for sure whether you're a Son of God I want you know I want to know that I'm a Son of God first because none of these things are mine unless I'm a Son of God or a daughter of God Amen in Romans 8 and uh verse 14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God Amen in verse 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God how many knows it's the Holy Ghost in you that is the confirmation that you're his child amen the Holy Ghost In You amen is a confirmation that we are the sons of God children of God and if children than hes heires of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together Glory so now if you've got the Holy Ghost then that tells you that you're a joined Heir with God right you're an heir how many believes you're an heir that means you have an inheritance now if God is your father just as your Earthly father whatever your father has you fall air to it the children fall air to the position of the father now all of a sudden you find out that you're an air brother bam explains it as a great arcade all of a sudden you realize you I don't know what he really meant by an arcade but he talks about maybe a wehouse I believe you mentioned full of stuff and you know they got these racks all the way up but I'd like to rephrase ra it a little bit this morning and come a little bit on my thought on it you know for me we're deer hunting now so if I found out that I become heir to a Bass Pro huh you ladies let's just say you inherited JC Penney huh and then I thought deeper you know no no no you didn't inherit bass bro and neither did you inherit JC Penney you inherited JP Penney's Warehouse sh woo W that's a whole lot more than just one little store that's everything that belongs to every J Penny M or Bass Pro Bass Pro Warehouse I don't care if you want a raven I don't care if you want a Matthews I don't care if you want a PSC man you ain't never you Lo it all but B says if I can't get hold of I'm gonna get a lad and I'm gonna look on the next I'm gonna see my God how many wants to see what you got this morning let's see what's yours let's find out what's ours we're inheritance now we've got an inheritance my my my praise be to God so now we're Sons not just Sons but hirs HS to something praise the Lord okay and let's just see one of them is in 2 Corinthians 6 this is one of the scriptures the prophet read whenever he preached on possessing all things also when MDC met MDC he met him and he says that he was mzc was the possessor of the heavens and the Earth amen how many knows that now how many knows when youve met Christ on the backside of the desert you become a Son of God you are can we say something a little bit more you say well we become a Son of God yeah that's when you become or you come back into fellowship with God but you recognized God showed you that hey you have been a son all along [Applause] amen oh man I'm going to go too fast because I want to talk about the one of the the richest Paul said the exceeding Riches of his grace amen and of The Inheritance that ones of our one of our great things that we have in inherit is God's grace let's go there let's let's let's well read this scripture all right 2 Corinthians 6 and verse 7 by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers yet true now notice as unknown and yet well known oh my do you see how we could just stop and realize that the Christian isn't popular we're not known by much people out there they don't recognize we don't want to be known by them we're not known didn't brother B says you know if you want to be popular you got to go with the popular way we don't want nothing to do with the popular way we don't care about be power if we say unknown that's fine but we're wellknown but who's important yet well known amen as dying and behold we're more Li than anybody come on as Chast and yet not killed we might think people think oh they're sorrowful no you're always Rejoice we're the happiest people there is as poor oh my you might be poor listen yet making many Rich how many Le if you're child of God you are rich having nothing and yet possessing all things yet possessing all things in First Corinthians 3:21 it says Paul says therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours whether Paul or Apollos or sephus or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours you're Christ and Christ's Christ is God's amen praise the Lord now let's look at this for just a minute I believe it's in Ephesians 2 Ephesians 2 let's look at what we inherited how many knows if you're a Son of God God knew that you would be inheriting something amen even before you was saved and one of the first things that you inherited the greatest thing that you inherited was Grace amen notice here in Chapter 2 of Ephesians even when verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved and hath raised us up together and made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness towered up us through Jesus Christ for by grace are you saved amen through faith and that not over yourselves it's is the gift of God Amen how many believe that in Romans 5 it says therefore be being justified by faith we have peace with God how many knows before you before the backside of the desert you didn't have peace with your dog you didn't have peace with your neighbor you had no peace with yourself there is no peace sayith the Lord For The Wicked but now justified by faith we have peace with God through Jesus Christ Our Lord by whom also we have access by faith into this grace woo how many know that it takes the faith of God Amen it even that faith is a gift of God cuz you can't never get nowhere as a Son of God daughter of God on the backs side of the desert as you go forward amen you can't even get a hold of God until he does a work of Grace and grants you Faith to believe you won't start you won't finish you won't make it through the middle you won't make it nowhere outside of faith and that's by great but you have got to have faith to accept his grace right oh it's just not for me I'm not good enough I've done too many bad things talk the devil's language but that's not what God Said you believe that God I believe that Grace is for me I believe it's for me anden God will say you know you're my child and you can be saved if you're a sinner this morning I read a quote where better bam says there's people here you know in life that just go through life and they don't mind stealing lying cheating stealing and all these other stuff and they don't mind being that way at all but he says but there's those that steal lie chea and stealing they don't want to but they do and they don't want to he says there's a hope for that person he can get somewhere because he don't want to be that way but the person that's happy being that way he don't never get nowhere amen so if you're not where you ought to be don't be happy amen don't be happy where you are unless you are right where you need to be with God praise the Lord I don't care I don't care how low down you are as long as you don't want to be that way there's hope for you praise the Lord I like that access by faith aming into this amen into this promise joint errors many promises how many knows this B this this Bible belongs to you everything belongs to you but didn't the prophet of God he says you know amen the Bland is yours just like he told Joshua it's all your if you're an heir you're a child of Abraham how many believe you're a child of Abraham amen listen if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise remember Abraham came out didn't he he came out he separated himself listen so we find first that Abraham in obedience left his home left his separated from everything all of his Earthly possessions position possessions to travel in a Strange Land sojourn a type of the church amen we are asked to forsake everything that's in this world in order to follow Christ amen and when he follow when he separated himself how many knows that's what we're doing this morning and that is amen try follow the because remember you are never fully blessed until you fully obey and you'll never be come into full obedience until you come into complete belief of every word God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief our greatest enemy is unbelief we think about David we think about him killing Goliath we think about shamgar we think about samon killing a thousand Philistines I want you to understand that the believer kills bigger de Lo than what they killed they can never overcome lost Mo overcome his temper you and I your own nature you overcome your desires for sin anden you kill them Devils of L kill them Devils of hate kill them devils ofation and strife Amen to separate yourself amen like we said wed say and rest from all your works all the works of the flesh my praise the Lord you love him when God when he came out that's the first thing we got to do is separate ourselves from unbelief like Abraham did he was the heir heir of all things when Abraham came out he had troubles a that right why he had troubles because he didn't obey quite why aren't you happy like you ought to be maybe because you don't obey quite like you ought to he brought his nephew he brought his dad brought his nephew lot you know and the herdsman got into strife and bickering and all of that other stuff in the middle of all that but remember what God told him he says look Abraham look North look South look East look West everywhere it all belongs to you how many believes that's that absolutely let me tell you something listen that applies to you brother John put me on top of this church I can't even see get me an airplane and get me way up there then let me look get me on a 747 way up there let me look left let me look right let me look that way look that way W I can see the Curve the Earth and me we're way up there it's all yours the meek shall inherit the Earth how many believe that the meek shall inherit the earth praise the Lord amen God's good amen let me read you some quotes I like it when the prophet says it amen it's not not just me but a Vindicated person saying it you can be absolutely rest assured is Right amen praise the Lord after lot separated himself and so forth God told him look oh tonight we may not be rich in this world's good but we possess all things amen the church itself possesses all things yet poor yet making Rich many rich and possess all things my father is rich in houses and lands he holds the wealth of the world in his end of rubies and diamonds of silver and gold his coffers are full his riches are Untold oh and we are possessors of it I like that but we're possessors now I wanted to preach on the soldier cuz when God molds you when he makes you if you're ever going to be able to go in and possess the things that you inherited you're going to have to fight for it in order to fight for it you're going to have to be a warrior amen this is just me but doesn't Israel have women soldiers I don't say that women should be solders trust me but in this battle the women are soldiers too you sisters are so just too for them kids and for your own things I mean you got to be a soldier you got to be a Warrior amen cuz it isn't all just given to you right there on the back side of the desert it's all over with oh we have peace and Harmony now everything's just going to be a flowery bit of ease brother Bam Sister Pentecostal thought that no how many knows on the back side of the desert now you're ready to start going somewhere God's going to use you for something amen he's not going to give you everything right there there will be things that you have to fight for that the day that you die matter of fact when they tell you there's nothing can be done for you you'll be facing one of the biggest battles you ever faced fear huh is't that right all the way to there I remember brother Joey Hendrickson there it is death bed he says this fear wants to grab a hold of me fear wants to grab a hold of me but I just Shug it off saying get behind me the devil I know where I'm going huh oh yeah that'll be one time that he really puts it on you when you come to that door oh have I done this or have I done that he'll probably use your mind and everything else all I want to tell him is look I have put it under the blood amen my Christ has let me save th far and he'll lead me home amen how many believe that oh I like that we're possessors because we are a child of the king the child always falls air oh my for praise the Lord he says look oh maybe his cattle were starving maybe all this was oh my the herdsman and so forth he says but he said God said look east and west and nor and South it's all yours and today the True Believer is cast out from among the people called fanatic called Holy Roller called following some cult ain't that right we're classed ah you don't want to be called a cult following a man a false prophet and you're in the wrong place because that's what they're going to call us that's what they're going to say amen but for a false prophet God sure did P show himself in the pillar of fire the FBI government at that time said the only Supernatural T picture ever taken of almighty God Amen how many believes it oh yeah praise God now notice that's right some kind of they call some kind of a religious fanatic and yet is heir to the whole heavens and the Earth blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth talk about push you out in a certain cabin or something and hardly enough money to pay the rent oh come my if this don't do something for us I don't know what will me listen to what he says hardly enough money to pay the rent yet you own it

old clothed suitcase with a billion dollars cash billion dollars brother B you are grab that thing my troubles are over not knowing they probably just [Laughter] started you'd have a big how many know you would have a major battle on your hand when you read about all the people that won the lottery and how they ended up under concrete slabs where cuz somebody else want B more that destroyed their lives huh can I say something that comes to mind then you wonder why God maybe don't make you rich he knows what he's doing praise the Lord now notice that you own it all amen have to work and toil and sweat for a few dollars to make an honest living to put shoes on your children's feet to feel your feet uh their little hungry mouths and yet oh my your air to everything that's here the meek shall inherit the earth how do you get it something you done no sir it's unmerited gift that God gave you and it's yours it belongs to us Satan cannot hold it if you go to him with a spiritual authoritative word with faith and say it's mine lay it down amen glory to God Satan you lay it down you took it from me now give it up think about it I'm telling you right now amen the real Treasures that you have amen is that joy unspeakable and full of Glory how many the promised land is the promised land of the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost spirit amen the fruit of the spirit is love and joy and peace and longsuffering and gentleness and meekness God help us to have no things give me somebody give me some Joshua and Caleb that can go over into the promised land and come back and say oh I

take that unkindness out of my life and then I'm going put a little kindness in there it's mine amen the word of God I got a good one for you I sure sure hope that I brought it yeah here it is now Faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it isn't just a peacemaker it overcomes quotes before that he says faith knows no defeat Trials come they know but Faith itself real genuine Faith knows no defeat if Faith would no defeat if God's faith with no defeat when he said let there be light no light ever come let there be but there never was that's not Faith real genuine faith when God Quicken
