[47:43] come to you Lord we're so thankful Lord
[47:46] that we can come in an hour Lord where a
[47:50] lot of people are falling
[47:52] away but Lord you have come and you've
[47:55] poured out your word and our roots are
[47:57] driving deeper and
[47:59] deeper Lord the winds can blow and the
[48:02] storms can come but Lord we we don't get
[48:06] uprooted but Lord you just bend us a
[48:09] little bit and it helps us just get
[48:11] stronger and stronger Lord we're

[48:15] tribulation that we've gone through and
[48:18] Lord we're thankful for every Mountain

[48:21] we've seen and Lord we're thankful for
[48:24] an opportunity to be here tonight Lord
[48:25] and we ask Lord you just come and speak
[48:28] to us through your word tonight Lord
[48:30] Lord as we would just set ourselves
[48:31] aside and ask you Lord you minister to
[48:33] us we ask you to be with us now in the
[48:35] reading of your word you bless it in
[48:37] Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles
[48:40] tonight I want to turn to the book of
[48:42] Hebrews chapter 6 beginning at verse 13
[48:45] and I would just like to minister for a
[48:47] few minutes here on a captive to the
[48:50] Covenant captive to the
[48:52] Covenant so here we find here it says
[48:55] for when God made promise to
[48:59] Abraham because he could swear by no
[49:01] greater he swear by himself saying
[49:05] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[49:08] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[49:12] after he had patiently endured he
[49:14] obtained the promise for men verily
[49:18] swear by the greater in oath for
[49:20] confirmation is to them an end of all
[49:23] Strife wherein God willing more
[49:26] abundantly to show unto The Heirs of the
[49:28] promis immutability of his counsel
[49:31] aren't you glad for that confirmed it by
[49:34] an
[49:35] oath that by two immutable things in
[49:38] which it was impossible for God to lie
[49:42] we might have a strong
[49:44] consolation who have fled for Refuge to
[49:47] lay hold upon the Hope set before us
[49:50] which hope we have as an anchor look at
[49:53] listen what is your anchor the hope we
[49:55] have as an anchor of a soul both sure
[49:58] and steadfast which entereth in within
[50:01] the veil and you could have your seats
[50:03] this evening as I this let me just read
[50:06] this to you out of the message MDC the
[50:08] great Prince and
[50:09] King he says what a marvelous promise
[50:12] two immutable things God cannot lie and
[50:16] be God that's right oh now if it God
[50:19] made a promise in his Bible here we
[50:21] believe God to be infallible word of God
[50:25] if God made a promise in this Bible ible
[50:27] we have this consolation now this word
[50:29] consolation as we just read in Hebrews
[50:31] and brother Brandon makes a statement
[50:33] again is a comfort it's a peace and it's
[50:36] assurance and know that it's impossible
[50:39] for God to lie therefore when we see he
[50:42] promised it in the Bible We Believe It
[50:45] soul body and spirit we believe it we
[50:48] just don't believe it with our with our
[50:50] mind we don't have an intellectual Faith
[50:52] about it but we believe it with our soul
[50:54] it drops down and begins to take root
[50:56] and when it begins to take root in your
[50:58] soul all of a sudden things begin to
[51:00] happen around you it begins to take over
[51:02] your body and it becomes subject to that
[51:05] faith that is laying there and what
[51:07] happens and then the spirit is moving
[51:08] across that faith that is laying there
[51:10] and brings that body subject to the word
[51:13] and you become a place where God's
[51:14] promise is now laying there the
[51:16] immutability of God is laying inside of
[51:19] you body mind and soul has wrapped
[51:22] around the word of God and stepped in
[51:23] there and you have become infallible
[51:25] just as God has become infallible see
[51:27] it's impossible for God to lie he said
[51:30] there's if there's any fault it's in us
[51:33] not in God let me just say that there's
[51:35] any fault because the people have walked
[51:37] away it's not in God it's in us it's in
[51:40] us that we've walked away he says now
[51:41] for God is obligated to his word as he
[51:44] has sworn by his
[51:46] word so the obligation to God by his
[51:49] word comes by God himself now I know
[51:52] we've all given commitments we've all
[51:54] given uh well should we say Oaths or
[51:56] covenants to one another saying we would
[51:59] do certain things be there at certain
[52:01] times and and things like that you know
[52:03] one of the greatest things that we've
[52:05] done as as a a man in time and we know
[52:09] those that are married youve given an
[52:10] oath to your wife that you would provide
[52:12] for and sickness and health you know
[52:15] it's hard to get up and go to work when
[52:16] you're not feeling good I'm just being
[52:18] honest you know that it's hard to get up
[52:20] and go to work when you're not feeling
[52:21] good but these are Oaths that we made to
[52:23] one another now an oath is a formal or
[52:25] solemn or a binding agreement or
[52:28] contract so you give your word to saying
[52:31] that you would provide for her you would
[52:33] stand in the gate and be her protection
[52:35] for her you would be the priest of the
[52:37] home you would stand there in that place
[52:39] and as a as a diviner between your
[52:42] household in God as the one that was
[52:44] being applying the blood so you find
[52:46] that you would sit in this place of this
[52:48] Covenant this oath that God would give
[52:50] is not just an oath but it comes God's
[52:53] identity you realize your word becomes
[52:56] your
[52:57] identity you know we used to say how
[53:00] that that we would give a man's word
[53:02] he's only as good as his
[53:04] word it's because it became his identity
[53:07] if he would he would say he would be
[53:09] there at a certain time and he wouldn't
[53:10] show up you wouldn't hire that man to do
[53:12] a job or you know he wouldn't do things
[53:15] that way or or you wouldn't you you know
[53:17] you wouldn't do things certain way his
[53:19] circumstances rise up you understand
[53:21] that but you understand when God gave
[53:23] his word no circumstance can rise up and
[53:25] block his word he sent his word and it
[53:27] performed his work when God would send
[53:30] his word he would perform his work and
[53:32] he would stand there as the Assurance to
[53:34] you that you were standing beside
[53:36] somebody that would stand beside his
[53:39] word you know when the pilgrims come and
[53:42] they sailed across the ocean on the ship
[53:45] called the mayflower and they landed
[53:48] they were wanted to land in Virginia but
[53:49] they ended landed up in in Massachusetts
[53:52] and they they set up they said there was
[53:54] there was pilgrims and there was non-
[53:55] pilgrims on this ship there was two
[53:58] there was two different there were some
[53:59] that were running from religious freedom
[54:02] and there were some that were that were
[54:03] running from the the Natural Freedom
[54:05] that they had because they were they
[54:07] were might have been Sinners they might
[54:08] have been law Breakers so they boarded
[54:10] the ship and they were running across
[54:11] the ocean but here stood the pilgrims
[54:14] and they said we've got to come up with
[54:15] an agreement to where we can come in a
[54:19] Unison and we can Thrive to a place of
[54:22] survival and go back and look it up the
[54:25] history and they wrote the Mayflower
[54:27] Compact which is basically a contract in
[54:30] which the settlers consented to follow
[54:32] certain Community rules and
[54:35] regulations for the sake of the order
[54:38] and
[54:39] survival yeah that's right oh my it
[54:42] created laws to go by that they can live
[54:46] and work in
[54:47] prosperity you think about that it
[54:50] created laws for their
[54:52] survival and God sent his word for our
[54:55] survival
[54:56] he sent it to us that we would something
[54:58] Survive by and we just throw it around
[55:01] like it's
[55:02] nothing and we think it's something that
[55:04] we just don't have to worry
[55:07] about but this word that God was shed
[55:10] this Covenant that he would give to
[55:12] us was not given to us by
[55:16] man but when God would give come to
[55:19] Abraham he would stand there as God
[55:23] himself and when he approached Abraham
[55:26] and he called him out of the land of
[55:28] Earth the calans called him out to a
[55:30] land of desert of
[55:32] desolation I just love
[55:35] Abraham we find that Abraham is
[55:38] following the word of God spoken to him
[55:41] don't we look like a fanatic to everyone
[55:45] else you might look like a fanatic to
[55:48] everyone else but let me tell you when
[55:50] you got the Vindicated word speaking to
[55:52] you that's what gives you this chance to
[55:55] stand there
[55:57] you won't back up no more you've got a
[56:00] backbone you know where you stand on
[56:02] God's
[56:03] word I'm talking about being captive to
[56:05] the Covenant now I'm not going talking
[56:07] about being a captive you're held in
[56:09] bondage to this thing this ain't no
[56:11] bondage thing but this is a love
[56:14] affair and so when God would confirm his
[56:16] Covenant to Abraham he would even he
[56:19] would actually would just he would send
[56:20] his word to him but one
[56:24] day years had passed the time of life
[56:27] had come and gone in Sarah Abraham an
[56:30] old man dried
[56:32] up one day he was sitting out
[56:35] there and he
[56:37] saw saw a man walking across the
[56:41] desert as he watched this man walk there
[56:45] he recognized it wasn't just no ordinary
[56:49] man nobody just seemed to stop by
[56:52] Brother Tom and stop by Abraham's tent
[56:54] and want to sit down and have fellowship
[56:56] with with
[56:57] him he was an
[56:59] outcast But Here Come God stepped into a
[57:03] flesh body that he
[57:05] created walking out on there the Sands
[57:08] of the desert upon the plains of mamry
[57:11] and he stood there and he stepped into
[57:12] Abraham's tent door and when he spoke
[57:14] Abraham recognized this is the same
[57:17] voice that has been speaking him for
[57:18] years has now manifested himself among
[57:22] him let me tell you we've heard the
[57:24] voice of God it was wasn't through a man
[57:27] but it was God himself speaking to
[57:30] us oh
[57:32] my but see here he is he says now on the
[57:35] proof of his
[57:36] resurrection he says because it's the
[57:38] word of God that's right God can't take
[57:41] back his own word he gave Abraham the
[57:44] word he says look you and Sarah are
[57:46] going to have a son so God couldn't take
[57:48] that word back he had G spoke the word
[57:50] out there now notice how he spoke the
[57:52] word out there and is now out there now
[57:54] God couldn't take it back God's not an
[57:56] India Giver he doesn't throw it out
[57:58] there and pull it
[57:59] back he doesn't he he sends it out there
[58:02] and no matter how much it would Vex his
[58:04] soul he would still perform his
[58:07] word so God once God speaks a word he's
[58:11] got to stay with it he can I can say a
[58:13] word and take it back and you can do the
[58:15] same but God can't he speaks a word he's
[58:17] got to stay with it and he said those
[58:19] words so God honors his
[58:22] word so when God cannot lie and he backs
[58:25] up his word we notice when his word
[58:28] begins he begins to speak his word it
[58:29] begins to set things in
[58:31] order isn't over in Genesis 1 that when
[58:34] he begin to speak the word he put the
[58:36] sun in his place is that right he set
[58:39] the sun in his
[58:40] orbit they have tried to figure out why
[58:42] the sun is that way let me tell you why
[58:44] the sun's that way God said it that way
[58:47] I don't want to understand why I just
[58:48] believe it God said it that way he set
[58:50] the moon in his right place in its order
[58:53] he set it where it's at it's opposite of
[58:55] the done oh my think about it he set the
[58:58] stars in their order he set every single
[59:01] one in their order in their place he
[59:04] said every single I notice and also when
[59:05] he come down he set the Earth in its
[59:07] order he set in it its place in the
[59:10] right distance from the Sun that it will
[59:11] not burn
[59:13] up think of this you're living in a
[59:15] place that is the exact distance that's
[59:18] to the very very very decimal meter that
[59:22] is sitting there that it will not burn
[59:24] by the sun's fire
[59:27] and if God set that Earth in order that
[59:29] we live in this earth and then he began
[59:31] to set animal life and body life in
[59:33] order and he done that now look what he
[59:35] did he set you in the right place you
[59:38] think you said I could have lived in
[59:39] that age I could have lived in that time
[59:42] you could have lived in that time you
[59:43] had to live in this time this is the age
[59:46] that you had to live
[59:48] in you had to live in this hour there's
[59:51] no other age that you could have been
[59:53] living in but this hour you had a set
[59:55] God set his word word and that word is
[59:57] in you and you were set in this
[59:59] hour why do you think he brought all the
[1:00:01] chromosomes all down through your family
[1:00:03] history and tied them all together and
[1:00:05] you would stand there and you would take
[1:00:07] God at his word and say this is nothing
[1:00:09] but the truth and God would come down
[1:00:10] and vindicate it right there among you
[1:00:13] let me tell you that's a covenant not
[1:00:15] given by
[1:00:16] man oh my that's a covenant given by
[1:00:20] God so then when the word begins to take
[1:00:23] its evidence upon the face of the Earth
[1:00:26] Earth we notice what happens it begins
[1:00:28] to move across the waters and it begins
[1:00:31] to call out the land and causes
[1:00:34] separation from the the waters and it
[1:00:36] causes the mountains to come
[1:00:38] forth but also out of that Earth would
[1:00:41] come
[1:00:42] mankind now you didn't come by by
[1:00:45] Evolution where they say two pows come
[1:00:47] and join themselves over on the back
[1:00:49] side of a lily
[1:00:51] pad but you came by the spoken word of
[1:00:54] God God spoke and he took that dust of
[1:00:57] that Earth and he spoke and he he called
[1:01:00] that it was a called it man it was a man
[1:01:02] he didn't have an actual name he called
[1:01:04] a man brother Ram said his toes were
[1:01:06] tied into the Earth like the roots of a
[1:01:08] tree but when the spirit of God broed
[1:01:11] across that body all of a sudden those
[1:01:13] toes begin to break loose and it begin
[1:01:16] to move around and it begin to walk
[1:01:17] around in God's kingdoms God's spoken
[1:01:19] word and when it walked around God
[1:01:21] spoken word it recognized the authority
[1:01:23] they had on the word of God and it stood
[1:01:25] there and it realized what was inside of
[1:01:27] it and God called that man Adam cuz it
[1:01:30] was just like
[1:01:32] God the first being was man that he
[1:01:35] called
[1:01:36] Adam now we've got the evidence of the
[1:01:38] word we say that same Spirit dwells in
[1:01:40] us that spoke to Adam and brought him to
[1:01:42] life right we got that same Spirit how
[1:01:45] do you how do you say that I ain't got a
[1:01:48] driver's license that tells me I got the
[1:01:50] same spirit I ain't got no physical
[1:01:52] identification right here I ain't got no
[1:01:54] tattoo on my arm
[1:01:56] it's not tattooed on my forehead but
[1:01:58] what I've got sit down inside of me is
[1:02:01] faith faith in God's word that he has
[1:02:03] spoken so if that faith that was inside
[1:02:06] of God when he begin to speak his word
[1:02:07] lays inside of me let me tell you what
[1:02:09] church there's evidence of a inside of
[1:02:12] you inside of you and all youve got to
[1:02:14] do is take the check but of faith and
[1:02:16] begin to write the
[1:02:17] checks what are we afraid of we're not
[1:02:20] lacking in
[1:02:21] faith we're not lacking in faith let me
[1:02:23] tell you we're not lacking in faith what
[1:02:25] got some 1100 some messages preached
[1:02:28] what is it doing building your
[1:02:30] faith faith is the evidence of un thing
[1:02:33] faith in action works without faith is
[1:02:35] dead brother preaches the works of Faith
[1:02:37] what is you doing calling the bride up
[1:02:39] into faith into the power of the Living
[1:02:41] God the recognize who they
[1:02:43] are we're not lacking look the funds are
[1:02:47] there but we're not lacking in
[1:02:49] faith but we're lacking in the ability
[1:02:53] to write the check
[1:02:56] I think we got some of the greatest
[1:02:57] people around you know I travel around a
[1:03:00] little bit and I run into different
[1:03:01] people go to different places and I feel
[1:03:04] just right at home I feel comfortable I
[1:03:07] don't feel I don't feel all like a ball
[1:03:09] of
[1:03:11] nerves why because faith has been
[1:03:13] established in the hearts of the people
[1:03:16] when faith is established in the hearts
[1:03:17] of the people they recognize who is
[1:03:19] among them and when you recognize it's
[1:03:22] not your faith but it's God's faith that
[1:03:23] is dwelling inside of you it's God's
[1:03:25] faith is took of his AB Boe inside of
[1:03:26] you now what is God's faith God's faith
[1:03:29] is his word given to you laying inside
[1:03:31] of there that whatever you have need of
[1:03:33] all you got to do is write out the
[1:03:35] checkbook look the checks won't
[1:03:38] bounce it doesn't matter how much you
[1:03:40] think well I think I'm G I'm a bank God
[1:03:42] bankrupt God on this right here look the
[1:03:45] checks won't
[1:03:46] bounce they wouldn't bounce look what
[1:03:48] happened to Egypt down in Egypt Israel
[1:03:51] went into Egypt because there was a
[1:03:54] famine in the land isn't that right
[1:03:56] so they went down in Egypt now notice
[1:03:58] what here what happened here as they're
[1:04:00] down in Egypt now in Exodus 1:7 now
[1:04:02] notice what be to take place here I want
[1:04:05] you to I want you to I want you just to
[1:04:07] catch some things here the Bible says
[1:04:10] here in verse 7 it says and the children
[1:04:12] of Israel were
[1:04:13] fruitful you're talking about a people
[1:04:15] in
[1:04:16] bondage they were fruitful and increased
[1:04:19] abundantly and
[1:04:20] multiplied and waxed exceedingly Mighty
[1:04:23] and the land was filled with them these
[1:04:25] are people blood Tom that are in bondage
[1:04:28] and they're multiplying and they're
[1:04:29] fruitful and they're they're they're
[1:04:31] growing they're prosperous they're
[1:04:33] they're let me tell you wherever they
[1:04:35] were at and they recognized who they
[1:04:37] were under the anointing of God they
[1:04:39] were blessed he says they now he says
[1:04:42] now now there rose up a new king over
[1:04:45] Egypt which knew not Joseph and he said
[1:04:46] unto his people behold the people of
[1:04:48] Israel are more and mightier than
[1:04:51] we come on let us deal wisely with them
[1:04:55] lest they multiply they've already done
[1:04:58] multiplied I guess he wasn't really
[1:05:00] seeing what was going on and it come to
[1:05:02] pass that when they were fallen out of
[1:05:04] any War they should join unto our
[1:05:06] enemies and fight against us and so get
[1:05:08] up out of the land therefore they did
[1:05:10] said over them test masers to afflict
[1:05:13] them with their burdens and they built
[1:05:16] for Pharaoh trasure cities fit them and
[1:05:18] Ramsey and the more they Afflicted them
[1:05:20] now notice the more they Afflicted them
[1:05:25] the more they multiplied and
[1:05:29] grew God is fulfilling his word right
[1:05:31] here cuz they are Abraham's seed that
[1:05:35] wherever they were at underneath
[1:05:37] Abraham's Covenant the seed Seed of
[1:05:40] Abraham God would blessed him right so
[1:05:42] now here they are in Affliction they
[1:05:45] multiplied and grew and it grieved be
[1:05:48] and they were grieved because of the
[1:05:49] children of Israel and the Egyptians
[1:05:52] made the children of Israel serve with
[1:05:54] rigor and they made their lives bitter
[1:05:57] in hard bondage and in mortar and brick
[1:05:59] and all manner of service in the field
[1:06:02] and they all their service whereing they
[1:06:03] may them serve with
[1:06:06] rigor but you know how in the world did
[1:06:09] they get to this place right
[1:06:11] here it's because they they come into
[1:06:14] this land because there was a
[1:06:17] famine and yet under the blessing of God
[1:06:21] upon their lives they multiplied and
[1:06:24] grew
[1:06:25] Pharaoh recognized that if he did not
[1:06:28] bring these people under captivity it
[1:06:31] would be a great detriment to them so
[1:06:34] slowly he begin to Rob them of their
[1:06:38] freedoms he begin to cut off the Avenues
[1:06:41] to which God would come and bless him
[1:06:45] with standing there and he might have
[1:06:47] been slipped in little things where and
[1:06:50] the task matters would put more burdens
[1:06:52] on them and cause them to work harder
[1:06:55] and actually set them up in Pharaoh's
[1:06:56] house separated mothers and daughters
[1:06:59] and sons and fathers and husbands and
[1:07:02] wives and they separated
[1:07:04] them but you know what was laying there
[1:07:07] the laying there was a promise that God
[1:07:09] had give Abraham says know for shity in
[1:07:12] Genesis 15 and13 he says know as shity
[1:07:16] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[1:07:19] land that is not theirs and Shall Serve
[1:07:22] them and they shall afflict them 400
[1:07:24] years
[1:07:26] and also that Nation whom they Shall
[1:07:29] Serve will I judge and afterward they
[1:07:33] shall come out with great
[1:07:35] substance so here the promise of
[1:07:38] Deliverance was already spoke by God and
[1:07:42] now here we find Israel Abraham's seed
[1:07:45] down in bondage and that God has sent
[1:07:48] his word out and that promise of
[1:07:51] deliverer had been laying there and
[1:07:53] maybe for 300
[1:07:56] 60 years that promise was laying there
[1:08:00] and it moved across a little woman that
[1:08:04] that promise come across and she birthed
[1:08:07] a son Called Moses yeah and brother says
[1:08:11] now Moses's mother would tell him look
[1:08:13] you are the deliverer of Israel you are
[1:08:16] a Hebrew you are the the a son of
[1:08:19] Abraham you're not a son of Pharaoh's
[1:08:22] sister you're not a son of Pharaoh's
[1:08:24] house h but you are a son of the Living
[1:08:27] God you're an
[1:08:29] Israelite and you see with that the
[1:08:32] promise of the Deliverance was laying in
[1:08:34] Abraham in
[1:08:36] Moses because God had already spoke the
[1:08:39] word to Moses Abraham and so when God be
[1:08:43] to speak the word now he recognized that
[1:08:46] the word had to go out now here stands a
[1:08:48] man that's been promised to be
[1:08:51] delivered and so what happened here is
[1:08:54] God began to move across cross that word
[1:08:56] and he be to hear the cries of his
[1:08:59] people what were they doing they were
[1:09:01] writing out
[1:09:03] checks they were writing out checks for
[1:09:06] deliverance checks of Faith was being
[1:09:09] set up let me tell you they were
[1:09:11] bombarding the Throne of
[1:09:13] heaven and it did not fall on deaf ears
[1:09:18] in Exodus 2 and 23 it says this and it
[1:09:20] come to pass in a process of time oh my
[1:09:24] that the king of Egypt died and the
[1:09:26] children of Israel sighed by reason of
[1:09:28] the
[1:09:30] bondage and they cried and their Cry
[1:09:33] came up to God by reason of the
[1:09:36] bondage their bondage their cries and
[1:09:39] bondage begin to reach God's
[1:09:42] ears aren't you glad that when you were
[1:09:44] in bondage your cries reached God's ears
[1:09:48] you remember where you were at you know
[1:09:50] where you were at I know where I was at
[1:09:52] God's cries the cries that reached God's
[1:09:55] ears and when those cries reach God's
[1:09:57] ears God had already set it back in
[1:09:59] motion before the world was ever created
[1:10:02] and you was in the mind of God God had
[1:10:04] already set it in motion what day and
[1:10:06] what hour that word would move across
[1:10:08] your
[1:10:10] life and the Bible says and God heard
[1:10:14] their
[1:10:16] groaning and God remembered his Covenant
[1:10:20] with
[1:10:21] Abraham and with Isaac and with Jacob
[1:10:24] and God looked upon the children of
[1:10:26] Israel and God had respect unto
[1:10:31] them what a place to be that God would
[1:10:34] have respect upon on
[1:10:36] them oh I think God has respect on
[1:10:40] us Moses come now he come as a deliverer
[1:10:45] fulfilling the word of
[1:10:48] God they wanted to have Fellowship back
[1:10:51] with their creator again they wanted the
[1:10:53] worship and the freedom that they were
[1:10:55] know KN that they were born to Worship
[1:10:56] in so God sent his gift down there among
[1:10:59] them look they didn't accept it at first
[1:11:01] they rejected it they rejected Moses at
[1:11:05] first because they said who are you
[1:11:06] you're just like the Egyptians you think
[1:11:08] by killing one of them you're going to
[1:11:09] set us free Moses when he begin to
[1:11:12] realize that he was the deliverer look
[1:11:13] he thought it was something he could do
[1:11:14] on his own
[1:11:16] accord he was a man of war he knew how
[1:11:18] to fight he knew how to lead great men
[1:11:20] in battle he knew how to do great things
[1:11:23] but you know what did God had to do he
[1:11:24] says God God had placed my word in you
[1:11:27] but Moses look I've got to take that all
[1:11:29] that the world has put in you I've got
[1:11:31] to take it out so he went up on the
[1:11:32] backside of a desert for 40 more years
[1:11:35] and God heed everything that the world
[1:11:37] had ever put in him HED it out of them
[1:11:39] now he stepped out of there that one day
[1:11:41] walking down across through there
[1:11:43] walking down through there stepped up in
[1:11:44] the feris church and Tabernacle and says
[1:11:46] Lord let my people
[1:11:49] go don't you think that's where you were
[1:11:51] at you were dwelling in Satan's
[1:11:53] Tabernacle let me tell you anywh where
[1:11:55] were God's down at his Satan's
[1:11:57] Tabernacle you were dwelling in there
[1:11:59] but God sent his word down there and
[1:12:01] there was somebody stood there with a
[1:12:02] staff in his hand and says let my people
[1:12:05] go oh my do you realize what was being
[1:12:08] spoke there when brother saw that Vision
[1:12:10] he says he saw the church bound behind
[1:12:13] those bars and he couldn't figure out he
[1:12:15] tried to break the bars and something
[1:12:17] come over him and says just speak the
[1:12:19] word and know he said he said gates of
[1:12:22] hell hounds of Hell give loose bars of
[1:12:24] sin give away what happened what
[1:12:26] happened the rush out of people crying
[1:12:29] under great anticipation of their
[1:12:32] freedom Lord oh my look now he says this
[1:12:36] in the spoken words The Original Seed he
[1:12:38] says like the mighty anointed Prophet
[1:12:41] Moses god knew oh my knew God would use
[1:12:45] him for he had proved Moses to be a
[1:12:47] servant by his peculiar birth at the
[1:12:51] right time now the Deliverance of
[1:12:52] Abraham's seed was at that time he says
[1:12:55] sure you get here Moses never stayed in
[1:12:57] Egypt and argued his scriptural points
[1:12:59] with
[1:13:00] them that's just the scripture let me
[1:13:02] just tell you it didn't say that he sat
[1:13:04] down and had debate with
[1:13:06] Pharaoh he just said let my people go
[1:13:09] Pharaoh says what are you talking about
[1:13:10] Moses already out the
[1:13:12] door he said God said let my people go
[1:13:15] he didn't stand there and fuss and argue
[1:13:16] with them he just gave them the word let
[1:13:19] the word take root look that's some
[1:13:21] sometimes these people want to stand
[1:13:22] around fuss and argue and debate let me
[1:13:23] just tell you if you back at up by the
[1:13:25] word we can have a talk we can have a
[1:13:27] conference but you you just try to pull
[1:13:29] stuff out of the air let me just tell
[1:13:31] you I ain't going to have no conference
[1:13:32] for that I'm not going to argue with
[1:13:34] you I'm just going to quote scripture
[1:13:36] and be
[1:13:37] gone I'm going to stand there and say
[1:13:39] what the Bible says well they say well
[1:13:41] we don't need that well you going to
[1:13:43] throw that out why don't we throw Paul

[1:14:03] ministry he say the John Wesley roll in
[1:14:05] his grave knowing what they were doing
[1:14:07] today let me just say this he would roll
[1:14:10] over you again if he knew what they were
[1:14:11] doing today and how much just arguing
[1:14:14] and fussing and fighting am among our
[1:14:17] ranks we realize in order to get out of
[1:14:19] this for the Covenant to come to pass we
[1:14:21] got to be unified behind the word of
[1:14:23] God and I'm not saying making treaties
[1:14:26] with the devil I'm not making a compact
[1:14:28] with the
[1:14:30] devil but notice he never fussed with
[1:14:32] the priest he went in the wilderness and
[1:14:34] waited on the Lord until the people was
[1:14:36] ready to receive him he had to come
[1:14:38] testified of them he had to come to
[1:14:41] testify of them and he would and they
[1:14:42] would receive him God called his Prophet
[1:14:44] to the Wilderness God testify he had
[1:14:46] chose him how did God testify he
[1:14:49] chosen he threw down his rod and become
[1:14:52] a snake Pharaoh says look
[1:14:55] my suavs can do the same thing they
[1:14:58] threw down their
[1:15:00] rods but what happened Moses Rod ate up
[1:15:03] all the other
[1:15:04] ones so we can do this that's God done
[1:15:08] this oh we can do this oh we can do this
[1:15:12] but there's only one thing they couldn't
[1:15:14] do they couldn't apply the token to keep
[1:15:17] the death angel
[1:15:19] out only God's elect had the ability to
[1:15:21] apply that
[1:15:22] token they come underneath the order of
[1:15:24] the word they applied the token he said
[1:15:27] God had notice he says oh get ready he
[1:15:30] says but the people the waiting for
[1:15:32] Moses are ready for the ready to receive
[1:15:34] Moses and the true sign overlooked he
[1:15:36] says Israel could not get into action
[1:15:38] down there with signs and wonders until
[1:15:39] they fell on their afas and prayed for
[1:15:41] God for a deliverer God had his
[1:15:43] deliverer God had a prophet hanging up
[1:15:45] there in the wilderness kept them there
[1:15:47] for 40 years waiting for them to get
[1:15:49] right to pray and when they got Right
[1:15:51] and started praying God sent the
[1:15:53] deliverer

[1:15:57] day look we were tied up look you go

[1:16:07] teeth on the messy Pew I'm going just
[1:16:08] tell you to be frank with you you were
[1:16:10] tied up in a denominational
[1:16:12] system people have tagged themselves
[1:16:15] saying they they they've been a message
[1:16:17] believer their whole life you know what
[1:16:18] you've done you've tied yourself because

[1:16:21] denominational system you're putting a
[1:16:23] name to it I'm not I'm not doing way
[1:16:26] with the message and I'm not doing way
[1:16:27] with the prophet but I want you to
[1:16:28] recognize it doesn't matter you've got
[1:16:30] to have a new birth to recognize that
[1:16:32] this is nothing but the truth of God
[1:16:35] your faith has got to come back to the
[1:16:36] word of God I'm not coming because Mama
[1:16:38] come or Daddy come or Grandma and
[1:16:40] Grandpa coming I want you to come
[1:16:42] because you got a revelation that God
[1:16:44] has come down inside of your heart and
[1:16:45] he has convicted the word inside of you
[1:16:47] and it's come in line with his word
[1:16:49] that's what we need in this
[1:16:51] hour you want to see a move among the
[1:16:53] young people get the word of God moving
[1:16:55] among them let him let the revelation of
[1:16:58] the word come in Satan knows he can jump
[1:17:00] and shout and do all that but when he
[1:17:02] cannot he cannot duplicate he cannot
[1:17:05] duplicate the faith of God in your
[1:17:07] life CU God has put it there he cannot
[1:17:10] replicate that he can counterfeit a lot
[1:17:13] of things in the message you anoing ones

[1:22:52] would eat that lamb he says they would
[1:22:53] go back there he says eating of that
[1:22:55] lamb when they walked out of there he
[1:22:56] says every single one of them he says
[1:22:58] the old paw with his crooked old back
[1:23:00] was now straight ma she might have been
[1:23:01] hunched over she was now straightened up
[1:23:03] there was not one person walked out of
[1:23:05] Egypt weak or feeble because they had
[1:23:07] partook of that lamb what is it they had
[1:23:09] partook of that healing remedy the
[1:23:11] dissolver of all doubts a dissolver of
[1:23:14] all illnesses and infirmities they had
[1:23:16] took part of that healing virtue and
[1:23:18] they recognized with the power that laid
[1:23:19] in that lamb and they took part of it
[1:23:21] look when they walked out of her not
[1:23:22] even a soul was on their feet the shoes
[1:23:25] of their feet ever wore
[1:23:27] out you talk about a promise you want to

[1:23:43] say this it's just as real today as it
[1:23:45] was 80 100 years ago even back 2000
[1:23:48] years ago the day of Pentecost it's the
[1:23:51] same Living Word that we're standing

[1:24:28] check that we've that we got to write a
[1:24:31] lot of benefits in this
[1:24:32] checkbook you don't like I said you
[1:24:34] don't have to worry about it bouncing
[1:24:36] I'm not worried about it being
[1:24:39] bankrupt because God put the funds in
[1:24:41] there God put his word in you and
[1:24:44] brother say this he says everything you
[1:24:46] have need of already lies inside of you
[1:24:49] so the word already lays inside of you
[1:24:50] Rapture and Faith already lays inside of
[1:24:52] you so if rapture and Faith lays already
[1:24:55] already lays inside you something's got
[1:24:57] to come across you and move across you
[1:25:00] all of a sudden the raise that up that's
[1:25:03] just my thinking you planted they
[1:25:05] planted corn we come down the road I see
[1:25:07] where they planted corn it rained the
[1:25:09] Corn's coming up I'm not very smart but
[1:25:13] I'm telling you that the Corn's coming
[1:25:16] up faith has been planted in the church
[1:25:19] for
[1:25:20] years we need the moving of the spirit
[1:25:23] I'm not saying we don't have it but I'm
[1:25:25] just saying we need it more than we ever
[1:25:26] needed it cuz I'm ready for a body
[1:25:30] change I tell you what I'm so tired to
[1:25:32] this Covenant one day I'm going to be
[1:25:34] like Enoch I'm going to walk right out
[1:25:36] of this
[1:25:37] body this old gray hair be black again I
[1:25:40] don't have to worry about no aches or
[1:25:42] pains I don't have to have perfect 2020
[1:25:45] Vision there be no dysi is in your body
[1:25:48] no more why because you're taking
[1:25:50] partakers of that Covenant it's tied
[1:25:52] you're so tied to it you can't get away
[1:25:54] from it oh in fellowship with God
[1:25:57] through reconciliation he says oh when a
[1:25:59] Believer comes like that God gives him a
[1:26:01] checkbook for any Redemptive blessing he
[1:26:03] died
[1:26:04] for oh in Jesus name it's signed at the
[1:26:07] bottom of it are you afraid to fill it
[1:26:10] out he says it now I'm just going to
[1:26:12] read I'm just going to tell you what he
[1:26:14] says he says if you're
[1:26:32] it says you're a
[1:26:35] coward I know I don't want to be a
[1:26:37] coward that song a coward in service has
[1:26:40] no place got to keep on the fire and
[1:26:43] line here we are he says if you're
[1:26:45] afraid to fill it out you're a coward he
[1:26:47] says you'll never come in contact with
[1:26:49] God but once you get in contact with God
[1:26:51] the holy spirit makes Christ real in
[1:26:52] your heart you're you're not afraid to
[1:26:54] take God at his word any time or believe
[1:26:58] not just on Wednesdays and not just on
[1:27:00] Sundays but he said anytime I'm talking
[1:27:03] about Monday morning I'm talking about
[1:27:05] Thursday morning I'm talking about
[1:27:06] Friday morning every any time at any
[1:27:09] place he says you come oh he says you
[1:27:12] make cond you're not afraid to take God
[1:27:13] his word at any time or believe so you
[1:27:16] take it and you believe it because
[1:27:17] you've been in contact with the
[1:27:19] supernatural you've come back into
[1:27:21] Fellowship you've come back into
[1:27:23] reconciliation through the blood and
[1:27:24] believe God and you know you've been in
[1:27:27] his divine
[1:27:29] presence so then God would say this in
[1:27:31] Ezekiel 16 and 62 would say and I will
[1:27:34] establish my Covenant with thee and thou
[1:27:37] shalt know that I am the Lord then in
[1:27:41] First Peter uh 1 3-5 he would say
[1:27:44] blessed be the god of our father Lord
[1:27:46] Jesus Christ who according to His
[1:27:48] abundant Mercy had begotten us again
[1:27:51] unto a lively Hope by the resurrection
[1:27:54] of Jesus Christ from the dead to The
[1:27:57] Inheritance now
[1:27:59] notice this is our
[1:28:01] hope this is where our faith lays right
[1:28:05] here our faith is not laying in what we
[1:28:09] could attain in this
[1:28:13] world what happened down there Lot's
[1:28:17] wife she had built up such a an image
[1:28:21] and a society and so much down there and
[1:28:24] Sodom that when the Angels come down
[1:28:26] there notice when the Angels come down
[1:28:28] there and said it's time to
[1:28:30] go don't tees it's just time to go we
[1:28:33] got to go you can't try to set this in
[1:28:36] order and set that in order it's time to
[1:28:39] go lot being with Abraham recognized who
[1:28:43] these men
[1:28:44] were so he stepped in order of the
[1:28:47] angels and they said Don't Turn
[1:28:51] back doesn't the Bible say remember
[1:28:53] lot's wife she turned back and she
[1:28:56] became a pillar of salt why because she
[1:28:59] had set so much of her inheritance
[1:29:02] uncorruptible
[1:29:03] things her hope was in those things that
[1:29:06] would that were corruptible yeah in the
[1:29:09] societies the women's society and the
[1:29:12] women's league and and then all the
[1:29:14] social aspects of her
[1:29:16] life the Bible says to an inheritance
[1:29:21] Incorruptible think of this
[1:29:24] Lots standing underneath there
[1:29:25] underneath those angels
[1:29:28] commission hearing those commissions of
[1:29:30] the Angel he recognizes they've come
[1:29:34] from an incomparable
[1:29:36] Place turns and tells his wife he says
[1:29:38] we got to go and don't look
[1:29:42] back here she is she becomes a pillar of
[1:29:46] salt lot continues on with the
[1:29:50] angels why because he recognized that he
[1:29:52] was going to a place of saf y oh your
[1:29:55] inheritance is Incorruptible and
[1:29:57] undefiled and fadeth not away reserved
[1:30:00] in heaven through you who are kept by
[1:30:02] the power of God through faith unto
[1:30:04] salvation ready to be revealed in this
[1:30:07] last
[1:30:10] time so God was going to send his
[1:30:13] word and drop an inheritance to you that
[1:30:17] is not a corruptible
[1:30:20] inheritance you don't have to worry
[1:30:21] about the storms of life taking it away
[1:30:23] from
[1:30:26] you people can come against you but you
[1:30:29] don't have to worry about them taking it
[1:30:30] out from you they'll come and try look
[1:30:34] Satan's job is trying to get you to
[1:30:38] disbelief that his weapon is superior
[1:30:42] than your weapon he's trying to get you
[1:30:45] brother say he say that that your weapon
[1:30:47] is
[1:30:49] inferior to his what do you've got
[1:30:52] you've been armed with faith
[1:30:54] and so when God drops his word inside of
[1:30:57] you that Covenant that oath of his
[1:30:59] promise look he's going to swear by
[1:31:01] himself there's no greater person that
[1:31:03] could stand behind this word than God
[1:31:05] himself no matter how much you would
[1:31:08] take it before a judge the judge can't
[1:31:10] stand look I can't stand behind it no
[1:31:13] more than I have to stand behind God's
[1:31:15] word so God would stand behind his word
[1:31:18] and he would drop that word inside your
[1:31:20] heart and you would recognize that it's
[1:31:22] God's word that is in you
[1:31:25] and when that God's word drops down
[1:31:27] inside of you now look Satan is trying
[1:31:29] to rob you and tell you what you've got
[1:31:32] the word of God is not able to
[1:31:36] overcome you got questions you're
[1:31:39] sitting on a fence about some things
[1:31:42] don't you worry about it stay with God's
[1:31:45] word God will manifest his word will he'
[1:31:49] done it time and time again he's not
[1:31:51] going to stop now
[1:31:54] you're wondering what is going on around
[1:31:56] the world let me tell you stay with
[1:31:57] God's word don't get focused on
[1:32:00] everything else stay with the word God
[1:32:02] gave his Covenant to
[1:32:04] you God placed his word inside of you
[1:32:08] you're the Church of the overcoming
[1:32:10] power the word of God lays inside of
[1:32:13] you it doesn't lay anywhere
[1:32:16] else it doesn't lay nowhere else and
[1:32:19] you're not
[1:32:21] cowards Satan would try to tell you
[1:32:23] you're a coward you don't believe God
[1:32:25] like so and so you know they got such
[1:32:27] great faith and seems like whenever they
[1:32:29] got trouble so God moves for them look
[1:32:31] don't you worry about
[1:32:33] that you tell even if you've got a
[1:32:35] mustard seed of Faith laying inside of
[1:32:37] you you let the Holy Spirit work over
[1:32:39] that Mustard Seed of
[1:32:41] Faith it's as mighty as seed but let me
[1:32:44] tell you you know when you eat something
[1:32:46] that's made out of
[1:32:47] mustard and then when the devil Begins
[1:32:49] the T taking of that sandwich he'll know
[1:32:51] that there's something inside of you
[1:32:53] said oh they got a little something they
[1:32:54] got a little mustard face inside them I
[1:32:57] can't eat of that sandwich no
[1:33:01] more but if you like look look I like
[1:33:04] mustard some people don't like mustard I
[1:33:08] don't you think about this I thought
[1:33:09] about this here while I go brother Tom I
[1:33:10] thought when I eat mustard I know it's
[1:33:12] on that sandwich you can put mayonnaise
[1:33:13] you can put ketchup you can put a lot of
[1:33:15] things on that
[1:33:16] sandwich but I know there's mustard on
[1:33:19] it and I like it I don't like Tula fish
[1:33:22] and I can know when there tuna fish in
[1:33:24] something cuz my taste buds tell me that
[1:33:26] there's tuna fish if I eat
[1:33:28] it so what do you got to do the devil
[1:33:31] wants to get one something let me tell
[1:33:33] you you just take give them a faith
[1:33:34] sandwich and say here devil eat this

[1:34:27] goodness they couldn't find no fault in
[1:34:30] him they could not find no fault in
[1:34:34] him because everything he was doing
[1:34:36] according to
[1:34:39] scripture and they looked at his body
[1:34:40] and said you saw you said you saw
[1:34:42] Abraham you're not a man over 50 years

[1:35:18] standing there in White and the
[1:35:19] righteousness of the Saints what is it
[1:35:20] it's God's righteous God's glory is
[1:35:22] whose word is upon on you it's nothing

[1:35:31] you it's not anything you could ever do
[1:35:33] it's not everything I could ever do I
[1:35:35] couldn't come to church and sit on a few
[1:35:37] enough there nothing I could ever do but
[1:35:39] I had to come to an altar I had to go
[1:35:41] through a baptism I had to get a filling
[1:35:43] of the Holy Spirit I've got to go every
[1:35:46] day to an altar in my
[1:35:47] heart and ask God to apply the blood to
[1:35:50] me at every moment of my life
[1:35:54] don't you think if if brother R need it
[1:35:56] don't you think we need it
[1:35:58] also he wasn't such a such a a a man
[1:36:02] anointed by God to recognize that he
[1:36:04] needed the righteousness of
[1:36:07] God don't you think that's why he
[1:36:08] carried he said that's why he had a
[1:36:10] cross hanging from his
[1:36:13] window I don't know watch maybe we need
[1:36:16] to do two
[1:36:18] crosses because there's two different
[1:36:20] Spirits now moving across the nation
[1:36:24] but look I'm so tied to this Covenant I
[1:36:26] can't walk away I'm so tied of it it's
[1:36:29] got me so bound to it I can't walk away
[1:36:32] do you ever try to run you ever listen
[1:36:34] you got a dog and you got it chained
[1:36:36] up and you you you you'll see if now if
[1:36:40] he's new you know he he know he doesn't
[1:36:42] know where his boundaries are he doesn't
[1:36:44] know how far he can
[1:36:45] go so he'll run and all a sudden that
[1:36:48] chain will jerk him back but over time
[1:36:50] he'll learn how far he can go and you'll
[1:36:53] see the rut in the yard where he runs at
[1:36:55] The Edge Edge of
[1:36:58] that and what did Brother R says oh you
[1:37:01] want to get on that driver watch that
[1:37:02] driver he says he runs and he he goes
[1:37:04] around that up that Mountain Road and he
[1:37:06] gets so close to that cliff and he's
[1:37:08] riding so close to that
[1:37:11] edge he says oh don't he's a skilled
[1:37:13] driver brother says I want to be with a
[1:37:15] man that hugs the
[1:37:17] mountain oh I want to be with that man
[1:37:20] and what do I want to be I want to be I
[1:37:22] don't want to be at the end living on
[1:37:24] the edge of loose living might I want to
[1:37:25] be sucked in behind that Veil behind the
[1:37:28] Tabernacle in the Tabernacle of God
[1:37:30] where the very divine presence of God is
[1:37:32] the supernatural power is laying there
[1:37:35] and all God's abilities are laying there
[1:37:37] and I'm eating of that Mana that's where
[1:37:39] I want to be sitting
[1:37:41] out I don't want to be sitting out on
[1:37:43] the edge of loose living and just
[1:37:45] confess Grace Grace Grace is kep me here
[1:37:48] Grace is put me back into his presence
[1:37:51] again oh I'm my say this he says the
[1:37:54] church the real believer is looking for
[1:37:56] the manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[1:37:58] something moving in their heart
[1:38:01] moving but I believe that we're here
[1:38:04] because we've had that moving of the
[1:38:06] spirit in our
[1:38:08] heart we are the answer for the age we
[1:38:13] are the answer for the age we are the
[1:38:15] manifestation of God's covenant God said
[1:38:18] even we our cries we were just like
[1:38:20] those people in Israel we are crying out
[1:38:22] for deliverance and God sent his word
[1:38:25] down Among
[1:38:28] Us why because he knew we were in
[1:38:32] bondage to
[1:38:33] sin and we needed an Avenue to get out
[1:38:37] and the only way God could get you out
[1:38:39] of your situation is he had to send his
[1:38:41] word to
[1:38:43] you and he didn't come and beat it over
[1:38:45] your
[1:38:46] head and bind you up and B you bring you
[1:38:49] in the laws but now he's put a Grace
[1:38:51] coming over you that you don't want to
[1:38:53] to do anything to offend
[1:38:55] him I don't want to do anything to
[1:38:57] offend him I want to do everything I can
[1:39:00] to please him I know it's hard it is
[1:39:03] hard I believe you I I it's hard it's
[1:39:05] struggle it's a real
[1:39:07] struggle but don't you ever give up on
[1:39:11] God cuz God didn't give up on
[1:39:14] you if God's word cannot lie and he
[1:39:16] stands behind his word let me tell you
[1:39:19] my word will fail but if I stand behind
[1:39:21] God's word I know what I'm standing
[1:39:23] behind
[1:39:24] I know what we're standing behind we're
[1:39:26] standing behind the unfailed
[1:39:27] unadulterated word of God this is this
[1:39:30] is the manifested word of God in this
[1:39:32] age this is Eagle food that we're eating
[1:39:35] of it's not something just to Pat us
[1:39:37] over but this Covenant has come alive
[1:39:39] inside of our hearts oh I've become a
[1:39:42] captive to it I have become a captive to
[1:39:46] it oh I've sold myself out to this many
[1:39:50] many years ago and there's many times
[1:39:52] I'm just coming be honest with you
