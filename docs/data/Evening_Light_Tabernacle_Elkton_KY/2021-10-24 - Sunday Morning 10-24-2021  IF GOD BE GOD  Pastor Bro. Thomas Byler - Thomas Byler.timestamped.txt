[28:42] this
[32:13] morning brothers and sisters beautiful
[32:14] day to be in the house of god
[32:17] ask us all to stand please
[32:22] birth bread would you open us a prayer
[32:32] so
[32:52] amen
[32:53] children can be dismissed for sunday
[32:55] school
[32:56] ask us open our bibles to first john 5.
[33:01] we're going to read verses 1 through 15.
[33:05] that's one together
[33:07] be first john 5.
[33:16] whosoever believeth that jesus is the
[33:18] christ is born of god and everyone that
[33:21] loveth them that beget loveth him also
[33:23] that is begotten of him
[33:32] for this is the love of god that we keep
[33:35] his commandments and his commandments
[33:37] are not grievous
[33:47] who is he that overcometh the world but
[33:49] he that believeth that jesus is the son
[33:51] of god
[34:06] for there are three that bear record in
[34:08] heaven the father the word and the holy
[34:11] ghost and these three are one
[34:22] if we receive the witness of men the
[34:25] witness of god is greater for this is
[34:27] the witness of god which he hath
[34:29] testified of his son
[34:44] and this is the record that god hath
[34:45] given up to us eternal life
[34:48] and this life is in his son
[34:57] these things have i written unto you
[34:59] that believe on the name of the son of
[35:01] god that ye may know that you have
[35:03] eternal life and that ye may believe on
[35:06] the name of the son of god
[35:17] last one together and if we know that he
[35:20] hear us whoever we ask we know that we
[35:23] have the petitions that we desired of
[35:25] him
[35:26] brother brian
[35:38] you can all be seated
[35:41] you know after reading those 15 words
[35:43] you can kind of say
[35:46] to yourself
[35:47] why are you worrying if god has settled
[35:49] it
[35:51] if you return with me to
[35:55] second timothy again but this time to
[35:56] the fourth chapter
[36:14] uh before i get started um i was just i
[36:16] forgot to tell you the last time
[36:19] our uh
[36:21] our general fund
[36:23] is
[36:24] right about a
[36:26] thousand dollars
[36:28] and i have to make a deposit this week
[36:30] which will
[36:31] probably make it a little bit more than
[36:33] that
[36:34] uh and
[36:35] i always give you a
[36:37] note on the principal
[36:39] before i get started we have about 83
[36:43] and 900 in
[36:45] principle left on this church
[36:47] and i was just thinking that's
[36:50] we were we've when we were in the old
[36:52] church before we started this new church
[36:54] i think we were at like 76 78 000
[36:59] on the old church
[37:00] before we started the new church so
[37:02] we're getting close to that point
[37:04] and it shouldn't start
[37:07] as we get ahead i'm i don't know if
[37:10] we'll uh
[37:11] we should beat the
[37:12] maturity date by a year or two if we
[37:15] keep going the way we're going but going
[37:17] to timothy the
[37:19] second timothy the fourth chapter
[37:22] you know i was in my office reading a
[37:25] little bit
[37:26] praying a little bit
[37:28] studying a little bit
[37:31] and uh
[37:32] i was just thinking
[37:34] everyone here this morning
[37:36] i don't god knows where you're at or
[37:38] what state you're at this morning
[37:40] but i was thinking of that message
[37:43] brother brown i'm preaching on
[37:44] identification
[37:46] and what you see going on in the church
[37:48] world or in the message or out there in
[37:50] the world
[37:52] is
[37:54] satan himself shaking everything that he
[37:56] can shake so people have no boundaries
[37:59] anymore they don't have anything to hold
[38:02] their faith or
[38:03] you know have anything to trust anymore
[38:05] so when they don't have those
[38:07] principles anymore everything is
[38:09] acceptable any nothing is unacceptable
[38:12] anymore and that's where we're at but it
[38:15] shouldn't be that way for a christian
[38:17] this morning you should you should have
[38:19] a path that you're walking no matter
[38:21] what they're doing out there
[38:23] that you have a path and whatever's
[38:25] going wrong or going right
[38:27] he taught him that message and
[38:28] identification you can't change who you
[38:30] are but we're not identified out there
[38:32] in the world we're identified in jesus
[38:34] christ and all those attributes that
[38:36] were in christ should also be in us this
[38:39] morning and let me read a few of these
[38:41] verses
[38:43] but
[38:44] you should it shouldn't worry you this
[38:46] morning whatever's going on in the
[38:48] church world or in the world if you have
[38:51] that foundation that's in christ
[38:54] i'm not saying it's easy i i would never
[38:56] say that
[38:57] but you shouldn't be running from place
[39:00] to place worrying for your position
[39:03] because your position is in jesus christ
[39:05] it gives you a hope gives you a
[39:08] grounding and i've always said this
[39:10] before christian hope
[39:12] it's settled god has settled it you're
[39:14] going to be there on that day that's the
[39:16] hope that you have if god started the
[39:18] walk in you he's going to finish that
[39:20] walk but let me
[39:22] read a few of these verses
[39:24] i charge thee therefore before god and
[39:27] the lord jesus christ we shall judge the
[39:30] quick and the dead at his appearing
[39:33] and in his kingdom preach the word and
[39:36] be instant in season and out of season
[39:39] reprove rebuke and exhort with all long
[39:42] suffering and doctrine
[39:44] and this is the fundamental for every
[39:46] person whether you're the the preacher
[39:48] of the church all the way down to the
[39:50] youngest person in the church paul's
[39:52] talking to everyone here
[39:55] and i i think i just read this preach
[39:57] the word the instant in season and out
[39:59] of season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[40:02] longsuffering and doctrine
[40:04] for the time will come they will not
[40:06] endure sound doctrine and after their
[40:08] own lust shall heap to themselves
[40:09] teachers have an itching ears and they
[40:12] shall turn away their ears from the
[40:14] truth and shall be turned to fables but
[40:16] watch thou in all things endure
[40:18] afflictions do the work of an evangelist
[40:22] and make full proof of thy ministry
[40:24] for i am now ready to be offered it and
[40:27] the time of my departure is at hand and
[40:30] he goes on to talk i have fought the
[40:31] good fight and i have finished the
[40:33] course and i have kept the faith and i'm
[40:35] gonna
[40:37] jump back here if you
[40:38] to the gospel of john here
[40:41] this morning
[40:43] you can tell i read these chapters here
[40:45] in the book of john a lot because my
[40:46] pages are coming out of my bible
[40:49] these
[40:50] uh these chapters if you turn with me to
[40:53] got the 16th chapter in the gospel of
[40:56] john
[41:00] so
[41:01] so whatever you see out there in the
[41:03] world whatever foundations you see being
[41:05] broken or far apart this morning
[41:08] you should have confidence as a
[41:09] christian that it shouldn't make a
[41:11] difference in you
[41:12] you know
[41:14] i don't know how else to say you know i
[41:17] i say this a lot can't get any
[41:19] it can get worse but i didn't think it'd
[41:21] get as bad as it's getting as quick as
[41:24] it's getting but then if you're looking
[41:26] out there for a baseline then you're
[41:28] going to be pretty miserable but i'll
[41:30] just read here i want to read the right
[41:35] go to the right place
[41:37] uh starting at about the 19th verse here
[41:40] and then i'm gonna jump
[41:42] jump to numbers the one thing i've
[41:44] learned in life that uh
[41:46] you can spend a lot of time on i'm 62
[41:49] years old you can waste just your time
[41:51] of your life and things that really
[41:53] don't matter but one day you realize
[41:56] that
[41:57] you know some of the things that you
[41:58] spend a lot of time doing as you get
[42:00] closer to the end of your life they
[42:02] really don't mean anything the only
[42:04] thing that really means anything is the
[42:07] time that you spend alone with the lord
[42:09] the time that you give him
[42:11] is really the only thing that has any
[42:14] meaning in life and the age of the world
[42:17] that we live in is trying to separate
[42:19] you
[42:20] from that time trying to separate you
[42:22] from getting closer to the lord it's
[42:24] trying to make you get further away and
[42:27] i'll just read this is 19th verse
[42:30] and jesus knew that they were the hours
[42:32] to ask him and said on them do you
[42:34] inquire among yourselves of what i said
[42:37] but a little while you shall not see me
[42:39] and again in a little while you shall
[42:41] see me
[42:42] verily i say unto you that that you
[42:44] shall weep and lay and lament but the
[42:47] world shall rejoice and you should be
[42:49] sorrowful but your sorrows will be
[42:50] turned to joy
[42:52] and a woman when he was in travail have
[42:54] sorrow because i didn't read the women
[42:57] once she is in travail have sorrow
[42:59] because their hours come
[43:01] but as soon as she's delivered of trial
[43:03] she remembers no more the anguish for
[43:06] the joy that a man is born into the
[43:08] world and you now therefore have sorrow
[43:10] but i will see you again and your heart
[43:12] shall rejoice
[43:14] your joy
[43:15] no man taketh away from you and that's
[43:17] where i'm hoping everyone's at this
[43:19] morning that the joy of christ the joy
[43:21] of this relationship that you have with
[43:24] jesus christ is there abiding in you
[43:26] this morning
[43:27] and that in that day he shall ask me
[43:29] nothing verily i say unto you whatsoever
[43:31] ye shall ask of the father in my name he
[43:34] will give you you know i was just
[43:36] thinking
[43:38] in this world
[43:39] they do everything they can to convince
[43:42] you that this is impossible for the day
[43:44] that we live in and but that's not you
[43:46] know the church world the natural world
[43:48] they try to attack that simple
[43:50] fundamental that god's
[43:53] it's not a big daughting grandfather
[43:55] that so it just
[43:56] has no concern for what's going on in
[43:59] the general life but it's actually
[44:00] something totally different for your
[44:02] living father jesus christ he cares
[44:05] about everything that's happening in
[44:07] your heart and your life every day of
[44:09] your life everything out there in the
[44:11] world is trying to tell you he doesn't
[44:13] everything in the scripture is telling
[44:14] you the opposite and he does and he goes
[44:17] um
[44:18] he goes in that day she'll ask me
[44:20] nothing very i say unto you whosoever
[44:22] shall ask of the father on my name he
[44:24] will give it to you hereafter you've
[44:26] asked nothing in my name ask and you
[44:28] shall receive that your joy may be full
[44:32] these things have spoken on to you in
[44:33] proverbs but the time cometh one i shall
[44:36] no more speak unto you in proverbs but i
[44:39] shall show you plainly of the father
[44:41] and at that day you shall ask in my name
[44:43] and i will say unto you that will i pray
[44:46] and the father for you for the father
[44:49] himself love with you because
[44:51] ye have loved me and you have believed
[44:53] that i've come from god i've come
[44:55] forth from the father and i've come into
[44:58] the world again and i leave the world
[45:00] and go on the father i'm not gonna i
[45:02] could i know i spent a lot of time
[45:04] reading but the the one thought i would
[45:07] have this morning i'm gonna turn to here
[45:10] you know
[45:12] um
[45:13] is don't ever forget that your your
[45:16] heavenly father jesus christ himself he
[45:19] cares about everything aspect of your
[45:21] life if you have a need you need to ask
[45:23] him don't don't be afraid to ask for
[45:26] something that you know that you need
[45:27] and i was just gonna
[45:29] you know
[45:30] you all know i was i'm not you can tell
[45:33] from my accent i'm not from around here
[45:35] as they like to say i'm not trying to be
[45:37] funny
[45:38] but you know i was raised a catholic boy
[45:40] and i always wondered
[45:42] you know that when you used to go to
[45:44] church or you go around the priest
[45:46] before you left they'd always they'd
[45:48] always have this incontaction that they
[45:50] would talk to you from
[45:52] but then
[45:52] then i realized not wanting to get too
[45:55] loud here
[45:56] that what they were saying to you
[45:58] is it came
[46:00] out of the bible and i'm just going to
[46:02] read what moses told aaron to
[46:05] to talk to the people one thing moses
[46:07] told aaron and told the priest that they
[46:09] were continually to put the word of god
[46:13] upon the people you know in that day and
[46:15] age not everyone was as fortunate as you
[46:17] that could read and write so the only
[46:19] communication they had from the lord was
[46:21] when the priests or the preachers read
[46:24] the word and presented it to the people
[46:26] and i'll just read what it has to say
[46:28] here
[46:29] and it's in you don't have to turn to it
[46:31] but it's if you want to write it down
[46:33] it's in the sixth chapter of numbers
[46:36] and then it's after the law of the
[46:38] nazarites and it starts at about
[46:41] and about the 26th verse of the sixth
[46:43] chapter of numbers and it said the lord
[46:45] spoke to moses and
[46:47] speak unto aaron and unto his son saying
[46:50] on this wise you shall bless the
[46:52] children of israel saying unto them
[46:55] the lord bless thee and keep thee the
[46:57] lord make his face to shine upon thee
[46:59] and be graces unto thee and the lord
[47:01] lift up thy continents upon thee and
[47:03] give thee peace and they shall put my
[47:05] name upon the children of israel and i
[47:08] will bless them and you know the whole
[47:10] purpose
[47:11] of this thing is a relationship between
[47:14] us and jesus christ his goal
[47:16] for anyone here this morning including
[47:18] myself is to be successful not in the
[47:20] world but in a relationship with jesus
[47:23] christ and this morning anyone sitting
[47:25] here you have all the weapons all
[47:27] everything you need to be successful one
[47:30] thing you have to be willing to yield
[47:32] yourself
[47:33] and then what i'm holding in my hand
[47:35] the message of the hour and the bible
[47:37] you have everything you need to be there
[47:39] on that day this morning you don't lack
[47:41] anything
[47:42] other than having that relationship

[1:15:32] verse um

[1:15:54] number 16 number 16.
[1:16:11] this is the story of
[1:16:13] nathan and korra
[1:16:16] nathan and cora
[1:16:26] nathan and korra
[1:16:29] actually
[1:16:32] first kings 19.
[1:16:39] first kings 18
[1:16:42] hold on a minute
[1:16:45] if the lord be god follow him no it is
[1:16:48] right it's correct let's go with first
[1:16:50] kings first that's my second story first
[1:16:53] kings 18
[1:16:55] forgive me
[1:17:10] okay first kings 18 and verse 19 now
[1:17:13] therefore sinned and gathered
[1:17:16] to me all israel unto mount carmel and
[1:17:19] the prophets of baal
[1:17:20] 450
[1:17:22] and the prophets of the groves 400 which
[1:17:25] eat at jezebel's table
[1:17:28] so ahab sent unto all the children of
[1:17:30] israel and gathered the prophets
[1:17:32] together unto mount carmel
[1:17:34] and elijah came unto all the people and
[1:17:37] said how long
[1:17:39] halt ye between two opinions
[1:17:42] if the lord be god follow him
[1:17:44] and if baal then follow him
[1:17:47] and the people answered him not a word
[1:17:50] and then said elijah unto the people i
[1:17:52] even i only remain a prophet of the lord
[1:17:56] but baal's prophets are
[1:17:59] 450 men
[1:18:01] let them therefore give us two bullocks
[1:18:04] and let them choose one bullock for
[1:18:05] themselves and cut it in pieces and lay
[1:18:08] it on the wood and put no fire under it
[1:18:11] and i will dress the other block and lay
[1:18:13] it on the wood and put no fire under it
[1:18:16] and call ye on the name of your gods and
[1:18:19] i will call on the name of the lord
[1:18:22] for the god that answereth
[1:18:25] with fire
[1:18:27] let him be
[1:18:29] god amen
[1:18:31] and all the people answered and said it
[1:18:33] is well spoken now i'll notice here how
[1:18:36] that there is a challenge made between
[1:18:41] balaams worshipers balaams prophets and
[1:18:44] so forth on the side of jezebel and ahab
[1:18:47] and also elijah so he makes a challenge
[1:18:50] to them to find out
[1:18:52] who is god
[1:18:53] amen who is
[1:18:55] really
[1:18:56] uh the true god amen
[1:18:58] and how many knows that this what god
[1:19:00] does
[1:19:01] now elijah in verse 25 and elijah said
[1:19:04] unto the prophets of baal
[1:19:06] choose you one bullock for yourself and
[1:19:08] dress it
[1:19:09] first for ye are many and call on the
[1:19:12] name of your gods but put no fire under
[1:19:14] and they took the bullock which was
[1:19:16] given them and addressed it and called
[1:19:18] on the name of baal
[1:19:20] from morning even until noon saying
[1:19:23] obeyo
[1:19:24] hear us
[1:19:26] but there was no voice
[1:19:28] nor any that answered and they leaped
[1:19:31] upon the altar which
[1:19:33] which was made
[1:19:35] and it came to pass at noon that elijah
[1:19:37] mocked them
[1:19:39] notice it's a half a day later
[1:19:42] mocked them and said cry aloud for he is
[1:19:46] a god
[1:19:47] either he is talking or he is pursuing
[1:19:51] or he is in a journey or pre-adventure
[1:19:55] he sleepeth and must be awakened
[1:19:58] and they cried aloud and cut themselves
[1:20:01] after
[1:20:02] their manner with knives and lancets
[1:20:04] till the blood gushed out of them
[1:20:08] and it came to pass that mid when midday
[1:20:10] was passed and they prophesied until the
[1:20:13] time of the offering of the evening
[1:20:15] sacrifice that there was neither voice
[1:20:18] nor any answer nor any that regarded
[1:20:21] and elijah said unto all the people come
[1:20:24] near unto me
[1:20:25] and all the people came near unto him
[1:20:27] and he prepared the altar of the lord
[1:20:30] that was broken down and elijah took
[1:20:33] 12 stones according to the number of the
[1:20:36] tribes of israel or the sons of jacob
[1:20:39] unto whom the word of the lord came
[1:20:41] saying israel shall be thy name
[1:20:44] and with the stones he built an altar in
[1:20:47] the name of the lord and he made the
[1:20:49] trench about the altar as great as would
[1:20:52] contain two measures of seed
[1:20:55] and he put the wood in order and cut the
[1:20:57] blocks in pieces and laid them on the
[1:20:59] wood and said
[1:21:00] fill four barrels with water and pour it
[1:21:03] on the burnt offerings and on the wood
[1:21:06] and he said do it the second time and
[1:21:09] they did it the second time and he said
[1:21:11] do it the third time and they it the
[1:21:13] third time and the water ran round about
[1:21:16] the altar and he filled the trench also
[1:21:18] with water and it came to pass at the
[1:21:20] time of the offering of the evening
[1:21:22] sacrifice that elijah the prophet came
[1:21:24] near and said lord god of abraham and of
[1:21:27] isaac
[1:21:28] and of israel let it be known this day
[1:21:31] that thou art god
[1:21:33] in israel
[1:21:35] and i am thy servant and that i have
[1:21:37] done all these things at thy word
[1:21:40] hear me o lord hear me that these people
[1:21:43] may know that thou art the lord god
[1:21:46] and that thou has turned their
[1:21:48] thou has turned their back heart back
[1:21:50] again
[1:21:51] then the fire of the lord fell and
[1:21:53] consumed the burnt sacrifices and the
[1:21:55] wood and the stones and the dust
[1:21:57] and licked up the water that was in the
[1:21:59] trenches when all the people saw it they
[1:22:02] fell on their faces and they said the
[1:22:04] lord
[1:22:05] he is god
[1:22:08] he is the god the lord he is the god
[1:22:12] amen
[1:22:13] praise the lord
[1:22:15] can you say praise the lord this morning
[1:22:18] and elijah said unto them take the
[1:22:20] prophets of baal
[1:22:22] and let not one of them escape and they
[1:22:24] took them and elijah brought them down
[1:22:26] to the brook kishron and slew them there
[1:22:30] amen may god add his blessing to the
[1:22:31] reading of the word she can be seated
[1:22:36] i title this if god
[1:22:39] be god
[1:22:40] amen
[1:22:42] if god
[1:22:44] be god amen if the lord here it says if
[1:22:47] he is lord
[1:22:49] amen then serve him why halt she between
[1:22:52] two opinions
[1:22:54] if god is god if our lord is the lord
[1:22:57] then serve him and if baal then serve
[1:22:59] him
[1:23:00] now how many remembers that when brother
[1:23:02] branham went to india he made that same
[1:23:05] challenge and while he was making that
[1:23:07] challenge he told those people in india
[1:23:09] he says now the sikhs and the jains and
[1:23:12] all of these different ones they're all
[1:23:14] basically kind of like the people are in
[1:23:16] america between the baptists and the
[1:23:18] methodists the pentecost and everybody's
[1:23:20] you know always trying to proselyte one
[1:23:22] from another and and really all it's
[1:23:25] doing is changing your ideas
[1:23:28] that's really all it's doing
[1:23:32] um
[1:23:32] but he made a challenge to him and he
[1:23:34] says you know if your god is god let him
[1:23:37] come on uh for the first night it was a
[1:23:39] death and a dumb boy that was healed he
[1:23:41] says let him come and open up his ears
[1:23:43] and let him be able to speak and of
[1:23:45] course you know the lord jesus christ
[1:23:48] the resurrected jesus christ of 2000
[1:23:50] years ago amen came down and healed the
[1:23:53] boy
[1:23:54] but abraham said that he couldn't barely
[1:23:55] get away from the platform or whatever
[1:23:57] they had to have the militia because
[1:23:58] those indians as you know they worship
[1:24:01] anything
[1:24:02] amen everything ants insect just about
[1:24:06] anything to worship amen when they see
[1:24:08] that kind of power displayed of course
[1:24:11] spider-man said they'll grab your shoes
[1:24:13] they'll rip your clothes off of you
[1:24:14] almost and man just to touch you and so
[1:24:17] forth you know they don't really
[1:24:18] understand
[1:24:19] but you know the next night of course
[1:24:21] the blind man brother baptism says he
[1:24:22] had never made the challenge if he
[1:24:24] hadn't seen it in the vision that god
[1:24:26] was going to do it
[1:24:28] amen and he says you know basically he
[1:24:30] said if your god is god whoever's god is
[1:24:33] the real god
[1:24:34] come up and open this darn man's eyes
[1:24:37] amen
[1:24:38] now how many knows for the most part we
[1:24:41] as human beings we all follow a man
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:46] amen in the days of john the baptist we
[1:24:49] know that they followed john the baptist
[1:24:51] and he pointed them to christ and when
[1:24:53] christ came they followed christ when
[1:24:55] paul came along he says follow me
[1:24:58] as i follow christ isn't that right so
[1:25:01] we follow the teachings of paul
[1:25:03] is that right because he was inspired of
[1:25:05] god amen because god always has a man if
[1:25:08] god would have could have chose god
[1:25:10] could have chose anything to preach the
[1:25:12] gospel he could have chose anybody to
[1:25:15] use
[1:25:16] to preach the gospel but he chose man
[1:25:19] amen so and god uses man god has his
[1:25:22] seven stars in his hands he always uses
[1:25:24] mankind amen but you know to think just
[1:25:28] just to think this morning
[1:25:30] you know that we're following a man
[1:25:33] isn't that right we follow brother
[1:25:34] branham
[1:25:36] you know awful quiet this morning not
[1:25:38] ashamed of that are you
[1:25:40] no because why because he followed
[1:25:44] the teachings of paul right
[1:25:46] follow me as i follow christ because he
[1:25:48] know he paul he preached exactly what
[1:25:51] paul preached whenever he was beyond the
[1:25:53] curtain of time and
[1:25:54] and you've got to be judged for what
[1:25:56] you've preached
[1:25:58] you'll be judged for what you've
[1:25:59] preached and he says well will paul have
[1:26:01] to be judged for what he was preached
[1:26:02] and the angel says yep he's going to
[1:26:04] have to be judged well i'll praise be to
[1:26:06] god i'll be all right because i preached
[1:26:08] just what he preached
[1:26:10] how many knows that's important because
[1:26:12] if you have paul said if an angel from
[1:26:14] heaven come and preach anything other
[1:26:16] than what we have preached in his name
[1:26:18] let him be a curse so it's very
[1:26:19] important to preach what paul preached
[1:26:22] amen but to think this morning that we
[1:26:24] follow a man that has actually god used
[1:26:27] in such a way
[1:26:29] that he used him in the same measure as
[1:26:32] god used this elijah
[1:26:34] and that right this elijah to challenge
[1:26:37] those religions back then to see who's
[1:26:40] really god
[1:26:43] and you know the thing of it is folks
[1:26:45] it's not just it didn't happen just
[1:26:47] there just think about that that deaf
[1:26:49] and dumb
[1:26:50] boy that was healed and he could speak
[1:26:52] again or the blind man who had been
[1:26:54] worshipping the son because he was
[1:26:56] taught wrong
[1:26:58] and he had and then his eyesight was
[1:27:00] restored and that was his sign that
[1:27:03] only god can do that i mean those only
[1:27:06] god can do that
[1:27:07] and just to see a blind man's eyes being
[1:27:10] restored or a death in a dumb boy being
[1:27:13] healed how many knows that's just the
[1:27:15] earnest of our resurrection if god can
[1:27:18] do something like that and restore
[1:27:20] something like that he can restore this
[1:27:22] entire body
[1:27:25] back to the way that it was supposed to
[1:27:26] be to be at the beginning
[1:27:30] amen so if god be god
[1:27:33] now we're talking about god talking
[1:27:35] about his attributes and who he really
[1:27:37] is
[1:27:38] now
[1:27:40] i just wanted to
[1:27:43] talk a little bit
[1:27:44] to start with this morning
[1:27:47] about his attributes
[1:27:48] now i'm not going to mention very many
[1:27:50] of them this morning i want to bring
[1:27:52] that picture with all of those titles of
[1:27:54] all that he is
[1:27:56] everything from he is uh he is um the
[1:28:00] alpha he's the omega he's the beginning
[1:28:02] he's the end he's uh he's the chief
[1:28:05] shepherd of our souls he's the father
[1:28:08] he's the son
[1:28:10] he's the holy ghost
[1:28:12] amen you've heard it say many times god
[1:28:14] the father god the son
[1:28:16] god the holy ghost
[1:28:18] amen and they see three gods
[1:28:21] well if every time that you made a god
[1:28:23] out of a title we'd have many many many
[1:28:25] gods
[1:28:27] huh
[1:28:28] but you know we found out that he is god
[1:28:31] the father he is god the son he is god
[1:28:34] in the form of the holy ghost it was the
[1:28:36] same god
[1:28:37] in three different offices
[1:28:40] amen and i got to thinking of how many
[1:28:42] offices how many offices just
[1:28:45] i hold
[1:28:47] or you whole just think of the titles we
[1:28:49] call them titles
[1:28:52] you know in another place the title of
[1:28:54] father a tiny little title of son hold
[1:28:56] some titles and i just wrote down here
[1:28:58] that i am a son i hold the title of
[1:29:00] being a son i hold the title of being
[1:29:03] brother i hold the title of being a
[1:29:05] cousin i hold the title of being uncle i
[1:29:08] hold the title of husband i hold the
[1:29:10] title of father i hold the title of
[1:29:13] grandfather i hold the title of
[1:29:15] carpenter i hold the title of pastor i
[1:29:17] hold the title of leader i hold the
[1:29:19] title of bishop i hold the title of
[1:29:22] being a christian what are you well i'm
[1:29:24] a christian you hold all those titles
[1:29:28] those are all things that you are as an
[1:29:30] individual but you're just one person
[1:29:33] and that's the way it is god he is just
[1:29:35] one person there's only one god i'm at
[1:29:38] least there's only one god
[1:29:40] there's not three different gods don't
[1:29:42] ever get that in your head hero israel
[1:29:45] the lord your god is one
[1:29:48] lord
[1:29:49] only one there's only one lord one faith
[1:29:52] one baptism the bible says so anytime
[1:29:54] you get three remember heathenism is to
[1:29:57] have many gods
[1:30:00] heathenism is when you have more than
[1:30:02] one god
[1:30:03] amen
[1:30:05] you know like i said thomas got that one
[1:30:07] thing right whenever he bowed down for
[1:30:08] me he said before him he says my lord
[1:30:11] and my god
[1:30:13] jesus whenever he was washing the
[1:30:15] disciples feet and so forth he says you
[1:30:16] know
[1:30:17] you call me master and lord and you say
[1:30:22] well
[1:30:23] for so i am amen
[1:30:26] i believe it was uh in matthew it talks
[1:30:28] about that they were supposed to go into
[1:30:30] all nations baptizing in them in the
[1:30:32] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:30:34] the holy ghost in acts 2 he says no
[1:30:37] assuredly that god has made this same
[1:30:40] jesus whom you have crucified he has
[1:30:42] made him both lord
[1:30:44] and christ so all three of them was
[1:30:47] jesus christ the lord father the son
[1:30:49] jesus and christ the holy ghost he's all
[1:30:52] three of them amen jesus whenever he was
[1:30:55] going to be crucified he says i lay my
[1:30:57] life down and i take it back up again
[1:31:02] you know there's one thing that we would
[1:31:03] expect of a god and that is that he
[1:31:05] could not be killed
[1:31:08] you could not kill a god but you know
[1:31:10] isn't it something that a god can
[1:31:12] actually
[1:31:13] die
[1:31:14] and then rise again
[1:31:16] that's really a god
[1:31:18] [Laughter]
[1:31:20] are you with me to think he can actually
[1:31:22] die and then raise back up again
[1:31:25] now we know the spirit left the body of
[1:31:27] jesus isn't that right amen and then
[1:31:29] jesus died or he would have never died
[1:31:31] but that spirit will never die but the
[1:31:33] body could die the spirit can never die
[1:31:35] or you'd it'd be all over with
[1:31:37] but amen so we think about that think
[1:31:39] about the father the son the holy ghost
[1:31:41] he's got all these different titles amen
[1:31:44] and you know i want to say this it's
[1:31:46] just attributes these are just things
[1:31:48] attributes that god is
[1:31:51] amen
[1:31:52] we call them many times god the father
[1:31:55] god the father he's the father of all
[1:31:58] he's the dad of all
[1:32:00] amen over in uh i believe it's in
[1:32:06] malachi let me just read it
[1:32:09] over in
[1:32:10] malachi jesus i mean god says in the old
[1:32:14] testament he says it this way a son
[1:32:16] honoreth his father and a servant his
[1:32:20] master if i then be a father
[1:32:24] where is my
[1:32:26] honor
[1:32:28] amen how many knows that you know
[1:32:31] most of us by no doubt everybody in here
[1:32:35] amen raising the message especially we
[1:32:38] are taught respect for our parents
[1:32:42] amen
[1:32:45] if you you learn it the hard way if you
[1:32:47] don't learn it quick and most of the
[1:32:49] time it takes a good licking takes a
[1:32:50] good whooping for you to learn that
[1:32:53] you don't talk to like a mama like that
[1:32:55] you don't talk to your daddy like that
[1:32:56] amen you learn respect and god says here
[1:32:59] if i am a father
[1:33:01] amen then where is my honor
[1:33:04] and if i be a master where is my
[1:33:07] reverence or my fear
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:13] that's why i thought about this message
[1:33:14] of god be god
[1:33:17] don't you know that when you think about
[1:33:18] when you just try to comprehend
[1:33:21] god trying to comprehend who he really
[1:33:24] is because we've already mentioned some
[1:33:26] of the things that he is he has the
[1:33:28] ability he had made everything that is
[1:33:30] made everything was made was made by him
[1:33:32] amen and many times paul
[1:33:35] even paul if i remember right
[1:33:41] i believe it was in ephesians it talks
[1:33:42] about
[1:33:44] he says everything was created by him
[1:33:46] and for him without him was not anything
[1:33:49] created that was created isn't that
[1:33:51] right
[1:33:53] that's right so you know he many times
[1:33:55] he refers even
[1:33:57] yeah right here it is in colossians 1
[1:34:00] it talks about in verse 15 who is
[1:34:02] invisible the image jesus christ was the
[1:34:04] invisible
[1:34:05] image of the invisible god he was the
[1:34:08] image of the invisible god the firstborn
[1:34:11] of every creature for by him were all
[1:34:14] things created that are in heaven and
[1:34:16] that are in earth visible and invisible
[1:34:19] whether there be thrones or dominions or
[1:34:21] principalities or powers or things
[1:34:25] all things were created by him and for
[1:34:28] him
[1:34:31] amen think about your world
[1:34:34] think about everything you built you
[1:34:35] built your house you built your garage
[1:34:37] you do this you build your business you
[1:34:38] know those things you build those things
[1:34:41] that were created by you and what for
[1:34:44] you
[1:34:44] those things are yours
[1:34:46] and that's the way this whole thing is
[1:34:48] he was created by him and
[1:34:51] for him
[1:34:53] amen now notice he says and all things
[1:34:55] were created by him and for him and he
[1:34:57] is before all things and by him all
[1:35:00] things consists
[1:35:01] and of course he's the head of the body
[1:35:03] the church who is the beginning but the
[1:35:05] point that paul makes you find people
[1:35:07] peter also different places whenever
[1:35:09] these preachers get the preaching they
[1:35:11] talk about a god that has made
[1:35:15] everything
[1:35:16] amen how many glad to be serving because
[1:35:19] there is only one god only one true god
[1:35:22] now how many of those
[1:35:24] god means object of worship therefore
[1:35:26] there are
[1:35:27] many gods
[1:35:30] amen even the bible talks about would
[1:35:32] you choose what god you're going to sue
[1:35:34] you know what you who you're going to
[1:35:36] serve
[1:35:37] the god of baal or the god of you know
[1:35:39] the lord the lord god amen so it's the
[1:35:42] object of worship but as far as god
[1:35:44] himself and his essence there is only
[1:35:47] one
[1:35:48] true
[1:35:49] living god all else are false
[1:35:54] all else can't do anything for you
[1:35:59] i don't care if it's buddha muhammad all
[1:36:02] of that even remember brother baum says
[1:36:04] he says you know christianity
[1:36:06] is the only real religion
[1:36:12] how do you reckon that would go over in
[1:36:13] the white house right about this morning
[1:36:16] would that be uh taking everybody in
[1:36:20] no it wouldn't be it would be putting
[1:36:22] everybody out
[1:36:23] it wouldn't be very popular at all
[1:36:26] no but we're here to tell you there's
[1:36:28] only one god
[1:36:30] there's only one lord one thing all else
[1:36:33] is wrong
[1:36:36] i want to with the help of the lord this
[1:36:38] morning i want to try to emphasize on
[1:36:40] each with each and every one of us that
[1:36:42] even in the ranks all the way down to
[1:36:44] the ranks of this message you have to be
[1:36:46] careful and you've got to make sure that
[1:36:49] what you believe
[1:36:51] and the god you serve is truly the right
[1:36:54] god
[1:36:58] make sure
[1:36:59] make sure you're on the right side
[1:37:05] okay
[1:37:06] because just as i i mean just i might
[1:37:08] just uh
[1:37:09] rehearse this rather than read over
[1:37:11] there in numbers where nathan and carl
[1:37:13] rose up against moses and they say you
[1:37:16] know you're not the only holy one
[1:37:20] god works with these princes he works
[1:37:22] with these people here and he works with
[1:37:24] those people there and here you are
[1:37:26] putting yourself
[1:37:28] above us
[1:37:30] and moses when he heard it fell on his
[1:37:33] face because he knew
[1:37:35] that this was not
[1:37:38] a good thing
[1:37:43] maybe nathan
[1:37:44] thought it was a light thing hey the
[1:37:46] holy ghost works with us too
[1:37:49] huh
[1:37:50] not just you
[1:37:51] the number one huge mistake that nathan
[1:37:55] and korra made was that they've said
[1:37:58] that you put yourself above us that was
[1:38:01] a lie from the devil
[1:38:04] because moses did not put himself over
[1:38:08] those folks moses didn't even want the
[1:38:10] job
[1:38:13] but god chose him and when they spoke
[1:38:16] against god had put him like that and
[1:38:19] when god had put him like that because
[1:38:22] oh my
[1:38:23] think about when god sets something up
[1:38:26] god doesn't go in the middle of that and
[1:38:28] come fighting against that not god won't
[1:38:32] no it's always the devil that comes
[1:38:35] working and fighting against what god
[1:38:37] has already set up
[1:38:40] amen
[1:38:42] and it's a different god it might be the
[1:38:44] same name might proclaim christianity
[1:38:48] might claim to be the message
[1:38:51] but it's not god
[1:38:53] it's not truly god
[1:38:55] amen and sometimes the only way that
[1:38:57] you'll know is when god comes down
[1:38:59] and proves it and vindicates
[1:39:02] who's right
[1:39:03] and who's wrong
[1:39:05] and in every case remember this amen
[1:39:08] here these 400 prophets how did they end
[1:39:11] up
[1:39:14] dead
[1:39:16] nathan and cora in their decision are
[1:39:18] thinking they're holy too
[1:39:21] how did they end up
[1:39:23] dead
[1:39:24] why because they come against almighty
[1:39:27] god they had an idea of their own
[1:39:32] oh my
[1:39:34] and it took that moses said bring your
[1:39:36] censors do the priests work do whatever
[1:39:38] bring your senses and he says we're
[1:39:41] gonna see who god is really god or who
[1:39:43] god really has chosen is what we're
[1:39:46] gonna see
[1:39:48] amen and when they came up before the
[1:39:50] door and brought their senses god said
[1:39:51] to moses separate yourself from their
[1:39:54] company that i may consume them in a
[1:39:59] moment
[1:40:02] how many believe we got to watch every
[1:40:03] thought to go through our mind
[1:40:06] you got to make sure that you're on the
[1:40:08] right side
[1:40:13] amen
[1:40:14] you got to be make sure
[1:40:16] that you're on god's side
[1:40:18] and that god is
[1:40:20] with
[1:40:21] you
[1:40:23] because he won't be on both
[1:40:25] no he's not on both he wasn't on date
[1:40:27] and i yeah yeah you're i don't know he
[1:40:30] wasn't
[1:40:31] he's on one or the other
[1:40:34] just the same as he was with elijah and
[1:40:37] baal he wasn't them and us it's not it's
[1:40:40] not all religions together no it's not
[1:40:44] let me say something this morning
[1:40:47] you might think well what about the
[1:40:48] baptist the methodist
[1:40:50] armies the mennonite and all of the what
[1:40:53] about all of those religions
[1:40:55] what about all these other ones
[1:40:59] the very same one who challenged the
[1:41:02] buddha that seeks the chains and all of
[1:41:05] that he said if your god is god let him
[1:41:07] come up here and we'll see who it is
[1:41:11] well i didn't say a while ago was that
[1:41:12] that oh my to follow a man that almost
[1:41:15] every sermon that he preached could say
[1:41:18] now if he is still here let him come and
[1:41:21] show himself and he would come and jesus
[1:41:24] christ would come and prove himself
[1:41:26] service after service after service
[1:41:27] after service after service after
[1:41:29] service
[1:41:30] huh i'll follow something like that
[1:41:33] won't you
[1:41:35] amen
[1:41:36] to think that same prophet said
[1:41:40] baptist medicine is pentecostal even
[1:41:44] pentecostals he said they
[1:41:47] are
[1:41:50] dead
[1:41:52] he declared him dead
[1:41:54] god's not with him
[1:41:58] y'all getting quiet on me
[1:42:01] go back and listen to their tape
[1:42:03] he said they're dead
[1:42:06] how many knows i would never say that in
[1:42:08] myself
[1:42:10] i say it because they vindicated prophet
[1:42:12] said it
[1:42:13] amen i wouldn't but yet he did
[1:42:16] and guess what look at the fruits the
[1:42:18] fruits show their dad
[1:42:20] oh yeah it shows you that they're
[1:42:22] drifting further and further and further
[1:42:25] away from god all the time
[1:42:29] think about it think about that message
[1:42:30] believers we have coming way down the
[1:42:32] journey a long way now and if you aren't
[1:42:35] careful
[1:42:36] you will slowly die yourself
[1:42:40] huh you'll go the wrong direction you'll
[1:42:42] go backwards inside the front forward
[1:42:45] now i'm telling you right now i don't
[1:42:47] believe that those who are gonna be in
[1:42:49] the rapture are gonna go backwards
[1:42:51] they're gonna go forwards they're gonna
[1:42:53] keep getting closer to god
[1:42:55] preacher or no preacher inspiration no a
[1:42:58] good church or not a good church real
[1:43:00] genuine you believe they're gonna find a
[1:43:02] cornfield they're gonna find some way to
[1:43:04] get closer to god
[1:43:08] nothing will stop them
[1:43:10] because we're fixing to go on the body
[1:43:12] change folks
[1:43:15] he is the author and the finisher of our
[1:43:18] faith aren't you glad that that's one of
[1:43:20] his titles is he has begun the good work
[1:43:22] and you is able to perform it
[1:43:26] praise be to god
[1:43:28] how many believe it's important to be on
[1:43:30] god's side
[1:43:32] he was on god's side
[1:43:35] moses didn't just
[1:43:36] you know he didn't allow god just to
[1:43:38] consume him in the moon he fell down
[1:43:40] before him and then god says okay go
[1:43:42] over there and tell him whoever wants to
[1:43:44] be on your side to come away from the
[1:43:45] camp of nathan and so forth get away
[1:43:48] from their camps
[1:43:50] huh he give him a chance and don't you
[1:43:53] know what the earth began to shake
[1:43:55] everybody that decided to come over on
[1:43:57] the moses side amen they were glad that
[1:44:00] they
[1:44:04] did why
[1:44:07] because moses says if uh
[1:44:09] they die a common death then god's not
[1:44:12] with me
[1:44:13] but if some strange things happen like
[1:44:15] the earth opens up its mouth and
[1:44:17] swallows them up
[1:44:19] huh
[1:44:21] i don't know forgive me for
[1:44:22] presumptuously preaching here but i
[1:44:24] don't know that god ever told moses you
[1:44:26] tell him to tell him the earth is going
[1:44:28] to open up i don't know whether he did
[1:44:29] or not the bible probably don't say
[1:44:31] whether he did but out of moses mouth
[1:44:33] come he says if the earth opens up its
[1:44:36] mouth
[1:44:36] huh just maybe he has fun prophesied and
[1:44:40] says god i'll honor that and god got him
[1:44:42] to come to earthquake huh and shook them
[1:44:45] all right down into the hole
[1:44:49] one-way ticket straight to hell
[1:44:53] and the prophet said the hell is in the
[1:44:54] middle of the earth
[1:44:56] i was asking my wife this morning i said
[1:44:58] what is in the middle of the earth what
[1:44:59] is in the center of the earth pure love
[1:45:02] probably pure lava just hot
[1:45:05] very hot amen
[1:45:07] but think about it so you look at that
[1:45:10] and you see how that it's important
[1:45:14] that this god
[1:45:16] that is the same yesterday today and
[1:45:18] forever
[1:45:19] that you're part of it amen
[1:45:22] now notice as we talk a little bit more
[1:45:24] about this
[1:45:26] the one thing
[1:45:29] about god
[1:45:31] is he's so great
[1:45:34] god is great
[1:45:37] and
[1:45:40] the bible says greatly
[1:45:42] to be praised
[1:45:44] amen
[1:45:46] oh my this i hope this morning it'll
[1:45:48] bring a worship
[1:45:50] of our souls
[1:45:51] to know that there's such a great being
[1:45:53] out there
[1:45:57] the very essence of god
[1:45:59] like i said earlier we talked about how
[1:46:02] he's created the earth the trees
[1:46:05] he created all the animal life all of
[1:46:07] that
[1:46:09] but let's just go back a little bit
[1:46:11] perhaps before he created
[1:46:13] the earth
[1:46:15] and
[1:46:16] then you go out
[1:46:19] in astronomy and that right you go into
[1:46:22] these great big scopes i've never looked
[1:46:24] into one hopefully into the hubble space
[1:46:26] scope or whatever they call it right i'd
[1:46:28] like to look at that sometime wouldn't
[1:46:30] you to go look and they said trillions
[1:46:33] and trillions of light space
[1:46:35] now prophet taught us that those stars
[1:46:37] that you see up there
[1:46:39] all of them close together right
[1:46:42] he says and don't they say
[1:46:45] just how they know brother tommy i don't
[1:46:47] know
[1:46:47] just like i asked my wife how do they
[1:46:49] know what's down there under the earth
[1:46:50] all the way down there i highly doubt
[1:46:52] they ever got down that deep but maybe
[1:46:54] they did i don't know
[1:46:56] but anyway you look at those stars and
[1:46:58] he says you know those are so
[1:47:00] far away
[1:47:02] but yet they say that those stars are
[1:47:05] further apart from each other
[1:47:08] than we are to them
[1:47:11] talk about blowing your mind
[1:47:14] and to think the galaxies the milky
[1:47:17] white way
[1:47:18] all of the star all of that that he
[1:47:21] created
[1:47:23] all of those things that simply come off
[1:47:26] of his hand
[1:47:28] that he spoke into existence
[1:47:35] and that'll give you a little of idea of
[1:47:38] i just can't comprehend this great god
[1:47:41] how great this being is
[1:47:47] that could could do all that it's too
[1:47:49] big for our little
[1:47:51] three inch by three inch
[1:47:53] gray matter
[1:47:55] up here to comprehend absorbed even take
[1:47:58] in
[1:48:00] like i said last week i said
[1:48:02] his omnipotence all-powerful right
[1:48:06] his power is beyond our comprehension
[1:48:09] his all-knowingness is beyond our
[1:48:12] comprehension
[1:48:14] his omnipresence is beyond
[1:48:16] human comprehension
[1:48:23] amen
[1:48:25] that's why i say that it was so
[1:48:27] important in this hour that god came and
[1:48:30] proves that he's alive
[1:48:32] that he's real
[1:48:34] because most of those out there it is
[1:48:36] just too much for them to be able to
[1:48:38] believe
[1:48:41] you know
[1:48:41] can we let me tell you something on a
[1:48:43] carnal standpoint of god on a carnal
[1:48:46] standpoint of looking at god
[1:48:49] he's too big to believe
[1:48:52] and he's too evident not to believe
[1:48:57] you get that in other words he's too
[1:48:59] much to comprehend
[1:49:02] but yet it's too evident that he is not
[1:49:04] to believe it
[1:49:07] amen so you choose which one you're
[1:49:08] going to do are you going to be an
[1:49:09] atheist or you're going to believe in
[1:49:10] god
[1:49:13] you gotta do one or the other
[1:49:14] and most of them out there
[1:49:17] are atheists
[1:49:19] most of them out there don't believe god
[1:49:24] they don't
[1:49:25] they might in their mind know that there
[1:49:27] is a god somewhere because something
[1:49:29] tells them there is but as far as
[1:49:31] accepting it and believing it the way
[1:49:32] that they're supposed to and getting
[1:49:34] saved
[1:49:36] isn't that right they don't
[1:49:41] let me just let me just say something
[1:49:43] else this morning
[1:49:46] something that i the lord kind of
[1:49:48] revealed to me last week
[1:49:51] talking about having rules for your
[1:49:54] body right trying to bring this body
[1:49:57] subject
[1:49:59] and how unruly
[1:50:03] oh sinful man that i am like paul said
[1:50:06] oh wretched man that i am right
[1:50:09] just how wretched and vile and horrible
[1:50:12] this human flesh
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:15] can be
[1:50:17] right
[1:50:18] and i thought about i says really all
[1:50:20] you got to do
[1:50:21] is look at
[1:50:23] early 1900s
[1:50:26] when women were allowed to wear pants
[1:50:29] right
[1:50:30] way back when they were not allowed to
[1:50:31] wear the garment they weren't allowed to
[1:50:33] wear scorched skirts they certainly
[1:50:35] weren't allowed doing no bathing suit
[1:50:37] out
[1:50:38] huh
[1:50:40] and when you look at how that's gone to
[1:50:42] debauchery to debauchery to debauchery
[1:50:44] to debauchery until now look at where
[1:50:47] it's at
[1:50:50] huh we have people in leadership i'm not
[1:50:54] sure if it's it's the head of a major
[1:50:56] thing i believe it's a four-star
[1:50:58] something in the military where it's a
[1:51:00] transgender now
[1:51:04] huh and look at the oh my and that's
[1:51:08] what think young people think about it
[1:51:10] you better have rules you better have
[1:51:12] the holy ghost
[1:51:14] you better have something to keep you
[1:51:16] right where you are to be because that's
[1:51:18] where it'll go
[1:51:19] homosexuality lesbian all the filth of
[1:51:22] the world
[1:51:24] that's how bad
[1:51:26] your flesh will go
[1:51:28] if you don't have god to control this
[1:51:29] thing
[1:51:31] that's why it's so important that you
[1:51:33] don't live by the desires of your flesh
[1:51:36] but you delivered by the power of the
[1:51:39] spirit
[1:51:40] ain't that right brother brad
[1:51:42] right let that holy ghost sons of god
[1:51:44] are led by the spirit of god amen and
[1:51:48] it'll lead you to holiness it'll bring
[1:51:50] you right
[1:51:52] make you dress right look right talk
[1:51:54] right act right love right
[1:51:56] be right
[1:51:58] the other way goes into what we see out
[1:52:00] there today horrible amen
[1:52:05] oh my
[1:52:07] let me say something else about god's
[1:52:09] this is just kind of
[1:52:11] when i get into
[1:52:12] and we won't get all the way today but
[1:52:14] we'll just go as far as we can
[1:52:18] what else what else about got the hang
[1:52:20] of stars the galaxies the solar system
[1:52:24] that we can't comprehend
[1:52:27] oh my
[1:52:29] you know i was thinking about this
[1:52:30] message and i thought about what i would
[1:52:32] say to somebody that says i don't
[1:52:33] believe there's a god
[1:52:38] there's just one question that i'd like
[1:52:40] to ask him
[1:52:43] and that is
[1:52:46] that every day
[1:52:48] and every day of the year
[1:52:51] the sun comes up
[1:52:52] at a certain time
[1:52:54] sets at a certain time
[1:52:57] do you really think
[1:52:59] that's just by chance
[1:53:07] only a stupid person would say yeah
[1:53:11] then it's time for me to go
[1:53:14] right
[1:53:16] well i say stupid okay but the bible
[1:53:19] says a fool
[1:53:22] says in their heart there is no god
[1:53:25] but in our language it's not very
[1:53:27] intelligent
[1:53:28] because there ain't no way
[1:53:30] every year not just one day just one day
[1:53:33] is enough brother toy
[1:53:34] just one day he came up at the same time
[1:53:37] or or when he was supposed to maybe a
[1:53:39] minute less right
[1:53:41] because that's why the cycle of it but
[1:53:43] they know already exactly the sunrise
[1:53:45] not only one day but one week one month
[1:53:48] year after year
[1:53:50] the solar system and the stars and
[1:53:52] hayley's comment that's going to come
[1:53:53] back in 78 years and he comes back hey
[1:53:56] guess what haley's gonna pop supposed to
[1:53:58] show it shows up
[1:54:02] you'd have to be a fool to believe
[1:54:04] that's by chance
[1:54:06] why
[1:54:08] because the bible says he created all
[1:54:10] things and by him all things consist
[1:54:13] in other words everything runs smooth
[1:54:16] because of him
[1:54:19] ain't no way ain't no way that it can be
[1:54:22] by chance
[1:54:23] ain't no way
[1:54:26] amen
[1:54:27] it can't just
[1:54:30] be
[1:54:31] by chance
[1:54:34] i think
[1:54:36] we as human beings
[1:54:38] we are
[1:54:40] always trying to be trying to see how
[1:54:43] great we can be
[1:54:48] this is where you say amen
[1:54:51] that's right we're always seeing we want
[1:54:54] the nicest car we want the nicest house
[1:54:56] we want the
[1:54:57] this that or the other huh
[1:54:59] how great you know we had a great big
[1:55:02] house uptown and i concluded i don't
[1:55:04] want a big house
[1:55:06] i want a smaller house i love my small
[1:55:09] house
[1:55:10] 900 square feet something which i knew
[1:55:12] i'd build an addition on so i'm getting
[1:55:14] a little bit more for my comfort
[1:55:16] in that right
[1:55:20] but you know it's just it just puts more
[1:55:22] on you
[1:55:27] but god
[1:55:28] is
[1:55:29] so great okay god is so great
[1:55:35] but the one thing he's a master at
[1:55:38] one thing that god is a master at
[1:55:42] that is hiding
[1:55:46] and i i don't know if i can just go to
[1:55:48] it i doubt that i can but
[1:55:51] i sure wish i could
[1:55:54] yeah here it is i was reading it
[1:55:55] yesterday it says verily
[1:55:58] thou art a god
[1:56:01] that hideth thyself
[1:56:06] he's good he is good at hiding himself
[1:56:11] i mean folks let's admit it when you
[1:56:14] look at his creation and when you look
[1:56:15] at what we just said
[1:56:17] that's not hiding
[1:56:19] it's pretty obvious right
[1:56:22] there's got to be a god somewhere
[1:56:28] he has got it's got to be
[1:56:31] i remember when i was a sinner
[1:56:34] just out there in the world
[1:56:36] and something in my heart said
[1:56:38] there's got to be a god
[1:56:41] have been amish i'd been mennonite i
[1:56:43] done
[1:56:45] done went out into the world and into
[1:56:47] sin
[1:56:48] but you know there is got to be a right
[1:56:50] way there's got to be god somewhere
[1:56:52] there's got to be a great way
[1:56:54] amen
[1:56:57] aren't you glad for that something that
[1:56:59] in there
[1:57:01] because i'll tell you what i've had
[1:57:02] buddies you know that passed away drunks
[1:57:06] never did quit drinking
[1:57:08] never did find their way always thought
[1:57:11] that it was just country music and
[1:57:13] rock and roll and whatever you know and
[1:57:15] keep going that time aren't you glad
[1:57:17] you're not in that world anymore i know
[1:57:19] brother
[1:57:20] tommy is
[1:57:23] oh my
[1:57:25] you know
[1:57:26] a lot of them perish in that
[1:57:29] that's so sad
[1:57:31] that they never really realized that
[1:57:33] there is so much more to life than that
[1:57:37] that's not what
[1:57:39] what it's all about
[1:57:42] amen
[1:57:43] that there's a god and
[1:57:45] and you could tell by the universe
[1:57:47] romans the first chapter he says being
[1:57:50] evident by the things that are made
[1:57:52] people can see that there's a god by the
[1:57:54] things that are made but yet
[1:57:57] they don't never really find him
[1:58:01] now
[1:58:02] in this church
[1:58:04] i'm sure that when i ask this question
[1:58:07] somebody's going to be able to answer me
[1:58:09] where does she hide
[1:58:14] speak up
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:18] i heard somebody say simplicity
[1:58:22] that's one
[1:58:23] uh
[1:58:24] two main things that he hides himself
[1:58:26] one is simplicity and the other is
[1:58:32] humility
[1:58:34] humility and simplicity
[1:58:37] that's where he hides himself
[1:58:43] wouldn't it be nice that whenever god
[1:58:45] talks to you and whenever you have a
[1:58:46] question he just audibly speak to you
[1:58:48] like he did moses
[1:58:51] just like you're hearing my voice when i
[1:58:53] say audibly hear you
[1:58:55] that means that you literally hear a
[1:58:56] voice like this right there in your ear
[1:59:00] because remember uh you know because god
[1:59:02] spoke to miriam and aaron and so forth
[1:59:04] and he says you know i'll speak to them
[1:59:06] in a dream or a vision
[1:59:09] he speaks that way but he says moses
[1:59:11] he's special
[1:59:13] i talked to him lip to ear
[1:59:18] amen just like he did our prophet lift
[1:59:21] the ear
[1:59:22] that'd be nice that'd be nice if you
[1:59:24] could hear that but how many knows
[1:59:30] that none of us probably maybe maybe
[1:59:32] somebody here has heard him audibly a
[1:59:35] voice
[1:59:36] because most of the time it's a voice in
[1:59:38] our mind
[1:59:41] most of the time it's a voice in our
[1:59:43] heart that's what we hear
[1:59:47] why because it wouldn't take much faith
[1:59:50] for the audible would it
[1:59:52] and god wants us to operate by faith
[1:59:56] he hides himself in such a way that he
[1:59:58] did it come to god got the first belief
[2:00:01] that he is
[2:00:04] you know and that he's a rewarder of
[2:00:06] those that
[2:00:08] diligently
[2:00:11] he hides
[2:00:12] you seek
[2:00:15] how many believes that he hides you see
[2:00:18] if you want god you better go to seeking
[2:00:21] [Music]
[2:00:23] now i know we've heard that there's no
[2:00:25] man that seeks god and i realize i
[2:00:27] understand that but i can show you many
[2:00:28] many scriptures where the bible says
[2:00:30] seek him seek him seek him seek him seek
[2:00:32] him seek him seek him
[2:00:35] amen
[2:00:37] and the answer for it you want the
[2:00:39] answer for that
[2:00:40] then how does that match up how can you
[2:00:42] make that fit together
[2:00:45] you would not seek him unless he put
[2:00:47] that desire in there
[2:00:49] amen he wouldn't seek him unless he had
[2:00:52] to doubt god put that desire to in there
[2:00:54] and that's why i thought well when i
[2:00:57] sought the lord and i found god hey i
[2:00:59] was seeking the lord come to find out no
[2:01:01] that was him seeking me that was him
[2:01:04] down here drawing me no man can come
[2:01:07] unto me except my father draw
[2:01:09] him
[2:01:10] [Music]
[2:01:11] aren't you glad for that
[2:01:14] well aren't you glad to be in church
[2:01:17] amen you had a desire to be in church
[2:01:20] you know how many people don't have no
[2:01:21] desire to be in church
[2:01:26] oh my
[2:01:29] when we look at god
[2:01:31] who he is
[2:01:32] what he's done
[2:01:37] then what should we do
[2:01:39] make up our mind
[2:01:41] who we're going to serve
[2:01:44] how many believes that's the biggest
[2:01:45] thing is you got to make up your mind
[2:01:47] who you're going to
[2:01:48] serve how many knows that
[2:01:52] many many people there in the bible and
[2:01:54] joshua even talking about putting to put
[2:01:56] away those idols as your father's
[2:01:57] worship and so forth
[2:02:00] and brother baby says you know you might
[2:02:02] not think that americans are idle
[2:02:04] worshipers he says they're the big bunch
[2:02:06] of zion worship you ever saw
[2:02:11] but i the worshipers your wife can be
[2:02:13] your idol your job can be your idol your
[2:02:15] money can be your idol
[2:02:18] all kinds of idols that you can have
[2:02:22] that you put before god anything you put
[2:02:24] before god i've got the quote anything
[2:02:26] you put before god is a idol
[2:02:32] lord help us
[2:02:34] make up your mind are you going to serve
[2:02:36] this living god that is in your heart in
[2:02:38] the form of the holy ghost
[2:02:40] let me come back a little bit i'm going
[2:02:41] off my subject
[2:02:43] humility
[2:02:44] simplicity you hear
[2:02:47] he made it to where you'd have to listen
[2:02:49] real hard
[2:02:50] you might even have to pray
[2:02:53] remember brother bannon would go back in
[2:02:54] his cave for days
[2:02:57] to get a message from the lord to find
[2:02:58] out what god wanted him to do he'd go
[2:03:00] for days
[2:03:05] let me just tell you i think that's a
[2:03:06] good example if you're not getting an
[2:03:09] answer
[2:03:10] tell your wife and kids and tell whoever
[2:03:12] you have to make arrangements
[2:03:15] i'll be back when i can
[2:03:18] i'm going to go get an answer from the
[2:03:19] lord
[2:03:20] maybe you need to take a little more
[2:03:22] time to listen instead of doing all the
[2:03:24] talking and listen to what god has to
[2:03:27] tell you
[2:03:28] because i made this statement over the
[2:03:30] last couple of months real loud because
[2:03:31] that is that god wants to and does talk
[2:03:34] to us
[2:03:36] but a lot of times we aren't listening
[2:03:40] we have got too much rattling going on
[2:03:42] too many buzzing of cars and and
[2:03:45] business and cares of life and problems
[2:03:48] and stuff is going on rather than
[2:03:50] hearing what he's got to say
[2:03:56] me tell you that's something i've
[2:03:57] learned as a preacher in that you know
[2:03:59] and that is that when i'm working i feel
[2:04:01] lately i'm working a lot and everything
[2:04:03] i feel like i've got a hammer in one
[2:04:05] hand and a sword in the other
[2:04:07] that's right while i'm hammering while
[2:04:09] i'm building while i'm doing i'm also
[2:04:11] listening lord what do you have to say
[2:04:13] to me
[2:04:14] amen and when that's bill saw a voice
[2:04:16] comes and speaks something like what
[2:04:18] we're preaching about this morning
[2:04:20] just as simplicity
[2:04:22] if god be god
[2:04:24] if he really is god
[2:04:28] if he really is god then he is worthy of
[2:04:32] us giving our best to him
[2:04:37] to give our first to him to give our all
[2:04:40] to him
[2:04:44] that no matter where we're working or
[2:04:46] whatever he's always on our mind he's
[2:04:48] always in our hearts when we get up in
[2:04:50] the morning we talk to him maybe midday
[2:04:53] take time to say lord thank you for
[2:04:55] helping me through half of this day
[2:04:58] folks when i get up and i pray and i'm
[2:05:00] just so happy in the lord a lot of times
[2:05:02] and man i say lord help me to get this
[2:05:05] wall up help me to get this on help me
[2:05:07] to get that done and it just goes so
[2:05:09] much better i pick up a board because i
[2:05:12] need a certain size over here i pick up
[2:05:14] that board and i take a tape to it and
[2:05:16] it's exactly right that's it take you
[2:05:18] lord i don't even have to cut it
[2:05:22] that's how it goes
[2:05:26] oh yeah how many believe that we need to
[2:05:28] give him our own
[2:05:32] this is another scripture that came out
[2:05:34] came to me when i thought about if god
[2:05:36] is god
[2:05:37] if he really is god and he is
[2:05:40] there is such a great divine thing
[2:05:43] as almighty god who did all of that and
[2:05:46] if there is
[2:05:48] if god be god
[2:05:51] then he deserves
[2:05:54] more from us
[2:05:57] in every aspect of our life
[2:05:59] but this is the scripture that came to
[2:06:01] me in colossians 3 23 says it this way
[2:06:04] i'll just read it quick
[2:06:08] let me go back up a little bit can i so
[2:06:10] that we can encumber what he was talking
[2:06:12] about
[2:06:13] and whatsoever you do in word or indeed
[2:06:16] do all in the name of the lord jesus
[2:06:20] amen
[2:06:23] i like that
[2:06:24] because remember
[2:06:25] elijah built that altar in the name of
[2:06:28] the lord
[2:06:29] right
[2:06:30] he built it in the name of the lord
[2:06:32] whatever you do
[2:06:33] do it in the name of the lord if you
[2:06:34] can't do it in the name of the lord
[2:06:36] don't do it
[2:06:39] then
[2:06:40] in the name of the lord jesus giving
[2:06:42] thanks to god the father and the father
[2:06:44] by him
[2:06:46] i had something come in my mind as if
[2:06:48] it's okay let me back up just a little
[2:06:50] bit let me say this
[2:06:52] that there is many titles to god
[2:06:56] but there is only one
[2:06:58] name
[2:06:59] [Laughter]
[2:07:02] oh man i like that there's only one name
[2:07:04] this god with all the title has only one
[2:07:07] name the bible says it acts there there
[2:07:09] is only one name given under heaven
[2:07:12] whereby men must be saved
[2:07:16] how many believe that
[2:07:18] praise the lord now notice go back to
[2:07:20] our subject
[2:07:22] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[2:07:24] husbands
[2:07:25] as it is fit in the lord husbands love
[2:07:27] your wives and be not bitter against
[2:07:29] them children obey your parents if
[2:07:32] they're right or wrong or whatever no he
[2:07:34] says in all things
[2:07:37] for this is well pleasing unto the lord
[2:07:39] fathers provoke not to children unto
[2:07:41] anger at least they be discouraged
[2:07:42] servants obey in all things your master
[2:07:46] according to the flesh don't you just
[2:07:48] love to have a servant that argues with
[2:07:50] you all the time
[2:07:53] huh
[2:07:54] no you don't like to have a servant that
[2:07:56] argues with the whole time
[2:07:58] obey just obey just do what you're told
[2:08:01] all right
[2:08:03] not with eye service as men pleases but
[2:08:06] in singleness of heart fearing god and
[2:08:09] whatsoever ye do
[2:08:11] do it heartily
[2:08:14] do it heartily as to the lord and not
[2:08:18] unto man so if you're gonna serve god
[2:08:21] serving heartily
[2:08:26] amen
[2:08:28] brother brahm told billy palsy it's
[2:08:29] billy paul if you're gonna be a bomb be
[2:08:32] a good one don't work a day in your life
[2:08:40] another place he says anything that's
[2:08:42] worth doing is worth doing right
[2:08:45] do it good if you're gonna do anything
[2:08:48] if you're gonna serve god save him with
[2:08:50] all your heart all of your mind follow
[2:08:52] your soul holy respect if you're gonna
[2:08:54] worship god then begin to worship him in
[2:08:57] spirit any truth
[2:09:00] amen
[2:09:02] you love it do it heartily as unto the
[2:09:06] lord
[2:09:07] not just halfway
[2:09:08] [Applause]
[2:09:10] amen
[2:09:12] now i wrote down here listen whatever
[2:09:13] you're gonna do
[2:09:15] amen if you don't love the lord why
[2:09:18] don't never darken the day of the church
[2:09:20] stars in your life if you don't love the
[2:09:22] lord
[2:09:25] because the prophet told me he says if
[2:09:27] you're filled with the holy ghost
[2:09:30] you can't hardly wait and kill them
[2:09:32] doors open
[2:09:34] why because the holy ghost wants to get
[2:09:37] him them doors because he's hungry how
[2:09:39] many knows the holy ghost feeds on many
[2:09:41] things
[2:09:43] no the holy ghost feeds on only one
[2:09:46] thing and that is the word of god
[2:09:49] that's the only thing the holy ghost
[2:09:51] feeds on
[2:09:55] eat heartily let thy soul delight itself
[2:09:58] in fatness evening my tabernacle you
[2:10:02] need to be
[2:10:03] fat
[2:10:08] now let me add a little something to you
[2:10:09] you make you feel better spiritually
[2:10:16] that's right the bible says let thy soul
[2:10:19] delight itself in fatness come unto me
[2:10:22] you who are thirsty and hungry i'll give
[2:10:25] you water and i'll give you food let
[2:10:27] your soul delight itself and happiness i
[2:10:30] want you big fat and sassy
[2:10:36] well i feel good
[2:10:39] huh that's how god wants you to be i
[2:10:42] come to give you life and more abundant
[2:10:44] he came to give you more life than
[2:10:47] walmarters have and then person next to
[2:10:49] you walking down the street that just
[2:10:51] don't have any joy
[2:10:54] don't have any peace
[2:10:59] don't have any forgiveness don't have
[2:11:02] any holiness
[2:11:03] don't have anything to live for
[2:11:07] oh my
[2:11:09] whatever you do
[2:11:10] do it heartily
[2:11:12] as unto the lord
[2:11:16] if you're gonna do something do it right
[2:11:19] do with all your heart how many believes
[2:11:21] that this morning
[2:11:22] because that's what god expects from us
[2:11:25] they'll do it all with all of our heart
[2:11:28] amen
[2:11:30] get up in the morning and pray say god i
[2:11:33] commit this dead to you lord i can't go
[2:11:35] i can't go do business i want to go on
[2:11:38] this business venture but lord if it be
[2:11:41] your will
[2:11:42] whatever your will is lord you want him
[2:11:45] to lead you him to guide you
[2:11:47] everything you do everything you said
[2:11:49] got to be the will of the lord
[2:11:53] oh my
[2:11:55] god
[2:11:57] in the middle of the day
[2:11:58] thank him again like daniel did how many
[2:12:00] knows daniel he was a he was a fat man
[2:12:05] daniel was fat
[2:12:07] he had so much of god in him the lions
[2:12:10] couldn't touch him
[2:12:12] that's right
[2:12:13] them hebrew children they had so much of
[2:12:15] god until the fire wouldn't burn
[2:12:21] amen
[2:12:22] we as christians in this laodicea edge
[2:12:25] we've got so much of god lukewarmness
[2:12:28] can't touch us
[2:12:34] amen
[2:12:36] believes god is worthy
[2:12:38] of praise
[2:12:40] he's worthy of honor in our lives
[2:12:47] can i back up just a little bit i'd
[2:12:48] start it with wives submit yourselves
[2:12:51] unto your husband remember all of this
[2:12:53] paul said whatever you're gonna do do it
[2:12:55] hardly
[2:12:57] wives if you're gonna submit yourself
[2:12:59] really submit yourself to him
[2:13:02] huh
[2:13:06] praise the lord
[2:13:08] then the very next verse is husbands
[2:13:12] love your wives right
[2:13:15] love your wives and peanut bitter
[2:13:17] against them
[2:13:21] i don't know about you but my wife has
[2:13:23] made me mad
[2:13:26] she has made me mad
[2:13:30] hey we're just being honest if y'all
[2:13:32] were honest you probably say the same
[2:13:34] thing
[2:13:36] and if you haven't it'll probably happen
[2:13:39] so when it happens remember the advice
[2:13:42] of the old preacher up here
[2:13:44] remember the bible says don't you hold
[2:13:46] it against them
[2:13:48] you forgive them
[2:13:50] huh
[2:13:51] that's right when you thought you ought
[2:13:52] to have the last word she still had the
[2:13:54] last word you had to quit just shut up
[2:13:57] let it be
[2:14:00] we getting down to where we live now
[2:14:03] huh
[2:14:04] sure
[2:14:05] i've done it
[2:14:07] be the man
[2:14:08] just shut up
[2:14:11] argument's over with
[2:14:14] then be another man be a man even a
[2:14:17] little more do it hardly
[2:14:19] all right i ain't gonna hold it against
[2:14:20] her
[2:14:21] wipe that big old frown
[2:14:24] off your face
[2:14:28] and smile and say i ain't gonna hold i
[2:14:29] ain't gonna be bitter against you
[2:14:32] huh
[2:14:34] that's right
[2:14:35] now the bible didn't say that about the
[2:14:38] wife to the husband but don't we all
[2:14:40] think it applies
[2:14:42] oh yeah
[2:14:44] vice versa
[2:14:47] amen
[2:14:49] brother father go ahead and preach it
[2:14:52] that's the truth
[2:14:56] he made me so bad one time
[2:14:59] it took me a week to get over it
[2:15:01] [Music]
[2:15:04] that's the truth amen and all the people
[2:15:06] said
[2:15:07] amen
[2:15:08] that's the truth
[2:15:10] that's right children obey your parents
[2:15:16] children obey your parents
[2:15:19] do what your mom and daddy says
[2:15:22] or it'll be flip flop time
[2:15:25] it'll be ruler sick time
[2:15:28] it'll be spanking time
[2:15:31] give him a good
[2:15:32] whip and dad and tell him now thank me
[2:15:35] son
[2:15:39] huh
[2:15:40] i'm
[2:15:41] saving you another one
[2:15:44] he'll thank you he will trust me
[2:15:48] all right obey your parents in all
[2:15:52] things
[2:15:53] for this is well pleasing unto the lord
[2:15:55] and fathers provoke not your children
[2:15:58] unto anger at least they be discouraged
[2:16:00] servants obey in all things your
[2:16:04] masters according to the flesh
[2:16:07] how many believes that lord listen he
[2:16:09] keep keeps talking about in all things
[2:16:12] because we people we have a tendency to

[2:16:19] listening to him about that

[2:16:40] loving your wife or your husband the way
[2:16:44] you treat them huh
[2:16:47] it's the way you're treating the lord

[2:16:57] master
[2:16:59] or lord and

[2:17:02] don't do the things i tell you
[2:17:05] how many knows you can't claim him as

[2:17:17] do it heartily
[2:17:19] as unto the lord

[2:17:24] biggest thing is you have to decide
[2:17:27] that this is the god that i'm going to
[2:17:29] serve
[2:17:31] not the god of yesterday
[2:17:34] but the god of today

[2:18:07] last three
[2:18:08] chapters
[2:18:11] of psalms
[2:18:14] when we think about how awesome
[2:18:17] and greedy god is
[2:18:20] and you've accepted his blood you've
[2:18:22] accepted the forgiveness of your sins
[2:18:25] you've received him in your heart you
[2:18:27] have the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:18:29] you've got a checkbook in your hand
[2:18:32] everything that you have need of if you
[2:18:33] need anything just write the check are
[2:18:36] you with me this morning
[2:18:37] that's the kind of god that we serve
[2:18:41] that whatever you have need of he
[2:18:42] supplied all these things in christ
[2:18:44] jesus for us
[2:18:46] we're going down through life we have
[2:18:47] the peace of god in our hearts
[2:18:50] so what is it left to do
[2:18:54] hey man i was talking to david beachy
[2:18:56] brother woody dad
[2:18:58] talking to him on the phone he was
[2:18:59] talking about an old deacon in his
[2:19:00] church that passed away but he always
[2:19:03] was always going on about how thankful
[2:19:07] that we ought to be
[2:19:08] for our health
[2:19:11] i don't know about you but when you're
[2:19:12] younger you eat all the chicken you can
[2:19:14] and you're not just you don't you take
[2:19:15] your health for granted a little bit
[2:19:17] right when you get older you begin to
[2:19:19] say thank you lord
[2:19:20] i've had five of my friends pass away
[2:19:22] and died this way that way i'm still
[2:19:24] going thank you jesus thank you for my
[2:19:26] health lord
[2:19:29] amen thank you that we're not in a you
[2:19:31] know a
[2:19:32] on a bed somewhere and can't get up
[2:19:34] thank you lord for our health
[2:19:36] appreciation that's what we give back to
[2:19:39] god
[2:19:40] appreciation
[2:19:41] how many believes
[2:19:43] even where he says if i'm a father
[2:19:45] where's my honor if i'm a god you know
[2:19:47] where's my worship
[2:19:49] amen he's giving us everything
[2:19:52] 148 chapter 148 of psalms talking about
[2:19:55] giving god back
[2:19:57] and i think that's one of the most
[2:19:59] terrible things that we as human beings
[2:20:00] do is when god gives so much we don't
[2:20:04] give back
[2:20:07] one of the things that broke his heart
[2:20:09] when he come was he came to his own and
[2:20:11] his own didn't even receive him
[2:20:16] we are so bad that
[2:20:18] he created all of us and we absolutely
[2:20:22] deny
[2:20:23] him having created us
[2:20:25] now i'm not us but i'm talking about the
[2:20:27] world out there
[2:20:28] we as human beings they want to deny
[2:20:31] that god created them
[2:20:35] do you see why god wants to consume in a
[2:20:37] moment
[2:20:39] and he will
[2:20:42] praise ye the lord 148 praise he the
[2:20:45] lord from the heavens praise him in the
[2:20:47] heights praise him all his angels praise

[2:21:20] ever and he had made a decree which
[2:21:22] shall not pass
