christ he's always alone [Music] he will never refuse to captain our battles while this caravan keeps on rolling along over mountains and through the valleys before [Music] bubbling springs keeps on rolling along this great caravan keeps on rolling [Music] along you know the caravan is life what if the lord allowed each one of us when you're young hand you a book and then that book contained every step of your life how many of us would be here today my even if you could read the back of the book you wouldn't want to go through the middle part or i know i wouldn't want to redo mine you know if you i'm thankful it's a day by day step we can read we know the back of the book just we don't know what's going on between the beginning and getting to the back that's his grace and mercy amen good to have josh and him back i tell you we those drums sat there for months years they get played during youth services but i missed it when you're gone buddy you were missed says leo we missed you too but he just it's part of the package so definitely mister and him play the drums amen i just want to let everybody know during service if you go back to the bathroom water pressure is going to be low because we're filling up the baptistry uh we've got somebody who wants to be baptized today and so uh i know they're very very happy so we just thank the lord for each one and so if you go back there i would i would just say if you need to go to the bathroom everything's going to go before preaching starts because i'm going to turn the water back on and be filling the bastard up and and it makes the pressure drop down very low back there so um just give you a warning so you won't be going over there telling brother way and the camo ain't flushing uh you know being washed my hands can't get a drink my whole ass that's only what happens so let's stand if we could looking forward to what the lord's got for us today and uh it's the first sunday this month so everybody's playing music stay up here i guess we'll be singing birthdays and anniversaries so those of you that have birthdays and anniversaries don't go outside or go to the back while when it's time come up here like you're supposed to so let's just sing amazing grace as brother tom gets ready to come out [Music] like me [Music] i it was graceful [Music] my fears we are [Music] amen [Music] is [Music] [Applause] grace praise god [Music] [Applause] [Music] god please [Applause] praise god oh i thank you [Music] me [Music] amen hallelujah good morning good to be in house of the lord amen i think i turned it on brother mike i'll go the other way with it and on i flipped it for just a second we're back on amen all right i usually do that praise the lord god's good you can be seated all those that have a birthday in this month if you want to come out we'll sing happy birthday for you in june another flip of the dial one more month gone one day closer to eternity amen amen all right just two all right a happy birthday [Music] birthday [Music] [Music] [Applause] happy birthday y'all amen praise the lord how about anniversaries did anybody get married in the month of june all right [Laughter] well she's following you so i guess that's what happened right i have oh wait a minute here we go i'm getting a little fast here sorry brother joe mr hannah huh 25 years huh [Laughter] oh yeah it's been a long time so we then forgot all about that praise the lord a happy anniversary happy anniversary [Music] [Applause] happy anniversary amen praise the lord amen water sure does flow under the bridge really fast amen thank you musicians appreciate it amen appreciate your work for the lord amen may god richly bless all of you amen so i have a message that i have been thinking about for a little while came in and uh i've been wanting wanting to speak on this in this direction for a while but i never just really got it so i think yesterday is when i just kind of begin to think about it and see just try to listen that still small voice so i just feel like you know the lord impressed upon me perhaps to speak on this at this time amen so i trust it'll be a blessing to you this morning it is about a everyday christian life amen just to everyday christian life amen and so that's kind of direction that i want to go with the help of the lord amen and so elena may she's gonna gonna be baptized today so we're very happy for that amen nine years old anywhere from six to nine somewhere in there will baptize them if they express a real desire for wanting to be baptized they meant jesus said bring the little children unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of heaven isn't that right so anyways we're very thankful for her for that and may god bless her and her life amen good to see everybody out this morning god bless you it's good to see everybody amen in the house of the lord amen i can't think of any other announcements thank you for your prayers with the water i mean we finally located uh located the area of the leak amen and isolated it put a shutoff on it so that we could have service here without a problem amen and so from the looks of it it wasn't up in the congregation this church part but we traced it right up to the edge of the pavement going into tarza fellowship hall so it's looking like it's somewhere under the pavement uh between the pavement and the fellowship hole there and so we'll probably have to either dig a trench under uh the fellowship hall which i think you know we already got a price for that be running around probably 12 to 1500 to dig a trench under or we can tap onto the line on the other side of the driveway and go down around amen just through the field and back up and circle up that way so we'll decide which way one will go with that amen but it looks like with the help of the lord we'll be able to get it fixed amen we appreciate everybody's prayers it certainly was a little bit frustrating there amen when i just couldn't seem to find a water line anywhere i had good water coming out of the ground but no water line cell and i would call the county i said hey y'all got anybody can find a water leak sure no problem but we just don't do private people you know because you got to have a schematics or whatever we've got to know where your water lines are amen and so anyways that's what they told me i said well here we go let's dig another hole so we dug a couple more holes amen and we finally found it with the grape by the grace of the lord and it did some strange things i don't know if tommy's here this morning or not but it did some different stuff amen but anyway by god's grace we got to shut off on it so we're thankful for that amen amen stand with me if you will this morning we'll go to the word of god genesis if you will genesis and i want to take my time this morning if that's okay if everybody's got a good comfortable seat i don't want to rush it i just want to uh um [Music] take my time with the help of the lord and you know i really think that a good long service wouldn't hurt us none of you amen but uh on the other hand i know what it's like to sit there and after you've heard different preachers say something to the extent that the mind can only comprehend what the seat can bear or something like that because when you get really tired of sitting and fidgety you know you might really like it but it's you're uncomfortable and us human beings we like to be comfortable don't we amen but anyway so praise the lord amen be thankful how much that for the seats that we do have these seats was given to us by another church amen and so that was a wonderful blessing amen that was just one of the great things that god did for us when we were trying to finish this building amen and and so he always supplied we're thankful for that all right let's turn to genesis 5 and verse 24. genesis 5 and verse 24. enoch and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him amen may god has blessings to reading of the word you can be seated this morning and i want to title this this morning enoch's walk amen enoch's walk i like that i believe over in hebrews the 11th chapter and verse 5 he paul put it this way by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god amen that he pleased god
