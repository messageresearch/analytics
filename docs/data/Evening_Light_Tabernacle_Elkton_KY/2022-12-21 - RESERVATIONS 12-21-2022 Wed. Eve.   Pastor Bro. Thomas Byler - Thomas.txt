are standing in his presence [Music] amen hallelujah amen if we couldn't just sing that for about half an hour it would be nice wouldn't it amen it's soothing amen God bless you amen good to be in the house of the Lord you can be seated for a minute if you will amen so I guess we got some cold weather coming in huh amen if the weatherman is right we're gonna see some Sub-Zero temperatures perhaps so y'all cover them spigots up amen amen gotta be be prepared amen amen be prepared for what's coming and so that's really what I was speaking on tonight is preparation amen um so anyway I just want to announce that our sister Johnny is in her new body tonight amen so uh we're just so glad to see her go in the Lord and be ready amen and so we do miss her already amen and so it's certainly you know kind of you know it can really definitely you miss her amen but uh the funeral will be next Wednesday not uh this is Wednesday so yeah next Wednesday at Stokes Chapel Church it'll be a graveside uh just a graveside service and our sister Mandy has asked me to speak a few scriptures maybe make a few comments there so um and then also I asked what we could do if we could do maybe the food or something and maybe have potluck and then my wife she says well let's not do that let's just have a uh Caterers on what's up that was a good idea because we don't want to put any kind of any load on them and then with it being midweek and everything we'll just have it catered and so we was going to do it for 100 people but Mandy said 60 or 70 will probably be plenty so we're going to have it catered from Roy's barbecue and so uh that's going to be taken care of for the Browns at the church no problem doing that and so we're glad for that amen and then the only thing I can think of would be probably uh now next next Wednesday since that's uh we're going to be over there doing that on Wednesday I don't want to not have service all week so let's have a Tuesday night service here would that be all right we'll do a Tuesday night service here and anybody that wants to bring some desserts you can bring desserts if you can't make it to the funeral or whatever if you want to just leave the desserts down at fellowship hall or something you want to bring some do that amen but if you're coming you want to bring a desserts that's the only thing that they don't Supply and I'd like to have some of it imminent for everybody so remember desserts um I don't know about drinks I think they're going to have tea there and everything but we may take some some bottled Cokes or something two liters or whatever but um but that's next Tuesday okay huh thank you yeah at one o'clock it's going to be one o'clock in the afternoon uh it's when when did when we're gonna start up there all right so it's supposed to be about 12 degrees so bring it over coats amen but anyway uh sister Johnny she really wanted to she almost made it back into the church here you know she was getting around pretty good and then of course things went South again you know the other way and uh she was just getting weaker and weaker it was just for her time to go and so amen we got to pray with her about 10 o'clock somewhere in there the morning uh before she went that evening amen and so just pray with her and so forth and got to visit her at the hospital Russellville amen and just talked to her there while she was still very responsive prayed with her there amen and talked to her and it just seemed like she her soul was ready and she was but maybe for her new body amen so amen we know it's real amen and so we're very grateful to have the hope that we have amen in Christ Jesus amen amen so if you will stand with me we'll just get into the word of the Lord amen now this thought came to me amen I don't know you know uh but about prep being prepared you know and I got to thinking about how nice it is to be prepared no matter what you're doing isn't that right preparation making preparation and um so I want to go if I can can we take our time tonight let's turn our Bibles I think we'll go to let me see here there be in Matthew 24. foreign verse 36. but if that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be and as in the days they were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the meal the one shall be taken and the other one left which therefore for you know not one hour the Lord does come but know this that if the good men of the house would have known and what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore for be also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh amen who then is a wise foreign a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give them moot meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing amen may God bless you you can be seated amen I'll read that one more scripture verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods amen laughs and I was just thinking one of the first things is uh that Jesus the very very thing that Jesus says about the Rapture and really tonight this is some help us should help us with the help of the Lord about being ready for the Rapture amen how many wants to be ready for the rapture amen and so we want to take a look of how we can be ready amen be ye therefore ready and that will not maybe look at it in a little perhaps a different way that uh uh another different way that I've preached it before perhaps should I say because I've preached it before but perhaps not just in this way but we want to talk about that Readiness and then and I just got it in my mind while I was back there studying because I was just going to read verse 44 be also ready and so that Jesus is saying that that Readiness is to be prepared now on the internet reservations amen how many knows when you make reservations it is are making preparations amen you're making preparations somewhere to spend the night or whatever it might be so reservations amen you have to have preparations amen and also this is a process so this getting ready is a process amen for this great event that lies ahead and Jesus here as I said I was just going to read that verse but then I got to thinking about what he was talking about in just a little bit before that when he says know this that if the Goodman of the house would have known in which watch the thief would come he would not have he would have watched and would not have suffered his house would be broken up and I said there's also an example of what Jesus used an example of a thief coming into your house isn't that right amen so if you knew that a thief was coming to your house and he was going to break in amen perhaps he was going to have a knife perhaps he was going to have a gun and you knew he was coming what would you do you can only imagine you you know you'd probably have everybody available right helping you up ah because you can we say that that Thief would really be in for a surprise now I don't know about you but I don't treasure the thought of getting stuck through the heart with a knife in the middle of the night into my bed right that's unprepared that's not ready when you're not ready for anything it's terrible but when you're ready for anything it's a glorious thing it's awesome thing to think that when you're ready just like every week how many knows that your bills come due every month your bills come due weekly your bills come doing amen you put that money back and you save up money so that whenever you have to write that check out or pay that bill it feels good to be able to pay that bill because I don't know if anybody always ever experienced but there may be a time in your life where you didn't have the money to pay the bill and then it's a terrible thing to think oh I can't pay this you're going to sweat and frighten and worry and oh my it's going to give you great hair it's got it is a lot of stress come on people and marriages and everything when they don't have what they need of have need of and when they're not prepared for something and Jesus is saying here he says you have to be I want you to prepared but first I want to talk a little while with the help of the Lord on on how that God prepares things God makes preparations I know that he makes preparations and he also asks us to make preparations so this is kind of a two-part tonight god making preparations and then you making preparation because I believe over in Revelation 19 says that bride has made herself right ready and the tonight we want to look at what you make yourself ready with a little bit would that be all right because you got to have be ready but not just stay ready but how do you get ready what are you ready how do you mean it's going to look at that with the help of the Lord amen now the message that I got that got that I'm using for this is a message brother Brian I preached in 1965 amen it was the first message from his last foreign message from his lab and he preached on things that are to be amen and he refers to and takes a scripture out of Saint John 14 he says let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you amen now notice Jesus talking about going away isn't it something how that Jesus was talking about going away I go to prepare a place for you Jesus knew that he was leaving isn't it something how that the prophet just messages or he goes off the scene preaches a message takes that same thought I don't know brother man I'm doing a lot of things and and even but a man says he says you know the Lord never showed me into that of any of my my kin folks are different ones he's always showed me it before it happens whether he showed brother bam he was going off the scene or not I don't know but I do know that it's quite a coincidence or whatever you might want to call it that he would say this four messages before he is taken off the scene amen and I didn't know just and it was actually uh 19 days before he died now we know he was in the hospital probably about seven days or so I think before he actually died a little while because of the accident all of these things talked about was the reality to him and so we're going to take some of these things they talked about Amen to try to make a point with the help of the Lord amen and it was on a Christmas Eve the brother random died I had to look it up on Siri Siri actually knew when brother William Brandon Brown called the end time messenger amen that's pretty good I like that they even acknowledged he was the end time messenger because that's what he was amen and so 50 this coming Saturday this coming Saturday night it'll be 57 years that he's been gone 57 years amen but 19 days he uses this I go to prepare a place for you for if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and we'll receive you unto myself that where I am come on folks he may be also folks I don't know about you but I'm looking forward to being wherever he is that's where I'm going to be amen that's where I want to be that's where you want to be that way I am there ye may be also now this is a little off the point but we'll pull it in here while we're talking about it and whether I go you know and the way you know isn't that something why would he put that in there and of course Thomas said to him Lord we know not whether or not go us and how can we know the way wow he just told him you know the way and you know you know you know where I'm going and you know the way Jesus saith unto him now notice I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me so notice he said you know the way Thomas says how do I know that basically but let me put it in my language you know me don't you do you know me see if you know me you know the way huh that's right not me I'm talking about Jesus said you know he said you know you know me Thomas then you know the way because I am the way I have the truth and I am the life amen so praise be to God how many has got to know away now oh there's I'm sorry there's not 900 different ways to Heaven one way to heaven that's through him that's how you get there that's how you get to this new home this mansion that he's building and better ban him all through this references this to our new body all right and I thought well how does that how does that really come together in First Corinthians let me see here First Corinthians 15 let me see if I got it wrote down here Charles again second Corinthians I believe it is five second Corinthians 5 Paul says it this way for we know that if our Earthly house hello if this body is called a house Jesus I won't go prepare you Mansions over there in my father's house and many mansions but about him of course is the only one that I believe is authorized to to uh correct something he says because you can't have mansions in that little house but in my father's kingdom are many policies she said it's the original interpretation and my father's kingdoms are many mansions or many palaces praise be to God now I notice Paul says if this house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we had a building of God a house made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown earnestly to be designed to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven praise God amen now notice another place he says that he says we're going to have Bible says that we're going to have a body what like unto his own glorious body how many believe that we're gonna have a body like this his and so forth amen but here he types it and says that this house this mansion He has with the place he's went to prepare so God is a person that prepares things he gets ready for things he isn't isn't uh uh playing it by ear huh or just uh winging it he's not just winging it he knows amen now notice let's start shall we and brother bam says you know if you was you could take this for a funeral tax but no I don't take I don't think these things are more a funeral text than Christmas is just a seasonal text I believe it's all year round don't you amen and so the same way with here he talks about you know he's going to prepare a place for us that when you know that he can come and receive us unto himself now he was what was he telling them he was telling them that after death there is lights amen how many glad that this is not all of it no no no no no no no no he goes and he makes sure that when this is over we have a place over Yonder amen he's going to make sure that he's taken care of what a consolation he says that ought to give to all of us that after this life is over there is a life that we go into and as we get older he says that becomes more of a reality to you all of you older folks yeah me too amen amen as you get older older yeah listen to what the prophet says as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close you begin to pack up a little closer getting ready for that great event amen praise the Lord now notice that great event it's not it's it's just a continuing of this same life in another world in another place foreign what else did the prophet teaches he says you know death doesn't change your character when you come to that door of death whatever you are amen that's what you are on the other side he does righteous he's righteous he that's holy that's holy he that filthy he's filthy when you cross over amen there's no more Purgatory this is Purgatory this is where the cleansing Comes This is where the purging of your sins comes amen this is where we get ready amen praise be to God so not notice he does in your birth here was what preparing amen and every plan by God before the foundation of the world and that you're here amen how many believe that now and if we know the word we know where we're living huh I mean those it's important that and this just comes I mean I was even even uh uh even the Pharisees they couldn't discern they could discern the signs of the time but they couldn't discern who Jesus was couldn't decide who he was they didn't know the day and the hour that they were living in you and I know the hour we're living in what is the hour we're at the end time we're in the layout of ch at amen we know where we are living at and we know the hour that we're living in and we know what lays ahead amen and we see what we've passed isn't that right that's what the word of God shows us amen that what we've passed and so forth see you were all pre-planned by God come on people that ought to make you just a little bit happy he knew exactly how many he'd sit here tonight he who'd come who wouldn't come he know where you'd sit he knew to coach you'd wear and here is kind of a new revelation to me something I like real good at yeah I hope that I can find it for knowledge that tells him all these things how does he know it how does he know how many how many times they feed with bonnet's eye and how much tally it would make huh here's my little finite mind you want to hear a little bit of this gray matter up in here and you know if God wouldn't if God if he can't just right now figure out every time everything everything everybody's doing well guess what he could he could take an eternity to watch the process to watch every Fleet every night and to know exactly how much everyone would make here time to figure all that out you know brother I don't know about that better man says it's his foreknowledge that lets him know these things it's his foreknowledge before it ever happened right before it ever happened he had it all figured out all right now this brings to light and brings to Glory that screen scripture in Romans 8 where it says and for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to those who are called according to his purpose his plan amen all right we know the hour we know nothing happens by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight even your natural birth God knew all about it he pre-planned you being here they're great great grandparents then you're great great grandparents then your grandparents huh think of all the marriages and think of the according think of the romance between all of those huh that God had to bring this one with this one and that one was that one this one was big one because he was gonna bring you up he was in the jeans of your great great great great great great grandfather you got to know exactly how it's going to come out I believe what client Place brother bam says that so there's nothing out of cater God hasn't lost control in other words everything's gone the way that he knew it would and his plan is going according to plan because his plan is his word and his word will not come back lord it will accomplish what he said [Music] and you are part of that plan hold your seat you are part of that plan [Laughter] huh you're a part of that plan you're part of that plan you can't be unplanned you can't be de-planned I'm gonna come up with all kinds of crazy words but I like it oh boy aren't you glad for that you talk about family planning huh let me tell you don't believe in this planned parenthood you know what this plan Parenthood is it's where they don't want to have a baby so they have an abortion that's their plan PornHub planned whatever bunch of devilishness a bunch of murderers murder see oh my I mean they're a bunch of minors oh don't get me started bunch of hemorrhoids yeah you pro-choice you're a bunch of Hitler's Children huh he cut him up and even then we'll let him die after the morning if they're breathing I've watched it myself somebody used to go to church you had a little baby and they wanted to board it it was aborted and it was still breathing it was breathing I'm like what what what's going on now talk to parents into says well I don't know about you but he was my kid I'd tell them for them on a respirator try to keep the thing alive cause he's moving around it's a living soul but they were just gonna let it there until it dies of course they took it back there and and tried to keep it alive but I don't trust them not at one bit anyway let's go down to another Rabbit Trail shall we amen pre-planned that's right amen aren't you glad to be prepared planned amen I was glad I'm glad I was born Amish them folks don't believe in abortions I got to come foreign birth control in any form fashion that's right he got 12 kids I could tell you more details they believe in you know having children amen I guess that's all right all right now let's go on so now I know this here nothing happens by chance he knows all about it it's all pre-planned plan for Generations way way back therefore the bride and the Rapture will come forth and there and that's it's all pre-planned by God I mean those throughout your series The Rapture is it those are uh you know we which are alive and remain unto the coming of large it's all pre-planned shall not prevent them another sleep but amen because God's Gonna he's all God is already getting all plan God knows who's going to be in that rapture God knows who's going to be ready and who's not going to be ready all right all pre-planned by God backed up from the beginning you know it every man and every place who would sit and all about it it's all pre-planned God knew it would be here oh my when he made it do it that way he said he's gone to prepare a place for us and when we get there it'll all be prepared um just like Miss Knight is prepared like this hour is prepared amen praise the Lord I thought well praise be to God I'm glad to be in the heart saw me here preaching for the foundation of the world he saw you sitting there before the foundation in the world he knew exactly what's up you could lay on my heart to preach before the foundation he knew what you would not need him he knows what we need amen it's all in the plan of God now boy if you really want to kick your foot on the corner of your bed and just about tear your toenail off try going against God's plan you want to really kick against the Pricks huh come really and just hurt yourself real bad try to go against what God has planned try to go against his program see how that works for you there it is oh yeah I'm going after him that poor guy rather feet didn't stand a chance did he that man had done so much wickedness already in his life that God just use his mind Pharaoh didn't after he said pharaohs said just go kick everything and just get out of here that's what Pharaoh he wanted some peace and comfort he don't want fleas and flies and under his sheep dumping up down biting him everywhere he was tired of it just go God says never Pharaoh you're not getting off that easy he put them thoughts in Pharaoh's heart he says he made him stubborn he says you know I I can't stand this I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna go get him huh I'm gonna go get him God made him go after him didn't he the Bible clearly states that he's hard and Pharaoh's heart that's why he hardened his heart it would have been smart to go as his first thought but you ain't gonna control it and God is totally just because of all the evil that he had done anyway God knows what he's doing huh going against God's program and all of his all of his chariots and horses in his whole Army drowning in the sea man boy it was a bad thing for him wasn't he it was a bad day I think in the movie I ain't seen it in the coon's age but in the movie he says now he's even defeated your army that little herds man just really whooped you up put up woman or whatever uh he was really deflated but she rubbed it in I'm not wrong Lord help us I mean he says Lord I don't want to go against your plan let me stay with the program it's all pre-planned God makes preparation he takes care of things for us amen that's when he said his great foreknowledge tells him all these things amen amen he can't be just like the wind all over the Earth because he's a being he's not a myth and he dwells he even dwells in the house he dwells in a place called heaven for omnipresent omniscient and so forth but it was his before knowledge let him do all these things now notice I'm gonna skip this for now anyway and go into how we get ready is that all right you ready now notice he says look at your Earthly parents before you come here before they knew that you when they knew you was coming they made ready for your coming amen I like this brother Adam is going somewhere and he's taking a natural typing the spirit just think of it now your Earthly parents with the Earthly parent is only a type of our Heavenly parent for we know that how to give our good good gifts to our children how much more does our Heaven if I don't know how to give good kids to these children see they made ready you're coming they made you a little crib and they made the booties and so forth and the clothes and everything made ready for you to arrive prepare before you even come to Earth and Jesus has gone to make ready our coming there now notice he has went to make ready there but he's telling you to get ready to come there that's going to be on you and me all right oh I know the holy spirit will help us to do that but he says the bride has made herself ready and Jesus says be ye ready amen see notice in my father's house or many mansions that's right and he explains it about Revelations 2 and donate to add or take away but he says In My Father's Heart many mansions is many kinds of mansions many kinds of mansions now I don't believe that when we get to heaven that everybody will look just exactly alike amen I mean those these mansions that we're going to they're all going to be different this is what he says they're not all going to be blondes or brunettes amen not all big not all Giants I believe in God he's a god of variety the world proves that talking about each and every one of us and Paul said if we born the image of the Earthly we will also bear the image of the heavenly amen amen this and how many knows he said that when you get over there you know uh you're gonna have the same image or whatever that's what you had here amen God knows just how to make your body I mean it's not going to be out of whack it's not going to be overweight not gonna be too skinny or it's just gonna be just right you know how much conflict people get because somebody don't look like them or and so forth laughs right I'll just say what comes to mind I hope it's okay most of the time we think everybody else looks funny the guy in the mirror is the only one that looks right oh my but not with him so he goes into this now notice and he also talks about how that he makes every person different as far as your desires that's why he makes the mountains he makes the planes he makes the deserts isn't that right he says some people love mountains some people like deserts some people black cat because some people like this that or the other it'd be terrible to have to live somewhere where you really hate it all right I hope everybody is living where you like it amen well thank God thank God say thank you Lord Jesus for letting me live where I won't amen where I'll enjoy it amen praise the Lord I always wanted a place like brother Brad's out there looking over her just looking way out over everywhere well be able to see fire that's awesome he'd give me a place where I didn't be able to see far but he gave me something else that I'm real happy with the love that's to be able to look from my house almost straight down way down into the woods hello that's why I get still get a good view and yeah so God makes us different and that right he makes us all different praise the Lord uh now he goes into something a little the temporal gifts that God gives it it's only expressing that there's an eternal one uh let me finish this now notice oh this is a different quote now we know that Moses in building the Tabernacle in the wilderness or preparing it he said that he made things after the order that he saw in heaven so the Earthly things only express what the Eternal Things Are praise be to God let me finish this quote because it'll explain it all and the flowers and things and it's an expression one that's dying is only expressing one that's Eternal amen when you see a tree struggling and pulling and trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that when you see a man here struggling to okay sister Johnny struggling for air as we did brother I haven't watched him go amen and just struggling struggling they want to live yeah you want to let her strong with struggling amen every struggle amen that tells me there's a place there's a body amen that they won't struggle they won't have to struggle anymore it's eternal aren't you happy for that to know oh my to live somebody in the hospital or a sick bed or an accident struggling and the death rattles in their throat and pulling and crying and screaming for Life what does that mean that there's a place somewhere the there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that see it just doesn't do that these are temporal gifts that God has given they're expressing verse 1 over there that's eternal Beulah Land I'm longing for and someday on the I'll Stand there My Hope amen shall be turned aren't yours it's longing for that amen now remember the Bible said if tabernacular or dwelling if it perish then we have one already waiting just as a little baby it's little muscles and the mother are twisting and turning and notice you can take a woman she can be ever so foul but when that she used to be a mother a little while before that baby born there's a kindness about that woman get around and there's always something she's more tender why there's a little angel Spirit waiting to receive that natural body just as soon as he's born the Breath of Life comes into it God breathing in there and it becomes a living Soul not just as this baby is being born than the spiritual body is there to receive it and now when this body is dropped here on Earth just like the babies drop also there is an immortal body they're waiting to receive the spirit back into itself again oh what a great thing amen I wrote something else down here and I said also if you'll notice that most of the time oh folks tend to be really sweet oh boy hello folks that ain't a whole lot of amens coming from there I I noticed there's some you know and you get a little old lady in them or a man a young man come up there and kind of be roughy they'll slap him around for being so rude and so unthoughtful right we like thoughtful people we like to be thoughtful we like to be kind say we huh sure why and I thought why because they're getting ready for that new body they're getting ready should we say shouldn't be the same way with Christians be kind-hearted one to another it says now what is this that's what Believers are Christians are amen that's right not just a pregnant woman sometimes our elderly of course you all know the other side of the story if they're not a Christian they can be a grouchy old man and a grumpy old woman Lord help us brother bam says Don't Let The Devil Crown my life with that I'd rather meet a sweet little old lady than I would have mean little old lady that's all right no names mentioned amen he loves the Lord God is good isn't he all right all right wow now let's talk about this baby for a minute brother bam says before these little babies born this little baby I think I seen a sign somewhere where was it I can't think of where but it's where they served alcohol and so forth and there was a sign up warning drinking alcohol can cause birth defects right it could give you a warning that if a woman drinks this or smokes this or all of this what does it cause they warn against eating the wrong thing because it'll cause a birth defect amen so now notice this mother this little baby perhaps craving some vitamin in the mother's word speak speak forth dad I want some cantaloupe or watermelon I want something another he'll do everything he can to get that because he knows that he wants his child to be born perfect amen as it can be that's right anybody to have little children you know nowadays you ain't got sweated because they got these X-rays and they could tell you if it doesn't have but two fingers right but before man but look when he comes out Mom and Dad they want to look over one two three four five yep one two three yeah that's terrific hands perfect feet legs are fine it's not turn twisted or anything it's a it's a card for a bird you want that child right right amen I can get an amen on that everybody wants normally born babies in order to do that that mother is very concerned to Dad's very concerned and this just comes to mind that Daniel boy he'll be twice as nice and alive and don't work too hard and and don't do no dancing don't jump on but now you know he'll probably give her all kinds of coaching that he's wearing he's concerned that that baby will turn out right amen oh my he'll do everything he can because he wants a child just as perfect this can be he'll do everything he's able to do it how much abler is he the Creator now I may know that Jesus when we get there he wants you perfect I love the quote but the mom says you know God brother Brown says you God wants you perfect and you have to be perfect to go there that's what he said [Music] huh that's right because how many knows you're just not going to go in there with a bunch of sin on you yet it's got to be dealt with here even Jesus says be ye perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect amen so this is about getting ready for that you got to be ready for the coming of the Lord that's what Jesus said be prepared be ready amen amen now think of how able he is to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live there's something in us that calls to live there's something in us that calls to do right then God calls somebody to the platformer to the public that'll preach the absolute truth why it shows you then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God take this away from me circumcise me from this to take these things away from me why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to that he's going to prepare Hallelujah Lord take this away take that away I want everything right Lord help me to feed on your word it's very important our daily diet it's so important a lot of us would be healthier if our daily diet would be right naturally and then a lot of us be like more spiritually healthy if our daily diet would be right it's important what you eat it's important what you can do amen therefore if you've got tonight just come and said well I offer Christ my life if you've never received the Holy Ghost come into it you must do it you must grow into it ask God to pile a word on top of the word amen until you become a full stature of the son and daughter of God amen Jesus said be perfect Ephesians Paul says you know godson gives to Men He said pastor Jesus the problem of the Saints for the edifying of the body of Christ until we come to the full measure of Christ unto a perfect man cause when we get there when we look if you go in the Rapture folks God's Gonna seize you as perfect you might not see yourself as perfect I don't see myself as perfect I see my faults and failures and I say God how could you ever take me into heaven huh my faults my failure me they taught me they're they're uh I hate them they bother me and I think why did it bother me boy I think I'm not even fit to go into the kingdom of God Amen and I think well you know there's a reason you feel so bad about you know what you're not and your false and failures that's a good sign most people feel so holy and righteous that they're bad doesn't ever bother them that's scary walks of the world out first John John says if you the world are the things of the world it's because the love of God is not even in you you've been deceived you've got the love of the world there and it's deceived you the devil has by piling these things over on you amen praise be to God oh my God now notice brother bam talks about our house our this this house here it's like an old coat that you wear amen it's like an old coat amen it's like a pest house isn't that right that's what the flesh is the pest house you don't know when an old cancer is going to jump on you and grow and everything else and huh folks you've seen people that their nose got to eat off by cancer their ear and all kinds of things just a pest house my amen but it's going to be changed in now I know this now it's now notice he talks about this whole body and how did it's born the inmates of the Earthly now it's going to Bear also there's a in the image of the heavenly I mean when you get born again that's that little baby forming in there amen that little baby it's got a Content nine months isn't that right it's come to maturity orange called the preemie right God's not going to know premature rapture he's gonna have that time ready it's got to come to full growth it needs vitamins we eat the vitamins let me curve to peace too I got to think about what all these vitamins are but all this food is that we're supposed to take in what is pride food I wrote down here well first of all it's food that's been stored up because God told Mother about him star is food up oh my I dare say that if we would have tapes or books we would be right back in Babylon well God said the prophet but we don't know what he said huh what could that would that do us it'd all be hearsay and let me tell you something you don't go by here saying the message you go to Africa and they're worshiping brother Banner claiming he's Jesus and everything else thousands upon thousands of people like a brother uh benora said in the Philippines in different places they they do the same struggles we did here in America when we first started out all kinds of false doctrines and fall things that we had to get over and we had to struggle through all of that stuff amen but we have stored food we have spiritual food and Deuces and we're like that woman a man that was down to her last morsel we tried the last denomination and we were going to take the last denomination then we're going to quit we're gonna die because we don't know what else to do but God come in there and he give us Spirit to food and not a meal no don't run dry and the crews don't run dry there's always oil there's always bread Amen on the Wednesday night there's bread on the Sunday morning against bread there's food makes you feel like jumping makes you feel frisk Y come on it's okay I make more noise than anybody you ain't gonna bother me all right isn't that the truth though you got food to give your soul spiritual food because we're living in a what dry and thirsty land where no water is that's right people ain't got you can't live on denominational food ah you sisters it's okay if you want to cut your hair I want a little makeup and wear trousers and pants it's all right God don't look at that with the parents can anybody say Amen to that he can they're like a preacher didn't buy the brown say that in the God of this evil age she loves she he allows her to sin and she loves him for it denominations love to have the legalized sin in their churches and all these other stuff hello but you can't live on that you can't make nobody perfect like that you can't come to perfection eating poison well today's the Miracles has passed so we got stored food first of all you gotta believe Malachi 4 5 because it's for our day it's food for y'all behold I'll send you a mind you the prophet before the ground coming up the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He will do what he will turn Thomas's Ballard's heart he will turn your heart back to the faith that Paul had he will bring us back the things that Jesus just the way that Jesus said it and then it'll bring to the Perfection that they had that's the kind of food that we have to eat and it comes from Malachi Malachi 4 Foo turning the hearts back back to the faith of the fathers the Bible says Hallelujah same Faith there not only that Paul had but we go past Paul past oh I better watch what I'm saying here brother sister Becky pass Paul well I don't know that Paul had all that much discernment but when brother Branham came and Jesus would come down on the platform he would discern the thoughts and Tents of the heart just like he did with the woman to do well we have the faith that Jesus had when he was here on Earth all the way back to Jesus Christ Jesus Christ's own life and brother Brown what was it the Masterpiece he talked about how that that word has come up it has come up to Luther to walking age Wesley the sanctification age Pentecost the speaking in tongue age ah and all the way up to the IH prophetic to be able to see all these things prophetic age all the way up to the head up here where the mind is to where we even know the very mind of God to the full Center of Christ until God manifested himself just like he was walking on the shores of Galilee through his body his church and the Easter brother banned him to do it discern the thoughts and intents of the heart huh where should our faith be that's why the property of God says this this is rapturing Faith in his message because you without a doubt amen that he wasn't brother Branham that was Jesus Christ the word of God discerns us thoughts and intents of the heart brother Brown couldn't do it he always had to wait here and you know what I'm waiting on if you don't come well we might as well go home and go to bed [Laughter] [Applause] somewhere tell me if you did after church tell me if you ever read somewhere I heard somewhere where he just didn't show oh Jesus I think brother Tommy brought it out he says you know in a testimony when Billy Paul got the God was given the privilege of looking at that angel he says that angel wouldn't even look at him that angel kept his eye on brother the whole time kept his eye on him let me see how many knows brother Brown had an angel follow him all the days all his life even when he went to commit suicide and reach for the hot wire up on the telephone wire reached for that and found himself on the floor can I imagine a little let me tell you something he missed his wife so much he couldn't even live with himself because of the sorrow in his heart that he had caused he says I can't I'm a coward I can't do it anymore next thing he knowed he was laying on the ground my imagination is that somebody grabbed him laid him down there don't know that he had any broken bones or a broken neck from falling from all the way up there right something had to just bring him down like I said I don't know what it was but I wouldn't doubt it amen I like that oh he was still so sorry for brother Glenn he's so sad when he got home he was in the room and he remembered his wife remembered all of those things he was so tired so softly grabbed the gun put his head cocked it and pulled the trigger pull trigger it wouldn't shoot across out and dang shot off when he threw it off there he won't even let me kill myself I won't even let me stop we tend to mind he comes in the way of a transgressor Isn't it nice to know that when God has a plan I don't care how many guns you punch it ahead you ain't gonna get accomplished no it isn't God doesn't take a detour and well I got to come up with a second plan though he's going to make it happen thank you Lord because he was thinking of you he was thinking of me he was going to bring us a mess he said would bring us to Christ he would point to Christ not himself that's what made the prophet a prophet to me he wasn't pointing and never pointing it to himself always point it to the Christ amen all robbers Billy Graham or a lot of a lot of folks man they point to their self but I'm here to tell you he pointed Judah Christ that is his word amen praise the Lord yeah I got plenty of them up here I got three of them not bad for eight dollars I'm so glad to be able to see except for reading just like it was man you know it's something a little testimonial here in the middle of it but when I was going to see the doctor the second time because the first wouldn't work because my eyesight were getting better somebody should have told me brother I believe your eyesight's going to come back I just wait before you spent that other 450 dollars I said you know I believe it's coming back and but I was going for the second time I said well I guess I'll go and try it you know and I should have listened to the inner voice because not had a 400 set sitting in the cabinet that I can't use don't want to use I'm happy to have him in there yeah I'm sorry I haven't seen that I'm glad to have it in the cabinet that's right folks that's something amen isn't God good isn't it good to be Christian I'm telling you amen just another half hour is that all right bam talked about how did you staggered into a mission somewhere you didn't really understand what was going on the preach preacher certain subject and you write fell at the altar and you don't really know what it was all about hey man I thought about brother Glenn all this and I said you know you staggered into the church and there's just something about it right you don't know what but it's the truth isn't that right just in brother bam says it's just fitting to you it's just fitting to you something just fits right with you hey man I should I just can't hardly be a Christian folks if you are if you're at that place you need to get closer to God because when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not so hard I mean it's the best thing ever and if you ever totally surrendered from the flesh because that's what keeps you back in the first place and makes it hard hey man praise the Lord but it just fits you I mean it was being a Christian just fits you I'm happy of where I am with the Lord I'm glad to be Christian I wouldn't want to be anything else how about you tonight turn the hearts Revelations the first three chapters amen think about it the fourth chapter says come on up higher now I will show you amen things to come we're feeding on that how many believe that we're feeding on Revelation The Book of Revelations we understand the mysteries of God Revelation 10 7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared unto his servants of prophets now we're even feeding on the knowledge and the understanding of what it was all about amen aren't you glad for that come up to the revelations fourth chapter find out that there was one that sat on the throne no more under Heaven uh uh uh misunderstanding there's just three Gods is there one God how many gods is there now you know there's one that sits on the throne the one that liveth and was dead and behold and of death amen praise the Lord and we're feeding on Revelations 18. and I heard another Voice come out of heaven saying come out of her my people that you partake not ever sins and that you received none of her plagues how many believes that's amen what we're feeding on we're feeding on Revelations 19. Revelation 19 Amen to bride has made herself ready that's what you and I are doing let me go on I got to think and I said boy that was when you just think about what you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man brother bam says you're not feeding on brother Branham you're feeding on the unfailing body word of almighty God you're feeding on Christ you've heard the saying you are what you eat I may believe that you feed on a carrion and and old dead things you're probably a quote huh but if you are a dove you are what you eat you can't eat all that old crowser the crow can eat wheat and grain and a lot don't need that stuff amen but a real Dove can only feed on good things amen you ought what you eat a bride member can't like I said earlier feed on denominational slop you can't feed on some food that was for yesterday some man-made Creed and doctrines hello people are happy just feeding on well you got to be Amish or you got to be Mennonite you got to speak in tongues this out of the other that doesn't make me happy I want to be like Christ I want more of Christ I want to be in the full stature of Christ nothing less will suffice are you with me how many believe you guys come to the full statue of Christ time to grow up time to get away from the things of the world amen all right now notice you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside come into subjections because the inside is pulling it bringing it in line with the word of God you're inside you yourself you're being or people he said listen have you made reservations to change coats have you made reservations for heaven remember you must make reservations you have to make preparation you have to make ready how do you make ready well the Bible talks about whether there was a wedding made amen and all of the different ones came in but at the door they were all given a wedding garment and right giving a wedding garment when Jesus came there was one that it didn't have the wedding on it he says how did you get it throwing me down or Darkness you ain't gonna get in there unless you've got the Garment of Jesus Christ's righteousness what is the robe of Christ it's his own life huh the robe the ticket the reservation that you have to have is Christ's robe of righteousness his life you can't just make your life and his life blend together now your life has to be dead it has to be his life but if I'm says nothing but the literal life of Jesus Christ is going to be accepted on that day it's a token and it's like a reservation at a hotel you know it's so nice isn't it nowadays everything is so nice that you can get online and you can make a reservation that when you get to there you can just give them your name and you don't have to give them anything you already got your card okay you go to room so and so every one of us probably traveled and got to a place where you were looking for a hotel we're booked up there's a race there's a distance there's a knot there's a game in every Hotel he's booked up and folk I ain't telling you how many times I've had to go to the next three accidents to try to find the place and it ain't so good most of the time when you do finally found one you might think it went stop that the restroom the rest area and slept in your truck bed off but anyway it's nice to have reservations when you get there you're ready everybody says when I get to that place I want to have my ticket in my hand when you come to that door have your ticket in your hand had a token in your hand be prepared Lord help us tonight I thought mine thank you Jesus I'm glad that we can make preparations be ready Jesus said just like a thief coming be ready when you're ready you ain't got a fear in the world amen that's the way the coming of the Lord didn't they say oh brother we keep talking about the coming of the Lord that Jesus is coming you're scaring people of death he said what 10 people Jesus is not the boogeyman you ain't got to be scared that he's coming no you can be glad praise be to God we've been looking for him to come amen I like that don't you a good old-fashioned question asking brother Brandon well you know you scare people and he's let them know man if you're ready for his coming you ain't got to be scared you've made reservations and even Jesus says you don't know the day or the hour how many knows we're leaving in the evening times we're living in this time when he can come anytime evening night Tabernacle and the Saints of evening night Tabernacle you need to be ready now don't wait you'll be ready because he could come at any time we don't know when he's going to come but we're living we know that we're living in the hour of his coming amen can I finish up amen remember you must have the reservations and the Garment of Salvation on oh my little children do you feel the need for that vitamin tonight there's a body waiting under there's a body waiting to be received people don't be deceived don't be deceived the Devil is a deceiver I mean you've got to have that wedding gone it and you must wear it it must be and we're in evening time of this Earthly body of this be dissolved remember 1919 days before he actually went to this new body dissolve we are there is a pre we're preparing to enter into that heavenly and we now feel that strange call of God to go to this great Eden and before we could be born here our little bodies cried for something and it had to be provided or it would be an Afflicted child here if it wasn't so and God has no afflictions up there there everyone is perfectly lined up the bride just exactly like the groom was the word manifested in his Seasons God granted tonight children each one of you there is a heaven to go to and a hell to shun me as an old man again same message I've preached around the world I've got millions foreign but I know that I got to stand with you younger he says listen get away from the things of the world can you imagine this old sage of a prophet seen everything and it comes down to the closing doors he says get away from the things of the world if there's something in you that you still want to act the way that you acted and do the things that the world that's in you remember you're not of Gods you're just a Churchman until that call that deep calls remember if you love the world or things of the world love of God isn't even in you blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness see you raised your hand a while ago I want more of God see there's something needy if you love the world the things of the world the world's travel you'll go and in the fall you'll be see come out your sons and daughters of the king be lady and gentlemen walk like Christians live like Christians act like Christians remember I'll meet you at the Judgment bar with these remarks amen how many wants that things that are to be thank you Lord Jesus let me become to full maturity because I feed on the right thing not smoke drink not take uh well God didn't mean this and God don't mean that and this don't matter no Lord I want it to be loud I want to be lined up with the word are you with me listen in closing here look in the Looking Glass see which way you're headed how many believes that you got to stay in chastisement if you can't stand chastisement you're not a God isn't that right now notice and you say well I don't want to hear that stuff I'm a Christian all right go ahead that's once your evidence that you're not a child of God but a real child of God is hungering and thirsting why if there's something in your heart telling you you want it and it needs there it shows there's something pulsating trying to pull you there there's a body there that this one is a type of year what are you using this one for to glorify the devil or in the world the Fashions and things or are you looking towards heaven and there's something up there and you're glorifying God with your life God bless you let's stand tonight let's bow our heads how many realize that you have some touring to do some growing to do to becoming more like Christ more gentler sweeter more of the Holy Spirit loving the things of the world less and loving the things of God more Lord Jesus you see these honest hands I believe they're your children and they're great groaning they're thirsting Lord
