[53:13] little bit better and you know just

[53:18] message we have the Lord in common and
[53:20] brother Brad and I we go a little bit
[53:22] ways back so just great to be here again
[53:24] and for all the lers they got great big
[53:28] hearts great big hearts I messed up last
[53:31] night they may have not remember me from
[53:33] the last time they'll never forgive me
[53:34] from last night I'm just trust they'll
[53:37] forgive me for last night if you have
[53:40] your Bibles I want to speak to you this
[53:41] morning try to kind of take these two
[53:43] services that we' spoken and you know I
[53:46] mentioned to you earlier that God gave
[53:48] me two services but I knew expressly
[53:51] that I needed to speak those in the
[53:53] order in which to speak them and and
[53:55] this and as I was up last week uh
[53:58] meditating on a hunting trip and just
[54:00] praying about the service I took back
[54:02] home last week and also this weekend the
[54:05] Lord also would have me to speak this
[54:07] here as well I want to speak to you on
[54:10] we will finish
[54:13] it all right so it's one thing to see
[54:15] somebody else in that picture of Victory
[54:17] but it's another thing to see yourself
[54:19] in that place of Victory and I want you
[54:21] to know today that many of us we have
[54:23] silenced a voice that the enemy you
[54:25] heard from the voice of the Lord but I
[54:27] want to come back this morning and by
[54:28] the help of the Lord not me but the help
[54:30] of the Lord to encourage you that we
[54:32] will finish this fight yeah okay so we
[54:36] look here in John 14 and12 it says
[54:39] verily verily I say unto you he that
[54:41] believeth on me and the works that I do
[54:46] shall he do also yes and Greater Works
[54:50] than these than these shall he do
[54:52] because I go unto my father also in 2
[54:56] Corinthians 6 and verse one says we then
[54:59] as workers together with him beseech you
[55:02] also that you receive not the grace of
[55:05] God in vain so we find here that the
[55:08] works that he did we're to do also
[55:10] second Corinthians 61 then we are
[55:13] workers together with him go to 2
[55:16] Corinthians
[55:17] 5:18 it says and all things are of God
[55:20] who has reconciled us to
[55:24] himself
[55:25] yes reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[55:28] Christ and has given to us the ministry
[55:31] of reconciliation so we have a work to
[55:33] do we have a Ministry of reconciliation
[55:36] to it that God was in Christ reconciling
[55:38] the world to himself not imputing their
[55:41] transp their trans trespasses unto them
[55:44] and had committed unto us the word of
[55:47] reconciliation now then we are
[55:49] ambassadors for Christ and though God
[55:52] did not beseech You by us we pray you in
[55:54] Christ Christ dead be ye reconciled God
[55:57] bless you you can have your seats this
[56:00] morning so we find here that each of us
[56:04] here today are Servants of the lord we
[56:08] have a
[56:09] responsibility and it's more than just
[56:11] coming to church on Wednesday night it's
[56:13] more than just coming to church and
[56:15] occupying a a certain Pew and on Sunday
[56:18] morning or just special meetings it's
[56:20] more than that but we have a work to do
[56:23] and and the Bible says that if you
[56:25] believe on me and the works that I do
[56:27] you shall do also yeah and so we find
[56:30] both in in in in 2 Corinthians 5:20 that
[56:33] here Paul is calling us he tells us
[56:35] you're ambassadors for Christ and
[56:37] Bloomfield would tell us this definition
[56:39] of Ambassador is an age man it's an ELD
[56:43] it means that one acts as an ambassador
[56:46] sometimes merely to deliver a message
[56:49] for another without being empowered to
[56:51] do anything more just an explain it or
[56:54] and for it so understand when we preach
[56:57] the gospel to you we're ambassadors of
[56:59] Christ it's not my idea it's not brother
[57:02] bram's idea it's not our message it's
[57:04] not our we're not empowered to enforce
[57:06] it we're just here to explain it to you
[57:09] we're here to deliver the word to you
[57:11] because we're acting as an ambassador on
[57:14] behalf of the cause of Christ and each
[57:16] one of you here tonight are an
[57:18] ambassador of that cause it's not you
[57:21] don't have to try to break it all down
[57:22] figure it all out but God has asking
[57:24] asking you to live it to believe it to
[57:27] declare it into a dying generation that
[57:29] he is still the same he is still in
[57:31] effect he is still the god that moves
[57:33] he's still a God that does Miracles he's
[57:35] still a God that does mighty Works he's
[57:37] not doing in the Corporal body today but
[57:40] he's doing in the body of his bride and
[57:42] he's hearing you and I and the works
[57:43] that I do shall you do
[57:47] also you ain't got to try to figure it
[57:49] all out you just got to believe it and
[57:51] put it in process and God will do the
[57:54] rest
[57:56] right now Webster would tell us an
[57:58] ambassador is a minister of the highest
[58:00] rank employed by one Prince or state at
[58:04] the court of another two manage the
[58:07] concerns of his own Prince or state and
[58:09] representing the
[58:11] dignity and the power of His Sovereign
[58:14] he is sent to do what the Sovereign
[58:17] would himself if he was
[58:19] present you are an ambassador you were
[58:23] sent here in this age to do exactly what
[58:26] he would do if he was here himself
[58:29] that's exactly right see they are sent
[58:31] to make known the will of The Sovereign
[58:33] and to negotiate the matters of Commerce
[58:36] of War of peace and in general
[58:38] everything affecting the interest of the
[58:41] Sovereign among the people whom they are
[58:43] sent so we don't come with our own
[58:45] agenda we don't come with our own ideas
[58:48] we don't come with our own intellects
[58:50] but we come with the message from the
[58:52] King that the same things he did when
[58:54] when he was here in the physical form
[58:56] are we are to do as well don't ever let
[59:00] the devil talk you out of who you are
[59:03] now I've been preaching on that if you
[59:04] can understand exactly who you are then
[59:07] the devil the powers of Hell will be
[59:12] defenseless so you say brother Joe what
[59:15] do you mean we will finish it I mean we
[59:19] will finish
[59:21] it but you know a lot of times we want
[59:23] to put it on somebody El we want
[59:25] somebody to do the work for
[59:27] us come on let's just be
[59:30] honest sometimes it's too much to bear
[59:33] the load sometimes it's too much to
[59:35] carry the weight sometimes it's too much
[59:37] to get on our knees and pray yeah you
[59:41] know sometimes we can pray for somebody
[59:42] else more than we even pray for our own
[59:45] our own selves and our own needs because
[59:47] it seems like the faith would rise up
[59:49] for somebody else more so than have
[59:51] faith for God in your trial and your
[59:52] situation and brother Brandon tell us
[59:55] here now when God when when Jesus was on
[59:57] the cross and he bowed his head and died
[1:00:00] and he said it is finished the entire
[1:00:03] Plan of Redemption was finished right
[1:00:05] there every soul that would ever be
[1:00:08] saved was finished right there every
[1:00:10] sickness that ever would be uh that
[1:00:12] would anybody would ever have every
[1:00:14] Cancer that would ever be delivered
[1:00:15] everything that he did he did it right
[1:00:18] there when he bowed his head and died
[1:00:21] but I also want you to know that they
[1:00:22] question or maybe not question but Paul
[1:00:24] will tell us that he that began the good
[1:00:27] work will perform it he will finish it
[1:00:31] because you and I sometimes we wonder
[1:00:33] when will God finish this when will God
[1:00:36] do what he says he will do but Paul is
[1:00:38] telling us he's come back to tell you
[1:00:41] again today he will finish it and I'm
[1:00:44] here to tell you tonight or this morning
[1:00:46] rather we will finish it it won't be a
[1:00:49] man it won't be an idea it won't be a
[1:00:51] denomination but it will be the same
[1:00:53] savior working in and through his body
[1:00:56] in and through his body performing the
[1:00:58] same Works believing the same work and
[1:01:01] ministering the same miraculous
[1:01:03] Supernatural power and we will finish
[1:01:06] this work thank you Lord he said when
[1:01:10] the Great Shepherd was smitten the great
[1:01:12] sheep sheep Shepherd Prophet when he was
[1:01:15] smitten back there he said it is
[1:01:17] finished and that minute as soon as this
[1:01:21] Shepherd was smitten it was over sin was
[1:01:24] settled there was no
[1:01:26] more more
[1:01:28] sin they were clean the penalty was paid
[1:01:32] the Believers whose names were written
[1:01:34] in the Book of Life predestinated from
[1:01:36] before the foundation of the world it
[1:01:38] was finished the very minute that Jesus
[1:01:41] said it was finished he the great
[1:01:43] shepherd He had come for his sheep he it
[1:01:46] was finished God's right hand was pulled
[1:01:48] from his bosom smitten then on Easter he
[1:01:50] returned it amen raised it up again to
[1:01:53] his bosom and he he extended it down to
[1:01:55] you and I in the form of his word to
[1:01:57] redeem us back to the original Garden
[1:02:00] from which we came so tonight we or this
[1:02:03] morning rather we want to speak on he
[1:02:05] will finish it so Jesus had a work to do
[1:02:08] when he was here
[1:02:10] yeah and just as he had a work to do so
[1:02:14] do we as the bride have a work to
[1:02:17] do so he finished what was allotted for
[1:02:20] him
[1:02:22] him yes and we're going to finish what's
[1:02:25] allotted for us Revelations 19 and verse
[1:02:28] 6 and I heard as it were a voice of a
[1:02:31] great multitude and a voice of many
[1:02:33] Waters and is a voice of many mighty
[1:02:36] Thunder and saying Allelujah for the
[1:02:38] Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad

[1:04:41] the Greek word

[1:04:45] special word here it means to Bear a
[1:04:48] name to Bear a
[1:04:53] title

[1:04:59] endued with the right to bear the
[1:05:03] title not a message not a Pentecost not
[1:05:08] a method or or Presbyterian or message
[1:05:11] but we have been given the right to bear
[1:05:14] the title
[1:05:16] bride there was a lot of young sisters
[1:05:19] when I came in this
[1:05:23] message
[1:05:24] all right Brothers there was a lot of
[1:05:26] young sisters you had choice you we call
[1:05:29] it pick of the litter
[1:05:31] right not sure how big the litter was
[1:05:34] but anyway you had a choice you could
[1:05:36] choose and you be begin to choose you
[1:05:39] begin to look you begin to evaluate does
[1:05:42] that person match what's inside of me

[1:05:48] person have the character that I'm
[1:05:49] looking for to be my wife to raise my
[1:05:52] children and so we find mind here that
[1:05:55] you have been given the right to bear
[1:05:58] the title so when I ask my wife Jess sha
[1:06:02] at the time to marry me she was being
[1:06:05] she's given the right right there to
[1:06:07] Bear the title of Miss Joe Adams and so
[1:06:11] what am I tell telling you is that we
[1:06:13] have been given the special privilege
[1:06:16] it's not for everybody look I didn't
[1:06:18] marry every young girl in the church I
[1:06:20] married one I chose one in the same way
[1:06:23] with Christ me many are out there but
[1:06:25] he's only choosing one and you were
[1:06:27] chosen in him to Bear the title of Miss
[1:06:31] Jesus Christ that's right called out
[1:06:36] called unto the marriage of the Lamb
[1:06:39] here he says now the word church means
[1:06:41] called out and Moses as Moses called a
[1:06:44] nation out of a Nation the holy spirit
[1:06:46] is calling a bride out of a church a
[1:06:49] church out of a church members from
[1:06:51] every denomination making up a bride the
[1:06:54] bride tree he said and the bride coming
[1:06:56] out the call now he said the bride tree
[1:06:59] it is that the bride rather is the one
[1:07:01] that's going to be in the Rapture in
[1:07:03] that alone nothing but the bride the
[1:07:06] elected ones forn by God from the
[1:07:09] beginning of the father's spiritual
[1:07:12] genes right don't you see this place you
[1:07:16] firmly in the plan of God yes so when
[1:07:20] Satan comes he's got another leg to
[1:07:22] stand on because now you see you've been
[1:07:25] given a name you've been given the
[1:07:27] opportunity or the privilege you've been
[1:07:30] furnished he's done it he's done it for
[1:07:32] you he's given you everything that you
[1:07:33] need so that you can bear his name yeah
[1:07:37] we find Revelations 2 and verse1 17 that
[1:07:39] says he that hath an ear now we spoke on
[1:07:42] that the last couple nights he that hath
[1:07:44] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:07:46] saith unto the churches to him that
[1:07:49] overcometh will I give to e of the
[1:07:52] Hidden mana and I will give him a white
[1:07:54] stone and in the stone a new name which
[1:07:57] no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
[1:08:01] it all right so each age and we find
[1:08:05] here in this
[1:08:06] age each age that listened to the voice
[1:08:09] each age that listened to the Angel's
[1:08:12] message was promised a
[1:08:15] reward yeah to each one of that age that
[1:08:18] overcame they were promised a reward
[1:08:20] they were promised to to overcome that
[1:08:22] they will be given something and age was
[1:08:24] given to eat of the Hidden mana and now
[1:08:27] brother B would tell us in questions and
[1:08:28] answers he says Jesus is the hidden Mana
[1:08:32] Christ is the church's Mana yeah so
[1:08:35] we're not feeding on man's idea brother
[1:08:37] Thomas but we're feeding on the never
[1:08:39] failing body word of the son of man and
[1:08:42] it doesn't fail today he's still the
[1:08:45] same the word still the same the
[1:08:47] promises are still the F the same
[1:08:49] they're still in effect and you can call
[1:08:52] on God anytime and and procure that to
[1:08:55] yourself and get your desires some of
[1:08:57] you came last night with great needs but
[1:08:59] I want you to know you came with great
[1:09:01] needs and God have responded in it you
[1:09:04] may not feel any different you may have
[1:09:06] walked out feeling the same but I want
[1:09:08] you to know we evoked the name of Jesus
[1:09:10] last night and God's going to take care
[1:09:12] of it and we will finish it some of you
[1:09:16] need a baptism of the Holy Ghost raise
[1:09:18] your hands God we'll finish it you will
[1:09:21] receive it because it's a promise unto
[1:09:23] you
[1:09:24] and to your children and to your
[1:09:25] children's children even un to them that
[1:09:27] are far off God will do what his word
[1:09:30] says He will do yes yes you will notice
[1:09:34] now now in the New Testament what was
[1:09:36] the Mana he says a little while the
[1:09:38] world seeth me no more it's hidden but
[1:09:41] yet you shall see me for I'll be with
[1:09:43] you even in you to the end of the world
[1:09:44] and Christ is that hidden man that comes
[1:09:46] from God out of Heaven every day fresh a
[1:09:50] new blessing a new something coming from
[1:09:52] God and the hidden Mana coming down from
[1:09:55] God out of heaven and we Feast upon the
[1:09:57] Mana which is Christ and he sustains us
[1:10:00] through the Journey till we reach the
[1:10:02] land the other side so we know that the
[1:10:04] Overcomers of the leoan age receives all
[1:10:08] the rewards from the previous ages so we
[1:10:11] get to eat of the tree of life we are
[1:10:13] not going to be hurt by the second death
[1:10:15] we get to eat of the Hidden Mana we got
[1:10:17] power over the Nations we're going to be
[1:10:18] clothed in white rment and we get to sit
[1:10:21] with him in his
[1:10:25] throne so to the Overcomer has been
[1:10:28] given the rights to Feast on the Hidden
[1:10:33] Mysteries yeah Hidden Mysteries that's
[1:10:36] right sages and Prophets and great men
[1:10:38] have longed to hear what we're
[1:10:41] privileged to hear but it was only
[1:10:44] entitled to a special people it's not to
[1:10:47] say that they're not part of that body
[1:10:49] it's not to say they're not part of that
[1:10:50] that work that the that the Bride of the
[1:10:52] previous six ages just were not part of
[1:10:54] it yes they are part of it they received
[1:10:56] the Revelation for their age but we
[1:10:58] receive a greater Revelation in this
[1:11:01] age we get to perceive of the Hidden
[1:11:04] Mysteries because in this Sage it's the
[1:11:06] sounding of the seventh angel when he
[1:11:08] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:11:11] shall be finished
[1:11:14] all all those loose sins from the
[1:11:17] previous ages have now been tied up
[1:11:20] that's right and we have a perfect
[1:11:23] message
[1:11:24] a perfect word we don't need to put our
[1:11:27] own ideas into it it's perfect we don't
[1:11:30] need to ingest any kind of
[1:11:32] denominational view into it it's
[1:11:35] perfect notice here he says now we've
[1:11:37] been given the right to receive of the
[1:11:39] mysteries of God the hidden Mana that's
[1:11:41] been revealed to the
[1:11:43] Overcomer so it's hidden but it's going
[1:11:46] to be revealed to the Overcomer given to
[1:11:49] the Overcomer and we find here and this
[1:11:51] Overcomer is going to get to you know
[1:11:53] the hidden mana and also he's going to
[1:11:54] be given a white stone what does that
[1:11:57] white represent
[1:11:58] Purity yeah and stone represents
[1:12:01] Revelation so he's going to get a pure
[1:12:04] revelation of who he is
[1:12:07] yeah you follow on this this morning yes
[1:12:10] so it's a why it's a revelation nobody
[1:12:11] he asked Peter Peter who do men say that
[1:12:14] I am and we went through this last night
[1:12:15] see it was a revelation that Peter
[1:12:17] caught from God that he was the Christ
[1:12:20] and it's the same Revelation that we get
[1:12:22] from God that this word is Christ it's
[1:12:24] not some man's idea it's not something
[1:12:26] that been set on the shelf for years but
[1:12:28] it's the it's the it's the body word of
[1:12:31] the son of man who's come back in this
[1:12:33] day and now he's injecting himself into
[1:12:36] a body a multi-member body performing
[1:12:39] the same signs the same wonders doing
[1:12:42] the same works and bringing forth the
[1:12:44] same Promises of God each and everything
[1:12:46] the same only thing different is the
[1:12:49] corpal body but what he did in Jesus
[1:12:51] he's going to finish in the bride and
[1:12:53] I'm here to declare to you we will
[1:12:56] finish this
[1:12:59] fight we get a white a pure Revelation
[1:13:02] it's not tainted by ideas of man it's
[1:13:04] not tainted by denominational mindset
[1:13:07] it's a pure Revelation from God yes
[1:13:10] there's no way that a seventh grade
[1:13:12] Kentucky and excuse me for that some of
[1:13:15] you seventh graders here this morning
[1:13:17] but can you imagine some of the deep
[1:13:19] Mysteries that we're preaching today
[1:13:20] came from a seventh grade Kentucky
[1:13:22] preacher
[1:13:24] some boy that can barely read his name
[1:13:26] and write his name it didn't come from
[1:13:28] that but it came from almighty God to
[1:13:31] give a bride a pure revelation of who
[1:13:34] she
[1:13:35] is you're no longer Baptist you're no
[1:13:38] longer Pentecost you're no longer this
[1:13:40] or that but now you are the Bride of
[1:13:43] Jesus Christ called by God elected by
[1:13:46] God anointed by God chosen by God to
[1:13:50] bear that title yes that's
[1:13:55] right to bear that name
[1:13:59] Pride now I trust my wife bears that
[1:14:02] name in
[1:14:04] Pride if you don't we got a long ride
[1:14:06] home
[1:14:09] tonight but that when you ask and she
[1:14:11] says I do oh I do I do I
[1:14:14] do she's happy to Bear your
[1:14:18] name and when you as the bride said yes
[1:14:21] I do what you're saying is I'm
[1:14:25] happy to bear his name I'll bear his
[1:14:29] scars I'll bear his hurts I'll bear his
[1:14:32] pains I'll bear his shortcomings I'm
[1:14:34] happy to bear his name
[1:14:38] yeah and when I gave my heart to the
[1:14:41] Lord I was happy to bear that name
[1:14:44] that's right Paul says I'm not ashamed
[1:14:46] of the Gospel oh church I'm not ashamed
[1:14:49] of this message for it is truth it is
[1:14:51] the reality that God God Is Yet present
[1:14:54] again among us today and it's not for
[1:14:56] everybody but it's for
[1:14:59] you notice here he says the it's only
[1:15:03] revealed at the excuse me at the last
[1:15:05] day when the actual seal is broken now
[1:15:07] he's speaking in the first seal here he
[1:15:09] goes now broken to who not to Christ but
[1:15:12] to the church so the Thunder Thunders
[1:15:15] out it reveals the seal but it's only
[1:15:17] it's not revealed to Christ he's saying
[1:15:18] it's revealed to the church he says
[1:15:20] notice I hope the church truly
[1:15:21] understands it what I mean you people
[1:15:24] notice he says I'm going to call your
[1:15:27] bride so you've been called church for
[1:15:29] so long you've been called Baptist for
[1:15:31] so long you've been called Pentecost for
[1:15:33] so long you've been called you've been
[1:15:34] labeled this and you bore that title for
[1:15:36] so long but in this hour God sent a
[1:15:39] profit and when he begin to break the
[1:15:41] seals loose and begin to show who we
[1:15:43] really are he says I'm no longer going
[1:15:45] to call you a church but now I'm going
[1:15:47] to call you prde because that's your
[1:15:49] real name that's your real Revelation
[1:15:52] and he said in that white stone you get
[1:15:54] a new name it ain't the name of of Adams
[1:15:57] it ain't the name of this or that or El
[1:15:59] in Kentucky or whatever you want to put
[1:16:00] there but it is the name of Miss Jesus
[1:16:03] Christ that's your new identity that's
[1:16:06] who you were that's what God saw you as
[1:16:08] in the back part of his mind is Miss
[1:16:11] Jesus Christ I will have a bride she
[1:16:13] will be without spot she will be without
[1:16:16] blemish she will be
[1:16:19] perfect and I know you woke up this
[1:16:21] morning you didn't look perfect you
[1:16:23] smell perfect you didn't act perfect but
[1:16:25] you are
[1:16:26] perfect because we're perfect by the
[1:16:30] word notice what he says here this is in
[1:16:33] why are the people so tossed about the
[1:16:36] Bible said he that overcometh will I
[1:16:38] give a white stone and a new name that
[1:16:41] no man knows but he himself don't make
[1:16:44] any difference what people
[1:16:46] say right you know yourself when you've
[1:16:49] been brought into the inner Veil see

[1:20:37] Pentecostal people today too many Ricks
[1:20:39] he said that word Elvis and Ricky you
[1:20:41] never heard that in other days it's a
[1:20:43] word it's a name for this day and it
[1:20:45] goes with it he said it's a meaning it
[1:20:47] means something you say the name means
[1:20:50] something or you say the name means
[1:20:52] nothing why did he have to change
[1:20:54] Abram's name to Abraham notice what God
[1:20:57] did in Abram God put his own self came
[1:21:01] down and put an H in Abraham's name or
[1:21:03] Abraham's name so God has injected
[1:21:05] himself in Abraham preparing him for
[1:21:09] that promised son and that's what God
[1:21:11] does in each and every one of us he come
[1:21:13] down and places a part of himself in
[1:21:16] your life so that you can bring forth
[1:21:18] the promised word of this
[1:21:21] hour
[1:21:25] he says why did he change Jacob to
[1:21:27] Israel not until he wrestled with the
[1:21:30] Lord he had to overcome and to the
[1:21:33] Overcomer you get a right to have a new
[1:21:35] name that's right he says now if the

[1:22:11] message but when you take on his name
[1:22:14] you're not taking on the name of a
[1:22:15] thunder you're not taking on the name of
[1:22:17] a peria you're not taking on the name of
[1:22:19] tusos or return Ministry you're taking
[1:22:22] on the name of Miss Jesus Christ that's
[1:22:25] right thank you
[1:22:27] Lord and brother Brown says and we had
[1:22:29] the material on Earth today to make
[1:22:32] ourselves ready don't go outside and dig
[1:22:35] in the corn field out there and try to
[1:22:37] find what you need to make yourself
[1:22:38] ready it's right here everything you
[1:22:41] need to make yourself ready lays within
[1:22:43] the pages of this word and 1200 sermons
[1:22:46] we got everything brother Brown says he
[1:22:48] says they have all the material on earth
[1:22:50] now to make themselves ready if you know
[1:22:52] notice it the Bible says she had made
[1:22:54] herself ready that means you have a work
[1:22:57] to
[1:22:58] do I know some of you don't want to put
[1:23:00] it all on the preachers put it all on
[1:23:02] the deacons put it all on the church
[1:23:04] officials but you have a work to do 1
[1:23:06] Corinthians 3 and ver9 says for we are
[1:23:09] laborers together with God you are God's
[1:23:12] husbandry 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 58
[1:23:15] therefore my beloved Brethren be you
[1:23:17] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[1:23:20] the work of the Lord so we have a work
[1:23:22] to do just as Christ had a work that he
[1:23:25] had to do so does his bride have a work
[1:23:27] to do we are fellow laborers with him we
[1:23:30] must be about the father's business
[1:23:32] we're not here to build kingdoms we're

[1:23:35] build the kingdom of God we're here to
[1:23:37] elevate the name of Jesus Christ we're
[1:23:39] here to show to a dying generation that
[1:23:41] he will have a bride and though she may
[1:23:43] be imperfect in her Humanity she is
[1:23:45] perfect by the word for the word is
[1:23:46] placed her in this hour and she will
[1:23:48] bear that title of Miss Jesus Christ

[1:26:33] he's going to have a child 25 years
[1:26:36] through his ups and through his downs
[1:26:38] but he had a name change that guaranteed
[1:26:41] him the promise yeah and you may have a
[1:26:44] lot of UPS you may have a lot of downs
[1:26:46] but when you get a name change yes it
[1:26:49] guarantees you you're entitled to the
[1:26:51] promise
[1:26:53] and for us it's a Rapture for us it's a
[1:26:55] change of the
[1:26:57] Body for us it's a millennial Reign it's
[1:27:00] a marriage supper that's only for the
[1:27:03] bride yeah I want you to get this this
[1:27:06] is not for
[1:27:07] everybody as I said again last night you
[1:27:10] are a special group of
[1:27:13] people a prophetic
[1:27:16] class oh my thank you
[1:27:20] Jesus notice that now but says in the
[1:27:24] marriage of the Lamb the same way it is
[1:27:26] about Divine Healing he said God has got
[1:27:29] the power to heal
[1:27:31] you if you got the courage to accept
[1:27:34] it see God has got the power to heal you
[1:27:37] because it's already finished but do you
[1:27:39] have the courage to say yes Lord no
[1:27:40] matter how long Lord no matter what it
[1:27:42] takes Lord what happens to my body I
[1:27:44] believe you're still my
[1:27:47] healer you're still my
[1:27:51] deliverer he says notice but you have to
[1:27:54] fight for every inch that's right now
[1:27:57] you can tell I don't mind fighting a
[1:27:59] little bit that's right I don't I was a
[1:28:02] fighter out there in the world man look
[1:28:04] I went to a party one time and I'm not
[1:28:06] glorifying this but I just got to tell
[1:28:07] you how stupid I am I go to a party I'm
[1:28:10] 5 foot five at that time I was 5 foot 6
[1:28:12] and a
[1:28:13] half between here and there it's been 30
[1:28:16] years I lost a lot of well I lost a lot
[1:28:19] so we go to this party and I you know I
[1:28:21] and and and I take on the drinking
[1:28:23] because that's what we did we drank and
[1:28:25] we we carried on and party and all that
[1:28:27] well at the end of the night the biggest
[1:28:29] guy he had have been El ler he was the
[1:28:30] biggest guy in the whole
[1:28:33] party I talent that man to a fight
[1:28:37] stupid but I didn't care because there
[1:28:40] was a fighter inside of me and when God
[1:28:42] got a hold of me he put a fighter on the
[1:28:45] inside of me and when young people when
[1:28:47] you come to camps and you come to prayer
[1:28:48] lines and things like that what is it
[1:28:50] when I come to pray with you it's not me
[1:28:52] but it's that fighter on the inside will
[1:28:54] continue to fight for you and continue
[1:28:55] to believe for you when you want to give
[1:28:57] up we're not giving up we're going to
[1:28:58] press to we're going to fight until God
[1:29:00] brings the results and the prophet of
[1:29:02] God say You must fight if you must Reign
[1:29:04] and he says increase our courage Lord he
[1:29:06] say I've been in the ministry 30 years
[1:29:08] and it's been a fight every single day
[1:29:11] you got to be determined you're G to
[1:29:13] make through you're GNA work it through
[1:29:14] you got to be determined I'm GNA fight
[1:29:16] for the promises of God I'm going to
[1:29:18] fight for my children I'm going to fight
[1:29:20] for my healing I'm going to fight for my
[1:29:22] Deliverance I'm going to fight for the
[1:29:23] Holy Ghost I'm going to fight for every
[1:29:25] promise because why because it's our
[1:29:28] promise it doesn't belong to the enemy
[1:29:30] it doesn't belong to the Philistines it
[1:29:32] doesn't belong to the anus it belongs to
[1:29:34] us as Sons and Daughters of God this
[1:29:36] word belongs to us the land belongs to
[1:29:39] us go in church and kick the demons off
[1:29:42] the land it's your promise it's your
[1:29:44] word it's your land receive it and we
[1:29:47] will finish this God has promised you
[1:29:51] that the land belongs to you go in and
[1:29:54] take possession of
[1:29:56] it so this word or this phrase here you
[1:29:59] got to fight for something how many you
[1:30:00] ever heard that you got to fight for
[1:30:01] something or you'll fall for anything
[1:30:04] yeah so it means to fight in honor of
[1:30:06] someone or something to struggle to be
[1:30:10] willing to put yourself in the
[1:30:13] arena to put yourself In Harm's Way for
[1:30:16] the cause to go to battle to benefit
[1:30:19] somebody else to go to battle in the
[1:30:22] name of someone else the Bible tells us
[1:30:24] in Matthew 11:12 from the days of John
[1:30:27] the Baptist until now the Kingdom of
[1:30:29] Heaven suffered violence but the
[1:30:33] violent the violent taketh by force and
[1:30:36] that word violent there means those who
[1:30:37] are forceful and eager in
[1:30:41] Pursuit eager and forceful to bring
[1:30:44] forth the promises of God the violent
[1:30:47] the eager the determined will bring it
[1:30:50] to pass so we we're going to take
[1:30:52] possession we got to be willing to fight
[1:30:54] and you're going to be you're going to
[1:30:56] be uh you're going to be opposed Satan's
[1:31:00] going to come against you that's right
[1:31:01] Satan's going to come against your mind
[1:31:03] but you have to be determined when Hamas
[1:31:06] bombed Israel just about last month
[1:31:09] October 7th I believe it was they sent
[1:31:12] 2500 missiles into from God a strip into
[1:31:17] Israel they killed 2500 people they had
[1:31:21] several wanted hostages what did they do
[1:31:24] they took tanks and they they bore a
[1:31:25] hole through the fence there and through
[1:31:27] the through the wall there between Gaza
[1:31:29] and Israel and they they came through
[1:31:30] they had paragliders that flew in from
[1:31:32] the high side and came in and they begin
[1:31:34] to destroy man women child mother
[1:31:37] whatever grandmother grandparent old and
[1:31:39] young and like they
[1:31:42] destroyed so why are you saying that
[1:31:44] brother because Benjamin net and Yahoo
[1:31:46] began and he came on the press or on the
[1:31:48] the the news and he said he saids
[1:31:51] citizens of
[1:31:52] Israel we didn't start this
[1:31:56] fight but we will finish it that's right
[1:32:01] we didn't start this fight but we will
[1:32:04] finish it and I'm here to declare to you
[1:32:07] this fight that we're fighting it
[1:32:08] started in heaven when Lucifer decided
[1:32:10] he was going to he was going to try to
[1:32:12] set his kingdom up above the kingdom of
[1:32:14] God we didn't start this fight but God
[1:32:16] has got a People God has got an elect in
[1:32:19] this day and we will finish it Satan you
[1:32:22] done pick on the wrong one today you
[1:32:25] picked on more than you can handle
[1:32:26] because now we're contended for the
[1:32:28] faith we're contending for the word we
[1:32:31] will believe it if a prophet of God
[1:32:33] stood there for 30 years contending for
[1:32:35] the faith of that you contended for so
[1:32:38] with the bride of the end time contend
[1:32:40] for the same Faith contend for the same
[1:32:42] miraculous power contend for the same
[1:32:45] Supernatural contend for the same result
[1:32:48] that the days of Miracles it's not
[1:32:50] passed but to hear again church Bible
[1:32:52] days are here again God is still here
[1:32:55] moving in his body working through his
[1:33:01] body your Prophet contended that Jesus
[1:33:04] Christ was the same yesterday today and
[1:33:06] forever he contended against co- foral
[1:33:09] denominations that said God doesn't do
[1:33:11] it like he used to do it he contended
[1:33:13] against the Church of Christ spirit that
[1:33:15] said the days of Miracles has passed and
[1:33:18] if he contended shall we contend
[1:33:23] preachers today don't want you to
[1:33:25] contend for the supernatural they don't
[1:33:27] want you to be
[1:33:28] emotional they don't want you to believe
[1:33:30] they want you to just press play and
[1:33:34] Obey but notice let us be glad and
[1:33:36] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:33:39] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[1:33:42] wife has made herself
[1:33:44] ready and the M birth pains he said his
[1:33:47] wife has made herself ready at the End
[1:33:50] of the Age
[1:33:52] there's not another
[1:33:53] age you are it look
[1:33:58] around you've been waiting for it you're
[1:34:00] it yes you're the finality yeah but
[1:34:05] don't be so happy
[1:34:08] yeso come on I'm it if I knew I was it
[1:34:11] man I'm telling you what you are it
[1:34:15] we're not promis another age we're not
[1:34:17] promis another Messenger right here lays
[1:34:20] right now the voice to the final age it
[1:34:23] ain't raining out through heaven but
[1:34:25] it's raining here on Earth through Sons
[1:34:27] and Daughters of God you are the very
[1:34:29] climax of everything that Jesus was sent
[1:34:32] to do and you're sent to do the same
[1:34:34] thing church and we will finish
[1:34:36] everything that is Promised of a body
[1:34:39] that is Promised of a bride in this last
[1:34:41] day we will contend against unbelief we
[1:34:43] will contend against cancer we will
[1:34:45] contend against for our children we will
[1:34:48] contend and we will finish it
[1:34:59] let me just kind of wrap this up bring
[1:35:01] this all kind of home here I didn't say
[1:35:03] I was closing say I'm just going to try
[1:35:05] to bring it all home here he says the
[1:35:06] spirit that was in him he sent it back
[1:35:09] down to the church so the church when
[1:35:13] this Covenant is brought into full
[1:35:15] strength when the Covenant is confirmed
[1:35:18] with God the church the people that goes
[1:35:21] into this body here to be his bride will
[1:35:23] be exactly the same spirit that was upon
[1:35:27] Christ doing the same thing same
[1:35:30] Ministry same power it will come
[1:35:33] together and be word by word the same
[1:35:36] confirming the Covenant so you find men
[1:35:40] today they don't want you to testify of
[1:35:43] what God has done or what God has doing
[1:35:46] then I want you to give glory to God for
[1:35:48] maybe healing someone of cancer or what
[1:35:50] God has done the super Supernatural and
[1:35:52] things like that they said well that
[1:35:53] takes away from Brother brandham
[1:35:56] nonsense well that takes away from
[1:35:59] Christ
[1:36:00] nonsense see that's not taken away
[1:36:03] that's giving testimony that the same
[1:36:05] word that that Christ preached the same
[1:36:07] word that Paul preached the same word
[1:36:09] that William Brandon preached is the
[1:36:11] same word that we preach and it's
[1:36:13] bringing forth the same results am I
[1:36:15] telling you I'm telling you that we are
[1:36:17] proof of the of his victory we are proof
[1:36:20] today church that the same signs the
[1:36:22] same wonders the same word will produce
[1:36:24] the same results yes it's not something
[1:36:28] sit on the Shelf of yesterday and it
[1:36:30] doesn't have any power it doesn't have
[1:36:31] any Authority today it has as much power
[1:36:34] it has as much Authority today as it
[1:36:36] ever has because the word will never
[1:36:39] change we are proof that he hasn't
[1:36:42] changed brother says God cannot change
[1:36:45] he's
[1:36:47] unchangeable God times change people
[1:36:49] change God is infinite he cannot change
[1:36:52] he must remain the same yesterday today
[1:36:55] and forever he must always remain if we
[1:36:57] believe this to be the word of God we
[1:36:59] can put our confidence on anything that
[1:37:01] he said that's right so we are proof of
[1:37:04] his victory he said the church is his
[1:37:09] victory victory over sin victory over
[1:37:12] death victory over drinking victory over
[1:37:15] whatever it may be we are his victory
[1:37:18] when we see him coming down and living
[1:37:20] among the church that's his
[1:37:24] victory shows that he couldn't keep him
[1:37:27] in the grave and they can't keep us in
[1:37:29] the
[1:37:31] grave oh
[1:37:33] Hallelujah he said he took Christ which
[1:37:35] is a Seed of Abraham on Calvary to him
[1:37:37] apart he took the spirit off of him put
[1:37:39] him in his body in the grave and his
[1:37:40] soul in held raised him up on the third
[1:37:42] day raised up his body brought it into
[1:37:44] glory and there he sent the spirit back
[1:37:46] down and he kept the body on his right
[1:37:48] hand he said he sent the spirit back
[1:37:50] down to live in in the church to make
[1:37:52] the church just so much with the Life of
[1:37:55] Christ that in the Resurrection the two
[1:37:57] will come together the bride and the
[1:37:59] bridegroom the church in Christ will be
[1:38:01] exactly alike with the same kind of
[1:38:04] ministry the same kind of power the same
[1:38:08] kind of spirit he raised up the body of
[1:38:10] Jesus Christ and set it on the right
[1:38:12] hand and his right hand and he poured
[1:38:14] down the spirit upon the church on the
[1:38:16] day of Pentecost that's how God proved
[1:38:19] the Covenant yes
[1:38:23] so the Pentecostal experience today is
[1:38:25] God proven the Covenant with his
[1:38:29] people see it's his life being lived out
[1:38:34] it's his life manifesting and he says in
[1:38:37] Christ The Mystery of God revealed when
[1:38:38] the current is Flowing
[1:38:40] freely the word of God it expresses
[1:38:43] itself The Works that I do shall you do
[1:38:46] also and in the last days it shall come
[1:38:49] to pass behold I'll s s Elijah the
[1:38:52] prophet and he will turn the hearts of
[1:38:54] the children back to the faith of the
[1:38:57] fathers see it's not the heart of
[1:39:00] everybody but it's the heart of the
[1:39:02] children the heart of his children yes
[1:39:04] that's right he says now there would
[1:39:06] come time there would come a time forth
[1:39:09] when he could express himself in the
[1:39:11] fullness of his godhead the deity
[1:39:13] through his church to have
[1:39:15] preeminence in the church and that word
[1:39:17] preeminent means to have first place
[1:39:20] that means in his church he's first he's
[1:39:22] first in everything he's first in
[1:39:24] importance he's first in honor he's
[1:39:26] first in exaltation he has the premin in
[1:39:30] his
[1:39:31] church he says oh my what the anointed
[1:39:34] man but now the anointed people
[1:39:39] yes now the anointed people no longer in
[1:39:43] a one- man ministry that's right that's
[1:39:47] right oh now it's in a multi-member body
[1:39:52] now the anointed people he says anointed

[1:44:21] of the spirit of
[1:44:23] God signs following the believer yes not
[1:44:27] just in Elon Kentucky not in M Louisiana
[1:44:31] not just in our favorite preachers or
[1:44:33] the well-known preachers that we know
[1:44:35] but around the world signs are following
[1:44:38] the believer there's been a great out
[1:44:41] prodical are coming home yeah that's
[1:44:44] right sick are being healed hearts are
[1:44:47] being
[1:44:48] discerned just couple weeks ago my wife
[1:44:51] and I were in Belgium and I preached
[1:44:53] some message there on a Wednesday night
[1:44:56] and I you know to be honest sometimes
[1:44:58] you probably know when Lord BL something
[1:44:59] on your heart and you just fight it
[1:45:00] you're like Lord why do you want me to
[1:45:02] preach this why I preach the message on
[1:45:04] finding forgiveness in the midst of pain
[1:45:08] because sometimes we have to be able to
[1:45:09] look deep in our hearts and find
[1:45:10] forgiveness for those who's wounded us
[1:45:12] those who's hurt us those who said
[1:45:14] things are maybe about our family or
[1:45:15] about situations cuz things can be so
[1:45:18] tough but we have to be able to find
[1:45:19] forgiveness in the midst of pain and I
[1:45:22] spoke that I mean I wor all day like
[1:45:24] Lord this is not an Evangelistic type
[1:45:26] service this is kind of more lowkey this
[1:45:28] is not my
[1:45:31] style you know but you learn to listen
[1:45:34] to The
[1:45:35] Voice and yield to it and anyway I had a
[1:45:38] brother send me a text when we got home
[1:45:40] he sent me a message he goes I just
[1:45:41] wanted to let you know that God used you
[1:45:43] beyond you could ever imagine last
[1:45:45] Wednesday
[1:45:46] night he said this morning a brother in
[1:45:49] our church ask forgiv foress to the
[1:45:51] whole
[1:45:52] church he said the day before you preach
[1:45:55] he had a meeting with the pastor and
[1:45:57] today he testified and he said it seemed
[1:45:59] like brother Joe was in that meeting too
[1:46:02] he says how the scripture was repeated
[1:46:04] just exactly like it was the day before
[1:46:06] he said a lot of lives have been
[1:46:08] impacted what is that that's not Joe
[1:46:11] Adams but that's the great outpouring of
[1:46:14] the spirit of
[1:46:15] God did those pictures ever come through
[1:46:18] sister
[1:46:19] Donna they never came through that's
[1:46:21] okay I'm going to end right here with
[1:46:23] this many of you probably seen or heard
[1:46:25] the testimony of sister Atlanta
[1:46:29] buts sister lantabus is a precious
[1:46:31] friend of our family about when she was
[1:46:33] 39 she was diagnosed with stage four
[1:46:36] lomic cancer the entire right lung was
[1:46:39] covered in
[1:46:42] cancer her husband Brother David buts

[1:47:07] leaning I'm leaning leaning on the
[1:47:09] Everlasting Arms and just all of a
[1:47:11] sudden the Revelation struck her that he

[1:47:15] for he is in fact her healer and she got
[1:47:18] down from that Meine begin to dance all
