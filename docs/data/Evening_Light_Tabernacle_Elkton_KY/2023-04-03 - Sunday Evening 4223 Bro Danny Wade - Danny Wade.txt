with me if you will too first Peter 2 and verse 9. first Peter 2. we'll we'll begin with verse 9. say Amen when you got it but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness into his marvelous life hey man how many beliefs died amen and we'll turn to uh Ephesians 2 and verse 10. I got a few scriptures here so bear with me to Ephesians 2 in in verse 10. for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them laughs in Colossians 3 and verse 17. and whatsoever he'd do in word or deed do all things in the name of what Jesus Christ giving thanks to God and the father by him and and then I got one more uh First Corinthians 10 and verse 31. foreign eat or drink or what whatsoever you do do all for the glory of God amen may God ask blessing to read another word you can be seated now I would like to read what brother Branham said on this this is is it sums up the entire message that I'm preaching tonight I'm preaching on on this uh quote by brother Brandon it says God is not an idol God is a spirit and we we prostrate ourselves before that in the spirit don't don't come unto some Idol son as some so-called Christians would have us to believe but the spirit comes into you and you are God's house living oracles walking around not manifesting the Living God for God to Wells not in temples made with hands but a body has stopped preparing me see you are God's letter a written epistle God is in you manifesting himself through if you could prostrate your yourself before God and say God I'm a sinner come into me and then the Holy Spirit comes in and then you are a living representative of God did you catch it say that with me living representative of God walking around with God speaking through your lips to others let's take a look at what's the definition of Representative a person chosen or appointed to act or speak for another or others if if you could just grasp that for a second think of that God chose us and God chose you before the foundation of the world to represent him now I would I have a story I would like to read in um this is It's I don't think it's a true story but it's it's um it's a it's a story of what I'm trying to speak on tonight once upon a time there was a young woman named Rachel who was a devout Christian she believed in the power of prayer and had a deep desire to share the love of God with those around her one day Rachel was walking through a crowded Street in the city when she saw an older when an older man sitting on a bench looking lost and confused Rachel felt a nudge in in her heart and and she knew that God was calling her to speak to the man she she approached the man and greeted him warmly as they began to talk Rachel about the Holy Spirit speaking through her guiding her words giving her the right things to say the man shared and that he had recently lost his wife and was struggling to find meaning in life Rachel listened with compassion and then and then she she began to share the good news of Jesus Christ she spoke of God's love and grace and how he could he could give the man a comfort and peace that he was seeking as Rachel spoke the man's face lit up and he began to weep tears of joy he told her that her words had touched his heart and that he felt like God was speaking directly to him through her from that day forward Rachel knew that she was a living representative of God walking around with God speaking through her lips to others she felt a deep sense of purpose and joy and she shared the love of God with everyone she met over time Rachel became known in her committee as a woman of faith and many people came to her for guidance and prayer she she continued to allow God to speak through her and she saw many lives transformed by the power of his love Rachel's story is a powerful reminder that we are all living representatives of God and that he can use us to touch the heart of others when we allow the holy spirit to guide our words and actions we become vessels of God's love and grace and we can make a real difference in the lives of those around us amen amen some some of us think that it's only it's only preachers that God uses to speak through us but it you anyone can witness to those around you it just just as this woman had done and and you think that it's it's not just a preacher that God can use to speak to someone else God can use anyone uh even even a child God God can use don't don't limit God by saying only I'm not saying of course I'm not saying a woman can can preach In a Pulpit but I'm saying that that even and a woman can can speak a power p and speak love speak awake what God wants them to say to someone else to to show them and God's love and touch their hearts and and God can use them to do that just as this example I had shown you when we receive the Holy Spirit we become vessels for God's message walking around with God speaking through our lips to others with his great with with it this is a great privilege and responsibility and it is something that we should never take for granted and we see examples of this throughout the Bible in in the book of Acts we read about how the disciples receive the Holy Experience at Pentecost suddenly they were empowered to speak in different languages to proclaim the gospel message to people from all over the world they were no longer just ordinary men but living representatives of God filled with the power of the Holy Spirit and acts for me and we see Peter and John being brought before the religious leaders for for preaching about Jesus despite the threat of persecution they boldly proclaim the truth and the power of the Holy Spirit was with them they said for we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard after the the death and resurrections of Jesus disciples were filled with the Holy Ghost and began preaching the gospel with boldness and power Peter and John were two of the most prominent Apostles they had performed many signs and wonders in the name of Jesus in Acts 3 we read about um miraculous healing that took place though Peter and John they encountered a lame man who had been sitting at the temple gate for many years begging for alms Peter and John did not have any money to get a given but there's something much more powerful the name of Jesus Peter said to the man silver and gold hadn't done have I not but what I do have that I give you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth walk and the man was healed instantly walking leaping and praising in God amen if God doesn't show oh oh the the Lord Jesus Christ represented in and man I don't know what does the mirror the miraculous healing was a powerful death demonstration and the holy spirit's power and the work of the lives of Peter and John they were living representatives of God walking around with God speaking to the lips to others and and they were feeling they were filled with the Holy Spirit and as a result they were able to perform Miracles and share the gospel with boldness and Power my brothers and sisters we can we can too be filled with the Holy Spirit become living representatives of God we too can walk around with God not speaking through our lips to others but it requires a surrender of ourselves to God and a willingness to be filled with his spirit when we are filled with the Holy Spirit we become new creatures in Christ we are empowered to live a life of Holiness and obedience that we are able to share the love of Christ with others in powerful ways we become instruments of God's grace and mercy we are able to perform Miracles and signs that point to the glory of God so let us follow the example of Peter and John and be filled with the holy spirit let us surrender ourselves to God and allow him to use us as living representatives of his love and Power and let us boldly proclaim the gospel to a world that desperately needs to hear the message of Salvation and Hope Matthew 5 14 and into 16 says excuse me ye are the light of the world a city that is set on on a hill cannot be and be hit neither do men light a candle but put it and put it under a bus shell but on a Candlestick and it giveth light into unto all that are in the house let let uh let your light so shine before men that they may see good work your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen I I hear if if um so many people they say they look at at us Christians and they say they look at the whole Christian Church in general they're not denominations and so forth they look at us and they say well this isn't what Christ is like this isn't what Christ looks like they look at us and think what a bunch where's that apart from the rest of the Christian in the world but they look at them and say what a bunch of Hypocrites they say that they're they're following Christ but yet look at everything that they're doing I I heard a a um a uh an example that someone had had was talking about that that it's like going into the gym and and looking at all the overweight people all the people that this is a place of fitness and everyone's supposed to be super fit everyone's supposed to be all muscular and everything look at all these overweight people going in it's the same same thing they're a bunch of Hypocrites and then you look at they take you the same way with church they see a bunch of people that are coming to church that that are are so flawed they're so that are just completely different from the example of Christ and and our Hypocrites are in the church and they look at them and they say this isn't what what it's supposed to be and and there's there's certain people just like at the the gym that were that are that actually are fit that actually our arm our muscular and uh and and in church and Earth you also find in it the same the same way you find people that are standing on God's word that are aren't truly devout Christians and then you see the ones that are hypocrites that come in because that's how it is but it says here and ye are the light of the world as a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hit and and this is what brother panel is speaking and we tonight ought to be ashamed of ourselves and honestly and humble humbly confess our uh unbelief before God and ask him to forgive us of how we represent him in this life he's depending on us that's exactly what I would uh it goes along with with what I was saying we we're not perfect and you'll see flaws in each and every one of us none of us are actually going to be the full full uh perfect representation of Christ like we want to be like we desire to be but but still God has chosen us to be representatives of him in this life this is what it means to be a living representative God it means to be so filled with the holy spirit that you cannot help but speak about the things of God and it means being a vessel for God's message and allowing him to speak through you to others it's not it's not just about being perfect in the incumbent and so Godly that you never fall that you never make a mistake because we're human beings God made us to be human beings and we've Fallen we fail all the time but the difference between us and the people that the difference between us and and the Christians that fall by the wayside and and and give up is we keep on going we get back up again and we we say a devil you may have caused me to fall but I'm gonna bounce right back up again and that's what the devil hates to see because he wants to see you down he wants to see you thinking I made all these mistakes I made all the I've done all these things and and Satan and puts those things in your mind of the past and so forth bringing back over and over again you've done it yes you've done that look at you that's what Satan's job is the Bible says that that Satan's up there accusing us look at what they've done look at this look at that picking apart everything and they're not perfect they're not perfect representative you chose them to be a representative of you look at him look at at her there they they fed they fell the other day they they sin the other day and and then and she says I'll say I don't remember oh my God we might remember but Jesus doesn't remember because it started the blood and that's how we it must be striving every day today to be perfect and putting those things to this forgiving ourselves for the past mistakes that we've made that's the hardest thing to do as a Christian I'll tell you you because because those past things the the things that you've done will try to creep back up over and over again okay I'll keep on trying to come come back up again this past thing you've done because that's the devil's job the devil cannot the devil cannot destroy us the devil cannot uh blah our name out of the book of life you cannot do it and the the devil's job is it is not to get you you keep you from going to heaven but to discourage you but to to discourage you from sharing the gospel to discourage you from being a light in this world to discourage you from being represented for Christ to try to put you down to try to tell you your uh uh remind you of the mistakes you made and how that you'll never be become a perfect representative of Jesus Christ that's what the devil is trying to do that's his only time he cannot he cannot pluck you from his hand he cannot pluck you I used to think that that if I if I fell back and said that then my name would get blotted out of the The Book of Life and then I wouldn't want many more about that cannot happen even if I decided to walk out out of the door right now and then decide I ca I'm I can't do this anymore and give up and go out into the world God's Gonna reach down pull me back and say no you don't you're one of mine you can't do that because why God shows us before the foundation of the world God chose us to be representatives of him we're Sons and Daughters of God well when I see people that I know that that received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when I see people that I know were saved follow me and go on to the world I I believe and trust that God's gonna pull them back one of these days and I I know it's going to happen if there are chosen of God it's got to happen because because there's only two scenes to serpent seed and you're either God or you're not and and so if they're of God they're going to come back and and that's just being lost and one of God's sheep wandering off and and and getting lost somewhere but but that's when Jesus will go down and and find that lost sheep leave them 99 and go find out I won that's lost we also see see this in in the life of Paul in his letters to the Corinthians Paul writes about the power of the holy spirit in his own life he says my message and my preaching were not with with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of his spirit's power so that your faith might not not rest in human wisdom but on on on God's power Paul understood that it was not his own wisdom or Echo eloquence that made his message powerful it was the power of the Holy Spirit working through him when he preached the gospel people were not just hearing his words they were hearing God's words spoken through him and as a result many people came to it to Faith in Jesus Christ amen it takes God to speak through you to speak to other people not just you speaking that's what that's the way that people come to crisis God using you as a vessel to speak to those those in need of him in the in need of in need of Jesus Christ God will use you to bring them here or sometimes it it it takes you know it'll it'll be God's using you to speak to other one to encourage someone to to lift someone up but the the power of the holy spirit in Paul's life was not limited to his preaching the Holy Spirit also empowered him to live a life of faith and obedience to God despite the many challenges he faced including persecution imprisonment and even Shipwrecked Paul remains steadfast in his faith he knew that the Holy Spirit was with him guiding him and strengthening him every step of the way amen God is with you tonight saying speaking Inc through you God is speaking to you he's using you fill up with the Holy Ghost tonight God has been using you who left up to this point if you ever felt at some point that God has told you to speak to someone that God has told you to to do this or do that and you're filled with the Holy Ghost God has been using you've been speaking through you don't ever think it's just yourself that it's just you doing it because God is using us as representatives of him thank you in fact Paul were all writes that the Holy Spirit not only gave him strength but also gave him the words to pray when he did and did not know what what to say he says in the same way the spirit helps us in our weakness we do not know well what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself intercedes for us through through it says here enters his Forest through wordless groans so sometimes aims even and when you just just meditating on God and you're just praying in your mind God is as pouring ain't things into your mind to pray because God can even hear your thoughts so when you're praying to yourself and you're you're just thinking you're just praying and you just feel feel the Holy Spirit the presence of the Lord laughs that's the Lord speaking into you that's the Lord's air telling you what to pray what to speak what what to think the the the same holy spirit that worked through Paul is available to us today when we receive the Holy Spirit we too become living representatives of God become vessels through which God can speak to others and work through us to accomplish his purposes so let us open our hearts and Minds to the holy spirit let us invite him to work in through and through US empowering us to be faithful and obedient to God let us allow him to speak through us to others so that they too may come in faith in in Jesus Christ and let us trust that the the same Holy Spirit who worked through Paul is at work in us today guiding us and strengthening us every step of the way when we receive the Holy Spirit we are no longer living for ourselves but for Christ who lives in us we become living representatives of God with the power of the Holy Spirit within us let's never forget the privilege and responsibility that comes with the living representative of God let us be filled with all a experience said so that we can be vessels for God's message let us speak boldly and courageously about the things of God knowing that the power of the holy spirit is with us says this therefore I think even [Music] has failed to represent the real thing that Christ has set forth for us to represent the Holy Spirit and the life of the spirit see we represent sometimes Sensations and we represent Joy but in and that's good but there is there's more to it than that there is a fruit that goes with it that the hungry man is looking for aim for this fruit of the spirit and this is the quality that was in Jesus amen as Christians we believe that we are called to be the hands and feet of Jesus and to share his message of love and salvation with the world well the most powerful ways we can do this is by allowing God to speak through us to those around us when we speak words of encouragement Comfort or Our Truth we are not just speaking on our own behalf we are speaking on behalf of God he is using our voices to speak to the lives of others to offer them hope and healing and to draw them closer to him that is a purpose of our Our Lives is uh to allow ourselves to be vessels of him to allow him to speak through us and in us the the that's what we are called to do that is our calling if you're looking for foreign that's a good start right there uh just allow God to speak through you to others allow God to speak through you it's not it's not just me as a preacher that's the most challenging thing that ain't for me is allow God to speak through me and and what I'm doing and preaching the in this message is is difficult to uh to but all it takes is just yielding to the Holy Spirit just just saying just getting on your knees and saying Lord I yield myself to you I commit everything to you I Surrender everything to you use me as a vessel use me to speak through me Lord take thy mate help those around me that I may help those that work them and help those those my brothers and sisters that might help everyone one around me that you may use me in a powerful way doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter if you're a male female child it doesn't matter God is willing to use you in a powerful way I believe I spoke to me well well uh back and it was it's on my it's on my notes Here all right it is it's really such a powerful message it touched my heart I I didn't prepare for this but let me just find it here real quick it's yeah I I was just amazed when the Lord was just speaking this to me let's see here this song okay here it is God is ready to use you in a powerful way but you're not ready to be used in a powerful way that hit me that that I hit deep God is ready to use you in a powerful way but are you ready to be used in a powerful way are you ready to be used in a powerful way that's that's where that word surrender comes in again are are things things of Life coming in the way of God using you in that powerful way that that just hit me that this way this was This was um 11 to 20. this was last last year this was November of last year that that the Lord spoke to me telling me that I was I was at the gym as well I was just thinking about the Lord and the Lord or told me that God is ready to use you in a powerful way are you but you're not ready to be used in a powerful way and I realized at that time that that I wasn't because because at that time I I wasn't and it was but this wasn't very long ago but at the time I was in a place where where I was as kind of you know not like super on power on fire for God but it was it was I was really wanting the Lord to just use me in a powerful way and then and that spoke to me that spoke to me because it takes surrender to allow God to use you in a powerful way it takes surrendering and those thoughts that that kind of come by you to try to tell you the the most challenging thing for me Satan's doing and all he can he he was trying all he could to prevent me from speaking from preaching this message from preaching the last message the person that got attacked the most is a preacher remember that because he's the one that feeds it in the she that he's the one uh one that brings the word of God to the Sheep and so God's always trying to I mean right Satan rather is always trying to uh attack me try to tell me this trying to put things in my mind even when I'm up here preaching trying to distract me trying to if he can just get me off on what I'm trying to preach on and if he can just get me off on on fully surrounding myself and yielding myself to God then Satan will have uh one over on me and and he that's his job is to try to block me from being a perfect representative of Christ that's what he's trying to do to each and every one of us where God told you to to speak to that person when God told you to to spread the gospel Satan and put that thing in you and said ah you said that it's too scary it's too That's what Satan always tries to do he uses our own Common Sense against us because God does not go by our feelings or common sense God oh God often times make us go against our uh exactly he'll make us go against our own flesh you'll make us go against the very nature of the things that we want to do and Satan will use our own what we want against us well our flesh wants against us and tell us you don't need to do that you don't need to do that yeah I know you feel it's probably just yourself telling you that that you should do this it's probably just yourself telling you it's not and you know it's it it's a devil trying to put put that in in your mind to tell you that that's not God that's something else that that's just yourself I I believe when that happens and you're just thinking to yourself oh that was just me that's probably that's probably the devil telling you that there's probably the devil telling you that because why would you want to convince yourself that that wasn't God that was telling you that Moses was a man who was called by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt he was hesitant at first unsure of his ability to carry out such a great task but God reassured him saying in Exodus 4 12 . now go I I will help you and speak and will teach you what to say exactly it's excuse I'm not a good public speaker I can't hardly speak to we make excuses excuses but but when God chose you you're calling was without repentance Moses went before pharaoh and with God speaking through his lips he demanded the release of Israelites he performed miraculous signs and wonders demonstrating the power of God to the people of Egypt and Indian Israelites were set free and Moses was redeemed as one of the greatest leaders in history of God's people imagine I got called uh someone that was shy someone that that would that couldn't hardly speak the public speaking I just thinking that God called me to be a preacher and I I couldn't hardly see pray in the Sunday school class and never mind come up here and preach but Moses was not a great leader because of his own strength or ability he was a great leader because he allowed God to speak through him to to use him as a vessel for his message and his will and in the same way we too are called to be vessels of God's message and well and just thinking that put your your name in it in this book put your name in there but but Daniel was not not a great leader because of his own strength or ability Daniel was not a great preacher because of his own strength and ability but because of uh but he was a great a great preacher because he allowed God to speak through him he to use him as a vessel for his message and his will in the same way we two are called to be a vessels for God's Masters and will in second Corinthians 5 20 Paul writes now now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in other words as though God were making his appeal through us we and pour you on Christ's behalf be reconciled to God this process reminds us that we are chosen by God to represent him to the world and that we have been given the privilege of sharing this message of Salvation with others it's a privilege to share this this message of Salvation to others it's a privilege that God has given us and commanded us to to share this message with others and I believe it is our calling to share it with others because if we're not sharing this with others who else is God gonna use who else has gotten God gone into someone else will do it someone else will all do that someone else will preach this message somebody else well no no God has chosen us to do it no one else can do it but us we always make up excuses on why we don't want to do this we all want to do and do that for for God but but his his calling is without repentance as as we go through about our daily lives let us remember that we are walking around with God speaking through our lips to others let us be vessels for his message of love and grace and let us allow him to you and use us to teach the lives of those around us let us be like Moses trusting in God's strength and guidance and allowing him to work soon through us for his glory and his purposes now now I want to talk about this scripture in the Book of Judges we read about how Deborah served as a prophetess and judge over Israel she was a woman of great faith and wisdom and she she used her position of influence to lead the people of Israel back to God in judges four four to five it is we read and and Deborah A prophetess the wife of lapida she she judged Israel at that time and she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between irama and and Bethel in Mount Ephraim and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment Deborah was not only a spiritual leader but also a political one she provided wise counsel and guidance to the people and her words were seen as coming directly from God in in judges four four six to seven and we read the pronunciations there's a lot of words here that are hard to read and she sent and called Barack the son of uh out of Kardashian and naphtali and and said unto him hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded saying go and draw toward Mount Tabor and take with the ten thousand men of the children of naphthali and of the children of zebulun and I will draw unto thee to the river of kitchen to Sarah the captain of jaben's army with his chariots and his multitude and I will deliver him unto thine hand through her prophetic gift Deborah was able to discern God's Will and speak it to their people she was a living representative of God walking around with his messes on her lips her faithfulness and obedience inspired others to turn back to God and to follow his ways my brothers and sisters we too are called to be representatives of God to walk around with this message on our lips just and just as Deborah was faithful and obedient and so too must we and so too wasn't must we be we must seek God's Will and discern his voice so that we can share his message with others in second Corinthians 5 20 Paul writes not now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God we're pleading through us we implore you on Christ's behalf be reconciled to God and this passage reminds us that we have been chosen by God to be his ambassador to represent him in this world and to share his method message of love and salvation with others so my friends let us embrace our role as living Representatives with God let us seek his will discern his voice and fully Proclaim his message to the world may we be faithful and obedient like Deborah and may we live May Our Lives be a reflection of God's love and grace amen Deborah wasn't a perfect example of of someone who was surrendered to god a woman in the Bible a prophet test so uh so God can use even even though and though you know God can use a woman as a prophetess I I don't see anywhere where it says a woman can't be a prophetess in this last day not a preacher but but I believe me you might you can correct me if I'm wrong on that but but but I believe that that she was a perfect representation and of of God speaking and through someone speaking through a woman not just a man speaking through a woman a perfect representation of God that's what we're called to be in Acts six and seven we see an incredible example of this in the life of Stephen Stephen was a man full of faith in the Holy Spirit and he was chosen to serve as one of the seven deacons in the early church but he didn't just serve tables and take care of practical matters he also preached the gospel and perform miracles in the name of Jesus one day Stefan found himself standing before the Santa hadron accused of blasphemy but instead of cowering in fear stuff and boldly proclaim the truth about Jesus Christ and he spoke with such power and conviction that his accusers were enraged in Acts 7 and 54 there to 60 we read that as Stefan was being stoned to death he looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and then as he was dying he prayed for the persecutors saying Lord do not hold the sin against them amen if that isn't a perfect representative Lord Jesus Christ I don't know what what is Lord did not hold their sin against them just as Jesus said on the cross Lord I forgive them we are to we are to to take up our cross and follow Christ that is the definition of being representative of Jesus Christ picking up our cross and following him in his footsteps uh at some point in my my life I was praying Lord Lord help me to fall on you and fall in your footsteps and after a while I began to start thinking maybe after things start getting hard and I say and trials and thanks are coming in I started thinking now wait a minute what am I praying for I'm praying for that if I'm walking exactly in Jesus footsteps what did Jesus do he died on the cross didn't he he he suffered and he and and same as Peter same as all these Apostles follow in my footsteps and I'm thinking now wait a minute what am I asking for I started realizing without I'm I'm asking for trials I'm asking for God to test me I'm asking God uh to to purify me to to to walk in his footsteps and also walk in the suffering that he had suffered for us on and I started realizing now wait a minute that sounded a bit scary and then I kind of of uh laid back on on praying that because as I started realizing what I was asking for because I'm asking God uses his his strongest soldiers for the strongest battles he if God puts you on the front line it's because you're because you God knows you're strong enough to withstand the trials the tribulations that are coming your way and following Christ in his footsteps exactly in his footsteps a lot of us don't really want to do that once we realize exactly what comes with that not it's not just it's not just um I'm gonna have a a big house um a wife and family that that doesn't sound like what Jesus went through exactly in his footsteps is a bit different than what we're thinking and when I start realizing that I started thinking uh started praying Lord you let your will be done in my life not it's not exactly exactly in his footsteps exactly as he as he walked but we're called to be living representatives of him and walk in his footsteps and do it and do what he wants us to do it's not always exactly the same as someone else it's not always exactly the same as as what Jesus done dying on the cross and what what Peter done dying upside down on a cross and and the different Apostles that died and were crucified because of uh of this they were they were living represent representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ and that calling is the heart it's such a hard calling but yet it is our calling each and every one of us is to follow Christ fall in his footsteps then we got it easy we got it it's so good in this last day you know we got it so good and in America things are getting worse and worse but but we're still here aren't we we're still in church we're still you know going home and we're still uh we still got all the pleasures and things that that we have nowadays our phones our our TV our uh whatever we got it good and nice and while over in other countries just like what brother um what uh what your sweater says brother Tommy it says this message is illegal uh in how many countries 53 countries this message is illegal in 53 countries that's what is his father says it is and but it's still legal in this country we got so good but yet in in China what they'll do is they'll memorize entire screen their entire chapters in The Bible even some memorizing the entire Bible because why it's illegal in that country it's illegal to have this and we have it so nice but yet we can hardly remember a few few verses in this Bible never mind entire chapters and and following in Christ's footsteps and what they were called to do the apostles were called to do is they were called to to preach the gospel preach this gospel each and every one of them and and and they would had preached exactly what Jesus Christ preached exactly what he'd done and sure they would have they were persecuted just as he was and we will be persecuted there will come a time when when we will be right now we have it good and we must take advantage of this time and and instead of just let us laying back and relaxing and thinking oh everything's all nice wait till it gets bad wait till things say things start cracking down wait till that final squeeze happens just before the Rapture and takes place I believe that it's going to be it's going to get to the worst just as bad as it is and then the D3 countries just as illegal they'll hunt us down like dogs and and work hard to be living representatives of Christ and sometimes it takes it takes hard times it takes persecution to really drive us to our knees to is and to to make us to to follow in his footsteps because that's how it was back in that time God calls us to be living representatives of him not not living not necessarily living in in a life of luxury like and and not not living for for Christ it's good good to be blessed and God does blessing each and every one of us financially and so forth but they'll come a time when when and it'll be illegal and to spread this message and right now we we must take the advantage as we got to preach the message as much as we can because as the time is running out time is running out and it's dire it's it's necessary to do that that in in this day and God calls us to be living example what did Christ do in that time he pretty preached he preached he preached to them he called them to repent what did Peter do what he preached he was the living representative of Christ he preached and and was as in Acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what what are we to do well as as Christ didn't being living representative of God speaking to speak his his truth and love to those around you and to bring hope and healing to a hurting World let us be like Stefan filled with the holy Holy Spirit and boldness let us be faithful to our calling as ambassadors of Christ foreign God has always got this is what brother and preach this is a really powerful God has always got a People somewhere that he could point to and say that's it oh I want to be among that in that number I'm sure we all want to be there it's the desire of every heart we want to be among that number that God can say this is my people look at them they are an example of what I am they are reflecting my life in their in theirs they have surrendered their life and I'm reflecting my life through theirs what a beautiful thing how it must make God feel good to know that he has got somebody he can put his trust in hey man that's us this morning if that's not us we better get it we better make it right now God help me to not be so so afraid and say of what people think to and spreading his gospel I can't I can't preach this enough it's it's scary it's fearful but it doesn't really matter what people think of you does it really matter if you lose friends and because of this message does it really matter what people think of you if you if you if we're all guilty of this uh I'm I'm afraid of doing this or that because I'm scared of what they might think I I I and then we do things because because we're scared of of what they might think and what what my brother might think in in this that the other but in reality the only way thought that actually matters is what Jesus Christ thinks of us that's the eternal in the Eternal mind of Christ what does he think about us we are one of his we are Sons and Daughters of him I can't stress this enough God wants us to be living representatives of him we and we are living representatives of him and sometimes we we take that for granted and we we go on In Living for ourselves and doing what what our flesh wants to do and we put we put the Holy Ghost to the side and we say I'm gonna do this I'm going to do that and and I'm busy today and I and I don't got time for this and I don't got time for that yeah God called us to be representatives of him to walk in his footsteps to do what he wants us to do not necessarily exactly what he'd done as in dying on the cross or and being crucified like he was but if it comes down to that be willing to foreign to die for him well I I hear so many people say I'm willing and to die for for Christ I'm willing to um to but are you willing to live for him that that's what truly matters especially say since we don't necessarily have that hanging on the line in in this country in other countries they have that but in this country we don't have to deal with that and oh my please please stand musicians if you'll come living representatives of God that's that that's my message this evening if we can just be a living representative of God each and every one of us my brothers and sister just as God spoke through Moses Deborah and Stefan he can speak through you you are a living representative of God he can use your lips to speak into life to those around you but to do this you must be willing to yield to a spirit to listen to his voice and to speak the words he gives you so today I encourage you to be open to the leading of the Holy Spirit allow God to use your lips to speak his truth his love and his salvation to those around you remember that you are not speaking on your own behalf but on on behalf of the almighty God how did you do so may his grace and his power be upon you and now and always thank you you are a living representative of God a vessel through which he speaks and acts in this world your words and actions carry the power to bring light and hope to those around you so let God speak through your lips and let his love shine through your life amen let's pray Heavenly Father we we come before you today humbled the realization that we are the living representatives of you walking around with your voice speaking through our lips to others Lord we thank you for choosing us to be your ambassadors to carry your message of love and salvation to the world we asked that yeah you'll help us to always reflect your character and values and all that that we do to to

powerful ways and oh God if anybody's raised me with me raise your hand Lord help me to surrender myself to you to that you may use me that I may be used as a vessel that you'll speak through Me Lord
