an honesty Ministry appreciation amen the children can be dismissed for Sunday School and it will go in the Psalms we're still in Psalms 119 we're gonna be reading from verse 81. star in verse 81 and we'll read over to verse 96. my soul Finance for thy salvation but I hope in Thy Word though friend become like a bottle in the Smoke yet do I not forget thy statutes thank you proud have dig pits for me which are not after thy law they had almost consumed me upon Earth but I forsook not thy precepts forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven to continue this day according to thine ordinances for all or thy servants I will never forget thy precepts for with them thou has quickened me the wicked have waited for me to destroy me but I will consider thy testimonies I have seen an end of all priests friction but thy commandment is exceedingly Broad God bless you maybe see you brother Brian brothers and sisters one of those verses there his faithfulness is on to all generations and I'm sure we all believe that we're here this morning because of that if you would come with me to 2nd Thessalonians the third chapter I was meditating just thinking I was thinking there this morning I wrote down that I'm not to be funny brother Brian preached the message modern events made clear by prophecy and as we come to this uh day you know 2023 the 24th of September as I find my place here who would ever thought I just wrote a note to myself where in our country in our world that we're in we're in the midst of a new Pagan age that we live in this morning everything outside of this church this morning outside the Jesus Christ is a pagan age it's just the way it is I mean you tell your friends that you mingle with in the world but they're living in a pagan age they probably laugh at you but it's the truth and I was thinking this morning you know we we live in a country that's totally off the precepts that it was founded on and I was just thinking it's just a horrible place that we are but it's a blessed place too because as the world gets worse you know you get closer I mean it's not comforting the world that we're living it's such a pagan world that we're living I I wouldn't even talk about the things behind the pulpit that they do out there in the world today thinking that they're right and there's nothing wrong with it you know and 20 years ago or 15 years ago when they made homosexuality marriage legal you know that was a horrible thing back then for the world but look at what they're doing today it only gets worse it never gets better and I was thinking this morning I don't know if you all know but let me read the first finally brethrough and pray for us that the word of the Lord May 5 free course and be glorified even as it with you and we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faith and that's the age that we live in this morning this the last two chapters in first Thessalonians talk about the all the evil and Paul's age I know I say this a lot but it's true the very paganism that Paul was dealing with in Corinth and all the Greek states that he went to or whether it was in their states above Israel where I mean the things that they were doing then people out in the world are doing today they're I mean it's just a pagan age and he goes on to say here but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil so it's not us that keep ourselves from Evil it's your relationship with Jesus Christ this morning and applying the word of God on yourself and your family that'll you can't do it in yourself you have to have Christ or you'll not be able to resist this evil age without Christ you won't be able to put away the things of this world and he goes on to say we have confidence in the Lord touching you that you both do and will do the things which we command you and that fourth scripture there speaks Paul gave us Commandments Paul the truth and we have to fulfill the truth as he gives us we all have a message of the hour now I only know if I live up to it and only you know if you live up to it but you can't be deceived you know whether you're living up to it and again I just said it earlier you can't do it in yourself you can only do it through Jesus Christ this morning and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ and now we command you brethren in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you withdraw yourself from every brother that walketh just overly and not at the Traditions which received of us but you know you could isolate that scripture there and you go further down Paul was saying that you need to watch who you fellowship with you need to watch who you commune with but later on I mean down at the end of the job three he gives some guidance too for yourself to know how we ought to follow us for we behave not ourselves disorderly among you you know it's totally opposite today than in the age that we're living you know Paul didn't owe no one anything after the flesh but the world we live in is looking for someone to provide for him without them working this morning but he goes on to say here Dean did we eat any man's bread for not brought with labor and Terrell night and day that we not might not be chargeable to any of you that's contrary to the welfare state that we live in this morning not because we have not power to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us or even when we were with you this we commanded to you that if any would not work neither should he uh for we hear that there are some I'm walking among you disorderly working not at all but are busy buddies that's the world we live in this morning everyone's trying to sell someone else how to live but they don't want to live the way they're telling people how to live now then then we shall excuse my pronunciation now then them that are such we command the exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that which quietness they work and eat with their own bread but you Brethren be not worrying well going and that scripture means a lot to me no matter how much you help people how much you try to encourage people how much you try to live for your brothers and sisters you can't let their bad behavior affect your relationship with Jesus Christ your enemies don't sell purpose this morning is to make you look at other people and see their faults so you can justify your own bad behavior everything that's exactly what he's trying to do he's you can only be responsible for yourself you know when you're doing wrong when you're doing right and you're only responsible for your actions but it doesn't mean because people are biting the hand that feeds them that you don't keep doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do and I lost my place but be not weary and well doing I almost I don't know why I just bit my tongue If any man obey not your words by this epistle know that man and have no company with them that he may be ashamed you know a lot of men tonight and honest churches use that scripture this morning yet account him as not an enemy but admonish him as a brother and then you cannot like I said you can take a word of God and isolate it and and make something out of it that it's not saying it as a brother now the Lord of Peace himself give you peace Always by all means the Lord be with you the salutation of all with my own hand which is spoken to every epistle so I write and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen and I I was just thinking this morning I don't the government we live in this morning is not a government that really likes people that are True Believers and true Christians this morning because the government we have this morning there's things that that you and I know that if you work I don't I'm self-employed so I can believe the things I want to believe and say the things I want to say and people can choose whether to use me or not to use me that's their right as a as an American but if if you're a person working for a company that's got a thousand employees you know where I'm going there's things you can and cannot say on the job this morning in the United States of America and have a job tomorrow you all know that you have to be careful about what you say but I was just thinking it didn't take too long for us to get here it's only been 10 or 15 years where we've got to where we're at this morning so it just lets me know as a Christian this morning you know people say there's a lot I I I'm 64 years old I heard people when I was in my 20s saying the Lord is coming he'll be here tomorrow does it does it mean that we don't live that way of course not we live each day knowing that the law could be here tomorrow but you realize that as you get to my age you realize the things that I thought were important when I was in the my 20s are not so important now that I'm in my 60s everyone has a life Journey they've taken but the only thing that matters as I got older I realized is my relationship of Jesus Christ this morning and the world that we live in this morning it's sole purpose this morning is to fill your mind and life with everything that takes you off of the word of God this morning and I can only speak for myself I I'll I'll admit myself no one was around me on Friday and I was working at this egg house and and you know if you're not careful you'll find yourself getting angry get mad for I I only can speak for myself getting mad for no reason at all and I go and he went back to my mind went back to Proverbs where it says if two walk together there's Comfort there's Security in that because if one falls into the ditch who's going to lift him up and I was thinking you know a second set of hands would be nice with what I'm doing this morning and it's everything in life we need to have a better perspective and I you know I lost my temper and I shouldn't lose my temper like I said before when you're yelling at a piece of Steel it isn't going to help you to yell at a piece of steel or get angry at a piece of Steel because it ain't going to help you but it what will help you is if you just stay quiet in your spirit and let God help you this morning and I find myself as I get older I realize I need to take that extra minute that extra second or that extra hour to think about something before I do it because that you'll find yourself doing things and saying things that you shouldn't say and as you get to the age that we're in this morning it's important that the only thing that we want to project the people out in the world is what Christ is to us what they see his experience in our hearts and lives this morning brother Dave thank you amen he loved the Lord this morning you love him this morning amen you know I was thinking of brother Brian honest confession is good for the soul and I work for myself and one day I fired myself three times I got so frustrated with this guy but you know what there's one thing I learned a few years ago that if I just sit down and I'd say Lord I need you right now and I begin to learn it took me a while believe me a long time as I began to learn to just stop just sit down and just pray I said Lord I need you I know I'm in a hurry and I need to get this done but Lord I Need You Now because I don't I don't want someone to see me acting that way even though it's just me and that car that's being stubborn but I want I want the Lord Jesus to be happy with me I wanted to be pleased with me this morning don't you and we send that little course pleasing to you let me be pleasing to you in everything we do that's our hearts to die this morning amen let's sing let's stay in the center of course I Love You Lord and I lift my voice

trips to Arkansas and the first time I went to my daughters and and my son-in-law he's they go to a a big church and and he asked me if we'd been washing my Tahoe and I had a picture of the cloud on the back of my Tahoe and my son-in-law asked me he said dad what is that and I told him what had happened and explained to him what it was and he said who's that picture up there in y'all's church I said that's brother Branham in the pillar of Fire now we're getting to explain to him and I said you know when I went to you with you that night when we were on vacation I went to your men's meeting

he said so that's why there are so many denominations I said I said yes and so we go to church and I said that's why God had to send a prophet and I've been to this church two or three times and the first time I went there I watched Frozen and I wasn't very impressed and Janet asked me they came into church drinking coffee with their hats on and shorts and all kind of nonsense and I thought she said you think we'll get a crime this morning and tears was coming down her eyes and I said babe I don't know I said but we're gonna brother Brandon said if you go just get all you can get and they had a different preacher up there that morning he wasn't the cool preacher that always preaches and this other guy comes out and they got this big screen and it pops up and guess what it says Jonah I

tell if Nineveh didn't repent what was going to happen then and I've been there many times and they've never even said the first word about doing anything wrong this guy got down and stepped on everybody's toes and I said Lord told Jan I said we got a good loaf this morning because that same kind of witness to my son-in-law about the message and what God's done in this generation and then we go to his church and then his preacher talks about God sending the prophet and I and I said I'm trying to encourage you to listen to some of the tapes and just pray for Tim and he never knew nothing

more today than we ever have we look at all the things that he's done for us but I've been under the weather all week and coughing and can't talk and I said God I've got to preach Sunday and I feel better this morning it's the little things it's the big things it's all the things that he does for us and sometimes I I speak for me but I don't think I give him enough praise I don't think I thank him enough I don't think I get alone enough sometimes and just say God I appreciate what you've done for me I thank you for what you've done for me I appreciate you coming into my life I appreciate you choosing me I appreciate you showing me the word for my day I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to witness and to testify to others I appreciate all that you do for me Lord amen amen praise God Amen thank Jesus to get your Bibles we'll go to John chapter three this morning appreciate the musicians the song service all the parts of the service amen God is truly good to us and y'all pray for me and we'll get through it this morning and we'll just turn it over to him and let him have control this morning and I'm still classified myself as a young man but I've come to figure out that I can't do it without him I sit back there in the back room and I just sit back there and pray and said God it's your time now and it isn't my time this is just a vessel that you've chosen it's your time now John chapter 3 I believe I preached a part of this uh probably back first of the year I want to try to continue on maybe you a little bit but conditions of Fellowship one will be part two this morning but in John chapter 3 verse 17 right after for God so loved the word again he's only begotten son then Jesus goes on and he says for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but through the world that he might be saved that they might be saved he didn't believeth in him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God and this is the condemnation that the light has come into the world and the men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil and for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light and neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light and his deeds may be made manifest that they are walked in God and I thought of that this morning as brother Brian was portraying would lay upon his heart and the evil age that we live in as we know brother Brennan would call it Satan's Eden as Satan is in control of it and they have denied the light for their day they have denied the word for their day and they've looked into the Antichrist they've looked under the corruption they've looked into all the world but but God said there's a group of people and that group of people is looking at the light and they're looking at the word and in the ten virgins in 1960 we existing we can have our seats but he says for the word of God is sharper or more powerful than any two-edged sword cutting even to asunder the bone and the desert of the thoughts of the intents of the mind he says oh there you are there you are he says when you see the light walk in it he said walk he says you don't know where you're going but keep walking walking towards Calvary looks at he's keeping a sensible look at Calvary walking walking he said oh God May someday the church which is the type of Enoch 500 years he walked before God walking Walking In The Light what a testimony that he had everything that God had said everything that he had did he didn't displease them and when the Lord said and they not had done it he said now he was a type of member of the Ark is a type of the Jews the 144 000 that carried over which is Noah and his much but Enoch went home just a little bit before the flood come on church he says you know that he said so he not just kept walking in the light and so one day he felt his feet getting off the ground and he just kept walking and he walked into the glory without even dying that's right God took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony that he had walked in the light of God just keep walking this morning amen Heavenly Father Lord we love you this morning Lord Lord we truly appreciate you Lord when we don't have words to explain what you mean to us and what you've done for us but Lord we love you with everything that we are and we ask you Lord to come on the scene this morning Lord we ask you to move man aside to myself aside the hearing side and you step into our presence Lord and you speak from your lips and let us hear with your ears that we may be drawn closer to you in the day that we're living Lord we love you Lord we thank you for all these things in your lovely name the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen and you can be seated this morning and I appreciate whether Tom inviting us out it's uh it's uh truly we say it and we say it again but it's a home away from home we always love being up here and getting to know each and every one of you much more than we have and we make friendships and we make fellowship and one day we won't have to depart one day we're going to go home and we're going to celebrate for eternity and we won't have to get up Monday morning and go to work and we won't have to pay the bills and we won't have to worry about all that because God will be there forever with us and this morning is returned us the part two maybe of this condition is a fellowship of walking in the light and and I begin to you know look at it I begin to think in a in a dying generation in a dying world that's what's missing in our lives anymore is no one wants to stay concentrated to the word of God and everybody wants their own interpretation and everybody wants their own idea and everybody wants the new thing to come along everybody wants a new anointing the new spirit the new the new precious come along but we realize there's nothing new in the word of God the word of God is the same as it was before the foundation of the world to today to the end it's the same word that is guiding us here that it's going to guide us home and and when we're looking for a place that we can refuge in the word of God and the only way to do that is in the light of your day it is in the light of your day in the fellowship of your day it doesn't do any good to do what the old churches did it doesn't do any good to go build an ark that Noah would build that's looking in the word and looking in the light of your day that today's messenger brought us a word that there's a Rapture that is coming for a bride and to prepare for that Rapture is to get yourself ready and dress yourself with the word of God and and it's so easy in our times this we would listen to The Prophet preach time and time again that we would look that the world wants us to take a step back come on the world wants us to take a step back and start okaying everything that we've already shown that is wrong and we know the scripts you would say as a dog would be turned to his moment this nation as a dog has returned to her vomit she come out of that she come out of British school she come out of all of the organizers that britons had and raised upon the freedom of religion started a country but now she's going back to that to dictating what the people can do and what they can't do and this isn't political but this is a religious move in the country that is taking the rights of Christians away she has a dog that has returned back to her Obama and the enemy is trying to get you to do the same thing you realize through influence we're living in the day of influence we're living in the day of influences that and through influence they get you to do what they want you to do you realize people making millions of dollars influence you and what decisions to make they actually just call them influencers and that's all they do is kicked our videos and Facebook videos and Instagram videos to influence you to eat a certain food one of them the other day I saw she was getting paid one point something million dollars to eat a Burger King sandwich on camera come on Church they're trying to influence you but it's the evil one it's the anointing of this age it's Satan's eating trying to get you to walk outside the light of your day it's trying to get you it's not happy with a bride that is moving forward in the word of God it's not happy the enemy's not happy with you coming to church every time the church doors are open come on Judge he's not happy with you coming to church every time them doors are open they want to give you every excuse you have to miss church come on Judge come on I know this is going to be real this morning but y'all bear with me the enemy is attacking each and every one of us he said he's attacking us with their fellowship with one another come on Church come on look I know the scripture tells you to be aware of who you fellowship with brother Brian told us that this morning was looking in the scripture that's the scripture but yet our Prophet would also come and say there's a balance to that that if you draw yourself out of my circle I want to draw my circle Banger come on church we got people that believes the message of the Earth with churches five miles down the road that won't fellowship with one another look they could get off of their doctors I don't have to agree with all of the doctor that we need to be able to walk in the light of her day look I'll just tell you this is a as I come across this this week sometime in the church it's preaching in the message of course but the church ain't but written out and he makes these words he says God's love he says he's put you on God's love he states that the love of God has to have a family that he could share it with but what I'm saying is the love of God God wanted somebody to share that love with he wanted somebody to share that fellowship with he wanted somebody to share that Union with that he could be happy that he can Rejoice with that he can have Victory men that he can go over there have fish with and he says even though he said love corrects and chastens but it always gives Fellowship a communion come on Church come on think of your home is your as you adult your parents you've raised your children there's times that your children's does wrong that your kids didn't grow and you have to collect them either by punishment either by discipline even my whooping maybe but yet love is still there to bring them back to the supper table and say but you're my son you're my daughter love is still fair to fellowship and walk in the light that even though I had to correct you even though I had to tell you that you was wrong I'm not pushing you out I'm bringing you back to where you can see the word for your day come on church if every time I got a whooping on my parents today to push me out I'd have been a bastard son living on the streets but yet every time that I got a whooping my daddy would grab me in his arms and he would tell me how much he loved me how much he cared for me oh heavenly father that's how he does you in high today even though we missed step and get out of place get out of line with the word of God God always brings us back to his wisdom he says but I love you son but I love you daughter and if he's doing that for me shouldn't we do it to others come on Church oh look a place of Fellowship to put our difference in the side to say you know what there's one true God look it's men's interpretation it means the termination that brought all the denominations upon her look we're just going to get ahead of myself a little bit but let's just move on in John 8 verse 12. he said this fake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life in John chapter 12 verse 35 it says that Jesus said unto them yet there's a light with you and while he says wow he'd have light let Darkness come upon you that he walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goes he said oh wow ye have light believe in that light that ye may be the children of light and these things speak to Jesus and departed and hid himself from them look first one and seven he says now he said there was from the beginning that when he had heard and what he had seen with our eyes that we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life so the light was manifested come Church there it is it's Walking In The Fellowship of the light of your day it's in the manifestation of the light of your day it's when Jesus come upon the Earth and Jesus would walk to and through welcome to see it golly they didn't understand who he was but he would point back to word and he says look if you don't believe me believe for the works that I do because the work's true who I am genital God that's what we're living today is in the manifestation of the voice of the seventh angel we're not living in a day that he was alive we're not living in the day that the ministry was going forward we're not living in the day that other brother said is good enough but we're living in the day of the manifestation of what that Prophet said that Prophet said there would be a pride that Prophet said that would be you and I that said that we would go into a Rapture we're living in that day now who are living in the manifestation time we're living in the fellowship of walking in the lifetime of not just seeing the word of God not just being able to read the word of God look technology has got it to the place that we have it on every device that we have I can look at my watch and I can read it quote I can look at my phone my iPad every document out there every time I can have it all accessible but has it become real to me has it become a manifestation to the world around me that it's more than just a written word Malachi four five and sixes John oh John and knock out three but 24 John four check back and forth it's whatever brother randoms quote whatever his scripture was for him to come and turn the hearts back to the fathers look that's already been fulfilled we're not living in the day of Malachi 4 we're living in the day of the Bride that the bride is living amongst us today that she's walking in the light of her name what is it is for the light that he was manifested for we have seated and bear witness to show you eternal life which was a father it was manifested in us for which we have seen and heard we declare that you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with the son Jesus Christ and these things ain't right into you that your joy may be for church y'all know I'm simple but I don't understand why message Believers are sad come on Church come on church we need to run an enemy away from us we need to run the enemy of depression away from us it's real I'm not trying to throw off on it it's a real enemy but we need to run the depression away we need to run the enemy of anxiety away we need to run the enemy of bad attitudes away why because we realize who we are we're manifesting the word of God we're going into our passion we have everything promise to us there's nothing to fear there's nothing fears of the devil fear is trying to keep you from getting what is rightfully yours God has already given it his word is already pronounced it to you he's already told you in this day these signs when we manifested he said in this day even greater signs of the days that I would nobody do what that is your day that is the day that we're living in it is the condition of who we're living now it's to get behind the word of God it's I want to manifest that word I want to manifest the word through my day I want to be an example for the word for my day I want to be a leader for you Lord I want to be a general I want to be a soldier I want to be whatever you want me to be God he said oh and he said these things right unto you that your joy before see there's something about having friendship that makes you happy Come On Church come on you know I've been blessed and had a lot of good friends over my life and there's something about getting around good friends it puts a smile on your face come on Church you know I'm right you get around a good friend you can't wait to see him again he can't wait to get on the ball court and play ball with him again you can't wait to go hunting with them again you think right just sit there and watch your ball again whatever it is that you do there's something in you Desiring that fellowship and that friendship and you'll want to grow so that friendship goes the harder it is to leave that person if you don't visit and we wouldn't visit some friends a few weeks back and and when it got time to go home it gets quiet and bummer because you don't want to leave you just create a pond there that you want to be the dear God I want to create that bond with my heavenly father I want to create that body that I never want to leave this place that I never want to leave working for him that I would rather be Sunday in church than it work any day in the than doing something for me I'd rather be moving for him than doing something for somebody else I want to create that Fellowship and that friendship and you know what when you create it you're happy in doing it say for too many years too many people said on message views and they did it they did it in denial they did it just because mama said her daddy said come on Church they come to churches because the daddy was the pastor come on or the mama was the other Mama sung in the church choir or the day was taken or whatever it was and they come to church to make a good look but there was nothing nothing inside that it created fellowship with God and you could tell because you know as they come of age you could tell their actions and their conduct changed of who they was they wasn't that same happy person that was always sad there was always mad they was always upset but yet if they could get a fellowship with God like their parents did it changes the Outlook of the outside and you can tell something's changed he said and these things aren't in you that you're doing amazing for he said and then this is the message which we have heard of him and declaring to you that God is light and in him there's no Darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walking Darkness we lie and we do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he isn't alive we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us Trump oh come on Church so there's so many wonderful things about giving our lives to God there's so many things that we need to praise him more for no church it's the little things that we Overlook in light in this Fellowship in this walk with God that we're so blessed about you know I told somebody the other day they was talking to me and they said you know you know you don't never seem to have car trouble well that's not always true I do but you know what if I have car trouble it's not the end of the life I thought the end of the day because I know my God is greater than my car don't judge I went to Indiana a couple months ago and we stopped to get something to eat and got back in the car and it was completely dead battery go the plane it's a seven eight Euro battery it did it's time but it wouldn't even turn the dash lights on if you know anything about cars just leaking is all electronic so you can put a car in and keep trying you push the button and wait for it it wouldn't do nothing I walked into KFC that's where we got through eating and I walked up into KFC and I look around there's two people in there eating and they're mid bite it in my mind the first thing I thought is the worst thing I hate being bothered is when I'm eating I got the truck open I got the hood open cable's out I just need somebody to let me borrow the car but I feel bad about asking these people that are eating and as soon as I heard that thought I'd heard that little still Small Voice why are you asking them for help when you have me oh God forgive me God forgive me I turn and walk back out and I walked out to the car and I laid the hand on the battery and I said Lord if you let it crank one time I'll stop at the next Parts come and put a battery in I got in hit the button it fired out to Life come on Church my God is greater than my car now I will tell you the next part store I saw I pulled in because I believe sometimes if we had specific things we better watch what we asked for but I pulled into the parts store and I turn it off and it wouldn't turn the dome light on completely dead I put a battery in it we made it to church God moved in a miraculous way it doesn't matter when you're walking in the Fellowship of the lord we shouldn't let these things change our attitudes come on Church we're going a little different direction somebody's pulling come on we shouldn't let circumstances in life we can let sicknesses in life we shouldn't set car trouble house trouble if I'm in trouble we shouldn't let that change who we are because we're Sons and Daughters of God fellowshipping with the Eternal one tele-shipping with that promise of a Rapture that is coming in our life it's greater than anything that can happen here it's greater than any circumstance here it's greater than any trial it's greater than anything that can happen to us here has more plans than we can see come on Church Our God has more ability for us than we're willing to accept you know so many times we don't get what we have need of because we don't want to bother God wants to be bothered by you because it ain't a bother to him God cares for you God loves you God wants your fellowship God loves you so much he left his son on the cross so that you could be saved and you could be in each Fellowship all he's asking for all these things hiring it's you to turn to him it's like can I have some fellowship can I have a word today can I look look I'm not super spiritual just as human as human can be but I find myself asking more and more under my breath oh God help me come on Church oh God help me I said in an interview the other day at my job interviewing a guy for a pet for a mechanic position and I was on the fence of which way to go and under my breath I said God help me help me to say the right thing help me to ask the right thing help me to make the right decision because I can't do it without you and God you've done proven to me that's right here and you're waiting on me to fellowship with you you're reading your way to step into the light of your day to the light of your word and ask you to come into my presence ask you but we're living in a day now that everybody wants to turn around what is God there could only be more hypocrisy today than we ever have we're living in more a worldliness than we've ever had we're living in that Center of Satan's hidden but yet God has a bride and he has a bride that is choosing to walk in his life remember when brother Branham he threw the 70s he drew the seven churches up here and he began to fill them in and then this one is all dark you know they ought to see it and brother Brennan would make the statement when the Angels showed him it was some blacked out and there was no in this day he said but I left a little bit in there for the bride's sake I left a little bit in there for your sake why because as long as you're here the holy spirit is still here but we're living in Satan's Egypt where everybody has chosen to follow Darkness instead of falling to light everybody has chosen to follow the Antichrist to follow the world to follow men's ideals and men's Creed other than just follow the anointing of the Holy Spirit come on Church how did the day of Pentecost happen because men got together in fellowship and said but Jesus said this would happen we're going to go pray until it happens we're not worried about what the world says about it we're not worried about what the critics call us we're not worried about what denominations in churches around the land we heard what Jesus said and Jesus said I'm gonna leave but I will not leave the comforters I will send the Holy Spirit back to you and they said we're going to get it and they come together in fellowship and they begin to believe upon one Accord that the spirit of Christ the spirit of God would come back and what did it do it manifested exactly what the word City would do it come forth in power and demonstration in the form of the Holy Spirit holding in the upper room and anointed them in such a way they knew there was something different about them come on children what about you and I for living in a day that is darked out or living in L.A that there's no light left will it be in the lane that you know what it stand for what's right you're going to be condemned you're gonna be hated you stand against homosexuality you're going to have your name plotted out come on Church you stand for the truth of the word you're going to be criticized you're going to be bullied you're going to be pushed aside but yet God is looking very bad let's willing to forsake everything that they have and say I'll follow that word I'll follow what you have for me 1964 moving on 1964 recognizing your day in this message he said as the prophets Abode we're set to vindicate the promise word for that day so that the people protested it in the day they saw it he said don't like the woman of the world what did she saw let's remember what another we know scripture we know the stories she's at the well when Jesus walks in a presence they begin to have a conversation Jesus begins to tell if you knew who I was you now you wouldn't ask because I give you water come on what did he say she says I heard of these things come on he had heard the prophecy being spoken she had heard that there was a messiah coming but now she was living in the light of her day she was living in the fellowship of her faith and now she was recognizing this is that Prophet being fulfilled and it is it me come on church it's going to take a place that the pride Universal around the world her eyes are going to come open and she's going to see there's more to this than a man by the name of William random that part of this than the message him in her but there's a pride that's upon the sea that is manifesting what he said it's going to happen he was the word and the production he says oh he says if I do the works of that father I promise I would do he said then believe me not but if I do the works too don't he said that to you don't believe me believe them Works he said oh they tell you who I am he said you get it all right don't miss the day he said men and women and other days recognize it and they went in and they were saved see she recognized that the well Delight for her day she stood there that day and she had the opportunity to either recognize the light standing amongst her or deny it and walk back into darkness she was standing at a place in her life that it was now for her to decide do I follow the light or do I turn back to the darkness don't judge you know the five you've had huh the one you're living with is not yours huh she's living in a day she's living in utter Darkness her life is in ruins every decision she's made has turned out bad but now she's sticking in the light of her name and she has a choice of what's the future of her life is going to be and what did it find she runs back to the city and said let me tell you about a man come on church she recognized the light for her day she manifested what that light would say to her and she became an example for others to come to Christ come on Church the Bible can't contain all of the Miracles that was written just because it wasn't written don't mean it didn't happen come on George look her life persuaded others to look to the light and then they had a decision to follow the light of Follow The Darkness but as children of God you're going to follow the light he said oh he says oh Pentecostals he says Oh my he says why don't you recognize your day come on Church he said better gosters he said recognize the day of the evening time it is here it is here but to vindicate the coming of Christ to vindicate it for in the end recognize your day come on church we need to recognize our day our day is more than the days another seventh Prophet Came Upon the scene but the day that we're living in is the day the pride and manifesting the world that there is a living God and it's not living in a prophet of old it's not living in Jesus of Hope but it's living in a bride today walking amongst the world is now living in you and it's interesting to the world who God really is it's more than just a story bone Church it's more than just a good story it's more than just a feeling look I ain't got nothing wrong with feelings we live in this flesh we need feelings we wake up in the morning we need feelings for our life sometimes it's good to have a little pain to make sure you're not bad come on Trish we need families but it's more than feelings feelings feel good and get us in the direction but it's more than a good time come on Church say here's where I get in trouble people always condemn me and tell me that I don't like youth meetings because I always are bashing them I'm not bashing you Finnish but come on Church you need more than just a youth meeting experience you need a backside of the desert experience come on Church what's the problem with most of our youth today is all they have is a youth meeting experience look there's nothing wrong with you maybe I take my kids there I take the youth there I help with them on I am all about getting them where the anointing is to get them to the light of their day but once they get to that life they've got to make a decision what they're going I'm Gonna Do With It come on Church the woman at the well she stood there and talked to Jesus the light of her day she stood there and agreed they got you're right you are that one and she was in a careers she was in Revival she was in testimony she was in rejoicing in his presence but when she turned and went back to the town then that's when trial come come on church that's when she had to make the decision am I still going to worship or am I going back to the way I was come on Church come on You See It come on Judge that's what we have to make a decision when we go to a meeting when we go to a youth and we get in the worship service and it's wonderful but you can't come sit on this view like it never happened come on if God did something for you we need to be able to worship Our God even throw our answer and say God I'm the same here that I was there you're the same one they saved me from that you're the one that's leading me from here you the people operate the gift come on Church come on Church so if you've been in Revival Services there's no reason that you should ever be in another dead come on Church because you operated that gift that was that Revival come on Church oh Lord help us look Church we're living in a day that you are the mouthpiece of God look we still need Ministries I'm going to preach against ministers you're not going to catch because the word of God said there's a powerful Ministry come on church but we're living in the day that you're the mouthpiece of God laity mouth face it's a bride mouth face she's the one look there's people don't see that I'll never see that brother better never see that brother Thomas will never see come on there's people that you'll witness to that we would have never had the opportunity it needs you God needs you to walk in his life to walk in his Fellowship to Worship in his word that when things go wrong it attracts a different attention to you we already knew guys started Monday I started training him Tuesday and Wednesday my boss come in ask Steve said how are you doing he said oh it's a lovely day and my boss makes the comment oh God I get enough of that from Jonathan well don't let me train him if you want him to be different because I'm going to tell it every day is a good day come on church every day that I live in is a day that my Lord has created and it is a day for me to worship Him look I'm not saying I'm perfect and I never have a bad day don't get in your minds but I tried my best to look at it every situation in life and say God what would you have me to do God you want me to get my knees I'll get on my knees God you want me to fall before the people to show them that I'm human I'll fall before the people you know for years I struggled when brother brother makes to come he says he said I love God so much that if he put me in hell I'd love him anyway I struggled with that for years but as years went by God began to reveal more and more to me I understand what he's saying because I'm in love with him so much there's nothing he can put me in that would create me not to love him even more now when a joke could sit on the Ashy and lose everything that he had and said but I love you Lord you're more to me than my family you're more than me than my goods you're more than me than my reputation you're more to me than my life God you mean more to me Hawking and the fellowship of his life he says oh he says kept you a long time it's 12 o'clock he said see where everything is at he said Israel where the church is where the immorality is where the bride is standing he said what's left he said that's the next thing is taking up of the Bride of course every church is looking for a great thing but that next step is the bride going into a Rapture as the world is looking to their men to their doctors the society look come on Church y'all pulling so I'm just following the leadership of God come on everybody wants to get down and tell you how to live a better life when God's already told you how to live a better life come on church I'm going to get enough help I'm not against our God Anonymous I'm not against these things I'm sure they've helped many people but it's a children of God we have a word that is written to us that is greater than any men's psychology can give us come on you get borned again you'll get rid of alcohol you'll get born again you'll get rid of lust you'll get born again you'll get rid of pornography you get born again you'll get rid of the things that never why because you begin to Fellowship in the light of the word in the word will drive you from the evil Kings in your life we get all these millionaire billionaires and they begin to teach us how to do business and it drives us away from church come on Church come on church I'm not against men making good money thank God I've always had that money to make it I've always been blessed because God has blessed the reading of his word but it ain't about how much money you can make it's about what God can do for you it's about what you can be in your walk with God 10 15 years ago Let It Come unto the message churches of all of this way and how to make everybody millionaires well I don't mean to tell y'all this but everybody ain't millionaire come on church and you know what I witnessed I've witnessed marriages divorced come on come on Church this get rich trick scene don't work you need God you need the fellowship of God you need the anointing of God if God needs you to do something he'll bless it come on church I got a good friend of mine the pastor's a church in another state God told him to go to church and people would come he started a church and a senior citizen building you know what happened he has 40 45 35 40 people 90 of them didn't know the message until they met at church come on church God is still moving in this day if you'll listen to what he said and you don't smoke in the light of the work and do what he asked you to do he'll bless you for it he'll bless you along the way he'll give you what you have to he'll give you in abundance more than you have been up because then he can trust you to bless others come on Church what is it it's time for a Rapture to go it's time for a bread to go thinking Genesis 24 when he speaks to Rebecca right and Abraham wanted a wife for his son Abraham decides he needs a wife for his son that he don't want one in the land that are living in he wants one from his homeland and he sends a prophet to get a bride call Church don't just look at the story look at what God's doing look at what God's thing look he sees a joke right down there and he says I want to send my son them that'll scouted out come on church so he sent a prophet to the land the message for that day for the light of that day that Prophet goes into that land looking for a bride look he wasn't looking for a bride for himself from church brother Brandon wasn't looking for a pride for himself he was looking for a pride for Jesus Christ he was looking for a pride of the god almighty but he was sent into the land with a word for the day the light for his day to seek out a bride and to call her out of the denominator to call her out of the church to set herself aside what happens the easier goes down there and he's looking for one and he comes across Rebecca Rebecca tracks as a teacher why because Rebecca was different come on Church come on he walked up to the well we back and started waiting on him why because Rebecca had been raised right so there ain't nothing wrong with being raised right young people when Mom and Daddy tells you what to do you need to leave what they do because it's going to pay dividends for you later in life come on Church there's a reason why the scripture says honor thy mother my mother and father there's a reason our scripture says raise them up in the right and they won't Department because there's a way that God has planned for you and I to get us to a place that he can track our attention to the light of our day she had heard that there was a prophet in the land she had heard that Abraham had so churned away that she also knew that Abraham's seed was a blessed promise seed and when this man began to speak to her something we ignited in her that something about this Prophet no church oh it happened to you and I when we pushed pray and we listened to a tape the voice off of that take something we ate something inside of us there's something about what he's saying he's thinking to me and speaking to the others he ain't speaking to everybody else he's speaking to me the light of this day the word for my day is speaking to me oh Rebecca wasn't concerned with what her sisters for thought she wakes us up with what her mom and dad thought he heard the word for her day will you go I'll go come on come on church he began to take her back he began to take her back across that way he began to take her back but you know what when they come in the sight of Isaac Helly Angel Falls off the scene come on Church ain't about the prophet no more it's about the groom and the bride being joined together come on Church we're looking at the light of our day look I'm throwing off a prophet I'm not throwing off unless you they did what God called them to do but there's a pride now that must recognize she's the bride of Christ she's not marrying the prophet she's marrying cry come on church I'm living in a dead perversion with men's heart want you to follow a man instead of following Christ come on Church I'm talking about the spiritual this day you got to do exactly what he said well if you would do exactly what he said you would follow that man come on Church they don't listen to the tape they listen you know what they want to listen to Because if they would listen to every message that man drinks he pointed them to Christ Ellie he's a brought into Isaac and then he just said that's your group Isaac he's a man for you he's the one I've been telling you now here let me present you to him and then he left the scene come on Church call Church you know it's true and you know the spirits that we're fighting in this day it's the light of our day God isn't showing you it's more than God's in a prophet it's a pride that is manifesting what that Prophet said Rebecca I'm sure we'd like to love the stories of Elijah she loved to hear about Isaac she loved to hear how handsome he was she loved to hear how athletic he was how hard of a worker that he was she probably even loved to hear how much money he had all of these things made her happy but when her eyes be held Isaac she don't want to hear them boys come on charge come on Church well the bride and the day of a Rapture when the bride and a day of manifesting time it's time for stories not to be told but to be spoken of come on church it's time for us to be the storybook to be the new book of pets it's time for Pride to rise up manifest what that Prophet said she would be and we joined together with Christ time Psalms 36 and God will I praise his word and the Lord when I praise his word and God have I put my trust I will not be afraid what man can do to me I have vows upon money upon me oh God I will render Praises unto thee but there has delivered my soul from Death will not deliver my feet from told him that I may walk before God in the light of the living look in 1964 in the message for all we'll try to move on in the age of every Seer every Prophet it's been the same we find people living in the glare of another light come on Church come on Church you garnish the walls of the tombs of the prophets you're the one that put them there see they build up something over a message come on church and they live in the glare of another light they refuse to walk in the light that is of this day come on Church what'd they do in Daniel's day brother William told us the golden image was an image come he told us that was the image of them and he also come back and he told us that the Gentile deposition would start unto men worship and it would end on demand worship come on the same thing of trying to worship a man and getting their eyes off of God when he says they build up something over a message look there ain't nothing over the message that Christ sent to you mean you come on Church the message that this Prophet brought us come out of this book you take this book in the message that he brought us it'll get you in a Rapture it'll get you in manifesting time it'll get you to a place that you begin to manifest where the Holy Spirit wants to manifest in you and you don't need somebody to hold your hand you don't need a pacifier to make you feel better why because you've got the light of your day foreign reason why they refused to know Jesus Christ when he came that's why Jesus exhorted them saying search the scripture for in them you how you think you have eternal life and they that testify me he said oh but they had so many Creeds and things in their traditions and Jesus says you've made the word of God of no effect by your tradition and that's the way it's been in every age look that's quote from your prophet in message 64 April 27 a trial he said and that's the way it's been in every age what in every age they do the same thing look if we had time this morning and I got a study in there in the book that we could turn to and we could fall down every denomination and we could fall how they come out of the organization Luther for that now the thesis to the wall of the Catholic church that's a Lutheran Church and they're Catholic come on Church they took 90 of what the Catholics did and they just changed a few things they called themselves lutherans come on Church and then you got the message and they follow this one and then you got the Baptist and they follow this way and then you got the Jehovah Witness and that part of this one and they quit moving on with God they quit moving with the light of their day and they begin to live in that light of a glare of another age and they live where they stayed where they're happy with their content where they don't get they they don't get challenged by the word of God and they can just go to church and have a good time maybe they go to church and watch Frozen come on Church or February they have Super Bowl party we can get everybody together and watch the Super Bowl and have a good time that's not church that ain't what the church was built for the church was built to show you the word of God to show you right for your day for you to rise up above all of this I said in many times everybody says anything and that's the way it's been in every age he said as many times you see he said what it is we the people try to have our own interpretation of the word that's exactly what scripture told us Ephesians 8 divisions five verse 8 says for you sometimes dark but now are you light in the Lord now walk as children of light what is it 1959 what is the audio is given for he says and therefore now watch and that day you will know that I'm in the father and that you are in me and I am in you in that day that you know it for the whole thing is one Plan of Redemption coming down and God coming back to live in and dwell in a commune to his people as he did in the beginning he said now then as soon as he gets a church in speaking conditions it's Church took place that he can flow himself through them come on Church God's looking for a place God's looking for a people that have said their ideals aside come on church we used to stand up here in the Ministries before men and the elders before me that I stood for this word they used to stand up here and they used to mess up they said they used to bathroom us this they used to bash the Pentagon and all of these denominations but you know what we got to do today is we got past message believers better let Creeds get in the way of the spirit of God come on Church we're living in a day that is crept in amongst us in churches around the land that put your brother Brandon picture on the wall that don't mean everything that said and here's the truth that means that you need to take it back to the word and make sure that's what the truth isn't spoken he said as soon as he gets his people come on church as soon as he gets a church his people as soon as he gets his bride in a condition in speaking conditions and gets his to place that he can flow through them and love and persuade and fellowship then there will come an Eden come on Church look look it's wonderful I love to tell the stories I love to hear the stories but it's time for the bride to begin that's the stories come on Church you know it's attacked me so much because you say well I don't want to seem like I'm Eric and I'm not arrogant but my God is available my God is willing my God is available my God it has the ability to do anything you need him to do if it takes me telling stories about what God's did for you it's not about me it's about him it's about me being in a third world country and nobody's no place to go and God wakes somebody up on the U.S in order to pray for me to deliver me from an attacking Spirit come on this is modern day real life still moves the way that he used to move God is looking for a bride that she can help speaking conditions with come on Church how many of you is mad you want your wife to be able to talk to you come on Church it ain't much of a marriage if you can't talk to each other come on Church you take multiple marriage if if you've had a bad day at work and you come home and you ain't got somebody to lay your head on the shoulder I cry a little bit and played a little bit and ask for a little Mercy as for a little Grace ask for a little love my God's the same way he's the bride to be able to commune with he's running a bride be able to share his compassions with he's wanting a pride to be able to speak freely with and her to speak freely with him to love one another to walk together in the in the call of the heat of the garden and then before before the fall happiness and as Adam would be able to walk down through there and I think God would be able to just walk down of him and they could just talk about how beautiful the sons that was come on Church it's time it's time if he can get his church into speaking conditions get his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then that will come in Eden he'll take your church back to where it left him at Back to Eden again that's where it fell and he says oh now he said that's when they made its first start in fall and that's where to be taken right back with every clean state of redemption bringing them straight back to that place again Revelations 21 verse 22 reading that it says and I saw no Temple therein the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb of the Temple of it and the City of no need of sun neither a moon just shining it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamp is the Lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them who say which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the urge to bring their Glory and Honor into it and the gates of it all shall be up shut At All by day for there shall be no night there oh what a promise and they shall bring the glory and honor the Nations otherwise Revelations 22. now he speaks of its manifesting come on Church we've read this so much we know it verbatim in our hearts when are we going to let it become so real that the bride can get come on he's not looking for an 18 Messenger to come and reveal to us the secrets of the message he did that through this prophet come on Church he tied all the loose ends up through this prophet this was the last they profit this was the prophet to bring a message to a bride of a Rapture to come this was the prophet that God chose that God Vindicated that that's why the world hates him you realize that the world and the religious critics hung Jesus because they hated him because of who he said he was you realize that the world and the religious critics that today hate him because of who he said he was because if they really believed was then they understand the only way in is through the message of the Hour come on Church but yet they can't live it they can't portray it because they ain't the backside of the desert experience and so what's the next best thing to do is to kill it come on church that's why they killed Jesus it's because Jesus was pointing them to the light of their day and they chose Darkness over light and it don't change in air day that the prophet comes showing us the light for our day to walk in the light of our day and they can't accept the light so they had to try to kill it with Darkness but there's a bride come on Church there's a God sitting here this morning they don't care what the religious critics say come on there's a bride sitting here this morning that stood on the Outsource of Golgotha here and they watched him crucify Christ and today they're watching them crucify the light of their day the messenger of their day they're seeing what's happening around the world but they're standing there on the hillside showing but he said this would happen come on church that's what that's what Peter would say that's what Paul would say that's what they would say they said but he said that they would destroy the temple but in three days they would raise it up and they was looking for the manifestation of that prophecy that was broken there was a bride today that is living in the height of her day that is looking at the message and the messenger because they can't be separated and they're looking in the word and they're saying oh it's come to pass that they're going to crucify the messenger crucify his character they're going to crucify his message but I'm the bride and I'm standing back watching manifestation take place at the manifestation take place and I'm about to go in a rapture and the spirit and the bride as they come and let him hear it say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely for I testify unto every man that Hearth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues of the written of this book If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy then God shall take away his part of The Book of Life and out of that Holy City and from the things that are written in this book in this book there's a lot of people gonna answer for a lot of things come on Church come on Church people comes and tries to take a five-fold Ministry out of this battle they're going to answer come on Church come on Church they come in and they start dictating and telling you what you can and can do they're going to answer come on Church I think I've told y'all this before y'all need to pay more attention to your social media because you know what I did I did I did a 30-day study back a year ago or so hopefully it's changed because hopefully people's heard me say it and about a 30-minute period I took every quote that was placed on Facebook that that is in my friend group or whatever and about 85 percent of them wasn't even what the prophet said come on Church come on Church adding to or taken away they're going to answer for it but there's a broad there's a pride this morning this bride is the one I'm speaking of sitting here this morning that she sees the the the the nonsense of this world she sees the nonsense of religious heresy even in her own ranks but when she sees a quote she's got technology so she goes types it in because oh that ain't exactly what he said it's kind of like the way that this all started in the Garden of Eden when the devil said everything right but one word come on Church but yet there's a bride and he which testifies of these things saith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you amen what is it musicians come Fellowship around the word of your day on Church everything in the world is falling apart come on Church oh that's
