sunday school um if you have your bible turn with me to proverbs chapter 4. hear ye children and the instruction of the father and attend to no understanding for i was my father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth wisdom is the principle thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee i have taught thee in the way of wisdom i have led thee in right path take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she is thy life avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass away for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence the way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they stumble let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life let thine eyes look right on and let that eyelids look straight before thee let's last one together turn not to the right hand nor to the left to remove thy foot from evil but detroit you may be seated it's a good day to be in the house of lord this morning beautiful day out uh i just was uh this was kind of had a little thought this week as i was driving down to nashville i was going uh and they were doing construction work down there and uh on the interstate and it should have been done started a long time ago but but they're uh they were i thought to myself which i don't see this a lot anymore in life as you go through things uh but they're they seem like they're doing a pretty good job they're getting it done uh they look like they're uh really working pretty hard but um not only that they have tons of equipment out there they uh they built their own like a temporary asphalt plant and a concrete plant right on the side of the road there so they're really moving and getting it done got things organized and it got me to thinking as i was driving by one of underneath one of the bridges there they had the dozers had pushed out looked like probably three foot maybe down on oh where the bridge pilings were and they had left just this little spot and it got me to thinking of uh how brother adam said it was talking about that bridge and then we'll go in the scripture here uh just got me thinking about foundations and things like that and doing things right making sure that it's done right but if you go with me to matthew actually actually luke sorry luke 6. just a little scripture reading here luke 6 and we'll start in verse 47. but a lot of things in life anymore especially in the work things a lot of people cut corners and things aren't done right but these these guys look like they know what they're doing and they like i said they they're they seem like they're overdoing it basically but it looks like they're getting it done good and this is jesus speaking in here in luke 6 47 whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doith them i will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built in house and dig deep and laid foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the earth against which the streams defeat vehemently and immediately in the ruin of the house was great and uh looking at that scripture and then looking at how those those construction workers are doing a good job and they're uh they're getting things done really good i seen uh you might have seen the same picture it was on the internet it was probably a couple years ago when a hurricane had came through in florida there and and had wiped every house every house was knocked down except one house and i was listening uh to the interview that the guy did and he he was saying that they had drove the they had over built it not they didn't build it to code but they built it beyond code and uh and they took and drove the pilings down like way deep down into the earth and it was the only only house there wasn't ever every other house like a tornado where it grabs the house and leaves the other standing but this was the only house standing and the only thing that they could uh say that probably was the reason was that they overbuilt the house it was built much better than any other house it was the only one left standing and kind of like when brother branham was talking about that uh that bridge builder over in sydney australia when he was when nobody wanted to build this bridge but this builder took upon himself and said he thinks he can do it or actually didn't say he thinks he can do it he said he knows he can do it and he was building it better than anybody else ever built it and i have a a little uh where brother branham was reading that quo or where where he was talking about that but let's see this is in the fallible word of god and he said did you notice he couldn't die on earth this is talking about jesus now did you notice he couldn't die on earth and he couldn't die in heaven so he was the bridge between he died between heavens and earth the very best material that god could put he spoke through the prophet and said it will be in there he reserved the seed thy seed shall bruise the serpent's head and he did it amen he did it and the same god that said that promised you'd send jesus christ the same time the second time for those who wait for his coming and his in his and love his coming the same god that said that said that he would heal our sickness if we would believe him through the atonement that was made there in the middle of the river amen you believe that sure he was the one who paid the price he was the one who's done all these things for us the day that the bridge was completed talking about the sydney bridge now the people screamed and shouted all over the city and all over the country because the bridge was fixed and if you don't believe it he said they screamed and shouted read acts 2 when the bridge was completed that span man back into a relationship with god find out if it wasn't not only that but come rolling down the bridge some divine gifts from god out of heaven and anointed the church to preach the gospel into all parts of the world in sydney when the great final day come after the expansion was made everybody went out and they gave decorated the bridge with flags and so forth giving honor and then the great crucial moment come the ribbon was stretched across and the mayor was the first one to break the ribbon as he went across what's the bridge going to do without one speck of doubt in his mind he broke the ribbon because he had confidence in the builder and the material that went into it some of these days you got to break the ribbon too brother that's right that spans this life from the other you're walking on a brittle threads and you don't know what time they'll break that is true but when the ribbon does break i've got confidence in the tower and in the bridge that was spanned for a highway for us to travel from earth to glory and the mirror broke and after he broke the way hundreds of others followed them loads of people three or four great big electric trains chugged along in each side not a doubt in their minds on all behind there come tens of thousands of automobiles and walking pedestrians and all going across the bridge and someday when life is all over as we break them brittle threads and we see the lord jesus christ coming in his power and glory at the other side when north and south sydney was joined together by one expansion and when jesus died at calvary it spanned an expansion that joined god and man together that men are still the sons and daughters of god and man because jesus christ span the way that's my confidence and his word how he did it and when he had at that day and they went across the bridge the screams and the shouts and the bridges set solid there was not a weave in it at all because the right material had been put in it the right thing had been done the right precautions had been taken and if man how his fame was through all the world the papers packed it everywhere and he was the most famous bridge builder in the world at the time because he took precaution he put the best material in it he wasn't thinking about the price he was thinking about the bridge and then if a man if men will be so concerned for transportation of his fellow man to take such precautions as that how much more is god concerned about his own children to take precautions that the right thing is said so therefore brother our faith is anchored in the word of the living god and when jesus christ said the things that i do shall you do also even more than this for i go into my father i believe that to be the infallible word of god i believe when he said a little while and the world will see me no more yet you shall see me for i'll be with you till the end of the world i believe that's the infallible word of god and i believe that he promised that wherever two or three are gathered together he'd be in her midst and that's the infallible material of god that by my hopes is built in tonight and takes us from this earth to glory and i believe that to be the truth amen uh god bless you brother david hey man you love him this morning let's stand if we could and it's just good to be in the house of the lord this morning and man how many come expecting this morning amen just pray that god will speak to our hearts this morning and and we just appreciate each and everyone that's here this morning and

are you thankful for that this morning amen and while we're standing this morning and we only have uh one prayer request this morning and we always remember our shut-in sister peggy the different ones that are not able to be here and we always want to remember them in prayer and greet those that are watching this morning and just pray that god will speak to their hearts but we have a prayer request this morning and i i've been keeping up with it some about trevor and most all of you know and me and brother steve was talking out back before service and this this young man has just really been through a lot that's the easiest way i know to say it and him and his mother tina they have went to uh male's clinic and they're going to start testing today until thursday and he just he just needs a touch from the lord to really you know help them to find out what his problem is and just pray that make sure that he's cancer-free and it says then the plan is to make him a new esophagus and just just really we need to keep him in prayer this week and just pray that god will just move in a special way and you know it's it's sometimes it's easy not to remember someone in prayer but you know if it was your son or your grandson you'd want everybody to pray and you'd really want to call out to god and i believe if there's ever a time that trevor needs a touch from the lord it's now and i i honestly which i don't do well with pain but i don't know how he has maintained a anytime you see a picture of him he's always smiling he has seems like a positive attitude and just pray that god just keep him up and you know if you've never been sick you don't know how people feel when they hurt all the time they don't feel good and uh just really need to hold them up in prayer and pray for sister sherry's back and the lord will touch her this morning and so i just wonder if we could all just take a minute and just pour our hearts out to the lord for trevor this morning so let's just pray together if we could only believe because all things [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] for all things are possible oh yes lord granted this morning [Music] all things are possible [Music] let's sing it this way this morning lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe that all things are possible lord lord i believe lord i believe i know all things are possible [Music] lord i believe amen you may

appreciate it amen certainly enjoyed the hard time together yesterday amen since we hadn't had gotten to do that in quite a while amen and we do appreciate everybody participation amen and we're praying about maybe doing something like that every few months would that be okay every few months maybe every other month or something like that but all i all i ask is that when we do it everybody tries to schedule it in and you may have to sacrifice something you know uh it's to try to be there you know so that not just a few of us are there but you know we want everybody that possibly can be to be there amen because that's what it's all about amen fellowship with one another amen and i really think that's wonderful i certainly enjoy it amen and so praise the lord let's go before the lord in prayer father we just come before you this morning lord once again lord jesus thankful to be one day closer to home one day closer to seeing father what heaven is really all about lord and lord as we gather together in your precious name this morning we would just ask god that you'll come and that you'll speak to us along the way father for you are the same yesterday today and forever and lord we know that you're not in your corporal body anymore but you're in your bride body now lord jesus and you're still speaking to us along the way through the form of the holy spirit in your people and we just ask god that you'll just be with us and bless the service this morning and ministering of the word that which we feel lord you've laid upon our heart to minister we ask god that you just speak to us and help me just to get out of the way lord and bless everybody that has come lord jesus that we might all go out those double doors better than what we came we ask these blessings and favors in jesus christ's name amen and amen train your bibles if you will amen just a little thought amen i felt like the lord laid it's the same amen uh same gospel same message amen maybe just a little bit different angle amen so in first corinthians two if you will first corinthians 2. and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling and my speech in my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god i want to take a little thought here out of verse 2 the first three verse for i determined amen and this morning i wanted to just title this i am determined amen i am determined praise the lord god bless you you can be seated this morning amen now we know that paul here paul we know how zealous that he was in that right and how determined paul was even before his conversion is that right to stop this movement that was going on of everybody following jesus amen and he was very determined he was i guess one of the most zealous people out of all the sanhedrin to make an effort to persecute the church of the living god he knows he was very zealous very determined man paul had a vision you know he had a he he had something in his mind he was a determined person and he had and god seen that and of course we know uh god chose paul amen to turn him around and to turn his seal because talk paul talked about zeal and how when as touching sealed even persecuting the church and so forth and and so forth but you know god turned that zeal around amen and now paul became very zealous and very determined amen in the way of the word amen and and serving god amen you know i want to first talk about this word determined for just a few minutes and to me this determined means to be set all right it's to be said and in job god uses this word in chapter 14 when he talks about man that is born of a woman many times we use this scripture at a funeral amen a man that is born of a woman being a few days and full of trouble comes down and forth comes forth like a flower is cut down and so forth and it says in verse 4 who can bring a clean thing out of a unclean not one seeing that his days are determined you see his days are set amen the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot pass praise the lord amen also i asked siri to tell me what that was all about and just what the meaning of it was the dictionary to be determined means to have made a firm decision and being resolved not to change it what brought me to the thought was uh speaking of and i was just thinking about how to here we're at the end and we're here at the finality of it all and you know it is truly going to be it's going to take determination how many believes this is an hour when you've got to be determined you have to have me the die has to be cast the choice has to be made [Music] and let me tell you something how many knows when somebody is determined it's very hard to stop a determined person no matter who it is no matter what it is and we know that satan how many knows that he is determined in first peter 5 and 8-9 it says it this way he says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion sits on the couch and leaves you alone no no he is determined many times when i look this up but obama says you know he was praying for people who are going to die if god didn't do something he says satan is determined to take your life prematurely he's determined to take your life i mean no the devil is a determined person amen it's to have a fixed goal an ambition something that you're set on and if you and i are going to make it it's going to be it's going to take determination there's another word the prophet uh uh used and it was called perseverance perseverance or determination or desperation amen and there's only really one thing that brings uh determination and that is faith amen because you can't be determined without faith now let me say one thing about determination that you got to be careful about because i have seen people i've seen people who were really really really determined uh christians so called and you've got to be careful and make sure that what you're determined in is the right thing because you can be determined in the wrong thing and it isn't going to do you any good so you got to make sure that you're in the will of god amen how many knows yeah when it comes to you think about in on the world scope of things you and so forth and how many knows that like hitler had determination he was very determined and the japanese from what i understand before we defeated them i'm told that they had never been defeated they didn't know how to say i surrender that's why it took him so long hiroshima nakasaki we about had to drop a bomb on their capitol before they said all right all right enough is enough huh but they were so determined they'd have kamikaze and it's hard to fight somebody's gonna ram his airplane right into your ship and ah they were determined they were set everywhere you fought them it was fight to death they were so determined they were going to fight to the last person they were beginning their little girl their little boys at home and everybody to fight and how to fight and how to shoot and they were gonna fight us with everything they got all the way to the end they were the charmers but do you know what this is what i love i love this that no matter how bad the devil is determined amen the believer there's only one way that you'll overcome people like the jabs or hillary that is that you've got to be more determined because they found out that yeah they were kamikaze yeah we were a little kamikaze ourself we were determined they were going to be stopped same way with him we were determined and it was for a good cause it was for the right cause i mean that's a good cause to be determined about the right cause i believe it brother bam says you know he read it off of somebody else who got some something he says find the right cause find a good purpose and then give yourself to it i mean that's what we've done you found the right cause and it's the cause of christ amen you've got to be determined god loves people that are determined after you become a christian remember this god sends trials he allows temptations and trials to come your way to try you right because why because he wants to see how determined you really are because that's what god is looking for he's looking for people who are determined just like that woman that he says you know it's not me to give the children's bread to dogs huh discouraging her calling her a dog most people would have got an attitude and wouldn't even talk to her but he let the preacher not talk to you when you talk to him and you walk away can you imagine i never gone to that church again huh but listen he didn't even talk to her and he kept she kept following she kept following huh oh my god got into another conversation and so forth and she says one thing she says you know that's true lord it's true you know that it's not me to give the children breath to the dogs but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master table he's seen her determination and he said be it unto you as dies belief we're living in a world folks that's soft the opposite of determination i've got a bunch of things wrote down here you know it's undetermined is to be easily stopped it's to be undecided it's to be wishy-washy it's to be a jellyfish i know the jellyfish doesn't have any backbone it's to be wishy-washy it's to be on set not knowing where you're really going how many please we gotta go we're set we're determined one place the bible says since the time of john the the kingdom of god suffers violence and the violence take it by followers in other words you got to go get it [Music] oh god's commissioned to moses moses god's commissioned the moses to reap that sometimes talks about how that you know that you've got to go and possess it he's giving you the land but they still got to go possess it that's the way we are this morning amen you got to be determined to be set the decision has to be made once the decision is made amen then you can go forward we live in an age of softness people are just so soft they can't take anything remember brother bam talking about he says you know the boxers and so forth physically speaking he talked about the boxers not being able to take a a punch with a big old featherbed on their on their on their fists and so forth and he talks about the hybrid food that's right that big mac at mcdonald's that ain't no good for you it's hybrid it'll make you want to go home and go to bed huh the food not a crazy it's a hybrid food and he says it's bound to affect the brains now folks a lot of folks have a lot of philosophy out about homosexuals and how well it's in your genetics probably god tied it to even the hybrid food has caused them not to be able to have the right mind huh he said they're getting off in their mind because of even the food huh anything i believe to profit over any kind of science but what is it make yourself the day of you know being rugged people who believed in something stood for something had a purpose oh my let me just say this brother said in god's commission to moses he said talking about moses and how that he's seen this sign you know over this stadium first of all he says you know come into the stadium he says you know it's not the size of the dog and the fight but it's the size of the fight that's in it all i thought that's good it's what's down in here oh anything i hate to see is a spineless person who calls themselves a christian oh my god want some i'd eat with grit and backbone like old buddy robin said lord give me backbone the size of a saw log but plenty of knowledge in the gable end of my soul let me fight the devil as long as i got one tooth and then come him till i die god give him the holy ghost when he got into that cornfield and said god if you don't give me the holy ghost you're gonna find the bar all the bones right here [Music] when you get like that persevere huh god will answer you but we are we got to be careful folks how many knows you got to be careful first thing you know your pillow is so soft you don't even want to get up go to church that's soft jellyfish huh get up in the morning if you ain't got time to pray because you're so busy serving money instead of god jesus said you can't serve both masters either serve god or mammon huh praise be to god [Music] oh my he says if you're gonna you're gonna find pile of bones if you don't hear god give him the holy ghost but the bible says you've got to get determined praise the lord i got the thing that's oh i am determined i made up my mind y'all are all for quiet can i get them respawn i didn't know what you did too have you are you determined have you made up your mind then i'll serve the lord wherever he leads us i'll follow every pastor's that's wealthy i will go with him through the garden i'll go with him wherever he goes i'm determined in this hour of softness huh laziness couch potatoes jellyfish bombs that's a good description of undetermined it's a bomb that bridge is fine i'll just lay under bridge slate don't you realize if you just worked half a day you could make enough money to buy a nice tent for yourself keep the mosquitoes off of you huh but they're so undetermined that's why they get nowhere praise the lord you've got if you're gonna get anywhere naturally speaking you gotta be determined if you're gonna get everywhere spiritually you gotta show some footprints footprints means possession amen oh my you've got to be determined that's right get ready take over god said so let's take over that's what god wants us to do just like he can miss him go down there and take over i don't care you just got to stick take this i'm with you and then your ties and age your background and it's not who you are it's who he is and whether you have him or not that's what it's all about if you got him i don't care how many philistines come upon you uh samson he didn't didn't matter how many philistines come upon thousands come upon him it's hard for one man to defeat ten men because they can pounce on him at the very same time and he can't do nothing but that was samson when they had him all the way down he just looked like that he just knocked them all off i can see it in my mind 10 foot in the air maybe 20. i don't know you're dealing with god here not samson flipping through the air amen and yeah oh my when you get all the blues and depress and amen do you want to get all sad and blue get on your knees i'm telling you the blues will find their way flying through the air depression will find its way flying through the air if you just get a hold of christ you'll come to church with a smile on your face you'll come to church and you'll have a good old head pump handler and jack how you doing brother parish [Applause] it won't be all i'm so so man i can't barely make it huh where's your persistence where's your perseverance where's your determination [Music] how many would like to hear how jesus said what he wants how he feels about determination turn with me if you will let's go look in luke the 14th chapter remember determine now i just want to read before i read that let me finish some of the definitions in the verb point of determine determine it says one place he says cause to something to occur in a particular way be decisive be the decisive factor in it number three is to be firmly beside it firmly decided amen now notice jesus kind of begin to describe to us what kind of character because this has to do with our character how many knows that it has to do with what character and that's what god's looking for is character what kind of character are you chapter 14 of luke verse 28 for which of you well wait a minute let me go back a bit let's go start with 25. there were not a great multitude with him and he turned and he said unto them if a man come to me and his father mother wife children brethren sister and yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple you talk about listening to jesus on the shores of galilee and you talk about a man that goes just a little bit extreme [Music] what can you imagine how many said what hey this mama daddy brothers sisters and his wife in his own life also in other words you've got to be determined you got to be sad that it's him i'm going to follow now follow my mind i'm hauling my brother and i like the song says if my brother don't go don't hinder me mama don't god don't hinder me i said don't go don't let it dope stop me i'm going that's what christ is looking for you care about people oh and aren't you glad we're gonna need it because those saints of all the ages they're gonna ask us how in the world did you make it huh let me tell you something i believe i'm looking at a miracle right here it's a miracle many fall by the wayside uh many have gone out maybe followed by the wayside and god the devil would have his way you wouldn't be sitting in your seat this morning how many knows if you're going to overcome the first you're going to have to be determined to overcome the flesh because if you aren't determined to overcome the flesh and you allow the flesh to have its way it's going to be terrible i mean we're all inflate we all know how the flesh pulls us the wrong way you let the flesh have its way you let it do what it wants to do it don't want to get up it don't want to work it wants to be lazy once over great hey we'd all be 400 pounds this morning if you didn't have some control huh boy i woke up this morning i said you've got to stop that you have got to quit huh i looked in the mirror i said sorry body i'm sorry to let you do that huh i'm apologizing to myself that's right oh y'all right i said begotten to deny the flesh don't let it have its way it didn't want to go to church this morning he don't want to come on wednesday he don't pray but the holy ghost in there says get down on your knees do what i tell you to do because that's what the gospel the holy ghost is all about amen the bible says that our flesh is become subject to the spirit amen you're going to have to be determined because the devil out there is giving people all the desires of the flesh they want all the lust of the eye you want listen this is something else the lord showed me the last few days everything you're doing in this world as far as gains doesn't mean one thing there's only one thing that means anything in this life you know what it is and it's what you do for christ that's why i like to hear those specials you're doing something for christ you're being a blessing that's the on probably the most valuable thing we've done sing a special do something for christ amen it's the only thing that matters is what we do for christ amen lord help us because it's all going to be over with one of these things and we are determined we've set up our minds that we're living for that next world that's the comp are you with me we're living for that body change that is promised i believe we ought to be in the most enthusiastic people about that scripture in 2nd thessalonians the trump's going to sound the dead in christ arise and we which are alive and remain are you believing that you're gonna be part of it you're the ones that are alive and remain shall not prevent them but we're gonna meet the lord in the air we'll be changed paul said in the moment in the twinkling of an eye it ought to be our highest goal god help me to be ready for that god i want to be found without spot without regal getting the wrinkles out of my life i want to be ready i'm determined that i'm going to be ready amen remember elisha and elijah and elijah wanted a double portion and elijah's elijah said look if you see me when i go y'all be granted to you and then elijah's july says elijah stay here i gotta go to go over here right and then another place it says i no no i'm coming i ain't going to leave she's inside of you he came in and he said stay there i got to go over there he tried to discourage him from coming but he would not be discouraged oh church don't allow the devil discourage you and he was there when he took his mantle when he parted the waters and then he went and he took a chariot and went to heaven he threw his mouth back to life and he got a double portion how many knows that's what christ did christ went to heaven and he throwed back his mans off for those who want him and he said greater works than these shall you do how many believes that bride has a double portion amen and let me tell you something i believe this morning that if you want to go in the rapture you better be watching him you better be looking at him when he leaves i mean it's the holy spirit he's lifting him he's going to lift up one of these days it's going to take off a lot of these gentiles it's going to go back to the jews and we're going to be lifted up the bride goes at that time if you're left after the after the holy ghost leaves you're going to be left for the tribulation period all right so you better keep your eye this morning let's persevere that we're going to keep our eye keep him in our hearts until that time because you get off get your eye off of him huh bible talks about you go and do that you're going to be left with those who are outside weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth amen praise the lord god is good is he amen so he says you've got to be determined means you got to be set like concrete amen folks you know how many times we're tommy i've had nightmares all this concrete was still in hills i've got to get it leveled out it's getting hard oh and the harder it gets the harder it is to work with you only got so much time when it's hard there it is huh it's to be set in a certain direction you're set unmovable and what the bible says be unmovable always abounding in the love of god the following was written by a young pastor in africa who was martyred for his faith and this note was found in his office after his death he says i am part of the fellowship of the unashamed amen i have the holy ghost power the dye has been capped has been cast i've stepped over the line the decision has been made folks i'm telling you it's a decision is like a crossroad here you are and you have to make a decision and when you start going down one road or the other whichever road you choose you've made the choice huh now you're going down that road the decision has been made i'm telling you what you talk about unstable insecurity is in a world where you haven't made that choice yet no right we'll get back to more of what jesus said here okay don't let me forget decision has been made i'm a disciple of his i won't look back i like that to be determined or to be undetermined is to easily be turned huh but when you are determined you won't look back you won't let up you won't slow down you won't back away or be still my past is redeemed my present makes sense my future is secure i'm finished and done with low living sidewalking smoothness colorless dreams pain visions worldly talking cheap giving and dwarfed goals i no longer need prosperity position plaudits promotions or popularity i don't have to be right first recognize the praise rewarded or regarded this guy was determined [Music] he had made up his mind i like that song the that country but the country gospel i guess or whatever southern gospel amen there's no turning around amen ain't no turning around all right regarded or rewarded i now live by faith lean on his presence walk by patience am uplifted by prayer and i labor with power now i like this next one my face is set my gate is straight my goal is heaven my road is now ain't got nothing to do with it my way is rough my companions are few is reliable my commission is clear that somebody that is determined and has made up his mind my commission is clear i cannot be bought compromised detoured lured away turned back deluded or delayed i will not flinch in the face of sacrifice and i doubt he did hesitate in the presence of the enemy pander at the pool of popularity or meander in a maze of mediocracy i won't give up come on folks how many's with me you don't give up when you made up your mind when you are determined there's no giving up you think thomas edison gave up at the 500th time no i don't know how many thousand times he tried but it didn't give up it's there i feel it i know it and he found it thank you thomas huh he just doesn't get enough recognition does he that's right all right he says i won't give up i won't shut up i won't let up until i have stayed up start up paid up how many people's like that this morning buddy i'm telling you what i'm not empty i'm at half empty i'm full i'm ready i'm praying brother bob huh how many is ready prayed up how many's expecting huh that's right oh my paid up preached up for the cause of christ i am a disciple of jesus i must go until he comes give until i drop preach until all know and work until he stops me and when he comes for his own he will have no problem recognizing me my banner is clear give him a hand [Applause] praise the lord [Applause] paul let's talk about him for just a few minutes paul he knew a little bit about having to be determined he talked about a race that we all running right but there's only one that gets surprised huh and so he was believing that he was at one that he was running a race somebody believed you're running a race huh the greater your hair the closer you are to the end of the race you only get to run this race once huh and paul at the end of it he says now i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand i fought a good fight as i say these things i want you to think about yourself i want us all to think about ourself because this should be the desire that each and every one of us has at the end of our race to be able to say this at the end of our fight to be able to say i fought a good fight huh i fought a good fight i've finished my course i've kept the faith he wasn't unsure about his status huh brother who was it that read that was it brother troy yeah brother troy mentioned that about a wise man building his house upon a rock foolish man that built upon the sand huh you know a foolish man he's a christian by his mind and so forth and he thinks he's right huh but yet he doesn't do what god says do tell me when you come to the end your house is going to crash down you're going to be disappointed is he that does what god said do that doesn't have to be a worry about anything there's no question there only those who hear these things of mine but don't do them that is the one that's going to be disappointed let's be found the one to do with them build your house upon the rock this morning so that you can say like oh i have finished my court i have run my race henceforth there is laid for up for me a crowd of righteousness oh my that's what we all want to be able to say am i right which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day [Music] i cannot write your name in it he says he's going to give it to me oh but he doesn't stop there paul we love you because he says this and not me only not me only but unto all them also that love his appearing in other words if you're in this condition also you're going to be in good shape also there'll be a crown of righteousness for you also praise the lord oh my finish but the lord said here which of you luke 14 28 wait wait wait here i go again a page too much he cannot have children brother and sister in his own life also amen oh my how many of those that last part is really really important because other places jesus said many places you know if you don't up your cross and follow me you cannot be my disciples and if you don't hate your own life also you cannot be my disciples you can't have your own way you can't do your own thing no and conjunction whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot beat my disciples now here's another one verse 28 for which of you for which of you intending to build a tower sit is not down first and counts the cost whether you have sufficiency to finish it or not praise the lord how many of us whenever you decide you're going to follow jesus it's not just about starting it's about finishing that's what it's about for us that evening i tabernacle it's not who starts it's who finishes who's gonna finish it who's gonna finish it i'm gonna finish it i trust you could say i'm gonna finish it how are you gonna do it by his strength by his help because that's the only way you're ever gonna do it is through jesus christ the only thing that's going to give you determination is christ it's faith it's the holy ghost if truly you are elected in this hour god is going to put that determination in you because the bible says he that hath begun a good work in you will perform it he's going to give you what you have need of to make it how can you stay in your seats i can barely stay up here on the platform to think that he puts that in you and if that's in you that means you're gonna make it oh my aren't you happy for that you're determined you're perseverant you're desperate you will not be denied brother baum says you know that woman in mexico that had that dead baby announced the day before he said all 100 deacons couldn't stop her she would take that little baby and crawl between the deacon's legs she'd try to get over the top of them and she'd push her way through she was gonna get to the man of god god so loved that let me tell you something that baby rose from the dead that's what it takes if you want to rise from the dead and you've got to be determined if you want more the holy ghost you've got to be retirement if you want to be closer to christ you've got to be determined [Music] you want more joy you better get determined you want to be happier you want to be better get determined you want to be a better witness get determined that's what it takes determination not not softness not jellyfishness amen but the problem of the is i'm determined it'll take perfect love to put you in there determine that you're going to have to have the baptism of the holy ghost it's going to take the token to kick you in there you got to have the token prayer praise the lord if you're happy where you are you're probably gonna stay there [Music] but if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired if you're miserable and tired and done with the invisible that's a good place to be now you're ready to get persistent are you ready to get desperate about this thing determined oh my god help us not to throw us on our back or put us into a hospital or make us get us into but terribly desperate huh we're not dumb driven cattle be a hero in the strife amen praise be to god all right so he says you know if you're going to start something you want to count the cost figure it all out to make sure that you're able to finish it it shows determination let me just say it i've got several projects even the finishing of our home called finished but out in the barn there's still the middle roll screws that need to be put on there's a lower row or screws that need to be put on because i just want to get the metal on right yeah my house it's still got some stain and some varnishing that you need to be doing but i was tired of sleeping in the loft i wanted to get it done you did there's a whole lot of little things that need to be done the little finish work huh to get the job done because i want the job done i'm bad at leaving a little bit too much undone i'm a carpenter carpenter's house never done but you know i want to go back i'm gonna have to go back and put the throws and screws in and make sure that i'll hold through this head or the other and i felt like that's the way it is in our hearts and our lives this morning sure the big works on salvation we got the holy ghost we got this but there's some still some little details in our life that need to be taken care of we're not quite finished yet and it's time to get finished it's time to be ready how in the world did it go so long how are we still here here he thought it'd be over in 77 here or in 2022 i'm sure he would be voicing the same thing how long can it go one of these days people won't feel the holy ghost anymore they won't feel the holy ghost anymore why they'll have churchianity they'll still have formalism but the holy ghost will be gone let me know only he who now let us let until he be taken out of the way he's gone people still go to church and it's scary to think how many message people may be left here huh that don't feel nothing they're not going to miss the holy ghost they didn't have in the first place or maybe they didn't or they had it and it's gone but i'm telling you now lord help us this morning i want to be ready for that time i don't want to be left behind i want to go in the rapture and i somehow believe in my heart my life that i'll see that rapture amen but time is short whether he has deficiency so jesus here he's talking about look if you're going to start something be determined to finish it amen at least happily after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it there that behold it begin to mock him ah he said he was a christian but look where he is now he wasn't really a finish he really didn't have it he said he had it but he really didn't have it amen saying this man began to build and was not able to finish it or what king going to war against another king said if not down first and consultants whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand god don't want you to be stupid he wants you to think this thing through and i say he wants you to win not lose he wants you to get the job done he wants you to win the war that's right amen or else while he is a great way off he sendeth an ambassador and desireth conditions of peace huh ain't no way you can win this war he says look best thing to do is make peace smart otherwise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple my question this morning is have we truly forsaken all i feel some things in there that you haven't forsaken isn't that a good question that's a good question for all of us because if you're really going to be his disciple if you're going to follow him you're going to go with him to the garden if you're going to make it through the trials make it through the tests huh so determined that you're going to go all the way with him you're going to have to first fall you're going to have to find those little areas in your life that are not surrendered to god and surrender them to god huh build it right start it right amen that's right he cannot be my disciples we want our testimony to be that people nowadays are going by the way of least resistance amen the bible says that the devil is as a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour isn't that right let me see here james i believe it is james 4 7. all right verse 5 do you do you think that the scripture saith and made a spirit that dwelleth in us lust us to envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resists the proud and gives grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you draw almighty god and he will go by to you how many believe god is waiting on you he has got everything done that can be done now it's up to you and i and god gives us something he gives them some he gives us that perseverance that determination to go out there and reach out there and take what the devil has taken from you amen to resist people don't like to resist people just go along with whatever huh there's no resistance oh you got to resist your fleshly desires you got to resist the devil and he says he'll flee from you you know what people are all paying it up like they do they got no resistance no resistance that's why the world looks like it does huh women going out there wearing their tights right that's what you wear under your dress they never did put your dress on any more days huh the tops and all of that that's where the world that's where they've gotten to there's something in it tattoos everywhere nose rings no control oh that's the world what about christians they're still toddlers and backbiters oh my come on folks no resistance everything that comes to their mind don't you get so low that you got to put somebody else down to try to lift yourself up because when you do remember when you start putting somebody else down that's all you're doing is trying to lift yourself up amen when we come to church we can expect to hear from god we have fellowship one with another devil don't like that but i do the church of god does it's supposed to be like that i'm gonna close with a riddle don't be calling me the riddler but i got a riddle for you you know there's some things i miss when i go back to sarasota there's terry there's polly there's uh all of their children that with that church i was one of the first converts whenever we were in the church there was probably two families i was one of one first converts of that church and i got to know the siemens their children played football with them and played sports with them and all that and then others would come in and other families would come in and other families would come in you got to know him you know and now terry and danny and their children have children when i go back this is my child you know this is this is my child's child and i'm like wow first of all i don't recognize your son hardly because he's told it's been so many years grow it all up you know what i miss is not having been there to watch them all grow up see how it went how it goes should i go to their weddings and and all these things that they have right but you know and that's because we are my friends one thing is one thing that's nice and that's good and that i appreciate is having been here watching the lasters that was the main ones that was here when i come here amen watch them what y'all grow up what you get married uh brother john says alicia watch their children grow up huh john michael hope leah watch them from little babies grow up different ones of you watch a lyric growing up huh just to be around you just a fellow bless you brother joe here folks on my dying day if i die that is we're going to get together we're going to talk about wyoming we're going to talk about texas and deer with arrows in their size and him shooting every arrow he has and wanting to chase you kill himself out he's at the last fight i kind of killed me in here oh it was hilarious you know many good times huh then we share with one another and folks i was here that's what it's all about that's what it's all about with god god wants a family he wants children he wants fellowship that's what it's all about but the riddle is what if the sarasota church moved here or we moved there because we're just like we are they have families loved ones so forth i love them all the people i don't know who they are never hardly know him at all donald reagan's church this grandma from where she's out over there somewhere and i have watched her grow up her family got to know them brother pisco vancouver different places if we were all together where would we be that's the riddle where would we be that's right heaven if you got heaven because how many knows it's that's what it's all about one day says we're all going to be together in one place and we're going to get the fellowship one with another and spend eternity together because white the love of god is abroad in our hearts and we don't just love each other we love all the house of god wherever they are with us there's no well i'm from donnie's i'm from this one i'm from brother perry i'm from now we're all part of the body of christ one day we look forward to all being together what did the prophet say get to sit down and fellowship with you for a thousand years each we'll talk talking over in the by and by amen i'm looking forward to talking over being together loving one another not letting any divisions be among us amen let the holy ghost rule in your heart be persistent perseverant to have it that way in your heart i am determined i've made up my mind i'll serve the lord amen and i am determined also to hold out to the end i know it's him holding me but how does he do it by giving me determination to hold out how many please we're going to have to hold out to the end we're not gonna let up we're not gonna quit are you with me folks we're not gonna stop we're not gonna turn around there's no turning around [Music] we've come too far to turn around we've come too far to stop he's brought us safely so far he's going to safely take us on in amen how many loves each other folks i wanted to know the prophet of god said if i had speaking in tongues up here and we had an interpretation of tongues and and we had all of these gifts operating in the church and all of this it'd be all wonderful but what would he rather have if he had to choose he'd rather have people that love each other that care about each other that's what we want love each other care about each other and going to live with each other can i get a little bit personal here some people can't get along with people that's not christian christians get along with each other christian families get along with each other christian husbands and wives get along with each other they know how to die to themselves and give a little bit for the other one then how to work things out somebody said the lord god is good ain't he i'm so glad that i'm a part of the family of god washed in his blood born of his spirit amen god bless you amen stand with me this morning with our eyes closed just a short prayer how many knows that you need more determination god bless you you need more determination and the things that you desire and that you want spiritually if you really want to remember my words this morning you're going to have to get more determined oh yeah because god loves to try your determination he loves to see how serious you are he might call you a dog he might not answer you for a while even if the prophet god says somehow you don't answer don't answer them that's when you got to know that he's god you got to be determined and that's what he loves god loves for somebody that won't give up just like the three hebrew children we're not careful about how we answer where our mind is set our goal is set our mind is made up we're not gonna bow god says i like them guys they're determined god loves determined people that they're going to serve him with all of their heart mind soul and strength in this evil age that we live in lord jesus you see those hands that went up god that say i need to be more determined than what i am don't let me be soft don't let me be wishy-washy don't be let me be a jellyfish let me make sure that my prayer life my walk with you stays right where it should be the cares of life are never gonna choke it out the responsibilities of life are not gonna choke i won't allow it i'm determined not to allow it i'm determined not to let lukewarmness come into my life i'm determined to keep that fire burning when the fire looks like it's going out around the message but it will not in my heart because that seed is down in there lord jesus forgive us where we're not determined like we should be help us to be more determined to serve you with all our heart mind soul and strength in jesus name amen amen brother david lead that song for me would you amen
