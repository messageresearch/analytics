TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] true [Music] all right [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you and otherwise you can do your food service prepare leave your house [Music] okay children can be dismissed it is Psalms 9 3. 00 yeah Lord granted he is clothed with Majesty the Lord has flown to his friend where was he encouraged himself the world also established that it cannot be moved let's have lifted up O Lord let us have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their ways praise the United States thank you yeah that's one of God chapters in the Bible I read a lot of my pages are all messed up but um by texting last night yesterday the uh we we got our insurance plan for for the water damage and the amount of 4 800 and change and they actually were pretty good to us they're hard to cut the boys honestly he thought being conservative so our complex what I actually had it up to so they asked me paid just a little bit more than what they should have paid with a thousand dollars deductible coming off on the top so I wound up to forty eight hundred dollars sometimes um I'm trying to find a spot to start in the 10th chapter here if I jump around you'll have the beginning this morning but uh I was reading some messages from the ministers that have been coming by the last they've been trying to encourage us to encouraging just me also to realize who you are in the Gospel of Jesus Christ this morning like ministers will tell you you're asking a living but he references that you have this morning you know then especially in this Tech chapter here if you realize who Jesus Christ I'll read this foreign but he did anything by the doors The Shepherd of machine the heaven the portal and the Sea bears for us now called his own Sheep by name and leadeth him out but when he put forth so she would be going before then and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and that's what I was thinking this morning because that's what all these ministers have been trying to tell you God all he hears wow he this morning and he opens that door for you he's more than able to do whatever that name is this morning but they know not the voice of strangers but I I just can't encourage her enough God knows the voice he knows who you are he knows what your needs are he knows where you've come from and where he's going there's nothing different sometimes sometimes we don't think we're worthy of something or we deserve something hey his promises are for you no matter what you think of yourself [Music] said but uh in this chapter you have the Pharisees and the Sabbath Street getting around Jesus and the questioning him and Prodigy pushing him the to tell them who he really is and the way he tells them he is if he just speaks the scriptures to him and he likes this French to speak to themselves who he is and what he is and they just can't receive it they can't believe that a man that stands before is really the presence of God in front of him they just can't believe it but I'm going to start uh unto him how long does thou make us to death without being the Christ tell us coinman so they want someone to spell it out for them they want someone to actually happen basically you have to prove to them who he is but he was telling them that the things he was doing the testimonies are performed with blessing evidence or who he was so they still couldn't believe it now I just finished this chapter here in Jesus remember I told you and you believe not the worse about you in my father's name they bear Witnesses but you believe not because you are not a machine as I have said unto you must hear my voice and I know that when they follow me and I give Mom for them eternal life that they shall never curse people showing him out in Miami my thought of which gave them me is great at all no man is able to them out of my father saying that I should be a couple of thought going back earlier no matter what happens if you're God's hands there's nothing that the world can do your enemy can do or whatever it is that can you out of God I'm saying then he goes on saying I am my father are one and this is you know as you read all my gospels this is where they had problems where's yourself from the same person and he said that and you go to Simon and said then that you just took up stones to Stone and Jesus asked them that's a good work somebody showed you from my Father which of those works these stories are basically saying what are you starting before you see the evidence before you because of the Jesus for good works you still may not work for blasphemy because I believe us excuse me because without being a man makes myself God back from what I said earlier they couldn't realize who he was and Trust then Jesus answers him if it's written in your law I said ye are gods and whom if he called him God's on to whom the word of God came and the scriptures cannot be broken saying whom the father had Sanctified and sent into the world not blaspheme is because I saw him and Son of God if I do not the works of my father believe me not and he you know Jesus if you go for the gospels he's pointing back to a Elijah and all the other prophets and identifying who he is by the things he's doing and they spoke and believe them and he goes on to say I lost my question believe me not me believe the words and if you know I believe that the father is in me and I am in him therefore I start again to take him and to escape out of their hands and he went away again Beyond Jordan went to a place where John the first baptized and there are the above and many resorted onto him saying God did no miracles but all things that John spoken this man was true and many believed on him there so they wanted to talk about this just like we have the word of God and by the Endermans we believe he's 11 God now I was going to jump back to song here and I hope I got the right one too I'll just read this one and sit down if it psalmades you I'll give you a chance to get there this morning saying and it said God stands on the congregation of the Mind rejections among the gods how long will you judge unjustly and accept the person s of the wicked descended Justice to The Afflicted I need if I I'm not trying to be funny I was about to say something but it's I would say but deliver the war needed read them out on the documents of all the foundations I had said to your gods and all of you are children of the most desire but you shall die like man and fall like one of the princes arise of God and judge your medals inheritance of all Nations and I was just thinking of that this morning have these Buddhists our people in different directions that we're all having a discussion and there was all kinds of Christians in the audience and what struck me is what the food and the Christian's been bullied he was testified of the greatness of Jesus and the person that's been receiving the person but the Buddhist is saying that you believe but like I said in the beginning more than we're willing to willing to regard less with that this morning with God in the safest places foreign [Music] [Music] I know to be

maybe the last words when we've been there 10 more than years [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] amen you may have your seats momentarily I like to greet each and every one in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and we're happy to be here this morning and thank you brother Tom for introducing my wife and all our friends that came with us and it's just a privilege to be here in the house of God and I said Thomas I said I feel right at home because I love like a small country Church you know because that's where I'm home in we know we don't have to go to the highest and fanciest places because we know the Lord meets us right where we are and that's what we're happy for today and yeah you mentioned there's no sometimes a friend just comes by when you're in the lowest point and brother Thomas yeah what you were going through at that moment that was just the Lord you know and and that's how it works we we just serve a living God he knows and works on both ends and many times we do things that we don't even understand why we do them but it's just the Lord and I said it in my church about seeing the man of God and the woman of God in the Old Testament they were never in the capacity to do their own will the things that they did that the Bible recorded was there to put it in there that God had to live them out his principles and I'll believe the same for us this morning we are not the we are not don't have ourselves will but we are there to live out the will of God for our lives that's what we're here for and this morning by the grace of God we would just want to magnify Jesus Christ now many people think that we can now we can't make him greater because he's already the greatest but what he can do for us is that we can see more of him that we can love him more that we can appreciate it more and we're just we're just happy people and you know sometimes you go to a place and you Minister and then after you haven't read a single quote people will ask does this man believe the message so I just wanted you know I'll believe the message I was raised in it and I can just say that without the message and the light of the hour we would have never understood the word of God how we can understand it today it's been just the key to open up her eyes of understanding that today we can read the word and it means more to us every day and I know how my friend brother green said he said when he fell in love with Sister Janice he said if there was a book about her I would have read the whole book and we're in love with Christ we love this book we we want to read it because we want to know more about him and I thought Thomas I have a saying that I say well Paul said you know some preach this some preach that some preach for gain some preach for that reason and then Paul says there's another point he said but I preach Christ and him crucified and and when it comes to where we are I say okay some people might preach the mystery some preach the Revelation some the private interpretations but this morning by the grace of God we want to preach Christ to you and him crucified that that is that is the main subject and that's what it's all about if what we do is not there to glorify Jesus Christ if that is not the center of our work our will of everything we do then we're in the wrong place it's not about men it is about Christ so in order to get started let me have a look at the clock it's almost 11 30 so we know we'll be finished in about one hour so whatever I say if there's something you don't like you can hold on it's not going to be more than one hour and you know when people make know that it's easier to listen to man that they don't like God bless you let us stand for the reading of the word and I want to read this morning in Exodus 21 from verse one to six or maybe worth two to six Exodus chapter 21 verse 2 to 6. it says here if thou by in Hebrew servant six years He Shall Serve and in the sevens he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him if his master has given him a wife and she have borne him sons and daughters the wife and her children shall be her Masters and he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him unto the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an owl and he shall serve him forever now if we could turn to Psalms 40. and we want to read from verse 6. and those who have an NIV Bible you will be able to read what I read those that have the King James it reads a little different but here it says in Psalms 40 verse 6. sacrifice and offerings thou didst not desire but mine ears has thou pierced burned offering and sin offering as thou not required then I said lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me I Delight to do thy will o God ye thy law is within my heart and I want to go back to to the reading where it says Antman ears has thou pierced I've checked it up in the original Hebrew text the text says my ears has thou dugged and many translators have translated in the way my ears have now opened but the digging is much more than the piercing is not opening and when we see those two scriptures together we can see that there is a connection here between the servant that we read out in Exodus and the Lord Jesus Christ whose Ministry is on display in this Psalm here and therefore the title of the message this morning is the perfect servant let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus oh Lord you said in the book it is written of me and I've come to do thy will Lord will you come this morning and reveal to us that word as we try to take it out of the words from the book that you will come and reveal it Lord that you would speak to our hearts that we will have a greater understanding of your grace and mercy towards us and would you bless every heart this morning Lord every ear that hears and bless my voice that speaketh Lord let me be a yielded vessel we want to give you in all things the honor and praise in Jesus name amen you may be seated that's a very interesting scripture and the application of the scripture where it's let's go back to the law now we know that Israel was given law and the law actually was no different than the will and the nature of the law Giver see when God the law the law was not a law different from him but it was his law it was the expression of his divine nature in his will and God knew the spirit of man would always strive against God he knew that there was no man that could ever keep the law and he says in in Acts Jesus said you stiff-necked and uncircumcised and hardened ears you always release this the Holy Ghost as your father's Soul you do also and so we can see that that law that was given it was given for man to live by and it was the expression of the Divine being of God himself and that law was there to help the Jews to live their life socially spiritually morally it was the guideline that they should live by but actually the law was much more the law was a Divine expression of the thoughts of God and that was the absolute foreshadowing of the person of Jesus Christ now when he came to Earth he said I'm not here to take away the law but I'm here to uphold the law and I'm here to fulfill the law and therefore the things that we read in the Old Testament in the law many times we just read over them yeah that's the Old Testament that was the law that was for the Jews well true it was for the Jews but if we can see the way that the law was fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ and that's why he said and I want to go back to Psalms so that we would not overread it and just not miss what it says in there but in Psalms 40 it says in the volume of the book it is written of me and see that's looking back to what already Moses had put into the law when David wrote this Psalm he was referring back to what Moses had already written in the book it was written of me and so Jesus came to absolutely fulfill this part of scripture now you say Jesus is servant and we know that the word that is used there in the Bible is actually more than just a servant the word actually means servant or slave I remember a servant might in a way sometimes still have his own will but his slave does not have his own will and we we're going to use the word servant because the word slave might sound a little harsh but we should still remember that the word being used here that its meaning is also being a Slave and if we now look to scripture and I want to read Isaiah 42 verse 1 we're speaking about Christ and here it says behold this is my servant I sustain him and my chosen in whom my soul is well pleased I have given him my spirit and he will bring out justice among the Gentiles and furthermore in Isaiah 52 13 it says behold my servant shall do wisely and he shall be exalted and very exalted so the scripture shows that the ministry of Jesus Christ also was the ministry of a servant he came to fulfill the law and it's very significant the Bible does not say if you have just a servant he says if you have a Hebrew servant he had to be off the off the Hebrews he had to be part of that Nation and that's why Jesus came into this world through Mary which was of the Jewish Nation and he goes on further to say in Isaiah 52 we'll say sorry Isaiah 53 was worse 11. it says here because his soul has wrought he shall see his pleasure and have abundance and by his knowledge he my servant the righteous shall justify many for he Bears their sin now think about that the god of Heaven the creator of Heaven and Earth comes down to his creation to be their servant it's Unthinkable that the god of Heaven could stoop down in such a way that he became the servant of those that he had created and that's why the Bible says in Philippians 2 verse 6 it said who though he was in the form of God yet thought it not robbery to be equal is God but emptied himself and took on upon him the form of his servant and was made in the likeness of another man and was found in the likeness of man and he goes on to say he humbled himself and became obedient to the point that this even this on the cross think about that and when I thought about this the song came to my mind where it says down from his glory every living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name born in a manger to his own stranger a Man of Sorrows tears and agony what condescension bringing us Redemption that in the dead of night no faint hope in sight God gracious tender laid aside his Splendor stood to win and save my soul oh thinking of the god of Heaven laying aside his Splendor stooping to come down here that he was made lower than the angels to come to save you and me and to be our servant oh Hallelujah what a God we serve and he goes on to say without reluctance Flesh and Blood his substance he took the form of man revealed the hidden plan oh Glorious Mysteries sacrifice of Calvary and now I know Thou Art The Great I Am he came to fulfill the law oh he came to be a servant he came to deliver what a miracle of Grace God laying aside the greatest Glory and Authority that he had and coming down to greatest dependence Jesus was dependent when he was in the days of Flesh he became dependent when he was born as a baby he became dependent on Mary that she had to nurse him because he needed just as you and I he needed to be nursed just as you and I he needed to sleep just as he was I he became thirsty just like you and I he became sick because the Bible says that he was acquainted with sickness God coming down in the form of a servant making himself dependent just like you and I to come to fulfill the law he left aside all honor glory to take the suffering and shame I remember the Earth was subject to the devil since the fall but now the creator of Heaven and Earth he comes to the place of subjection when Jesus came that did not end Satan's rule here on Earth the Earth still till today is set to the root of Satan but now he comes here to even subject himself into that system well Satan was also created by God he created everything that there is so he created Satan he created the Fallen Angels but Satan was not able to keep his place he lost his place because he wanted a higher Kingdom yeah and from the time that happened Satan was always watching God let's see what is his next move then God made a man another part of the creation and Satan immediately asked himself let me see this one that God has made here will he be like me and fall or can this be a perfect man and he tried it out on Adam and Adam Phil as Satan mocked he tried it out on every servant of God and every one of them fell as Satan laughed but finally there was one that came that would not be deceived that would keep the father's will one that was able to fulfill the law of God and Jesus said do you not know I have to be about my father's business first words that ever recorded see he said I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me see he did not make Adam to be a servant Adam was made to be a son and Adam could be deceived but he made Christ to be a servant an obedient servant and being an obedient servant he could not be deceived to leave the will of God but he stayed in the center of the will of God and the laws of God oh if you're a perfect servant you will always be dependent on the pleasure of you master as brother Ram talked about about The Pianist or the violence he didn't look to the crowd but he looked to the master that trained him and that is what Christ did he did not look for pleasure for himself he also the word says made of himself no reputation say we as humans whatever we do I did this yeah I just yeah but Christ made of himself no reputation and that's why I've often wondered why when he healed the sick he said don't tell nobody don't brag about it just keep it for yourself because he did not want to receive any glory for man look at Christ he was not looking for Glory for himself he was only looking to glorify the father because he was a perfect servant that God had sent to fulfill the laws of God that was written in the law by Moses that was his pleasure and he gave proof that there could be a man that could fulfill the law we cannot fulfill the law but he was one that fulfilled the law and when he had fast 40 days Satan came to him he knew that he had all authority and he said come on use some of your Authority you could speak to those stones and they'd be bred you're hungry enough you fasted long enough but Jesus said man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God when he was your nurse he did the work of a servant he said to his disciples I have become among you as a servant and his serving was completely voluntarily it was not forced to it nobody forced him to do what he did but he did it out of love he did it for you and me now nobody wants to be a servant that's against human nature right that's against human nature and Ashley I don't want to be a servant but I also don't like being served that that's just one thing you know sometimes I go someplace especially in Africa and people kind of want to carry my back I don't like that I tell them I won't have anyone carry my back the only persons I admit the honor to care of my back is my own Sons but I just don't I just don't like it and I don't want to be a servant but I also don't want to be served at least not in the human sense but Christ by his own will he became a servant a servant for you and for me a servant to help us a servant to save us and we can see how different that nature was from that of Adam Adam was a ruler God said rule over this Earth be the ruler but to Christ he said be the servant what a difference in nature what a difference in office Christ becoming the perfect servant Adam was lured away from the place of obedience but Christ never was he always stayed in the place of obedience now it says if you buy a Hebrew servant he Shall Serve for you six years now it's six years in here is the work of man God created the Heaven and Earth in six days and then he rested so the work that Christ was to do was to serve Humanity serve us and then foreign it says then you can go free [Music] see the question is what is about us whom do we belong to the owner of man is God a lot of times we don't realize we are owned we are property property of God and God has a right to do with us as he pleases and because we are the property of God we owe to God as our creator say that about Titus when you pay your ties you haven't given God anything you just paid what was his is very simple when you live in an apartment you pay the rent right but the rent owns is for the all is the person that is the apartments it's not that you give them something it's not a gift that you do you just pay what is his now God made this body and that body was given strength to work so now when we work and God blesses the words of our hands and we make money then this comes from the body that he made so that 10 percent is just his because he made you you know we don't have to beg for money that's not the point but it's just realizing ties this is God's that's not what you give to God it's just his portion if you don't give it you rob him offerings is what you give to God that's different but man owes to God unqualified surrender total submission and the unconditional obedience to his known will we oh God to follow every line of scripture that we know of every commandment and the will of God is expressed in the book that he gave us and we have been called to observe the word and that's why he said You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and your neighbor as yourself but none of the descendants of Adam ever was able to fulfill it all and that's what made the whole world guilty now when Jesus came he came to the place to honor God in a place where he was Dishonored constantly the whole world Dishonored God that was believer and non-believer just the same every time we sin we dishonor God and we know no matter the greatest man in the Bible they dishonor God their walk was never perfect but now the Lord Jesus came to that place of Dishonor to honor God to show that there could be someone that would honor God in everything that he does that there was pleasing of God in every action and every move he did nothing that ever displeased the father but he always pleased the father in all his actions in all his deeds and all his words and all his thoughts in all his prayers whatever Christ did he pleased father he wants that perfect servant I want to read here Galatians chapter 4 and I'll have to read a lot of scripture because that I can make the points clear better I want to read Galatians chapter four and it says here in verse 4 but when the fullness of time was come God send forth his son made of a woman made under the law which means he was put under the law that's the interesting thing now the law Giver he puts himself just under the law that he had given himself what a difference to the human law givers we see it in politics they make a law they want you to be subject to the law but they'll never be subject to that law themselves right amen that's the truce the law givers in our in our economy the law Giver is always above the law because he made the law so he said if I made it I can break it but though there's caught the perfect law giver and now he comes and subjects himself to the law that he himself had written he applied that law to himself what a difference to the man that make laws down here see and that is what he did he was put under the law and that's why he said in Matthew 5 17. do not think that I've come to abolish the law or the prophets I am not come to dissolve but I come to fulfill the law he fulfilled the law to the letter and if we could just understand enough of the Old Testament we could see how the old Old Testament how the law of Moses was fulfilled in Jesus Christ many times we think yeah we live in the Covenant of Christ that is true but yet God has a law and the law needs to be fulfilled the law did not come and sing and when we read the passage where he says I come not to abolish I come not to dissolve I come to fulfill that's what he said and that's what he did now the law of God was in his heart he pondered about it day and night from beginning to the end in thought in word or deed he kept the law every demand that God had a man was completely fulfilled by the perfect man the king every claim of God was completely upheld Christ was the only man that ever fully completed every human responsibility that man had to God but now the word says on the seventh day he can go free okay now Christ did not need to go to Calvary the law says he could have gone free he completed the perfect service before he went to the cross you say brother Bernard where did you get this I get this from the Mount of transfiguration because when he stood on the Mount of transfiguration God bore Witness that he was well pleased by the service God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased why was God well pleased because Christ had fulfilled the law to the DOT God had no more claim on him Christ could have walked out free that is why they saw the prefiguring of the coming of the Lord see if we go let's go over to II Peter well I want to read these things from scripture so that you don't say brother Bernard said it see second Peter chapter one verse 16. for we have not followed cunningly devised Fables when we made known unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were eyewitness of his majesty for he received from God the Our Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I have I am well pleased on the Mount of transfiguration God himself said the service is completed your work as a servant is finished because he got from the father honor and Glory the six days of Labor the six years had been over on that day but now let us go back to Exodus and see what the scriptures is I just love because it's such a wonderful type of the ministry the work of Jesus Christ for his bride he said no and in the sevens he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then with his wife hell he shall go out with him if his master have given him a wife and she have borne his same Sons and Daughters his wife and her children shall be her Masters and he shall go out by himself while he was here working God gave him a wife and children but if he would have gone without going to Calvary they would have remained the Masters see his master not he he did not take himself a wife he did not come with the wife into this world but the father had given him and that is awesome in Scripture where it says in Hebrews 2 the children that God had given me see he received a wife and children from the master but if he would have left at the point when the service itself was complete he would have never been able to keep the wife and the children that God gave him can you see how he how he's walking now to fulfill the law but then it says and and you watch the order and if the master shall plainly say I love my master the love of God was first he first loved the father but he said and then my wife and my children that's the next thing and he says I will not go out free then his master shall bring him to the judges and shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bores Easter with vowel and he shall serve him forever now this is what he did when he went to Gethsemane he he knew he didn't have to do it he said father if this cop could pass but not my will but thy will shall be done that's when his ear was pierced that he absolutely subjected to the father even unto this now here's a difference as a servant you can subject to service you give your labor to the master the master gets your strengths but the master does not get your life but here the perfect servant he came and he he not only gave the service to the master but he gave his life to the master he gave his life for you and me to get to Ransom us because God had given him a wife and children and that's why he said I love my master I love my wife I love my children I'm going to be a servant forever kind of walk away I fulfill the law to the dot I go to the end now if his servant remains in the house of the master finally I'm talking I'm talking naturally now finally he gonna be the heir of all things never realized in the natural so he doesn't say that the master had a son he had his servants but in the natural if the servant decides to remain in the house of the master forever he become the heir of all things but see he first had to die the corn of wheat must first fall into the ground round because if it does not fall into the ground and die it will abide by itself see Jesus was speaking of himself he knew that he first had to die if he would have not died he would have remained alone but he died so that he could Ransom those which were predestinated by the grace of God see the perfection of the servant of God was there to show the difference between Christ and the sinful man just to show it even clearer and when he said I love my Lord my wife and my children I will not go free where did he bring him he brought him to the doorpost when he pierced the ear the blood started flowing look back to Moses put the blood on the doorpost I just love these Connections in Scripture God always using the same type he renounced his Liberty he was fully entitled to it but he showed the love of God that's what it was he loved the master his master he loved his wife and he loved his children and let me go back to what I just said where he says in Matthew to all John 12 message 17 he said the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified verily verily I say unto you unless the grain of wheat falls in the ground it dies it remains alone and then he adds but if it dies it Bears much fruit but notice what follows he said now my soul is troubled what shall I say it's the moment of decision see that servant had to made a decision the time came he could be free but now he had to make a decision and I believe that when you're taking the natural any man that is a servant for six years the decision to stay or to go is not made likely he's going to ponder about it he's going to think about it he's going to reflect on what the consequences are and that's why he says now my soul is troubled how shall I decide and he says what shall I say shall I say father save me from this hour and then he answered his own question he said but for this cause I have come to this hour father glorify thy name why did he say that love Beyond understanding All Is Love he put entirely at the service of his beloved no matter what the terrible hour contained he knew it all he knew what was going to happen so that love it caused him to do a service that the law had not imposed on him see the first six years that was keeping the law but when he went to Calvary that was not what the law had required that he did by his free will serving walking the ministry eating the sick I'm raising the dead casting out demons spreading the love of God that boss of the law had required but the claw never required him to go to Calvary he did that by his own free will there was nothing that forced him God himself by his old juicing choose to die for you and for me hallelujah what can we say more what a great God do we serve [Applause] amen that's what we have to see God looked for someone more righteous than the children of man and he sure was and his motivation was always to be that perfect servant even when Lazarus was on the brink of dying when he got sick now in the natural if a friend of ours gets sick we're not going to wait two or three days we're going to try to get to him as fast as we can amen that's the truth you know we some of our friends is really in need we're not going to wait and Jesus if he would have done his own will he would have went when they called him but he realized that the master the father had another plan he didn't want to be glorified just by healing he wanted to be glorified by Resurrection that's how he subjected himself that's why he stayed two or three more days now what about us we all also service to our maker or not of Our Own we're also Servants of the master because in Philippians in verse in chapter 2 verse 5 it says let the mind be in you which was also in Christ see and then he goes on to say that he became obedient and was made a servant now if Christ was made a servant for us we are to be servants for Christ and for one another a lot of times we forget that but God had given him a bride God had given him children he did not want to lose those he wanted to keep those and it's quite interesting that Jesus addressed his disciples always as his disciples but after he rose from the grave he did not call them disciples anymore he said to Mary go tell my brethren see now they were part of the family now they became his brethren because now he had paid the full price now he would stay in the house forever he would never walk away and he has delivered us and that's what he's done on Calvary that's why he had his ears pierced that's why he became the Lamb of God to be sprinkled on the doorpost and whenever the blood was sprinkled it kept the hand of God away no more judgment and we know that the love of Christ it was not limited just to a bride just to people from Nations but he also had Israel in his mind everyone that was predestinated he had them you see it said he will become a servant forever not thinking about that God our God becoming a servant to us forever yes that's what he said now after he was risen from the dead Thomas said I will not believe unless I can see the marks and what did Jesus say he said come fill my hand and the Marx was still there come feel my side and the Mark was still there he kept bearing the mark of being a servant even after the resurrection and today He's Still the Lamb of God because John turned and he saw a lamb as it was written or slain before the foundation of the world thinking that our God remains that servant and he's speaking about the kingdom and he said blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he comes will find watching truly I say unto you he will geared himself and set them at the table and will come out and serve them fulfilling the law of God in eternity that is to come a law that never changed and that would have said this morning may have been new to you you might have never seen that scripture in that way but I can say by scripture that Christ fulfilled it all he fulfilled that Hebrew servant's life he fulfilled the law for you and for me and all that we can do today is rejoice and be glad because he came to save us he fulfilled the law that we could never fulfill and he pleased the father on our behalf and the father gave him the wife and children which we are today all the Blessed people I trust that I was able to paint the picture of Christ this morning before your eyes that you would Rejoice more in what he has done for you that you would love him more for what he's done that you could see more of his grace and that is why I love to preach on Christ because he is the center of our attraction he's the center of our face he's the center of our life he's the center of our church service that's what we are we are a christ-centered church he is in the middle of our congregation he's here to save us he's here to heal us he's here to deliver us because he still serves us with the gifts that was given to him praise the name of the Lord let us stand only father Lord Jesus larvae thank you for your word this morning
