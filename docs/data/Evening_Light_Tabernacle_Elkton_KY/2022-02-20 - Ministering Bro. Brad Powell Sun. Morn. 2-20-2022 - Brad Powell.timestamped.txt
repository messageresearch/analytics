[19:15] well forever
[19:36] [Music]
[19:43] [Music]
[19:47] or
[20:01] spreading himself like a green day tree
[20:24] the salvation of the righteousness
[20:39] um
[20:59] you know
[21:00] why
[21:10] a lot of times we let our human emotions
[21:12] take over
[21:43] way the true prices are going
[21:45] there's no guarantee with the propane b
[21:48] come back september they'll probably
[21:50] have to come
[21:51] just this winter and cause the fans that
[21:54] will not shut the world
[22:04] for the church
[22:06] i was
[22:07] thinking this morning in my office
[22:09] and um
[22:20] [Music]
[22:24] on the bottom you know there's four
[22:26] chapters from the bible or a hashtag
[22:29] that he had you read
[22:32] and then we had a one of the
[22:34] one of the chapters was back in genesis
[22:37] where jacob is
[22:39] putting the blessing upon joseph's
[22:41] children and then
[22:42] the blessings he's gonna put on the
[22:44] child for israel and then
[22:46] the other one was in christ
[22:48] the 13th chapter
[22:50] but as i was reading through
[22:52] i uh
[22:54] i jumped up to the uh
[22:58] to the 17th chapter
[23:01] uh
[23:03] and uh
[23:04] i was reading the 16th chapter by the
[23:06] night
[23:17] you know basically when the chips are
[23:19] down
[23:20] and everything is against you that's
[23:22] when you really find out who you are now
[23:25] the difference between a man and humble
[23:27] and righteous
[23:29] that he'll see himself with who he
[23:30] really is
[23:32] vain
[23:34] and
[23:46] but when everything's going against you
[23:48] that's when you really find out who you
[23:50] are and what you're actually made of
[23:52] and the first you can make a difference
[23:54] whether you're a person
[23:56] where you really find out who you are
[23:58] and what your source of strength is and
[24:00] what you're going to run to
[24:02] to be safe on that day
[24:05] and uh
[24:06] and i was thinking of
[24:08] this chapter here in the 16th chapter of
[24:10] the second chronicles now
[24:14] became
[24:17] israel and he had great victory in the
[24:19] chapter of prior over the ethiopians and
[24:22] his father
[24:23] had a great victory over the northern
[24:25] tribes
[24:27] you know he seen his father recovery god
[24:29] gave him a victory over the ethiopian
[24:41] [Music]
[24:44] against is grandma to intent that he
[24:47] might
[24:48] let none go out or come in the age of
[24:51] kingdom two
[24:52] so the king of liberal again is
[24:54] exercising
[24:55] trying to subdue jesus and goes on to
[24:58] say and atha brought out the silver belt
[25:02] out of the church of the house of the
[25:04] lord and got the king sauce and said
[25:07] ahead of the kingdom of syria that's why
[25:11] by yourself
[25:16] israel
[25:18] this man just came here he went to the
[25:20] lord but when the king of israel was
[25:22] about to come out and he forgot all that
[25:25] and he
[25:26] suspected himself he ran to someone
[25:29] else's protection instead of god
[25:33] sometimes we can be the same way but we
[25:35] always pray before we
[25:37] make when things are really bad in your
[25:38] life whether it's violence whatever
[25:43] before you make a decision that might
[25:45] affect you and your family from years to
[25:47] come and now he goes on and goes on
[25:50] here it says there's a link between me
[25:52] and me
[25:53] and that was between my father that i
[25:56] was like silver
[26:01] so far
[26:23] he left off brother brown on by his
[26:24] fourth season
[26:26] and age of the king took all of jesus
[26:28] card away the stones around him and
[26:30] attempted their own word
[26:32] of the building he built there with even
[26:37] and at that time random the seer came as
[26:39] the kingdom of judah and set up and this
[26:42] is where it gave correction
[26:44] here
[26:45] um
[26:46] because i was relying on the king of
[26:48] syria i'm not relying on the kingdom of
[26:50] the lord thy god therefore is the host
[26:53] the kingdom of syria escaped out of
[26:54] thine hands we're not the ethiopians and
[26:58] the libyans of you
[27:00] with very many
[27:01] insurance and horsemen yes
[27:04] because rely on the lord he delivered
[27:07] them into thine hands for the eyes of
[27:10] the lord on to approach throughout the
[27:12] world he showed himself strong on behalf
[27:15] of those whose heart is perfect
[27:18] here it goes
[27:25] [Music]
[27:32] he made a big mistake but we have good
[27:34] examples too if you just turn to mark
[27:38] three
[27:39] that was one of the chapters in that
[27:40] devotional this morning and you know
[27:43] sometimes we forget that jesus was a man
[27:46] you know he was i'm not saying he was
[27:48] like me or like you but he still was a
[27:50] man he had the same emotions that we had
[27:53] he had you know the same feelings that
[27:55] we had and uh
[27:57] if you turn her
[27:58] on the third
[28:01] i'm chapter
[28:01] to start about uh about the 20th verse
[28:04] in here he he said
[28:07] he said dracula 12
[28:09] and then as we get to the end of the
[28:10] chapter he
[28:13] he's talking to these people here and
[28:16] i'll start without the point at first
[28:19] and the multiple come together again so
[28:21] they just not so as much deep breath
[28:24] when his friends heard of it they went
[28:26] out the way and hold of him but they
[28:28] said he didn't tired
[28:30] so his very friends his very family
[28:33] didn't believe him and he goes on to say
[28:36] good and the scribes first came down
[28:38] from jerusalem and said he had a book
[28:41] and by the prince of devil's
[28:43] he out of heaven and he called on for
[28:45] them on the end and he said after them
[28:48] in parables
[28:49] i wasn't safe and passed out of satan
[28:51] there was a kingdom be divided against
[28:52] yourself that kingdom cannot stand
[28:55] and if i have
[28:59] you know that's you know if you think of
[29:01] it in your own family
[29:03] and you're all alive
[29:05] in your own city your own country when
[29:07] people don't live in unity and feed
[29:09] together there's no way they can stand
[29:11] and those are you know
[29:13] it applies to everything with you you're
[29:16] either at heat with people or you're at
[29:18] war
[29:19] and when you're at war with people when
[29:21] you can't get along with people then
[29:23] that's when you start having problems
[29:28] [Music]
[29:40] [Music]
[30:06] very last thing through all things shall
[30:08] we be given up friends of men
[30:10] and bless the words to wherever they
[30:12] shall bless him but he that shall
[30:14] blaspheme against the holy ghost
[30:18] have never forgiven us but he's
[30:21] eternal domination
[30:23] and then i was going to jump over here
[30:28] i don't want to say that a lot i'm going
[30:29] to say that's what i always said
[30:31] but i was going to jump over here to
[30:34] the
[30:53] you know wherever we are whatever we
[30:55] become it's all based on our
[30:58] relationship
[31:00] you know
[31:02] you have to totally convince himself
[31:04] and i was going to read intimidation
[31:06] before uh
[31:09] where paul tossed timothy and said
[31:12] you know i have probably tried to faith
[31:14] and i have finished my course and that's
[31:16] the way it should be for us you know on
[31:18] our on whatever graduation day it is
[31:21] whether it's the bachelor will be going
[31:23] to greater that's what we want to be
[31:25] able to say just like paul said that we
[31:28] thought
[31:29] and
[31:31] and as i see the world i'm going to talk
[31:33] about it anymore
[31:35] you can't make love with it anymore you
[31:38] you know you can come every day or every
[31:40] week and you just get worse
[31:42] and the only thing that you'll have is
[31:43] your very
[31:44] foundation of who you are as a christian
[31:47] and as a man or a woman that's your
[31:49] foundation who you are in christ so the
[31:52] world might get worse things might get
[31:55] it doesn't make a difference if you're
[31:57] in pride
[31:58] you know you can't worry about it you
[31:59] have to listen to things but the only
[32:02] thing i would say is i want to be able
[32:04] to have that testimony on that day
[32:06] that you know just my fault
[32:09] that i finished the cost and i just
[32:13] i can think for today that we're in we
[32:15] all have to be faithful

[51:39] talked about the condition of the world
[51:41] and
[51:42] i just always try to remember
[51:45] what brother brenham said
[51:46] one more sign
[51:48] and
[51:50] a friend of mine had put on there what
[51:52] all ukraine meant and how they were and
[51:55] all different kind of things and one of
[51:57] the things i mentioned
[51:59] was
[52:00] they mentioned was oil and i always
[52:02] remember brother branham said you watch
[52:04] russia when they go after that oil and i
[52:06] thought lord
[52:07] help us to be ready to go
[52:09] when the time comes and lord help our
[52:12] children
[52:14] that don't know you lord
[52:16] help them to understand that one of
[52:18] these days it's all going to be over and
[52:20] i tell my son sometimes
[52:22] and i know he gets tired of hearing me
[52:24] but i say
[52:25] it's not going to get any better
[52:28] i said because it's time to go home
[52:31] this is not our home
[52:34] they say where i belong this morning and
[52:37] amen and i i think about that song that
[52:39] brother sean sang the other morning and

[52:44] lord there's a longing in our hearts
[52:46] this morning to go home

[1:04:00] well if you're not i hope you will be by
[1:04:01] the end of service we'll ask you again
[1:04:04] then that'll be all for the music
[1:04:06] um i want to look at
[1:04:08] a couple of thoughts this morning and if
[1:04:10] you want to be turning in your bible
[1:04:11] we'll look at a quick little verse there
[1:04:13] in zechariah
[1:04:15] zechariah 4 and 6
[1:04:20] and it really has nothing to do with the
[1:04:23] direction i'm going with my
[1:04:24] with my stories today and my thoughts
[1:04:27] but
[1:04:28] it
[1:04:28] it's what i think should be the
[1:04:30] believer's
[1:04:31] motto i guess we would say you know i
[1:04:34] don't know if you've noticed
[1:04:35] but over the past
[1:04:37] uh i guess month and a half about a
[1:04:40] month and a half ago we we had some
[1:04:42] pretty hard preaching going on in church
[1:04:44] and uh
[1:04:45] it uh it got a little bit rough and some
[1:04:48] of us went home with bruised egos and
[1:04:50] hurt toes and
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:53] scorched hind ends and
[1:04:55] call it what you want i told joelis one
[1:04:56] day and i told brother byler i told her
[1:04:58] this i said uh i told josh i said we're
[1:05:00] he's either gonna preach us
[1:05:02] to where we need to be or we're gonna
[1:05:04] preach us away from church
[1:05:07] because he was getting hard and and but
[1:05:09] you know what you know
[1:05:10] you ask why do preachers preach so hard
[1:05:12] why why do you
[1:05:14] hound us why do you why do you do that
[1:05:16] why do you get in our in our business
[1:05:18] because we love you
[1:05:22] if if
[1:05:23] if you're not being chastised by god
[1:05:26] listen to me
[1:05:27] you need to question your experience
[1:05:31] because you know that you know as well
[1:05:33] as i do that we have to have that
[1:05:36] guideline put down before that we can be
[1:05:38] able to to know what righteousness is
[1:05:42] you look at the life of david and
[1:05:44] i was looking in pilgrim's progress
[1:05:46] there and and john but bunyan that wrote
[1:05:48] that book he said a man does not know
[1:05:50] the nature of his law
[1:05:52] cannot nature of the law cannot know the
[1:05:54] nature of sin
[1:05:56] and when you look at david the life of
[1:05:58] david
[1:06:00] do you know that david broke every one
[1:06:01] of the ten commandments
[1:06:04] with one act
[1:06:07] david broke every one of the ten
[1:06:08] commandments he sinned with bathsheba he
[1:06:11] broke everyone he coveted his neighbor's
[1:06:13] wife he lived a lie he stole her he
[1:06:15] committed adultery he murdered her
[1:06:17] husband he dishonored his parents
[1:06:20] thus he broke the remaining four
[1:06:22] commandments and referenced a
[1:06:24] relationship with god
[1:06:27] yeah and we wonder why we have to have
[1:06:30] law why we have to have preachers preach
[1:06:31] hard why we have to have
[1:06:33] somebody to come in and tell us where
[1:06:34] we're wrong
[1:06:36] can you imagine if nathan had come to
[1:06:38] him and said
[1:06:39] told him the story about the one who
[1:06:41] stole the sheep and so forth if he'd
[1:06:42] come to him when he told him he said
[1:06:44] it's you lord it's you david
[1:06:47] what if he'd come to him and said but
[1:06:50] god's a good god
[1:06:53] god's a gracious god
[1:06:55] there's been other people done the same
[1:06:57] things you've done
[1:06:59] can you imagine what how the turn of
[1:07:01] events could have changed
[1:07:04] but it wasn't that it was when he told
[1:07:06] him and let him recognize that the law
[1:07:09] is what he had broken and then david
[1:07:12] could cry out lord i want righteousness
[1:07:16] i've done wrong i see myself in the word
[1:07:18] and i know i'm wrong forgive me
[1:07:21] and what did the prophet tell him you're
[1:07:23] forgiven
[1:07:25] but it could have went completely a
[1:07:27] different way
[1:07:29] you love the lord this morning
[1:07:30] let's read in zechariah
[1:07:33] and and
[1:07:35] that little thought come to me as i was
[1:07:36] studying and been reading some books and
[1:07:38] and different things and just thinking
[1:07:40] about sin and law and grace and mercy
[1:07:42] and man how all this has to tie together
[1:07:44] and i spoke a little bit of it last time
[1:07:47] but we look here in zechariah
[1:07:50] chapter 4 verse 6.
[1:07:53] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:07:55] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[1:07:57] zerubbabel
[1:07:59] saying not by might nor by power
[1:08:02] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:08:06] let's pray heavenly father we thank you
[1:08:08] lord for this day you've given us we
[1:08:09] thank you for all that you do for us for
[1:08:11] your love and your grace and your mercy
[1:08:13] that you show us continually on a daily
[1:08:16] basis lord but lord more than anything
[1:08:18] we thank you for salvation we thank you
[1:08:20] for forgiving us where we failed you
[1:08:22] lord jesus and we just asked or that
[1:08:24] you'd be in the service today in a
[1:08:26] special way we just ask that you be with
[1:08:28] those who couldn't be here but blessed
[1:08:30] brother byler as they'll be traveling we
[1:08:32] just asked your hand of mercy upon them
[1:08:34] lord jesus that your guardian angels
[1:08:36] would would be with them and bring them
[1:08:37] home safely we just asked that
[1:08:39] everything would be said and done today
[1:08:41] would be to bring honor and glory to you
[1:08:42] in jesus name we pray amen
[1:08:45] you can have your seats
[1:08:47] and uh looking at this little scripture
[1:08:50] my thought this morning and where i'm
[1:08:51] going
[1:08:52] i've got a pretty lengthy scripture
[1:08:54] reading to go with it but i thought you
[1:08:55] know what i i want to i want to know a
[1:08:58] scripture that i can place and embed
[1:09:00] into the head into the mind of the
[1:09:02] people this morning that would help them
[1:09:04] to recognize and realize the whole
[1:09:07] thought in the whole topic and i thought
[1:09:08] this is the believer's motto this has to
[1:09:11] be the believer's motto not by my not by
[1:09:14] power but by my spirit saith the lord
[1:09:16] when you look here in the book of
[1:09:17] zechariah
[1:09:19] you look at this little thought and you
[1:09:21] look at the word might
[1:09:23] and when you look at the word might
[1:09:24] there it's often translated as an army
[1:09:26] or a force or ability or an efficiency
[1:09:30] and it's associated with a human
[1:09:32] resource
[1:09:33] so god here is looking at that and it
[1:09:36] can also mean a financial means can be
[1:09:38] connected with it such as wealth so it's
[1:09:41] it's by their might and the term power
[1:09:44] it means a purposeful force firm
[1:09:46] resolution dynamic strength
[1:09:48] okay but what what what the the prophet
[1:09:51] is being told here that it's not by
[1:09:54] might
[1:09:55] it's not by power it's not by might
[1:09:58] it's not by anything
[1:10:00] that you can do because what has
[1:10:02] happened here in the book of zechariah
[1:10:05] is you've got the prophet here you've
[1:10:06] got zechariah and hagai on the scene at
[1:10:08] the same time
[1:10:10] and and hey god there he's pushing to
[1:10:12] for a rebuilding of the temple
[1:10:14] and zechariah he is he's looking to
[1:10:16] minister to those that are sinning and
[1:10:19] are away from god and he's trying to get
[1:10:20] him to turn from their sinful ways to
[1:10:22] get back to the word of god and live
[1:10:24] life a godly life
[1:10:26] and in his vision he sees a lamp stand
[1:10:30] and this lamp stand is a huge lamp stand
[1:10:33] bigger than what you could imagine and
[1:10:35] it's got olive trees planted beside it
[1:10:37] so it's continually being filled with
[1:10:38] the oil
[1:10:40] what does the all signify the spirit
[1:10:43] so here in this scripture right here
[1:10:44] when you see what this what this is
[1:10:46] saying it applies to us today because
[1:10:49] it's only saying that by the spirit of
[1:10:51] the lord can we do any kind of work
[1:10:54] only by the spirit of the lord can we do
[1:10:55] any kind of worship
[1:10:57] it's only by that spirit that they could
[1:10:59] accomplish rebuilding the temple and
[1:11:01] that they could accomplish getting
[1:11:02] people back to god and i thought that's
[1:11:04] got to be the believer's motto today not
[1:11:07] by might not by power but it's by your
[1:11:09] spirit lord that we do anything we do in
[1:11:13] life
[1:11:17] i want to speak to you this morning
[1:11:19] as i've gathered my notes together i've
[1:11:21] got i've got notes everywhere this
[1:11:23] morning so pray for me
[1:11:25] but i want to speak to you on the
[1:11:27] warrior within
[1:11:29] the warriors
[1:11:30] within
[1:11:32] think about that thought there
[1:11:34] brother brown was talking about them the
[1:11:36] children of israel in the wilderness and
[1:11:38] we're going to try to take our time this
[1:11:39] morning so bear with me
[1:11:42] the children of wilder the children of
[1:11:43] israel in the wilderness
[1:11:48] he said here they are in the wilderness
[1:11:49] on this journey
[1:11:50] and how they were saying this is no
[1:11:52] place of pomegranates this is no place
[1:11:55] to have grapes and figs
[1:11:57] you brought us out of egypt and we had
[1:11:59] pretty good home down there and here you
[1:12:01] brought us here to die in the wilderness
[1:12:03] without water without food or without
[1:12:06] anything and you brought us here and he
[1:12:08] said all of the evidence was against
[1:12:11] them
[1:12:12] he said here you have led us up to the
[1:12:15] side this little low river and now
[1:12:16] there's the springs in this little oasis
[1:12:18] just barely enough water for us to drink
[1:12:20] with and he says oh my listen now isn't
[1:12:24] that just the way the complainer does
[1:12:25] when he gets sick
[1:12:28] god is good as long as everything is
[1:12:30] good
[1:12:32] but when things start to go bad
[1:12:36] what is your perspective of god then
[1:12:37] that's what happens with these people
[1:12:39] they're complaining
[1:12:40] did you not bring us out into the
[1:12:42] wilderness from egypt and now you
[1:12:44] brought us into the wilderness to die
[1:12:45] and he said here we are we haven't got
[1:12:47] nothing to eat we haven't got no
[1:12:48] pomegranates and the only thing we're
[1:12:50] getting is just a little manna that's
[1:12:52] rained down at night time and you tell
[1:12:54] us that when the men come back
[1:12:57] it's going to be all in vain
[1:13:00] he said we've left our countries and we
[1:13:01] can't go back can you see these people
[1:13:04] it's an amazing scene he said our
[1:13:06] children are going to have to be raised
[1:13:08] in this kind of condition and the cities
[1:13:10] are all fancy over there and they run
[1:13:12] races of chariots around
[1:13:14] the wall tops
[1:13:20] we don't have nothing but just a few old
[1:13:22] pruning hooks
[1:13:23] and swords and things in our hands
[1:13:26] and look at that great army over there
[1:13:27] that opposition they're so big
[1:13:30] one of them could whip a dozen of us
[1:13:33] and he says listen to this isn't that
[1:13:35] the way the devil pictures it
[1:13:39] isn't that the way the devil pictures it
[1:13:41] that the devil will come and bring stuff
[1:13:43] up in your life and he'll blow up
[1:13:45] obstacles in front of your path he'll
[1:13:46] make mountains out of molehills things
[1:13:48] that we know god is more than able to
[1:13:50] conquer but satan blows it up in such a
[1:13:53] way and fashions it that we feel like
[1:13:54] we're unconquerable
[1:13:57] and that's what he's done to these
[1:13:58] people
[1:14:02] joshua
[1:14:04] he said i can see him standing there
[1:14:06] i love it when the prophet tells these
[1:14:08] stories
[1:14:09] i could see him standing there
[1:14:11] and caleb alone in his face all
[1:14:14] brightened up
[1:14:18] his face is all brightened up and says
[1:14:21] glory to god
[1:14:24] he's looking and sees the same thing the
[1:14:26] chariots running up on top of this wall
[1:14:28] talk and he's brightened up and just
[1:14:30] went and said glory to god we can take
[1:14:33] it anyhow
[1:14:36] listen to the story taking place here he
[1:14:39] says how are you going to take it he
[1:14:41] said it ain't how i'm going to take it
[1:14:42] it ain't my business to figure it out
[1:14:44] that's god
[1:14:47] and he said let me tell you he said god
[1:14:50] said it belongs to us so it's mine god
[1:14:53] said so
[1:14:55] repeat that with me it's mine god said
[1:14:57] so
[1:14:59] do you believe that this morning
[1:15:01] because we have to have the same mindset
[1:15:03] and the same thought of joshua and caleb
[1:15:06] as they look at these walls they don't
[1:15:08] look at them as in defeat
[1:15:10] follow me in numbers 13 as we read
[1:15:12] through this i'll skip down through some
[1:15:14] but follow along if you're taking notes
[1:15:17] and the lord spake to moses it said send
[1:15:19] thou men
[1:15:20] into the land of canaan which i give and
[1:15:23] which i give
[1:15:25] did you hear that
[1:15:27] which i give
[1:15:29] unto the children of israel
[1:15:31] skip on down to verse 17.
[1:15:33] so what is happening between 1 and 17 as
[1:15:36] moses has gathered up all the men of the
[1:15:38] tribes the twelve tribes of the children
[1:15:39] of israel brought them all together and
[1:15:40] said here's your commission
[1:15:42] and moses sends them out to the spy the
[1:15:44] land of canaan and said unto them get
[1:15:46] you up this way southward and go up into
[1:15:49] the mountain
[1:15:50] and see the land see the land to see
[1:15:53] what it is
[1:15:54] see the people that dwell there see if
[1:15:56] they're strong see if they're weak see
[1:15:58] if there's few see there's many
[1:16:03] and what the land is that they dwell in
[1:16:06] whether it be good or bad whether cities
[1:16:08] whether it's tents or in strongholds
[1:16:14] and what the land is whether it be fat
[1:16:15] or lean or whether there be wood they're
[1:16:17] in or not and whether you be of good
[1:16:19] courage and bring the fruit of the land
[1:16:22] now the time was the time of the first
[1:16:24] ripe grapes
[1:16:28] now this next statement blows
[1:16:30] our little in our little in finite minds
[1:16:35] we can't imagine and we can't fathom the
[1:16:38] next statement what happens here in the
[1:16:40] bible
[1:16:41] they came into the brook
[1:16:43] of ishkov this is verse 23
[1:16:46] and they cut down from thence a branch
[1:16:48] with one cluster of grapes
[1:16:51] and they buried
[1:16:53] between two upon a staff
[1:16:59] and they brought the pomegranates and
[1:17:01] the figs
[1:17:02] so you mean the very things
[1:17:05] that they were complaining they didn't
[1:17:06] have
[1:17:08] we don't have any grapes we don't have
[1:17:10] any pomegranates we don't have any figs
[1:17:12] there's nothing in this land we're
[1:17:13] drying up we only get a little manna and
[1:17:15] god says go over here and shout it out
[1:17:17] tell me what you see over here
[1:17:19] and they have to come back with two men
[1:17:22] on a pole with a cluster one cluster of
[1:17:24] grapes can you imagine the size of the
[1:17:26] cluster of grapes that takes two men to
[1:17:29] pack
[1:17:30] if they don't make a believer out of you
[1:17:32] you ain't a believer
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:37] there's no believing in you
[1:17:39] because let me tell you if two men come
[1:17:41] in here packing one cluster of graves
[1:17:42] i'm going to bow down to somebody
[1:17:46] god's going to know what i think
[1:17:52] and they returned
[1:17:54] verse 25 from searching the land after
[1:17:56] 40 days and when they came to moses and
[1:17:59] aaron and to all the congregation of the
[1:18:00] children of israel and to the wilderness
[1:18:02] of tehran to uh kadesh and brought
[1:18:05] backward unto them all into the
[1:18:07] congregation and showed them the fruit
[1:18:09] of the land
[1:18:11] look at here
[1:18:16] and they told him
[1:18:18] and said we come into the land where you
[1:18:20] sent us
[1:18:22] and surely it floweth with milk and
[1:18:23] honey
[1:18:24] and this is the fruit of it
[1:18:27] nevertheless
[1:18:29] follow with me now you'll see where
[1:18:30] we're going later nevertheless the
[1:18:32] people be strong that dwell in the land
[1:18:34] and the cities are walled and very great
[1:18:36] and moreover we saw the children of anec
[1:18:39] there the amalekites dwell in the south
[1:18:41] the hittites of the
[1:18:43] and the hittites and the jebusites and
[1:18:44] the amorites they dwell in the mountains
[1:18:46] and the canaanites they dwell by the sea
[1:18:48] by the coast of jordan oh my goodness
[1:18:50] enemies all around them
[1:18:54] enemies all around them
[1:18:58] and everything that they've stated up to
[1:18:59] this point you know what they you know
[1:19:01] how they assess the situation with their
[1:19:03] eyes
[1:19:06] they were looking through their natural
[1:19:08] eyes and said yeah there is grapes over
[1:19:10] there there is good things there but
[1:19:12] look at the giants
[1:19:13] look at look at those from anac
[1:19:15] descendants over there look at these
[1:19:17] people
[1:19:18] look at the enemies all around us
[1:19:24] and caleb
[1:19:26] steal the people before moses and said
[1:19:28] let us go up there once and possess it
[1:19:29] we're more well than able to overcome it
[1:19:36] and yet they brought up an evil report
[1:19:38] of the land which they had searched to
[1:19:39] the children of israel saying the land
[1:19:41] which we have gone and searched is a
[1:19:43] land that eateth up at its inhabitants
[1:19:46] and all the people we saw in are of
[1:19:47] great stature
[1:19:49] and there we saw giants the son of anach
[1:19:52] which come from the giants
[1:19:54] and we were in our own site as
[1:19:55] grasshoppers
[1:19:57] and so we were in their sight
[1:20:01] what an amazing story here we have of
[1:20:03] people
[1:20:04] a group of people
[1:20:07] that god called onto the scene and said
[1:20:09] i want you 12 to go over here you gather
[1:20:12] them up and i want you to go and i want
[1:20:13] you to look and tell me what you see
[1:20:15] and you've got these people that go over
[1:20:17] there and they're looking at the same
[1:20:19] landscape
[1:20:21] they're looking at the same city they're
[1:20:23] looking at the same enemies they're
[1:20:26] looking at the same uh fruits the same
[1:20:29] everything that's over there but yet
[1:20:31] there's two different outcomes
[1:20:33] there's two different ways that they're
[1:20:35] looking through this
[1:20:36] this story of joshua and caleb give us
[1:20:39] the keys and it gives us the strategies
[1:20:41] and the insight to learn how we can be
[1:20:43] on and how we can be courageous up in
[1:20:46] the in the lord and we face impossible
[1:20:48] situations in our life
[1:20:51] because to the natural eye brothers and
[1:20:53] sisters there was giants in that land
[1:20:57] there are giants in your land
[1:21:01] there's giants in the land this morning
[1:21:03] and they're not going anywhere
[1:21:06] and if you think you're going to live in
[1:21:07] a fairy tale where everything is good
[1:21:10] you're wrong
[1:21:12] because these giants are there and you
[1:21:14] may be facing some of these descendants
[1:21:15] of anac this morning
[1:21:17] and as you're sitting here and you may
[1:21:19] be facing and wondering how am i going
[1:21:20] to defeat this giant of a situation that
[1:21:23] i'm going through how am i going to
[1:21:25] climb over this wall that i can't get
[1:21:27] around how am i ever going to be
[1:21:29] victorious this morning
[1:21:32] because it looks like i can't win
[1:21:37] you ever felt that way
[1:21:40] no matter what i do i can't win
[1:21:45] thomas payne in 1776 said these are the
[1:21:48] times when
[1:21:49] they try men's souls
[1:21:54] you have to be able to look further than
[1:21:56] our own understanding when we examine
[1:21:57] our life in this way
[1:22:00] because in ourselves
[1:22:02] it don't go too good
[1:22:03] when our backs are pressed against the
[1:22:05] wall
[1:22:07] and you can feel satan
[1:22:09] his steamy breath down your neck
[1:22:14] you're not going to do nothing
[1:22:18] well you might think you will
[1:22:21] but you're not going to do nothing you
[1:22:24] need more than yourself
[1:22:26] you need more than what you have to give
[1:22:28] and when you're sitting there and
[1:22:30] and you look at it it's true today it's
[1:22:32] just the same it takes for us what does
[1:22:34] it take for us to become strong and
[1:22:35] courageous it takes god it takes for us
[1:22:38] when things are when we're scared to
[1:22:40] death
[1:22:43] to be able to stand there and fight
[1:22:47] john wayne said courage is being scared
[1:22:49] to death and saddling up anyway
[1:22:51] i thought that sounds pretty good
[1:22:54] it's looking at your enemies in life
[1:22:57] and saying i'm scared you you are so big
[1:23:00] you are such a giant in my life
[1:23:04] but i'm gonna go anyway
[1:23:07] i'm not going to sit here and let you
[1:23:08] continue to beat me and defeat me and
[1:23:10] put me down i'm going to go anyway why
[1:23:13] because we are chosen for this mission
[1:23:15] and i'm going to look at some men and
[1:23:17] women today that were chosen for the
[1:23:19] mission
[1:23:21] so here god is getting ready to take
[1:23:23] these israelites into the promised land
[1:23:27] and the pillar of fire has rested the
[1:23:29] cloud and rested
[1:23:31] and god is preparing to send them over
[1:23:33] into the promised land
[1:23:35] and give them what is theirs
[1:23:38] and here you have these two men joshua
[1:23:40] and caleb
[1:23:42] and they're going to go over there on
[1:23:43] this 40-day
[1:23:45] reconnaissance mission you might say
[1:23:48] they're going to go over there and
[1:23:49] they're going to scout it out
[1:23:52] with these other 10 men
[1:23:55] the difference is
[1:23:57] those other 10 men said we'll go over
[1:23:58] and see what's in that city
[1:24:01] joshua and caleb said we're going to go
[1:24:03] see what gods give us
[1:24:06] do you see the difference in the
[1:24:07] perspective
[1:24:09] we're going to go see what god give us
[1:24:12] because god has promised me this land
[1:24:15] god has promised us this and we've been
[1:24:17] told this since we were just little
[1:24:18] bitty boys we may be the youngest in
[1:24:20] this group of 12 men but i tell you god
[1:24:23] said it and i believe it
[1:24:27] two believed it
[1:24:30] ten doubted before they ever left the
[1:24:33] camp
[1:24:35] so if you think you're gonna come to
[1:24:36] church you get a blessing from god and
[1:24:38] you don't believe it
[1:24:40] you're going home empty
[1:24:43] if you think going to the next church
[1:24:44] camp or the next youth banquet you're
[1:24:46] going to go get something for god but
[1:24:48] you don't believe god it can really do
[1:24:50] something
[1:24:51] you're going to go home empty
[1:24:53] you have to believe before you go
[1:24:56] and here they come and they come back
[1:24:58] these these men come back with this bad
[1:25:00] report
[1:25:01] and they tell what they seen over there
[1:25:03] but yet they showed them the fruit of
[1:25:04] the land
[1:25:07] but they never accepted it as their own
[1:25:11] they never took ownership
[1:25:13] when they come back with that big cut a
[1:25:15] bunch that bunch of
[1:25:16] of grapes
[1:25:18] dragging between them
[1:25:21] they said oh look what they grow over
[1:25:23] there look what they
[1:25:24] do and joshua cole is saying
[1:25:28] we'll be full tonight
[1:25:30] we fix the need of the goodness
[1:25:32] because them's ours
[1:25:35] then people's working for us over there
[1:25:38] they're growing our grapes they're
[1:25:39] growing our pomegranates they're growing
[1:25:41] our eggs that's our city
[1:25:45] it's all in your perspective
[1:25:48] and so here they come and they tell them
[1:25:51] i said we went where you sent us kind of
[1:25:54] uh
[1:25:55] sarcastically
[1:25:57] moses we went where you sent us
[1:26:01] they got grapes
[1:26:02] they got milk they got honey they got
[1:26:05] goodness
[1:26:06] but their cities are fortified
[1:26:10] there's no getting into there
[1:26:12] and we saw the descendants of anac
[1:26:16] they're ten foot tall
[1:26:20] you realize that's where goliath came
[1:26:21] from
[1:26:25] they're huge
[1:26:27] here we are at our little 5-2 stature
[1:26:29] little israelite man
[1:26:32] they double us in size they're huge
[1:26:34] they've got to five cities
[1:26:43] i think it's amazing that they give the
[1:26:45] first thing they tell us how wonderful
[1:26:47] it was
[1:26:49] they tell how wonderful it was but still
[1:26:53] you see the trend here
[1:26:56] it flows with milk and honey and it's
[1:26:58] it's full of fruit
[1:26:59] nevertheless
[1:27:03] but
[1:27:07] how many of you've ever added
[1:27:08] nevertheless in your life
[1:27:12] god is able to do whatever whatever he's
[1:27:15] promised me nevertheless if i had a
[1:27:17] little more time if i had a little more
[1:27:19] money if i had a little more prayer life
[1:27:21] if i had a little more resources if i
[1:27:23] had a little more help if i had a little
[1:27:24] more back from the pastor
[1:27:32] i could do all these things through
[1:27:33] christ who strengthened me but
[1:27:37] nobody believes me
[1:27:41] nobody tells me how good i did when i
[1:27:43] preached
[1:27:45] i'm just kidding
[1:27:47] thank you thank you i thank you all for
[1:27:49] your compliments i really do they mean a
[1:27:51] lot every preacher appreciates them they
[1:27:53] may tell you they don't it don't matter
[1:27:54] but they appreciate it
[1:27:59] but you see what i'm saying
[1:28:01] these 12 men
[1:28:04] had been all slaves in egypt
[1:28:07] but 10 of them
[1:28:09] are defeated mentally
[1:28:12] they never got over what happened
[1:28:15] they never got over what happened that
[1:28:17] was their attitude of the ten these ten
[1:28:19] men ate the same manna they drank the
[1:28:21] same water they walked across the same
[1:28:24] red sea followed the same pillar of fire
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:29] think about this these people had seen
[1:28:31] it all and they were looking through
[1:28:32] their own eyes of understanding but you
[1:28:35] see god don't ask you to understand
[1:28:37] everything he asked you to believe
[1:28:39] everything
[1:28:41] that's the difference
[1:28:43] they tried to understand what they were
[1:28:45] seeing
[1:28:48] that's why the prophet said when there's
[1:28:49] something that goes on or you read
[1:28:51] something or somebody says something in
[1:28:52] his ministry and he said if you don't
[1:28:54] understand it what did he say just put
[1:28:55] it up on the shelf and leave it alone
[1:28:58] we don't have to understand everything
[1:29:00] let me tell you i will never
[1:29:02] understand everything you will never
[1:29:04] understand because we we just play a
[1:29:07] small portion in the mind of god
[1:29:10] of what he reveals to us
[1:29:16] and then there's caleb
[1:29:19] caleb stands there this believer and he
[1:29:21] quieted the people before moses
[1:29:25] they said let us go up there at once we
[1:29:28] are well able to take it
[1:29:31] because caleb knew the words of
[1:29:33] influence and he knew his words could
[1:29:35] influence the people so he basically
[1:29:36] said shut up
[1:29:39] you doubters you murmurers you planers
[1:29:42] shut up
[1:29:44] because i have a good report we are well
[1:29:46] able to overcome
[1:29:50] that is the profession of the believer
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:54] but you know joshua and caleb were
[1:29:56] probably the two youngest there
[1:29:59] and they've got these elders
[1:30:02] whoa whoa whoa boys
[1:30:07] you know i i really i really appreciate
[1:30:10] your experience
[1:30:12] i really appreciated the trip we took
[1:30:14] over there i like your ambition and all
[1:30:18] but you know we got a little bit more
[1:30:19] experience than what you've got
[1:30:22] and you know we're able to look over
[1:30:24] there and we're able to see that we
[1:30:26] can't go up against those people
[1:30:32] this land that we've gone through and
[1:30:34] sent these spies
[1:30:35] did you not see that it devours its
[1:30:38] inhabitants
[1:30:41] it devours its inhabitants
[1:30:44] you had to see that joshua well you had
[1:30:46] to notice that game you had to you had
[1:30:48] to see that that all the people are of
[1:30:50] great stature and they're giants
[1:30:57] it's impossible
[1:31:01] it's impossible boys because they're so
[1:31:04] much bigger than us
[1:31:06] they're stronger
[1:31:08] they're muscular
[1:31:11] they're warriors
[1:31:14] they swing swords and have spears
[1:31:26] but i want to remind
[1:31:27] you this
[1:31:28] morning as i thought about that thought
[1:31:31] i thought you know what that was true
[1:31:33] as they're looking over there there's a
[1:31:34] lot of truth to them
[1:31:36] and no doubt they had to see it the same
[1:31:37] as they did but the only thing they were
[1:31:39] looking through different eyes
[1:31:41] because you know this morning i want you
[1:31:42] to know that god still turns death into
[1:31:44] life
[1:31:46] god still opens blinded eyes god still
[1:31:49] opens the deaf ear god still makes the
[1:31:51] lame walk and he still parts the red sea
[1:31:54] but let me ask you
[1:31:55] how many of you are willing to put your
[1:31:57] foot in front of the other and walk
[1:31:59] across that red sea
[1:32:02] there's the difference
[1:32:03] there is the difference you have to be
[1:32:05] able to put one foot in front of the
[1:32:07] other because the bible says so a man
[1:32:09] thinks in his heart so is he
[1:32:15] so if i think i'm gonna walk over there
[1:32:17] and possess that
[1:32:19] you hear that
[1:32:21] that says possession
[1:32:23] because god told them everywhere that
[1:32:25] your feet hit everywhere the soles of
[1:32:28] your feet hit is yours
[1:32:31] and how you react to a situation
[1:32:33] significantly changes it
[1:32:37] are you an overcomer this morning
[1:32:42] be a prayer warrior this morning
[1:32:45] be a devil slayer this morning
[1:32:48] be an overcomer be victorious in the
[1:32:51] word of god today
[1:32:54] and this is not something that just
[1:32:55] happens overnight you you kind of learn
[1:32:57] this
[1:32:59] you had to learn that no matter what you
[1:33:01] go through
[1:33:05] god is
[1:33:06] bigger that god is bigger
[1:33:11] and you got to be what you can be for
[1:33:12] god
[1:33:13] be all you can be
[1:33:15] i don't know whose motto that is but be
[1:33:17] all you can be
[1:33:20] i can remember when i was younger
[1:33:23] and people come up and say
[1:33:25] brother brad pray for me and i'll be
[1:33:27] like okay
[1:33:30] and i would
[1:33:33] but was i sincere in it
[1:33:36] and i say it's learned because now i
[1:33:38] learn when people
[1:33:39] come up to you
[1:33:41] and say brother and so sister so-and-so
[1:33:43] will you pray for me
[1:33:45] they're not just saying that because
[1:33:46] they're going up and asking everybody
[1:33:48] they're saying that because they've got
[1:33:49] confidence in you
[1:33:51] they're saying that because they believe
[1:33:53] that you have a connection between you
[1:33:55] and god that god will hear your prayers
[1:33:58] and then i begin to realize that and i
[1:34:00] thought when somebody tells me that it's
[1:34:01] my duty i am duty bound
[1:34:04] and commissioned of god to go on my
[1:34:06] knees and pray for that people with
[1:34:08] diligency
[1:34:11] be a prayer warrior
[1:34:13] a devil slayer
[1:34:15] the prophet said 10 of them
[1:34:22] 10 of them said oh we can't take it
[1:34:23] they're like grasshoppers we're like
[1:34:25] grasshoppers
[1:34:27] but not that fellow no sir
[1:34:30] he said we're more than able to take it
[1:34:33] and listen what he says
[1:34:35] it depends on what you're looking at
[1:34:38] if you're looking at your crippled hand
[1:34:40] it'll just stay that way
[1:34:44] he said if you're looking at that tumor
[1:34:46] it'll just run that way
[1:34:49] he said it'll just stay the same
[1:34:52] but look away from that look at the
[1:34:54] promise of god it depends on what you're
[1:34:56] looking at because christians look at
[1:34:58] the unseen
[1:35:06] god told them
[1:35:09] way down in egypt he said i give you the
[1:35:11] land
[1:35:13] but here's where we jump in here
[1:35:18] i'll give you the land
[1:35:20] but the prophet said he didn't tell you
[1:35:21] i'd go sweep it all out garnish the
[1:35:23] houses hang up the curtains
[1:35:26] and just let you move in
[1:35:29] see that's the way it is a lot of times
[1:35:30] we want god to do something
[1:35:31] instantaneous for us we want god to give
[1:35:34] us right in the moment we don't want to
[1:35:35] work for it we don't want to go down and
[1:35:37] pray for it we don't want to seek and be
[1:35:39] diligently and get before god and say
[1:35:42] god you promised me this what do i have
[1:35:43] to do
[1:35:46] what is my part of this
[1:35:48] it's like brother danny talked about the
[1:35:49] guy on the boat
[1:35:53] the boat the rescue came to him twice
[1:35:56] but he was looking for god to do
[1:35:57] something big and here's exactly what
[1:35:59] they were doing they wanted it all right
[1:36:01] then but then that's when he said
[1:36:03] everywhere that your souls of your foot
[1:36:05] lands that's possession
[1:36:07] he said just keep fighting
[1:36:10] the devil says the days of miracles are
[1:36:12] passed you're lying tell the devil you
[1:36:15] are lying
[1:36:17] tell him
[1:36:20] we fail to tell satan what he needs to
[1:36:23] hear
[1:36:24] satan when he comes to you you tell him
[1:36:26] out loud satan you're a bluff
[1:36:28] satan you are a liar satan go back to
[1:36:31] the pits of hell where you belong
[1:36:33] because i am a child of god
[1:36:36] and god said it's mine you remember
[1:36:46] so they are these guys were these ten
[1:36:50] they see themselves as insignificant
[1:36:54] they see their enemies
[1:36:57] and they see that their enemies think
[1:36:58] they're insignificant
[1:37:02] look at how the negative report affected
[1:37:04] the whole congregation
[1:37:09] you want to get a church going in a good
[1:37:11] direction everything going good people
[1:37:13] being saved people giving their hearts
[1:37:15] people doing things for god and people's
[1:37:17] happy and the brother and sister just
[1:37:20] love everybody and the church is going
[1:37:22] good just get one person to start
[1:37:23] murmuring
[1:37:27] it says the congregation heard this and
[1:37:30] the congregation lifted up their voices
[1:37:32] and cried and the people wept that night
[1:37:38] they had a little pity party
[1:37:40] they had a little pity party we're
[1:37:41] doomed
[1:37:44] we'll just go back to egypt
[1:37:46] we're doomed
[1:37:48] but joshua and caleb
[1:37:51] they wouldn't quit
[1:37:53] they heard this
[1:37:54] they heard him crying and joshua and
[1:37:57] caleb said i've heard enough of this
[1:37:58] brother me too and they rent their
[1:38:00] clothes
[1:38:03] why was that they were signifying don't
[1:38:05] you people know who you are this is
[1:38:07] serious business we rent our clothes and
[1:38:09] listen to us we can take the enemy
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:18] and he told them this is our land
[1:38:21] it's ours god said he would delight for
[1:38:24] us to have it it's god's delight for us
[1:38:26] to have it and the protection of them of
[1:38:28] their
[1:38:29] soldiers it's gone it's ours all we got
[1:38:32] to do is go take it please
[1:38:35] let's go take it let's gather up let's
[1:38:37] gather up
[1:38:42] and then we have a happy ending right
[1:38:47] no he said the congregation want to take
[1:38:49] up stones and stone them
[1:38:55] god's man
[1:38:57] and the congregation wants to take up
[1:38:59] stones
[1:39:00] and stone them
[1:39:02] brother and sister that congregation had
[1:39:04] more faith in the enemy in fear
[1:39:08] they had more faith in the enemy
[1:39:11] than the faith in the god they should be
[1:39:13] trusting
[1:39:15] did you hear what i said
[1:39:17] more faith in the enemy which is fear
[1:39:21] than in the god they should have been
[1:39:23] trusting
[1:39:29] and the people said if only we would
[1:39:31] have died
[1:39:33] in the wilderness
[1:39:37] if only we would have died in the
[1:39:40] wilderness
[1:39:45] can't you hear those whiny voices
[1:39:51] i got a problem
[1:39:53] with people who claim to be believers
[1:39:55] and are whiny
[1:40:03] so i ain't got no time for whiners
[1:40:08] and here they are whining
[1:40:12] we should just
[1:40:14] go back to age
[1:40:20] and god sent us out here and he's gonna
[1:40:22] kill us all our children look at our
[1:40:23] children
[1:40:25] whiny big babies
[1:40:29] let me ask you this
[1:40:31] do you know what god promised to us is
[1:40:38] hold on to your seats
[1:40:40] he promised you one thing
[1:40:48] salvation and people wonder why
[1:40:52] believers
[1:40:54] nominal christians
[1:40:56] fall away day after day after day
[1:41:00] by the hundreds by the thousands
[1:41:04] because we tell them that god is a god
[1:41:06] of love
[1:41:08] god is a god of grace
[1:41:10] god is a god of abundance
[1:41:13] god is a god of blessings
[1:41:17] and he is
[1:41:18] he's every one of those
[1:41:22] but it doesn't say he's going to have
[1:41:23] you're going to have it all the time
[1:41:26] and people lead people to christ
[1:41:29] trying to tell him that if you come to
[1:41:30] god he's going to be great
[1:41:34] life is grand our businesses are blessed
[1:41:37] our homes are blessed
[1:41:40] we're happy all the time and me and my
[1:41:42] wife never had a
[1:41:44] spat wake up wake up
[1:41:51] but god said i'll give you salvation
[1:41:54] that's what has to hold us
[1:41:57] that's what has to hold us as believers
[1:41:59] is that we look and we say no matter
[1:42:01] what comes our way no matter if i'm
[1:42:03] drinking soda water and crackers no
[1:42:05] matter what comes my way i'm still going
[1:42:07] to serve god because he died for me on
[1:42:10] that cross
[1:42:15] brother and sisters god wanted all of
[1:42:17] the children of israel to go in that day
[1:42:21] it was his desire for every one of them
[1:42:23] to go in and we see it all through the
[1:42:25] bible john 3 16 says for god so loved
[1:42:28] the world
[1:42:29] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:42:31] what whosoever
[1:42:36] could believeth in him should not perish
[1:42:42] no doubt he told those children of
[1:42:43] israel it's yours if you just believe
[1:42:46] you shall not perish but do you know
[1:42:48] what happened to them
[1:42:50] everyone
[1:42:52] over the age of 20.
[1:42:55] that
[1:42:55] [Applause]
[1:42:58] joshua and caleb
[1:43:00] started the new
[1:43:02] children of israel
[1:43:04] because everybody over the age of 20
[1:43:08] died they wandered for years and years
[1:43:13] and years
[1:43:15] because of rebellion because of unbelief
[1:43:19] for 40 years they wandered for years
[1:43:21] until all 20
[1:43:23] year olds and above
[1:43:25] had perished
[1:43:30] all because of a little giant
[1:43:34] notice i said a little giant
[1:43:37] because it's all in our perspective
[1:43:40] of what we see
[1:43:44] i want to read next out of judges
[1:43:47] chapter six
[1:43:49] and as we go into
[1:43:50] judges i want to look at a thought here
[1:43:55] in the book of judges i'll tell you
[1:43:57] where he's going to look at men and
[1:43:58] women
[1:44:01] i've got one of the most revered women
[1:44:03] in the bible i'm fixing to tell you
[1:44:04] about
[1:44:08] the book of judges takes place after
[1:44:10] joshua's death
[1:44:12] so there was no leader amongst the
[1:44:13] children of israel so god begins to put
[1:44:16] a judge in place
[1:44:17] 12 different judges one of the women
[1:44:20] that you know of and you've heard the
[1:44:22] name is deborah
[1:44:24] so she was one of the prophetess and one
[1:44:26] of the judges in the in the for the like
[1:44:28] for the tribe of israel
[1:44:31] but the children of israel could not
[1:44:33] keep their position
[1:44:35] and that's why god had to give them
[1:44:37] judges
[1:44:38] they would get themselves up and they
[1:44:39] would do good and they would be good
[1:44:41] they would serve god for a while and
[1:44:42] then the next thing you know they would
[1:44:43] give over into the ways of the land they
[1:44:45] would give over to the gods that was
[1:44:47] around and they couldn't find himself so
[1:44:49] god would send a judge
[1:44:51] and he would clean up the mess
[1:44:53] over and over the book of judges is a
[1:44:55] brutal book
[1:44:58] when you read the book of judges you get
[1:45:00] ready for a horror scene
[1:45:03] people are getting their thumbs cut off
[1:45:07] people's being impaled
[1:45:09] blood's being shed
[1:45:13] and everybody wants to believe god's
[1:45:15] just a god of love
[1:45:18] let me tell you god is a warrior
[1:45:21] you look all through the bible from the
[1:45:23] beginning to the end god is a warrior
[1:45:25] even in the book as he comes back in the
[1:45:27] book of revelation on a wide horse
[1:45:30] with a sword from his mouth what is that
[1:45:33] he's a warrior
[1:45:35] god will always take care of business
[1:45:39] but here over in the book of judges
[1:45:41] i'll tell you this little story about
[1:45:42] this woman i like you don't hear many
[1:45:44] stories in the bible about women
[1:45:46] but i just want you to know god has
[1:45:48] women too
[1:45:50] that are warriors
[1:45:53] so the children of israel deborah tells
[1:45:55] the children of israel the warriors of
[1:45:57] the children of israel you've got to go
[1:45:58] out and you've got to fight these
[1:45:59] canaanites
[1:46:01] and you've got to go out there and
[1:46:02] you've got to slay them
[1:46:04] so they go after they go out to slay the
[1:46:06] two of the canaanites and as they go out
[1:46:08] there to slay them though the war takes
[1:46:11] place and everybody dies and the
[1:46:12] children of israel are victorious but
[1:46:14] there was one general that got away
[1:46:19] sister i think was his name
[1:46:22] and he got away and you know what he did
[1:46:25] he tried to weasel his way in
[1:46:27] to the camp of the children of israel
[1:46:31] and he comes in and he weasels his way
[1:46:34] in
[1:46:35] to jail's tent
[1:46:40] and jl was a tent maker
[1:46:43] she knew how to construct the tent she
[1:46:44] knew how to take them down when they
[1:46:46] moved it was her job to dismantle these
[1:46:47] tents reapply and put them back up she
[1:46:50] wove the coverings out of goat hair so
[1:46:52] she was a strong handed woman with her
[1:46:55] hands
[1:46:57] and this man comes in
[1:46:59] to her home
[1:47:01] which is
[1:47:02] not acceptable
[1:47:05] because she was the only one there and
[1:47:07] this man comes in and he gets in there
[1:47:09] and he says i'm gonna hide here
[1:47:15] and jl knows all the men are out to war
[1:47:18] and she's all alone
[1:47:20] she knows who this guy is
[1:47:23] but she refuses to accept any dishonor
[1:47:27] upon her home
[1:47:30] this was a woman who if this man had
[1:47:32] wanted he could have taken her he could
[1:47:34] have raped her he could have murdered
[1:47:36] her he could have tortured her
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:39] and not to mention it was an abomination
[1:47:41] for him to be into her house
[1:47:45] and he says i need water
[1:47:48] and i want you to think of the wittiness
[1:47:50] of this young lady
[1:47:53] instead here have some milk
[1:47:57] what does milk do to your babies
[1:48:01] that's exactly right
[1:48:04] and here she feeds this milk to this man
[1:48:07] almost showing favoritism to him
[1:48:09] and so here he drinks of this milk and
[1:48:11] he thinks everything's good and he just
[1:48:13] kind of lays himself to sleep
[1:48:23] being a servant of god
[1:48:25] she says i've got to act on this
[1:48:27] i've got to act so that i can save my
[1:48:30] countrymen so that i could save my
[1:48:32] dignity so that i can save my name
[1:48:34] amongst the people of the children of
[1:48:36] israel
[1:48:39] and she sneaks over
[1:48:41] to this man
[1:48:44] with a stint a tent stake
[1:48:48] everybody familiar with this story
[1:48:51] a tent stake
[1:48:54] they're about this long
[1:48:57] and she takes this two-pound
[1:48:59] sledgehammer while he's sleeping
[1:49:02] and puts it right to his temple and it
[1:49:04] says she staked him to the ground
[1:49:12] tell me god don't mean business
[1:49:16] she staked him to the ground and when
[1:49:18] the children of israel came back when
[1:49:20] all the soldiers come back she called to
[1:49:22] him bear rat come here look let me show
[1:49:24] you what i got
[1:49:26] let me show you what you let go and let
[1:49:28] me show you what god did in my house
[1:49:31] let me tell you ladies something you
[1:49:33] don't let men
[1:49:35] rule and roost as far as telling you
[1:49:37] this or that you can't do this or you
[1:49:38] can't do that because when god tells you
[1:49:40] to do something you can take charge in
[1:49:42] your house
[1:49:44] under the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:49:51] judges chapter six now we're gonna have
[1:49:53] to hurry
[1:50:02] chapter 6 verse 11.
[1:50:06] and there came an angel of the lord and
[1:50:08] said under the oak which was in ophra
[1:50:12] it pertained unto the to josh
[1:50:14] that abby's absolutely
[1:50:16] right sorry and his son gideon thrashed
[1:50:19] wheat by the wine press to hide it
[1:50:22] from the midianites and the angel of the
[1:50:25] lord appeared unto him and said unto him
[1:50:27] the lord is with thee
[1:50:30] what's it say thou mighty
[1:50:33] man of
[1:50:34] valor
[1:50:36] and gideon said unto him oh my lord if
[1:50:38] the lord be with us then why all of this
[1:50:40] be following us
[1:50:42] remember we're in the book of judges
[1:50:43] things were not going good
[1:50:46] and god has to call somebody up on the
[1:50:47] scene to straighten out the people
[1:50:50] and he says if you where's all the
[1:50:51] miracles which our father told us of did
[1:50:54] not the lord bring us up out of egypt
[1:50:57] but now the lord hath forsaken us and
[1:50:59] delivered us into the hands of the
[1:51:00] midianites
[1:51:02] and the lord looked upon him and said go
[1:51:04] in this thou might that thou shalt save
[1:51:06] israel
[1:51:08] and whose might
[1:51:12] that thou shalt save israel from the
[1:51:13] hand of the midianites
[1:51:15] have not i sent thee
[1:51:17] and he said unto him oh my lord
[1:51:19] wherewith shall i save israel
[1:51:21] behold
[1:51:23] my family is poor in manasseh and i'm
[1:51:26] the least in my father's house
[1:51:28] and the lord said unto him surely i will
[1:51:31] be with thee and thou shall smite the
[1:51:34] midians
[1:51:35] as one man
[1:51:38] brother and sisters here we find gideon
[1:51:41] hiding
[1:51:42] in fear
[1:51:44] we find gideon hiding in fear not
[1:51:46] knowing what tomorrow holds not knowing
[1:51:49] that he could be dominated by the
[1:51:52] midianites at any time we don't know
[1:51:54] what the future holds in our lives
[1:51:56] you don't know what tomorrow that you'll
[1:51:58] be going through you don't know what it
[1:52:00] looks like you know we just went through
[1:52:01] a year filled with turmoil
[1:52:05] and we've talked about it before and
[1:52:08] and unemployment's now up and people
[1:52:10] won't work and you need people to work
[1:52:12] and people won't work you don't have
[1:52:14] stuff on the shelves groceries this is
[1:52:16] what's going on gas prices are out the
[1:52:18] roof ain't going to keep climbing
[1:52:21] i heard brother brian telling the
[1:52:23] financial report i had to fill my gas
[1:52:24] tank up
[1:52:27] that's not fun
[1:52:29] my propane tank i thought man i better
[1:52:31] fill this thing up but maybe i've done
[1:52:33] the right thing because it could be five
[1:52:34] dollars a gallon tomorrow
[1:52:37] because russia is crazy
[1:52:40] we might be at war right now for all we
[1:52:42] know we're in church
[1:52:44] we don't know when it's going to happen
[1:52:46] it's going to happen
[1:52:48] so we could be at war right now not
[1:52:50] knowing what tomorrow holds so this year
[1:52:53] has been a very trying year
[1:52:56] and it's just february
[1:53:01] we all thought we were going to have a
[1:53:02] better year
[1:53:05] cobin was gone no it's still rampant
[1:53:10] we thought things are going to get good
[1:53:11] no
[1:53:12] inflation just keeps going up
[1:53:16] and here the nation of israel was in a
[1:53:18] similar circumstance
[1:53:21] israel was reaping the seeds of
[1:53:23] disobedient and rebellion you know if
[1:53:24] you disobey and you rebel against god
[1:53:28] probably not good things are going to
[1:53:30] happen
[1:53:32] because it's going to catch up to you
[1:53:35] it will find you your sins will find you
[1:53:42] and here is a nation that was suffering
[1:53:44] terribly under the oppression of the
[1:53:46] midianites they were hungry they were
[1:53:48] poverty-stricken
[1:53:50] it was pain just to go out and see them
[1:53:54] and
[1:53:55] and the lord called them
[1:53:57] to free them
[1:54:01] and we're so stubborn sometimes that we
[1:54:03] can't accept our freedom
[1:54:07] and the lord allowed this chastisement
[1:54:09] to go on for seven years
[1:54:13] these raiding parties of the midianites
[1:54:15] would come in
[1:54:16] and come in and take over the grain that
[1:54:19] was being harvested by the children of
[1:54:21] israel they couldn't even thresh their
[1:54:23] wheat
[1:54:24] you don't have your thresh wheat you
[1:54:26] take a basket you throw it up in the air
[1:54:28] as high as you can the wind blows away
[1:54:30] the shaft
[1:54:31] and the seed falls to the ground when
[1:54:34] they throw their seed up hey there they
[1:54:36] are
[1:54:39] so that's why we find gideon down in the
[1:54:41] pit
[1:54:42] and he's
[1:54:51] he didn't have he didn't have no wind
[1:54:52] down in that pit
[1:54:53] but he's hiding he's hiding down in
[1:54:55] there and he's down there throwing us up
[1:54:57] and he's tiptoeing
[1:55:01] looking around making sure no midianites
[1:55:03] you know sometimes we tiptoe
[1:55:08] we tiptoe around satan
[1:55:13] but we really don't have to
[1:55:16] because we've been given authority
[1:55:19] by the word of god
[1:55:22] but we find ourselves many times just
[1:55:24] like gideon there threshing our weed in
[1:55:27] the pits of our sorrow
[1:55:29] hiding in our poverty and we find
[1:55:31] ourselves down there and then the angel
[1:55:33] lord comes to him and says
[1:55:38] let me tell you something
[1:55:40] get in
[1:55:42] let me tell you about the life
[1:55:44] your life
[1:55:51] i can't imagine gideon's surprise
[1:55:54] when the angel of the lord come to him
[1:55:56] and makes a statement
[1:55:59] you know but the prophet brother branham
[1:56:01] said
[1:56:03] that the angel of the lord was none
[1:56:04] other than the lord
[1:56:08] so he's having a personal interview with
[1:56:11] god almighty
[1:56:13] he said it was l capital l o r d
[1:56:18] and he's having this personal interview
[1:56:20] with him
[1:56:21] and he says gideon
[1:56:25] yes lord
[1:56:28] my mighty man of
[1:56:31] fowler
[1:56:35] and gideon
[1:56:37] he probably said lord did you see me in
[1:56:39] that pit
[1:56:43] i'm scared lord
[1:56:45] i'm afraid
[1:56:47] i'm hiding from the people that i know
[1:56:49] can take me and he says get in
[1:56:53] don't look through your mind
[1:56:57] listen to what i say about you
[1:57:00] you mighty man of valor you man of great
[1:57:03] courage you man who can face danger
[1:57:06] especially in battle that's what valor
[1:57:08] means listen to this bravery
[1:57:10] courageous fearless braveness backbone
[1:57:13] spine heroism manliness boldness
[1:57:17] gallantry
[1:57:28] you see it's all in the eyes
[1:57:30] of the beholder
[1:57:32] get in you are a warrior get inside i'm
[1:57:35] a farmer
[1:57:38] i'm a farmer can't you see me down here
[1:57:40] threshing this wheat
[1:57:42] gideon you're a warrior
[1:57:44] i i know lord i know about the children
[1:57:46] of israel i know the promises of abraham
[1:57:48] isaac and jacob i know the story of
[1:57:50] joseph i know he rose up to be second
[1:57:53] only to pharaoh i know all those things
[1:57:55] i know the red sea was parted i know you
[1:57:58] fed us in the wilderness i know all
[1:58:00] those things but i'm just insignificant
[1:58:08] gideon was well versed
[1:58:10] in the word of god
[1:58:15] and he telling god what he knows about
[1:58:18] god
[1:58:19] and i can't imagine god must chuckle in
[1:58:21] under his breath
[1:58:23] and you think you're a farmer
[1:58:28] get in
[1:58:29] gird up yourself
[1:58:32] because i say you're not a farmer
[1:58:34] but you're a mighty man of valor
[1:58:43] how can i save israel god
[1:58:46] my clan is the weakest
[1:58:49] in the nasa
[1:58:54] you know manassas was the tribe of the
[1:58:56] children of israel the land was given to
[1:58:57] them it was as the land was distributed
[1:59:00] out right there in the book of judges
[1:59:01] there was a little portion of land given
[1:59:03] to manassas group
[1:59:05] they were the littlest the most
[1:59:07] insignificant group amongst the children
[1:59:09] of israel he wasn't lying to god he told
[1:59:11] god the truth
[1:59:14] we are from the youngest the littlest
[1:59:15] the little itty bitty spot on the map
[1:59:17] you can't even see is god and i'm the
[1:59:20] littlest of the little
[1:59:25] a mighty man of valor
[1:59:30] you know many would say that gideon was
[1:59:32] a coward
[1:59:34] for being in that well
[1:59:38] i say no
[1:59:43] i think he had a right to be afraid
[1:59:46] at that day at that point at that very
[1:59:49] minute in his life
[1:59:51] he had no choice but to be afraid
[1:59:57] because he was thinking
[1:59:59] with limited capacity
[2:00:02] at that time
[2:00:04] at that time he didn't know who he was
[2:00:06] all he knew is if i make the mistake the
[2:00:09] many nights are going to come through
[2:00:10] here and wipe out my food they're going
[2:00:12] to wipe out my family they'll take my
[2:00:13] wife they'll take my children
[2:00:16] and that's the way we get sometimes in
[2:00:18] our lives
[2:00:20] we fail to realize and see ourselves for
[2:00:23] what god sees us as
[2:00:26] and we fall into that trap of thinking
[2:00:28] i'm just the littlest teeniest tiniest
[2:00:30] little stuck on the map
[2:00:32] and satan's going to come in here and
[2:00:33] just take me over
[2:00:36] but god says you mighty man of valor
[2:00:43] you know there was a passage in the new
[2:00:45] testament
[2:00:49] and it tells how we all react to life's
[2:00:51] obstacles
[2:00:53] let's bring it down to when jesus was
[2:00:54] walking in sandals
[2:00:57] here jesus was on the scene and he's
[2:01:00] preaching to this crowd of people about
[2:01:02] 5 000 men that said which so we can
[2:01:04] establish it maybe it was 10 or 15 000
[2:01:07] people total when you count women and
[2:01:09] children
[2:01:10] maybe more than that historians really
[2:01:12] don't know
[2:01:13] and as he's preaching these children his
[2:01:16] disciples come up to him and says lord
[2:01:17] the evening is approaching
[2:01:19] we need to send these people away
[2:01:23] we need to send these people away
[2:01:24] because it's getting late and they need
[2:01:26] to go buy themselves some food they're
[2:01:27] getting hungry lord you're wearing the
[2:01:29] people out
[2:01:32] he wasn't preaching one of those
[2:01:33] evangelistic meetings
[2:01:36] he was given out substance
[2:01:38] he was giving out substance and jesus
[2:01:40] looked at the disciples and said
[2:01:43] there's no need for them to go away
[2:01:46] but but lord they have to have something
[2:01:47] to eat
[2:01:49] well jesus says well then go give them
[2:01:50] something to eat
[2:01:54] can you imagine them looking around
[2:01:58] be right back lord
[2:02:09] but lord
[2:02:14] we got five loaves
[2:02:16] and two fishes
[2:02:20] jesus says feed the people
[2:02:24] feed the people
[2:02:26] but but but lord
[2:02:29] let me show you what we got in here
[2:02:34] we got but what's in there
[2:02:38] five loaves and two fishes
[2:02:40] and jesus says give me that
[2:02:42] give me that basket
[2:02:48] there's your fish
[2:02:50] there's you a fish
[2:02:52] there's you a fish
[2:02:56] there's your fish
[2:02:59] and she a fish are you hungry
[2:03:02] are she a fish
[2:03:04] does you a fish
[2:03:07] pass that down they need some fish
[2:03:09] and he goes through the whole crowd and
[2:03:11] he gets fish after fish and bread after
[2:03:13] bread after bread and fish after fish
[2:03:15] and fish and why to prove to the people
[2:03:18] to prove to them that god
[2:03:20] thinks that nothing is impossible and he
[2:03:23] not only did that feat once he did it
[2:03:25] twice
[2:03:28] read your bible it didn't happen just
[2:03:29] once
[2:03:30] twice
[2:03:32] and he distributes out these fish over
[2:03:34] and over and over what is he doing he's
[2:03:36] trying to get the people's attention and
[2:03:38] say
[2:03:39] don't worry about what you see or your
[2:03:43] circumstance
[2:03:45] because i'm in
[2:03:47] control
[2:03:52] you know the prophet tells a story
[2:03:55] and he said he was in a prayer line
[2:03:57] and you've heard it over and over
[2:04:00] and i didn't realize for a long time
[2:04:01] that it happened in a prayer line
[2:04:03] but he said they left me in the
[2:04:05] prayer line too long
[2:04:08] and it pulled him down
[2:04:10] it pulled him down to a place that he
[2:04:12] almost got sickness
[2:04:13] and and pain set up on him and distress
[2:04:16] set up on him
[2:04:17] and he was just sitting there and he
[2:04:18] said they let they just let me in there
[2:04:20] too long
[2:04:22] and he said that the
[2:04:24] the man come to him and said preacher
[2:04:25] branham
[2:04:27] he said yes sir
[2:04:29] did you keep your religion during the
[2:04:31] time of your sickness
[2:04:35] no
[2:04:38] my religion kept me
[2:04:42] you
[2:04:43] can't do it in yourself
[2:04:44] the prophet couldn't do it in himself
[2:04:47] the the children of israel couldn't do
[2:04:49] it in their self gideon couldn't do it
[2:04:50] in himself moses couldn't do it in
[2:04:52] himself joshua caleb none of those
[2:04:55] people jl they couldn't do it in
[2:04:56] themselves but what was it it was god
[2:04:59] moving on the scene
[2:05:00] and we need god to move into the scene
[2:05:02] in our lives
[2:05:04] on a day-to-day
[2:05:06] basis
[2:05:10] the lord turned to get in and said
[2:05:12] i'm sending you out
[2:05:16] you go out in strength
[2:05:18] go out in the strength you have and i'll
[2:05:21] take care
[2:05:22] of the rest of it
[2:05:31] god basically told him gideon
[2:05:34] i am enough
[2:05:39] sometimes we got to realize
[2:05:41] that god is enough
[2:05:45] that when you're staring down the eyes
[2:05:46] of that giant that wall we talked about
[2:05:49] that you didn't do you know you can't
[2:05:50] get around the sickness that's upon you
[2:05:52] that you can't get through
[2:05:55] you have to just look and say god
[2:05:57] you're enough
[2:06:00] why am i threatened why am i holding on
[2:06:02] to this why am i why am i not allowing
[2:06:04] myself to get through this because god i
[2:06:07] know you're enough
[2:06:13] we just simply need to show up and let
[2:06:16] god do the rest
[2:06:19] when you go to the doctor and they say
[2:06:20] there's no way say i'm here and god's
[2:06:22] with me
[2:06:25] i'm here and god will do the rest
[2:06:32] the lord told gideon
[2:06:37] that what strength he had was sufficient
[2:06:41] did you see that in the bible
[2:06:44] read it closer when you go home
[2:06:46] god told him what strength you have
[2:06:51] brother jeff what strength you have
[2:06:53] it's sufficient
[2:06:56] what strength you have brother john it's
[2:06:58] sufficient
[2:06:59] what strength you've got brother tommy
[2:07:01] it's sufficient
[2:07:03] because all that we are is what he is in
[2:07:06] us
[2:07:08] you remember that prophecy i was telling
[2:07:09] you about the lamp stand
[2:07:11] with the gut with the oil in it the holy
[2:07:13] ghost all that we are is what we have in
[2:07:16] the holy ghost
[2:07:18] god is
[2:07:20] enough
[2:07:23] you know billy graham brother brown
[2:07:25] talked a lot about billy graham and he's
[2:07:26] throughout the message
[2:07:29] crusaded around the country around the
[2:07:31] world
[2:07:34] and his invitation him does anybody know
[2:07:36] what it is sister becky you know what it
[2:07:38] is
[2:07:40] just as i am
[2:07:45] just as i am
[2:07:50] god don't ask you to be nothing that
[2:07:51] you're
[2:07:52] not you come just as you are
[2:07:56] and he does the rest
[2:07:58] just as i am
[2:08:01] brothers and sisters
[2:08:03] there's a warrior
[2:08:04] within this
[2:08:06] morning and i hope you've been able to
[2:08:08] look and see with the thoughts that i've
[2:08:11] had and the inspiration of the holy
[2:08:12] ghost that god has quickened it to your
[2:08:14] ear and dropped it down into your that
[2:08:16] that warrior within is within you
[2:08:21] god is calling a people
[2:08:24] you say well last week last month we
[2:08:26] were getting so beat up so bad in church
[2:08:28] but it's because god wants you to
[2:08:29] realize how important he was so that he
[2:08:32] can make you what he wants you to be
[2:08:35] that's the way god revolves around in
[2:08:37] the believers
[2:08:39] sometimes he has to tear us down to
[2:08:40] build us up
[2:08:42] and thank god we're in a build-up stage
[2:08:45] but recognize today
[2:08:48] that you
[2:08:49] are a warrior
[2:08:50] that there is victory on the horizon
[2:08:53] that our security is here that
[2:08:55] overcoming power is here and that we are
[2:08:57] all that we can be if we're willing to
[2:08:58] trust to follow and obey

[2:09:04] our feet this morning
[2:09:06] so i challenge you this morning

[2:09:11] challenge to you

[2:09:38] and be victorious in god let's pray
[2:09:40] heavenly father
[2:09:42] we're thankful this morning lord jesus
[2:09:44] for your word we're thankful for
[2:09:47] uh
[2:09:48] characters that we can look at in the
[2:09:49] bible that was recorded down through
[2:09:51] history and through time
[2:09:54] men and women
[2:09:56] that were just like us
[2:09:58] no doubt was weak in themselves
[2:10:01] their eyesight was dimmed in their
[2:10:03] selves
[2:10:04] they couldn't see uh the goodness
[2:10:06] of what you had given them but the the
[2:10:08] pain and sorrow and suffering that they
[2:10:10] were in but god
[2:10:12] you moved on the scene in their life and
[2:10:14] you made warriors out of warriors you
[2:10:17] made warriors out of people who were
[2:10:19] scared you made warriors out of cowards
[2:10:23] and lord we ask today that you make
[2:10:25] warriors out of us believe believers
[2:10:29] because lord we love you with all of our
[2:10:31] heart
[2:10:32] lord we know the most important thing
[2:10:34] that we can receive from you is our
[2:10:35] salvation
[2:10:36] and lord as long as we've got that
[2:10:38] salvation
[2:10:39] we're happy in that lord jesus and the
[2:10:42] enemy knows the enemy knows and the
[2:10:44] enemy comes out to destroy us because
[2:10:46] the bible tells us he said heal steal
[2:10:48] and destroy he wants us to steal our
[2:10:51] happiness he wants to destroy our homes
[2:10:52] he wants to destroy our marriages he
[2:10:54] wants to destroy the good things that
[2:10:56] god has done for us
[2:10:59] but as we look at him
[2:11:00] let us not look at him through eyes
[2:11:03] of magnification
[2:11:05] let's don't look at him as a child of
[2:11:07] anac
[2:11:09] but let's look at him
