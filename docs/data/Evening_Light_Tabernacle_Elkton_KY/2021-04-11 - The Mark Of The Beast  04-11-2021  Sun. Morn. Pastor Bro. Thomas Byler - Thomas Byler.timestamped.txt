[42:41] kind heavenly father we just once again
[42:43] lord demon the grand privilege
[42:46] lord to be able to assemble ourselves
[42:47] together with believers
[42:49] of like faith lord jesus and just to
[42:53] pull from the gift of god and god you'd
[42:55] come in a special way this morning
[42:58] we believe lord that you can do
[42:59] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[43:01] could ask or think
[43:03] and so lord we would ask god you would
[43:05] just open us up father to be able to
[43:06] receive all that you would have for us
[43:08] this morning
[43:09] and lord with your blessings that you've
[43:11] bestowed upon us thank you for the
[43:12] health that you've given each and every
[43:14] one of us lord
[43:15] and lord jesus if we would just begin to
[43:18] write down all of your blessings lord we
[43:20] couldn't
[43:22] and begin to number them all father so
[43:24] we just want you to know that we love
[43:26] you with all of our hearts
[43:27] teachers our thanks and gratitude for
[43:29] your goodness to us lord
[43:31] forgive us all of any shortcomings any
[43:33] failures lord jesus we would first ask
[43:36] lord we want to make sure everything's
[43:37] under the blood of jesus christ god that
[43:40] we would be a clear channel lord jesus
[43:42] for you to work through lord jesus and
[43:43] the ears
[43:45] would be able to hear what the spirit
[43:47] saith to the church
[43:48] lord this morning father we just yield
[43:50] ourselves see lord and
[43:53] as we open your bible this morning we
[43:55] would ask god that you would be the one
[43:56] lord to give us the true meaning of it
[43:58] lord
[43:59] the true understanding of it by
[44:00] revelation father today
[44:02] and lord we just commit ourselves to you
[44:04] now in jesus christ's name
[44:08] don't know why i guess just why the lord
[44:11] asked me to go this way
[44:13] uh i guess i do know
[44:16] it's certainly fitting amen
[44:19] for him to go in the way that we're
[44:21] going this morning
[44:23] amen
[44:32] i want to first start with establishing
[44:36] something in revelation so we want to
[44:37] talk about the three angels to begin
[44:39] with
[44:40] the three angels amen and then what
[44:43] brother branham said about him amen
[44:44] because how many believes anything we
[44:46] minister we want to be based on what the
[44:47] prophet taught
[44:49] because we certainly wouldn't be
[44:51] qualified to try to
[44:53] interpret or speak or teach something
[44:55] out of the book of revelations without
[44:58] amen a prophet so in revelations the
[45:00] 14th chapter if you will go with me
[45:04] revelations 14.
[45:10] and we want to focus this more on the
[45:11] third angel's message
[45:14] chapter 14 in verse 6.
[45:18] and i saw another angel fly in the midst
[45:20] of heaven
[45:21] having the everlasting gospel to preach
[45:23] unto them that dwell
[45:24] on the earth and to every nation and
[45:27] kindred
[45:28] and tongue and people saying with a loud
[45:31] voice fear god and give glory to him
[45:33] for the hour of his judgment is come
[45:37] and worship him that made heaven and
[45:39] earth and the sea
[45:40] and the fountains of waters and there
[45:43] followed him another angel
[45:45] saying babylon is fallen is fallen
[45:49] the great city because she made all
[45:52] nations
[45:52] drink of the wine of the wrath of her
[45:55] fornication
[45:57] and the third angel followed them saying
[45:59] with a loud voice if any man worship the
[46:01] beast and his image
[46:03] and receive his mark in his forehead or
[46:05] in his hand
[46:06] the same shall drink of the wine of the
[46:09] wrath of god
[46:10] which is poured out without mixture into
[46:13] the cup of his indignation
[46:15] and he shall be tormented with fire and
[46:17] brimstone
[46:18] in the presence of the holy angels and
[46:21] in this presence of the lamb
[46:23] and the smoke of their torment ascendeth
[46:25] up forever
[46:26] and ever and they have no rest day nor
[46:29] night who worship the beast
[46:31] and his image and whoso receiveth the
[46:34] mark
[46:34] of his name here is the patience of the
[46:38] saints
[46:39] here are they that keep the commandments
[46:42] of god
[46:43] and the faith of jesus may god had his
[46:45] blessings to reading the word you can be
[46:47] seated this morning
[46:48] amen i'd like to do a little study this
[46:50] morning with the help of the lord
[46:52] amen uh and i i feel like
[46:56] i kind of even before i read some of the
[46:59] things that is in here
[47:01] in manfield felt like i was impressed
[47:03] upon
[47:04] speaking on the mark of the beast amen
[47:08] would that be all right let's talk about
[47:10] the mark
[47:11] of the beast amen and we probably touch
[47:14] a little bit on the seal of god
[47:16] also if you'll notice there's a
[47:18] difference there's one that is called a
[47:20] mark
[47:21] and the other one is a seal amen one is
[47:24] a sealed and the other one is a mark
[47:26] amen
[47:27] so let me just say this out of uh
[47:30] brother brandon preaching on the mark of
[47:31] the beast
[47:33] he says now you see how it was
[47:34] represented in ezekiel
[47:36] the ninth chapter at jerusalem amen
[47:40] and now we come to revelation now that's
[47:43] a whole other
[47:44] sermon in itself but i want to recap
[47:46] just a little bit about ezekiel
[47:48] because if you remember ezekiel you
[47:50] remember that
[47:52] the white angel with the ink horn
[47:55] remember the one with the ink horn and
[47:56] he told him to go into the city
[47:58] and to mark everybody that sighs and
[48:00] cries for the abomination that's done in
[48:02] the city
[48:03] amen and all those that are marked mark
[48:05] them all and
[48:07] and the rest of them and then of course
[48:08] after that happened after he went
[48:10] through there and after he marked them
[48:12] afterwards came the angels so with the
[48:14] slaughtering weapons
[48:16] right and i understand through the
[48:18] prophet of god that that happened amen
[48:20] whenever
[48:21] uh you know first of all those
[48:24] that were sealed in jerusalem and then
[48:28] titus 96 a.d was went into jerusalem and
[48:32] utterly killed
[48:33] every man woman and child until the
[48:35] blood was running down the streets
[48:37] and that right they besieged it and they
[48:40] killed everybody and everything amen
[48:42] and so there was a great destruction
[48:44] that happened in israel
[48:46] and so forth because of those those uh
[48:48] the marking first of all and then out
[48:51] came the destruction and that's where
[48:53] you and i are at this morning
[48:55] amen we're at that place where there is
[48:57] a marking
[48:58] going on amen because we are on the
[49:01] threshold again
[49:03] and this is going to be focusing once
[49:05] again towards the coming of the lord
[49:06] because we certainly don't ever want to
[49:08] get our eyes off of that
[49:11] amen because we know that it's going to
[49:13] happen we don't know why really i
[49:16] i don't see why it hasn't happened
[49:18] already man it's surprising
[49:20] that it hasn't happened already so the
[49:22] way i feel this morning and i don't know
[49:24] about you
[49:25] but i feel this morning in my heart like
[49:27] in revelations the last chapter says
[49:30] even so lord jesus come we're ready for
[49:32] him to come
[49:34] and waiting for him to come
[49:38] so we find out that now i want to just
[49:41] read this year to kind of lay a
[49:43] foundation now if you notice here he
[49:45] says now
[49:46] we come to revelation for you that's
[49:49] your pencils to write this down i'd like
[49:52] uh you to write down revelations 14 6-12
[49:56] which is what we just read that's the
[49:58] three last angels three angels
[50:01] after the seven angels that were special
[50:04] there were three special angels
[50:06] come forth did you notice that i want
[50:08] you to notice
[50:10] them three last angels the first angel
[50:14] has sounded the trumpet of the gospel
[50:17] and had the everlasting gospel preached
[50:19] to all the world
[50:20] the second angel kind of preached a
[50:23] holiness gospel
[50:24] amen because he was that the church had
[50:28] committed foreign church had committed
[50:30] fornication
[50:31] and the third angel roared out to escape
[50:35] the mark of the beast amen
[50:39] he says now watch the first angel in the
[50:41] reformation luther
[50:42] second wesleyan reformation he
[50:44] straightened out the church and so forth
[50:46] but the third pentecostal message should
[50:48] be the true messenger warning them
[50:50] to escape the mark of the beast saying
[50:53] whosoever receives the mark of the beast
[50:56] the same shall drink of the wrath of god
[50:59] poured out without mixture
[51:01] into the cup of indignation being poured
[51:03] out upon the people
[51:05] that's the very message today the third
[51:08] angel
[51:09] third message last message
[51:13] luther's message justification wesley
[51:15] sanctification pentecost the seal of god
[51:18] escape the mark of the beast come out
[51:21] from them big walls of babylon
[51:23] and be sealed into the kingdom of god
[51:29] amen
[51:33] so how many believes that's what we are
[51:35] we're at that place
[51:36] where we have to get out of there get
[51:38] out of babylon
[51:40] and get sealed into the kingdom of god
[51:48] amen
[51:59] all right so i want to talk a little bit
[52:01] about something that brother brown said
[52:03] that there'll come a time
[52:05] and this is about to squeeze but that's
[52:06] down
[52:08] under a little bit but no here it is
[52:11] holy is holy still
[52:12] and brother bam says talk talking about
[52:15] the screens before it's come a time that
[52:17] it'll be to the total loss then amen
[52:21] so you and i we all realize that we're
[52:23] on the brink of something i don't know
[52:24] about you but
[52:25] i can feel that we're on the brink of
[52:27] something
[52:28] brother branham felt it back in his day
[52:30] we feel like it's in our day
[52:32] and with things going like they are i
[52:35] feel like
[52:36] things are beginning to uh roll a little
[52:39] bit faster
[52:40] so to speak snowball in that right and i
[52:43] think brother ben talked about how that
[52:44] in jesus last
[52:45] hours of his life how did he fulfill
[52:47] more scripture
[52:48] so many more scriptures than during his
[52:50] time folks we're so used to
[52:52] having it nice
[52:56] amen the world is very used to having it
[52:59] nice
[53:00] but they don't realize that just as sure
[53:02] sodom and gomorrah
[53:04] was burnt to the ground in that right
[53:06] just as sure as the days of noah
[53:08] the whole world was flooded and
[53:10] destroyed that's what's right ahead of
[53:12] us
[53:13] amen that's what's ahead for the world
[53:15] and not too far from now
[53:18] but what was this according to what we
[53:20] have read now he talked about
[53:21] it this third angel's message amen that
[53:24] it was a
[53:25] call to come out and to receive the seal
[53:29] of god amen i got a quite a few quotes
[53:32] on what brother bob said was the mark of
[53:33] the beast and what the seal of god
[53:35] is amen we want to know that right
[53:37] because we realize one thing about the
[53:40] seal of god and
[53:41] and the mark of the beast is that the
[53:43] mark of the beast you know
[53:45] you know it's not going to be communism
[53:47] or some
[53:48] you know something that comes out of
[53:50] north korea
[53:51] amen it's not going to be an atheistic
[53:54] kind of a thing
[53:55] it's going to be so close that if it was
[53:57] possible it would deceive the very
[53:59] elected
[54:01] amen and so i believe that the bride of
[54:03] jesus christ has to be on our toes if
[54:05] this last
[54:05] message that we hear amen was a call for
[54:08] us to be sure not to take the mark of
[54:11] the beast
[54:11] because everybody that takes this mark
[54:14] amen they're going to be tormented with
[54:16] fire and brimstone in the presence
[54:19] of god and all the holy angels amen
[54:22] there will not be any rest day or night
[54:24] people's not going to get any sleep it's
[54:27] going to bad day for those who receive
[54:30] the mark
[54:30] amen all right let me just uh
[54:34] let me say say it another place in 1961
[54:37] i believe he said once again he mentions
[54:39] the third angel
[54:41] he says now listen he says now this is
[54:44] the third angel's message to the world
[54:46] and you know what the third angel's
[54:48] message is
[54:50] it's going forth now in this day
[54:54] amen and this is the flying war to
[54:57] amen and
[55:01] in revelations the 11th chapter and
[55:03] verse 14
[55:04] the second woe is past and behold the
[55:07] third woe
[55:08] cometh quickly and the seventh angel
[55:11] sounded and there were great voices in
[55:13] heaven
[55:13] saying the kingdoms of this world have
[55:16] become the kingdom of
[55:17] our lord and of his christ and he shall
[55:19] reign forever
[55:21] and ever so how many knows after this
[55:22] third angel sounding forth
[55:24] after the third woe goes forth the
[55:27] kingdoms of this world
[55:29] are going to become the kingdoms of god
[55:32] amen and that's what you and i are
[55:34] looking for amen where there's not going
[55:36] to be any of this
[55:37] amen no there's not going to be any
[55:40] strife between the nations the devil's
[55:41] not going to
[55:42] rule the nations anymore god is going to
[55:45] rule nations
[55:47] how many looking forward for that i'm
[55:49] looking for god to have
[55:51] for him to rule the nations you know hi
[55:54] this morning we get up in the morning we
[55:57] get dressed and we get ready we break me
[55:59] eat our breakfast we pray and and we
[56:02] study and we come to church amen
[56:04] because we are doing what we are getting
[56:07] ready
[56:08] to rule and reign with christ for a
[56:10] thousand years
[56:12] and not just a thousand years but
[56:14] through all of eternity
[56:15] that's what you and i are striving for
[56:18] but you know like we were talking about
[56:19] wednesday if we aren't careful we'll
[56:21] allow the deceitfulness of riches and so
[56:24] forth choke out
[56:25] the word amen true call our spiritual
[56:28] walk with god it'll cause us to get
[56:31] lukewarm which is one of their
[56:33] characteristics
[56:34] of the mark of the beast is to be
[56:36] lukewarm
[56:39] come on folks a layout is here he ain't
[56:41] gonna take nobody in that's lukewarm
[56:44] amen they were spewed out of their mouth
[56:46] when they were in lukewarm
[56:47] amen but it's part of that antichrist
[56:50] system
[56:51] amen and so forth but we want to get
[56:53] into detail a little bit with what
[56:55] what the mark of the beast is because we
[56:56] have to go all the way back
[56:58] amen not only into genesis but way back
[57:00] amen just just look where it come from
[57:03] now notice what he said so that's right
[57:06] now notice he says that's right and
[57:07] we're
[57:08] at the end of the road amen
[57:12] now in revelation 17th chapter it says
[57:15] that the catholic church was a heart
[57:17] with a heart with the great heart
[57:18] revelation 17 and verse 5
[57:20] and upon her forehead was a name written
[57:24] mystery babylon the great mother of
[57:26] harlots and abominations
[57:28] of the earth amen now notice he goes a
[57:31] little bit further

[57:34] it's the catholic church old thing come
[57:37] out of babylon i mean those it's babylon

[58:08] the god of babylon

[1:00:56] amen because of the plague folks i'm
[1:00:59] going to tell you
[1:01:00] it's going to be a bad place after a
[1:01:02] while
[1:01:04] amen for her sins have reached into
[1:01:06] heaven and god has remembered her
[1:01:08] iniquities that's why he's saying come
[1:01:10] out amen don't be a part of that don't
[1:01:13] be a part
[1:01:14] of that beast amen don't be a part of
[1:01:17] the beast
[1:01:18] praise be to god and that's the last
[1:01:20] angel's message listen
[1:01:22] the last angel's message and warning was
[1:01:24] be not partakers of our sins come out
[1:01:26] and separate yourself listen to what the
[1:01:29] prophet says he says now you're either
[1:01:31] going to wear one mark today other than
[1:01:33] the other there's no middle ground
[1:01:35] either the mark of the beast which is
[1:01:37] the apostate church
[1:01:39] are the seal of god
[1:01:43] leaving this door either leaves with the
[1:01:46] mark of god
[1:01:47] or the mark of the enemy
[1:01:51] praise be to god how many believes that
[1:01:53] you and i this morning can i say this
[1:01:55] that you sit there
[1:01:57] with one of those things mark
[1:02:02] of the beast
[1:02:06] amen oh my
[1:02:09] praise be to god
[1:02:12] oh my so we look at that and we see that
[1:02:15] we have to have
[1:02:17] one or the other because the scripture
[1:02:19] says it this way
[1:02:20] it says in revelations the 8th chapter
[1:02:24] and verse 13 it says you know
[1:02:28] 8-13 no
[1:02:31] 13-8 backwards that's what happens
[1:02:34] all right and all that dwell upon the
[1:02:37] earth
[1:02:38] shall worship him whose names are not
[1:02:42] written in the book of life of the lamb
[1:02:44] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:02:47] how many another place it says and all
[1:02:49] the world
[1:02:50] wandered after the beast
[1:02:54] now let me tell you something you might
[1:02:56] not think so but after studying this and
[1:02:58] realizing this
[1:03:00] it isn't going to be hard to deceive
[1:03:02] people
[1:03:04] because people people are pretty blind
[1:03:06] to begin with
[1:03:09] humanity human beings you
[1:03:12] as a person me as a person
[1:03:15] are pretty blind people
[1:03:19] amen why do i say that i say that
[1:03:22] because
[1:03:23] i will say this outside of the eyes of
[1:03:27] the holy ghost
[1:03:29] you are going to be deceived you have to
[1:03:32] have the eyes
[1:03:34] of the holy ghost or you're going to
[1:03:36] think you're okay and that you're right
[1:03:38] huh you that's what man is going to be
[1:03:42] over i thought about but
[1:03:44] he wasn't you didn't have the holy ghost
[1:03:46] down in your soul
[1:03:48] first of all let me say this because
[1:03:50] it's very deceiving because we know
[1:03:52] amen that the spirit can be poured out
[1:03:54] upon all flesh the bible says
[1:03:56] but not all flesh is saved so you can
[1:03:59] have it in your flesh
[1:04:01] praise be to god i feel good today hello
[1:04:03] you can have it on your flesh
[1:04:04] you can have it even in your spirit oh
[1:04:07] brother i love you you're so wonderful i
[1:04:09] just love everybody
[1:04:11] you can have it in your spirit but let
[1:04:13] something happen
[1:04:14] and then way down in that soul it hasn't
[1:04:17] been changed yet
[1:04:19] those things are still there huh
[1:04:22] hatred variance jealousy
[1:04:26] malice amen and that's actually part of
[1:04:29] that mark that's what cain had isn't
[1:04:31] that right
[1:04:32] amen but if you don't get it down in
[1:04:34] your soul amen you'll be deceived
[1:04:37] and there'll be millions and millions
[1:04:39] and billions of people deceived
[1:04:42] thinking they're sealed in when they're
[1:04:45] not
[1:04:46] and let me say this i truly believe that
[1:04:48] only
[1:04:49] baptism of the holy ghost will keep you
[1:04:51] from being
[1:04:52] deceived that's the only way and that's
[1:04:55] in your
[1:04:56] soul amen
[1:05:00] my let's start
[1:05:04] now we find out that because that cain
[1:05:07] listened to the
[1:05:08] enemy then what happened
[1:05:12] jealousy on earth
[1:05:15] now this beast mark of the beast how
[1:05:17] many knows it came
[1:05:18] according to saint john 3 12 i believe
[1:05:20] it is not as cain who was
[1:05:22] of that wicked one i mean notice that
[1:05:25] cain
[1:05:25] was the son of the beast
[1:05:30] the most subtle beast of the field cain
[1:05:33] was the son of him in that right and
[1:05:36] because that eve had a relationship with
[1:05:39] that beast and could intermingle
[1:05:41] in that right and after that happened
[1:05:45] god cursed that animal
[1:05:48] he was the most subtle he was the most
[1:05:50] smartest
[1:05:52] as we were told the most good-looking
[1:05:54] most handsome most beautiful beast that
[1:05:56] there was
[1:05:57] and he could actually talk and
[1:05:58] communicate
[1:06:01] that's right and he communicated with
[1:06:03] eve and he got her to fall
[1:06:05] isn't that right amen and if she had a
[1:06:08] child
[1:06:08] one was kane and then she said the bible
[1:06:11] says yet another man
[1:06:12] amen which was able amen and fine come
[1:06:16] to find out one of them was mean and a
[1:06:18] snake yet jealous he had hatred he had
[1:06:21] variance humiliation wrath despite
[1:06:25] murder deceit debate all those were
[1:06:28] marks and traits
[1:06:29] of that beast nature
[1:06:32] praise be to god we find that mark
[1:06:36] amen because how many of us we are mark
[1:06:37] we're mark because
[1:06:39] our life tells us who we are it tells us
[1:06:42] what we are
[1:06:44] amen so we find that cain here
[1:06:47] it's listen he says he became the first
[1:06:50] one that had jealousy
[1:06:52] tell me where that pure line of god came
[1:06:54] from adam he says that's the only
[1:06:56] connection adam was the son of god
[1:06:58] amen where did that jealousy come from
[1:07:00] where did that murder come from
[1:07:02] where did that all kind of a spirit come
[1:07:04] from out of adam no couldn't have it
[1:07:06] come
[1:07:07] from satan that's exactly where it came
[1:07:09] from
[1:07:10] now we find out that he was the first
[1:07:12] murderer
[1:07:13] but he was the first one to have
[1:07:15] jealousy
[1:07:16] we go on back even into heaven if you'll
[1:07:19] notice
[1:07:19] how many knows that he was jealous
[1:07:24] yes he was very jealous let me say one
[1:07:27] more
[1:07:28] mark that tells a person that they have
[1:07:31] perhaps that beast nature is when they
[1:07:35] are
[1:07:35] jealous of those that god does bless
[1:07:44] jealous of those that god actually
[1:07:46] blesses
[1:07:48] and want to kill those that god actually
[1:07:51] blesses
[1:07:52] try to get rid of god's people
[1:07:56] chose the mark of the beast
[1:07:59] that all right because that was what
[1:08:02] mark cain had in him
[1:08:04] and we know he was marked god set a mark
[1:08:06] on cage
[1:08:07] he was the first man to ever get a mark
[1:08:12] to get that mark that he was of the
[1:08:15] devil amen hatred
[1:08:19] it's of the devil jealousy it's of the
[1:08:22] devil but it didn't start with
[1:08:25] uh with cain it started with luke wanted
[1:08:28] some of that glory he wants some of that
[1:08:30] pride he wanted some of that
[1:08:32] amanda praise that michael was getting
[1:08:35] and he brought it down to the earth and
[1:08:38] transferred it
[1:08:39] into man amen better batman says if you
[1:08:42] want to find anything you go back to
[1:08:44] genesis that's where it started and we
[1:08:46] followed in revelations they made it
[1:08:48] become a great big babylon
[1:08:51] and we see in our day what we call
[1:08:55] it's coming down to the forcing
[1:08:59] forcing the mark
[1:09:02] amen well i'll read you a couple quotes
[1:09:06] like
[1:09:06] everything's certainly calling towards
[1:09:09] it faster
[1:09:11] faster and faster and faster
[1:09:14] folks you better wake up when a piece of
[1:09:16] plywood is 94 dollars a sheet
[1:09:20] huh osb that was eight dollars is now
[1:09:22] thirty four dollars and not coming back
[1:09:24] down
[1:09:26] huh in inflation and so forth
[1:09:30] about him amen he was jealous just like
[1:09:32] lucifer was
[1:09:33] up in heaven he come down and he put it
[1:09:35] into mankind
[1:09:36] and here he was and abel was there cain
[1:09:39] was there
[1:09:40] abel offered a sacrifice to god and
[1:09:43] noticed this that those who have the
[1:09:45] mark of the beast better bam says it's
[1:09:46] not
[1:09:47] out there to atheism it's in churches
[1:09:52] that's where the mark of the beast is oh
[1:09:54] i got the mark of the beast i have
[1:09:56] no desire to serve god i hate god this
[1:09:58] saturday no that's called blasphemy of
[1:10:00] the holy ghost
[1:10:02] huh but the mark of the beast
[1:10:05] is to think it's your religious and to
[1:10:07] be pious and to be very
[1:10:08] religious and think you're right when
[1:10:11] you're not
[1:10:13] another mark is is that when you mix
[1:10:15] good and evil together
[1:10:17] amen you got a good tree but you mix all
[1:10:20] of the evil in with it
[1:10:22] amen that's right how many knows god
[1:10:25] it's a mixed tree
[1:10:27] all right let me see here so let's look
[1:10:29] at kane for just a little bit he had
[1:10:31] he had envy he had jealousy he had
[1:10:34] hatred
[1:10:35] and it led to murder
[1:10:39] how many knows that even jesus said he
[1:10:41] was a murderer
[1:10:43] from the beginning the devil has always
[1:10:46] been a murderer
[1:10:48] you say well i'm not a murderer do you
[1:10:51] say something bad about somebody behind
[1:10:52] their back
[1:10:54] then you're a murderer
[1:10:57] huh everybody said say something bad
[1:10:59] about your pastor
[1:11:01] a preacher you might as well shot him in
[1:11:03] the back
[1:11:04] you're a murderer you'll answer for it
[1:11:06] on the day of judgment
[1:11:09] that's exactly right for murder why
[1:11:11] because you kill his influence
[1:11:14] that's right you kill his influence and
[1:11:17] so guess what you'll answer for that
[1:11:19] i mean believe we got to watch what we
[1:11:21] say a child of god is careful about what
[1:11:23] they say
[1:11:24] that's the devil's business he can't get
[1:11:27] rid of you
[1:11:28] just kill his influence try to worry he
[1:11:30] has no influence on another body
[1:11:32] praise be to god so how many knows you
[1:11:35] christian
[1:11:36] the devil is going to come after you oh
[1:11:38] yeah you're going to have a battle
[1:11:40] amen if you're a christian cain here
[1:11:44] he was not accepted
[1:11:47] abel's sacrifice his offerings
[1:11:51] were ables were accepted
[1:11:56] i don't know about you but that's what
[1:11:57] we all want to be right we want to be
[1:11:59] accepted by god
[1:12:03] and you come god's way if you're going
[1:12:04] to be accepted
[1:12:06] not your way
[1:12:09] you know what another mark of the beast
[1:12:12] is one of the marks of the beast is that
[1:12:15] you worship god and you praise god you
[1:12:17] go to church and you
[1:12:18] do your religion do it you want to do it
[1:12:22] that's how it's going to be god can take
[1:12:25] it or you can leave it that's a mark
[1:12:28] that you marked by the devil
[1:12:31] amen because that's how king's religion
[1:12:33] was
[1:12:35] he could do it his way even after he was
[1:12:38] told the truth
[1:12:40] and which way he should do it you know
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:44] he was given the revelation so to speak
[1:12:46] to do
[1:12:47] if he'd just followed it but now how
[1:12:49] many knows that abel
[1:12:50] had a revelation that it wasn't the
[1:12:52] fruit of the trees
[1:12:54] because cain brought the fruit he
[1:12:55] brought oranges and apples and
[1:12:57] all these other things you know and what
[1:12:59] not you know but can't
[1:13:00] i'm able he had a revelation that he had
[1:13:02] to do with blood
[1:13:05] it had to do with conception it had to
[1:13:07] do with the people
[1:13:08] amen and human beings
[1:13:11] and he went and took a lamb how did
[1:13:15] abel know to take a land huh
[1:13:18] he probably had a revelation you know
[1:13:21] i'm gonna have to take something
[1:13:23] innocent that's pure there's nothing
[1:13:25] more pure and innocent than the lambs or
[1:13:27] he grabbed the land and we begin to hack
[1:13:29] it to pieces
[1:13:31] and brother baby i heard him say
[1:13:32] yesterday that cain killed
[1:13:35] abel and he died on the same rock that
[1:13:38] he killed the lamb on
[1:13:40] he says that's a type of you and i
[1:13:42] exactly where jesus died
[1:13:44] amen he was the rock and he died where
[1:13:46] the lamb dies
[1:13:47] you also have to die to yourself
[1:13:51] with your lamb i mean please that's
[1:13:54] truly the way
[1:13:55] amen to be a christian is to die amen to
[1:13:58] yourself
[1:14:00] when the bible says something and well i
[1:14:03] don't have to you're not dead yet
[1:14:06] when the bible says something you say
[1:14:08] that's right let me humble myself
[1:14:10] what was it whether we talk about how
[1:14:11] many one thing that god calls us to do
[1:14:14] is to humble ourselves
[1:14:16] it humbles it causes you to humble
[1:14:18] yourself
[1:14:19] and submit yourself to the word of god
[1:14:22] you can't do that because we as human
[1:14:24] beings we have a tendency to go the
[1:14:25] other direction
[1:14:27] we have like to live by pride
[1:14:31] be proud be the greatest be the best
[1:14:34] and so forth we don't be no footwash
[1:14:38] funky we
[1:14:38] don't be no doormat we don't want to be
[1:14:41] the least
[1:14:42] the lowest we don't want to be that
[1:14:46] but that's the way you'll be the
[1:14:47] greatest in the kingdom of god when you
[1:14:48] realize here you're nobody
[1:14:51] amen number two
[1:14:55] one of the other things that shows and
[1:14:57] this is really
[1:14:59] this is really what gives you mark of
[1:15:01] the beast
[1:15:04] this is where it lays at
[1:15:09] that is to reject
[1:15:13] the truth when it's put in front of you
[1:15:19] that is what earns you the mark of the
[1:15:22] beast
[1:15:24] and remember where does the truth come
[1:15:25] through the five-fold ministry
[1:15:28] that's where the truth comes he's a man
[1:15:31] of god telling you the truth
[1:15:33] you're not reject you're rejecting god
[1:15:39] amen
[1:15:42] and god have mercy on people's soul
[1:15:46] it's only the grace of god that will
[1:15:47] ever give you grace to repent of that
[1:15:51] because he don't have to he sure don't
[1:15:53] have to
[1:15:55] because if he ever bores you in the ear
[1:15:58] huh faith comes by hearing the mark
[1:16:01] comes by hearing
[1:16:03] cain the main mark that he had is god
[1:16:06] told him the truth
[1:16:08] and he walked away from i just can't
[1:16:09] humble myself i just can't do that i
[1:16:11] i can't do that
[1:16:15] wasn't that the pharisees and the
[1:16:16] scribes problems that's exactly what
[1:16:18] their problem
[1:16:20] was they they couldn't humble themselves
[1:16:22] because
[1:16:23] they thought that jesus was a nobody
[1:16:25] illegitimate giant a really nobody
[1:16:28] and yet he had this following and
[1:16:30] everybody would follow him and so forth
[1:16:31] they were jealous of him they didn't
[1:16:33] want to humble themselves and say
[1:16:35] that is the messiah folks we need to
[1:16:36] follow it they couldn't do that
[1:16:39] huh because they had a mark of unbelief
[1:16:45] unbelief and rejection when the truth is
[1:16:48] presented to people
[1:16:50] and they reject it
[1:16:53] we all know the story of the old
[1:16:55] testament right that every 50th year
[1:16:58] they had a set rules
[1:16:59] that if you got into debt if you got to
[1:17:01] be somebody's children or somebody slave
[1:17:03] no matter what it was
[1:17:05] after the 50 years a trumpet would be
[1:17:08] blown
[1:17:09] that everybody goes back to their
[1:17:11] natural state
[1:17:12] you get your land back you can go free
[1:17:14] you got
[1:17:16] no huh
[1:17:20] that's right but son of a man the master
[1:17:22] he gave him ribeye
[1:17:24] every night he gave him some good
[1:17:28] black wall of ice cream or mine would be
[1:17:31] calling ice cream
[1:17:32] i mean they had knives they had a bed
[1:17:35] big bag
[1:17:36] a lot of them say look look i don't want
[1:17:38] to go back
[1:17:41] i'm happy here
[1:17:46] huh why would they do that when they did
[1:17:50] not want to go free come here i'm gonna
[1:17:53] use for an example
[1:17:54] reese would take them guys come here
[1:17:56] come here come with me
[1:17:58] come on with me you don't want to go
[1:18:00] free huh
[1:18:02] all right come over here stand right
[1:18:04] there in front of everybody
[1:18:05] you take them up in front of everybody
[1:18:08] it's there right there and all of some
[1:18:11] kind isn't it right
[1:18:13] he said hey wear that all your life
[1:18:17] you can't never go free now
[1:18:20] you got to be his slave forever next 50
[1:18:24] years
[1:18:25] if you live that long hear that trumpet
[1:18:27] sound
[1:18:28] you say i'm tired of this my master beat
[1:18:30] me and i'll tell you i don't want to do
[1:18:32] this no more please
[1:18:34] he says sorry you made your decision 50
[1:18:36] years ago
[1:18:38] you can never go free thank you buddy
[1:18:41] that's what they do and then oh and they
[1:18:43] would could never
[1:18:45] be free my
[1:18:48] what a horrible thing to know that you
[1:18:51] can never
[1:18:52] be free
[1:18:57] listen lebron says about the mark of the
[1:19:00] beast he says you see what the market
[1:19:01] is oh well
[1:19:05] i know come on folks
[1:19:09] it's a relationship between you and god
[1:19:12] it's not what everybody else does
[1:19:14] or don't do not whether you
[1:19:21] can do it if you get away with the
[1:19:24] church organization that you're
[1:19:25] depending on where it come from
[1:19:27] do you realize the bible said he that
[1:19:32] beast receives his mark or the letter of
[1:19:35] his name
[1:19:35] in the forehead or hand see that's not
[1:19:39] or deed amen it's what you believe
[1:19:46] in the forehead what you believe marx i
[1:19:50] don't believe it
[1:19:51] no prophet you just told me that you got
[1:19:54] a mark in your
[1:19:56] head i see a big old mark right there
[1:20:00] you can't believe the word how about but
[1:20:03] abandonment he had that man
[1:20:04] uh said man i don't care if you would do
[1:20:07] whatever you would do i'd still not
[1:20:08] believe he says of course not it's not
[1:20:10] for unbelievers
[1:20:12] now how many knows truly unbelief is the
[1:20:14] mark because he that believeth not is
[1:20:16] damned already
[1:20:18] amen
[1:20:22] so he says it's either knowledge or
[1:20:26] it's deed nobody believes you really
[1:20:29] want to watch who you hang with
[1:20:32] you want to be very careful about who
[1:20:34] you support
[1:20:38] because it's the right hand the
[1:20:39] fellowship huh
[1:20:42] the right hand of fellowship in your
[1:20:44] hand what you fellowship with
[1:20:46] i mean what you partake of
[1:20:49] because what if you know a bad
[1:20:52] organization
[1:20:53] you're supporting that bad organization
[1:20:56] and that's a mark we are marked by who
[1:20:59] we hang with
[1:21:01] the company that we keep that right
[1:21:05] we partake just like her come out don't
[1:21:08] partake
[1:21:09] of her don't take your hand don't
[1:21:11] partake of her sins
[1:21:13] that you receive not of your plagues
[1:21:16] amen
[1:21:20] when we found out without one mistake
[1:21:24] that the mark of the beast is the mark
[1:21:26] of apostasy
[1:21:27] that is church members hanging around to
[1:21:29] their church instead of
[1:21:31] walking in the light
[1:21:35] praise be to god another one is that
[1:21:37] cain
[1:21:38] refused choose to go on
[1:21:43] far there with god deeper into
[1:21:45] revelation people
[1:21:46] that have the mark of the beast and
[1:21:48] churches that have the mark of the beast
[1:21:50] well this is what we believe
[1:21:51] and you can't come and teach us anything
[1:21:53] else
[1:21:54] they put a period behind what they
[1:21:56] believe they can't
[1:21:59] go on and they reject the truth
[1:22:04] if he that just went on it came when it
[1:22:06] went on say look i'm wrong i repent
[1:22:08] amen god had to accept him he said will
[1:22:10] y'all not be accepted if you do like
[1:22:12] abel
[1:22:17] that's another mark that's why
[1:22:19] denominations
[1:22:20] with a period why do you think brother
[1:22:22] bram stressed so much
[1:22:24] don't put a period and i won't uh come
[1:22:26] on be careful
[1:22:28] i see things a lot different than a
[1:22:29] message than what i did 20 years
[1:22:32] ago you didn't just catch it all one day
[1:22:35] and that's it no
[1:22:36] we gotta learn we gotta grow god's the
[1:22:39] only one that can put a bear
[1:22:41] period behind but he believes because
[1:22:43] he's got it perfect already
[1:22:46] amen if every thought he has is perfect
[1:22:49] amen but not us
[1:22:51] amen so that was one of the things about
[1:22:53] and another thing another thing that
[1:22:55] shows the mark of the beast

[1:27:14] lukewarm about your religion when he
[1:27:16] tries to break jealousy

[1:27:19] to make hatred

[1:27:23] things into your life and make you

[1:27:36] don't you get back slit on god
[1:27:40] don't you get lukewarm on god now don't
[1:27:42] you go backwards
[1:27:44] we're going forward we're going to meet
[1:27:45] the lord one of these days
[1:27:48] amen coming to the coming of the lord is
[1:27:52] so
[1:27:52] great a secret until brother batman the
[1:27:54] seventh seal talked about it's a coming
[1:27:55] lord
[1:27:56] nobody knows about it nobody knows the
[1:27:59] day nobody knows the hour
[1:28:01] we don't know just how it's going to be
[1:28:04] amen but it'll happen it's going to
[1:28:07] happen one of these days folks
[1:28:09] and i want to be in it don't you oh my
[1:28:12] that's right people think that this is
[1:28:15] just gonna
[1:28:15] go on and on
[1:28:19] and on it's not always gonna go on like
[1:28:22] this folks
[1:28:25] no it's not there's coming a rapture
[1:28:29] and that are those that are marked with
[1:28:31] the beast
[1:28:32] will stay amen
[1:28:36] let's talk about another category of
[1:28:37] people for a second how about the
[1:28:39] foolish virgin
[1:28:42] huh maybe message people that live a
[1:28:45] pretty clean pretty decent life
[1:28:47] but they really haven't gotten the holy
[1:28:49] ghost
[1:28:52] oh there wasn't smoke or drink or all
[1:28:54] the other stuff no they're too good for
[1:28:55] that
[1:28:56] they're clean but they're not filled
[1:28:58] with the how holy ghost
[1:29:01] not the power to amen to rejoice and
[1:29:05] to live a life worthy of the gospel
[1:29:08] make you love everybody to reach out to
[1:29:11] the neighbors
[1:29:12] to do something for god just it just
[1:29:15] don't have their lamp stream
[1:29:17] because remember even brother bam said
[1:29:19] back in his day
[1:29:20] scientists said they was three minutes
[1:29:22] to midnight and i happen to believe that
[1:29:24] we hit them in that hour
[1:29:26] because if you notice at midnight there
[1:29:28] was a song that went forth
[1:29:30] that said grize and trim your lamps
[1:29:34] how many believes that's that message as
[1:29:35] far as i can concern
[1:29:37] and there was a message rise and trim
[1:29:39] your lamps
[1:29:40] the wise came up they why god wise and
[1:29:43] trim their lamps
[1:29:45] got all of that stuff off of their life
[1:29:47] that causes them not to shine like they
[1:29:50] should
[1:29:52] but the foolish didn't have any oil in
[1:29:55] their lamps
[1:29:58] let me light that light take a lamp up
[1:30:00] let me light that light
[1:30:02] i want to be on fire for god let me
[1:30:04] light that light
[1:30:06] huh
[1:30:09] it burns a little bit
[1:30:13] out it goes burns a little bit
[1:30:16] out it goes why
[1:30:20] does it go out that's right brother
[1:30:23] stephen thank you
[1:30:24] because there's no oil in it you can't
[1:30:27] light a light without oil
[1:30:32] you know what happens to the foolish
[1:30:34] virgins
[1:30:36] they get hunted down and shot in the
[1:30:38] head like dogs
[1:30:41] and they're right carnegie's probably
[1:30:42] god that's right they still want to have
[1:30:44] their testimony and they'll have to give
[1:30:46] their lives
[1:30:47] for their testimony because they didn't
[1:30:49] have any oil
[1:30:51] amen the bride's not here at that time
[1:30:55] pride is gone we leave
[1:30:59] when the squeeze comes they squeeze this
[1:31:02] out
[1:31:03] that's right that's why i'm seeing
[1:31:05] brothers and sisters the signs of the
[1:31:06] time
[1:31:07] the squeeze is coming down quick
[1:31:10] praise the lord let it come i'm ready
[1:31:12] for it let it come
[1:31:14] our jobs our bank account money it isn't
[1:31:17] going to mean that much
[1:31:19] one of these days then we're going to
[1:31:22] ask ourselves
[1:31:23] what did we do on those sunday mornings
[1:31:25] what would we do on those weeks that we
[1:31:27] had week after week after week when the
[1:31:30] preacher told us he better be ready
[1:31:33] not just ready but waiting how many
[1:31:35] remember brother brown says you in
[1:31:36] tucson you in arizona you press god
[1:31:38] you waiting waiting on the coming of the
[1:31:41] lord
[1:31:42] that's how we are this morning folks so
[1:31:44] many years down the road
[1:31:47] we better be ready and waiting
[1:31:51] on the coming of the lord and as
[1:31:54] straight
[1:31:55] and as narrow as the path is hello
[1:31:58] i think we should all ask ourselves am i
[1:32:01] walking that narrow path
[1:32:03] that straight road
[1:32:06] am i going to broadway my way
[1:32:10] however i want to amen
[1:32:16] all right
[1:32:21] so he says and then that all that was
[1:32:23] not sealed by the holy ghost
[1:32:25] was took on the mark of the beast and
[1:32:28] the mark of the beast is the mark of
[1:32:30] apostasy
[1:32:31] which is rejecting
[1:32:35] the holy ghost how many knows that judas
[1:32:39] was one that rejected the holy ghost
[1:32:46] even brother brahm said he was
[1:32:47] sanctified
[1:32:49] he was clean he was called
[1:32:52] he was justified judas was sanctified
[1:32:56] but when it come time to go to pentecost
[1:32:59] he never went did he
[1:33:01] never went to the baptism of the holy
[1:33:03] ghost in his soul
[1:33:04] that right that's what what happened
[1:33:07] with judas
[1:33:08] and then brother bran says that the
[1:33:10] denominations have done the same thing
[1:33:12] they came through justification they
[1:33:14] came through sanctification
[1:33:16] isn't that right they even had the gifts
[1:33:18] of tongues they even have the gifts of
[1:33:20] the spirit
[1:33:21] but when it came to living the life
[1:33:25] when it came to accepting the full word
[1:33:29] of god
[1:33:30] they put him on the outside they ought
[1:33:33] to see it right
[1:33:34] that church put him out
[1:33:38] lean that to your own understanding
[1:33:39] brother branham clearly explains it
[1:33:43] anybody go down there we'll
[1:33:44] excommunicate him
[1:33:46] go to the meetings we'll excommunicate
[1:33:48] him one man said
[1:33:50] you know brother branham i had to put a
[1:33:51] man out because he went to your meetings
[1:33:54] well brother brown says so what so that
[1:33:56] means he's not going to make it to
[1:33:58] heaven he says you mean you're a
[1:33:59] presbyter and you
[1:34:00] believe that get off the phone mister
[1:34:05] only time i ever knew a brother man i'm
[1:34:07] practically hanging up on somebody
[1:34:09] huh what was it they leaned to their own
[1:34:12] understanding they rejected the word of
[1:34:15] god folks
[1:34:17] they took the mark of the beast
[1:34:20] because brother branham clearly tells us
[1:34:22] that the mark of the beast that's what
[1:34:24] it is today the seal of god is the holy
[1:34:26] spirit
[1:34:27] to reject it is the mark of the beast
[1:34:31] amen ever who sees the holy ghost
[1:34:35] that you're supposed to receive it and
[1:34:37] then don't do it
[1:34:38] automatically take the mark of the beast
[1:34:42] because there's only two classes that
[1:34:44] exists
[1:34:46] amen all that didn't have the seal of
[1:34:48] god
[1:34:49] had the mark of the beast so to receive
[1:34:52] the seal of god is to receive the holy
[1:34:54] ghost
[1:34:54] to reject it is to have the mark of the
[1:34:58] beast and there's the whole thing
[1:35:00] that's exactly right and remember
[1:35:03] brother bam says that this is not just
[1:35:04] something that's happened in our day
[1:35:06] this happened in every age the mark of
[1:35:09] the beast has been going on
[1:35:11] in every age because why people either
[1:35:14] receive what god had
[1:35:16] or they rejected what god had they
[1:35:18] either took that mark of unbelief like
[1:35:20] cain
[1:35:21] or they received the blessings of god
[1:35:24] amen and you and i we're living in the
[1:35:27] hour when the
[1:35:28] when when it's been exposed how many
[1:35:30] knows never before
[1:35:32] i don't believe ever before have we
[1:35:34] understood what the mark of the beast is
[1:35:36] like we do today
[1:35:39] mark of organization mark of formal
[1:35:42] religion
[1:35:43] even coming to church and oh and it's a
[1:35:46] dread
[1:35:47] huh it sure ain't the holy ghost
[1:35:50] hello because that's what israel had
[1:35:52] done they got to where it was just the
[1:35:54] form
[1:35:55] just like it was with cain it was just a
[1:35:58] form
[1:35:58] to make themselves feel better but never
[1:36:01] go
[1:36:01] on to the full baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:07] i trust and hope because it's my heart's
[1:36:09] desire as a pastor that every one of us
[1:36:11] has the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:13] in our soul because if you don't you're
[1:36:15] going to be left behind
[1:36:20] don't reject the baptism of the holy
[1:36:23] ghost
[1:36:24] in your soul
[1:36:28] and believe me it's not so hard to do
[1:36:31] it's not so hard to do amen
[1:36:35] think about that
[1:36:42] the mark of leadership is what
[1:36:45] lukewarmness
[1:36:47] have need of nothing rich and increased
[1:36:50] with goods
[1:36:52] huh isn't that where we're living we're
[1:36:55] living in a layout of cih
[1:36:57] when the world we act like we're super
[1:37:00] rich
[1:37:01] when we're super broke
[1:37:06] wretched miserable poor blind
[1:37:09] and naked and the worst part of it all
[1:37:14] is people don't know it
[1:37:18] how many truly believes that it takes
[1:37:20] the holy spirit
[1:37:21] to come into your life and show you
[1:37:24] where you're wrong
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:26] it takes god because you will look
[1:37:29] through the eyes
[1:37:31] of the spirit that you have on your mind
[1:37:34] will
[1:37:35] absolutely think according to the spirit
[1:37:38] that you have on you denominations they
[1:37:42] thought hey
[1:37:42] i don't have to accept that i don't have
[1:37:44] to believe that
[1:37:45] but god loved this world so much hello
[1:37:49] god loved this age so much that he
[1:37:52] didn't just have somebody like
[1:37:54] uh billy graham or roberts come and
[1:37:56] preach the gospel because
[1:37:57] billy graham was very effective in
[1:38:00] preaching the gospel that it's for all
[1:38:02] whosoever will
[1:38:04] come repent amen and they came and they
[1:38:06] repented they repented they repented but
[1:38:08] they never got filled with the holy
[1:38:09] ghost
[1:38:10] they wearied themselves to find the door
[1:38:14] and god could adjust because that's
[1:38:15] basically possible go preach the gospel
[1:38:18] he didn't believe that his baptized
[1:38:19] shall be saved he didn't believe in that
[1:38:20] shall be them but brother brahm says god
[1:38:22] doesn't go
[1:38:23] just there but and then he still loves
[1:38:25] the people more
[1:38:27] and he goes and he shows signs and
[1:38:29] wonders
[1:38:31] to try to what to get the people to
[1:38:34] believe
[1:38:34] how many knows that was brother
[1:38:36] branham's ministry was you know he said
[1:38:38] these miracles
[1:38:39] it's to attract the attention of people
[1:38:43] oh my did you hear about the healings
[1:38:45] that are going forth man
[1:38:46] they'd go home and tell grandma my
[1:38:49] cousin my uncle you've got cancer you
[1:38:50] can't see
[1:38:51] you've got to come to these meetings god
[1:38:53] is coming and opening the eyes and
[1:38:55] they come and every every day that
[1:38:57] brother branham would stay in there
[1:38:58] longer
[1:38:59] they would multiply perhaps another time
[1:39:02] as many as what they had the night
[1:39:03] before
[1:39:04] because of the word that would spread it
[1:39:07] had such an
[1:39:08] outreach if god was merciful so this is
[1:39:10] what i'll do to try
[1:39:12] to get the people to believe not in
[1:39:14] evolution but that there is a god
[1:39:17] that he is a healer and it wasn't just
[1:39:19] the heal of people but he was trying to
[1:39:20] get the people to believe
[1:39:23] what he says try to get him to believe
[1:39:26] the word
[1:39:27] how many knows they all why not the
[1:39:29] prophet of god they all wanted that but
[1:39:30] when he preached the seals
[1:39:33] hello when he preached the seals and he
[1:39:34] said denominationalism
[1:39:36] is absolutely the mark of the beast
[1:39:40] was too much for them right they
[1:39:43] couldn't handle the word just like they
[1:39:44] did in jesus
[1:39:45] they came to him and their mother had 70
[1:39:48] they had thousands 3 000
[1:39:50] and all kinds of people say unless you
[1:39:52] eat my flesh and you drink my blood
[1:39:54] you have no part with me they scratched
[1:39:58] their heads
[1:40:00] my gracious my gracious
[1:40:03] my gracious what's he gonna do slit his
[1:40:06] risk
[1:40:07] and put it in a cup and make us all
[1:40:09] drink his blood
[1:40:11] what's he going to do take chunks of his
[1:40:13] flesh
[1:40:15] huh and give us a piece of his flesh to
[1:40:17] eat
[1:40:19] they had no revelation did they
[1:40:22] probably god had said he said it thinned
[1:40:25] down the crowd
[1:40:27] probably god sometimes preached or
[1:40:28] preached to thin down the crowd
[1:40:34] and it worked all the seven he says who
[1:40:37] can hear this saying
[1:40:40] who can who you know who's the idiot
[1:40:42] enough to follow this guy
[1:40:44] who's idiot enough to listen to what
[1:40:47] he's got to say i'm out here
[1:40:48] and they said they all left
[1:40:52] and how many knows that's what happened
[1:40:54] in our day god did all those signs all
[1:40:57] those
[1:40:57] wonders and then he told the truth about
[1:40:59] the mark of the beast organization and
[1:41:01] everything else
[1:41:02] and they all pick their hands off
[1:41:06] amen
[1:41:10] let's talk about the squeeze for just a
[1:41:11] minute should that be all right
[1:41:16] brother brandon means talking about the
[1:41:17] third pool
[1:41:19] amen of course being the opening of the
[1:41:21] word for one
[1:41:22] he said a lot about the third pole isn't
[1:41:24] that right being the speaking of the
[1:41:26] word
[1:41:28] creating of squirrels different things
[1:41:29] like that
[1:41:31] am i right he says now remember
[1:41:36] i'm going to say something to you now
[1:41:38] that i haven't said all along and that
[1:41:39] is the thing that we have looked for
[1:41:41] for so long or at least the last few
[1:41:44] years he says now the third pool has
[1:41:47] been vindicated
[1:41:49] i'm sure you all know it now remember
[1:41:51] there'll never be any impersonation of
[1:41:53] that because it can't
[1:41:54] cannot be i'm warned of this that soon
[1:41:58] listen it is to identify its presence
[1:42:02] among you
[1:42:03] but it will not be used in a great way
[1:42:06] until the council begins to tighten
[1:42:09] up and when it does
[1:42:13] now the pentecostals they can
[1:42:14] impersonate almost anything get
[1:42:16] done but when the squeeze comes down
[1:42:18] then you'll see what you have seen
[1:42:20] temporarily
[1:42:21] be manifested in the fullness
[1:42:25] of its power how many knows
[1:42:30] we really do not know just what our
[1:42:32] futures
[1:42:33] is going to be we do know one thing and
[1:42:37] that is that
[1:42:39] it's going to get worse not better
[1:42:43] it made right now it seems like things
[1:42:45] are pretty good
[1:42:47] but not they're getting worse
[1:42:51] they're getting worse fast
[1:42:56] amen but it'll be manifested in its
[1:42:59] fullness of his power
[1:43:01] listen this will be the thing that to my
[1:43:04] opinion
[1:43:05] this will be the thing that will start
[1:43:06] the rapturing faith for the going away
[1:43:10] see i must lay quiet for just a little
[1:43:13] while listen to you who's listening to
[1:43:18] this tape
[1:43:19] you might see some strange in my
[1:43:21] ministry
[1:43:22] like dropping back not going forward
[1:43:24] 1963
[1:43:25] isn't that exactly what the prophet did
[1:43:27] barely had any open doors
[1:43:29] just here and there and he kind of
[1:43:32] receded
[1:43:33] kind of went the other way because he
[1:43:36] had been rejected
[1:43:37] he went to phoenix three years been out
[1:43:39] there he said none of them invited him
[1:43:41] to his churches
[1:43:43] so he was dropping back and he says lay
[1:43:46] and quiet
[1:43:48] until this something else catches up you
[1:43:51] might
[1:43:52] see it dropping back right now at this
[1:43:54] age here
[1:43:55] we can't go any further we have to wait
[1:43:58] here
[1:44:00] just a minute until this happens over
[1:44:02] here watch up
[1:44:05] how many knows he was a prophet of god
[1:44:07] he could see the future
[1:44:08] he knew things he knew there would be
[1:44:11] some time
[1:44:13] for perhaps these prophecies and the
[1:44:15] things that he said
[1:44:16] would have to catch up how many believes
[1:44:19] with me this morning
[1:44:20] it's catching up it's catching up folks
[1:44:26] yes it is then the time comes but it's
[1:44:30] thoroughly identified he says there's
[1:44:32] coming a time upon this nation to where
[1:44:34] this nation is going to
[1:44:36] exercise all the power of the first
[1:44:39] beast before it
[1:44:41] according to revelations the 13th
[1:44:43] chapter it clearly dis
[1:44:46] states it revelation 13
[1:44:51] i want to just read it of course he
[1:44:53] talks about us
[1:44:54] being that lamb that come up out of the
[1:44:56] earth isn't that right with the two
[1:44:57] horns and so forth
[1:45:01] but it says and let me just read this
[1:45:03] here about revelations talking about
[1:45:05] causes both rich and poor and he that
[1:45:07] had power to give life
[1:45:08] unto the image of the beast
[1:45:12] that the image of the beast was all now
[1:45:15] i heard another band say
[1:45:16] nobody's exempt rich poor free bound
[1:45:18] whatever it is
[1:45:19] he causes all both great rich
[1:45:23] and poor free and bond to receive a mark
[1:45:26] in their right hand
[1:45:28] or in their foreheads
[1:45:32] amen folks i don't know about you but
[1:45:34] i'm watching very closely about
[1:45:37] anything that would cause you to have to
[1:45:39] believe like they do
[1:45:41] because we certainly have some doctrines
[1:45:42] and things going on out there that
[1:45:44] if you don't see it their way isn't that
[1:45:47] right
[1:45:48] then you're gonna get it if you don't
[1:45:50] participate in this
[1:45:53] in your hand or in your head right
[1:45:56] don't participate in this we'll cut you
[1:45:59] off
[1:46:00] because we know that this is something
[1:46:02] as simple
[1:46:03] as a boycott a financial squeeze
[1:46:07] can't buy or sell unless you participate
[1:46:11] in it
[1:46:13] so keep your eyes open keep your ears
[1:46:15] open be careful
[1:46:16] because that's what it'll come down to
[1:46:20] then maybe not come and threaten you
[1:46:21] with a gun into your forehead
[1:46:23] but according to the scriptures you
[1:46:25] won't be able to buy or sell
[1:46:27] get groceries
[1:46:30] i mean i might say something if you
[1:46:32] don't get onto me too bad this afternoon
[1:46:34] but
[1:46:34] it's she wondering donna wonders why in
[1:46:37] the world
[1:46:38] you know you can go into walmart store
[1:46:39] and they'll have it there but if you
[1:46:41] ordered online guess what this is not
[1:46:43] available for her pickup
[1:46:45] you know hey let me tell you bill
[1:46:48] you know you look at you look at what's
[1:46:51] been bought off the banks
[1:46:53] and that right our car dealerships
[1:46:56] here in the years past paid for by the
[1:46:59] government
[1:46:59] now they're coming down into our small
[1:47:01] business
[1:47:02] and they're giving us money something's
[1:47:06] fishy here folks
[1:47:08] isn't that right
[1:47:11] that's right and i'm just telling you i
[1:47:14] believe it
[1:47:15] i believe it's right it's coming close
[1:47:18] this mark of the beast
[1:47:20] or should i say i won't say the mark of
[1:47:22] the beast the mark of the beast is here
[1:47:24] already
[1:47:25] mark of the beast is here every time you
[1:47:26] come to church whether you receive god's
[1:47:27] word or not
[1:47:29] you get marked but the forcing of it
[1:47:32] the forcing of it is what it's all about
[1:47:35] amen to receive and that no my man can
[1:47:38] buy
[1:47:39] or sell save he that had the mark or the
[1:47:41] name of the beast or the number
[1:47:43] of his name amen and of course here is
[1:47:46] wisdom that he would have understanding
[1:47:48] amen count the number of the beasts for
[1:47:49] it is the number of a man and his number
[1:47:51] is 600 and three score and skip
[1:47:53] six and of course we have to get into
[1:47:55] the pope catholics and how they own the
[1:47:57] girl of the world
[1:47:58] how did jews own the stocks in that
[1:48:00] right
[1:48:02] amen and so we find that that 666 points
[1:48:06] back to there
[1:48:07] but remember it's not the beast that
[1:48:10] speaks
[1:48:11] it's the image of the beast that speaks
[1:48:15] there's something that gives the power
[1:48:17] gives power to the image of the beast
[1:48:19] to enforce these things
[1:48:22] brother brahm talked about how that a
[1:48:24] woman would rule
[1:48:26] that right a woman would rule perhaps
[1:48:29] the catholic church
[1:48:32] because they're going to bail us out
[1:48:34] whether that has happened already i as a
[1:48:36] man as a pastor couldn't tell you
[1:48:40] you know just what goes on behind the
[1:48:41] scenes whether it has
[1:48:43] or whether we have to get in so deep and
[1:48:45] we may still see it
[1:48:47] and hear about it wouldn't it be
[1:48:50] something that if you and i did find out
[1:48:52] hey
[1:48:52] somebody's paying off our national debt
[1:48:55] huh
[1:48:58] be exactly in line with the scriptures
[1:49:01] and then guess what when they
[1:49:03] when they pay it off they own you
[1:49:08] what man so many quotes brother bam said
[1:49:10] talk about this woman was cruel
[1:49:12] with the people and so forth and that
[1:49:13] right with the americans
[1:49:15] has no respect for your democracy or
[1:49:18] your constitution or any of that
[1:49:20] none whatsoever folks how many knows the
[1:49:23] world is falling apart
[1:49:25] amen and getting ready to leave that's
[1:49:27] what jesus said be
[1:49:29] ready be ready i don't care if it
[1:49:31] happens another 10 years from i don't
[1:49:33] care how long
[1:49:33] as a pastor i say you make sure your
[1:49:36] heart is right with god
[1:49:38] and that you are sealed in by the holy
[1:49:41] spirit and don't let the devil try to
[1:49:43] take that away from you cause you to
[1:49:45] doubt the word
[1:49:46] amen to reject the word because if you
[1:49:49] do
[1:49:50] it's to take the mark of the beast amen
[1:49:52] trusted
[1:49:53] we can all have a closer closer walk
[1:49:57] with god i don't know about you but i
[1:49:59] want to be like that little girl that
[1:50:00] was
[1:50:01] that had a date of that
[1:50:04] uh rich man's son it was at the may
[1:50:08] company or something

[1:50:23] these cousins they did all their hair up
[1:50:25] and oh my
[1:50:27] you know looked really good but if
[1:50:29] they'd have washed their face it'd
[1:50:30] probably been scary
[1:50:33] this one girl stayed home and washed the
[1:50:35] dishes and cleaned
[1:50:37] worked hard amen it was must have been
[1:50:40] the house was close to the barn where
[1:50:41] they were doing all this isn't that
[1:50:42] right
[1:50:43] there she was throwing the wash water
[1:50:45] out he had done dance with all of these
[1:50:47] girls and
[1:50:48] all of this stuff that's true brother
[1:50:50] jesus done danced with all these
[1:50:52] churches
[1:50:54] he done had you know try to see if they
[1:50:56] would be his bride and so forth
[1:50:59] but they cared more about their church
[1:51:01] and
[1:51:02] the way they want to be than they did
[1:51:04] him
[1:51:06] and so he went outside get a little
