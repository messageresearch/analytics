you feel like bringing amen Saturday make sure you bring plenty of worms amen your fishing pole amen and after service if somebody would help me I would like to load up one more uh uh picnic table and two benches on that trailer out there if some of you young fellas would help me out get that loaded up we want to get that down there and we're going to try to put a few benches down there along the creek so some of us folks can sit down when we're fishing amen so anyway but uh any four-wheelers and things like that we've got a pretty good path cleared anybody that wants to walk in 96 degree weather you might want to keep in the shade amen so anyway it's supposed to be warm by I'm praying Lord give us just a little bit of a northern wind maybe that day maybe he'll cool it down for us we sure would be nice amen but pot luck so everybody brings a dish amen and about 11 o'clock we'll get started amen if you want to come earlier to fish that's fine too amen but we're just given a general time amen for the majority of us to be there we'll try to eat by about 12 amen and fellowship together and so amen looking forward to a good time of Fellowship amen and amen and being together amen so praise the lord we certainly always like that um so if you have any questions or something feel free to text or ask amen but um uh I'm going to have plenty of ice and water and things like that uh you know for everybody try to have that all you know organized and so forth amen so praise the lord I can't think of any other announcements so let's land amen go before the Lord in prayer and we'll try to get right into the service amen and so we'll just see what the Lord will have for certainly enjoyed brother Brad's message Sunday didn't we very very good outstanding message we really really appreciate it amen amen and we want to try to take off tonight amen Again part five brother Glenn amen anden we're going to talk amen about going into that Promised Land because I think we talked a little bit about the chastisement of the Lord and power without character is satanic and so God Amen is working on us amen because the gold that God is looking look for I consel Thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich amen and that uh you know that thou mayest be closed the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and all of that and so the thing that God is looking for and once most out of us amen is our character because we know that's the only thing that we can take with us isin't that right amen and I want to talk with the help of the Lord in the aspect of the children of Israel and we want to talk a little bit about the Journey of the children of Israel typing even each and every individual amen as a Christian we go it's like the Christian walk is like a journey amen from the time that you're born again amen you're on a journey amen you're on a journey amen it might be justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost is it right amen and so we want to go into the promised land tonight amen and we want to talk a little bit about where we live is't that right because we're either living in the wilderness amen we're still in the wilderness maybe circling a mountain or whatever it might be going circling for 40 years some of us might be in the promised land I don't know just where you are but with tonight's help maybe the word of God will kind of show you where you are because it's important how many knows it's important for us to know where you are amen and the question it's a really big question is where do you live amen where are you living am me what's stage amen so amen I think um amen thank the Lord for amen a little microphone that works amen and so we'll just go before the Lord in prayer amen amen so let's bow our heads kind Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and so grateful Lord Jesus of all the great and precious promises that you have given us Lord Jesus father we want to look at some of those promises Lord Jesus J and looking at father coming into the full promise of God tonight Lord Jesus that Lord Jesus we don't know just where everybody is you do but we ask God that you'd help each and everyone that our objective and our purpose father our goal so to speak Lord is to go into that promised land and to walk with you Lord like Joshua and them did Father we ask Lord that you would just bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to minister tonight which is ask God that you come anoint now Lord and say what you once said use my lips father use my mind use my heart father and achieve your objective tonight for we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen amen there's a lot of quotes amen that I probably am mean won't even get to amen but amen if you will turn your Bibles amen I meant to um if you will turn your Bibles to back to deuteron omy amen and I come up with this one here after since Brother Brad asked me of my scriptures Deuteronomy 2 amen and then we have a few other scriptures that we want to go to and start off with amen I wish I had about four hours right about now amen amen this is taking so much I mean I taking so much and trying to cover so much ground in one night I uh so we'll just trust the Lord Deuteronomy 2 and verse 1 then we turned and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me and and we compassed Mount Seer many days and the Lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward and command thou the people saying ye are to path through the coast of your brethren the children of isra which dwell in sier and they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore meddle not with them for I am not I will not give you of their of their land no not so much as a foot breath because I've given you mount seir I have given Mount Z unto Esau for a possession over in Romans 8 Romans 8 very familiar scripture in verse 29 8 and verse 29 for whom he did know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen this evening amen amen praise the Lord amen so we basically want to go amen we want to talk just a little bit about how that we know that God when he called the children of Israel out of Egypt amen the first thing that he did amen of course called them out of Egypt they gave him a prophet amen Moses and he pulled them out of there and they begin a journey isn't that right a journey to the promised land amen and you and I amen also are on a journey to the promised land or I want to say to the full promise of God and I truly believe that the full promise of God to me anyway is going to be the translation of our bodies ain't that right because how many knows that's our goal that's our our objective amen I was going to I want to I want to First was going to call this achievable goals amen amen but I want to speak amen I titled it I think online if I'm not wrong amen the uh possessing the full promise of God going into the full promise of God so Israel begin their Journey amen and of course we know even as we mentioned last time that God begin to try them a that right he begin to test them amen and if I'm not wrong I don't have the scriptures tonight but uh I believe one place it talks about I believe after kades Baria God says these 10 times I believe it was have I tested and have I tried Israel ain't that right and these T about 10 times took God before he amen they took it back out into the Wilderness amen and let him all die and live there for 40 years left them staying out there and die amen until all of those who were disbelievers and unbelievers amen had died out now another thought that come Comes This is this and that is that even after Joshua and Caleb even after they took their children back into the promised land we know that ultimately Israel backslid ain't that right amen served other gods and and and I believe either through Moses or one of the prophets they even prophesied and said that they would amen because God foresaw that they eventually would even get away from God Amen and even after being in the promised land after all that they had gotten they still got away from God Amen and as we look at ourselves going into the promised land there's a lot of examples amen given to us amen examples that we don't want to be like because I believe Paul in uh 1 Corinthians 10 talked about these were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things amen so God give us even in the New Testament examples of what we don't want to be like and I think I touched on it last time talking about you know we want to be this Samson amen used in the hands of almighty God is that right amen that God could use Samson in such a way to kill a thousand Philistines or even in his death after repenting more than that even but what a mighty man that Samson was when he was surrendered to God how that the power of God came down in a mighty way amen and he used him Amen to you know really bring forth the glory of what God can do when a man is completely surrendered to God the same way with Moses when he was surrendered you know but the opposite side of Samson was is that he had his heart was with Delilah he had given his strength to God Amen and how knows that when you are not completely surrendered to God heart mind soul and strength if you don't love the Lord thy God with all heart you'll end up amen having trouble we find that trouble is the same as Abraham had even though he's elected he was chosen just like you're elected like you're chosen amen of God still Abraham had a lot of trouble because he did not fully obey the word of God Amen because he says leave your father and mother leave your Kindred come out here and he brought his dad along brought lot along brought his nephew along and they had fusses and fights and all kinds of problems amen the head because that Abraham didn't fully obey Amen brother bam says he says you'll never never be fully blessed until you fully obey amen we in the message think about it we have been going on this journey for I I'm not sure maybe 53 something years since the prophet left it's been a little while isn't that right amen and the reason I read that in Deuteronomy is because a lot of our quotes will come from amen the message called Turn northward amen so let's start amen praise the Lord you love the Lord Amen brother bam says now he after reading Deuteronomy he says you know he wanted to he says now it would be hard for Israel to think that the promised land was 40 years away when they were standing on the other side of the Red Sea dancing shouting rejoicing and when they only they were only merely just a few days from it he said it isn't but just a very short time I think with an automobile you could probably drive it in about an hour and a half by walking you could make it in two days something like that something or other easy you could go on to the promised land amen again he says this and they were thinking that they were almost there and they were having a great Jubilee of sh outing and praising God and seeing what God had did for them and how that it had been hard it would be hard for them to make believe that there was 40 years from that promise to the full promise of God that he promised that's what we want to talk about IM comeing and possessing the full promise of God not just part of it amen uh when I when I pulled that up one Place brother bam says talking about turning northward he says one place and I didn't bring the quote but he says you know it's time to get away from all of that mountain and going in circle and so forth and go into the full promise of God where Jes where where Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe go and enter into a place where your prayers he said are answered God answers your prayer how many Jesus Jesus the promise one of the promises of God is if you abide in me and I in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done so you ask well why is not God not answering my prayers amen well maybe you're not abiding him in him like you should all right so now notice he says there were 40 years it would be hard to imagine he said that Grace had provided them a great thing gra Grace had Pro provided them a Passover Lamb Grace had provided them a prophet and Grace had provided them an angel amen amen and the Passover Lamb was for their sins their Prophet was their instruction instructor the angel was their Guide G Grace had provided them everything for them but but in spite of all that they still wanted a law amen how many's glad for what Grace had provided it was right there right there at their fingertips listen to this this Israel is the spiritual just as God was talking to his people taking his people to a promised land in the natural he's taking his church to a promised land in the spiritual amen they was on their Road having a great time yet but and after Grace had been provided everything that they have need of yet they wanted something to do themselves something that they could show God they had something to do in it oh Church listen when it gets into that condition it's always when they lose out when you try amen any man tries to put his hand on the work of God or add something to it or take something away we must leave it just the way God provided it for us just let the Revival move on as the spirit moves on Amen these people were only 8 to 10 days away from the full promise of God if they would have followed the leading of the holy spirit amen these people in this day our fathers was just a few days away from the fullness of the promise of God if they' have just kept following the leading of the spirit but they had to have something to do in it amen let me go back for just a minute I meant to say this amen a page back and that is amen Grace has supplied us for everything that you have need of the full baptism the full walk with God Amen it is isn't somewhere far away amen it is right here how many believes the baptism of the Holy Ghost young people it is right here for you it's not off like the devil trying to make you think that it's so far so hard to grasp no it's right here it's right amen at the next repentance it's the next confession it's the next full surrenderance to God Amen that's all it is it's just one amen inspiration away so to speak how many believes it's right here it's not off on some distance land it's right here it's here provided for you amen it's not all far it's not far away it's right here close right here healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's right here so close by us and yet people miss it now notice now I want to say this and I want to say this not because I'm picking not because I'm fighting but I want to say that it seems to be because I hear receive texts a lot of times and so many negative things about message people this is wrong in the message that's wrong in the message this that or the other amen and then they'll have some kind of a praise of come out from among them what are you trying to say that we need to come out of the message but yes what is is somebody trying to get somebody to follow him come on folks I've been in this message 30 years I smell the devil when I smell him and I see him when I see him I hear him when I hear him that's right let me tell you something people around this message might be a mess but this message is not a mess this message is perfect this is going to take a people into Rapture and I'm going believe I'm a part of it people can focus on the back side of Israel like uh you know that that false prophet didn't all look all or wrong but in the midst of it all amen there was the pillar of fire god was in it but no somebody always wants there's always Pride just like Nathan and Cara amen they wanted to have something also to do hey you're not the only one that's a leader we're kind of great we want to be great anytime you want to be great and you want to be a somebody look out folks that's ain't nothing but the spirit Spirit of the devil the devil will show you all the false and all the wrong and the message to get you Amen to have no confidence in the message that God has brought wo hello how many believes this message will take a per people to the Rapture you're going to come out of this message out where are you going to go to prophet of God said there is no other messenger coming there is no other vind ation coming the next thing to come is the rapture amen praise the Lord I believe I don't know about you but I believe that is time to possess the promises of God it's time to quit going around in circles and keep doing oh I get tired of myself folks I don't want to keep doing the things that I'm doing I want to move forward I want to get past these things like brother Bri said man I want the fear I want it to be in my under my feet I want it to be in the past anxiety all those things I want it to be something thing we don't have to worry about anymore it's in my past overcome amen praise the Lord you love him but no they had to have something to do with it they wanted a law they want it to be like somebody else they want to be like the world they want to have something that they did folks I'm here to tell you when we try to be a big shot of big church more than them and the best preacher you're in for fall God will back away from you Lord help us the only one that gets the glory around here is God Amen at the baptism of the Holy Ghost the leadership of the spirit amen praise the Lord all right listen but we always try to put our own ideas in it then when we inject our own ideas when we inject our theology into God's spirit it takes God's spirit away amen that's the way it was in that day they were on the road but they wanted something they could do themselves oh they were fussing and through into all their carrying on they found out that they had drove the spirit of God away from them and it was a great mistake it was a great mistake when what we did the same thing our fathers when the Holy Spirit fell on ausu Street in many parts of the world we should have just let it go how many believes God gave us a message amen don't add to don't take away just let the Holy Ghost Amen Let Us ride this thing R into Glory ride into a a a Rapture amen don't look to the right and don't look to the left keep your eyes straight on the word of God on the message of the hour it will produce a Rapture amen but what did they do brother Braham said in this and I didn't pull it out but he says you know he would have loved to been there he said as USA Street in them places he said whenever they said it was a disgrace when they brought song books into the church why because everything was done in the spirit he said wow they were really they believed in being led by the spirit amen how many believ you being led by the spirit oh my we just let it go on the leading of the spirit keep the world out and go on let the Holy Spirit lead he said we'd have done been in the promised land but we've had 40s something years away from it just as they did so have we amen something came into the church another issue and we want it to denominate ourselves instead of just going ahead loving the Brethren going on Amen why didn't you just leave it alone every plant that my father has not planted will be rooted up amen always somebody wants see something amen no selfish motive will work no selfish motive will work again he says we find that they made that F fatal mistake and they raised a big bunch of Fighters he says and that's what we have is a big bunch of Fighters one saying well bless God I'm assemblies I'm oness amen don't you have anything to do in it that Old Church of God we got it Church of God bless God we're the ones that's got it we got the promised thing the one that says we got it because we baptized right Hallelujah you bunch of Fighters hello isn't that what Paul said to the Corinthians he says man you're still children amen there's divisions among you and say I'm a Paul I'm a this I'm a that you're still babies God is Not Looking for babies God is Not Looking for uh uh teenagers so to speak amen God is looking for sons and daughters that are in His image W I want to tell you I don't believe that it's too big of a goal for each and every one of us to say God I want you to use my hands I'm going I you to use my feet I want you to use my mind I want to be completely surrendered to you Lord I want to be in the image of God cuz that's what you thought of me before the foundation of the world that I was going to be in the image of God Amen thank you Lord 27 amen I want to go back for just a minute here in is set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own this will go with Romans 8 be conformed to the image of his son there before him lies all of mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump you will now make vessels of honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take that vessel that he's working on and thoroughly break it down so in order that he might rebuild it exactly as he desires it this is love another form of love there is not oh Lord help us like I said amen the service of so ago amen if you still got character you still not thinking like God says amen buddy I'm here to tell you Chast man's coming your way you ain't done getting beat you ain't done getting beat some of our kids that we raise sometimes it seems like you can beat your child and beat your child and they just don't get it some children get a lot more spanking than others they're more hardheaded but the objective is amen that when they're 20 when they're 30 when they're 35 amen they're a man they're a real man they're a real lady the objective of parents is to have a real man and a real lady grown mature thinking the way that you're supposed to think acting the way that they're supposed to act that's the way God is with his children amen not to be a bunch of children babies but grown-ups it's time to go into the promised land god shouldn't have to chasing you all the time hello how many of you parents still beat your children after they're about 22 well I hope you're bigger than them why cuz you're probably going to have a problem no you ain't going to beat me me enough huh comes that hour amen when my boy's got a certain age I says honey we're you know you need to we got to talk to him now just beating him ain't going to work anymore let's try talking sense into him it worked better praise the Lord you love the Lord that's right how many believes that's right cuz say listen to that's right oh my that's his that's just the way that he desires it all right now let's go look again all right they were Fighters fussing biggering murmuring complaining 1 Corinthians 10 it says Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all of our fathers were under the cloud and all path through the sea they were all baptized unto Moses and the cloud in the sea lot people claiming to be the message Believers aren't they we believe the prophet we believe the prophet what kind of character has It produced where are you live in that amen have you come to the greatest battle that was ever fought to where you're dead to your senses the Holy Spirit rules not every little feeling that you have not a little every memory that you have dominates your life but the Holy Ghost dominates your life amen all passed through the sea they were all baptized into Moses and all did eat spiritual meat and they all did drink spiritual of that spiritual drink like I said uh when I was back there I just quickly pulled up where Ephesians parallels Joshua and also why are the people so tossed about Amen brother B talking about how that people live in that justified State Sanctified State then you find those other kind how many other kind do we have hands you must not know what I'm talking about those that are go in behind the veil go all the way into the promised land we'll talk about that in a little bit but let me finish this verse amen all right the Bible said they stayed there the one that says we got it because we baptized right you bunch of Fighters god'll just let you sit right there till you die how many believe when you get off the word god leaves you sit there until the day you die whoa that's exactly right the Bible said they stayed there till them old Fighters died out that's exactly right he let them stay right there till the old Fighters died out the Bible said so those Fighters fighting over their organizational boundaries oh my don't you have no fellowship with that group the Buzzard Roost and all this that as long as you got that in your head you just sat there and amen around that M Mountain so to speak and starved death praise the Lord some new issues like the Pentecostals have come man they had all kinds of new things come up didn't they we did too Thunders and you know perusia and every oh you got to have my revelation [Music] that's right you don't scare me I a got to have your Revelation I got to have God's revelation what there was if it wasn't of God Amen if any something's not of God what'll happen with it it fizzes out it burns out when it's not of God comes to not comes to nothing when it's not of God amen Lord help us amen murmur wasn't that Israel murmur listen let me just take my time I I'm flying and I'm just going to take my time is that okay so now notice he says but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things happen these things were uh for our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be ye idolators hello in other words don't be Idol worshippers what the better B says America is a bunch of idol worshippers anything you put before God is an idol how many know Israel they constantly they W they were shouting and dancing and everything and the next minute they turned away from God next thing you knew they were complaining and murmuring and all of this out of the other well don't think it's just them sometimes people come to church have a good time and ain't no time they let something else get in front of God that becomes more important they don't keep their mind on God God don't stay first in their life let me say this you engrave this anything that you put before God anytime you put before God it's an idol you become an idol worshipper and then you wonder why you got problems God has to correct and chastise you some more because you put something else in front of God oh boy amen that's right neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 3 and 20,000 don't let us tempt chist as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the serpents neither murmur ye as some of them murmured and were destroyed of the serpent is that right M that's right M now all these HP things happen unto them for examples that and they are written for our admition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth

mountain 40 years we stayed on in our denominations 40 years fussing this way and that way did you ever think them people done that for 40 years sure sure God was with them he's been with us D been out for 40 years they raised their children God prospered them they had good crops they done a lot of good out there God blessed them and healed their sickness there wasn't the fee one among them when they come out of the Wilderness but he let them stay there till that old bunch of Fighters was gone all died out oh God's blessing me God's bless sure he might just do that but yet you're in a fate of death that's scary isn't it you could Prosper you could be healed you could have Services you could have shouting and everything else but you better make sure that heart of your is Right amen that's

new generation that's been raised up that's right there was a Joshua raised up he absolutely believe God's word every bit of the promise amen not only to take care of you and to bless your business and so forth but there's more to it than that how many believe that oh yeah God's done the same thing today I believe this day it's the same through thing through it all they got to be part of it they can be an example of what God can do when men can come together and break their denominational barriers I believe that these men here that you see now I like to just go from there I believe that these men here that you see now these younger fellas why are these groups here it's the group of Sons of the old Fighters W how many sons of the old Fighters have we got here this morning I know you don't want to answer because you don't know where I'm going oh boy let's see what he says about him but these fellow are not Fighters the new group wasn't Fighters he let all the old Fighters die off when the old Fighters died off he took their sons and raised up among them a Joshua and sent them over to the full promise how many believes every promise in the book is mine every verse every chapter every and it's time that we come to the full promise of God come into the full stature of Christ Ephesians parallels Joshua Amen brother there's only about 12 people in the book of Ephesians am mean in the Ephesian church but they were mature you didn't have to tell them to quit fussing you didn't have to tell them the baby stuff no you could tell them about how that we were in God's mind before the foundation of the world world Amen it was time to go into the land and to be placed in that Land once you get into the Holy Ghost it's time that you get placed place where you're supposed to be amen there ain't nothing as good young people there ain't nothing as good as finding the place that God wants you to be finding your place in the body of Christ like I said that's a whole subject in itself but God wants to place us when we get into the promised land but let's go back here we won't get into that just yet that's right raised up them of Joshua and sent them over to the full promise I believe that's what we are seeing today 2024 I guess it is almost Los and track we're down the road so far is that right but can we see I believe that there's a group here that we're seeing today I believe that's what this Christian businessman is who saying them but I just want to apply to us amen praise the Lord but listen he's trying to get you away from that Old Fighter's disposition amen but it's time that God is calling his church to move up I believe that he said now as you go by Mount se s e r SE I guess now that's your denominational brother Esau sitting up there good Presbyterian Methodist Baptist or whatever now don't bother him don't fuss at him just pass on by folks do you know all right I'm going to stop here for a minute do you realize how much is out there that you could fuss about oh you there's plenty out there for you to fuss about if you wanted to and now but I wanted to say a second ago you know we have a Brothers prayer group is that right where a lot of us are connected to text together ain't that right now I've been kind of watching all that I don't get into it a whole lot maybe not as much as I should I got your attention now you know there's no quicker way to get into a fuss when you got a bunch of people together doing stuff oh yeah somebody will say something somebody text somebody wrong brother Glenn say something you don't like I know that can easily happen so I've been watching wonder who's going to start fussing here bound to happen here but I can proudly say I haven't seen it yet Hallelujah Give the Lord a hand say thank Lord Jesus it takes maturity it takes spiritual maturity somebody say something you didn't really like and just say something good back or even bother you that's all right if you do that 90% of the time that person will say oh I didn't mean it that way I'm sorry I didn't you know now you could have raised up and been carnal you could have raised up and been carnal or you could have said you know I'm not going to hold anything against that person but maybe say something good and if you have that kind of maturity then you can have a prayer group I found out later do you sisters have a prayer group ain't that right y'all have a texting I was like wow that's good when it's used for the right thing brother Glenn you can text and say brother Sean's in an ambulance prak can you post this and five minutes later everybody's praying by the time you got to the hospital he can't find nothing woo Give the Lord a hand glor that's right brother John's going to the hospital everybody pay let's look they find nothing woo Glory when you're in the promised land Amen brother B said amen about uh uh oh my hold on a second when you're in the Promised Land God fights your battles how many believ that when you're in the promised land you ain't got to fight God fights your battles for you just like he did Joshua amen we as soldiers get so good at letting God fight our fights and our battles amen one after the other there's a one Victory after another Lord Brother Joe text me said things comes in threes is that right brother John brother Glenn brother Sean comes in threes I said three battles three victories wo Glory how did Grant take Richmond greatest battle ever fought just as he came to it that's how he took Richmond praise the Lord then no wonder when Grant took Richmond that that little Southern woman seen Grant coming in Inspiration struck her and said mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord he is traing out the Vantage where The Grapes of Wrath are stored he has Loos a faithful lightning of his terrible sword his troops are Marching on Amen them troops got to to be such good troops oh war war II I can't get over whenever we went over there and finally got a foothold over there amen we take one city after another after another amen and said how are you going to take it just as they came to it they take it old Hitler says I'm going to break through all of their big strong ranks I'm going to go in behind them and try to come yeah they broke through the lines but guess what all we did is circle them and get all of them they man our general said man we've got such a momentum going do you want us to go to Russia do you want us to take him over I believe we can do it woo how many believe that's the way out a Christian ought of be man we've conquered that we've conquered this amen what other devil are we going to conquer I'm telling you what our God can conquer every devil woo thank you Lord that's right how did Grant take Richmond just as he came to it that's how he took Richmond that's how God's soldiers take sin sickness just as they come to it amen that's the way they overcome their doubts their fears and things when rise one Rises they chop him down move it on out of the way oh my that's it God said cast him out he commissioned his army how many believe when you get to that land like Joshua and them am mean you become part of the army of the Living God oh yes you do you're not bickering you're not fighting no more now God is fighting your battles you find your place brother Bren buy preach is he says my hardest struggle he's trying to get people to take their place to put them in their place that's why he preached adoption quit trying to take your brother's place I was thinking when I was thinking on this subject for what it's worth I was thinking of how that we say Lord Jesus use my hands like you did David to bring down Goliath's Lord use my hands to bring great Giants down I said Lord father just let me fight the Devils as you want me to fight I ain't never going to ask him to fight big giants and this that or the other because you ask that and then you get a cancer okay there you are you want to fight him here you are be careful what you ask for ask for the grace of God to let you fight little Philistines let fight a few lions or a bear or little few Philistines you know just whatever you ordained me to do give me enough wisdom to ask for the right thing if I ask for the wrong thing God just please cast it out disregarded Lord amen oh my brother bam said you know how people wanted to be a like have the gift that he did right to have the gift and do what he does he says you have no idea what comes with it cuz if they'd realize the pressure and everything that he had to go through he says they wouldn't want it they couldn't take it why because you're not built for it when you try to take somebody else's place remember you're not built for it you'll never stand the test you won't stand pressure you got to be built for it an adoption tonight I was listening to he says you know he says he talked to those Ephesians he says I want you to realize that these gifts that were put into place pastors teach and so forth he says that was ordained before the foundation of the world that's something that's ordained of God Amen before the foundation of the world and what to set the church in order amen but I love the book of Ephesians some Apostles prophets pastors amen for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the edifying of the body of Christ amen sin fear things when Rises one Rises chop him down he said our great Chief Captain showed us how it was done how many believes we know how it is done amen Jesus did nothing but what the father showed him first that's what you and I want we want to have the mind that was in Christ Lord whatever you lead me to whatever you show me that's what I want to do we got too many imitators too many people out of their place amen listen listen to this I'm going to try to make it short how did God have set some the church through labor pains they get tremendous sometimes when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus and the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born they're positionally born into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has to set in the church some apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles how many knows there's many different things that God places in the church helps governments what did butam said people would go in the room they say they were seeking something she said don't seek nothing if God's got something for you to know just hold still he'll get your attention he'll get you to do it just commit yourself to God cuz you don't want to be a s church amen that's right you get a place how many believes each one of us has our place in this great Army in this great Promised Land we all have our place I believe you sitting there you're sitting in your place where God wants you and if you are it's just like the army man it's in when it's put in proper proper array swords Shields ain't that right I remembers how they would take these shields cover themselves up the guy behind him would bringing it up they could fling all the arrows they wanted to him unless it ricocheted or got lucky he wouldn't come in then theyd open up just enough to go in and slaughter them it was hard to penetrate that's the way it is with a church when everybody is in their place the devil can't hardly penetrate he's trying but God help us keep us protected keep the shield of Faith up and let's quench all the fiery darts of the wicked even better B said he said when everybody every thought no evil thought no cigarette smoked no short dressed women no evil thoughts everything in harmony the Holy Spirit can work everything in order that's like a mighty Army in the Promised Land Amen brother devil attacks brother Glenn he's got a lot of Warriors coming after him coming up behind him all of Heaven is coming up behind him Amen brother Sean all us any of Brother John isn't that right stick together all right praise the Lord oh my where the church is now this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner but don't do that you can never raise corn in ephraim's corner you're manasse amen you got to take your place in Christ positionally take it amen how many believe that oh it gets deep and Rich right about here how that God puts one into church to speak with tongues and it's been taught many times that we all have to speak with tongues that's wrong amen no we don't they don't all do one thing now listen next quote the land was provided and it was divided up by inspiration all the scriptures we could take to show you exactly how do you put them in place where they were supposed to be positionally how did to two and a half tribes over across the river and how their mothers cried in birth pains and how each one was placed supposed where they were supposed to be and now after you were in that don't mean you're free out of War you still have to fight for every inch of ground that you're on see Canan didn't represent the great heaven but it's it was war and troubles and killings and fightings so forth but it did represent this one thing and that it must be a perfect walk amen oh maybe we can sing that song afterwards he's here Elijah's God is with us today he's here to do and will whatever we say behold the bride of Christ in full array Amen in full array how many believe a bride of Christ in full array she walks in step with the revealed word of the hour she talks and demons Flee for her holy power amen amen how many beli that walks brother Troy our daily walk sister robin our daily walk what did Brother Braham say that's where they failed was their walk with God we aren't going to do that how many's with me we're not going to do that to fail in our walk with God must be a perfect walk he said that's where the church is failing today on that walk you don't even know your own don't you know even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it your unconfessed sin your unrighteousness brother bam says on the day of judgment if you cause a church to fail you will answer for it on the day of judgment Lord help me your pastor help my walk God help me walk not to put a stumbling block in somebody else's way and that all of our cry God help me in my walk with you daily walking close to thee as I walk let me walk close to you if there's a goal and ambition that I have by the Glen it's to have us Walking with God

believe that our Spirits are going to have to be in the right place I believe we're going to be walking pleasing to almighty God I believe we're going to be Victorious and I love this no matter what comes no matter what battle comes Church you're in the promised land and whatever comes we be victorious by the grace of God will we'll take it just as it comes because that's what we do conquer by the power of almighty God not our own power amen amen I believe it's time brother Ram says to move on up possess the promises the promises to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Christian brothers and sisters we've been on this land long enough we've been around here on this mountain we've been in this denominational Mountain too long now let me

difference tomorrow morning when we go back to our jobs and to our places our wives to see a difference in the husbands our husband see see a difference in the wife to see the reflection of Jesus Christ father and that we might have the character that you have we ask God that you would bless each one with a close walk with you never let us be responsible Lord Jesus for knocking somebody out of healing or being saved because of an attitude that we would have or unconfessed sin or walking wrongfully Lord father help us to walk the way that we're supposed to walk father March the way that Joshua marched when you told him to March right according to your word father we're in treacherous Waters and we need you now more than ever of all the examples we've had father of the Old Testament and Israel and everyone and the different places they have gone through Lord we are walking through the most treacherous Most Dangerous Ground enemy all around traps everywhere to catch our mind to Captivate Us to lure us to sway us but in the midst of it all God we pray Lord both those that are here and those listening tonight may you Center our hearts our minds on you and don't let nothing distract us from you Lord and to keep our hearts centered on you Lord take us to that final fullness promise that full promise of the word God to that place where we're supposed to be before you come
