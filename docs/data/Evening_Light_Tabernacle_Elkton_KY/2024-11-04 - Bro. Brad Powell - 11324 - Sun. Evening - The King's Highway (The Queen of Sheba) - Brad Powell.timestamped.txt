[33:06] God you love the Lord am are you
[33:11] tired well we got some honest ones I
[33:14] know you've eaten eaten lunch and the
[33:16] the Sunday afternoon services are always
[33:18] a little different and I'm torn in which
[33:20] direction to go as far as I I want to
[33:23] preach this thought and it seems like
[33:24] the Lord's leading me to want to slow
[33:26] down and teach a little bit so we just
[33:28] want to follow his leadership and do
[33:30] what he has uh do what he wants us to do
[33:32] and and you know brother Baler asked me
[33:34] he said are you ready for tonight I said
[33:36] I don't know if you're ever ready and I
[33:37] said I told joice I said I I just feel
[33:40] like I I don't have you know my thoughts
[33:43] are jumbled up and I said but one thing
[33:45] I know is if I just put him first and I
[33:47] put those thoughts before him he'll pull
[33:49] them all together and he'll he'll see
[33:51] this person needs this and this person
[33:53] needs that and man I I can't tell you
[33:55] how many times I've had people come up
[33:57] to me after service and they say I liked
[33:59] it when you said this this and this I'm
[34:01] thinking I never said
[34:04] that but God said it God knew what they
[34:08] had need of so turn with me in your
[34:10] bibles if you would and I want to
[34:12] continue on uh on our thought of the
[34:15] King's Highway and if we were to uh
[34:17] subtitle tonight it would be the Queen
[34:19] of Sheba and uh turn with me in Matthew
[34:23] chapter 12 I'm not going to keep you
[34:25] long I do know you're tired I know how
[34:28] I'm human too we're all human and and
[34:30] sometimes a preacher can get under an
[34:31] anointing and the people don't get under
[34:33] that same anointing uh you know you just
[34:35] eating lunch and and uh you know you've
[34:38] eaten lunch and you're tired and your
[34:39] body naturally tells you it's time to
[34:41] take a nap or rest or slow down so um
[34:45] we'll just we'll just go as the Lord
[34:46] leads and see where we're at so Matthew
[34:49] chapter 12 um while you're turning there
[34:52] I'm just want to uh have a quick word of
[34:54] prayer if you'd bow your heads tonight
[34:56] Lord Jesus we just come before you
[34:58] tonight with grateful Hearts thankful
[34:59] for the day you've given us and for
[35:01] those that were able to come out today
[35:03] and just to gather and to hear your word
[35:05] Lord and sit down and and just listen to
[35:08] you minister to our hearts and we thank
[35:10] you for that Lord and Lord we come once
[35:12] again uh and just ask that you would
[35:14] just speak to us tonight Lord uh ask for
[35:17] your leadership and your guidance for
[35:19] your anointing over the service tonight
[35:20] Lord for the lips of the speaker and the
[35:22] ears of the hearers Lord Jesus that we
[35:25] would get what we would have need of
[35:26] tonight Lord and we could leave here
[35:28] knowing that we have heard from you and
[35:30] we're prepared to take on the challenges
[35:32] of the week and and be uh steadfast and
[35:35] strong in the word as we leave Lord we
[35:37] just want to tell you we love you and
[35:38] appreciate you and thank you for all you
[35:40] do for us in Jesus name amen so Matthew
[35:44] chapter 12 and I know you got your spot
[35:47] there but I want to read this little
[35:48] quote to you that Prophet began to talk
[35:51] about and he's talking about the Queen
[35:52] of Sheba here the the queen of the South
[35:54] and you know uh the the Bible tells us
[35:58] and in our scripture we're going to read
[35:59] and is talked about but I want to kind
[36:01] of look at this and rehearse but he says
[36:03] as we notice this little lady pressed
[36:05] her way on he said for she was
[36:08] determined to find out she had heard
[36:12] rumors she had heard the talk she' heard
[36:14] things that was going on over here in
[36:16] Jerusalem and and with Solomon and this
[36:18] Temple and she'd heard all these good
[36:20] things and he said she was determined to
[36:22] find out and we have to find our place
[36:25] ourselves in our place in the word that
[36:26] we're determined
[36:28] we're determined to move on when others
[36:30] say you shouldn't you're determined to
[36:32] move on when your health fails you
[36:34] you're determined to move on you keep
[36:36] walking this King's
[36:39] Highway and he says God's hand to
[36:41] protect God's hand protected her till
[36:44] she finally arrived at this
[36:47] place and we're going to get into some
[36:49] details about the journey that she was
[36:51] on but when we think about that God's
[36:53] hand of protection because of her
[36:54] determination to find out what was God's
[36:57] message message for this hour what was
[36:59] God trying to reveal to the people she
[37:01] said I want that Revelation I'm
[37:03] determined and he'll protect me and get
[37:05] me there no matter how hard the journey
[37:09] that's the way we have to look at this
[37:11] he said if you're really in your heart
[37:13] trying to find out what's right God will
[37:15] lead you to that spot he'll protect you
[37:17] all along the road and bring you to that
[37:20] spot he said and see she dismounted her
[37:23] camel out in front of this Palace and
[37:26] she didn't come to stay day for just one
[37:29] night she didn't come just to play
[37:32] around the word she didn't come just to
[37:34] say oh I think I'll see what's going on
[37:36] over here she was serious she meant
[37:39] business he said she come there not for
[37:41] just one night but she come and she
[37:43] pitched her tents and she set up camp
[37:47] she wanted to know what was going on she
[37:49] didn't stay for just one night or just
[37:50] an hour or just to see but she came and
[37:53] stayed until she was convinced
[37:58] you see we we all have to stay in the
[38:02] presence of the king until we're
[38:04] convinced that we're the Bride of Jesus
[38:07] Christ well some of you got
[38:10] that we have to be convinced in this
[38:13] hour that there is a greater than
[38:15] Solomon is
[38:16] here that there's something greater
[38:20] before us in this hour that we're living
[38:22] there's something greater the Holy Ghost
[38:23] on the
[38:24] inside in this day that we're living in
[38:28] a greater than Solomon is here Matthew
[38:30] chap 12 we'll read let you have your
[38:32] seats here just a
[38:34] moment the queen of the South shall rise
[38:37] up in judgment with this generation and
[38:40] shall con condemn it for she came from
[38:44] the uttermost parts of the earth to hear
[38:46] the wisdom of Solomon and behold a
[38:50] greater than Solomon is here you can
[38:53] have your seats
[38:54] tonight Behold a greater than Solomon is
[39:00] here now we've heard this and we've read
[39:03] this scripture and and we we've looked
[39:05] at this in Matthew many of times we've
[39:07] over we've looked it over and we've
[39:09] we've heard this but I want to take a
[39:11] moment here and just kind of look and we
[39:13] lay a foundation and let's look and see
[39:15] what's really happening here in Matthew
[39:17] chap
[39:18] 12 when when when when when this when
[39:21] this quote or this this scripture is
[39:23] given given here that says the queen of
[39:25] the South shall rise up in judgment
[39:28] what's happened before that statement
[39:30] was made and we look at this and we can
[39:32] see that this St this statement is so
[39:34] important because Jesus brings this out
[39:37] right after The Parables that he's been
[39:38] speaking to these Pharisees so in
[39:41] chapter 12 of Matthew these Pharisees
[39:44] were these ultimate religious leaders
[39:46] right the scribes and the Pharisees
[39:49] they're they're the they're the
[39:50] religious of the religious among the
[39:52] Jews and before Christ as his life was
[39:55] on Earth and these guys were
[39:57] determined I will not break the law they
[40:01] were determined we will not break the
[40:03] law of God under any circumstance We
[40:06] Will We Will devise a system to where no
[40:09] matter what we'll do this this this this
[40:11] and this and we will not deviate away
[40:15] from the law law law
[40:18] law and Jesus is sitting there looking
[40:21] at this and you would think brothers and
[40:24] sisters with such a desire in their
[40:26] heart to never break the law you would
[40:30] think that they would be able to look
[40:32] and notice and recognize that
[40:34] Jesus the son of God stood right before
[40:39] them the walking talking flesh of God
[40:42] stands right before
[40:44] him and they're trying to tell him how
[40:47] to live the
[40:49] life by the
[40:51] law and they're sitting there and
[40:53] they're looking at this and you would
[40:54] think they would look and recognize hey
[40:56] this is the one we've been waiting for
[40:59] this is the one we've been longing for
[41:01] this is the one we've talked about and
[41:02] we've heard preachers preach about but
[41:04] no they didn't look at it that way they
[41:06] could only see Jesus Through the written
[41:09] law of the word and they could not see
[41:12] him through the very present ever
[41:14] knowing need providing God that he
[41:20] was you see their problem was they
[41:22] wasn't understanding the nature of
[41:25] God you know there's a lot of law LA s
[41:28] there's a lot of rules there's a lot of
[41:31] dos and don'ts and don't do and do this
[41:33] and don't do that but there's also a
[41:36] nature of
[41:37] God and they could not see the nature of
[41:40] God because you see God in their mind in
[41:44] the Pharisees mind God was primarily the
[41:48] one who makes
[41:50] demands he's a demanding God he's a God
[41:54] that tells you to do this and do that
[41:56] and that's the end of
[41:58] it but what they couldn't see uh they
[42:01] they couldn't see that those scriptures
[42:03] those laws could not be
[42:05] kept they didn't have the understanding
[42:08] of that these Pharisees thought that
[42:10] that that God looked at the
[42:14] external that everything you do that I
[42:17] can see you know it'd be easy to it' be
[42:20] easy to know that everybody's in or out
[42:22] by based on just by the way they walk
[42:24] and talk and act
[42:28] are you with me if you're looking at
[42:31] people by the law it would be easy just
[42:33] to go in there and say yep yep yep nope
[42:35] nope nope yep
[42:37] yep and that's what they did but Jesus
[42:41] when he come onto the scene it says God
[42:43] looks at the
[42:45] heart don't don't don't tighten up on
[42:49] me don't tighten up on me this is not
[42:51] this is not a free
[42:53] pass I'm not talking about a free pass
[42:55] I'm not talking about a high way where
[42:57] we can do whatever we want because God
[42:59] knows what I what what's on my heart no
[43:02] that's not the way it works because the
[43:03] scripture also tells us us as if a man
[43:05] looks upon a woman to lust after her he
[43:07] hath committed adultery already in his
[43:11] heart so the heart is more than just
[43:14] than than than just God saying oh you
[43:16] can do anything you want and get by with
[43:19] it because you love me that's not what
[43:22] he was saying and but these Pharisees
[43:24] couldn't get the difference here but I
[43:26] want you you to notice here and we look
[43:28] at 1 Samuel here it says but the Lord
[43:30] said unto Samuel look not on his
[43:34] countenance or the height of his stature
[43:37] because he I have refused him for the
[43:39] Lord seeth not as man seeth for man
[43:41] lookth on the outward appearance but the
[43:44] Lord lookth on the heart now he's
[43:46] talking here to Samuel the prophet about
[43:48] going down and trying to find a
[43:49] replacement for
[43:51] Saul and so he's talking to Saul here in
[43:53] this scripture and brother bam says I
[43:56] want you to notice the Lord God said to
[43:58] Samuel go up to the house of Jesse and
[44:00] anoint one of his sons King to take
[44:03] Saul's place he said now the people
[44:05] chose
[44:08] Saul you realize God didn't want
[44:12] kings God said I don't want you to have
[44:15] a king and they said we want a king we
[44:19] want somebody that we can put before us
[44:21] somebody that we can lift up and Samuel
[44:22] said God does not want you to have that
[44:25] because God wants you to know that he is
[44:27] the king of
[44:30] kings and so now we see here we're in a
[44:35] dilemma Israel's
[44:37] chosen was not God's
[44:41] chosen and he tells samel to go down
[44:43] here to the house and I want you to go
[44:45] down here and I want you to to look at
[44:47] them and I want you to go before
[44:50] Jesse and and pull out all of Jesse's
[44:53] kids here and I want you to go through
[44:55] them one by one by one
[44:57] one and find my anointed
[45:03] one and here
[45:05] sets
[45:06] Solomon sorry back up Saul here set Saul
[45:11] here this fine big goodlooking handsome
[45:14] man that was chosen
[45:17] by the
[45:19] people they wanted somebody that could
[45:22] had stand up with a presence somebody
[45:25] that had some Authority somebody that
[45:27] that that that that that demanded
[45:33] respect and God says you chose a
[45:37] king you want a king so I'm going to
[45:41] give you a king of my
[45:44] choosing are you with
[45:46] me and so now he goes down here and he
[45:49] sends his prophet Samuel down there and
[45:51] he comes before Jesse and his wife now
[45:53] can you imagine that conversation when
[45:55] the door when they knocked on the door
[45:56] and said
[45:58] hey I wonder who that could be I don't
[46:00] know honey why don't you go
[46:02] see we're coming we're coming open the
[46:06] door and there stands the prophet of the
[46:09] hour Samuel the prophet of the hour has
[46:13] now come to your home and knocked on
[46:15] your
[46:16] door to what do we owe this honor come
[46:21] in come in let's have a seat let's talk
[46:24] about this what what are you here for
[46:26] well I I I have to explain this to you
[46:29] but you see Saul is not God's chosen
[46:33] King and God has sent me his Prophet
[46:36] down here to find a king of his
[46:39] choosing why are you at our house well
[46:42] that King resides
[46:45] here God's anointed one resides here oh
[46:50] Lord you imagine the conversation when
[46:52] he looked at his wife said honey come
[46:54] here and listen to this
[46:58] go get our
[47:01] oldest and and the word and the prophet
[47:04] tells us that he goes and gets the
[47:05] oldest child the oldest one and brings
[47:07] them out before Samuel Samuel being the
[47:11] obedient one he is he says tell me what
[47:14] you
[47:15] got oh look at look at our look at our
[47:18] oldest son he's he's educated he he's
[47:21] smart he's handsome he's tall he he
[47:24] looks like he just would fit Under The
[47:26] King
[47:28] Crown so Samuel thinks well if that's
[47:31] what they think I'm going to give us a
[47:32] try so he goes and gets the cruise of
[47:34] oil and he begins to walk over to the
[47:36] eldest and as he begins to pour God says
[47:39] [Music]
[47:41] no they're trying to give me another one
[47:43] of what I already
[47:45] got God don't need another one of what
[47:48] he's already got he's looking for
[47:50] something special he's looking for a
[47:52] bride in this hour somebody that the
[47:54] world rejects somebody that the world
[47:56] don't accept but it's God's chosen
[47:59] person for the
[48:03] hour so here he comes one after one
[48:06] after one after
[48:07] one the oil cannot be poured God stops
[48:11] him every single time and so they're
[48:13] sitting there they scratching their head
[48:15] now man what what we going to do honey
[48:17] we're running out of
[48:19] kids matter of fact we've run out I
[48:21] think I think we've run out and and
[48:23] Samuel looks at him and says Jesse do
[48:25] you have any more
[48:30] well well you know sometimes you get
[48:33] those
[48:34] conversations
[48:35] [Music]
[48:38] well and he says bring him to
[48:41] me well let's talk about this Samuel cuz
[48:45] yeah I will not sit down until you bring
[48:48] me this
[48:50] child but he's out of he's Ruddy looking
[48:53] he's wind burnt he's red from them burnt
[48:56] by the he's been out in the fields all
[48:58] day day after day he smells like a sheep
[49:00] it's just not what we're looking
[49:04] for Samuel says I didn't ask what you
[49:08] were looking
[49:10] for you bring me what you have and God
[49:14] will make the
[49:15] decision so they go and they call go get
[49:18] David bring him in here let him see this
[49:19] little Ruddy
[49:21] thing and can you imagine him coming in
[49:24] just a slim TR trim
[49:29] short Ruddy red
[49:34] sunburnt and here's his brother standing
[49:36] over
[49:38] here
[49:40] 64
[49:42] 250 benches
[49:44] 400 that
[49:48] guy and here's
[49:52] David but he begins to look at him and D
[49:56] David comes inight of the
[49:58] Prophet the prophet of our hour said
[50:02] that Samuel run and he got the cruise of
[50:04] oil and he run over to David and he
[50:06] begins to pour out the oil on top of him
[50:08] and anoint him and anoint him and anoint
[50:10] him why was that why was he able to
[50:12] because that was God's chosen King for
[50:14] the
[50:15] hour when we go through things in our
[50:18] life and you think man how am I going to
[50:20] do it it's when God begins to pour out
[50:22] his anointing on you and you and you and
[50:24] he Pours and pours and pours why because
[50:27] you're God's chosen vessel for this
[50:35] hour back to these
[50:38] Pharisees these Pharisees were so
[50:42] angry they were so angry at Jesus and
[50:45] and and they begin to look at Jesus and
[50:48] and they couldn't believe that he was
[50:49] ignoring their Petty interpretations of
[50:52] the
[50:53] law so these Pharisees here they begin
[50:55] to to look at Jesus and and say how come
[50:58] you don't follow the laws that we
[51:01] have how come you don't follow our
[51:06] Traditions sometimes Jesus you even
[51:08] violate them now can you imagine the
[51:11] religious
[51:13] leaders coming up to the the very God
[51:18] man think about this God in
[51:22] flesh and they're saying why don't you
[51:25] follow our rules
[51:27] why don't you follow our
[51:29] laws because as we begin to look at
[51:31] these brothers and sisters a lot of
[51:33] these little rules and these laws that
[51:34] were man-made ideas they were man-made a
[51:38] spin off of the
[51:44] message you caught that didn't you I
[51:47] can't tell you the number of times you
[51:49] can count on my fingers and my toes how
[51:53] many times I've had people say me to me
[51:55] brother brandham said
[51:57] who whoa whoa
[51:58] who
[52:02] really you sure he said it that
[52:07] way did he word it it different
[52:14] maybe come on
[52:16] church if we're not careful we see this
[52:19] happen around us and people begin to
[52:20] take quotes and say the prophet said the
[52:22] prophet said the prophet said into a
[52:24] place that a real son and daughter of
[52:26] God has to step back and say wait a
[52:29] minute I don't think he said
[52:32] that I've had people do me that way more
[52:35] than once and then when I say I don't
[52:37] think he said that well he told so and
[52:42] so oh did he
[52:44] now well now we're getting to where the
[52:47] rubber Meats rode so and so may have
[52:49] embellished it just a little bit so and
[52:51] so may have Twisted it over here just a
[52:53] little bit to fit their
[52:54] household but what I need need is this
[52:58] word of God delivered by the prophet
[53:00] messenger of the hour I don't need
[53:03] anybody to spin any interpretation of
[53:05] this I don't need Pharisees and scribes
[53:07] and Sadducees saying this is the way we
[53:10] want to do it because Jesus said this no
[53:12] no no no no I want what Jesus said in
[53:15] red letter
[53:17] words if you're going to tell me the
[53:19] prophet said something you better be
[53:21] able to show it to me in his black and
[53:22] white words in a
[53:24] book if not I don't have time for
[53:27] it if you can't back it up with this or
[53:31] the message book in print with a word
[53:34] verbal word behind
[53:37] it thank you brother hear
[53:42] say these Pharisees and these
[53:45] scribes they looked at Jesus and they
[53:47] said why walk not thy disciples
[53:50] according to the traditions of the
[53:53] elders did you hear what I said
[53:54] traditions
[53:57] they eaten bread with unwashed
[54:01] hands and he answered to him and I love
[54:04] his answer now this is red letter I love
[54:07] his answer he said well Isaiah the
[54:09] prophesied of you
[54:13] Hypocrites Isaiah prophesied of you
[54:16] Hypocrites as it's written these people
[54:19] honth me with their
[54:22] lips but not
[54:25] their heart
[54:27] they honor me with their lips but not
[54:30] their hearts their heart is far from me
[54:34] these Pharisees and Sadducees they
[54:36] prayed and and robed and walked and and
[54:39] saay through the
[54:42] towns swinging their
[54:45] [Music]
[54:47] incense you've seen them you know you've
[54:49] watched
[54:52] Chosen and they walk through and they
[54:54] parade through there and look like and
[54:57] they sound like we love the Lord we love
[54:59] God we're God's people but all on the
[55:03] inside what can you do for me what can
[55:07] how can you help me how can we how can
[55:10] we grow the church how can we do this
[55:12] how can we you see what I'm saying and
[55:15] so these Pharisees they be and Jesus
[55:17] says how be it in vain do they worship
[55:19] me teaching for doctrines of
[55:21] Commandments of men for laying aside the
[55:24] Commandment of God ye hope hold to the
[55:27] traditions of men as the washing of pots
[55:29] and cups and many other such things as
[55:31] you do and he said unto them full well
[55:34] ye reject the Commandment of God these
[55:36] people would say they have the
[55:38] Commandment of God and Jesus is looking
[55:40] at them and says no no no you reject the
[55:42] Commandments of God he said that you may
[55:45] keep your own
[55:48] Traditions you see we can't be so swept
[55:51] up and so bound down by Traditions that
[55:54] we cannot move when the spirit says
[55:58] move if you're not careful if we're not
[56:02] careful we become so traditionalist such
[56:05] traditionalists that every church
[56:06] service has to be a certain
[56:11] way you know the
[56:15] routine you know the
[56:17] routine what would happen Lord Lord have
[56:20] mercy somebody have a heart attack if we
[56:22] change the order so if we change the way
[56:24] we done something
[56:30] traditions and we hold these tradition
[56:33] and when we hold on to traditions we are
[56:35] gripping and binding the moving of the
[56:37] holy spirit this wasn't in my notes so
[56:40] somebody's pulling I want to see the
[56:43] holy ghost moving in our midst not just
[56:45] a bunch of traditions not just coming
[56:47] because it's 10:00 not just coming on a
[56:49] Wednesday night but I want God moving in
[56:52] our children God moving in our marriages
[56:55] God God moving in our
[56:58] jobs God moving in our
[57:06] homes you see according to their oral
[57:09] Traditions you couldn't go to work on
[57:11] Sunday at
[57:13] all oh Jesus's men was
[57:17] hungry Jesus's men the disciples were
[57:19] hungry so they go and they begin to pull
[57:21] the ears of corn off oh my goodness
[57:26] they step back and they begin look at
[57:27] this this is a violation Jesus of the
[57:32] Sabbath Jesus said don't you know what
[57:34] they did in the temple with the
[57:36] showbread don't you know what they did
[57:38] when they were hungry and they went into
[57:40] the temple and they took the showbread
[57:41] to eat and they just been to set
[57:44] back and then Jesus entered into the
[57:47] synagogue where a man sat with a
[57:48] withered
[57:51] hand can you imagine seeing this man
[57:53] sitting there our hearts our hearts are
[57:56] always will reach out to people that are
[57:57] withered and and and distorted and
[58:01] hurt and so Jesus Walks but he looks at
[58:04] this guy he looks at this withered hand
[58:06] and these Pharisees they begin to look
[58:08] and they're eager now they're eager now
[58:11] to look and just wait to accuse Jesus of
[58:13] breaking something on the Sabbath and
[58:16] Jesus begins to look at this man and
[58:18] they ask him CU they know what he's
[58:20] fixing to do they done called on enough
[58:22] to know that this man's capable and they
[58:25] know that he's able to heal they know
[58:28] that he's able to deliver they know that
[58:30] he's able to move on the scene of any
[58:32] situation and they look at him in this
[58:33] situation knowing what he's going to do
[58:35] and they say is it lawful for you to
[58:37] heal on the
[58:41] Sabbath this is right before he's
[58:43] getting ready to pour out his anoint his
[58:44] healing anointing onto this withered
[58:48] man and they ask him that
[58:52] question and I like how he
[58:54] answers and he answers their question by
[58:57] asking them if a sheep falls into a pit
[58:59] on the
[59:00] Sabbath would not you pull it
[59:05] out if if so because I imagine they
[59:08] would have to say well let's uh let's
[59:10] see that's going to a sheep back in that
[59:12] day is going to cost me this much money
[59:14] oh yeah we're going to get him out we're
[59:16] not going to lose any sheep we're not
[59:18] going to lose a sheep because that's
[59:19] going to cost us so many daeri so many
[59:21] Franks so many of this so yeah we would
[59:24] have to get that sheep out so Jesus then
[59:26] looks at it and he says well if it's
[59:28] lawful to relieve the misery of a sheep
[59:30] on the Sabbath how much more is it
[59:32] lawful to relieve the misery of a fellow
[59:34] human being who is more valuable see it
[59:36] was about the
[59:38] money it was about their
[59:41] pocketbook and he says it's how much
[59:43] more is it to to for to heal a human
[59:46] who's more valuable than that of a sheep
[59:48] you see brothers and sisters their
[59:50] Traditions could not outsmart the wisdom
[59:53] of God in flesh
[1:00:00] so this goes on and apparently it goes
[1:00:02] on and and they come in not long after
[1:00:05] these two episodes Jesus is then moving
[1:00:06] on the scene and here we find a man who
[1:00:09] is blind and mute and possessed by a
[1:00:13] demonic
[1:00:16] spirit and these Pharisees begin to
[1:00:19] watch they begin to watch to see what's
[1:00:21] fixing to happen and Jesus comes down
[1:00:23] there and Jesus begins to cast out these
[1:00:26] Demons by the Holy Ghost spirit that's
[1:00:29] on the inside of him and they have no
[1:00:32] law that no no scripture no law no no
[1:00:36] decree anything they can put at him they
[1:00:38] say you know what you're just a
[1:00:41] devil a matter of fact you're be alub
[1:00:44] you're the chief of
[1:00:47] devils now you know he could have got an
[1:00:53] attitude he could have got a real
[1:00:55] attitude for somebody calling him
[1:00:57] that but let's think about what they
[1:01:00] did did they not blaspheme the Holy
[1:01:06] Ghost a sin that Jesus said was
[1:01:11] unpardonable they' come here now and
[1:01:13] they blasphemed the Holy Ghost and so
[1:01:16] there's lessons for that in in this for
[1:01:18] us Jesus in this clash of the Pharisees
[1:01:20] we need to be careful that we don't make
[1:01:22] our own man-made rules
[1:01:26] that we accept what Jesus is doing that
[1:01:28] we follow the scriptures that we're not
[1:01:30] trying to idealize what God is doing in
[1:01:32] our lives you know we try to make God's
[1:01:35] fit our plan that don't work we try to
[1:01:39] make God fit into our program well I'll
[1:01:41] do this God's going to allow me to do
[1:01:43] this so I can do that and this and be
[1:01:46] careful be careful because that's what
[1:01:49] the Pharisees and the Sadducees did we
[1:01:51] want to be careful that we don't become
[1:01:52] Pharisees
[1:01:56] the prophet said that when Samuel get
[1:01:58] back to to David here the prophet said
[1:02:01] that when Samuel poured the oil upon him
[1:02:05] he looked at them and he said God chose
[1:02:09] him God chose him he said see we choose
[1:02:12] by sight
[1:02:15] Pharisees they want to be they want to
[1:02:17] be looked at they want to be known they
[1:02:20] want to be seen everything's about a
[1:02:22] show any show we have is by sight
[1:02:26] and he said but they but God looked at
[1:02:30] his
[1:02:32] character he said God looked at his
[1:02:34] character it was the character that was
[1:02:36] like Jesus Christ and it began to
[1:02:39] manifest in him see he said it's not the
[1:02:42] worldly Beauty it's not that that
[1:02:44] attracts the bride it's his character
[1:02:47] the character of the church that Jesus
[1:02:49] looks
[1:02:50] for it's not in buildings it's not in
[1:02:53] programs it's not in in groups or
[1:02:55] meetings but it's on the inside it's on
[1:02:59] the
[1:03:00] heart it's not about that free P but
[1:03:02] it's about your desire for more of God
[1:03:05] your desire for God wisdom your desire
[1:03:08] for God's knowledge and for God moving
[1:03:10] in your
[1:03:11] life and he said he's looking for
[1:03:14] character he said he's looking for a day
[1:03:16] that the bride to be formed Hebrews 13
[1:03:19] and8 just exactly like it was like he
[1:03:24] was you mean he's looking for for
[1:03:25] somebody to be exactly like he
[1:03:28] was not somebody to act like a Pharisee
[1:03:31] and to be proud and to walk with
[1:03:36] incense no he's looking for somebody
[1:03:39] that walks the way he did he's looking
[1:03:42] for somebody that's got to be the same
[1:03:43] as his flesh he said the same as his
[1:03:46] bones the same as his Spirit the same
[1:03:49] everything just exactly built up and
[1:03:52] them two then become one
[1:03:56] why could Jesus not become like a
[1:03:59] Pharisee oil and water don't
[1:04:03] mix their agenda was completely
[1:04:06] different than that of Jesus as he
[1:04:08] walked on the
[1:04:09] scene we've got to be
[1:04:12] molded into the character of Jesus
[1:04:14] Christ we got to be formed into the
[1:04:16] character of Jesus Christ turn with me
[1:04:19] to First Kings chapter 4
[1:04:32] let's look at Solomon here for just a
[1:04:33] minute then we'll get into the
[1:04:36] queen I'm not going to be well I'm not
[1:04:39] even going to say
[1:04:40] it first Kings chapter 4 and verse
[1:04:46] 29 now I want you to listen to this and
[1:04:48] I'm going to slow down here because this
[1:04:50] this is this is some really you how many
[1:04:52] of us how many of us be honest and say
[1:04:53] we struggle with reading the Old
[1:04:54] Testament well this is a book in the Old
[1:04:56] Testament you shouldn't this is this is
[1:04:58] this is good reading right
[1:05:00] here and God gave Solomon wisdom and
[1:05:04] understanding exceeding much and largess
[1:05:07] of what heart even as the Sands that are
[1:05:12] on the seashore and Solomon's wisdom
[1:05:15] excelled the wisdom of all the children
[1:05:17] of the East Country and all the wisdom
[1:05:19] of Egypt for he was wiser than all men
[1:05:23] than Ethan the azerite the heon the
[1:05:27] chaal the D the sons of mayle and the
[1:05:30] fame was in the All Nations
[1:05:33] roundabout and he spake listen now
[1:05:36] listen to this he spake
[1:05:39] 3,000
[1:05:43] Proverbs did you read that he spake
[1:05:48] 3,000
[1:05:49] Proverbs I told Jo other day I said I
[1:05:52] need to write down some of these little
[1:05:53] things I say that's kind of catchy
[1:05:56] well I found out I didn't have a whole
[1:05:58] lot to write down I thought it was
[1:06:01] pretty good the other day when I said
[1:06:02] you scenario mind that people get some
[1:06:03] narrow minded they can see through a
[1:06:05] keyhole with both eyes
[1:06:09] open I thought man I got all kinds of
[1:06:12] these let me
[1:06:14] think
[1:06:15] 3,000
[1:06:17] Proverbs his songs were a, and5
[1:06:26] what's that girl's name Taylor Swift she
[1:06:30] claims to be one of the biggest
[1:06:31] songwriters she's got so many hund
[1:06:35] 1,5
[1:06:37] songs listen now he spake of trees from
[1:06:41] cedar tree that is of Lebanon and even
[1:06:43] unto the hsip that springeth out of the
[1:06:45] wall he spake of also the Beast and the
[1:06:47] foul and the creeping things and fishes
[1:06:50] and there came of all people to hear the
[1:06:52] wisdom of Solomon from all Kings of of
[1:06:55] the earth which had heard of his
[1:07:00] wisdom how did he get this
[1:07:04] wisdom have you ever thought it's in
[1:07:07] there but we don't think about it how
[1:07:09] did he obtain this such wisdom I tell
[1:07:12] you how it was is because his heart was
[1:07:14] right when when David died and he come
[1:07:17] up there and Solomon come up there and
[1:07:18] God was getting ready to anoint somebody
[1:07:20] to to to be over the people of Israel
[1:07:23] and he looked at Solomon he says listen
[1:07:26] Solomon it said God came to him I think
[1:07:28] in a
[1:07:29] dream and he began to talk to Solomon
[1:07:32] and he says ask what you
[1:07:35] will and Solomon looks and listens and
[1:07:38] he's he's talking back to God and he
[1:07:39] says
[1:07:40] listen I I I'm a
[1:07:43] nobody you see that's where a lot of
[1:07:44] people mess
[1:07:46] up they want to be
[1:07:48] somebody Solomon says I'm a nobody my
[1:07:51] daddy was great and here I am just a
[1:07:54] young man I think when he took over he
[1:07:56] was 20 years old he says I'm just a
[1:07:58] young man in the midst of your entire
[1:08:01] people I'm supposed to tell them whether
[1:08:04] it's good or bad or whether it's good or
[1:08:06] ugly I'm supposed to discern the
[1:08:08] thoughts I'm supposed to do all of
[1:08:12] this I just want to know more about how
[1:08:17] to do
[1:08:20] this I just want to know what I'm how
[1:08:23] I'm supposed to handle this that's all I
[1:08:24] ask for God you lead me you guide me you
[1:08:27] tell me how and you know what God's
[1:08:29] answer was to
[1:08:30] him because you've asked this you will
[1:08:34] be the wisest
[1:08:36] person before or after there will be
[1:08:40] nobody wiser than you you will know the
[1:08:44] answer to every question they cannot
[1:08:46] stumble you Solomon and oh by the way
[1:08:49] since you didn't ask for riches and
[1:08:51] treasures and gold I'm going to throw
[1:08:54] that in on top of it
[1:08:58] yeah you see what I'm you see how God
[1:09:00] operates it was his heart was right he
[1:09:03] was he was wanting to do what God wanted
[1:09:05] to do not what he wanted to
[1:09:08] do and so the wisdom of Solomon now is
[1:09:11] unmatched by any other when you think
[1:09:14] about Solomon you look at it and you say
[1:09:15] he's an author he's a songwriter he's a
[1:09:18] botanist he's a zoologist you name it he
[1:09:21] knows it it says there was not any
[1:09:24] subject that he was not the wisest of
[1:09:27] can you
[1:09:28] imagine can you
[1:09:30] imagine and here's this little
[1:09:34] Queen in a land far far away that's a
[1:09:38] fairy
[1:09:40] tale from a land far far away and she
[1:09:44] hears by passing and trade and people
[1:09:46] are going in and out of of Sheba and in
[1:09:48] and out of her territory where she's the
[1:09:49] queen of and she says I I I hear about
[1:09:53] this guy named Solomon
[1:09:56] they say he's
[1:09:57] incredible they say he's really
[1:09:59] something to behold I'm going to go see
[1:10:02] him so here the desire in this little
[1:10:05] queen's heart was to go and meet this
[1:10:08] meet this keing this little Queen she
[1:10:11] was willing to travel for months and
[1:10:13] months and
[1:10:16] months on the back of a
[1:10:22] camel now let's look think about a
[1:10:24] Pharisee
[1:10:27] she's willing to travel through the hot
[1:10:28] burning desert month after month after
[1:10:30] month day after day setting up tent
[1:10:32] watering camels doing whatever she has
[1:10:34] to do just to go hear the wisdom of the
[1:10:36] king the the discerner of the
[1:10:39] hour and the Pharisees wouldn't walk
[1:10:41] across the street to hear Jesus for five
[1:10:44] minutes do you see the difference do you
[1:10:47] see now why Jesus could say a greater
[1:10:51] than Solomon is here and the queen of
[1:10:53] the South will rise
[1:10:55] up against people like
[1:11:00] you this woman has a whole different
[1:11:03] level of
[1:11:04] dedication this woman has what most
[1:11:07] people you can't even imagine we can't
[1:11:09] imagine the kind of dedication she's got
[1:11:11] but she wants to grow in her knowledge
[1:11:12] she wants to get more of God she wants
[1:11:14] to know more about God and the prophet
[1:11:16] said that Solomon was a discerner of the
[1:11:18] heart and so here she goes and she comes
[1:11:21] into the presence of the king
[1:11:25] and what does the king
[1:11:27] do he didn't say now
[1:11:29] listen you should not have been on that
[1:11:32] Caravan on
[1:11:35] Sunday that's not lawful no he didn't
[1:11:38] say that the prophet said she be he
[1:11:40] began to zern the intents of her
[1:11:43] heart and he could see what was going on
[1:11:47] and and he looks out there and he's
[1:11:48] beginning to look and and he looks and
[1:11:50] he says you're a little
[1:11:51] Queen but he said the people that she
[1:11:54] was around said if you're you're going
[1:11:55] to go hang around a bunch of people like
[1:11:59] Solomon you see it's got to be that
[1:12:05] way you got to have that desire on the
[1:12:08] inside you got to have that drive that
[1:12:11] no matter what people say no matter
[1:12:12] what's going on no matter who puts you
[1:12:14] down no matter who puts you
[1:12:17] out they don't change what God is doing
[1:12:22] in here and that's the way this little
[1:12:24] Queen was she was hungering for God she
[1:12:26] was ready she was going to do it no
[1:12:28] matter what even though they said we'll
[1:12:31] excommunicate
[1:12:34] you how many people around the message
[1:12:36] of the hour has been kicked out of their
[1:12:39] homes been excommunicated not just the
[1:12:43] message of the hour just to accept
[1:12:44] Christianity in
[1:12:47] general you're out of here we don't
[1:12:50] believe
[1:12:51] that you're following a man you're
[1:12:54] following a cult you're in something
[1:12:55] that's not
[1:12:59] true I believe it's the atheist that's
[1:13:01] are the foolish
[1:13:02] ones I believe that's what the scripture
[1:13:06] says but here she was she got her
[1:13:09] Scrolls that she'd been
[1:13:11] reading she'd been reading the
[1:13:14] word and she gathered her Scrolls up and
[1:13:17] she says I'm going on a journey and she
[1:13:19] began to get into this journey she began
[1:13:21] to go down there and she began to get
[1:13:23] ready and get get all my camels ready
[1:13:25] ready get the Caravan ready get my goods
[1:13:27] get my spices get my gifts get my gold
[1:13:30] get everything ready I'm going to go see
[1:13:32] the
[1:13:33] king I said get your
[1:13:36] gifts get your
[1:13:38] goods get your worship get your
[1:13:42] praise get your Authority get your power
[1:13:46] we're going to go see a
[1:13:48] king and so she has it in her mind she's
[1:13:50] going to go see the king and she begins
[1:13:53] to head down here and the prophet said
[1:13:56] now remember there's one thing I don't
[1:13:58] want to leave out I'm going to take some
[1:14:02] money and she says I'm going to take
[1:14:04] some gifts and I'm going to take it's
[1:14:05] the truth and and he says if it's the
[1:14:07] truth I'm going to support
[1:14:09] it that's what her attitude was if this
[1:14:13] Solomon is the real deal I'm behind it
[1:14:17] I'm going to support it and if it's not
[1:14:18] I'm going to bring my money back with
[1:14:22] me and he says so all that weal there on
[1:14:25] these camels and he said I want you to
[1:14:27] remember the fleet Riders of ishmail
[1:14:30] were in the desert you know ishmael's
[1:14:33] bunch is a rough
[1:14:35] Bunch we still see it
[1:14:37] today they're
[1:14:39] merciless they have no mercy for
[1:14:42] nobody and so here they're out there in
[1:14:44] the desert and the prophet tells us that
[1:14:46] these desert robbers out there they
[1:14:48] could easily have tooken taken them and
[1:14:50] she could have fallen prey they would
[1:14:51] have killed them killed her killed her
[1:14:53] people with her her Entourage took all
[1:14:54] of her her
[1:14:58] money you know I got to think well just
[1:15:00] how much money it keeps talking about
[1:15:02] money the Bible talks about money the
[1:15:04] prophet talks about money she's got
[1:15:05] gifts she's got gold so let me put this
[1:15:08] in
[1:15:09] perspective this little Queen meant
[1:15:13] business I mean business brother Joe she
[1:15:16] was in the materials
[1:15:21] business 120 talents of go
[1:15:26] gold well how much is a talent of
[1:15:29] it no 4.5 tons of
[1:15:39] gold let me break that down to you in
[1:15:41] numbers we can somewhat understand
[1:15:45] 10,000 pounds of
[1:15:49] gold 10,000 lb of gold at 16 o a pound
[1:15:54] that's 60,000
[1:15:56] o of gold are you following me brother
[1:16:00] Joe says yeah I know where you
[1:16:03] going you talking some serious numbers
[1:16:08] here 160,000 ounces of gold on today's
[1:16:11] market value of
[1:16:13] $2700 she carried with her
[1:16:17] $432 Million worth of
[1:16:23] gold she didn't need need the king's
[1:16:27] money she just wanted an appointment
[1:16:29] with the
[1:16:30] King let me tell you we don't need the
[1:16:33] king's money he owns a cattle on a
[1:16:36] thousand we don't need the king's money
[1:16:38] we need an appointment with God we need
[1:16:40] a God that we can go before and ask him
[1:16:43] and talk to him and commune just that's
[1:16:45] all she wanted I just want to
[1:16:47] communicate with the
[1:16:49] King
[1:16:50] $432 million of gold when I say she
[1:16:53] meant business she meant
[1:16:56] business she took Church
[1:17:02] serious you know last time I preached I
[1:17:05] guess it was last Sunday right last
[1:17:08] Sunday yeah I preached and I begin to
[1:17:11] tell you some of the numbers The
[1:17:12] Staggering numbers of the decline in
[1:17:17] Christianity well the next day I had a
[1:17:19] met I met with a guy just a nominal guy
[1:17:21] and then we were he began to talk church
[1:17:23] and and and we talk and he said you know
[1:17:25] he said I heard something this week that
[1:17:26] just staggered me and I said what was it
[1:17:29] and he said this is Todd County now he
[1:17:33] what he made sure to stress that to me
[1:17:34] now this is Todd County he said this was
[1:17:36] a poll that was taken in Todd County the
[1:17:39] government done it of this
[1:17:42] County and he says full-time
[1:17:47] Church you're considered to be a
[1:17:49] full-time churchgoer if you go to church
[1:17:53] one service a
[1:17:59] month do you see the hour we're living
[1:18:02] in you're a full-time churchgoer if you
[1:18:05] go to church one service a month I
[1:18:07] thought well praise the Lord because
[1:18:09] surely everybody in Todd County goes
[1:18:10] once a
[1:18:11] month no no I was kind of
[1:18:15] hurt he said do you want to know what
[1:18:17] percentage of people are considered in
[1:18:19] Todd County to be full-time churchgoers
[1:18:21] I said 85 90% he said
[1:18:28] 16
[1:18:31] 16% are considered full-time church
[1:18:33] goers they go at least once a
[1:18:36] month she travels across the hot burning
[1:18:40] desert on the back of a camel for some
[1:18:44] say 12200 miles across the
[1:18:46] desert just to go have an appointment
[1:18:49] with the
[1:18:52] King there's something about it though
[1:18:54] that says when you're really
[1:18:57] determined and when God is revealing
[1:19:00] himself and God is revealing himself and
[1:19:02] you're determined to see Christ there is
[1:19:05] no more danger in front of you there's
[1:19:08] no more fear in front of you you don't
[1:19:10] really care what the people think you
[1:19:13] don't care what your old friends now say
[1:19:15] about you those things don't matter
[1:19:18] anymore why because you got an
[1:19:19] appointment with the King
[1:19:22] [Applause]
[1:19:30] the appointment with the king is the
[1:19:32] only thing that
[1:19:35] matters the prophet said she'd come up
[1:19:38] there in this and and she'd come there
[1:19:40] but before the king and she was sitting
[1:19:42] there
[1:19:43] and she was just waiting to hear from
[1:19:46] the King and of course he dramatizes it
[1:19:49] with the with the me meetings that was
[1:19:50] going on and he says she heard her
[1:19:52] prayer card called
[1:19:57] he says she heard her prayer call or
[1:19:59] prayer card called and she come up there
[1:20:01] and he says uh she begin to sit up there
[1:20:04] she came before Solomon and said when
[1:20:06] she come to stand before Solomon that
[1:20:09] God knew all her
[1:20:13] Secrets isn't that something that the
[1:20:15] Pharisees come with an attitude of you
[1:20:18] don't tell me what to do and she came
[1:20:21] with an attitude of God I'm an open book
[1:20:26] God if there's anything in my life
[1:20:28] that's not pleasing to you find it if
[1:20:32] anything's holding me back find it if
[1:20:35] I've done anybody wrong find it why
[1:20:39] because she wanted to be right before
[1:20:41] the king I want to be right before the
[1:20:43] king you want to be right before the
[1:20:44] king God reveal myself to
[1:20:49] you you know sometimes it's hard it's
[1:20:53] hard for us
[1:20:55] as humans as Christians as humans to
[1:20:57] open oursel up and be open even before
[1:20:59] God in our secret
[1:21:05] closet because we tend to hold on to

[1:22:57] a kingdom before
[1:22:59] us how we ought to shout how we ought to
[1:23:02] dance how we ought to sing from the
[1:23:06] rooftops she gave all of her
[1:23:11] gifts you say well I don't know what God
[1:23:13] would do with it let me tell you what he
[1:23:15] did with hers he gave the money she gave
[1:23:18] the money the 432 million and it said
[1:23:20] boats begin to come in from her area she
[1:23:23] had cargo ships begin to sail in the the
[1:23:26] great Timbers from her native land
[1:23:29] Timbers like you said you have never
[1:23:31] seen before she took he took those gifts
[1:23:35] King Solomon took those gifts and said
[1:23:37] I'm going to take your gifts that you
[1:23:39] brought me and I'm going to use them in
[1:23:40] my
[1:23:42] temple he built the
[1:23:44] porches of the temple out of the trees
[1:23:48] that she sent
[1:23:49] over that's what you call pouring out
[1:23:51] and giving back to God how should we do
[1:23:55] that how much more should we do that in
[1:23:56] this hour that we're living in God has
[1:23:58] done so much for us he's revealed the
[1:24:00] very words the message the of the hour
[1:24:03] the church ages the seals marriage and
[1:24:06] divorce serpent SE these are things that
[1:24:08] people just it blows their
[1:24:10] mind I tried to talk to a Baptist pastor
[1:24:13] friend of mine and I tried to explain
[1:24:14] serpent said he said you really believe
[1:24:18] that I said I sure
[1:24:20] do there's no other way I can see it
[1:24:24] there's no other way that I can open
[1:24:26] this book and make it all connect from
[1:24:28] this page to this page without that very
[1:24:32] Doctrine because it's the forces of Good
[1:24:35] and Evil it's the forces of right and
[1:24:38] wrong it's the serpent
[1:24:45] seed under my
[1:24:51] foot so we wi this hour
[1:24:54] as we come to a
[1:24:56] close how many would say God allow me in
[1:25:00] this hour to come before you but come to
[1:25:02] the king's high as I walk down the
[1:25:04] King's Highway through desert through
[1:25:06] heat through storms whatever it is allow
[1:25:09] me to come before your very Palace
[1:25:11] porch and open my heart up accept me for
[1:25:14] whatever I am God because my true desire
[1:25:17] is to serve you with all my heart I want
[1:25:21] God I want you to have all of my gifts I
[1:25:23] want you to have all of my
[1:25:26] talents let's stand to our
[1:25:33] feet listen to what he says
[1:25:36] here he dwells in his
[1:25:39] word and his word comes into your heart
[1:25:43] and it speaks itself out and declares he
[1:25:46] interprets his own word through you you
[1:25:50] see the Pharisees they wanted to
[1:25:52] interpret it through themselves
[1:25:56] but he interprets his word through you
[1:26:00] he's trying to find somebody he can get
[1:26:02] a hold of to show that he is still
[1:26:06] God can you imagine when she sat there
[1:26:09] before the king in Solomon's Temple and
[1:26:11] she sat there and he began to reveal
[1:26:14] himself Time After Time After Time and
[1:26:16] she would say well King what you what
[1:26:19] about this oh that's simple and he began
[1:26:21] to tell well King what about this oh
[1:26:24] that that's easy it it happens like this
[1:26:28] and he begins to reveal message after
[1:26:30] message after message he said but he he
[1:26:34] if he can get somebody that he can speak
[1:26:36] to if he can get another woman listen
[1:26:38] now another woman with a blood issue he
[1:26:40] can still speak the same thing he can do
[1:26:43] the same thing making known declaring
[1:26:45] we're in the presence of
[1:26:48] God when she stood Before the Throne of
[1:26:51] the King Solomon she was is in the very
[1:26:55] presence of the
[1:26:58] king let's bow our heads heavenly
[1:27:03] father thank you Lord Jesus for this day

[1:27:07] and for the time of Fellowship the
[1:27:10] Saints have been able to share Lord we
[1:27:12] trust that all that's been said was been
[1:27:14] pleasing to you today and this little
[1:27:16] thought that you laid on my heart as
[1:27:18] jumbled as it was Lord and I just didn't
[1:27:21] know how it was going to come together
[1:27:22] but Lord you once again have never

[1:27:36] she went through whatever the the
[1:27:38] situation whatever the desert situation
[1:27:41] was she was determined to get in the
[1:27:45] presence of the king and not just hear
[1:27:48] not just get in the presence of the king
[1:27:50] but to hear what the king would have to
[1:27:52] say to her so that she could learn and
[1:27:54] she could grow and she would she would
[1:27:56] begin to expound herself as a as as the
