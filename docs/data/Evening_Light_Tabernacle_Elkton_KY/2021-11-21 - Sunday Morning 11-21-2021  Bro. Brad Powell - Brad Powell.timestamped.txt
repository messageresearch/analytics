[10:48] commandments amen god bless you may be
[10:50] seated brother brian for adult city
[10:52] school
[11:04] my brothers and sisters
[11:15] there was uh
[11:17] one of those scriptures we were reading
[11:18] uh i thought i found it but i couldn't
[11:20] find it but
[11:22] i was uh before you if you return with
[11:25] me to uh
[11:27] first peter the second chapter
[11:33] you know i was listening to a message
[11:35] this morning and it said the name of it
[11:37] was god's provided way of healing
[11:40] i didn't write down the month and the
[11:41] day but it was in 1954
[11:45] and uh brother
[11:46] brother branham was talking about
[11:49] you know
[11:50] what we all need to do he was teaching
[11:53] them so they could have healing
[11:54] ministries but this was
[11:56] as i was listening it he said that he
[11:59] was talking about out of revelations
[12:02] now at the end times
[12:04] that uh
[12:05] it was kind of funny he talked about
[12:07] germ warfare and i was just thinking of
[12:09] our current state where we're at today
[12:11] in our own
[12:12] in our own
[12:13] people thinking
[12:16] of in genesis from basically the sixth
[12:18] to the tenth chapter
[12:20] where nimrod and and the people after
[12:23] the flood they tried to force themselves
[12:26] into a one-world government and in a one
[12:29] world society by building the tower of
[12:31] babel and the only way god was able to
[12:34] destroy it was to change all the
[12:36] languages on the face of the earth so
[12:39] people couldn't communicate together if
[12:41] you can't communicate you can't work
[12:43] together
[12:44] and i was just thinking of the day we're
[12:46] in today where you don't have to know
[12:48] someone's language to communicate with
[12:50] them all because of the internet and
[12:53] everything that's going on in the world
[12:55] today you can communicate
[12:57] thousands of miles across the globe even
[12:59] though you might not speak the name same
[13:01] language both the internet you're able
[13:03] to communicate and i was just thinking
[13:08] in that even in our own country and in
[13:10] the world
[13:11] i'm not saying that kova 19 is this
[13:14] german warfare that he was talking about
[13:16] but they're using covet 19 to bring
[13:18] everyone under submission to make
[13:21] everyone do
[13:22] what they tell you to do and it's almost
[13:25] forcing the whole world to do the same
[13:28] thing
[13:28] now i know that
[13:30] you can't i'm not a conspiracy inside
[13:33] conspiracy inside conspiracy kind of guy
[13:36] but
[13:38] you think of the last you if you look at
[13:40] the last
[13:41] 11 months or the last nine months or 10
[13:44] months and you look at the four years
[13:46] before that it's like our enemy is kind
[13:49] of angry that thing that his plan will
[13:51] slow down and he's doing everything he
[13:54] can
[13:54] to accelerate whatever that plan is and
[13:57] it just lets me know that
[13:59] as a christian
[14:00] or as a believer it's really important
[14:03] to hold your place wherever god has set
[14:05] you
[14:06] to hold your place in that position
[14:08] wherever god has put you it might be i i
[14:10] don't know what it is but whatever god
[14:13] has desired to see you do in your life
[14:15] you should be good at it that's what
[14:17] brother branham said but uh i was also
[14:20] thinking of what brother thomas said the
[14:22] other day about he was talking about
[14:24] psalms 1
[14:27] and uh well i can only speak for myself
[14:29] like i i hate to say that a lot but
[14:31] that's the truth i can only speak for
[14:32] myself
[14:34] as a young man you know serving the lord
[14:37] there were some things that uh an older
[14:38] man told me and one of those things is
[14:42] you have to apply the word of god every
[14:44] day in your life you got to go over it
[14:47] time and time again you have to take
[14:50] scripture and read and pray over it and
[14:52] try to apply it to your life and when
[14:55] god gives you the understanding or
[14:57] speaks to your heart and any portion of
[14:59] the scriptures then you you know it's
[15:01] subtle and i was thinking he was reading
[15:03] out of psalms the first chapter of
[15:05] psalms and as a young man i i memorized
[15:09] that psalm that first psalm and when i
[15:11] had difficulties with the men i was
[15:13] dealing with or people i was dealing
[15:15] with you know when you're kind of being
[15:17] pulled to go their way i would read that
[15:20] i would just meditate in that psalm and
[15:22] i would know that that's not god's
[15:23] intended way god wants you to be
[15:25] separate doesn't want you to you know
[15:27] people take separate as being that god's
[15:30] saying that god wants you to be
[15:31] different all the time that's not i
[15:33] don't take it that way but god wants you
[15:35] to separate yourself
[15:36] from the evil doesn't mean that you push
[15:38] people away but if they're doing things
[15:41] that are evil and you can't fellowship
[15:43] with that then sometimes you have to
[15:45] walk away
[15:46] and i know
[15:47] you young men and young women it's
[15:49] sometimes it's hard to walk away and
[15:52] turn the other direction because she
[15:54] it's in the nature of human beings to
[15:56] want to fellowship whether whether
[15:58] that's healthy for you or not but it
[16:01] hurts you when you have to leave people
[16:02] because they're doing things that you
[16:05] can't agree with doesn't change the fact
[16:06] that you still need to do that and one
[16:09] of the other chapters
[16:11] that are important for people is this
[16:14] second chapter here and peter it's one
[16:16] of the chapters when i was a young young
[16:19] man i memorized because in this chapter
[16:22] all the nuggets that you need as a
[16:24] christian to be successful and i am
[16:26] totally off the point this morning where
[16:28] i was gonna be this morning but i was
[16:31] also thinking
[16:32] when uh the world that we live in right
[16:34] now is trying to force you to accept a
[16:36] certain opinion and if you don't accept
[16:39] that opinion
[16:40] then
[16:41] you won't have any fellowship whether
[16:43] it's at work or whatever it is or you're
[16:45] either going to go their way or you're
[16:47] not going to go at all and as the time
[16:51] gets later and later each each day moves
[16:54] on we can see they're trying to force
[16:56] everyone into a certain direction and
[16:59] it's going to get harder for christians
[17:01] i think i i don't know when i can't say
[17:04] when but it's going to get harder each
[17:06] day for you to hold what you believe and
[17:08] to deal with people that don't have the
[17:11] same eye same
[17:12] reasoning or the same goal as you do
[17:16] uh the other thing he um
[17:20] without faith he was talking to the
[17:22] people in that day this is 1954. i
[17:25] wasn't even born yet and
[17:28] he was talking to the people that if you
[17:30] can't have simple faith for healing how
[17:32] are you going to have faith for our
[17:34] rapture or how are you going to have
[17:36] faith so you have to have simple faith
[17:38] to believe god's word to move into it
[17:41] and uh i was just thinking in the age
[17:43] that we live in it's that's the purpose
[17:45] of the age that we live in right now
[17:48] everything you you see out there in the
[17:49] world
[17:50] it's trying to take that zap that faith
[17:53] out of your heart and out of your life
[17:55] and if you if you fellowship with it too
[17:57] long
[17:58] in the wrong way you're not going to
[17:59] have any faith left but i'll i'll just
[18:01] read a few of these scriptures here
[18:04] in a second peter and it must be me but
[18:06] it seems pretty warm up here today uh
[18:09] i'll just read
[18:10] we're fire laying aside all malice and
[18:12] all guile and hypocrisies and envies and
[18:15] all evil speaking
[18:17] and as newborn babes desiring the
[18:20] sincere milk of the word that you may
[18:22] grow thereby
[18:24] you know
[18:25] it's really hard to grow as a christian
[18:27] when you have when you harbor malice
[18:29] towards your brother or you have it
[18:32] could be malice according at your
[18:34] employer
[18:35] or you there's something that your
[18:37] employer does that you you're angry with
[18:39] every day he goes on to say but so you
[18:43] have tasted that the lord is gracious to
[18:45] whom coming is unto a living stone
[18:47] disavowed indeed of men but chosen of
[18:50] god and precious
[18:51] and you also are lively stones that are
[18:53] built up a spiritual house and a holy
[18:55] priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices
[18:59] acceptable god by jesus christ
[19:02] wherefore also it is contained in the
[19:04] scriptures behold by laying zion a chief
[19:06] cornerstone elect and precious and he
[19:09] that believeth on him shall not be
[19:11] confounded
[19:13] unto you therefore which believe he is
[19:15] precious but unto them which are
[19:17] disobedient the stone which the builders
[19:19] disavow the same is made the head of the
[19:22] coroner i know i talk about this a lot
[19:25] that that stone jesus christ himself you
[19:28] know you're going to do two things
[19:30] either it's going to crush you one day
[19:32] or you're going to fall upon it and
[19:33] humble yourself before everyone here
[19:35] this morning including myself has to
[19:37] make that choice you're going to choose
[19:40] which way that stone affects you and
[19:42] your heart and in your life
[19:44] and he goes on to say the sound of
[19:46] stumbling and a rock of offense even to
[19:48] them which stumble that the word being
[19:50] disobeying we're on to they also were
[19:53] appointed
[19:54] but i'll finish with this ninth verse
[19:56] but you are a chosen generation a royal
[19:59] priesthood and a holy
[20:01] nation of peculiar people that you shall
[20:03] show forth the praises of him who hath
[20:06] called you out of darkness into his
[20:08] marvelous light you know that the only
[20:10] thing i would finish with this morning
[20:13] not taking a lot of time here
[20:16] is everyone has a
[20:18] everyone has a place where god wants you
[20:20] to be whatever that position is
[20:22] and you have to fill that position in
[20:24] your life
[20:25] and i would encourage anyone if if you
[20:28] don't know what god intends for you
[20:30] don't
[20:32] don't be satisfied which is just miranda
[20:35] ring along in life
[20:37] reach out to what god has for you
[20:40] whatever that purpose is and hold on to
[20:42] it
[20:43] steve
[21:16] woke up sort of early this morning
[21:19] which isn't really
[21:21] unusual for me
[21:26] but it
[21:28] come on my heart
[21:32] about how thankful
[21:34] i mean i know it's this time of the
[21:36] month and i'm sure that's what
[21:38] started me thinking on it but
[21:42] you know every day
[21:44] we need to get up and the first thing we
[21:46] need to do is say thank you lord
[21:51] i don't care what circumstance you're in
[21:54] in life
[21:57] if he's allowed you to
[22:00] to face that circumstance he's right
[22:03] there with you
[22:04] you're not by yourself
[22:06] so let's just
[22:08] sing some songs this morning
[22:11] that
[22:13] talks about thankfulness
[22:17] i know the world's taking this week and
[22:20] turning it into a
[22:22] holiday season of thanksgiving which is
[22:25] way better than the one that
[22:28] we just celebrated uh
[22:31] i wish they would do away with that one
[22:33] totally
[22:34] but
[22:36] a lot of people spend a lot of money and
[22:38] time into
[22:40] halloween
[22:42] but that's that's just
[22:45] i have no use for it myself but either
[22:48] way
