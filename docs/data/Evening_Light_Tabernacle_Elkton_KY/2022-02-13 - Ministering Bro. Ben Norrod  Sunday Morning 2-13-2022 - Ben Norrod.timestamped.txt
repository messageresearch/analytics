[37:24] foreign
[38:32] [Music]
[38:52] [Music]
[38:58] we realized
[39:07] foreign
[39:15] jesus christ amen
[39:39] oh
[39:47] not myself
[40:02] well
[40:04] [Music]
[40:18] he shall
[40:24] [Music]
[40:33] because of the men who bring away the
[40:35] violence
[40:47] here
[40:59] shall delight themselves
[41:07] more shallower
[41:34] this one again
[42:13] you as individuals or
[42:27] everything will be all right whether
[42:29] you're rich you're poor whether you're
[42:31] great
[42:34] god knows who you are if you would
[42:37] look for a different
[42:39] god here
[42:41] i mean
[42:43] [Music]
[43:11] read this whole chapter at the end and
[43:12] he just talks about
[43:14] the testimony of these individuals
[43:18] written in the bible having demonstrated
[43:20] god's faith
[43:22] to
[43:24] them about the 28 words in the eleventh
[43:28] chapter through faith he kept the
[43:29] passover from the sprinkling of blood
[43:32] these heat that destroyed the firstborn
[43:35] shall touch them
[43:37] and by faith they passed through the red
[43:39] sea that's dry around
[43:41] which the egyptians are saying redeemed
[43:44] were grounded
[43:45] the sheriff israel went across the dry
[43:48] land where the same egyptians went
[43:50] across
[43:51] and was destroyed and he goes
[44:34] the judges you know
[44:36] before you get the sound and there's
[44:38] only three mentions well it's actually
[44:40] for gideon derek sampson and jacob
[44:43] and i was just thinking of this song
[44:45] this morning
[44:46] i don't know if you all
[44:47] have friends
[45:00] i was just thinking of this man's
[45:02] testimony if you learn anything from his
[45:04] testimony and what went on in his life
[45:07] i was just thinking this morning be
[45:09] careful what you said
[45:10] because you might have to fulfill the
[45:12] vows
[45:16] and uh i'll try not to read the song
[45:22] um some of you know
[45:24] about islamic young obviously you're now
[45:27] pronunciation
[45:30] not they have
[45:42] grew up across catholic
[45:55] he was put out by his own brothers
[45:57] then they refreshed from his
[46:05] [Music]
[46:11] people that wouldn't be able to live in
[46:12] a
[46:19] [Music]
[46:54] you
[46:57] [Laughter]
[46:58] [Music]
[47:09] and strung me out of my father out of my
[47:11] father's house
[47:12] now why are you coming up to me now when
[47:14] you earth and destruction
[47:16] and beyonce
[47:19] therefore we turn again
[47:32] [Music]
[47:50] let me jump over here you know i was
[47:53] reading last week and
[47:54] now this is what
[47:56] jesus had to say in the seventh chapter
[47:58] of matthew
[48:00] say here
[48:01] just not beat judgment
[48:17] that is
[48:51] [Music]
[48:57] [Music]
[49:00] you read the whole chapter you see where
[49:02] he testifies
[49:04] that when the children of israel were
[49:06] going through the wilderness and became
[49:08] the follow in haman that all they asked
[49:11] to be is to be led through the land of
[49:14] their
[49:15] and those these kings of that time chose
[49:18] to fight against israel and in the
[49:20] process of doing that they lost the
[49:22] possession of their land and israel for
[49:24] control
[49:25] and jacob explains that to the people to
[49:28] among
[49:32] [Music]
[49:37] and at the end of the chapter i don't
[49:39] know if you all know but
[49:41] he made he said that he would sacrifice
[49:45] the first thing that came out of him
[49:47] when he returned from the battle of the
[49:48] lord
[49:49] gave his victory well that person was
[49:51] regarded
[49:53] and now as i read this chapter
[49:55] striking that
[49:56] you we would all think that god would
[49:58] send the prophet
[49:59] and i'm not making any assumptions here
[50:01] that god would like to send a problem to
[50:03] him i send somebody to him and say
[50:07] that he didn't have to fulfill himself
[50:09] but if you read the chapter that in the
[50:11] end of that chapter he actually had
[50:13] sacrificed his own daughter
[50:15] because he made it know that now we're
[50:17] just thinking this morning
[50:19] you got to be careful what you commit
[50:20] yourself to because god is
[50:24] whatever that is
[50:26] you know sometimes whether you're a
[50:28] businessman whether you're
[50:30] a father whatever it is people are
[50:32] listening to you and what you tell them
[50:34] you're gonna do they're expecting you to
[50:36] do it no
[50:37] in the day when you live
[50:43] well
[50:44] between christians if i tell you when
[50:45] i'm going to do something i should do
[50:47] exactly what i tell you what i'm going
[50:49] to do but then i give you a
[50:51] responsibility

[1:18:06] come hungry and i'm gonna try my best to
[1:18:09] preach everything that i got laying here
[1:18:12] today but um
[1:18:13] also don't forget that
[1:18:16] in a time like we've seen over the last
[1:18:18] couple years with this this what they
[1:18:21] call climate with covet and things of
[1:18:23] that nature the culture that we're in we
[1:18:25] don't know but what this legitimately
[1:18:27] could be the very last time we're able
[1:18:29] to meet like this the health department
[1:18:31] can step in tomorrow and say everybody
[1:18:33] go home
[1:18:34] we don't know we didn't think it could
[1:18:35] happen until a couple of years ago and
[1:18:38] talked about days like that would be
[1:18:39] coming for us that coming to church and
[1:18:41] these things would be a fond memory
[1:18:44] so do me a favor do jesus a favor do
[1:18:46] yourself a favor get as much out of this
[1:18:48] service today as you possibly can
[1:18:51] because friends if there ever was a time

[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:27] somebody say praise the lord
[1:37:31] verse 13 ephesians 1 verse 13. i want to
[1:37:34] speak to you this morning upon
[1:37:36] the bride's equipment
[1:37:38] the bride's equipment how many knows
[1:37:40] we've been equipped
[1:37:43] ephesians 1 13
[1:37:44] in whom you also trusted
[1:37:47] after that ye heard the word of truth
[1:37:50] the gospel of your salvation
[1:37:53] in whom also
[1:37:55] after everybody say after
[1:37:58] after that ye believed
[1:38:01] ye were sealed
[1:38:03] with a holy spirit of promise that holy
[1:38:06] spirit of promise ye were sealed
[1:38:09] with that holy spirit of promise when
[1:38:12] after you believed not when but after
[1:38:16] those that believe that the true
[1:38:19] understanding of receiving the holy
[1:38:20] ghost occurs when you believe something
[1:38:24] you are completely in error my friend it
[1:38:26] doesn't occur when you believe it
[1:38:28] because the fact the matter is you have
[1:38:29] some old drunks staggering out of a bar
[1:38:31] you believe in god
[1:38:32] yeah sir i believe in him but what
[1:38:34] happened after you believed
[1:38:38] ask message people you believe the
[1:38:39] message you believe the prophet you
[1:38:40] believe the lord yes sir i believe it
[1:38:42] hallelujah you've got the tapes of belt
[1:38:44] buckle and on and on but what happens
[1:38:46] after they believe
[1:38:47] the real truth of the matter is many of
[1:38:49] the ones that say they believe
[1:38:51] they may believe but god don't believe
[1:38:54] they believe
[1:38:56] because if god believed they believed he
[1:38:58] would seal them with his amen
[1:39:02] praise the lord because see it's not
[1:39:03] when you say i believe it it's when god
[1:39:05] says yeah you believe it
[1:39:07] amen
[1:39:09] hallelujah that makes the big difference
[1:39:11] between well apples and oranges to some
[1:39:14] people but it makes the difference with
[1:39:15] being a christian and not being a
[1:39:17] christian
[1:39:18] right
[1:39:19] which is the
[1:39:20] earnest
[1:39:22] earnest
[1:39:24] of our inheritance until the redemption
[1:39:26] of the purchased possession
[1:39:28] unto the praise of his glory now let's
[1:39:31] turn to second corinthians chapter 1
[1:39:33] verse 21 and 22
[1:39:36] second corinthians chapter 1
[1:39:39] verse 21 and 22
[1:39:41] we're going to go to the book of
[1:39:43] correction
[1:39:45] corinthians is the only book in the new
[1:39:48] testament
[1:39:49] that modeled correction correction for
[1:39:52] saints correction for leaders correction
[1:39:54] for the church and whole in general as a
[1:39:56] whole
[1:39:57] it's the only book in the entire bible
[1:39:59] that model correction like this you'll
[1:40:01] never actually find this anywhere you
[1:40:02] find god scolding israel throughout the
[1:40:05] new testament or the old testament part
[1:40:07] me but
[1:40:08] coming to the new testament this is the
[1:40:10] only book that you find god actually
[1:40:13] modeling what godly correction looks
[1:40:16] like especially from the man of god
[1:40:18] i like what the brother said today
[1:40:20] all of us that are his sons and
[1:40:22] daughters if we misbehave and we won't
[1:40:24] straighten up we will get a weapon
[1:40:27] and friend i'm going to let you in a
[1:40:29] little secret
[1:40:30] if you get a weapon that means jesus
[1:40:32] loves you
[1:40:34] if you don't get a weapon you better get
[1:40:36] to praying
[1:40:39] right because he corrects those he loves
[1:40:43] that should have been a big a man right
[1:40:45] there
[1:40:46] right see the modern day later seeing
[1:40:48] world they don't want correction they
[1:40:49] don't want you telling them what to do
[1:40:50] how to do it don't boss me don't tell me
[1:40:53] what to do
[1:40:54] that's why some people they can't work
[1:40:55] for another boss
[1:40:57] some people go into business for
[1:40:59] themselves because that's the only boss
[1:41:00] they can get along with and half time
[1:41:02] don't get along with him or her either
[1:41:04] praise the lord
[1:41:06] right stubborn contrary going to do
[1:41:08] their own thing can't listen can't
[1:41:10] humble
[1:41:11] i'm preaching already
[1:41:13] uh-huh right
[1:41:15] notice he which established establishes
[1:41:17] us boy that king james gets that tongue
[1:41:20] establisheth
[1:41:21] us
[1:41:22] [Laughter]
[1:41:24] with you in christ i'll get it hath
[1:41:26] anointed us is god by the lord help us
[1:41:29] and hath anointed us is god who anointed
[1:41:32] you
[1:41:34] god did it not your gift
[1:41:36] not your abilities
[1:41:37] i get out of the way i no he which
[1:41:40] anointed you is god listen to brother
[1:41:42] branham you know what i'm waiting on
[1:41:44] friends
[1:41:45] if he leaves me here i'll never be able
[1:41:47] to do nothing i'll walk away defeated
[1:41:49] i'm waiting on him to come bring me
[1:41:51] anointing right who hath also sealed us
[1:41:54] and given thee
[1:41:56] earnest now paul uses two words for this
[1:41:59] in the in the new testament we'll look
[1:42:00] at them just a moment the earnest of the
[1:42:03] spirit
[1:42:04] in our hearts let's pray together father
[1:42:06] thank you for your word today
[1:42:08] thank you for the opportunity to come
[1:42:09] into your house i pray now that you will
[1:42:12] use me lord as a voice that i might be
[1:42:14] able to speak to them only that lord
[1:42:17] which you would want them to hear and i
[1:42:19] pray you'll open every heart to receive
[1:42:21] it jesus we need you on this platform
[1:42:24] and those pews without it lord it's just
[1:42:26] learning a bunch of words and how they
[1:42:27] fit together but god make this service
[1:42:30] supernatural for all of us in some way
[1:42:33] some way quicken it to us lord make it
[1:42:35] real as we commit this to you now and
[1:42:37] the service and the remainder of it in
[1:42:39] the name of jesus christ
[1:42:41] amen and amen the saints said amen you
[1:42:43] may be seated may the lord bless you
[1:42:46] now the word that paul uses in
[1:42:49] corinthians here
[1:42:51] even though in the english it is the
[1:42:52] same word earnest
[1:42:54] in the greek there's actually two words
[1:42:56] that paul uses here for this
[1:42:59] now in ephesians looking at the 14th
[1:43:02] verse there of the first chapter he uses
[1:43:04] the greek word arab
[1:43:06] now this greek word means that
[1:43:09] it's money or
[1:43:11] a pledge or a down payment
[1:43:14] of a purchase
[1:43:15] waiting upon a full amount
[1:43:17] so the down payment or the
[1:43:20] pledge or the
[1:43:21] little portion if you put it this way
[1:43:24] like the little white button as he
[1:43:25] called the holy ghost a little white
[1:43:27] button comes into you
[1:43:28] this little portion
[1:43:30] is only god's pledge or a down payment
[1:43:33] waiting for the full portion to come
[1:43:36] now if what we got now is this good
[1:43:40] my lord jesus what waits for us when
[1:43:43] this full payment comes because serving
[1:43:45] the lord is some of the greatest
[1:43:47] experience so you'll be some of the
[1:43:48] greatest moments of your life and
[1:43:50] brother steve no matter
[1:43:52] how long you serve the lord it gets
[1:43:54] sweeter and sweeter every time you take
[1:43:56] a step
[1:43:57] troubles trials yes we'll have a few yes
[1:43:59] we'll have many but serving the lord is
[1:44:02] the greatest experience and that's just
[1:44:04] the down payment imagine what the full
[1:44:06] inheritance is going to look like now in
[1:44:08] second corinthians
[1:44:10] paul uses the english word earnest again
[1:44:12] here all right now when you translate
[1:44:15] these words into the english a lot of
[1:44:17] times they're taking that same word and
[1:44:19] trying to keep it in in continuity but
[1:44:22] actually when paul speaks this he speaks
[1:44:23] two different phrases this particular
[1:44:26] word is corrio when this word means to
[1:44:29] anoint or to consecrate or to furnish
[1:44:33] with the necessary powers for
[1:44:36] administration
[1:44:37] so in other words if god has called you
[1:44:41] to a certain administration in life ever
[1:44:43] what that is but the bible told us that
[1:44:45] in some cases he said god would give
[1:44:48] birth he said before the foundation lord
[1:44:49] he gave birth to housewives factory
[1:44:52] workers farmers painters preachers on
[1:44:54] and on
[1:44:55] if god called me to preach
[1:44:58] he equipped me with every thing i would
[1:45:02] have need of the intellect or the lack
[1:45:05] of intellect that's even an equipment in
[1:45:07] some cases if you don't believe that ask
[1:45:09] moses
[1:45:10] god couldn't use an ounce of that in him
[1:45:12] or paul
[1:45:13] god equips a man with a style the
[1:45:16] ability to even adapt his style maybe to
[1:45:19] as an evangelist you know i have a kind
[1:45:21] of a chameleon type ability if i go
[1:45:24] amongst people that are real starchy and
[1:45:26] they don't know how to hold a man and
[1:45:27] say praise the lord i know how to blend
[1:45:29] right in with that that's part of the
[1:45:30] gifting that the lord's given me if i go
[1:45:33] to a congregation that's wild and over
[1:45:35] the top i know how to get right into
[1:45:37] that anointing with them and pull that
[1:45:39] back in why not because i sat down and
[1:45:42] read a bunch of books 101 ways to be a
[1:45:44] successful evangelist in the message but
[1:45:47] because the gifting of the lord gives me
[1:45:49] a wisdom or a knowledge to know how to
[1:45:51] tap into that to make it beneficial for
[1:45:54] the people's sake not for mine but then
[1:45:56] when a man or woman has been gifted by
[1:45:59] the holy spirit for whatever
[1:46:01] administration they've been called to
[1:46:03] the devil likes to chase that
[1:46:05] understanding with well you'll never get
[1:46:08] there you'll never be what god called
[1:46:10] you to be uh you'll never be the kind of
[1:46:12] mother that you need to be never be the
[1:46:14] kind of father that you need to be you
[1:46:16] will never pass to the church like you
[1:46:18] want a pastor or on and on and on and on
[1:46:22] and on the truth of the matter is that
[1:46:24] when you receive the baptism of the holy
[1:46:27] ghost i'm only talking to those that are
[1:46:29] born again by the holy spirit if you
[1:46:31] don't have the holy ghost this morning
[1:46:32] you are missing a great portion of the
[1:46:35] calling of the lord in your life and you
[1:46:37] need it you need the baptism of the holy
[1:46:39] ghost and friend that it's more than
[1:46:41] just that time you raised your hand and
[1:46:42] felt a chill go down your back that is a
[1:46:44] complete change of your nature
[1:46:47] amen if that hasn't happened yet you
[1:46:49] need to go back and talk to the lord and
[1:46:51] find out all right lord where am i
[1:46:52] missing what area of my life am i
[1:46:55] lacking or slacking in
[1:46:57] help me to find a way to be pleasing to
[1:47:00] you that you can seal me with that holy
[1:47:03] spirit of promise
[1:47:04] now for a person then that is born again
[1:47:07] by the holy ghost
[1:47:09] everything you have need of for this
[1:47:12] life's journey
[1:47:14] is placed inside of you with that holy
[1:47:16] ghost baptism which means that if you're
[1:47:19] ever going to be a father if the lord
[1:47:21] will allow you to father children to
[1:47:23] have a child on this planet amen it
[1:47:25] gives you the ability to be the right
[1:47:28] kind of father you don't need dr spock
[1:47:31] and you don't need any of the rest of
[1:47:33] the gang to tell you how to get there
[1:47:35] your holy ghost is a reservoir of
[1:47:38] knowledge wisdom and understanding that
[1:47:41] if you would just spend time in prayer
[1:47:44] tapping into that resource the answer
[1:47:47] would show up before you even understood
[1:47:50] what happened
[1:47:51] right jesus gives us a preview of this
[1:47:54] when he tells his disciples before the
[1:47:56] holy ghost even comes you will be hated
[1:48:00] for my name's sake you'll be despised
[1:48:03] they'll reject you like they rejected me
[1:48:06] but don't take thought when you come
[1:48:08] before magistrates judges and people
[1:48:12] of influence for in that hour what the
[1:48:16] holy ghost will give you what to say
[1:48:20] brother brown was talking about it when
[1:48:21] he comes into the message marriage and
[1:48:23] divorce
[1:48:24] when he's challenged in a debate on
[1:48:26] serpency
[1:48:28] and he said he was standing there and
[1:48:29] this man was carrying on with all of his
[1:48:31] sciences and his theology and he said
[1:48:34] well he said if the original sin is here
[1:48:37] he said then the original sinner must
[1:48:39] also be pla present and brother said
[1:48:41] before i thought he said i heard him say
[1:48:44] it's the serpent
[1:48:47] now you understand that the holy spirit
[1:48:50] can actually operate above your own
[1:48:52] thinking
[1:48:54] now friends the devil does the same
[1:48:55] thing when you come up against somebody
[1:48:57] that is working beyond their own mental
[1:48:59] and physical capacity
[1:49:01] when you see somebody that is smarter in
[1:49:04] certain areas than what you know they
[1:49:06] really are you might want to take notice
[1:49:08] something demon power some supernatural
[1:49:10] thing is going on beyond their own mind
[1:49:13] when you see a child acting out arguing
[1:49:16] in a manner that is beyond their age
[1:49:19] i'm not saying people are stupid friends
[1:49:21] but let's be honest some people just
[1:49:22] don't have good common understanding
[1:49:24] about certain matters
[1:49:26] but all of a sudden you see a change in
[1:49:28] them and a child will argue you like
[1:49:30] you're standing there arguing a lawyer
[1:49:31] that child
[1:49:33] got a devil on it
[1:49:35] praise the lord
[1:49:36] if demon power will make a man or a
[1:49:39] woman to be ten times their strength
[1:49:42] their attitude can be that way their
[1:49:44] speech can be that way they can be
[1:49:46] anointed to go beyond their own capacity
[1:49:50] well if that's the way then what about
[1:49:52] the holy ghost
[1:49:54] can not the holy ghost anoint us to go
[1:49:56] beyond what our own reasoning would say
[1:50:01] you sit in a doctor's office and he
[1:50:02] tells you you're dying with cancer your
[1:50:04] mind tells you you're gone you better
[1:50:08] make preparations but a man or woman
[1:50:10] that's got the holy ghost and if they
[1:50:12] tap into the revelation of divine
[1:50:14] healing that i am not going by the way
[1:50:16] of the grave this sickness is not unto
[1:50:18] death but god is going to deliver me out
[1:50:21] of this amen don't you realize what's
[1:50:22] happening the power of god is taking
[1:50:25] them beyond what their own reasoning and
[1:50:27] mental power can comprehend
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:31] you understand something as simple as
[1:50:33] forgiveness
[1:50:35] as the brother quoted this morning don't
[1:50:37] judge
[1:50:39] don't judge unrighteously in other words
[1:50:41] don't judge by yourself
[1:50:43] we only judge ourself by the word folks
[1:50:46] i can't judge you by my standards and
[1:50:48] what i think and what i feel and you
[1:50:50] can't judge me the same because if you
[1:50:52] judge me and i judge you
[1:50:54] one of us got a toothpick one of us got
[1:50:55] a telephone bolt sticking out of our eye
[1:50:58] maybe both
[1:51:01] praise the lord
[1:51:02] amen and what we need to understand is
[1:51:04] that the power of forgiveness true
[1:51:07] forgiveness
[1:51:09] comes from the source of the born-again
[1:51:10] life
[1:51:12] if you ain't got that you could try your
[1:51:14] best to forgive them the first little
[1:51:16] thing that comes back and you have a
[1:51:17] flashback you'll go right back to the
[1:51:19] same old grudge right back to the same
[1:51:21] old feeling you've always had
[1:51:24] why because the spirit of god is the
[1:51:26] only thing that can truly bring
[1:51:28] forgiveness in a person's life
[1:51:30] that's why folks sit in church for 30
[1:51:32] years got grudges against one another
[1:51:34] hold things against one another hold it
[1:51:36] up in their face every time they turn
[1:51:37] around and got a speck of mercy and a
[1:51:39] speck of forgiveness because they ain't
[1:51:40] got even a speck of the holy ghost
[1:51:43] amen the holy ghost will make a man or
[1:51:45] woman forgive unconditionally
[1:51:49] right
[1:51:50] notice he tells us again that the
[1:51:52] inheritance
[1:51:54] is an anointing or a power for
[1:51:58] consecration now listen close
[1:52:00] you do not have the ability be included
[1:52:04] now
[1:52:04] you do not have the ability
[1:52:07] to bring yourself in total surrender of
[1:52:10] the word
[1:52:11] it's absolutely impossible
[1:52:15] you and this skin veil do not have
[1:52:19] the intestinal fortitude if you will
[1:52:23] to be submissive
[1:52:24] are you kidding me y'all i'll change
[1:52:26] your mind three times after church where
[1:52:27] you're gonna go eat
[1:52:30] you sisters probably changed your mind
[1:52:31] three times what kind of dress you were
[1:52:33] gonna wear this morning
[1:52:34] unless you just as the expression goes
[1:52:36] on the street messy hair don't care and
[1:52:38] you just threw on whatever and okay
[1:52:40] huh
[1:52:41] brothers you might have changed your
[1:52:42] tithe three or four times and you need
[1:52:44] to tell me with as fickle as we are as
[1:52:47] human beings and as as the wind blows
[1:52:49] when we change our mind
[1:52:53] that somehow i'm going to take this
[1:52:57] and 100 completely consecrate myself to
[1:52:59] jesus christ to the level
[1:53:02] that he would be pleased with me to say
[1:53:04] this is my beloved son
[1:53:07] if i could do that
[1:53:08] i wouldn't need him
[1:53:11] if i could make that happen i wouldn't
[1:53:13] need the holy ghost
[1:53:15] and god knew that
[1:53:17] when you took the breath of life he knew
[1:53:19] you did not you lacked the ability
[1:53:22] the supernatural quality to be able to
[1:53:25] make that word live in that regard and
[1:53:27] so he knew that that's why he equipped
[1:53:30] you with the holy ghost so that you
[1:53:32] could dig right down into consecration
[1:53:35] and when this thing don't want to
[1:53:36] consecrate there's something inside of
[1:53:38] you that just keeps dragging you right
[1:53:40] back down to that place at the foot of
[1:53:41] the cross consecrating yourself to jesus
[1:53:43] christ
[1:53:45] my friend i know that blow's legal let's
[1:53:47] plumb out of the building
[1:53:48] because when you get this idea that you
[1:53:50] can do something now listen i'm also not
[1:53:52] on the other side i know i i preach a
[1:53:55] lot dealing with that legalistic type
[1:53:57] thing but i'm also not on the other side
[1:53:59] where if you got the holy ghost you live
[1:54:00] any way you want
[1:54:02] i do believe a man or woman should live
[1:54:04] holy but you can't do that within
[1:54:05] yourself
[1:54:07] you can't make that live within yourself
[1:54:10] take somebody working a job 30 years
[1:54:15] you've got to be honest with yourself
[1:54:16] and know you spend all that time at work
[1:54:18] you haven't always been the most loyal
[1:54:20] employee you've just learned how to work
[1:54:21] the system
[1:54:23] well that's the way it is in day to day
[1:54:25] life what about spiritual things
[1:54:28] a lot of people have learned how to work
[1:54:30] the spiritual message system
[1:54:32] long hair check long dress check eagle
[1:54:35] belt buckle check 270 rifle check
[1:54:40] pray so hard
[1:54:42] got all of the little dots
[1:54:45] on the eyes and the crosses on the t's
[1:54:48] and every time we get to that spot
[1:54:51] in our minds if we think we can take
[1:54:54] that into the rapture
[1:54:55] [Music]
[1:54:57] that is nothing more than filthy rags in
[1:54:59] the eyes of god come on somebody preach
[1:55:00] to me
[1:55:02] there's no way in the world that you can
[1:55:03] take that in the presence of the lord
[1:55:05] because it's like the little evangelist
[1:55:06] danny greenfield he said i thought i was
[1:55:09] a good guy until i got in the presence
[1:55:11] of that light
[1:55:12] that's why we cannot stand before him
[1:55:16] nothing short be them being covered by
[1:55:18] the blood and the righteousness of jesus
[1:55:21] christ a man which only comes by the
[1:55:23] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:55:27] so this holy ghost gives you the power
[1:55:29] to consecrate
[1:55:31] you that are born again know what i'm
[1:55:32] talking about you go through these laws
[1:55:34] in your walk
[1:55:36] you're not praying like you should not
[1:55:37] read your bible like you should you're
[1:55:39] fed up with the church fed up with
[1:55:40] people fed up with christianity
[1:55:42] now i know about two of you might blink
[1:55:44] your eyes at me the rest of you will be
[1:55:45] honest to save your life but it's true
[1:55:49] i've been in this people game nearly 31
[1:55:51] years y'all ain't gonna fool me see
[1:55:52] might as well go ahead and shake your
[1:55:53] head this way
[1:55:56] uh-huh
[1:55:58] you get bored sometimes
[1:56:01] wore out
[1:56:03] sometimes you look in the mirror and
[1:56:04] some of you said somebody said this old
[1:56:05] stringy hair
[1:56:07] god i wish i could do something with it
[1:56:09] now that's exactly when humanity would
[1:56:12] overwhelm you and take you right out of
[1:56:14] your fellowship of god
[1:56:17] but what happens in those moments think
[1:56:19] about it brethren
[1:56:20] something begins to take place and it
[1:56:23] comes from a source that you can't
[1:56:24] explain
[1:56:26] you get so wore out you think i'm done
[1:56:28] you know how many times i've retired
[1:56:30] from preaching i wasn't even 20 yet
[1:56:33] i wanted to give up this whole thing
[1:56:35] many many years ago but somehow
[1:56:37] something on the inside would start
[1:56:40] compelling me i feel such a burden for
[1:56:42] people that would almost keep me up day
[1:56:44] and night
[1:56:46] i think god is there because if it
[1:56:47] wasn't there
[1:56:48] you'd walk away from your call you'd
[1:56:50] wake up walk away from your family you'd
[1:56:52] walk away from your job everything would
[1:56:54] be a bum on the street
[1:56:57] look at your prophet and standing in the
[1:56:59] gap when he stood thank god for a man
[1:57:01] that was honest enough to tell us these
[1:57:03] things too
[1:57:04] he was about ready to give up because he
[1:57:06] thought people didn't want to hear his
[1:57:08] message and the lord showed him his
[1:57:10] pathway was going to take him right into
[1:57:13] a garbage dump amen to completely remove
[1:57:16] him amen from the glory and the prestige
[1:57:19] of being a servant of god where the lord
[1:57:21] placed him at the head of the table
[1:57:24] brother m didn't put himself there he
[1:57:26] may he wanted the back seat god put him
[1:57:28] in the upper seat
[1:57:31] but because this prophet of god had that
[1:57:34] holy ghost
[1:57:36] he shows him a vision
[1:57:38] of something that will never take place
[1:57:41] just to let him know
[1:57:42] if you follow your line of thinking
[1:57:44] billy won't stay with you your wife will
[1:57:46] leave you
[1:57:48] oh brother how many times have we been
[1:57:50] there
[1:57:51] sister how many times have we been in
[1:57:53] that very place young person how many
[1:57:55] times have you been in that spot
[1:57:58] where if you'd follow your line of
[1:57:59] thinking it would get you in a lot of
[1:58:01] trouble
[1:58:02] but you this got the holy ghost
[1:58:05] something comes from another source
[1:58:08] that says don't you take it around
[1:58:10] don't you go that direction don't you
[1:58:12] think that way no more brother don't you
[1:58:13] understand why the world cannot make a
[1:58:16] sound decision anymore
[1:58:18] they're not led by the spirit of god but
[1:58:21] they that are led by the spirit of god
[1:58:23] what are they the sons of god
[1:58:28] and the daughters of god
[1:58:31] the real key to christianity is the
[1:58:33] ability to let
[1:58:36] when you see people combative
[1:58:39] angry over every little thing that moves
[1:58:41] and
[1:58:42] split hairs don't you understand what
[1:58:45] nature that is
[1:58:47] it's certainly not the holy spirit
[1:58:50] no because this equips you
[1:58:52] with the power of consecration the power
[1:58:55] of humility comes with your holy ghost
[1:58:59] that's not to say we won't be arrogant
[1:59:01] from time to time
[1:59:04] and the church said
[1:59:07] it doesn't mean you won't get too big
[1:59:08] for your britches
[1:59:11] there won't be times of course where
[1:59:14] there will be times rather that you'll
[1:59:15] be walking around thinking a certain way
[1:59:17] and be completely wrong
[1:59:22] thinking you're right thanking and
[1:59:24] believing that you've got thus saith the
[1:59:25] lord
[1:59:27] until he comes in the midnight hour in
[1:59:28] the middle of your sleep or on your job
[1:59:30] or you're riding down the road in your
[1:59:31] car and all of a sudden you hear a voice
[1:59:33] and say you are wrong
[1:59:40] do you understand what would happen
[1:59:42] if you wasn't equipped
[1:59:44] with the teacher
[1:59:47] you would never learn
[1:59:49] god's ways
[1:59:51] you'd learn your ways
[1:59:53] you learn what somebody else told you
[1:59:55] you'd learn from the influence of media
[1:59:58] but you would never learn god's ways
[2:00:00] that's why he said
[2:00:02] the teacher will be in you
[2:00:05] and with you
[2:00:06] he will lead you and guide you into all
[2:00:09] truth and what is he trying to do teach
[2:00:12] us how to have his character
[2:00:16] and i know what you think well i'm never
[2:00:18] going to get there you just are pushing
[2:00:21] a timeline
[2:00:23] that you're not in control
[2:00:24] of when you get in a hurry thinking you
[2:00:27] should be farther down the road remember
[2:00:29] this is not your timeline
[2:00:32] you don't control this is not netflix
[2:00:34] where you can fast forward and rewind 10
[2:00:36] seconds or 30 seconds as much as you
[2:00:38] want
[2:00:40] y'all gonna sit and act like you don't
[2:00:41] know what netflix is don't you that's
[2:00:43] all right that's all right
[2:00:46] i'll let you conceal your secrets
[2:00:49] this is not a thing where you can say i
[2:00:52] think i'll add
[2:00:55] to my faith you can add it all right but
[2:00:57] you better have the will of god and the
[2:00:59] mind of god before you start trying to
[2:01:01] add or take away anything
[2:01:05] because the day you take the notion i
[2:01:07] think i'll tackle brotherly kindness
[2:01:09] today that'll be the very month week
[2:01:11] year or ten years
[2:01:13] that every brother around you become the
[2:01:15] most sourpussed person on the face of
[2:01:17] the planet
[2:01:19] nobody will be lovely to you nobody will
[2:01:21] be nice to you and jesus will be sitting
[2:01:23] in heaven saying still want to add
[2:01:25] brotherly kindness
[2:01:28] are you sure you want it yet
[2:01:31] no lord let's tackle faith first and
[2:01:32] then we'll work on it
[2:01:36] but this equipment that god gives to the
[2:01:38] bride
[2:01:39] positions her in a place to where that
[2:01:42] as he instructs her
[2:01:44] and as she walks that which is inside of
[2:01:47] her will express when it's time
[2:01:52] some people have been in battles for 20
[2:01:54] years
[2:01:56] and they can't understand why can i get
[2:01:58] over this because that thing
[2:02:00] is there to unearth what's hiding inside
[2:02:03] of you and if there's a lot of it in
[2:02:05] there it'll take a lot to get it out
[2:02:08] so you may be confronted with that over
[2:02:11] and over and over again but brother joe
[2:02:13] thank god that something in christ that
[2:02:16] is not only long-suffering but patient
[2:02:19] he don't get in a hurry because it
[2:02:20] doesn't happen overnight
[2:02:23] hey man this is not a popcorn religion
[2:02:28] he waits and waits and waits the bible
[2:02:30] said the husband waits long suffering
[2:02:34] waiting for the fruit
[2:02:37] to come off the vine
[2:02:40] we get so nervous
[2:02:42] i'll never be
[2:02:44] what i want to be
[2:02:46] question one do you have the holy ghost
[2:02:48] the answer is yes then statement number
[2:02:51] one
[2:02:52] you will always be what god wants you to
[2:02:54] be
[2:02:57] to believe anything contrary to that
[2:02:59] is to not believe the bible right
[2:03:02] and how many of you and i how many of us
[2:03:04] sitting right here today how many times
[2:03:06] do we doubt our own walk with god that
[2:03:08] will ever accomplish anything later
[2:03:11] because we don't think
[2:03:13] that we can get there
[2:03:15] question number one do you have the holy
[2:03:17] ghost
[2:03:18] statement number one
[2:03:20] you'll always get there
[2:03:22] with god's help
[2:03:24] always
[2:03:27] somebody tells me sometimes young men
[2:03:29] you know when older men alike will say i
[2:03:31] feel called to preach what do i do to
[2:03:33] preach
[2:03:36] look there's no books to read we have no
[2:03:37] online courses for this
[2:03:41] the best we can do is try to watch the
[2:03:43] other brothers and figure it out
[2:03:45] but honey if that gift is in there you
[2:03:47] jump in the pulpit it'll kick in gear
[2:03:49] don't worry about it
[2:03:50] it'll show up before you know what's
[2:03:52] happening
[2:03:53] same thing with you mom i don't care
[2:03:56] what's coming on in your home i don't
[2:03:58] care what kind of problem you're
[2:03:59] confronted with
[2:04:01] if god has equipped you with the holy
[2:04:02] ghost he gives you the ability to know
[2:04:05] how to overcome that wayward son or
[2:04:06] daughter or that problem or that spirit
[2:04:09] or that issue or that or that or that
[2:04:14] and friends what you understand the
[2:04:15] bottom line of all of this is we just
[2:04:16] need to trust what god has done within
[2:04:19] us
[2:04:20] amen if we can put confidence in that to
[2:04:23] know that he has anointed us listen the
[2:04:26] anointing is not shouting alone
[2:04:29] the anointing is not feeling chills run
[2:04:31] down your spine the anointing is your
[2:04:33] equipping
[2:04:36] that is something that comes beyond your
[2:04:38] five senses you don't see it you don't
[2:04:40] taste it you don't feel it you feel the
[2:04:43] rain you feel the rain and the anointing
[2:04:45] of the holy ghost when it moves on you
[2:04:47] you feel the inspiration of god that is
[2:04:50] an attribute of the anointing
[2:04:53] joy is what we feel when we feel like
[2:04:55] clapping our hands and singing and
[2:04:57] shouting and worshiping that's joy
[2:05:00] but the anointing is not something you
[2:05:02] get by screaming at an altar or some man
[2:05:04] laying his hands on you or going to
[2:05:06] another louisiana camp or some other
[2:05:08] special meeting
[2:05:10] the anointing is something that once it
[2:05:13] enters into your soul it never leaves
[2:05:16] you or forsakes you
[2:05:19] it is there to equip you for the rest of
[2:05:22] your life
[2:05:24] you know what's beautiful about
[2:05:25] receiving the anointing the true
[2:05:26] anointing of the holy ghost you only got
[2:05:28] to do it one time
[2:05:32] you know
[2:05:33] years ago when we were younger
[2:05:36] the early days of this message
[2:05:37] especially folks who come out of
[2:05:38] pentecost apostolic and charismatic type
[2:05:41] movements like that you thought to be
[2:05:42] anointed you had to go to your prayer
[2:05:44] closet and pray until you
[2:05:46] spoke you have to go to church and shout
[2:05:49] real loud to get the anointing
[2:05:51] what we're doing is out there and i call
[2:05:53] it indian dancing
[2:05:56] you know they used to do the rain dance
[2:06:02] lord
[2:06:03] praise the lord
[2:06:04] i'm in about 12 different tater patches
[2:06:06] right now
[2:06:08] right
[2:06:09] they get out and they would dance trying
[2:06:11] to call the rain down not realizing that
[2:06:13] without rain or with rain they were
[2:06:15] still indians
[2:06:18] with or without a feeling
[2:06:21] i am an anointed son of god
[2:06:25] because i've got the holy ghost
[2:06:30] how contrary that is from what we've
[2:06:31] been instructed to believe though
[2:06:35] that the anointing is something that
[2:06:36] comes because an angel of the lord draws
[2:06:38] thee
[2:06:39] or because a man becomes gifted
[2:06:42] years ago we used to judge how anointed
[2:06:44] a man was by how wet his tie was when he
[2:06:46] got done preaching
[2:06:49] and the sweat was dripped drip drip
[2:06:50] dripping off the end of his time man he
[2:06:52] was anointed tonight
[2:06:54] uh what did he say what was his message
[2:06:56] did he have any substance to it no i
[2:06:58] didn't understand the thing he said but
[2:06:59] glory to god he shouted all over the
[2:07:01] place
[2:07:05] that it's not the anointing that's the
[2:07:06] rain and it falls on the just and then
[2:07:08] just come on people don't just look at
[2:07:09] me
[2:07:11] get in with both feet
[2:07:13] because this is a misconception of
[2:07:15] pentecost pentecost
[2:07:17] modern day pentecost is not what we were
[2:07:20] restored to
[2:07:22] no sir we were not restored back to the
[2:07:25] faith of those modern day pentecostals
[2:07:29] they had gifts they had a portion of
[2:07:31] revelation but we were restored plum
[2:07:34] back to the original
[2:07:39] how hard is it for us to believe this
[2:07:41] though
[2:07:42] when we read the bible we see these
[2:07:44] anointed servants of god we call we see
[2:07:46] these anointed saints of god and in our
[2:07:49] mind the anointings when they were
[2:07:50] opening blinded eyes and casting out
[2:07:52] devils no
[2:07:55] that was an attribute of the true
[2:07:57] anointing
[2:08:02] and young people when you go to special
[2:08:04] meetings and and there's a call for the
[2:08:06] altar
[2:08:07] please listen to brother ben and
[2:08:09] understand you don't go to that altar to
[2:08:10] receive the anointing because of how
[2:08:13] you'll feel
[2:08:15] if you go pray in an altar somebody lays
[2:08:17] their hands on you you are inviting
[2:08:19] christ
[2:08:21] to come take residency right here
[2:08:24] you're asking him to make a permanent
[2:08:27] move
[2:08:28] from his attribute in heaven into your
[2:08:31] house
[2:08:32] glory to god
[2:08:35] and brother you will never have to put a
[2:08:36] for sale sign up on that again
[2:08:39] you'll never need another realtor
[2:08:41] that's what i am this morning a holy
[2:08:43] ghost free at a time i'm trying to sell
[2:08:45] you a house that jesus can move into
[2:08:50] and once you get that brother john once
[2:08:52] we receive the holy ghost it's not a
[2:08:54] feeling
[2:08:54] how many christians here can put your
[2:08:56] hand up testify how many times have you
[2:08:58] went through this life not feeling god
[2:09:01] can you say at least once
[2:09:03] twice
[2:09:04] 12 times
[2:09:06] 50 100
[2:09:08] more
[2:09:10] well did that mean you lost your
[2:09:11] anointing when you quit feeling him
[2:09:13] what was it that drove you to the next
[2:09:15] feeling
[2:09:18] what was it inside of your heart that
[2:09:20] day you wanted to quit and commit
[2:09:22] suicide and something runs up inside of
[2:09:25] you and said don't you harm my
[2:09:27] tabernacle
[2:09:29] it was the anointing
[2:09:32] this is why the prophet of god taught us
[2:09:34] that if you genuinely got the holy ghost
[2:09:36] you'll be able to say amen to every word
[2:09:38] why because it's like a magnet the
[2:09:40] anointing will draw you to the truth
[2:09:46] i don't care how obscure or how far away
[2:09:49] that truth is if the holy ghost is on
[2:09:51] the inside of you it will draw you like
[2:09:54] a magnet to metal amen right to the
[2:09:56] anointing right to the truth of the word
[2:09:58] the anointing will do that
[2:10:04] sister bible through the years if we've
[2:10:05] seen ministry through the years and you
[2:10:07] know you've seen it sis
[2:10:08] we get this misconception that the
[2:10:10] anointing is how loud somebody scream
[2:10:12] down here
[2:10:14] and maybe whether tom or whether brad or
[2:10:16] some of these ministry will lay hands on
[2:10:17] people and they will pray and say god
[2:10:21] help this man or help this woman
[2:10:24] and i've heard it a thousand times in my
[2:10:25] own ministry i just didn't feel anything
[2:10:29] what they fail to understand
[2:10:32] is that when a servant of the lord lays
[2:10:33] his hands on you it doesn't have to be a
[2:10:35] preacher now
[2:10:36] do you realize nothing is really
[2:10:38] happening
[2:10:39] just because i place my hands on you
[2:10:42] what i am doing according to the message
[2:10:43] recording the bible is i am sanctioning
[2:10:46] before god
[2:10:48] that you say you're a believer and that
[2:10:49] you believe his word and i am
[2:10:51] sanctioning
[2:10:53] that you believe what's truth
[2:10:56] when jesus said in mark 16 go to the
[2:10:58] world preach the gospel lay hands on the
[2:11:00] sick and they shall recover show me one
[2:11:02] time you said you'll feel it
[2:11:08] y'all might as well hang with me because
[2:11:10] this is where the lord took me here we
[2:11:11] are
[2:11:14] away with feelings and experiences as
[2:11:16] your plumb line
[2:11:19] we don't stand
[2:11:21] and find a foundation based upon what do
[2:11:24] i feel
[2:11:26] because if i was to go by the way i feel
[2:11:30] y'all have to be praying for me
[2:11:33] because that plenty of folks i'd rip a
[2:11:34] goozle out of them
[2:11:35] i'd shake them to their false he fell
[2:11:37] out of their head
[2:11:40] praise the lord including myself
[2:11:43] huh
[2:11:44] we don't base things upon well i feel
[2:11:47] like a christian what does that feel
[2:11:48] like exactly
[2:11:50] what's feeling like a believer mean
[2:11:53] we don't go by sight we go by faith the
[2:11:55] things we can't see those are the things
[2:11:57] that paul told us were the most real
[2:12:02] and yet
[2:12:04] the anointing when it moves in it's
[2:12:06] there to furnish
[2:12:08] and equip you with everything listen to
[2:12:11] this and show us the father i've read
[2:12:12] this quote so many times in my lifetime
[2:12:14] i don't even have to look at this i've
[2:12:15] read this one over and over and over one
[2:12:17] of the first things the lord showed me
[2:12:18] when i first got saved got the holy
[2:12:20] ghost was this quote right here shows
[2:12:21] the father 19 55 he said everything you
[2:12:24] have need of for this life's journey is
[2:12:26] in you when you receive the holy ghost
[2:12:28] divine healing even the rapture
[2:12:34] is in you when you become born again
[2:12:39] well i'll never make the rapture
[2:12:41] question one
[2:12:42] are you born again
[2:12:44] statement number one you will always do
[2:12:47] what god has called you to do if you've
[2:12:49] been called to make the rapture you
[2:12:50] utilize in your seed
[2:12:52] in the seed germ that christ placed
[2:12:54] inside of you is one of two things it
[2:12:57] either has the power to bring you to
[2:12:59] rapture or the power to bring you to
[2:13:01] resurrection
[2:13:03] there are some that are equipped right
[2:13:05] now with the ability to take the rapture
[2:13:08] and when that hour arrives they'll speak
[2:13:10] to their own bodies and tell it to
[2:13:11] change
[2:13:14] oh you say that's ridiculous no it's not
[2:13:16] that's what i do every day of my life as
[2:13:18] a believer
[2:13:19] when i wake up every morning and i don't
[2:13:21] want to pray i tell my body shut up
[2:13:24] we're going to talk to the lord a lot
[2:13:33] oh but you say i can't oh oh careful
[2:13:37] as he said the holy ghost come to take
[2:13:38] all those cants away from you
[2:13:42] i can do all things through christ which
[2:13:44] strengthens me
[2:13:47] oh but i don't know how to ah now you're
[2:13:49] getting somewhere
[2:13:51] you don't
[2:13:52] but you're equipped with the ability
[2:13:56] to let that expression come from your
[2:13:58] heart and
[2:13:59] what does he do he draws this body
[2:14:02] subject
[2:14:03] to that
[2:14:06] how do i get there well first of all we
[2:14:08] got to stop taking the reins
[2:14:11] and driving the bus
[2:14:14] we need to learn how to surrender a
[2:14:15] little bit and say lord i don't know the
[2:14:17] answer
[2:14:17] i don't know how to face this i don't
[2:14:20] know how to overcome this but if you'll
[2:14:22] take over
[2:14:24] if you'll teach me the way
[2:14:28] praise god
[2:14:30] oh i got 13 pages here and i haven't
[2:14:32] even got to pass page one yet
[2:14:37] it's one that
[2:14:39] preaching to y'all they're you
[2:14:42] hungry little eagles gotta be ashamed of
[2:14:44] yourself being so hungry
[2:14:48] now notice the same word is used
[2:14:52] when jesus walks into the temple luke
[2:14:54] chapter 4 verse 18.
[2:14:56] you got it with me
[2:14:58] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[2:15:01] because he hath carrillo
[2:15:05] furnished me consecrated me anointed
[2:15:09] me
[2:15:11] to preach the gospel to the poor
[2:15:13] you know that always surprises me most
[2:15:15] preachers want to preach to the rich
[2:15:18] that's where the big offerings come from
[2:15:20] if i've been called to preach i've been
[2:15:22] called to preach those ain't got no
[2:15:23] money
[2:15:25] and i've done it time and time and time
[2:15:27] again never fails 19 years full-time
[2:15:29] ministry around the world i go to a
[2:15:31] church they might give me 50 bucks and
[2:15:33] that's the best they can do cost me 250
[2:15:36] to get there
[2:15:38] but that's the best they do following
[2:15:40] that next service somebody will feel led
[2:15:42] to give a hundred led to give 200. led
[2:15:43] to give this led to give that as long as
[2:15:45] i pay my tithes and offerings i've never
[2:15:48] not one time in nearly 20 years i've
[2:15:51] never seen him fail when the bills are
[2:15:53] due and it's time to put food on the
[2:15:55] table he knows how to take care of you
[2:15:59] brother that's not just for preachers
[2:16:01] that's for every son and daughter of god
[2:16:03] he said try me in this area pay your
[2:16:06] tithes and your offering and see if i
[2:16:09] won't open the windows of heaven and
[2:16:11] pour you out a blessing you can't even
[2:16:13] contain it
[2:16:16] brother i'm going to tell you something
[2:16:17] if folks would learn that simple
[2:16:19] principle right there they'd have a
[2:16:20] whole lot more joy their prayer lives
[2:16:22] would be better their marriages would be
[2:16:24] better come on
[2:16:27] when you don't do it you live under a
[2:16:29] curse
[2:16:31] and god absolutely will not bless you in
[2:16:33] the way you need to be blessed until you
[2:16:35] get back to that sound principle again
[2:16:38] i love preaching this week he's an
[2:16:39] evangelist i don't receive tithes so i
[2:16:40] can say it all
[2:16:44] right to the holy spirit equips you
[2:16:47] with the ability to do the thing you've
[2:16:50] got to do
[2:16:52] again if i'm a preacher
[2:16:54] there is a congregation somewhere
[2:16:57] that god called me to preach to
[2:17:00] i'm an evangelist there is a there is an
[2:17:02] audience
[2:17:04] for me to evangelize to
[2:17:06] this is what jesus told his own
[2:17:07] disciples when you go
[2:17:10] don't take a bunch of things like a
[2:17:11] person a script don't don't pack up your
[2:17:13] suitcases like you're going to florida
[2:17:18] i imagine it was quite the sight
[2:17:20] brother tom and them guys coming out
[2:17:22] probably had all their fishing gear and
[2:17:23] had everything loaded up
[2:17:27] you know when they go down and fish i
[2:17:28] mean
[2:17:30] you when you take vacations going to
[2:17:32] disneyland or dollywollywood
[2:17:35] you might have all kinds of things
[2:17:37] you'll have extra extra extra just in
[2:17:40] case
[2:17:43] but jesus told his disciples
[2:17:46] don't take nothing but the shirt on your
[2:17:48] back
[2:17:50] why
[2:17:51] because he's anointed
[2:17:53] those men remember they shared in his
[2:17:56] anointing
[2:17:57] they share in the christ anointing the
[2:17:59] anointing of his ministry they shared in
[2:18:02] it and judas even shared in anointing as
[2:18:04] well and that anointing had equipped
[2:18:06] them to
[2:18:08] go to places and preach to those folks
[2:18:10] that had no money probably didn't have a
[2:18:12] roof over their head even jesus himself
[2:18:14] said the birds have a nest and foxes
[2:18:17] have hole i ain't got nowhere to lay my
[2:18:20] head but he wasn't complaining
[2:18:23] because he turns right around and says
[2:18:25] that my lord feeds the spare hosts he
[2:18:27] knows how to dress the fields with grass
[2:18:30] glory to god clothe them with grass he
[2:18:32] said in other words jesus is saying that
[2:18:35] you are anointed a man with the ability
[2:18:38] to go into nothing and god can bring
[2:18:41] something out of nothing
[2:18:44] don't forget we believe in a christian
[2:18:46] big bang theory there was nothing god
[2:18:50] spoke and banged there was a bunch of
[2:18:52] somethings everywhere
[2:18:56] he knows how to hone in
[2:18:59] on your need
[2:19:01] and it's a two-way street you see
[2:19:03] because he's got the answer
[2:19:05] he placed that answer inside of you
[2:19:11] i like the the the message this morning
[2:19:13] on the vows
[2:19:15] and being faithful to god vowing to god
[2:19:17] i've actually been teaching on this
[2:19:18] quite a bit i just did a a zoom meeting
[2:19:20] with about about 50 pastors
[2:19:23] down south america and central america
[2:19:25] and mexico
[2:19:26] and the question was about a woman
[2:19:28] vowing herself in engagement and so
[2:19:30] forth like that
[2:19:32] and i took it from this avenue that when
[2:19:34] the bible spoke about a vow
[2:19:36] your soul was actually bound to that vow
[2:19:40] and god would hold you accountable for
[2:19:42] vowing yourself to the lord but watch
[2:19:44] james
[2:19:45] when it comes to the new testament
[2:19:47] it's not like hey i'll meet you for
[2:19:49] coffee on friday
[2:19:51] and we'll go down and have a starbucks
[2:19:56] james said don't go to a city and say
[2:19:58] i'll do this or that
[2:20:00] but say if it's the lord's will
[2:20:03] that's different than a vow that binds
[2:20:05] your soul before god
[2:20:08] and i like what the brother said if you
[2:20:09] are going to tell the lord that you are
[2:20:12] going to serve him that's different than
[2:20:15] saying i'll see you in church on sunday
[2:20:17] you say in that case if the lord be
[2:20:18] willing
[2:20:20] my ox might be in the ditch i might not
[2:20:21] be able to make it come on now
[2:20:24] but when you vow to god i'm gonna
[2:20:26] consecrate my life to you he will hold
[2:20:28] you accountable for the thing you
[2:20:30] promised him
[2:20:33] that's a whole lot different than i'll
[2:20:34] meet you on friday for a starbeast
[2:20:38] huh
[2:20:39] on triple
[2:20:40] stars points thursday or whatever it is
[2:20:45] i usually don't know i just hold my
[2:20:47] phone up and say hit it
[2:20:50] oh you have a free donut thank you i'll
[2:20:52] take another
[2:20:56] but the anointing is your is your vow
[2:20:59] it's your body that your contract
[2:21:01] between you and god you understand
[2:21:03] it's not when you have received the holy
[2:21:05] ghost or accept the holy ghost is when
[2:21:07] the holy ghost accepts you
[2:21:11] and because of that reality
[2:21:15] if the holy spirit says amen to your
[2:21:17] life
[2:21:19] and gives you the holy ghost he is
[2:21:21] making a vow a binding contract with you
[2:21:24] you are my son my daughter
[2:21:27] and one thing i love about him he never
[2:21:29] breaks his contracts
[2:21:33] i can't ever say that i've been faithful
[2:21:34] there
[2:21:36] at the risk of sounding like i've got
[2:21:37] only a speck in my eye when i've got a
[2:21:39] telephone pole i have not always been
[2:21:41] faithful to that idea
[2:21:43] there have been plenty of times that
[2:21:45] i've told him how sorry i am for getting
[2:21:47] weak discouraged disgruntled frustrated
[2:21:51] feeling like quitting feeling like
[2:21:52] giving it there have been a thousand
[2:21:53] times that i've told him lord jesus i
[2:21:56] cannot take another moment
[2:21:57] [Music]
[2:21:59] hey
[2:22:00] god
[2:22:02] that little something begins to wash
[2:22:03] over a son
[2:22:05] and over a daughter that says listen
[2:22:07] don't don't worry i'll drive for a while
[2:22:11] it's the most refreshing thing in the
[2:22:12] world when sam and i've been on the road
[2:22:14] sometimes eight nine
[2:22:15] a thousand miles
[2:22:18] and i've gone four or five hundred and
[2:22:19] we're trying to press to get back home
[2:22:21] some kind of a matter of the family or
[2:22:22] some kind of thing
[2:22:23] and i get this but i can't honestly stay
[2:22:25] awake i'm biting my cheek and rubbing my
[2:22:27] eyes i got the lights on and music
[2:22:29] playing and everything else i can do to
[2:22:30] stay awake
[2:22:31] and she leans over and says hey
[2:22:33] i'll drive for a
[2:22:34] bit now mind you i go to pray a lot
[2:22:37] harder when she does but
[2:22:42] we keep each other prayed up believe me
[2:22:45] between my lead foot and hurricane
[2:22:47] sitting over the steering wheel we were
[2:22:48] a match made in heaven
[2:22:52] happy valentine's day baby
[2:22:57] what a comfort it is for somebody just
[2:22:59] to take the wheel
[2:23:01] and i can rest brother sister we need
[2:23:04] those moments
[2:23:07] in our life
[2:23:09] where we just step back and say all
[2:23:10] right lord
[2:23:11] your turn
[2:23:13] he called his fellow laborers with
[2:23:14] christ which means that he doesn't
[2:23:16] always drive the charge
[2:23:18] there are times we've got to do the
[2:23:20] thing that we've got to do
[2:23:22] and we've got to do it the way he wants
[2:23:23] us to do it build upon the foundation we
[2:23:26] got to work and labor to be the right
[2:23:28] kind of christian but there are moments
[2:23:29] when you get so weak
[2:23:32] to where you can't do anything else
[2:23:35] that's when he steps in and says it's
[2:23:37] okay
[2:23:38] i'll drive
[2:23:41] where he's gone
[2:23:45] i looked up
[2:23:47] it's 20 after 12.
[2:23:49] you can't believe it i can't believe it
[2:23:50] but i've got to find a place to quit
[2:23:52] we're just getting started
[2:23:56] acts chapter 10 verse 38
[2:23:58] they refer to jesus how god anointed
[2:24:01] jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost
[2:24:03] and power
[2:24:04] who went about doing good and healing
[2:24:06] all that were oppressed to the devil for
[2:24:08] god was with him
[2:24:10] notice in john 2
[2:24:11] 19 20 21 jesus answered said destroy
[2:24:14] this temple in three days i'll raise it
[2:24:15] up
[2:24:20] what a bold statement
[2:24:22] y'all won't kill me
[2:24:23] fine
[2:24:25] do it
[2:24:27] within three days i'll take this body
[2:24:29] that you kill
[2:24:31] and i'll raise it up again
[2:24:33] why could this man
[2:24:36] this
[2:24:37] this creation of god
[2:24:40] why could he speak with such authority
[2:24:42] because he knew
[2:24:44] i'm anointed
[2:24:47] and here's the beauty of the anointing
[2:24:49] the anointed the anointing carried him
[2:24:54] all the way into the garden of
[2:24:55] gethsemane
[2:24:58] and when the anointing of the holy
[2:25:00] spirit when the actual anointing itself
[2:25:03] lifted off jesus listen
[2:25:05] it didn't take the character that the
[2:25:07] anointing had developed
[2:25:10] because when peter cuts off malcus's ear
[2:25:14] jesus with no anointing on him reaches
[2:25:16] down and picks the ear up puts it back
[2:25:18] on his head
[2:25:19] without even a scar
[2:25:21] i like what brother carol used to say
[2:25:23] there he said because if there had been
[2:25:24] a scar that could have made an
[2:25:25] accusation against peter and it could
[2:25:27] have put him in jail
[2:25:29] but because the ear went back on without
[2:25:30] a scar as though it was never off in the
[2:25:32] first place
[2:25:35] there was true justification involved
[2:25:38] that's what god did for you and i
[2:25:42] there could be no accusers against the
[2:25:44] true bride if you're born again
[2:25:46] no one can stand and say you're a sinner
[2:25:50] not
[2:25:51] even christ
[2:25:57] now you may get frustrated and say ah
[2:26:01] but not him
[2:26:03] once he makes this contract with you
[2:26:06] he knows what you are he knows where you
[2:26:08] come from he knows
[2:26:09] where you're going he knows all about
[2:26:11] you your secret parts the end parts the
[2:26:14] out parts the bad parts the good parts
[2:26:16] and he doesn't change his contract
[2:26:20] because you have down times
[2:26:23] no no see that's why he sent the
[2:26:26] anointing into your soul
[2:26:29] because if this was easy everybody would
[2:26:31] do it
[2:26:34] i shouldn't have told you the time now
[2:26:36] some of y'all are going okay we're done
[2:26:37] now let's go ahead and get here
[2:26:41] few more minutes we'll quit
[2:26:43] notice notice these words i love this
[2:26:46] when
[2:26:47] peter is speaking about the lord jesus
[2:26:49] in acts 4 and 27 now this is going all
[2:26:53] the way down
[2:26:54] from the time that
[2:26:56] jesus was anointed
[2:26:58] remember jesus
[2:27:02] was not anointed
[2:27:04] until he come to the river jordan
[2:27:06] he was only god's creative body
[2:27:10] he was the seed
[2:27:11] he was the son of god he was the virgin
[2:27:14] born son of god and jesus did not
[2:27:16] receive the holy ghost because he was a
[2:27:18] sinner and needed to be saved
[2:27:21] he received the holy ghost without
[2:27:23] measure because
[2:27:26] he needed to be equipped
[2:27:29] find me one place in the scripture
[2:27:31] anywhere
[2:27:33] that said jesus had the holy ghost
[2:27:35] before he leaves jordan and goes into
[2:27:37] the wilderness jesus being full of the
[2:27:40] holy ghost goes into the wilderness be
[2:27:42] tempted to the devil find the scripture
[2:27:43] before that says that
[2:27:46] well then why did he receive it that way
[2:27:48] oh you say because he was god
[2:27:50] be careful
[2:27:52] jesus as a man
[2:27:54] the human body that was created was just
[2:27:57] as much flesh as you and i except it
[2:27:59] wasn't born according to the fall
[2:28:01] remember
[2:28:02] i said some time ago on the cross
[2:28:05] god crossed himself with that human body
[2:28:08] and placed that supernatural in the soul
[2:28:11] why
[2:28:12] because jesus in a little bit was gonna
[2:28:14] have to come nose to nose with the devil
[2:28:17] and even as the virgin-born son of god
[2:28:20] listen
[2:28:22] he was no match for the devil in his
[2:28:24] flesh
[2:28:28] oh that should have set the down i might
[2:28:30] offer some of you
[2:28:32] there was no way that he could have
[2:28:33] overcome satan in that human body
[2:28:36] he needed the holy ghost
[2:28:40] glory to god
[2:28:43] and once he got it then he goes into the
[2:28:45] wilderness i don't think he walked
[2:28:46] around looking for the devil like the
[2:28:48] terminator a rambo or somebody
[2:28:52] the holy ghost sent him into an attitude
[2:28:55] and an atmosphere of consecration did
[2:28:57] you notice
[2:28:58] when jesus comes out of jordan and steps
[2:29:01] to go into the river the very first
[2:29:03] thing he does god anoints him to go into
[2:29:05] fasting for 40 days
[2:29:08] he goes into a place to pray first thing
[2:29:10] he does goes out into the wilderness to
[2:29:12] consecrate himself why
[2:29:14] because now this anointing that has
[2:29:17] housed itself in this virgin-born body
[2:29:20] is now going to consecrate this vessel
[2:29:23] to do the works of god
[2:29:26] the lame is going to leap like a heart
[2:29:27] the blinded eyes are going to come open
[2:29:29] bruised and broken hearts are going to
[2:29:31] be mended all of these great things are
[2:29:33] going to take place show me one time he
[2:29:35] did it before that
[2:29:36] moment in jordan
[2:29:39] the best we get is 12 years old he's
[2:29:41] debating in the temple and mary jo
[2:29:44] joseph run off and leaving
[2:29:47] and when she comes back she said your
[2:29:49] father and i have sat you with tears
[2:29:51] well i bet that was a broadway
[2:29:52] production
[2:29:54] drama queen mary here she comes
[2:29:57] uh-huh that's what she was
[2:29:59] your father and i boy putting on the dog
[2:30:02] in front of all of those big high
[2:30:04] pollutant message preachers
[2:30:07] and jesus looks at her and says woman
[2:30:10] now you know that jesus was not a
[2:30:12] regular boy because if i would have said
[2:30:14] to my little redheaded 85 year old
[2:30:16] mother
[2:30:16] woman i would have probably never known
[2:30:19] anything else except the back side of
[2:30:21] her hand and the underside of the grave
[2:30:24] she'd have killed me
[2:30:28] the brother adam said the word corrected
[2:30:30] the error
[2:30:32] because he was the word
[2:30:35] but the anointing did not come to jesus
[2:30:38] so that it could make him the son of god
[2:30:42] he already was a son
[2:30:44] that's why he could receive
[2:30:47] the holy ghost
[2:30:51] this is the reason you
[2:30:53] can receive the holy ghost
[2:30:55] not because it makes you a son or
[2:30:57] daughter
[2:30:58] but because ye are sons
[2:31:02] glory
[2:31:04] because you are dollars
[2:31:07] he can send his spirit into your heart
[2:31:11] crying happen
[2:31:13] father
[2:31:15] father
[2:31:23] last statement we're gonna quit
[2:31:26] there was not one
[2:31:28] thing
[2:31:30] that ever confronted jesus
[2:31:34] that he wasn't equipped
[2:31:37] to beat
[2:31:42] let's put ourselves in his shoes okay
[2:31:46] brother brad you and i are evangelizing
[2:31:47] together right
[2:31:49] we go into a city
[2:31:51] somebody comes running to us
[2:31:54] this young girl's died she's 10 years
[2:31:56] old
[2:31:57] come come lay hands on her
[2:32:00] so we go into the house we walk in there
[2:32:02] the spirit of the lord moves on us
[2:32:04] this is not a
[2:32:06] she's not dead she's sleeping
[2:32:09] and everybody in the room imagine this
[2:32:11] room
[2:32:13] everybody starts laughing
[2:32:15] oh you know how people are
[2:32:17] but when they get on a roll especially
[2:32:19] when that spirit of fun making gets on
[2:32:22] there's a difference between fun making
[2:32:24] and having a sense of humor
[2:32:26] believe me please do yourself a favor do
[2:32:28] a study on the difference and learn a
[2:32:29] difference
[2:32:31] it'll help you
[2:32:34] and they go and they start laughing to
[2:32:36] scorn
[2:32:40] jesus says every one of you
[2:32:42] get out
[2:32:46] and then he reaches down takes her by
[2:32:48] the hand and speaks in that dimension
[2:32:51] arise mate
[2:32:55] could you imagine what it might have
[2:32:56] looked like on the other side of the
[2:32:57] veil
[2:32:58] and that chasm of the gulf
[2:33:01] of paradise where that that veil was
[2:33:03] just right here just like it'd be in
[2:33:05] another room and there's a veil just a
[2:33:06] gulf fix and she's standing there in
[2:33:08] that dimension next to father abraham
[2:33:14] and jesus speaks
[2:33:16] and before she knows it she just walks
[2:33:18] through the door
[2:33:19] and she's laying back on the bed
[2:33:22] you say how do you know that because we
[2:33:24] already had one astronaut that told us
[2:33:25] that's how it works
[2:33:27] [Laughter]
[2:33:30] hallelujah
[2:33:32] he said he moved out of his body and
[2:33:34] looked back there was sitting on the bed
[2:33:41] he didn't allow laughter to overcome him
[2:33:44] can i say something to you social media
[2:33:46] people young ones middle-aged ones
[2:33:50] if you are equipped with the holy ghost
[2:33:52] there is no amount of social media
[2:33:54] bullying
[2:33:56] that can overcome your walk with god
[2:34:00] let everybody on instagram let every
[2:34:02] vile or post
[2:34:05] speak against you let people make fun of
[2:34:07] you
[2:34:08] say all manner of ought and evil
[2:34:11] against you
[2:34:12] but if you're born again of the holy
[2:34:14] ghost there's not enough bullies on the
[2:34:15] internet to take you away from what god
[2:34:17] called you to be
[2:34:19] you know why people get overcome with
[2:34:21] this stuff
[2:34:30] i go just a bit further
[2:34:31] can i give you thank you
[2:34:33] i hate to quit right here i got so many
[2:34:34] good things but
[2:34:36] and demonology the prophet said like
[2:34:38] this he said let's talk about the death
[2:34:39] side how could a person in that estate
[2:34:41] though not being born again
[2:34:43] in that kind of condition ever be sick
[2:34:45] why because your body is not yet
[2:34:48] redeemed
[2:34:51] no matter how good you are how saintly
[2:34:54] how holy how much holy spirit
[2:34:58] that's only your soul
[2:35:00] and your soul is not completed yet
[2:35:04] it's just got the blessing
[2:35:07] the promise of god which is the earnest
[2:35:09] of our salvation
[2:35:12] he said because see the earnest which is
[2:35:14] the baptism of the holy spirit that's
[2:35:16] down payment the earnest which holds it
[2:35:19] secure
[2:35:21] in heaven
[2:35:23] for us
[2:35:26] paul said if we leave this life we have
[2:35:28] another body waiting bigger than five we
[2:35:30] have one a tabernacle already waiting
[2:35:33] do you know why it's waiting
[2:35:36] because the down payment for your new
[2:35:38] body
[2:35:39] has already been made
[2:35:41] and when you receive the holy ghost your
[2:35:44] holy ghost secures
[2:35:46] that body
[2:35:47] in heaven
[2:35:48] for you
[2:35:50] glory to god it'd be like you bought a
[2:35:52] car
[2:35:53] and waiting on it to be delivered
[2:35:56] you lay down the earnest money you pay
[2:35:57] your payment all you're waiting for
[2:35:59] honey is for the truck to pull in your
[2:36:01] driveway and drop it off oh hallelujah
[2:36:04] that's exactly what the rapture and the
[2:36:06] resurrection is going to be for every
[2:36:08] one of us that are born again by the
[2:36:10] holy ghost i'm only waiting on the fairy
[2:36:12] man to cross the river
[2:36:14] and bring my new body to me
[2:36:17] [Music]
[2:36:20] it secures my eternal life
[2:36:24] because what good would it do to be all
[2:36:26] born again in the soul and have a body
[2:36:28] that still gets old and sick and
[2:36:30] decrepit and dies and goes off by the
[2:36:32] way of the grave
[2:36:34] so my down payment holds
[2:36:38] my resurrection
[2:36:41] and my rapture holds it you know how it
[2:36:44] is when you go to layaway or some of
[2:36:46] these places and you put down some money
[2:36:48] you bought this certain bit of carpet or
[2:36:50] a piece of furniture or something of
[2:36:52] that nature long as you got your earnest
[2:36:54] money down your pledge down nobody can
[2:36:56] touch it
[2:36:58] let the devil strike you with cancer let
[2:37:01] him strike you with coven let him strike
[2:37:03] you with all sorts of evil and diseases
[2:37:05] and manners of evil let him strike this
[2:37:08] body all he wants my down payment is
[2:37:11] holding my eternal body nobody not even
[2:37:14] the devil can touch it
[2:37:16] he can't take it away from me he can
[2:37:19] steal it from me oh glory he's got it
[2:37:22] held in heaven reserved in heaven
[2:37:25] waiting on me to get my change
[2:37:30] [Music]
[2:37:36] he said that's right think of it a down
[2:37:38] payment if there's no joy here
[2:37:42] then there can be no joy there
[2:37:47] we just got the earnest that's right
[2:37:50] and if there's no healing here
[2:37:53] there's no resurrection there
[2:37:56] healing what does divine healing speak
[2:37:58] of it's the earnest of the resurrection
[2:38:04] if there's no holy spirit now to baptize
[2:38:06] us
[2:38:08] there's no eternal life in the world to
[2:38:10] come
[2:38:12] so what your holy ghost speaks of
[2:38:15] when you have joy when you have peace
[2:38:17] when you have understanding when you
[2:38:19] have wisdom when you have supernatural
[2:38:21] working when you have a word of
[2:38:22] knowledge when you have faith when you
[2:38:25] have all of these things that work in a
[2:38:27] portion you may only see it once a month
[2:38:30] but that one time that it shows up is
[2:38:33] ever defense
[2:38:38] that there's more coming on the other
[2:38:39] side
[2:38:42] i'll never understand people in this
[2:38:44] message that claim that they're going to
[2:38:45] a heaven where they shout rejoice praise
[2:38:47] the lord and have eternal joy
[2:38:49] and they can't seem not even get a
[2:38:50] little tiny piece of it down here
[2:38:53] they're so miserable they're miserable
[2:38:54] are miserables
[2:38:57] i mean they're just miserable their
[2:38:58] whole life is nothing but one great big
[2:39:00] misery
[2:39:02] and then you ask them about the holy
[2:39:04] ghost yeah i'm born again all right good
[2:39:06] lord i wish you would notify the rest of
[2:39:08] you
[2:39:12] i talked to a brother the other day
[2:39:13] wonderful brother beautiful brother i
[2:39:15] genuinely believe he's a christian full
[2:39:17] of the holy ghost but he is the most
[2:39:18] negative human being i've ever heard in
[2:39:20] my life
[2:39:22] i said to him i said don't you
[2:39:23] understand the holy ghost is supposed to
[2:39:25] give you positivity he said i am
[2:39:27] positive that life is bad
[2:39:34] but you see sometimes this is just the
[2:39:35] nature of people
[2:39:37] but when you get to hold a ghost no
[2:39:39] matter what nature you're born under
[2:39:41] there is a supernatural something that
[2:39:43] kind of moves in even if it's just a
[2:39:46] brief fleeting moment i may only and the
[2:39:48] years i've preached you're going on a
[2:39:50] long time now
[2:39:51] there's some of you i don't know that
[2:39:52] i've ever seen smile
[2:39:55] i preach a lot of services here at this
[2:39:57] little church and some of you i don't
[2:39:58] know that i've ever seen some of you
[2:39:59] smile
[2:40:01] and i pull out all my best good jokes
[2:40:04] make all the funny faces i need to make
[2:40:05] i act like an idiot sometimes just to
[2:40:07] get some of you to loosen up
[2:40:10] woo preach
[2:40:14] but if all i ever get to see every now
[2:40:16] and then is just all of a sudden
[2:40:19] i mean when that happens some of you all
[2:40:21] are in revival
[2:40:23] you are wide open forget about tongues
[2:40:25] forget about interpretation forget about
[2:40:28] right raised to the dead and seeing
[2:40:29] angels
[2:40:32] somebody said glory to god i want the
[2:40:34] power to be
[2:40:35] able to raise again i said i wish you
[2:40:37] just raised the corners of your mouth
[2:40:39] every now and then
[2:40:40] [Music]
[2:40:44] but if there is joy here
[2:40:47] speaks of eternal joy there
[2:40:50] glory to god
[2:40:53] and if i've got his holy ghost now
[2:40:56] it speaks of eternal
[2:40:58] holy ghost do you know that even in the
[2:41:00] new city you'll still be baptized with
[2:41:01] the holy ghost
[2:41:03] only difference is you won't just have a
[2:41:05] portion
[2:41:07] you'll have the full inheritance
[2:41:11] oh you say brother ben these things
[2:41:14] preach something deep man you understand
[2:41:16] that in the years that i have traveled
[2:41:20] i i've studied um
[2:41:22] hours of my life away
[2:41:25] understanding the mysteries of god
[2:41:26] understanding the things that's been
[2:41:28] brought to us
[2:41:29] i feel like after all these years i have
[2:41:31] a comprehension and a revelation to be
[2:41:34] able to talk to you about any subject
[2:41:35] you want to talk about
[2:41:38] and i don't say that bragging i just
[2:41:39] mean that i've tried to do my homework
[2:41:41] i've tried to be a good steward and be
[2:41:43] faithful and be what the bible said
[2:41:45] study to show myself approved i believe
[2:41:46] i've reached that place by god's grace
[2:41:48] to some extent
[2:41:51] but do you know what i find
[2:41:53] when i talk to people because i listen
[2:41:54] to them
[2:41:58] i find that out of all of these great
[2:42:00] mysterious and deep things that we talk
[2:42:01] about
[2:42:03] these are folks that still don't even
[2:42:04] know how to have joy on an everyday
[2:42:06] basis
[2:42:07] they can't sleep
[2:42:09] their marriages are a mess
[2:42:11] they hate their job and they have not a
[2:42:13] speck of joy in their life
[2:42:16] now come on somebody tell me
[2:42:19] is this what god wanted for us
[2:42:22] that's what the holy ghost is supposed
[2:42:23] to bring for us ultimate misery
[2:42:29] i know that dying is a part of living
[2:42:31] sure
[2:42:32] i know that sorrow is a part of joy i
[2:42:34] know that sickness is a part of health
[2:42:36] there are law of contrast
[2:42:38] but god did not give us the precious
[2:42:40] holy ghost so we could walk around
[2:42:42] focusing on how dark it was all the time
[2:42:47] that's why in the darkest hour jesus
[2:42:49] comes
[2:42:51] as a light
[2:42:52] in the darkness
[2:42:54] because the lord don't want us walking
[2:42:55] around with no joy no victory no peace
[2:43:00] some of you that are battling health
[2:43:01] problems in your body you cry to the
[2:43:03] lord god please please please
[2:43:06] but eve even in the middle of sickness
[2:43:08] even in the middle of financial troubles
[2:43:10] and everything else there is a resource
[2:43:14] where you ought to be able to step back
[2:43:16] from every bit of it and say this is but
[2:43:18] a temporal thing
[2:43:20] because all my hope is in jesus
[2:43:24] all of my joy all of my worship all of
[2:43:27] my love and only at the feet of jesus
[2:43:30] will i worship
[2:43:35] the bride's equipment
[2:43:37] you're equipped with every thing
[2:43:40] you have need of
[2:43:43] let's stand together
[2:43:46] you're having fun enjoying the word i am
[2:43:48] too but that clock is not gonna stop
[2:43:52] and i know some of y'all got super bowl
[2:43:53] parties to plan
[2:43:55] popcorn to buy potato chips to get a
[2:43:57] hold of i know i don't want to ruin your
[2:44:00] shopping experience
[2:44:02] that you get down to business
[2:44:04] by the way
[2:44:05] root for my bengals that's where i come
[2:44:07] from
[2:44:07] [Laughter]
[2:44:10] it's actually kind of comical we come up
[2:44:12] over the river going i was heading north
[2:44:14] for a meeting
[2:44:15] and we hit
[2:44:16] used to be riverfront stadium back when
[2:44:18] the reds was playing with pete rosen
[2:44:20] guys they tore that thing down now it's
[2:44:22] the great american ball park in the back
[2:44:24] and then they got the big stadium up
[2:44:25] front you know
[2:44:27] and we come right over the bridge on 75
[2:44:29] they hit that border right at kentucky
[2:44:31] right when the bengals won the playoffs
[2:44:33] and they had it you know the yellow
[2:44:35] fireworks was going off all over the
[2:44:37] stadium and we pulled over and you could
[2:44:39] see a glimpse of the stadium coming down
[2:44:41] and there was so much orange and then
[2:44:43] people were on their feet and they were
[2:44:44] screaming
[2:44:46] and they were freezing to death too it's
[2:44:47] ohio y'all
[2:44:50] and they were just carrying on and i
[2:44:52] thought i looked at that and i thought
[2:44:53] to myself
[2:44:55] this is the only joy some people's ever
[2:44:57] going to get in their life
[2:44:59] over a big bag of air
[2:45:02] that i still can't catch very well
[2:45:05] i can play that though
[2:45:07] i can do something you can't do
[2:45:12] and the fact of the matter is
[2:45:15] brother brahma said don't condemn the
[2:45:16] sinner when he enjoys his pipe and his
[2:45:18] cigars and things it's the only joy they
[2:45:21] know
[2:45:22] oh children of god please hear my words
[2:45:26] why can we not experience that on a such
[2:45:28] higher level
[2:45:31] that even when life is completely upside
[2:45:34] down
[2:45:35] there ought to be something inside of us
[2:45:37] to be able to raise our hands and say
[2:45:38] lord
[2:45:40] you woke me up this morning
[2:45:43] i was in my right mind
[2:45:46] you see in every case there's always a
[2:45:48] silver lining
[2:45:51] can i say one more
[2:45:52] i
[2:45:53] this was out of an old article many many
[2:45:55] years ago about the procrastinator no no
[2:45:57] no no no no well the
[2:45:59] not antagonist what is it when the
[2:46:01] positive and the negative pessimist and
[2:46:03] obvious thank you
