[13:47] any man good to be in the house of the
[13:49] Lord tonight
[13:51] you love the Lord having a good week
[13:54] praise the Lord you can have your seats
[13:56] for a few minutes if you'd like
[14:01] I want to just kind of lay a foundation
[14:03] I guess before
[14:04] we stand for the scripture reading
[14:07] but I was in thinking and you know
[14:10] pondering on what to what to speak on
[14:12] and what direction the church seems to
[14:14] be going and and you know my Ministries
[14:17] uh you know it's it's just uh
[14:23] I could go myself but as far as as
[14:27] what's happening right now I've been
[14:28] looking at what's going on in the church
[14:30] and we've been seeing that we've been
[14:32] hearing the preaching of love and grace
[14:34] and laying your burdens down and and uh
[14:38] just all these wonderful messages and
[14:40] brother Butler preached on prayer if you
[14:42] want to get closer to God you what
[14:44] read your Bible and pray
[14:46] and so you know and and I think well God
[14:49] what are you what are you doing what
[14:50] what are you you know we're going in a
[14:52] direction that we're we're in a
[14:54] different kind of Direction it seems
[14:55] like we've heard these things forever
[14:57] but it seems like we're not into the so
[14:59] much the
[15:01] the do's and the don'ts but we're more
[15:03] geared towards a different direction and
[15:05] this is just my thinking but you tell me
[15:07] but it seems like the thought come on my
[15:09] mind
[15:10] is worship
[15:12] God wants worship
[15:16] and uh thinking about this I was looking
[15:19] back and kind of looking over history
[15:20] and some of the different things and of
[15:23] the church itself back even into the
[15:25] 1800s and in this area and I was looking
[15:28] and
[15:29] trying to put some stuff together and
[15:30] tonight probably be a little slower I'm
[15:32] looking at the clock because I'm afraid
[15:34] I'll go too long I'll just warn you
[15:37] okay
[15:38] uh Brother David you just wave at me
[15:40] when we get close so I'm gonna try not
[15:43] to go along but I do Wednesday nights I
[15:45] feel like are the time to get in and
[15:46] teach you got you got to you know you
[15:49] got a group of people here that's
[15:50] hungering for the word and it's time to
[15:52] teach and get get closer to God and
[15:54] really dig into this preachers in the
[15:57] message and so I want to try to slow
[15:59] down and look at some scriptures today
[16:00] talking about worship and I don't want
[16:01] you to think oh this is another one of
[16:03] those Services where he's trying to get
[16:05] us to all sing more he's trying to get
[16:06] us to that's not what I'm talking about
[16:08] and you'll you'll find out we're looking
[16:10] at it in a different direction so but
[16:12] looking at history
[16:15] um I was looking you haven't heard of
[16:17] Peter Cartwright
[16:18] if you've heard the messages you've
[16:19] heard of Peter Cartwright I've studied
[16:21] on him a little bit and I'm reading a
[16:23] book it's uh he's called The Backwoods
[16:25] preacher and uh boy was he back woods uh
[16:29] you know he's the one brother random
[16:30] talked about was cleaning the windows
[16:32] and you all know the story the guy comes
[16:34] in to to tell him he can't have Revival
[16:36] and he says well the Lord told me to
[16:38] have Revival and he says well you'll
[16:40] have to whoop me first and he says well
[16:41] that's what I'll do next
[16:43] and so he he whooped him and saved he
[16:46] was saved that night the gentleman was
[16:48] but uh story after story after Story and
[16:52] I was trying to figure out about some of
[16:54] the forefathers like that and just a
[16:56] little bit of history for you Peter
[16:57] Cartwright was born in uh Virginia
[16:59] Elkton Virginia
[17:02] and uh he was moved when he was a young
[17:04] man into Logan County Kentucky so just
[17:07] across the border when he was a teenager
[17:09] his family moved and that's where his
[17:11] ministry took off out of Logan County
[17:13] just he read the book it talks about
[17:15] right just on the other side of uh
[17:17] problem thinking probably the days will
[17:19] area in that area somewhere in that area
[17:21] there into Tennessee but he would talk
[17:25] about back in the 1800s now at 15 years
[17:27] old
[17:28] 1800 1801 15 years old
[17:32] and they would have 20 000 people
[17:35] gathered
[17:37] to come to meetings
[17:39] 20th
[17:40] in Logan County in 1800 and a little
[17:43] more history for you the the courthouse
[17:45] that we have is the second oldest
[17:46] standing Courthouse here in Todd County
[17:48] and it was in 1835.
[17:50] so you can imagine 1800 how did 20 000
[17:54] people come to these services
[17:57] these people were dedicated it was more
[18:00] than just say I'm going to go to church
[18:01] this Sunday
[18:02] it's more than just saying I'm going to
[18:04] be a part of this group or I'm going to
[18:05] go over here but they were dedicated
[18:07] they got together on horse and buggy and
[18:09] wagons and they got the word out and
[18:11] they spread the word and they got
[18:12] everybody together 20 000 people and
[18:14] said that the shouting and the screaming
[18:16] of the meetings were so loud that it
[18:19] could be heard from two to three miles
[18:21] away
[18:24] what kind of worship is that
[18:28] that's an amazing worship back then I
[18:31] was looking at more and I thought who
[18:32] are some of these big people that run
[18:33] campaigns A.A Allen 20 000 people would
[18:37] gather under a canvas tent
[18:40] and he would preach and they would shout
[18:42] and they would worship and they would
[18:44] praise
[18:46] and big things happen in these meetings
[18:48] Billy Graham packed out the the stadium
[18:51] at Texas stadium
[18:53] 83 000 people in attendance 12 000 young
[18:56] people on the outside of the stadium
[18:58] watching on a big screen
[19:01] what was that there was a desire for
[19:04] these people I got to see what God is
[19:07] doing today
[19:09] I want to get in there I want to get
[19:11] where the fire is
[19:13] I want to get down there and I want to
[19:15] see how God is going to move and I'm
[19:16] going to worship and I'm going to praise
[19:20] you take brother Brown 1952 a campaign
[19:22] in South Africa his largest of his Camp
[19:25] campaigns ever over 200 000 people
[19:27] meeting
[19:29] in one spot
[19:32] that's amazing
[19:34] these people came to worship
[19:37] where's the worship today
[19:43] one of the biggest displays I've ever
[19:46] witnessed in my life of worship
[19:49] it was a couple of weeks ago
[19:52] there was over a hundred and two
[19:53] thousand people in attendance
[19:55] 12 to 15
[19:57] 000 people outside watching on a screen
[20:03] the city sold out of hotel rooms 9 500
[20:06] hotel rooms sold
[20:15] 11.6 million viewers
[20:18] on television
[20:20] what's the name of that church in
[20:22] Knoxville brother Joe
[20:25] Neyland Stadium
[20:29] are you with me
[20:31] that was one of the biggest displays of
[20:33] worship that I have seen you say man
[20:36] where are you going on this those people
[20:38] knew how to worship
[20:40] they had a goal they had a reason they
[20:42] had a purpose they prepared for weeks
[20:45] after you think what kind of services
[20:46] would would churches have around the
[20:49] world if they prepared the way that
[20:51] those people prepared to go to that
[20:53] service
[20:56] they prepared for weeks and days and
[20:58] weeks in anticipation for what was about
[21:00] to happen
[21:02] they came early to the service to meet
[21:05] up with fellow believers
[21:10] hey they even came before the doors were
[21:12] open
[21:14] they walked from miles to get to the
[21:17] service
[21:20] it didn't matter if it was going to rain
[21:23] snow sleet hail
[21:29] so where's our worshipers
[21:32] where's our worshipers at
[21:35] they dressed in their best outfits
[21:40] they wanted a piece of the action
[21:43] hey when Tennessee won that ball game
[21:45] they demolished the stadium they tore
[21:48] the goal pose down marched them out
[21:50] praising praising praising
[21:55] now you know I'm not a I'm not on
[21:59] people for for sports you know that you
[22:01] know me well enough to know that
[22:04] but these people's display was more than
[22:07] just fans
[22:09] they wanted a piece of this they took
[22:11] the goal post down carried them into the
[22:12] streets down to the streets threw them
[22:14] in the river
[22:16] and then they come back and said no no
[22:17] no go get them
[22:19] so in fraternity Brothers goes down and
[22:21] pulls the goal post back out of the
[22:23] river takes it back to the fraternity
[22:25] house they start cutting it up
[22:28] and sell in the little pieces because
[22:30] everybody wanted a piece of what they
[22:32] were worshiping
[22:35] and this collects dust on our Shelf
[22:42] are you with me
[22:48] so I want to speak tonight
[22:51] I'll let the worshipers
[22:54] arise
[22:55] he would stand with me we'll go into the
[22:57] scriptures
[23:01] you know they sure are going to be
[23:02] disappointed with Kentucky rolls in
[23:03] there this weekend
[23:05] foreign
[23:09] I say that to get your attention
[23:12] but think about this
[23:14] they worship something that is up and
[23:17] down
[23:18] they're number 21 weeks sixth one week
[23:21] three one week they get beat by the
[23:23] underdog they win the biggest game let
[23:25] me tell you my God don't lose
[23:27] I've got something to worship about
[23:31] they're worth worshiping on something
[23:32] that's not solid it's not absolute they
[23:35] don't know what's going to happen from
[23:36] year to year
[23:37] are you with me
[23:39] we've got a Reason To Worship
[23:43] turn it if you would in the book of Acts
[23:46] 13.
[23:48] 1-3
[23:51] .
[23:53] and I also want you to hold your place
[23:55] in Ezekiel
[23:56] I'll tell you early so you can find it
[23:58] it kind of hides from us
[24:00] Ezekiel 28.
[24:03] save it for later
[24:09] the book of Acts 13 1-3
[24:14] now there were in the church that was at
[24:17] Antioch certain prophets and teachers
[24:20] Barnabas and Simon
[24:22] that was called Niger
[24:24] Lucius of Cyrene
[24:28] Monet
[24:30] which had been brought up with Herod the
[24:31] Tea Tree Art and Saul
[24:34] as they minister to the Lord and fasted
[24:36] the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas
[24:38] and Saul
[24:40] for the work where unto I have called
[24:41] them
[24:42] and when they had fasted and prayed and
[24:44] laid their hands on them they sent them
[24:46] away
[24:47] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[24:49] Ring of the word you can have your seeds
[24:51] so I'm going to look at two quick
[24:52] definitions before we get started I'm
[24:54] gonna look at the definition of
[24:55] entertain
[24:57] so entertaining means to provide someone
[25:01] with amusement
[25:04] or enjoyment
[25:07] to provide someone with amusement or
[25:10] enjoyment and the word worship we know
[25:12] it means expressing reverence and
[25:14] adoration for deity or God so the two
[25:18] totally different definitions there but
[25:20] worship does something for us
[25:22] when we completely worship God and when
[25:25] we dedicate ourselves before God
[25:27] something happens in our body the
[25:29] University of Utah done a study with the
[25:31] MRI and they notice they put these
[25:34] probes and all these uh things onto an
[25:36] MRI and they sent people to church or
[25:39] had church service wherever the study
[25:40] was
[25:41] and I noticed that when people were
[25:43] worshiping God
[25:46] that something happened in their brain
[25:48] it turned on receptors in their brain in
[25:51] the pre-quarter cortex of their brain
[25:54] and the frontal cortex neurons started
[25:56] firing electrodes started firing things
[25:59] started happening when they were
[26:00] worshiping and what they found out is
[26:02] what what turned on was the reward
[26:04] center
[26:07] so when they were worshiping God
[26:09] something in their body scientifically
[26:13] said hey you're fixing to be rewarded
[26:17] yeah think about that so whenever you
[26:20] want something from God we need to
[26:22] worship God because the reward is going
[26:24] to come they proved it time and time
[26:26] again that these reward was set
[26:28] receptors would come on like hey ding
[26:30] ding ding God's fixing to get back
[26:32] and we need God to give back
[26:37] so here we're looking at this church
[26:39] here in the book of Acts
[26:41] and I'm going to take my time here and I
[26:42] want you to look now we're looking at
[26:43] this church in Antioch and we see
[26:45] Barnabas and Saul and John Mark they
[26:48] were all up in the in the church in
[26:49] Antioch and the returning delivering a
[26:52] gift of support uh to the church in
[26:54] Jerusalem and here is Saul and Barnabas
[26:57] amongst these teachers and Prophets and
[26:59] Simon and Lucius and manea
[27:02] and here they are Simon I want you to
[27:04] notice this because we talked about him
[27:06] here a while back
[27:07] scholars believe that this Simon who was
[27:09] called Niger
[27:11] he said it was a black man so they think
[27:14] that it's the same Simon of Cyrene that
[27:16] carried the cross
[27:17] to Calvary
[27:20] you want to know the correlation this
[27:22] guy here is somebody special he done
[27:24] something for Jesus right here and so
[27:26] here's this Simon that carried the cross
[27:28] Manan it says was mentioned and he grew
[27:30] up with who Herod
[27:33] you see the contrast you got Herod here
[27:36] he grew up with Herod it's the same
[27:38] Herod that beheaded John the Baptist
[27:41] it's the same hair that took place in
[27:44] the pre-trial of Jesus Christ
[27:46] but these two grew up together so what
[27:48] happened something happened in their
[27:50] childhood that made them both go very
[27:52] different ways because one kills Jesus
[27:55] and one becomes a Christian and begins
[27:58] to serve and worship Jesus
[28:02] NOW Watch What Happens here
[28:06] as they ministered
[28:08] to the Lord
[28:11] now I've been involved in meetings
[28:13] before where people were ministering to
[28:15] others we caught ministering the
[28:17] preacher gets up and ministers the word
[28:19] we go to the sick and we minister to the
[28:22] needs we go to the hungry the needy
[28:24] whoever and you minister to them
[28:27] but now it says here they are
[28:28] ministering
[28:30] to the Lord
[28:32] let me ask you this
[28:34] was Jesus sick or was God sick Jesus
[28:37] already gone at this time this is so
[28:38] we're talking about God
[28:40] same same thing don't get me confused
[28:42] don't get confused on me
[28:43] but God almighty
[28:46] they're ministering to the Lord
[28:49] did God need help was he sick
[28:53] was he needy
[28:54] no was he poor no it says they were
[28:58] ministering to the Lord and that ought
[29:00] to be our job as any servant any
[29:02] Christian of God that we minister to God
[29:06] because when we minister to the Lord it
[29:09] means we're doing what pleases him
[29:12] it means that when we're ministering it
[29:13] means we're worshiping God it means
[29:16] we're praising God we're praying to God
[29:18] we're listening to God to see what he
[29:20] would have back to get back to us and
[29:23] we're beginning to honor God and we're
[29:24] lifting God up because when you look at
[29:26] the word ministering here it's different
[29:28] than what I'm doing right now
[29:31] foreign
[29:35] translate it's worship
[29:38] they Minister into the Lord and fasted
[29:41] so here they come to the part of the
[29:43] service they're before the Lord they're
[29:45] ministering to the lord they're fasting
[29:47] so this must have been something that
[29:49] was really really important right
[29:51] because we don't fast anymore
[29:56] well
[29:59] when we hear the word fast
[30:02] we think that there's something dire
[30:04] it's something to me something needed
[30:05] desperately needed so here are the men
[30:08] of God now
[30:09] and there's ministering to the lord
[30:11] they're fasting before the Lord and this
[30:13] is a serious situation because they're
[30:15] trying to figure out who will we send
[30:17] out to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[30:20] to the world
[30:22] God we need direction from you
[30:25] and if more of us would take time to
[30:28] fall down before God and worship and
[30:30] minister to him in the decisions in our
[30:32] lives
[30:33] we would say that God would move on to
[30:35] the scene
[30:36] you say how do you know that
[30:40] well you can't be backseat drivers
[30:43] you got to be on the Forefront
[30:45] you got to be there right at God's feet
[30:47] minister to him and that's the way God
[30:50] sends back his word to his people so
[30:53] Watch What Happens they're ministering
[30:55] to the Lord and fasting and what does it
[30:58] say happens next
[30:59] the holy spirit said
[31:03] did you catch that
[31:06] the Holy Spirit
[31:09] said
[31:10] the holy spirit said
[31:13] that I want you to send Barnabas and
[31:15] Saul to do my specific work so here's
[31:17] these brothers all gathered together
[31:19] they're ministering to God they're
[31:20] praising God lifting up God lord we've
[31:23] seen all of your Mighty works we see
[31:25] Jesus when he walked we've seen the
[31:26] Miracles that's happened Lord you're
[31:28] awesome you're mighty you're more than
[31:30] we could ever ask for God but we need
[31:33] your guidance
[31:34] and the Holy Ghost said
[31:37] you want something from God go minister
[31:40] to God and ask him and he'll get back to
[31:42] you
[31:43] so many times we want to pray and we've
[31:46] got to pray
[31:47] I'm not not knocking that at all but
[31:50] there's more than just asking
[31:54] God wants more from you than just asking
[31:56] asking asking
[31:59] nothing gets under my nerves more than
[32:01] my kids coming to me and just asking
[32:03] asking asking asking
[32:05] has anybody ever been there
[32:07] can I go can I go dad can I go can I go
[32:09] here can I kind of counter Canada
[32:12] man you sound like a horse
[32:18] which comes to be minister to and so
[32:21] many times in our in our lives we have
[32:23] needs and we have desires that we would
[32:25] like to see the manifestations of God in
[32:27] and we'd like to see those
[32:29] manifestations in action and we pray and
[32:31] we pray and we pray and nothing happens
[32:35] is that because God is mad at us or he's
[32:37] displeased with us or he's discouraged
[32:40] or he's scolding you
[32:42] no
[32:44] but let me ask did you worship Him
[32:49] and I'm asking myself I wonder do we
[32:52] fall short in worshiping god with praise
[32:54] and honor and glory and reverence and
[32:56] adoration
[32:58] before we ask the need because let me
[33:02] tell you he knows everything you need
[33:05] the Sparrow's need for nothing
[33:08] the deer need for nothing
[33:11] anything in nature needs for nothing
[33:15] you need for nothing he knows what you
[33:18] need
[33:20] but he wants love
[33:22] he wants worship he wants adoration I'm
[33:25] not scolding anybody tonight because I'm
[33:27] trying to learn myself because I'm
[33:29] trying to learn how to properly worship
[33:30] God I want to get to a place
[33:34] that I'm worshiping God in such a way
[33:36] because if you look down through
[33:37] scriptures you'll find out that those
[33:40] people who worship God the most are the
[33:43] most powerful and have the most
[33:44] authority of Jesus and God that you
[33:47] could ever ask for
[33:50] because you are quiet tonight
[33:57] but I'm afraid
[34:00] that this world
[34:02] has hardened us
[34:04] this world that we live in has hardened
[34:06] us to a place
[34:09] we don't see those gospel meetings that
[34:10] I mentioned before
[34:14] we don't have people coming to church
[34:16] early to try to get a close parking spot
[34:18] or try to get the front row seat or or
[34:21] rubbing shoulders to fight through the
[34:23] doors
[34:24] hoping that you don't have
[34:26] your standing room only at Kneeland
[34:29] Stadium
[34:30] we put 150 people in here
[34:33] and we've got the greatest thing going
[34:35] that the world could ever ask for
[34:39] um
[34:40] but this world I'm afraid has brought us
[34:42] to a place that we're uncomfortable
[34:45] to truly worship God
[34:50] uncomfortable to truly worship God
[34:53] brothers and sisters why is that
[34:56] are we in a hurry
[34:59] ask yourself these questions are we in a
[35:01] hurry are you in a hurry when you come
[35:02] to church are you in a hurry
[35:05] are we worried about what the person
[35:07] next to us is going to think say or look
[35:09] at us
[35:11] I've never heard them say anything boy
[35:15] they must have had a real experience
[35:19] boy he can't sing
[35:23] are you worried
[35:25] or here's the one that gets me the most
[35:27] that I thought about the most I studied
[35:29] and looked into it are we not aware of
[35:31] his presence
[35:35] because I found out the more I make
[35:37] myself aware to take the time to slow
[35:40] down
[35:42] and don't worry what everybody thinks
[35:44] and notice God in his presence
[35:48] I was driving down the road just uh two
[35:50] or three days ago
[35:52] and I looked over my shoulder and and
[35:53] the little Cloud over there was blue and
[35:56] had one of those real bright flashes of
[35:58] gold and yellow well they call them
[35:59] brother Butler you used to call them
[36:01] something
[36:03] Chicago Sun dog years ago
[36:09] and it was just the prettiest thing and
[36:11] I just look I said
[36:12] Lord that's beautiful
[36:15] only you can do that
[36:18] there's not a man there's not an
[36:20] invention there's not a creation they
[36:22] could go and put that up in the sky just
[36:24] like you did thank you for showing that
[36:26] to me
[36:27] because God you're amazing you're the
[36:30] best artist I've ever seen in my life
[36:33] so I'm trying to get my place into a
[36:35] place of worship where I notice God's
[36:37] presence
[36:38] I was driving down the road yesterday
[36:40] going to a job that I had to go to in
[36:42] Owensboro and I thought Lord these
[36:46] leaves are more orange than I've ever
[36:48] seen in my life
[36:50] is it just me that's getting older and
[36:52] slowing down and thinking about this and
[36:54] I'm noticing it or is it always been
[36:56] this way
[36:57] because this is awesome
[37:00] God this is awesome
[37:02] and as I'm telling God that I had songs
[37:05] playing I I really get down in the car
[37:10] but I had songs playing and it just so
[37:12] happened that the music just fit the the
[37:14] scenario and tears started running down
[37:17] my eyes for no reason and I just
[37:19] couldn't quit crying I'm just like Lord
[37:20] You're So Good
[37:24] help me worship God day by day by day
[37:28] like that that's what I want I want that
[37:29] kind of worship that I feel his presence
[37:31] I notice his presence and I make him
[37:34] aware that I know he's there
[37:39] listen here
[37:42] the ram says
[37:44] the irreverence
[37:45] he said you know what it is
[37:48] they are not conscious of the presence
[37:50] of God
[37:51] he said the world has become so so
[37:54] common and religion has become so low
[37:57] ebbed that there's no respects that's
[37:59] just the way it is he said look at them
[38:01] soldiers we could think tonight how
[38:03] irrational and horrible a thing it was
[38:06] for them soldiers to put a rag over the
[38:08] face of our Lord Jesus to make fun of
[38:11] him being a prophet
[38:13] and they put the rag over his face he
[38:15] said how irrational is that he said they
[38:18] could feel no virtue
[38:24] because you know God was full of virtue
[38:28] God was full of virtue and he's just
[38:30] waiting for
[38:31] for people to recognize that virtue
[38:35] the woman with the issue come up to him
[38:37] and he touched the Hem of her garment
[38:38] and what did he do he turned around and
[38:40] said who touched me virtue has left me
[38:45] there was something she needed she knew
[38:47] he had and she began to worship him if I
[38:49] could just Touch the Hem of my Lord's
[38:51] garment
[38:54] and virtue left him he said like David
[38:58] says
[39:00] let me back up he says we got these five
[39:02] senses that we live in it's this little
[39:04] world of our own he said
[39:07] see taste here smell touch all those
[39:10] things
[39:12] he said it's our little world we live in
[39:14] he said but that's that wasn't a given
[39:17] so that we can talk contact our Earthly
[39:19] home
[39:20] he says but their senses beyond that
[39:22] another dimension he said and God is
[39:26] always present
[39:28] if we could just remember that
[39:34] so many times we get caught up
[39:37] we fail to remember that God is around
[39:41] us or has representation around us all
[39:45] the time
[39:47] he said the angels of the Lord are
[39:49] encamped about those that fear Him
[39:52] he says in this building tonight stands
[39:54] Jesus Christ he said in this building
[39:56] tonight stands a host of angels
[39:58] thousands of them
[40:02] if we could open our eyes our spiritual
[40:04] eyes and God would reveal to us
[40:09] we would probably have a heart attack
[40:13] well I don't know that we could handle
[40:15] what happens in the Unseen World around
[40:17] us
[40:19] I don't know that we can handle that
[40:20] because he said there's thousands of
[40:22] them right there and he said those
[40:23] angels they stayed they don't leave they
[40:25] stay near those
[40:27] and he does it makes him and the world
[40:30] that we cannot see our five senses
[40:32] doesn't contact but Jesus is here
[40:34] present if we could just get conscious
[40:39] of that
[40:41] I like what he says here he said
[40:44] remember not only here talking about in
[40:46] the church
[40:48] so many times we want to come say well
[40:49] I'm going to worship service I'm going
[40:51] to church I'm going to Worship the Lord
[40:55] now it's more than just coming to church
[40:58] to Worship the Lord
[41:00] he says these are these angels are
[41:02] camped about you all the time whether
[41:03] you're walking down the street
[41:05] he says and wherever you are you that
[41:07] profess to be Believers and fear the
[41:09] lord angels of God are moving with you
[41:11] wherever you are he said they watch
[41:15] everything you do
[41:18] he said they watch everything you do and
[41:20] everything that goes through your mind
[41:21] they know all about you and you must be
[41:25] conscious
[41:26] of that
[41:29] if we're not conscious of it
[41:32] then you'll act any way
[41:37] you know most of the stupid things I've
[41:38] done in my life
[41:40] the stupid things I've said
[41:43] is when I didn't stop and look around
[41:45] and just think to myself
[41:49] I'm a Christian
[41:51] I'm a Believer
[41:53] you say what does that have to do with
[41:54] anything because if I'm a Believer the
[41:56] word just told me that angels are
[41:58] encamped about me and that God never
[42:00] leaves me
[42:02] he's never going to stray away from me
[42:04] and anywhere I go so if I always tell
[42:06] myself I'm a Believer I shouldn't say
[42:08] stupid things
[42:09] I shouldn't say silly things because I
[42:11] ought to be conscious of what's going on
[42:13] around me
[42:20] amen Christopher
[42:23] listen this that's the very objective of
[42:27] these meetings that's the objective my
[42:28] brethren of holding my Ministry out from
[42:30] the denominations he said is to try to
[42:32] let people see that still alive and he's
[42:36] here to every believer to every
[42:38] denomination that will believe him or
[42:40] people in those denominations the Lord
[42:42] is before me and David said I shall not
[42:45] be moved and what we need today is
[42:48] Believers that in this last day says I
[42:51] will not be moved I don't care what
[42:54] people say I don't care what people
[42:55] think of how I worship we need Believers
[42:58] that says I'm not ashamed to praise God
[43:01] when God is there to be praised
[43:03] [Music]
[43:09] then we'll see the movement of God
[43:13] then we'll see the manifestations of God
[43:17] because Jesus said that the father is
[43:19] looking for people who would worship Him
[43:20] in spirit and in truth
[43:24] you know you look out into the church
[43:26] World here
[43:27] when you say the spirit and Truth the
[43:30] church world has changed that to praise
[43:31] and worship
[43:33] that's what they call it now praise and
[43:36] worship
[43:38] and what do they do with
[43:40] praise and worship now I want you to
[43:43] notice we call it spirit and Truth they
[43:45] call it praise and worship
[43:48] and you look at the world of what has
[43:50] happened with these churches they call
[43:51] it praise and worship they look at that
[43:53] as their praise and worship service as a
[43:56] thermometer of how hot they are and how
[43:58] on fire they are for God
[44:03] louder the music
[44:05] paid musicians
[44:08] paid singers
[44:11] light shows
[44:17] hmm
[44:18] but the problem is a lot of times those
[44:21] things don't have a real relationship or
[44:23] a true meaning of worship really is
[44:29] let me tell you if you want to see a
[44:30] super fast growing Church
[44:32] all we've got to do is talk brother
[44:35] Byler into putting in a light show
[44:37] yes
[44:41] you want these benches full brother
[44:43] bottle we need you to hire about a sixty
[44:45] thousand dollar song leader that
[44:47] graduated from from Berkeley music
[44:52] yeah you say oh you're just saying that
[44:54] I can I can prove it to you
[44:56] I talked to a gentleman here a while
[44:57] back
[44:59] probably the largest numbered in in
[45:03] numbers Church in a neighboring County
[45:05] I'm not going to give too much because
[45:06] you're liable to figure it out
[45:09] I said uh how many people y'all running
[45:12] in here now on Sunday oh about 1200.
[45:16] I said man
[45:18] y'all how many services you all have
[45:20] this place don't seek oh we have to have
[45:21] three services thinking about going to
[45:23] four
[45:26] he said yeah when when we first started
[45:29] he's not the pastor he's one of the
[45:32] music music pastors they got seven
[45:35] pastors on staff
[45:38] music Pastor child's pastors young
[45:41] adults pastor
[45:43] it just goes on
[45:46] and I said uh and he said yeah when we
[45:48] started here
[45:50] it was about 300.
[45:53] and I got to think because I'm familiar
[45:54] with the situation uh you know I talk a
[45:57] little bit about I listen I listen I
[45:59] kind of poked the bear and listen you
[46:01] know
[46:02] and uh and so I come to find out that
[46:05] this church their numbers started
[46:07] growing
[46:08] when their music department grew
[46:11] their music department grew they puts
[46:13] paid people on staff now you're going to
[46:16] think I'm gonna I'm joking with you here
[46:18] they actually put in light show
[46:21] dim the lights in the congregation when
[46:24] the band comes out when the people come
[46:25] out on stage
[46:27] and this is where it's going to get you
[46:29] ground effects smoke
[46:34] fog machines
[46:42] in church
[46:45] but it grew in numbers
[46:47] it grew financially they've got huge
[46:49] buildings
[46:53] got fancy cars
[46:56] yeah
[46:58] why is that it's because people want to
[47:01] be entertained
[47:05] if you're here to be entertained you're
[47:07] in the wrong place
[47:10] because we're not here to entertain
[47:12] anybody
[47:14] we're not here to enter entertain but
[47:17] we're here to minister to the Lord we're
[47:19] here to Worship the Lord I don't care if
[47:22] you sing off key I'd prefer you be on
[47:24] key but if you can't do the best you can
[47:32] but the problem said we feel very safe
[47:35] and tucked in
[47:36] and we feel like uh the habits of man
[47:39] when they feel real safe he says they
[47:41] forget God
[47:44] they're safe in their entertaining
[47:46] environment
[47:47] there's another church in Tennessee
[47:49] right across the border
[47:52] they've done the same thing I know the
[47:54] guy
[47:55] that headed up the music department they
[47:58] didn't have that kind of music he's a
[48:00] musician he had inspiration to build the
[48:02] music department next thing you know
[48:04] it's a huge platform of professional
[48:06] style singers
[48:10] yeah
[48:12] the best instruments that money can buy
[48:16] and more you can't you you don't have
[48:18] they can't get enough seats in that
[48:19] place
[48:21] but my question is what did the preacher
[48:23] preach
[48:26] let me go step farther with that
[48:28] whenever we get into a place as
[48:31] Believers and we get into a place in our
[48:33] lives when we come to the church service
[48:35] and we leave here and we say man that
[48:38] guy can preach
[48:40] man that guy he could sing man he could
[48:43] sing he's the best worship leader I've
[48:45] ever heard of
[48:46] man I tell you what that's such a good
[48:49] environment in that church we're missing
[48:51] it
[48:53] because it's not about how the preacher
[48:56] preaches
[48:58] it's not about how the singers sing but
[49:01] it's about what God is doing in the
[49:03] lives of his believers
[49:05] I want people to leave here and say God
[49:07] moved for sister Becky last week
[49:10] not because she was playing the piano
[49:12] but because she had failed before him
[49:14] and she dedicated herself and she
[49:16] worshiped God and God answered a prayer
[49:18] in her life that's the testimonies we
[49:20] want to see leaving here it's not about
[49:22] how well we sing or how good we preach
[49:24] it's about what is God doing in his
[49:27] people
[49:29] he said but we are free Americans we do
[49:31] what we want
[49:32] he said their pleasure craze to mine is
[49:35] full of tummy rot
[49:38] because Americans we seek and want
[49:41] entertainment so so bad and we have to
[49:44] be careful that we don't get caught up
[49:46] in the culture of entertainment taking
[49:49] precedence over worship
[49:54] but we need worshipers to arise
[49:58] I told you this wasn't going to be a
[50:00] standard message like we would talk
[50:01] about worship and seeing in it
[50:04] televisions and
[50:06] televisions and Hell phones and
[50:09] you know that's that's that's a that's a
[50:11] toothache to Satan
[50:13] that's nothing
[50:15] we need worshipers
[50:18] people want to take worship and say that
[50:19] people would worship this or that or the
[50:21] other I'm not talking about the things
[50:23] out there that can become Idols to us
[50:25] I'm talking about a relationship between
[50:27] you and God
[50:30] turn with me if you would to Ezekiel
[50:34] we have to be careful of this
[50:36] entertainment world because Satan is the
[50:38] master of entertainment
[50:41] and if you'll look with me here in
[50:43] Ezekiel 28 I think I said the wrong
[50:45] verse 28 or chapter 28 is where we're
[50:48] going
[50:49] you will look here let's read this
[50:52] and you ask how did Satan get into the
[50:54] place that he is so good at captivating
[50:56] people
[50:58] for entertainment how did he get and so
[51:00] so lifted up and such such a good
[51:02] Entertainer because you know we're it's
[51:04] easy for us as Americans This is
[51:06] somebody to dangle something in front of
[51:07] us and we just start following
[51:09] oh boy there's a new there's a new
[51:11] Instagram there's a
[51:16] just dangle in front of us we're just
[51:17] like a horse with a carrot
[51:21] and we begin to follow this stuff around
[51:23] why because Satan is an Entertainer
[51:26] And We crave entertainment
[51:30] Ezekiel 28 moreover the word of the Lord
[51:33] came unto me saying son of man
[51:37] take up a lamentation upon the king of
[51:40] Tyrus and say unto him thus saith the
[51:42] Lord God thou seal us up the sum full of
[51:45] wisdom perfect in Beauty
[51:48] thou has been in Eden the Garden of God
[51:51] every precious stone thy covering
[51:53] sardius topaz Diamond Barrel Onyx Jasper
[51:57] Sapphire Emerald carbuncle and gold the
[52:00] worksmanship of the tablets and of the
[52:03] pipes was prepared in the
[52:05] the day that thou was created
[52:09] Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[52:11] covered and I set I've set thee so thou
[52:15] was upon the holy mountain of God thou
[52:17] Hast walked up and down in the midst of
[52:19] the stones of fire thou was perfect and
[52:23] thy ways from the day thou was created
[52:26] two iniquity found
[52:30] you say what does this have to do
[52:32] brother and sister this is talking about
[52:34] Satan
[52:35] this scripture is a direct reflection of
[52:39] Satan he's not talking to the king of
[52:40] Tyrus
[52:41] he's comparing into what Satan did so
[52:44] look at this and break it down he said
[52:45] you were sealed of perfection full of
[52:48] wisdom and beauty and perfect so we read
[52:51] it immediately realized this is not a
[52:53] human being he's talking about
[52:55] because this guy was in enthroned in
[52:58] Perfection and beauty and wisdom
[53:01] so here we have probably the most
[53:03] graphic illustration of Satan
[53:06] the entire Bible and many times it's
[53:08] overlooked
[53:10] watch what he says he said you were
[53:12] still a perfection
[53:15] so what does a seal mean anybody who has
[53:18] a seal has Authority
[53:21] if you've got a seal you have authority
[53:23] and you have authenticity
[53:25] this is my seal
[53:28] you know they would have Insignia Rings
[53:29] back in the old days that they would dip
[53:31] in they would put waxing and dip and
[53:33] they'd stick their seal in it and
[53:35] basically what this is saying is God was
[53:37] telling him this person that he's
[53:39] talking about which we know was Lucifer
[53:42] at the very right hand of God he had the
[53:46] Seal of God
[53:48] you were sealed in Perfection I made you
[53:51] a deputy to sign my documents
[53:55] you realize that
[53:58] I make you a deputy to seal my documents
[54:02] so you were in Eden in the garden of God
[54:05] that's not the king of Tyree
[54:08] you were in my garden so there was no
[54:11] human beings there at the time other
[54:12] than Adam and Eve
[54:14] and they were created
[54:16] so he couldn't have been this King
[54:18] so who else was in Eden
[54:21] that old serpent
[54:22] that old serpent
[54:25] so we began to look at this and we see
[54:27] Satan here in Ezekiel 28 it tells him
[54:29] he's Perfection he's wisdom he's Beauty
[54:32] and every precious stone was his
[54:34] covering
[54:36] you say what does that have to do with
[54:37] anything
[54:38] well you think about the children of
[54:39] Israel they had 12 Stones that made up
[54:42] the tablet of their breastplate
[54:44] this was royalty this was priesthood
[54:48] and Satan in God's presence
[54:52] Lucifer
[54:54] before he fell he owned these nine
[54:57] stones that was mentioned here in the
[54:58] Bible it says they were in God so no
[55:00] doubt he wore some kind of tablet more
[55:02] than likely of showing priesthood and he
[55:06] wore a ring of Insignia that said I'm at
[55:09] God's right hand man
[55:13] this guy was close
[55:17] this fella was real close
[55:22] the worksmanship of your tablets and
[55:25] pipes was prepared for you what's
[55:27] tablets
[55:28] Timbers
[55:30] like a tambourine
[55:32] and pipes
[55:34] to make what
[55:36] music
[55:38] what do we use music for
[55:40] entertainment
[55:42] worship
[55:44] so here when we look at this we have to
[55:46] be able to associate this Lucifer before
[55:49] the fall here he is the worship leader
[55:53] in heaven
[56:01] he is a professional Godly worship
[56:04] leader that stands at the very Throne of
[56:07] God and leads all the angels of heaven
[56:10] and saying holy holy holy
[56:15] praise you God praise you God
[56:19] he is the greatest worship leader that
[56:21] ever was in heaven
[56:26] and you know the rest of the story
[56:28] the fall
[56:31] and what happens when he fail did it
[56:33] change his characteristics
[56:35] no
[56:38] so you want to know why things are so
[56:40] hard to overcome why entertainment is so
[56:42] catchy why do we get trapped with
[56:44] entertainment
[56:46] why is it people would rather go to a
[56:48] church that's full of smoke and mirrors
[56:51] and lights and and loud and fancy music
[56:53] rather than go to a church that is
[56:55] preaching solid gospel word
[56:58] because they are grasping for the
[57:01] entertainment aspect because Satan has
[57:03] wrapped his claws into him and said Let
[57:05] Me Entertain You I Will amuse your
[57:08] spirit
[57:14] you say well I don't know about that I
[57:16] don't know if he could do that or not
[57:17] what's verse 15 say it said he was
[57:20] perfect in his ways from the day he was
[57:23] created till iniquity was found in him
[57:28] the perfect worshiper
[57:33] hello sisters
[57:35] Satan the perfect worship leader leading
[57:38] worship service around the very Throne
[57:40] of God
[57:41] professional
[57:46] do you know why we have to be so careful
[57:47] what our eyes see what our ears hear
[57:50] how we respond to things around us
[57:54] who's it coming from
[57:57] is it something that we should be uh uh
[58:00] amused by or is it something we should
[58:01] be giving worship back to
[58:04] that's a good question we ought to
[58:05] always ask ourselves because worship is
[58:07] not about what the way you feel
[58:13] worship is not about the way I feel
[58:16] because let me tell you there's many
[58:18] many many times that I have not wanted
[58:21] to even open my mouth to sing
[58:25] I didn't feel like it
[58:28] but I know in my heart God is worthy and
[58:32] desires praise from our lips
[58:36] it may not have been the best effort
[58:39] I may not you heard me in front of the
[58:41] bench in front of me
[58:44] but I opened my mouth I tried to make an
[58:46] effort
[58:49] you say well
[58:51] I I I don't I don't like to sing
[58:57] I'm not just talking about singing
[59:01] worship is so much more than just
[59:04] singing
[59:05] worship is is being able to draw to lay
[59:09] yourself down and fall before the Lord
[59:11] with your eyes closed and completely
[59:13] meditate and dedicate your thoughts and
[59:16] your intents to God and lift him up and
[59:18] worship him he wants to be lifted up and
[59:20] praised
[59:30] brother Bob we're gonna have to make
[59:31] this two-part series
[59:41] we think of biblical worship who are you
[59:43] often drawn to
[59:45] David
[59:47] had something special about his style of
[59:51] worship what was it so different about
[59:53] David that always stands out to us David
[59:56] had what passion
[59:58] David was passionate about God David
[1:00:01] cared about God he was full of passion
[1:00:03] he wasn't shallow and self-serving and
[1:00:06] say oh I don't know if I'm going to go
[1:00:08] because I don't know what I can get out
[1:00:09] of it
[1:00:12] David many many times you read and you
[1:00:14] look and he'll say Lord you delivered me
[1:00:17] from my enemies when I was at my lowest
[1:00:19] death when I was in my deepest pit Lord
[1:00:21] you were the one you were there I praise
[1:00:24] you God
[1:00:28] it's easy to praise God on a mountain
[1:00:30] it's easy to worship God on the mountain
[1:00:34] but let me ask you what it feels like
[1:00:35] when you're in the valley
[1:00:37] when your enemies are encamped all about
[1:00:40] you
[1:00:42] hmm
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:00:46] but David knew how to connect with God
[1:00:51] there was a connection there that he
[1:00:53] could look and he said no matter what
[1:00:55] betrays me no matter what comes around
[1:00:57] me no matter what Falls my way whether
[1:00:59] it's a whether it's a line whether it's
[1:01:01] a bear whether it's a giant
[1:01:03] whether it's a king that hates my guts
[1:01:06] my God is able
[1:01:09] I wonder if David ever feared a defeat
[1:01:14] because he had so much
[1:01:18] confidence and what fate I've never seen
[1:01:21] it
[1:01:24] why do we have to fear defeat we don't
[1:01:26] have to fear defeat we just need to
[1:01:28] worship God you know I had somebody make
[1:01:30] fun of me one time because I said praise
[1:01:31] God when you're in the valley he said I
[1:01:33] guess you're one of them it Praises God
[1:01:34] all the time good and bad I said yeah
[1:01:37] yeah I am it's not easy
[1:01:42] it's no fun when you're going through
[1:01:43] the valley when people sick around you
[1:01:45] or the death has just happened or you
[1:01:47] lose your job or Things Fall Apart
[1:01:50] but he's still my God
[1:01:52] he still provides my needs he's still
[1:01:55] going to take care of my family
[1:01:58] because when it all said and done you
[1:02:01] know what matters
[1:02:03] is if when that role was called
[1:02:05] if that Rapture takes place all that
[1:02:07] matters is that me and my family's there
[1:02:11] it doesn't matter what happens to me
[1:02:12] here no matter how bad it hurts
[1:02:15] and I know that's bold saying that I
[1:02:17] don't want bad on me or anybody else
[1:02:20] but life happens
[1:02:26] foreign
[1:02:27] but people come to church and they get
[1:02:28] bored
[1:02:30] it's I I don't want to ask don't raise
[1:02:33] your hands but how many has ever come
[1:02:35] and said man that was boring
[1:02:39] let me ask you did you come to worship
[1:02:43] did you come prepared
[1:02:46] did you come to worship did you come
[1:02:47] with anticipation and expectation or did
[1:02:49] you just come to another service just to
[1:02:51] be entertained say man I thought brother
[1:02:53] Byler was going to preach this morning
[1:02:54] but
[1:02:55] wasn't him
[1:02:59] at visiting minister
[1:03:03] I didn't get nothing out of service I
[1:03:04] couldn't even tell you what he preached
[1:03:05] on
[1:03:11] we get bored we get confidence in people
[1:03:16] there's a little boy
[1:03:17] riding in the car with his mother
[1:03:20] and they were just going down talking
[1:03:22] having a good time talking and
[1:03:24] they were going little boys looked at
[1:03:26] his mom and said Mom how high have you
[1:03:28] ever counted
[1:03:30] and she thought for a minute she said
[1:03:32] well really I just don't even remember
[1:03:34] counting because I just don't count for
[1:03:37] no reason
[1:03:38] and she said well
[1:03:39] do you count how high have you counted
[1:03:41] he said oh sure mom I've counted well
[1:03:44] what's the highest you've ever counted
[1:03:46] 8 397.
[1:03:50] she said hey
[1:03:53] a thousand
[1:03:54] three of you remember that number he
[1:03:56] said that's easy that's when church was
[1:03:57] over
[1:04:04] it's what you make of it
[1:04:06] it's your expectations
[1:04:09] another little boy come in he was with
[1:04:10] his dad who was a preacher
[1:04:12] and the preacher him and his little son
[1:04:14] come into the church and they walked in
[1:04:16] the back door he was the visiting
[1:04:17] Minister and he seen a box on the table
[1:04:19] back there and it said all it said was
[1:04:20] alms
[1:04:22] so the preacher pulled his billfold out
[1:04:23] and put a 20 bill in there
[1:04:26] the guy get up and preached delivered an
[1:04:28] awesome message
[1:04:30] walks out and the trustee goes over and
[1:04:34] says brother I got something for you and
[1:04:36] he he opens up the little box that says
[1:04:38] alms and he said when preachers come
[1:04:40] through we just give them whatever's in
[1:04:42] the Box
[1:04:43] and he hand him a 20 bill
[1:04:46] he said thank you I appreciate it he
[1:04:48] said we appreciate the message
[1:04:49] they got in the car and a little boy
[1:04:51] said Dad if we'd have put more in we'd
[1:04:53] have got more out
[1:05:04] but God
[1:05:06] if we would just give more to God
[1:05:09] give more praise more adoration more
[1:05:12] love and this has been going on and you
[1:05:14] can see it from the beginning of time
[1:05:16] and I'm gonna have to find a place to
[1:05:17] close here but I find it in Job chapter
[1:05:21] 38 when job is there and he's he's going
[1:05:23] through and he's telling God about all
[1:05:24] of his stuff and God looks at him and he
[1:05:26] says where were you when I lay the
[1:05:27] foundation
[1:05:29] where were you when I laid the
[1:05:31] foundation he said tell me if you know
[1:05:33] so much job who determined the
[1:05:35] dimensions of this place
[1:05:38] what supports its foundations
[1:05:41] yeah who laid the Cornerstone and what's
[1:05:43] it say next the morning Stars sang
[1:05:45] together and all the Angels shattered
[1:05:46] for joy so think about that when God was
[1:05:50] there creating and he said let there be
[1:05:51] light praise the Lord Angels everywhere
[1:05:55] begin to sing and shout
[1:05:58] Let There Be Water Let There Be animals
[1:06:01] let there be this let there be that when
[1:06:04] I lay the foundation of this very World
[1:06:06] Angels begin to worship and sing and
[1:06:08] praise because they knew I was the
[1:06:10] almighty God
[1:06:13] crazy
[1:06:21] real quick and we're gonna we're gonna
[1:06:23] get shut this down we'll pick the others
[1:06:26] up some other time
[1:06:30] you know the story about uh Jesus in
[1:06:33] chapter in John chapter four
[1:06:35] and he's the woman at the well he goes
[1:06:37] up you just rehearsing the story he
[1:06:39] knows story he goes up to her and he's
[1:06:41] talking to her trying to
[1:06:43] pick her mind a little bit and and
[1:06:45] trying to talk about a drink of water
[1:06:47] and she says you don't even have a
[1:06:48] picture and so forth you know the story
[1:06:50] and the woman comes to him and the woman
[1:06:52] says sir I perceive thou are a prophet
[1:06:57] watch the conversation
[1:06:59] she says I'm fathers worshiped in this
[1:07:02] mountain
[1:07:05] and he say that Jerusalem is a place
[1:07:07] that men ought to worship
[1:07:10] so here we are Sumerians the Samaritans
[1:07:12] they worship one way the Jews over
[1:07:15] Jerusalem they're Worship in a separate
[1:07:17] way we've got our two different beliefs
[1:07:19] here you're a prophet so tell me
[1:07:22] if you were if we worship this way and
[1:07:24] you worship that way and Jesus said unto
[1:07:26] a woman
[1:07:27] believe me the hour cometh when ye shall
[1:07:30] miss Mountain
[1:07:32] or in the mountain of Jerusalem worship
[1:07:35] the father
[1:07:36] ye worship ye know not what
[1:07:39] we know what we worship for salvation is
[1:07:42] of the Jews but the hour cometh
[1:07:48] you're with me the hour cometh and now
[1:07:51] is when the true worshiper shall worship
[1:07:54] the father in spirit and in truth for
[1:07:58] the father seeketh such to worship him
[1:08:00] for God is a spirit and they that
[1:08:02] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[1:08:04] and in truth
[1:08:06] yeah
[1:08:08] it wasn't it didn't matter if you
[1:08:09] worshiped God up over the hills of
[1:08:10] Samaria it didn't matter anymore if you
[1:08:13] worship God over here in the mountains
[1:08:15] of Jerusalem those were just places
[1:08:17] eating like Tabernacle is just a place
[1:08:21] Happy Valley Church of Christ is just a
[1:08:23] place Cloverdale it's just a place
[1:08:26] what matters to God is the hour that is
[1:08:29] now upon us when you leave this place
[1:08:31] you're still worshiping you're still
[1:08:34] given to God it's not about coming to
[1:08:36] this building
[1:08:38] thank you
[1:08:44] and what we have to be careful of as I
[1:08:47] close now
[1:08:48] is
[1:08:50] it's a second
[1:08:52] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:08:54] God
[1:08:57] we can't find ourselves in a place
[1:09:01] self
[1:09:03] my whole Christian experience my whole
[1:09:06] life on a day-to-day basis
[1:09:08] is about what I can do for God
[1:09:13] and I have come to realize in my life
[1:09:15] I'm too busy
[1:09:18] I'm going to be honest
[1:09:20] and you be honest
[1:09:23] I put things in front
[1:09:26] priorities sometimes get wrong
[1:09:29] I get too busy I get in too big of a
[1:09:31] hurry
[1:09:32] I'm going here I'm going there
[1:09:35] when my number one priority
[1:09:40] is what does God want me to do
[1:09:45] what does God expect of me when I cross
[1:09:48] over that day I want him to look at me
[1:09:50] and
[1:09:52] say Well done my good and faithful
[1:09:53] servant I don't want him to say man you
[1:09:55] tried to make a lot of money
[1:09:58] man you really cater to all the people
[1:10:00] around you
[1:10:02] man you took real good care of your
[1:10:03] boss's business
[1:10:07] because I don't want to disappoint my
[1:10:08] boss
[1:10:10] there's one boss I can't disappoint
[1:10:13] that's the one I'm worried about
[1:10:16] so we're going to age that we need to
[1:10:19] let the worshipers arise
[1:10:22] let's stand our feet
[1:10:30] for the Josh musicians if you come
[1:10:37] like I said this was no way and to scold
[1:10:39] anybody
[1:10:41] we all are human we like fun
[1:10:45] just make sure fun don't become
[1:10:47] entertainment overtaken worship
[1:10:52] and I've been guilty before but ask
[1:10:54] yourself
[1:10:56] you know it's church night
[1:11:00] um
