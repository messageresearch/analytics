========================================

yes wow so you [Music] wow foreign so uh foreign [Music] so morning god is good isn't he amen good to see everybody out this morning uh we just want to read brother john's list and announcements and so forth before we get started if that's okay amen one week and then we're going to have some meetings how many is ready for the meetings amen some special meetings i don't guess we're going to have a big crowd it don't look like this year so i know times it's always changing but we'll just have to wait and see i know that in the last week or even a lot of times a lot of kids they make up their mind up on friday whether they're gonna come or not so but brother john's got wrote down here that he's only got 16 kids at this time so that's not a whole lot amen but anyway so that's okay it may be a light load for us i guess but i think more will come hopefully anyway so i think but john said instead of having a meeting he just wants to read this off and so now i want to say that of course we know wednesday night service but we can use quite a bit of helpers around here especially for the outside and getting things ready uh the sisters or whatever cleaning the fellowship hall and get everything up the purr uh so many hands make light work amen and that's for wednesday night okay wednesday night we plan on and having a little work time of getting everything ready for friday um so friday night it says here meal will be provided by the hallbeggers we sure appreciate them doing that this year i know it'll be a job for them but uh we sure always enjoy them doing that may god bless them for that amen and then saturday lunch brother byler is grilling amen so i guess i'll be grilling saturday amen for lunch uh and of course i don't have the times here i guess that would be on another page where we start on what time we start and all on saturday of course friday night service is seven right and then saturday night service 5 30 okay and that's on the paper also if anybody wonders friday night brother john will take a showing of hands of how many is going to be there saturday night maybe because it's a little early to tell yet we'll see how many kids are here and everything more more or less you know friday night so that we can order the pizzas for saturday night and then uh sunday be barbecue meal provided a guest says sisters on sunday bring desserts right bring desserts everyone needs to bring two liters little debbies and the individual chip bags all right sisters are asked to please bring a dessert for sunday and as always we need volunteers to clean up after each meal now do you have a sign up sheet back there all right so he's got a sign up sheet back there for clean up and so forth so everybody take a look at that and see what you can do amen praise the lord all right i can't think of anything else amen so praise the lord if you will stand with me this morning amen stay with me and we'll just go before the lord in prayer amen any special need you want to raise your hand this morning lord jesus we come before you father once again lord jesus before your throne of grace lord jesus and into your presence lord jesus uh and father we just ask and believe lord that each one that has brought a leak of the fire of the holy ghost this morning lord lord it just all comes together makes for a great atmosphere lord jesus that you can come down in a special way and speak to every heart lord you know where every heart is you know what what we have need of this morning lord jesus and we ask god that you just speak through brother danny this morning lord jesus and meet our needs lord jesus you know what we have neither father you're still the discerner of the thoughts the intents of the heart and you know what we have need of our father we ask god also for these meetings come lord next weekend we pray god that lord above everything else lord jesus that you would bless it lord jesus that you bless brother luke with the messages that we have need of and the young people no doubt just uniquely god will come father and you know each one that will have a need and each one that needs a closer walk with you father we ask god that you would just bless those meetings in a special way we thank you father for this opportunity to be able to come on this beautiful day that you have given us lord to worship you in spirit and in truth lord and we ask god that you'd open all of our hearts support jesus series jesus to receive from you what you have for us this morning we ask it in jesus name amen and amen you can be dismissed for sunday school amen brother troy if you want to come we're going the psalms this morning that's horm's 86. we'll read this uh whole chapter here psalms 86. bow down thine hero lord hear me for for i am poor and needy be merciful unto me o lord for i cry unto thee daily thou lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon me in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee for that would answer me [Music] all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee glorify thy name teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name regret is thy mercy toward me and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell thou o but thou o lord or a god full of compassion and gracious longsuffering and plentiness and mercy and truth this one together show me a token for good that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed because thou lord has helped me and comforted me god bless you may be seated the brian got called out on the call so i figured we'd read here in the scriptures you want to go with me to galatians galatians chapter one and this is paul and we'll read a couple of these here verses paul an apostle not of men neither by men but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia grace be unto you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father to him be glory forever and ever amen and marvel that you are soon removed from him that called you unto the grace of christ unto another gospel and this is kind of what i was hit on this morning but uh tommy had a bible study going over there and it kind of well he invites lots of people and and so there's kind of a mixed multitude there and so they pick a topic a different topic every week to try to focus on and one of the the other brothers there he he said that the topic should be discernment in prophecy and so up to this point we just kind of go along reading the word and focusing uh you know on the scriptures and then how it went uh one the last monday night actually is out but uh so it's hard to go into uh discernment and prophecy without bringing up what happened in our day with with brother branham so we kind of were feeling our way into it and uh so the topic of brother branham we we tried to tell him that god sent a prophet in this day to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and it didn't go very good at all so it went pretty rough and uh and it was going pretty rough sit for several days there because but really what it comes down to is if god don't open their eyes they won't ever see it just like i can never see like they see i can never go back and see what how they see it now they can't see how i see it or how we see it unless god opens their eyes so we don't preach another gospel than what paul preached uh brother branham said that he doesn't preach another gospel he preaches exactly what paul preached so paul goes on here in the seventh verse to say which is not another move from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel paul says which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ and that's where we are a lot in today's day they've taken the gospel of christ and they perverted it into their own thinking or their own way but though we and then paul says but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then ye have received let him be a curse so paul's laying it down real thick here telling the people if anybody comes and preaches anything else then whatever pretty preach to you let him be a curse for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ but i certify you brethren that the angel which was pre or that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for neither received it of man neither i was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ and and so i guess the thought came that how blessed we are to have our eyes open and are able to see because just like you can take them to scripture after scripture after scripture and they'll and on many different things on many different doctrines water baptism lots of different ones the the women preachers the cutting of the hair the dress the serpency all these different topics they won't see it you can take them to scripture then you they say well you can take them to another scripture well and on and on it goes and then you know they i this i think they look at us they say well they're a little weird because they believe you know that god sent a prophet well my thought is they're a little weird because because they're they're expecting that it god all through the bible send prophets to straighten things out but here in the last day the most confusion of all days they think they're smart enough and rich enough that they don't need nobody to sort them out with with just 10 different people or five different people at a table you have five different interpretations of the same words so yeah we needed a prophet to straighten the situation now and he did straighten it down he didn't add nothing to nor did he take nothing away and he did give it to us straight so it does hurt sometimes but i'd rather have it straight and get it straight here than have to worry about it over on the other side so it's just uh so uh i guess pray for us because hopefully it was called off because of all the stuff that was said but maybe they have it another at least another monday night so try not to be too pushy or strong just like said it's it's got to be god that reveals it because just as loud just what the rich man jesus had the parable or that story of the rich man actually story of the rich man where he said he lifted up his eyes in hell he said for well could you please send someone back one from the dead could you send lazarus back from the dead and abraham said they have moses and the prophets he said if one was raised from the dead they still wouldn't see it and you can you can see that because jesus was there doing the things that what the scriptures said he would do and they couldn't see it jesus came today in the same way i just heard brother i'm saying doing the same exact things that was done when jesus walked the earth and the eyes were still closed they couldn't see it the one i just heard him say the one brother said i don't care how many people you raised from the dead i won't believe it he said well it wasn't for you you're not a believer you're an unbeliever but it's just a little thankfulness of the lord opening our eyes and letting us see what he's done in our day and uh i hope it didn't take too much time but uh that's just the thought that i had this morning what a privileged people we are to have the eye sap that god put on our eyes that we could see what we see because if you can't see it you just can't see it but once you do see it you can't unsee it so praise the lord video amen let's sing that little course i was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the lord this morning well i was glad when they said unto me oh i was glad when they said unto me oh i was glad when they said unto me [Applause] oh let us go to the house they'll be singing oh they'll be singing in the [Music] of the lord they'll be preaching this morning where they'll be preaching in the house [Music] reaching in the house [Music] but i was glad when they said unto me yes oh i was glad when they said unto me [Music] well i was glad when they said unto me oh let us go to the house they'll be shouting oh they'll be shouting in the house of the lord oh they'll be shouting in the house of the oh they'll lord shouting in the house of the lord oh let us go to the house i was glad one more time well i was glad when they said unto me oh i was glad when they said unto me oh i was glad when they said unto me well let us go to the house of the lord amen you glad this morning hey amen amen god is good isn't he amen god bless you this morning you may be seated we welcome each and everyone out this morning i don't see any visitors this morning and looks like all home folks and we got several out this morning but pray that god will be with them and have several that is not feeling well this morning and just want to hold them up in prayer amen listen that song on page 137 there is power in the blood this

this morning once again oh there is power power [Music] working [Music] amen so thankful for his power this morning amen man you know god's grace is awesome once you realize his grace in your heart and life you'll never be the same again you man i tell you you have a even on a bad day it's still a good day because jesus is with you you man you know i i just i sometimes i wonder how people in the world get through all their troubles and their trials and you know we just take our burdens to the lord and we leave them there we just give them to him because you know if you can't fix it there ain't no sense worrying about it and you know i said a little thing the other day he says why worry about it when you can pray about it i thought that's pretty good because you know instead of complaining a lot of times we do but if we'll just take it to the lord in prayer he makes a difference don't he amen this song come on my heart i know it's an old song and we sing it quite often but i thought you know lord that's what we've come this morning is to come and dine this morning and you know billy troy was speaking you know they kind of think we're nuts and we are but brother branham said without a nut he said the bolts everything falls apart he said then all you got's a bunch of junk but i'm glad that we're a nut this morning aren't you and amen and i want to feed this morning and not from brother danny but from the holy spirit this morning that god will just speak to our hearts this morning amen well jesus has a table spread where the saints of god are fed he invites his chosen people commandant yes with man a heat of feet and supplies your every need oh this sweetness up with you just another time well commander the master [Music] turn the water into wine to the hungry call of mouth come and dine and the disciples came to land thus obeying christ's command for the master called to them oh commander and there they found her bread and thief on the fire thus he

going through yes i'm going through and i'll pay the price whatever others do and i'll take the way with the lord who bless you well i've started with jesus and i'm going through well i'd rather walk

second peter turn to second peter chapter one then we'll read verses 3 to 10. according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in this world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue divert your knowledge into knowledge temperance into temperance patience into patience godliness into godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly and kindness charity and if these things be in you and and abound that they make you that that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind you cannot see it far off and have forgotten that sin he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things you shall never follow and that's what i want to speak on on this morning may god has blessing to read a word you can be seated to be certain in an uncertain age where this this age is so uncertain that the bible says that everyone would be deceived except the very elect if it was possible the elect would be deceived but it's not but see that's that's this age that we're living in so uncertain that they don't have a firm foundation they don't have anywhere that they stand they don't know where they stand people that are agnostic just like i don't know there might be a god you know i'm not really sure i don't really they don't they don't really stand anywhere they're like they're like that that house that was built on on the sand that gets washed away and see uh this first uh i just pulled this up earlier i got my phone according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another build it there upon thereon but let every man take heed how he build it there upon for other foundation can no man lay that is laid which is jesus christ amen and here uh let's see what i was talking to my friend at the uh well i have a friend from the gym uh his name is chris we talked a while back about many things he he told me he doesn't he he doesn't know if he's going to heaven or hell he's he's a christian he's been baptized he's spoken in tongues he he he he doesn't know where he he's going he said he said i'm not sure i i feel like i'm in i'm going the wrong direction like what what am i missing and what i told him i i didn't feel he was ready to know about the message and all that i because he didn't have his abcs right just like what brother branham says how are they supposed to learn algebra if they don't know their abcs but i told him and that until he gets the holy ghost he'll always feel that way because he's always always living in a sinful condition see i tried well i told him how he can get the baptism the holy ghost but well i did i didn't offer like i asked him to if you want to go to my church and well he he would like to but he he really can't unless i take him and i'd have to pick him up and stuff and and maybe he might come here sometime i don't know but you know i try to get uh people to go here if i can you know and but it is quite far away from where we're at and most people don't want to drive that far so but but that kind of hit me because he's like 17 years old back when i was as younger and i was i didn't know i didn't know i was always in a constant place of uncertainty where i didn't know where i was going and i was in a place where where i thought i could well i didn't know if i was going to make the rapture or that that's for sure that's the one thing i was always really uncertain about i was i even had uh i i thought i was uh just before the rapture happens i'm going to repent i thought i always had to like have things um amended and get everything sort out i didn't i obviously didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost in that time and and i was always trying to get things things together myself i can't do this i can't do that and then i kept falling and falling and falling and kept trying to trying to get back up up again and trying to say you know i was in a in a cycle um which i believe a lot of people are in today is a sin cycle where you sin one day and then in your pain and the next day you stand on your every plan that night the same cycle over and over and over again rep repeating the repetitive sin every single day and then thinking well no uh i always thought well at the end of the day after i repent from all that now i'm good to go and i'm gonna go to heaven and then and i'm just going to uh repent just before i die and i'm going to be okay death repentance kind of thing a lot of people have today people have i can live with the way i want but when i i'm deathbed that's why i'm going to repent i'm going to make everything all right and and and it's i even had a a plan that well the rapture happens i'm going to since i know america is going to burn i'm going to have a little plan i'm going to um steal a car i'm going to run run out of united states and go somewhere like israel or something and i was going to somehow i had this idea that i could do that when i was like 14 years old i had it all figured out if if if this happens then i'll i'll be okay because i escape the country now i'm not in the country it's gonna burn but but that's how it is we we need to have a we need to be certain know where you are headed know where you stand that's that's another thing i really gotta get out here here today gotta hear what brother branham said it it said here if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who can prepare himself for battle paul speaking here of course he was speaking to these corinthians and many of them were soldiers in those days in in their own army now now the the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself you've got to have the certainty of anything we got to know whether it's right or not and now we're living in a day of great uncertainty we all know that the day of uncertainty and the time of uncertainty i don't i don't believe there there ever was a time since time first began in the garden of eden when sin come in and broke eternity into time i do not believe there's ever been a space of time with so much uncertainty as today because there there's not even one hope left in the natural world today now you say well i've seen times i read in history when the wars covered the earth that is that is true but never time when the whole earth would be blown to pieces just in one second see and such a destruction it'd take weeks and hours and so forth now it it takes one minute maybe not that just a button press and she's all over it's awful and they don't have uh cuba can and do it herself it it don't have to be you don't have to a little bitty uh hades could do it just any little nation that that wants to can can set the world completely on fire blow her out of her orbit any time they want see it only takes one fanatic which there's tens of billions of them around the world to do that and and this was brother branham said this in 1960 how much more so is that today and how much more uncertain it is it today these times that we're living and we're seeing everything that's going on it's so so uncertain you you better be a certain about where you're going because as in this day it could it could be the next minute next hour tomorrow uh we don't know uh when and it's going these things are going to start happening and i believe it's going to happen just like that and you're going it's going to be like um a thing that just has come upon us and you didn't even know what happened it it's gonna happen in the blink of an eye the rapture is gonna take place and the bride's gonna be gone and in these times you must be certain you must know where you stand as a believer you absolutely have to get that uh down you you can't and just keep going on hang on and living a life of well i don't know admit maybe this and that also stand on um know what you believe there's many believers even in the message that do not know what they believe not fully know what they believe at least they say well i believe the message okay do you believe um in the serpency that that's like the deepest thing ever i've i've i know oh people that and i've spoken and to people well there's one person that won't say who it is she didn't believe the um the serpent see and that that's a part of the message see i believe the whole message but i don't believe that part i've heard that before and the same the same thing with today well i believe the whole i believe this bible yeah but that you know that part was inspired you know saying what what um brother brandon and um said was uh he well he was uninspired or whatever he just kind of an idea that you know but know what you believe and stand on it no and that that's why i i um i believe us as believers shouldn't just go here here to to church but do your own research do your own study of of the bible and of the church age book as well because if you just is always going to church and never actually doing your own research your own starting your own uh own like even listening to brother branham there's a lot of message believers that just go to church and and that's where they get their whole message from and then the rest of the week and they say well i put god first okay you put god first but uh but then they don't put god in every aspect of their life and and it's like not revolving around their job everything there like this thing where it's separation of church and state or well i got my church life here and then the the rest of my a life i i have to myself and i do whatever i want to do and no that's not that's not where we need to be this morning we need to know what we believe know where we stand and and actually look for a greater understanding of the word a greater understanding of this message the message of this hour and instead of just relying on the preacher to tell you and to show you a new a new revolution and revealing new things that god is revealing to to this bride and if you if you just sit back and expect uh to only get a message from from the service every service and and then that's it you got to be more certain than that these are uncertain times don't don't just rely on on going within just doing your duty and and just saying i go to church every sunday every wednesday that's good enough it's not it's a time of uncertainty we have to be certain know where we're going amen aaron um what uh brother branham said here uh see well actually it's it's a spirit that that gets on on people that and they get content with what they know i i know enough to get by in this day there seems to be a lot of complacency people don't want to learn things but just want to be reminded of the things they already know which we need reminded of things of course we do that that's a part of it it's a part of it but if you're never on a if you never really getting greater understanding of things then you're not progressing you're just staying in the same place you're at and then you're going back a little bit oh let me get back to my place where i was because i get reminded of where where you get reminded and you just go back to the same place and then you back up a little bit and then go back to the same place again do you get what i'm saying yeah it's it's people are content with what they they know it it was it was this way when brother branham was here in in jesus time and today you can teach us uh you you can teach us where you can't teach us we're happy with what we know like the pharisees say oh we have the uh what we got the the old testament we don't need anything new come on now we we got all this and they put a period behind what they believed i believe in this time there are many people not just in the late odyssey and church but also message believers that are content with what they know and don't seek for a better understanding even some that that don't believe the whole message because of their personal beliefs that's how it is in this day and and we can't get to this place of complacency and like um what what jesus was saying to the laodicean church that they they they say they they lack nothing but yet are blind and and all this and that and and that's how how we can get that way if we don't if we don't don't seek for a better understanding [Music] we're just simply happy with what we know and not actually seeking a new um new revelation and from this word if you're not seeking something from god something new that then you'll always say is stay in the same place where and where you're at and i believe that the bride will know and will will know all the the secrets and that that's what the bible says is all that every secret will be made and known unto the bride every secret it and uh every single secret that that god has will be a known and it says here in uh let's see uh it's in revelations 10 in first wait let's see revelations 10. okay um but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when and he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished and he that as he had declared to the servants the prophets see the mystery of god shall be finished and and so so god has revealed all the secrets of of of the bible to his bride all the secrets and that man that made me start thinking what about what about the day or the hour that will be a revealed when when the the um churches will be shut down we'll and that that's when we'll be like okay here it is now now is the time when the when the uh when all message churches are shut down you happen and they're they're told you have to come into this new new order of things you have to uh you have to compromise on your doctrine you have to to forget about the the doctrine that you you know you have to compromise on that you have to be like well you know agree with what we say otherwise you you can't open up your churches when they do that we know that that the the raptures is is at hand and and it could it happened just like that and and and all of a sudden and there it is right in front of us but are we certain of the place where where we stand are you certain of the place where you stand that the never failing god never that this was a book i was reading the never failing never failing god never fails to deliver more revelation to those who want more the bride can never stop wanting to know more about the word because to her it is the very essence of her lovely lord in the early days of our message soon after our prophet it was god when a denominational person became a message comfort they wholly surrendered their past doctrine and embraced the greater revelation of the word if anyone is holding on to the doctrine from from the baptist church anything like that there you go you cannot be a baptist and a message believer at the same time you cannot be pentecostal and a message believer at the same time you you've got to you can't be in the middle you've got to be somewhere and stand firm and and say you can't be like well i believe the message but you know um this kind of you know doesn't make sense get a better understanding of it do research read the church age book and find it find out the the truth don't just stand in the middle and say well um the baptist taught me this and well i kind of you know it makes sense but the message also makes sense let me just stay in the middle better be careful can't be doing that know where you stand it it was a wonderful full time to see the power of the revealed word leading them as as in every church age before these same converts soon settle down into certain traditional teachings when hearts close god cannot lead then that next quote sums up most medicine message people so very well the the attitude of this age is exactly what it was then people have it all they know it all they cannot be taught if a point of truth from the word comes up and a man tries to explain his view to one with an opposing view the listener is not at all listening that he might learn but is listening only to a few what is being said [Applause] i mean that is exactly right [Applause] this is what the church agent said page 348. we gotta we gotta be careful now now if if you're you're holding on to something i think that um you were taught from the denominational thing that was a little bit contrary to what uh to this message you're not believing the whole message and and therefore you're you're missing the mark in in a way and and and you have to stay with it's exactly what the word and and brother branham had the revealed word of this day he had the revelation of of the this this bible is the revelation and just like um it said it at um just like he says is here as he had declared to the servants the prophets god shows these things to his prophets the revelation of this word and so if you go on and say well i think this and i think that that's contrary to that then then you and that's a very dangerous place to be stay with the word and and stay with with the message and and stop trying to get in a place where it's you're in between and you don't you're like well i don't know and i don't know know where you stand never be in a place where i don't know if i'm gonna make the rapture don't be in the place where you think hey i don't i'm not sure if you're not sure then you better get your you better you you better get into a place of certainty other wise you'll be with the rest of the world in a place of uncertainty i do not know where i stand whether where they say i don't know if i'm i'm a man or a woman and and they get they go so far into uncertainty that people are like that now and and we cannot be in a place of uncertainty now is the time to be certain and stay away with this word exactly what they're not not going on a uh like i was as a when i was younger or like i don't know where i say i don't know if i'm going to have their health and what really woke me up was a time when when when i believed that i was supposed to to die and when i thought i was going i should have died at that time and that woke me up and it made me realize i should i shouldn't know where i stand i don't know i didn't know if i was going to go to heaven or if i i was going to go to hell that's a bad place to be in and sometimes god has to do that to us plus in a place of where where we almost die or something like that to get to wake us up to tell us to tell us you better know where you're going you better know where you stand because if you don't know where you stand then then you're like that foolish man who built his house up upon the sand because he doesn't know where he stands uh when we get in in a place of certainty in in jesus christ and we know where we stand and we stand upon that word and upon this word and we say you can say i know where i'm going then you're you're exactly where he's supposed to be but where now is the time to be certain and know where you are going it is vital to be certain and to know where you're going and not not be so worried about where you're going if you're worried worrying well i don't know if i'll make the rapture then you better you better make something right you better get on your knees and make it right with god because you got to be certain in these times and um well now this is another conversation we had where um this is uh at some point i was talking to him you know that uh chris i was talking to him about how messed up this world is especially with the lgbtq new stuff community how they're told some people are born gay even kids told this you want to know something i've i've actually seen that there there's a little kids video that they actually show them in schools and stuff about um this gay pride parade uh an anime little thing and and and it's just a song about uh how how um those two two people two women and together going absolutely i was i was like this is so messed up these are little kids they're like from kindergarten they show these things too and it's horrible little little kids that are trying to brainwash little kids are told and told this to get get them wondering well maybe i might be gay and then they start thinking about this over time and and come to a false realization it's true it's a false realization just because they they put it in their minds to get them to start thinking well i might be uh you know they start they're looking at the other people differently and stuff and and because they think well maybe i am and he told and told and after i said that that um he he told me he has a relative that that is gay and said that that people do what makes them happy i i responded by saying doing what makes you happy sometimes has consequences like if someone said well cake makes me happy and they cake every single day they might be okay for a few years there's maybe but down the road they're going to have a lot of health problems and would probably die young sin has consequences he told me hey well they can't help it they they think that they were born this way i tell them that they're brainwashed and and i think he said well how do you know if they were if they were born in russia do you think they would think that what what about the 1800s do you think they would be gay absolutely not there you go it's it's true it's just because that they brainwashed them to think those things and and and then the little kids get in a place of they're trying to get little kids to be uncertain of their own genders like cut how mad up is that in this time of uncertainty that they don't even know oh if they're a boy or not or um like it's it's messed up now in this sermon um christianity versus idolatry but branham's um said it like this well he was saying that uh i'll i'll read it he'll like to say say for instance here's the the traffic coming down the street at 4th this is off the topic i was saying broadway and louisville zoom zoom zoom just fast as they can 60 miles an hour across the street everybody rushing hustling bustling one little man walks out there raises his hand and and brother breaks slide well that little man hasn't got enough power to stop one of those cars he's got authority it ain't his power what well if one of those cars would hit him it it demolished him but let him raise his hand why the driving adverts of the car recognized the uniform now let me say what i'm trying to say here is is that before you can know where you stand you have to know who you are and the authority that christ gives you know who you are as a person so that you'll know where you stand uh oh brother they recognize that uniform break slide why look at his authority look what's behind him the whole system of the city is behind and the law enforcement of the city is behind him that uniform represents that he he's different yes sir because he's an officer now what what brotherhood was saying a while back we should be doing um we should there should be loads of miracles and stuff kind of coming from us because as what the bible says but in order for that to happen you have to recognize the authority that you have you have to know where you stand as a christian in order for you to be that person that that god uses in that powerful way i had to know where i stood and in order for me to be a priester up here i didn't and nowhere know that this is what god called me to and to do and and i had to go off of that because i couldn't i had nowhere else to stand if god didn't show me what his will is for me if god didn't show me what was for me i wouldn't know where i stand and why would i stand up here if i didn't know if i was meant to be up here now uh he hollers stop well one one of them cars goes zoom and and just like that but they better not try it and look that what what's behind him they'll squeal well breaks aside he don't even and have to say a thing just raise his hand that does it sure his authority comes from the law enforcement it's all behind him and himself he's weak but but that what what's behind him that's that that star he's his dress he's all dressed up in a uniform that's what what the not not the idol but what the addressed let us put on the whole armor of god in that helmet of salvation the great big shield the size of a door of faith oh brother it's not what he what he is but what he represents that's what the officer it ain't it ain't that little man standing there he's just an ordinary man but but what he represents it that's a real for for us today what what we represent and us see we we have no authority of our own flesh of our own self but the authority that christ gives us and then we know where and where we stand and we can proceed just like a cop has to know who he is otherwise a cop would just be any other civilian if he didn't know where he stood in the law as a person if he was just like well i don't know if i i don't know about the laws and stuff if a cop didn't know about the laws then there's gonna be it's gonna be a problem and so us as christians we have to understand and let's just say this for a sentence for um for um for example where are um where are believers right we're um let's say we're uh let's let's say uh let's change that for a second let's say that we're all uh this is a police academy we're up our police well dude if i asked you do you know the law and you told me what i don't know then get out of here go back to law school otherwise i'm gonna have to uh teach you you better start you better start and um read it you better start learning uh my example i'm saying is if this is a police academy and you came in here i don't know what i'm doing and and you you said well um you know i'll give you a book of of uh law better start studying that that law better start getting a better understanding in other terms i guess if i was putting this as like a uh police place and and and every one of us are let's say every one of us are police that have graduated and and and i i'm the the chief let's say i'm the chief right now let's let's say i'm the chief and i'll say ask you um well what what do you do when you see someone run a red light you said well i don't know but how did you get here well you have a uniform on but how in the world are you how in the world are you a how are you a cop how did you become a cop if you don't even know what you're supposed to do in that scenario what okay let me ask you this what do you do when when you see someone run out of a a building with a bunch of money if you if you said well i i i get get my gun out and i shoot it we're going to be in trouble there's going to be a lot of deaths happening if we just go by what you just said there but but what in in that a police officer is supposed to know the law completely from from what one into the other they don't always follow the law they do things they they do things that aren't that they're not supposed to do and there's bad cops and there's good cops and if they if but they don't know that law then they're not going to do what they're supposed to do and they probably won't be very successful for very long because they're going to run into some trouble they're not following the angle law and they're the ones that's supposed to be the upholders of the law and and we can say that the same thing for for this message if you're a message believer and someone asks you let's say you're you're a cop right a cop asks you well is this in that legal i don't know you're a cub you're supposed to know that and and and so if a if someone goes and asks you as a message believer well it's in the message they ask you questions about the message and you're just like well i don't i don't know i don't know no you know you'll have to read it yourself that's like a cop said saying well i know i know the the lawyer but you have to read it yourself by the law but i don't know what it is that's why we should know as believers what we believe we should know exactly what we believe in where we stand just like just like a police officer is supposed to know the law as a police officer should know what his authority is and what he's supposed to do in these certain conditions and us as believers are supposed to know what we're supposed to do in these certain conditions and and um in that in that way we put on the full armor of god that is that is our uniform that's our uniform as believers but our full armor of governor is jesus christ yes sir all devils slider breaks when they see thee that they they see the full armor of god the two baptism the holy ghost amen and seed it go coming straight from the throne of god dressed in the full armor of his resurrection amen not that you are strong you're nothing it's what's behind you why you're dead you joined the army you you've joined the police force you're going to keep law and control of these devils that's right you're on the police force whole thing's behind you see you are wrecking dead you you're nothing you couldn't stop any your authority that's being given you because you are raised in city in heavenly places in christ in jesus the devil recognizes that everything slides this breaks when them hands go uh what's up amen and so us as believers we should know exactly where we stand we should know exactly where we stand with this word we should know exactly what we believe in this message and that that's why i 100 percent recommend for and for everyone to have a church age book because because as if because that is is the message in in word form and it is also you can get a greater understanding of the message if you get this book i got in and i opened up and i was like whoa you know i'm reading i'm like wow i did not know that it's because it's because it's in because in that book you can get a greater understanding of the message so that you'll you'll know where you stand in these uncertain times and and that's how it is with this message when when there's different and quotes and things that certain preachers bring up from what brother branham said there there's there's message believers that take a quote and they make an entire doctrine out of it that's right there's massive believers that do that well brother bannon said this well satan also talked from this bible and quoted to jesus and and jesus said well the word also says and that's how we should be as believers when we see someone uh and in the message or anyone in general say say something like well brother brandon said this but brother branham also said that too and it is and so that that's how we should be and know that the bible no man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so that is what we should live and breathe and and know this book completely from the front to the back and and no whenever someone comes up and in and asks you a question what do you believe you instead of being like well i don't know i don't know where i'm saying i don't you know you have to know and someone asked you a question about the message now i it used to be words um it was a because of me not knowing everything in the message i i've there there was as believers that that came in here like uh jd i didn't know all the answers and when he asked questions uh you know i was like well you know um i don't know i you know read it yourself and i realized i need to be a i need to know more about this i can't just try to get other people in this church if i don't know what i believe myself who am i to say well well you should believe the message when i don't even know the message the whole message how how are we supposed to stand as believers if we do not know the whole whole message or how to respond to someone that that asks questions about the message otherwise you're not really standing very firm you should be able to respond with a you should be able to we should be able to respond with exactly the the right answer instead of being like well i don't know let me just go read it again but when the word get gets in our hearts and not just on paper if it's on our hearts be able to quote anything to anyone well i wish i could be like that but it takes it takes time it takes a lot of reading and studying and to understand these things or to to have it on your heart this there's people in in china that they will lock them up and for believing to and and they'll they'll take a bit of the bible they'll read this whole book and they'll memorize his entire chapters there's by heart the they'll know every baby and they'll be able to write it down word for word and and the reason for that is because there's there is a desperation and for the word but we we've gotten into a place where we have it all the time and now we're taking it for granted like uh brother pilot said we take things for granted we have it so good right now and there's people over in different countries that that can't even get access to the bible and and they memorized it by heart and they they and and it's like some eggs smuggling around and here's here's a portion of the word right and then they memorize it by heart because because it's so important to them and they and they know it's so important such vital information that that if we don't know where where we're standing we should know exactly where we're standing we don't seek it enough we don't seek a greater understanding enough and it's it's true we live in in such great times and then when things get bad all of a sudden where there's desperation there's only desperation when things get bad it's only desperation for the word to take into heart only when they want to take away the aid from us only then are we do we get desperate for uh to know the things of god i i challenge each and every one of you this morning to seek for a greater understanding to start reading more instead of just having your same habits every single day wide i read a little bit every day i'm just in the same way of course you read a little bit and you listen to brother branham in the morning but really stink for a greater understanding and and to have a greater understanding not only hey do you have to re read the word but you've also got to listen to what brother branham says about it and what and and read the church age but i believe the church book is a really key thing that we're missing in a message and people don't read it enough that to get a greater understanding of this message that we believe to read that book you can we got no we got no excuses you can look it up online church book pdf and you'll find it online and you'll be able to read it it's on there yeah it's it's out there it's of our reach but does it take a time a bad time a time where things start crashing down for us to finally realize we need to start getting desperate here we need to start actually seeking for a greater understanding of of god and we need to start seeking to know the things to know what we believe as as message believers we shouldn't wait for these these desperate times these harsh times for us to to start to start really seeking for a greater understanding sometimes it takes a per personal some personal trials to get you to to believe that to actually start getting desperate i i know that by experiences things happen and all of a sudden you're just really praying i wanted to be like that every single day start getting desperate lord i need you lord lord help me to have a greater understanding to to really get desperate when there's not a time of of great trial where before all that happens so that when it does happen which it will you'll be ready and you'll know where you stand and you'll you'll stay with that and you you won't and and you won't all of a sudden be destined because you're already seeking for a greater understanding you're already a a getting getting in that that greater revelation that god wants you to have and you already have so much of the word word in your heart so much of this in your heart that that in in those times that that you'll know exactly how to react to every circumstance and and we we need to get like the egg that this morning to where we're really in a time of desperation and and i also i'm a strong um advocate for discipline and it does take a lot of discipline to get like that but but that's what why it's called discipline because usually a parent will discipline you when you're young but then when you go older you gotta have your own sense of discipline in things and sometimes god has to do that discipline for us i don't want to wait for that i don't want to wait for god to to stop disciplining me to to to start seeking after him to start actually getting desperate for him i don't want to wait till till desperation and comes for me to get disciplined i want to be disciplined now i want to do all that i can for and for god now right now let's do it and now so that when and that um so that god doesn't have to discipline us like that and which god will chastise us but let's chastise ourselves first so that then so that the chastisement will will be when we start forgetting that that we're supposed to be in disciplining ourselves which we do forget sometimes we get a little bit forgetful and we start thinking like this this sermon it will will go go forth and then then next couple weeks you'll forget about it and it'll be the same old thing again until until oh oh god uh chastises you to get it back to that a place of desperation where you're seeking after god but if we take this word and put in our hearts right now in in this moment and and and just remind ourselves each and every day i also say we you should get a devotional if you don't have one already and stay devoted to seeking for greater understanding each and every single day it's so important in these times now here um this is last quote i think i'm gonna read one from brother branham as soon as you receive the holy ghost everybody begins to talk about you say you you've gone crazy lost your mind you was going to be a holy roller or something like that and then if you cannot stand chastisement the bible said you become an illegitimate child but if you're really born of god it don't make any difference what the world says or what anybody else says you know where you stand and all the devils in hell can't upset you then you prove it by your fruits not by your voice but by your life you live the right kind of life that is so true amen that's like you by by your fruits by their fruits you shall know them so so if if we're not living that kind of life every single day living for god striving to do his perfect world then we're not getting houston uh another place another quote it's on the same paper because um peter and john when they passed through the gate called beautiful the lord spoke to them about a layman dying there there was no uncertainty they didn't have any education they didn't have they didn't even belong to a church they didn't belong to denomination there was no uncertainty about their experience they had the positive then they didn't have money they didn't have membership they didn't have education but peter said such as i i have i'll give it to you in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk they had hidden power they dressed like other men they walked on the street they eat like other men but they had a blessing inside of them that give them a certainty to know where they were standing said i don't have any education i don't belong to any church i don't know any theology i don't have any money the only thing i have i'll give it to you if you'll accept it he said well ed what is it he said in the name of jesus christ and not just stand up and walk no uncertainty not stand up and try see if you can and move your foot not not stand up and try and see if you'll get better but in the name of jesus christ what rise up and walk now there you are ame amen not in in order for those miracles to come out of this uh from this bride from us we have to know exactly where we stand we have to know where we stand and and know know that we're going in in the rapture know who we are and what once we i believe brother brahm said this before once the the bride catches the revelation of who she is that's when the rapture is going to happen and and if we can oh my we we need to get that revelation and know where we stand no where we are amen musicians if you'll come i i heard this is pretty funny um it was it was a guy i think it was on uh i don't know but he said [Music] if if if you get to heaven and i'm not there you've gone to hell so certain right there that like that it's kind of it's kind of a a joke but but but seriously it is so so certain of where he's going how many wants to be like that this morning amen i want to be certain i want to know where i stand i want want to amen let's pray lord god i pray lord that that you'll help us to get exactly where you want us to be lord to know exactly where we stand who we are lord i pray that that you'll you'll just help each and every one of us to to get and get that revelation of who we are stand with me if you lord help help us to to grow in our wall with you lord help us lord to have a greater understanding of you lord help us to get in that place of desperation for you with that and without there having to be some event or something that that happens to come up that that'll cause us to have that desperation but lord help us to be certain and know where we stand god help us to to know who we are help help us lord if if there's anyone one tonight that is uncertain of where you stand won't you raise your hand if if you feel like you you should be
