our heads kind Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus grateful once again Lord to be in your house Lord with your children assembled together Lord Jesus and father no doubt but that you thought about this meeting when you spoke to disciples and when he was speaking to him and said wherever two or three are gathered together there I will be in the midst Lord and we truly thank you Lord Jesus that you are still in the midst Lord father we ask God that you just help me Lord to get out of the way Lord Jesus to be able to minister your word say what you once said father things that would take hold on people's lives they would anchor they would stabilize they would strengthen each and every one of us Lord and then we ask God for the congregation Lord that their hearts and their minds would be in the place Lord that it could come down into their ears and then to be able to hear with the Heart Lord Jesus and that it might bring forth a hundredfold that it might accomplish that's that which it was sent out to do we ask these blessings in Jesus name amen we want to speak tonight with the help of the lord it's going to be kind of a part two of inheritance amen inheritance when we kind of speak on God's promises amen talking about God's promises praise the Lord amen so if you will let's turn our Bibles to the Book of Revelations and I mean that's kind of uh kind of a big thing we said Sunday wasn't it amen about inheriting everything all things belong to you everything amen I was thinking on the way to church I said you know what if that really got dropped down on it really really grabbed a hold of us you know man what would what what kind of a reaction would that do down in here you know amen and so just think about it praise be to God and there's one more scripture that I thought about that I didn't speak on Sunday and um you know that I wanted to mention and and talking about just you know making sure I like I don't want to preach my thoughts or my ideas we're not here to do that I want to make sure that every thought I have everything I speak is the word of God I mean it's with me on that that it's the word of God that it can be backed up from Genesis to revelation all the way through and it'll be accurate amen and so there's one scripture and that's what we're going to start off with amen the night with the help of the Lord amen I also wanted to say you know I don't uh I hope I didn't get out of hand on Sunday but I was just loving worshiping the Lord amen and you know I thought you know uh God is great and he is greatly to be praised amen I thought he healed me big so I'm Gonna Worship big [Laughter] amen praise the Lord you know sometimes hey I'm going to keep you standing here too long but sometimes you know we get sick we get better and we say well I just got sick and got better no that's not all it was God allows you to get sick to let you know that he is your healer it was one of those attributes that he displaced to us that he was in him before the foundation of the world and I believe you ought to have some kind of reaction in US amenada caused us to worship Him and praise Him amen say thank you Lord for my healing amen because you know we're always going to run around scream shout and and praise God for saving us amen well all these other things he does for us we need to worship and praise him for amen Revelations 21-1 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heaven and first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea amen and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as he bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be God himself shall be with them and be their God amen amen as we go down through here just look at the big picture here look at the scope of it amen and God shall wipe away we're crying amen and they're shout and I want you to notice this word shall also because tonight a lot of a lot of this word we're going to use his word a lot this word shall amen because it's in that promise or a covenant or what we would call it a contract and whenever you write a shell in there that's the way it must be amen shall be no more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are faithful and true and he said unto me it is done I'm the alpha I'm the big Amiga I'm the beginning and I and the end and I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of Life of the Water of Life freely listen to the conclusion of the matter to the believer this is the last thing he says until he begins to talking to the unbeliever and so forth he that overcometh shall inherit all things shall hear it after the scope of the doll he says this is what's going to happen Hallelujah all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight I just want to say I believe that there's so many so many promises that God made there's so many blessings that God bestowed upon us that what I would call external kind of external promises such a a place to live uh you know a home a heaven the creation the new Heavens a new all these things that he's going to make for us you know and we could kind of maybe say that's external but you know the one thing that Jesus really came for is that if you give us the internal amen the internal the thing that's on the inside is what he really came along with everything else but what's important is John 3 16 for God to love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe in him should have ever lasting life because anything external but this one here this is what's really really important your life that eternal life is what's really really important and amen and we praise that because as I think about uh what brother bam said of mechanics and dynamics of a car you know because I'll tell you what you might not have a fender you might not have a hood and it would look really bad if you didn't have fenders and hoods on your vehicle it'd be bad if you'd have enough a trunk the lid was off you know the bumper was hanging on dragging down the road or something you know but I'll tell you what if that when you turn that key and it cranks and it purrs that's very important but that's not all that's important the other part of the mechanic it's important when you pull that gear down and you wouldn't put that transmission in because I can have all the engine you want but if it don't move it don't do you any good but as long as that engine as long as that transmission is working good guess what it'll get you from point A to point B amen now I'm here to tell you if you've got the Holy Ghost you got every promise everything else is taken care of Amen the Holy Spirit the power amen and I could go a little bit deeper no matter how much engine and so forth no much how much gas we know that without that fire because somebody knows a car runs on fire it has to have fire the gas has to explode combust you'd have to burn without that you ain't got nothing and that is the way it is with the Christian tonight no matter how much you say well I'm a Christian I'm gonna believe it that that's wonderful I like to hear all that that's all external but there has to be a fire in your heart burn amen that's what's very important because I'll tell you what without that you gotta hunk of junk it ain't no good absolutely no good without that praise the Lord so tonight we want to go and kind of transition for talking about what's ours and inheritance and so forth over also into the promise of God but bam he makes a statement when I got saved brother I took this old Treasure Book amen I don't know about you but just lately I don't know and I've always this has always been a real treasure but I like when the Lord makes this real to me I like to be able to look at this as a treasure book and if you I'll tell you what if you got a real treasure you're not going to put it on the Shelf somewhere and it's going to get dust on it amen and this is this is oh my I believe truly believe that we could probably speak of a thousand years of sermons on just what this book is ah just what this book is because without this right here I mean you've got nothing to stand on you've got absolutely nothing amen this is the rock that we stand on on Christ the solid rock ice sand all over the ground is sinking sand you can have no confidence I can't have anything really without this here right here and God send us his word isn't that right amen and God sends his word and we're to believe it amen and so oh my so he says this Treasure Book of God and I looked through it to see what I possessed amen I find out that every blessing that's in this Bible belongs to me now I like that he said blessing because you know not every promise is yours not every promise in this book is yours huh yeah it doesn't pertain to you amen he that believeth not shall be damned it will be damned that's a promise of God that don't apply to you it's a promise of God but that belongs to another people amen he that believeth and he's baptized shall be saved praise be to God that belongs to you that's your promise whosoever believeth on me shall not perish shall not amen you know we could take all the shells and I wanted to take a lot of the shells in the Bible and maybe talk to you about the shelves and sits make sure it's absolute and so forth and really make sure it's really concrete but you know when it comes right down to it every last word every jot every Tittle every Cross of a t and every dot of an eye is a promise are you with me it's sure it's absolute amen amen the more I think about this and realize and begin to see what's really in here the more it creates an appetite for me to want to see more I was with you I want to have an appetite to see what's more what's mine foreign amen so let's start till we go into Rapture is that right amen I'm just looking forward to that amen now and I hope hopefully I'll get to it tonight but we want to talk about how that it takes the arm of faith huh to cut these promises loose that's the prophet put it to receive them unto ourselves and he mentions how there's a lot of people that can cut out salvation but can't cut this out can't cut that out some of them have enough faith for deliverance and perhaps justification or sanctification or have so much Faith but we want to have as much as possible isn't that right to cut out every promise that we have and I'm here to tell you hopefully by the time we get down here tonight I want you to understand that there's a lot of promises huge promises in here that belongs to you that's yours as a believer you can't who knows you can't claim any of that as unbeliever no you have to be a believer and that's the number one thing that's the only thing that brings you into this is through faith or belief you don't believeth amen every blessing that's in this Bible belongs to me and it belongs to every believer yes sir praise be to God every promise in the book he says is yours he says this is like a great arcade of God's economy belongs to every believer and by one Spirit we're all baptized into that and everything in here belongs to you Hold Steady think about it doesn't that do something to you think it all belongs to you let that sink in it's yours if you can believe it a scripture or something wasn't that uh the man that came to Jesus with his daughter that was you know really bad shape and so forth and and he says you know he says you know believe is thou that she can be wild or whatever he says you know help them I believe he said Lord I Lord I believe help thou my non-belief he says you know if thou can't believe all things are possible Anything is Possible to them that can believe and I if I was to say anything tonight and challenges on anything I believe that the problem with each and every one of us is how to get to that place to be able to receive that and to be able to handle that much huh anything is possible all things are possible anyway I'm getting ahead of myself all right so he says belongs to every believer and everything that it belongs to us and we're Heirs of all things every promise of God Amen then I read a little something a little further down that I liked he says in our soul rests solemnly upon his word or his promise how many knows that's the truth every day we live if you come down to the doord up as you live your life you are completely your soul is completely standing on what God Said that's where we're standing as we go no matter what you go through you stand on God's word that's the only thing you have to stand on I thought about that song and I asked brother Josh maybe you sing it at the end Standing on the Promises of God praise the Lord standing on I want to think that we're walking on the promise of God we're living on the promise of God we're breathing and having our being hey all because of what God Said that's what it's all about it's about what God Said this book like I said every word every jot every title everything is true right it's all a promise let's look at another scripture follow me let's go to Matthew 6. all right that is not the one I was looking for it's Matthew 24. let's hope that's the one yeah this is the one and let's go with 29. immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light the Stars shall fall from Heaven and their powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear to sign up the sign of the son of man in heaven amen and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming into clouds of heaven with power and great Glory now again as I said in the beginning there were Revelations if you notice Revelation 21 God describes a new Heaven and the new Earth and wiping away all their tear all of that even has a big picture there and there at the end he talks about and you shall inherit on all things now follow this as he begins to talk about the moon not giving her light the big things that are happening as we come to the conclusion of what we want to try to say verse 30 and it shall appear to sign of the son of man in heaven then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one of end of Heaven to the other I'll learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branches yet tender and puteth forth his lead you know that summer is nine amen we understand that as Israel coming been becoming a nation she's always been to Victory amen so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things no that is nearer even at the doors keep that in your heart every day that you live we are right at the door we are right at the time don't get lukewarm sloth floor in this hour I mean how many believe it's high time to be on our prayer bones amen amen what would you give you anything you want what would you say what would you say you'd want think about it you have to think about what you'd ask my desire is Lord have me ready have my family ready and my loved ones ready and keep me ready amen because in the hour that you're living in in the world that we're living in it's so easy really and I'm here to tell you it's gonna take a special prayer or a special person special seed something in there to keep you on track folks amen so likewise now notice barely verily I say unto you not verily verily but single verily on that one doesn't matter one merrily's good enough for me right all right this generation shall not pass not from what I understand what message starts is the generation that sees Israel become a nation will not die off they could live a hundred years huh but it won't all die until this is done amen till all these things be fulfilled amen Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away it doesn't matter what God ever said he always means it it's always true right be the guy can I say something if the whole world could just believe that it all behaved that what he said he said true and if they could genuinely believe it they 'd all be saved wasn't it Abraham that believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness all God asks is for you to believe believe it with all of your heart you got to believe it not so long ago I listen to brother Adam he says you know when a person genuinely repents genuinely repents and give their heart to God and get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ God is obligated to give that person the Holy Ghost for the promises to you to your children to never fall even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen amen because God said so if you truly do that I believe God backs his word up I believe God keeps his word amen I'm sure that a lot of us have and if we haven't let's make sure that when we get like the children of Israel like the three Hebrew children when they were put into the test of whether God would keep his word or not uh I went ahead and they were going to Forfeit their lives but they were going to believe God and they see God keep his word amen they've seen God praise the Lord all right so my point here is that heavens and earth will pass away but my words if you'll notice the word shall amen they shall not pass away amen we find over Revelations Heaven and Earth has passed away right they had passed away um here this is the quote I just now thought of so I'll read it now we're supposed to be Abraham's seed spiritually speaking being in Christ now we should take a hold of every promise of God and cherish it as though it was already done hey man how many times Brother Brad pray for somebody said now go believing go believe in accepting it I think it's already done John Ryan right it wasn't done even bond is a back telling everybody I'm Healed I can see I can see yeah so much oh another thing about this another point about this whole thing is that every promise in the book you have to fight for every inch of it you have to fight for every inch wide what do you got to fight unbelief you got to fight your own mind you got to fight every thought that comes into there yeah man you gotta battle through that get rid of that once you can get through all of that it's yours yours amen praise be to God so he says put it and cherish it although it was already done for when God has spoken he can never take it back I like the thought of when God speaks a little bit because we know that half the time I gotta think maybe even up here of how I'm gonna say it and maybe in the middle of a sentence stop and rephrase just a little bit you know you know and you wanted to have it the right effect and so forth and and especially if you're trying to figure things out or doing a job or whatever you got to think five six times God don't have to ever think twice perfect thought the first time and when he speaks it it's perfect it's Eternal it's forever and you can hang yourself believe that you can hang your soul on any of the word of God and you are hanging your soul on every word of God I believe there's another place that said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God that's why we live by every word so when you hear a church say well my predestination our church don't believe that our church don't teach that Bible teaches it you got a problem you've got a problem when you don't believe that Eve brought us into this chaos by disbelieving one word just one word the prophet of God said we're not getting back unless we believe every word amen how many beliefs every word folks I don't care what somebody reads to me and it may seem like it uh you know just like the Bible says I create evil that's what the Bible says well you know when you go to think and be kept don't think that's what the Bible says I believe it huh he did create the devil how did all that come about huh everything had to come from God he put him put that evil out there so you can take your choice make your choice praise be to God you know what a miracle is I'm looking at however many are here I'm looking at this many miracles you have free will you can do whatever you want to but here you are in church and you want to love the Lord you want to serve him you don't want nothing with the devil you want to get the devil devil get behind me isn't that right get away from me I want to serve God that's a miracle right there I'm his we're working out looking at miracles because look at the world amen I was looking at somebody at a gas station or somewhere they were all tattooed up you know what I thought sister Becky my thought was them folks I'm telling you right now them folks are really thirsty they're thirsty for satisfaction they have need of having their first quenched and they don't know what else to do and everything but even brother bam taught it in thirst he says you know they go uh cheating on their wives they go drinking beer they could do all of these things because there's a there's found there in there there's because of thirst that's unquenched I suppose you wouldn't do that if you were satisfied isn't that right so when I see a tattooed person I see maybe that's the Son of God I don't know who it is but that person is thirsty I should hand them a book are you with me say here this will satisfy you how many can confess Lord I'm not near bold enough I need to be bolder amen all right Hebrews 4 says in verse 12. he says that uh faith is what holds the sword there's nothing can hold the sword of people but faith in God that's what yield wields it you might have a week with your arm and faith maybe you can just cut out justification or whatever it might be enough to join Church but a good strong arm of faith can cut through to the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen it can cut through all of the Divine it can cut out Divine Healing cut through to gifts miracles signs and wonders hey man how many wants to see more of that in your life praise the Lord in Joshua 1 it says everywhere The Souls of your feet sets that means possession that's the way it is today everywhere the soul of your feet sets it's possession just keep walking Footprints means possession amen amen but abandonment praying for people and so forth and he was talking about a job Jawbone of a mule that I believe it was uh Samson grapped you know to kill all the Philistines he says let's forsake all these old cots stretchers wheelchairs crutches and say it belongs to the devil amen I mean no that's what the devil wants to do he wants to put you in a wheelchair he wants to put cot he would make you sick amen I don't know if I can say it it just comes to mind now but I'm thinking of a song Lord Lord Lord you surely been good to me amen you saved my soul when I was lost you healed my body when I was sick it surely been good to me I made a song to The Devil I said devil devil devil you've surely been bad to me devil devil devil you sure they've been bad to me you made me sick when I was well you surely been bad to me huh now get thee behind me Satan amen amen praise the Lord all right so when we talk about a promise God's promises it's like a covenant right a covenant or a contract and you all know brother branham's description so I'll read it I'm gonna read it he says the Covenant has always been a strange thing he says in China when they make a covenant one with another they take a little salt and throw it on one another that's a covenant a promise so something's going to confirm it when we make a covenant with one another we shake on it we shake hands how many can say those days are pretty much gone yeah yeah you better not all right unless he's a genuine believer Maybe put her there that's a covenant but in the Easter Orient during this time when they made a covenant they went and killed a beast and split it open and stood between the dead beast and they wrote out their Covenant hereby say a certain certain thing and they write a covenant their agreement and they take this agreement and tear it in two this is hidden too much much it carried in in two P two pieces one piece is given to one and the other one is given to the other one amen when this contract and they're taking oath over this deadbeats and say let my body be as this dead Beast if I don't keep my Covenant Hallelujah now watch God in his Spirit how God would be tore apart on the day of Calvary God was made flesh and dwell Among Us the Lord Jesus the Emanuel there are Calvary the Covenant God wrote with us he took Christ the calvary and tore him apart soul and body and he took his body up and set it at the right hand of his majesty and sent back his soul here his spirit on the earth to make a covenant to carry out that gospel amen and that same Dove that has same dovetail power that Jesus had he's the same yesterday today and forever that church has been given that Covenant through the baptism and of the Holy Ghost amen I want to look at another uh that contract is John 3 16 whosoever believeth let's make a contract isn't that right and you make that contract and when you truly believe and you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are receiving that other half of him how many believe that he tore himself apart he separated himself on the day of on the day of Pentecost and he went down to everyone that was believing and when you have that contract amen that's what we have and also not just uh John 3 16 but also in Saint John 4 14 and 12. very familiar scripture would that be that we want to bring he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do amen because I go to my father man Mark 16 says go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe now most people as we know don't believe this part they don't believe in laying out enough hands and so forth casting out Devils taking up serpents and if they lands on the sick day shall recover Faith be to God how many knows we will need that we certainly need that in age that we're living in all right Greater Works than these shall do you because I go to my father because I go to my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name amen that will lie do praise the Lord that will I do amen if you love me keep my Commandments so if you'll notice what he's saying here if you truly believe on him and you receive that spirit you're going to do the very same things that Jesus Does and especially here in the message let me tell you especially in the message the church world can't identify with this amen God is not going to be partakers with a prostitute somebody denies their word right Panic the latest the greatest the most authentic Pentecostals back in 1960s two three and so forth got to the place after the seals as you know after the seals were opened and he preached denominationalism is the mark of the beast denominations are the mark of the beast he said because they rejected Christ and when he said that guess what happened the Pentecostal says if anybody goes up the brother bannon's meeting where Jesus is coming down Healing The Sick Discerning the thoughts of the body of the mind and so forth the same thing he does if we'll kick him out we'll take your name off the book [Music] huh now you tell me that brother Brandon wasn't right exactly right because those that were in those denominations got to hate him for saying that because it was the truth because denominations do not dovetail with Christ they're going to believe what they want to believe no matter what the scripture says and right there you damn yourself people that just want to go their own way they damn themselves you want to do your own thing go ahead you might even be spiritual you might be able to speak in tongues and whatever but in the end you're going to be lost God then I'll just have that I'm not going to receive it amen what I want what you want to do on a daily basis is think the thoughts of God think the way that Jesus would think talk the way Jesus would talk act like Jesus without oh my and don't look too hard at yourself because you'll find where all your mistakes are where you haven't but look to him and say Lord From This Night on from this Wednesday night on right here some of those things that I know is not Christ like I want to shed it I want to see God take that away from me because I can't identify with John 4 14 to 12. amen the same Works did I do shall you do also I tell you what I don't believe I don't care if it's sisters or whoever it is you got the power to walk on water like Peter did all the powers are to you just like any other believer amen doesn't have no variance between man or woman no it all belongs to you and if you could believe it don't you know people live how many know people live here in this world and in this country and they're happy living underprivileged you know and just a just an old you know drinking and just not a life at all hardly you know and they seem to be happy with that amen we don't want to be like that we don't want to be just well I'm a Christian I go to no no I want the full powers of God I want to be everything I can be in Christ Tommy's with me tonight it's about climbing higher in Christ going higher and well I'm gonna tell you something like just come to mind again forget your past forget your past look to the Future always every day look to the future I don't care what happened yesterday I don't care if it happened a couple hours ago see God I put it under the blood huh we're going forward I'm climbing higher how many months go higher if you're an eagle who hired in any other bird amen praise the Lord so what I did just to give you an example of a covenant they would take that paper and they would sign it and they would write their contract on it and they would rip it in half isn't that right they'd rip it in half praise be to God the works that I do shall ye do also in that right so I take a paper here I made a little Mark and I hope you all can see better than whatever but right here all right right there couple little scribble lines that's pretty close right look good see this is the groom and this is the bride this is Christ on the throne and this is you and I and when he went to Calvary when he went up North to heaven even up to heaven not North but anyway um he came back he sent his Spirit back down up north right send it back on the earth he stayed up there I can't I still can't figure it out just how he can be up there in his body be there because his body's there somewhere right you know yet his spirit is down here he's interceding for us you can only imagine but maybe somebody the gallery but set this back on the earth and when he comes back now notice in the final of a contract when the contract is finished those pieces come together and say all right it's done now we're talking about brother randomly that when the Rapture comes guess what that'll be the rapture when the contract is finished when he comes back to receive a bride is that right it's going to be like him the Bible says we're flesh of his flesh bone of his bone Spirit of his Spirit thinking of me thinking can I say acting always acting life of his life it has to be the same now what if he comes back and we take a paper like this and put it together huh somebody tell me what the problem is do the lines line up not the Lions don't line up things don't line up they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover well the days of Miracles is past doesn't fit there's a Miracles it don't it don't fit to try to say the days of Miracles just fit a a past if you'll notice it's not the right color it's a different thickness of paper it's not even the same texture of paper it's just nothing like it huh I wrote on here well our church don't believe that that's what this here is our church don't believe that tell somebody the word of God God sent a problem I don't believe uh come on oh I'll send you a milli to the prophet for the great and Dreadful day of the Lord huh whenever signs and wonders were done and very same thing oh boy I've been listening to some message where brother Brandon has really condemning the world in the church world for not accepting Christ and what he was doing in his ministry wasn't him he was his mouth how can you not see it amen because it was a terrible thing to reject Christ that way all right that's right call it mental telepathy don't line up Jesus said you call this you know they called him Beelzebub because because he discerned the thoughts and tens of the hearts that he was the chief of devil telepathy now they call it the Lefty which is also a devil that don't line up you know call it the telepathy and so forth the devil that don't lie well well let's try this one look at this here this is looking pretty close we got all the lines and everything there but you know but we're not looking at that side we're looking at this side all right so it's wow that's pretty close right but the other little John I said what's that are you guys trying to draw a comb here or something did you have a big calm brother about it no so anyway you look at that and say that's closer but guess what this is this is still everybody else's way huh this is where Matthew 24 44 I believe said that it would be so close that it was possible it would deceive the very leg I hate to say this but that's Among Us that's Among Us because we're the elect ORS not they're dead already so close that if you aren't careful it'll deceive the very elected he'll look closer but seal won't quite line up and guess how you can tell how can you tell by the fruits you shall know them amen praise the Lord when he comes back he wants somebody to say I believe every word [Applause] amen my spirit punctuates every word of God that's the truth I believe every word it'll not jump perfectly you'll have to say that Jesus had you'll have the same Spirit you'll have the same thinking and I think that's the word tonight we need to say Lord fill me with more of yourself fill me with more of that spirit because that's what he's coming for amen husband and a wife have to think alike they have to think it's amazing I just love it a lot of times a man sister Donna she'll I'll say sister my wife anyway she'll say something and I'll have been thinking the very same thing or it's like vice versa I believe that's the way it is with Jesus Christ we will think do it man shall not live by bread by a lot of pre-churchers can't say that a lot of churches say well it doesn't really matter huh it doesn't mean that huh it means this let me tell you something a preacher back here is at a worse place than anybody I know of when it comes to saying this is what it means you got to be careful with that I may know that you better have the correct meaning amen you can't miss place this uh the Bible or the word you can't misquote it amen you can't just believe it you got to be careful when you go to saying this is what it means because amen you know that's why I try to you'll hear me a lot of times and save it but the prophet God said amen there's a lot of New Revelations a lot of good things out there maybe sound good but it's better go with the prophet said it better go with the Bible said and you know something else I thought about while I was thinking on this I thought you know where brother Brandon went beyond a curtain of time and he was selling he was told that he was going to have to give an account for all of this you know and and so forth he said really he said well Paul we'll fall into it brother Brandon wasn't afraid he knew what he did he said well Paul that was his question to the angel will Paul have to give an account for what he did Angel says yes sir he was going to have to give him the cow well brother man about had a cheap leaping Joy he says well praise God if his makes it mine will make it amen because I taught what Paul taught how many believes that and where do we Rejoice on this side and those people over there we're resting I want to say we're standing on that we're resting on that we know that that's what it was we're resting we're standing on it amen praise be to God why because they stayed with the word stay with the word amen this is so full of nuggets so full of treasure so many things we can't even begin to almost name some of the great things that God that promises that he's made he has promised listen he says many are the afflictions of the righteous we're not promised the flowery bit of ease but we are promised that God will deliver them out of them all is that right God is always with us amen let your conversation I believe Paul said in Hebrews the last chapter be without covetousness and be thankful for such things as you have Fred the scripture says I will never leave you I was in perfect quote close I will never leave thee thee and neither will I for safety amen how many plan God Thomas never to leave us I don't care how bad it gets out there I don't care what the Curt and how bad yes God's never going to leave it's one of his child children can we go just a couple couple others yet John 10. and John 10 is another great promise foreign amen if you'll notice I spoke Sunday on 10 and 8 about all that ever came before me with thieves and robbers and so forth there's a lot of them that come around but over here but the sheep hear them not amen now verse 27 says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish Glory I like that that's a promise of God that if you are his sheep he has promised that you'll never perish that's good enough for me but he's going to give you a little more is that okay you want a little more and neither shall any man pluck him out of my head oh praise be to God you talk about some good old-fashioned Baptist preaching huh because they believe in eternal security they believe this scripture and I'm saved I'm always saved God I'm gods I don't care how many cigarettes I smoke and how much drink beer I drink huh but are they right no they're not right why because if you truly are his God will wash you from all that stuff when you do know things it's against God you remember it shows you're not his man if you wish truly is you'd be a sheep and you'd act like a sheep not like a goat not like a sinner not like a smutty person from hell no it doesn't work that way just because you say your sheep don't make your sheep just because you say you're one of God's an eternally secure doesn't make you that way it has to be something that God did on the inside of you not words not your mind it has to be God it has to be something he has done in your life I'm about to jump on this open folks why am I myself when I think about where I started and what he's brought you through and he's brought you through and brought you through and brought you through it shows he's done the work he has begun to work and he will perform and it's a promise for oh my I wish I could fly he promised he would perform but he'd do it you want to get away from God as a child of God all I can say is good luck you're gonna need it because you're dealing with God's hand folks yeah you ain't getting away from him oh you'll be the most miserable creature and you'll come crawling in them doors say God I can't handle it anymore go ahead amen I believe in eternal security I don't believe that God Saves you to lose yeah now I don't believe so amen and he says my Father which is greater than me is greater than all no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand and one by the way he's right here he's in me he said I am my father are why do you realize that's the very reason that the Jews took up stones to Stone Jesus is because he made himself God yeah of God he says you make yourself God oh I'd like to preach them Pharisees huh I said he is God how many times Jesus preached to him but he still wouldn't listen I am a father alone you know and so forth praise be to God I love this promise shall never perish it's a promise of gosh no man can pluck him out of my hands your mind um how many knows you're not perfect you make mistakes you get away from God sometimes yeah I mean your pastor does but he don't never let me go too far and he never leaves me nor forsakes me you always tell you now you know you're just a little lukewarm you know you're not yet scripture don't mean as much as what it should you got too busy with your work you got too busy with the cares of life and now the scripture reading doesn't mean all that much to you anymore prayer oh my I don't care if I'm in the middle of my conversation with my wife and it's time to pray we get to drop on my knees in this prayer time in the morning I want to pray don't dare go out those front doors without praying on your knees for a while my goodness the sky might fall on you how many believe it amen pray every all day long everything I do I say thank you Lord for helping me get that done Lord thank you for this Lord thank you for that I believe there's their prayer in closing I believe there's a prayer that every one of us probably has and that is that we can be more steady with our walk in the Lord come is with me me more steady in your spiritual walk with the Lord and you need it I need it you got to have it every one of us we all need it above anything be more steady about it don't be so up and down about it amen amen that's him holding on to you when you just keep coming up when you're getting back up and so forth it's him holding on to you God bless you let's stand tonight you love the Lord tonight let's Praise Him amen say thank you Lord Jesus for your goodness Lord thank you for your promises Lord hallelujah hallelujah you're a great God and you are greatly to be praised hallelujah thank you Jesus amen amen praise the Lord let's just have a word of Prayer Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and that is our heart's desire Lord that we would not get so caught up with the things of the world that our spiritual walk begins to fade away begins to get lukewarm and and not what it should be Lord Jesus it's the father we pray tonight God that you would touch us Lord Jesus and keep us keep that fire you know Hearts burning every day Lord and Lord when we read you word father we can read it and oh we see all the great Treasures that are in it Lord it feeds our soul father Lord says help each one in here God if they haven't had a revelation from you or something that is in the scripture that is really real to them Lord I pray God before Sunday you would make your word real to Him Father for we have to have Revelation from you help us Lord Jesus as our walk gets more steady as I walk get more straight Lord Jesus not as much staggering not as much up and down father but more consecrated to you Lord for we know that we're looking for you we look up at the clouds I do and say God one of these days I'm going to see you coming in the Clouds Of Glory I'm looking for you every day and I pray God that everybody here would have that same anticipation Lord and it'll bring everything and around us and all these natural things into perspective and in the place that it should be father thank you Lord for being with us Lord Jesus and for speaking to us thank you for your promise Lord our whole heart our whole soul and mind stands on what you said in Jesus name amen
